{"id": "269312", "name": "Hard \"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\" 4 Quiz / Test  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "Who will return power to the Dominion Rod for you?", "correct": "Shad", "options": ["Telma", "Renado", "Ilia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShad.\n\n\tAfter you clear the Hidden Village of Bulblins, you will be able to reach Impaz' hut in the far end of town.  Sadly, she is the last one remaining in her tribe of Royal Family protectors.  She gives you Ilia's Charm, a Horse Call, that she was given from Ilia when they were both captives.  When you bring it back to Ilia, she will regain all of her memories and she'll let Link keep it as a souvenir, so now you can call Epona from anywhere (well, nearly anywhere) in Hyrule Field and some of the surrounding towns. Renado will let you into the basement to meet Shad, who is learning of an odd seal, and he will give you the Ancient Sky Book which will allow Shad to return power to the Rod. \n"}, {"text": "How many characters need to be recovered for the Ancient Sky Book?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Seven", "Five", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tIn order for Shad to make sense of the odd seal under Renado's hut, you'll need to search for six Sky Characters scattered around Hyrule.  These can be found behind odd owl statues in Faron Woods, Kakariko Gorge, the Bridge of Eldin, Hyrule Field at the Hyrule Castle Town Amphitheater, the Great Hylian Bridge, and Gerudo Mesa. Once the book is complete, return to Shad and he'll leave the basement.  Now's your chance to open the owl statue seal.  behind it is a large cavern containing a rather ancient and obscure cannon.  Warp the thing to Lake Hylia!  After all, where else do you see usable cannons in this game? \n"}, {"text": "How much does it cost to repair the cannon to the City in the Sky?", "correct": "300 Rupees", "options": ["500 Rupees", "200 Rupees", "400 Rupees"], "explanation": "\n\n\n300 Rupees.\n\n\tAfter the cannon has warped to Lake Hylia, Fyer will take over the restoration of the giant object.  Once your 300 Rupees has been well-spent maintaining the cannon, you can hop inside and be shot to the City in the Sky, the seventh dungeon of the game.  Ooccoo will come along too, opting to take the chance in finding her home.  Luckily for her, City in the Sky is the home of her tribe, the Oocca.  When you reach the city, you can meet her and her son in the shop near the entrance.\rBringing this cannon to Lake Hylia doesn't mean that the cannon to Falbi's shop will be out of service.  One sits on the shore while the other remains on the water next to the Isle of Riches. \n"}, {"text": "What weapon is obtained in the City in the Sky?", "correct": "Clawshot", "options": ["Dominion Rod", "Gale Boomerang", "Bomblings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClawshot.\n\n\tIf you make your way to the basement fan of the City in the Sky, you can find the Battle Chamber containing the first Aeralfos of the game.  This creature will fly above you with a sword and a shield and swoop down when the time seems opportune.  Using the Clawshot you already have, you can pull the creature down and slice at it until it's defeated. Once you complete the battle, you receive another Clawshot to form the 'Double Clawshot' technique.  Now, if you happen to stabilize yourself on any clawshottable surface, you can use the second to advance to yet another location.  This is crucial in order to finish the stage and beat the boss of the City in the Sky. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the boss found in the City in the Sky?", "correct": "Argorok", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nArgorok.\n\n\tThe Argorok of City in the Sky certainly isn't the friendliest of creatures...after all, he destroyed some of the local structures, forcing you to find alternate routes.  If you have claimed the Boss Key and the Double Clawshot, you can advance to the highest rooftop of the City in the Sky and face the beast.\rFirst, climb up the towers using the Clawshots and avoid the fire that is shot at you.  At the top, find an opportune moment to shoot the Clawshot at the Argorok and bring it to the ground with your Iron Boots.  When its armor has broken enough, you'll be able to find a pulsing sign on its back.  Continue the battle, now circling the arena in the air on the Peahats that have spawned in the rain.  Shoot for the sign when you can get around to it and sword the dragon until it's done.  You can claim the final shard of the Mirror of Twilight after the battle. \n"}, {"text": "After the completion of the City in the Sky is probably one of the better times to attempt the Cave of Ordeals.  How many floors are in this difficult trial?", "correct": "Fifty", "options": ["One hundred", "One", "Twenty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFifty.\n\n\tIf at any time you need a good challenge, head to the Gerudo Mesa and delve into the Cave of Ordeals containing fifty floors of pure battles.  As you progress through the levels, the enemies will get harder and harder.  Every ten floors, you'll reach a Great Fairy who will unleash Fairies in the springs of Hyrule. The fifth and final fairy floor will hold a Great Fairy who will give you Great Fairy Tears.  You can get these from the Great Fairies at any spring.  The Cave of Ordeals will contain two of the sixty Poe Souls of the game, so if you need to complete Jovani's quest, you will need to get to the forty-fourth floor (at least). \n"}, {"text": "How many Sol Spheres can be found within the Palace of Twilight?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Four", "Three", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tTake the Mirror of Twilight to the Mirror Chamber of the Arbiter's Grounds and jump into the world of twilight.  If you take the east or west wings of the Palace of Twilight, you'll be able to secure the two Sol Spheres and strengthen the Master Sword with the power of light.  The only tricky thing about this is that both spheres are guarded by the hands of Zant, who waits in the throne room. When you take a sphere with you, you will constantly be chased by the hand until you reach the entrance.  If the orb is captured, you can try and take it back with the Clawshot, but if you can't, Zant's hand will simply take it back to the final room of the wing. \n"}, {"text": "When facing off against Zant, which is not a dungeon that is revisited?", "correct": "Arbiter's Grounds", "options": ["Goron Mines", "Lakebed Temple", "Snowpeak Ruins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArbiter's Grounds.\n\n\tDuring the battle with Zant, you will be teleported to the Forest Temple (and the room containing Diababa), Goron Mines (in the room containing Darbus), Lakebed Temple (in the room containing Morpheel), Ook the baboon's lair in the Forest Temple, and the boss chamber of Snowpeak Ruins (which contained Blizzeta).  After these five confrontations, each revisiting your experiences in such temples, you will be transported to the south entrance of Hyrule Castle town to face off against Zant. Keep your shield up, attack when you can, and he'll go down easily.  Following this fight, you will return to the throne room and Zant will finally reveal the mastermind behind the whole ordeal...and he will be defeated once and for all by Midna. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not an enemy found within Hyrule Castle?", "correct": "Darkhammer", "options": ["Aeralfos", "Lizalfos", "Darknut"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarkhammer.\n\n\tThe Darkhammer is only found as the mid-boss of Snowpeak Ruins.  When the forcefield around Hyrule Castle is destroyed, you can make your way around the courtyards for Small Keys and face off against the King Bulblin for the last time.  When you enter the castle, you will need to ascend the towers and reach the battlements to find the Boss Key.  Along the way though, there are many powerful enemies guarding the stairwells. Bomb Arrows come in really handy for more than half of these though, and you can pass through a few without being touched.  When you reach the top of the castle, you can find the treasure room and the final doorway separating you from the throne room. \n"}, {"text": "Where does the final swordfight between Link and Ganon take place?", "correct": "Hyrule Field", "options": ["Mirror Chamber (Arbiter's Grounds)", "Hyrule Castle", "Palace of Twilight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyrule Field.\n\n\tWhen the battle begins, you'll first face off against Ganondorf within Princess Zelda.  By deflecting energy balls at her, you can return her to normality.  This will send you to part two of the battle involving a giant beast known as Ganon.  Simply shoot the creature in the forehead with an arrow and slice away at its stomach. Every once in a while, it will hide within portals, but he can be stopped in various ways.  When this battle ends, you'll be forced into Hyrule Field where Epona and Princess Zelda will help you knock Ganon off of his steed.  The final battle is within a small arena and mainly concerns the Master Sword. When Ganon has been struck enough, he will fall and Link can take the opportunity to make the final blow destroying Ganondorf and saving both Hyrule and the Realm of Twilight.  Midna will revert back to her old form and the kids in Kakariko Village will be able to return home.  Midna will bring Link and Princess Zelda to the Mirror Chamber for her final farewell and she will destroy the Mirror of Twilight once and for all, leaving both sides of the world to remain seperate. \n"}]}
