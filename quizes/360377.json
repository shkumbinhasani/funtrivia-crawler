Claudette was worried that someone would find them and, sure enough, someone did.  While the two of them started making out, a figure ascended the stairs, surprising the two of them.  The figure killed Barry, stabbing him in the stomach before advancing on Claudette.\r Fast-forward to the present day...on Friday the 13th no less... \n"}, {"text": "What name do the locals use for Camp Crystal Lake?", "correct": "Camp Blood", "options": ["Camp Coldwater", "Camp Cripple Lake", "Camp Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCamp Blood.\n\n\tAnnie heads to Crystal Lake, walking a part of the way and hitchhiking the rest.  Stopping in at a local general store she asks for directions and gets nervous reactions from the patrons; they seem unaware that someone is planning to reopen the park -- Annie's there to become a counselor.  One of the diners, a truck driver, offers her a ride towards the camp.  En route to his truck, however, Annie is approached by a crazy, old man who warns her that she'll never come back again.  \"It's got a death curse!\"  It doesn't stop her, however -- she's too bubbly and excited.\rOn the ride, the driver tells her what happened at Camp Crystal Lake so many years ago -- the place is jinxed and two kids were murdered in 1958; one kid drowned in 1957; in 1962 they found out the water was bad.  She should quit.  Ask anybody.\rHe drops her off in front of a cemetery and she walks on. \n"}, {"text": "Does Annie, the chef, make it to Camp Crystal Lake?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAnother truck heads to Camp Crystal Lake containing Ned, Jack, and Marcie; they arrive first.  When they get there, Steve Christie, the new owner, introduces himself and fellow counselors Alice and Brenda.  It's immediately to work for the newcomers as they set to work repairing the camp and preparing amenities for the kids.  Alice worries that she and Steve won't be able to work together since the two of them broke up before commencing the repairs, but she says she'll give him until Friday at least before she leaves; she confides in Bill in the meantime.  As Steve heads out for supplies, he tells everyone to show Annie to the kitchen when she arrives so that she can start work.\r Annie, meanwhile, hitches another ride to speed up her trip to the camp.  On the way, however, she begins to realize that something is amiss since the driver doesn't talk (even through her good-natured talk of aspirations) and drives past the camp's turn-off.  Worriedly, Annie asks the driver to stop but she ends up jumping out of the passenger door, hurting her leg in the process.  The chase doesn't last long; the driver plods after her through the woods and slits her throat. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph, the crazy guy, ends up going missing from town.  Who finds him at Camp Crystal Lake?", "correct": "Alice", "options": ["Steve", "Marcie", "Ned"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlice.\n\n\tThe counselors already at the lake take some time to have fun out on the water, setting up the barge, swimming, sunning, and talking.  Little do they know, someone is watching from across the shore.  Ned jokingly pretends to drown and when they pull him out of the lake they all have a little laugh.  You know -- something to take lightly considering the location.\r At one point, a police officer arrives to introduce himself and ask who's staying at the camp.  He also informs the kids that the town crazy, Ralph, is missing.  He believes he may have come down to the camp.  It isn't long before someone finds him; Alice comes across him in a pantry.  He gives him the whole \"death curse\" spiel before departing.  Not unnerving at all. \n"}, {"text": "What board game variant do some of the counselors decide to play to wait out the storm?", "correct": "Strip Monopoly", "options": ["Strip Scrabble", "Strip Chess", "Strip Parcheesi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrip Monopoly.\n\n\tNight falls at Camp Crystal Lake and the counselors wander around.  As clouds roll in, Ned believes he sees a person walking into one of the cabins and follows them in.  Marcie and Jack end up seeking shelter from the rain and end up in the same cabin, the only difference being that they're in the mood to spend the night.  While they both share the bed together, neither is aware that Ned is in the top bunk, his throat sliced open by whoever he followed in.\r Alice, Brenda, and Bill, meanwhile, hide out in another cabin during the storm, opting to tend to a fire and play Monopoly, only Brenda's version of it.  As the three of them open some beers and smoke marijuana, they take off one article of clothing every time they owe rent.  Ah camp life. \n"}, {"text": "Ned, Jack, and Marcie are all killed without anyone noticing.  Who is killed in the outhouse cabin?", "correct": "Marcie", "options": ["Jack", "None of the three", "Ned"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarcie.\n\n\tOff in the darkened cabin, with Ned on the top bunk, Marcie ends up leaving Jack in bed to use the bathroom.  As he lights up a joint he notices a droplet of blood fall onto his forehead.  Before he can register the moment, a hand grabs him from under the bed, holding him down, and an arrow stabs upward through his neck.  The killer strikes again.\r Out in the outhouse, Marcie hears the door open and checks to see if anyone is there.  She believes it could be Jack but finds no one.  When she goes to use the sink she continues to hear noises and investigates only to come face to face with the killer.  This results in a hatchet to the face, killing her instantly. \n"}, {"text": "Brenda is killed when she's lured outside into the rain.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe three playing Strip Monopoly are interrupted when the wind from the storm blows open the front door of their cabin.  Bill and Alice stay to chat but Brenda remembers that the windows of her cabin are open, so she decides to call it a night.\rBrenda heads to the outhouse cabin to clean up before bed but doesn't notice the shower curtains moving nearby.  She leaves without a fuss.  She doesn't realize something is amiss later on either, when the killer watches from outside her cabin window.\rFinally ready to turn in, she hears a voice out in the storm screaming for help and follows it into the rain.  Taking her flashlight she rushes to the person's aid and ultimately ends up in the archery range.  The floodlights are turned on around her and, as she backs up towards the bullseye target, she's killed. \n"}, {"text": "Why are Alice and Bill unable to call for help?", "correct": "The phone lines are cut.", "options": ["There are no reception towers in the area.", "The camp hasn't had phones installed.", "Their cell batteries are dead."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe phone lines are cut.\n\n\tBill and Alice, now the only ones left, are unsure of what's going on.  Someone turned on the lights at the archery range (and then turned them off) and Alice thought she heard a scream.  Additionally, everyone seems to have disappeared.  When they find a bloody hatchet in Brenda's bed, they get a bit leery.  Suspicions are further aroused when the outhouse bathroom and the other cabins turn up empty.  Alice thinks they should call someone, but the phones are dead.  Bad to worse I tell you.  Someone cut the line.  Someone cut the lines on their car too, and it's ten miles to walk to town.  Bill reasons that there must be an explanation and they'll all be laughing about it after.\r At a diner in town, Steve realizes he needs to head out to make sure his counselors are okay.  So begins his drive back to camp.  On the way back his truck dies but he gets picked up by a police car willing to take him the rest of the way.  The ride is cut short when the cop has a real emergency to tend to, and when Steve arrives he's greeted by the killer, a bright light, and a knife to the gut. \n"}, {"text": "Who is discovered to be the person killing the counselors at Camp Crystal Lake?", "correct": "Someone else", "options": ["Brenda", "Ralph", "Bill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomeone else.\n\n\tDespite Bill having fixed the generators the power goes out, and it can only be because someone has tampered with them.  The two remaining counselors light some lanterns and Bill heads out to fix the issue (\"it must be the gas\").  He never comes back.\rAlice falls asleep briefly to find that Bill still hasn't come back and the power is still off.  This means that it makes sense for her to investigate his whereabouts.  Searching the generator room proves fruitless, that is until she closes the door and finds his body stuck to it, arrows through his head and torso.  She races back to her cabin and locks the door, tying it shut and blocking it with whatever she can find.  This proves futile when the killer throws Brenda's corpse through the kitchen window.\r That's when a car pulls up.  Alice moves her barricade and opens the door to find a woman who introduces herself as Mrs. Voorhees, an old friend of the Christies.  Alice explains to her that everyone is dead and Mrs. Voorhees says that it's just the camp and the storm.  When they head inside the cabin, they find Brenda's body and Mrs. Voorhees says that Steve should've never opened this place -- a young boy drowned the year before those other counselors died in the fifties.  She was the cook at the time, and she knows the counselors were making love while he should've been watched.  The boy's name was Jason.\rAlice insists on waiting for Steve to return and, to her shock, she listens as Mrs. Voorhees reveals that Jason was her son, and today would've been his birthday.  She couldn't let them open the camp again after what happened -- not after her son died.  She says that Alice let him drown and she must enact her revenge, but Alice hits her down with a fire poker and flees. \n"}, {"text": "With what is Alice able to subdue and defeat the killer?", "correct": "A machete", "options": ["A gun", "A noose", "An axe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA machete.\n\n\tAlice runs out to Mrs. Voorhees' car to make her escape but finds Marcie's body inside; she finds Steve hanging, dead, upside-down from a post further down the path.  She decides to keep running.  Mrs. Voorhees comes to and, in a child's voice, schizophrenically chants \"kill her, mommy, kill her\".  The chase is on.\r Alice has several encounters with Mrs. Voorhees around the camp, all of them culminating in a narrow escape.  This finally ends with Mrs. Voorhees catching up to her with a machete on the dock.  In this last fight, though it seems hopeless, Alice is able to get the upper hand by wrestling the machete off her foe and beheading her, ending the madness.  She gets into a canoe and waits for sunrise, drifting into the lake.\r When she awakens, she finds that it's morning; the police arrive.  As they call to her, she's taken aback as someone pulls her into the water from behind-- Jason, the young boy who drowned.\r But that's a dream.  Alice awakens in a hospital bed to find that she's the only survivor.  When she asks about the boy in the lake, the police claim that there was no boy...which means he's still out there. \n"}]}
