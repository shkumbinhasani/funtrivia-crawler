{"id": "332753", "name": "Check It Out Quiz | Mixed Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Mixed Literature", "Authors and their Works"], "questions": [{"text": "One of my favorite trilogies is by Suzanne Collins.  Although it's a dark novel filled with murder and struggle, it captures readers very quickly.  The second book in the trilogy is \"Catching Fire\", and the third is  \"Mockingjay\".  Which trilogy is this?", "correct": "The Hunger Games", "options": ["The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo", "The Girl on Fire", "The Underland Chronicles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hunger Games.\n\n\t\"The Hunger Games\" (2008) began in a similar fashion to \"The Lottery\", where a town selected two people to send off into \"the games\".  These games were fought to the death.  Katniss Everdeen went to the games, and discovered a way to cheat the system.  The second book in the series was \"Catching Fire\" (2009) and the final was \"Mockingjay\" (2010).\r I never expected the sequels to beat the first book, but they did.  They just kept getting better and better.  You really should go the library and check these books out! \n"}, {"text": "\"The Looking Glass Wars\" trilogy, by Frank Beddor, were an awesome read.  I implore you to check them out.  They are a fun fantasy series which is an adaptation of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\".  The stories follow Alyss Liddel's story, the REAL story, that Lewis Carroll did NOT tell.  Which of these is NOT in that trilogy?", "correct": "Hatter M.", "options": ["The Looking Glass Wars", "Seeing Redd", "ArchEnemy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHatter M.\n\n\tThe first in the trilogy was \"The Looking Glass Wars\" (2006), which also gave the name to the entire trilogy; it was followed by \"Seeing Redd\" (2007) and \"ArchEnemy\" (2009).\r It took Frank Beddor several years simply to study Lewis Carroll's original novels.  It took him longer to develop new characters, each somehow linked to an original character (e.g. the white rabbit became Bibwit Harte, an anagram of 'white rabbit', Humpty Dumpty became Mutty P. Dumphy, and the Mad Hatter became Hatter Madigan), and to develop a storyline about Wonderland that was unlike anything ever heard of before in Lewis Carroll's novels, but still keeping the novels connected to Carroll's work.\r \"Hatter M.\" is a spin-off comic book series about the adventures of one of the characters from the series, Hatter Madigan. \n"}, {"text": "It does not matter how hard I try, I have never found an author I like more than this one.  This author might be most famous for his \"The Da Vinci Code\" trilogy, but I still fancy the novel \"Deception Point\", as well as \"Digital Fortress\".  All of this author's novels deserve a visit to your library, so you can check them out.  Who is the author?", "correct": "Dan Brown", "options": ["Jason Pinter", "Douglas Preston", "Dean Koontz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDan Brown.\n\n\tIn 1998, Dan Brown released his first novel, \"Digital Fortress\".  \"Angels and Demons\", the first in his world-famous trilogy, was released in 2000.  A year later, in 2001, \"Deception Point\" was published.  \"The Da Vinci Code\" was released in 2006, and the third in the trilogy featuring Robert Langdon, \"The Lost Symbol\", was released in 2009.\r Dan Brown has very peculiar writing techniques.  He gets up in the morning around 4:00am, because this is when he can think the best, when the house is quiet.  He has an old hourglass that he sets, and after an hour, gets up to exercise, to keep his creative juices flowing.  Finally, perhaps the most unique writing technique Brown has adopted is a way to look at his novel at a new perspective.  How does he accomplish this?  Why, strap on some gravity boots and look at the book from the ceiling, of course! \n"}, {"text": "I have had to read many classics for school, and usually dread the reading of these books.  But they have often become some of my favorite books of all time.  For instance, this classic about a revolution was wonderful.  During the revolution, Mr. Jones is driven out of his home.  Also, one of the main characters is Napoleon.  What George Orwell novel is this?", "correct": "Animal Farm", "options": ["Burmese Days", "Nineteen Eighty-Four", "Coming Up For Air"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnimal Farm.\n\n\t\"Animal Farm\", written in 1945, is about the Manor Farm, owned by Mr. Jones, which is overrun by his animals.  The farm is then renamed Animal Farm.  Under the leadership of Snowball, a very smart pig, the farm booms with success; but things become a bit more difficult when Napoleon ousts Snowball and takes over leadership himself.  If you want an interesting and short read, you should really check it out!  But one word of warning, however: do not read this if you are an animal lover.  Reader discretion IS advised. \n"}, {"text": "There is much allegory in one of my favorite classics, \"Lord of the Flies\".  For instance, the conch represents democracy and order.  If you enjoy survival stories, you should check this book out.  But do you know who the author is?", "correct": "William Golding", "options": ["Sterling North", "Roald Dhal", "Wilson Rawls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Golding.\n\n\tWilliam Golding published \"Lord of the Flies\" in 1954.  It sold only a few thousand copies before going out of print, but became a bestseller, even required reading in some schools.  The name \"Lord of the Flies\" comes from the pig's head on a stick (and I'll leave out details for the weak stomached) offered to \"the beast\" in the novel.  \"Lord of the Flies\" is also the translation of \"Beelzebub\".\r Wilson Rawls wrote \"Where the Red Fern Grows\", Sterling North wrote \"Rascal\", and Roald Dahl wrote classics such as \"BFG\", \"Matilda\", \"Esio Trot\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", and \"The Twits\". \n"}, {"text": "Clive Cussler has written dozens of novels, with many series featuring different characters.  I quite fancy the Dirk Pitt novels, myself.  There are over twenty books featuring Dirk Pitt, but what was the first of these to be PUBLISHED (another was written first, but was the sixth published)?", "correct": "The Mediterranean Caper", "options": ["Raise the Titanic", "Pacific Vortex!", "Sahara"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mediterranean Caper.\n\n\tClive Cussler wrote \"Pacific Vortex!\" before \"The Mediterranean Caper\", but \"The Mediterranean Caper\" was published first, in 1973.  \"Pacific Vortex!\" was not released until 1983.  \"Raise the Titanic\" was published in 1976, and \"Sahara\" wasn't until 1992, the 11th book in the series.  The series, however, does not need to be read in order.  You should check them all out!  In 2005, \"Sahara\" became a film featuring Matthew McConaughey as Dirk Pitt. \n"}, {"text": "Audrey Niffenegger's novel about Henry and Clare is definitely a favorite, although due to some scenes it is definitely for a mature audience.  It was written in 2003, and only 6 years later, in 2009, it became a major motion picture.  What novel is this?", "correct": "The Time Traveler's Wife", "options": ["Eragon", "My Sister's Keeper", "White Oleander"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Time Traveler's Wife.\n\n\tAudrey Niffenegger wrote \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" in 2003, and it became a film in 2009.  The movie features Eric Bana as Henry DeTamble and Rachel McAdams as Clare Abshire.  In the book and movie, Henry is a time traveler, though he does not know why.  His clothes do not time travel with him, however, so he often finds himself in an unknown time without any clothing.  It is a great read; you should check it out. \n"}, {"text": "Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors.  He has written many books, and quite a few of these have been made into films.  My favorite of his books was maade into a movie starring Miley Cyrus.

He wrote \"The Last Song\" specifically so Miley could be in the movie.  \"The Last Song\" was written in September of 2009, and the movie was released in March of 2010, a month after the release of \"Dear John\" in theaters in February.  Nicholas Sparks is a great author.  If you come across ANY of his works in your local library, you should really check it out! \n"}, {"text": "Kate DiCamillo has written several children's novels, and they are wonderful.  But which of these stories involves a mouse?", "correct": "The Tale of Despereaux", "options": ["Because of Winn-Dixie", "Bink and Gollie", "The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Tale of Despereaux.\n\n\t\"The Tale of Despereaux\" was published in 2003, and won DiCamillo a Newberry Medal in 2004.
