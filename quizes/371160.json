{"id": "371160", "name": "\"Edward Mordrake (Part 1)\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Freak Show"], "questions": [{"text": "Stanley and Maggie, both scammers, attempt to sell a fraudulent item to which of these?", "correct": "The American Morbidity Museum", "options": ["A high school", "The University of Tallahassee", "An undisclosed, private collector"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe American Morbidity Museum.\n\n\tVisiting the American Morbidity Museum under the guise of Dr. Mansfield and Victoria Rothschild, Stanley and Maggie check in on their latest deal, an attempt to sell a fake baby sasquatch.  Both are told that they could be handed over to the police for committing a felony, but realize that they're beat as there's no way to sell it off. They are told, however, that if they can dredge up an actual specimen for the museum then they'll get paid.  Their target should, ideally, be a freak show; a priceless item would be a welcome addition to the business, and there are only a couple in the States-- one in Coney Island and another in South Florida. They make their travel arrangements. \n"}, {"text": "Ethel is diagnosed with which of the following?", "correct": "Cirrhosis of the liver", "options": ["Kidney stones", "Heart disease", "Lung cancer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCirrhosis of the liver.\n\n\tHalloween is upon Florida, and the kids are out and about getting their candy.  In Jupiter, the children can't go out because of the curfew, but in West Palm Beach there's nothing holding them back.  A young girl collects her candy and watches as a dirty clown spies her from a distance.\rAcross town, Ethel visits her doctor with stomach pains only to discover that a biopsy has proven her liver cirrhosis, even though she hasn't touched alcohol in years.  She's a pessimist about the news, especially when she's told she has less than twelve months to live, but she feels blessed with the respect she's given by her doctor-- the first to treat her. \n"}, {"text": "When was Edward Mordrake alive?", "correct": "The Mid-19th Century", "options": ["The 1920s", "Ancient times", "The medieval era"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mid-19th Century.\n\n\tAt the Freak Show, the freaks have their typical Halloween celebration as Jimmy comes in, still haunted by Meep's death in the previous nights.  Dot takes it upon herself to yell out to the others, decrying them for their lack of respect towards Meep and an obviously-mourning Jimmy.  She suggests that they dedicate the show that night to Meep, but no one's willing to perform; it's common knowledge that no freak performs on Halloween out of respect for Edward Mordrake, an aristocrat from the 19th century who had a second face on the back of his head that drove him to madness and suicide. Now, he seeks the soul of a performer every Halloween; no one wants to summon Mordrake. \n"}, {"text": "What costume does Gloria have made for Dandy?", "correct": "Howdy Doody", "options": ["Raggedy Andy", "Woody Woodpecker", "Gumby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHowdy Doody.\n\n\tEthel, finishing her story about Edward Mordrake, finishes her drink and heads out, but not before Jimmy stops her and asks her why she's drinking again.  She decides not to let Jimmy know her secret quite yet.\rGloria, meanwhile, plans a Halloween party for Dandy and asks him if he's excited.  He is ,as it seems, because he wants to terrify people trick-or-treating.  Unfortunately, that's not an option as the curfew is still being enacted.  As it turns out, Gloria had Dora make Dandy's costume from scratch, and he'll be able to wear it at home.  This doesn't go over well; Dandy doesn't want to be Howdy Doody.  After the tantrum, Gloria decides to go into town to get a new costume while Dandy sets out to make his own...he'll be a clown. \n"}, {"text": "The troupe buries Meep with which of these?", "correct": "Chicken heads", "options": ["Wishbones", "A gun", "His favourite liqueur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChicken heads.\n\n\tThe freaks gather together next to the show grounds to bury Meep, tossing chicken heads onto the casket in memoriam.  While they cover the casket with dirt, a taxi pulls up and Jimmy heads off to investigate-- a woman named Maggie Esmerelda has come all the way from Philadelphia.  She's a fortune teller and she wants a job.\rThe twins awaken from what appears to be a shared dream; Bette fears that Dot wants to separate the two of them and begs her to reconsider since one of them will surely die if they go through with the procedure. \n"}, {"text": "Maggie gets the job at the freak show by allegedly telling Elsa's future.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tJimmy brings Maggie to Elsa's tent for a true judge of her 'talents' and while she's initially skeptical (and high from the opium), Elsa is willing to hear her out.  Bringing out her crystal ball, Maggie tells a fake future gleaning some ideas from the items in the tent.  Her observations help her greatly since she pinpoints that Elsa suffered injustice in the past due to her greed and jealousy. In the future, she says, people will be giving Elsa ovations for her music.  A man stands behind her, she says, and this stranger with dark hair will guide her to stardom.  Maggie faints and sells the act; she's hired on the spot. \n"}, {"text": "Ethel forces Dell to promise which of these?", "correct": "That he'll never tell Jimmy that they're father and son", "options": ["That he'll leave Desiree", "That he'll stay away from the freak show", "That he'll bring the show back to its glory days"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat he'll never tell Jimmy that they're father and son.\n\n\tOff in their trailer, Dell and Desiree spend some time together, but it becomes clear that Dell can't get himself in the mood.

When she dies, she hopes that Dell will be a better father for their boy, but never give away that he's his father.\rNight falls in Jupiter and Dandy dons his mask and outfit before heading downstairs.  When he runs into Dora in the hall, she makes a point of urging him to kill her, knowing that he won't actually do it.  At the last minute he drops the knife and leaves the house despite curfew. \n"}, {"text": "Maggie phones Stanley when she's settled at the freak show.  Where is he?", "correct": "In a motel", "options": ["Overseas", "In Washington", "In his car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a motel.\n\n\tMaggie gives Stanley a call from a payphone after taking a ride there from Jimmy.  It seems she's hesitant about going through with the plan; she's simply uncomfortable around the freaks, and being amongst them at all time unnerves her.  She recalls running into Bette and Dot for the first time, noting that it bothered her.  Stanley, sitting in his motel room, knows that they've hit the jackpot with conjoined twins.  Maggie worries that murder is too rash, but Stanley assures them it'll all be alright.  When he hangs up the phone, he spends the night with a male escort, revealing something freakish in the process.\rJimmy and Maggie are approached by the police and told that curfew will begin in ten minutes; Maggie diffuses the situation before they begin their ride back to the fairground. \n"}, {"text": "Who evokes the spirit of Edward Mordrake?", "correct": "Elsa", "options": ["Bette and Dot", "Ethel", "Jimmy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElsa.\n\n\tIn West Palm Beach, two housewives have martinis while the kids get ready for bed.

Elsa takes them offstage, but only to host a performance herself; she plans to fulfill Maggie's prophecy by rehearsing new material on her own.  Forcing some of the other freaks to play instruments, she unwittingly evokes the spirit of Edward Mordrake, unleashing him on the encampment when she sings Lana Del Rey's \"Gods and Monsters\". \n"}, {"text": "Does Edward Mordrake decide to take Ethel with him?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAcross the freak show grounds, the spirit of Edward Mordrake appears at Ethel's trailer with those in his personal troupe.  All Mordrake requires is Ethel's story of tragedy at which point it will make the decision as to whether she stays in the realm of the living or follows on to the afterlife.  Working on the circuit, Ethel fell in love with Dell at the height of her popularity and he convinced her, as her manager, to remove low-brow entertainment from her show and take it overseas, instead offering a cultural experience.  When they returned to the States they couldn't find work so Dell created a new show; they charged people to witness Jimmy's birth, out next to a field.  Mordrake, hearing the story, decides not to take her but thanks her for her story and apologizes for forcing her to relive the pain.  He and his troupe disappear immediately.\rOut in the woods, Dandy returns to the abandoned school bus in the woods hoping to come across the evil clown.  When the clown returns, new child in tow, it becomes apparent that they're going to have a fun evening. \n"}]}
