{"id": "397003", "name": "Guardians of the Galaxy Quiz | G | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "G", "Gn - Gz Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Peter Quill arrives on Morag searching for which of these?", "correct": "A sphere", "options": ["A lost cat", "A person", "A distress beacon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA sphere.\n\n\tOn Earth in 1988, Peter Quill is in a hospital reception area when he's called into a room to see his mother.  Although she is clearly in great pain, she gives him a present and insists that he open it when she's gone.  She asks Peter to hold her hand, but she passes away before he can.  Horrified, Peter flees from the hospital and sinks to his knees in a field outside...only to be picked up by a spaceship's tractor beam.\r Twenty-six years later on the abandoned planet of Morag, Quill uses his equipment to search an old structure, also donning a Sony Walkman to play his mixtape while he works.  Finding the room he needs, he steps inside to find a protected orb.  But he's not alone. \n"}, {"text": "Gamora and Nebula share whom as their father?", "correct": "Thanos", "options": ["Ronan", "Yondu", "Korath"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThanos.\n\n\tAs Quill nabs the orb he's come to collect, he's found by a group of Kree and held at gunpoint for the orb.  Fortunately, using a small handful of gadgets and guns, he's able to blast his way out of the situation, hightail it to his spacecraft, and jet away, dodging their cannon fire in the process.  Quill soon finds out that he's being pursued by his former ravager captor/mentor, Yondu, but he's not aware that the Kree, specifically their leader, Ronan, also seek the item in his possession. This only means one thing-- a bounty on Quill's head.  On the Kree warship The Dark Aster, Ronan calls upon one of his finest assassins, Gamora, to retrieve the orb as it is her adoptive father, Thanos, who plans to use it to destroy Xandar for him. She is sent instead of her sister, Nebula, who seems to hold a grudge for this. \n"}, {"text": "Quill plans to deliver his recovered item to The Broker on which of these planets?", "correct": "Xandar", "options": ["Femizonia", "Hala", "Krelar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nXandar.\n\n\tOn Xandar, the Capital of the Nova Empire, bounty hunter companions Rocket Raccoon and Groot spy a new target on the move-- Peter Quill-- who has a bounty of 40,000 units.  Quill ends up making it to The Broker with the orb either way, but when the Broker, who commissioned Quill to find it in the first place, finds out that Ronan is after the item, he backs out of the deal, citing Ronan as a fanatic who wants to wipe out Xandarian culture. Quill is forced out of the shop and into the presence of none other than Gamora who, quickly, nabs the orb and runs.  It turns into a chase though, and when Rocket and Groot get involved, the whole thing escalates leading to Xandar's Nova Corps forces intervening and apprehending the four of them. And that's how all four of them end up in the Kyln-- a high security Xandarian prison in an asteroid belt. \n"}, {"text": "Which of Quill's belongings is confiscated when he's sent to the Kyln?", "correct": "His Walkman", "options": ["His sneakers", "His Magic 8 Ball", "His Game Boy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis Walkman.\n\n\tAfter some brief introductions, the four outlaws are escorted to their cells and it's during this time that they discover that Gamora planned to claim the orb for a third party, not Ronan, as she was instructed.  That thread is dropped quickly as Quill finds one of the guards playing with his Walkman; his attempt to reclaim it lands him in a cell wth Rocket.  Their arrival in the Kyln is met with mobs of angry prisoners, though Rocket and Groot make it clear that they're the bigger men.  Someone has their eyes on Gamora though, especially since Ronan's the reason that many of them were sent to the Kyln in the first place.  That night, Quill finds her being taken to the showers to be killed by other inmates, but Drax the Destroyer beats him and Rocket there, vowing to kill Gamora as revenge for his murdered wife and daughter.  Gamora fights back though, claiming not to be family to Ronan and Thanos.  Quill manages to convince Drax that Gamora's not worth killing; he can use her as bait to get to Ronan when he comes to reclaim her.  After escaping Drax's clutches, Gamora adds herself into Quill's plans.  Rocket still plans to break them out of the Kyln and take Quill in for the bounty, but Gamora plans to sell the orb for billions of units and free herself from Ronan and Thanos both.\rOn Thanos' homeworld, the Sanctuary, Ronan speaks to Thanos directly, this time ending with the warning that he will get no third chances on getting the orb, and this time with Nebula leading the charge. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Peter Quill's ship?", "correct": "The Milano & Milano", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Milano & Milano.\n\n\tRocket lays out his plans-- he needs a guard's security band and another person's prosthetic leg.  He also needs a battery from behind a nearby control panel.  Fortunately, Groot is able to grab a battery immediately, triggering the emergency alarms and setting the plan into motion with next to no time to react. Drax, seeing the carnage, joins into the battle by supplying Rocket with a weapon.  All of the components come together in the end and the five prisoners make it to the command post, even though they don't actually need the leg for anything.  When Rocket has it all said and done, his plan to remove the Kyln's artificial gravity succeeds, and he's able to pilot the command post through its corridors to the storage area for them all to collect their belongings. Quill locates the orb in his pack, but finds that his Walkman is missing, so he sends the others to his ship-- the Milano-- and goes off to retrieve it before they depart, keeping the orb on him to ensure they don't leave.  He is, of course, successful. \n"}, {"text": "The Collector informs Quill that he is in possession of which of these?", "correct": "The Infinity Stone of Power", "options": ["The Infinity Stone of Time", "The Infinity Stone of the Mind", "The Infinity Stone of the Soul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Infinity Stone of Power.\n\n\tRonan's men and Nebula make it to the Kyln but find that there's no one around.  Yondu heads to Xandar, meanwhile, to interrogate the Broker about his buyer, a man known to most as The Collector.\rThe five fugitives argue on the Milano but realize that they're all stuck together until they get what they want.  They end up travelling to Knowhere, a mining colony said to be the severed head of a Celestial being which, over time, became a criminal hotbed.  Drax, Rocket, and Groot drunkenly decide to fight in the bar during the wait while Quill and Gamora are pulled aside by their contact, also The Collector, Taneleer Tivan, who plans to pay four billion units for the orb.  The Collector takes great interest in Groot, but that's not why any of them are there.  The orb, as he reveals, is much more important-- it's a containment unit for an Infinity Stone-- specifically the Infinity Stone of Power, which has killed everyone who's wielded it.  The Collector's servant, Carina, grabs the stone and accidentally detonates the entire building. \n"}, {"text": "Who attempts to face off against Ronan solo?", "correct": "Drax", "options": ["Rocket", "Gamora", "Groot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrax.\n\n\tAfter The Collector's museum is destroyed, Gamora believes that they need to bring the orb back to Xandar as there's a chance that Nova Corps can contain the power within it.  She convinces Quill that they can't bring it to Ronan, but there's little time to do that.  While the others spoke to The Collector, Drax contacted Ronan to face off against him in battle. That battle ends quickly as Drax doesn't have enough strength to fight his foe.  In the meantime, Gamora flees from Nebula with the orb while Rocket and Quill support her in nearly indestructible mining vessels.  In the end of the chase, Nebula shoots her sister out of her mining craft and Ronan's ship nabs the orb. Quill, in a last ditch attempt to save the others, he calls on Yondu to bring him in for the bounty, leaves his own craft, and gives Gamora his protective mask, allowing her to breathe. \n"}, {"text": "The Infinity Stone ends up being infused into which of these items?", "correct": "A hammer", "options": ["A staff", "A spaceship", "A necklace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA hammer.\n\n\tQuill and Gamora are picked up by Yondu's ship after they follow his call and the arrival saves both of their lives.  On Knowhere, Rocket returns to the ground and informs Groot and Drax that the others have been taken-- all because Drax was foolish and driven by his own rage.  Rocket explains that they have only one short chance to get across the universe to stop Ronan, but Groot reasons that they need to save Quill and Gamora first.  Despite the fact that the odds are against all of them, Quill is able to convince Yondu to let him go (using Gamora) in order to reclaim the stone, even if Rocket decides to fire on the Ravagers' ship first.  Either way, the five fugitives know they have to work together; the fate of the universe is at stake, and they all have the same motivations.\rNow that Ronan knows the orb contains the Infinity Stone of Power, he decides to use it, taking the power for himself and wielding it on his hammer.  Nebula, witnessing this, betrays her adoptive father; after they go for Xandar, they decide to go for Thanos himself. \n"}, {"text": "Who doesn't join the others in infiltrating the Dark Aster in Quill's ship?", "correct": "Rocket", "options": ["Groot", "Gamora", "Quill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRocket.\n\n\tQuill and the others develop a plan to take them onto The Dark Aster and prevent Ronan from touching down on Xandar altogether; if the Infinity Stone touches the surface of the planet, then everyone and everything on it will die.  When Ronan is dead, they can retrieve the stone with special devices that prevent them from dying upon contact.  Yondu insists, in the end, that he gets the stone.\rThe Ravagers contact Nova Corps and inform them of the situation, striking an alliance during the battle and complicating Ronan's plans a bit more.  The plan works to an extent; Quill and the Ravagers are able to break into the Dark Aster from the side with the help of Xandar's forces who, meshing together, surround the ship entirely.\rInside, the group advance towards the flight deck and, though Nebula attempts to intercept them, Drax blasts her with his weapons.  She reconstructs herself before engaging in battle against her sister in the fuel chamber.  Quill, Drax, and Groot go hand-to-hand against Korath nearby and they succeed, but Ronan is able to bring down the Xandarian shield single-handedly, destroying them with the Infinity Stone.\rOutside, the Kree dive bomb the city as Rocket, seeing the destruction above, flies up to help.  At the same time, Nebula, forced out of the Dark Aster by her sister, willingly removes her own hand and hijacks a ship in flight to escape. \n"}, {"text": "Who sacrifices themselves to save the others when the Dark Aster crashes?", "correct": "Groot", "options": ["Drax", "Quill", "Rocket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGroot.\n\n\tQuill, Drax, Gamora, and Groot arrive in the throne room and blast Ronan with a missile, but it doesn't make more than a dent in him, and the fight is only stopped, briefly, when Rocket flies his ship through the window of the flight deck.  It sends the Dark Aster careening through the sky and down toward Xandar as the fugitives group up inside.  Groot, growing himself to surround his friends, protects them all in his tendrils and tethers himself to the walls as the ship collides with the city below, saving them all but destroying him in the process.\rRonan, still alive in the devastation, emerges from the wreckage as the others rise from the ground.  As Ronan wields his hammer and prepares to strike the planet, Quill stands and dances to the music from the Milano's tape deck, in turn giving Drax and Rocket the chance to destroy the hammer with a blast.  In no more than a moment, Quill reaches out and grabs the Infinity Stone with his bare hand, putting himself in direct contact and wielding its power.  To save him, Gamora reaches out with her hand, asking Quill to take it; seeing his mother, he does, and Drax and Rocket follow suit, sharing the immense strength between themselves and controlling it enough to destroy Ronan and seal the power away in an orb.\rImmediately after sealing the stone, Yondu arrives to claim it, and while he thinks that they simply hand it over so he can sell it, Quill swaps it out without his noticing.  They give it to Nova Corps instead, as it's safer in their care.  Nova Prime, in response, reveals to Quill that he's not 100% Terran; he's partly something...more.  The fugitives, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have had their criminal records erased for their efforts and they've rebuilt Quill's ship.  The five gather their things-- including a piece of Groot, now regrowing in a pot-- and depart into the galaxy. \n"}]}
