What does BABIP stand for?", "correct": "Batting Average on Balls in Play", "options": ["Balls Against Balls In Play", "Bases on At-Bats in Play", "Batting Average Between Innings Pitched"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatting Average on Balls in Play.\n\n\tThere are three main variables that influence BABIP, the defense, luck, and talent level. If a player hits a ball towards third base, the difference between the fielding capabilities of the third baseman, where they are playing on the field, and the speed and bounces of the ball can all affect the hitters batting average by a great deal.An average BABIP is between .290 and .310. If a player has a higher or lower BABIP, it means that the player will regress back to their career BABIP rate eventually. A hitter can slightly control his BABIP based on speed. A more speedy player can beat out groundballs for hits, where another might not.\n"}, {"text": "Pitching sabermetric WHIP stands for Wins, Hits, and Innings Pitched. The stat shows how many baserunners a pitcher allows. What is the relation between the three components of WHIP?", "correct": "Walks + Hits / Innings Pitched", "options": ["Walks + Hits + Innings Pitched", "Walks - Hits + Innings Pitched", "Walks + Hits x 9 Innings Pitched"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalks + Hits / Innings Pitched.\n\n\tA more common sabermetric, this stat shows exactly how many baserunners a pitcher allows. It is known by many baseball statisticians as a poor judge on how well a pitcher is, because the defense usually determines what a hit is. Pitchers do determine a walk, based on how and where they throw. An excellent pitcher will have a WHIP just above 1, where a bad WHIP is usually around 1.8. \n"}, {"text": "OPS is a stat that adds slugging percentage and which other stat to determine how often a player gets on base, and how well he hits?", "correct": "On Base Percentage & OBP & On-Base Percentage", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn Base Percentage & OBP & On-Base Percentage.\n\n\tA more easier stat for average baseball fans, OPS stands for On-Base Plus Slugging, and combines a player's On Base Percentage and his Slugging Percentage. Traditionally, the best hitters in Major League Baseball will have an OPS of around 1, where an average ball player's OPS will be around 0.7. \n"}, {"text": "Sabermetrics wRC and WRC+ try to determine how many ______ a player was worth to his team?", "correct": "runs", "options": ["wins", "RBIs", "home runs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nruns.\n\n\tWeighted Runs Created, and the more in depth Weighted Runs Created+ try to determine how many runs a player was worth to his team, other than saying his complete statline to get an idea. The stat is based off of Weighted On Base Average. wRC+ sets the league average at 100 runs created, and adjusts player's stats based to that. If Player X's wRC+ is 120, that means he is 20% better than the league average. If Player Y's wRC+ is 75, he is 25% worse than a league average. \n"}, {"text": "Field Independent Pitching or FIP is a stat that determines a pitcher's what if every team's defense was the same quality, average?", "correct": "ERA", "options": ["Strikeouts", "Wins", "Innings Pitched"], "explanation": "\n\n\nERA.\n\n\tMost pitcher's FIP's are close, sometimes even the same as their ERA's. The formula for FIP is [(13HR)+(3BB)-(2K)] divided by Innings Pitched and then plus 3.1, to come close to an ERA. FIP is one of the mainstays among statisticans in sabermetrics. xFIP is similar to FIP, just Home Runs is substituted with expected home runs, using a home run per fly ball ratio of 10.6%. The stat is used as a predictor of how a pitcher is going to fare in the future. \n"}, {"text": "This sabermetric has become the main judgmental stat on how good a player is, and attempts to sum up all his contributions to his team, based on wins. What is the acronym used for it?", "correct": "WAR", "options": ["UZR", "wOBA", "tERA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWAR.\n\n\tWAR, or Wins Above Replacement determines how many wins a player was worth to his team, compared to a replacement level player, or a minor leaguer. Ways to calculate someone's WAR varies, but stats from fielding, hitting, and baserunning all play a factor. Over his career, Babe Ruth's WAR was a combined 177.7 wins above replacement, including 15.4 wins in the 1923 season alone. \n"}, {"text": "Because no ballpark in the MLB is the same, many sabermetric stats are adjusted so that all players can be treated fairly. Which of these ballparks is considered a hitter's park?", "correct": "Coors Field (Colorado)", "options": ["Citi Field (New York)", "Dodger Stadium (Los Angeles)", "SafeCo Field (Seattle)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoors Field (Colorado).\n\n\tBased on the elevation that Coors Field is at in Denver, the ball travels much farther off the bat then anywhere else. Estimates show that the ball travels 9% farther than anywhere else, and that a 400-foot shot at sea level, could go upwards of 440 feet in the Mile High City. Based on this, sabermetric stats are usually adjusted so that players, regardless of team, and stadium, are on a level playing field for evaluation. There is no real exact formula to remove park factors, because there is no specific way to measure it. \n"}, {"text": "The stat HR/FB means Home Runs per Fast Ball - means how many home runs a player hits on fastballs.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe stat stands for Home Runs per Fly Ball, and is used as a sabermetric to determine a player's luck in terms of power. An average HR/FB rate is around 10-15%, so a players percentage can tell you if he is getting lucky based on park dimensions, or on a hot streak. Along with BABIP, it is the two main factors in determining if a play is lucky or unlucky. \n"}, {"text": "These sabermetric looks at how many games a team should of won based on the runs scored, and allowed. The calculation is runs scored squared and divided by runs scored squared plus runs allowed squared. Which stat is this?", "correct": "Pythagorean Expectation", "options": ["WPA", "SIERA", "ISO"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPythagorean Expectation.\n\n\tThis stat is used to show how lucky a team is, as a group. The use of squared (therefore the Pythagorean Expectation) is questioned, as many statisticans are trying to find the perfect exponent, 1.83 is used by some websites to determine it. This stat has also been adapted to football and basketball to determine wins, compared to points scored. \n"}, {"text": "In the 2011 movie \"Moneyball\", who does Brad Pitt play, as he attempts to build the Oakland A's based on sabermetrics?", "correct": "Billy Beane", "options": ["Bill James", "Sandy Alderson", "Theo Epstein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly Beane.\n\n\t\"Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game\", a 2003 book written by Michael Lewis, looked into how Beane built his organization, based on sabermetric stats, which led to the 2011 movie. The movie starred Pitt as Beane, and Jonah Hill, a young Yale graduate who introduces Beane to these advanced statistics. Former shortstop Royce Clayton played Miguel Tejada, and players like Johnny Damon and Matt Stairs played themselves. \n"}]}
