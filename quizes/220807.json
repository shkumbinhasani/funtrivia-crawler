{"id": "220807", "name": "Kill Your Television Quiz | Psychology | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Psychology", "General Psychology"], "questions": [{"text": "A study from Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, released in 2004, found that children who watched TV between the ages of 1 and 3 were at an increased risk for what malady?", "correct": "Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)", "options": ["Severe emotional disturbance", "Schizophrenia", "Bipolar disorder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\n\tThe study, led by Dimitri Christakis, looked at children 7 years old and above, and found that each hour of TV watched per day  from ages 1-3 increased the risk of ADHD by 10% over the average at age 7. It didn't matter what programs the children were watching; all had the same effect. The most frightening  result of this study was that TV watching actually \"rewires\" the brains of children, by speeding up the pace of their perceptions, so that they expect everything to move fast and last only a short time, like a TV scene.Due to this study and others, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under age 2 watch no TV at all. \n"}, {"text": "Frederick J. Zimmerman of the University of Washington, Seattle studied the effects of parental emotional support, cognitive stimulation (such as reading to and interacting with the child) and  television watching on whether children grew up to be bullies. What did he find?", "correct": "That emotional and cognitive support helped keep kids from being bullies, but television watching overrode this help.", "options": ["That the more TV kids watched, the lazier they became, and thus were less likely to be bullies.", "That none of the three factors had an effect on future bullying", "That all TV watchers grew up to be bullies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat emotional and cognitive support helped keep kids from being bullies, but television watching overrode this help.\n\n\tThe study found that for every 4 hours that a 4 year old watched television, the future probability of bullying behavior grew by 25%. \n"}, {"text": "What beverage do characters drink most often on prime-time TV shows?", "correct": "Alcohol", "options": ["Coffee", "Water", "Soda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlcohol.\n\n\tA 1982 report from the Surgeon General of the US found that alcohol was consumed far more often than every other beverage- about 60% of all drinks seen- with tea/coffee far behind at about 30%.A 1990 study found that network TV showed about 8 alcoholic beverages per hour, that even the \"good guys\" drank heavily, and that the average teen has seen over 100,000 commercials touting booze. \n"}, {"text": "What is the official position of the American Psychological Association on the relationship between television viewing and violence?", "correct": "Violent programs on television lead to aggressive behavior by children and teenagers who watch those programs.", "options": ["Television viewing is a minor factor in the epidemic of violence in America", "Violent programs encourage violent behavior, peaceful programs encourage peaceful behavior", "There is no connection between violence on TV and violence in the real world"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViolent programs on television lead to aggressive behavior by children and teenagers who watch those programs.\n\n\tTheir position can be found at http://www.apa.org/pi/pii/vio&tv.html.\r In brief, they state that children who watch violence on TV become desensitized to real violence, become fearful of the real world, and are more apt to commit violent acts against others. \n"}, {"text": "Patti Valkenburg and Moniek Buijzen of the Amsterdam School of Communications Research conducted a study involving 2 year olds and TV. What surprising things did they find that 2 year olds could recognize easily, after seeing them on TV?", "correct": "Brand names", "options": ["Sesame Street characters", "Vegetables", "Letters of the alphabet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrand names.\n\n\tThe toddlers could recognize an average of 8 out of 12 brand names presented to them. The more TV that they had watched, the more brands they could recognize. The researchers pointed to the Teletubbies as the vanguard of the \"mass marketing to toddlers\" idea. \n"}, {"text": "Professor Neil Postman of New York University wrote an anti-television book called \"Amusing Ourselves to Death.\"  A quote from his book is \"It is implausible to imagine that anyone like... the multi-chinned, three-hundred pound_____________________, could be put forward as a presidential candidate in today's world. The shape of a man's body is largely irrelevant to the shape of his ideas when he is addressing a public in writing or on the radio . . . but it is quite relevant on television. The grossness of a three-hundred-pound image, even a talking one, would easily overwhelm any logical or spiritual subtleties conveyed by speech.\"  Who was he referring to?", "correct": "William Howard Taft", "options": ["Richard Nixon", "Herbert Hoover", "Theodore Roosevelt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Howard Taft.\n\n\tPostman was convinced that TV blunts our ability to judge a person not by appearance, but by words and actions. The cardboard characters of TV shows look perfect, even as they spew nonsense. By watching TV, we lose our ability to think critically. \n"}, {"text": "Studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the average teenager spent 6 1/2 hours per day watching television, videos, or DVDs. How much time per day did the average teen spend reading books?", "correct": "14 minutes", "options": ["Three hours", "An hour and a half", "Seven hours"], "explanation": "\n\n\n14 minutes.\n\n\tTime spent watching TV is, obviously, not time spent in activities that can truly engage the brain and body such as reading or interacting with friends. \n"}, {"text": "Many studies have focused on the increased violence found in children who watch TV. Have any studies shown that reducing TV watching time leads to a reduction in violence?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tFor example, Dr. Thomas Robinson studied schoolchildren in San Jose, CA. He divided the kids into two groups- one kept on watching TV as before; the other went through a 6-month program to decrease TV watching.  He found that children who reduced their TV watching by 25% over the course of the study were 25% less likely to be reported as aggressive, while those who continued to watch as much TV as before had no change in aggression levels.. \n"}, {"text": "Education professor and author Lawrence Kelemen stated, \"The television industry is not in the business of selling programs to audiences. It is in the business of...\"", "correct": "selling audiences to advertisers", "options": ["creating fun", "entertaining the masses", "educating people"], "explanation": "\n\n\nselling audiences to advertisers.\n\n\tTelevision exists as a medium to sell products. Essentially, it's all commercials. Your favorite show exists to mesmerize you while you listen to product spiels and view products onscreen. Without advertisers, there would be no TV (even PBS has those \"sponsor announcements.) \n"}, {"text": "A study by Harvard University and the Centers for Disease Control found that teenagers who watched 5 or more hours of television a day were six times more likely to acquire this habit than their peers who watched less than 2 hours of TV a day.", "correct": "Smoking", "options": ["Exercising regularly", "Reading for pleasure", "Writing in a journal daily"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmoking.\n\n\tThe study found that the more TV teens watched, the more likely they were to begin smoking.
