{"id": "338734", "name": "Carnival Atmosphere Online Quiz | History | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "Mixed Bag"], "questions": [{"text": "When I first arrived at my 300th quiz celebration, I decided to hop on the carousel.  But as I circled the center for the seventh time, horns went off to signal that the ride had broken.  This reminded me of something that happened in the Bible.  Men marched around the city, and the 7th time the walls of the city fell!  Where did men march around in circles, on horses, which, when you think about it, felt much like a carnival atmosphere?", "correct": "Jericho", "options": ["Jerusalem", "Jamaica", "Judah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJericho.\n\n\tIn the Bible, we can read about the account of when the walls of Jericho fell.  Men walked around the city's walls, six times every day.  On the seventh day, however, they walked around it seven times.  Horns were blown, and the walls came crashing down!  This is the same story as that of Rahab, who had a red rope hanging out the window so her home would not collapse with the rest of Jericho.\r This is what I was reminded of when I circled the carousel seven times, horns were blown, and the ride crashed.  How bizarre! \n"}, {"text": "Whenever I'm on a Ferris Wheel, I can't help but think of a giant bicycle.  I always feel as though I've been transported back in time, and I've found myself on a giant replica of Karl Drais' invention.  What was his first bicycle called?", "correct": "Dandy Horse", "options": ["Zippy Zebra", "Handy Mule", "Circle Donkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDandy Horse.\n\n\tKarl Drais invented the first bicycle, which was called the Laufmaschine, which was also called the dandy horse, the velocipede, or the running machine.  It was invented around 1820, in Germany, and was the first two-wheeled vehicle.\r Since each seat is meant for two people on this Ferris Wheel, I can't help but sing \"Bicycle Built For Two\" whenever I am rotating on one. \n"}, {"text": "During my 300th Quiz Extravaganza, I decided to play a little aiming game.  The goal of the game is to shoot a target, but you can't shoot too early, or the ball won't knock over the target, but you can't wait too long or the target will disappear and you will lose.  This reminds me of the famous quote \"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes\".  During which famous battle was this line uttered?", "correct": "Battle of Bunker Hill", "options": ["Battle at Gettysburg", "Battle of Lexington and Concord", "Battle of Bull Run"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBattle of Bunker Hill.\n\n\tThe Battle of Bunker Hill was a battle during the American Revolutionary War.  It took place on June 17, 1775.  It is also referred to as the Battle of Breed's Hill (since the actual battle took place mostly on Breed's Hill, not \"Bunker\" Hill).\r While waiting for the perfect time to shoot, I couldn't help but think to wait until I see the whites of their eyes (though the target did not have eyes). \n"}, {"text": "I see in the distance a ring toss booth, and so I get there quickly, as it is my favorite carnival game.  As I play, I can't help but recall a game very similar to it that was popular during the 19th century.  It is similar to horseshoes, but uses rings made of metal, rope, or rubber.  The goal was to throw the objects near a spike, and rules were very similar to a cross between ring toss and horseshoes.  What is this game called?", "correct": "Quoits", "options": ["Motts", "Hula hoop throws", "Jacks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuoits.\n\n\tQuoits was a very popular game, especially during the 19th century, but official rules were not created until 1881.  The game is played by throwing the rings towards a pin, which is also called the spike, the hob, or the mott.  Of course, getting the ring around the pin gave the most points, but, much like horseshoes, the closer the ring was to the stick the better you scored.  People still play quoits, but in the United States, it is often called \"ringtoss\" instead.  Sometimes there is more than one spike, as well, and you get more points depending on which spike you get the ring around.\r People gave me funny looks as I shouted out \"quoits, quoits\", every time I threw a ring. \n"}, {"text": "As I have a nice stroll around my 300th Quiz Party, I can't help but notice the milk bottle game where you have to throw a ball to knock them all down.  I quickly pass by, however, as I cannot bring myself to play it.  It always reminds me of the sad time when a plane was crashed into a building in just the right spot; so the entire tower fell to the ground.  In fact, both of the twin towers fell.  Where were these towers located, which fell on one fateful day in September of 2001?", "correct": "New York City", "options": ["Paris", "Kuala Lumpur", "Chicago"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York City.\n\n\tWhile there are twin towers called the Petronas Towers in Malaysia, it was not them that collapsed in 2001, killing thousands.  It was the Twin Towers in New York City which collapsed.  A terrorist attack on September 11 caused both towers to fall.  They were struck by planes, and this caused the structures to be weak enough that both of the buildings collapsed under their own weight.  It was a very tragic day to the lives of many people around the world.\r The milk bottle game always reminds me of this sad moment.  I had to look away as I walked by. \n"}, {"text": "Every time I go on the roller-coaster, I can't help but think of Japan.  Since I've been on the world's fastest train, the coaster just doesn't seem very fast to me anymore.  What is the name of the famous trains in Japan that set a world record in December 2003, when a three-car set travelled faster than any other train on the planet?", "correct": "Maglev", "options": ["Monorail", "Amtrak", "Quick Sub"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaglev.\n\n\tThe word \"Maglev\" combines the two words \"magnetic\" and \"levitation\", which is exactly how the Maglevs run.  These super fast trains run on a magnetic track, and \"levitate\" above the tracks.  Thus, there is no need for wheels on these high-speed trains.  The JR-Maglev set a new record in December 2003 as the fastest train in the world, beating the previous record by only 3.7 mph.  IA three-car set traveled at an incredible 361 miles per hour (581 kph).\r The world's faster roller coaster is even less than half of the world's fastest train.  The Formula Rossa roller coaster travels at almost 150 miles per hour.  So now when I'm on a roller coaster, I think \"you've got nothing on the JR-Maglev!\" \n"}, {"text": "I started getting a bit hungry after playing so many games, so I decided to go to the snack stand.  I grabbed a hot dog and a thing of cotton candy.  As I ate my delicious cotton candy, I couldn't help but think that it is called different things around the world.  I remember that it was first sold at the 1904 World Fair for 25 cents a pop!  It was also called something else then, before it was renamed to cotton candy.  What was it called when it was first sold in 1904 (it is still called this in Australia)?", "correct": "Fairy Floss", "options": ["Cotton Candy", "Candy Floss", "Buddhi ka Baal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFairy Floss.\n\n\tCotton candy was once known as fairy floss, until it was renamed in the 1920s.  Cotton candy is still called \"fairy floss\" in Australia, and is known as Buddhi ka Baal in India.  In the US and Canada, we call it cotton candy, and most other parts of the world know this delicious treat as candyfloss.\r Though William Morrison and John Wharton did not introduce cotton candy until 1904, they had actually invented it seven years earlier, in 1897!\r As I eat my Fluffy Stuff (flavor used by Tootsie Roll of Canada Ltd, the world's largest cotton candy manufacturer), I can't help but think that every December 7, the United States celebrates national cotton candy day! \n"}, {"text": "As I travel through the house of mirrors, I begin to lose where I even am.  I start running into mirrors and backtracking, and it takes me a good twenty minutes to navigate my way to the end of the maze.  I recall an ancient Greek story about Theseus, who traveled through one of these mazes, which was guarded by a mythical beast.  Now it's used as a spiritual journey, where once you get to the center your sins can be washed away, but in Greek times it was a deadly journey almost straight to the beast's stomach.  What was the beast?", "correct": "Minotaur", "options": ["Unicorn", "Centaur", "Rhinocopotamus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinotaur.\n\n\tThe minotaur was said to protect King Minos' labyrinth, known as Daedalus, on Knossos.  Theseus was given a skein of thread to help him find his way out of the labyrinth, and he hid a sword so he could kill the minotaur once he found the deadly beast.\r The term \"labyrinth\" actually is different than \"maze\", however.  A labyrinth only has one path to the middle, and one path back out again, so it is actually not difficult to navigate through a labyrinth.  Perhaps the Daedalus should be renamed \"King Minos' Maze of the Minotaur\".\r I finally made my way out of the house of mirrors.  I think I shall talk to management to see what they can do about hiding a fake minotaur somewhere within the maze.  It would have made it much more fun, in my opinion. \n"}, {"text": "I was yelled at when I tried to enter the funhouse backwards, but nothing could stop me from re-enacting one of my favorite scenes from one of my favorite musicals!  I kept singing the whole way through, until I found my way to the entrance.  People gave me funny looks when I said \"tell me about it ... stud.\"  But I continued on singing.\n\nIn what movie did the two main characters sing while going through a funhouse the wrong way?", "correct": "Grease", "options": ["The Music Man", "Singin' in the Rain", "The Sound of Music"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrease.\n\n\t\"Grease\" was released in 1978, and took place in the 1950s.  During the last scene of the movie, Danny (played by John Travolta) and Sandy (played by Olivia Newton-John) walked through a funhouse backwards.  They sang the song \"You're the One That I Want\" while going through the funhouse.\r And I, of course, had to sing the song while I traveled through the 300th Quiz Funhouse! \n"}, {"text": "As the 300th Quiz Party comes to a close, I decide to ride on one final ride.  It's one of my favorites; the teacups.  Every time I sit in one of the cups, I wish they would have filled it with tea.  I always laugh to myself, however.  I think, \"of course there's no tea ... it was all dumped in the harbor in 1773.\"\n\nWhere did this event take place?", "correct": "Boston", "options": ["Botany Bay", "Ellis Island", "Los Angeles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston.\n\n\tIn 1773, the Boston Tea Party took place.  Residents of Boston were furious with the British for placing such a high tax on tea that they decided to rebel.  They went onto the ships in Boston Harbor and dumped all the tea INTO the harbor!  Of course, that sparked all sorts of new problems, but that's another quiz!\r On second thought, maybe I'm glad that I'm not sloshing around in a cup full of tea while sitting in the teacups... \n"}]}
