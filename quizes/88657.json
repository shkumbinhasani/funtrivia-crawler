Scott Fitzgerald", "Dylan Thomas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson.\n\n\tPoe's life is as dramatic - and sad - as any life can be. Heavy drinking all his life - including a final binge - did him in. Fitzgerald - epitome of the \"jazz age\" - drank himself into an early grave. the same maybe fairly said about Thomas. It cannot, however, be said about Stevenson, who was in frail health for most of his life. \n"}, {"text": "All of the following died young - but, which of these writers/poets did NOT die in combat or while serving in the military in wartime?", "correct": "Stephen Crane", "options": ["Wilfred Owen", "Alan Seeger", "Rupert Brooke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStephen Crane.\n\n\tCrane wrote about combat (\"Red Badge of Courage\"), but died at age 28 of tuberculosis. Seeger wrote \"I Have A Rendezvous With Death\" - he was right. Owen was shot very shortly before the end of WW I.

An inspirational life, going from rags to heroic battles and associations with royalty. Unfortunately, a bitter end to her short life. Delusional - or in communication with Heaven? \n"}, {"text": "Heather O' Rourke, the child star of \"Poltergeist\", died at age 12.

Crane, poet of \"Brooklyn Bridge\" fame, jumped overboard while shipboard. Plath lived an equally short life - with an equally dramatic end to her life. Kafka's life was a struggle in many ways, but he did not end it via suicide. \n"}, {"text": "Mozart's short, stormy life has been well-documented (in \"Amadeus\", among other places).
