{"id": "223501", "name": "Hardest Chlorine Trivia Quiz | Chemistry | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Chemistry", "Specific Elements"], "questions": [{"text": "The name 'chlorine' comes from the Greek word khl\u00f4ros meaning:", "correct": "green", "options": ["odorous", "yellow", "poisonous"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngreen.\n\n\tIt is a greenish-yellow gas, combining directly with nearly all elements. \n"}, {"text": "Chlorine falls in the halogen group in the periodic table.  Halogen means:", "correct": "salt-forming", "options": ["hidden", "heavenly", "reactive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsalt-forming.\n\n\tIn nature it is found in the combined state only, chiefly with sodium as common salt (NaCl), carnallite, and sylvite. \n"}, {"text": "Chlorine is added to most public water supplies in order to minimize tooth decay.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tChlorine is added to most public water supplies, but in order to kill any microbes.  Fluorine, another halogen, is added to water in order to minimize tooth decay. \n"}, {"text": "Some tree frogs use a poisonous chlorine compound in their skin.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tTree frogs have a chlorine compound in their skin that is a very powerful pain killer, 200 times more potent than any known pain killer. When used in small doses, this compound has no side effects; in large doses, it is fatal. \n"}, {"text": "Carl Wilhelm Scheele, the 18th century scientist, discovered chlorine, but thought it was a compound containing this element:", "correct": "Oxygen", "options": ["Fluorine", "Hydrogen", "Helium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOxygen.\n\n\tDiscovered in 1774 by Scheele, who thought it contained oxygen. Chlorine was named in 1810 by Humphry Davy, who insisted it was an element. \n"}, {"text": "Chlorine gas escaping to the upper levels of the Earth's atmosphere destroys this important substance there.", "correct": "ozone", "options": ["water", "carbon dioxide", "nitrous oxide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nozone.\n\n\tOzone (O3) naturally protects the Earth from excess ultraviolet radiation.  Chlorine breaks up the ozone to let the radiation through, causing skin damage and cancer in humans and other animals. \n"}, {"text": "Chlorine was used as a chemical warfare weapon.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIt was used as a war gas in World War I. \n"}, {"text": "Chlorine is found in pure form at altitudes above 5000 ft. above sea level.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn nature it is found in the combined state only, chiefly with sodium as common salt (NaCl), carnallite, and sylvite. \n"}, {"text": "Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was NOT used in which of these?", "correct": "contact lens cleaning solutions", "options": ["fire extinguishers", "insect collecting", "refrigeration"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncontact lens cleaning solutions.\n\n\tCarbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a synthetic chemical compound formerly widely used in fire extinguishers and refrigeration, but now largely abandoned due to its toxicity.  It was also used in \"kill jars\" for insect collecting, utilizing its toxicity.  It was also used for dry cleaning. \n"}, {"text": "Industrial levels of chlorine are produced mainly by this method:", "correct": "electrolysis", "options": ["evaporation", "diffusion", "freeze-drying"], "explanation": "\n\n\nelectrolysis.\n\n\tThe three types of electrolysis used are mercury cell electrolysis, diaphragm cell electrolysis, and membrane cell electrolysis. \n"}]}
