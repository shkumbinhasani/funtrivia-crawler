{"id": "361823", "name": "A Life On The Ocean Wave 1 - Sea Safety Quiz | Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", " Sports Other", "Sailing"], "questions": [{"text": "Within the United Kingdom, the organisation charged with the overall governance of all aspects of sailing, boating and leisure water sports is known as the 'RNLI'.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe 'RNLI', or 'Royal National Lifeboat Institution', is a charitable organisation which provides rescue services to those who find themselves in difficulty or distress in the waters around the British Isles.  The national governing body for sailing within the United Kingdom is the 'Royal Yachting Association', commonly referred to as the 'RYA'.  The 'RYA' is the body that provides top quality sailing training and associated training courses for all those who wish to go to sea, whether in a leisure or commercial capacity, either under sail or under motor power. The organisation also provides training for those who wish to enjoy their leisure time on the extensive network of canals and other inland waterways. Although training is not compulsory, it would be foolish indeed to venture too far from the relative safety of inland and coastal waters with little or no training whatsoever!  Without the appropriate training from one organisation, you may well find yourself requiring the services of the other! \n"}, {"text": "The international maritime signal flag, the 'Blue Peter', can be described as which of the following?", "correct": "White square centred on a blue field", "options": ["Blue field with yellow bands top and bottom", "White saltire on a blue field", "Yellow field with black disc at centre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite square centred on a blue field.\n\n\tThe flag popularly known as 'Blue Peter' represents the letter 'P' when used to signify a letter in a message and, when used in isolation as a message in itself, it instructs crew members to report back to their vessel as it is about to go to sea.  When used by a vessel at sea, most often by fishing vessels, it is used to convey the message that the vessel has become snagged on an undersea obstruction. Of the other answers, the white saltire on a blue field represents the letter 'M' or 'Mike' and conveys the message that the vessel flying it has stopped, a flag consisting of a blue field with a single yellow stripe, top and bottom, represents the letter 'D' or 'Delta' and conveys the message that the vessel flying it is manoeuvring with difficulty and that other vessels should steer well clear. Finally, a yellow flag with a central black disc represents the letter 'I' or 'India' and conveys the message that the vessel flying it is changing its course to port. \n"}, {"text": "The large buoys used to denote a safe channel or passage for vessels into and out of a harbour, are painted in which of the following colours?", "correct": "Red and Green", "options": ["Black and Yellow", "Blue and White", "Red/White and Blue/White"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed and Green.\n\n\tWhen entering a harbour, these 'lateral marks' as they are known, must be kept green to starboard and red to port.  On leaving harbour, the green buoys must be kept to port and the red to starboard.  When navigating a channel, either leaving or entering a harbour, you must keep your vessel to your right hand side of the channel. Buoys that warn of danger, and many others, are standardised across the world.  However, in the system in use in the United States, the lateral mark system is reversed; on leaving a harbour the green lateral buoys must be kept to starboard, the red to port and vice versa on entering a harbour. The opening of a safe channel may also be indicated by a pillar buoy painted with alternating red/white vertical stripes. \n"}, {"text": "In navigational terms, what ecclesiastical name is given to the buoys placed relative to the four principal compass points that warn of danger?", "correct": "Cardinal marks", "options": ["Nun points", "Bishop sites", "Papal buoys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCardinal marks.\n\n\tA large 'cardinal mark' buoy is placed at each of the cardinal compass points around a major underwater hazard. \n"}, {"text": "In the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the officer, often a senior retired naval or merchant marine officer, charged with the smooth running of a port is known as the 'Marina Leader'? ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe Harbourmaster is an officer appointed by a local authority and charged with the responsibility of enforcing the regulations pertinent to his port and for maintaining good practice by mariners within the port and its environs.  Harbourmasters have varying levels of power, some individuals even having powers of arrest. In many of the major ports around the globe, a number of Harbourmasters will be employed with the overall control of the team being wielded by an officer with the title of Chief Harbourmaster.  In the United States the Harbourmaster, also known as the Captain of the Port, will invariably be a serving officer of the U.S. Coastguard Service and will hold the rank of Captain. \n"}, {"text": "As you sail into a peaceful cove you notice, to your front, a small boat displaying a flag, white at the hoist and blue at the fly.  What important message does this flag indicate to you?", "correct": "The flag for 'Diver Down'", "options": ["Fishing is taking place", "The boat requires assistance", "It is a naval training exercise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe flag for 'Diver Down'.\n\n\tThis swallowtail shaped flag, used mainly in Europe, signifies the letter 'A' or 'Alpha' and the message 'I have a diver down, please proceed slowly and steer well clear'.  In the United States and Canada a red flag with a white diagonal stripe is also used to indicate 'Diver Down'... Incidentally, a representation of this flag was used by rock band Van Halen on the cover of their 1982 album of the same name. \n"}, {"text": "Which two colours are used for their high contrasting qualities, in varying pattern combinations, on what are known as the 'cardinal mark' buoys that warn of major dangers to shipping? ", "correct": "Black and Yellow", "options": ["Blue and Yellow", "Red and White", "Green and Orange"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack and Yellow.\n\n\tBlack and yellow are used because of their high visible contrast with each other.  These pillar buoys, placed around a major hazard on each of the cardinal compass points, are very important for marine safety.  The buoys are positioned around the hazard as follows; to the north, the buoy is black over yellow, to the south it is yellow over black. The buoy to the east is coloured black overall with a yellow central band, and finally, the buoy to the west is painted yellow overall with black central band.  For example; if you were to approach a hazard from a westerly direction you would see a yellow buoy with a black central band immediately to your front, a buoy painted black over yellow to your port side, a buoy painted yellow over black to your starboard side and finally, a buoy painted black with a yellow central band in the distance. These buoys also carry a white light beacon at their top that display varying flash patterns during periods of darkness or poor visibility \n"}, {"text": "As you approach a small sailing vessel you notice a number of her crew on deck waving their arms across each other at you.  What should your reaction be to this signal?", "correct": "Be prepared to approach and offer assistance", "options": ["Keep away!  The vessel is about to explode!", "Nothing, they are simply being friendly", "Be aware of dolphins in the vicinity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBe prepared to approach and offer assistance.\n\n\tPersons waving their arms across their body are performing an internationally recognised signal that the crew are, or the vessel is, in distress.  On seeing this display, it may also be good practice to check any signal flags flying as these will give you an idea as to what the problem with the vessel might be. \n"}, {"text": "Up goes the cry... Man Overboard!  The correct drill, should a member of the crew or a passenger fall overboard, is that the skipper manoeuvres the boat around the person in ever decreasing circles until the boat is close enough to recover the person from the water.  Is that statement true or false?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAnyone wishing to venture out to sea should be aware of the drill that must be carried out should anyone fall into the sea.  After initially raising the alarm by shouting 'Man Overboard'!  The person that raised the alarm should throw a buoyancy aid, such as a lifebuoy or life-ring, to the person in the water. They should then point continuously at that person and must not allow themselves to become distracted for fear of losing sight of the person whilst preparations are made for their recovery.  The skipper should then manoeuvre the boat in a safe manner so as to come alongside the person and retrieve them using a line. It is always good practice to rescue someone from the water with a line rather than leaning over the side of the boat to pull them in... One person in the water is more than sufficient! \n"}, {"text": "Who or what is known as the 'Red Duster'?", "correct": "British merchant marine and civil ensign", "options": ["Comic superhero", "Former singer with US rock band 'Van Halen'", "Household cleaning implement"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBritish merchant marine and civil ensign.\n\n\tThe 'Red Duster' or 'Red Ensign' to give it its correct name is the ensign flown by vessels of the British Merchant Navy and by other commercial and civil vessels registered within the United Kingdom.  Similar patterns are also in use by the merchant marine services of many members of the Commonwealth.  It is believed that the 'Red Ensign' came into being during the early years of the 17th century and was initially used by the Royal Navy until its adoption of the current 'White Ensign' in 1864. \n"}]}
