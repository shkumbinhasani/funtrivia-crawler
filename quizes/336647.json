About one third of the population also emits methane which burns blue when lit.The site also admits that one in four people who attempt to light a fart are injured while doing so. Wikipedia also contains an article on the practice of lighting farts. I suspect that the vast majority of the members of The Royal Order of the Blue Flame are male, as they are usually a little more proud of their flatulence prowess.The \"pull my finger\" game almost always involves an adult male. This is just an observation and no disrespect is intended. \n"}, {"text": "\"Fart Proudly\" (1781) is the popular name of a notorious essay written by which of these famous men?", "correct": "Benjamin Franklin", "options": ["Francis Scott Key", "Meriwether Lewis", "Sir Walter Scott"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin.\n\n\t\"Fart Proudly\" is a lesser known writing that is attributed to Benjamin Franklin.
