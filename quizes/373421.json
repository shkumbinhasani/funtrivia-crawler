His debut for Ealing was playing the role of eight members of the D'Ascoyne family in the 1949 production of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets', although this was actually the fifth of the films generally considered comprising this series of comedies. His final film for the Ealing studio was 'Barnacle Bill' which was released in 1957 and in which he, again, played multiple roles. It was during 1957 that Guinness also received an Academy Award for his role in the film 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.  Guinness went on to appear in many more films and in a number of television series, most notably playing the role of George Smiley in two adaptations of works by John Le Carr\u00e9, 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' and 'Smiley's People'.  Perhaps his most famous character role was that of Obi-Wan-Kenobi in the 1977 film 'Star Wars' which although highly successful, was a franchise that he later came to detest. Sir Alec Guinness passed away after suffering from liver cancer on the 5th of August 2000 at the age of 86. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the factory in which Stratton is working at the beginning of the film?", "correct": "Corland Ltd", "options": ["Imperial Chemical Industries", "IKEA", "GlaxoSmithKline"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorland Ltd.\n\n\tIn the film's earlier scenes, the name Corland Ltd can be clearly seen on the outside of the mill building, especially in those scenes which the look across the town from Birnley's mill.  Stratton had been educated as a chemist at Cambridge University and had gained a first class honours degree and fellowship. It is never revealed how he had managed to infiltrate the research laboratory at the mill or indeed, how he had begun using the facilities to work on his experiments unbeknown to the laboratory management.  Unfortunately for Stratton, the sound made by his unusual experiment aroused the suspicions of the laboratory manager.It was also revealed during the subsequent investigation that he had been embezzling the funds with which to carry out his work.

At this point he was employed at Birnley's as a handyman, but his talents were noticed by the laboratory manager when he displayed an extensive knowledge of the microscope's component parts.He had also prevented the new equipment from being severely damaged through not being powered up in the correct sequence.  Asked if he could spare some time to help set the equipment up in the laboratory, Stratton agreed, realising that this was his chance to carry on with the work that had been curtailed when he had been compelled to leave his previous employer. \n"}, {"text": "Shortly after Stratton had been recognised by Daphne Birnley, he has a minor accident in which he is slightly injured.

After their encounter in the hallway, Stratton, who had also recognised Daphne, attempts to make a rapid escape but is pursued by her. Stratton realises that Daphne is likely to tell her father about him and decides to try to talk her out of doing so.  He eventually prevents her from leaving the mill and pleads with her to keep quiet for a day or two. Daphne refuses and speeds away in her sports car.  Desperate to prevent this, Stratton climbs onto the car only to be thrown clear as Daphne swerves suddenly in order to shake him off.  After returning to see if Stratton has been injured, they begin to talk and Daphne is intrigued at the work he is carrying out.  She decides, at this point, not to tell her father about Stratton's experiments. \n"}, {"text": "Daphne's father Alan, who is played by Cecil Parker, is surprised to find his daughter at home in the family library looking for something to read in bed that night.

On many occasions this leads to a huge explosion, another destroys the laboratory, resulting in another massive repair bill for the mill owner.

After being offered a quarter of a million pounds, Stratton realises that the powers-that-be have no intention whatsoever of allowing his fabric to go into production and so he makes his escape. After a short chase Stratton is surrounded in the mill's entrance foyer.  Stratton topples a bronze bust which, in turn, knocks a metal plaque off the wall above which hits him on the head and renders him unconscious. For his safety and to prevent him from revealing the secret of his new wonder material to the press, Stratton is cared for at the home of Alan Birnley, but the rebellious Daphne assists him in escaping from out of an upstairs window using a length of the new thread in the place of a rope.
