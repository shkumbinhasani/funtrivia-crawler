{"id": "369326", "name": "Dragon Ball - Tien Shinhan Saga Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Dragonball Z"], "questions": [{"text": "Master Shen is also known by which of these names?", "correct": "Crane Hermit", "options": ["Eagle Hermit", "Turtle Hermit", "Pig Hermit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrane Hermit.\n\n\tAs everyone makes their way to Papaya Island by different means, they inevitably all arrive in time for the World Martial Arts Tournament.  Krillin and Yamcha end up signing up upon showing up, but they discover that Goku hasn't arrived quite yet.  When the others aren't looking, Roshi also signs up as Jackie Chun, adding himself to the roster.\rTo Roshi's surprise, Master Shen also arrives with his two pupils: Chiaotzu and Tien Shinhan.  It's clear that the both have a rivalry.  Chiaotzu and Tien Shinhan also seem to have a past with Goku, having encountered him when they were traveling with Inoshikacho.\rWith less than five minutes to spare, Goku finally arrives and signs up before they all head out for a feast.\r It's not long before the tournament begins; soon, one hundred eighty-two participants are split into different brackets and asked to battle their way to the finals. \n"}, {"text": "Goku's first opponent in the preliminaries, King Choppa, achieved which of the following?", "correct": "He won a previous World Martial Arts Tournament", "options": ["He swam around the world", "He beat Master Roshi in battle", "He mastered the Kamehameha Wave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe won a previous World Martial Arts Tournament.\n\n\tThe battles begin and Goku's friends start making their way to the later stages, dispatching early foes quite easily.  Yamcha in particular shows great promise having mastered the After Image technique himself.  Krillin, likewise, proves too powerful for his opponent, even though he's much smaller in stature.  Master Roshi, fighting as Jackie Chun, only needs a few hits on his foe to proceed onward.\r Goku's first match turns out to be quite interesting; he's matched up against King Choppa, the winner of a previous tournament having succeeded without taking a single hit.  Goku defeats him without any problems.\r In addition to Goku and his pals, Master Shen's students also succeed, making it to the next round.  Tien Shinhan actually fights Goku's opponent from several years prior-- Nam-- hurting him badly. \n"}, {"text": "The battle between Tien and Yamcha ends with Yamcha breaking which body part?", "correct": "Leg", "options": ["Back", "Arm", "Shoulder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeg.\n\n\tAfter an eventful preliminary stretch, the final eight competitors are brought into the finals.  Of these battles (the match-ups of which were rigged by Master Crane's students), the first combines Tien Shinhan with Yamcha giving both a chance to show off their techniques.  When both find that they seem quite similar in terms of skill level, Yamcha decides to reveal his newest technique-- Wolf Fang Blowing Wind (named similar to his popular Wolf Fang Fist technique).  Unfortunately, the move doesn't work against Tien who proves much more formidable than he let on.  Yamcha ends up pulling another technique out of his bag-- the Kamehameha Wave-- but it too ends up being too weak. The fight ends when Tien breaks Yamcha's leg, pulling him from the battle, and tournament, by effective knock-out and letting Tien move into the quarterfinals. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Man-Wolf seek vengeance against Jackie Chun?", "correct": "Because Jackie destroyed the moon", "options": ["Because Jackie refused to mentor him", "Because his father was defeated by Jackie", "Because Jackie stepped on his tail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause Jackie destroyed the moon.\n\n\tThe second battle of the finals, following Yamcha and Tien, ends up being between Jackie Chun and Man-Wolf, a competitor who apparently has a beef with Jackie for destroying the moon three years earlier (during the World Martial Arts Tournament, specifically the final battle against Goku in his ape form).  The battle escalates to a point when Man-Wolf draws a knife and Jackie has to avoid getting cut by the blade. The fight finally ends when Jackie is able to convince Man-Wolf to revert back to human form...using Krillin's head as a substitute for the long-destroyed moon.  Jackie, of course, moves to the semifinals. \n"}, {"text": "How is Krillin able to defeat Chiaotzu?", "correct": "By getting him to solve a math problem", "options": ["Using the Kamehameha Wave", "Using the Dodon Ray", "Using his After Image technique"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy getting him to solve a math problem.\n\n\tThe third quarterfinal match ends up being between Krillin and Chiaotzu, and it becomes very apparent that the two are evenly matched, even when Chiaotzu reveals his ability to fly and fire Dodon Rays, just like Mercenary Tao, Master Shen's brother (and Goku mistakenly reveals that he killed Tao).  Krillin, trying to get the upper hand, ends up using After Images and, against all odds, the Kamehameha Wave (for the first time) to bring down his foe but finds himself paralyzed by Chiaotzu's mind powers. Krillin is able to win the battle by determining his enemy's weakness-- he needs to use his hands to use his powers. To finish the battle, Krillin convinces Chiaotzu to solve a math problem using his hands, and in this time Krillin forces him out of the ring. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Goku's quarterfinal opponent?", "correct": "Pomput", "options": ["Bacterian", "Nam", "Giran"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPomput.\n\n\tFollowing an assassination attempt on Goku's life the night before his quarterfinal fight (performed by the Crane Hermit for the death of his brother, Tao), Goku needs to face off against movie star Pomput in an attempt to reach the finals and fight...to the death...against Tien Shinhan.\rThe battle between Goku and Pomput follows the next day and, while others are concerned with Pomput's track record of winning every battle he's fought, Goku shows no fear.  In fact, his naivete almost makes him late for the match when Pomput's agents drive him out of town (though luckily Launch is able to help).  The match ends in a one-hit (well, three-hit) KO, sending Goku to the semi-finals. \n"}, {"text": "Which noteworthy competitor purposely leaves the ring during their battle?", "correct": "Jackie Chun", "options": ["Yamcha", "Krillin", "Goku"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJackie Chun.\n\n\tThe first semifinal match, as it seems, pairs up Jackie Chun (Master Roshi) and Tien Shinhan.  Before the battle even begins, Master Shen takes his pupils out to size up the competition, finding that their foe is masterful in many ways (though it seems that Roshi just gets lucky).  Finally, the two hit the arena in an intense battle in the ring (and in the sky), leading Jackie into a tiring bout with his mirror images (though Tien's third eye certainly helped).  Tien nearly knocks Jackie out more than once but the master bounces back in response. Tien uses his Solar Flare attack but, again, Jackie bounces back, avoiding the knockout. The battle only ends when Tien discovers Jackie's true identity (mainly when Master Shen tells him via telepathy), and, after Roshi's attempt to tell Tien of Shen's evil, a Kamehameha Wave is sent towards the audience.  Roshi deflects the beam and turns his back on the fight, leaving of his own volition. \n"}, {"text": "During the semifinals, Goku is paired up with which of his friends?", "correct": "Krillin", "options": ["Yamcha", "Nam", "Jackie Chun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKrillin.\n\n\tRoshi, after quitting, makes further efforts to get through to Tien who, as it seems, is swayed too much by the evil of Master Shen.  Roshi feels that Tien could be a heroic person if he could see through the lies.\r In the meantime, Goku and Krillin begin their fight, discovering that they're both worthy adversaries for one another...in their first-ever fight against each other.  Both show off new tricks (Krillin, for instance, can float) and each is able to fire the Kamehameha Wave at the other in the ring.  Krillin seems to get the upper hand by playing dirty and grabbing Goku's tail, but it's clear that the weakness is no longer an issue; Goku bounces back, knocking Krillin out of the ring with his speed (and near invisibility) and moving into the finals against Tien. \n"}, {"text": "Who ultimately becomes the winner of the World Martial Arts Tournament during this saga?", "correct": "Tien Shinhan", "options": ["Goku", "Krillin", "Jackie Chun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTien Shinhan.\n\n\tAs extensive battle breaks out in the arena for the final match as Tien Shinhan and Goku face off.  Both use some of their strongest moves-- Dodon Rays, Kamehameha Waves, After Images, Solar Flares-- and it seems that both are relatively well-matched.  Goku begins to use his full strength only to be held back unexpectedly; little does he know, Chiaotzu is using his psychic powers to freeze him from the crowd-- something obviously against the rules. Tien forces him to stop, only to come back full force and sprout two extra arms.  The battle continues and Tien uses a Tri-Beam Cannon attack to destroy the arena though Goku is able to dodge it.  Since Tien can fly the battle is virtually over, but Goku gets a final attack off that makes the finish a close one. Ultimately, Goku touches the ground first and Tien is declared the winner. \n"}, {"text": "After the World Martial Arts Tournament comes to an end, who is killed?", "correct": "Krillin", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKrillin.\n\n\tTien seems to have a change of heart and offers half of his winnings to Goku for his efforts though the boy refuses.  One thing he can't refuse, however, is dinner on Tien, so everyone heads out to celebrate the end of the tournament.  When Goku realizes that he forgot his Dragon Ball and Power Pole back at the arena, Krillin kindly offers to pick it up for him and meet later.  When Krillin doesn't return, the others investigate only to find that he's been murdered in cold blood and the Dragon Ball and a list of competitors from the tournament has been stolen. \n"}]}
