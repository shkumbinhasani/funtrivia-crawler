{"id": "332445", "name": "\"Journey to Regionals\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Principal Figgins is powerless in removing Sue from the Show Choir Regionals judging panel.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhen Will puts up posters in the school supporting the kids' attendance at the show choir Regionals, Sue informs him that she'll be seeing him on Saturday; she's one of the judges for the kids' competition.  Will goes to Figgins asking for help, but Figgins can't do anything about it as the show choir board has made up their minds.  He simply warns Will that the club will be disbanded as per their arrangement if they don't place at the competition, and to do that they'll need to wow Sue.  Sue sarcastically wishes him luck.\rIn a flashback, Puck and Quinn spend the night together.  Although Quinn is extremely hesitant, Puck convinces her everything will be fine.  She trusts him. \n"}, {"text": "Emma reveals that she has been dating which of these people?", "correct": "Her dentist", "options": ["Her boss", "Her therapist", "Her ex-boyfriend"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer dentist.\n\n\tOn one night, the kids gather at Will's apartment for pizza and their setlist nominations and Will discovers that no one is enthused about Regionals- all of them know that Sue is planning to vote against them (the Cheerios note that she specifically said she would).  Tina starts crying; she loves them all and she never had friends before she came to Glee Club.  They all fear that it may be the end of something that made them special.  Rachel, in tears, asks Will if they can go around the room and talk about what they'll miss about Glee Club instead of choosing their songs.\rThe next day, Will goes to Emma for guidance and she reminds him of how he felt during Nationals in his high school days.  He needs to remind them that Glee makes them feel good, and they should do it for that.  He says that he misses her, but Emma reveals that she has been dating Carl Howell, her dentist. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Will determine that New Directions should perform songs by Journey?", "correct": "In his car", "options": ["In the grocery store", "In Emma's office", "In the choir room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn his car.\n\n\tDriving home from school, Will turns on the radio to hear Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin', the song that brought him back to Glee Club in the very first episode of the show.  He pulls over to the side of the road to cry.\rAt school, Finn and Rachel realize that they need to pull it all together.  Finn reminds Rachel that she's their leader and she kisses him.  Finding Will in the choir room with the others, they're told to sit down while Will reminds them that one day they'll all be gone from McKinley.  In the future, Glee will be nothing but a memory, but they need to make the most of what they have because the journey has been so much fun.  Will informs them that they will be performing a Journey medley and everyone agrees with the idea. \n"}, {"text": "Who of these is not one of the judges at Regionals?", "correct": "Gwyneth Paltrow", "options": ["Josh Groban", "Olivia Newton-John", "Rod Remmington"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGwyneth Paltrow.\n\n\tAlthough all three are introduced at the beginning of the Regionals ceremony, Sue, surprisingly, receives the most applause from the crowd.  Olivia Newton-John, Josh Groban, and Rod Remmington all appeared in previous episodes while Gwyneth Paltrow would not appear until season 2.\rWhen Will takes his seat in the crowd, the first Glee club, Aural Intensity, performs their mash-up of Josh Groban's \"You Raise Me Up\" and Olivia Newton-John's \"Magic\".  The kids in New Directions are frustrated by this clear attempt to get the judges' attention.  While they're discouraged, they remain optimistic with Will's guiding words.  Soon enough, it's showtime. \n"}, {"text": "Which singer from New Directions is the first to perform a line during their Regionals Journey medley?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Rachel", "Mercedes", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tBoth Finn and Rachel wait to emerge for their performance from behind the doors at the top of the auditorium (as they're beginning like Rachel had done with \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" in \"Sectionals\").  Before they start, Finn walks up to Rachel and says he loves her.  As the music begins, he's the first to reach through the door and begin his ballad/duet performance to \"Faithfully\".  As they make their way to the stage, the curtain rises to show the rest of the members of New Directions and they finish their song only to move into a mash-up of \"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\" and \"Any Way You Want It\".  The crowd is already on their feet as the club performs their new and improved, 10/10 version of \"Don't Stop Believin'\" (with Puck and Santana surprisingly taking on some of the lines).  As they finish their medley, the crowd cheers in a standing ovation and the kids are amazed. \n"}, {"text": "Who is in the delivery room with Quinn when she has the baby?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Her father", "Rachel", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tThe kids are confident that they've pulled off a winning number and head backstage where Quinn finds her mother waiting.  Surprised, Quinn asks why she's there (as they haven't seen each other since she was kicked out of her house).  Her mother replies that she caught her father cheating and kicked him out; now she wants her daughter back.  As the two talk, Quinn's water breaks and she's forced to rush to the hospital.\rAs Quinn heads to the delivery room, she asks Puck and Mercedes to be with her through labour.  The rest of New Directions waits in the hospital waiting room for the good news, but Rachel stays behind at Regionals to watch Jesse and Vocal Adrenaline perform \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. \n"}, {"text": "Rod Remmington, according to his own story, once partied with which rock star?", "correct": "Freddie Mercury", "options": ["Geddy Lee", "Mick Jagger", "Paul McCartney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreddie Mercury.\n\n\tRachel finds Shelby in a waiting room to congratulate her, but let her know that New Direction would be winning because they have heart.  She asks Shelby to co-direct at McKinley since there's so much she can teach her.  Shelby says she can't do it anymore- she wants a life, and meeting Rachel has taught her that.  When Shelby asks where the rest of the team is, she says that they're at the hospital.  Quinn had a baby girl.\rIn the judging room, Sue lets the others know that she has a strong urge to vote a particular team to third place and that she doesn't care if the others get first or second.  As they begin discussing their plans, Newton-John, Remmington, and Grobin gang up on Sue saying that the kids in New Directions were blatant, too token, too poor (judging by their costumes) and didn't immortalize them in song.  They say that Sue is just as hopeless as they are; none of them have talent and none will be celebrities like they are. \n"}, {"text": "Does New Directions place at Regionals?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAll three teams make their way to the stage to hear the final results and Sue reveals the winners beginning with the runners-up, Aural Intensity.  The moment of truth finally happens and it's none other than...VOCAL ADRENALINE.  The kids from Carmel High School embrace as they take home another championship victory and move on to Nationals while the kids in New Directions are clearly disappointed.  They didn't even place, and Figgins will have no choice but to disband them.\rAt the hospital, Puck and Quinn watch over the baby and Puck asks if they should keep her.  She doesn't want to and Puck says he loves her.  Shelby arrives at the hospital to visit the baby and Puck says that her name is Beth.  She likes that name. \n"}, {"text": "Who did Sue vote for to win Regionals?", "correct": "New Directions", "options": ["Vocal Adrenaline", "Aural Intensity", "Herself"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Directions.\n\n\tAt school the following week, Will finds Emma and Figgins arguing in the principal's office and discovers that their quarrel was about Glee.  Emma is furious that Sue caused them to have New Directions taken away.  The kids worked too hard and Sue cheated to get money for the Cheerios.  Will argues that the argument is about the two of them too because some things are worth fighting for and he loves her, dentist or not.  They kiss as Rachel asks if he can come to the auditorium.\rThe kids sit in a semicircle on the stage and begin to tell Will what Glee meant to them.  Most of all, they're appreciative because Will is Glee, and Glee will never die because it's inside all of them.  They won because they had him as a leader.  They lead their way into a rendition of Lulu's \"To Sir, With Love\" while Sue watches unseen from the sidelines.\rAs Will packs up the choir room, Sue comes in to gloat a bit.  Will congratulates her for 'winning', but asks her why they couldn't, at the least, have beaten Aural Intensity.  Sue says she won't betray her oath as a judge, but that she did cast her vote based on how she felt about the performances.\rAlthough it's unlikely that the other judges did the same, Sue voted for New Directions as the best candidate. \n"}, {"text": "Who performs \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" with Will at the end of the episode?", "correct": "Puck", "options": ["Rachel", "Quinn", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuck.\n\n\tSue says that she thinks Will is heartless, and she may very well be, but she doesn't want to live in a place where she doesn't have some sort of friendly (or not) competition.  She's proven that she can wipe Glee club off the map.  So she talked to Figgins.  The sexual blackmail she held over Figgins' head to get her job back in \"Hell-O\" is now null and void to give New Directions another year at McKinley to turn things around.  Will is shocked.  Sue explains that while she doesn't like him much, she admires the work that he does for the kids; he's a good teacher.  They shake hands at the thought of another competitive year.\rWill gathers the kids into the choir room and tells them the good news much to everyone's shock and delight.  The kids are amazed and Rachel suggests that they get to work right away on next year's setlist, but Will urges them to enjoy their summer because they earned it.\rWill decides to reward them with his own song dedicated to all of them since they performed in the auditorium in his honour.  He asks Puck to accompany him as they play \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\".  At the hospital, Shelby adopts Beth and starts to build her family.  The kids in the choir room smile and express their friendship as their first year as New Directions comes to an end. \n"}]}
