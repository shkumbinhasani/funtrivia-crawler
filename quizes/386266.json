The difference between roundabouts and traffic circles is the way in which you enter them. When entering a roundabout, drivers only have to yield to vehicles already in the roundabout before proceeding. Traffic circles tend to be larger and the circle intersects roads around it with stop signs or traffic lights. Some famous traffic circles include around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and ones throughout Washington, D.C. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these candy bars is well known for its triangular prism package?", "correct": "Toblerone", "options": ["Milky Way", "M&Ms", "Skittles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToblerone.\n\n\tTheodor Tobler created the triangular milk chocolate with almond nougat in 1908 in Bern, Switzerland. The triangular shape that inspired the design is disputed. While the Matterhorn mountain is more common thought, Tobler's sons say the human pyramid that Tobler saw at a Paris cabaret show inspired him. The Tobler company produced Toblerone bars independently for sixty years before merging with European chocolate company Suchard in 1970, and later with Kraft Foods. \r Toblerones have been controversial, too. In 1995, a Swedish politician had to resign as candidate for Prime Minister after it was revealed she bought two Toblerones with her government credit card. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these pieces of sports equipment is a pentagon?", "correct": "Home plate (baseball)", "options": ["Ice hockey puck", "Badminton racket", "Bowling pin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHome plate (baseball).\n\n\tThe five sides on home plate are not of equal length and the home plate appears to have a rectangular front (17 inches by 8 inches) with triangular back (12 inches). Home plate is made of rubber. In the game of baseball, runs are scored when a player is able to make it around the bases and touch home plate, making it a very important feature on the field. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these things has cylinders?", "correct": "An engine", "options": ["An oven", "A brain", "A guitar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn engine.\n\n\tInside a cylinder (a long shape with a circular cross-section, like a pipe) in an engine is where the piston moves up and down, generating the energy to make the engine run. Most engines are classified based on how many cylinders they have. Lawn mowers have just one cylinder, and cars have either four, six or eight cylinders depending on their use. Cars built for faster speeds have more cylinders. \n"}, {"text": "Honeybees store their honey and pollen in honeycombs within their hives. Each of these storage spaces is which shape?", "correct": "Hexagon", "options": ["Oval", "Rectangle", "Diamond"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHexagon.\n\n\tScientists believe that honeybees can calculate angles just like humans can. A pattern of hexagons maximizes the space within the beehive for storing nectar and honey, and leaves no wasted space. Each of these individual cells in the hive are built using wax, and hexagons allow for the least amount of wax needed to build the grid.Scientists believe bees experimented with shapes in their hives before settling on hexagon patterns, and have passed that knowledge along. The hexagon patterns have been around for a long time; Marcus Terentius Varro studied the hexagons in beehives as early as 36 BC!  \n"}, {"text": "Octagons are most noticeable in everyday life as stop signs, but which of these items from around the house is also commonly an octagon shape?", "correct": "Umbrella", "options": ["Bar of Soap", "Toaster", "Pillow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUmbrella.\n\n\tDid you know that National Umbrella Day is on February 10 each year? The first recorded use of a collapsible umbrella was in 21 AD in China. As well as deflecting rain away from you outside, specialized umbrellas are used by photographers to reflect light towards you inside, when taking portraits. Around the world, octagons appear in different situations such as the city blocks of Barcelona (although all sides of those octagons are not equal), and many Japanese lottery machines. \n"}, {"text": "Polygons can have any number of edges. How many edges does a megagon have?", "correct": "1,000,000", "options": ["100", "50", "1000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1,000,000.\n\n\t\"Mega\" comes from the Greek word for great. If all sides on the megagon were the same size, the shape would be too similar to a circle that you would not be able to notice the difference, even if the megagon was the size of the Earth! Famous French philosopher Rene Descartes used megagons to argue on defined objects that are visually difficult to see. A hectogon has 100 sides, a chiliagon has 1000 edges and a myriagon has 10,000 edges. \n"}, {"text": "The three interior angles of a triangle add to how many degrees?", "correct": "180", "options": ["360", "720", "1000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n180.\n\n\tAn equilateral triangle is where the three angles each measure at 60\u00b0. A right triangle is where one of the three angles measures in at 90\u00b0. All polygons have specific measurements in which interior angles must add to, depending on the amount of edges they have. For four sided polygons, edges must add to 360\u00b0, five sides shapes to 540\u00b0, and six sided polygons to 720\u00b0. \n"}, {"text": "What country would be the best place to travel to if I wanted to see a pyramid? ", "correct": "Egypt", "options": ["Australia", "Brazil", "Germany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEgypt.\n\n\tThere are about 80 pyramids throughout Egypt, and the largest is in Giza.  The Pyramid of Khufu at Giza is the only of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing. The Pyramid of Djoser is the oldest of the pyramids, built around 2670 BC! All Egyptian pyramids were built on the west bank of the Nile River, as that side was associated with the dead because that was where the sun would set. The construction of pyramids using large stones without modern technology has been a matter of wonder for many researchers today. \n"}, {"text": "Cubes are the basis for which computer games?", "correct": "Minecraft", "options": ["Pac-Man", "World of Warcraft", "League of Legends"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinecraft.\n\n\tMinecraft is referred to as a \"sandbox computer game\", as there are no strict gameplay or storyline where the player decides what they want to do. The game was created by Markus Persson and released in 2011. By 2017, it had become the second highest selling video game of all-time, behind only Tetris. The game is based on blocks, fitting into a fixed grid system in a three dimensional world. Players have two options for game play - Creative allows you to build and play with unlimited resources and Survival makes you scavenge for resources. \n"}]}
