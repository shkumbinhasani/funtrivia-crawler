{"id": "222056", "name": "Awful, Awful, Awful: The Worst Movie Villains Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Movie Villains"], "questions": [{"text": "Which actor, perhaps most well-known for his delightfully ridiculous comical stylings on TV's 'Third Rock from the Sun', has seen his share of villainous roles, namely as Earl Blake in 'Ricochet', Eric Qualen in 'Cliffhanger' and the diabolical Cain in 'Raising Cain'?", "correct": "John Lithgow", "options": ["John Voight", "William Shatner", "Ted Danson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Lithgow.\n\n\tWhen one thinks John Lithgow, the words 'funny' or 'loveable' or 'sweet' may come to mind, but he also has a wicked side.  In the early 1990s, Lithgow did such a good job with his villainous role as Earl Blake in 'Ricochet' that he became somewhat typecast as a baddie.  Perhaps casting agents recognized Lithgow's sinister side in his performance as the stubborn and intolerant Reverend Shaw Moore in 'Footloose' and decided to further cultivate his evil subconscious? \n"}, {"text": "One of the most eccentrically, freewheeling evil performances of all time was submitted by Michael Madsen in the Quentin Tarantino-directed film 'Reservoir Dogs'.  What was Madsen's codename in the film?", "correct": "Mr. Blonde", "options": ["Mr. Orange", "Mr. Pink", "Mr. Purple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Blonde\n\n\tMadsen has made a career playing the heavy, and it probably all started with his 1992 performance as the completely reckless and amoral Mr. Blonde in 'Reservoir Dogs'.  In the film, he tortures a cop for fun, cutting off his ear in the process.  The off-the-camera antics of Mr. Blonde are also discussed, including an indiscriminate shooting rampage in which everyone from police to innocent civilians fall victim.  He's not the kind of guy I'd like to have over for dinner. \n"}, {"text": "In 'The Usual Suspects', Kevin Spacey plays the lead role as a seemingly harmless con artist named Roger Kint, who is compelled to join a ruthless gang of criminals by a mysterious lawyer (or so it seems).  What is Roger Kint's nickname?", "correct": "Verbal", "options": ["Happy", "Smooth", "Insatiable"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVerbal.\n\n\tRoger 'Verbal' Kint may seem harmless, but perhaps there is much more than meets the eye with this smooth-talker who has a memory like a steel trap.  If Kint doesn't cut the trick in terms of scary, perhaps we can talk about the mysterious Keyser Soze, hmm? \n"}, {"text": "In the movies, no single character has been more violently ruthless and more gratuitously abusive of the four-letter word than Tony Montana.  In which film does Mr. Montana set the absolute standard for utterers of obscenity everywhere?", "correct": "Scarface", "options": ["Raging Bull", "Goodfellas", "The Deer Hunter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScarface.\n\n\tAl Pacino is Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant who makes it big the old fashioned way, he creates his own drug empire.  Montana finds ample time to wade through mountains of cocaine, while at the same time introducing his drug-dealing enemies to his 'little friend'.  If I had to hire a baby sitter, Mr. Montana would probably be the last person out of about six billion that I would have on my list. \n"}, {"text": "Do you want the truth?  The truth is, no discussion of movie villains would be complete without mentioning the character played by Jack Nicholson in the film 'A Few Good Men'.  What is the name of this marine colonel who seemingly runs his base using his own unique set of rules and standards?", "correct": "Nathan Jessup", "options": ["Daniel Kaffee", "Jonathan Kendrick", "Jack Ross"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNathan Jessup.\n\n\tYes, that Colonel Nathan R. Jessup is quite the fellow.  The future of the free world literally rides on his every decision, or so he likes to believe.  When a young Marine private dies under his jurisdiction, Colonel Jessup believes he can sweep it under the rug.  \r To suggest that Nicholson stole the show in 'A Few Good Men' with his intimidating performance as the megalomaniacal Jessup would be the epitome of understatement. \n"}, {"text": "Is there anything more frightening than to know that the police, people with whom we entrust our very lives, are corrupt beyond measure?  Such is the case with Alonzo Harris, the character played by Denzel Washington in which 2001 film that explores the seedier side of law enforcement?", "correct": "Training Day", "options": ["L. A. Confidential", "The Negotiator", "Exit Wounds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTraining Day.\n\n\tDenzel Washington has spent his career playing the good guy, but in 'Training Day' his character is anything but 'good'.  He plays a ruthless narcotics officer named Alonzo Harris who takes on a green recruit (played by Ethan Hawke), proceeding to explain to the younger officer the (dirty) tricks of the trade.  Eventually it becomes clear that Alonzo has deeply involved himself in the crime networks that plague his city, deeply enough that he is either unwilling or unable to extricate himself from the corruption. \n"}, {"text": "If this woman doesn't scare you, no evil thing will.  She is the wicked villain who sees a beautiful, cute little puppy as having only one purpose, giving up its skin.  What is the name of this virago of the various versions of '101 Dalmatians'?", "correct": "Cruella De Vil", "options": ["Medusa", "Agnes Dipesto", "Lily von Schtupp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCruella De Vil.\n\n\tCruella De Vil was frighteningly voiced by Betty Lou Gerson in the original animated Disney classic from 1961.  The demonic Ms De Vil was later made creepy flesh and crawly blood by actress Glenn Close, in the 1996 live action version. \n"}, {"text": "Now for the utterly silly.  Villains aren't always completely vile and scary, some are actually amusing in a twisted way.  Take this man, the chief nemesis of Austin Powers in the 1997 movie 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery', for instance.  He finds a way to be completely execrable, but at the same time strangely charming.  What is his name?", "correct": "Dr. Evil", "options": ["Dr. Petulant", "Dr. Sin", "Dr. Malice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Evil\n\n\tMike Myers gives a tour de force performance in the original 'Austin Powers' movie, playing both the title role of Austin Powers, a shagadelic British agent who is stuck in the mid-1960s, and his counterpart, the vile, vice-ridden, valueless, but otherwise vivacious Dr. Evil. \n"}, {"text": "Artificial intelligence...the mere concept is frightening to contemplate.  Of course, in virtually every instance where AI is introduced in film, something goes terribly awry.  The prime example of this is HAL 9000, a beastly computer who pits himself against the men who occupy the spaceship he controls.  Who masterfully directs HAL 9000 in his greatest performance in '2001: A Space Odyssey'?", "correct": "Stanley Kubrick", "options": ["Sidney Pollack", "Sidney Lumet", "Stanley Donen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStanley Kubrick.\n\n\tWell, at least we knew it had to be a 'Stanley' or a 'Sidney'.  \r Douglas Rain provides the eerily soothing voice of HAL 9000 in the film, which is based on the story 'The Sentinel' by Arthur C. Clarke.  Rain makes another voice appearance in the 1984 sequel entitled '2010', but in that film HAL isn't quite so scary. \n"}, {"text": "The 1992 mockumentary-style film 'Bob Roberts' features a spooky performance. Which actor portrays the title character, an almost fascist politician who will stoop to any level to get elected as senator of his state?", "correct": "Tim Robbins", "options": ["Sean Penn", "Kevin Costner", "Tom Cruise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTim Robbins.\n\n\tThough Bob Roberts is supposed to be an extreme right wing politician in this film, one can imagine the underhanded and completely amoral techniques he uses, being employed by politicians at either juncture on the political spectrum.  If politicians can be this corrupt, who will protect the little guy?\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
