What does she do to their catch?", "correct": "Brings it back to life", "options": ["Frees it behind their back", "Nothing; she is their catch", "Transforms it into a man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrings it back to life.\n\n\tOut in the swamps of Louisiana, two alligator hunters find a catch and put it down with a bullet to the head.  They return to their camp with the animal with the intent of hanging it up and skinning it, but when they arrive they find a woman, Misty Day, previously burned at the stake, walking around the edges of the woods. She tells them that what they're doing is all wrong; they're killing God's innocent creatures.  One of the hunters draws a gun on her before she uses her power of resurgence to bring life back to the gators.  Both hunters are killed; she watches one get pulled into the water. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Fiona hide Mme. LaLaurie upon finding her buried, but alive, in New Orleans?", "correct": "Her bedroom", "options": ["The attic", "The garage", "A hotel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer bedroom.\n\n\tCordelia wakes the girls of Miss Robichaux's for their morning gathering.  Madison and Zoe are already awake; Zoe in particular is fretting over Kyle's death from a few days earlier.  Madison tells her to stop looking into it-- because of what they did it's guilt by association anyways (despite his valiant attempt to stop his frat brothers).  Zoe won't accept that idea.\rCordelia tells Fiona to join the girls for their gathering and, coming up to her door, notices an awful smell.  Fiona agrees to join, but has to keep a tied-up Delphine LaLaurie hidden away.  LaLaurie screams, but Fiona is quick to shut her back up, asking her how she remained alive after so many years. \n"}, {"text": "Which city is Queenie from?", "correct": "Detroit", "options": ["New York", "Chicago", "Los Angeles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDetroit.\n\n\tQueenie once worked at a fast food chicken restaurant in Detroit, and in 2012 she grabbed Cordelia's attention when she made the news for burning a man's arm.  Little did most know, she did so by sticking her own hand into a deep fryer and transferring the pain.  Queenie was initially against coming to New Orleans but she ultimately did, being an heir of the Salem witch Tituba, the first woman to be accused of witchcraft.  Cordelia tells them that they need to take care of each other to protect themselves before two homicide detectives are let in.  They need to speak to Madison and Zoe.\rThe detectives know Madison was at the party involving the crash and question her about the event.  Zoe, however, is also involved-- she went to the hospital and the boy she saw died shortly after in the same circumstances as her boyfriend back home.  Zoe spills everything to them before Fiona has to come in and erase the detectives' memories.  After dispatching the detectives, she gives the girls a talking to. \n"}, {"text": "Cordelia initially refuses to use dark magic to spurn her pregnancy.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMadison, doing Zoe a favour, takes her on a ride to the local morgue.  Breaking in (with Madison's lockpick), she reveals that she stole a resurrection spell from Cordelia's stash and they'll be able to bring Kyle back to life.  The remains that they find of him, however, is piecemeal-- he and several of the other boys are nothing but severed limbs and body parts.  Madison looks at this with optimism; they can build the perfect boyfriend.\rCordelia and her husband, Hank, visit the doctor to determine whether or not she can get pregnant; they've been trying for a year.  She refuses to use dark magic to give them a child.  Hank is more inclined. \n"}, {"text": "What happened to Mme. LaLaurie's daughters nearly two centuries ago?", "correct": "They were hanged", "options": ["They were burned at the stake", "They were attacked by a minotaur", "They ran away"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey were hanged.\n\n\tFiona heads up to Delphine with some chicken and tries to get the word out of her about her immortality; she'd been in the ground for one hundred eighty years.  She reveals that she was tricked by none other than Marie Laveau.  Waking up from her alleged love potion, she walked outside to find Laveau and a mob.  The crowd had hanged her daughters from the front balcony.  While LaLaurie wept in mourning, Laveau told her that she gave her immortality and that she would spend her days buried under the streets of New Orleans, alone, listening to the world go by around her. \n"}, {"text": "Whose blood is given during the resurrection ritual at the morgue?", "correct": "Zoe's", "options": ["Fiona's", "Madison's", "Misty's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZoe's.\n\n\tWith all of the parts accumulated, Zoe and Madison set out to sew Kyle back together and light the candles needed for their ritual.  The girls, ready to go, breathed in their magical smoke and called forth the evils of dark magic, giving Zoe's blood as a catalyst while they both chanted the Latin on the parchment.  When the lightning and smoke died down, it seems as though nothing really happens.  Madison heads out to the car while Zoe stays behind to apologize to the dead boy.  Unfortunately, while Madison is outside, a car pulls up and she decides to hightail it out of the area.  Inside, Zoe gives Kyle a kiss and, somewhere in the bayou, Misty Day feels an energy.\rWhile Zoe hides away, the mortician comes in and immediately knows something is wrong.  When he turns his back on the slab, Kyle rises from the dead and beats the man in front of him. \n"}, {"text": "Fiona discovers that Marie Laveau is operating which of the following in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans?", "correct": "Hair salon", "options": ["Tourist trap", "Starbucks", "Palm reading shop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHair salon.\n\n\tBack at Miss Robichaux's, Nan can't get the voices out of her head.  Frustrated by all of the noise, she heads to Fiona's room and finds Mme. LaLaurie in the closet.  When she unties her, she makes her escape, knocking out Queenie (who looks to be a slave) with a candlestick.\rFiona heads to a rough neighbourhood of New Orleans to find the answers she's looking for, specifically in a hair salon run by the still-youthful Marie Laveau.  Fiona asks for her secret, point-blank, and Laveau doesn't let it go.  Both of them discuss the importance of Tituba to their ancestry but have to agree that they're nothing more than enemies.  Fiona is only there to get the secret behind immortality, and now that she has an ace up her sleeve she plans to get it. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Misty appear to Zoe?", "correct": "In the back seat of a stolen car", "options": ["In the swamp", "In prison", "On a streetcar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the back seat of a stolen car.\n\n\tCordelia ultimately attempts to use her magic to enhance her fertility.  Out in her greenhouse she mixes together her components and unearths a large egg to be used during their ritual.  Using fire, black candles, chants, and blood, Cordelia and Hank enact that which is required of them.  The circle erupts in fire while the eggs burst open with snakes.\rAt the morgue, Zoe tries to lead Kyle outside; they get into the mortician's car and head down the freeway while Kyle acclimatize to his new body.  Misty rises from the back seat and gives her some directions. \n"}, {"text": "Misty reveals that she's a fan of which musician?", "correct": "Stevie Nicks", "options": ["Cher", "Wynonna Judd", "Ke$ha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStevie Nicks.\n\n\tMisty ends up leading Zoe to her shack in the bayou where she and Kyle can hide away.  She uses some healing mud to fix Kyle's sewn-up wounds and tells Zoe that during her meditative walk through the woods, she felt something that got her heart racing.  She knew she had to follow it and what she found was Zoe, using healing magic to bring Kyle back from the dead. Now she's not alone.  When she turns up some Fleetwood Mac, Zoe asks who's singing-- it's Stevie Nicks, a woman Misty claims is a 'white witch', perhaps the only witch she's ever known otherwise.  Zoe claims that she has to go; Misty allows Kyle to stay to heal. When Zoe comes back he'll be as good as new.  She promises she'll come back. \n"}, {"text": "When LaLaurie escapes the academy where does she go?", "correct": "Her old house", "options": ["She doesn't make it past the gate", "A pub", "The bus station"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer old house.\n\n\tMarie Laveau, heading into the back of her salon, unshackles a great beast from his chains.  She tells Bastien, her reanimated minotaur, that they have some great business to attend to.\rWalking down the street to LaLaurie's mansion, Fiona spies her no-longer-captive, immortal chess piece sitting on a bench, wallowing in misery.  LaLaurie is disappointed that her mansion is now a historical site but Fiona claims that if she did a small fraction of the horrible things she allegedly did, she deserved every punishment.  LaLaurie says that Hell is real; in the box she only saw the faces of her girls.  LaLaurie hopes that as a witch, Fiona will find a way to kill her.  They head back to the academy. \n"}]}
