Back in the Old Testament days you could be stoned to death for many things, including talking back to your parents. Christians believe that after Christ died for everyone's sins, he took that death punishment so that we would not have to die for our own sins. \n"}, {"text": "Which pair of words, completes this verse from Leviticus 19:14? \"Thou shalt not curse the ____________, nor put a stumbling block before the __________, but shalt fear thy God; I am the Lord.\"", "correct": "deaf, blind", "options": ["ugly, stupid", "crippled, lepers", "fat, lame"], "explanation": "\n\n\ndeaf, blind.\n\n\tI always like this verse because many people think that a person with a disability is worthless and should be killed.
