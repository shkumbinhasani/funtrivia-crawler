No matter how badly he is treated by the woman, he will go on loving her. In spite of her \"schemes and lies\" he will still be there. He just can't help himself or explain why he loves her. So the title \"Don't Ask Me Why\" fits very well. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the line: \"There are no roses in the -\"", "correct": "snow", "options": ["desert", "garden", "vase"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsnow.\n\n\t\"And I'll Stop Loving You.\" He lists all the impossible things he can think of.
