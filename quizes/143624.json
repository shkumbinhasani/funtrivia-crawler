{"id": "143624", "name": "'Harold and Maude' (Part 3) Quiz | Harold and Maude . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "   Movies H-K", "Harold and Maude"], "questions": [{"text": "We enter this third installment at the point where Harold picks up Maude from a warehouse where she has been posing for a sculptor.  The two of them return to Maude's home, where Harold is offered ginger pie and what sort of tea?", "correct": "Oat straw", "options": ["Wheat germ", "Alfalfa sprout", "Rice stalk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOat straw.\n\n\tMaude mentions organic food during a time long before it came into vogue.  Her diet consists of simply eating right, and she assigns this (and her early morning breathing exercises) as the reason for her amazing longevity. \n"}, {"text": "Maude shows Harold several pieces of her own artwork.  They include a lovely wooden sculpture that reminds one of the work of Barbara Hepworth.  Her two paintings are called 'The Rape of Rome' and what other title?", "correct": "Rainbow With Egg Underneath and an Elephant", "options": ["Crossing All the Obscene Boundaries", "Monkeys, Conch Shell and Tumbleweeds on Toast", "What a Wonderful Place for Backgammon and Crayfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRainbow With Egg Underneath and an Elephant.\n\n\tIn her 'The Rape of Rome' she has depicted Leda and the Swan (Zeus), which she claims to be a self-portrait.  It's very much a representative piece.  'Rainbow With Egg Underneath and an Elephant' is more abstract, and quite surrealistic, and actually quite a nice work of art!  Maude also is a practitioner of 'odorifics', which is a rather arcane and eccentric topic for this neophyte. \n"}, {"text": "During their conversation in Maude's home, Maude reveals that she will reach what age on Saturday?", "correct": "80", "options": ["85", "75", "90"], "explanation": "\n\n\n80.\n\n\tAnd then she says something quite revealing for those who know the end of the film, namely, 'It's all going to be over on Saturday'.  Harold, caught up in the moment, fails to question this comment by Maude. \n"}, {"text": "After the tea, Harold takes Maude to observe one of his other favorite activities (after funeral attendance, of course), building demolition.  Maude recognizes that Harold might have an obsession about death and destruction, so she counters the demolition experience by taking Harold to a greenhouse and then to a rural area with thousands of flowers.  What sort of flower does Maude say she would love to be?", "correct": "Sunflower", "options": ["Orchid", "Violet", "Rose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSunflower.\n\n\tMaude would love to be a sunflower, because 'they're so tall and simple'.  Harold chooses to be one of thousands of tiny white flowers that are 'all the same', according to the young man.  Maude denies this, suggesting that, though on the surface they may appear the same, they are all subtly different.  Maude is teaching Harold about the beauty of life one lesson at a time.  One of her best quotes: 'I feel that much of the world's sorrow comes from people who are *this*, yet allow themselves to be treated as *that*.' \n"}, {"text": "After visiting the countryside, Harold and Maude return to town, and make a plan to steal which of these items from the downtown area?", "correct": "A tree", "options": ["A fire hydrant", "A mailbox", "A park bench"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA tree.\n\n\tWhile driving madly through town (she makes a full 360 degree turn at one intersection), Maude notices a little tree in distress.  The plan is to dig it up and then plant it in a nearby forest.  They are able to execute the plan shortly afterward. \n"}, {"text": "What old 'relic' in Maude's home reminds her of her past in Europe, where she claims to have participated in picket lines, rallies and political meetings?", "correct": "An umbrella", "options": ["A teapot", "A lamp", "An antique vase"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn umbrella.\n\n\tMaude claims to have used her umbrella for defense.  She also claims to have been 'dragged off by police' and 'attacked by the thugs of the opposition'.  When asked what she was fighting for, Maude lists 'liberty, rights and justice'.  She sounds like a true revolutionary, except that she does 'miss the kings'. \n"}, {"text": "After some conversation, Maude insists on some music, and she performs a number on her piano.  Harold, who claims not to sing and dance, is instructed by Maude to begin playing a musical instrument.  Which instrument does Maude choose for Harold?", "correct": "Banjo", "options": ["Trumpet", "Guitar", "Violin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBanjo.\n\n\tMaude has an entire closet full of musical instruments, but specifically chooses a banjo for Harold.  How fitting!  She instructs him to 'be impulsive' and 'fanciful' in his playing, and to 'let the music flow out' of him. \n"}, {"text": "Back at home, Harold begins to practice on his instrument.  He is interrupted by his mother, who has purchased a new car for her son.  What sort of car has she bought for Harold?", "correct": "Jaguar", "options": ["Porsche", "Mercedes", "Lotus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJaguar.\n\n\tMuch to Harold's chagrin, his mother has had his hearse towed away, and in its place she has purchased a very sporty looking Jaguar.  Harold makes quick work of this gift.  Using his technical expertise with a blowtorch, he turns it into another hearse! \n"}, {"text": "Off on another excursion in yet another vehicle stolen by Maude, the two protagonists find themselves pulled over by a motorcycle policeman.  Which popular American actor of film and television played this young officer?", "correct": "Tom Skerritt", "options": ["Henry Winkler", "Elliot Gould", "Tom Hanks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Skerritt.\n\n\tTom Skerritt played the role, though you wouldn't know it from the credits.  He is credited under the name 'M. Borman', and I don't know why.  Skerritt, like actors G. Wood (the psychiatrist) and Bud Cort (Harold), appeared in the film 'M*A*S*H' the previous year.  He went on to much greater fam with his role in the television series 'Picket Fences' and in films like 'Top Gun' and 'Steel Magnolias'. \n"}, {"text": "Harold and Maude are able to evade a ticket from the police officer by out driving him in hilarious fashion.  On their way back, however, they are pulled over again by the same, albeit much angrier, officer.  He has listed several charges he plans to file against Maude.  Which of these is not one of the charges?", "correct": "Reckless driving", "options": ["Possession of a stolen shovel", "Possession of a stolen vehicle", "Resisting arrest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReckless driving.\n\n\tSurprisingly, the most obvious offense of 'reckless driving' is not listed, nor is 'exceeding the speed limit' or 'failing to stop at a toll booth'!  The charges also include 'possession of a stolen tree'.  While the officer checks the inside of the stolen truck in which Harold and Maude have arrived, they steal is motorbike and make a clean getaway.  I think it's safe to say that Maude is an anarchist.  Please feel free to take a look at the previous two installments of this quiz, and I invite you to try the next installment as well...thank you for playing! \n"}]}
