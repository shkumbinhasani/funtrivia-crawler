They wanted the nice full-boded wines of their Burgundian neighbors. To their horror, what they got instead were light, pinkish, bubbly wines that popped the corks while fermenting in the cool cellars!\rIn the 17th century, they hired Benedictine monk Dom P\u00e9rignon to \"fix\" the embarrassing problem. He experimented but soon realized the hidden value of the bubbles. He further developed the quality of the wine with the blend of the right grapes, the method of the two fermentations - once in the barrels and another one in the bottles, made the bottles thicker so that they wouldn't break from the pressure and corked them after the second fermentation so that they wouldn't pop.\rChampagne comes only from the Champagne region of France. Every other bubbly wine is called \"sparkling\" wine and those wine makers that follow the strict rules of champagne making, can use \"methode champenoise\" on their label. \n"}, {"text": "The famous French upside-down apple pie was invented in the 1880s by two sisters, owners of a country hotel, 160 km south of Paris, in Lamotte-Beuvron.\nWhat is the name of the dessert?", "correct": "Tarte Tatin", "options": ["Charlotte", "Clafoutis", "Frangipane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTarte Tatin.\n\n\tAn overworked St\u00e9phanie Tatin, while preparing the apples in butter and sugar for a traditional apple pie , left the pan in the oven for too long.

She turned the pie upside-down and served, hoping the clients wouldn't realise her mistake.\rThe pie became a success and although the sisters never named the dessert after themselves or published it in any recipe book, it went down in culinary history as Tarte Tatin.\rThere is another version of the story, that the pie fell to the floor and St\u00e9phanie picked it up and served it anyway. I choose not to believe that, for obvious reasons. \n"}, {"text": "Saccharin, a chemical substitute for sugar with no nutritional value, was accidentally invented in a laboratory of a famous university.
