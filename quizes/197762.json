{"id": "197762", "name": "'Star Wars' Deaths Quiz / Test | Star Wars | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Star Wars"], "questions": [{"text": "We'll start with an easy one.  What are the circumstances of Obi-Wan Kenobi's death in 'Star Wars IV: A New Hope'?", "correct": "He sacrifices himself in a light-saber battle with Darth Vader", "options": ["He is shot by an imperial stormtrooper", "He dies in the explosion of the Death Star", "He falls to his death while turning off the power for the Death Star's tractor beam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe sacrifices himself in a light-saber battle with Darth Vader.\n\n\tObi-Wan (Alec Guinness) is featured in perhaps the most famous 'sword fight' in film history, when he faces off against Darth Vader.  Sadly, fans of 'Star Wars' never discover whether Darth truly had overcome his master's skills, as Obi-Wan sacrifices himself during the battle in order to help Luke with his guiding voice. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these minor 'Star Wars' characters does not die in the film 'Star Wars IV: A New Hope'?", "correct": "Wedge", "options": ["Grand Moff Tarkin", "Uncle Owen", "Aunt Beru"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWedge.\n\n\tWedge Antilles actually survives the entire original trilogy, having participated in the destruction of both the original and the second Death Stars.  Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are killed by stormtroopers early in the film, while Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) dies in the original Death Star. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the green reptilian-like bounty hunter that Han Solo kills in the cantina at Mos Eisley, Tatooine in 'Star Wars IV: A New Hope'?", "correct": "Greedo", "options": ["Hrchek Kal Fas", "Hammerhead", "Wioslea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreedo.\n\n\tIn the original version, Han Solo fires on Greedo first (some would say, however, that he was provoked) but George Lucas decided to add a laser fire from Greedo's blaster in order to suggest that Han Solo killed his adversary in a fair fight. \n"}, {"text": "Another minor character in 'Star Wars IV: A New Hope' is a pal of Luke Skywalker's from Tatooine who dies in the attack on the Death Star.  What is this poor fellow's name?", "correct": "Biggs", "options": ["Senesca", "Hughes", "Ozzel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBiggs.\n\n\tBiggs Darklighter is a childhood friend of Luke's from Tatooine.  Both join the Rebel Alliance and fight in the Battle of Yavin (the one in which the Death Star is destroyed) at the end of Episode IV.  Sadly, Biggs does not survive this battle. \n"}, {"text": "In the film 'Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back' Darth Vader uses his command of the force to execute one of his top commanders after the Millennium Falcon escapes his grasp.  What is the name of the poor fellow that feels Vader's wrath?", "correct": "Captain Needa", "options": ["Admiral Veers", "Captain Panaka", "Admiral Trebor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Needa.\n\n\tCaptain Needa is one of the sacrifices necessary during the original trilogy in order to show Darth Vader's ruthlessness and evil.  In a sense, Needa did deserve some punishment.  After all, how could a tiny ship like the Falcon escape the grasp of imperial star destroyers? \n"}, {"text": "A number of key characters meet their maker during 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi'.  The first of these deaths is that of Boba Fett, the bounty hunter who captured Han Solo.  What is the name of the creature that consumes Boba Fett?", "correct": "Sarlacc", "options": ["Logray", "Chirpa", "Teebo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSarlacc.\n\n\tBoba Fett is rather unceremoniously done away with in 'Return of the Jedi', and even George Lucas laments this somewhat in the audio commentary.  Perhaps he did not realize at the time what a large role Boba Fett would play in the 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy.  Regardless, the Sarlacc, a creature that lives in the desert of Tatooine, enjoyed a nice meal that day.(Note: The author of this quiz realizes that Boba Fett lives on in the book version, but since George Lucas has explicity stated that he will not make any more 'Star Wars' films, it is assumed that Boba Fett has perished, as per Lucas' comments in the audio commentary of the film 'Return of the Jedi'.) \n"}, {"text": "Jabba the Hutt is the next to kick the bucket in 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi'.  Which character from the original trilogy performs the dirty work of killing the slug-like Jabba?", "correct": "Leia", "options": ["Luke", "Lando", "Han Solo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeia.\n\n\tLeia, who has been captured by Jabba and turned into his pleasure slave, returns the compliment by choking Jabba with the chain by which she is bound to the disgusting creature.  Thus the evil Jabba died aboard his desert sail barge. \n"}, {"text": "The Jedi master Yoda is the next significant character to leave the Star Wars universe in 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi', taking his leave in his little hut on which planet?", "correct": "Dagobah", "options": ["Bespin", "Hoth", "Tatooine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDagobah.\n\n\tYoda talks with Luke, revealing that Luke is indeed the son of Darth Vader with his dying words, along with the knowledge that there is another Skywalker (Leia).  The ancient Jedi master then fades away, as did Obi-Wan Kenobi, becoming one with the force. \n"}, {"text": "The next major death in 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi' occurs near the end of the film when the evil Emperor Palpatine is dismissed with extreme prejudice by what means?", "correct": "Darth Vader throws him into the reactor core of the Death Star", "options": ["Luke hurls his light saber and decapitates him", "He dies in the explosion of the Death Star", "He is shot by his own bodyguards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarth Vader throws him into the reactor core of the Death Star.\n\n\tThe evil Palpatine is ably played by Ian McDiarmid in 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi'.  His death is perhaps the most surprising of all during the original trilogy, coming at the hands of Darth Vader, his formerly loyal apprentice. \n"}, {"text": "The last and perhaps most tear-jerking death of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy comes at the end of 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi'.  Which very significant character dies, with his body cremated, at the end of that film?", "correct": "Darth Vader & Vader & Darth & Anakin Skywalker & Anakin & Skywalker", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarth Vader & Vader & Darth & Anakin Skywalker & Anakin & Skywalker.\n\n\tWhen I watched 'Return of the Jedi', tears came to my eyes twice, once at the death of Yoda and a second time when Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker passes away.  Sebastian Shaw provides the face of Anakin in this episode, though the masked Darth Vader was portrayed by David Prowse otherwise (with voice provided by James Earl Jones).\r Thank you for playing.  I hope you enjoyed this quiz and will try some of my other quizzes in the future. \n"}]}
