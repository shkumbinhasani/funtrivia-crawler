{"id": "85724", "name": "The Persian Empire, Part II Quiz | Ancient History | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "    Ancient History", "Persian Empire"], "questions": [{"text": "When last we left off (see the quiz 'Persian Empire, Part I') Cyrus had just conquered Babylon (in 539 B.C.), greatly expanding his empire.  Persia inherited which two areas following this conquest?  \n", "correct": "Syria and Palestine", "options": ["Egypt and Judah", "Phrygia and Armenia", "Lydia and Media"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSyria and Palestine.\n\n\tThe Persians were looked at as benevolent liberators by the native peoples of these areas.  In particular, the Jews who had been exiled to Babylon, were able to make their way back to Jerusalem where their temple was rebuilt.  Again, Persian tolerance created the atmosphere that made these things possible. \n"}, {"text": "The founder of the Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great, died in battle in 530 B.C. fighting against which people of central Asia?  \n", "correct": "Massagetai", "options": ["Yueqi", "Peshinegs", "Scythians"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMassagetai.\n\n\tThe Massagetai dwelled in the area now occupied by Afghanistan, a place where many a great power has found itself bogged down in dangerous warfare.  Cyrus was unable to overcome the Massagetai who were led by Queen Tomyris, and he perished in battle. \n"}, {"text": "Cambyses was the second Persian Emperor, succeeding his father Cyrus after the latter's death in battle.  Before succeeding to the throne however, Cambyses had his own brother put to death.  What was this brother's name?  \n", "correct": "Smerdis", "options": ["Necho", "Geta", "Haoma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmerdis.\n\n\tCambyses was the eldest son of Cyrus and was chosen by Cyrus to be the successor to the Persian throne, but this did not prevent Cambyses from secretly having his brother killed so that no challenge could be mounted to his reign. \n"}, {"text": "What was undoubtedly the greatest accomplishment of Cambyses' reign?  \n", "correct": "Conquest of Egypt", "options": ["Subjugation of Israel", "Destruction of the Lydians", "Naval campaign against the Greeks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConquest of Egypt.\n\n\tThe conquering of Egypt was not difficult for the army of Cambyses, within a year (from 526-5 B.C.) they entered Memphis where Cambyses was made Pharaoh.  Unfortunately, it appears that the priests of Egypt were somehow offended by Cambyses and slandered him, while at the same time a revolt against Cambyses began back in Persia.  The combination of these factors probably led to his suicide in 525 B.C. \n"}, {"text": "Darius, the next Persian Emperor following Cambyses, began his reign by putting down the revolt of which usurper to the throne?  \n", "correct": "Gaumata", "options": ["Astyages", "Lydus", "Phraortes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGaumata.\n\n\tGaumata (a priest, or 'magi'), taking advantage of the fact that Cambyses was busy conquering Egypt, impersonated Cambyses' dead brother Smerdis (remember, his death was a secret) and laid claim to the Persian throne.  Following the death of Cambyses, the Immortals (imperial bodyguard), remaining loyal to Cambyses, threw their lot in behind another successor, Darius.  Though Darius was a distant relative of Cambyses, he immediately gained the loyalty of the Persian army and put down Gaumata's revolt by 522 B.C. \n"}, {"text": "During his reign, Darius made several great conquests, and brought the Persian Empire to its greatest extent.  However, in terms of warfare Darius is probably best known for which great loss inflicted by the Greeks?  \n", "correct": "Marathon", "options": ["Plataea", "Thermopylae", "Salamis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarathon.\n\n\tDespite his conquests of Thrace and Macedonia, and his moderately successful campaigns against the Scythians, Darius could not overcome the united Greeks at Marathon, led by the commander Miltiades.  Darius's army was badly defeated on the plain of Marathon in 490 B.C. and he died 4 years later without ever having been able to follow up his attack. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these rivers did not form a border (at least in part) for the Persian empire, at its greatest extent (during the reign of Darius)?  \n", "correct": "Nile River", "options": ["Jaxartes River", "Indus River", "Danube River"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNile River.\n\n\tThe Persians controlled all of Egypt, on both sides of the Nile, hence it did not form a border for the empire.  The Jaxartes river formed part of the Persian border to central Asia, while the Indus in part formed the border with India.  The Persians stopped at the Danube in their conquest of Thrace.  Most of these rivers also formed the boundaries for Alexander the Great's empire after he conquered Persia. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the son of Darius, ascending to the throne at Darius's death in 485 B.C.?  \n", "correct": "Xerxes I & Xerxes & Xerxes 1", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nXerxes I & Xerxes & Xerxes 1.\n\n\tXerxes continued unsuccessfully his father's campaigns to conquer Greece and met with several embarrassing defeats. \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  Athens was captured and burned by the Persians.  \n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThis is true!  With an army of some 180,000 men and 600 ships (estimates of these numbers do vary), Xerxes' army crossed the Hellespont (Dardanelles) over a pontoon bridge and crossed through Thrace and Macedonia towards the Greek peninsula.  The Greeks were defeated at the naval battle of Artemisium and at the pass at Thermopylae in 480 B.C., but not before having inflicted heavy losses on the Persian fleet and army, respectively.  Soon the Persians took an essentially deserted Athens and burned it...things looked dire for the Greeks.  However, the naval victory at Salamis later in the year was the turning point for the Greeks, and they were able to inflict a crushing defeat of the Persians in 479 B.C. at Plataea, under the commander Pausanias.  The Greeks were able to overcome seemingly overwhelming odds and their own disunity to turn back the great Persian Empire, which was never the same again. \n"}, {"text": "I'm going to skip a great deal of time now to ask this final question, that is...who was the last emperor of Persia, just prior to its final defeat by Alexander the Great in 330 B.C.?  \n", "correct": "Darius III", "options": ["Artaxerxes I", "Artaxerxes II", "Xerxes II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarius III.\n\n\tFollowing a long decline, which included the remainder of Xerxes' reign, and the reigns of Artaxerxes I, II and III and Xerxes II, Darius III rose to the throne in 336 B.C.  His empire was soon lost though to the army of Alexander the Great, who would eventually conquer the entire territory of the Persian Empire at its greatest extent. \n"}]}
