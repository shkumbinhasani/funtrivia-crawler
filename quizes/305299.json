{"id": "305299", "name": "Paul Blart: Mall Cop Test |   Movies", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies L-P", "Paul Blart: Mall Cop"], "questions": [{"text": "Who played the starring role of Paul Blart?", "correct": "Kevin James", "options": ["Kevin Bacon", "Kevin Kevin", "Kevin Costner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin James.\n\n\tKevins James is an American actor born in 1965.  He has appeared in many shows, like \"The King of Queens\", where he played the lead, and \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", where he occasionally starred.  Movies include \"Hitch\" and, of course, my personal favorite, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\".

He did exceptionally well.  In fact, he creamed all his competitors in the course.  However, right near the finish line, he collapsed and fell into a deep sleep.  What was the cause of this unfortunate mishap?", "correct": "Hypoglycemia", "options": ["Hypothyroidism", "Dyslexia", "Hypoextended body"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHypoglycemia.\n\n\tHis hypoglycemia has prevented Paul from doing many things he loved.  To prevent him from falling over, he had to have sugar quite often.  Near the beginning of the movie, his mom mentioned pie, and instead of finishing dinner, all Paul could think about was pie, so he was given two slices.  Near the end of the movie, Paul was able to use his hypoglycemia to his advantage. \n"}, {"text": "Paul lived with his mother and his daughter.  What was his daughter's name?", "correct": "Maya", "options": ["Millie", "Misty", "Myra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaya.\n\n\tMaya Blart was played by Raini Rodriguez.  Maya was unaware that the mall her father worked at was being taken by terrorists and her dad was trying to save hostages.  Therefore, she entered into the mall through the back door with her special key to bring her dad his dinner.  She ended up becoming a hostage, giving Paul one more reason to keep trying harder. \n"}, {"text": "While Paul was patrolling the mall, he saw someone.  He looked at her, and began to fall in love with her.  Who was this woman?", "correct": "Amy", "options": ["Alex", "Ally", "Annie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmy.\n\n\tJayma Mays played Amy, Paul's love interest of the movie.  We saw Amy with several different hair colors and styles in the movie.  She started as a blonde, but we saw her later with short, black hair, and later, she was a reddish blonde.  Jayma Mays has had several other roles, including a lead role in \"Red Eye\", her film debut, and as Charlie from \"Ugly Betty\". \n"}, {"text": "Shortly after a fight scene, Paul went limping off to a corner.  He looked at his arm to see a wound.  He realized it wasn't too bad, but put a band-aid on it, anyway.  What cartoon character was on the band-aid?", "correct": "Hello Kitty", "options": ["Powerpuff Girls", "Dora the Explorer", "Blues Clues"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHello Kitty.\n\n\tBlart, Blart, Blart.  Leave it to Paul to have a \"Hello Kitty\" band-aid.  He barely got a small scratch on his arm, and he felt like he was dying.  Even after he realized it wasn't even bleeding, he had to put a band-aid on it anyway.  \r\"Hello Kitty\" was a children's animated cartoon developed in 1974 by Japanese artists.  It was a show that centers around a small, white, two dimensional cat, with a bow in her hair.  Many products have been made using the \"Hello Kitty\" logo.  The logo of \"Hello Kitty\" is the cat's white head with a red bow in her hair.  Paul's bandaid was covered with many little \"Hello Kitty\" heads. \n"}, {"text": "Paul was supposed to train a new guy to be a mall cop.  The new guy thought that Paul was being quite immature in the way he ran his mall.  He was not very helpful, either.  In fact, when Paul was being attacked by a large woman in \"Victoria's Secret,\" the new guy didn't even help him out!  What was the name of this new guy?", "correct": "Veck Sims", "options": ["Hoss Taj", "Vic Tims", "Rick Johns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVeck Sims.\n\n\tThe new guy's name was Veck Sims, and he was played by Keir O'Donnell.  We learned later, when hostages had been taken, Veck being one of them, that he was not a hostage after all.  He was a bad guy.  In fact, he surprised everyone by saying that he was the leader.  He only wanted to take the job to get an inside eye on the mall.  I made the other three names up, although \"Vic Tims\" would be the perfect name for a bad guy taking hostages, wouldn't it? \n"}, {"text": "During the movie, SWAT arrived to secure the mall.  They were to take over securing the mall instead of the already existing policemen who were securing it.  The commander was quite rude to everybody.  What was his name?", "correct": "Commander Kent", "options": ["Commander Kill", "Commander Cody", "Commander Cream"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommander Kent.\n\n\tKent turned out to be a bad guy.  We found this out when Veck was lying on the ground after being beaten by Paul.  Kent then said to Paul, \"Nice work, capturing him without even using a gun.  You don't mind if I do, do you?\"  Quickly he took out his gun and aimed for Paul before he himself got shot by Paul's elderly boss. Nobody knew Kent was evil, although nobody liked him.  It worked well for him to be in that position.  He told his SWAT members to secure the back, but that was just a ploy, so it would appear that they were securing the back.  But they were not, and this was so Veck could make his escape much easier. He also tried to get Paul Blart out of the mall, telling him to save himself, although this really wasn't what he had in mind.  He was mainly thinking that he wanted him out of there so they could pull their heist off much easier. \n"}, {"text": "Several bad guys were foiled by Paul.  In which of these ways did Paul trap Rudolph?", "correct": "Hiding in the ball pit and pulling him under", "options": ["Breaking the air conditioning vents and whacking him on the head", "Hiding as a hockey player mannequin and attacking him from behind", "Trapping him in a tanning bed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHiding in the ball pit and pulling him under.\n\n\tAlthough all these were ways he trapped and/or defeated bad guys, the only way he defeated Rudolph was using the ball pit.  Rudolph was played by Mike Vallely, a professional skateboarder.  Naturally, in the movie, Rudolph was the one who used the skateboard to chase Paul.  The bad guys were all disguised as Santa's helpers on Black Friday, so naturally, their codenames were Rudolph, Prancer, and Blitzen. They were not a friendly bunch.  When Paul was disguised as a hockey player mannequin, this is when he tried to attack Veck for the first time.  Prancer was the female bad guy, who was caught by being whacked on the head with the air conditioning vent. This was a complete accident on Paul's part.  He was trying to escape from two bad guys.  He hid in a store where a bunch of legs were hanging everywhere, so he made his legs come out of the vent.  They saw his legs move and gave chase to Blart.  Paul was able to climb part of the way through the ventillation system throughout the store, but he was too heavy to be supported.  His weight caused the vents to break and he slid down out of the vent.  Prancer was hit on the head and Paul tied her up.  Blitzen was caught in a tanning bed.  Paul was being chased by Blitzen into the tanning salon, and Paul was trapped in a tanning booth.  He was sprayed everywhere, with his clothes on.  He burst out of the booth and shot Blitzen into the tanning bed.  He turned the tanning bed on so he could see what was written on Blitzen's arm.  He also had put some protective eye wear on Blitzen to protect his eyes from the bright lights of the tanning bed. \n"}, {"text": "Paul was often made fun of because he was overweight.  However, there was one co-worker of his that was even larger.  Paul was unable to pull him up in the air vents when trying to rescue the hostages, and he caused them all to fall through the roof.  What was the name of this overweight man?", "correct": "Leon", "options": ["Lionel", "Livershnitzel", "Leslie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeon.\n\n\tLeon was a coworker of Blart.  The 25 year old man worked at the mall at a kiosk.  He was a friend of Paul's.  Leon was played by Jamal Mixon.  He also starred in several other movies, many of them as the fat kid everybody made fun of.  He also made a single appearance in \"George Lopez\" as the fat kid, again.  George made fun of him and he got quite angry with George. \n"}, {"text": "Who called Paul, thinking that he was really calling his girlfriend?", "correct": "Pahud", "options": ["Muhammad", "Pupanunu", "Peebody"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPahud.\n\n\tPahud originally called Paul because he thought it was his girlfriend's number.  The reason Paul had her phone was because he told Amy he had one.  He did not, however.  A coworker who sold cell phones at a kiosk lent Paul his daughter's cell phone.  Paul did not want to take it at first, but eventually did, as the coworker said it would be good. Not only would Paul get a phone, but his daughter was being \"grounded\" from her phone anyway, so it was not in use.  Of course, he did not want Paul to go over the monthly minutes, which is why the daughter was in trouble in the first place.  Pahud, therefore, called this number in hopes to talk to his \"grounded\" girlfriend. Every time Pahud called, a girly song about bubble gum played on Paul's phone.  Pahud heard Paul answer and thought Paul was sleeping with his girlfriend.  Pahud was not very happy, but when Paul gave him advice, he quickly became friends with Paul.  He never wore a shirt in the movie, except in the end credits.  Pahud even helped track down Veck at the very end of the movie.  Pahud was played by Adhir Kalyan, a South African actor. \n"}]}
