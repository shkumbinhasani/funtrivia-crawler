Not only did this Universal-genius discover that all materiality was composed of a-tomos (atoms), but he also contributed in every field of science. He travelled to India, Babylon and the rest of the known world, consulting with magi and the wisest-people he could find. \n"}, {"text": "What was the geometrical shape that was used by the Brotherhood of the Pythagoreans as a sign of membership?\n", "correct": "pentagram", "options": ["circle", "triangle", "octagon"], "explanation": "\n\n\npentagram.\n\n\tThe pentagram was called \"health\" by the brotherhood, it is a triple-triangle. The Pythagoreans played an important part in the history of astronomy with the spherical-model of the Universe. Thus, they also inferred that the earth and other celestial bodies were spherical in nature. \n"}, {"text": "A quadratrix was derived as a solution for trisecting any angle. Who was the fellow who solved this problem? \n", "correct": "Hippias", "options": ["Archimedes", "Archtyas", "Plato"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHippias.\n\n"}, {"text": "\"Sphaerica\" is perhaps the most important of Greek works.

Autolycus' theorems: If a sphere revolves uniformly about its axis, all the points on the surface of the sphere which are not on the axis will describe parallel circles which have the same poles as the sphere and are also at right angles. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the German mathematician that incorporated Zeno of Elea's notion of infinitesimals, banishing not only these demons but also showing how in fact we live in a Parmenidean world of stillness?\n", "correct": "Weierstrass", "options": ["Newton", "Leibniz", "Gauss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWeierstrass.\n\n"}, {"text": "Who was the Greek mathematician credited with proving the Pythagorean theory?", "correct": "Apollodorus", "options": ["Aristotle", "Archilocus", "Archimedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApollodorus.\n\n\tThis theorem is also claimed by the Indians to have been discovered and documented in the Apastamba Sulba Sutras. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the Greek mathematician that systematized the axioms of Babylonia and Greece?", "correct": "Euclid", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEuclid.\n\n"}, {"text": "Thales was not only a decent philosopher, but he also founded many geometrical theorems. Which of the following theorems are not attributed to Thales?", "correct": "Parallel lines intersected create equal angles", "options": ["If two triangles have 2 angles and one equal they are of tantamount natures", "A circle is bisected by its diameter", "Angles of two isosceles triangles have equal base angles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParallel lines intersected create equal angles.\n\n"}, {"text": "Which Greek philosopher and mathematician was successful in the squaring of the lunes, which then induced him to \"square the circle\"?", "correct": "Hippocrates", "options": ["Archimedes", "Thales", "Eudoxus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHippocrates.\n\n"}]}
