{"id": "355698", "name": "Scoff, Scran, Mongee - British Regional dishes Trivia Game | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "International Cuisine", "British Foods"], "questions": [{"text": "A short crust pastry base filled with a light frangipane centre, topped with fondant and often decorated with cherries, this delicious tart hails from which Derbyshire town?", "correct": "Bakewell", "options": ["Chesterfield", "Norwich", "Canterbury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBakewell.\n\n\tThis sweet and tasty tart hails from the Derbyshire Peak District town of Bakewell where it is still being made today to the original, secret recipe.  A variation to this classic tart is traditionally known as a Bakewell Pudding which has a puff-pastry base in place of the more usual short crust base.  These desserts were created accidentally by the cook to a Mrs Greaves, the landlady of the White Horse Inn, Bakewell in 1870. \n"}, {"text": "This dessert, from the south western counties of England, bears a striking resemblance to a similar and popular form that can be found in Germany known as 'Strudel'.  But which one is it?", "correct": "Apple Dappy", "options": ["Spotted Dick", "Grannies Cake", "Banoffee Pie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApple Dappy.\n\n\tThis is a traditional pudding that can be found in those areas where apples are grown for eating, as fodder and for the production of my favourite tipple, good strong farmhouse cider.  So that will be the entire South West of England then!  It consists of a light, scone like pastry packed with apples, sprinkled with brown sugar and then rolled, strudel style, before being baked and then served with good thick custard... Or Cr\u00e8me Anglaise for the more pretentious amongst us! \n"}, {"text": "This very popular toasted snack has been known to make use of ale and cider as well as a good robust, salty cheddar... Do you know which one?", "correct": "Rarebit", "options": ["Bubble and Squeak", "Stargazy Pie", "Colcannon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRarebit.\n\n\tDonkey's years ago, that's a long time ago for those unfamiliar with the old English term, there were variations of rarebit or 'rabbit' being eaten in England, Scotland and Ireland in addition to the very popular and well known Welsh version.  The origin of the term 'rabbit' to describe this dish is unknown but it may have been used as an insult as the Welsh were so poor that cheese was considered to take the place of meat in their diet. When I was a youngster my mother would simply lay thick slices of cheese on bread and toast them until the cheese ran over the edges and then lay raw onion rings on the melted cheese. As an adult I always grate the cheese into a bowl, beat it with a few fluid ounces of ale and then spread this on bread before toasting.  Add a dash of Tabasco sauce and some shredded spring/salad onions and voila!..  A snack fit for a king! \n"}, {"text": "In 2004 this locally produced, Scottish smoked haddock was granted protected status by the European Commission. Can you identify which one?", "correct": "Arbroath Smokies", "options": ["Gravadlax", "Jellied Eels", "Rollmop Herrings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArbroath Smokies.\n\n\tThe delicious 'Arbroath Smokie' is a type of smoked haddock from the east coast town of Arbroath in Angus, Scotland and are a real delicacy.  Salted Haddock are hot smoked over hardwood chippings where they develop a deep and intensely smoky flavour.  A similar, but far milder flavoured fish known as 'Finnan Haddie', can be found a little further up the coast toward the city of Aberdeen but this fish requires further cooking before it can be eaten as it is produced using a cold smoking process. \n"}, {"text": "A certain King of England didn't only give battle in vain but also lost the recipe to these, his favourite biscuits. Please don't get yourself into a 'muddle' figuring it out, but can you say which it is?", "correct": "Bosworth Jumbles", "options": ["Rich Osborne", "Brandy Snaps", "Garibaldi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBosworth Jumbles.\n\n\tBosworth Jumbles are speciality biscuits from the midlands area of England and especially from the county of Leicestershire.  The original recipe was believed to have been dropped by the chef to King Richard III on the field of the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.  It is common today to find the original recipe, which simply consisted of plain flour, caster sugar, butter and eggs, enhanced by the addition of vanilla or citrus fruit flavourings. In Cornwall you might find a very similar biscuit called a 'Fairing'.  You should try some, they are scrumptious. \n"}, {"text": "Which cake is another variation of the ever popular rich fruit cake that can be found being made all over the British Isles and is named for a town in Yorkshire?", "correct": "Ripon Spice Cake", "options": ["Malt Loaf", "Simnel Cake", "Manor House Cake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRipon Spice Cake.\n\n\tRipon Spice Cake, a sweet and rich slab of English goodness, is flavoured using mixed spice, mace and ground almonds, has a good handful of cherries added and is traditionally served with a thick slice of mild, crumbly Wensleydale cheese all washed down by a cup of hot, strong Yorkshire tea.  Bliss! \n"}, {"text": "Preferably cooked for many hours over an open fire, which of the following stews is a wonderfully warming and inexpensive dish that bears many similarities to a Lancashire Hotpot?", "correct": "Irish Stew", "options": ["Chicken Fricassee", "Chicken Biryani", "Goulasch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIrish Stew.\n\n\tA hearty stew produced using onions, carrots and diced potatoes along with mutton.  Mutton is the meat from older sheep, usually those that were too old to bear young or that their wool was not of a marketable quality.  Like many stews and casseroles, there are numerous variations on the theme.  My Grandmother used sliced turnips and celeriac in her version. Chicken Biryani is a delicious, slow cooked meat and rice dish that has its origins in the area around Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the western states of the Indian sub-continent.  Biryani's have become so popular in the United Kingdom that many asian restaurants feature them in their menus and many would also say that it could now be considered a British dish!  Goulasch, or Gulasch is a European stew flavoured with sweet and/or smoked paprika, that originated in the area around that we now call Hungary but variations will be found all over eastern Europe and finally, a fricassee is a traditional French stew in which the meat, usually chicken but quite often veal, is not browned before the sauce is added which results in a very pale, almost white stew.\n"}, {"text": "This flat sponge cake is usually covered with a 'berry' flavoured icing although a fruity jam/jelly coating is sometimes found.  Taking its name from an area of London with a famous association football team, can you identify the cake in question?", "correct": "Tottenham Cake", "options": ["French Fancies", "Jam/Jelly Roly-Poly", "Battenburg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTottenham Cake.\n\n\tTowards the end of the 19th century, this confection would often be found being sold from barrows on the streets of London.  Local legend has it that this cake was supposed to have been given to children in 1901 to celebrate the FA Cup win by the local club, Tottenham Hotspur, from where it takes its name. French Fancies are small sponge cakes topped with cream and covered in a highly decorated icing.  Battenberg is the pink and yellow sponge cake, popular around the world, which is covered with a thick layer of marzipan -Yuk!  Jam/jelly Roly-Poly is simply a sheet of pastry smothered in jam, rolled and then baked. A staple in British school dinners for many decades, most of us here of a certain age will either love it or hate it! \n"}, {"text": "These would never be served as a dessert!  They are a type of sausage akin to the Scottish Haggis in as much as they often contain a lower percentage of meat and a higher proportion of offal and rusk than a standard sausage... Would you eat one, could you eat one?    ", "correct": "Hogs Pudding", "options": ["Cumberland Ring", "Andouilles", "Bockwurst"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHogs Pudding.\n\n\tTraditionally, these puddings were produced in Devon and Cornwall but there are variations found around the country and you may well see them advertised for sale as 'White Puddings'.  Hogs puddings are often produced with greater use of spices to flavour them.  Delicious sliced and fried as a part of a full English breakfast. A Cumberland Ring is a very distinctive sausage that looks a little unpleasant as they are usually sold coiled up but taste wonderful.  A Bockwurst is a popular German sausage that many would call a 'Frankfurter' as they are warmed in hot water instead of being fried.  Andouilles are a French speciality from the Normandy region that contains what most people would regard as the most unpleasant of ingredients. Andouilles are also supposed to be delicious but I've never been brave enough to try one! \n"}, {"text": "You should now have the nine initial letters in answer to each question which will, if correct, spell the name of this famous sweet and fruity Welsh bread?", "correct": "Bara Brith", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBara Brith.\n\n\tIn the Welsh language, Bara Brith means 'spotted' or 'speckled' bread.  It is dark, yeasty and sweet bread which, like most traditional foods, has recipes that vary from family to family.  Bara Brith can often be found enhanced by adding a small quantity of a liqueur to the fruit as they soak before being added to the bread mixture.  Some cooks add honey, some add marmalade and others may use stem ginger and the zest from citrus fruit... The world really is your oyster, although I wouldn't recommend adding them to your Bara Brith! \n"}]}
