Which movement was this?  \n", "correct": "Happenings", "options": ["Hooligans", "Hieratics", "Hermeneutics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHappenings.\n\n\tKaprow viewed the Happenings movement as a combination of assemblage and environment art.  Related to performance art and theater, the artist frequently interacted with his or her own art piece and sometimes played a part within it.  Other adherents included Jim Dine, Claes Oldenburg and the composer John Cage. \n"}, {"text": "In which country did a group of artists who called themselves the 'Heidelberg School' gather together in the late 19th century?  \n", "correct": "Australia", "options": ["Germany", "Canada", "Austria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAustralia.\n\n\tAs strange as it may seem, the Heidelberg School was one of the most prominent schools of art in Australia's short history.  It took its name from a painting camp at Eaglemont in Heidelberg, Victoria.  A short-lived but influential school, the Heidelberg painters followed a similar philosophy as the Impressionists, but made their work distinctively Australian. \n"}, {"text": "The vanishing point on a painting can be found on which 'H' line?  \n", "correct": "Horizon & Horizon line", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHorizon & Horizon line.\n\n\tNaturally, a horizon-line would only be applicable with a perpective painting...it's where the sky and Earth appear to meet on a painting.  The vanishing point normally would fall at or near the center of the painting. \n"}, {"text": "The 'High Renaissance' occurred during approximately which period in history?  \n", "correct": "1495-1520", "options": ["1305-1350", "1625-1650", "1700-1725"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1495-1520.\n\n\tDuring the so-called 'High Renaissance' artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael flourished...it was the climactic period of Renaissance art.  I must say though that this period gets entirely too much attention, naturally based on the fact that the three artists mentioned above worked during that short time.  Great artists were active during the entire Renaissance period! \n"}, {"text": "What is the term for the technique in which the artist applies spaced, parallel lines to indicate shading in a certain region in a drawing, engraving even a painting?  \n", "correct": "Hatching", "options": ["Halftone", "Hedging", "Hueing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHatching.\n\n\tHatching, a simple way of creating tone in an artistic work, is also called 'hachure' (French term).  Cross-hatching is a technique of creating even deeper tone by crossing previous hatching at a differing angle. \n"}, {"text": "The final layer of plaster upon which a fresco painter begins his painting is called which of these?  \n", "correct": "Intonaco", "options": ["Intarsia", "Incrustation", "Inchicia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIntonaco.\n\n\tThis somewhat thick (approx. 1/8 in.) layer is put on fresh and moist, and pigments must be applied immediately, before the lime gets dry and begins to crust up. \n"}, {"text": "This term, which means 'image' or 'likeness' in Greek, is used to describe portrait paitings of saintly figures, Christ or the Virgin Mary during the Byzantine and Russian Orthodox schools of art.  What is this 'I' word?  \n", "correct": "Icon & Ikon & Iconography & Iconic", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nIcon & Ikon & Iconography & Iconic.\n\n\tThe original Greek term is 'eikon' which means 'likeness', and serves to describe the many religious portraits created between the 9th and 15th centuries in the Byzantine and Eastern Orthodox sphere. \n"}, {"text": "The term 'Impressionism' was original applied derisively to the works of the various members of that group after they first exhibited in Paris in 1874.  After which Impressionist painter's work was this term applied?  ", "correct": "Monet", "options": ["Renoir", "Degas", "Morisot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonet.\n\n\tMonet's painting 'Impression, Sunrise' got the honor of receiving special attention from art critic Louis Leroy, who wrote a satirical article about the exhibit, focusing specific attention on the term 'Impression'.  Little did he realize he was helping bolster the launch of the most revolutionary art movement since the beginning of the Renaissance! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these terms refers to a relatively thick layering of opaque paint upon a canvas, wherein the marks of the application instrument (brush, knife, etc.) may still be seen clearly?  \n", "correct": "Impasto", "options": ["Intrados", "Imprimatura", "Interlace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nImpasto.\n\n\tTitian is credited with inventing the impasto technique and it has been used by hundreds of great artists ever since, perhaps most adeptly by Rembrandt and Van Gogh. \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  India ink originated in India. \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, India ink, also known as Chinese Ink, originated in China where it has been used for centuries in calligraphy scroll-works.  It came to be known as 'India Ink' only because the pigments used to create the ink once it arrived in the West were acquired from India.  Next up...a combination of the letters 'J', 'K' and 'L'.  See you there and thanks for playing! \n"}]}
