{"id": "390211", "name": "\"Dig Dug\" Trivia Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stranger Things"], "questions": [{"text": "Mike tries to reassure Will that everything will be fine, comparing his role in the events to which of these?", "correct": "A super-spy", "options": ["A wizard", "A double agent", "A fox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA super-spy.\n\n\tJoyce continues to try to contact Hopper while she looks over Will's drawings which, for the day, she's taped up throughout the walls and floors of her house.  She allowed Mike to come in, and he and Will talk about the shadow monster's spread into Hawkins.  The more the Upside-Down spreads into Hawkins, the more connected he feels to the creature's now-memories.  Mike suggests that maybe everything is happening for a reason, and Will is kind of like a super-spy.\rHopper, meanwhile, investigates the tunnels beneath Hawkins solo, quickly attracting the attention of something on the ceiling and walls that shoots its spores at him.  He's knocked unconscious as the hole he used to gain access seals itself shut. \n"}, {"text": "Hopper uses which of the following to mark his trail in the tunnels?", "correct": "Cigarettes", "options": ["Crayons", "Pieces of cloth", "Bullets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCigarettes.\n\n\tJonathan and Nancy end up at a motel, nervously opting to hide away with their incriminating evidence against the lab by renting a double room.  In their room, Nancy comments on how they only seem to spend time together whenever the world is about to end.  She asks what happened to the two of them since, after everything he just disappeared.  Jonathan claims that Will needed him and she was with Steve.  Nancy says she waited though.\rThe next morning, Will wakes up abruptly.  Mike, who stayed by his side all night, asks what's wrong.  He doesn't say until he finds Joyce seated in the middle of the tunnel mock-up in the living room; he tells her that he thinks he saw Hopper and that he's in trouble.\rHopper wakes up too, and he's still in the tunnel.  He grabs his hat and flashlight but can't find the hole to escape, of course.  He decides to search for a route, covering his mouth with a piece of his uniform to avoid being spored again, and he starts to cut through the tunnels leaving cigarettes behind to mark his path.  He doesn't notice the vines following him along. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin is able to lure Dart out of his house with which of these?", "correct": "Bologna", "options": ["Cheese", "Cat treats", "Blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBologna.\n\n\tAt home, Lucas asks his father what he should do to make someone less angry about something he's done, and he's convinced over breakfast that he should apologize and do whatever that person wants to make it right.  So Lucas ends up leaving home and bikes off to make things right.\rLucas passes by Dustin's place and his mother is sorrowful over her missing cat.  Dustin is able to get her out of the house to search for a cat he already knows is dead and, while she's gone, he suits up in hockey gear and creates a trail of bologna to lure Dart out of his room and to the backyard.  Sure enough, the Demogorgon follows the trail out and Dustin is able to swat him into a storm shelter to seal him up. \n"}, {"text": "How does Eleven reach the Ives household?", "correct": "In a semi truck", "options": ["By train", "In a taxi", "On foot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a semi truck.\n\n\tEleven disembarks from her ride.  in the past day, she hitchhiked to the Ives household to visit her mother.  When she walks up to the door, she knocks until someone answers, but it's apparent they think she's soliciting.  When Eleven uses her powers to remove the chain on the door, she's allowed in to see Terry.  She sits in front of her mother, but there's no recognition.\rJonathan and Nancy get to the right place-- a garage by some train tracks-- and they ring the buzzer to be let in.  Soon though, they're let into Murray Bauman's place to find everything he's pieced together about Barb's missing persons case.  Nancy immediately informs him that his timeline is wrong and that the girl with the buzzed hair was never from Russia, as he'd been told long ago. \n"}, {"text": "Bob is able to figure out the locations depicted in Will's drawings, but only because they avoid which of these?", "correct": "Bodies of water", "options": ["The sewers", "Roadways", "Houses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBodies of water.\n\n\tMax ends up at the arcade to find that her favourite game-- 'Dig Dug'-- is out of order, but that's just a part of a ploy to get her into the back room to speak to Lucas who tells her he's willing to make things right by telling her the truth about everything, but only if she accepts the risks.  She does, and soon enough she's brought up to speed about the entire past year, regardless of how crazy it sounds.\rAt home, Will continues to draw, this time finding a specific image in his mind to identify where Hopper is.  Joyce and Mike are able to pick out the exact spot at a fork in the tunnel but have no idea where that fork is in Hawkins.  Of course, that's when Bob shows up with some soup and brain teasers, believing Will to be sick.  Joyce bends the truth to keep him out of the house...but she realizes they can use his help.  She forces him not to ask questions, but she asks him to help them find the fork on the tunnel map.  Bob is suspicious, but it only takes him a few moments to identify what the tunnel drawing are-- they're a map of Hawkins, but they skirt around all of the local waterways and lakes. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin tries to use his walkie-talkie to communicate with the other guys.  Which one of them responds?", "correct": "None of them", "options": ["Lucas", "Will", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of them.\n\n\tHopper continues to travel through the tunnels, eventually stumbling upon a chamber filled with bones.  He quickly realizes that the room may have close access to the outside world, so he creates a torch to ward off the vines on the walls and starts digging.\rDustin, meanwhile, starts burying his cat in a hole in the ground while trying to get into contact with the others who, as it would seem, are all occupied.  Lucas' sister, Erica, picks up the walkie-talkie but says she won't communicate the message.  He shuts off the walkie instead.\rEleven ends up talking to her aunt who's looking after Terry and they discuss how she won't get any better because she seems to be mentally 'stuck', kind of like she's in a dream.  Eleven is also brought to her room which never changed after she left.  Inside is the crib she once slept in; it's not a room she would use now.  A bed is offered to her though.  The lights start to flicker as they talk, seemingly leading Eleven through the rooms until she's brought back to her mother's seat.  The television channels switch to static and Eleven knows she wants to communicate. \n"}, {"text": "Steve, trying to make amends with Nancy, arrives at the Wheeler household with which of these?", "correct": "Flowers", "options": ["Chocolate", "A written apology", "A television"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlowers.\n\n\tBob gets Joyce, Will, and Mike to measure distances throughout the house to pinpoint the location they've asked for on the map.  This leads him to a spot half a mile southeast of Danford.  They head out immediately.\rDustin ends up arriving at the Wheeler household looking for Mike.  He doesn't find him.  He doesn't find Nancy either.  When he starts to leave though, Steve drives up with flowers for Nancy so he intercepts him and asks him to get back into the car; they'll need to grab his baseball bat with the nails in it because they have big problems.\rHopper continues to dig upwards, scrambling to create a hole large enough to escape out of, but it soon becomes apparent it's a futile effort.  As he slumps to the ground, the vines start to wrap around him, trapping him on the tunnel floor as his screams go unheard. \n"}, {"text": "Does Max initially believe Lucas' story about Eleven and the Upside-Down?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tLucas finishes telling Max the whole story about Eleven and the Upside-Down, but she really doesn't believe it because of how outlandish it all is.  Lucas is appalled that she'd be so callous as to write off his entire story, and when she goes off on him on the arcade floor, he's forced to cover her mouth to avoid having her talk about everything in public.  She asks him to prove his story is true, but Billy pulls up to pick her up.\rNancy plays Murray the tape from the lab and asks if it's enough.  Murray doesn't answer immediately, instead deciding to pour a drink and put on some music to think.  He says that he believes them, but no one else will necessarily and the tape will be easily buried if they're not careful.  As Murray waters down his drink, he tells the two that they just do the same with the story; they water it down to something a bit more familiar and believable to bring down the lab. \n"}, {"text": "What caused Terry Ives to suffer in a reduced mental state?", "correct": "Shock therapy", "options": ["Carbon monoxide", "Radiation poisoning", "Lobotomy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShock therapy.\n\n\tAt the lab, Dr. Owens looks over some soil samples from one of the local farms.  Nothing seems amiss from the surface, but when a lab tech places a flame under one of the samples, it sparks a reaction from all of the samples on the table in front of them.\rAt the Ives household, Eleven is given a homemade blindfold and her aunt watches as she sits to contact her mother.  She very quickly finds herself in the blackness and moves forward to speak to her mother.  This time, she tells her mother she's home, but her mother grabs her and tells her 'no'.  She watches as her mother brings her through a flashback of the day she was born.  That day, she was removed via Caesarian.  When her mother woke up and demanded to see her baby, she was told that she was unresponsive, though she knew that couldn't be true.  Believing Jane to be taken from her, she loaded a gun and went to the Hawkins lab.  She eventually found Jane playing in a room with another girl, but she was caught and hooked up to a shock therapy machine, soon being dealt a damaging amount of electricity.  It was enough to hinder her mental capacity.  As Eleven discovers, her mother's mumblings are the repeated sights and sounds of what her brain experiences, on a loop, from the events in the flashback. \n"}, {"text": "Who joins Joyce in the tunnels beneath Hawkins to search for Hopper?", "correct": "Bob", "options": ["Mike", "Will", "Jonathan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob.\n\n\tJoyce, Bob, Will, and Mike drive out to the spot Bob figured was right and Will quickly informs the others that they need to turn right to find Hopper; he sees him in his 'now-memories'.  Sure enough, when they veer off the road they nearly crash into Hopper's truck.  Joyce tells the boys to stay in the truck as she descends into the hole Hopper dug to find writhing vines.  She uses the shovel left behind to puncture a way in and has Bob drop her inside before he follows. \r Grabbing a flashlight, they advance down the tunnels, finding Hopper's cigarettes and tracking them through Will's map.\rWill and Mike wait up on the surface together, but while this happens, several white vans pull up.\rJoyce eventually spots Hopper's arm under the vines in the tunnel and they hack at the Upside-Down's flora with a knife to keep it at bay.  As they turn to leave, a man in a fire suit urges them to get out as he lights a flamethrower and begins to set the tunnel ablaze.\rNone of them in the tunnel see what effect this has on Will who, as soon as the tunnel lights up, begins to seize on the ground, clearly in terrible pain. \n"}]}
