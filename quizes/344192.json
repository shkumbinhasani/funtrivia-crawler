{"id": "344192", "name": "Spelling It Out - \"Skyward Sword\" Quiz / Test  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Skyward Sword"], "questions": [{"text": "The fifth major dungeon of the game takes place on a pirate ship.  What is the name of this Bokoblin-infested location where Link receives the Bow?", "correct": "Sandship", "options": ["Shipyard", "Fire Sanctuary", "Pirate Retreat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSandship.\n\n\tThe Sandship is found after a lengthy ride around the Lanayru Sand Sea in a smaller dinghy alongside a robot captain.  This trip will take you to the captain's old roost for a sea chart, the Shipyards, and the pirate hideout before heading out to the open 'sand sea' to locate the invisible dungeon.  Once Link hops aboard he'll be able to navigate the insides of the ship (all the way up to the crow's nest) to find a Bow, open the boss door, fight the boss, Tentalus, and imbue his sword with the powers of Nayru's Flame. Like the earlier Mining Facility, the Sandship makes use of a stone that flips it back and forth between past and present; it's on the mast. \n"}, {"text": "Defeated by the Gust Bellows and Link's sword, what large enemy jumps around the room despite a lack of appendages?", "correct": "Armos", "options": ["Fire Chuchus", "Beamos", "Keese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArmos.\n\n\tThe Gust Bellows is key to defeating these large enemies.  Although in earlier games, Armos were defeated using explosives and heavy weaponry (Megaton Hammer, anyone?) \"Skyward Sword\" reinvents this foe, placing a pinwheel on its top which requires that Link use the Gust Bellows.  This will, in turn, open the front and back of an Armos, freezing it in place so that you can sword the two gems inside. One can be slashed, the other must be pierced since it's set deeper into the enemy.  Because they require the Gust Bellows to be defeated, they, like Beamos, are first found in the Lanayru Mining Facility. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the female guardian who accompanies Zelda from dungeon to dungeon?", "correct": "Impa", "options": ["Aryll", "Sheik", "Tetra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nImpa.\n\n\tImpa, who was also Zelda's guardian in \"Ocarina of Time\", saves Zelda when she plummets to the surface world and takes her along to complete her side of the journey.  This involves traveling to each of the first three dungeons.  Link will find both of them at each location (Faron Woods' springs, for example) and a short dialogue will be held. After completing the Lanayru Mining Facility, Link will witness Impa battling the Demon Lord, Ghirahim, before taking Zelda with her into another realm.  Link will need to visit the Isle of Songs shortly thereafter in order to power up his sword and save Zelda once and for all. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these enemies is likely to drop the Lizard Tail?", "correct": "Lizalfos", "options": ["Bokoblins", "Dinofols", "Mogmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLizalfos.\n\n\tLizalfos make a debut in the Earth Sanctuary on Eldin Volcano although their earliest appearance was in \"Ocarina of Time's\" Dodongo's Cavern.  Lizalfos in \"Skyward Sword\", however, have a one-up ability to block sword hits with a single arm protector covered in spikes.  Besides hitting you with a spiky tail or their fire breath, they can also leap at you or swat with the arm bar.  Most of the time, Lizalfos come in pairs (though not always).  Most of the time, they also drop Lizard Tails, items which can be used for upgrades in Skyloft's Bazaar. \n"}, {"text": "Link receives a pair of these after completing the second Silent Realm Trial.  What items would these be?", "correct": "Clawshots", "options": ["Fireshield Earrings", "Digging Mitts", "Water Dragon Scales"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClawshots.\n\n\tIf Link is able to overcome the trials of the Silent Real in each of the three major locations of the game, he'll receive a gift from the old gods, Farore, Nayru, and Din.  Farore's Trial in the Faron Woods results in the Water Dragon Scale, allowing him to swim, Nayru's Trial will give him the two Clawshots in Lanayru Desert, and Eldin Volcano is home to Din's Trial (resulting in the Fireshield Earrings).  The Clawshots allow Link to grip onto far-away targets, vine walls, or enemies and drag himself across to them. In earlier games, this would equate to the Hookshot, Longshot, or Grappling Hook. You'll need to have beaten the Ancient Cistern to get these. \n"}, {"text": "In which region of the game does Link find a mine and a gorge?", "correct": "Lanayru", "options": ["Eldin", "The Sky", "Faron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLanayru.\n\n\tLanayru is the final major area visited in the game (of the three areas on the surface).  Once a huge sea, the land has wasted away into a desert.  After completing the Earth Sanctuary Link will drop down near Lanayru Mine and head through to the desert proper to find the third dungeon, a Mining Facility.  Later in the game, the fifth dungeon (the Sandship) can be found on the Lanayru Sand Sea, and a gorge can be found deeper into the area.  Link will inevitably find ways to return the land to its verdant state, at least temporarily. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these 'macabre' dropped treasures is used to upgrade shields and satchels?", "correct": "Ornamental Skulls", "options": ["Golden Skulls", "Evil Crystals", "Monster Horns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrnamental Skulls.\n\n\tOrnamental Skulls are important items dropped throughout the game, particularly by Bokoblins (though you can find them from Sheikah Stones).  These skulls, although discomfortingly odd, can be used to upgrade your shield, certain bags, and your Beetle in the Skyloft Bazaar.  These aren't the only ingredients though-- you'll need several others (and some Rupees) to be able to upgrade.  Golden Skulls can also be found throughout the game and are used for later upgrades, but they're much rarer to find in combat.  Some can be found in chests across the land. \n"}, {"text": "Hitting one of these objects will cause it to emit a radius that gets sent back in time.  What is the name of this purple device?", "correct": "Timeshift Stone", "options": ["Owl Statue", "Deku Seed", "Sheikah Stone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTimeshift Stone.\n\n\tTimeshift Stones can be found in the Lanayru area and Link first encounters them in the mine proper, hitting them to progress through caverns of quicksand and to use mine carts.  These items continue to play a major role in navigating the Lanayru Desert, the Mining Facility, and the Sand Sea.  In fact, the latter half of the Sandship dungeon requires that Link activate and deactivate a Timeshift Stone throughout with the Bow.  Timeshift Stones can be struck with seeds, swords, arrows, clawshots, and the beetle, just as any of the crystal switches can throughout the game. \n"}, {"text": "What musical instrument is given to Link after completing the Mining Facility dungeon?", "correct": "Harp", "options": ["Ocarina", "Lute", "Kazoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarp.\n\n\tThe Goddess' Harp was originally played by Zelda during the Wing Ceremony ritual and she brings it along with her while visiting the shrines hidden in each of the first three dungeons of the game.  When Link catches up to her at the end of the Lanayru Mining Facility she'll pass it off to him, informing him that he'll need it in his own journey quite soon. Heading to the Isle of Songs he'll learn how to access the next area in Faron Woods.  The harp can be played by pressing up on the Wii Remote pad; it's strummed by holding A and waving the remote back and forth, almost as though plucking an actual harp. \n"}, {"text": "What nine-letter location, character, enemy, or item is spelled out with the first letter of the previous nine answers?", "correct": "Sailcloth", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSailcloth.\n\n\tThe Sailcloth is one of the earliest items added to Link's inventory.  Handed off to him after the Wing Ceremony by Zelda herself, the Sailcloth is used to prevent Link from falling and injuring/killing himself (to put it lightly).  If he falls off a high perch he can use the Sailcloth by pressing B while falling to deploy it like a parachute.  The same works when Link is dropping down to the surface from above.  The Sailcloth is an item which previously appeared in \"Wind Waker\" though in that title it served its purpose as an actual sail for the King of Red Lions. \n"}]}
