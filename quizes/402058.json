And now the petals. Blue. The odd white one. Interesting - the supporters will be glad to see a bit of variety in this painting.\n\nWhich type of flower (matching the commentary) did Van Gogh paint in 1889?", "correct": "Irises", "options": ["Heather", "Amaryllis", "Callistemon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIrises.\n\n\tVincent Van Gogh painted \"Irises\" while he was staying at a mental institution in  Saint-Remy in France. The painting depicts a patch of blue/purple irises with one white flower. Japanese woodblock prints are often credited as his inspiration for his study of flowers and his technique. Some of the petals are outlined in black, which was a feature of the 17th century Japanese art he admired. In 1987 the painting was the most expensive piece of art to be auctioned in the world: at the time, it sold for $53.9 million. \n"}, {"text": "The birds are out on the field; we're just waiting for kick-off. Looks like there's a storm on the horizon. Hopefully it doesn't interfere too much with the game. The whistle blows and they're off! It's a race to the sky! Who will be first over the finish line?\n\nWhich 1890 Van Gogh painting featured birds against a stormy sky?", "correct": "Wheatfield with Crows", "options": ["The Yellow House", "The Red Vineyard", "Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWheatfield with Crows.\n\n\tPossibly one of the last paintings he created, Van Gogh's \"Wheatfield with Crows\" is a dramatic work of art. The sky is deep blue against a yellow field of wheat. A flock of V-shaped crows look as though they have been startled and are taking off into the storm. When writing about the painting, Van Gogh described the sky and his desire to make \"a point of trying to express sadness, extreme loneliness\". At the same time, he tried to depict what he considered \"healthy and fortifying about the countryside\". \n"}, {"text": "Visibility is good today. The sky's clear blue - not a cloud in sight. It really makes those pale flowers stand out. The branches are looking a bit bumpy but that's to be expected. There's nothing artificial here. It's a natural stunner!\n\nWhat did Van Gogh paint for his new-born nephew in 1890?", "correct": "Almond Blossom", "options": ["The Old Guitarist", "At Eternity's Gate", "The Blue Boy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlmond Blossom.\n\n\tTheo Van Gogh, Vincent's younger brother, married a woman named Joanna. They named their son Vincent after Theo's brother. The painter created \"Almond Blossom\" as a gift for the new-born child. Like \"Irises\", Van Gogh made use of Japanese techniques, such as dark outlines and bold, contrasting colours. It was not the first time he had painted this particular plant. In 1888, he created a series of paintings depicting small branches growing in a jar, like \"Blossoming Almond in a Glass\".\r \"The Blue Boy\" was a painting by Thomas Gainsborough and \"The Old Guitarist\" was by Pablo Picasso. \n"}, {"text": "We're in Auvers and the grey brushstrokes are surging up, carefully negotiating the stained-glass windows. Now, can they make it on to the roof? They're up and over! And look at the clock! No time at all!\n\nWhich medieval building in Auvers did Van Gogh paint in 1890?", "correct": "A church", "options": ["A leisure centre", "A police station", "A universtiy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA church.\n\n\tThe Church at Auvers was painted in 1890 and depicts the grey church building against a deep blue sky. Van Gogh wrote about the painting in a letter to his sister, saying that the \"stained-glass windows appear as ultramarine blotches\" and the sandy path around the church has the \"pink flow of sunshine\" on it. While the church tower does have a clock, the painted face is blank. The building was one of many that Van Gogh painted while in Auvers, a village north of Paris. \n"}, {"text": "We're back on the river in Arles and what a night it is! The gas lamps are burning and the yellow stars are bursting out of the sky. The couple on the bank cannot believe their eyes!\n\nWhich landscape did Van Gogh paint in 1888?", "correct": "Starry Night over the Rhone", "options": ["The Mulberry Tree in Autumn", "The Hay Wain", "Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStarry Night over the Rhone.\n\n\tVincent Van Gogh was intrigued by the effects of light at night and viewed painting it as a challenge. Around the same time as creating \"Starry Night over the Rhone\", he painted a few different pieces with the night sky as a main component. The gas lamps that lit the quayside were a relatively new invention and their reflection in the river in this painting is mesmerising.\r John Constable painted \"The Hay Wain\" and \"Rain, Steam and Speed\" while \"The Great Western Railway\" was by J.M.W. Turner. \n"}, {"text": "Blue door comes in, crosses to red tiled floor. Onions at the back but straw seat charges in front.\n\nIn 1888, which painting did Van Gogh create to accompany \"Gauguin's Chair\"?", "correct": "Van Gogh's Chair", "options": ["Vase with Poppies", "Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy", "The Starry Night"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVan Gogh's Chair.\n\n\t\"Gauguin's Chair\" and \"Van Gogh's Chair\" were both painted around the same time in 1888. Van Gogh was an admirer of Paul Gauguin's work and invited the artist to stay with him in Arles. He hoped that they would work together and inspire each other. Things didn't go to plan. The relationship became strained and after the infamous incident with a razor (Van Gogh severed part of his ear), Gaugin left Arles for good.The two paintings of chairs symbolise the differences between the two artists. \"Gauguin's Chair\" is full of bold, rich colours. \"Van Gogh's Chair\" is a simple kitchen chair with a pipe and a screwed-up piece of paper resting on the seat. \n"}, {"text": "The team of five have entered the arena. There's a hush of anticipation here - the crowd are holding their breath. The food's on the table and the coffee's been poured. Who will be first to pick up their fork?\n\nWhich Van Gogh painting featured five people, coffee, and a plate of food?", "correct": "The Potato Eaters", "options": ["Basket of Bread", "The Peasant Wedding", "Apples and Oranges"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Potato Eaters.\n\n\tVincent Van Gogh viewed \"The Potato Eaters\" as a masterpiece that would set off his career in 1885. A preliminary sketch of the painting was sent to art dealers to advertise the artist's plans. Writing to Theo (his brother who was an art dealer), Van Gogh specified the type of background the painting should be displayed on: \"it's a painting that looks well in gold... it would do equally well on a wall hung with a paper that had a deep tone of ripe wheat\". Unfortunately, the painting received much criticism at the time and was only considered a true masterpiece after the artist's death.\r \"The Peasant Wedding\" was a painting by Pieter Bruegel and Salvador Dali created \"Basket of Bread\". \"Apples and Oranges\" was painted by Paul Cezanne. \n"}, {"text": "They think it's all over - it is now. The only thing left is smouldering tobacco.\n\nWhich painting did Van Gogh create while studying at an art school in Antwerp in 1886?", "correct": "Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette", "options": ["The Night Caf\u00e9", "Dogs Playing Poker", "Man Smoking a Pipe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette.\n\n\t\"Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette\" was probably painted while Van Gogh was studying at an art academy in Antwerp. The instructors often used skeletons to teach about anatomy. Some consider the cigarette in a skeleton's mouth a joke, while others think it is a comment on the lifelessness of the subject that students had to draw at the school.\r Kenneth Wolstenholme was a football commentator who famously said, \"They think it's all over. It is now,\" at the end of the 1966 World Cup Final when England had beaten West Germany. \"Man Smoking a Pipe\" was a painting by Paul Cezanne. \"Dogs Playing Poker\" was a series of paintings by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge. \n"}, {"text": "Yellow meets blue out on the street today. A crowd has gathered under the awning to watch the night unfold.\n\nWhich establishment did Van Gogh paint at night in 1888?", "correct": "A cafe", "options": ["A post office", "A zoo", "A dentist's surgery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cafe.\n\n\t\"Cafe Terrace at Night\" was painted in 1888. In the picture, there are people sitting under an awning outside a cafe. They are lit up by the orange light of the gas lamps - a contrast to the deep blue of the night sky behind them. Van Gogh most likely set his easel up in the street, rather than painting from memory. Astronomical data suggests that the position of the stars in the painting is correct. \n"}, {"text": "Of all the colours to choose from, only one is important here: yellow. A dash of green. Where will the paintbrush go? The stems weave upwards, heading for the sun. Touchdown!\n\nWhich yellow plant did Van Gogh paint multiple times between 1887 and 1889?", "correct": "Sunflower", "options": ["Indian shot", "Banana plant", "Buttercup"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSunflower.\n\n\tSome of Van Gogh's most famous paintings are of sunflowers. While in Paris in 1887, he created a series of sunflower paintings where the flowers were arranged on a surface. When he revisited the plant in 1888 and '89, he painted sunflowers that were arranged in a vase instead. In preparation of Paul Gaugin's arrival to the Yellow House in Arles, Van Gogh intended to decorate the whole studio with pictures of sunflowers. \n"}]}
