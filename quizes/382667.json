{"id": "382667", "name": "\"The Flea and the Acrobat\" Quiz / Test | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stranger Things"], "questions": [{"text": "Hopper is able to break into the restricted area of the Hawkins lab, but to do so he needs which of the following?", "correct": "Keycard", "options": ["Fingerprint", "Fire", "Paperclip"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeycard.\n\n\tAt the Byers house, Lonnie pours Joyce a drink and suggests that maybe everything is in her head.  The hole in the front of the house is covered by a tarp.\rHopper breaks into the lab compound after hours and simply heads through the unlocked front door, making it inside and hiding from any scientists passing through.  He makes his way through the quarantined biohazard entry and to a keycard-locked door before he's reached by two armed security agents.  He manages to subdue both and get through the door.  Heading through the darkened halls of the compound, he comes across a room containing children's toys and a picture on the wall.  He doesn't know it was Eleven's room. \n"}, {"text": "The boys, likening their situation to \"Dungeons and Dragons\", theorize that Will is in which of these places?", "correct": "The Vale of Shadows", "options": ["Menzoberranzan", "Ravenloft", "The Underdark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Vale of Shadows.\n\n\tThe boys and Eleven try to make sense of Will's ham radio message and Eleven cryptically uses the word 'upside down'.  Mike thinks that maybe he's in the opposite side of Hawkins, like when Eleven flipped their \"Dungeons and Dragons\" board around.  Dustin likens it to the Vale of Shadows.  Checking Mike's role-playing materials, Dustin reads that the Vale of Shadows \"is a dimension that is a dark reflection or an echo of our world.  It's a place of decay and death.\"  Dustin theorizes that maybe Eleven can shadowwalk there.\rIn the lab, Hopper continues his search, shouting for Will in the dark.  He's pursued by guards, but he makes it to the elevator before they can get him.  In the basement, he finds the wall of alien matter, walking up and putting his hand to it before something moves behind him.  It's a guard; Hopper is subdued and sedated. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Hopper find the bug in his house?", "correct": "Ceiling light", "options": ["Smoke detector", "Couch", "Fridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCeiling light.\n\n\tJonathan returns home to find Joyce and Lonnie drinking together.  Taking a look at the hole in the wall, he asks about the thing without a face that she saw earlier but Lonnie takes him aside and urges him not to give in and support his mother's nonsensical delusions.\rThe next morning, Mike and his family get dressed for Will's funeral.  The Byers do the same but struggle all the more.  Before they know it, the coffin is being lowered into the ground.\rHopper wakes up at home to find his coffee table littered with pills and alcohol.  Grabbing his gun he immediately runs outside.  Working quickly, he searches his home for bugs and wires, tearing the place apart in a paranoid state.  He finds it in his ceiling light. \n"}, {"text": "To explain the concept of other dimensions, Mr. Clark draws which of these?", "correct": "An aerialist on a tightrope", "options": ["A flea on a dog's back", "A sponge", "A mirror"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn aerialist on a tightrope.\n\n\tJonathan and Nancy deduce that whatever's out there attacking people is staying within a mile radius in the woods, so it makes sense to go out there, hunt it down, and kill it.  Heading into his glove compartment he grabs a pistol.\rAt the school, the principal calls in the Hawkins Power Company to determine the issues with the frazzled ham radio which, after causing the fire drill and burning out, has become a bit odd.  What he doesn't know is the ties that the serviceman has with the Hawkins lab.\rAt the wake, the boys speak to Mr. Clark, trying to get a bit of info out of him about other dimensions or parallel universes.  He knows all about the Vale of Shadows and explains that while an aerialist can walk on a tightrope, a flea could walk on all sides of the rope.  To go on the other side of the rope they would need to, theoretically, muster up the energy to rip a hole in time and space.  It's just not that easy. \n"}, {"text": "Where was Barb's car found?", "correct": "A bus station", "options": ["In a ditch", "Across the country", "In the quarry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA bus station.\n\n\tHopper's men head out to his place to check in on him and find him a bit out of sorts.  They let him know that a woman came out to the station earlier to report her husband and his friend for going missing.  They were last said to be hunting out in the woods near where the Byers kid disappeared.  Hopper plans to do this one alone.  They also let him know that Barb's car was found outside a bus station and the state troopers are claiming she ran away.\rLonnie starts sealing up the hole in the wall and has already taken down some of Joyce's lights.  He says he blames the company responsible for the gorge since there were no warning signs up.  Joyce is a little surprised he's even around. \n"}, {"text": "Who discovers the issues with the compasses in Hawkins?", "correct": "Dustin", "options": ["Mr. Clark", "Lucas", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDustin.\n\n\tThe boys ask Eleven about the potential gate to the Vale of Shadows when Dustin discovers something interesting involving compasses.  Using his own, he discovers that there's a strong electromagnetic force at play around them, leading all of their compasses off true north.  Considering Mr. Clark's discussion on parallel universes, all they need to do is follow their compasses to wherever they say is north, and they should find the gate.\rJoyce, meanwhile, goes through Lonnie's things and decides that, perhaps, he's really only around to capitalize on Will's death.  In his bag is a flyer for a lawyer specializing in accidental death.\rNancy practices wielding a bat when Steve comes by for a visit.  She turns down his offer to go out for a movie. \n"}, {"text": "Where has Jonathan wanted to go to school since he was six years old?", "correct": "NYU", "options": ["Indiana State", "Harvard", "Berkeley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNYU.\n\n\tJoyce calls out Lonnie for lying to her and coming out to exploit Will's death and, enraged, kicks him out of the house since it's clear that he doesn't actually care about the family.\rJonathan, meanwhile, heads out to fire his pistol and practice his aim, shooting at cans.  Nancy meets him out at his makeshift range and, taking the pistol from him after a quick chat, fires at a can, hitting it with the first shot.\rHopper, facing his own struggles, calls his ex-wife and explains that he doesn't regret anything that happened when they were together.  He hangs up before she can respond.  As he heads out, the phone rings; he rips it out of the wall. \n"}, {"text": "Eleven is capable of manipulating magnetic fields.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe boys follow their compasses through the woods which, coincidentally, take them down the train tracks.  Eleven recalls, during their walk, of a time she was asked to use her powers across an even greater distance, listening in on someone far outside the labs, but doing so from within a sensory deprivation tank.  She tells Mike they should turn back.  The boys end up heading back towards home and, as it turns out, Eleven has been manipulating the magnetic field around them to point north in a circle, trying to get them to avoid danger.\rJoyce answers the door at her house to find Hopper there with a sign saying 'Don't say anything'.  He plans to check for bugs, but he's a bit stuck; her entire house contains lights.  They have no choice but to check each one. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Eleven end up knocking out during a fight?", "correct": "Lucas", "options": ["Dustin", "Mike", "Troy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLucas.\n\n\tHopper deduces that they'll be okay when he doesn't find any bugs in Joyce's Christmas lights and he explains everything.  The body in the morgue was a fake and she was right all along.\rLucas and Mike start to fight since Lucas believes Eleven is misleading them, and has been the whole time since she could've told them where Will went long ago, and she's probably leaving him to die.  Mike and Lucas start to fight each other but Eleven angrily puts an end to it, using her telekinesis to throw Lucas across the yard, knocking him out.\rEleven remembers her sensory deprivation experiment.  She found her target, a Russian man, and successfully transmitted his speech through the intercoms of the lab.  But while she was there, in another place, something else found her.\rLucas wakes up and leaves, but when Mike and Dustin look around, they notice Eleven is missing. \n"}, {"text": "What do Jonathan and Nancy find in the woods?", "correct": "A deer", "options": ["A corpse", "A rabbit", "Clothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA deer.\n\n\tThe sun begins to set and, soon, it's dark in the woods.  Jonathan and Nancy, still searching for whatever may be out in the forest, stop when Nancy hears something.  Following the sound, they head through the trees and point their flashlight at a dying deer which appears to have been hit by a car.  Both agree that they can't leave it and they consider using the gun to put it out of its misery. Before they can do it though, something abruptly drags the deer into the bushes.  Afraid, but undeterred, the two of them head deeper but find nothing... until Nancy spies a hole in a tree, dripping with something. She kneels to investigate and yells for Jonathan but he doesn't respond.  Instead of waiting, she quietly crawls in, finding the hole to go deeper than she imagined...and emerging on the other side to find a forest similar to the one she was in.  Her flashlight starts to flicker on and off until she sees the creature in the distance, feeding on the deer.  She screams and Jonathan hears her, but he only finds her backpack on the ground as the tree closes itself shut. \n"}]}
