{"id": "343072", "name": "A Novel of a Quiz | Physical Geography | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Physical Geography", "Mountains & Volcanoes"], "questions": [{"text": "It was a long and hard climb, but I had finally made it to the mountaintop. As I stared down, I wondered how I ever made it to the mountaintop. The mountaintop was almost 30,000 feet above sea level, after all.\n\nHmm, perhaps I have overused the word \"mountaintop\". Which of these words is an equivalent term for \"mountaintop\"?", "correct": "Apex", "options": ["The Tippity Top", "Asterix", "Base"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApex.\n\n\tA mountaintop can also be called a summit, a peak, an apex, an acme, and sometimes even considered a \"zenith\".\r Acme (admit it, you can't get Wile E. Coyote out of your head now) can also mean a mountaintop or the best of something. \n"}, {"text": "When I reached the top, I found a local shelter.  This is where I stayed warm for the night. During the night however, I heard some screeching. The locals told me stories of a great beast who lived in these mountains.  They called it \"The Yeti\".\n\nIt is fairly common knowledge that Mount Everest is in the Himalayan Mountains.  However, what section of the Himalayas contains Everest?", "correct": "Mahalangur", "options": ["Pamir Knot", "Karakoram", "Hindu Kush"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMahalangur.\n\n\tThe Mahalangur sub-range of the Himalayas contains Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain.\r The Himalayas are the tallest mountain range in the world. In fact, the tallest mountain outside of this range is Mount Aconcagua at just under 7,000 meters tall. The Himalayan Mountains, however, contain over 100 mountains over 7,200 meters tall. \n"}, {"text": "The yeti. I'd heard of it. I remembered learning about it in my Cryptozoology Studies while in Oxford. I didn't believe it existed but the locals' stories had begun to convince me.\n\nI keep referring to the people of Nepal as \"locals\". Perhaps, to make things more interesting, I'll mention the city they are from. Which of these is a city of Nepal?", "correct": "Biratnagar", "options": ["Chongqing", "Yangon", "Erdenet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBiratnagar.\n\n\tBiratnagar is the second largest city in Nepal, right behind its capital Kathmandu. Biratnagar means \"Huge City\" in Nepalese.\r Yangon (also called Rangoon) is a former capital of Myanmar (then Burma).  Chongqing is a city in China, Erdenet is the second largest city of Mongolia, behind its capital, Ulan Bator (Ulaanbataar). \n"}, {"text": "Someone had eavesdropped on my conversation with one local man and began to speak up. \"The yeti. I came here looking for that creature.\" Upon further discussion I learned that he was a scientist from one of the core wards of Tokyo.\n\nWhich of these special wards of Tokyo is not considered one of the \"core wards\"?", "correct": "Suginami", "options": ["Chiyoda", "Minato", "Chuo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuginami.\n\n\tTokyo is split into a total of 26 sub-cities as well as 23 special wards. Of these wards, three are considered Tokyo's \"core wards\". These are Chiyoda, Chuo, and Minato. \n"}, {"text": "I was now intrigued by this so-called \"yeti\", and I had to investigate. I agreed to help. \"Great, we'll head off first thing in the morning; five o'clock sharp.\" Bleh. I was not a morning person. Still, I agreed, and the next day we packed up our equipment and headed down the mountain.\n\nLocal sherpas know the Yeti by many names.  Which of these is not such a name for the abominable snowman, as it is a name used for a local type of bear?", "correct": "Dzu-teh", "options": ["Meh-teh", "Mirka", "Migoi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDzu-teh.\n\n\tThe dzu-teh is another name for the Himalayan brown bear, which is indigenous to the region.  It is often mistaken for the Yeti from a distance.\r Other names for the Yeti include, but are not limited to: abominable snowman, meh-teh, migoi, mirka, mi-go, kang admi, and JoBran.\r The yeti is often depicted on television and film as a large white ape with short fur.  However, the definition of the yeti from locals who claim to have seen it are much different.  According to stories, it is actually brown and orange in color, similar to that of an orangutan (which means \"man ape\" or \"man of the forest). Furthermore, it actually has rather long fur.\r A yeti's skeleton hand was once supposedly on display in a Pangboche, Nepal monastery, but was later stolen. A replica of the skeleton was made and put in its place in 2011.  When the hand was first discovered, tests showed that the hand was perhaps ape-like, but was a closer match to a Neanderthal. \n"}, {"text": "It was nearly a full day's journey to our first marker. Though it was still early in the evening, we set up camp in an abandoned cave. I was told it got cold in the night, so we couldn't stay out long during the day. The den proved to be a very useful shelter.\n\nBesides the extreme cold, Mount Everest has several other deadly risks associated with it.  Which of these is NOT one of the threats of Everest?", "correct": "Extremely difficult and rocky terrain", "options": ["High altitude that causes altitude sickness", "Heavy snow fall and blizzards", "Very strong winds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExtremely difficult and rocky terrain.\n\n\tMount Everest does not pose many dangers as far as the terrain goes; it is actually a relatively easy climb compared to its neighboring peaks. However, the extreme height of Everest causes breathing difficulties, due to lack of oxygen, and can also cause severe altitude sickness. The strong, icy winds can also be quite a hazard. Many lives have also been lost due to large blizzards and freezing cold snow.\r Though thousands have successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest, the mountain has still claimed the lives of hundreds. Weather conditions are so difficult in Mount Everest's \"death zone\" that people who die in the area, for whatever reason that may be, are simply left there.  While people use common climbing routes up the mountain, others' corpses can be easily seen. \n"}, {"text": "When I awoke, I discovered the man I was with (who had yet to tell me his name) was already up and working. He seemed to be using a device to listen to something, but I heard nothing. When he saw me, he told me that our location was not capturing any yeti sounds, and we had to move. We left our warm den and continued our trek across the massive mountain.\n\nSpeaking of massive mountains, perhaps I could mention the local name of Everest, just to give the story a little flair. By what other name is Mount Everest known?", "correct": "Chomolungma", "options": ["Lhotse", "Sewalungma", "Kangchengjunga"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChomolungma.\n\n\tMount Everest has a few other names, including Peak XV (English name before it was called \"Everest\"), Chomolungma, Qomolungma, and Sagarmatha.\r Lhotse is the fourth largest mountain in the world, and is also located in the Himalayas.  Sewalungma is another name for Kangchengjunga, which is the third largest mountain in the world, also in the Himalayan mountain range.  K2, or Savage Mountain, is the second tallest; and you guessed it, in the Himalayas. \n"}, {"text": "I had troubles not slipping on the frozen ground as we journeyed across the mountain but my biggest trouble was when I stepped on ice and heard a crack.  Suddenly, the solid ground below us collapsed and we found ourselves at the bottom of a giant crack in the mountain. We were deep in the hole.\n\nThe crack was formed from an ice sheet on Everest. What was this crack called?", "correct": "Crevasse", "options": ["Craving Chocolate", "Cravat", "Craven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrevasse.\n\n\tA crevasse is a crack in an ice sheet, normally found on glaciers. Typically, a crack in rock such as one on Everest would be considered a crevice. However, if the crack is formed in an ice sheet on the mountain, it would be a crevasse.\r But does it really matter what you call it?  Both of them are giant holes in the ground that you might not ever escape from should you fall into it. \n"}, {"text": "Though we were in a hole and the top seems a million miles away from me, the scientist did not seem to worry. Instead, he went over to a column of ice created by two intersecting cracks in the surface.\n\nThese ice formations actually have their own name. What name do they go by?", "correct": "Serac", "options": ["Ricotta", "Gouda", "Fromage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSerac.\n\n\tThese ice formations actually get their name from the Swiss-French word \"serac\", which is a cheese similar to ricotta. The serac is formed by intersecting crevasses but they do pose a danger to climbers. These seracs are weak (they were formed by cracks in the surface, after all), and may crumble or fall over without warning. \n"}, {"text": "Fortunately for me, the scientist was prepared in case we ever fell in a crack such as this.  He pulled out some icepicks and we scaled the walls until we were out of the hole.  When we got out, my extreme thirst began kicking in. I started to eat some snow, but Ming (as I have now learned his name) batted it away and told me not to eat it.\n\nWhat gives?  I can eat snow for water, can't I? Is it a good idea to eat snow or ice in cold climates to stay hydrated?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIt is highly recommended never to eat fresh snow as a source of water.  Though one might assume that, since snow is water, it should hydrate the body, this is false.  The cold temperature of ice and snow actually has the opposite effect and dehydrates you. Also, typically, where you find snow, it's cold. Eating the snow will make your body even colder than the air makes it and hypothermia becomes a major issue. Finally, though it might look white and pure, snow can be very dirty and full of bacteria. Therefore, it is best to purify the water by boiling it.\r Only after boiling the water may you drink it.  This will rehydrate you without causing hypothermia or spreading bacteria. \n"}]}
