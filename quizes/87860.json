{"id": "87860", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Trial of Henry Blake' Multiple Choice Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "While Hawkeye and Trapper blithely play ping pong on a table fashioned with two gurneys and a string of surgical masks, Henry Blake is off to Seoul to face serious charges that could see him discharged from the army.  What is the name of the General who heads the hearing for Henry's case? ", "correct": "General Mitchell", "options": ["General Phillips", "General Tucker", "General Simon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneral Mitchell.\n\n\tGeneral Mitchell, played by Robert F. Simon, heads a board that oversees Henry's case, to see if it is fit for a military tribunal.  Who has brought these charges against Henry?  Naturally, Majors Burns and Houlihan...shocking, isn't it? \n"}, {"text": "The first charge against Henry is that he participated in a 'Kentucky Derby Day' in which betting occurred over a race using gurneys.  Which of these entrants was the winner of this madcap gurney race?", "correct": "Gal-O-War", "options": ["Bouncing Betty", "Girl Away", "Hawk's Pride"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGal-O-War.\n\n\tGal-O-War was manned by Trapper, while Hawkeye was the driver of Hawk's Pride.  The most memorable aspect of this scene was Henry's great call of the race...Bouncing Betty! \n"}, {"text": "Next charge:  an enlisted man, namely Radar, was engaged in the selling of high-style wingtip shoes.  From which company did Radar acquire these shoes?", "correct": "Style Right Shoe Company", "options": ["Easy Does It Shoe Company", "Flashy Toes Shoe Company", "Walk Fancy Shoe Company"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStyle Right Shoe Company.\n\n\tThe Style Right Shoe Company operates out of Storm Lake, Iowa, Radar's home state.  He discovered this scheme off the back of a matchbook and proceded to become the greatest shoe salesman in M*A*S*H history...by the end of the episode, every member of the camp is wearing the shoes. \n"}, {"text": "Radar's second shoe sales victim is Hawkeye (Klinger is the first, but that part has been cut out of the syndicated version).  During his sales pitch, Radar uses all of the cliches in the book, suggesting that he is an inexperienced and naive shoe salesman.  Before sitting down to 'fit' Hawkeye, Radar looks around the Swamp and says, 'Oh, uh...nice place you got here!'  How does Hawkeye respond?", "correct": "It's cruddy, but it's home.", "options": ["Thank you, did you meet our pet rat?", "Well, home is where the heap is.", "There's no place like home, except maybe the garbage dump."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's cruddy, but it's home.\n\n\tAmusing answer, but I think my alternate choices would have also been acceptable, don't you?  Incidentally, despite Radar's very poor abilities as a salesman, he somehow manages to sell a pair to Hawkeye...who can resist that cute little Radar? \n"}, {"text": "Charge three:  Henry is accused of allowing a member of the camp to dress as a transvestite...namely, Klinger.  The scene switches to Klinger, who has managed to construct a crude hang-glider with red fabric.  While smooching a nurse, Hawkeye and Trapper notice Klinger gliding on by, and both describe him as a 'big red bird with fuzzy ____ feet.'  Which color goes in the blank?", "correct": "Pink", "options": ["Blue", "Purple", "Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPink.\n\n\tThe line is repeated one more time by a Henry during the hearing while describing Klinger who was found 2 miles from camp, laying in an unconscious condition.  General Mitchell then asks, 'Colonel, what did you think about Klinger's attempt to desert the United States Army?'  To which Henry replies, 'Frankly sir, I think he might have made it if he'd have had a better tailwind!' \n"}, {"text": "The final charge includes two items, lending aid and comfort to the enemy and what?", "correct": "Falsifying records", "options": ["Extorting money from the officers at the camp", "Illegally shipping U.S. Army materials home", "Embezzlement of U.S. Army funds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalsifying records.\n\n\tThese charges end up being false, of course.  Henry was helping out a clinic run by nurse Meg Cratty (see below), which was situated 3 miles north of the 38th parallel but was working on assisting refugees. \n"}, {"text": "After Radar returns to camp, distraught over the arrest of Henry Blake, he is discovered by Hawkeye and Trapper doing what very Radar-like thing, especially in a time of crisis?", "correct": "Stuffing his face", "options": ["Reading comic books", "Curled up with his teddy bear", "Shuffling files"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStuffing his face.\n\n\tTypically in the early episodes Radar could be seen eating from a tray filled to the brim with food.  I suppose they wanted to imply that Radar was still a growing boy, but really...doesn't that army food stunt your growth? \n"}, {"text": "Before Trapper and Hawkeye can come to Henry's aide, Frank Burns arrests them and confines them to their quarters...with no clothes and no still!  When Klinger comes in to deliver their dinner, wearing a cute red shawl on his head I might add, Trapper gives him a message disguised as a prescription.  What does he say the 'prescription' is for? ", "correct": "Nasal drip", "options": ["Chronic cross-dressing", "Common cold", "Excessive body hair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNasal drip.\n\n\tOf course there has to be at least one reference to Jamie Farr's nose in each episode, and here it is!  When Trapper hands the note to Klinger, he says, 'Corporal...for nasal drip'.  Klinger replies, 'I haven't got a nasal drip.'  'Take it or I'll give you one!' Trapper retorts.  Klinger catches on and delivers the prescription, some sort of sleeping medication for the MP who is guarding Trapper and Hawkeye! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Nurse who runs the clinic above the 38th parellel to which Henry lends 'aide and comfort'?", "correct": "Meg Cratty", "options": ["Agnes Smedley", "Nora Tucker", "Helen Ramsay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeg Cratty.\n\n\tBlake sent various medical supplies to nurse Cratty's clinic and didn't even defend himself against the accusations!  It required the assistance of Hawkeye and Trapper, along with Meg Cratty (played by Hope Summers) and a pregnant Korean civilian woman who was a 'sample of Henry Blake's work'.  Of course, Henry was not the father...she was just an example of a pregnant woman who was helped by Henry's supply shipments. \n"}, {"text": "Which character delivers this line:  'That's what I meant by my yes sir, sir, yes sir, sir.'?", "correct": "Henry", "options": ["Radar", "Hawkeye", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry.\n\n\tPart of Henry's weak attempt to 'defend' himself...poor, incompetent fellow.  What a fun line though!  Thanks for taking this quiz, I hope you were able to enjoy it! \n"}]}
