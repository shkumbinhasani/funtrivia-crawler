Multiple Choice Quiz | General | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "      Alphabetics"], "questions": [{"text": "Really, we should be starting with something to ease you into the concept of RUOK- maybe something to excite your palate.  Of these selections, which is not a fruit?", "correct": "Radish", "options": ["Kiwi", "Orange", "Ugli"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadish.\n\n\tRadishes are, in fact, root vegetables and not fruits.  This is because the edible radish pieces are specifically grown to be eaten.  Fruits grow as part of the ovary of a flowering plant.\r With this in mind, the kiwi is a fruit with brown skin, but green, seeded insides.  Kiwis are typically grown in the Southern Hemisphere and Southern Europe.  New Zealand is probably one of the most common places to find them, especially since New Zealanders are commonly nicknamed 'Kiwis'.  Oranges are seeded citrus fruits with orange rinds and segmented insides.  Found all over the world, they're mostly grown in Southern Brazil and the United States.  Ugli Fruit is mainly from Jamaica and is essentially a type of tangelo.\r Radishes are pod-like roots (and thus vegetables).  Although they're grown world-wide, they're from Europe. \n"}, {"text": "Of these musical groups, which won a Grammy for the album \"How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\"?", "correct": "U2", "options": ["Radiohead", "Kings of Leon", "OK Go"], "explanation": "\n\n\nU2.\n\n\tU2, headed by Bono and the Edge, won their second Album of the Year award for \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" although it was their seventeenth Grammy overall.

OK- what is the name of the Japanese art of paper folding?", "correct": "Origami", "options": ["Usagi", "Kabuki", "Ronin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrigami.\n\n\tOrigami, the English word for a Japanese art, literally translates to 'folding paper'.  This often intricate art requires square pieces of paper, many of which are specially designed, and the result can be a frog, a crane, or many other shapes and figures.  There is an old superstition that says that the person who creates one thousand paper cranes is granted a wish.\r Kabuki is a form of Japanese theater which involves singing and dancing, usually in heavy make-up in traditional garb.  Usagi is 'rabbit' in Japanese, and Ronin is a type of Japanese warrior (almost like a samurai) without a master.  Unsurprisingly, you can craft an usagi in origami. \n"}, {"text": "Uma Thurman played 'The Bride' in which two-part Quentin Tarantino film?", "correct": "Kill Bill", "options": ["Reservoir Dogs", "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", "Unbreakable"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKill Bill.\n\n\t\"Kill Bill\" starred Thurman as Black Mamba, an assassin working under the direction of a man known solely as Bill.

David Carradine starred as Bill while the other members of his squad were played by Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, and Daryl Hannah.  Due to its length and variation in styles throughout, \"Kill Bill\" was split into two volumes.  It earned over $180,000,000 in the box office and received critical acclaim.\r Neither \"Unbreakable\" nor \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" featured either Uma Thurman in front of the camera or Quentin Tarantino behind it.  The former was directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starred Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson (both from \"Pulp Fiction\" which, coincidentally, starred Thurman and was directed by Tarantino) while the latter was directed by the Coen Brothers. \n"}, {"text": "Reading can do a lot to stimulate the mind.

A rather favourable colour, it's attributed to the flower of the same name.  Khaki (also a type of fabric), is an earthy green first used and replicated in India.
