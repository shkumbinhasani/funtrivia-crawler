{"id": "346431", "name": "\"Yes/No\" Online Trivia | 'Glee' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "In the episode's opening scene, members of the New Directions reenact a song and dance from what movie musical?", "correct": "Grease", "options": ["The Sound of Music", "Rent", "Chicago"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrease.\n\n\tWalking outside during their lunch break, the girls of New Directions (and Kurt) sit down at a table and Tina asks Mercedes about what really happened between herself and Sam during summer vacation.  Mercedes decides to tell the story; they spent a lot of time together and had a fling.  In the bleachers at the football field, Sam decides to tell the guys his side of the story as well (while wearing a leather jacket).  Unsurprisingly, this leads into a version of the \"Grease\" classic \"Summer Nights\" with Mercedes and Sam filling the roles of Sandy and Danny while the rest of New Directions backs the song. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Becky not pass by in the halls while looking for a boyfriend?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Rory", "Puck", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tIn the school, Becky Jackson psychs herself up in her mind (with a British accent) and follows her own internal monologue through the halls on the hunt for a boyfriend.  She passes by Rory, who she thinks grins too much and looks insane, Puck, who she doesn't like because his mohawk looks like a squirrel was glued to his head, and Mike, who isn't her type (\"No-Chang-do; I'm no rice queen.\")  She decides on Artie, who's sweet, sexy, and handicapable like her. When she asks Sue for a bit of guidance on the subject, she suggests that Becky should ask him out on a date, but frankly she can do better. \n"}, {"text": "Who suggests to Emma that she propose to Will?", "correct": "Sue", "options": ["Rachel", "Coach Beiste", "Her mother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSue.\n\n\tIn the teacher's lounge, Emma decides to sit with Beiste instead of Will and she discovers that the school's football coach has eloped with her boyfriend, Cooter Menkins, over the holidays and (while at a Taco Bell) they decided to get hitched, go to a twenty-four hour chapel, and become husband and wife. Sue is shocked; this is why he hasn't been returning her calls for weeks.  Emma worries because she thinks Will doesn't want to marry her and Sue recommends that she be the one to ask him-- it's 2012 after all.  Emma (with Sue and Beiste backing) sings The 5th Dimension's \"Wedding Bell Blues\", fantasizing about marriage with Will. By the end of the song, she discovers that she inadvertently walked over to Will's table and proposed to him.  When she realizes, she embarrassingly runs out of the lounge and Will decides to bring the news to the choir room.  He's going to be the one to propose to her.  Their assignment this week is to find the perfect proposal number. \n"}, {"text": "To try to impress Mercedes, Sam joins which school team?", "correct": "Synchronized swimming", "options": ["Ping pong", "Chess club", "Basketball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSynchronized swimming.\n\n\tIn the halls, Sam speaks to Mercedes and tries to convince her to go on a date.  He reminds her about how great their summer fling was but she insists that she's with Shane-- summer's over.  Elsewhere, Artie tries to convince Sugar to work on a proposal number with him for Mr. Schuester's assignment.  She thinks that he's actually asking her out and rejects him because they'd look really weird together.  It's not because he's disabled, she claims, but because she's 'abled'.  Becky takes the opportunity to ask Artie on a date instead.\rSam tries to join the basketball team to get a letterman jacket and win Mercedes over with his athletic abilities but Beiste claims that most of the teams are already in the thick of things having practiced for so long.  The only team he can join is synchronized swimming.  He decides to go for it and meets the swim coach, Roz Washington, who won a bronze medal in Beijing, China for 'Individual Synchronized Swimming'. \n"}, {"text": "Finn reveals which of the following to Will while shopping for an engagement ring?", "correct": "He wants to join the army", "options": ["He and Rachel are breaking up", "He wants to drop out of high school", "He wants to be a musician"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe wants to join the army.\n\n\tSam tells Finn that he's joined synchronized swimming and Finn tells him to keep it down; coupled with Glee Club, it's a death wish.  Sure enough, Sam gets slushied in the halls.  Mercedes comes to help him clean himself up, but Shane tells her to come along, pulling her away.\rIn the auditorium, Artie tries to convince Will to propose to Emma using his dance moves and shows off his and the guys' mash-up of \"Moves Like Jagger\" (by Maroon 5 and Christina Aguilera) and \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (by The Rolling Stones\").  Will says that he loves the mash-up, but it won't work for the proposal; Emma likes to be clean and the dancing would make him sweaty.  Becky, who watched the performance, stops Artie before he can leave and says that the next phase of their relationship will be dinner at Breadstix.  He decides not to refuse.\rAt a jewellery store, Will asks Finn to help him pick out the ring and be his best man.  Finn confides in Will about his future and reveals that he spoke to a recruiter for the army.  He wants to do something noble like his father. \n"}, {"text": "Do Emma's parents approve of Will's decision to propose?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe girls bring Will to his office to ask a few questions about his relationship with Emma-- they realize how easy it will be to create a number for him and they select Roberta Flack's \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\".  The number is an emotional one for the four performers and while Will watches from his seat, they harmonize and remember the first time they each saw the boys they love.  Rachel crossed paths with Finn in the school halls; Tina remembers a picnic with Mike; Santana remembers an encounter with Brittany.  Mercedes is surprised to find herself picturing Sam and not Shane.  At the end of the number, Mercedes leaves and reveals to the girls that she thought of Shane first.  Rachel reasons that perhaps the spark with Sam is still there.\rWill invites Emma's mother and father to the apartment to discuss the possibility of proposing to their daughter and neither of them are thrilled with the idea.  They decide not to give their blessing because marriage is messy and she won't be able to handle it. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Finn's father pass away?", "correct": "The United States", "options": ["Afghanistan", "Iraq", "Thailand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe United States.\n\n\tThe New Directions attempt to give Artie a 'Becky-vention' since he was spotted with her at Breadstix.  He admits to accepting her invitation and actually has a good time with her over dinner, getting to know her better.  They say that he just needs to watch himself.\rIn another classroom, Will, Emma, Burt, and Carol have their own intervention for Finn.  Will went to Finn's parents with the news of his army recruitment plans because he felt it was important to let them hear it.  Finn says that he has an obligation to his father to be a good man; everyone suggests that he doesn't really need to prove himself in that way and his mother reveals the truth-- his father didn't die in Iraq.  He served there, but when he came back he broke.  He died in Cincinnati after being discharged; he overdosed on drugs.  Shocked, Finn leaves the room. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these can still be found in Will's apartment?", "correct": "A christmas tree", "options": ["Easter eggs", "A jack-o-lantern", "His ex-wife's clothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA christmas tree.\n\n\tBecky sends a picture message to Artie's phone with a 'sneak peek' and what he'll getting on Friday night as incentive for accompanying her to the Special Olympics Ball.  Shocked, Artie takes the image to Sue and gets his own guidance.  Sue asks if he wants to go out with Becky again, and when he decides he doesn't, she suggests that he break up with her like real people do; she just wants to be treated as normal.  She also suggests that he stop wearing driving gloves and that he not button his shirt up all the way.\rWill finds Emma in the living room of the apartment putting away more ornaments from the Christmas tree (she's been doing so since New Year's Day).  Emma sits him down and tells the truth-- Sue suggested that she ask to marry him but she wants to know if he wants to marry her first.  He says he does, of course, but he's worried that if they do, she wouldn't be able to be in control.  He says, in honesty, that sometimes it seems hopeless.  She says that she can't promise that she'll get better, but she loves him. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is Will wearing when he proposes to Emma?", "correct": "A tuxedo", "options": ["A sweater vest", "A swimsuit", "Parachute pants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA tuxedo.\n\n\tFinn, Kurt, and Rachel all worry about their futures at Breadstix.  While Finn worries about losing the special thoughts he had about his father, Rachel and Kurt stress over NYADA finalist letters they haven't yet received.  This motivates Rachel to perform her own version David Guetta's (and Usher's) \"Without You\" in the choir room, directing it at Finn alone.  At the end of the number, Santana gives a backhanded comment complimenting the song, but noting how it doesn't apply to the assignment.  Will can't decide on his choice though.  He worries about how to make the ultimate proposal and it's Sam who pulls through with an idea.\rWill begins by escorting Emma out of her office to a hallway of people handing her white roses (including Beiste and Sue).  When they reach the swimming pool, she has a whole bouquet and she finds the New Directions and the synchronized swimming team singing Rihanna's \"We Found Love\" (feat. Calvin Harris).  Seating her in the lifeguard's seat, the kids perform (with Rachel and Santana singing lea vocals) and Will emerging in a white tuxedo.  He appears to walk on water before diving in and swimming up to her for the proposal.  When he finally presents the ring, she accepts in tears and the kids cheer from the water. \n"}, {"text": "Becky decides to break up her relationship to focus on her future career.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tArtie decides to come clean with Becky and explains that he hasn't been clear.  He likes being her friend, but they shouldn't date.  Becky asks if it's because she's too intimidating and he goes with that.  In her head, Becky suggests to herself that it's because she has Downs.  Becky goes to Sue who offers her a tissue.  Since they both got dumped, they can both watch a Lifetime network version of \"Beaches\", eat ice cream, and hold hands so that they can get through it together.\rIn the auditorium, Finn looks at a picture of his father and Rachel sees the resemblance.  He asked her to the auditorium to talk about them together and he originally wanted to have a picnic, like they had the first time they went out together, but he couldn't find the cups they used.  He says he wants to talk to her, but she can't say a word.  He's been wondering if he could ever live up to his father (but then everything changed) and he realizes that he will always have her.  He wants to be with her because that way everything will be okay.  He opened his first credit card and he bought a ring, and when he gets on his knee, he asks Rachel to marry him. \n"}]}
