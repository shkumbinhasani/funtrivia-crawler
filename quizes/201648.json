{"id": "201648", "name": "\"Die Hard\" for Diehards (Get It?), Part 1 Trivia Game | Movies | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Die Hard"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of the film, we see an airplane carrying John McClane (Bruce Willis) land in Los Angeles.  According to his dialogue, how long has he been a police officer?", "correct": "11 years", "options": ["9 years", "13 years", "15 years"], "explanation": "\n\n\n11 years.\n\n\tThe passenger seated next to McClane notices the handgun under his jacket -- hey, air travel was different in 1988 -- and McClane tells the man that he has been a cop for 11 years. \n"}, {"text": "Before McClane gets to the Nakatomi building, we get to meet his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and several of her co-workers, including an obnoxious cocaine addict whose last name is Ellis (Hart Bochner).  His first name is used sparingly in the film.  What is it?", "correct": "Harry", "options": ["Aaron", "Warren", "Gary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry.\n\n\tJoe Takagi, Holly's boss, introduces Ellis to McClane, and uses each man's full name when doing so. \n"}, {"text": "John and Holly have two children.  Which of the following statements about them is FALSE?", "correct": "Both children have lines in the film.", "options": ["Their daughter's name is Lucy.", "Both children survive the film.", "Their son's name is John."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoth children have lines in the film.\n\n\tYoung Lucy gets to talk to her mother on the phone early in the film, and later is interviewed by Dick Thornberg on television -- she says, simply, \"Come home\" to her parents.  Little John (or is it John Jr.?) doesn't have any lines. \n"}, {"text": "Holly has a nanny/housekeeper named Paulina (Betty Carvalho).  Where is Paulina from?", "correct": "It's never revealed", "options": ["Mexico", "Guatemala", "Ecuador"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's never revealed.\n\n\tWe never learn where Paulina is from, but it's a pretty safe bet that she's an illegal immigrant, since she crumbles in the wake of Dick Thornberg's threat to call INS on her. \n"}, {"text": "The stuffed bear that John brings as a Christmas present for his daughter is the same bear that Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin) brings home for his daughter in 1990s \"The Hunt for Red October\" (also directed by John McTiernan).", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tFor some reason, the folks at IMDB think that the same bear appears in the two movies, but it's crystal clear, when comparing the two movies side by side (as I've done), that the bear in \"Die Hard\" is much larger than the one in \"October\", and its snout is much longer and darker.  Check for yourself! \n"}, {"text": "McClane explains to limo driver Argyle (De'voreaux White) that Holly left their New York home for Los Angeles thanks to an irresistable promotion.  How long has Holly been in L.A.?", "correct": "six months", "options": ["two months", "It's never revealed", "four months"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsix months.\n\n\tMcClane explains that he didn't feel comfortable leaving a six-month backlog of unsolved cases behind him, which he would have had to do in order to relocate with the rest of his family. \n"}, {"text": "Numerous references to Christmas carols and Christmas-related music are heard in this film.  Which tune is McClane whistling as he approaches the bank of elevators that will take him to the 30th floor of the Nakatomi building and reunite him with his wife?", "correct": "Jingle Bells", "options": ["Santa Claus Is Coming to Town", "Jingle Bell Rock", "Here Comes Santa Claus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJingle Bells.\n\n\tNone of the other songs listed appear anywhere else in this film.  Why is McClane whistling \"Jingle Bells\" out of the blue?  Who knows?  Maybe he was in the mood for more traditional holiday music after being exposed to RUN-DMC's \"Christmas in Hollis\" in the limo. \n"}, {"text": "What is Holly Gennero's job title?", "correct": "Director, Corporate Affairs", "options": ["Vice President, Corporate Affairs", "Director, Operations", "Vice President, Operations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDirector, Corporate Affairs.\n\n\tWe see Holly's job title on the door to her office in several extended shots. \n"}, {"text": "Interestingly, McClane is called by at least five different names in the film.  Which character calls him \"Mac\"?", "correct": "Argyle", "options": ["Al Powell", "Holly Gennero", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArgyle.\n\n\tArgyle calls John \"Mac\" numerous times, especially during the telephone call that takes place just before Hans Gruber and his men kill all communications in the Nakatomi building.  No one else in the movie ever calls him \"Mac.\" \n"}, {"text": "Ellis and Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) have something in common.  What is it?", "correct": "They both have beards.", "options": ["They both shop at Brooks Brothers.", "They both die from gunshot wounds.", "They both speak fluent German."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey both have beards.\n\n\tGruber mentions shopping at John Phillips in London, not Brooks Brothers.  Ellis never indicates that he speaks German -- in fact, at one point, he asks one of the terrorists \"Sprechen sie talk?\", which makes it pretty clear that he has no actual grasp of German.  Ellis is killed by a gunshot wound, but Gruber is quite alive even after McClane shoots him at the end of the film: it's the thirty-story fall that actually kills him.\r All that leaves is facial hair.  Both men wore beards. \n"}, {"text": "Hans Gruber takes a moment to admire the suit worn by Nakatomi CEO Joe Takagi (James Shigeta), and notes that he buys his suits from the same place that Takagi does.  Finish his quote:  \"Rumor has it _______________ buys his suits there.\"", "correct": "Arafat", "options": ["Reagan", "Prince Charles", "Kissinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArafat.\n\n\tThe shop in question is John Phillips in London.  \"I have two myself,\" Gruber says to Takagi, in reference to the suit.  Yassir Arafat was the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, an anti-Israel terrorist organization, for many years. \n"}, {"text": "What is the first thing that McClane does intentionally that draws the attention of Gruber and his men?", "correct": "He pulls a fire alarm.", "options": ["He drops explosives down an elevator shaft.", "He kills one of the terrorists.", "He breaks a window with a chair."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe pulls a fire alarm.\n\n\tMcClane actually doesn't do much for the first fifteen minutes or so that Gruber and company begin their takeover -- mostly, he observes and argues with himself aloud over what to do.  After Takagi is killed, he pulls a fire alarm in the hopes that emergency services will arrive on the scene.  It doesn't work, though: one of Gruber's men calls the fire department and says that it was a false alarm.\rMcClane does everything else on this list, but not until later in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Hans Gruber kills Joe Takagi, since Takagi refuses to give him a necessary computer password, but Theo (Clarence Gilyard, Jr.) figures out the password by himself pretty quickly after Takagi is dead.  What is it?", "correct": "red castle & redcastle", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nred castle & redcastle.\n\n\tI found it strange that, after all of the drama over whether or not Hans would be able to get Takagi to tell him the password, Theo was able to ferret out the password in record time with zero assistance from (the deceased) Takagi.  If it was so easy to figure out, why would Hans have needed Takagi's cooperation in the first place?\r I used to think that there was an error in this scene -- namely, that Takagi's name is misspelled on the monitor when Theo is actually utilizing the password.  The character's name is Takagi, but when Theo types in the words \"red castle,\" we see the name \"Akagi\" on the screen.  Fortunately, Funtrivia player Hagamonkey has provided me with an explanation for this apparent gaffe!  Observe:\r \"Actually, Takagi translates to \"tall tree.\" TAKA means tall, and KI (GI) means tree. As for the code, \"Akagi\" is the name of a small town in central Japan, and it does translate to \"red castle.\" AKA means red and GI means, yeah you guessed it, castle. (Japanese has a lot of homophones.) I suppose just using his last name translated into English as a code word would've been too easy to break, so Takagi dropped the first letter and changed the meaning entirely. Pretty tricky, huh?\"\r Thanks a ton, Hagamonkey!  I owe you one. \n"}, {"text": "Once McClane kills his first terrorist, he steals the man's weapon and \"sends\" his body to Gruber via elevator.  McClane has also written a Christmas-themed message on the shirt that the dead man is wearing.  Finish the message:  \"Now I have a machine gun.  ___________________________.\"", "correct": "HO-HO-HO", "options": ["MERRY XMAS", "AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT", "GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHO-HO-HO.\n\n\tHans actually reads the message aloud, which is pretty funny, even considering the grim visual. \n"}, {"text": "Of what snack food is Sergeant Al Powell apparently a big fan?", "correct": "Twinkies", "options": ["Pringles", "Doritos", "Ho-Ho's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwinkies.\n\n\tWhen we first meet Al, he is buying an armful of Twinkies.  The convenience store clerk says \"I thought you guys only went for donuts\"; Al tells the clerk that the Twinkies are for his pregnant wife, but the clerk doesn't believe him.  Since Al later demonstrates the ability to rattle off, from memory, the precise ingredients of Twinkies while on the phone with McClane, it's a pretty safe bet that Al himself is the Twinkie fan in the Powell family.\r Stay tuned for part two of this quiz! \n"}]}
