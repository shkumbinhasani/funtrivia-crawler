Business tycoon. Billionaire. Former United States President. Arch-nemesis of Superman. All of these things and more describe DC Comics' most hated villain, Lex Luthor. Making his debut in \"Action Comics\" #23, in 1940, Lex has been the bane of the Man of Steel's existence almost from the beginning. And, although he possesses no superhuman powers of any kind, it is Luthor's intellect that creates so many problems for not only Superman, but the entire DC universe, as well. \r Initially, Luthor was written as an evil scientist with red hair who tried to take over the world by starting a war between two European nations and then becoming the dictator in the aftermath. His baldness was a result of an artist's mistake in \"Superman\" #10 (vol.1) which was subsequently kept because of the way it made Luthor look more villainous. Later, in the early 1960s, it was determined that Luthor and Superman were actually teenaged friends until an experiment Luthor was working on to impress Superboy went wrong and Luthor ended up losing his hair, from which he blamed Superboy, and carried his hatred into his adult years.\r Then, in 1986, as DC Comics totally revamped their whole universe via the 12-issue mini-series \"Crises on Infinite Earths\", Luthor's origin was again changed to having been born into a poor, abusive family in the Suicide Slum section of Metropolis. He becomes caught up with that section's criminal element and ends up killing his parents after taking out a large insurance policy on them without their knowledge. He was then passed into a bad foster care family who were just as, if not more so, abusive than his original family. However, it was within this setting where he found his one true love, Lena, his foster-sister. Although her parents wanted her to seduce Lex into revealing the whereabouts of his insurance money, she refused because she truly cared for him. One day while Lex was out with his childhood friend, Perry White, the future editor of The Daily Planet, Lena's parents beat her to death because of her refusal to betray Lex. Upon returning home to find her beaten body, whatever humanity that remained within Lex Luthor died that day. \n"}, {"text": "The Penguin made his first Silver Age appearance in \"Batman\" #158.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOswald Cobblepot, a.k.a. The Penguin, made his first Silver Age appearance in \"Batman\" #155 in May, 1963. His very first appearance occurred in December, 1941, in \"Detective Comics\" #58. Cobblepot was born into a world of wealth and luxury, however, due to his short stature and less than average-looking features, he was mercilessly taunted as a child. And, as children often do, they found a nickname to give to little Oswald, the Penguin. \r Although, he possesses no superpowers, the Penguin is one of the Batman's toughest villains because of his incredible intellect and business savvy. In many ways, he is what Bruce Wayne (Batman) may have turned out to be had he not had the watchful eye of his faithful butler, Alfred, to direct him in the right way. \r Avoiding physical contact whenever possible, the Penguin uses a variety of trick umbrellas if he ever does have to fight. He also has a love of birds and will use them for various things like protection or information gathering. Before the classic \"No Man's Land\" story began, which saw Gotham City left for dead by the United States government after a massive earthquake totally destroyed it, the Penguin was just a petty thief who committed bird-themed crimes. Now, however, he is now more like Metropolis's Lex Luthor in that his crimes are more white-collar in nature and thereby more difficult to pin down. \r Although the Batman wants to bring the Penguin to justice, he tolerates his activities in exchange for information when needed. No criminal is as informed about the comings and goings of Gotham City's underworld as the Penguin. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Avengers\" #195 (vol. 1) was the first appearance of which of these villains?", "correct": "Taskmaster", "options": ["Korvac", "Graviton", "Master Pandemonium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTaskmaster.\n\n\tWith the mutant ability to mimic any move or superpower he sees, even if only once, Taskmaster made his debut in \"The Avengers\" #195, in 1980.

Schmidt happened to be Adolph Hitler's bellboy during his stay at the hotels when, in a chance meeting, he was handpicked by Hitler to become their country's greatest soldier. Hitler wanted to prove Germany's supposed 'superiority' by taking the lowliest citizen and molding him into the Third Reich's second most powerful citizen, which he indeed did.\r The Red Skull made his very first appearance in \"Captain America Comics\" #1, in 1941.

The Absorbing Man, made his debut in 1965, in \"Journey Into Mystery\" #114. Possessing the power to absorb the properties of any substance, Creel was more than a worthy adversary when he debuted as a villain for The Mighty Thor. It was Thor's evil, half-brother, Loki, who gave Creel his powers, along with his magical ball and chain, which returns to his hand when thrown, just as Captain America's shield or Thor's hammer, returns to theirs. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these villains made their first appearance in \"Fantastic Four\" #15 (vol. 1)?", "correct": "The Mad Thinker", "options": ["The Puppet Master", "Rama-Tut", "The Hate Monger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mad Thinker.\n\n\t\"Fantastic Four\" #15 saw the first appearance of The Mad Thinker, a brilliant scientist whose intelligence rivaled the greatest minds in the Marvel Universe.

He was banished to the anti-universe of Qward by the Guardians of the Galaxy as punishment for his crimes and it was here that he acqired the yellow power ring which was the direct antithesis of the Green Lantern Corps. He has been a thorn in the Corps' side ever since.\r Sinestro made his debut in \"Green Lantern\"# 7, in 1961. \n"}, {"text": "\"Justice League of America\" #11 (vol. 1) was the first appearance of the villain, Dr. Light.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDr. Light made his first appearance in issue number 12 of \"Justice League of America\", in 1962. Initially introduced as a mad scientist who stumbled upon a way to control light, Dr. Light was a formidable for the Justice League, and specifically, The Atom (Ray Palmer), for many years until be became a bumbling, grade-D villain during the second series run of the team's book called \"Justice League\", in 1987.\r However, it was revealed during the 2004 DC mini-series, \"Identity Crisis\", that Dr. Light, and many other super-villains (and a few heroes), had been mind wiped by one-time Justice League member, Zatanna, in an effort to 'tame' these individuals. Enraged, Dr. Light and these other formally mind wiped villains went on a crime spree the likes of which had rarely been seen in a comic book. The villains were not just attacking the heroes, but their loved ones, as well. Dr. Light was initially believed to have brutally killed The Elongated Man's wife, Sue Dibny, after raping her, but was found to be innocent of the crime when it was revealed The Atom's ex-wife, Jean Loring, had committed the deed. \n"}, {"text": "In which publication will you find the first appearance of the Aquaman villain, Ocean Master?", "correct": "\"Aquaman\" #29 (vol. 1)", "options": ["\"Aquaman\" #22 (vol. 1)", "\"Justice League of America\" #18 (vol. 1)", "\"The Brave and the Bold\" #51"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Aquaman\" #29 (vol. 1)\n\n\tHe's a former member of the Injustice Gang, an arch-enemy of Aquaman, and he's family. In 1966, Aquaman's step-brother, Orm, a.k.a The Ocean Master, made his debut in \"Aquaman\" #29 (vol. 1). \r In DC's pre-Crisis history, Orm and Arthur (Aquaman) were the sons of Thomas Curry, but shared different mothers. Orm was extremely jealous of Arthur because Aquaman was born with incredible, aquatic powers while he himself was born normal.\r In the post-Crisis history, the two are still half-brothers, but this time the father they share is a wizard named, Atlan, who was from Atlantis. The feud between the brothers is something that is a part of Atlante-an history because it is foretold that every ruling king would have strife with his sibling, so Aquaman and Ocean Master are just playing out their parts as far as Atlante-an fate is concerned.\r The updated version of Ocean Master now possesses great magical and telepathic powers along with a special trident he uses to focus energy blasts through;  he will experience great pain if he is ever separated from it. He can only breathe underwater and endure the incredible undersea pressures by wearing his body armor. \n"}, {"text": "The 30th century super villain group, The Fatal Five, debuted in which of the following publications?", "correct": "\"Adventure Comics\" #352", "options": ["\"Adventure Comics\" #300", "\"Superboy\" #129", "\"Superboy and the Legion of Superheroes\" #197"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Adventure Comics\" #352.\n\n\tThe Emerald Empress, Sarya, from the planet Vinegar, who controls the powerful Eye of Ekron.

Tharok, their incredibly intelligent half-man half-cyborg, leader. Validus, the supremely powerful, yet mindless brute. To the citizens of 30th century Earth, as well as the entire universe, these names bring a cold shiver down the spines of all those that hear them. These names make up the 30th century's most notorious super-villain team, The Fatal Five. \r Debuting in \"Adventure Comics\" #352, in 1967, The Fatal Five were 'drafted' individually by the Legion of Superheroes to help them stop the Sun-Eater, a creature who fed on the suns of various solar systems thereby extinguishing all life therein.

The half-brother of the leader and founder of the X-Men, Charles Xavier, Marko constantly tormented the younger Charles as they grew up. Marko's abuse of his brother stemmed from the fact that Charles excelled at everything he did while Cain struggled. And, when Charles' mutant powers started to manifest themselves during his early teens, Marko felt even more inadequate because he had no powers.\r After being sent away to military school because of his now out-of-control behavior, Marko served time in the army, fighting in Korea. It was while he was in Korea that Marko's alter ego, The Juggernaut was born. After stumbling upon a long-forgotten temple, both Marko and Xavier (who had also joined the Army) found a mystical jewel called the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak. Before Charles had the chance to inspect the gem, Marko grabbed it and read the inscription that was written upon it, which said:\r    \"Whosoever touches this gem shall be granted the power of the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who reads these words, shall become...forevermore...a human Juggernaut!\"\r Instantly, Marko was granted the gem's incredible, mystical power which included great strength, superhuman stamina, a healing factor, and an almost total resistance to physical and at times, mental, harm via an impenetrable force field. As the cavern where the two men found the temple started to crumble due to the transformation, Xavier barely escaped while Marko was buried alive. However, with his new powers, Marko emerged from the rubble unharmed, but with the misunderstanding that Xavier had left him to die. Now, with a renewed hatred for his half-brother and his immense power, Marko was able to compete with, and even defeat Charles, becoming a major threat to the X-Men for many years. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these Wonder Woman foes made their debut in \"Wonder Woman\" #6 (vol. 1)?", "correct": "The Cheetah", "options": ["Egg Fu", "Dr. Psycho", "Circe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Cheetah.\n\n\tAlthough there have been several different women who have battled Wonder Woman while calling themselves The Cheetah, it was high-society d\u00e9butante, Priscilla Rich, who was actually the first person to wear the Cheetah costume, in \"Wonder Woman\" #6, in 1943. \r Priscilla had a split personality and it was after Wonder Woman had been perceived as to have shown up Priscilla at her d\u00e9butante ball that her Cheetah persona was born. After retiring, it was Priscilla's niece, Deborah Domaine, who donned the costume for a brief period. While neither of these women had any superpowers, they surprisingly gave Wonder Woman a run for her money, so to speak.

While the Leader is not in the Hulk's power class by any means, the dynamic of his intelligence versus the Hulk's brute strength is a take on the age old question of which is better, mental prowess or physical strength. \n"}, {"text": "The Daredevil foe, The Stilt-Man, made his debut in \"Here Comes Daredevil, The Man Without Fear\" #17.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWlibur Day, a.k.a.

Captain Marvel\" #34, in 1974.\r In the subheading of the book, there was a small statement which introduce Nitro as 'The Man Who Killed Captain Marvel' and that is exactly what he did.
