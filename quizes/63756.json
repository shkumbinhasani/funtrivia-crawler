What is this new partner's first name?", "correct": "Al", "options": ["Ed", "Joe", "Ted"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAl.\n\n\tDylan McDermott plays Agent Al D'Andrea. \n"}, {"text": "During the first phone conversation that Frank has with 'Booth' (John Malkovich), 'Booth' uses a word that, we later learn, Frank had to look up to understand its meaning. What word was it?", "correct": "panache", "options": ["deicide", "halcyon", "verisimilitude"], "explanation": "\n\n\npanache.\n\n\tMitch Leary initially wants to be called 'Booth' instead of 'Oswald' because he feels that John Wilkes Booth showed panache (a flair for the dramatic) by leaping onto the stage after shooting President Lincoln dead at the Ford Theater. Frank admits to Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) that he had to look up the word 'panache' afterwards. \n"}, {"text": "True or False: Frank Horrigan has a son whom we never see in the movie.", "correct": "false", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfalse.\n\n\tMitch Leary -- reading from a magazine article written in 1973 -- tells us that Frank has a *daughter* whom her mother took away due to Frank's alcoholism and general belligerence following his guilt over being unable to save President Kennedy. We never see this wife or daughter in the film, nor do we learn their names. \n"}, {"text": "When Frank is first alerted to the threat of Mitch Leary, Leary is using the fake last name of 'McCrawley.' What state, according to his landlady, does 'McCrawley' hail from?", "correct": "Colorado", "options": ["Montana", "Nebraska", "Kansas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColorado.\n\n\tAs the landlady and Frank are about to enter Leary's apartment, she mentions that 'McCrawley' is from Colorado. Shortly thereafter, the Secret Service techs learn that someone with that name from that state died 30 years back -- Leary somehow obtained the real McCrawley's birth certificate in order to establish the fake identity. \n"}, {"text": "Frank tries to kiss Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) as he is playing the piano in a hotel bar, but she backs away and leaves. As she is exiting the bar, what song does he suddenly start playing?", "correct": "As Time Goes By", "options": ["Great Balls of Fire", "Besame Mucho", "At Last"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs Time Goes By.\n\n\tPresumably since the first lines of the song are, 'You must remember this -- a kiss is still a kiss.' Plus, Frank had just lapsed into a lame Humphrey Bogart impersonation before making his big move, and \"As Time Goes By\" was prominently featured in the film \"Casablanca,\" starring Bogart. \n"}, {"text": "We never learn the real name of the President of the United States (Jim Curley) in the film -- he is referred to only by his Secret Service code-name. What is that code-name?", "correct": "Traveler", "options": ["Gladhand", "Liberty", "Eagle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTraveler.\n\n\tAll of the Secret Service agents call him 'Traveler,' even when they're not in the midst of official communications. President Jed Bartlet of TV's \"The West Wing\" has been known as both 'Liberty' and 'Eagle' at times. I made up 'Gladhand,' but that would probably be a good code-name for certain presidents, no? \n"}, {"text": "Frank finds a magazine devoted to crafting models in Leary's apartment, and later buys a copy of that magazine at a newsstand. What is the publication called?", "correct": "New Age Modeler", "options": ["Modeling Monthly", "Finescale Modeler", "Radio Control Modeler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Age Modeler.\n\n\tAs far as I can tell, there is no such magazine...but \"Finescale Modeler\" and \"Radio Control Modeler\" are real publications. \n"}, {"text": "The director of \"In the Line of Fire\" directed another film in which the President of the United States was a major character. Which of the following is it?", "correct": "Air Force One", "options": ["Dave", "The Contender", "The American President"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAir Force One.\n\n\tWolfgang Petersen directed both \"In the Line of Fire\" and \"Air Force One.\" Ivan Reitman directed \"Dave;\" Rob Reiner directed \"The American President;\" and Rod Lurie directed \"The Contender.\" \n"}, {"text": "Under which assumed alias does Mitch Leary assure his invitation to a campaign contributors' banquet by donating a large sum of money to the President's re-election campaign?", "correct": "James Carney", "options": ["Bill Watts", "Jack Booth", "Mark McCrawley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Carney.\n\n\tBill Watts is actually the name of Gary Cole's character, the cranky Secret Service agent in charge of the presidential detail. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the non-existent software company that Leary establishes as a cover for his campaign contributor identity?", "correct": "Microspan", "options": ["Microage", "Microtech", "Microscan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMicrospan.\n\n\tHe mentions this once or twice, and we clearly see the company name printed on a corporate check. \n"}, {"text": "How much does Leary contribute to the President's re-election campaign?", "correct": "$50,000", "options": ["$75,000", "$25,000", "$100,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$50,000.\n\n\tWe're never told exactly where Leary got all that money, but we do see him writing out the check for $50,000. \n"}, {"text": "Frank Horrigan and Lilly Raines share a quiet moment eating ice cream on the steps of a notable Washington, DC edifice.  Which one?", "correct": "The Lincoln Memorial", "options": ["The Washington Monument", "The Capitol Building", "The FBI Building"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Lincoln Memorial.\n\n\tThe statue of Lincoln is directly behind them as they look out across the Reflecting Pool at the Washington Monument. They return to this spot in the last shot of the film. \n"}, {"text": "A curious bank employee named Pam Magnus (Patrika Darbo) inadvertently brings death to both herself and her roommate by Mitch Leary's hands... but they might have been safe if their dog had not been restrained across the room. What kind of dog was barking wildly as Leary killed both of its owners in ten seconds flat?", "correct": "German Shepherd", "options": ["Pit Bull", "Doberman Pinscher", "Rottweiler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGerman Shepherd.\n\n\tThe dog's name was either Rory or Lori -- I couldn't quite make it out the one time Pam said its name.  Anyone out there know for sure? \n"}, {"text": "Where did Mitch Leary receive the training that made him into the deadly adversary that he proves himself to be throughout the movie?", "correct": "the CIA", "options": ["the FBI", "the Secret Service", "the Green Berets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe CIA.\n\n\tWe're eventually told that Leary was a 'wetboy' -- a CIA assassin trained to eliminate specific targets, usually through rather serpentine means. \n"}, {"text": "Finish this quote from Frank Horrigan to Lilly Raines: 'A good ________ can be just as effective as a gun.'", "correct": "glare", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nglare.\n\n\tFrank says this after Lilly asks why he never wears sunglasses while on protective duty. 'I like the crazies to see the whites of my eyes,' he replies, then adds the above quote. \n"}, {"text": "At one point along the campaign trail, Frank makes a major error in judgment, mistaking the popping of balloons as gunfire and sending the entire Secret Service detail into understandable panic. In which city did this error take place?", "correct": "Chicago", "options": ["Milwaukee", "Minneapolis", "Denver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChicago.\n\n\tIn Frank's defense, he was rather disoriented due to a high fever... and it was Mitch Leary himself doing the popping of the balloons, presumably to rattle Frank deliberately. \n"}, {"text": "As Leary is testing his hand-made composite plastic gun out in the woods, he draws the attention of two hunters, one of whom asks if he can fire the gun himself. What does the hunter shoot with Leary's gun?", "correct": "a duck", "options": ["an apple", "a beer bottle", "a squirrel"], "explanation": "\n\n\na duck.\n\n\tLeary takes his gun back, reloads it, and immediately kills one of the hunters. The remaining hunter asks, 'Why did you do that?' Leary replies only with, 'Why'd you shoot that duck?' before killing him as well. Not a warm guy, that Mitch Leary. \n"}, {"text": "According to Mitch Leary, President John F. Kennedy had a favorite poem. Who wrote it?", "correct": "Alan Seeger", "options": ["William Butler Yeats", "Robert Frost", "Boris Pasternak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlan Seeger.\n\n\tAlan Seeger wrote \"I Have a Rendezvous With Death,\" which Leary claims was JFK's favorite poem. Frank Horrigan's furious reply to Leary -- incorporating, in part, the title of this poem -- is perhaps the funniest moment in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "There has been, of course, an enormous amount of speculation, over the years, as to who really killed John F. Kennedy... but Frank Horrigan was actually there when it happened. Whom does he hold responsible for the assassination?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["The mob", "The CIA", "The Cubans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tDespite his having witnessed the assassination first-hand, Frank seems to have no strong opinion as to the who, how, or why of it. As he explains to Lilly Raines: 'For thirty years I've been listening to idiots on bar stools spew out their own pet theories -- whether there was one gun, or two, or three; whether it was the mob, or the Cubans, or the CIA, or white supremacists. None of that's meant too much to me.' \n"}, {"text": "Leary's hand-made plastic gun is easily smuggled into the contributors' banquet, but bullets are metallic. How does he sneak the bullets through the metal detector at the banquet hall?", "correct": "He hides them in a rabbit's foot on his keychain", "options": ["He doesn't -- the bullets have been planted at his table ahead of time", "He hides them in his belt buckle", "He hides them in one of his crutches"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe hides them in a rabbit's foot on his keychain.\n\n\tAs anyone who's been to the airport knows, since keys are metallic, you drop them in a basket before you pass through the metal detector. Pretty clever, there, Mitch. \n"}, {"text": "While trapped in a darkened, stalled glass elevator with Leary, Frank gives a two-word command to Lilly Raines (via his hand-held radio) that solves her problem of how to instruct the snipers to shoot Leary and not Frank. What are these two words?", "correct": "aim high", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\naim high.\n\n\tAs Frank is lying on the floor of the car and Leary is standing, firing at the top of the darkened car would theoretically take out Leary and leave Frank relatively unharmed... but somehow, they miss. \n"}, {"text": "Who, in the end, actually kills Mitch Leary?", "correct": "Leary kills himself", "options": ["Frank Horrigan", "An unnamed sniper", "Lilly Raines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeary kills himself.\n\n\tAfter the snipers fail to kill Leary, a brief struggle with Frank lands Leary outside the elevator car, where he hangs on for dear life.

Who left it?", "correct": "Mitch Leary", "options": ["The President of the United States", "Frank's ex-wife", "Frank's late partner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMitch Leary.\n\n\tAt some undisclosed point before the climax of the film, Leary called Frank one last time.
