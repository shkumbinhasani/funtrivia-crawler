{"id": "213378", "name": "Test yourself! Take this Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Quiz | Harry Potter", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "Harry Potter", "Harry Potter Book 6"], "questions": [{"text": "Who is the new Minister of Magic?", "correct": "Rufus Scrimgeour", "options": ["Arthur Weasley", "Percy Weasley", "Amelia Bones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRufus Scrimgeour.\n\n\tCornelius Fudge was fired because of all the magic being seen in the muggle world, as well as the amount of murders that have been taking place. Amelia Bones, one of the choices, was one of those people who were murdered. She was head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following was not part of the Slug Club?", "correct": "Ron Weasley", "options": ["Harry Potter", "Ginny Weasley", "Hermione Granger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRon Weasley.\n\n\tSlughorn tends to favor people who are going places.

Harry didn't get were Divination and History of Magic, but he was happy with his report for the most part. He was upset he only received an E (Exceed Expectations) in Potions because Snape said the only people who could continue in that class were the ones who got an O (Outstanding). Harry hated Snape, but wanted to stay in the class to become an Auror. \n"}, {"text": "After Harry is beaten up by Draco, who finds him on the train?", "correct": "Tonks", "options": ["Hermione", "Snape", "Ron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTonks.\n\n\tTonks helps Harry get to Hogwarts where Snape meets him.

Harry gets to the point where he becomes obsessed with Draco. \n"}, {"text": "Who are Tom Riddle's (Lord Voldemort) parents?", "correct": "Merope and Tom Riddle Sr.", "options": ["Pansy Parkinson and Marvolo", "Merope and Caractacus Burke", "Merope and Marvolo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMerope and Tom Riddle Sr.\n\n\tVoldemort's mother died shortly after giving birth to him so he was raised in an orphanage.

Then he starts to figure that Ginny is like a little sister to him. Therefore he is being protective of her in the same way the Weasley boys are. Finally Harry realizes he loves her and it turns out later that she also loves him. \n"}, {"text": "What is a bezoar?", "correct": "a stone from a goat's stomach", "options": ["a new creature found by Hagrid", "a curse", "a new drink at Hogsmeade"], "explanation": "\n\n\na stone from a goat's stomach.\n\n\tThe bezoar protects against most poisons.

Whose death is he upset about?", "correct": "Aragog", "options": ["Grawp", "Felix Felicis", "Oliver Wood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAragog.\n\n\tAragog was the spider we met in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\". Grawp doesn't die, he is Hagrid's brother.  Oliver Wood graduated two years ago and was replaced by Angelina who graduated last year.  Now Harry is captain. Felix Felicis is not a person at all but a potion that causes a person to have good luck. It's this potion that Harry uses to go to see Hagrid when Aragog dies. \n"}, {"text": "Who killed Dumbledore?", "correct": "Severus Snape", "options": ["Draco Malfoy", "Lord Voldemort", "an unnamed Death Eater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeverus Snape.\n\n\tHarry had warned Dumbledore for years now that Snape couldn't be trusted. Dumbledore had always trusted him, and it turns out that Snape was the Half-Blood Prince and was still very much a Death Eater. Malfoy was supposed to kill Dumbledore, but only succeeded in knocking the wand out of his hand, so Snape finished Dumbledore off with the \"Avada Kedavra\" curse. \n"}, {"text": "What curse does Harry learn Snape invented?", "correct": "Sectumsempra", "options": ["Impedimenta", "Petrificus Totalus", "Avada Kedavra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSectumsempra.\n\n\t\"Sectumsempra\" was the curse that Harry used earlier on Draco not knowing what it did. It turned out that it was like someone taking a huge knife and slashing another person up with it. After Snape kills Dumbledore, Harry tries to use the same curse on Snape, and Snape says: \"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince!\" \n"}, {"text": "Harry makes a rather surprising comment at the end of the book, what does he tell Ron and Hermione?", "correct": "He's not returning to Hogwarts next year", "options": ["He is going to marry Ginny", "He too is a Death Eater", "He killed Snape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's not returning to Hogwarts next year.\n\n\tHe says he can't return to Hogwarts because he has to find the Horcruxes and finish off Voldemort for good. He also says if he runs into Snape, he'll finish him off too. Harry was very loyal to Dumbledore, much to the annoyance of the Ministry of Magic. He didn't like Snape before, but now, he hates him and wants to see him dead. Harry actually breaks up with Ginny because he noticed that Voldemort likes to kill anyone he cares about. Harry cares too much about her to let her get killed. \n"}]}
