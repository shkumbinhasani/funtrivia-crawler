{"id": "86126", "name": "'D'elightful Art Terms Quiz | Art | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Art Terms"], "questions": [{"text": "The architectural 'D' word in common with the follow:  Buckminster Fuller, Filippo Brunelleschi, Thomas U. Walter and Henry Grow.  \n", "correct": "Dome & Domes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDome & Domes.\n\n\tAll of these individuals were responsible for the design and construction of very recognizable domes.  Fuller is probably most well known for his 'geodesic dome', a hemispheric structure made up of triangular components.  Brunelleschi designed the most well recognized dome of the renaissance, the one found on the cathedral in Florence.  Probably the most well recognized dome of the modern era was created by Thomas U. Walter...it sits on the U.S. capital building.  Finally, perhaps a slightly less well-known dome-like ceiling, designed by Grow, can be found on the Morman Tabernacle Building, under which the famous choir sings! \n"}, {"text": "The terms 'dugento' or 'duecento' refer to art from which of the following centuries? \n", "correct": "13th Century", "options": ["12th Century", "20th Century", "8th Century"], "explanation": "\n\n\n13th Century.\n\n\tThis is the Italian term for 'two hundred', and makes sense when we realize that the 13th century goes from 1201-1300!  The term for the 14th century would be 'tricento', while the 15th century is known as the 'quattrocento'.  Perhaps the greatest artists from the dugento were Cimabue and Duccio. \n"}, {"text": "A primitivist religious art exhibition set up in Moscow in 1912 by Goncharova and Larionov, it took its name from an earlier exhibition in Paris.  Which animal's name was involved in what became a very controversial exhibition for the conservative Moscovites?  \n", "correct": "Donkey", "options": ["Dachshund", "Dugong", "Duck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDonkey.\n\n\tThe 'Donkey's Tail' exhibition was named for an art show in Paris in which several artists had displayed a picture which they claimed had been painted with a brush tied to a donkey's tail.  Although most of the artists who participated in the exhibition in Moscow seemed to get the joke, the conservative establishment was not amused.  Needless to say, the exhibition helped enhance the reputations of Goncharova and Larionov, as well as the other artists who exhibited there, including Malevich and Tatlin. \n"}, {"text": "The term 'Divisionism' was preferred by which of these artists to the more well known title of the art movement he helped to create (more well-known name also listed in the answer choices)?  \n", "correct": "Seurat and Pointillism", "options": ["Delauney and Orphism", "Picasso and Cubism", "Matisse and Fauvism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeurat and Pointillism.\n\n\tWhile most of us probably refer to it as pointillism, the system within which the melding of colors is affected by the juxtaposition of thousands of dots of paint was more lovingly referred to as Divisionism by Georges Seurat. \n"}, {"text": "A term for a picture or painting with two parts facing each other, often hinged, much like pages in a book.  \n", "correct": "Diptych", "options": ["Divider", "Diorama", "Divertimente"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiptych.\n\n\tThe earliest Diptychs date back to the Roman era, those being 'consular diptychs' (ivory carvings) which were passed out by individuals who attained an official position in the government.  A three paneled version would be called a triptych, or polyptych if you prefer (also used for 4 or more). \n"}, {"text": "The name of this art movement was chosen at random when a knife came down on a French hobby horse in the dictionary.  What is this movement called?  \n", "correct": "Dada  & Dadaism", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDada  & Dadaism.\n\n\tThere are many fun Dada artists, perhaps the most famous being Duchamp, Arp, Picabia and Schwitters.  'Dada' is a French term for hobby horse...a silly name for an outrageous art movement! \n"}, {"text": "The term 'Degenerate' was applied to the various forms of modern art by which of these world leaders?  \n", "correct": "Hitler", "options": ["Mussolini", "Stalin", "Mao"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHitler.\n\n\tDuring the 1930s the Nazis attempted to discredit the various modern art movements, such as Expressionism, by labeling the practicioners as degenerates.  In 1937 a travelling show of 'degenerate' art was held, within which the art of greats like Kandinsky, Beckmann and Picasso were displayed alongside artwork created by inmates from asylums.  The 'degenerate' artists were not allowed, during the Nazi era, to exhibit their own works, and in many cases their works were confiscated and destroyed.  One of Oscar Kokoschka's most famous works, 'Portrait of a Degenerate Artist', mocks the Nazis nicely I think. \n"}, {"text": "This is a type of paint in which water or glue is mixed with pigment.  \n", "correct": "Distemper", "options": ["Dinanderie", "Drolerie", "Dolmen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDistemper.\n\n\tWhitewash is an example of this very cheap form of paint that is most often used for large scale works like Murals.  Its drawback is that it is impermanent. \n"}, {"text": "In this modern art form pieces of paper and other materials that have been layered onto a canvas, for example, are torn away in various patterns.  What is it called?  \n", "correct": "D\u00e9collage", "options": ["Disegno", "Deconstruction", "Diminishment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nD\u00e9collage.\n\n\tEssentially, D\u00e9collage is the opposite of Collage, an artform in which various pieces of material are added to the canvas.  D\u00e9collage sounds more fun to me... \n"}, {"text": "The first widely used single-image photographic process was named for which inventor?  \n", "correct": "Daguerre & Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre & Louis Daguerre", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaguerre & Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre & Louis Daguerre.\n\n\tDaguerre, together with Joseph Ni\u00e9pce, produced what are widely considered to be the first photographs, called 'Daguerreotypes'.  I hope there weren't too many toughies here...and that you 'E'lect to take my 'E' art terms quiz...coming soon (not to mention my 'D'aring Asian 'D' art terms quiz!) \n"}]}
