{"id": "337959", "name": "Invisible Monsters Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "What 2001 remake featured murderous specters which could only be seen with special goggles?", "correct": "Thir13en Ghosts", "options": ["The House on Haunted Hill", "Ghost Ship", "Darkness Falls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThir13en Ghosts.\n\n\t\"Thir13en Ghosts\" starred Tony Shalhoub, Shannon Elizabeth (in a role too young for her age) and Matthew Lillard.  The movie involved a man and his family inheriting a luxurious glass house from an eccentric, ghost-hunting uncle.  When they took the house for a test ride and found that it was inhabited by a dozen ravenous ghosts, all of which were placed in unique containment units in the basement, they fought to find a way out.  Fortunately, the whole place sealed off.  Most importantly, the evils were ghosts; the main characters needed to wear special 'ghost-seeing goggles' in order to know what they were up against.  Ironically, a lot of people were killed by the mechanisms of the house as opposed to the ghouls within.  You shouldn't throw stones in glass houses... you shouldn't harbour ravenous ghosts either.\r\"Thir13en Ghosts\" earned over $68,000,000 in the box office and became Dark Castle Entertainment's second box office success (after \"The House on Haunted Hill\").  It was one of the production company's highest-earners in its first decade and it was a remake of William Castle's 1960 film \"13 Ghosts\".  Director Steve Beck also directed \"Ghost Ship\" in 2002. \n"}, {"text": "Following a couple experiencing inexplicable spooky events in their house, what 2009 movie involved an evil which remained unseen until it possessed one of the protagonists?", "correct": "Paranormal Activity", "options": ["Possession", "Parasomnia", "The Last Exorcist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParanormal Activity.\n\n\tDespite knowledge of a possible evil demon suspected to be lurking in their home, Micah and Katie never witnessed the true form of the evil specter throughout the entirety of the 2009 independent hit, \"Paranormal Activity\".  After several paranormal events recorded on Micah's HD video camera, the couple's prying into the mysteries of their home and the hauntings of Katie's past triggered a final attack in which the invisible demon took over Katie's body.  The events of the original \"Paranormal Activity\" were preceded by the events shown in \"Paranormal Activity 2\" during which, once again, no monster was clearly shown.\rMade on a meager $15,000 budget, the original film earned almost $200,000,000 overall.  The second, likewise, earned $175,000,000.  Both were relatively well-received by critics and viewers alike. \n"}, {"text": "In what 2009 film (based on a Clive Barker short story) did investigators attempt to witness events at 'the intersections of the highways of the dead'?", "correct": "Book of Blood", "options": ["Candyman", "Dread", "Midnight Meat Train"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBook of Blood.\n\n\tMany people, upon entering the house at the corner of Jerusalem Street, found themselves befalling a tragic end at the hands of ravenous spirits wavering between the physical and spiritual realms in this movie based on Clive Barker's original \"Book of Blood\" short story.  When one person who purported to have psychic connections volunteered to stay in the attic room, he was subsequently attacked and written on by the invisible ghosts looking to tell their stories.  Etching their words into his flesh, he became the book of blood.  The characters were unable to see most ghosts in the film until the very end.\r\"Book of Blood\" never received a wide release in theaters (in 2009) though it did show in a few international film festivals.  Director John Harrison also worked with George A. Romero on the zombie flick \"Diary of the Dead\". \n"}, {"text": "Set in the town of Antonio Bay, what 1980 John Carpenter film involved the hidden spirits of a boat crew?", "correct": "The Fog", "options": ["The Rig", "The Mist", "The Frighteners"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fog.\n\n\tSet in a sleepy oceanfront town, \"The Fog\" involved the vengeful ghosts of a ship crew killed a century earlier seeking reparations for their lost lives and stolen treasures.  Rather than haunt as normal, these ghosts traveled around in a mysterious fog which rolled in over the waters seeking their lost gold (which was used to found the town of Antonio Bay) and killing six people (some of whom were offspring of the original murderers).\rMade two years after John Carpenter's most-celebrated horror film, \"Halloween\", \"The Fog\" was still a moderate success taking in over $20,000,000 in the U.S. box office and becoming one of his most well-known works.  It starred Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis (and her mother, Janet Leigh), and Hal Holbrook.  A very poorly-received remake was released in 2005. \n"}, {"text": "In this 2005 Michael Keaton film, the evil demons found within simple static were nothing more than shadows.  What movie was it?", "correct": "White Noise", "options": ["Flatliners", "Stir of Echoes", "The Dead Zone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite Noise.\n\n\tIn this movie, Michael Keaton played a man distraught over the death of his wife.  His grieving soon caused him to investigate the paranormal, specifically white noise and sounds heard within loud static.  Unfortunately, what he found there was much darker than he imagined, and the demons waiting in the white noise intended to stop his prying once and for all.  Throughout the movie, the evil forces are merely seen in shadows either in the white noise itself or in the darkness.\rProduced by Geoffrey Sax, \"White Noise\" earned over $90,000,000 in the box office becoming a successful supernatural thriller with horror elements therein.  Although critically panned, certain parts of the film were sure to cause a jump; its playing with sound was certainly an interesting venture.  A sequel (\"White Noise: The Light\") was released in 2007. It starred Nathan Fillion, and was directed by Patrick Lussier. \n"}, {"text": "In what 2000 film did Death trigger disasters on airplanes, on railroad tracks, and in the household?", "correct": "Final Destination", "options": ["They", "The Others", "The Mothman Prophecies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinal Destination.\n\n\t\"Final Destination\" starred Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Seann William Scott, and others as a group of teens taking a field trip abroad.  When Sawa's character, Alex, had a premonition of the plane crashing shortly after take-off, he got himself and others forcibly removed from the plane, sparing their lives.  Unfortunately, Death needed to claim their lives and Alex's actions only temporarily offset Death's fateful plans.\r\"Final Destination\" was a hit upon its release in 2000 earning over $110,000,000 in the box office.  It was followed by many sequels (some in 3D), many of which received critical panning despite earning tons of money.  Director James Wong also directed the third film in the series.  For many fans (as with the \"Saw\" series) the films became more of a series of 'howdunnits' rather than 'whodunnits' as the general expectations of all of the \"Final Destination\" films involved the fact that almost all of the characters would die in unique, obscure ways. \n"}, {"text": "What 2006 Thai movie involved an office worker who completed a series of increasingly horrific tasks transmitted via anonymous phone calls?", "correct": "13: Beloved", "options": ["The Victim", "Pisaj", "The Eye"], "explanation": "\n\n\n13: Beloved.\n\n\tAlso known as \"13: Game of Death\" in North America, \"13: Beloved\" followed Phuchit, an office worker, as he became part of a sinister game at a moment in his life when he was the most vulnerable.  Although the tasks started simple ('swat a fly', for example), they progressively got worse and worse culminating in murder and patricide.  He's told that if he can complete all 13 tasks, he'll win one hundred million baht.  Phuchit never discovered who was behind the game he became a part of.  While another character found a young boy to be behind the calls, it was clear that the boy was just another cog in the machine and that the game's magnitude couldn't be determined.\r\"13: Beloved\" was popular with critics and viewers in its home country, Thailand, and was screened in film festivals in North America before being brought to Canada and the United States under the Dimension Extreme DVD label. \n"}, {"text": "In 2011, what horror film by James Wan involved invisible creatures which resided in an astral plane known as 'The Further'?", "correct": "Insidious", "options": ["My Soul To Take", "Drag Me to Hell", "Priest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsidious.\n\n\tAlthough \"Insidious\" started out as a typical haunted house film, it was soon discovered that the house was not what was haunted; it was a family's one son who had fallen into a coma after falling from their attic.  When a psychic and two investigators came by to solve the mysteries plaguing the child, they discovered that he was being attacked by a red-faced demon in a different Astral Plane.  On many occasions, the demons remained unseen to the people in the movie and the audience, but when they appeared at long last, they were something else.\r\"Insidious\" became one of the more profitable horror films in early 2011 taking in over $50,000,000 in the box office (being made for only $1,500,000).  It was relatively well-received critically and became director James Wan's biggest hit since \"Saw\".  It starred Rose Byrne, Patrick Wilson, and Barbara Hershey. \n"}, {"text": "In what 2008 Alexandre Aja film did characters require reflective surfaces to see the ghosts haunting them?", "correct": "Mirrors", "options": ["Shutter", "Dark Mirror", "Possession"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMirrors.\n\n\t\"Mirrors\" starred Kiefer Sutherland as a security guard beginning a new job in a burnt-out department store which was once a major New York attraction.  On his first night in the building, he came to discover that the haunting presences from the tragedy that once tore apart the building still resided in the structure's countless mirrors, and that they would stop at nothing to hurt those around him through their reflections.  A true form for the evils in this movie was never revealed; the specters took on whatever form appeared in their mirrors and manipulated them to affect those in the real world.\r\"Mirrors\" was directed and written by Alexandre Aja, the French filmmaker known for \"Haute Tension\", the remake of \"The Hills Have Eyes\", and \"Piranha 3D\".  \"Mirrors\" earned over $75,000,000 in the box office despite critical panning and was followed up by a DVD sequel starring Nick Stahl.  \"Mirrors\" was based on a Korean horror film known as \"Into the Mirror\" which had a very similar premise. \n"}, {"text": "It wasn't until the sequel to what 1999 handycam-made film that viewers discovered the evils in the woods were actually living people?", "correct": "The Blair Witch Project", "options": ["Eden Lake", "The Last House in the Woods", "The Village"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blair Witch Project.\n\n\tFilmed in a cinema-verite, found-footage style, \"The Blair Witch Project\" was set in a wooded area outside Burkittsville, Maryland.  Following three people searching for the truth about the infamous Blair Witch of local legend, much of the horror of the film came from the lack of seeing anything at all.  After burning a map, getting too lost, and losing one of their trio, they came across a house and... still... didn't find a clear sighting of the witch.  In the second film (released in 2000 and subtitled \"Book of Shadows\"), it was determined that a group of people was responsible for the murders, but it can be assumed that they were possessed by the Blair Witch.\r\"The Blair Witch Project\", until \"Paranormal Activity\" was released over a decade later, was the top-earning independent film ever made (it was created for $500,000 and earned almost $250,000,000).  While critics praised the film, it has polarized viewers for years as some have considered it to lack many horror elements.  Nevertheless, it spurred a whole slew of popular (and unpopular) found-footage-style horror films in the 2000s. \n"}]}
