{"id": "146763", "name": "'Dances with Wolves', Part 1 Trivia Game | Dances with Wolves . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Dances with Wolves"], "questions": [{"text": "Of the following Academy Awards, which was NOT won by the individual in question?", "correct": "Best Actor by Kevin Costner", "options": ["Best Director by Kevin Costner", "Best Original Score by John Barry", "Best Adapted Screenplay by Michael Blake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBest Actor by Kevin Costner.\n\n\tWhile the academy was apparently impressed by the technical aspects of the film 'Dances with Wolves', the acting was not equally rewarded.  Costner lost out in his Best Actor nomination, as did Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene in their nominations for supporting roles.  John Barry's soundtrack provided a wonderful backdrop for the film, a well-deserved award.  Michael Blake's screenplay, adapted from his own novel, was equally well-deserved. \n"}, {"text": "The film opens during the time of the U.S. Civil War.  Lieutenant John J. Dunbar, portrayed by Costner, lies on a hospital bed a bloody mess.  Two men negotiate about performing what procedure on the hapless Dunbar?", "correct": "Removing a foot", "options": ["Repairing a gash in his leg", "Removing an arm", "Operating on his skull"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRemoving a foot.\n\n\tWords like 'saw' and 'gangrene' are bandied about by the two 'doctors', who also announce they are out of ether.  Fortunately, they decide to 'coffee up' before performing their grim task.  This gives Dunbar a chance to replace his boot upon his bloodied foot and get himself out of reach of these two sawbones! \n"}, {"text": "Following the gruesome hospital scene, the credits roll.  We then see a group of Union officers upon a hill observing the location of their military encampment.  What is this location?", "correct": "St. David's Field", "options": ["Fort Pillow", "Cold Harbor", "Sharpsburg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. David's Field\n\n\tIt is 1863, and the location is St. David's Field, Tennessee.  The Union army, led by General Tide, is confronted by Confederate troops led by a certain Colonel Tucker.  So far as I know, these places and people are all fictional. \n"}, {"text": "John Dunbar, fearing that his life is forfeit as a result of his injuries, decides to take a suicide ride on an officer's horse.  What is the name of the horse that he bravely (or foolishly) rides across the enemy front line?", "correct": "Cisco", "options": ["Jester", "Torero", "Algonquin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCisco.\n\n\tDunbar makes not one but two passes across the Confederate line, allowing the soldiers a free shot, albeit a moving one.  After the second pass, the Union generals take advantage of the distraction to mount a charge against their enemies.  The battle turns into a rout and Dunbar is labeled a hero! \n"}, {"text": "After his involvement in the successful battle at his previous post, Dunbar is awarded the choice of any post he desires.  He chooses to be sent to the western frontier, and awaits his orders at which frontier fort?", "correct": "Fort Hays", "options": ["Fort Atkinson", "Fort Scott", "Fort Robinson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFort Hays.\n\n\tThe Fort Hays of the film is supposed to be situated on the prairie which would likely make this the Fort Hays located in Kansas.  Dunbar finds the place full of activity as the conquering of the American West is still under progress. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the egomaniacal and rather disgusting Army Major who provides Lieutenant Dunbar with his orders?", "correct": "Major Fambrough", "options": ["Major O'Donnell", "Major Heinz", "Major Arouet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor Fambrough.\n\n\tFambrough is an odd sort, to say the least.  He refers to Dunbar as 'Sir Knight', and speaks in an extremely condescending manner.  Later, he announces that he has 'wet himself'.  Just as Dunbar sets off on his horse, he hears a gunshot ringing out in the background.  Fambrough has taken his own life. \n"}, {"text": "Dunbar is assigned to the 'furthermost outpost of the realm', under the command of a certain Captain Cargill.  What is the name of this tiny Army outpost in the lone prairie?", "correct": "Fort Sedgwick", "options": ["Fort Larned", "Fort Irwin", "Fort Riley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFort Sedgwick.\n\n\tAnother historic place.  Fort Sedgwick was located in what is now eastern Colorado.  It's alternate name, adopted by Union troops, was 'Fort Hell'.  Fort Sedgwick was meant to serve as a guardpost along the transcontinental railroad, a place for only the bravest of 'Indian fighters'.  It's original name was Camp Rankin. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the 'peasant', equipped with a mule cart, that will lead Lt. Dunbar to his post out on the prairie?", "correct": "Timmons", "options": ["Holtzmann", "O'Flannery", "Brugel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTimmons.\n\n\tFambrough calls Timmons a 'peasant'...perhaps he's right about that one!  Timmons is truly an individual of little manners, though his love of his mules is quite endearing.  Timmons appears to love raw bacon, doesn't understand the concept of a 'trash can', and cannot control his problems with flatulence. \n"}, {"text": "What ill-omen does Dunbar see along the way across the prairie that reminds him of the presence of potentially unfriendly natives?", "correct": "A broken wagon", "options": ["A human scalp", "Smoke signals", "A horse skeleton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA broken wagon.\n\n\tAlong with the broken down wagon, Dunbar discovers a human skeleton and the arrow that felled the former owner of the bones.  From this point on, Dunbar understands that he must be vigilant at all times in case he might encounter unfriendly Indians. \n"}, {"text": "When the Lieutenant reaches his destination, he finds that the fort is completely deserted of human beings.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn the extended version, you see Captain Cargill assemble the remainder of his men (those who haven't deserted or been killed in Indian fighting).  He announces that it is time to return to Fort Hayes, and they do just that.  Dunbar is stuck alone with months and months worth of supplies for an entire detachment of men.  Join me in part two in order to see how he copes!  Thank you for playing this quiz. \n"}]}
