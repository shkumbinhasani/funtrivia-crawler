The Aztecs even used this to make a drink, adding a bit of cayenne to it.  The drink was bitter, but now bars of this are sweet.  What could this be?", "correct": "Chocolate", "options": ["Cinnamon", "Curry", "Cumin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate.\n\n\tChocolate is derived from the cacao plant.  The cacao pod carried dozens of seeds, which are yet smaller pods.  In these smaller pods is what is eaten.  A long and tedious process is involved to make the chocolate we know today.  The cacao seeds dry out in the sun, go through long processes, and cocoa powder is made. Cocoa butter, made from a completely different process, is added to cocoa powder to make chocolate.  Cocoa butter is really what gives chocolate its sweet flavor.  If there is more cocoa powder than cocoa butter, it will be more bitter, and dark chocolate is formed.  If no cocoa powder is used at all, and just the cocoa butter is eaten, that is white chocolate. \n"}, {"text": "A favorite treat to give to kids during the Halloween holiday, this, although its name says otherwise, is NOT a grain product.  What is this treat?", "correct": "Candy Corn", "options": ["Candy Cane", "Candy Carrot", "Candy Celery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCandy Corn.\n\n\tCandy Corn is known to be in the shape of a kernel.  That is why it is named after corn.  The candy has three colored stripes, the lower part being white, the middle being orange, and the tip of the \"kernel\" is yellow. \n"}, {"text": "What in the world is cuy?", "correct": "Guinea Pig", "options": ["Hamster", "Mouse", "Rabbit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuinea Pig.\n\n\tCuy is the meat of a guinea pig.  Guinea pigs are common pet rodents.  They are similar to hamsters, but they do not bite as often and they have a tail.  Cuy is described of as tasting like chicken (but then again, what ISN'T), but with much more protein. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these best describes a deep-fried burrito?", "correct": "Chimichanga", "options": ["Empanada", "Chorizo", "Chalupa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChimichanga.\n\n\tChimichangas can be filled with almost anything.  Chimichangas are served in Southwestern cuisine, Tex-Mex cuisine, and some parts of Mexico.  Most chimichangas are filled with meat and cheese, and sometimes beans.  However, they can include anything, like rice. \n"}, {"text": "What is Creme fraiche often described as?", "correct": "Sour cream", "options": ["Cream cheese", "Yoghurt", "Whipped Cream"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSour cream.\n\n\tAlthough Creme fraiche is described as being similar to sour cream, it is much sweeter.  Many eat it with strawberries, to make strawberries and cream.  Creme fraiche more often replaces yoghurt in recipes than it does sour cream.  Because it is more sweet than sour, it is much more preferable on fruit than it is on a taco! \n"}, {"text": "What tea claims to calm someone down enough to go to sleep?", "correct": "Chamomile", "options": ["Chives", "Cinnamon", "Cardamom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChamomile.\n\n\tChamomile tea has chemicals in it that puts people to sleep.  It probably doesn't work so well when it is chock full of honey and sugar, though.  A famous American brand of tea is Celestial Seasonings, with dozens of different tea flavors.  Chamomile is one of their most popular. \n"}, {"text": "In France, the portobello mushroom is known as what?", "correct": "Champignon de Paris", "options": ["Champignon de Marseille", "Champignon de Bordeaux", "Champignon de Nice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChampignon de Paris.\n\n\tThe portobello, or champignon de Paris, is known as having a very large top.  Common mushrooms, known as button mushrooms, have very tight caps that are also very small.  The cap on the portobello is gigantic.  It is big enough that the portobello replaces hamburger patties to make portobello burgers, and it can replace bread to make a mushroom sandwich. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is a chicken dish that means \"hunter\" in Italian?", "correct": "Cacciatore", "options": ["Cordon Bleu", "Ciev", "Chennai"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCacciatore.\n\n\tChicken Chennai is a very spicy Mexican dish.  Chicken Cordon Bleu involves chicken, ham, and cheese.  Chicken Ciev does not exist.  Chicken Kiev, however, is a chicken filled with butter and herbs and baked.  Chicken Cacciatore is an Italian dish, a chicken cooked with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, herbs, and bell pepper. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is most commonly a dried and ground flower bud?", "correct": "Cloves", "options": ["Chives", "Clives", "Choves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCloves.\n\n\tChoves and Clives do not exist, unless you are talking about Clive Cussler.  Chives are an oniony herb.  In fact, chives are the smallest of the onion family, similar to the larger scallion (or green onion), and the even larger leek.  Cloves are spicy like cinnamon, not like cayenne.  They are spicy flower buds that are normally dry and ground. Sometimes, however, the entire clove is used in a recipe, although, most often, they are too bitter and spicy to eat.  They do add an incredible flavor to a dish.  Like cumin, cinnamon, and nutmeg, however, a little goes a long way.  It is extremely easy to \"over-clove-ify\" a dish. (Yes, I made that word up, but it makes sense, doesn't it?) \n"}, {"text": "I can't leave without a little sweet dessert.  Which of these is the most commonly eaten cookie in America?  ", "correct": "Chocolate Chip Cookie", "options": ["Chocolate Cheesecake Cookie", "Chocolate Chunk Cookie", "Chocolate Fudge Cookie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate Chip Cookie.\n\n\tThe chocolate chip cookie is the most popular cookie flavor in America.  Ruth Wakefield was the first person to make the cookie, in 1934, but it was a complete accident.  The chocolate chip cookie became one of the greatest marketed cookies of all time, and has today been manufactured more than any other flavor of cookie.\r I hope you enjoyed the quiz.  Please rate it before you leave.  And wipe up that drool, will ya?  ;-) \n"}]}
