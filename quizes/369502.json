{"id": "369502", "name": "Dragon Ball - King Piccolo Saga Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Dragonball Z"], "questions": [{"text": "Who freed King Piccolo?", "correct": "Emperor Pilaf", "options": ["Commander Red", "Goku", "Master Roshi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmperor Pilaf.\n\n\tGoku finds Krillin dead and everyone follows behind, arriving to find an enraged Goku.  He takes Bulma's Dragon Radar and heads off after the one responsible, only to find that two balls are in the vicinity.  The others, meanwhile, find a crest on a piece of paper sporting the word 'Devil' in a circle.  Master Roshi recognizes this as the crest of the evil King Piccolo, one of the strongest evil forces on the planet-- though he was sealed away for centuries (partly by Roshi and the Crane Hermit's mentor, who used an electronic jar before dying).  The jar was dropped into the sea and King Piccolo was never seen again.\r ...that is until Emperor Pilaf and his lackeys located the jar and freed him.  King Piccolo says that he seeks not control over the world; he seeks eternal youth.  Piccolo's first underling heads to Pilaf's airship as they speak....until he's intercepted by Goku on the Flying Nimbus. \n"}, {"text": "Who killed Krillin at the World Martial Arts Tournament?", "correct": "Tambourine", "options": ["An unnamed assassin", "King Piccolo", "Chiaotzu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTambourine.\n\n\tWhen Goku catches up to Piccolo's underling, the creature, known as Tambourine, relishes in the fact that he killed Krillin and stole the Dragon Ball.  Unfortunately, Krillin was simply too slow to fight his opponent and fell to his power.  The enemy's power also proves to be too much for Goku who, after expending his energy in the World Martial Arts Tournament, is too weak to battle.  He ends up getting knocked from the sky and mercilessly beaten.\r While the others head back to the Kame House to bury Krillin, Goku is left in the woods and Tambourine is sent to kill former competitors in the World Martial Arts Tournament. \n"}, {"text": "Who does King Piccolo send to collect the Dragon Balls from around the world?", "correct": "Cymbal", "options": ["Seeker", "Triangle", "Snare"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCymbal.\n\n\tWhile Tambourine continues to destroy expert martial artists, King Piccolo forms and vomits an egg from his stomach, giving birth to Cymbal, a dragon-like creature whose sole purpose is to collect the Dragon Balls and complete the set for his wish of eternal youth.  At the same time, the group at the Kame House decides that collecting the Dragon Balls will either allow them to bring back Krillin or defeat King Piccolo.  Bulma constructs a new Dragon Radar before they head out.\r Goku, meanwhile, awakens in the woods to discover how hungry he really is.  When he finds a fish roasting over a fire, he's found by its owner who challenges him to a fight until Goku notes that, by coincidence, his fighter has a Dragon Ball.  Unfortunately, Cymbal arrives at the same time, leading to another battle.  In a twist of fate, Cymbal is dispatched easily-- bisected, in fact, with a samurai sword-- when a nomad steps in. \n"}, {"text": "How do Goku's friends move the Kame House to a new location?", "correct": "They store it in a Dyno-Cap", "options": ["They tow it", "They take it apart and rebuild it", "They move the island it's on"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey store it in a Dyno-Cap.\n\n\tBulma, Yamcha, and the rest bring the Kame House to a new island and plan to bury Krillin in a cryogenic chamber while Master Roshi, Tien Shinhan, and Chiaotzu head out to collect the other Dragon Balls.  Unfortunately, the move doesn't stop Tambourine from finding the place; he arrives to defeat Yamcha but is pulled away by King Piccolo, who seeks revenge against Cymbal's killer.  Tambourine eventually does catch up and Goku, now empowered and full, manages to win the battle with a Kamehameha Wave, spurring King Piccolo to take matters into his own hands.\r Master Roshi, Tien, and Chiaotzu end up collecting the other Dragon Balls, finding the other five while Goku tries to claim another one. \n"}, {"text": "Who decides to bring Goku to Korin's Tower?", "correct": "Yajirobe", "options": ["Master Roshi", "Emperor Pilaf", "Yamcha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYajirobe.\n\n\tKing Piccolo descends from Emperor Pilaf's aircraft to do battle with Goku and claim Yajirobe's Dragon Ball.  Unfortunately, although Goku is strong, King Piccolo is stronger; he paralyzes Goku and wins the battle, claiming the Dragon Ball in his possession and leaving him in the rain to die.  Fortunately, since Piccolo leaves, this allows Yajirobe to take Goku back to Korin's Tower to recover.\r In the meantime, Roshi decides to head off to get the two Dragon Balls from Piccolo...though when he knocks out Tien it's clear that he has an agenda. \n"}, {"text": "Master Roshi makes an attempt to trap King Piccolo with the Evil Containment Wave.  Does he succeed?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAfter hiding the Dragon Balls in a deep hole and preventing Tien from fighting, Master Roshi forces Chiaotzu to stay in hiding and steps out to stop Piccolo, who's eaten his two Dragon Balls, alone.  Piccolo emerges and Roshi reveals the location of the balls, but states that he will only relinquish them if his enemy wins. Roshi proves fortuitous in the face of true evil and reveals the ace up his sleeve-- the Evil Containment Wave.  Bringing forth an electronic jar, Roshi begins the process, frightening King Piccolo enough to urge him to attempt escape.  Unfortunately, however, the powerful spell is not successful; Roshi misses the electronic jar and wastes his strength. This, in turn, allows Piccolo to get the upper hand.  This manages to kill the failed master in front of his pupils...and collect the Dragon Balls...and summon Shenron. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Kingdoms is the first to be conquered after the return of the Eternal Dragon?", "correct": "Chow Kingdom", "options": ["Fire Kingdom", "Desert Kingdom", "Animal Kingdom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChow Kingdom.\n\n\tKing Piccolo's goal comes to fruition; with all seven balls in his possession he summons the eternal dragon, Shenron, calling upon him to make his wish.  Tien, attempting to salvage the fight, telepathically tells Chiaotzu to wish King Piccolo away but, in making this wish he ends up getting killed in a single blow.  With no one to stop him, King Piccolo makes his wish for youth and, before the Dragon Balls can be used again, he kills Shenron with a single blast.  The balls become nothing but meager stones and drop to the ground as Piccolo departs.  Tien, of course, vows to get revenge, deciding to learn the Evil Containment Wave himself as the others arrive to cryogenically freeze their fallen friends.\r Piccolo heads directly to the nearby Chow Kingdom, dropping Emperor Pilaf from his own ship on the way.  It takes no effort to invade King Furry's land. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Goku find in the icy labyrinth?", "correct": "Ultra Divine Water", "options": ["Cumulonimbus Cloud", "A Superpower Pole", "A Dragon Ball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUltra Divine Water.\n\n\tWhen Goku arrives at Korin's Tower he reunites with Upa and Bora before Yajirobe brings him to the top (though only on the promise of food).  At the top, Korin says that there's still nothing more he can teach Goku, but there may be a way to win if he locates the Ultra Divine Water.  Of course it's far to the north in a treacherous ice labyrinth. Yajirobe says no to the voyage but accidentally falls into the mystical portal sending him to the labyrinth.  Goku heads in after him with Korin's warning to avoid the Darkness.  The trip is certainly fraught with danger.  When Goku finally comes face to face with Darkness, it appears in the form of Master Roshi. The Darkness misleads Goku before informing him that, should he be too weak, the Ultra Divine Water will actually kill him.  As it turns out, it doesn't, even though it is poisonous.  When he returns to Korin's Tower with Yajirobe, he receives a new Nimbus Cloud and, now able to sense his foe's power level, heads off to defeat King Piccolo. \n"}, {"text": "King Piccolo, at random, sets out to destroy which major location?", "correct": "West City", "options": ["Fire Kingdom", "Papaya Island", "Northern Mountains"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWest City.\n\n\tAfter giving criminals free reign of the world, King Piccolo continues to wreak havoc on the planet, setting his sights on West City by random draw.  Tien, having just mastered the Evil Containment Wave, arrives in the Chow Kingdom with the intent to use it but comes face-to-face with another of Piccolo's created goons, Drum, who he has no choice but to battle.  He's saved at the last moment by Goku, now even stronger because of the Ultra Divine Water, though the electronic jar is destroyed by Piccolo in the battle. \n"}, {"text": "Who ultimately defeats King Piccolo?", "correct": "Goku", "options": ["Tien", "Master Roshi", "Snow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoku.\n\n\tThe battle persists, and though Tien is unable to contribute significantly, Goku is able to make strong counters to Piccolo's attacks.  Piano, Piccolo's final underling, is killed during the battle and Chow Kingdom is leveled in a cataclysmic explosion, but the fight doesn't end quite yet.  Ultimately, King Piccolo is able to get the upper-hand by holding Tien hostage and wounding Goku, but a single punch through the evil king with an empowered right fist is all it takes to bring him down. Goku is saved at the last moment by Yajirobe who, looking to watch his friend in battle, jumps in to help him and Tien. King Piccolo, on the other hand, falls to his wounds...but not before creating one more underling. \n"}]}
