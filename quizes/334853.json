Average [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "Without even delving into a summary of the episode, the name \"Full House\" can be examined quite easily.  Which of these hands of cards is a Full House in poker?", "correct": "8h, 8s, 8c, 4d, 4h", "options": ["5s, 6d, 7h, 8h, 9c", "Kh, Kd, Ks, Kc, Qd", "2d, 4h, 6c, 8c, 10s"], "explanation": "\n\n\n8h, 8s, 8c, 4d, 4h.\n\n\tWhile not the rarest hand in a poker match, the Full House is certainly one of the more difficult to obtain.  To pull a Full House the player must have three cards of the same type (e.g. three 8s) and two of another (two 4s).  If two people have a full house, the higher set of three will determine the winner.  The odds of drawing this in a randomly-shuffled deck is a slight bit more likely than 1 in 700.\r Kh, Kd, Ks, Kc, Qd would be Four of a Kind in which you have four cards of the same rank.  This is the next step up from the full house but several times more rare.  Under the same circumstances, your chances are 1 in over 4,000 to draw this hand.\r5s, 6d, 7h, 8h, 9c is a Straight, a significantly easier hand than a Full House.  At approximately 1 in 250 odds, this can happen with any chain of cards as long as they form a chain of consecutive values like the example above.  If they were all the same suit, you'd have a Straight Flush (of 1 in over 70,000 odds) and if they were 10, J, Q, K, and A in the same suit they'd be the highly-coveted Royal Flush, the rarest hand in the game with odds almost as rare as 1 in 650,000.\r 2d, 4h, 6c, 8c, 10s is junk compared to the other choices.  You'd play high card (the ten of spades) and hope for the best. \n"}, {"text": "The twenty-third episode of \"Full House\" undoubtedly features popular celebrity twins Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen.

The only other bone stretching down this part of the body is the fibula found on the back side of the leg's bottom half.  The tibia is the thicker and stronger of the two.\r The humerus is in the top half of the arm; it's the long bone connecting the shoulder and elbow and it contains your biceps and triceps.  Both the radius and ulna are in the forearm.  The former is on the inside while the latter is on the outer side.\r Regardless of which bones in Jesse's arms broke, he'd need casts to allow the bone to set properly.  I'm sure it caused a bit of conflict in the episode. \n"}]}
