From 1969-1975, the group had twelve consecutive gold albums, which included 21 hit singles, with eleven of those singles making the top ten. \r \"'Til the World Ends\" was the group's last charted hit in 1975. While the song only got as high as number 32, in my humble opinion, it is one of the group's most beautifully arranged productions. \n"}, {"text": "In 1988, this former 1960's supergroup had an extremely minor hit with a song entitled \"Got It Made\", who was this band?", "correct": "Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young", "options": ["Herman's Hermits", "The Kinks", "Jefferson Airplane/Starship"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.\n\n\tWith sweet harmonies and strong political statements within their lyrics, Crosby, Stills, and Nash (and Neil Young, who joined the band in 1970) were one of the premiere groups to come out of Woodstock and rival the popularity of the Beatles in the late 1960's. The group was formed in Laurel Canyon, California from, not two, but three very popular '60's bands, The Hollies (to which Graham Nash was a member), The Byrds (a band that David Crosby was in), and Buffalo Springfield (the 'home' of Stephen Stills). Many of their songs like \"Woodstock\", \"Teach Your Children\", and \"Ohio\", and their seminal album, 'Deja Vu', they woke up a nation to ask the question \"Why?\" of their government for some of their foreign and domestic policies. They were among the recognized leaders of the 1960's counter-culture movement. \r Those days had long passed them by, however, when the group reunited with Neil Young on the album 'American Dream', in 1988. While they saw it become a Top 20 hit, when it peaked at number 16, the lone single from the album, entitled \"Got It Made\", only charted as high as number 69. In fact, in 1991, Jimmie Guterman and Owen O'Donnell, authors of the book, 'The Worst Rock and Roll Records of All Time', ranked 'American Dream' as the fourth worst album ever, which is truly a shame. For those who love CSNY, \"Got It Made\" is a real gem that got overlooked on this album and should've charted higher, in my opinion. \n"}, {"text": "This former Beatle had a top 20 hit with a song called \"Dark Horse\" in 1974, which one was it?", "correct": "George Harrison", "options": ["John Lennon", "Ringo Starr", "Paul McCartney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Harrison.\n\n\tGeorge Harrison released the album 'Dark Horse' in 1974 and the title cut went all the way to number 15. Harrison enjoyed a pretty good solo career after the Beatles broke up in 1970 scoring number 1 hits in the U.S. with songs such as \"Give Me Love\", \"My Sweet Lord\", and \"Got My Mind Set On You\". He was instrumental in putting together The Concert for Bangladesh, in 1971, becoming the first major rock star to have organized a concert for charity long before Live Aid or Farm Aid came along.Harrison was also known as a founding member of the group The Traveling Wilburys in the late 1980's, which also featured Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, and former ELO guitarist/vocalist, Jeff Lynne. \n"}, {"text": "In the Rod Stewart song \"Passion\", he mentions several cities.

Whether he is singing rocking out to his original material, teaming up with some of the industry's biggest stars for a duet, or taking on old standards from the '30's, '40's, and '50's, Rod Stewart is an international superstar with few equals.\r In 1980, Rod climbed as high as number five with his song \"Passion\", which stayed on the U.S. Billboard charts for 17 weeks. In the song, he names six cities and they are, New York, Moscow, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris, and Bangkok.
