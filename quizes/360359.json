{"id": "360359", "name": "The Republic of Zambia Quiz | Africa | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Africa", "Zambia"], "questions": [{"text": "Zambia has land borders with eight other countries. Which of these is not one of those eight?", "correct": "Uganda", "options": ["Angola", "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Malawi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUganda.\n\n\tA former British colony, Zambia is landlocked and shares land borders with eight of its neighbors. To the west of Zambia is the former Portuguese colony of Angola. To the north is the region formerly known as The Congo Free State, The Belgian Congo and Zaire, which is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. To the south is Namibia, the former South African protectorate that was once German South-West Africa. To the northeast and east are two more former British colonies, Tanzania and Malawi respectively. To the south of Zambia are another former Portuguese possession, Mozambique, and two more states that were once part of the British Empire, Zimbabwe and Botswana.\rThe odd one out of the choices above is Uganda, which is further to the northeast, beyond the DR of Congo. \n"}, {"text": "In 1935, Lusaka replaced which city that was the capital of Northern Rhodesia?", "correct": "Livingstone", "options": ["Rhodes", "Stanley", "Salisbury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLivingstone.\n\n\tLivingstone, which is also known as Maramba, is now the capital of Zambia's Southern Province. Standing on the northern bank of the Zambezi River, Livingstone is a major centre for tourists visiting Victoria Falls. Lusaka became the capital of the newly-independent state of Zambia in 1964. \n"}, {"text": "Which animal appears on the Zambian flag?", "correct": "An eagle", "options": ["A giraffe", "An elephant", "A crocodile"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn eagle.\n\n\tZambia's flag is unusual in that the design is at the outer end of the flag rather than in the centre or alongside the hoist. The flag is green with three vertical bars of red, black and orange in the bottom half of the outer quarter. Above those bars flies an eagle which represents the peoples' ability to rise above the nation's problems. \n"}, {"text": "The best-known Zambian river is the Zambezi, but which of these is NOT also a major river that flows wholly or partially through Zambia?", "correct": "Okavango", "options": ["Lungwebungu", "Kabompo", "Kafue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOkavango.\n\n\tThe Kabompo River is a major tributary of the Zambezi, rising to the east of the Zambezi's source in North-Western Province and passing through the town for which it was named before joining the Zambezi north of the town of Lukulu. The Lungwebungu River rises in Angola before flowing across Zambia to become the Upper Zambezi's largest tributary. The Kafue River is the longest and largest river that lies wholly within Zambia.\r The exception is the Okavango River, Africa's fourth-longest river system at 990 miles in length, but none of that in Zambia. It rises in Angola and forms the Angola/Namibia border before flowing across Botswana as far as the Moremi Game Reserve. \n"}, {"text": "Which ecosystem best describes most of Zambia?", "correct": "Grasslands, savannahs and shrublands", "options": ["Moist broadleaf forests", "Grasslands, savannahs and shrublands ", "Deserts and xeric shrublands", "Mangrove"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrasslands, savannahs and shrublands.\n\n\tAround 80% of Zambia falls into the \"grasslands, savannahs and shrublands\" biome. This means that the land consists of grass cover 1-2 meters high, with hardwood deciduous trees and/or hardwood shrubs. There are also small parts of the country that come under the category of \"subtropical dry broadleaf forests\". The alternatives are all zones found within the \"Afrotropic Ecozone\". \n"}, {"text": "With an area of 290,000 square miles, Zambia is slightly larger than Texas. It ranks as the world's 39th-largest country, which places it immediately between which two other countries?", "correct": "Between Chile and Burma", "options": ["Between Finland and Vietnam", "Between Peru and Chad", "Between Yemen and Thailand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBetween Chile and Burma.\n\n\tThe two countries that are most similar in size to Zambia are Chile (the world's 38th largest) and Burma (40th). One of the other pairs is significantly larger -- Peru and Chad are the world's 20th and 21st-largest countries with an area of around 496,000 square miles making them almost twice as large as Zambia. Yemen and Thailand (ranked 50th and 51st) both weigh in at around 200,000 square miles, so only two-thirds the size of Zambia. Finland and Vietnam (65th and 66th) are even smaller, at around 130,000 square miles, both would fit comfortably alongside each other inside Zambia. \n"}, {"text": "Zambia is mostly high plateau with some hills and mountains. Which of these ranges spread across the Zambia/Malawi border, contains the country's highest peaks?", "correct": "The Mafinga Hills", "options": ["The Lebombo Mountains", "The Mdimba Range", "The Bvumba Mountains"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mafinga Hills.\n\n\tThe Mafinga Hills contains the highest point in Zambia, an unnamed spot rising 7,641 feet above sea level. The Hills once meant that travel between the country's Northern and Eastern provinces was virtually impossible for the six months of the rainy season, but there is now a road that loops its way through the lower slopes. The Luangwa River, the major river of eastern Zambia, rises in the Mafinga Hills.\rOf the alternatives, The Lebombo Mountains run from Natal province to Limpopo province in South Africa and also stray into Mozambique and Swaziland. The Mdimba Range are a major series or hills and mountains in nearby Swaziland. The Bvumba Mountains straddle the border between Mozambique and Zimbabwe. \n"}, {"text": "Zambia is one of four countries that share Lake Tanganyika. Into which river does it drain?", "correct": "Congo", "options": ["Zambezi", "Orange", "Niger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCongo.\n\n\tLake Tanganyika is the world's longest freshwater lake. It is also the world's second largest freshwater lake by volume and the second deepest (in both cases after Siberia's Lake Baikal). The lake is split between four countries with Tanzania (46%) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (40%) having most of it, and Burundi and Zambia the remaining 14% between them. The water from Lake Tanganyika flows into the Congo River system and eventually finds its way to the Atlantic Ocean. \n"}, {"text": "Which is significantly the largest ethnic group in Zambian population today, with almost twice as many members as any single group? ", "correct": "Bemba", "options": ["Tonga", "White", "Lozi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBemba.\n\n\tThe Bemba people make up about 21.5% of Zambia's total population of 14 million, most of them living in the Northern, Luapula and Copperbelt provinces. Their origins are in the Luba and Lunda states of the upper Congo basin, in what is now Katanga Province in southern Congo-Kinshasa (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). Bemba is one of eight recognized regional languages in Zambia, where English is the official language. \r Of the alternatives, the Tonga people of Zambia and Zimbabwe represent about 11.3% of the Zambian population whilst the Lozi make up 5.3%. Whites account for just 1.1% of today's Zambian population. \n"}, {"text": "What is the nickname of Zambia's national soccer team?", "correct": "The Copper Bullets", "options": ["The Elephants", "The Bright Star", "The Crocodiles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Copper Bullets.\n\n\tZambian soccer has a rich history, but their crowning moment came at the 2012 African Cup of Nations when they defeated Ivory Coast on penalties in their third appearance in the final. Many older Zambian soccer fans still consider the nation's best team was the one that perished in a 1993 air crash that killed all 30 people on board including 18 players and numerous coaches.\r The Zambian national soccer team is nicknamed \"Chipolopolo\" aka \"The Copper Bullets\". \rOf the alternatives, Ivory Coast are \"The Elephants\", Lesotho are \"The Crocodiles\", and the fledgling South Sudan team are \"The Bright Star\". \n"}]}
