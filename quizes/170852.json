He played his entire seven-season NBA career with Portland.  Ilgauskas was the third Lithuanian player drafted into the NBA, by Cleveland in 1996.  Volkov was a Russian player! \n"}, {"text": "NBA player Maybyner Rodney Hilario, who began his career in the year 2002 with the Denver Nuggets, legally changed his name to which of the following in 2003?", "correct": "Nene", "options": ["Eusebio", "Ronaldo", "Acube"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNene.\n\n\tHilario officially changed his name to 'Nene', which means 'baby' in Portuguese.

He recorded a total of 1,690 blocks in 971 games with the Celtics, an average of 1.74 blocks per game.  In 1106 career games with the Celts, Parish managed 1,703 blocks, an average of 1.54 a game.  Bill Walton only played 90 games with the Celts and managed a total of 116 blocks, or 1.29 a game. In his entire career he averaged 2.21 blocks per game.  Bird only recorded .84 blocks per game.  Sadly, the blocked shot statistic was not recorded until 1973, so we will never know how many blocks Bill Russell had with the Celtics. I'm willing to bet it was more than 1.74 a game, however! \n"}, {"text": "In John Stockton's 19-year career, how many seasons did he not play in every single regular season game (reminder: the 1998-99 season was strike-shortened; each team played a total of 50 games)?", "correct": "2", "options": ["5", "0", "8"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tIncredibly, in an era where lost toenails and common colds regularly knock players out for several games, Stockton only missed a total of 22 games in his career, all during the 1989-90 season (4 games, injury and sickness) and the 1997-98 season (18 games, due to a knee injury).  Stockton played in 82 games in 16 different years, and played in all 50 of the Jazz games during the strike-shortened season.)  I just had to get in a Jazz question ... go figure huh? \n"}, {"text": "Which of these players did not score over 30,000 pts in their NBA career?", "correct": "Dominique Wilkins", "options": ["Wilt Chamberlain", "Michael Jordan", "Karl Malone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDominique Wilkins.\n\n\tAmong these NBA greats, only Dominique Wilkins, the scoring machine for the Atlanta Hawks (and later, briefly for the Celtics, Spurs and Magic), failed to score 30,000 career points, ending with 26,668 total points.
