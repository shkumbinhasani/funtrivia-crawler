Kirk (William Shatner)", "Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy)", "Commander Hikaru Sulu (George Takei)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLieutenant Saavik (Kirstie Alley).\n\n\tSaavik's voice opens the film -- oddly enough, with the word's \"Captain's log.\"  She is not a captain, of course; she is merely acting as captain during the KOBAYASHI MARU simulation. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first character *seen* in the film?", "correct": "Spock", "options": ["Sulu", "Kirk", "Saavik"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpock.\n\n\tWe hear Saavik's voice first, but Spock is the first character to appear on camera.  He is studying a tactical display of the ENTERPRISE as Saavik's voice-over is heard. \n"}, {"text": "A \"stardate\" is given at the beginning of the film -- it is a four-digit number followed by a decimal point and an additional digit.  What is the *first* number in the given stardate?", "correct": "8 & eight", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n8 & eight.\n\n\tSaavik designates the stardate as 8130.3. \n"}, {"text": "The training simulation that opens the film features a ship in distress called the KOBAYASHI MARU (whose name, in Japanese, means \"ship in distress\"!).  According to the tactical display on the viewscreen of the ENTERPRISE's main bridge, what is the last name of this troubled ship's captain?", "correct": "Vance", "options": ["Collins", "Nance", "Rollins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVance.\n\n\tBlink and you miss it, but the tactical display does name the \"master\" of the ship as Kojiro Vance. \n"}, {"text": "How many people are aboard the KOBAYASHI MARU, according the tactical display of the ENTERPRISE?", "correct": "381", "options": ["281", "481", "181"], "explanation": "\n\n\n381.\n\n\tThe KOBAYASHI MARU has a crew of 81, and it is carrying 300 passengers. \n"}, {"text": "Saavik orders Sulu to take the ENTERPRISE into the Klingon Neutral Zone in order to assist the KOBAYASHI MARU.  According to Sulu's dialogue, how long will it take the ENTERPRISE to reach the KOBAYASHI MARU?", "correct": "two minutes", "options": ["four minutes", "six minutes", "eight minutes"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwo minutes.\n\n\tSulu: \"Estimating two minutes to intercept.\" \n"}, {"text": "Once the ENTERPRISE enters the Neutral Zone, resistance from the Klingons appears almost instantly.  How many Klingon vessels have arrived to oppose the ENTERPRISE, according to the image on the viewscreen?", "correct": "3 & three", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n3 & three.\n\n\tIf the shots of the three Klingon battle cruisers look familiar, that's because they're actually recycled footage from \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" (1979). \n"}, {"text": "A number of characters are seemingly \"killed\" during the KOBAYASHI MARU simulation.  Who is *not* one of them?", "correct": "Commander Montgomery Scott (James Doohan)", "options": ["Doctor Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForrest Kelley)", "Spock", "Lt. Commander Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommander Montgomery Scott (James Doohan).\n\n\tMcCoy, Uhura, and Spock all \"played dead\" for the purposes of the simulation.  Scotty, however, wasn't even on the bridge at the time. \n"}, {"text": "As Kirk and Spock chat in the aftermath of Saavik's KOBAYASHI MARU simulation, they pass a laborer performing a menial task.  What is this man doing?", "correct": "vacuuming the floor", "options": ["welding a panel closed", "painting a wall", "washing a window"], "explanation": "\n\n\nvacuuming the floor.\n\n\tDirector Nick Meyer states in his DVD commentary that he didn't want Kirk to notice the laborer at all, but William Shatner took a long, curious look at the man.  Meyer didn't think it would be worth the time to re-shoot the scene, so that's the take we see in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Spock gives Kirk a book as a birthday present.  Who wrote the book?", "correct": "Charles Dickens", "options": ["Herman Melville", "William Faulkner", "Ernest Hemingway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles Dickens.\n\n\tThe book is \"A Tale of Two Cities.\"  Kirk recites both the first and last lines of the book before the film is over. \n"}, {"text": "As stated above, it is James T. Kirk's birthday when the film opens.  Which birthday is Kirk celebrating, for better or worse?", "correct": "It's never said", "options": ["53rd", "49th", "50th"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's never said.\n\n\tDirector Nick Meyer was insistent that Kirk's 49th birthday be stated overtly in dialogue, but William Shatner demanded that Kirk's exact age remain unrevealed.  Shatner won: we're never told how old Kirk is. \n"}, {"text": "We learn in this film that Jim Kirk is allergic to something.  What is it?", "correct": "Retinax", "options": ["Romulan ale", "wool", "strawberries"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRetinax.\n\n\tMcCoy gives Kirk reading glasses for his birthday.  He tells his friend and commanding officer that, for patients of Kirk's age, he usually administers (or \"recommends,\" depending on which version of the film you see) Retinax 5 -- presumably medication that improves eyesight -- but Kirk immediately notes that he is allergic to Retinax, a fact that McCoy obviously knows already. \n"}, {"text": "Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) is noticeably absent from the ENTERPRISE crew in the beginning of the film.  This is because he has been, at some offscreen point, reassigned to the USS RELIANT.  What is Chekov's position aboard the RELIANT?", "correct": "First Officer", "options": ["Chief Navigator", "Chief of Security", "Science Officer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFirst Officer.\n\n\tChekov's initial \"Ship's log\" entry makes it clear that he is the first officer of the USS RELIANT. \n"}, {"text": "Chekov is not the only ENTERPRISE alum aboard the RELIANT.  What other familiar officer from the original TV series now serves on the RELIANT?", "correct": "Kyle (John Winston)", "options": ["Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney)", "Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett Roddenberry)", "Kevin Riley (Bruce Hyde)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKyle (John Winston).\n\n\tKyle -- whose first name has been lost to history, if it was ever known -- was the Transporter Chief in a number of original \"Star Trek\" episodes (including \"Space Seed,\" the episode in which Khan Noonien Singh first appeared!)  Since then, he has apparently been promoted to the rank of commander, and has moved from transporter operations to communications. \n"}, {"text": "Finish this quote from Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch): \"You boys have to be sure about this.  There can't be so much as _____________, or the show's off.\"", "correct": "a microbe", "options": ["a molecule", "an ameoba", "a flatworm"], "explanation": "\n\n\na microbe.\n\n\tDr. Marcus is adamant about the test site for the Genesis Project being 100% lifeless. \n"}, {"text": "What is the last name of the captain of the USS RELIANT?", "correct": "Terrell", "options": ["Clark", "Winfield", "Beach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerrell.\n\n\tPaul Winfield played Captain Clark Terrell.  Beach (Paul Kent) was the science officer. \n"}, {"text": "As Carol Marcus and her son, Dr. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick), leave the main lab at Space Station Regula 1 and chat in the corridor, the door that closes behind them is emblazoned with a certain descriptive label.  What does it say?", "correct": "Thermonics", "options": ["Geophysics", "Lab 34", "Operations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThermonics.\n\n\tAs far as I know, there's no such word...but, hey, that's what it says.  Kirk, McCoy, and Saavik later encounter the same door a few times during their search of the Regula station. \n"}, {"text": "David Marcus praises his mother by suggesting that, thanks to her work on the Genesis Project, her name will one day be spoken in the same breath as those of several other revolutionary scientists.  Whom does he *not* name in this list of famous scientists?", "correct": "Zephram Cochrane", "options": ["Albert Einstein", "Isaac Newton", "Surak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZephram Cochrane.\n\n\tDavid invokes Newton (who revolutionized physics), Einstein (who, among other achievements, gave us E = Mc^2), and Surak (a Vulcan scientist and philosopher).  He never mentions Cochrane, the man who invented warp drive in the mid-21st century. \n"}, {"text": "David, almost absent-mindedly, asks his mother if she will be joining him later that night to play a certain card game with him and some other residents of Space Station Regula 1.  What is the game in question?", "correct": "bridge", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nbridge.\n\n\tDavid: \"Teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?\" \n"}, {"text": "When Chekov and his captain discover living quarters on what they thought was a lifeless planet, Chekov notices a collection of books on a makeshift shelf.  Which book is *not* among them?", "correct": "\"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" by Alexander Dumas", "options": ["\"King Lear,\" by William Shakespeare", "\"Moby Dick,\" by Herman Melville", "\"Paradise Lost,\" by John Milton"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" by Alexander Dumas.\n\n\t\"The Count of Monte Cristo\" would definitely fit into Khan's obsession with revenge, but it is not one of the books seen on his shelf.  Khan quotes from \"Moby Dick\" liberally throughout the film. \n"}, {"text": "Finish this quote from Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban): \"You are in a position to demand nothing.  I, on the other hand, am in a position to _________ nothing.\"", "correct": "grant", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ngrant.\n\n\tKhan underscores the point that he and his people have only barely survived their years in exile on the desolate Ceti Alpha V. \n"}, {"text": "How long have Khan and his followers been marooned on Ceti Alpha V?", "correct": "15 years", "options": ["16 years", "17 years", "18 years"], "explanation": "\n\n\n15 years.\n\n\tSurprisingly, this number actually fits the real-world facts.  \"Space Seed,\" the original TV series episode in which Kirk exiled Khan and his followers to Ceti Alpha V, premiered in February 1967.  \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" premiered in June 1982.  That's fifteen years and four months. \n"}, {"text": "At one point, Chekov's captain makes a vain attempt to appeal to Khan's followers.  Khan shuts him down immediately and states that said followers had sworn subservience to him many years before the captain was even born.  HOW many years, according to Khan's dialogue?", "correct": "200", "options": ["350", "300", "250"], "explanation": "\n\n\n200.\n\n\tKhan: \"These people were sworn to live and die by my command 200 years before you were born.\"  It's a nice line, but it's problematic in terms of Trek history -- Khan and company are products of the 1990's, and \"Space Seed\" takes place in the late 2200's...as does this movie.  That's THREE hundred years, not two.  Oh, well.  Somebody call for continuity! \n"}, {"text": "How many people, according to Khan, did Kirk launch into exile in the 1960's TV episode \"Space Seed\"?", "correct": "70", "options": ["60", "80", "90"], "explanation": "\n\n\n70.\n\n\tKhan also notes that 20 people were killed by the \"Ceti Eels,\" so that leaves only 50 to take over the RELIANT.  A question, though -- after 15 years, didn't anyone on Ceti Alpha V ever think that reproduction might be a good idea?  There are no children among Khan's crew, so apparently, the answer is \"No\"... \n"}, {"text": "Khan eventually deduces that Chekov and his captain are there because they thought that they were visiting Ceti Alpha VI.  Khan quickly informs them that Ceti Alpha VI exploded, and the orbit of Ceti Alpha V shifted sufficiently to the point that the RELIANT mistook the planet of Khan's exile for Ceti Alpha VI.  How long after the events of \"Space Seed\" did Ceti Alpha VI explode?", "correct": "six months", "options": ["one year", "six weeks", "eighteen months"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsix months.\n\n\tAccording to Khan's dialogue, Ceti Alpha VI exploded a mere six months after Kirk dumped Khan and company onto Ceti Alpha V.  Part of Khan's fury toward Kirk lies in the fact that Kirk never came back to check up on Khan and his people, even though he expressed a desire to do so at the end of \"Space Seed.\"\r The quiz is just getting started!
