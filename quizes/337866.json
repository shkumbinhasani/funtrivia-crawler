Its use in dogfighting may have been unequaled, as at one time it boasted a kill ratio of 12:1. By 1942 American and European aircraft engineers caught up and surpassed the design of the Zero. By 1944 kamikaze tactics began in earnest as the Japanese lost their hold on the skies of battle. \n"}, {"text": "The Akutan Zero was the first of its kind recovered intact by the Allied forces.

Early on, due the weight restrictions, pilots were limited as to the weapons that could be carried on the early airplanes. At first pilots were known to throw bricks and grenades or attempt to drop a rope into another pilot's propeller, all of which could cause the opponent to crash. The area of aviation weaponry was born at this time and has advanced rapidly ever since. \n"}, {"text": "What is the common translation for the word \"Kamikaze\"?", "correct": "Divine Wind", "options": ["Lightning Cloud", "Ghost Storm", "Silent Typhoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDivine Wind.\n\n\tThe word \"Kamikaze\" is usually translated as \"divine wind\".

The repercussions of this type of warfare have been more complex and long-lasting than was thought at the time. \n"}]}
