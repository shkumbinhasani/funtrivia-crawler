Average [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "Ralph rolled out of the paddock early one morning and thought he'd start his day out just right.  Turning on the radio and picking up his phone, he thought perhaps he'd send in a request to his local FM station.  Although he recommended \"I Herd It Through the Grapevine\", insisting on a song about llamas which may not actually exist, they ended up playing the obvious similar song by which artist (released in 1968)?", "correct": "Marvin Gaye", "options": ["Justin Bieber", "Elvis Presley", "Chuck Berry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarvin Gaye.\n\n\t\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" was a Motown classic for Marvin Gaye upon its release in the late 1960s; there was never a song about a herd of llamas living in a vineyard somewhere.  Sigh...it truly is a world of humans.\r Gaye's song has consistently appeared on \"Rolling Stone's\" greatest songs lists and it ended up topping the Billboard Hot 100 upon its release.  It's been covered repeatedly by famous Motown artists including Smokey Robinson and Gladys Knight (and The Pips).  Gaye would continue performing hits until his death in 1984.\r There's nothing like the wrong song to set your day on a rough edge; Ralph certainly deserves less drama in his life, but it's probably only the start of worse things to come.  He should've listened to Kyleisalive and had a meditation before heading out. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph pulled into the lot beside his favorite restaurant and wandered around looking for a place to park. Only the two spaces closest to the door were available. They seemed to be the best in the lot, and Ralph couldn't see any other open spaces, so he pulled in and parked. What Ralph didn't see was the International Symbol of Access (Wheelchair Symbol), marking the space as reserved for the handicapped/disabled. Who designed the International Symbol of Access, used around the world?", "correct": "Susanne Koefoed", "options": ["Gerald Holtom", "William Phelps Eno", "Charles Baldwin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSusanne Koefoed.\n\n\tAs Ralph walked toward the front door of the restaurant, he was stopped by kaddarsgirl. She explained that the parking space Ralph had pulled into was protected and that he would have to move his car if he wanted to avoid paying a fine and having his car towed.\r In the United States, the rights of disabled persons, covering everything from parking spaces to counter heights, are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. Many countries around the world also have similar laws and programs to protect the rights of disabled persons. In the US, there are minimum requirements for the number of ADA accessible parking spaces required for different types of businesses and sizes of parking lots. In all cases, the ADA spaces must be the closest and provide the easiest access to the front door of an establishment.\r At Ralph's favorite restaurant there are thirty total parking spaces, two of which are required to be accessible. As Ralph spoke to kaddarsgirl, a non-ADA space opened up, and he was able to move his car and avoid being towed and fined.\r The International Symbol of Access (Wheelchair Symbol) was designed by Susanne Koefoed in 1968 and has been in use ever since. William Phelps Eno, Gerald Holtom, and Charles Baldwin are also designers of international symbols. William Phelps Eno designed the octagonal stop sign, first installed in 1915 in Michigan. In 1958, Gerald Holtom designed the International Peace Sign, a circle with three lines through it. Charles Baldwin designed the International Biohazard Symbol in 1966. \n"}, {"text": "Feeling a bit thirsty, Ralph decided to treat himself to a wheatgrass drink,  but found himself a bit short of cash--how embarrassing!  Crossing the street to the nearest bank, he discovered it was closed and he would have to use a money-dispensing machine outside the bank rather than being able to make his request to a teller.  Unfortunately, llama feet are not designed for pressing small buttons, so he decided to enlist the assistance of a passer-by.  What is a common name for the machine which Ralph was trying to manipulate?", "correct": "ATM", "options": ["RIP", "IBM", "PIN"], "explanation": "\n\n\nATM.\n\n\tAn automated teller machine, or ATM, is the common name for these in the USA and Australia.  Canadians are more likely to refer to one as an ABM (automated banking machine); in the United Kingdom, the most common term is a cash machine.  Another widespread way of referring to one of them is as a hole in the wall (even when they are freestanding machines, go figure).\r It's really not a good idea for Ralph to get someone to help him use the ATM.  One of these machines is usually operated by inserting a plastic card with a magnetised strip, then keying in one's PIN (personal identification number).  Letting anyone else know your PIN is leaving yourself open to identity theft.  What a dilemma for poor Ralph - should he risk losing his savings, or remain thirsty?  Looney_tunes will leave the decision in his hands, er, feet. \n"}, {"text": "Noticing that most humans go into small cubicles to follow the call of nature, Ralph decided to do likewise but immediately met with a problem. He lacked thumbs and fingers with which to turn the doorknob. The use of doorknobs has been recorded as far back as the 18th century, but it wasn't until 1878 that an American man was issued the patent for them. Who was he?", "correct": "Osbourn Dorsey", "options": ["Paul Revere", "Isaac Newton", "George Washington"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOsbourn Dorsey.\n\n\tAnd there's no other information on Mr Dorsey than that. Unknown, unsung, probably uninteresting, he had the business savvy to corner the doorknob market. Are door knobs interesting? Not even remotely, but two facts about them are. In Europe, people tend to prefer the use of a door handle, but in America the preference by far is for doorknobs. What psychological significance can be made of this startling fact asks Creedy, rifling through her book on \"Aberrations of the Urban Llama\". Nothing, in fact. \r Secondly, and this is far more interesting, doorknobs manufactured from brass, copper or silver have the ability to destroy germs. The use of knobs manufactured from these alloys or elements aid in the control of infections which can be easily picked up from unclean doorknobs. Ralph, in the meantime, kicked down the door of the cubicle in his haste to reach his destination. \n"}, {"text": "Being the fashion guru that he is, Ralph offered his services to his friend who was preparing for a weekend getaway to somewhere chilly. \"I'll pack a jumper,\" said the friend. Unfortunately, Ralph's hearing wasn't what it used to be, and he panicked at the thought that his friend might be wearing an alpaca jumper. After he was placated, Ralph realised the jumper in question wasn't made of an alpaca, but from the hair of a particular type of rabbit. Which of these silky wools is the jumper made of?", "correct": "Angora", "options": ["Cashmere", "Mohair", "Qiviut"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAngora.\n\n\tAngora wool, of course, comes from the Angora rabbit, a species of rabbit originating in Turkey (Angora is the historical name of Ankara, the country's capital city). The long hair of these rabbits is prized for its silky softness, and is frequently used to create items of clothing like the aforementioned jumper. Cashmere wool comes from the hair of the Cashmere goat. Much like Angora wool, cashmere is a popular fibre used in the production of clothing. Mohair is obtained from the Angora goat, whilst qiviut is the wool of the muskox.\r This wasn't the first time Ralph had offered some sartorial advice. Ralph once suggested that eburge take a lovely cashmere jumper on holiday, but he disagreed. The one cashmere jumper he owned had a red dot on it, and he felt sure that someone would definitely notice it and make a 'Seinfeld' reference. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph met up with his brother Ricardo, and they decided that they needed some liquid refreshment and went looking for their friend Barbet the barista. After ordering a doppio from Barbet, Ralph amazed surprised onlookers with his skill and intelligence by using his double-toed feet to drink which of the following potables? ", "correct": "Coffee", "options": ["Wine", "Brandy", "Tea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoffee.\n\n\tRalph was enjoying a type of espresso (recommended by Dcpddc478), which is a concentrated coffee often associated with the country of Italy. A doppio is a double shot of espresso and contains about 150 mg of caffeine. A barista is a coffee house worker who serves the many types of espresso drinks. A llama has two toes on each foot, which could conceivably be used to hold the handle found on most coffee cups.A barbet is a type of French water dog that bears a resemblance to a poodle with longer curly hair. After finishing their afternoon pick-me-up, Ralph and and his brother parted ways and Ralph decided it was time for his next adventure. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph had heard great things about something called \"video games\" and decided to give them a whirl.  He hadn't realized how difficult a video game could be for an animal with feet instead of hands.  Holding the controller was hard enough, but to use the triggers to shoot down Covenant forces and switching weapons with the Y button, all while trying to dodge sticky grenades, was just too much for Ralph to handle (or \"footle\", since he has feet, not hands).\n\nWhich video game was he attempting to play, anyway?", "correct": "Halo", "options": ["Call of Duty", "Left 4 Dead", "Battlefield"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalo.\n\n\tFirst released for the Xbox in 2001, \"Halo: Combat Evolved\" followed Master Chief as he fought against the Covenant (an alien alliance).  The game became very successful with many sequels and eventually became a multi-billion dollar series (breaking many sales record along the way).  \"Halo 4\", released in 2012, began a new \"Halo\" series called the \"Reclaimer\" series.  Interestingly, even soundtracks for the games meet quite a bit of success; several of the games made it to the Billboard Hot 200 for at least a week.\r It turns out that Ralph has no luck with electronics and liquids.  As he fumbled with the Xbox controller, he dropped it.  It hit his glass of wheatgrass juice, which promptly spilled onto the controller, thus ruining it.  Salami_swami was livid; it was his controller. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph's hearing is still not all it might be and so, in a quest for religious enlightenment, he heads down to his local deli to meet the deli llama. He realises his mistake when his request 'to be made one with everything' only results in a very large check. You need, of course, to redirect him to the Dalai Lama but, in its original usage, what does the word 'dalai' mean?", "correct": "It's Mongolian for 'ocean'", "options": ["It's Japanese for 'great lake'", "It's Maori for 'water without boundaries'", "It's Texan for 'that's only a puddle'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's Mongolian for 'ocean'.\n\n\tEver wonder how the punchline 'make me one with everything' would go down with the Dalai Llama himself? Australian TV presenter Karl Stefanovic tried it and the videos are out there to prove it. It fell flatter than a slice of pastrami. \r There seems no clear explanation why a Mongolian word for the sea should come to be used as a title for the most revered exponent of Tibetan Buddhism. Glendathecat finds it particularly ironic given that Mongolia is the world's second largest landlocked country. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph the Llama used cash to buy his lunch at the deli, but he watched in amazement as another customer waved a plastic card to pay for his meal. What type of technology did Ralph just witness?", "correct": "RFID", "options": ["HTML", "RAM", "HTTP"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRFID.\n\n\tRadio frequency identification (RFID) is a wireless system that allows data contained on a tag to be transferred to a reader.  Its origins date back to combat operations in World War II, but today RFID technology is used for a wide range of functions, from tracking livestock to preventing car theft.  Consumers use it most frequently in smart cards which can be used to pay for transactions. Ralph would find these very handy since he wouldn't have to carry cash.\r Even the technology-leery PDAZ uses smart cards. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph the llama wanted to call home but his phone leaped from between his toes and dropped into the toilet with a gentle gurgle. Oops. Ralph fished the phone out of the toilet and turned it off. He seemed to remember someone telling they'd used a dry foodstuff to absorb moisture from their phone so, even though he'd rather eat it with curry, he got out a packet and tried to open it. What grain did Ralph need to dry his phone?", "correct": "Rice", "options": ["Mustard", "Mayonnaise", "Mushrooms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRice.\n\n\tPoor Ralph. His fumbling feet threw the phone into a flushable fate - okay, he dropped it into the toilet bowl - but then he had to fish it out and try to fix it. The first thing he had to do was turn it off, and if he'd dropped it into anything acidic, give it a quick rinse as, although water is bad for electronics, acid is worse. Then he should mop the worst of the water with an anti-static cloth (or failing that, some paper towel) then take the phone apart. Ralph then needs to mop up any water he can see (extra careful with the SIM and memory cards) and then put all the pieces into a plastic lunch box, or a shallow bowl, or even a plastic bag. Then he should cover the phone in dry rice. Not canned rice, d'oh! Long grain will do fine, Ralph, just add about a pound of it until the phone pieces are all covered on every side. White rice is best because it has had the husk removed but if you only have brown rice, try that. And then put the uncovered box/bowl/bag into the airing cupboard, drying cupboard or other warm place for three whole days. Don't check it, don't stir it, just leave it alone. Ralph, I said leave it alone or I'll fetch my pointy stick! After three days, Ralph put his phone back together and it worked. He was lucky, although his phone might not last as long as it might otherwise have done. He's still grateful that he didn't drop it in the sea, salt water is really bad for electronics.\r Flopsymopsy told Ralph what to do when she told the Llamas about the time she dropped her phone in the toilet. Oh how the llamas laughed! Including Ralph, who has ordered in a stack of easy-open rice just in case he needs to get his feet on some in a hurry. \n"}]}
