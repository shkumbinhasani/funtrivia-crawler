{"id": "142649", "name": "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"], "questions": [{"text": "Which is the best general description of the show?", "correct": "It's a makeover show.", "options": ["It's a gross-out show similar to \"Fear Factor.\"", "It's a reality show similar to \"Joe Millionaire.\"", "It's about the gay lifestyle."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's a makeover show.\n\n\tFive gay men give one straight guy a makeover that includes a new wardrobe, a new hairstyle, new home decor, new cooking skills, and new social skills. \n"}, {"text": "How many gay men are on the show?", "correct": "five", "options": ["three", "four", "two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfive.\n\n\tThey are Kyan Douglas, Ted Allen, Carson Kressley, Jai Rodriguez, and Thom Filicia. Another guy named Blair Something took Mr. Rodriguez's role in some episodes, but I don't know his surname. \n"}, {"text": "What does NOT happen on the show?", "correct": "People win huge cash prizes.", "options": ["People cook gourmet meals.", "People go to hair salons.", "Men create lovely surprises for women."], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeople win huge cash prizes.\n\n\tThis isn't a game show--the only \"prizes\" are elements of the straight guy's spiffy new style. \n"}, {"text": "Which is NOT true of this show?", "correct": "It is anti-heterosexual.", "options": ["It puts down out-dated clothing styles.", "It makes fun of messy, dirty homes.", "It is contemptuous of long, greasy hair."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is anti-heterosexual.\n\n\tOn the contrary, the gay guys often spruce up a straight man expressly in order to please his wife or girlfriend. The fab five seem genuinely touched when their handiwork makes a woman feel proud and happy with her re-vamped mate. \n"}, {"text": "Which best describes the interior design aspect of the show?", "correct": "Thom brings out the best in what's already there, and adds new touches.", "options": ["Thom just walks around scoffing at the disorder. Then he hires maids.", "Thom throws out all of the old furnishings and starts from scratch.", "Thom never buys anything new--he just cleans up the existing stuff."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThom brings out the best in what's already there, and adds new touches.\n\n\tThis is an aspect of the show that I truly love: instead of trying to change the straight guy's living space into a completely unfamiliar setting, interior designer Thom Filicia has a knack for choosing his \"client's\" most treasured knickknacks and furnishings and making them look more stylish. He almost always paints walls, and generally spruces things up. Sometimes he buys a few needed pieces of furniture. \n"}, {"text": "Which best describes the culinary aspect of the show?", "correct": "Ted helps the straight guy cook or assemble simple gourmet dishes.", "options": ["Ted stands around making fun of the rotting items in the straight guy's fridge.", "Ted does all of the cooking, and the straight guy just serves meals.", "Ted sends the straight guy to French cooking classes."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTed helps the straight guy cook or assemble simple gourmet dishes.\n\n\tActually, at the beginning of each episode, Ted usually does do a fair amount of making fun of the weird or spoiled items in the straight guy's usually horrendously messy kitchen. \n"}, {"text": "Which best describes the fashion aspect of the show?", "correct": "Cute Carson picks out more stylish, less messy clothes that fit the SG's personality.", "options": ["Cute Carson throws out all of the SG's old clothes and buys all new designer fashions.", "Cute Carson laughs at the SG's raggedy underwear.", "Cute Carson dresses the SG in clothes that are more suited to gay men."], "explanation": "\n\n\nCute Carson picks out more stylish, less messy clothes that fit the SG's personality.\n\n\tCarson Kressley, the wisecracking fashion expert, is one of the funniest of the fab five. He's also very sweet, in my opinion. \n"}, {"text": "Which is the best description of Kyan Douglas's role on the show?", "correct": "He suggests a new hairstyle and new haircare products, men's fragrances, and so on.", "options": ["He's a  masseur, a hair stylist, and a manicurist.", "The show's hairdresser, he cuts and styles the SG's tresses.", "He never allows long-haired straight guys to keep their hair long because it's \"too 60s!\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe suggests a new hairstyle and new haircare products, men's fragrances, and so on.\n\n\tKyan doesn't do haircutting himself--at least not on any of the episodes I've seen. He seems to prefer short hair, but he lets men keep their long hair if they and their mates want it that way. \n"}, {"text": "Which best describes the social skills aspect of the show?", "correct": "Jai specializes in romantic gestures such as thoughtful gifts and chivalrous manners.", "options": ["Jai is a wedding planner.", "Jai specializes in organizers mixers at which single straight men can find new partners.", "Jai interviews the SGs' women partners to find out exactly what they want changed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nJai specializes in romantic gestures such as thoughtful gifts and chivalrous manners.\n\n\tFor example, on one show, Jai taught a man who planned to propose to his girlfriend how to say \"I love you\" in Armenian, the girlfriend's first language. \n"}, {"text": "How do the fab five gauge how successful they've been?", "correct": "In a screening room, they watch the SG try out his new skills and stylish image.", "options": ["They interview the SG's girlfriend, and she rates her man's new skills and stylish look.", "They count the number of emails they receive from viewers.", "They wait to see whether the SG's girlfriend accepts his marriage proposal."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a screening room, they watch the SG try out his new skills and stylish image.\n\n\tI hope you'll watch this great new show. I think it may do a lot to help gay and straight people understand one another better. \n"}]}
