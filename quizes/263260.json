{"id": "263260", "name": "The \"Right\" Stuff Quiz | MLB Records | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "       MLB Records", " Pitching Records"], "questions": [{"text": "This right-hander won 287 games in his career, but was mostly remembered for setting a season record by giving up 50 home runs in a season.  Who was this Minnesota Twin at the time?", "correct": "Bert Blyleven", "options": ["Frank Viola", "Eric Milton", "Jamie Moyer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBert Blyleven.\n\n\tThe others were all left-handers.  Bert gave up 50 in 1986, but the Twins held on to him.  To show his appreciation, he almost broke his own record by giving up 46 in 1987.  Half his 22 seasons saw him in a Twins uniform.  He retired in 1992. \n"}, {"text": "This Hall of Fame right-hander set a season record for throwing 383 strikeouts in a season in 1973.  He also led the league 11 times in strikeouts.  Who is he?", "correct": "Nolan Ryan", "options": ["Warren Spahn", "Sandy Koufax", "Randy Johnson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNolan Ryan.\n\n\tThe others were all left-handers.  Strangely enough, Nolan took seven strikeout crowns in eight seasons with the Angels, then signed with the Houston Astros in 1980.  He then went dry for the strikeout title for seven seasons in Houston before winning it in 1987 and 1988.  He then won two more in 1989 and 1990 as a Ranger. \n"}, {"text": "This was a great right-hander in baseball history, but he lost 316 career games.  Who is this Hall of Fame pitcher?", "correct": "Cy Young", "options": ["Gaylord Perry", "Phil Niekro", "Christy Mathewson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCy Young.\n\n\tThe others are all Hall of Famers also, but it was Young's 316 losses that came against 511 career wins, and both stats are likely never to be surpassed in baseball history.  Phil Niekro went 318-274, Perry went 314-265, and Christy \"Big Six\" Mathewson went 373-188 in his career.  Other records of Young that are not likely to be topped are innings pitched with 7355, games started with 815, complete games with 749, hits allowed with 7092, and batters faced with 30,058.  It is no wonder why the greatest pitching award was named the \"Cy Young Award\". \n"}, {"text": "I was the last pitcher of either arm to win 30 season games in the 20th century.  My right-arm won the Cy Young and AL MVP for this in 1968.  With one more great season ahead of me, my career then went downhill with racketeering charges after that.  Who am I?", "correct": "Denny McLain", "options": ["Dizzy Dean", "Bob Gibson", "Jim 'Catfish' Hunter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDenny McLain.\n\n\tDenny went 31-6 with the World Champion Tigers in 1968, then tied for the Cy Young award in 1969 with his 24-9 record, tying with Mike Cuellar of the Orioles.  With some tremendous gambling issues hanging over his head, the Tigers saw him go 3-5 in 1970, then traded him to the Senators immediately after the season.  With Washington in 1971, McLain went 10-22, then his career was over in 1972. \n"}, {"text": "In 1908, this right-hander won 40 games for the White Sox in the season, but their season was still only good enough for a third place American League finish.  Who was this 1946 Hall of Fame inductee?", "correct": "Ed Walsh", "options": ["Randy Johnson", "Johan Santana", "Eric Milton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEd Walsh.\n\n\tThe others were all left-handers, and weren't born yet for another 50+ years.  Walsh had a career high 40-15 record along with his 269 strikeouts in 1908.  Ed played 13 of his 14 season in Chicago, then retired as a Boston Brave in 1917. \n"}, {"text": "This pitcher was the first of any arm to win a league MVP award, and was also the first pitcher to win two MVPs in the American League from its inception in 1911, until Lefty Grove won it in 1931.  Who was this right-handed pitcher?", "correct": "Walter Johnson", "options": ["Mickey Cochrane", "John Roseboro", "Thurman Munson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalter Johnson.\n\n\tThe others were all catchers.  Johnson's first MVP came in 1913 when he went 36-7.  The career Washington Senator retired with a career record 110 shutouts.  He also won an amazing three pitching Triple Crowns in 1913, 1918, and 1924.  He was one of the first five inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 1936.  Lefty Grove won the AL MVP and the Triple Crown in part for his 31-4 record for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1931. \n"}, {"text": "I am a right-handed pitcher.  I have the distinction of throwing the first no-hitter in American League history in 1902.  I won only 99 games in my career.  Who am I?", "correct": "Nixey Callahan", "options": ["Pete Alexander", "Christy Mathewson", "Cy Young"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNixey Callahan.\n\n\tThe others listed all won over 300 games in their career.  James Joseph 'Nixey' Callahan played from 1894-1913, but what is strange is that he stopped pitching in 1903, and played out the rest of his career as an outfielder.  His no-no came against the Tigers on September 20, 1902, in a 3-0 shutout.  Cy Young threw the league's second no-hitter in 1904, and retired with 511 wins. \n"}, {"text": "Extremely few pitchers become managers later in their career.  One was this right-hander who pitched from 1955-1966.  In his mound days, his seasons included going 10-24 and 5-22 in consecutive seasons with the Mets.  He later managed the Padres for two seasons, then the Giants for eight.  Who was this who left baseball for good in 1992?", "correct": "Roger Craig", "options": ["Wilbert Robinson", "Jim Fregosi", "Charlie Comiskey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoger Craig.\n\n\tCraig never won more than 12 games in a season.  He played most of his career for the Dodgers.  The only category that Roger led the league in was his 20+ losses in 1962 and 1963.  In 1962, Mets teammate Al Jackson also went 8-20 to ease the pain for Craig.  Roger's only managerial highlight was taking the Giants to the World Series in 1989, the 'Earthquake Series' against Oakland, but were skunked four games to none. \n"}, {"text": "Wow! Was 1986 one of many dream seasons of every kid growing up or what?  It was for me! I appeared in my first all-star game in 1986, I threw my only career no-hitter, and to make it special, that no-hitter clinched the NL West for my Astros against the Giants.  I also won the NL Cy Young award for the season, then went on to win the NLCS MVP award, even though we lost to the Mets.  I was also the Cy Young runner-up in 1989 with my 20-10 record, if 1986 wasn't great enough for me already.  Who am I?", "correct": "Mike Scott", "options": ["Milt Pappas", "Hoyt Wilhelm", "Sal Maglie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike Scott.\n\n\tThe others retired more than 10 years earlier to Scott's great 1986 season.  Even though the Astros lost to the Mets in the NLCS four games to two, Mike Scott won both games.  His runner-up Cy Young award in 1989 was to Mark Davis of the Padres.  Scott's first four seasons were with the Mets, then nine with the Astros.  He retired in 1991. \n"}, {"text": "In my third season of baseball as a Detroit Tiger in 2007, I threw a no-hitter on June 12, 2007.  It was only the third no-hitter in the history of interleague play.  This was after my 2006 season, when I went 17-9 and finished seventh in the Cy Young voting.  Who am I?", "correct": "Justin Verlander", "options": ["Hideo Nomo", "Bret Saberhagen", "Dave Righetti"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJustin Verlander.\n\n\tThe others all threw no-hitters, but were all retired when Verlander entered the record books with his no-no in 2007.  Justin's no-hitter came against the Milwaukee Brewers in a 4-0 win.  Verlander kept up his pace, winning nine of his first 11 decisions. \n"}]}
