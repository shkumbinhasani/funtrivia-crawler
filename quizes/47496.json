Canute, famous for trying to hold back the tide, could not hold back death either, and his bones rest in a mortuary chest in what cathedral?", "correct": "Winchester Cathedral, Winchester, England", "options": ["Christchurch Cathedral, Canterbury, England", "Vor Frue Kirke, Copenhagen, Denmark", "York Minster, York, England"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinchester Cathedral, Winchester, England.\n\n\tThe story goes that King Canute's advisers, hoping to impress their lord with their loyalty to him, told him that as king his power was absolute and that, truly, nothing was impossible for him. He then took his court to a beachhead where he sat for hours and commanded the tide not to come in. The tide, of course, came in. Canute had shown his advisers that he did not want their flattery. Jane Austen is also buried in Winchester Cathedral. \n"}, {"text": "Genghis Khan, conqueror of most of Asia and founder of the Mongol dynasty, is buried where?", "correct": "Unknown", "options": ["Gur-i Amir, Samarkand, Uzbekistan", "Great Mosque, Isfahan, Iran", "Great Yasa, Ulan Bator, Mongolia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnknown.\n\n\tThe legend is that, one day while riding with his armies in the steppes of Mongolia, Genghis declared that this land was so beautiful that he wanted to be buried at that spot.
