{"id": "168080", "name": "The Film History of Nicolas Cage Multiple Choice Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed A-D", " Nicolas Cage"], "questions": [{"text": "His first role in a full-length Hollywood film was a minor one in 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.  Under what name was he credited in this film?", "correct": "Nicolas Coppola", "options": ["Nicolas Cage", "Nicolas Scorcese", "He was uncredited"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNicolas Coppola.\n\n\tAs most of you Nicolas Cage fans are probably already aware, Nicolas is the nephew of famed Hollywood director Francis Ford Coppola.  Nicolas decided after 'Fast Times' that he wanted to make it on his own reputation, without the Coppola name propping him up (or dragging him down!). \n"}, {"text": "Nicolas scored his first starring role in the 1983 film 'Valley Girl'.  What was his character's name in this quirky period piece?", "correct": "Randy", "options": ["Ted", "Phil", "Brad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRandy.\n\n\t'Valley Girl' is an example of a film riding the crest of a popular social trend.  It was directed by Martha Coolidge, who went on to direct one of my personal favorites of the 1980s, the entirely different 'Real Genius'.  For the record, Nicolas Cage did not play a 'valley boy' in the film! \n"}, {"text": "In which of these 1984 films did the now hot Hollywood commodity Nicolas Cage not appear?", "correct": "The Natural", "options": ["The Cotton Club", "Birdy", "Racing with the Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Natural.\n\n\tAfter scoring it big in 1983 with 'Valley Girl' and 'Rumble Fish', Nicolas Cage was now a wanted man in Hollywood.  He made the interesting and quaint 'Birdy' in 1984, co-starring with Matthew Modine.  He also landed rolls in 'The Cotton Club' and 'Racing with the Moon'.  None of these films were monster hits, but his collective work had landed Cage on the Hollywood map. \n"}, {"text": "Nicolas Cage received some acting accolades after co-starring with which 1980s Hollywood leading lady in the film 'Peggy Sue Got Married'?", "correct": "Kathleen Turner", "options": ["Anjelica Huston", "Jessica Lange", "Glenn Close"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKathleen Turner.\n\n\tThe 1986 film 'Peggie Sue Got Married' was probably the film that established Nicolas Cage as a leading man.  It also included an appearance by another future star of the 1990s, Jim Carrey.  I guess Cage decided that he didn't mind riding the coat-tails of his famous uncle, who directed this film.  His cousin Sofia, now a director in her own right, also made a cameo appearance. \n"}, {"text": "Nicolas Cage's most hilarious role, in this quizmaker's humble opinion, was in the 1987 film 'Raising Arizona'.  Who directed this film that starred Cage as a confused suburban Arizonan plagued with the problem of recidivism?", "correct": "The Coen Brothers", "options": ["John Hughes", "Sydney Pollack", "John Waters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Coen Brothers.\n\n\tNicolas Cage played H.I. McDonnough, a former convict who attempts to 'go straight' after marrying Edwina, a prison guard and police officer, portrayed by Holly Hunter.  Among his great lines in this film, perhaps my favorite is: 'And make it quick, I'm in dutch with the wife.' (What's your favorite?) \n"}, {"text": "In the 1987 film 'Moonstruck', Cage co-stars with Cher, among several other interesting actors.  The Cage character is missing one of a paired body part in this film, but which?", "correct": "Hand", "options": ["Ear", "Foot", "Buttock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHand.\n\n\tCan you imagine missing a buttock?  Neither could I.  Cage plays the one-handed Ronny Cammareri in this 1987 comedy, which also features Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello.  Now that's Italian! \n"}, {"text": "In which of the following David Lynch films did Nicolas Cage appear?", "correct": "Wild at Heart", "options": ["Dune", "Blue Velvet", "Mulholland Dr."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWild at Heart.\n\n\tYes, it's safe to say that David Lynch is a little strange, and so perhaps is Mr. Nicolas Cage, who stars as Sailor opposite Laura Dern's Lula.  Nicolas Cage did his own singing in the film 'Wild at Heart', which I'm not certain was a good thing. \n"}, {"text": "In which Nicolas Cage film does his character join 'The Flying Elvises'?", "correct": "Honeymoon in Vegas", "options": ["Vampire's Kiss", "Fire Birds", "Amos & Andrew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoneymoon in Vegas.\n\n\tRemember this sequence?  'Yellow then red. Yellow then red. Yellow then red. Yellow then red. Yellow then red. Yellow then red. Yellow then red. Yellow then red. Yellow then red.'  Fortunately, his character, Jack Singer, gets his woman in the end. \n"}, {"text": "Nicolas Cage won an Academy Award for his role in the film 'Leaving Las Vegas'.  This was his first Oscar nomination.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, Nicolas Cage won an Oscar on his first attempt for his role  as the alcoholic Ben Sanderson in the 1995 film 'Leaving Las Vegas'.  He was not nominated again for a role in any of his films until the 2002 film 'Adaptation'. \n"}, {"text": "What is Nicolas Cage's character's occupation in the 2003 film 'Matchstick Men'?", "correct": "Con artist", "options": ["Lawyer", "Businessman", "Assassin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCon artist.\n\n\tNicolas plays Roy Waller, a petty con-man who suddenly learns that he has a 15-year old daughter named Angela (or does he?).  He is so intrigued by this newfound revelation, that he attempts to train her in the family business.  It's worth a look-see.
