His name, Theodoric (a corruption of 'Thiudareiks'), means which of the following?  \n", "correct": "Leader of the people", "options": ["Son of God", "Conqueror of the West", "Fruit of the Earth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeader of the people.\n\n\tTheodoric (the Latin spelling of his name) was born just shortly after the death of Attila the Hun (d. 453 AD) in Pannonia, near modern day Vienna.  Theodoric was fortunate enough to be the son of Ostrogothic King Theodemir, who shipped Theodoric to Constantinople at a very young age to serve as a hostage under the Byzantine Emperor Leo. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: Like many other early Germanic kings, Theodoric had the misfortunate of a youth without formal education.  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually Theodoric was quite learned, having spent his time as a hostage in Constantinople under the tutelage of the best scholars Byzantium had to offer.  It was under the care of Leo that Theodoric learned the workings of the Roman imperial system, and most importantly law and politics.  At the age of 17, Theodoric's father died, and he was elected king of the Ostrogoths.  Much like his father, he remained a subject of the Roman Empire, but as time wore on...he became more difficult for the Byzantine emperor to control. \n"}, {"text": "After acquiring kingship over the Ostrogoths at a rather young age, the ambitious Theodoric began planning the rise of his people.  While Theodoric remained a subject of the Roman Empire, and even acquired the status of Consul in 484, the overtly ambitious young man began showing signs of becoming a menace to the Byzantine emperor.  Who was this emperor that had bestowed upon Theodoric the high honor of a Consulship?  \n", "correct": "Zeno", "options": ["Anastasius", "Justin", "Heraclius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZeno.\n\n\tZeno had mixed feelings about Theodoric, at once appreciating Theodoric's martial attitude and loyalty to the empire, but also concerning himself with Theodoric's tremendous ambition vis-\u00e0-vis  the future of his Gothic brethren.  The Ostrogoths were provided land in Macedonia under Theodoric's leadership and Zeno's approval, but the young man had much greater goals in mind! \n"}, {"text": "A solution was found to satisfy the Byzantine emperor's concerns about Theodoric's growing ambition; the Western Roman Empire, under a new 'barbarian' emperor, should be crushed!  Theodoric was given this challenging task, to overthrow the new King of the West, who had in turn ousted the last Western Roman emperor in 476.  Who was this Germanic king that would soon be confronted by Theodoric's army of the East?  \n", "correct": "Odoacer", "options": ["Alaric", "Ataulf", "Fritigern"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOdoacer.\n\n\tZeno's ingenious plan was fully supported by Theodoric, whose grand vision for his people led him to believe that the Ostrogothic destiny lay on the Italian peninsula.  This plan came, unfortunately, at the expense of Rome's first 'barbarian' ruler, Odoacer (Odovacar), who had removed the Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus from power in 476.  Odoacer, a former general in the Roman army, proved no match for the industrious and well-equipped Theodoric. \n"}, {"text": "The wars between the Ostrogoths and the Western Roman armies lasted from 489 until the final victory, a siege of what great Italian fortress in 493?  \n", "correct": "Ravenna", "options": ["Padua", "Milan", "Turin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRavenna.\n\n\tAfter several crushing victories over Odoacer, Theodoric was able to finally besiege and take the great fortress and now capital city of Ravenna in 493.  At first it appeared that Theodoric would share power with Odoacer, the latter was invited to a banquet at which the power-sharing plan would be presented. In reality, Theodoric had something else in mind at this banquet...to send a message to any remaining supporters of Odoacer.  Theodoric personally murdered Odoacer, making his conquest of the Western Roman Empire official.  Theodoric's Ostrogothic capital would be set up at Ravenna, and he would remain nominally subservient to Byzantium. \n"}, {"text": "Theodoric's long reign over the Italian peninsula began in 493.  Near the beginning of his reign, a redistribution of Roman lands occurred, nearly a third of the former estates of the Roman patricians being handed over to the Ostrogoths for settlement.  True or false: Theodoric also completely overturned the Roman system of law, establishing a new system of jurisprudence based on the traditional German pattern.  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis is only partially true.  In reality, Theodoric had great respect for Roman law, and did not want to upset the status quo too greatly, so he allowed that system to continue to govern the Roman people.  For his own people, however, the Gothic law system was maintained.  Under this dual system, and with the redistribution of lands, the Ostrogoths and the Romans were able to co-exist, albeit delicately. \n"}, {"text": "Ostensibly, Theodoric maintained a level of good relations with Byzantium during the early years of his reign.  However, his ambition once again provoked him to a certain level of rebellion, and the dream of a pan-Gothic empire that would encompass much of the former Western Roman Empire sprouted in his head.  Through a series of military expeditions, and via several strategic marriages, Theodoric's plan began to develop.  One of the 'strategic marriages' involved Theodoric and the sister of which great Frankish emperor?  \n", "correct": "Clovis", "options": ["Lothar", "Pepin", "Carloman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClovis.\n\n\tTheodoric challenged the Byzantine authority over his kingdom after nearly a decade in power.  Aside from his marriage to Clovis' sister, he married his daughter off to the Burgundian king, and adopted the young Visigothic king of Spain, acquiring the position of regent to the young chap.  Theodoric also began to assert himself militarily in an attempt to enclose both the Burgundians and the Franks. While attaining a level of success in these ventures, Theodoric also managed to not only overextend his power, but also to upset and alienate Byzantium (and Clovis!)  Ultimately, this would lead to Justinian's conquering of the Ostrogoths about a decade after Theodoric's death. \n"}, {"text": "Theodoric's very beneficent program of civic reconstruction on the Italian peninsula was largely put into effect by his chief secretary.  Name this intellectual and able administrator whose chief work was the official 'History of the Goths'?  \n", "correct": "Cassiodorus", "options": ["Ambrose", "Diophantus", "Augustine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCassiodorus.\n\n\tCassiodorus, a product of traditional Roman society, advised Theodoric on how to win the loyalty of the Roman population.  Cassiodorus' program, entitled 'civilitas', was meant to identify the Ostrogoths with refined civilization.  This program included the building and repair of public works, strict enforcement of laws meant to keep the public peace, and economic measures meant to buoy the financial situation of the empire. \n"}, {"text": "Late in Theodoric's reign, despite his diligence as an emperor, some unrest did occur within the kingdom.  This unrest arose amongst both the traditional Roman aristocracy, many of whom were offended by Gothic rule, and amongst practitioners of Catholicism, who viewed the Arian beliefs of Theodoric and his countrymen as heretical.  This resulted in a mild rebellion which was put down violently by Theodoric.  Which great scholar of the Roman world was executed during this crackdown?  \n", "correct": "Boethius", "options": ["Plotinus", "Jerome", "Origen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoethius.\n\n\tAs a member of the Arian sect of the Christian church, Theodoric's beliefs came into conflict with the mainstream Catholics.  For most of his reign, religious tolerance was the policy, with Arians, Catholics and Jews able to live in relative harmony.  Later in his reign, however, resentment over this open policy (Catholics and Arians were always at odds...) resulted in some persecutions.  The Catholic Pope decided to throw his support behind the Byzantine emperor in defiance of Theodoric, and many Roman aristocrats, \r including Boethius, followed suit.  Theodoric had Boethius (author of 'On the Consolation of Philosophy', a neo-Platonic work) put to death for his involvement in the rebellion.  The great scholar and rhetorician Symmachus shared this fate. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: After Theodoric's death, his kingdom was left in the hands of his grandson, with his daughter Amalasuntha ruling as regent.  \n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe greatest Germanic king of the early Middle Ages, Theodoric was unable to find a 'proper' heir as a result of some untimely deaths.  Hence, the crown was handed to a child, Theodoric's grandson Athalaric, following the death of the great king on August 30, 526.  Theodoric's able, but de jure powerless daughter Amalasuntha ruled behind the scenes.  Very shortly, the empire would fall to the Byzantines, under the reign of Justinian, thus ending Ostrogothic dominance on the Italian peninsula.
