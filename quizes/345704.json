{"id": "345704", "name": "Legend of Shakespeare - Sonnet I Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Shakespeare"], "questions": [{"text": "\"From fairest creatures we desire increase.\"\n\nThis is the first line of Shakespeare's first sonnet.  This is a metaphor for what?", "correct": "Agriculture", "options": ["Industry", "Government", "Theater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAgriculture.\n\n\tWhen Shakespeare wrote \"fairest creatures\", he meant anything that is living and is \"most beautiful\".  When he said \"increase\", he was referring to procreation.  The entire line is actually about wanting to increase the harvest.  The metaphor here is explaining that, when breeding, the best are used (same with plants as it is with the animals).  If the best are used, the best offspring are born.  The \"lesser\" plants and animals will create lesser offspring, but Shakespeare is saying that we desire the best.\r To \"modernize\" this line, it could read simply:\r \"From the best creatures we want better.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"That thereby beauty's ____ might never die.\"\n\nThere is a blank spot in the above line.  What belongs in that spot?", "correct": "Rose", "options": ["Blossom", "Face", "Beast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRose.\n\n\tWhen Shakespeare wrote this line, he was implying that, by breeding the best of the best, beauty itself will never die.  He was not talking about a literal rose; it was merely a symbol for ALL things that are beautiful.  According to the next line of the sonnet, everything will eventually die.  But beauty remains, if you breed the best. \n"}, {"text": "\"His tender hair might bear his memory.\"\n\nUh oh, one of those words is not correct.  Which word is incorrect, and what should be put in its place?", "correct": "Hair - Heir", "options": ["Tender - Cinder", "Memory - Family", "Bear - Forget"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHair - Heir.\n\n\t\"His tender heir might bear his memory.\"\r Shakespeare used the word \"tender\" to mean young and delicate.  By \"bearing his memory\", Shakespeare is saying that a child will hold on to the memory of his parents.  Each memory will be passed down through generations.  So, a son, for instance, will bring honor to his family's name. \n"}, {"text": "\"Feed'st thy light's flame with self-__________ fuel.\"\n\nThe word that is missing represents fuel from one's own body.  What word is it that is missing?", "correct": "Substantial", "options": ["Burning", "Sustaining", "Indulging"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSubstantial.\n\n\t\"Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel\".\r Candles and oil lamps were common during Shakespeare's life.  When they burn, they \"feed'st thy light's flame.\"  \"Self-substantial fuel\" means fuel that is produced from oneself.  For instance, this is implying that a candle should fuel itself.  He is hinting that fuel should be renewable. \n"}, {"text": "\"Making a famine where abundance lies.\"\n\nIn Shakespeare's time, there were periods of famine and periods of what opposite?", "correct": "Gluttony", "options": ["Deficiency", "Infamine", "Drought"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGluttony.\n\n\tIn Shakespeare's time, food storage was unknown.  If there was an over-abundance of food, they would eat.  Many would become a bit chubby, because those during this time period would eat when there was food.  Of course, the opposite was also true.  In trying times when not many crops were produced, all would eat less.  Since they did not store the food, they would not be able to use the food from the previous year to sustain them during the difficult famines. \n"}, {"text": "\"Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.\"\n\nWhat does \"thy self thy foe\" mean?", "correct": "Being an enemy of yourself", "options": ["Making your friends your enemies", "Making your enemies your friends", "Being a friend of yourself"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeing an enemy of yourself.\n\n\tIf \"thy self\" is \"thy foe\", that means you are your own enemy.  \"To thy sweet self too cruel\" means refusing to give yourself a future by not procreating.  Basically, what Shakespeare means is that you are being cruel to yourself for dying before you have offspring to continue on your name. \n"}, {"text": "\"Thou that art now the world's fresh ___________.\"\n\nThis phrase is about a youth (most of the sonnet is).  What word belongs here, though?", "correct": "Ornament", "options": ["Youngster", "Oyster", "Blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrnament.\n\n\t\"Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament.\"\r Shakespeare is speaking about the youths of the world.  They are the fresh youths of today, the new leaders of tomorrow. \n"}, {"text": "\"And only herald to this gaudy season.\"\n\nActually, he does not use the word \"season\".  Which of these words DOES he use?", "correct": "Spring", "options": ["Winter", "Autumn", "Summer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpring.\n\n\t\"And only herald to this gaudy spring.\"\r It seems Shakespeare had a thing for using the seasons in his sonnets.  In this case, he uses \"spring\".  When he says \"only herald\", he means the main, or unique, messenger.  In another sonnet, he called the lark the \"herald of the morn\" and the owl a the \"herald of the night\". \n"}, {"text": "\"Pity the world, or else this glutton be.\"\n\nWhy pity the world?", "correct": "The glutton eats his share as well as the world's share", "options": ["Gluttony is bad for your health, so pity those who are gluttonous", "Pity the skinny people, gluttony is best", "This is not a line of a Shakespearean sonnet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe glutton eats his share as well as the world's share.\n\n\tThe reason to pity the world does not come until the next (and final) line of the sonnet.  It is in that line that Shakespeare mentions that the glutton eats his share as well as the share of the world.  Since the glutton is eating the world's share, they don't get their share; and thus, Shakespeare said \"pity\" the world\". \n"}, {"text": "In this entire sonnet, Shakespeare is mainly speaking to a specific type of person.  To whom is the sonnet directed?", "correct": "Youths", "options": ["Gluttons", "Women", "Kings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYouths.\n\n\tShakespeare directed the majority of this sonnet to the youths.  Though he does speak about gluttony quite a lot, he is speaking about these gluttonous ways TO the youths.\r The entire sonnet would not fit in the conclusion text, so please, enjoy Shakespeare's first sonnet in its entirety below.\r \"From fairest creatures we desire increase,\rThat thereby beauty's rose might never die,\rBut as the riper should by time decease,\rHis tender heir might bear his memory:\rBut thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,\rFeed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,\rMaking a famine where abundance lies,\rThy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\rThou that art now the world's fresh ornament,\rAnd only herald to the gaudy spring,\rWithin thine own bud buriest thy content,\rAnd, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding:\rPity the world, or else this glutton be,\rTo eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.\" \n"}]}
