{"id": "89199", "name": "Culinary Tribonds Quiz | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "Food & Drink"], "questions": [{"text": "Rice, Malt, Balsamic:  These are all types of...?", "correct": "Vinegar", "options": ["Olive oil", "Wine", "Cider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVinegar.\n\n\tI think the key here is the word 'balsamic', don't you?  Rice vinegar is produced by the Japanese and the Chinese and is terrific in soups.  Malt vinegar works best when sprinkled on breaded fish, in my opinion.  And balsamic, ah balsamic...that lovely vinegar from Modena, Italy.  What would I do without it?  (Starve, that's what!) \n"}, {"text": "Miso, Tofu, Natto:  Are all made from?", "correct": "Soy beans", "options": ["Peanuts", "Eggs", "Wheat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSoy beans.\n\n\tAll three of these items are made from soy beans.  Natto is a fermented, sticky, Japanese soy bean concoction which has the texture of mucus.  The difference?  It's delicious!  Miso is a Japanese paste, also made from fermented soy beans.  I prefer it as a soup with plenty of tofu...which is redundant when you consider that tofu is also made from, you guessed it, soy beans! \n"}, {"text": "Mornay, B\u00e9chamel, Velout\u00e9:  Are all types of which of these?", "correct": "Sauces", "options": ["Quiches", "Soups", "Casseroles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSauces.\n\n\tA B\u00e9chamel is the ubiquitous white sauce named for Louis de B\u00e9chamel, a seventeenth-century French financier and gentleman.  The key ingredient of a Sauce Mornay is cheese...otherwise it's just a simple B\u00e9chamel.  A Velout\u00e9 is also similar to the classic B\u00e9chamel, but instead of milk a chicken or fish stock is added. \n"}, {"text": "Chicken Piccata, Tapenade, Tartar Sauce:  These recipes taste much better with which key ingredient?", "correct": "Capers", "options": ["Peppers", "Pickles", "Olives"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCapers.\n\n\tI think capers are a must in tartar sauce...it must be slightly tart, I can't stand that sweet stuff.  In a Tapenade capers are a must.  In fact, this popular spread is named for the caper which is called a 'tapeno' in the Proven\u00e7al region of France.  And finally, Chicken Picatta simply wouldn't be Chicken Picatta without the lovely caper.  By the way, did you know that capers are marinated flower buds? \n"}, {"text": "Blue, Goose, Elder:  These are all types of which fruit?", "correct": "Berry", "options": ["Apple", "Plum", "Pear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBerry.\n\n\tBlueberries are well-known for being, well...blue!  Gooseberries come in various colors, most commonly green.  There are two kinds, from what I understand...Whitesmith and Achilles.  Finally...your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of Elderberries!  Don't risk eating Elderberries raw, they can be poisonous.  Try cooking them into a jam or jelly! \n"}, {"text": "Chipotle, Ancho, Cascabel:  All share what characteristic?", "correct": "Dry", "options": ["Sweet", "Pasty", "Flavorless"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDry.\n\n\tThese are all dried peppers.  A Chipotle is nothing more than a dried, smoked Jalape\u00f1o while an Ancho is a dried poblano pepper.  A Cascabel, aka Bolita, is a round little red pepper whose seeds rattle around when it is shaken (hence it's name meaning 'jingle bell').  On the Scoville ratings (testing Capsaicin levels) chart an ancho measures in at between 1,000 and 1,500 units, a cascabel at between 1,500 and 2,500, and a chipotle falls between 2,500 and 5,000.  These levels are nothing compared to the Habanero which measures in at 100,000 to 300,000! \n"}, {"text": "Squab, Pigeon, Quail:  True or false...they are all essentially the same bird species. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tA little trick here, actually the squab and pigeon are related, both from the dove family (columbidae).  Quails are the smallest game birds consumed regularly in the U.S. and are part of the pheasant family (phasianidae). \n"}, {"text": "Kumamoto, European Flat, Olympia:  These are all types of which seafood?", "correct": "Oyster", "options": ["Mussel", "Scallop", "Clam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOyster.\n\n\tThe Olympia oyster is indigenous to the American west coast, while the Kumamoto originated in Japan (where it's now extinct).  The European Flat is considered by some to be the 'original' oyster, whatever that means, and resides on the coasts of Europe and North America.  I love slurping a raw oyster down with a bit of tobasco sauce and lemon...don't you?  No?  Could I tempt you with some oyster stew then, or smoked oysters? \n"}, {"text": "Cassava, Manioc, Tapioca Root:  Which of the following is synonymous with the previous three mentioned here?", "correct": "Yuca", "options": ["Kohlrabi", "Radiccio", "Daikon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYuca.\n\n\tBelieve it or not, all of these are names for the same root-like plant that essentially works as the potato in many Latin American countries.  Tapioca pudding is absolutely essential stuff, so this root gets my thumbs up! \n"}, {"text": "Chutney, Basmati, Samosa:  Are all food related names from which language?", "correct": "Hindi", "options": ["Thai", "Greek", "Arabic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHindi.\n\n\tThese are all foods related to Indian cuisine.  There are a variety of sauces called 'chutneys', usually including fruits, vinegar and sugar.  They are used as condiments.  Basmati is a wonderful type of rice that I think you should try, if you haven't already.  A samosa is a pastry filled with meat or vegetables.  I'm hungry...I think I'll go get something to eat.  Thanks for playing! \n"}]}
