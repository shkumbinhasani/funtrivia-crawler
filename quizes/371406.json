The game features which of these \"Biggest Loser\" trainers?", "correct": "Jillian Michaels", "options": ["Bob Harper", "Anna Kournikova", "Dolvett Quince"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJillian Michaels.\n\n\tThe full title of this 2008 game is actually \"Jillian Michaels' Fitness Ultimatum 2009\". In 2009, a sequel was released, and was, not surprisingly, called \"Jillian Michaels' Fitness Ultimatum 2010\". In the game, the player may choose a number of different workouts that vary in both intensity and duration. Much like \"Wii Fit\", the player can keep track of stats and overall progress as they workout and become fit by using the game. \n"}, {"text": "The Wii's GameTablet was originally released with this game, the main game in a series. Which of these Wii exclusive games is an art-based game that was bundled with the GameTablet?", "correct": "uDraw Studio", "options": ["Mario Paint", "Line Jumper", "iArtist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nuDraw Studio.\n\n\t\"uDraw Studio\" was released in 2010 (North America) and is an art game that allows players to paint and draw various pictures using the GameTablet. Interestingly, the GameTablet was redesigned in black to pair with both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. They are, however, paired with a different game in the \"uDraw\" series, as \"uDraw Studio\" itself is a Wii exclusive. \n"}, {"text": "This Wii exclusive is one of the greatest \"Mario\" games of all time; and that is not just my opinion, but also IGN's, GameSpot's, and Guinness World Record's, among others. The gameplay changed the way we looked at games; quite literally. Walking on the underside of levels certainly added a new perspective to the game. The only thing that was missing was Yoshi, which the sequel promptly fixed. Which very successful game is this?", "correct": "Super Mario Galaxy", "options": ["Mario Party", "Mario Kart", "Super Mario Bros."], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Mario Galaxy.\n\n\t\"Super Mario Galaxy\" was released in 2007, and it met with great reviews. After being given a lot of hype when it was announced in 2006's E3, upon its release, it met every standard. The game was rated highly by about every respected gaming reviewer, hardly ever falling under 95/100. In March 2014, with over twelve million sales, it was the third best-selling non-bundled Wii game of all time, and it had found its way in the top ten on a myriad of greatest Nintendo games lists. Guinness World Records even placed it 29th on a list of the top 50 console games of all time.\r Because it is such a wonderful game with rave reviews, I will not give away too much of the story so you can play it for yourself (which I greatly suggest). I will say that it involves Mario saving Princess Peach from Bowser (audience gasps in shock). \n"}, {"text": "\"Under the Knife\" was released for the Nintendo DS, and \"Second Opinion\" and \"New Blood\" were both released for the Wii. Which of these series contains the afore mentioned games?", "correct": "Trauma Center", "options": ["Surgeon Mama", "Doctor, Doctor", "Scalpel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrauma Center.\n\n\t\"Trauma Center: Under the Knife\" was released in 2005 on the Nintendo DS as the first installment of the medical series. The second game released was a Wii exclusive called \"Trauma Center: Second Opinion\" (2006). It was an enhanced remake of the first game, but it included a few new elements made just for the Wii. \"Trauma Center: New Blood\" takes place ten years after the first two games, in 2028 (it was released in 2007), and was also a Wii exclusive. \n"}, {"text": "This zombie survival beat 'em up game may be more known as an Xbox exclusive series, but in 2009, \"Chop Till You Drop\" was released. The game was a remake of the original game and created as a Wii exclusive. Which of these game series is it?", "correct": "Dead Rising", "options": ["Left 4 Dead", "The Last of Us", "Resident Evil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDead Rising.\n\n\t\"Dead Rising\" hits close to home for me; the game (as well as the \"Chop Till You Drop\" remake) takes place in a fictional town in Colorado - I, of course, live in Colorado. The game follows Frank West as he is attacked by hordes of zombies while simply trying to find out why there is a zombie infection in the first place.The Wii version of the game is very different from the original Xbox 360 version. For instance, in the Wii version, there are zombie poodles and parrots, and you can change the color of the blood. One of the most unfortunate differences, though, is the fact that, because the Wii cannot handle as much as the Xbox 360 can graphically, only 100 zombies can appear on screen at a time - the Xbox 360 could maintain 800 on screen at a time. \n"}, {"text": "Life simulation games have been quite popular throughout the years of video gaming, and this particular series first appeared in 2001 when the first in the series was released for the Nintendo 64.

The simulation game takes place in a rural setting where animals can talk and the characters can plant and collect, among other activities. The game also syncs with the Wii clock so the game can be played in real-time, allowing the time of day and even the seasons to affect gameplay. \n"}, {"text": "There are a countless number of games that contain several different arcade games, updated and modernized.

The game was also well-known for using Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as a major character for the first time since 1943. The game met with good reviews, and the game spawned a sequel which, unfortunately faired much worse. The sequel, \"Epic Mickey: The Power of Two\" faired so poorly, in fact, the game developer Junction Point Studios was shut down after its release. \n"}, {"text": "Rhythm games gained much more popularity with the release of motion consoles such as the Kinect and the Wii, and some have been more popular than others.
