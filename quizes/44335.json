{"id": "44335", "name": "The Plurality of Worlds Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Science Fiction"], "questions": [{"text": "Our story begins on a note of persecution. In 1600, what author of 'On the Infinite Universe and Worlds' was burned at the stake?", "correct": "Giordano Bruno", "options": ["Johann Tetzel", "Emmanuel Swedenborg", "Galileo Galilei"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGiordano Bruno.\n\n\tBruno had, you see, argued that not only were there other inhabited worlds besides Earth -- but also that God didn't necessarily love us best. \n"}, {"text": "What astronomer, famed for his laws of orbital motion, weighed into the plurality debate with 'Somnium' ('Dream') and 'Conversation with Galileo's Sidereal Messenger'?", "correct": "Johannes Kepler", "options": ["Edmund Halley", "Isaac Newton", "Galileo Galilei"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohannes Kepler.\n\n\tKepler's 'Somnium' was a description of what life might be like on the moon - it turns out that the inhabitants thereof are miserable wormlike creatures whose only joy is their view of the Earth. And in his 'Conversation', he makes the argument that humanity is the apple of God's eye, as we are in the center of the planets orbiting the sun -- and that the Galilean moons were created for the inhabitants of Jupiter as a compensation for their inferior position. \n"}, {"text": "When Galileo Galilei was put on trial by the Catholic Church for believing that the earth orbited the sun, Cardinal Boniface Caetani asked what Dominican monk to write Galileo's defense?", "correct": "Tommaso Campanella", "options": ["Thomas Aquinas", "Martin Luther", "Giordano Bruno"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTommaso Campanella.\n\n\tCampanella's 'Apologia pro Galileo' was a spirited defense of reasoning and the scientific method, but it ran afoul of the Church's traditional reliance on Aristotelian logic (not that Campanella's reputation as a rebel helped). The same year the 'Apologia' was written, the Church issued an edict declaring heliocentrism (the belief that the sun is at the center of the solar system) a heresy. \n"}, {"text": "After these inauspicious beginnings, however, astronomical speculation began to take off. What English clergyman penned the 1638 treatise 'The Discovery of a World in the Moone', in which he set out to prove, in thirteen logical propositions, the existence of aliens on the moon?", "correct": "John Wilkins", "options": ["William Whewell", "Francis Godwin", "Henry St. John Bolingbroke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Wilkins.\n\n\tAnxious of his reputation and the approval of the Anglican Church, Wilkins took care to distance himself from his own logic, repeatedly crediting previous philosophers (like Campanella, Kepler, and Bruno) with his own lines of reasoning. \n"}, {"text": "Which other English clergyman wrote 'The Man in the Moone' (1638), arguably the first true work of science fiction, in which the Spanish sailor Gonzalez voyages to the moon and meets with its inhabitants?", "correct": "Francis Godwin", "options": ["John Wilkins", "Henry St. John Bolingbroke", "William Whewell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancis Godwin.\n\n\tGodwin had his story published posthumously, so he didn't need to worry about ecclesiastical retribution. The tale, written in the first person, describes how Gonzalez harnesses himself to a flock of spacefaring geese who transport him to the moon - how his food supplies are cursed by demons on the way up - and how the people of the moon are thirty-foot-tall Anglicans who venerate Queen Elizabeth I, whose heights vary according to their virtues, and who exile their shortest children to Earth where they pose as human. \n"}, {"text": "A more famous story, 'Voyages to the Moon and the Sun', was written by what acerbic Frenchman, celebrated for the breadth of his wit and the length of his nose?", "correct": "Cyrano de Bergerac", "options": ["Emanuel Swedenborg", "Bernard de Fontenelle", "Voltaire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCyrano de Bergerac.\n\n\tDe Bergerac uses the format of a space odyssey to cleverly skewer human society. A high point occurs when the birds who inhabit the moon put the protagonist, Dyrcona, on trial for humanity's habit of killing and eating their kind. \n"}, {"text": "'The Celestial Worlds Discover'd', Christiaan Huygens' 1698 attempt to reconcile extra-terrestrial life with theology, admits that perhaps humans are not superior to all other life forms -- but founders when, in an effort to prove that all other life forms must of course be essentially human, Huygens humorously imagines an intelligent alien ...?", "correct": "lobster", "options": ["clam", "dog", "turtle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nlobster.\n\n\tMany find it surprising that Huygens, who invented the pendulum clock, could have such a failure of imagination that he literally could not conceive of any way to put together an intelligent entity that was not basically human. \n"}, {"text": "Jonathan Swift's 'Gulliver's Travels' deals with the voyages of Lemuel Gulliver on Earth, but one 'island' he visits actually floats in the air, miles above the surface of the planet. Its inhabitants, quite alien by human standards, rule the continent below with an iron fist. What is the name of this island, home of the first alien race to threaten humanity?", "correct": "Laputa", "options": ["Brobdingnag", "Balnibarbi", "Land of the Houynhnhnms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaputa.\n\n\tLaputa, as much like a spaceship as it is like a planet, is kept above the Earth by an oddity in the local magnetic field. Brobdingnag is the land of the giants Gulliver encounters after the Lilliputians, Balnibarbi is the land ruled by the Laputans, and the Houynhnhnms are the intelligent, virtuous horses whom Gulliver meets last of all. \n"}, {"text": "Voltaire is most famous for his story 'Candide,' but in 1751 he published what short story, in which a colossal traveler from a planet orbiting the star Sirius visits Earth with his Saturnian companion?", "correct": "'Micromegas'", "options": ["'Zolee'", "'Le Sirien'", "'Les Voyageurs'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Micromegas'.\n\n\tMicromegas is the name of the Sirian, who encounters a shipful of human philosophers. The ensuing debate is a clever rail against the egoism of human thinkers - one such man, standing in Micromegas' massive palm, has the gall to insist that the alien, his home star, and all in the universe was created for humanity's benefit. \n"}, {"text": "Finally, Percival Lowell, self-appointed 'Roosevelt of Astronomy', published two works on a single planet in 1896 and 1908. In them, he claimed that the 'canals' he saw were conclusive proof of an intelligent alien species doomed by drought, and a sensation was born. What planet was he describing?", "correct": "Mars", "options": ["the moon", "Venus", "Jupiter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMars.\n\n\tLowell seriously believed in what he thought he saw, but his observations were so tenuous, and his claims so wild, that his books 'Mars' and 'Mars as the Abode of Life' must be regarded as early science fiction. He had a lively (and hair-trigger) imagination. \n"}]}
