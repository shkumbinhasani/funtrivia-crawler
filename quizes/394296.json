{"id": "394296", "name": "Increasingly More Dangerous Outdoor Activities Online Trivia | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "  Outdoor Activities"], "questions": [{"text": "Geocaching is a low-impact way to get outside for a scavenger hunt.  There's a form of geocaching called Munzee which uses GPS, smart-phones, and which of these to track your progress?", "correct": "QR codes", "options": ["The Tinder app", "Stamps", "GoPro cameras"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQR codes.\n\n\tGeocaching is an interesting way to spend your day.  You grab coordinates online and use a GPS to track your way through to the treasure at the end, kind of like a scavenger hunt.  The catch with Munzee, a unique variant on this activity, is that you scan QR codes left by other players that you find using the same methods.  Doing this, you can collect as many as you can, all around the world, and accumulate your totals (in the millions, if you were really wondering how many you could get). \n"}, {"text": "If you're heading out into the wilderness to go 'angling', which of these activities would you be partaking in?", "correct": "Fishing", "options": ["Reading under a tree", "Hunting", "Tree-planting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFishing.\n\n\tA fisherman who is an 'angler' is one who uses a hook to catch fish, and while you don't necessarily need to be in the wilderness to partake in this activity, it could certainly help.  There are many ways you could go fishing-- you could be a fly-fisher or a boat fisher or a troller.  Alternatively, if you're not the angling type, you may simply decide to head out on your massive boat and go big game fishing for the deadliest catch of all: MAN...\r ...ATEE.  Just kidding.  Don't fish for manatee.\r Or people. \n"}, {"text": "Disc golf can be an intense sport of focus and precise technique, but instead of 'holes', the game uses which of these?", "correct": "Baskets", "options": ["Barrels", "Nets", "Goals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaskets.\n\n\tIn traditional golf, the aim of the game is to knock the ball into the hole in the lowest amount of strokes of the club.  Well, disc golf is pretty much the same thing, only instead of a ball, you have a disc; instead of a hole, you shoot into a raised, chain basket; instead of a club, you're letting it rip with your dominant arm. The game is highly technical if you let it be since there are entire lines of specialized discs, each with different accuracy ratings, speeds, and fades.  Not to mention, there are different techniques you can use while shooting to accomplish your goal.  Fun stuff, but let me tell you, I have preexisting neck and shoulder problems and seasonal allergies. I'm sure you can infer the connection, but I can probably say that about most of the activities I bring up here.  Maybe I just want to digress. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these exotic locations would you most likely go snorkelling?", "correct": "Cozumel, Mexico", "options": ["Punta Arenas, Chile", "Anchorage, Alaska", "Dhaka, Bangladesh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCozumel, Mexico.\n\n\tSnorkelling is an activity typically done in clear, calm, tropical waters, and while you could technically stick a snorkel into your mouth and dive in pretty much anywhere, there are good reasons not to do so in Alaska, urban Dhaka, or the rough, oceanic waters around Tierra Del Fuego, notably the safety of those spots. Mexico, however, is warm and likely filled with clear waters, reefs, and colourful underwater sea life worth checking out.  And it's easy to pick up; snorkelling really only needs a snorkel and, usually, a mask to better check out your surroundings.  If scuba diving is just a bit too claustrophobic or complex for your liking, this is the best way for a beginner to see what they're missing under the surface. \n"}, {"text": "Taking a canoe trip in the wilderness is a good opportunity to walk less-trodden paths.  What is the practice of transporting a canoe over land (usually overhead)?", "correct": "Portage", "options": ["Towing", "Freeboating", "Lugging"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortage.\n\n\tPortage dates back a long time as North American Natives and settlers used the method to transport their boats over long stretches of land between waterways, often doing so to avoid rough patches of rapids.  Portaging is a nature activity nowadays and though it usually only attracts those looking to go camping or hiking in the deep wilderness, it is common practice, especially in North American national parks. Though it was popular day-to-day activity during the fur trade era, it's been used all around the world; it's a recent activity that's sort of pulled itself from the realm of necessity and into the recreational sphere. \n"}, {"text": "Paddleboarding is most typically done in which position?", "correct": "Kneeling", "options": ["Lying down", "The fetal position", "Sitting cross-legged"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKneeling.\n\n\tWhile typical paddleboarding is done kneeling down on a surfboard or a proper paddleboard to preserve a low center of gravity, there's also a subset of hobbyists who ride paddleboards standing up, perfecting their of balance and using an oar to navigate their way through calm water (though rougher waters do make for interesting paddleboard scenarios in the ocean).  Standup paddleboarding, oddly, has become more and more popular over time as a fad hobby, even seeing crossover with other low-impact activities like yoga. \n"}, {"text": "Someone going spelunking is likely to do so in which of these settings?", "correct": "Cave", "options": ["Abandoned warehouse", "Open field", "Public beach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCave.\n\n\tSpelunking can be a bit dangerous, especially in unexplored cave systems, due to the nature of being underground, but it can also be an adventurous and exciting pastime regardless of if you're doing it at your own leisure or going cave-diving as an adrenaline junkie.  While there are many cave systems out there that have been explored thoroughly, there's a plethora that simply haven't been explored or mapped. If you're into the idea of danger, then spelunking in one of the latter caves is a treat; as many cave-divers know: even the most professional cave-divers put themselves in significant risk to explore new ground. \n"}, {"text": "Also known for the term flying-fox, which of these involves gliding through the air on a cable?", "correct": "Ziplining", "options": ["Ascending", "Slacklining", "Parasliding"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZiplining.\n\n\tZiplining is typically done in forested regions though it can reasonably be done anywhere where you have clearance to set up a line overhead (without obstacles).  For this activity, you're harnessed in and let go along a long cable that allows you to safely glide along.  Interestingly, ziplines are most commonly seen in rainforests since they allow visitors to travel over the canopies, but some of the longest in the world are found in very different locations-- think in the deserts in the United Arab Emirates or over a Mexican canyon. A flying-fox run is similar to a zipline, but it's more commonly used by children. \n"}, {"text": "Sandboarding is typically done with the same board as used in snowboarding.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSandboarding actually requires a thicker board because the material you're gliding over is much different.  Due to the coarse nature of the sand, boards used for this adventure sport also need to be heavily waxed, otherwise the ride is much rougher than you would expect.  To go sandboarding, you would need to head to a desert; it requires a tall dune, and while that may be difficult to find depending on where you are, it's an adventure sport done on nearly every continent (not Antarctica, obviously). \n"}, {"text": "Popularized in New Zealand, what extreme activity originated from land diving practices on the islands of Vanuatu?", "correct": "Bungee jumping", "options": ["BASE jumping", "Skydiving", "Trapese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBungee jumping.\n\n\tAlthough bungeeing, to an extent, has been around for quite a long time in Polynesia, commercialized bungee jumping started to take off in New Zealand in the 1980s, eventually becoming an extreme activity for thrill-seekers around the world.  While most bungees are performed off existing structures like bridges or tall towers, many bungees have also been performed out of helicopters and from the ground as 'hot rocket bungees' (where you shoot into the air). \n"}]}
