According to many, his best work, however, which even beat out \"The Scarlet Letter\", was \"A House of Seven Gables.\"\r Hawthorne is also a Beanie Baby bear. He is fuzzy all over and brown.

Which of these can also be found on a golf ball?", "correct": "Dimples", "options": ["Hodges", "Freckles", "Wrinkles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDimples.\n\n\tDimples are indents on the cheeks, that are usually only visible when one smiles.

The average ranges from 250-450 dimples, some have 500 dimples. The record amount of dimples on a single golf ball was 1,070. There is only one single brand of golf ball that has an odd number of dimples, with 333 dimples. Other than that, they are always even numbered.  Dimples in the ball actually help the ball travel through the air!\r Dimples is, of course, also the name of a Beanie Baby. And while all these may have been Beanie Babies, only Dimples is something found on both the face and a golf ball. In this case, it is yet another Beanie Baby bear. He is a light tan all over, and has a yellow smiley face on his chest. \n"}, {"text": "There are several ways this word can be used. For one, it has been a slang term for the Australian $10 bill. This can also be a stringed instrument made by African Americans who were slaves in the United States and just wanted to have some fun.

You can use this nut to flavor anything, from icing to cake, to putting it on your steak if you are daring, as the flavor called \"amaretto\". It can be used to make marzipan. You can use these to form a paste. You can even eat them raw. What is this universal nut?", "correct": "Almond", "options": ["Peanut", "Pecan", "Cashew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlmond.\n\n\tAlmonds are technically not nuts at all. In fact, they are considered to be, botanically, drupes. Drupes include almonds, coffee, mangoes, and olives.  Almonds, interestingly, have a very high nutritional value. In just one serving, you will receive 25% of your daily calcium, 30% of your zinc, and 74% of your magnesium intake for the day! However, nuts are high in fat, so eating them in moderation is a good thing. While the fats are good for you from that of an almond, too much is not a good idea. It is like wine. A little is good, but too much is bad!\r While all of these are Beanie Babies, Almond is the only one that fits all the descriptions. Almond is a tan bear that sits more like Ewey, Aurora, and Congo than a regular bear, like Clubby or Pappa. \n"}, {"text": "These can be very deadly. If you are caught in one, it is said that you have the best chance of survival if you swim. You will be carried to the top and you may be saved. What kind of natural disaster might this be?", "correct": "Avalanche", "options": ["Hurricane", "Earthquake", "Tornado"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvalanche.\n\n\tAn avalanche might be triggered by several things. If there is a large amount of snow on the ground, on a steep angle, that proves to be a hazard. If a snowboarder, or a dog, or anything else, moves over certain parts of the snow, it will trigger the avalanche and the giant mass of snow breaks off from the mountain. Gravity does the rest. It is said that swimming using big motions will keep you above the snow, and prevent you from being buried. If you ever go snowboarding or skiing, it is best to have a loud device in hand in case of an avalanche.  This will allow others to hear exactly where you are and unbury you.\r Avalanche is also the name of a Siberian Husky Beanie Baby. He sits like Cutesy, Darling, and Cassie. He is gray and white, like the average Siberian Husky is. \n"}, {"text": "What quiz inspired by a video games quiz would be complete without a question about video games?

It was originally written as \"Brandy\" in 1971, and was sung this way in the United Kingdom. It was changed to \"Mandy\" so people would stop thinking it was another song titled \"Brandy.\" \"Mandy\" was also a song by the Jonas Brothers in 2006. Not to be confused with Manilow's version, it is nothing like it. It was released on their very first album, \"It's About Time\". Other songs on this album included \"7:05,\" \"Time for Me to Fly\", \"Underdog\", \"I Am What I Am\" and \"Year 3000\"  As Nick Jonas' voice deepened, the Jonas Brothers had a year of inactivity.

They come in five different flavors; cherry, orange, lemon, lime, and licorice. Each package has one of each of these flavors.\r Chuckles is, of course, a Beanie Baby as well. This Beanie Baby is a hedgehog. Hedgehogs are prickly, but not like porcupines! Sometimes, hedgehogs will click at you, which means they are threatening you, they are scared, or are hungry. It could, though, be a combination of the three. Maybe they are hungry, went to you for food, you looked at them funny, so they were scared, and begin threatening you so you will leave them alone. Poor hedgehog! \n"}]}
