{"id": "222098", "name": "Biographies in the Movies II Quiz | Biographical Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Biographical Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Oliver Stone's 2004 epic film 'Alexander' depicts the life and times of which famed Alexander of history?", "correct": "Alexander the Great", "options": ["Alexander Rublev", "Alexander Graham Bell", "Czar Alexander I of Russia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlexander the Great.\n\n\tCriticially panned, Stone's film (I would have used the word 'controversial' as an adjective there, but what's the point...all of Stone's films are controversial!) featured the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Val Kilmer, Christopher Plummer, Angelina Jolie and Colin Farrell (as Alexander) in its cast.  One of the controversial topics in the film centered on Alexander's bisexuality. \n"}, {"text": "In 2001, a film about the life of Muhammad Ali arrived in theaters.  Which actor took a swing at playing the role of the famed boxing champ?", "correct": "Will Smith", "options": ["Denzel Washington", "Jamie Foxx", "Cuba Gooding Jr."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill Smith.\n\n\tWill Smith was not the first person to portray Muhammad Ali in a biographical film about the self proclaimed 'Greatest Boxer of All-Time'.  That honor would go to Muhammad Ali himself, who appeared as himself in the 1977 film 'The Greatest'.  Though I was fond of Will Smith's attempt to play Muhammad Ali in the 2001 film 'Ali', I think that Ali himself did a better job in 'The Greatest'. \n"}, {"text": "The 1969 film 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' killed two birds with one stone by portraying the lives of both legendary western outlaws.  Which pair of actors portrayed these two icons of the 19th century?", "correct": "Paul Newman and Robert Redford", "options": ["Marlon Brando and George Kennedy", "Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift", "Warren Beatty and Richard Gere"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul Newman and Robert Redford.\n\n\t'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kidd' was directed by George Roy Hill, and featured a screenplay by William Goldman.  Newman and Redford resonate on the silver screen with their perfect chemistry, and Katharine Ross provides the perfect dose of feminity, creating just that tiny touch of tension that a great buddy film needs. \n"}, {"text": "In 1980, movie viewers were treated to a lovely little performance by Sissy Spacek in the biographical film 'Coal Miner's Daughter'.  Which country/western singer did Spacek portray in the film?", "correct": "Loretta Lynn", "options": ["Patsy Cline", "Tammy Wynette", "Minnie Pearl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoretta Lynn.\n\n\tSissy Spacek won a Best Actress Oscar for her subtle and heartfelt portrayal of legendary singer Loretta Lynn.  This was the only Academy Award garnered by the film. \n"}, {"text": "What was the surname of the classic Hollywood movie actress portrayed by Jessica Lange in the 1982 film 'Frances'?", "correct": "Farmer", "options": ["Ursted", "Bond", "Marx"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFarmer.\n\n\t'Frances' is the shocking story of the tragic life of Frances Farmer, an actress whose life was seemingly destroyed by the rigors of Hollywood.  Jessica Lange was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her performance, but did not win. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite sports biographies was a 1942 film depicting the short but accomplished life of Lou Gehrig.  What is the title of this movie that features Gary Cooper in the lead role?", "correct": "Pride of the Yankees", "options": ["The Lou Gehrig Story", "The Iron Horse", "From Rags to Riches"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPride of the Yankees.\n\n\tSam Wood directed and Gary Cooper starred in this film, which also featured Babe Ruth portraying himself.  The movie was nominated for 11 Oscars, including nominations for Best Picture and Best Actor, but only won a single award (for Best Film Editing). \n"}, {"text": "'Papillon' is the story of a man who has been condemned to serve the rest of his life in a wretched place, namely a prison in French Guiana.  Portrayed by Steve McQueen, what is the name of the lead character and author of the book upon which the film is based?", "correct": "Henri Charri\u00e8re", "options": ["Andr\u00e9 Jory", "Louis Dega", "Robert Chatal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenri Charri\u00e8re.\n\n\tThe story of Henri Charri\u00e8re's stay at the prison in French Guiana is harrowing indeed.  Happily, Steve McQueen (alongside his pal Dustin Hoffman, who played the prisoner Louis Dega) brings out the essence of his character in a remarkably humanistic performance.  If you haven't seen this film, better mark it down as a 'must see'! \n"}, {"text": "Charlie Chaplin has appeared as a character in various films, but none that tell his life story as completely as the 1992 film 'Chaplin', featuring which actor in a very able performance?", "correct": "Robert Downey Jr.", "options": ["Corey Haim", "Anthony Michael Hall", "Charlie Sheen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Downey Jr.\n\n\tIn my estimation, Robert Downey Jr. does quite a convincing job playing the silent screen legend Charlie Chaplin, even down to his facial mannerisms and body language.  The film is interesting also in its casting of Geraldine Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin's daughter, as Hannah Chaplin, the actor's mother. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the 1989 movie that attempts to tell the story of the tragic life of the talented comedic actor John Belushi?", "correct": "Wired", "options": ["Freaked Out", "Dazed and Confused", "Postcards from the Edge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWired.\n\n\tOne of the least well-received biographical films that I can recall, it featured Michael Chiklis in the lead role as John Belushi.  Friends and relatives of Belushi, including Dan Aykroyd and John's brother James, decided to boycott the film, which they viewed as an unfair portrayal of the troubled but talented funnyman. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the boxing star whose life is put under scrutiny in the classic 1980 film 'Raging Bull'?", "correct": "Jake La Motta", "options": ["Rocky Marciano", "Floyd Patterson", "Sugar Ray Robinson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJake La Motta.\n\n\tIn one of the most hard-hitting and personal biopics to ever emerge from the cinema, Robert De Niro put on a performance for the ages as the self-destructive former boxing champion Jake La Motta.  Martin Scorsese, the master of biopics, does a perfect job of portraying the brutality of La Motta's life while not allowing us to dismiss the human side of the confrontational boxer.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
