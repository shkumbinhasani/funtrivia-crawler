In Iceland, you can use a single kr\u00f3na or numerous kr\u00f3nur. The Icelandic kr\u00f3na was once divided into 100 aurar but those are no longer used. The smallest banknote denomination now in use is the 500 kr\u00f3nur (about \u00a32.50 or US $4 in 2012).\rOther countries in the GMT time zone include the Faroe Islands (where the currency is a version of the Danish krone), Ivory Coast, Ghana and Senegal (where the Franc remains as a reminder of French colonization).\rOf the other alternatives, both Norway and Denmark are both one hour ahead of GMT. \n"}, {"text": "Moving eastwards, we go forward one hour (GMT +1.00) to what is often called 'Central European Time' in the northern hemisphere.
