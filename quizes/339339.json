{"id": "339339", "name": "Mont-Saint-Michel, The Mount of Marvels Quiz | World | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " World Sites", "Buildings & Landmarks"], "questions": [{"text": "The cult of Saint Michael began in the late 5th century on Monte Gargano, where the archangel had supposedly appeared in a cave. In which present day country is Monte Gargano situated?", "correct": "Italy", "options": ["Greece", "Spain", "Turkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItaly.\n\n\tMonte Gargano is situated on the Gargano promontory in the southern Italian province of Foggia which extends into the Adriatic Sea. The coastal areas of Gargano are rich in fine beaches and are consequently popular with tourists.  The highest point at 1,065m is Monte Calvo. Most of Gargano's upland areas fall within the Gargano National Park which was founded in 1991. \n"}, {"text": "The granite massif on which the abbey at Mont-Saint-Michel stands is not the only prominent feature in the bay area. There is another small islet situated 3km away that has been described as \"Its forlorn rowing boat moored forever in the silvery mirror of the bay\". By what name is this small islet known?", "correct": "Tombelaine", "options": ["Ile d'Yeu", "Alderney", "Ile d'Ouessant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTombelaine.\n\n\tA small islet with a silhouette resembling the Sphinx, Tombelaine has been many things. It has been used by hermits (monks seeking solitude), as a place of exile, as an English garrison during the Hundred Years War, as a bird sanctuary and during the 1920s it was even considered ideal for development with villas, hotels and a casino. Thankfully, the project failed and Tombelaine was bought by the French state in 1933. \n"}, {"text": "\"Get this into your head, I need my own sanctuary\". According to legend, who demanded this in a dream visited upon Bishop Aubert of Avranches in 708?", "correct": "The archangel Michael", "options": ["The archangel Gabriel", "Mephistopheles", "The angel Ambriel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe archangel Michael.\n\n\tThe Archangel Michael appeared in the dreams of Bishop Aubert over a number of years and his requests were always resisted. This was until the angel lost his patience and touched Bishop Aubert on the head, his finger burning a hole through the bishop's skull... Apparently he took notice after this and work on the earliest shrine, a grotto, began on the mount shortly afterwards!\rThe hebrew name MI-KA-EL (Who is like God?), comes from a question asked of Lucifer by the nameless archangel after Lucifer had dared to claim to be God's equal. In the Book of Revelation, after casting out the dragon, the question became the name of the victor. \n"}, {"text": "Which great European emperor, who is thought to have visited the mount, imposed the cult and the feast day of Saint Michael on the 29th of September?", "correct": "Charlemagne", "options": ["Otto III", "Lothair I", "Frederick I"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlemagne.\n\n\tCharlemagne, Charles the Great or Carolus Magnus is considered to be the father of Europe. Born c.742 - 28th January 814, he was a Frankish king who became the head of an empire that covered the greater part of western and central Europe.  He was beatified at Aachen in 814 by Pope Benedict XIV and canonized in 1166 by the anti-pope Pascal III. Charlemagne has his principal shrine in Aachen Cathedral, Germany. \n"}, {"text": "Alongside its high and tremendously thick battlements, the mount has a greater and far more formidable defence that has claimed the lives of many invaders and pilgrims to the mount alike. Known as 'Tangue' - a word of Viking origin - what is/are these defences?", "correct": "Quicksand", "options": ["Sandbank", "Reef", "Fast flowing current"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuicksand.\n\n\tFor all its fortifications, Mont-Saint-Michel has the best of natural defences. King Harold can be seen rescuing knights from the 'tangue' during the war between William, Duke of Normandy and Conan II, Duke of Brittany on the Bayeux Tapestry. Who knows how many soldiers or pilgrims have their graves in these quicksands? In my opinion the best description of these dangers can be found in the words of Victor Hugo as anyone who has read Les Miserables will agree...it ends \"Sinister obliteration of a man\". Chilling stuff indeed. \n"}, {"text": "In what architectural style was the original abbey built on the north face - the steepest face - of the rock?", "correct": "Romanesque", "options": ["Early Christian", "Renaissance", "Byzantine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRomanesque.\n\n\tRomanesque architecture is readily identifiable through its use of massive walls and large semi-circular arches, a stark contrast to the gothic style which used thin, high walls with pointed arches. For all their substance, romanesque buildings are frequently unstable and incapable of supporting a vaulted ceiling and this is why the gothic choir has a vaulted ceiling but the romanesque nave has a Norman barrel-vaulted ceiling.In their enthusiasm to rebuild the choir in the gothic style, the monks of the 16th century almost demolished the romanesque nave. It is possible to see today at the south side of the apse the beginnings of gothic arches. \n"}, {"text": "The first monks appointed to the abbey were followers of the doctrine of a key figure in history and one who is considered to be one of the forefathers of Europe. Who was this figure?", "correct": "Saint Benedict", "options": ["Saint Augustine", "Saint Boniface", "Saint Cyril"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaint Benedict.\n\n\tSaint Benedict was born in what is now Umbria, Italy in AD 480. He is one of the patron saints of Europe (the other being Saint Cyril) and also of students. His religious writing, known as the Rule of Benedict, was adopted by many religious communities throughout the medieval period. These writings became the most important of their kind in western christendom. \n"}, {"text": "Under the great 12th century abbot Robert de Torigni, what developed on the mount to become one of the greatest of its kind in all of Europe?", "correct": "The scriptorium or library", "options": ["The refectory", "The cloister", "The crypt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe scriptorium or library.\n\n\tFrom one of the greatest libraries of the medieval world we can still see some 200 surviving manuscripts of various forms, some at the abbey itself and others at its workshops in Avranches. There were copies of works by Plato, Seneca and Ovid and Aristotle's treatise on logic. Housed in two towers, the Tour de l'Horloge, they were all destroyed when the towers collapsed in 1300.  On the 6th of June 1944, over 3,000 of the abbey's original charters, priceless documents, were destroyed when St Lo was bombed as part of the Normandy landings. \n"}, {"text": "Fifty metres high and eighty metres long, this addition to the abbey was constructed between 1210 and 1230.  Consisting of two blocks of three floors, this building was, and still is, considered to be an emblem of eternal France, 'a skyscraper of its period'. Known as La Merveille (The Marvel) it contains a number of rooms, one being the Salle des Chevaliers. Who would be expected to use this room?", "correct": "Knights", "options": ["Monks", "Soldiers", "Pilgrims"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKnights.\n\n\tLa Merveille was a feat of engineering unsurpassed in its time, mainly because of the position on the rock on which it has been built. The eastern wing comprises three dining rooms on three floors. At the bottom was the almonry for the underlings, above that a room called the Salle des Hotes and at the very top, the superb refectory.At the base of the western block was a large storeroom, above that the Salle des Chevaliers and at the top, the beautiful cloister. The Merveille represents the social hierarchy of the time. Those people who worked and produced were at the bottom; those who fought and defended the population at the centre; and those who prayed for everybody's souls at the top... How things have changed! \n"}, {"text": "In 1421 the abbey's romanesque choir collapsed. At around 1450 the Hundred Years War was coming to an end. With this, pilgrimages to the mount increased again and, consequently, the fortunes of the abbey itself. In 1521-1523, the choir was rebuilt in the gothic style. What is a particular feature of this architectural style?", "correct": "The flying buttress", "options": ["The barrel-vaulted roof", "The semi-circular arch", "The dome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe flying buttress.\n\n\tThe gothic choir reaches a height of 25 metres at its highest point. The final vault has keystones decorated with the arms of the abbot, Jean III de Lamps, who was responsible for the completion of the work on this new choir.  Because buildings in the gothic style had rather thin walls they had a tendency to be out of plumb and this, combined with the lateral forces bearing down on them from the roof, frequently led to collapse.To counter this, flying buttresses and counter-forts were constructed to support these fine walls. The counter-forts were often surmounted by highly decorated pinnacles that not only added a certain aesthetic but also provided additional weight to secure the masonry beneath them. \n"}, {"text": "Members of which religious group, tempted by the location and riches of the mount, tried desperately to take over the mount in the final years of the 16th and early years of the 17th centuries?", "correct": "The Huguenots", "options": ["The Jesuits", "The Lutherans", "The Anglicans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Huguenots.\n\n\tThe Huguenots were members of the Protestant Reformed Church of France and were followers of the writings of John Calvin. This was a period of decline for the abbey on Mont-Saint-Michel. In one attempt to take the abbey in 1591, over 100 Huguenot swordsmen were killed in a massacre after being lured into La Merveille by an inhabitant of the mount. \r By this time the Benedictine order on the mount was beginning to fall apart.  Many of the monks no longer knew Latin or Greek, most had forgotten their vows of chastity, the taverns of the village were populated with drunkards and the buildings were neglected and fell into disrepair. In 1622, other Benedictines from St Maur moved in to impose reform but they too failed and the Benedictine order on the mount ended with Cardinal de Montmorency-Laval. \n"}, {"text": "During the year 1790, all monastic orders in France were suppressed due to the French Revolution. By this time and after years of neglect, the abbey on the mount was dirty, dilapidated and, to all intents and purposes, abandoned. At this time the mount underwent, ironically, a change of name to 'Mont-Libre'.  For what purpose was the mount used after this date?", "correct": "A prison", "options": ["A hospital", "A garrison", "A seat of government"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA prison.\n\n\tAlthough the mount has always had its prisoners, it was not until the reign of Louis XI that the mount lived up to its moniker of the 'Bastille by the sea' when he sent his fillettes there in 1472. A fillette was a narrow cage made of wooden bars that were re-inforced with metal, and hung from the ceiling. It was a particularly cruel form of torture to be imprisoned within a fillette.  Prior to this the mount had housed english prisoners of the Hundred Years War and even before this, small cells known as 'oubliettes' were used to punish monks who did not respect and live up to their vows and those who were deemed delinquent.\r In 1863, Napoleon III, president and emperor, closed the prison despite protests from the inhabitants who made their living from it. Over the centuries, the total number of prisoners that were incarcerated on the mount is unknown, but it is estimated that in the seventy years or so from the French Revolution through to its closure, the prison had held 14,000 people. Numbers of those that died during their imprisonment are unknown. \n"}, {"text": "During the 18th century the abbey on the mount was in possession of its greatest ever number of what exactly?", "correct": "Saintly relics", "options": ["Villagers", "Manuscripts", "Monks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaintly relics.\n\n\tAt the maximum, the abbey was said to possess some 246 relics that represented 150 saints.  These included a pierced skull, said to be that of Bishop Aubert, still displaying the 'print' of the archangel's finger although this is actually believed to have been caused by a benign cyst - the bishop was known to have had a large lump on the right hand side of his head.\r Other relics included a tooth from Saint John the Baptist, a finger from Saint Vincent, a piece of Christ's rib, a few tufts of hair belonging to Saint Francis and even a lump of coal believed to have come from the oven used by Saint Lawrence! \n"}, {"text": "In which year, after campaigns by many of France's romantic artisans including Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert and the historian Jules Michelet, was the mount first listed as a historical monument by the French government?", "correct": "1874", "options": ["1870", "1872", "1876"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1874.\n\n\tThe first of these saviours of the mount arrived there in 1835 whilst it was still a prison. This was the young architect Viollet-le-Duc. When he left, he had in his possession eleven watercolours and a plan for a spire. In 1841 the head of Monuments Historique, Prosper Merimee, visited the mount.\r The main restoration work began in 1879 under the control of the architect Edouard Corroyer but the work was not completed until around 1897 with the construction of the spire that can be seen today with its golden statue of Saint Michael at the pinnacle. \n"}, {"text": "The now stunningly beautiful abbey at Mont-Saint-Michel is France's most visited tourist site.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tUnbelievably, the abbey at Mont-Saint-Michel is actually the third most visited tourist site in France after the Eiffel Tower and the chateau at Versailles. The mount was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1979 and receives upwards of 3.5 million visitors each year, most of whom are foreigners and (which came as a surprise to this author who has made the journey many times) only one third of whom make the journey to the abbey at the summit. \n"}]}
