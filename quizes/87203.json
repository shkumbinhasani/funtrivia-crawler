What is it called?  \n", "correct": "Enso", "options": ["Engobe", "Enoka", "Echizen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEnso.\n\n\tThere are various interpretations on what these enso circles mean, but I prefer the suggestion that they mean nothing...which is what a good Zen monk should be focusing on while he meditates.  Some modern Japanese artists have revived the enso circle in their work, most notably Yoshihara Jiro with his painting 'Red Circle on Black' (1965) and the ceramic-maker Yagi Kazuo with is piece called, simply, 'Circle'. \n"}, {"text": "In Chinese painting, these creatures symbolize wealth...name them!  \n", "correct": "Fish", "options": ["Frogs", "Falcons", "Felines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFish.\n\n\tThis makes sense when one realizes that the words for fish (yu) and surplus (yu) are pronounced exactly the same. \n"}, {"text": "What is the popular English name given to the walled imperial palace of the former Chinese emperors in Beijing?  \n", "correct": "Forbidden City", "options": ["Four-walled Fortress", "Fabled Palace", "Forboding Quarter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForbidden City.\n\n\tThis wonderful fortress is a must see when one visits Beijing.
