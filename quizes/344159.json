{"id": "344159", "name": "Somewhere Over The... Quiz | Thematic Fun | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun", "Thematic Media"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Sprain Toe\".\n\nIs it possible to sprain a toe?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIt is most definitely possible to sprain a toe, as the toe has a joint.  A sprain is a partial tear of ligaments where bones meet.  So it is actually possible to sprain more than just an ankle or neck.  You can sprain your toes, fingers, elbow, and your knees, too, among other locations of the body. \n"}, {"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Drain Flow\".\n\nWhen you flush, the toilet water (and other contents, of course) go through a series of pipes.  One of these pipes is U shaped, and water sits in the \"U\" all the time, as well as in the toilet bowl.  Why is this?", "correct": "The water blocks the smell", "options": ["So cats don't escape through the toilet", "Because plumbers get paid by the amount of the pipe they use; so twisting pipes is a bigger paycheck than straight pipes", "So if you drop valuables in the toilet, it will stay in this \"U\" pipe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe water blocks the smell.\n\n\tThe \"U\" shaped pipe has several functions, but one of these functions is to catch water.  The water will stay in this pipe, and this keeps the sewage smell from filling your bathroom.  The sewage smell travels up the pipes, but it will stop at the water.  The water in the pipes and toilet bowl serve other functions, as well, but for the smell-stopping I am most thankful.  ;-) \n"}, {"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Jane Doe\".\n\nJane Doe is often used as a name for an unidentified female.  What is the term for an unidentified male?", "correct": "John Doe", "options": ["John Deere", "Jim Deere", "Jim Doe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Doe.\n\n\tA John Doe is someone who cannot be identified.  This is often used in a hospital.  People are often seriously injured, and cannot tell the doctors what their names are.  In some instances, no ID can be found for the person, either.  In such cases, the name \"John Doe\" for men and \"Jane Doe\" for women is used until the name can be determined. \n"}, {"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Main Foe\".\n\nCrash Bandicoot is a popular video game character, but which of these is HIS main foe?", "correct": "Doctor Neo Cortex", "options": ["Tiny the Tiger", "Pinstripe", "Dingodile"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoctor Neo Cortex.\n\n\tDoctor Cortex is Crash Bandicoot's main nemesis in *most* of the \"Crash Bandicoot\" video games.  Some games have other baddies as his main enemy, including N. Gin, N. Bryo, Nitrous Oxide, and N. Tropy.  Crash Bandicoot is forever fighting Cortex, however, and his evil mask, Uka Uka.  Uka Uka is the evil twin brother of Crash's mask friend, Aku Aku. \n"}, {"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Chain Glow\".\n\nWith glow sticks, you can make a giant chain.  Which of these is the best way to keep your glow stick glowing for a longer period of time?", "correct": "Stick it in the freezer", "options": ["Submerge it in warm water", "Only break a part of the stick at a time", "Nothing; it will last 12 hours, period"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStick it in the freezer.\n\n\tThe length of time a glow stick will glow varies between each stick, and also the environment the stick is in.  A trick that quite a few children like to use is to stick the glow stick in the freezer.  The extreme cold will slow down the chemical reaction inside the glow stick, and thus it will take longer to complete.  While this means the glow stick will last longer, the glow will also not be as bright.  Alternately, a glow stick will be extra bright if it is heated by putting it in hot water; but the chemical reaction is also working quicker, so it will not last as long.\r To activate a glow stick, all you have to do is snap the glow stick and shake it.  Bending the glow stick breaks the tiny glass tube inside, which mixes the chemicals, which glow when they react.  Shaking the stick evenly distributes the chemicals so the entire stick glows, and not just where you snapped it. \n"}, {"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Crane Show\".\n\nAll of these birds are named after the sound they make; which one is not from the Pelecaniformes family?", "correct": "Mourning Dove", "options": ["Whistling Heron", "Trumpeter Swan", "Whooping Crane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMourning Dove.\n\n\tThe Pelecaniformes family is made up of all birds with all four of their toes on each foot webbed.  These include pelicans, swans, herons, cranes, and others.\r In 2011, the whooping crane was the most endangered of all the birds listed.  Conservation groups have struggled to keep the population up.  The whooping crane does not naturally reproduce as quickly as other bird species.  Therefore, in 2005 there were 53 birds left; a year later, only 52 birds were left.  By the end of 2010, however, the population was brought back up to over 100.  People travel from all over the world to see whooping cranes.\r Of course, these four are not the only birds to be named after the sound they make.  The hummingbird, for instance, was so named because of the \"humming\" sound it makes as it flaps its wings. \n"}, {"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Mango\".\n\nThe mango is related to a lot of things, but which is not in the same family, Anacardiaceae?", "correct": "Almond", "options": ["Poison Ivy", "Cashew", "Pistachio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlmond.\n\n\tIf you can believe it, the mango is related to the cashew, pistachio, and even poison ivy!  Anacardiaceae is known as the \"sumac family\" or the \"cashew family\".  The mango is of the genus Mangifera, and the common mango is the Mangifera indica. \n"}, {"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Wayne Crow\".\n\nWhat sport did Wayne Crow play from 1960-1963?", "correct": "Football", "options": ["Basketball", "Baseball", "Cricket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFootball.\n\n\tWayne Crow played with the Oakland Raiders from 1960-1961 and with the Buffalo Bills from 1962-1963.  This meant he only played for four seasons as a running back in his entire career.\r Yet, he still had a Wikipedia page, and thus, a question from salami_swami. \n"}, {"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Stain Snow\".\n\nAccording to a popular cliche, what color snow should one not eat?", "correct": "Yellow", "options": ["Purple", "Brown", "Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYellow.\n\n\tThough it is often advised not to eat any snow at all, the actual phrase here is \"Don't eat the yellow snow\".  Pollutants in the air \"defile\" the snow, and though it might look clean, white, and delicious, you probably shouldn't eat the snow at all, let alone the yellow snow.\r PS - Yellow snow = urine stained (for those living in parts of the world who are perhaps not familiar with snow)  ;-) \n"}, {"text": "\"Somewhere Over the Train Woe\".\n\nIt's a sad time when a train derails.  There have been several movies based on this occurrence, too.  Which of these movies below does not involve a derailing train, but instead involves replaying eight minutes on a train over and over again?", "correct": "Source Code", "options": ["Runaway Train", "Unstoppable", "The Polar Express"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSource Code.\n\n\t\"Source Code\" was released in 2011, starring Jake Gyllenhaal.  The movie has Gyllenhaal enter the body of a man eight minutes before a train explodes.  In these eight minutes, Gyllenhaal must find who placed a bomb on a train.  Of course, he's in the \"source code\", and cannot change the past.  However, he can help stop the next bombing.  In that eight minutes...  well, I won't spoil it. \n"}]}
