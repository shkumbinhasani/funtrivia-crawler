{"id": "264577", "name": "Alphabetical Horror Films - B Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "What 1963 Hitchcock classic, starring Jessica Tandy and Rod Taylor, takes place in Bodega Bay?", "correct": "The Birds & Birds", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Birds & Birds.\n\n\tThis well-known horror film appeared at the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards and was known for its 'nature takes its revenge' plot.  \rIn the movie, the coastal town of Bodega Bay is terrorized by flocks upon flocks of wild birds, seemingly for no apparent reason.  As the small California town succumbs to nature's harsh wrath, the citizens fight to stay alive and hide from the birds.  Viewers will always remember the scene where a woman is trapped in a phone booth as birds continuously fly into the glass.  A made-for-television version of the movie called \"The Birds II: Land's End\" aired in 1994.\r\"The Birds\" was based on a short story written by Daphne du Maurier. \n"}, {"text": "One version was made in 1958, and a remake was viewed by audiences in 1988.  What 'creature feature film' originally starred Steve McQueen in his first starring role?", "correct": "The Blob", "options": ["The Bride of Frankenstein", "The Brain Eaters", "The Body Snatchers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blob.\n\n\t\"The Blob\" tells the tale of a gooey, acidic creature found in a meteorite that is found by a small town in the United States.  Soon after the discovery though, they realize that this thing has an insatiable appetite that not even a theater full of moviegoers, a doctor, a nurse, and a full diner can quell. A remake, starring Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith (Matt Dillon's brother and a star of the \"Saw\" films, respectively) failed in the box office.  An original sequel to the 1958 movie was released on TV.  This film, known as \"Beware! The Blob\" was released with a shoddy script (probably the reason they never used one in the first place).  Evidently, the only way to kill the blob is by freezing it- as shown in the films. If that doesn't make you think twice about global warming... \n"}, {"text": "What Canadian holiday horror film, created in 1974, was described as a pioneer in the slasher film genre?", "correct": "Black Christmas", "options": ["Bloody Valentine", "Birthday Burial", "Big Bad Birthday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack Christmas.\n\n\t\"Black Christmas\" is often regarded as a first in the horror industry, as it was one of the first 'slasher' films to be released - four years before the first \"Halloween\".  The movie is about a sorority house at Christmas time, that ends up receiving creepy calls from an unknown man that they don't know is living in their attic and periodically descending to make a kill. It isn't until all of the girls are dead that the main character, Jess, realizes that the killer is in the house with her.  The movie hit #87 on Bravo's list of Scariest Horror Moments, and in 2006 a remake was made.  \"Black Christmas\" isn't the only film to touch on the idea of horror at Christmas. Movies like \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\", \"Jack Frost\" and \"Gremlins\" have also done this. \n"}, {"text": "What New Zealand horror comedy, released in 2007, had the tagline \"Get the Flock out of Here\"?", "correct": "Black Sheep", "options": ["Braindead", "Bird Call", "Bad Taste"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack Sheep.\n\n\t\"Black Sheep\" (not the Chris Farley/David Spade sequel to \"Tommy Boy\") explored the theme of nature's wrath yet again- this time in New Zealand, known for its rather extensive sheep population.  In the movie, a man with an acute fear of sheep returns to his old family farm to discover that his brother has been experimenting on the animals. When two men release a mutant lamb from the farm, a plague is let loose amongst the sheep, turning them into rabid creatures with a lust for blood.  The lamb also bites one of the activists turning him into an odd were-sheep creature.  As a tagline explains: 'Beware the Violence of the Lambs'! \n"}, {"text": "What creatures are featured in the film \"Blood and Chocolate\" (2007)?", "correct": "Werewolves", "options": ["Vampires", "Zombies", "Confectionery store owners"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWerewolves.\n\n\tThe 2007 film \"Blood and Chocolate\" was based on a novel of the same name by Annette Curtis Klause.  Both followed the story of werewolves and humans in love and their incompatibility.  Unfortunately, the movie bombed, only raking in $2.1 million on the opening weekend and becoming one of the lowest-earning horror films of the year. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these best describes the Jennifer Tilly character known as Tiffany?", "correct": "Bride of Chucky", "options": ["Bride of the Living Dead", "Bride of Frankenstein", "Bride of Re-Animator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBride of Chucky.\n\n\tThe fourth entry in the \"Child's Play\" franchise, \"The Bride of Chucky\" is more comedic than the first four.  In the film, Chucky comes back to life (well, they all do in these franchises...) and he tracks down his old girlfriend, Tiffany.  She decides to hold him captive for leaving her, but while she is in the bath, he manages to escape, electrocute her to death, and place her soul into the body of a doll. The two make a ploy to lure two new humans to Chucky's grave to find a magical amulet that will allow them to trade bodies.  This film was followed by another installment, \"Seed of Chucky\". \n"}, {"text": "A femme fatale, an ice pick, and a famous interrogation scene are all featured in which 1992 Sharon Stone film?", "correct": "Basic Instinct", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBasic Instinct.\n\n\tSharon Stone stars as Catherine Tramell in this thriller about a novelist who develops passionate relationships with unsuspecting men, then lures them to their deaths.  Michael Douglas also stars in this film, as the detective on her case.  This film was generally well-received.  However, in 2005, a sequel known as \"Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction\" was released.  The film fared poorly and managed to 'win' Razzies for Worst Actress, Worst Screenplay, Worst Sequel, and Worst Movie of the Year. \n"}, {"text": "What 2005 Sam Raimi film starred Emily Deschanel and featured the tagline \"you thought it was just a story...\"?", "correct": "Boogeyman", "options": ["Bones", "Brothers Grimm", "Bless the Child"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoogeyman.\n\n\t\"Boogeyman\" showcases the story of a man who returns to his old farmhouse in order to repress his fears that were brought on when he witnessed his father get attacked by the boogeyman in his old bedroom.  Unfortunately, the boogeyman really is real, and he must face his fears to destroy it.  A sequel for the movie, \"Boogeyman 2\" was greenlit following the success of the film.\rProducer Sam Raimi was also the creator of the \"Evil Dead\" trilogy as well as the director of the \"Spiderman\" movies and the American remakes of \"The Grudge\". \n"}, {"text": "Which 1999 film followed a rather deadly collection of animals that terrorized a Texan town?", "correct": "Bats", "options": ["Birds", "Bones", "Beasts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBats.\n\n\t\"Bats\" starred Lou Diamond Philips and Dina Meyer in a rather obscure story about a Texan town terrorized by a rather bloodthirsty cave full of bats.  Another odd addition to the plot is the fact that the bats are genetically mutated, causing them to not only be bloodthirsty, but disgustingly large and malformed.  Panic ensues, the military arrives, and the protagonists have to delve into the cave to stop the bats once and for all.\rThe film grossed six million dollars, earning a profit in the end.  Reviews were relatively mixed. \n"}, {"text": "After its release in 1999, this independent horror film went on to become the most profitable film of the milennium.  What is its name?", "correct": "The Blair Witch Project & Blair Witch Project", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blair Witch Project & Blair Witch Project.\n\n\t\"The Blair Witch Project\" was a largely-hyped film released in July 1999.  It followed a group of film-making students as they travelled through a Maryland forest.  Little did they know though, that local legends were true and that the Blair Witch would be watching their every move.\rThe film became the most profitable film of all time, according to \"The Top 10 of Everything 2007\".  With a budget of a mere $35,000, the film grossed $248,600,000; a profit ratio of 7,104.65.  Because of its instant success, a sequel was created.  \"Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows\" was also hyped, and although it did turn a profit, it was not well-received by the critics and audience alike.  It was nominated for the Worst Picture Razzie in 2000, but 'lost' to the abysmal \"Battlefield Earth\". \n"}]}
