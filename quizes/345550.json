{"id": "345550", "name": "Stay Out of the Woods! Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Although later films in this series were set on a cruise ship, in space, and (for a brief time) in Manhattan, many would likely remember that the first film was set at Camp Crystal Lake.  What 1980 film would it be?", "correct": "Friday the 13th", "options": ["Camp Dead", "Lake of Blood", "Cabin in the Woods"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFriday the 13th.\n\n\tOne of the most profitable, well-known horror franchises of all-time, \"Friday the 13th\" was the first to feature the perhaps-ineffable Jason Voorhees, a man of no words who (gasp!) wasn't even the killer!  Although Voorhees appeared in name in the original \"Friday the 13th\", it was his mother, Pamela, who stalked co-ed teens in the woods around Camp Crystal Lake.\r Despite feeble attempts in later films to rename the lake and continuously reopen camps on its shores (seriously), very few would ever escape the wrath of Jason Voorhees, searching the area seeking vengeance for the death of his mother.  It's difficult to tell at which point in the series he died and became an inhuman zombie, but we love him all the same. \n"}, {"text": "Ash and Co. headed to the woods for a little relaxation and fun in what 1981 film, in which they just happened to summon up some demonic forces?", "correct": "The Evil Dead", "options": ["Eden Lake", "The Last House on the Left", "The Woods"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Evil Dead.\n\n\tCreated by Sam Raimi, \"The Evil Dead\" was a shocker upon its release.  Originally banned in several countries (including the UK) for a controversial scene involving a tree where it shouldn't be, \"The Evil Dead\" thrilled horror audiences and put Raimi's name on the map.  He would follow up with \"The Evil Dead 2\" and \"Army of Darkness\", both of which saw the return of cult star Bruce Campbell in the lead role as Ash.  Raimi took a break from horror until 2009 when he released \"Drag Me to Hell\".\r Oddly, in the second film of the trilogy, Ash returns to the cabin in the woods.  The entire first film was left aside in terms of continuity.  \"Army of Darkness\" picked up where the second film left off...back in time, of course.  The original continued to be a major genre film long into the future, even attaining a perfect 100% on the Rotten Tomatoes website. \n"}, {"text": "Another in a slew of camp-themed horror films, what 1983 slasher film ended with a gender-bending twist by the lakeside?", "correct": "Sleepaway Camp", "options": ["Trauma", "Camp Nowhere", "The Burning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSleepaway Camp.\n\n\t\"Sleepaway Camp\" was yet another cult classic after its 1983 release, not necessarily because it was a stellar slasher flick or an underground release, but because of its shocking twist ending in which one character is actually a completely different gender, revealing a frighteningly uncanny twist.\r \"Sleepaway Camp\" earned around $10,000,000 in the box office, modest for a 1980s slasher (at a time when they were all the rage), but its success generated \"Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers\", \"Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland\", \"Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor\", and \"Return to Sleepaway Camp\".  Of course, knowing the big twist put a damper on the plot for these films and they shifted from straight-up slasher-horror to horror-comedy overnight. \n"}, {"text": "All that most people remembered from this 1999 handheld camera film by Eduardo Sanchez was running, shaking, screaming, and a lot of trees.  What little 'independent film that could' was it?", "correct": "The Blair Witch Project", "options": ["Grave Encounters", "Paranormal Activity", "Quarantine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blair Witch Project.\n\n\t\"The Blair Witch Project\" was an odd phenomenon when it was first released.  Though some hated it, some proffered it as the scariest horror movie they'd ever seen.  It was too late to turn back once the theatrical rush began.  Until \"Paranormal Activity\" was released a decade later, \"The Blair Witch Project\" was the highest-grossing independent horror film of all-time.  It earned more in percentage profits than any other movie released to date.\r The film itself starred three independent actors with handheld cameras traveling around the forest while researching the Maryland legend of the Blair Witch.  Dubbed 'found footage' upon its unveiling at the Sundance Film Festival, it was very well-received by critics upon initial viewing, though it was one of the most parodied horror films of the decade.  Its sequel, \"Book of Shadows\", flopped. \n"}, {"text": "Although also a term for a psychological condition involving a sense of claustrophobia, this 2002 Eli Roth movie, set in a cabin in the woods, involved a flesh-eating disease.  What is the film's name?", "correct": "Cabin Fever", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCabin Fever.\n\n\t\"Cabin Fever\" was director Eli Roth's first film.  Loaded with a surprising amount of gore, it was no wonder he was relegated to the filmmakers known by the collective title 'The Splat Pack'.  With the support of Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth later wrote directed \"Hostel\" and then starred in Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\".\r \"Cabin Fever\", however, followed a group of five friends heading to an idyllic cabin on the lake.  A coincidental, diseased hobo happened to stop by looking for help but, in self-defense, they set him on fire and he drowned in the nearby lake, infecting the water.  Without knowing it, one-by-one, the group started to take on the symptoms themselves. \n"}, {"text": "Rob Schmidt's second feature film starred Eliza Dushku going head-to-head with backwoods rednecks.  The entire movie (released in 2003) was set in the woods.  What was the title?", "correct": "Wrong Turn", "options": ["Hidden", "House of Wax", "Scarce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWrong Turn.\n\n\t\"Wrong Turn\" was a modest hit in the box office, but after good sales in the DVD market, several sequels went straight-to-DVD, all of which were set (for the most part) in nature.  The second and third movies continued the backwoods setting while the fourth, a prequel titled \"Bloody Beginnings\", was partially set in a wintery forest.\r The original film placed Dushku into the lead role, forcing her and a group of friends against mutant rednecks who might has well have designed the woods themselves, considering how adept they are at navigating them.  The movie was released at the same time as other graphic 'mutant cannibal' films including \"The Hills Have Eyes\" remake (in 2006) and \"House of 1,000 Corpses\" (also in 2003).  Good guys, those mutant cannibals. \n"}, {"text": "Based on a Stephen King novel, what 2003 film, about four childhood friends on an annual trip to a forest cabin, featured aliens, Morgan Freeman and 'SSDD'?", "correct": "Dreamcatcher", "options": ["Gerald's Game", "Bag of Bones", "Black House"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDreamcatcher.\n\n\tWritten as a novel in 2001 after King's accident, then adapted and released as a film in 2003, \"Dreamcatcher\" was a notable King flop.  Despite a relatively high-profile cast (Morgan Freeman, Timothy Olyphant, Thomas Jane, etc.) it barely scraped by with profits, garnered low rating scores, and droned on for over two hours.\r The film followed four friends heading to a cabin in the woods (seems normal), bound together by a past in which they all received telepathic abilities from a mentally disabled boy nicknamed Duddits.  When an alien invasion, involving toothed worms, started to emerge, they became a bigger part in rescuing the planet from very a graphic death.  Oh, and there was a dreamcatcher in there too. \n"}, {"text": "What 2009 movie about the slasher 'Babyface' and a particular fictional movie was produced by Dark Castle and set in the woods?", "correct": "The Hills Run Red", "options": ["Possession", "Midnight Movie", "Whiteout"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hills Run Red.\n\n\tWritten by horror screenwriter David Schow (known for \"Masters of Horror\" scripts and \"The Crow\") \"The Hills Run Red\" was a surprisingly original movie in which one character, Tyler, sought the truth about a horror film thought to be so brutal, that no one knew where it went.  What he discovered (in a house in the woods-- *gasp*) was that the movie had a reputation because the director killed the actor playing the killer; he chopped him up with an axe!  Odd that he came back but, you know...\r \"The Hills Run Red\" never got a full theatrical release; it had a very minimal limited release before shuffling off to DVD in 2009.  This wasn't the first time for Dark Castle; they did it before with \"Return to House on Haunted Hill\", sending it straight-to-DVD on their Warner Premiere brand started in 2007 for that very purpose. \n"}, {"text": "First airing at the Slamdance Film Festival in 2010, what independent film, set in the seemingly endless woods of New Hampshire, trailed a research group looking for the remnants of an entire lost town?", "correct": "YellowBrickRoad", "options": ["Chop", "Husk", "Fertile Ground"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYellowBrickRoad.\n\n\t\"YellowBrickRoad\" was slightly anticipated by horror insiders, due to a unique psychological horror bent, but reviews were mixed upon the actual release.  After the showing at SlamDance, \"YellowBrickRoad\" was picked up for distribution by the internet horror site BloodyDisgusting and AMC Theaters for a joint deal known as 'Bloody Disgusting Selects...'  It was one of the first films on the label.  As such, it received midnight screenings midway through 2011 before dropping onto store shelves.\r In the film, a group of anthropologists and navigators headed into the woods near Friar, New Hampshire to figure out why a town up and left in the night, up a path called the 'YellowBrickRoad', and why less than one percent of them returned.  The bulk of the film remained in the woods and in clearings, though it was clear that the surroundings seemed to be closing in on the gang as they began to suffer what the townspeople must've begun to realize-- their own madness was catching up to them. \n"}, {"text": "Created by Vincent D'Onofrio and released in 2010, what aptly-titled horror film includes a teenage band attempting to practice their music with a killer on the loose in the forest?", "correct": "Don't Go Into the Woods", "options": ["Stay Out of the Forest", "Avoid the Tree People", "There are Demons in the Bushes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon't Go Into the Woods.\n\n\tAn actor in several dozen movies and a regular on \"Law and Order: Criminal Intent\" for many years, Vincent D'Onofrio had his hand in the horror genre as a writer and a director (for a second time) with \"Don't Go Into the Woods\".  The title gave away the basic premise of the film; a band practicing their songs headed to the forest, were followed by 'the girls', and then were chased down by 'the killer' and clearly had trouble doing what they came in to do.\r But then, you have to think, with the warning signs posted around, maybe they should've paid attention?\r \"Don't Go Into the Woods\" was very much an independent film.  Created on a micro-budget and starring a cast of unknowns, the movie went straight to 'on demand' sources after a very minimal festival showing in 2010.  Critics stated that you either liked the campiness and B-quality, or you hated it as a serious movie. \n"}]}
