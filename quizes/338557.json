When Will asks why, she says that a strain of monkey flu from Borneo has made its way to McKinley High School and that Principal Figgins has contracted it from one of the students.  As it turns out, Sue actually had Lauren Zises sneeze on him in the halls. As a result, Sue has been able to take the Principal position no thanks to a series of strong legal clauses and blackmail.  She decides that her first order of business will be to dissolve the Glee Club.  After she departs, Lauren sneezes on Mr. Schuester and he realizes that he's powerless to stop himself from getting sick. \n"}, {"text": "According to Terri, what movie makes Will feel better when he's sick?", "correct": "Singin' in the Rain", "options": ["It's a Wonderful Life", "Armageddon", "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSingin' in the Rain.\n\n\tWill struggles to fight the flu in Glee Club.  Before he can start to talk about gearing up for Sectionals, he finds himself running a fever and picturing the kids as young children.  He decides to see the school nurse and ends up at home in bed with a box of tissues...and Terri.  It turns out, Will's neighbour called Terri to help Will and now she's taking care of him.  Terri says that she still loves Will and that she's still good at taking care of him.  Will responds saying that she liked him when he was weak.  Then begins the baby talk.  Will asks her to leave and she tosses a copy of \"Singin' in the Rain\" at him saying that after sixteen years, she knows what makes him feel better.\rIn the cafeteria, Mercedes and Kurt discuss Rachel's taking over the club in Will's absence.  It turns out that she wants everyone's opinions on the solos she claims she'll be singing at Sectionals.  This does not go well.  Merecedes and Kurt also discuss Kurt and Blaine's prospective date before she makes a beeline for some fresh food.

In Spanish, the kids have fun with her.  Kurt speaks with her in the hall and she wonders why he decided to ask her.  It turns out she subbed for his English class the previous week and performed \"Conjunction Junction\" for the students.  Holly is thrilled to help out.\rWhen she arrives in the choir room, puck has buttered the floor to make the substitute slip, but she's too smart for that.  She slides along it and greets the students.  Some of the kids try to use fake names, but it doesn't go too far; she knows their names having seen their Regionals video.  She explains that they likely lost because their songs were too old.  Holly suggests that they sing their favourite songs.  Rachel suggest they not joke around and Holly realizes that they don't get asked for their opinion too often.  Puck suggests Cee-Lo Green and she goes with it.

Beiste rebuts with the fact that the Cheerios will have no one to cheer for if the team is gone and Sue is forced to rethink her plan to take down the coach.  When she decides that she needs to find a new cause, she selects the school's problem with overeating.  Her target: potato tots.  She has Becky enact this immediately.\rWill heads to the auditorium and starts to perform \"Make 'Em Laugh\" with Mike in a song and dance.  This turns out to be a dream in Will's flu-altered state.

She spotted the two of them watching \"Animal Hoarders\" in the principal's office.\rIn the cafeteria, all of the tater tots are tossed into the trash by the Cheerios.  Mercedes is angry with this and goes to Sue to complain.  Sue explains that nutrition is abysmal at the school.  While Sue is declaring war against junk food, Mercedes will be declaring a war to get her tots back.\rIn the halls, Holly speaks to Rachel about her inability to relax a bit.  Holly suggests that Rachel let go a bit and do a song she wants to do because she does have good ideas.

When Terri brings out some vapo-rub to help with his cold, she takes the time to seduce him and he gives in.\rMercedes talks to Kurt about the disgusting food that Principal Sue is serving up, most of which is fake and supposedly healthy.  Kurt informs her that he's already helped her feel good about herself by setting her up on a date with a guy at the school.  She gets frustrated that Kurt even considered it and begins her tot wars by starting a rally in the cafeteria.\rIn the auditorium, Rachel and Holly performed Rachel's choice song: \"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\" from \"Chicago\".  She's thrilled that her idea was finally considered and put into action. \n"}, {"text": "When he's better, Will enters the choir room to find which of these occurring?", "correct": "The walls being painted", "options": ["The piano being retuned", "The floor flooding", "The kids singing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe walls being painted.\n\n\tWill returns to the school still ill and he runs into Sue who says he has no reason to be there- the kids now like the substitute more and she'd rather not have him back (mostly it's the hair, she claims).  Will says that he can't wait for the day when Figgins is back, but Sue has that covered too.  Since her nutritious lunches have been a hit with parents, Figgins has been fired and she's been offered the Principal job.  In her first act in the role, she will be firing Will.\rAt Breadstix, Blaine, Kurt, and Mercedes talk about gay marriage (even though Mercedes acts more like a third wheel).  No matter what she does, they keep talking about subjects she's not interested in.\rIn the choir room, Will meets Holly for the first time while she's painting the choir room a sunny yellow.  Will talks about a bit of restraint, but Holly says that the kids need people to care about them and they need a voice.  Will is confused with her teaching tactics but it's too late anyways.

While Merecedes is informed that Sue and her lawyer, Gloria Allred, will be speaking to her about the charges against her, Holly is told by Sue that she's not doing her job to restrain the kids and that she has no idea what she's doing.\rHolly speaks to Will at his apartment about the kids and teaching.  Holly breaks down because although the kids love her, she can't discipline and she's not mature when things get serious.  It all spurned from a girl named Cameo who punched her in the face.  Since then, she's tried to take a more lax approach to teaching. \n"}, {"text": "Will and Terri decide to get back together.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWill continues to talk with Holly who says that her mellow lifestyle isn't going to work for a permanent teaching job.  She's decided to quit.  When she says this, Terri comes into the apartment with soup for Will and, angrily, criticizes both Will and Holly.  Will says that she has no business being angry because they're divorced.  He also says that the previous night was a mistake and that he apologizes.  Terri apologizes as well and says she'll come back.  Will tells her not to and she says he'll regret it.\rMercedes shows Kurt that she sneaked a container of tots into the school.

As a condition, the Glee kids have to restore the Le Car.\rThe kids welcome back Will with open arms and they decide to get right back to Sectionals planning.  When Will tries to introduce the kids to \"Singin' in the Rain\", he realizes that they're not really into a song from the 1950s.  He finds Holly, still substitute teaching at the school (dressed as Mary Todd Lincoln for a history class) and asks that she join in for their next song.  Her idea is to make it a bit more modern.\rIn the school's auditorium, Will and Holly lead the kids through a water-soaked rendition of \"Singin' in the Rain\" mashed-up with Rihanna's \"Umbrella\" to close the episode and Holly is invited back as substitute teacher for the club when Will needs time off. \n"}]}
