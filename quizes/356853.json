{"id": "356853", "name": "\"Madness Ends\" Trivia Game | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Asylum"], "questions": [{"text": "Who cut off Leo's arm in present day Briarcliff?", "correct": "Johnny", "options": ["Jude", "Lana", "Dr. Thredson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny.\n\n\tIn the decrepit remains of Briarcliff, Johnny wandered, listening to the audio book of Lana's \"Tales of Briarcliff\".  After seeing a vision of his mother in the hydrotherapy room, he had another of his father ascending Jude's 'stairway to heaven' claiming that he would always love him.  This was moments before newlyweds Leo and Teresa entered the building. While the two of them ran off to explore the asylum, Johnny closed himself into a room at the end of a hallway.  The two followed behind, hoping to investigate a freaky event.  When Leo stuck his hand into a slot in the door, however, Johnny pulled out a machete, cutting off the arm and leaving Leo to bleed out. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Lana's partner in the present day?", "correct": "Marion", "options": ["Wendy", "Kim", "Tracey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarion.\n\n\tFour months later, a film crew arrives at the apartment of Lana Winters and her partner, Marion.  A reporter asks Lana about the pictures on her wall and her illustrious career as a reporter, journalist, and ten-time bestselling author before Marion comes in with a glass of wine for everyone.  Marion departs shortly after-- she has rehearsal.  She reminds Lana that they have a dinner with the Sondheims that evening.\rImmediately after, the crew finishes setting up their equipment.  They raise the lights as per Lana's request.  Since this is a Kennedy Center Honor, the interviewer, April, says that she'll ask a wide array of questions beginning with the infamous Bloodyface Saga.  Lana refuses outright; Bloodyface is a household name now and he was an evil man.  Nothing more to say.  They decide to start with the Briarcliff expos\u00e9. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Lana's investigative television series?", "correct": "America Unmasked", "options": ["Winters Cold Cases", "Digging for Truth", "Eye on News"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerica Unmasked.\n\n\tLana's story began at Briarcliff in 1971.  Bringing her two man crew into the death chute, she planned on putting America into the asylum to bring it down.  April says that she was put into such high esteem for her actions and Lana can't argue that she perpetuated the myth about herself.  She did it out of ambition.  And she had a hook, for sure.  The point, she tells April, was to locate Judy Martin, who was committed there after she ran the institution.  What she found, however, was more.\rPanning through the halls of the building, Lana and her crew documented the worsened conditions of Briarcliff, even talking to an orderly about the lacking quality of care.\rLana tells April that she imagined asking to see Sister Jude in her cell.  Arriving, she found her mad, and grateful, even remembering the playful 'Lana Banana' name.  But that never happened.  When Lana reached the room she discovered that Jude was no longer at Briarcliff.\rLana takes a five minute break from filming and asks for a sparkling water.  A crew member hands her one; the crew member is Johnny. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Lana find Betty Drake's information?", "correct": "In the administrator's office", "options": ["In a local library", "In her cell", "On the internet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the administrator's office.\n\n\tIn the 1970s, Lana (and her crew) stopped by Kit's house for a talk.  Having shut down Briarcliff she wanted to film their reunion and ask a few questions about a certain Betty Drake.  Lana located papers in the Briarcliff administrator's office (formerly the office of Sister Jude and the Monsignor) describing Betty Drake, a woman released into the care of Kit Walker a few months after they spoke with one another at her book signing for \"Maniac\" a few years earlier.  Kit admitted to it.\rUnable to lead everyone out of Briarcliff, he committed to being with her.  After Alma died, he started visiting Jude weekly because she never belonged there.  There was still life in her.  There weren't many questions; he was, for the most part, allowed to bring her along.  After everything, he brought her home-- he said he did it for the kids.  He had to leave Briarcliff behind by finding someone or something to forgive. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Julia and Thomas take Jude before she 'got better'?", "correct": "Into the forest", "options": ["Back to Briarcliff", "To the doctor", "'A magical place'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInto the forest.\n\n\tJude started her stay in the Walker household with detox, taking her off the asylum's drugs.  Although things got better when they stayed the course and Jude did become a loved one to the kids, things did get worse.  Having delusions that she was back in Briarcliff one night, she lashed out at the family.  She stopped, however, when Kit's children, Julia and Thomas, grabbed her by the hands and led her out into the night.  Kit told Lana that they walked out into the woods together and when they came back, something was different.  Grace was right-- the kids were special.\rFor several months, Jude was a happy member of the family.  After half a year raising the children, her health was on the decline. \n"}, {"text": "When Jude, in her final moments, said that \"she's here for me\", did Kit know who she was referring to?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn her final days, Jude remained in bed; the kids wouldn't leave her side.  Knowing her time was coming to an end, Jude told Julia never to let a man tell her who she would be or make her feel less than he is; a woman could do anything they want.  Thomas, she told, should not pick his nose and he shouldn't pick a job for money; he should find something he loves.  When Kit came in with a meal, she refused since she wouldn't need it.  He sent the kids out and spent the last moments with her, alone.  Jude said that she was not alone, but Kit never knew who she was talking about with her last words.  Lana claimed that she knew.\rIn her last breaths, fading into the darkness, Jude received her final kiss from the Archangel of Death.  This time, she was ready. \n"}, {"text": "Who killed Cardinal Howard?", "correct": "None of these; he killed himself", "options": ["Lana", "Jude", "Kit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these; he killed himself.\n\n\tLana says that, odds are, the next questions are going to be much rougher to handle.  April agrees-- they need to talk about her next expos\u00e9 in New York.  Lana says that almost everyone was angry with her.  After weeks of being avoided, Lana cornered Cardinal Howard on his way to Easter mass and confronted him about Dr. Arden's human experiments at Briarcliff.  The evidence would be explored on her next special.  He sped off without answering a single question.\rApril says that Lana was blamed for what happened to Timothy Howard; he was found dead, having slit his wrists in his bathtub.  Lana explains that his guilty conscience was the only one responsible.  He lied to himself about being a liar; he was so corrupt and deluded that he believed in his own lies until he confronted himself. \n"}, {"text": "Did Lana ever meet Johnny when he was a child?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tLana tells April that lies are like scars on your soul; they destroy you.  She then shares the truth about a lie she told for over forty years.  In \"Maniac\", Lana wrote about the poetic justice of having an abortion on the baby she was impregnated with during rape.  That child, however, is alive.\rAfter the birth, when the nurse asked her to breastfeed the child, she refused to do it again.  She couldn't muster up the strength to raise the baby.  In the 1970s, however, feeling remorse, she made an attempt to track down the boy and it led her to his school.  Finding him getting bullied, she stood up for him and helped him up.  She stroked his face with her gloved hand, but he left soon after.  That was the last time she saw him.  She wasn't really his mother at that point.  She wondered where he was and how he turned out afterwards and she never had another child. \n"}, {"text": "In his last year, Kit suffered from which of these?", "correct": "Pancreatic cancer", "options": ["Arthritis", "Heart attacks", "Post-traumatic stress disorder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPancreatic cancer.\n\n\tDespite never having a child herself, Lana did act as godmother to Kit's two children.  Kit remarried and the family loved the new wife, Alison.  Kit always believed the kids were destined for great things, like Grace said; Thomas became a Harvard law professor and Julia became a leading neurosurgeon and Thomas-Hopkins.  Kit developed pancreatic cancer at 40.  In his last months he was a peaceful man.  Everyone was shocked when he disappeared.  No one knew where he went.  No note, no tracks, no clues; just an empty wheelchair.  No funeral either; his kids said there was no reason to mourn.  April thanks Lana for the interview as the crew files out.\rAs Lana cleans up and shuts the doors behind them, she heads to the bar and pours two drinks, one for herself and the other for the one who stayed behind.  Johnny emerges from his hiding spot and Lana says it's time to get things over with. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of the episode, who is the only former Briarcliff denizen still alive?", "correct": "Lana & Lana Winters", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLana & Lana Winters.\n\n\tLana and Johnny each have a drink and she says that this is exactly how she pictured it; in fact, she could never mistake her baby boy.  She doesn't tell him that the police came by asking questions and showing pictures.  After all, he'd killed the owners of Dr. Thredson's house and resided there in the meantime.  Lana asks how he realized who he was and he says that he felt something when she visited him on the playground.  He figured it out when he saw her on TV... then he heard the confession tape on eBay.  From this, he realized that his father loved him and she never did.  She says that neither did; neither could.\rJohnny moves in close and pulls a gun, placing it to her head.  She asks what he really wants and Johnny admits-- he just wants his father to be proud of him and he can't measure up.  Lana says that Oliver was a monster, and that's not him; he can never be like him.  Holding his hand, Lana says that he's just a sweet, little boy-- better than his father.  Slowly taking the gun from his hand, she strokes his cheek and says that she's a part of him too.\rHe says that he's hurt people and she says it's not his fault.  It's hers.  She takes the gun and shoots him in the head.\r In 1964, Lana spoke to Sister Jude about having an interview with Bloodyface.  Lana says she's ambitious but Jude says that she needs to know what she's in for since Briarcliff is already in her rearview mirror: loneliness, heartbreak, sacrifice.  Lana says that Jude has no idea what she's capable of.  Jude responds that Lana Banana will look in the face of evil and evil's going to look right back at her. \n"}]}
