So it's no surprise that I can't help but smile when a song plays on the radio, and they sing about video games.\"\n\"I know what you mean, Salami.  It perks your ears right up to hear that.\"\n\"Yeah, and you know, one of my favorites is when Cee-Lo Green sings about video games.\"\n\nWhich Cee-Lo Green song contains the lyrics \"I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more Atari\"?", "correct": "Forget You", "options": ["Crazy", "It's OK", "Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForget You.\n\n\tCee-Lo Green was born as Thomas DeCarlo Callaway in 1974.  His song \"Forget You\" was released in 2010 on the album \"The Lady Killer\".\r In the line \"I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more Atari\", Cee-Lo is comparing himself to another man his old girlfriend is now with.  He says he cannot afford a Ferrari like this guy can, and he's old-school like Atari, and not like this new guy, the Xbox. \n"}, {"text": "\"I think some of my favourite examples of video games in music,\" Kyle began, \"are the suave lines in 'The Dynamo of Volition'.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Salami asked.  \"I don't think I know that one.\"\n\nWhich artist sang the lyrics \"'Kid Icarus' on the transistor, Nintendo been givin' me the blisters\"?", "correct": "Jason Mraz", "options": ["Owl City", "James Blunt", "Flobots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJason Mraz.\n\n\tMr. A to Z, Jason Mraz's \"The Dynamo of Volition\" appeared on his third studio album, \"We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.\" in 2008.  Although it never released as a single, the album was quite popular, becoming Mraz's top-selling CD to date.  Overall it hit a peak of number three on the Billboard 200 while songs like \"I'm Yours\" and \"Lucky\" (featuring Colbie Caillat) became popular.  The former song actually broke Billboard records for its tenure on the Billboard Hot 100 (spending over seventy weeks on the chart).  It also appeared on four other Billboard charts, hitting the top position on three of them, and it showed on two year-end Billboard charts going five times platinum in the States alone.\r \"Kid Icarus\", a relatively older game first showing on the NES console back in the late 1980s, was notable for its intense platforming and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games on the console.  Nintendo has had its fair share of blister injuries though; Kyle felt them in the original \"Mario Party\" (word of warning). \n"}, {"text": "\"Everybody has at least heard of Mario, haven't they Kyle?\"\n\"Most likely.  That is one of those characters people immediately think of when you say 'video games'.\"\n\"That's true, Kyle.  And when they listen to Far East Movement, they know exactly who Mario is.\"\n\nWhich Far East Movement song contains the lyrics \"Go on the next level, Super Mario\"?", "correct": "Rocketeer", "options": ["Like a G6", "If I Was You (OMG)", "Girls on the Dancefloor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRocketeer.\n\n\tFar East Movement released \"Rocketeer\", as well as the other three answer choices in 2010 in the US, and in 2011 in Japan.  The album was \"Free Wired\".  Far East Movement is a Korean band that formed in 2003 in California.\r Mario first appeared in 1981 as 'Jumpman', the protagonist in \"Donkey Kong\".  In 1983, he appeared in his own \"Mario\" game, \"Mario Bros.\"  \"Super Mario Bros.\", the game referred to in \"Rocketeer\", was released in 1985. \n"}, {"text": "\"Remember 'Barbie Girl'?\" Kyle asked\n\"I try not to,\" Salami replied.\n\"Well that's fine, but Aqua, the band that released the song, also mentioned video games in another of their lesser-known singles.\"\n\nWhich of these Aqua singles mentioned the Commodore 64 console in its lyrics?", "correct": "Back to the '80s", "options": ["Turn Back Time", "Cartoon Heroes", "My Oh My"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBack to the '80s.\n\n\tA song listing (possibly) too many different events and items from the 1980s, \"Back to the '80s\" showed up on Aqua's 2009 \"Greatest Hits\" album.  Their first single in eight years, it showed up on the charts in Europe (peaking at number one in Denmark, their home country).  Aqua, of course, is known for \"Barbie Girl\" amongst several other earworm songs from the late '90s.\rAlong with mentioning a time \"back when the coolest thing in store was a Commodore 64\", the song also alluded to \"Rocky\", Huey Lewis and the News, Cherry Coke, and \"Miami Vice\" amongst several more things.\r The Commodore 64, of course, was an early home console for video games.  Released in 1982, it was a very popular piece of equipment...at least until Nintendo made its move. \n"}, {"text": "\"Well, this song is a bit more well-known than that one, Kyle.  The song doesn't mention the Commodore 64, but the Nintendo 64.  Do you know which song it is, Kyle?\"\n\"You know, Salami, there are thousands of songs out there.  You can't expect me to know exactly which one you are thinking of.\"\n\"True, true.  Well, it's a Bruno Mars song, which, as you might know, is my favorite artist.  It's called 'Nothin' On You'.\"\n\"Well, now I know what you're talking about.\"\n\nWhich rapper sings alongside Bruno Mars when he mentions a Nintendo 64?", "correct": "B.o.B.", "options": ["Nicki Minaj", "Lil Wayne", "Taio Cruz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nB.o.B.\n\n\t\"Nothin' On You\" was the debut single for B.o.B, and it featured Bruno Mars.  The song was released in 2010, and was on B.o.B.'s album \"B.o.B. Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray\".\r The Nintendo 64, often simply called the N64, was first released in 1996.  It was Nintendo's third console, and was very popular in its time. \n"}, {"text": "\"Let's move on to the PC.\" Kyle decided to sway the topic.\n\"Where will we go?\" Salami inquired.\n\"Well, considering its massive popularity, how about we touch on \"Warcraft\"?\n\n\"Vi sitter h\u00e4r i venten och spelar lite 'DotA'.\"  These lyrics come from what Swedish Eurodance performer?", "correct": "Basshunter", "options": ["Tiesto", "Armin van Buuren", "ATB"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBasshunter.\n\n\tFound as the first track on Bsshunter's first album, \"LOL (^^,)\", \"DotA\" is best known by its full name \"Vi sitter h\u00e4r i venten och spelar lite 'DotA'\", a title which translates to \"We're sitting in Ventrilo, playing DotA\".  Because of the song's popularity in the dance music world (particularly in Scandinavia), it also appeared on Basshunter's second album, \"Now You're Gone\", in 2008.  The song charted well in most of Northern Europe upon its release in 2006.\r \"DotA\" refers to a modified version of the \"Warcraft 3\" computer game known as \"Defense of the Ancients\".  Released in 2003, the game achieved a near-cult status and became very popular in online gaming circles.  \"Ventrilo\" happens to be an online chatting program popular with internet gamers. \n"}, {"text": "\"You know, Kyle, even country music likes to sing about video games every now and again.\"\n\"Right, you'll find video games in most any genre,\" Kyle agreed.\n\"Perhaps one of my favorite country songs is by Mark Wills.  He mentions video games in one of his songs.\"\n\nWhich Mark Wills song contains these lyrics: \"I saw 'Star Wars' at least eight times, had the 'Pac-Man' pattern memorized\"?", "correct": "19 Somethin'", "options": ["Don't Laugh at Me", "Back at One", "And the Crowd Goes Wild"], "explanation": "\n\n\n19 Somethin'.\n\n\t\"19 Somethin'\" was released in 2002 on Mark Wills' album \"Greatest Hits\".  The \"Greatest Hits\" album contained nine of his most popular songs, as well as two brand new songs, \"19 Somethin'\" being one of them.  In 2003, \"19 Somethin'\" spent six weeks at the top of the Hot Country Charts, and even was named second place of the song of the decade on Billboard Hot Country Charts! \n"}, {"text": "\"Let's take a look at rap,\" Kyle suggested.\nSalami waited for Kyle to continue...it didn't seem that he was done.\n\"I guess we could move on to Eminem- he mentions one particular video game company.\"\n\nIn which 2010 Eminem song (feat. Rihanna) does he mention that \"life is no Nintendo game\"?", "correct": "Love the Way You Lie", "options": ["Not Afraid", "Crack a Bottle", "Lose Yourself"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLove the Way You Lie.\n\n\tA major hit for the Real Slim Shady, \"Love the Way You Lie\" was the second single off Eminem's seventh major album, \"Recovery\".  It hit its stride in late 2010 becoming one of his hits.  With Rihanna singing the chorus, Eminem rapped during the verses.  \"Love the Way You Lie\" went platinum in several countries, topped the Billboard Hot 100, and placed seventh on Billboard's overall list in 2010.  It was the UK's top-selling song of the year as well.\r The lyric makes note of the fact that you don't get as many chances as allowed in your typical video game.  Nintendo, of course, is one of the big console developers and game-makers.  They're known for Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong and a number of major names. \n"}, {"text": "\"Kyle, video games haven't always been around,\" Salami began.\n\"Of course they haven't.  Before video games, people were actually active in their average lives!\"\n\"And that's exactly the point of this song.  Back in the day, it was definitely a different world, which happens to be the title of a song that mentions video games,\" Salami finished.\n\nWhich singer, who got his start on the fifth season of \"American Idol\", sang the song that contains these lyrics: \"Had three TV channels you got up to change.  No video games and no satellite\"?", "correct": "Bucky Covington", "options": ["Taylor Hicks", "Elliot Yamin", "Chris Daughtry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBucky Covington.\n\n\tBucky Covington appeared on the fifth season of \"American Idol\" and placed eighth.  That same season, Chris Daughtry placed fourth, Elliot Yamin placed third, and Taylor Hicks won.\r Covington's song \"A Different World\" was released on his self-titled album in 2006 and released for radio in early 2007.\r Of course, the song refers to a time back when Covington was a kid, before video games, back when kids spent time outside to have fun. \n"}, {"text": "\"Time to keep to some alternative rock roots,\" Kyle insisted.\nSalami replied.  \"What do you suggest?\"\n\"What about some early Kaiser Chiefs?\"\n\nIn 2004, the UK band Kaiser Chiefs released their first single containing the line \"I'll come back stronger than a powered-up Pac-Man\".  What was the song?", "correct": "Oh My God", "options": ["I Predict a Riot", "Modern Way", "Na Na Na Na Naa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOh My God.\n\n\tAppearing on the band's first album, \"Employment\", \"Oh My God\" was never really their biggest hit but it's certainly a catchy tune.  As upbeat as most of their songs, \"Oh My God\" hit number six on the UK Singles Chart.  Their next album, \"Yours Truly, Angry Mob\", would prove to be more popular in America and the UK with the single \"Ruby\" appearing on the Billboard Hot 100 in the number fourteen spot (and topping the UK Singles Chart).  \"Oh My God\" was later covered by Marc Ronson and Lily Allen in 2007.\r The line \"I'll come back stronger than a powered-up Pac-Man\" of course refers to the titular character from the game \"Pac-Man\".  Upon eating a Power Pellet, the character would turn temporarily invincible and gain the ability to eat ghosts. \n"}]}
