{"id": "245632", "name": "Top Movies of 1982 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1980s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Director Ridley Scott brought film noir into the modern age with his technically brilliant and intellectually captivating 1982 film 'Blade Runner'.  Which of these actors did *not* appear in this groundbreaking movie of the early 80s?", "correct": "Sean Connery", "options": ["Sean Young", "Harrison Ford", "Rutger Hauer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Connery.\n\n\tAlong with Ford, Hauer and Young, appearances from Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah help provide the acting power behind this masterpiece of a sci-fi film.  Based on the book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' by Philip K. Dick, this is arguably Ridley Scott's greatest achievement.  If you haven't seen the film, I strongly advise you watch the Director's Cut over the theaterical version. \n"}, {"text": "In this 1982 film, one enlightened man leads an entire nation to political freedom through the use of non-violent means.  What brilliant biopic, directed by Richard Attenborough, is described here?", "correct": "Gandhi & Ghandi", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGandhi & Ghandi.\n\n\tGandhi (the correct spelling), is considered to be the father of modern India.  The 1982 film of the same name pays tribute to his greatness.  Richard Attenborough's epic is sweeping, resembling some of the best films by fellow British director David Lean.  The highlight of this movie, however, is the absolutely entrancing performance by Ben Kingsley, who simply becomes Mahatma Gandhi in the film.  His Best Actor Oscar was well deserved. \n"}, {"text": "Depending on the version you select, 'Fanny and Alexander' may be 188 minutes long or 312 minutes long.  With either version you select, you will be able to witness a stunning film, replete with very memorable scenes and fine acting.  'Fanny and Alexander' is the cinematic swan song of what pre-eminent Swedish filmmaker?", "correct": "Ingmar Bergman", "options": ["Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m", "Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m", "Lukas Moodysson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIngmar Bergman.\n\n\tIt's hard to fully describe what 'Fanny and Alexander' is, but suffice to say it follows the up-and-down lives of a Swedish family that may very well reflect the childhood memories of Bergman himself.  The film won Oscars for Best Foreign Film and Best Cinematography (for Sven Nykvist), and two other categories to boot.  It's definitely worth your time to investigate. \n"}, {"text": "'Fitzcarraldo' is a film that *must* be seen to be believed.  In it, director Werner Herzog literally oversees the moving of a very large steamer boat over a small mountain.  What long-time acting collaborator of Herzog's appears in title role of this extraordinary film?", "correct": "Klaus Kinski", "options": ["Fritz Feld", "Paul Verhoeven", "Bruno Ganz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlaus Kinski.\n\n\tKlaus Kinski, who had worked with Herzog before in such films as 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' (1972) and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' (1979), once again was enlisted to play the lead character in this Herzog adventure.  Though Herzog and Kinski had conflict in the past, including an incident during the shooting of 'Aguirre' wherein Herzog apparently aimed a loaded gun at his acting companion, there is no doubt that this film would not have been the same without their collaboration.  Kinski is a mad genius, and so is the character Fitzcarraldo.  Don't miss this one! \n"}, {"text": "Touching and heartbreaking, 1982's 'Sophie's Choice' is certainly one of director Alan J. Pakula's best cinematic triumphs.  However, the true magic in this film is produced by the actress who plays the title character Sophie.  What actress won a Best Actress Oscar for her splendid performance in this movie?", "correct": "Meryl Streep", "options": ["Geena Davis", "Jessica Lange", "Glenn Close"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeryl Streep.\n\n\tThough Meryl Streep is noted for her ability to simulate accents, enabling her to create a perfect Polish accent for this film, this is not what sets her apart.  It's simply her ability to absorb herself into a character and make the audience relate and understand her on both a rational and emotional level that makes her special.  Though she has been great in an array of excellent films, this may be her most unique performance.  Oh yeah, and Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol aren't bad either! \n"}, {"text": "In what 1982 film does Paul Newman play a down and out Boston lawyer who is suddenly given a seemingly open-and-shut court case involving medical malpractice?", "correct": "The Verdict", "options": ["The Star Chamber", "The Trial", "The Client"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Verdict.\n\n\tPaul Newman provided one of his most impactful performances in this gut wrenching courtroom drama, but alas he was up against Ben Kingsley ('Gandhi') and Dustin Hoffman ('Tootsie') that year.  Sidney Lumet does yet another fine job directing this film that also features James Mason, Jack Warden and Charlotte Rampling.  I highly recommend it. \n"}, {"text": "Directed by Costa-Gavras, the chilling 1982 film 'Missing' is based on a true life incident involving an American journalist who went missing in the aftermath of a bloody 1973 coup that occurred in what South American country?", "correct": "Chile", "options": ["Ecuador", "Brazil", "Venezuela"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChile.\n\n\tJack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek are excellent in their roles as the father and wife of the missing American journalist.  Greek-born director Costa-Gavras, known for political thrillers such as 'Z' and 'State of Siege', creates just the right level of suspense to leave the audience on edge from beginning to end. \n"}, {"text": "Selected by the American Film Institute as their number two American comedy film of all-time, 'Tootsie' certainly has become a film classic.  In it, serious actor Dustin Hoffman is unexpectedly hilarious in the lead role as struggling actor Michael Dorsey.  Which of these actresses does not appear alongside Hoffman in this entertaining and absorbing romp?", "correct": "Lily Tomlin", "options": ["Jessica Lange", "Geena Davis", "Teri Garr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLily Tomlin.\n\n\tAlong with Hoffman, Lange, Garr and Davis, a marvelous array of great actors also appear, including Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, George Gaynes, Bill Murray and even Sydney Pollack, who managed to direct all of this acting talent.  Even Andy Warhol makes a cameo appearance in this laugh-inducing comedy with a heart. \n"}, {"text": "In terms of groundbreaking 1982 films, none may have been more impactful on the future of cinema than 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.  Not only did it usher in a new trend of comedy/drama films aimed at teens, it also launched the film careers of several Hollywood heavy hitters.  What future Oscar-winner steals the show in this clever coming-of-age comedy?", "correct": "Sean Penn", "options": ["Holly Hunter", "Jennifer Connelly", "Jamie Foxx"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Penn.\n\n\tNo fewer than three Best Actor Oscar winners appear in 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', namely Sean Penn, Forest Whitaker and Nicolas Cage.  In addition to them, fine thespians such as Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judge Reinhold, Ray Walston, Eric Stoltz, Anthony Edwards and Phoebe Cates also grace the screen.  Amy Heckerling directs this honest look at American youth culture of the early 80s. \n"}, {"text": "Let's end this quiz on a scary note.  Imagine, if you will, being trapped in a small research station on the vast Antarctic ice with a small crew of men, any one of them potentially having been transformed into a hideous space alien.  This is the plot in a nutshell of what memorable 1982 horror/sci-fi extravaganza?", "correct": "The Thing", "options": ["The Fog", "The Hidden", "Alien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Thing.\n\n\t'The Thing' is certainly one of the scariest films of the 1980s, but what sets it apart from other horror films of that era is that it's really well made.  Director John Carpenter is careful not to let the special effects overwhelm the underlying theme of the film, which can be summarized in the question 'Who can you trust?'  Kurt Russell, known for his work in action movies, gives his most convincing performance (imho) in this excellent movie.\r Thank you for playing this quiz.  Please feel free to notify me about your favorites from 1982.  I'd love to compare notes! \n"}]}
