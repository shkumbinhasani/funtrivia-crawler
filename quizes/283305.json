Miike has directed numerous films in plenty of genres, but his horror films tend to break the boundaries and leave audiences with a pit in their stomach. In his prior work in the genre, \"Ichi the Killer\", the title character graphically cuts off his own tongue. The work before that, \"Audition\", was a film about obsession, and depicted lengthy torture scenes. Miike also directed the original \"One Missed Call\" (known in Japan as \"Chakushin Ari\") which was re-released (but Americanized) in January 2008.\r\"Imprint\" follows the same vein as \"Audition\" in which a North American journalist returns to Japan to rescue a prostitute from a life of torture. When he arrives, it's too late, and a woman he finds recounts the bloody details (twice).\rMiike only made one episode of the anthology series. \"Jenifer\" and \"Pelts\" were created by Giallo Horror producer Dario Argento while \"The Damned Thing\", based on a short story by Richard Christian Matheson, was helmed by Tobe Hooper, who originally directed \"Poltergeist\" with Steven Spielberg (and first season episode \"Dance of the Dead\").\r Thanks to Kyleisalive for this question! \n"}, {"text": "B is for Budweiser: The Budweiser Wagon is pulled by eight magnificent horses.
