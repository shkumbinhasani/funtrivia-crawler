Tate encounters Thaddeus in the darkness, but is helped by Nora, who tells him to go away.  Nora tells Tate that if Thaddeus comes back to get him, all he needs to do is shut his eyes and say \"go away\".  She says she'll protect him-- life is too short for so much sorrow.\rIn the present time, Tate finds Nora weeping in the basement.  He walks in and she doesn't remember him.  He tells her that life is too short for so much sorrow, but she says it's an eternity.  She remembers a promise Tate made about Vivian's baby, but Tate says he can't do it since he loves Violet.  Nora says the baby is hers and if she needs to take it, she will. \n"}, {"text": "Which ghosts decide to construct a nursery?", "correct": "Chad and Patrick", "options": ["Hayden and Travis", "Tate and Violet", "Nora and Charles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChad and Patrick.\n\n\tBen tries to drag Violet out of the house by the arm but she doesn't want to go.  She claims that she feels sick and she doesn't want to go outside, but he says that she needs to see her mother in the hospital and that when they come back, they're moving out.  He also doesn't trust Tate.  When Violet gets into the car, she lies down in the back.  Ben doesn't notice her disappearing when he pulls out of the driveway; she ends up in her bedroom window and realizes that if her parents find out that she killed herself, they'll go mad.\rViolet realizes that as time goes by, they'll fall out of touch with the ways of the world and become trapped in the windowless cell that is the house.  That's when they hear something in the other room-- it's Chad and Patrick painting a nursery for what they believe will inevitably be their babies. \n"}, {"text": "Constance reveals to Patrick that one of Vivian's babies is her grandchild.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tViolet and Tate step into the new nursery to find Chad and Patrick painting.  They say that their surrogate is Vivian but Violet says they're leaving as soon as they get back and heading to Florida.  Chad is hesitant to accept this; since Violet can't leave the house, odds are they'll end up staying around.\rViolet calls Constance over and asks her to speak to Chad and Patrick upstairs.  She also asks if she can have a talk with Billie Dean, the psychic, in regards to an exorcism.  Constance says that she'll take care of it.  When she goes upstairs, she talks exclusively to Chad and the two of them argue about gay parenting.  Constance says that they can never be the parents since the child never came from them.  She accidentally reveals that one of the children is her grandchild and he's surprised by this fact.  She suggests he take Ben's child, but leave Tate's to her, but he insists that the children be raised by himself and Patrick.  They want to raise them until the age of one, and smother them with pillows so that they can be cute forever. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Viv's doctor recommend remaining in the murder house?", "correct": "She needs a C-section as soon as possible", "options": ["She can't fly in her third trimester", "Midwives are better alternatives to hospitals", "She would be causing too much stress"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe needs a C-section as soon as possible.\n\n\tBillie Dean arrives at the house and gives her opinions of how tragic the house is.  Constance says that their one goal is to remove Chad and Patrick and Billie Dean says that they need to dislodge them from the strong paramagnetic grip possessed by the house.  The evils therein want to break through into the physical world and it continues to get stronger the more and more it kills.  Billie Dean says that there may very well be a way to get rid of the guys though.\rAt the mental hospital, Ben arrives to pick up Vivian.  She asks about Violet, but Ben says she's been having a rough time.  The doctor suggests that bedrest be employed immediately but he also says that a C-section may be required.  One of the babies is already large enough to be removed from the womb and it's actually making the other baby weaker; it's a condition known as intrauterine omophagia. \n"}, {"text": "What word does Violet learn she must say in order to banish evil spirits?", "correct": "Croatoan", "options": ["Beetlejuice", "Roanoke", "Away"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCroatoan.\n\n\tBillie Dean tells Violet that the only confirmable, successful purging of spirits that she can recall happened in the 1590s on the coast of North Carolina in the town of Roanoke.  Over one hundred residents haunted the local tribes after their death.  The local tribes burned the final possessions (their talismans) to summon the colony's spirits and then their leader uttered one word-- CROATOAN-- and banished them forever.  This word was later found on a post near the colony.\rViolet tells this to Tate in the attic and he's skeptical of the idea.  He doesn't really trust Billie Dean because of her reluctance to include him in their conversation.  Violet suggests that they search for the talismans. \n"}, {"text": "What talisman does Tate steal from Patrick?", "correct": "Ring", "options": ["Watch", "Shirt", "Glasses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRing.\n\n\tTate finds Patrick in the nursery and eggs him on before asking if he's ready for all of the baby stuff; he doesn't seem like the type for babies.  Patrick doesn't take kindly to anything Tate says-- after all, Tate killed him.  Tate ultimately tries to seduce Patrick by putting himself out there and trying to make Chad look like the bad guy, but it only results in Patrick fighting him.  Patrick says that he was going to get out until Tate killed him and now he's stuck in the house with a man he loathes.  Chad overhears this and runs out of the doorway, so Patrick follows.  Tate, luckily, is able to snag a ring off Patrick's hand without his noticing.\rBen returns to the house with Vivian and she refuses to go in.  Ben heads inside to get their things and bring Violet, but when he leaves, Viv starts to experience contractions.\rViolet finds Chad's watch in the nursery because he took it off to paint, but Ben returns home, putting a bit of a damper on the plans.  He says that they're leaving, but she says that she can't-- he needs to take Viv to Florida and he can come back for her if he wants, but she can't go no matter how much she wants to.  He wonders if she's on drugs, but she tells him, outright, that she's dead. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Viv give birth?", "correct": "In the living room", "options": ["In the bedroom", "In the basement", "In a hospital"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the living room.\n\n\tBen, in denial, tries to take Violet outside anyways despite her explanation that she didn't mean to take so many pills.  He's interrupted, however, by the entrance of Vivian and Constance.  Viv is having the babies.\rConstance brings her into the living room since she's already crowning.  Ben attempts to call a hospital, but his phone isn't working-- the receiver is broken.  Outside, the two twins from 1978 smash his car with baseball bats and advance towards the house.  Ben doesn't believe what he sees.  The lights go out.\rViolet tells Constance that the house is unsafe, so she has to work to make it so.\rConstance brings Ben to the living room to find the birthing being performed by candlelight; Charles Montgomery is attending to Vivian while the two sorority nurses, killed many decades earlier, assist in the delivery.  As Ben starts to unravel, Constance slaps him out of his daze.  She says that the house is trying to help and he needs to be there for her. \n"}, {"text": "Charles claims that Vivian's first baby is stillborn.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tBen takes his seat by Viv's side and holds her hand; he assures her that everything will be alright.  Constance recommends to Charles that she be given ether to take the edge off.  Ben remembers a happier time in a bright, sterile delivery room when Viv gave birth to Violet-- he remembers how much they were in love. In the living room, Viv says that she never wanted to lose him and he replies that she never will.  The first of the twins is birthed and Charles reveals that it is stillborn.  Viv asks for its gender and if she can hold it, but he walks it away; Constance says another is on the way.  In the other room, Charles passes the baby over to Nora, who walks away with the child. \n"}, {"text": "How does Violet attempt to destroy Chad's possessions?", "correct": "By burning them in the furnace", "options": ["By running them over in the car", "By flushing them down the toilet", "By stomping on them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy burning them in the furnace.\n\n\tIn the basement, Violet tosses Chad's watch into the furnace and he appears-- she yells Croatoan, but it doesn't work.  He says that none of the rituals and chants ever work because they give people a false sense of security but offer no real control over their lives or the afterlives of others.  People never have been.  He breaks apart one of the cribs from the nursery and tosses it into the fire and tells of his plight: he's stuck in eternity with a man who doesn't love him.  Violet, he says, has a man who loves her, but who will always be a monster.  She says he's wrong about that, but Chad reveals that he'll never change, especially since he just recently impregnated Vivian.\rUpstairs, Viv is having complications with the birth of the second child.  Constance notes the excessive bleeding and Viv feels like she's being torn apart.  The baby is finally free, however, and it begins to cry.  Viv asks to see the baby, but Constance takes it to be washed up.  Charles tells Ben that there's a problem.\rIn the kitchen, Constance cares for the baby with Moira looking over her shoulder.  Hayden asks for the baby. \n"}, {"text": "Violet, discovering the truth about Tate, decides to do which of the following?", "correct": "Leave him", "options": ["Spend eternity with him", "Force him to come to relive what he's done", "Banish him from the house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeave him.\n\n\tCharles tells Ben that there's too much bleeding and she can't be saved.  Ben tries to talk to her, but Viv begins to speak to Violet instead (though Ben can't see her).  Ben assures her that they can be happy together again while Violet says that if she's in pain, it's okay.  She can let go.  Viv realizes that she doesn't have a choice.  As Viv passes on, Ben is left in the room all alone with her body; the others disappear.\rUpstairs, Violet tells Tate that Viv has just died.  She says that he's a liar; he always knew he was dead, he always knew how he died, and he always knew what he did-- he killed all those people, the kids from Halloween.  He killed Chad and Patrick and raped Vivian.  He apologizes and says he was different then.  She says she thought he was attracted to the darkness, like her, but he IS the darkness.  He claims that he's a changed man and she believes it, but she can never forgive him.  He needs to pay for the pain and sorrow he's caused.  She can't and won't be with him.  She closes her eyes and tells him to go away...so he does.\rViolet begins to cry, alone in her room.  Vivian appears behind her and consoles her, saying that it was very brave of her and that she's proud.  Violet is sorry that she had to die and that she lost her baby, but Viv says she didn't lose her baby. \n"}]}
