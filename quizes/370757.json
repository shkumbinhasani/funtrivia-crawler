Knowing the locals, he lets himself into Mrs. Tattler's house to see that everything is alright; the door is unlocked.  When he walks into the dining room, he finds Mrs. Tattler's body on the floor.  She's been murdered.  When he heads to the second floor with a bat, he finds someone in the hall closet.\r A body is rushed to the hospital; the doctors are shocked to the point of nausea.

Speaking in a german accent, she asks about the police officer guarding one of the doors and goes on to sympathize with the girl, urging her to visit her \"Cabinet of Curiosities\".  Sure enough, she convinces her and she dons a striped outfit to gain access to the blocked room.  When she enters, she's shocked and delighted by what she sees-- a woman with two heads, both of which can think and speak independently of one another.  They speak to each other telepathically, considering what this woman is doing in their room.  One is excited to chat, but the other clearly isn't.\r On the edge of Lake Okeechobee, a young couple enjoys a picnic.  When the boyfriend, Troy, heads to his car, the girl is approached by a man in a clown outfit and is very much startled by his approach.  Troy returns to protect his girl, but both are knocked out.  The girl awakens to find the clown stabbing her lover with a pair of scissors, so she makes a run for it.  Unfortunately, the clown is quicker than she is, and it doesn't take long for him to catch up. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Elsa's freak show set up?", "correct": "In a farmer's field", "options": ["In the middle of Jupiter, Florida", "On the edge of a lake", "In an abandoned warehouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a farmer's field.\n\n\tIn a Jupiter diner, Elsa cuts newspaper reviews for her Marlene Dietrich burn book when she sees someone across the bar.  It's Jimmy, and he's flirting with one of the waitresses.  Elsa criticizes him for putting their entire livelihood on the line but Jimmy says that he knows the landlord wants them out. Although their freak show has paid for a year lease, they aren't attracting any new visitors.  Instead of performing they're just hiding in the back fields of Jupiter living day by day.  A religious revival has already paid up front for the site and they're going to be kicked out.  Luckily, Elsa has been able to keep the farmer from giving the field away. Elsa, forcing Jimmy to fall back from the diner, reminds him that if anyone discovers his deformity, he'll end up in the madhouse.  When she leaves, she doesn't pay her cheque. \n"}, {"text": "To cover up the truth of what happened to their mother, Bette tries to play off the tragedy as though it were the plot of what movie?", "correct": "\"Gaslight\"", "options": ["\"The Big Heat\"", "\"Psycho\"", "\"The Big Sleep\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Gaslight\".\n\n\tAt a Tupperware party in town, Jimmy waits in a back bedroom for women to take turns entering.  Sitting them on the bed, he reveals his deformity; his fingers are fused together to form lobster-like claws.  Fortunately, the women end up leaving happy despite the freakishness.\rAt the hospital, Elsa asks Bette and Dot to describe their tragedy.  Dot describes it as a robbery gone bad, but Bette gives away their lies by describing the murder plot from \"Gaslight\".  Elsa says that she knows their mother died two days before they were found upstairs.\rElsewhere in Jupiter, a family is attacked by the evil clown.  The mother and father are killed in their bedroom; the son has disappeared.  It's almost a week before the authorities find out. \n"}, {"text": "Who killed Mrs. Tattler?", "correct": "Bette", "options": ["Twisty the Clown", "Dot", "Elsa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBette.\n\n\tOut in the woods, an abandoned bus sits, dilapidated, with a cage chained shut in the back.  Inside, the girl from the lake and the boy taken from his home struggle to keep positive thoughts.  Their clown captor returns to 'entertain them' with some props but inadvertently ends up scaring them.  This, in turn, infuriates him to the point of bashing at their cages and tearing the place apart.\rElsa finds Bette and Dot at their house, packing their things for a trip.  As it turned out, they left the hospital unannounced.  Elsa tells them that she can protect them; she knows the truth behind what they did.  On the night of their mother's death, Bette killed her in anger.  That night, Bette stabbed Dot to punish her.  When they ask what Elsa wants, she claims all she wants is to save them.  On September 3rd, Bette and Dot are taken to Elsa's freak show.  Bette feels blessed with freedom.  Dot feels as though she's walked through the gates of Hell. \n"}, {"text": "Jimmy's mother, Ethel, has which distinguishing feature?", "correct": "Beard", "options": ["Two heads", "Third arm", "Scaly skin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeard.\n\n\tWhile Bette loves the glamour associated with the prospect of stardom that she finds at the freak show (and looks forward to having a tent as lavish as Elsa's one day), Dot dreads her stay with the freaks, feeling the place is nightmarish.  Fortunately, she feels the slightest bit attracted to Jimmy Darling.  On the other side of the coin, Dot strongly dislikes Jimmy's mother, Ethel, who also happens to be a bearded lady.  Ethel was found and 'saved' by Elsa when she was found in a drunk tank, and she gave her and her son a better life.  Now, with the girls as a headline act, they may fall into fortune.\rWhile the other freaks are worried, Elsa has them put out a banner for their new act-- police search or not. \n"}, {"text": "The twins' first show with the freak troupe is sold out.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOut in the main tent, Elsa finishes dinner over a home movie while Ethel cleans up in the back.  The evening is interrupted by the candy striper from the hospital who, angry, forces her way in and demands to be brought home.  Elsa tells her that the opium is making her cranky; she actually likes it at the freak show. When she does go home, Elsa says, she won't tell anyone of what happened because they've filmed all of the perverse acts she allegedly performed.  When the video plays on the side of the tent it becomes apparent that the girl was very much involved in the 'freakish' events around her. She admits to loving what happened, but is still conflicted; she wants to tell the world of their depravity.  Elsa is forced to put away the movie when, as it turns out, there's going to be a sold out show.  Somebody has bought all of the tickets. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills the detective who arrives at the Freak Show looking for Bette and Dot?", "correct": "Jimmy", "options": ["Elsa", "Ethel", "Bette and Dot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJimmy.\n\n\tJimmy and his mother argue over whether or not they should leave Elsa's freak show.  Ethel tells him that they aren't leaving, and if he wants to help his people he'll get the twins to eat so that they can be as ready as possible to perform.  That night as Jimmy leaves his trailer, he sees a man enter Bette and Dot's tent. The man, a detective, has arrived to take the girls because he saw the sign down the road.  Jimmy, realizing the urgency of the situation, whistles for some of the other freaks and they surround the tent.  With a single slash of his pocketknife, Jimmy kills the detective then and there and tells the twins that they'll save them too. \n"}, {"text": "What do Dandy and Gloria Mott attempt to do following the freak show performance?", "correct": "Purchase the twins", "options": ["Burn down the tent", "Join the troupe", "Invest in the show"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPurchase the twins.\n\n\tThe show is finally upon the freaks and as the curtain rises it turns out that there are only two people in the audience: Gloria Mott and her son, Dandy.  Both of them, clearly quite wealthy, have purchased all of the seats for this particular debut show.  Dandy demands that the show commence, and when it starts it becomes apparent that he has an odd, childish interest in those heading onstage. Ethel leads the introductions to show the small audience their curiosities and Dandy becomes fascinated with the twins from first glance.  Before he can get a good look, however, Elsa is brought onstage, performing her rendition of \"Life on Mars\".  At this time, Dandy heads backstage and offers the twins $5,000 to be his forever. Elsa ends up getting involved after the show, refusing the offer...and the subsequent $10,000 offer...and the final $15,000 offer.  The girls say that their home is with Elsa leaving the Motts incensed as they leave. \n"}, {"text": "It is revealed that Elsa has which of the following 'freakish' handicaps?", "correct": "She has no legs", "options": ["She has a hole through her chest", "She has a silver tongue", "She's bald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe has no legs.\n\n\tThe freak show shuts down for the evening but things are still happening.  The killer clown arrives to enjoy the rides while the freaks responsible for the detective's death head out to the nearby fields to destroy the body.  As a family, they hack at the corpse and leave no trace to protect themselves from the wrongful attacks from the outside.  In the distance, the clown watches in silence.\rIn her tent, Elsa smokes opium while Ethel stops by.  Confiding in her friend, Ethel reveals that she never brought the girls to save the troupe; she selfishly did it so that people would come to see her and she could become a star.  She feels ashamed, but Ethel says there's nothing wrong about it because she deserves it for the good things she's done.  When Ethel leaves, Elsa weeps as she removes her prosthetic legs. \n"}]}
