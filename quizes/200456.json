Which driver got out of his car while on the track and attempted to pull his right front fender off his tire?", "correct": "Sterling Marlin", "options": ["Jeff Gordon", "Matt Kenseth", "Ward Burton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSterling Marlin.\n\n\tJeff Gordon and Sterling initiated the dominoes when they were jostling for position in the front of the pack, creating a multi-car accident.  On nationwide TV, Sterling then did the deed.  Nascar placed Marlin to the back of the lead lap as a result.

The others listed were not brothers.  After winning the pole in a Mercury, Cale Yarborough won the 1968 Daytona 500.  The following season, LeeRoy Yarbrough won the race in a Ford.  While Cale won four Daytona 500s in his great career, this was LeeRoy's only win at the infamous track.  At any rate, they were not related.  The Petty's were father-son as were the Allison's.  Ralph and Buddy were not related. \n"}, {"text": "The inaugural Daytona 500 in 1959 ended in a photo finish and took three days to declare the winner.

He raced his entire career without million dollar sponsorships, and kept his race team running on a shoestring.  After five Nascar wins (none at Daytona) and 883 starts, Dave finally retired in 2002. \n"}, {"text": "The 1979 Daytona 500 ended with a crash on the last lap, then a fist fight for the fans in the stands and the television world.

Dale finally won the race that had eluded him so much in 1998, but also the same track that killed him in 2001.  On the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500, in a wreck that was ignorantly blamed on fellow driver Sterling Marlin, Dale came to an end of physical existence.  Michael Waltrip won the race, but took a backseat to the accident of Earnhardt. \n"}]}
