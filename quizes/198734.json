Estella is still under the illusion that her lot in life is to be cold and unloving, and she can find no better man than Drummle upon whom to exercise these 'skills'.  \r Pip is heartbroken by this stunning turn of events, always having had his mind set on making Estella his wife. \n"}, {"text": "Magwitch, the convict with whom Pip made brief acquaintance at the beginning of the film, reemerges during the latter half of the story.

Estella reveals at this point her betrothal to Drummle. Estella leaves first, followed by Pip, but not before the latter makes clear to Miss Havisham that she has been instrumental in breaking his heart.  Havisham, realizing at this point that her behavior has been cruel, catches her brittle wedding dress in the flames of her fireplace. Pip returns in order to save her, but he is unable to put out the flames in time. \n"}, {"text": "Towards the end of the film, there is a final, shocking revelation that Pip discovers via his lawyer.

Pip reveals this information to a grateful and very pleased Magwitch on his deathbed. \n"}, {"text": "Despite Pip's efforts, Magwitch is recaptured by the authorities by the end of the film and is executed.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIndeed, this is the intention of the authorities who have recaptured Magwitch.  However, they do not get the opportunity to execute Magwitch, as he passes away on a hospital bed with a loving Pip holding his hand (and revealing Estella's secret).  Pip is thus separated from the fortune of his benefactor by law.  This does not stop him from seeking out Estella, and winning her hand by the end of the film.\r I hope you enjoyed this quiz and will try more of my quizzes in the future. \n"}]}
