{"id": "314816", "name": "1.2 \"The First Taste\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "True Blood"], "questions": [{"text": "Sookie takes a bad beating from the Rattrays in revenge for her dramatic rescue of Bill.  She was, in fact, very close to death until Bill saved her.  How does Bill save her life?", "correct": "By making her drink his blood", "options": ["By applying pressure to her head wound", "He flies her to the hospital", "Witchcraft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy making her drink his blood.\n\n\tIt is Bill's turn to rescue Sookie from the Rattrays, unfortunately Sookie had already taken a bad battering by the time he arrived.  Sookie fades in and out of consciousness as Bill carries her to safety, and Bill recognises that she is close to death.  He hastily bites his own wrist to open a vein and pleads with Sookie to drink before his wound closes over.  Understandably, Sookie is somewhat reluctant to partake of this unusual treatment, but Bill persists and Sookie very quickly begins to heal from her injuries.  She will later realise that Bill's blood carries other side-effects. \n"}, {"text": "When Sookie regains consciousness after her assault, what does she find Bill doing?", "correct": "Licking her head wound", "options": ["Crying", "Draining the blood of the Rattrays", "Arguing with the Rattrays"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLicking her head wound.\n\n\tSookie does not seem too disturbed to awaken and discover Bill sampling the blood that remains from her injuries.  She wonders if she tastes different to other humans, and Bill indicates that she certainly does. \n"}, {"text": "Since meeting Sookie, Bill has suspected there is something different about this small town waitress.  What does Sookie finally admit to Bill?", "correct": "She is telepathic", "options": ["She is a shape shifter", "She is a vampire", "She is a hired assassin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe is telepathic.\n\n\tBill once again inquires to Sookie \"What are you?\", this time however, she gives him a straight answer responding \"what I am is telepathic, I can hear people's thoughts\". Bill wonders if she can hear his thoughts and Sookie reveals that she can't hear the thoughts of vampires.  Bill immediately realises how liberating this must be for Sookie.  He wonders how she has managed to have a social life, and, as Sookie's flashbacks of disastrous dates demonstrates, telepathy is clearly not always an asset. \n"}, {"text": "Sookie starts to discover a little more about Bill's history.  He was made a vampire in 1865 when he was 30 years old, he also participated in a war.  Which war did Bill fight in?", "correct": "American Civil War", "options": ["Franco-Prussian War", "Texas Revolution", "World War I"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican Civil War.\n\n\tBill and Sookie begin to learn more about each other, and Sookie is surprised to discover that Bill was made a vampire when he was only 30 years of age, she had assumed that he was older.

Sookie wonders if he would be willing to attend a meeting of Adele's club.  Bill agrees to attend if his going will make Sookie happy; this is despite the fact that he objects to the name of the club, stating \"there is nothing glorious about war\".  This development leaves Adele needing to call a special night meeting, as the usual daylight time would be rather inconvenient for Bill. \n"}, {"text": "The Rattray's untimely death becomes common knowledge around Bon Temps.  What is the official story about how Rattrays died?", "correct": "Tornado", "options": ["Vampire attack", "Double suicide", "Car crash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTornado.\n\n\tWe first hear the news that the Rattrays had been killed when Adele receives a phone call from a friend.  Sookie rushes straight to the Rattrays trailer to see the destruction for herself.  She is met Sheriff Bud Dearborne who is skeptical about the tornado theory.

Vampires are not forthcoming about the potent effects their blood can have; a consequence of keeping their identity secret for thousands of years.  Now that Sookie has drunk Bill's blood, he lets her know that he will always be able to find her.  Despite these benefits, Sookie remains underwhelmed by Bill's talents as a vampire - after all he can't levitate, change into a bat or even turn invisible! \n"}, {"text": "Nan Flanagan of the American Vampire League attempted a television debate with the Reverend Theodore Newlin.

Well ... Bill did say that over the years vampires had become more skillful at hiding what they had done (with the obvious exception of believable tornado hits). \n"}, {"text": "All the female employees at Merlotte's wear a distinctive uniform ...

Tara immediately asks why he and Terry are not required to wear uniforms.  She announces that this is because they are men, and \"Sam don't feel the need to sexualise the men in his employment the same way he do the women\".  Sam, recognising that he is not going to win this argument, concedes that Tara need not wear a uniform. \n"}]}
