Quiz | Entertainment by Themes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Entertainment by Themes", "Thematic People in Entertainment"], "questions": [{"text": "Victor Hugo's Quasimodo was known as the hunchback of which Parisian location?", "correct": "Notre-Dame Cathedral", "options": ["Louvre Palace", "Eiffel Tower", "H\u00f4tel de Ville"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNotre-Dame Cathedral.\n\n\t\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", released in 1831, was one of Victor Hugo's famous French works (though he was much more celebrated for \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\").  In it, the tragic hunchback Quasimodo falls in love with the beautiful gypsy dancer Esmeralda but he finds himself in competition with his own master, Monseigneur Claude Frollo, for her affections.  The original book is horribly tragic while the Disney cartoon version, released in 1996 (with Tom Hulce as Quasimodo), kind of sidesteps the latter half of the original story in favor of a more upbeat ending for kids. \n"}, {"text": "\"Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself. To help thee curse that poisonous bunch-back'd toad.\"\n\nWhich Shakespearean character was alleged to be hunchbacked?", "correct": "Richard III", "options": ["Marc Antony", "Titus Andronicus", "Guildenstern"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard III.\n\n\tShakespeare wrote \"Richard III\" in 1592, chronicling the man who was King of England for only two years.  He was, allegedly, a clever man and stronger in mind than body, and while today's historians believe he may have had scoliosis, it's Shakespeare's image of the man (and the character) that has shaped peoples' interpretations of the former King. That said, it was important to portray Richard as a villain as, in history, it was his death that ended the House of York and ushered in the House of Tudor's reign.  The \"Richard III\" tragedy is one of Shakespeare's longest works even though it was one of the shortest real-life reigns he put into a play. \n"}, {"text": "What 18th century poet known for \"The Rape of the Lock\" was afflicted with a hunchback after contracting spinal tuberculosis in his youth?", "correct": "Alexander Pope", "options": ["John Donne", "William Blake", "William Wordsworth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlexander Pope.\n\n\tPope, one of the more famous poets of the early Enlightenment Era, released \"Rape of the Lock\" to great fanfare in 1714 and was quite well-received for his works beside the one.  That said, Pope suffered through a number of setbacks with personal health and wellness in his life, especially after a bout with spinal tuberculosis resulted in his requiring care through much of the remainder of his life (he lived another four decades after).  Pope ended up spending many of his days as a recluse due in part to this affliction and his Catholic upbringing. \n"}, {"text": "In Giuseppe Verdi's \"Rigoletto\", the titular character was hunchbacked.  What was his profession?", "correct": "Court jester", "options": ["Archbishop", "Opera singer", "Bullfighter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCourt jester.\n\n\tBased on Victor Hugo's \"Le roi s'amuse\", Giuseppe Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" premiered in Teatro La Fenice in 1851.  The opera was considered one of the greats from its first performances in which a hunchbacked court jester and a duke fought over a young woman, Rigoletto's daughter, until they were both recipients of a horrible curse.  The role of Rigoletto was written for a baritone performer and, as he is the anti-hero of the show, much emphasis is placed on his physicality throughout.  It's unsurprising that the opera was one of Verdi's most celebrated. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein's hunched assistant in Mel Brooks' 1974 film \"Young Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "Igor", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nIgor.\n\n\tThe character of Igor has been somewhat of a stock character in \"Frankenstein\"-inspired films over the years and, originally, Frankenstein's assistant was known by the name Fritz (in the first cinematic adaptation).

It did, of course, feature mad science. \n"}, {"text": "In which movie series does bad guy Felonius Gru adopt three children, even though he's a supervillain?", "correct": "Despicable Me", "options": ["A Series of Unfortunate Events", "Mastermind", "Inside Out"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDespicable Me.\n\n\tVoiced by Steve Carrell, the top-heavy supervillain Gru adopts three orphans in an attempt to infiltrate a rival's base, but the charm and good nature of his new girls ends up reshaping him into a better person, even if he happens to still have a bit of bad in him.

The movies were predictably horrible and often featured Dr. Tongue and Bruno emulating the 3D experience by taking items and thrusting them towards the camera several times. \n"}]}
