{"id": "280716", "name": "So You Want To Be a Druid Online Trivia | World of Warcraft | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "World of Warcraft", "World of Warcraft - Class Specific"], "questions": [{"text": "Welcome to the world of \"Warcraft!\" You've connected to the Internet and loaded the game, and now you're ready to create your character. Your first step will be to pick a faction (the Horde and the Alliance are enemies) and a race for your character. As a druid, you have only two races to choose from -- one from the Alliance and one from the Horde. What race can your druid be?", "correct": "A Night Elf or a Tauren", "options": ["A Gnome or an Undead", "A Draenei or a Blood Elf", "A Human or a Troll"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Night Elf or a Tauren.\n\n\tNight Elves -- a race belonging to the Alliance -- have long pointed ears, glowing eyes, and blue-green hair (the precise tint can be selected by the player). Tauren, who are allied with the Horde, are huge beings resembling bipedal cattle, from their horns all the way to their hooves. Not all Night Elves and Tauren are druids -- other possible classes include warriors and hunters -- but, of the game's ten playable races, they're the only two called to druid-ness. \n"}, {"text": "Congratulations! You now have a Level 1 druid, ready to quest in your starting area and to start earning experience, cash, and items. Among the items you need are better pieces of armor, since you don't begin with much! What's the heaviest type of armor a druid can wear?", "correct": "Leather", "options": ["Cloth", "Mail", "Plate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeather.\n\n\t\"World of Warcraft\" features four classes of armor; from lightest to heaviest, these are cloth, leather, mail, and plate. The heavier the gear, the higher the protection -- but a character's class decides how heavy the gear can get. The heaviest armor a druid can wear is leather, though druids can wear cloth as well -- and they might choose to, if they find a cloth piece with some particularly nice properties! \n"}, {"text": "When you visit a druid trainer to learn new spells at Level 10, one of those spells is not like the others. A teleportation spell, it takes you to a serene, wooded enclave where Horde and Alliance druids work together against evil and corruption. What is the name of this forested zone, the headquarters of the druidic Cenarion Circle?", "correct": "Moonglade", "options": ["Darnassus", "Thunder Bluff", "Felwood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoonglade.\n\n\tThe \"Teleport: Moonglade\" spell actually takes you to Nighthaven, the only town in the Moonglade forest. You'll speak here with various members and allies of the Cenarion Circle, doing some special druid-specific quests and learning about the game's backstory. You'll also find this spell very handy for later levels: by teleporting to Nighthaven and flying from there, you can often save travel time over taking a boat or a zeppelin. \n"}, {"text": "At Level 10, you are also introduced to the druid's most unique ability: shapeshifting. A druid can perform many functions -- from taking damage, to dealing damage, to healing damage -- and you will eventually be able to shapeshift into the form best suited for each task. You've got to start somewhere, though: what is the first new form you have the opportunity to get?", "correct": "Bear form", "options": ["Cat form", "Travel form", "Aquatic form"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBear form.\n\n\tThe quest for bear form leads you first to the forest of Moonglade, where the surprisingly friendly Great Bear Spirit sends you on a mission. Once you've completed this task, you can forevermore transform instantly into a bear, in violation of nearly every known law of biology and physics. We'll let that slide, though, given the bear's greater armor, greater health, and special abilities for attracting and absorbing damage.\r At Level 16, a lengthy quest chain results in aquatic form, a seal-like creature that breathes underwater and swims speedily (NOT Speedo-ly: seals do not require swimwear). Later forms are simply purchased from the druid trainer: a cat at Level 20 for dishing out lots of damage, a cheetah-like travel form at Level 30 for swift overland movement, and a bigger, badder dire bear at Level 40. \n"}, {"text": "As you progress through the levels, you start thinking about how you want to spend your talent points. These points (you get one for each new level, beginning with 10) allow you to unlock special abilities and optimize your druid for a particular role. Which druid talent tree focuses on improving cat and bear forms?", "correct": "Feral", "options": ["Beast Mastery", "Balance", "Restoration"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFeral.\n\n\tEach class's talents are divided into three areas of focus, called \"trees.\" For druids, these are Balance (for the maximum spell damage); Feral (for the most useful bear and cat characteristics); and Restoration (for the most effective healing). As more talent points are invested in a particular tree, higher-level talents become available -- so it is often best to focus attention on a single tree.\r Despite its feral-sounding name, Beast Mastery is a talent tree for hunters (not druids), allowing them to make their pets more effective. \n"}, {"text": "As you wander through the land, battling beasts, bandits, and other baddies, you sometimes want to just stand at a safe distance and do spell damage. Unfortunately, for some reason your enemies keep trying to run up to you and defend themselves! But fear not -- your druid has quite a bag of tricks. What is the druid caster-form spell that brings foes to a temporary standstill?", "correct": "Entangling Roots ensnares the enemy in a rapidly growing plant.", "options": ["Frost Nova traps the enemy's feet in blocks of ice.", "Earthbind slows the enemy's motion to a crawl.", "Concussion Blow, a weapon attack, stuns the enemy."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEntangling Roots ensnares the enemy in a rapidly growing plant.\n\n\tFrost Nova, a mage spell, stops cold all enemies within a certain area. Concussion Blow, an ability that warriors can get through talent points, stuns a given enemy for a few seconds. Earthbind, which a shaman can cast using a totem, makes an area extremely slow for enemies to move through.\r Entangling Roots is the only one of these abilities that can be used by a druid, although it has limits: it affects only one target at a time, and it can only be used outdoors (making it useless in buildings, dungeons, and cities). In addition to stopping the enemy (perhaps long enough for the druid to run away or bandage), the roots also deal a small amount of damage while they are active. \n"}, {"text": "Some enemies can continue to damage your character even after the fight is over, through curses, poisons, bleed effects and other harmful spells. Luckily, a druid is often able to cope with this problem. Without items, druids can gain the ability to dispel which of the following types of effect?", "correct": "Poison", "options": ["Bleed", "Disease", "Magic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoison.\n\n\tAt Level 16, druids begin a quest line that leads to a Cure Poison ability; in the course of the quests, they must first make an antivenom and use it to cure sickly creatures. Later on, they can receive Remove Curse from a druid trainer. Both abilities are extremely useful: while active, poisons and curses can reduce a character's abilities, slow them down, and even deal deadly levels of damage!\r Diseases, often caught from creatures with such charming names as Rabid Timberwolf or Festering Ghoul, are just as damaging (and, sometimes, can even infect party members!) but cannot be cleansed by a druid without the benefit of items for that purpose. Magic and bleed effects must also be left to run their course. In situations like these, a druid's healing abilities may well save his or her life! \n"}, {"text": "As you travel around the world with a brave, bold band of adventurers, fighting evil at every turn, sometimes -- inevitably -- one of your party members will die. Luckily, as a druid, you have the chance to resurrect them quickly -- without waiting for them to run back as a ghost and claim their body. Although one of your resurrection spells comes at the cost of a reagent and a twenty-minute cooldown, it's special in a way other classes can't match. What is it?", "correct": "You can resurrect any player even if you are in combat.", "options": ["The player you resurrect will always return with full health and mana.", "Your resurrection of any player does not cost any mana.", "The player you resurrect cannot be killed again until five minutes after the resurrection."], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou can resurrect any player even if you are in combat.\n\n\tYes, resurrection -- a miraculous feat at the center of numerous world religions -- is commonplace in the world of \"Warcraft.\" Paladins, priests and shamans can all resurrect other players (and, in the case of shamans, themselves); warlocks can store the soul of one party member per half-hour, saving that person from one death; and hunters can return life to their pets. Only druids, however, can resurrect an arbitrary player in the middle of a fight.\r The original druid resurrection spell -- called Rebirth -- does have a twenty-minute cooldown, unlike other resurrection spells, so it is important to use it only when it really counts. (And in those cases -- for example, bringing back a tank or a healer to fight a boss -- it really, really does count!) A druid who ventures into heavy fighting without a stack of Rebirth reagents -- the necessary seed changes for each successive level of the spell -- is likely to take some serious flak from party members. Just before the release of \"Wrath of the Lich King,\" druids were given a second resurrection spell -- Revive -- that can't be used in combat but comes without a cooldown, putting them on a par with other healing classes. \n"}, {"text": "Once your druid character has reached a high level and you've accumulated a large number of talent points, you may be able to reach the \"top\" of a talent tree -- gaining the ability that requires the most talent points leading up to it. Suppose that you've decided to focus in the talent tree devoted to healing, and that you can now spend a talent on learning to shapeshift to a new form: the Tree of Life. Which of these characteristics does the Tree of Life NOT have?", "correct": "A 10% armor bonus, from bark-like skin", "options": ["A healing bonus, equal to 25% of the tree's spirit, to all party members", "Immunity to polymorph effects", "A limited selection of spells that can be cast, mainly consisting of instant healing spells"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA 10% armor bonus, from bark-like skin.\n\n\tIt's easy to see why a druid in Tree of Life form can't be polymorphed (or turned into a critter): the form is a complete tree, with roots, branches, and even an assortment of leaves artfully arranged about the head and wrists. (A Tree of Life can be banished, however, like other elementals.) It also seems plausible that a tree might have somewhat fewer abilities than a druid in caster form! The Tree of Life can cure poison effects, perform Innervate (which increases mana regeneration), resurrect players, and cast a number of healing-over-time spells -- but cannot remove curses, use attack spells, or use healing touch, the workhorse of most druid healers without this form. Nonetheless, the Tree of Life healing bonus makes it a formidable tool for healers, especially in large groups.\r Tree of Life is available once 40 talent points have been spent in the Restoration tree; the earliest it can be achieved is Level 50. \n"}, {"text": "As players work through the higher-level content of the game, most have their eyes on the prize: Level 70 -- the highest attainable level in the \"Burning Crusade\" expansion -- and the right to get a flying mount! Druids, however, have a big advantage: they can obtain a flight form at Level 68. Which of these statements about the druid flight form is true?", "correct": "Flight form cannot be used on the original continents (Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms).", "options": ["Alliance and Horde druids have identical flight forms.", "Druids must train up to riding skill 225 before getting flight form.", "A druid may shift to flight form at any time, even in combat."], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlight form cannot be used on the original continents (Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms).\n\n\tThe Outlands -- high-level zones opened as part of the \"Burning Crusade\" -- are the first area where flying mounts and flying forms can be used, followed by \"The Wrath of the Lich King\"'s new continent of Northrend (although players can't fly there until Level 77). The \"old world\" of Azeroth just isn't designed for flying players!\r Druid flight form is an instant-cast spell -- making it very handy for escaping sticky situations -- but it cannot be cast in combat. Both Horde and Alliance druids resemble birds, but with different colors: Horde in golden-brown, Alliance with gray-black. And finally, druids do get a whopping advantage in achieving lift-off: they need pay only 7 gold to a trainer to get a flight form and a riding ability of 225, where other classes must pay about 1000 gold for riding training and a flying mount. (All classes must spend additional cash to access flying ability in Northrend.)\r Thank you for playing! I hope that you've enjoyed this quiz. Happy questing! \n"}]}
