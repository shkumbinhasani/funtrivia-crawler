{"id": "218054", "name": "'LOST', Season 1: Behind The Scenes Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "LOST", "'Lost' Themed Quizzes"], "questions": [{"text": "Series creators J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof admit that, in the original draft of the pilot episode, the character of Jack Shephard, M.D. was supposed to die.  Which big-time movie star was originally going to play Jack, since his commitment to the TV show would only have lasted one episode?", "correct": "Michael Keaton", "options": ["George Clooney", "Christian Bale", "Val Kilmer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Keaton.\n\n\tOnce Abrams let several close friends read the script of the pilot, most of them begged him not to kill off Jack.  Abrams heeded their request and made Jack not only a regular character, but the ostensible \"star\" of the show.  This put busy movie star Michael Keaton out of the running, and opened the door for Matthew Fox. \n"}, {"text": "Jin Kwon, the Korean character who apparently speaks almost no English, is played by Korean-American actor Daniel Dae Kim.  True or False: Before he was cast on \"LOST\", Kim spoke no Korean.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDaniel Dae Kim states in an interview on the DVD that he found acting in Korean to be a challenge, since he hadn't spoken much Korean since he was in high school and was living with his parents.  He goes on to say that he had to *refresh* his language skills in order to play Jin.\r I know there's a persistent rumor that Kim spoke NO Korean and had to be coached completely by his co-star Yunjin Kim...but it's clear from Daniel's reference to having spoken Korean with his parents as a child and teenager that said rumor is simply not true. \n"}, {"text": "One actor was very nearly cut from the cast because of a snag in the process of obtaining the necessary work visa to allow him/her to work in the United States.  Who was it?", "correct": "Evangeline Lilly (Kate)", "options": ["Emilie de Ravin (Claire)", "Naveen Andrews (Sayid)", "Dominic Monaghan (Charlie)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvangeline Lilly (Kate).\n\n\tMs. Lilly (or \"Evey\", as she's apparently called by friends) is a Canadian citizen, and there was a very real possibility that her work visa was not going to be arranged in time for her to join the rest of the cast in Hawaii for the shooting of the pilot episode.  Luckily, at the very last minute, everything was worked out, and she was able to make the shoot.\r Naveen Andrews and Dominic Monaghan are British citizens, and Emilie de Ravin is Australian.  There was apparently no trouble with their work visas. \n"}, {"text": "Vincent, the seemingly male yellow labrador owned by Walt (Malcolm David Kelly), is actually played by a female dog.  What is her name?", "correct": "Madison", "options": ["Camellia", "Dolly", "Hannah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadison.\n\n\tLike many fans of this show, I have a number of theories rolling about my head.  One of them concerns Vincent (Madison) and Walt and his \"special\" nature...but that's another quiz entirely. \n"}, {"text": "A number of audition tapes are included on the DVD, and it would seem that the character of Sawyer was difficult to cast, since we see some familiar actors other than Josh Holloway read for the part.  Which of the following people is never shown trying out for the part of Sawyer?", "correct": "Harold Perrineau (Michael)", "options": ["Jorge Garcia (Hurley)", "Matthew Fox (Jack)", "Dominic Monaghan (Charlie)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarold Perrineau (Michael).\n\n\tFox, Monaghan, and yes, even Garcia (!) are shown reading for the part of resident con man/scavenger Sawyer, but Perrineau never is.  Personally, I'm glad that Josh Holloway got the part. \n"}, {"text": "\"You All Everybody,\" the song that made Driveshaft famous, was written by Dominic Monaghan, the actor who plays Driveshaft bass player Charlie Pace.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMonaghan states on the DVD that he and a friend did write and record a song that they hoped would be used as Driveshaft's hit single, but Abrams and Lindelof decided not to use it at all in the first season. \n"}, {"text": "Speaking of \"You All Everybody,\" the title of the song is a reference to an off-handed comment made by someone in the audience of a real-life talk show.  Who was the host of the talk show?", "correct": "Phil Donahue", "options": ["Jerry Springer", "David Letterman", "Geraldo Rivera"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhil Donahue.\n\n\tAccording to Damon Lindelof, a running joke on set came from his own memory of a woman in the audience of a \"Donahue\" show (presumably sometime in the 80's) expressing her disdain for the people on stage by saying something akin to \"You all everybody be actin' like you sumpin' special wit' yo' expensive clothes.\"  Lindelof started saying that to cast and crew members to make them laugh...and an approximation of that quote eventually made its way into the lyrics of the song itself. \n"}, {"text": "Where in Hawaii is \"LOST\" shot?", "correct": "Oahu", "options": ["Honolulu", "Maui", "none of these -- \"LOST\" is not shot in Hawaii"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOahu.\n\n\tThe crew uses the island of Oahu for all beach scenes, and most jungle scenes.  Some shooting, of course, is actually done in Los Angeles (i.e. the majority of the flashbacks, the scenes in the caves, the interior of \"the hatch\" in season 2). \n"}, {"text": "The DVD set also includes a couple of flashbacks that were shot for the season one finale, but wound up being cut.  One such flashback features Claire (Emilie de Ravin) at the airport, just before boarding Oceanic Flight 815.  In the scene, Claire has an extended conversation with a minor character seen previously in the series.  Who was it?", "correct": "the pilot, Seth (Gregg Grunberg)", "options": ["the U.S. Marshal (Frederic Lehne/Lane)", "Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck)", "Rose (L. Scott Caldwell)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe pilot, Seth (Gregg Grunberg).\n\n\tClaire and the pilot -- whose name we never learn -- share a few minutes of conversation in a cafe in the airport just before everyone boards the plane.  The pilot is charming and friendly and empathetic, and promises his very pregnant soon-to-be passenger a smooth ride.  Boy, was he off on that one.\r By the way, if you're looking to correct me on the dual spelling of the name of the actor who played the Marshal, don't bother.  According to www.imdb.com, the man's name is Frederic Lehne, but for some reason, he's billed as Frederic Lane in the credits of \"LOST\". \n"}, {"text": "And finally, the DVD extras include some hilarious footage of a Q-and-A session conducted with most of the cast and creators of \"LOST\" at the Museum of Radio and Television in New York City.  At one point, Jorge Garcia (Hurley) states that he told his mother that he and the rest of the cast had been informed that one character would not survive the first season, but no further details were given.\n\nAccording to Garcia, what was his mother's immediate response?", "correct": "\"Not Sawyer!\"", "options": ["\"Well, maybe it's just the dog.\"", "\"Oh, I hope it's that Kate.  She's dirty.\"", "\"If it's you, I've got your room all ready for you, honey.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Not Sawyer!\".\n\n\tGarcia related this anecdote during the avalanche of female audience members gushing over Josh Holloway (Sawyer).  The implication, of course, is that Garcia's mother was more concerned about the loss of Holloway's character than the one played by her own son!\r If you liked this quiz, let me know -- there's a lot more where this came from. \n"}]}
