{"id": "94900", "name": "What You Missed in Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" Quiz | Movies | 5 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies L-P", "Psycho"], "questions": [{"text": "Bird imagery abounds in Hitchcock's films. Birds are a symbol for Hitchcock of man's inhumanity getting him in the end. Birds are hunted and caged by man, and they attack. Which of these is NOT a true symbol of this in \"Psycho\"?", "correct": "Norman calls his mother \"you old crow\"", "options": ["Norman tells Marion \"you eat like a bird\"", "Norman's hobby is taxidermy and he has many stuffed birds on his wall", "After he sees what \"mother\" has done, Norman knocks two pictures of birds off the wall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorman calls his mother \"you old crow\".\n\n\tOther bird imagery -- Marion's last name is Crane, she is from Phoenix Arizona. Norman's middle name is Francis, and St. Francis is the patron saint of birds. \n"}, {"text": "Which is NOT a foreshadow of things to come?", "correct": "Marion tells Sam in bed she has just enough time to take a shower before going back to work", "options": ["Marion's bra turns from white to black in the film, marking her for death", "The cop tells Marion to go to a motel \"just to be safe\"", "The windshield wipers cutting through the rain suggest the knife and the shower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarion tells Sam in bed she has just enough time to take a shower before going back to work.\n\n\tIt may be considered a stretch, but in Marion's apartment we get a full view of her shower in the background with the shower head exposed. This may also be a foreshadow, knowing Hitchcock. \n"}, {"text": "What is a suggestion through symbolism in the film that Norman might be impotent?", "correct": "Though it is raining Norman walks down the hill without his umbrella open", "options": ["Norman asks Arboghast to help him \"get it up\" the stairs (his bed)", "Norman tells Marion \"I've had trouble sleeping lately\"", "By a stretch of fantasy, he could be referred to as Master Bates"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThough it is raining Norman walks down the hill without his umbrella open.\n\n\tAnother clue may be the fact that Norman's knife never really penetrates Marion's flesh. \n"}, {"text": "Sam tells Marion's sister not to go back to the motel. When she asks why not, what is his double-meaning reply?", "correct": "Bates", "options": ["You'll probably wind up like one of his birds", "We don't know who's crazier, Norman or his mother", "There's something crazy going on"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBates.\n\n\tBates refers not only to Norman's name and his taxidermy hobby, but also to what he does. He baits traps for unsuspecting women. \n"}, {"text": "Norman's problems are suggested to be the result of an overbearing mother. Which of these is NOT another suggestion of an overbearing mother in the film?", "correct": "The obnoxious rich guy in the bank says \"I need someone to mother me. Can you mother me?\"", "options": ["Sam suggests they turn mother's picture around and make love at her place.", "Marion says she cannot make love to Sam at her place with her mother's picture staring at them.", "Marion's co-worker mentions her mother called to see if her boyfriend called her."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe obnoxious rich guy in the bank says \"I need someone to mother me. Can you mother me?\"\n\n\tWacky, overbearing mothers is another recurring theme in Hitchcock films. They can be found in varying degrees in \"Frenzy\", \"Marnie\", \"North By Northwest\", \"The Birds\" and \"Strangers On A Train\". \n"}]}
