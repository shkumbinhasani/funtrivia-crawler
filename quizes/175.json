{"id": "175", "name": "Mixed Biology Questions Quiz | Sci / Tech | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Biology"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the following is found within mitochondria?", "correct": "cristae", "options": ["patella", "endoplasmic reticulum", "Golgi apparatus"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncristae.\n\n\tThe Golgi apparatus packages the proteins. 'Patella' is the scientific name for kneecap. \n"}, {"text": "OK, now for a dirty question: when two bacteria exchange genetic information with each other through direct contact, cell to cell, what is the process called?", "correct": "conjugation", "options": ["euglena", "transduction", "transformation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nconjugation.\n\n\tTransduction is when viruses introduce new genetic material to a bacterium; transformation is when the bacteria absorb outside genes. A euglena is a kind of one-celled organism.\r Conjugation is facilitated by the formation of a bridge-type structure between the cells. \n"}, {"text": "In DNA, adenine pairs with thymine. But in RNA, what replaces thymine?", "correct": "uracil", "options": ["nothing - it's still thymine", "guanine", "cytosine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nuracil.\n\n\tThe other nucleotides remain the same. \n"}, {"text": "What on earth does a restriction enzyme do?", "correct": "cuts DNA at specific sites", "options": ["unknown", "restricts transcription", "prevents DNA from replicating"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncuts DNA at specific sites.\n\n\tGeneticists use restriction enzymes to create recombinant DNA. \n"}, {"text": "Mutations in which of the following kinds of genes causes cancer in humans (or so goes the current theory)?", "correct": "proto-oncogenes", "options": ["gap genes", "carcinogens", "junk proto-DNA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nproto-oncogenes.\n\n\tCarcinogens cause cancer, but they are not genetic -- instead, they're external factors like cigarettes. Gap genes are found in arthropods (like fruit flies); junk DNA is DNA that doesn't encode proteins, but scientists are finding that such DNA can still be fairly important. Proto-oncogenes, when acting normally, are important in regulating things like the growth of cells and their differentiation into tissue types -- but a mutation in a proto-oncogene turns it into an oncogene, and can lead it to transform its cell into a tumor cell. \n"}, {"text": "What is the scientific name of the fruit fly, an organism much beloved by geneticists everywhere?", "correct": "Drosophila melanogaster", "options": ["Escherischia coli", "Neurospora edisonii", "Euglena larsonii"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrosophila melanogaster.\n\n"}, {"text": "Who used a flask with a curved neck to prove that spontaneous generation did not occur in a broth?", "correct": "Pasteur", "options": ["Spallanzani", "Darwin", "Redi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPasteur.\n\n\tRedi and Spallanzani used other experiments to disprove the theory of spontaneous generation. \n"}, {"text": "What does 'DNA' stand for?", "correct": "deoxyribonucleic acid", "options": ["diverse nucleotide agent", "Don't Nod Again", "Diversified Nucleotide Acid"], "explanation": "\n\n\ndeoxyribonucleic acid.\n\n\tRNA, meanwhile, is simply ribonucleic acid. The base sugar of RNA is {ribose;} the base sugar of DNA is deoxyribose. \n"}, {"text": "What human organ stores concentrated bile, which is needed to digest lipids (including fats)?", "correct": "gall bladder", "options": ["small intestine", "liver", "stomach"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngall bladder.\n\n\tThe liver secretes bile, which is collected and concentrated in the gall bladder. \n"}, {"text": "The process of converting a DNA sequence to an mRNA message is called transcription. What is the process of converting an mRNA molecule to a protein (through the mediation of tRNA) called?", "correct": "translation", "options": ["transduction", "replication", "transcription II"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntranslation.\n\n\tOne way to remember the difference between translation and transcription is that transcription is in the same language -- that of nucleotides, common to both RNA and DNA -- while translation is between languages (the nucleotides of RNA and the amino acids that make up proteins). \n"}]}
