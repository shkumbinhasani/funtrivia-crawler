As a result, an additional three films hit the big screen over the coming decade (though none matched up to the original).  Starring Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, the film followed a small island town as its waters were plagued by a giant shark. With the body count rising, some of the townspeople set out to kill the beast in their waters.  The film is particularly notable for its menacing soundtrack and opening sequence in which a skinny dipper is killed by an unknown creature from below the depths. Some of the later attacks occur on a busy beach during a warm, sunny day. \n"}, {"text": "A family crossing the American southwest finds themselves pursued by mutants in this 2006 remake of a Wes Craven film.  What is the name of the movie?", "correct": "The Hills Have Eyes", "options": ["A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Dawn of the Dead", "The Last House on the Left"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hills Have Eyes.\n\n\tDestroying the tires of their RV on a drive through the Yuma Flats, the Carter family discovers the mutants resulting from nuclear testing in the area.  They also discover that these mutants are kind of evil and spend most of the movie fighting for their survival.  Starring Emilie de Ravin (of \"LOST\" and \"Roswell\" fame) and Aaron Stanford, the movie was directed by a newer face in horror, Alexandre Aja (who previously directed the French horror film \"Haute Tension\" and would later direct \"Mirrors\").  The film was based on Wes Craven's 1977 film of the same name; both were financial successes. A sequel followed the remake in 2007. \n"}, {"text": "Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding decide to head out on a road trip in this 2005 sequel directed by Rob Zombie.  Which film, set in an American desert, does this refer to?", "correct": "The Devil's Rejects", "options": ["House of 1,000 Corpses", "Halloween", "The Haunted World of El Superbeasto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Devil's Rejects.\n\n\tReceiving the 2005 Scream Award for 'Best Horror Movie', \"The Devil's Rejects\" was a stylized approach to horror brought by Rob Zombie, who preceded this work with \"House of 1,000 Corpses\" in 2003.  The film was panned by a number of critics, although some said that the film still contained a good cast and story despite the graphic depictions.  Coming in just under $20,000,000 in the box office, but earning more than its predecessor, the movie was a financial success and made Rob Zombie one of the new faces of the horror genre.  He later followed up with reimaginings of the \"Halloween\" series.\r\"The Devil's Rejects\" follows three antagonists of the first film as they go on a killing spree through the desert of the southern States.  Against this barren backdrop, Zombie forces the trio to stick to their roots and evade the cops. \n"}, {"text": "This 2004 remake set mostly in a shopping mall doesn't see most of its horrors in the nighttime.  Instead, most exterior shots are completely set in the day.  As the characters find themselves on the roof of the building, zombies surround every entrance.  What movie is it?", "correct": "Dawn of the Dead", "options": ["I Sell the Dead", "Day of the Dead", "Land of the Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDawn of the Dead.\n\n\tBased on the original \"Dawn of the Dead\" created by George A. Romero in 1978, Zack Snyder's remake of the same name was surprisingly popular despite its deviations.  For example, the original zombie flick contained the walking dead while the new film featured \"28 Days Later\"-style running zombies (though no viruses... these people are completely dead).  Earning over $100,000,000, \"Dawn of the Dead\" became one of the more profitable zombie movies of the 2000s.  Like the original, survivors of the zombie outbreak hide out in a shopping mall planning their escapes and living day-by-day. No motorcycle gangs show up though. \n"}, {"text": "In this Tom Shankland film from 2008, two families head to a cottage for the holidays but discover a problem when the kids are infected by an odd sickness that motivates them to kill their parents.  What movie is this?", "correct": "The Children", "options": ["Outbreak", "Virus", "The Cottage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Children.\n\n\tReleased as part of the second batch of Ghost House Underground Films, \"The Children\" was released to UK theaters in 2008 to relatively positive reviews that praised the approach and style of this unique film.  In the movie, two couples and their children head to a cabin in the woods for their annual tradition. As the film progresses, the kids get sicker and sicker (though the parents don't really notice until it is too late).  On the second day, the parents find themselves face-to-face with their killers: their own children.  Much of the movie takes place during the day - the image of blood on the untouched snow comes to mind. \n"}, {"text": "Alice and her band of survivors are stuck crossing the Mojave Desert after Umbrella Corporation's outbreak in this third movie of the \"Resident Evil\" series.  What is this 2007 film's subtitle?", "correct": "Extinction", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nExtinction.\n\n\t\"Resident Evil: Extinction\", the third film in the \"Resident Evil\" series, starred Milla Jovovich (who also starred in the first two movies of the series) as a super-charged enigma with large weapons, and \"Heroes\" star Ali Larter.  Taking the film to the Mojave Desert (an environment unexplored in the games), \"Extinction\" brought many of the second film's characters, a couple of new creations, and a couple of familiar faces from the games together as they tried to cross the zombie-laden midwest to reach Alaska, an apparent safe haven. Directed by Russell Mulcahy (who also directed the \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" and \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" music videos), the film made an astounding $148,000,000 in the box office, more than the first two films.\n"}, {"text": "Infection is abound as a diseased dog spells doom for a group of college students spending a vacation in a cottage.

Five friends head to the backwoods for a trip together but things don't go as planned as a flesh-eating bacteria infect their water supply. As they frolick around the woods, spend time in the lake, and enjoy their vacation, they slowly acquire the infection and tensions begin to run high.  The film grossed over $30,000,000 in the box office becoming a financial success for newcomer Eli Roth (whose success allowed for \"Hostel\" to be greenlit).  A sequel, directed by \"House of the Devil's\" Ti West, was released in 2009 despite West's decision to abandon the film after creative differences. \n"}, {"text": "Broken Lizard's 2004 horror film set on a tropical island paradise involved a near-superhuman killer wielding a machete.  What is the name of the film?", "correct": "Club Dread", "options": ["The Island", "Island of the Dead", "House of the Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClub Dread.\n\n\tDirected by Broken Lizard member Jay Chandrasekhar and starring the comedy troupe, \"Club Dread\" was an obscure comedy/slasher flick released in 2004 to mixed reception.  One by one, a hooded killer stalks victims an an exclusive island getaway essentially designed for stereotypical, rowdy college kids.  The movie only recouped about 75% of its original budget and never really hit it big.  Nonetheless, Broken Lizard went on to film \"Beerfest\" as a follow-up. \n"}, {"text": "While the film took place over several days, much of this 2008 movie involved the main characters running from the wind.  What was the name of this Mark Wahlberg movie?", "correct": "The Happening", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Happening.\n\n\tDirected by M. Night Shyamalan, \"The Happening\" was regarded by the director as a well-made B-movie.  Critics, on the other hand, felt that the movie was simply poorly made.  In it, Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel spend a lot of time running from the wind as plant pheromones cause people to kill themselves in extremely graphic manners.  As the entire northeast corner of the United States fall victim to angry foliage, they find themselves running out of options.  Despite critical panning, the movie grossed $163,000,000 in theaters becoming one of the more popular titles of the summer. \n"}, {"text": "Released in 2007 as one of After Dark Horrorfest's 'Films to Die For', what film set in Mexico (under the sun) revolved around a sacrifice cult?", "correct": "Borderland", "options": ["Unearthed", "Tooth and Nail", "Frontiers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBorderland.\n\n\tBased on a cult dedicated to human sacrifice, the film took three students through a dangerous part of Mexico whereupon one of their group was abducted by cult leaders and drug smugglers.  Although the film loosely followed the true story of a cult leader known as 'The Witch Doctor', much of the movie was changed.  One of the few critically praised movies of the second After Dark Horrorfest series, \"Borderland\" starred Rider Strong and Sean Astin. \n"}]}
