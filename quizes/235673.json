{"id": "235673", "name": "Mumbo's Mountain Quiz | Banjo-Kazooie Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Banjo-Kazooie Games", "Banjo-Kazooie"], "questions": [{"text": "How many Jiggies are required to enter the Mumbo's Mountain stage?", "correct": "One", "options": ["None", "Two", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tOnce you find a single Jiggy in Gruntilda's Lair, you can add it to the Mumbo's Mountain picture on the wall and open up the area.  Only one Jiggy can be accessed in the beginning, and there's no way of taking the path to the left of the entrance without learning a certain skill in Mumbo's Mountain.  If you try to climb the path, you'll slide right back down. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Mumbo's totem pole?", "correct": "Juju", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJuju.\n\n\tJuju is found directly in front of Mumbo's first skull of the game and it holds one of those valuable Jiggies that you're trying to get your paws on.  To get the Jiggy, feed the spinning mouths some of your eggs (a technique you learn in this level) until you've cleared the platform.  Watch out though!  Leave one portion of Juju's head intact and jump on top of it.  Using this, you can reach a piece of empty honeycomb. \n"}, {"text": "Like in every stage, there's five Jinjos to collect.  Which coloured Jinjo can be found in one of the huts near Mumbo's skull?", "correct": "Green", "options": ["Yellow", "Blue", "Pink"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen.\n\n\tTo obtain this Jinjo, you'll need to learn a certain technique from Bottles that will allow you to jump and smash down certain objects.  If you smash down all of the huts surrounding Juju's platform, you can find Notes, Eggs, a Jinjo, and extra life, and a Jiggy.  Bottles will teach you the technique at the molehill closest to Mumbo's skull.  Other Jinjos can be found near the entrance, underwater, on the ruins, and on a ledge on a hill. \n"}, {"text": "Which is not a skill taught by Bottles in this level?", "correct": "Shock Jump Pad", "options": ["Talon Trot", "Egg Shooting", "Beak Buster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShock Jump Pad.\n\n\tThe Spring Jump Pad skill is taught in the second stage, Treasure Trove Cove, but the other three can be found throughout Mumbo's Mountain.  Talon Trot is learned next to the ruins and it will allow Kazooie to walk Banjo up steep cliffs.  Kazooie can learn how to use eggs near Conga's orange tree (and use them there to get a Jiggy) and Banjo can learn the Beak Buster move near Mumbo's skull to smash large objects. \n"}, {"text": "What type of fruit must you give to Chimpy?", "correct": "Orange", "options": ["Apple", "Banana", "Grape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrange.\n\n\tIn order to do this, you must climb Conga's tree for one of the large, delicious oranges and you must carry it over to Chimpy, who is sitting on his tree stump.  After handing it over, Chimpy will leave and the stump will rise allowing you to reach one of Bottles' molehills, a location where you could start getting another Jiggy, and a Mumbo Token. \n"}, {"text": "When the Grunty switch is hit in Mumbo's Mountain, where can you claim your prize?", "correct": "On top of the mountain in Grunty's Lair", "options": ["Underwater in Spiral Mountain", "Near the 50-Note Door", "In Banjo's house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn top of the mountain in Grunty's Lair.\n\n\tIn order to reach Grunty's Switch in this level, you need to make Chimpy's stump rise and jump on the platforms past the Mumbo Token.  You will need the Beak Buster move to hit the switch, so make sure you learn it first.  After you hit the switch, a Jiggy will appear on top of the mountain outside the level.  To reach it, you'll need to transform using Mumbo's magic.\rNOTE:  Leaving the stage will cause you to lose all Jinjos and Notes you gained in that level, though Notes will remain as a high score. \n"}, {"text": "How many Mumbo Tokens can be found in Mumbo's Mountain?", "correct": "Five", "options": ["Ten", "Two", "Seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive.\n\n\tAll five are needed if you want Mumbo to transform you into a termite.  Mumbo Tokens have been scattered throughout the level.  They are near Chimpy and Conga, Behind the pink Jinjo, under the stairs outside Mumbo's, in the termite mound, and behind the ruins.  Each time you visit Mumbo's hut throughout the levels, the total Tokens you need will increase, but luckily, they can be found in every world and Grunty's Lair. \n"}, {"text": "What does Mumbo transform you into in this level?", "correct": "Termite", "options": ["Monkey", "Ant", "Bee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTermite.\n\n\tThe termite is probably the weakest of the transformations since you can't attack in that form.  Despite this, you only need the creature to reach a couple Jiggies.  One is obtained by reaching the top of the termite mound.  This area can not be scaled using Kazooie's Talon Trot.  The second Jiggy is the one that was created by hitting the Grunty Switch.  Use the termite outside Mumbo's Mountain to reach the top of the mountain in the lair.  To change back into Banjo and Kazooie, return to Mumbo or leave the Mumbo's Mountain area of Grunty's Lair. \n"}, {"text": "One Empty Honeycomb is found overtop the platform containing Mumbo's totem pole.  Where is the other?", "correct": "In the cliff wall", "options": ["Behind the stage's entrance", "Underwater", "Near the ruins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the cliff wall.\n\n\tTo reach the Honeycomb Piece in the cliff wall, you can use Mumbo's termite transformation to easily climb down.  Once again, Kazooie's Talon Trot will not let you reach the area.  Since there are two Empty Honeycomb Pieces in every level, it's important that you claim each one.  To reach the second Honeycomb in Mumbo's Mountain, make sure you jump onto Juju before he's destroyed. \n"}, {"text": "Which is not the location of a Jiggy?", "correct": "Underwater in the pond", "options": ["In the eye of Mumbo's skull hut", "On one of the ledges on the hills", "In the ruins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnderwater in the pond.\n\n\tSince this is the first level of the game, many of the Jiggies are quite easy to find.  In fact a few of them are simply laying around (such as the ruins one and the one in the eye of the skull).  Some however, still require that you perform a certain task like shoot Conga with eggs or destroy Juju.  Like in every level, one Jiggy will be given if you collect the five Jinjos.  By the end of this level, you could have up to twelve Jiggies (counting the Grunty Switch Jiggy). \n"}]}
