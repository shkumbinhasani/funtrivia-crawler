As per usual, boredom is the topic of conversation.  The other topic is food, if you can call it that.  Hawkeye remarks that they have reached an anniversary.  According to Hawkeye, the same meal has been served how many days in a row?", "correct": "10", "options": ["15", "25", "50"], "explanation": "\n\n\n10.\n\n\tLiver or fish have been served 10 straight days in a row according to Hawkeye.  Trapper quickly retorts that it has actually been 11 days!  When the announcement comes up that lunch is now being served, Trapper's response is, 'They've got a lot of guts!'  Hawkeye cleverly replies, 'And they keep serving them.' \n"}, {"text": "Despite their severe misgivings over the utter lack of variety in their daily meals, Trapper and Hawkeye reluctantly make their way to the mess tent.  Prior to their entering, we see Klinger dressed in a snazzy, floor length gown, lovely head wrap and elbow length white gloves.  To top it off, he is wearing which other item that later plays a part in this episode?", "correct": "Fur stole", "options": ["Red high heel shoes", "Silk handbag", "Pearl necklace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFur stole.\n\n\tFor a man who is allegedly not insane, Klinger certainly pays attention to fineries!  Another oft-exhibited trait that tends to lend credibility to his worthiness of a Section 8, he guards his womens' clothing jealously, and is angered when any damage is done to his attire...as we shall soon see!  Radar's comment about Klinger's outfit is charming...'You look like my dead aunt.' \n"}, {"text": "One of the greatest 'M*A*S*H' speeches of all time takes place during this mess tent scene, with Hawkeye brilliantly defying the cooks who dare to serve which two offending items time and again?", "correct": "Liver and fish", "options": ["Creamed corn and chipped beef", "Succotash and mashed potatoes", "Sausage and hot dogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiver and fish.\n\n\tThe famous 'liver/fish' speech takes place in this episode.  Here's an excerpt, 'I simply cannot eat the same food every day!  Fish, liver, day after day!  I've eaten a river of liver and an ocean of fish!  I've eaten so much fish I'm ready to grow gills!  I've eaten so much liver I can only make love if I'm smothered in bacon and onions!' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye's speech inspires the entire mess tent to angry chanting, 'We want something else!  We want something else!'  Over the chanting, Hawkeye cleverly modifies a saying from which of these authors in order to further inspire his fellow M*A*S*H denizens?", "correct": "Karl Marx", "options": ["Mahatma Gandhi", "Thomas Jefferson", "Mark Twain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKarl Marx.\n\n\tHawkeye's version of Karl Marx's (and Friedrich Engels') famous admonition at the end of the 'Communist Manifesto' goes 'Draftees of the world arise, you have nothing to lose but your cookies!' \n"}, {"text": "After Hawkeye's tantrum in the mess tent he finds himself inevitably being chewed out by Henry Blake.  In the midst of a half-hearted tongue lashing from Henry, Hawkeye has a sudden, culinary idea.  Spare ribs is what he wants, and specifically ribs from a joint in Chicago called Adam's Ribs.  Of course, Hawkeye can't recall the name of the restaurant, but he does refer to a certain rail station in Chicago on which street?", "correct": "Dearborn", "options": ["Addison", "Joliet", "Wacker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDearborn.\n\n\tHawkeye does not know the phone number to the Dearborn Street Station, but Henry does...Dearborn 5-7500...for reasons listed below! \n"}, {"text": "Henry gives Hawkeye a little assist at this point, identifying the phone number to the rail station to which Hawkeye refers.  It seems that Henry has close links to this station; which significant event in his life occurred there?", "correct": "He went to the men's room alone for the first time", "options": ["He studied for his medical school finals", "He bought his first issue of Playboy magazine at the newstand", "He received his draft notice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe went to the men's room alone for the first time.\n\n\tAs 'M*A*S*H' fans are well aware, Henry was born and raised in Illinois, and went to school at the University of Illinois, so his ties to Chicago run deep.  These ties include the significant potty training event mentioned above!  Oh yes, perhaps more significantly, he met his wife Lorraine at the Dearborn Street Station too... \n"}, {"text": "Unable to sleep that night, Hawkeye decides that the time is ripe to awaken Radar and go to work on ordering some ribs!  Hawkeye's excitement leads him to cite some poetry about that 'toddlin' town' Chicago.  To which poet does he specifically refer during his eloquent description of the Windy City?", "correct": "Carl Sandburg", "options": ["Walt Whitman", "Ezra Pound", "Edgar Allen Poe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarl Sandburg.\n\n\tThe lines he cites from Sandburg...'Hog Butcher for the world, Tool maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler; Stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big Shoulders!'  Hawkeye adds his own lines...'Spare-ribber for the Universe!  Maker of Meat-on-a-Bone.  The home of the 'Pig-sicle'.  Give me your tired, your poor...your coleslaw.' \n"}, {"text": "While Hawkeye spouts poetry, Radar gets on the phone with his old pal Sparky.  He is able to finally get through to Chicago, via Tokyo, Honolulu and San Francisco!  Surprised, he hands the phone to Hawkeye, who proceeds to masquerade as a reporter for the Chicago Times.  What fictitious name does he choose?", "correct": "Cranston Lamont", "options": ["Bernie Kulwicky", "Blitz Cupertino", "Lafcadio Hearn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCranston Lamont.\n\n\tNaturally, Hawkeye can't simply state that he's a captain in the U.S. army stationed in Korea, he has to come up with a crazy, conniving plot.  He becomes Cranston Lamont, roving reporter, doing a story in Korea 'on our star-freckled spangled fighting boys.' \n"}, {"text": "After giving his specious pseudonym to the unwitting operator at the train station, Hawkeye manages to get the other fellow's name in return.  What is the name of this station operator with whom Hawkeye chats?", "correct": "Resnick", "options": ["Kultick", "Fosdick", "Chipwick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResnick.\n\n\tBernard Resnick.  According to Hawkeye, Resnick is a wonderful name, so wonderful in fact that it's the name of one of his daughters! \n"}, {"text": "Finally through his numerous machinations, Hawkeye procures the phone number for Adam's Ribs.  What is this divine number?", "correct": "5-2750", "options": ["5-7309", "5-7700", "5-8008"], "explanation": "\n\n\n5-2750.\n\n\tIn return for the phone number, Hawkeye blesses Mr. Resnick's 'choo-choos'.  He proceeds to call Adam's Ribs, commenting to Radar that they are 'approaching Nirvana'.  Radar replies, 'Is that close to Chicago?' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye finally reaches Adam's Ribs via the operator, and makes a take-out order.  Along with 40 pounds of their jumbo ribs, he orders a gallon of barbecue sauce!  Unfortunately, after hanging up, he realizes he has forgotten to order which essential item?", "correct": "Coleslaw", "options": ["Black-eyed peas", "Cornbread", "Hush puppies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColeslaw.\n\n\tThe neglecting of coleslaw is a shocking development, considering that Hawkeye mentions the delectable cabbage dish twice earlier in the episode!  (Once in Henry's office, comparing it to 'heather', and once while he is spouting poetry.) \n"}, {"text": "In the following scene, we see Hawkeye laying out the game plan for acquiring the ribs while reclining in the Swamp.  Several steps are cited in the process before a half-disgusted, half-intrigued Trapper critiques Hawkeye.  Finish the Trapper quote by choosing the term that goes in the following blank, \"What a picture you are of gluttony, greed, lust, ___________!\"", "correct": "Oral-sensation", "options": ["Hedonistic folly", "Epicurean tendencies", "Avarice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOral-sensation.\n\n\tDuring the early stages of the episode, Trapper behaves as his usual, cynical self.  However, as the reality of the ribs becomes more acute, he falls prey to these very tendencies that he has accused Hawkeye of harboring! \n"}, {"text": "The biggest stumbling block in the scheme to acquire the ribs is, of course, the process of delivering them to Korea.  The first person that is suggested to fulfill this portion of the plan is an uncle of which M*A*S*H dweller?", "correct": "Klinger", "options": ["Radar", "Henry", "Father Mulcahy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger.\n\n\tKlinger, who has angrily entered the Swamp to complain about succotash (and liver) on his lovely fur stole, also admits to having an uncle in Chicago.  When asked if his uncle would do him a favor, Klinger answers, \"He'd kill for me!  He'd kill for you!  For a hundred dollars, he'd kill for anybody!\"  Unfortunately, Klinger's price for getting his uncle involved is the signing of 'psycho discharge papers'.  When Trapper and Hawkeye decline, Klinger storms out...the search is still on! \n"}, {"text": "After some deliberation, it is finally decided that a former girlfriend of Trapper's will be the individual to pick up the ribs and deliver them to the airport.  Her first name is Mildred, but what is her surname? ", "correct": "Feeney", "options": ["Fenton", "Finch", "Fellini"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFeeney.\n\n\tMildred Feeney and Trapper once had a 'three-night stand' according to Trapper.  Her nickname for Trapper is 'Big John', a name which suitably impresses both Radar and Hawkeye! \n"}, {"text": "Just when we begin to imagine that Hawkeye is the biggest blowhard at the 4077th, Trapper does him one better.  He convinces Mildred, a woman he hardly knows, to deliver the ribs and sauce to the local airport, promising her a check in the mail in return!  True or false:  He also convinces Mildred that the ribs and sauce will be used to feed hungry children in Korea.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNo, Trapper is not that immoral!  Instead, he suggests that the ribs will be used for anatomy practice, because the army won't let them work on real people.  The barbecue sauce, we are told, will be used in place of blood!  To this, Mildred replies that she understands, to which Radar responds, 'Boy, she's smart.' \n"}, {"text": "Amazingly, Mildred, and the army, come through for our favorite M*A*S*H doctors.  However, they have one more obstacle to overcome, the ribs have been hung up in a supply depot in Ouijongbu.  What is the name of the particularly rude and territorial army major in charge of this supply depot?", "correct": "Pfiefer", "options": ["Tarola", "Goldman", "Abernathy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPfiefer.\n\n\tWhen Hawkeye and Trapper confront Pfiefer about getting their ribs and sauce, Pfeifer's first comment is about a 'cocky little nurse' at the 4077th that tried to 'muscle' him.  Hawkeye immediately identifies this 'nurse' as Radar.  Pfiefer is predictably uncooperative, but does refer the doctors to his 'boss', Sgt. Tarola. \n"}, {"text": "The final stop for Trapper and Hawkeye is at the desk of a Sgt. Tarola, an officer equally territorial but not quite so rude.  Initially Tarola is uncooperative with the doctors, claiming that they have neglected which important document accompanying their 'supply' request?", "correct": "S-47/19-J", "options": ["X-47/63-B", "C-38/19-L", "S-53/25-J"], "explanation": "\n\n\nS-47/19-J.\n\n\tWithout an S-47/19-J accompanying, they don't even go to latrine down at the supply depot at Ouijongbu, according to Tarola! \n"}, {"text": "Realizing that they will have to play hardball with Tarola, the doctors quickly hatch another scheme.  They will shut down the supply depot, posting it as a contagious area.  Tarola appears to show symptoms of the plague, according to the doctors.  Which of these is not a 'symptom' they observe?", "correct": "Breathing in-and-out with irregularity", "options": ["Sweating", "Slurring of the 'S' in the word 'sensational'", "Eyes blinking in an up-and-down motion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBreathing in-and-out with irregularity.\n\n\tThis is Tarola's cracking point, he decides to play ball, asking, 'What's in the box?'  When he discovers that the box contains Adam's Ribs, he announces that he is from Joliet and that he would 'walk to Chicago on his knees in the snow for a takeout order.'  To this Trapper responds, 'He's one of you!' \n"}, {"text": "Not only does Tarola play ball with the doctors, he bargains with them for a cut of the action.  Haggling results in what final amount, in pounds, for Tarola?", "correct": "12 pounds", "options": ["20 pounds", "10 pounds", "5 pounds"], "explanation": "\n\n\n12 pounds.\n\n\tTarola initially wants 20 pounds and a quart of sauce, to which Hawkeye responds '10 and a pint'.  Tarola's final offer is for '12 pounds, and a pint and a half...and cole slaw!'  Of course, Hawkeye forgot to order coleslaw, which he shamefully admits to Tarola.  Tarola responds, 'You sent all the way to Chicago for ribs, and no coleslaw?'  Hawkeye responds, 'Forgive us, we're draftees.' \n"}, {"text": "Yes or no: At the end of the episode Hawkeye and Trapper sit around a table with Henry, Radar and Klinger.  Do we ever see them dig into the ribs?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tBy far the most frustrating point in the show...why couldn't they have just had a little taste?  Instead, it's annonced that choppers are in the compound and that all personnel are required to assist.  The ribs are left on the table in the mess hall.  I like to think that Hawkeye ordered Goldman and Igor back to the mess tent to refrigerate the ribs, reheating them only when the O.R. session is over...yes, that's how the story really ends.  Well, at the very least, that's how this quiz ends...I hope you enjoyed! \n"}]}
