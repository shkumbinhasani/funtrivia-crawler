{"id": "341502", "name": "\"Rumours\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of Brittany's new internet talk show?", "correct": "Fondue for Two", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFondue for Two.\n\n\tBrittany claims that this show brings her two favourite things, hot melted cheese and talking to people, together at last and her first guests are Mercedes and Tina (even though it sort of opposes the title of the show).  The gossip on the show takes a turn when Brittany reveals that Santana 'plays for the other team'.  Of course, this tidbit takes a back seat when Brittany allows her cat, Lord Tubbington, to eat the fondue cheese straight from the pot since he's on the Atkins Diet.\rRachel speaks to Sam and gives him the gift of Lip Chap since many make fun of his particular facial feature.  She also asks if he'd like to go to prom with her but he denies her request, claiming that she's not his type. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the McKinley High newspaper?", "correct": "The Muckraker", "options": ["The Paper", "The McKinley Messenger", "The Weekly Blab"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Muckraker.\n\n\tSue and Terri visit a coffee shop for a quick meeting pertaining to their next plan of action (although Sue is dressed as David Bowie to stay in touch with the enemy).  She states that many organizations have been felled in recent years by the website 'Wikileaks' and taking advantage of the power of the rumour would be beneficial to their cause. For this reason she's resurrected the school newspaper, The Muckraker, despite its dissolving due to lack of interest years ago.  Along with Jacob Ben Israel, Brittany appears on the news team which is dedicated to its lack of hard-hitting facts; Sue calls for an 'if I heard it it's probably true or something' attitude towards the paper. Sue changes her outfit to Ann Coulter before sitting down with Terri (claiming it's because she's become unhinged).  Terri says that she'd rather take Will out of the Glee Club than break it down from within and she and Sue get thinking. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of April's musical?", "correct": "Crossrhodes", "options": ["Rhodes to Nowhere", "The Horse You Rhodes in On", "All Rhodes Lead to Rhome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrossrhodes.\n\n\tWill looks up from his test marking to find April Rhodes at his office door.  She's back in town because her all-white rendition of \"The Wiz\" flopped on Broadway and she's writing her own musical about herself entitled \"Crossrhodes\".  She also states that she'll need the auditorium she bought for the Glee Club, at least for a little while.\rThe first new issue of the Muckraker is released and it spreads like wildfire.  Rachel alerts Finn to an article pertaining to himself and Quinn suggesting that Quinn has been going out with Sam behind his back.  Santana is also angered by the paper because it spreads the rumour that Brittany noted on her show (about 'playing for the other team') although Brittany says it's because she used to be with the Cheerios as well as Glee.  Will is forced to break up any fights before practice. \n"}, {"text": "Will and April duet to which of the following songs from the \"Rumours\" album?", "correct": "Dreams", "options": ["Gold Dust Woman", "Oh Daddy", "Second Hand News"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDreams.\n\n\tAt Will's place, April 'makes' dinner (consisting of a bottle of wine).  He decides to tell her that she should base her show around her own emotions and she compliments him on being a good teacher.  He says that he's been having problems however; the kids in Glee Club keep fighting and getting into love triangles and issues of sexuality. April says they've got a case of the 'Mac' as they fight and channel their issues into good music like Fleetwood Mac.  Will decides to base his week's lesson on the Fleetwood Mac album \"Rumours\" and he and April duet to \"Dreams\" to introduce it to the kids.  Will tells the kids that it's time to work together. This week they'll need to take their own songs from the album and put original spins on them. \n"}, {"text": "Who stakes out a motel with Finn?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Artie", "Kurt", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tArtie decides he needs to talk to Brittany about her relationship with Santana and he discovers that Santana may be manipulating their own relationship to break them apart and get what she wants.  Artie decides that he doesn't want that because he values their being together too much.  When Brittany continues to say that she and Santana aren't doing anything bad, he says that she's being stupid and she leaves saddened; she never thought he would be the one to call her that.  Emotionally slighted, Artie sings Fleetwood Mac's \"Never Going Back Again\" with Puck, Sam, and Finn all backing on guitar.\rAt the American Family Hotel, Finn and Rachel perform a stake-out to ensure (for Finn's sake) that Quinn and Sam aren't going out.  While they watch, Kurt emerges from a room with Sam.  Elsewhere at the motel, Jacob Ben Israel snaps photos of this rendezvous. \n"}, {"text": "What song does Santana sing to Brittany in the choir room?", "correct": "Songbird", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSongbird.\n\n\tMany of the members of Glee Club gather for coffee and discuss the Sam situation and none of them can figure it out.  Quinn decides to tell everyone that despite what they saw, Sam is not gay and he is not seeing Kurt.  She leaves to avoid dwelling on the subject.\rIn the choir room, Santana tries to cheer Brittany up.  To do this, she uses the \"Rumours\" album and sings \"Songbird\" to her.  Brittany asks why she couldn't sing it in front of everyone and Santana says she's not ready, especially since people have been treating her differently already.  Brittany says that she'll invite her onto 'Fondue for Two' and ask her out to prom; all she needs to do is say yes.  Santana agrees to this.\rIn the halls, Rachel watches Sam walk past wearing one of Kurt's jackets and she approaches him about it.  Kurt doesn't say anything because that's part of this week's lesson.  When Fleetwood Mac made \"Rumours\", they only talked about the music and not their personal lives.  Glee Club needs to focus on the music for Nationals and not this stupid gossip.\rThat night, Finn and Rachel reappear at the motel to investigate and they find Quinn leaving the same room with Sam. \n"}, {"text": "Who interviews Will for the school paper?", "correct": "Brittany", "options": ["Jacob Ben Israel", "Sue", "Becky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrittany.\n\n\tBrittany asks Mr. Schue to be her first interview for The Muckraker and he agrees.  The interview, however, turns into another gossipy questioning session in which Brittany asks questions that are both offensive and concerning.  Her final question about leaving new Directions to join April Rhodes on Broadway forces Will to dig deeper to find out the truth behind what's really going on.  It doesn't take long for him to discover that it was Sue's idea.  He approaches her after teaching her staff about making stories up and she suggests that maybe all this time he could do something worthwhile with his life.\rAt the school, Quinn reads The Muckraker and discovers that Rachel and Finn were spending time together.  He explains that he was staking out the motel and found out the she was spending time with Sam as well.  She says he'll need to trust her and he asks for the same treatment.\rThe two of them decide to sing \"I Don't Wanna Know\" in the choir room.  After the song ends, Rachel says that she prefers Sam's duet with Quinn over Finn's and this is the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Quinn decides that she doesn't want Rachel singing with Finn whatsoever and if he does, their relationship is over. \n"}, {"text": "Does Will tell Emma that he wants to perform on Broadway?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tEmma walks in on Will and April performing a number from her new show in the auditorium and the number turns out quite well.  She begs him to come to Broadway with her and he says he can't; he has to take the kids to Nationals.  She says that now's his chance; Nationals is their dream and his is to go to Broadway.  After all, they're still performing on the same stage they did when they were in high school.\rBrittany has her next episode of 'Fondue for Two' and it turns out that Santana couldn't attend.  Instead she sent a message saying 'I can't'.  Brittany interviews Lord Tubbington instead and chastises him on-camera for starting smoking again.\rWill talks to Emma in the lounge and finds that she's been making progress with her OCD.  She says that he took hold of her destiny because of him and she wants him to feel the same.  She encourages him to say yes to Broadway because he deserves it.  He continues to say no because he can't do it to the kids and because he doesn't want to lose her or the Glee Club even though he wants to go so badly. \n"}, {"text": "Who invited April Rhodes back to Lima, Ohio?", "correct": "Terri", "options": ["Sue", "Emma", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerri.\n\n\tRachel is the next to perform and she chooses to sing \"Go Your Own Way\" with Finn on the drums.  The song is clearly aimed towards him and Quinn is visibly distressed.  When the song ends, Quinn says that her song choice is a bit inconsiderate before some of the kids start inquiring about Sam's secrets.  He finally reveals the truth: Kurt was bringing him clothes and Quinn was helping him babysit.  He's been living in the motel, in the one room, with his family because his dad lost his job and the family lost their house.  He leaves the choir room frustrated.\rSue, Terri, and April have a meeting in Sue's office.  It turns out that Terri called April up to convince her to persuade Will to go to Broadway and leave the school (so she could get their old apartment back).  April says that it's unlikely he's coming since he can't leave the kids and Sue says that The Muckraker will be running a story about Will's probable departure so that no one has to break the news.  April finds this to be a bit shady.\rRachel and Finn show up at the motel to speak to Sam about what went on and he lets them in.  Sam's brother and sister join them in the room as they discuss what's going on.  It turns out that they moved from Tennessee after a good job offer but after the recession hit they lost it all.  Finn gives Sam some of his clothes and they urge him to stay with Glee Club since he's important to them. \n"}, {"text": "The Glee Club buys Sam which of these items to help him through his rough times?", "correct": "Guitar", "options": ["Drums", "Yearbook", "Bed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuitar.\n\n\tFinn and Rachel reveal that they bought back Sam's hocked guitar because they want to help him get back on his feet; they just want him to stay with the Glee Club.\rThe next day, Santana informs Jacob Ben Israel that she and Karofsky are still going strong as a couple and in their campaign for Prom King and Queen, much to Brittany's disappointment.  In the choir room, the club reads The Muckraker's story about Will's departure.  He tells them that the lesson of the week is not to believe everything you hear and that his biggest dream is to take them to Nationals.  Sam arrives at the choir room with his brother and sister and asks that they be a part of their next number, \"Don't Stop\", which they all perform this optimistic song together in the Auditorium with Sam on his guitar. \n"}]}
