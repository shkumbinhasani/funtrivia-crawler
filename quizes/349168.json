{"id": "349168", "name": "Survivor: All-Stars Quiz | Survivor: All-Stars | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Survivor", "Survivor: All-Stars"], "questions": [{"text": "In the beginning of this season, Jeff surprised the All-Star castaways with the news that there would be three tribes competing.  Which was not one of them?", "correct": "Lopevi", "options": ["Mogo Mogo", "Saboga", "Chapera"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLopevi.\n\n\tReturning to the Pearl Islands for the eighth season of \"Survivor\", a group of eighteen All-Stars from the previous seven seasons set foot on their new home for the next thirty-nine days.  The Saboga tribe in yellow, the Chapera tribe in red, and the Mogo Mogo tribe in green, they were initially split up with only a canteen per person (and a machete at their camp) and they were not told about the other castaways in the game (nor the fact that there would be three tribes).  Only one would make it to the end of the game to become the Sole Survivor. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 4, teams received boxes sealed with three padlocks.  What was inside these crates?", "correct": "Rice", "options": ["Blankets", "Immunity", "Matches"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRice.\n\n\tAlthough Rob M. from Chapera wanted to smash the box, all castaways held off until further notice.  After the next Reward Challenge (won by Saboga), Jeff gave the option of taking blankets back to camp with them or getting a flint and steel, a pot, and a clue to the first key to unlock the box.  The catch: all three teams would get the flint, pot, and clue.  They decided to go for it.  Chapera opened their box shortly after the third Reward Challenge having claimed all three keys.  After the first Reward Challenge, the winning team(s) automatically received clues to their keys. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these castaways quit \"Survivor: All Stars\"?", "correct": "Jenna M.", "options": ["Rob C.", "Richard", "Ethan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJenna M.\n\n\tOn Day 9, Jenna M., the winner of \"Survivor: Amazon\", decided to remove herself from the game.  Stressed with the competition and surviving the elements, Jenna opted to return back to the United States to be with her dying mother.  When reunited with the rest of the castaways after the show finished airing, she revealed that she returned shortly before her mother passed away.\rOn Day 16, Sue (from \"Survivor: Borneo\") decided to quit the game before the Reward Challenge due to anxieties she experienced in a previous challenge.  Richard Hatch, performing in the nude, brushed up against her and psyched her out enough to force her to leave (even though he was eliminated in the days prior). \n"}, {"text": "On Day 13, what one of the original three tribes dissolved into the other two?", "correct": "Saboga", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaboga.\n\n\tHeading to the Reward Challenge on Day 13, the three tribes arrived with newly-built rafts to discover that the third-place (last) team to arrive at the finish line would be dissolved into the other two via a schoolyard picking scheme.  Saboga lost the task so two members, Ethan and Jerri, went with Mogo Mogo, while Jenna and Rupert ended up going back to the Chapera camp.  Mogo Mogo's decision was purely tactical; they could decide, with majority, when to send Ethan home. \n"}, {"text": "\"All-Stars\" received a unique immunity idol consisting of two separating halves.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOn Day 3, teams came into their Immunity Challenge to find that while they were split into three teams they would be fighting for one of two halves of the Immunity Idol.  The top half would be the player element, a wooden female figure.  The bottom half, a wooden whale, would represent the environment.  In challenges, the two leading tribes would take their half back to camp while the third place team would go to Tribal Council.  When Saboga was dissolved, the idol pieces fit together with a block holding them together and became winnable by only one team, Chapera or Mogo Mogo. \n"}, {"text": "Which castaway was the only one who remained on the same tribe until the merge?\n(Hint: Said castaway was always on Chapera.)", "correct": "Amber", "options": ["Jenna", "Alicia", "Kathy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmber.\n\n\tIn a surprise twist on Day 22, both tribes gathered for a Reward Challenge but were instead told that they would be drawing new buffs at random to determine new tribes.  In an unprecedented surprise, four members of Chapera became the new Mogo Mogo while the four members of Mogo Mogo joined Amber, the only one to draw a red buff, at the Chapera camp.  Only a few days later, the merge occurred but not before Rob M. convinced Lex to save Amber from the vote in exchange for protection.  Jerri ended up getting the boot instead, becoming the ninth to leave the game. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the merged tribe created on Day 26?", "correct": "Chaboga Mogo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nChaboga Mogo.\n\n\tShortly after tribes were mixed up in a surprise twist on Day 22, the two tribes discovered that the merger was at hand as well.  On Day 26 they officially became Chabogo Mogo, consisting of two original Saboga members, three Mogo Mogo members, and four from Chapera.  The name Chaboga Mogo was, obviously, a portmanteau of all three.  The Chaboga Mogo tribe wore blue, the only basic colour not used for the original tribes.  Gathering on the old Saboga beach, the final nine castaways needed to create a whole new camp. \n"}, {"text": "How many Sole Survivors from previous seasons wound up in the jury?", "correct": "None", "options": ["One", "Two", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone.\n\n\tAlthough four winners from the previous seven seasons were a part of the \"All-Stars\" game, all four were voted out or quit before the merge.  Tina Wesson (winner of \"Survivor: The Australian Outback\") was the first person eliminated.  Jenna Morasca (winner of \"Survivor: Amazon\") quit on Day 9.  Richard Hatch, winner of \"Survivor: Borneo\", was the third winner to go - he was ousted on Day 15.  Ethan was the final winner to leave the game (on Day 21); he won \"Survivor: Africa\".  Many players were under the impression that a winner should not end up taking home the million a second time. None of them did. \n"}, {"text": "During the final Reward Challenge of the game, how many castaways went home with new vehicles?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Four", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tAs is typical of the final Reward Challenge of a season, the participants revisited elements of past challenges used earlier in the game in order to win a large vehicle.  Boston Rob became the winner of the GM Chevrolet Colorado truck presented, narrowly beating out Amber at the finish.  As an added bonus, Rob was able to bring one other player with him to a drive-in movie in his new car; he chose Amber to join him for a showing of \"Lord of the Flies\".  Since he chose her, she also ended up winning a car - she was shocked to find that she would be receiving a Malibu Maxx. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these castaways became the Sole Survivor and million-dollar winner of \"Survivor: All Stars\"?", "correct": "Amber", "options": ["Rupert", "Rob M.", "Jenna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmber.\n\n\tAfter an emotionally-charged final Tribal Council in which a number of the jury members were disgusted with the finalists' journey to the top, Rob and Amber received their votes and a winner was crowned.  Although Rob received votes from Jenna, Rupert, and Kathy, Amber ended up getting four, one each from Shii Ann, Lex, Tom, and Alicia.  Amber took home the million dollars and a brand new car (a Chevy Equinox) to gift to another player.  She gave this to Shii Ann due to a crucial vote in the final ceremony.  In a surprise, before the votes were read, Rob proposed to Amber and she said yes.\rOne week after the finale, after a nationwide vote, Rupert became the winner of an additional million dollar prize by becoming the most popular player of the \"All-Stars\" season.  He did not become Sole Survivor, however. \n"}]}
