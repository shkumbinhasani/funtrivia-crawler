{"id": "378095", "name": "Have Guild, Will Travel - Guilders Favourites Multiple Choice Quiz | Geography | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Geography - Miscellany"], "questions": [{"text": "A little piece of heaven is how Sister Seagull would describe his favourite place, the area around the small German town of Saint Goar.  Sandwiched between the River Rhine and the hills of the Hunsruck, Saint Goar is dominated by which medieval castle?", "correct": "Burg Rheinfels", "options": ["Burg Drachenfels", "Mauseturm", "Lorelei"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurg Rheinfels.\n\n\tSaint Goar, or Sankt Goar, is typical of many of the towns and villages located in the narrow Rhine Gorge, stretched out along the narrow flood plain on the eastern bank beside the great river which here is little more than 250 yards or so wide.  \r Founded in around 550CE when a hostel for the poor and weary travellers was built here, Saint Goar is the perfect base for anyone visiting and exploring the historic UNESCO World Heritage Site that is the Rhine Gorge.  Towering above the town are the ruins of Burg Rheinfels which was founded by the Counts of Katzenelnbogen in around 1245 CE.  Burg, or Schlo\u03b2 Rheinfels as it is also known, fell into ruin after its partial destruction by French Revolutionary forces during the late 18th century.  Restored after it had been acquired by the Prussians in 1834, Burg Rheinfels is now home to one of the finest hotels in all Germany.  \r Just a short drive to the south and on the opposite bank of the Rhine is the famous precipice known as the Lorelei.  Like the Siren of ancient Greek myth, a beautiful maiden sat singing atop the cliffs here at the Rhine's narrowest point and lured unwary river travellers to their deaths on the dangerous reefs below. \n"}, {"text": "Agony loves to drive, especially on almost empty, well-maintained, modern highways through breath-taking scenery.  One of her favourites is the David Thompson Highway.  \n\nWhere is the David Thompson?", "correct": "Western Canada", "options": ["Southeastern US", "Scotland", "Brazil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWestern Canada.\n\n\tI hope the name was a clue - David Thompson was a map-maker, surveyor and fur trader in northwestern North America in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  He mapped nearly four million square kilometers of wilderness in his years with the Hudson Bay Company and North West Company.\r The David Thompson Highway runs from central Alberta into the Rocky Mountains.  My favourite portion is the 180 kilometers from the town of Rocky Mountain House to the intersection with the Icefields Parkway, which is the highway from Banff to Jasper that runs through the heart of the Rockies.  I don't really understand why this wonderful stretch of road is so underused when other highways into the mountains are crammed with cars and RVs all summer, except that it might be because it doesn't lead to a town, just dead-ends at the Parkway.  \r A few years ago we were driving down the highway about fifty kilometers east of the Banff Park gate when we saw a few cars stopped on the shoulder.  This is a good indication of wildlife near the road, so we slowed.  A mother black bear and her two cubs were maybe thirty feet off, eating berries and playing in the open scrub nearby.  We sat there for nearly half an hour, and no more than a dozen more cars came along in that time, all of which also drifted to a stop and stayed to watch the cubs play.  Alas, eventually some bozo came screeching along, slammed to a stop and leapt out of the car, camera in hand. With one cough from the mother, all three bears instantly disappeared. \n"}, {"text": "It took George Washington Vanderbilt Junior six years between 1889 and 1895 to build what became the largest privately owned house in the USA. Which house is this?\n", "correct": "Biltmore House", "options": ["The Breakers", "Springwood", "Sans Souci"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBiltmore House.\n\n\tThe Biltmore House was designed by Richard Morris Hunt and was patterned after the chateaus of Chambord, Blois and Chenonceaux. The house is a popular tourist destination and winery. Biltmore puts on a lavish Christmas display every year.\r Ertrum was happy to visit Biltmore House, but he wouldn't want to live there. \n"}, {"text": "Stedman likes to get away from it all on holiday, and has a soft spot for this small British island in the Bristol Channel, which measures three miles long and half a mile wide. What is its name?", "correct": "Lundy", "options": ["Skye", "Iona", "Jersey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLundy.\n\n\tThere's not really much on Lundy; a church, a pub, a farm, and a number of old buildings (including a lighthouse and a castle) that have been converted into holiday accommodation. Access during the summer months is generally by passenger ferry (there are no roads as such) and in winter by helicopter. If you want to find out more, you might want to have a look at the quiz I wrote about it! \r Of the incorrect options, Jersey is the largest of the Channel Islands and is located off the French coast of Normandy. Skye and Iona are both Scottish islands. \n"}, {"text": "Mask had a really great time visiting this vibrant European metropolis where he visited the Rijksmuseum.  Cycling is really popular here which helps keep people fit.  Mask also enjoyed seeing the beautiful canals and the lifelike wax figurines at Madame Tussaud's museum. Which city did I visit?", "correct": "Amsterdam", "options": ["Brussels", "London", "Sheffield"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmsterdam.\n\n\tAmsterdam is the capital city of the Netherlands, though its seat of government is at The Hague. The Rijksmuseum is located at the Museum Square, known locally as 'Museumplein', which is also home to the Van Gogh Museum.  The Rijksmuseum has an extensive collection of arts and historical artefacts and the famous Dutch painter Rembrandt's painting, 'The Night Watch' is on display here.\r Amsterdam has an extensive canal network which stretches for hundreds of kilometres.  The best way to see and enjoy its majestic views is from one of the numerous tour boats operating around the canals of Amsterdam.  The famous Madame Tussaud's museum which originated in London also has a branch in Amsterdam.  Its collection of lifelike wax figurines of famous people includes politicians, artists and sports stars, all of which are simply breathtaking.  \r Brussels is the capital of Belgium, a small country bordering the Netherlands; the cities of London and Sheffield are both to be found in England. \n"}, {"text": "\"Oh Edinburgh!\nI love each cobbled street\nFrom the grandeur of your Old Town \nTo the rain-soaked roads of Leith...\"\n\nEdinburgh, Scotland's capital, is darksplash's favourite place.  It was traditionally Scotland's top tourist attraction; but if you visited this city, which of these would you not be able to see?", "correct": "The Royal And Ancient Golf Club", "options": ["A Royal palace", "An extinct volcano", "A Royal yacht"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Royal And Ancient Golf Club.\n\n\tEdinburgh's Castle's sits atop an extinct volcano; The Royal Yacht Britannia, now decommissioned as the floating 'home' of the British Royal family, is moored in the Port of Leith; Queen Elizabeth II holidayed at the Palace of Holyrood House.  It is located at the foot of the famous Royal Mile, which runs uphill to the castle.\r The Royal And Ancient Golf Club is regarded as the spiritual home of golf.  It is located at St Andrews, near Dundee.\rThe lyrics in the question are from Canadian comedian Sean Cullen's song \"Oh Edinburgh!\"  This is an irreverent and a sometimes affectionate song that pokes some fun at the city.  (The quoted lyrics have also been amended slightly: the original may be considered a little rude...) \n"}, {"text": "Australia is a big country and has many 'big' places you can visit. Two examples are the 'Big Banana' in the east, and the 'Big Rocking Horse' in the south.  Sectant's favourite is way up north on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. It has a massive replica of a fruit at its front, a fruit Aussies put on their pizzas.  It also has a section of tropical rainforest you can walk through and other fun things to inspect. What is this popular tourist attraction called?", "correct": "Big Pineapple", "options": ["Big Apple", "Big Fig", "Big Peach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig Pineapple.\n\n\tThe Big Pineapple is perhaps the most famous of the 'big' places to visit in Australia. The pineapple replica at its front is huge; you can even climb up, down and around inside it!  The cafe there makes monumentally scrumptious sundaes. There is also a little zoo with animals you can pet.  When Sectant was there, a cute little pony and a cute little donkey kept following him around. Just as well there were no tigers or fifty-foot snakes!  \r The Big Banana is in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales and is more of the same really, with just a different fruit out front!  The Big Rocking horse is in a little country town in South Australia called Gumeracha, not too far from Adelaide. The site is a toy factory and the rocking horse is very, very big.  It's an iconic South Australian construction but way too high to sit and rock on it. There were fears that the horse and the toy factory, in fact the entire township, were on the way to being ruined by the 2015 bushfires; fortunately, those brave firefighters saved the day.  \r Surprisingly, there is also a 'Big Apple' in Australia; it's located at Batlow, NSW but it's considerably smaller than New York City!  The Big Fig and The Big Peach could be mafia dons or exotic nightclubs in some equally exotic city...Or maybe not? \n"}, {"text": "TemptressToo likes to tango, dreaming of one day visiting the birthplace of Argentina's version within a multi-cultural city known for music, architecture, and good air.  Which city would I be visiting?", "correct": "Buenos Aires", "options": ["Santa Fe", "Mar del Plata", "C\u00f3rdoba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuenos Aires.\n\n\tBuenos Aires is the capital and largest city of the South American country of Argentina.  The country itself boasts a dazzling array of culture and architecture, as well as breath-taking natural beauty spanning the spectrum from sand to ice.\r The tango became an Argentine affair in the mid-19th century, first seen among the working class of the city of Buenos Aires.  Originally, it was danced primarily by men only, but expanded in popularity rapidly.  It can be seen everywhere in the city sometimes between random couples, others in large masses of dancers (milonga). \n"}, {"text": "Mask also likes to travel to exotic places. Which of these countries would Mask be in if he were to see the Statue of the Reclining Buddha, enjoy shopping in an area where goods are sold on boats, have a good time enjoying the country's many beaches and lastly, can spend a day having fun with and learning about the mighty Asian Elephant?", "correct": "Thailand", "options": ["Vietnam", "Cambodia", "Singapore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThailand.\n\n\tThailand was formerly known as Siam and is located in Southeast Asia.  It is certainly one of the more exotic places in the world with many sights and activities to do. Starting off, we go to the temple known as Wat Pho located in Bangkok where the statue of the Reclining Buddha is located. The statue's posture is like that of a sleeping or reclining lion; the Buddha deep in meditation while the image itself represents Buddha's entry into Nirvana where the cycle of reincarnation ends.  The corridor where the statue is found has 108 bowls which represent the 108 positive characteristics of Buddha and visitors are known to drop coins in them for good luck, money which the temple monks use to maintain the Wat Pho complex.  \r There are a number of floating markets in Thailand at which vendors sell their goods from boats.  Local Thai produce is mainly found here and you should aim to get there in the morning to avoid the rush and preferably bring a camera to capture the beauty of these markets.  Thailand is well endowed with beaches and some of the more iconic ones are Pattaya and the Hua Hin resort town.  The elephant is the national symbol of Thailand and the best place to spend the day learning about Asian elephants is at the Elephant Nature Park at Chiang Mai District.  In this park, we get the opportunity to observe these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat.  It is also possible to feed and bathe them and to learn why their numbers are dwindling in the wild.  Overall, it's a pleasant experience and one should definitely visit this park on their next visit to Thailand.  \r Cambodia and Vietnam are both neighbours of Thailand, while Singapore is the world's only island city-state. \n"}, {"text": "Machu Picchu, one of CellarDoor's favorite places, is also a favorite worldwide. In what mountain range may this ancient Incan city be found?", "correct": "The Andes Mountains", "options": ["The Sierra Madre Mountains", "The Rockies", "The Atlas Mountains"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Andes Mountains.\n\n\tThe Andes Mountains run up the length of South America, near the Pacific coastline. Machu Picchu -- perhaps a city, perhaps more of a royal estate along the lines of Versailles -- sits in the Peruvian highlands, 2,430 meters (7,970 feet) above sea level. Built circa 1450 and abandoned in 1572, it came to Western attention in 1911 and has since become globally recognized as a cultural treasure and a UNESCO World Heritage site.  It is impossible to do justice to the site in text.  Incan architecture, relying on a precise form of dry-stone masonry with incredible resilience against earthquakes, is magnificent even in ruins.In early morning the mist rises out of the Urubamba River Valley below, drifting across the terrace walls, up the stairways, and into the temples... And if that weren't enough, CellarDoor visited Machu Picchu on her honeymoon, so its place in her heart is assured. \n"}]}
