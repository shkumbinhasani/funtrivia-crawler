A wordwise is a question where you say what you see.  For instance, if you saw \"10SNE1,\" that is \"Tennis, anyone?\" 10-S is tennis, N-E-1 is anyone.  Are you ready?  Ok!\n\nBRAIN TEASERS:\n\nturdchickenuckkey", "correct": "Turducken", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurducken.\n\n\tA turducken is a poultry dish.  It is a turkey that is stuffed with a duck, that is stuffed with a chicken, that is stuffed with stuffing.\r The word chicken is in the word duck.  This is in the word turkey.  Therefore, there is a chicken in a duck in a turkey, which is what a turducken is. \n"}, {"text": "ANIMALS: Not necessarily an animal, but it relates to animals.\n\ntariff\nomy", "correct": "Taxonomy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTaxonomy.\n\n\tTaxonomy is the classification of animals.  This means you separate them into classes.  For instance, Canidae, or canine, include wolves and domestic dogs, and Felidae, or feline, include tigers and house cats.\r A tariff is a tax, and \"tax is on omy,\" so \"tax on omy,\" or \"taxonomy.\" \n"}, {"text": "CELEBRITIES: Movie star\n\nHere is a bit of a stinker, beware!\n\nEmmylou\nGerald", "correct": "Harrison Ford", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarrison Ford.\n\n\tHarrison Ford is most noted for playing Han Solo in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, and Indiana Jones in the \"Indiana Jones\" trilogy.\r This was a tricky one.  Emmylou Harris is a singer, and Gerald Ford was a president.  I thought \"Harris On Ford\" was too easy, so thus we get \"Emmylou on Gerald.\" \n"}, {"text": "ENTERTAINMENT: Comics\n\nuPts", "correct": "Peanuts", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeanuts.\n\n\t\"Peanuts\" is a comic strip which features Charlie Brown and Snoopy.  It began in the 50s.\r The teaser reads as \"P in Uts,\" sounding it together makes \"'Peanuts!'\" \n"}, {"text": "FOR CHILDREN: Toys\n\nlolinkgs", "correct": "Lincoln Logs", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLincoln Logs.\n\n\tLincoln Logs were invented in 1916 by John Lloyd Wright.  The toys allowed children to build things out of logs, to create cabins, houses, or anything one could think of.  The Lincoln Logs interlock so they don't fall about too easily.\r You read this as \"link in logs,\" and sounding that out is \"Lincoln Logs.\" \n"}, {"text": "GENERAL: Science\n\nHmm, you can do basically anything for general.  Here you go!\n\npale e\nOGY", "correct": "Paleontology", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaleontology.\n\n\tPaleontology is the study of fossils.  Paleontologists delicately unearth ancient bones and other fossils and study them to learn about the past!\r \"Pale e\" was on \"ogy.\"  The \"ogy\" was in all caps, therefore, it was a \"tall ogy.\"  That means that \"pale e is on a tall ogy,\" or \"pale e on tall ogy,\" which makes \"paleeontallogy,\" spelled correctly is \"paleontology.\" \n"}, {"text": "GEOGRAPHY:\n\nTexasVermontUtahColorado", "correct": "United States of America", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnited States of America.\n\n\tThe United States of America gained independence in 1776.  The flag is of thirteen red and white stripes, representing the original thirteen colonies, with a blue box in the top left corner with fifty white stars inside.  The fifty stars represent the fifty states.\r Texas, Vermont, Utah, and Colorado are all states of America.  They are all together, thus they are unified, or united.  Therefore, the teaser shows them as \"united states of America,\" which is the full name of the US.  Therefore, your answer should have read \"United States of America.\" \n"}, {"text": "HISTORY: 20th century\n\n*DENT*", "correct": "Great Depression & The Great Depression", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreat Depression & The Great Depression.\n\n\tThe Great Depression began in 1929, in October, actually, in the United States, although it spread to most of the entire world.  It lasted through most of the 30s, and when all was well, war broke loose during WWII.\r Notice that \"DENT\" is large, therefore, it is a \"great depression.\" \n"}, {"text": "HOBBIES: Collecting\n\nfillLE", "correct": "Philately", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhilately.\n\n\tPhilately is the studying of postage stamps.  It is interesting to know that a philatelist does not necessarily collect stamps, but they study them.  Of course, some do collect them.  In fact, stamp collecting is simply known as stamp collecting.\r I hope this was a stinker.  \"Fill\" is by \"LE,\" or \"Fill at L E.\"  This makes \"philately.\" \n"}, {"text": "HUMANITIES: Mythology\n\nth\ngod of", "correct": "God of Thunder", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGod of Thunder.\n\n\tThor is the God of thunder.  He wields a mighty hammer.\r You read this as \"god of under th,\" or \"god of th under.\"  Therefore, combining the \"th\" with the \"under\" makes \"thunder,\" which gives \"god of thunder.\" \n"}, {"text": "LITERATURE: Children's book\n\nti~me", "correct": "A Wrinkle in Time", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Wrinkle in Time.\n\n\t\"A Wrinkle in Time\" was written by Madeleine L'Engel, who died in 2007.  \"A Wrinkle in Time\" was the first book of a series of books following the travels of Meg, her little brother, Charlie, and Mrs. Which, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Whatsit, although each character does not necessarily appear in each book.\r That little symbol within the word \"time\" is called a tilde.  A tilde is like a dash, or a -, but wrinkled up.  Therefore, there is a \"wrinkle\" in \"time,\" which is a book title, \"A Wrinkle in Time.\"\r I apologize if you got this wrong because you said \"THE Wrinkle in Time,\" but that is NOT the title of the book. \n"}, {"text": "MOVIES:\n\n80dthworldeays", "correct": "Around the World in 80 Days & Around the World in Eighty Days", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAround the World in 80 Days & Around the World in Eighty Days.\n\n\t\"Around the World in 80 Days\" has been made into movies several times, and include several spoofs, like \"Alvin and the Chipmunk's\" spoof.  The story follows Phileus Fogg travelling around the world in a hot air balloon, and only in eighty days!\r \"The\" is around \"world,\" which is in \"80 days.\"  Therefore, \"the around world in 80 days,\" or \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" \n"}, {"text": "MUSIC:\n\n--L--\n-I-E-\n--F--\n\nPlease, ignore the dashes.", "correct": "Circle of Life & The Circle of Life", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCircle of Life & The Circle of Life.\n\n\t\"The Circle of Life\" was a song written for the movie \"The Lion King.\"  The movie begins with this song, with all the animals waking up.\r \"Life\" is written in a circle, therefore it is a \"circle of life.\" \n"}, {"text": "PEOPLE: Royalty\n\ncPRe\n\nl\nl\ni\nf", "correct": "Prince Philip & Prince Phillip", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrince Philip & Prince Phillip.\n\n\tPrince Phillip became the husband of Queen Elizabeth II on November 20th, 1947.  He was born in 1921.  In 1997, Prince Phillip and Queen Elizabeth II celebrated their 50th anniversary!\r This was a bit trickier.  \"Pr\" is in \"ce,\" or \"pr in ce,\" or \"prince,\" and \"fill\" is written upwards.  Therefore, \"pr in ce, fill up,\" or \"prince fillup,\" which, written correctly, should read \"Prince Phillip.\" \n"}, {"text": "RELIGION: Bible\n\n3, 4, 8, 32, 14, etc.", "correct": "Numbers", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNumbers.\n\n\tNumbers is a book of the bible.  It is the fourth, after Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus.  It precedes Deutoronomy.  The first five books are collectively known as the Torah, the Penateuch, or the Five Books of Moses.\r Here I have given a list of numbers, therefore you read them as \"numbers.\" \n"}, {"text": "SCI/TECH:\n\nArgon, Oxygen, Gallium, *?*", "correct": "Element of surprise & the missing element", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nElement of surprise & the missing element.\n\n\tSo, \"element of surprise\" is not a phrase of science and technology, but I used chemical elements in the question.  An element of surprise is something you didn't expect, therefore, a surprise.\r A list of elements appeared, followed by one you didn't know about.  Therefore, what replaces that question mark is a surprise, called the \"element of surprise.\" \n"}, {"text": "SPORTS:\n\nla x", "correct": "Lacrosse", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLacrosse.\n\n\tLacrosse is a sport played in many parts of the world.  It involves making goals, like soccer, but you must throw and catch balls with netted sticks.\r You might read this as \"la x.\"  An \"x\" is a \"cross,\" so it reads as \"la cross,\" and when combined, you get \"lacrosse.\" \n"}, {"text": "TELEVISION: Show within a show\n\nScrewdriver 3:42AM", "correct": "Tool Time", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTool Time.\n\n\t\"Tool Time\" is a television show about men and their tools.  It is hosted by Tim Taylor, who is played by Tim Allen, and co-hosted by Al Borland, who is played by Richard Karn.  The show is shown within the show \"Home Improvement.\"\r Here I gave you a tool, which is a screwdriver, and a time, which is 3:42AM.  Therefore, you read it as \"tool, time,\" or \"Tool Time.\" \n"}, {"text": "VIDEO GAMES: Series/character\n\nabcdinoto", "correct": "Crash Bandicoot", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrash Bandicoot.\n\n\t\"Crash Bandicoot\" is a series of video games on several game stations, including the PS2 and the Wii, but it began solely on the Playstation.  It follows the character Crash Bandicoot through adventures in his land, to save Wampa Island from evil Dr. Neo Cortex.\r \"Bandicoot\" was \"scrambled,\" or \"crashed,\" therefore, you \"crash bandicoot.\" \n"}, {"text": "WORLD: Magazines\n\ngeogr\u00e1fico, geografiskt, geographisch, g\u00e9ographique.", "correct": "National Geographic", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNational Geographic.\n\n\t\"National Geographic\" is a science magazine.  It studies many things from animals to world history.\r I made the word \"geographic\" go international.  Geographic was spelled in Portuguese, Swedish, German, then French.  Therfore, I made national \"geographic,\" or \"National Geographic!\"\r I hope you enjoyed my quiz.  Hopefully, it was difficult, but not too difficult.  We needed some more tough wordwise quizzes!  Thanks for playing and please rate it. \n"}]}
