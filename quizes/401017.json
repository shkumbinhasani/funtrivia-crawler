{"id": "401017", "name": "The Joli Llamas Arrive at 'A' Quiz | Alphabetics | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "      Alphabetics", "A"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these ancient Greeks is a philosopher who has an Antarctic mountain range named after him?", "correct": "Aristotle", "options": ["Aeschylus", "Alcibiades", "Aristophanes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAristotle.\n\n\tThe Aristotle Mountains are located on the Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost extension of Antarctica which is separated from Tierra del Fuego (the southernmost part of South America) by the Drake Passage. They were named after Aristotle in acknowledgement of the fact that he had predicted the existence of a large southern polar land mass, which he called Antarctica, in his book 'Meteorology', written in the fourth century BCE. While he is most often referred to as a philosopher, that term covers a much wider range of intellectual investigations than is usual in its modern usage. In fact, what we now consider Science was then considered Natural Philosophy - considering the way the physical world works.\r As well as the Aristotle Mountains, Aristotle has a crater on the moon named after him, but using a variant form of his name, Aristoteles. Aeschylus is known as a writer of tragedies, Aristophanes a writer of comedies, and Alcibiades a political leader.\r All thanks go to Looney_Tunes for this question. \n"}, {"text": "The lesser known Biblical character of Ananias is associated with which major event in the New Testament?", "correct": "Conversion of Saul", "options": ["Stoning of Stephen", "Jesus' baptism", "Accusation of Mary Magdalene "], "explanation": "\n\n\nConversion of Saul.\n\n\tAnanias is mentioned in the Book of Acts. When Saul is on his way to Damascus to persecute the Christians, he is blinded by a light. Jesus calls out to him saying, \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\". Saul is unable to see, though the people travelling along with him do not experience anything similar. Saul then spends three days in Damascus, stricken blind. Jesus then speaks to Ananias, telling him to go and lay hands over Saul. Ananias also baptizes Saul, who later goes by the name of Paul. Despite his early role in persecution of the new Christians, Paul turns out to be one of the foremost of the apostles in spreading the Gospel, especially to Gentile nations.\r This question was submitted by zorba_scank. \n"}, {"text": "A well known rock and roll singer from the late '50s to the '70s, Marty Wilde achieved considerable success all over the world, but one of his most popular songs described an outing to which Welsh town?", "correct": "Abergavenny", "options": ["Aberystwyth", "Aberdovey", "Aberaeron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbergavenny.\n\n\tWhile all of the choices listed would make a good day out, it was Abergavenny which inspired Marty Wilde. Situated at the confluence of the rivers Usk and Gavenny, Y Fenni, as it is known in Welsh, is a busy little market town with beautiful views of the Black Mountains which surround it. Well worth a visit, especially during the hugely popular food festival which takes place annually in early September.\r This question came from MaggieG. \n"}, {"text": "Defined as \"of, like or pertaining to the order of the alphabet; rudimentary,\" which of these sesquipedalian words would be the apropos selection?", "correct": "abecedarian", "options": ["arundinaceous", "adventitious", "allochthonous"], "explanation": "\n\n\nabecedarian.\n\n\tIt's right in the word, spelled out to say it: ABCDarian. There's nothing quite like making a word actually make sense when you create it. 'Abecedarian' is from the Latin term 'abecedarius,' which meant 'of the alphabet.'\r The other word definitions:\r adventitious - 'accidental; casual'\rallochthonous - 'formed or produced elsewhere or externally'\rarundinaceous - 'like or having the properties of a reed'\r Question by reedy (which is why I chose arundinaceous as an option). \n"}, {"text": "Which official Disney princess was first to appear in a feature film?", "correct": "Aurora", "options": ["Alice", "Anna", "Ariel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAurora.\n\n\tAlthough all of these Disney characters are referred to as princesses at some point or another (whether in their movies or in other media like the \"Kingdom Hearts\" video games), Aurora and Ariel are, technically, the only ones to be part of Disney's official princess line which commenced with Snow White in 1937.  Aurora, seen in \"Sleeping Beauty\", was the first of these options here (and the third princess overall), debuting in 1959.  The next would be Ariel from \"The Little Mermaid\" in 1989.  Alice would have been the first of these options, having appeared for the first time in 1951, but she was never on the official listing.  Neither was Anna, Elsa's sister from \"Frozen\".\r This question was assembled by Kyleisalive. \n"}, {"text": "What is the 'A' first name of 'The Last Airbender' as featured in \"Avatar\"?", "correct": "Aang", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAang.\n\n\tWhile the title of the show, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" may lead casual TV Guide flippers to assume the show is about a boy named 'Avatar', any viewed episode should lead you to the answer as 'Aang', a boy who must harness the powers of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water to excel in his role as the Avatar, a figure of power and balance.  In the sixty-plus episodes of the show, split across three seasons (known as 'Books'), Aang must learn from all kingdoms to defeat the evil Fire Lord and protect the world.\r This question comes from Kyleisalive!  Yip yip! \n"}, {"text": "Musician Kevin Smith had a hit in 1986 with the song \"Amityville (House on the Hill)\".  Under which name did he release the track?", "correct": "Lovebug Starski", "options": ["Krazylegz Krane", "Roachford", "MC Hammer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLovebug Starski.\n\n\tStarski is one of two New York DJ/MCs credited with coining the term Hip-Hop.\rDuring his career he released several album and singles, including \"Positive Life\" which was sampled on the global hit \"Pump up the Volume\" (M/A/R/R/S 1987).\r Rowena8482 would like to make it clear that she never, ever, ever attempted to dance to this song at the school disco! Honestly!) \n"}, {"text": "His birth name was Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo. He began his film career in 1963 and hit his stride on television in the 1970s. By what name is he better known?", "correct": "Alan Alda", "options": ["Woody Allen", "Danny Aiello", "Don Ameche"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlan Alda.\n\n\tAlan Alda was the son of Alfonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo, who worked in burlesque theatres under the stage name of Robert Alda. 'Alda' is a portmanteau combining the 'AL' in Alfonso with the 'DA' in D'Abruzzo.\r Thus, Alan simply carried on the tradition already established by his father.\r Alan's career began on stage in the 1950s, and he made the transition to film with 1963's \"Gone Are the Days!\" But his fame truly arrived when he was cast as Dr. Benjamin 'Hawkeye' Pierce in the (1972-83) television show \"M*A*S*H\" (taking on the role originally portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1970 film).\r reedy, who grew up watching \"M*A*S*H\" in syndication, crafted this question. \n"}, {"text": "Which Roman Catholic Pope was previously the Archbishop of Buenos Aires?", "correct": "Pope Francis", "options": ["Pope Pius X", "Pope Benedict XVI", "Pope John Paul II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPope Francis.\n\n\tJorge Mario Bergoglio was born to Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was ordained as a Catholic Priest in 1969 and appointed as the Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. In 2013, he was elected to the head the Roman Catholic Church as the Pope. Upon election, he took on the papal name of Pope Francis. His papacy had many firsts including the first Jesuit to be elected Pope, the first Pope from the Americas, and, the first Pope from the Southern Hemisphere.\r Zorba_Scank contributed this question and hopes to travel to Buenos Aires someday. \n"}, {"text": "There are four American states that start with A.  Which one is both part of the contiguous 48 and is NOT landlocked?", "correct": "Alabama", "options": ["Arizona", "Alaska", "Arkansas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlabama.\n\n\tOf the four, Alaska and Alabama aren't landlocked; Arizona and Arkansas are.  Alabama is nearly trapped in there though-- only sixty miles of Gulf of Mexico coastline exist in the state with the rest stretching up into the Bay of Mobile.  Mobile is the only large city on this coast and, for the sake of knowing its location, it's on Interstate 10 between New Orleans, Louisiana to the west and Pensacola, Florida on the panhandle to the east.\r Alaska is non-contiguous, so it doesn't count for the question, but for reference's sake, it has 6,640 miles of coastline (the most of any state).  That's more than a hundred times the distance of Alabama's coast.  But then again, Arizona and Arkansas have none, so maybe it's not so bad.\r This question was attached by Kyleisalive. \n"}]}
