This was also the episode that George befriended an Albanian, to make it easier to tell him he would be demoted.  The man knew how much Max wanted a super ball.  George and Max spent a while on eBay looking for a super ball, and they bid against someone else until they paid $60 for it.  Later, the Albanian man came for dinner and gave Max a present. He said it was a super ball he got at a garage sale for $5.  He tried to get it on eBay, but some idiot bid $60.  When Max and George got the super ball, they ran outside, opened the box, and threw it down at the picnic table so it would bounce high in the sky.
