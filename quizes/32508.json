'Broken tables form a home for a horse.'", "correct": "stable", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nstable.\n\n\tTables=stable \n"}, {"text": "How about this one?

'Moistens part of steward's back.'", "correct": "wets", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nwets.\n\n\t'Stew'= wets \n"}, {"text": "OK, now for some more complex clues.
