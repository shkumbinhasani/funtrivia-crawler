The popular sports drink was developed at a university in Florida, where the sports team's nickname is the Gators. Located in Gainesville, Florida, which school is it?", "correct": "University of Florida", "options": ["Florida State University", "University of Florida\t", "University of South Florida", "Bethune-Cookman University"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUniversity of Florida.\n\n\tDeveloped by scientists at the University of Florida in 1965, the drink was designed to help replenish the water, carbohydrates and electrolytes the school's athletes lost through sweat while playing.

Over the next 182 calendar days, Jennings won 75 consecutive matches, having his streak paused for \"Kids Week\" and \"Jeopardy!\"'s annual \"College Tournament\". Jennings lost to Nancy Zerg, who ended up losing on the next episode. Jennings won $2,522,700 on the show, and has appeared as a guest on many other game shows since. \n"}, {"text": "G is for Grapes. There are a myriad of varieties of grapes, but can you tell me which one of these, also a song from a famous musical, is a variety of grape?", "correct": "Edelweiss", "options": ["Anjou", "Bartlett", "Bosc"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdelweiss.\n\n\tEdelweiss is a relatively new variety of grape developed to bear the winters of the higher latitudes. It is a popular grape of the Midwestern regions that have slowly converted some of their topsoil to vineyards. The other three choices (Bosc, Bartlett and Anjou) are types of pears. \n"}, {"text": "G is for Gravity.  Gravity is a force which acts between all masses in the universe. All masses? Why, then, don't you feel a force attracting to the computer monitor sitting in front of you?", "correct": "Gravity is a relatively weak force, and other forces like friction are counteracting it", "options": ["The computer's exerting an opposite force, pushing you away, according to Newton's Third Law", "You can only be attracted to one object at a time, and right now, it's planet Earth", "Gravity only works in the vertical direction, not horizontally"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGravity is a relatively weak force, and other forces like friction are counteracting it.\n\n\tGravity is one four fundamental forces of nature (the others are the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces), and is by far the weakest such force. Scientists are also busy searching for the hypothetical \"graviton,\" the particle that would mediate the gravitational force, but they haven't found it yet.\r Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation provides for all objects in the universe to attract one another. The magnitude of the gravitational force is given by GMm/r^2, where M and m are the masses of the object in question, r is the distance between them, and G is a proportionality constant. The reason that you're not feeling your monitor's gravitational attraction is that that proportionality constant is very small: about 6.67*10^-11 m^3/kg*s^2. A one hundred kilogram person would be attracted to a one-kilogram computer monitor 1 meter away with less than a billionth of a newton of force, which you just can't feel. Air resistance and friction would prevent that collision from happening any time soon. On the other hand, with very large masses, like the Earth itself, the magnitude of gravity is big enough to make you feel its force, directed downward toward the Earth's center. \n"}, {"text": "G is for Gulliver, the eponymous traveler in Jonathan Swift's well-known 1726 satirical work. Gulliver travels to strange, fantastical lands like Lilliput and Brobdingnag, but he also makes a voyage to a real-life country, where he refuses to trample on a crucifix. To which of these nations, also the setting for \"The Tale of Genji,\" does he go? ", "correct": "Japan", "options": ["India", "China", "Egypt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\tJonathan Swift's best-known work is probably \"Gulliver's Travels,\" about Lemuel Gulliver's voyages to unbelievable lands. Each locale satirizes a different part of humanity and society, while still managing to be riotously funny. Gulliver goes to Lilliput, land of tiny men, who are feuding with a neighboring island Blefuscu over the proper way to crack an egg.Then he goes to Brobdingnag, where the tables are turned: the inhabitants there are giants. On his third voyage, Gulliver visits the flying island of Laputa, which consists of philosophers and scientists, but no real practical thought. He island-hops around, eventually landing in Japan, with the aforementioned anti-Christian sentiment, and transiting from there to England.Finally, on his last trip, Gulliver goes to Houyhnhnms, which is inhabited by intelligent horses and their dull humanoid servants, the Yahoos. When Gulliver makes it back to England, he's understandably fed up with human society, and prefers the company of horses instead. \n"}, {"text": "G is for Guinea.

And that is pretty much all they have in common! Guinea is a French-speaking country on the Atlantic Coast, and the largest of the three Guineas. The capital is Conakry, and it had 9.4 million people in the country in 2012. Guinea-Bissau borders Guinea to the northwest, and has an Atlantic Ocean border.A Portuguese-speaking country, it is the middle of the Guinea's in size. Then there is Equatorial Guinea, farther south on the African continent, located on the--yep you guessed it--Gulf of Guinea. The capital is Malabo, and French, Spanish and Portuguese are the official languages.\n"}, {"text": "G is for the Golden Globes.
