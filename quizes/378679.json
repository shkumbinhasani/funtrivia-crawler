The sealed-off wing remains open and what she believed-- that Valentino and Rambova had disappeared without her-- was wrong.  Additionally, Will Drake plans to make changes to the lobby of the Hotel Cortez to accommodate what will surely be a lavish wedding ceremony.  Will wants excess, but Elizabeth wants quiet intimacy.  Fortunately, she's easily able to convince him to change his mind.\rAt the front desk, The Countess asks Liz to have flowers delivered by Wednesday and assures him that Tristan never knew how to love.  Liz, fed up with what his boss has done, refuses outright. \n"}, {"text": "Where does a private investigator locate Rudolph Valentino?", "correct": "A motel", "options": ["A train station", "A movie theater", "An alleyway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA motel.\n\n\tWhile the news on TV reports of corpses appearing exsanguinated throughout the city, The Countess receives a phone call from a private investigator; he's found Valentino at a motel.  She heads over directly, embracing her past lover in an instant.\rThat night, Elizabeth lets Donovan return to her penthouse suite for the night and he implores that she take him back monogamously.  She swears that she will uphold monogamy and trust him, but she can't have anything out of line.  First she has to get married on Wednesday, then she needs to become a widow on Thursday.  Then, they'll make a list. \n"}, {"text": "Upon being asked by The Countess, who does Iris claim let Bartholomew escape?", "correct": "Ramona", "options": ["Alex", "Donovan", "Holden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRamona.\n\n\tA trio of pornographic filmmakers fulfill their reservation at the Hotel Cortez, checking in and getting to work up in one of the rooms.  Iris, originally one to allow it to be done in the rooms upstairs, decides that she no longer wants people displaying such a poor attitude in her hotel.  She heads upstairs and murders the three of them to drain their blood. Donovan walks in on her cleaning up and congratulates his mother for finally coming into her own.  She urges Donovan to leave since The Countess was very much aware of Bartholomew's disappearance and she had to reveal it was Ramona Royale's doing. Both of them remind each other not to let things get too far out of hand. \n"}, {"text": "Who warns Will Drake not to marry The Countess?", "correct": "Miss Evers", "options": ["His son", "Iris", "Alex"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiss Evers.\n\n\tWill and his son get dressed in tuxes for the upcoming wedding and eagerly anticipate the upcoming ceremony, but their father-son moment is interrupted by an angry Miss Evers who insists that Will must certainly be looking to commit suicide; as soon as The Countess puts the ring on his finger, she claims, she will most certainly need to dispose of him by bleeding him dry. Miss Evers was originally supposed to marry Mr. March but he loved her instead.  She leaves at Mr. Drake's request, but says that she eagerly awaits the day she's proven right because it'll be the day she steps in to clean the blood from his formalwear. \n"}, {"text": "The Countess decides to build a secure space in the hotel under the guise of which of these?", "correct": "An archive for Will Drake's works", "options": ["A gallery for fine art", "A seance room", "A safe for jewels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn archive for Will Drake's works.\n\n\tThe Countess has an estimate made on the hole into the previously-sealed wing of the hotel and asks that a security door, including cameras, be added to the hall to ensure its safety; she does this under the guise of building an archive for Will's works.  Unfortunately, she also needs it done by the next day, and not a week from now like the contractor says.  When Elizabeth starts to argue with the man, Mr. March comes out to assist her, much to her ire.  She demands that he never speak to her again, considering what he did to the people she loved.\rDonovan shows up at Ramona Royale's mansion with dinner to inform his partner that The Countess has taken her back.  They decide that tonight must be the night they strike; she's distracted by the wedding.  The only problem is that he can't pull the trigger. \n"}, {"text": "Ramona Royale's father was best with which of these afflictions?", "correct": "Alzheimer's", "options": ["Lou Gehrig's Disease", "Parkinson's", "Diabetes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlzheimer's.\n\n\tDonovan is still worried that Ramona is untrustworthy, but she says that The Countess caused her great despair after killing her man.  More than twenty years ago, Ramona went back home to her father, who she hadn't seen in ten years.  She stayed for a few months, but it became apparent that something was wrong. Her mother passed away one night after a long-standing illness, and her father descended into Alzheimer's.  One night, when two men started to rob their house, he was attacked and nearly killed.  She fed him her blood but it didn't save his brain; he survived in a physical sense, but never went back to his old self. He couldn't hunt, so Ramona had to for him.  When the robbers came back, years later, he was able to fight back and Ramona had to kill him.  She drowned him in the tub to put them both out of misery.  When she realized what she had, Ramona decided that she needed to ruin The Countess once and for all. \n"}, {"text": "Alex is able to track down the kids she tangentially infected.  Who are they killing when she finds them?", "correct": "A pizza delivery boy", "options": ["Their families", "An elderly man", "A cop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pizza delivery boy.\n\n\tAlex watches as the pizza guy arrives at a household and lets herself inside a minute behind him.  Walking in, she finds the party of bodies in one of the back rooms, and the murderous children inside, feeding on their latest victim.  She introduces herself and Max is among them.  As it turns out, they've killed all of their parents in an attempt to stave off their measles, and after four days, some of them haven't been feeding. Alex recognizes the return of the infection in some of them.  Now that they've killed a pizza delivery boy, people will likely come and find them.  She decides to invite them to the Hotel Cortez where they can be safe, but they leave instead. \n"}, {"text": "Ramona betrays Donovan to help The Countess.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDonovan checks in on The Countess, who he drugged, and Ramona brings a dagger in to stab her in the heart.  At the last minute though, The Countess awakens and Donovan tasers Ramona, knocking her out cold.  Soon after, he and Iris bring Ramona down to the newly-renovated wing of the hotel outfitted with cameras and UV-lit cages.  There, behind the security doors, they can imprison their enemies.  Iris is disappointed that Donovan has opted to side with The Countess since it'll likely end with him dying.  Ramona, regaining consciousness, says he should listen to his mother. \n"}, {"text": "Natacha Rambova found it easier to cope with the modern world, apparently, when The Countess gave her which of these?", "correct": "Credit card", "options": ["Cell phone", "High heeled shoes", "Immortality"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCredit card.\n\n\tThe sun shines over the Los Angeles motel where Rudolph Valentino is staying.  The Countess, visiting, pours both of them a glass of wine.  Natasha is nowhere to be seen; Elizabeth gave her her credit card and, as it would seem, the modern world is delighting her to an extreme.  Fortunately, it's giving The Countess the opportunity to spend more time alone with Rudolph, who she's wanted to replicate the entire time he was gone. She has a plan though-- they can reclaim their happiness, bring the Drake inheritance, and make the Hotel Cortez a fortress against the modern world.  Natacha returns at that moment with her shopping in tow; Elizabeth invites her-- not Rudolph-- to the Cortez later that night. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills Will Drake?", "correct": "Ramona", "options": ["The Countess", "Donovan", "Mr. March"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRamona.\n\n\tNight comes quickly, and before anyone knows it, The Countess and Will Drake are exchanging their vows in a small ceremony in the Hotel Cortez lobby.  Liz immediately objects, since she is the only witness present, but Elizabeth urges the minister to carry on anyways.  While Will goes off to the bar to get a drink to celebrate the nuptials, Elizabeth tells her maid of honour that perhaps, one day, true love will appear for her too.\rUp at the bar, Will pours himself a glass and turns to find Mr. March at a seat.  March toasts to Will's good fortune and speaks about the progressive nature of the blended family.  It's fortunate, Will says, that she loves his son...but James is referring to Bartholomew.  He brings the new husband up to Room 64 to witness his new step-child, and after some harsh words, The Countess steps in to knock him out, opting for the chance to put her plan into motion then and there.  Will wakes up shortly after, on the floor in the sealed wing of the hotel.  When he gets up, Will frees Ramona from her cage, but she's too weak to move.  He heads down to the security door to find it locked, and when he turns around, Ramona seizes the opportunity to regain her vitality.  She slits his throat and gorges on the blood while Miss Evers watches down the hall.  From the comfort of her penthouse, The Countess watches the murder on her camera feeds. \n"}]}
