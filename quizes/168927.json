{"id": "168927", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Nurses' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 5 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "The operating room is a difficult place to work in this episode.  Lack of water and supplies has turned the members of the 4077th rather cranky, and tempers are building.  Margaret and her nurses are not getting along, and Nurse Preston in particular angers Margaret with her 'insubordination' towards Frank.  Which of these is not an area of contestation between Nurse Preston and Frank?", "correct": "She accidentally jabs Frank in the finger with a scalpel", "options": ["She calls Frank 'Mister' in response to his rantings", "She corrects Frank about 'hot flashes' being a symptom, and not a disease", "She gives Frank a hemostat, just what he asks for, but he claims otherwise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe accidentally jabs Frank in the finger with a scalpel.\n\n\tSomething tells me that Frank's problems are not caused by the outdoor heat!  Nurse Preston draws clean-up duty in the operating room for her 'indiscipline'.  Margaret also pounces on Preston for having allowed the 4077th to run out of 2.0 silk.  It seems to me that Margaret is being unreasonable, especially since Frank started the brouhaha. \n"}, {"text": "Following the O.R. session we see the nurses gathered in their tent having a jolly good time.  What type of sweet are they preparing in their tent?", "correct": "Fudge", "options": ["Peanut brittle", "Pudding", "Toffee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFudge.\n\n\tThough it's extremely hot outside, the nurses are content to cook hot fudge...in a helmet of all places!  When Margaret enters the tent she smells the fudge and immediately reminds the nurses that cooking is against regulations in personnel quarters.  Rules, rules, rules! \n"}, {"text": "Margaret enters the nurses tent with orders for her nursing staff.  Her arrival brings a great deal of contention as Margaret finds it necessary to point out all the regulations the nurses are breaking.  Which of these criticisms by the nurses gets Margaret particularly upset?", "correct": "They suggest that her hair is not naturally blonde", "options": ["They insinuate that Margaret is still having an affair with Frank", "They point out that Margaret frequently drinks off duty", "They raise the question of Margaret's excessive eating habits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey suggest that her hair is not naturally blonde.\n\n\tAfter noticing the fudge, Margaret turns to Nurse Gaynor, who is clearly drunk, and insists that drunkenness is against the rules.  She then turns to Nurse Walsh and accuses her of stealing peroxide from the supply tent.  Preston points out that Margaret is not a natural blonde, and Nurse Baker exacerbates the situation by claiming that Margaret's hair is actually gray...ouch! \n"}, {"text": "Nurse Baker has been placed on report and confined to her quarters for insubordination, following her and her fellow nurses' confrontation with Margaret.  This proves very inconvenient when her husband, a G.I., suddenly shows up at the camp.  Radar is able to sneak Baker out of her quarters and over to the Swamp, where Hawkeye and B.J. reveal her husband in a 'game show' format.  Which game show do they mimic?", "correct": "This is Your Life", "options": ["64-Thousand Dollar Question", "What's My Line?", "Jeopardy!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThis is Your Life.\n\n\tNurse Baker's husband's name is Tony, a sergeant in the army who has recieved a 24-hour pass.  Hawkeye and B.J. concoct a plan that will allow Baker and her husband to spend the evening in the 'Olive Drab Room of the Continental Korean Plaza, overlooking the fabulous latrine!', even despite Baker's current punishment. \n"}, {"text": "With Margaret approaching, Hawkeye hammers a 'quarantine' sign on the door of Margaret's tent.  After rather skeptically questioning the good doctor, Margaret resigns herself to Hawkeye's shenanigans.  She insists, however, that she needs her things.  The ever-prepared Radar has already obliged in this matter.  He has gotten her toothbrush, 'jammies' and 'one of [her] slingshots'.  What, exactly, is a 'slingshot' in Radar-speak?", "correct": "Gartar belt", "options": ["Whip", "Bra", "Girdle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGartar belt.\n\n\tMargaret's response to Radar's generous gesture: 'You jerkface!  That's my gartar belt!'  'I'm sorry ma'am, I try not to look at your unmentionables,' responds Radar.  Some people just have no appreciation for Radar's elocutionary skills! \n"}, {"text": "Margaret brings the hijacking of her tent to the attention of Colonel Potter.  Potter insists on knowing what sort of disease the doctors believe is the problem for the young soldier.  B.J. answers that they have narrowed the possibilities down to either typhoid or...?", "correct": "Schistosomiasis", "options": ["Cryptosporidiosis", "Blastomycosis", "Chikungunya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSchistosomiasis.\n\n\tSchistosomiasis (aka Bilharzia), according to Potter, is contracted by millions of people each year who 'wade waste-high in the River Nile.'  It is caused by blood flukes.  Needless to say, the Colonel is rather skeptical of B.J.'s diagnosis, since schistosomiasis is a tropical disease.  After Potter's suspicious response, they decide on typhoid. \n"}, {"text": "Much to the nurses chagrin, Margaret has been forced to move into their quarters due to the quarantine on her tent.  Hawkeye and B.J. attempt to remedy this situation by convincing Frank to invite Margaret over to the Swamp for a 'little Apache dance'.  Does Frank agree to their plan?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tOf course not, Frank is never agreeable when you want him to be.  Frank does want Margaret's attention, but he wants her to be the one to come to him, not vice-versa.  His exact words, 'When I see her crawling across the compound on her hands and knees, you know what that'll mean?  It'll mean that she's *almost* ready.  Till then, no dice!\" \n"}, {"text": "The nurses go to sleep early, forcing Margaret to do likewise.  After everyone is asleep, Baker sneaks out of the tent so she can be with her husband.  She encounters Klinger on watch duty, but bribes him with which of the following items in return for his silence?", "correct": "Lavender peasant blouse", "options": ["White high-heeled shoes", "Silver necklace with cameo", "Red chemise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLavender peasant blouse.\n\n\tIn addition, Klinger requests the matching scarf, and the deal is done! \n"}, {"text": "In one of my all-time favorite scenes with Margaret, she once again confronts her nurses, but this time the tables are turned.  The nurses again list their grievances, but Margaret finally reveals why she is so upset with them.  Which of these does Margaret not bring up as a reason for her bitter behavior towards her nursing staff?", "correct": "They never sit with her in the mess tent or at the movies", "options": ["They've never offered her a 'lousy cup of coffee'", "They don't include her in 'one of their little bull sessions'", "They have never asked her help with personal problems"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey never sit with her in the mess tent or at the movies.\n\n\tMargaret's true feelings come out in a very emotional moment.  She feels that her nurses have never offered her any semblance of friendship, and for that she has become resentful.  Her speech takes the nurses offguard, they always assumed that Margaret was the villain, but perhaps relationships are a two-way street? \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter, still having reservations about the 'quarantine' of Margaret's quarters, confronts Radar and the doctors on the condition of the quarantined soldier.  When he discovers that the soldier has left the camp, he brings it to the attention of Margaret, asking if she wants to press charges.  Does Margaret press charges?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tOf course not!  Margaret now feels that she has lifted a burden off her chest by revealing herself to the nurses, and now decides to make a conciliatory gesture of friendship to show them that what she said was genuine.  This episode really exhibits the growth of Margaret as a character, in my opinion.  Thank you for having a go at this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff (if you haven't already!) \n"}]}
