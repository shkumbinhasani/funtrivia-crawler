{"id": "197654", "name": "Citizen Kane (Part 2) Quiz | Citizen Kane . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Citizen Kane"], "questions": [{"text": "As this quiz opens we find newsman Jerry Thompson reading through the section of Walter Parks Thatcher's diary that deals with Charles Foster Kane.  The scene then shifts to snowy Colorado.  Young Charles plays in the snow while Thatcher discusses arrangements with the boy's parents about placing the child under the custody of a firm called Thatcher and Company.  Actress Agnes Moorehead plays the stern and single-minded mother of Charlie Kane in this, her feature film debut.  Moorehead is perhaps best known for her regular role in which television sitcom?", "correct": "Bewitched", "options": ["Gilligan's Island", "The Facts of Life", "Growing Pains"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBewitched.\n\n\tAgnes Moorehead was featured in dozens of Hollywood films, but she is probably most recognized as Endora, mother of Samantha in the popular 60s television sitcom 'Bewitched'.  \r In 'Citizen Kane', Moorehead portrays the seemingly cool-hearted Mary Kane, a woman who has become incredibly wealthy through her ownership of a Colorado gold mine.  Later in this early scene it is revealed that Mary's intentions are to separate young Charles from his father, who has been abusing the young lad. \n"}, {"text": "Following the separation of Charles from his parents, the viewer is presented with an interesting and significant snippet of Charles receiving a Christmas gift from Mr. Thatcher.  The gift is a sled.  What is the name of this sled?", "correct": "The Crusader", "options": ["The Viking", "The Red Knight", "The Warrior"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Crusader.\n\n\tRosebud is the name of Charles' sled in Colorado.  The fact that he is presented with a new and improved (?) sled, and not his beloved Rosebud, hints at the separation anxiety the young boy is feeling.  As 'Rosebud' is Charles Foster Kane's last word, the viewer is led to believe that the sled, an inanimate object, is the poor chap's best wordly friend. \n"}, {"text": "In a great leap, we leave Kane's childhood behind and arrive at his 25th birthday.  At this stage, the young man is about to come into his inheritance.  Thatcher informs Kane of the list of holdings he is to receive, but Charles is only interested in a single item...a certain New York newspaper.  What is the name of this newspaper?", "correct": "The Inquirer", "options": ["The Herald", "The Daily Sun", "The Post Dispatch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Inquirer.\n\n\tThatcher's letter informs Kane of the great responsibility he will now have in directing his family's holdings.  Kane has apparently become rather rebellious though, and he rejects the appeals of his former guardian.  He is interested in running the New York Inquirer, however, and informs an obviously annoyed Thatcher, stating in his letter, 'I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.' \n"}, {"text": "Now a newspaper publisher, Charles Foster Kane proceeds to employ the techniques described at the time (late 19th, early 20th centuries) as 'yellow journalism'.  Which of these is not a target of Kane's newspaper stories?", "correct": "Meat packers", "options": ["Slum landlords", "Traction Trust", "Copper 'robbers'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeat packers.\n\n\tCharles Kane's interests at this point in his young life apparently reside in protecting the 'common man'.  Kane is even willing to attack the very companies with which he holds substantial amounts of stock.\r When Thatcher questions Kane about his reporting techniques, the latter responds, 'I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher, I just try everything I can think of.' \n"}, {"text": "Also implied in the first scene at which we see Kane running his newspaper is that he is drumming up American interest in a war against which of these countries?", "correct": "Spain", "options": ["Russia", "France", "Mexico"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpain.\n\n\tAlong with the headlines describing 'copper robbers' and 'slum landlords' Thatcher reads one that boldly states 'Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast'.  Much as it has been suggested that William Randolph Hearst spurred support for the U.S. war against Spain in the late 19th century, Kane does the same thing.  In fact, Kane uses a line borrowed from Hearst in response to his assistant Bernstein, who reads a letter from a reporter named Wheeler which states that 'There is no war in Cuba.' Kane responds, 'Dear Wheeler: you provide the prose poems. I'll provide the war.' \n"}, {"text": "During this scene in the newspaper publishing office the viewer is introduced to two key characters in the film.  The first is Bernstein, Kane's chief assistant.  What is Mr. Bernstein's given name?", "correct": "We are never told", "options": ["Gary", "Phil", "Buddy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe are never told.\n\n\tBernstein is always referred to as 'Mr. Bernstein' throughout the film...I'm not sure why.  He is portrayed by Everett Sloane, another member of Welles' Mercury Theater group.  Sloane went on to work with Welles' in several more films, including 'Journey into Fear', 'The Lady from Shanghai' and 'Prince of Foxes'. \n"}, {"text": "Another significant character introduced at this point is Kane's childhood friend Jedidiah Leland.  Leland is portrayed by Joseph Cotten, who would go on to star in a number of films with Welles.  Which of these was perhaps the most famous film, aside from 'Citizen Kane', in which the two were featured together?", "correct": "The Third Man", "options": ["The Man Who Knew Too Much", "The Robe", "Gilda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Third Man.\n\n\tIn 1949, Cotten and Welles were both featured in Carol Reed's classic film noir 'The Third Man', Cotten as Holly Martins and Welles as Harry Lime.  Another of Welles' Mercury players, Cotten also starred with the former in films like 'The Magnificent Ambersons' and 'Journey into Fear'.  \r Cotten once proudly boasted, 'Orson Welles lists 'Citizen Kane' as his best film, Alfred Hitchcock opts for 'Shadow of a Doubt' and Sir Carol Reed chose 'The Third Man' - and I'm in all of them.' \n"}, {"text": "This film provides a lot of great lines.  One of my favorite occurs when Charles Kane is depicted signing papers agreeing to relinquish control of his newspapers.  Sitting with Mr. Thatcher and Mr. Bernstein, Kane looks at the latter and comments, 'If I hadn't been _________, I might have been a really great man.'  What words complete the quote?", "correct": "very rich", "options": ["such an opportunist", "quite so foolish with money", "so hopelessly optimistic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nvery rich.\n\n\tSitting with Thatcher, Kane essentially admits his former youthful frivolity.  He suggests that Thatcher is a brilliant banker, and that he himself has 'gagged on the silver spoon' in his mouth.  \r In another interesting moment, Thatcher questions Kane on what he wishes he had become (aside from a 'great man'), and Kane responds, 'Everything you hate.' \n"}, {"text": "Frustrated by the lack of revelation in Thatcher's diary, the reporter Thompson next pursues Bernstein, Kane's former assistant.  Bernstein recollects, among other things, his first day on the newspaper job with Kane and Leland.  What position with the staff does Kane assign to his good friend Jedidiah?", "correct": "Dramatic Critic", "options": ["Editor-in-Chief", "Accountant", "Sports Reporter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDramatic Critic.\n\n\tLeland's job as dramatic critic will become significant later on when Kane is married to Susan Alexander, his 'diva' second wife.  Interestingly enough, Kane asks Leland at this point, 'I hope I haven't made a mistake, Jedidiah.  It is a dramatic critic, isn't it?' \n"}, {"text": "At this point, we also learn the name of the chief rival to Kane's new newspaper, the New York Chronicle.  The Chronicle is the top newspaper in New York, with a circulation of over 400,000.  An example of the type of news story the Chronicle covers is provided, involving a Mr. Silverstone in Brooklyn.  What type of story does Kane describe?", "correct": "Spousal murder", "options": ["UFO sighting", "Mob killing", "Kidnapping of a child"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpousal murder.\n\n\tCharlie Kane decides that if his Inquirer is to compete with the Chronicle, his paper will have to start reporting the same type of news stories as its competitor.  This is much to the annoyance of his editor-in-chief, Mr. Carter, who has apparently tried to maintain a scandal-free newspaper.  Carter is concerned with integrity, Kane's concern is reaching the maximum number of readers through his yellow journalist techniques.\r Please join me for the third quiz in this series as we continue to ponder the rise and decline of Charles Foster Kane.  Thank you for playing. \n"}]}
