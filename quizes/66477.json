Some twelve years later, he tells a teenage babysitter that it now stands for 'Terribly Sad,' adding, 'It used to be 'Terribly Sexy,' but it changed.' The babysitter disagrees with him, though... \n"}, {"text": "Despite Garp's eventual jokes about his name, Jenny Fields tells her parents exactly why she's chosen to name her baby T.S. Garp. What phrase, title, or name inspires her?", "correct": "Technical Sergeant", "options": ["T.S. Eliot", "Third Son", "Thoracic Surgery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTechnical Sergeant.\n\n\tJenny never learned the first name of Technical Sergeant Garp, the dying soldier who became, somewhat without his consent, the biological father of her son...so she did the best she could with the information she had. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the private school where Jenny takes a job as a nurse and raises Garp?", "correct": "Everett Steering Academy", "options": ["Dog's Head Academy", "Emmett Muirfield Academy", "Eastland Academy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEverett Steering Academy.\n\n\tMuirfield Academy was a rival school -- we saw the Steering wrestling team take them on early in the film. Dog's Head Harbor is the name of Jenny Fields' family manor. Eastland Academy was the school on TV's 'The Facts of Life.' =) \n"}, {"text": "Given his vocation, where would Garp's father traditionally have been seated in an aircraft?", "correct": "The tailgunner chair", "options": ["The pilot's seat", "None of these -- he was a mechanic, not a flyer", "The navigator's seat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe tailgunner chair.\n\n\tIt's stated several times that Technical Sergeant Garp was a tailgunner in World War II.

Garp novel or short story?", "correct": "'The World According To Garp'", "options": ["'Magic Gloves'", "'The Second Wind of the Cuckold'", "'Procrastination'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The World According To Garp'.\n\n\t'Magic Gloves' is the first short story we see Garp successfully complete, and 'Procrastination' is his first novel. We see a window display for his second novel, 'The Second Wind of the Cuckold,' in the scene where Garp first lays eyes on the young man who will soon become his wife's lover...and therefore make him a cuckold. Clever, hmm? \n"}, {"text": "As Garp and Helen are being shown the house they plan to buy, something rather distressing happens to the house.

Garp takes this as a good sign -- 'The odds of another plane hitting this house are astronomical!' -- and agrees right then and there to buy the house. \n"}, {"text": "Garp is livid that his mother's book outsells his by an outlandish margin, as he considers her to be an amateur writer at best. At one point, he hurls a magazine across the room upon learning that Jenny's book is so popular that it has been translated into a certain language. Which one?", "correct": "Apache", "options": ["Swahili", "Iraqi", "Tagalog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApache.\n\n\tGarp: 'Apache, Helen.

'Michael Milton.'\" \n"}, {"text": "Garp tells his wife that he feels he only has a limited number of 'natural talents.' Which of the following is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Writing", "options": ["Garp includes all of these in his list of 'natural talents'", "Wrestling", "Being a family man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWriting.\n\n\tGarp: 'I'm only a natural at two things: wrestling, and being a family man.' Garp seems, in fact, rather unlike many professional writers -- he got into the trade for somewhat dubious reasons (as opposed to feeling 'driven' to write), and was able to drop it completely at a relatively young age without missing it at all. Many writers would probably envy him for that. \n"}, {"text": "Garp's son Walt has a habit of mispronouncing words and phrases to such an amusing extent that the mistakes wind up as permanent additions to his family's private jargon. Which of the following 'Walt-isms' is NOT heard in the movie?", "correct": "'The home of the Dave' for 'The home of the brave' (the last words of the American national anthem)", "options": ["'Gradual school' for 'graduate school'", "'The Under Toad' for 'the undertow'", "'Roger and out' for 'Over and out'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The home of the Dave' for 'The home of the brave' (the last words of the American national anthem).\n\n\tAfter Garp warns Walt to be careful of the undertow while swimming in the ocean, he comes to believe that there is a monster called The Under Toad hiding beneath the waves. (This metaphor is actually used to great effect in the novel, but it only gets a passing reference in the film.) When Walt asks what this 'gradual school' is where his mother teaches, Garp explains with a smirk that it's 'where you gradually realize that you don't want to be in school anymore.' Helen later refers to Michael Milton as one of her 'gradual students' without even cracking a smile -- that's how deeply ingrained the 'Walt-ism' has become.The 'home of the Dave' mistake, I must admit, is not a Walt-ism at all, but a Frank-ism: that's how I used to sing the anthem when I was a child, for some reason, and no one could talk me out of it. =) \n"}, {"text": "A semi-successful alternative rock band took its name from someone or something featured in this movie. What is this band called?", "correct": "The Ellen James Society", "options": ["Roberta Muldoon", "Sexual Suspect", "Black Snow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ellen James Society.\n\n\t'Sexual Suspect' is the name of Jenny Fields' best-selling book; 'Black Snow' is the name of a short story Michael Milton has written for Helen's class; and Roberta Muldoon is John Lithgow's character's name. The Ellen James Society, in the movie, is an ultra-radical feminist coalition who have taken the name of a woman who, as a child, was raped and mutilated. What that says about the Atlanta-based early-nineties band is for you to decide. Their albums include 'Reluctantly We' and 'The Survivors Parade.' \n"}, {"text": "Which of Garp and Helen's children does not survive the movie?", "correct": "Walt", "options": ["Duncan", "Jenny", "John"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalt.\n\n\tWalt is killed in the car accident in the Garps' driveway, the poor little bugger. Duncan survives, but loses an eye. Jenny, their third child, isn't conceived until well after the car accident, and she is still alive and well at film's end. John is not the name of any of the Garp children, but rather Garp and Jenny's publisher. \n"}, {"text": "Quite a few people are seriously injured (and worse) in the car accident that takes place in the Garps' driveway. Which of the following descriptions is NOT accurate?", "correct": "Garp is temporarily paralyzed from the waist down.", "options": ["Helen's lover loses an appendage.", "Helen suffers a severe case of whiplash.", "One of the children loses an eye."], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarp is temporarily paralyzed from the waist down.\n\n\tThe precise details of the accident are both lengthy and not entirely appropriate for a family site, so we won't go into them here. Garp suffers no paralysis as a result of the accident, but since his tongue has been seriously damaged, and his jaw has been wired shut, he is unable to speak for what is presumably a period of many weeks.Being reduced to scribbling out his thoughts on a small notepad is obviously reminiscent of the Ellen James Society, an irony that is not lost on Roberta the first time she witnesses her friend trying to communicate in this manner. Duncan, the surviving son, loses an eye.And as for the exact appendage that Michael Milton loses...well, let's just say that he's going to miss it. A lot. \n"}, {"text": "The last time that Garp sees his mother alive, she is boarding a helicopter some twenty yards away. He shouts something to her that she is unable to hear. What is it?", "correct": "'I never needed a father!'", "options": ["'I love you!'", "'Thanks for everything!'", "'You *are* a good writer!'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'I never needed a father!'.\n\n\tGiven that Jenny dies in the very next scene, it's especially sad that she missed the chance to hear her son express this sentiment. \n"}, {"text": "Garp rather unexpectedly meets up with the elusive Ellen James late in the film. She's played by an actress who, years later, would play a much larger role in another film with Robin Williams. Who is this actress?", "correct": "Amanda Plummer", "options": ["Jenny Wright", "Diane Lane", "Nastassia Kinski"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmanda Plummer.\n\n\tPlummer would go on to play Lydia Sinclair, the true love of Williams' Henry \"Parry\" Sagan, in 1991's 'The Fisher King'...but hey, you already know this, since you've taken my quiz on that movie.  =)  Jenny Wright played the adult Cushie Percy, Garp's nubile next-door neighbor. Kinski and Lane have both acted with Williams (in 'Father's Day' (1997) and 'Jack' (1996), respectively), but neither of them are in 'The World According To Garp.' \n"}, {"text": "What is the last complete sentence that Garp speaks to Helen at the end of the film?", "correct": "'I'm flying.'", "options": ["'I'm trying.'", "'I'm dying.'", "'I'm lying.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'I'm flying.'\n\n\tAs a boy, Garp was obsessed with flying, mostly because his father was 'a flyer.' After having been shot multiple times at close range by an enraged 'Ellen Jamesian' (his former neighbor Pooh Percy, in fact), he is loaded onto an EMT helicopter to get him to a hospital as quickly as possible. He looks out the window and says to Helen, 'I'm flying.' He's still alive and smiling as the camera pulls away, but since he dies in the novel, I'd say his chances of survival are pretty slim. \n"}, {"text": "The director of 'The World According To Garp' has spearheaded a rather eclectic collection of films. Which of the following films did he NOT direct?", "correct": "'Rhinestone'", "options": ["'The Sting'", "'Slap Shot'", "'Funny Farm'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Rhinestone'.\n\n\tGeorge Roy Hill directed all of the above except for 'Rhinestone,' which was directed by Sydney Pollack. \n"}]}
