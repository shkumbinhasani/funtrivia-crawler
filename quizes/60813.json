{"id": "60813", "name": "Movies That Exist Only In Movies! Trivia Game | Movies | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Only in the Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "In 1997's 'Boogie Nights,' Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) comes up with the idea for a series of movies featuring a James Bond-like character named Brock Landers. What's the subtitle of the first 'Brock Landers' movie that we see?", "correct": "'Angels Live In My Town'", "options": ["'A Man of Lust'", "'Dr. Yes'", "'Oral Majesty'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Angels Live In My Town'.\n\n\tThe credits sequence for 'Brock Landers: Angels Live In My Town' is probably the funniest part of 'Boogie Nights.' In 'Dirk Diggler: A Man of Lust,' the documentary directed by Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), we learn that the seventh 'Brock Landers' film is subtitled 'Oral Majesty.' \n"}, {"text": "In the 'magical' world of 1993's 'Last Action Hero,' there is no actor named Arnold Schwarzenegger. Who, then, played the lead in that world's version of 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'?", "correct": "Sylvester Stallone", "options": ["Lou Ferrigno", "Jean-Claude Van Damme", "Dolph Lundgren"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSylvester Stallone.\n\n\tWe see a huge cardboard display for 'T2' which looks exactly like the real one...but it's Stallone in the leathers and sunglasses. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of 1985's 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,' we see that a movie has been made about Pee-Wee Herman. Who plays Pee-Wee in this movie within the movie?", "correct": "James Brolin & Brolin & Jim Brolin", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Brolin & Brolin & Jim Brolin.\n\n\tBrolin, of course, plays 'P.W. Herman' as a suave, debonair leading man. Brolin's real-life wife is Barbra Streisand. \n"}, {"text": "In 1991's 'The Rocketeer,' test pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) is surprised to learn from his girlfriend that erudite, romantic leading man Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) has made a war movie, in which he plays a fighter pilot. What's this movie called?", "correct": "'Wings of Honor'", "options": ["'Three If By Air'", "'The Unforgiving Sky'", "'Flight of Fancy'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Wings of Honor'.\n\n\tCliff would rather see a James Cagney movie -- but hey, what Jenny (Jennifer Connelly) wants, Jenny gets. Hell, I'd sit through a Pauly Shore retrospective if it meant a date with Jennifer Connelly. =) \n"}, {"text": "In 1981's 'The Cannonball Run,' Roger Moore plays himself, more or less. When referencing the 'James Bond' films, though, he was apparently forced by Cubby Broccoli and company to fudge the titles a bit, so as not to be technically poking fun at the 007 franchise. Which 'fractured' 007 film does he discuss with one of the beautiful women he picks up in his car during the cross-country race?", "correct": "'The Fly Who Bugged Me'", "options": ["'For Only Your Eyes'", "'Give and Let Lie'", "'The Man With the Platinum Gun'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Fly Who Bugged Me'.\n\n\tA 'rhyming' version, of course, of 1977's 'The Spy Who Loved Me.' \n"}, {"text": "In 1980's 'Hero At Large,' struggling actor Steve Nichols (John Ritter) becomes, almost accidentally, a real-life version of the superhero he portrays at local premieres of a major motion picture. Complete the name of this superhero: Captain _________.", "correct": "Avenger", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvenger.\n\n\tCaptain Avenger had all kinds of superhuman powers in the movie-within-the-movie, but plain old Steve Nichols has a much harder time playing hero. \n"}, {"text": "What's the name of the movie that Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant) pitches to studio executive Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) in 1992's 'The Player'?", "correct": "'Habeas Corpus'", "options": ["'Pro Bono'", "'Ipso Facto'", "'Non Compos Mentis'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Habeas Corpus'.\n\n\t'Habeas Corpus' -- named for a legal term meaning 'bring me the body' in Latin -- is in fact produced by film's end, albeit in a very different form than the one originally pitched by Oakley. The 'no {stars;} all unknowns' idea has been pretty much thrown out the window, since we see Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, Susan Sarandon, and Peter Falk among the cast. \n"}, {"text": "In 1982's 'My Favorite Year,' young Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker) is thrilled when his idol, movie star Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole), is set to be a guest star on the TV variety show he works for...but Swann turns out to be an irresponsible, uncontrollable alcoholic. During one scene where Benjy is trying to sober up the star, Swann drunkenly lapses into a swatch of dialogue from one of Benjy's favorite Alan Swann movies. What is it called?", "correct": "'Captain From Tortuga'", "options": ["'Let Fly the Jolly Roger'", "'Treachery At Sea'", "'The Carver Mutiny'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Captain From Tortuga'.\n\n\tSwann has made a number of 'swashbuckling' movies, a la Errol Flynn. \n"}, {"text": "The cast and crew of 2000's 'State and Main' wreak minor havok on a small town during the filming of a major motion picture. What is it (originally) called?", "correct": "'The Old Mill'", "options": ["'The Old Town'", "'The Old Barn'", "'The Old Farm'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Old Mill'.\n\n\tThe director is distressed to learn that there is no mill in town -- despite the tourism literature, the old mill burned to the ground decades earlier. The movie is eventually renamed 'The Fires of Home.' \n"}, {"text": "In 1993's 'True Romance,' Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is thrilled to meet Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek), a Hollywood producer responsible for one of Clarence's all-time favorite movies. Finish its title: 'Coming Home In a ______________.'", "correct": "Body Bag & Bodybag & Body-bag", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBody Bag & Bodybag & Body-bag.\n\n\t'Coming Home In a Body Bag' is, according to Clarence, the only film about Viet Nam besides 'Apocalypse Now' that's worth watching. Lee Donowitz seems to me to have been based in part on Joel Silver, but since Lee deals drugs as well as makes movies, I'm sure director Tony Scott would never own up to that comparison for legal reasons. \n"}, {"text": "We learn in 1994's 'Major League II' that Cleveland Indian Willie Mays Hayes (Omar Epps) has starred in an action film, 'Black Hammer, White Lightning,' in the off-season. What real-life athlete-turned-actor was Willie's co-star?", "correct": "Jesse Ventura", "options": ["Hulk Hogan", "Brian Bosworth", "Roddy Piper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJesse Ventura.\n\n\tThe trailer for 'Black Hammer, White Lightning' is hysterically bad. Are we *sure* Minnesota knows what it's doing...? \n"}, {"text": "Most of the plot of 2001's 'America's Sweethearts' centers around a press junket being held for the most recent film starring Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John Cusack). What is this science fiction thriller called?", "correct": "'Time Over Time'", "options": ["'Time and Time Again'", "'Time After Time'", "'Time Squared'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Time Over Time'.\n\n\tPretty dumb title, if you ask me...but I suspect that was the point. \n"}, {"text": "This one's a little tricky, but it technically fits the parameters of this quiz, since it's a movie that only 'exists' in the confines of another movie. In 1991's 'The Doors,' Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) explains to several of his bar buddies that he'd really like to direct an edgy, black-and-white film, with them as the stars. What would the name of this movie have been?", "correct": "'Zero'", "options": ["'One'", "'Four'", "'Twelve'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Zero'.\n\n\tSince the real-life Morrison never got the chance to make this film before his death, 'Zero' does fall within the purview of 'Movies That Exist (or have been mentioned, in this case) Only In Movies,' I'd say. \n"}, {"text": "In 1997's 'In and Out,' Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) receives a Best Actor Award at the Oscars. Among his competitors for that award was Steven Seagal. For what fictional film was Seagal nominated?", "correct": "'Snowball In Hell'", "options": ["'Yeah, Right'", "'Hell Freezes Over'", "'The End Is Nigh'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Snowball In Hell'.\n\n\tGlenn Close, playing herself, reads off the nominations and presents Cameron with his Oscar. I hope Seagal's a good sport. \n"}, {"text": "In 1993's criminally underrated '...And God Spoke (The Making of),' two dimwitted filmmakers endeavor to make a biblical epic. Which of the following actors or actresses does NOT appear as him- or herself in this 'mockumentary' detailing the making of '...And God Spoke'?", "correct": "Andy Dick", "options": ["Eve Plumb", "Lou Ferrigno", "Soupy Sales"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndy Dick.\n\n\tBit of a trick question, there: Andy Dick does appear in the movie, but he's playing a fictional actor named Dick Andrews (get it?), while the other three are playing themselves. Dick Andrews plays Abel to Lou Ferrigno's {Cain;} Eve Plumb plays Noah's {wife;} and Soupy Sales plays Moses. If you've never seen this film (or, if more likely, you've never even heard of it), go out and find it. It's 'This Is Spinal Tap' for filmmakers, and it's wet-yourself funny, I promise. \n"}]}
