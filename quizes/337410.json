This nickname is usually used to describe a native of the City of Plymouth in Devon, and in particular the name was given to someone from the Devonport area of that city. \n"}, {"text": "Issued within British Infantry Regiments down to Section level, the 'JIMPY' provides the bulk of a unit's small arms firepower.  What is a 'JIMPY'?", "correct": "The General Purpose Machine Gun", "options": ["The Light Support Weapon", "A Shoulder Mounted Rocket Launcher", "The Sterling Sub-Machine Gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe General Purpose Machine Gun.\n\n\tThe 'JIMPY' or GPMG is the British version of the FM MAG machine gun, a weapon that can be found in use all over the world.  In the light role at Section and Platoon level, it is supported in use by a bipod mounted near the end of the barrel and can be fed using a loose belt or, more unusually, by a small detachable box magazine. At Company and Battalion level and in prepared positions the GPMG is used in a sustained fire (SF) role where it will be found mounted on a tripod and, in conjunction with other items, can be used to record targets during daylight that can then be effectively engaged in darkness. In recent years some Infantry Battalions have reformed a Battalion Machine Gun Platoon, a formation which was in its heyday during the two World Wars. \n"}, {"text": "Most soldiers hated wearing them, especially in hot weather conditions, but on a modern battlefield this item is an absolute necessity.  Known as 'Noddy Suits', under what battlefield scenario would these items be worn?", "correct": "NBC (Nuclear, Chemical and Biological) Warfare", "options": ["Specifically during river crossings", "Whilst recovering battlefield casualties", "Whilst refuelling and re-arming armoured vehicles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNBC (Nuclear, Chemical and Biological) Warfare.\n\n\t'Noddy Suits', as they are affectionately known by the British soldier, provide some level of protection for the individual on the nuclear, chemical and biological battlefield.  Made from a thick paper-like material and with a charcoal lining, they can only be used for around 24 hours in a heavily contaminated environment before they must be replaced. The name comes from the fact that, once completely outfitted, the rough, tough soldier looks like a well loved children's story character.  Personally, I always thought that with our hoods up, we looked more like Noddy's best friend, Big Ears!  How we were expected to be taken seriously by the invading Russian hordes, god only knows! \n"}, {"text": "If, during basic training, someone referred to you specifically as a 'craphat', what item of issued head dress would you be wearing?", "correct": "A camouflage pattern combat cap", "options": ["An Airborne Forces beret", "A peaked dress uniform cap", "A Scottish Regiment Tam O'Shanter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA camouflage pattern combat cap.\n\n\tIn many basic training units, before you have completed at least a small amount of the training cycle, recruits are not permitted to wear the head dress of their unit.  This re-inforces the idea that membership of a unit must be earned and it also fosters a sense of esprit-de-corps that strengthens the Regiment/Unit and continues forever.You only need to attend a Remembrance Day Parade in the UK to see large numbers of veterans proudly wearing their regimental head dress and items of uniform.  Members of the British Airborne Forces have often referred to members of other Infantry Regiments as 'craphats' as they consider that the winning of their right to wear the red beret has been gained through tougher training. \n"}, {"text": "During Company Muster Parade at 08.00hrs, the Company Sergeant Major informs you all that immediately after NAAFI break, the Company is taking an important annual test.  What test are you most likely to be participating in?", "correct": "ICFT (Infantry Combat Fitness Test)", "options": ["PULHHEEMS Test", "BFT (Basic Fitness Test)", "AST (Army Swimming Test)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nICFT (Infantry Combat Fitness Test).\n\n\tThe ICFT (Infantry Combat Fitness Test) consists of an 8 mile forced march that had to be completed in under two hours, as a team or unit, usually platoon strength.  Each soldier was expected to complete the test carrying full webbing equipment weighing in at around 35lbs (simulating the carrying of ammunition and other items), with his personal weapon, wearing issued boots and his steel or composite helmet.  The test was considerably harder if you were the soldier responsible for carrying the 'Charlie G' or the 'JIMPY' as both of these weighed considerably more than a rifle!\rThe BFT (Basic Fitness Test) took place every 6 months.  Each soldier had to march one and a half miles in under 15 minutes and then return over the same route in under 11 and a half minutes.  This test was done in boots and lightweights with no equipment, however, failure to complete in the allowed time meant that you would be placed on extra physical training until the test was passed!\rThe Army Swimming Test was the most enjoyable test of them all (and possibly the easiest) as it always meant an afternoon at the Garrison Pool!\rThe PULHHEEMS Test was a medical examination that all new recruits had to undergo to confirm that you were in suitable physical condition to serve in the Armed Forces. \n"}, {"text": "During your All Arms Drill Course, you hear members of certain units being described as 'Tick-Tocks'.  From which units would these soldiers come from?", "correct": "The Guards Regiments of The Household Division", "options": ["The Infantry Regiments of the Scottish Division", "The Royal Engineers", "The Cavalry Regiments of The Household Division"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Guards Regiments of The Household Division.\n\n\tMembers of the Guards Regiments of The Household Division are renowned for their discipline and presence on parade.  These Regiments - The Grenadiers, The Coldstream, The Scots, The Welsh and The Irish Guards, provide the personal bodyguard for the reigning monarch and are representative of everything that is great about Great Britain.Ever present at State Occasions they are distinguished by the use of their red tunics and bearskin head dress.  Because of their precise, mechanical foot and arms drill, and because of their uniform's similarity to the small, clockwork figures on old clocks, the Guards have been referred to as 'Tick-Tocks' for many years. \n"}, {"text": "It is very important that soldiers 'do their dhobi' on a regular basis.  What tedious chore does this term apply to?", "correct": "Washing their Laundry", "options": ["Polishing their boots", "Performing a Guard Duty", "Cleaning their personal weapons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWashing their Laundry.\n\n\tThe word 'Dhobi' dates from the days of the British Raj.  It is a Hindi word that translated means 'laundry' or 'washing'. One of the more tedious personal administration tasks that needs to be carried out, but important nevertheless. 'Dhobi Dust' is the slang name given to washing powder. \n"}, {"text": "As you stand there, a lonely figure, you enviously watch your comrades approach you smartly dressed, ready for a night out of barracks.  As they get closer one of them shouts \"Hey Stevie boy, Stag On mucker!\"  You mumble one or two obscenities under your breath as they jump into their taxi and speed away... What on earth are you doing?", "correct": "You have pulled a Regimental Guard Duty", "options": ["You are a prisoner in the Guard Room", "You are on Show Parade", "You are waiting to attend a Mess Ball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou have pulled a Regimental Guard Duty.\n\n\tRegimental Guard Duty.... How wonderful, especially at the weekends!  In the old days it was possible to come to an 'arrangement' with your mates and pay one of them to do your Guard Duty.  It could get very, very costly around the important holidays like Christmas and Easter.  Each Rifle Company would take it in turn to provide the soldiers for Regimental Guard Duty for a period of a week, so it was imperative that you stayed out of trouble and kept a low profile in the weeks leading up to your Company's turn on the rota... Otherwise the Company Sergeant Major's job detailing soldiers for this task became much easier! Why give him the satisfaction and make HIS job any easier?! \n"}, {"text": "An important item of safety equipment, especially whilst on training exercises is the 'BFA'. What exactly is a 'BFA'?", "correct": "Blank Firing Attachment", "options": ["Basic Firing Accessory", "Blowback Fixing Accessory", "Boosted Firing Adaptor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlank Firing Attachment.\n\n\tThe blank firing attachment is a detachable device mounted at the end of a rifle or machine gun barrel which enables a semi or fully automatic weapon to operate whilst using blank ammunition.  Because there is no bullet travelling inside the barrel when a blank round is fired, the gases that are used to operate the reloading mechanism dissipate very quickly from the muzzle, the gas pressure drops leaving insufficient gas to return the bolt and reload the next round ready for firing. The removable BFA partially blocks the muzzle and restricts the loss of gas thus enabling the weapon to work correctly. BFA's are always painted bright yellow for safety purposes.  It is very important that a weapon is never pointed and operated toward another person when using a BFA as the gas that does escape still has enough force to do harm. \n"}, {"text": "What term, often of a mildly derogatory nature, is commonly used to address a very young and inexperienced soldier?", "correct": "A Sprog", "options": ["A Monkey", "A Newbie", "A Tyro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Sprog.\n\n\tAs most of you with children will know, the name 'Sprog' is often used to describe a young baby or child and is used affectionately.  Unfortunately, the term is used as an insult within the British Army and, dependent on whether you are a new recruit or an experienced soldier, this insult goes up in scale from a very mild joke to resulting in fisticuffs! \n"}]}
