{"id": "347308", "name": "Nice Video, Shame About the Song Quiz | Music | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", " Music Mixture", "Name the Artist"], "questions": [{"text": "It might be their best known song on their album \"Travelling Without Moving\", but \"Virtual Insanity\" did not perform too great on US charts.  It only topped at position 37 on the US Billboard Top 40.  The music video, however, was quite entertaining.  Who sang \"Virtual Insanity\"?", "correct": "Jamiroquai", "options": ["Il Divo", "Shakira", "Bananarama"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJamiroquai.\n\n\tIn 1996, \"Virtual Insanity\" was released, from Jamiroquai's album \"Travelling Without Moving\".  It might have been their most well-known song from the album, but it still did not perform well on US charts (though it reached number one in Italy).\r The music video, however, was impressive.  It featured the singer in a room; and everything in it, including the singer, slid across the room.  It seemed like it was a giant conveyer belt, but it moved in all directions; not just one way. \n"}, {"text": "\"Massive Attack\" was released as the debut single from the album \"Pink Friday\". The video was a huge success. However, the song tanked. In fact, it was removed from \"Pink Friday\" because of its poor performance. Who sang \"Massive Attack\"?", "correct": "Nicki Minaj", "options": ["Rihanna", "Ke$ha", "Jessie J"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNicki Minaj.\n\n\tNicki Minaj released \"Massive Attack\" as a digital download in 2010. The song featured Sean Garrett. Her sexy video was a huge success; money, militaristic jungle scenes, and a helicopter chase. The video could have been an entire film. It was too bad about the song, though. It only reached a peak position of 122 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was dropped from her debut 2010 album \"Pink Friday\". \n"}, {"text": "\"Once in a Lifetime\" did not perform well on the US charts, but the video did much better. Though it was a bit odd with the guy dancing like a marionette, but it was strangely addicting. I couldn't stop watching it. What odd New Wave band sang \"Once in a Lifetime\"?", "correct": "Talking Heads", "options": ["Good Charlotte", "Smashing Pumpkins", "A-Ha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTalking Heads.\n\n\tTalking Heads released \"Once in a Lifetime\" in 1981. The video was quite bizarre; David Byrne danced around like a demonized puppet. However, it was better than the song, which only made it to 103 on the Billboard Hot 100. \n"}, {"text": "The video was a hilarious parody of many cop shows, including \"Starsky and Hutch\". The song, however, only reached 115 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song still managed to make its way onto a \"Guitar Hero\", though. Who sang \"Sabotage\"?", "correct": "Beastie Boys", "options": ["Backstreet Boys", "Boyz II Men", "Beach Boys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeastie Boys.\n\n\tThe Beastie Boys released \"Sabotage\" in 1994. It was found on the album \"Ill Communication\".  Though the video was great, the song did not do well. The great guitar sounds in the song, however, were enough to land the song in a \"Guitar Hero\" video game. \n"}, {"text": "The Nine Inch Nails song \"Hurt\" did not perform too well on charts. However, when the man in black covered the song, it was beautiful, and the music video was inspirational. Even though the song was great, it only reached 33 on Billboard US charts. Who covered the song, making it even more memorable?", "correct": "Johnny Cash", "options": ["Hank Williams III", "Clint Black", "Keith Urban"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Cash.\n\n\tWhen Nine Inch Nails sang \"Hurt\", it only reached 54 on US charts. 9 years later, in 2003, Johnny Cash covered the song on his album \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\".  The song was an inspiration when Cash sang it, and the video was priceless. No words can describe it; one must simply watch it. Cash died only nine months after the song was released. \n"}, {"text": "\"Islands\" was not the best song Europe has ever seen. But the music video was fantastic. It first seemed like a glitch; the dancers danced the same thing over and over. But, after a while, subtle changes affected the entire outcome. Who sang the song?", "correct": "The xx", "options": ["The aa", "The bb", "The rr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe xx.\n\n\tThe xx released \"Islands\" in 2009 on their album \"xx\".  It did not perform well... Though it was third on the UK Indie charts, it only placed 34 on the UK Top 40, and 89 on European Hot 100 Singles. The music video, of course, was beautifully constructed. \n"}, {"text": "The song was a hit in the UK, but only reached 36 on the US Billboard Hot 100.  The video was quite a success, though, which was interesting since the video only cost around $800 to produce.  It was a bizarre (but strangely entertaining) dance video, shot live outside a California movie theater.\n\nWho sang \"Praise You\", the song in question?", "correct": "Fatboy Slim", "options": ["John Mayer", "Eminem", "Babyface"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFatboy Slim.\n\n\tFatboy Slim released \"Praise You\" in 1999.  It was found on the album \"You've Come a Long Way, Baby\".  The music video was a huge success, even though it was shot like a home video.  Bystanders watched as a guy danced around wildly, and some joined in.  The video became such a success that it won several MTV awards, and was nominated for \"Best Dance Video\" (it lost to \"Livin' La Vida Loca\"). \n"}, {"text": "Many remember the viral video of four guys dancing on eight treadmills in 2006.  It was the music video for \"Here It Goes Again\".  People responded well to the video, but, unfortunately, the video was so cool the song was overshadowed, and many didn't even know what song was playing; or the band who was dancing.  Most simply referred to it as the \"treadmill video\".  The song reached only 38 on the Billboard Hot 100, mostly due to the music video, and not so much the song.  Who sang it?", "correct": "OK Go", "options": ["The Ready Set", "Train", "Owl City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOK Go.\n\n\tOK Go released \"Here It Goes Again\" in 2006, and it became their first (and for several years after, their only) single to make it onto the Billboard US charts.  It can be found on their album \"Oh No\".  The song was not extremely popular; but popular enough to find its way onto \"Now That's What I Call Music! 23\" (US series), and also appeared on \"Rock Band\".\r Of course, the song paled in comparison to the music video, which reached over 52,000,000 views in the short time before it was removed, and became one of the first \"viral\" videos. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Hardest Button to Button\" did not perform as well as it could have on the US charts, but the video was pretty neat.  With 32 identical drum sets, 32 amplifiers, and 16 mic stands, the director did a great job with the video.\n\nWho sang \"The Hardest Button to Button\"?", "correct": "White Stripes", "options": ["Plain White Ts", "Black Sabbath", "Blackhearts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite Stripes.\n\n\tThe White Stripes released \"The Hardest Button to Button\" in 2003, and it can be found on their album \"Elephant\".  The song did not perform too badly on the charts; it peaked at 23 in the US.  However, the video was much better.  It took advantage of stop-motion animation, and to great affect.  The video had the band traveling through the subways of New York City with their instruments. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Scientist\" performed fairly well on the US charts, reaching 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 Modern Rock Tracks list.  However, the video was so much better.  It took advantage of \"reverse narrative\".  The singer walked in reverse until the video revealed what he had walked away from, which was chilling.  Who sang \"The Scientist\"?", "correct": "Coldplay", "options": ["Linkin Park", "Goo Goo Dolls", "Good Charlotte"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColdplay.\n\n\t\"The Scientist\" was released in 2002 in the UK and in 2003 in the US, and can be found on Coldplay's album \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\".  The song performed decently, peaking at position 18 on US charts (it reached the top 10 in the UK), but the video outshined the song greatly.  The video followed the lead singer of Coldplay, Chris Martin, backwards.  He was on a mattress to start, which was revealed to be outside.  Following him backwards, a first-time viewer wonders where he had come from.  The video followed him until, near the very end, it was discovered that he had just walked away from...\r But why spoil a good ending? \n"}]}
