{"id": "160350", "name": "'Monty Python's Flying Circus' - Episode 1 Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "Monty Python"], "questions": [{"text": "The Monty Python fellows apparently loved motifs, and played with them throughout the series.  In the first episode, one motif revolved around characters sitting on which of these defenseless, yet delicious, animals?", "correct": "Pigs", "options": ["Hedgehogs", "Iguanas", "Lemurs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPigs.\n\n\tIn several scenes characters unwittingly sit on pigs that suddenly appear on their chairs.  The Pythons loved to include various flora and fauna in their sketches for no apparent reason, with the creatures often being treated rather cruelly.  However, in retrospect they have assured the public that no creatures (other than themselves) were ever hurt in the filming of this series. \n"}, {"text": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart introduces the first sketch of the episode, 'Famous Deaths'.  Whose death are we not privileged to witness during this scene?", "correct": "St. Stephen", "options": ["Genghis Khan", "Admiral Nelson", "Mr. Bruce Foster of Guilford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Stephen\n\n\tGenghis Khan is the first death depicted.  His death receives a total of 28.1 points from the judges, sadly placing him in 6th place behind: St. Stephen (whose death is not shown) - 29.9, Richard III - 29.3, Jean d'ARC - 29.1, Marat - 29.0 and A. Lincoln (U.S. of A) - 28.2.  In last place is King Edward VII with only 3.1 points.  Mr. Bruce Foster's death, an apparent heart attack, is especially requested by Mr and Mrs Violet Steppings at 23 Wolverston Road, Hull.  The 'wonderful death' of the famous English Admiral Nelson is the last shown; he is tossed from the window of a tall building. \n"}, {"text": "The second scene of the first episode is the excellent Italian language class sketch, featuring the barely literate (in Italian) Terry Jones as the instructor of a group of fluent Italian pupils.  The instructor reviews last week's course, in which the Italian word for which of these was central?", "correct": "Spoon", "options": ["Blender", "Pitchfork", "Caboose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpoon.\n\n\tNaturally, the fluent Italian students all remember the word for spoon in Italian, 'il cucchiaio'.  The instructor goes on to teach the students how to identify who they are and where they come from.  Unfortunately, he cannot understand their responses and questions, and hence requires translation from one of the more proficient English-speakers in his class.  My goodness, those Pythons are proficient in the European languages! \n"}, {"text": "A short set of Terry Gilliam's animations follows the Italian class sketch.  The animated sequence turns out to be an advertisement for which brand of butter?", "correct": "Whizzo", "options": ["Smear-o-rama", "Sloppa", "Preppy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhizzo.\n\n\t'Yes mothers, new improved Whizzo Butter containing 10% more less (huh?) is absolutely indistinguishable from a dead crab.  Remember, buy Whizzo Butter and go to heaven!'  Indeed, nine out of ten housewives can't tell the difference between Whizzo Butter and a dead crab, according to the television announcer (played by the slick Michael Palin).  Everything goes fine in this scene until the housewives threaten the poor announcer with a razor to his face. \n"}, {"text": "Following the Gilliam animations we have an episode of 'It's the Arts'.  First up is an interview of a world-renowned film director, Sir Edward Ross.  The interviewer (played by John Cleese) attempts to address the distinguished director with all but which of the following?", "correct": "Mr. Ross", "options": ["Little Frannie", "Eddie-baby", "Angel Drawers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Ross\n\n\tSir Edward Ross is called all of the following: Ted, Eddie-baby, Sweetie, Sugar Plum, Pussycat, Angel Drawers, Frank, Frannie, Little Frannie and Frannie Knickers.  When he is finally allowed to begin discussing his latest film, the interviewer interrupts him with an 'Oh, shut up!' \n"}, {"text": "Following the Ross interview, we are treated to another interview, conducted by Eric Idle, of the composer Arthur Jackson.  What is Mr. Jackson's rather unfortunate nickname?", "correct": "Two sheds", "options": ["Long lobes", "Elephant foot", "French toast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo sheds.\n\n\tMore interesting than Arthur Jackson's music is the fact that he has one shed in his backyard, and at one time wished to possibly add a second shed.  The interviewer continues to badger old 'two sheds' about his shed obsession, and when Jackson finally stands up for himself, he's thrown offstage.  You don't cross interviewers on 'Monty Python's Flying Circus', it can prove violent! \n"}, {"text": "The final segment of 'It's the Arts' is a bicycle race, this one involving artists who paint while riding.  Which artist is especially covered during the race?", "correct": "Picasso", "options": ["Leonardo", "Monet", "Rembrandt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPicasso.\n\n\tPicasso is the focus of the attention during the race, but other artists mentioned include: Kandinsky, Braque, Mondrian, Chagall, Ernst, Miro, Dufy, Nicholson, Pollock, Buffet, Brancusi, De Chirico, Leger, Delauney, De Kooning, Kokoschka, Klee, and Schwitters.  Apparently, the Pythons are big art fans...you'll never see such name dropping in any other comedy television series. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of Monty Python calls the bicycle race in a rather energetic fashion from the Tolworth Roundabout at the A-3 as Sam Trench?", "correct": "Cleese", "options": ["Chapman", "Palin", "Idle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCleese.\n\n\tCleese's ability to speak so quickly and precisely makes him perfect for the role of announcer in such a fast-paced event.  Sadly, it is reported that Picasso took a spill and was forced to drop out of the race.  No word came through as to which artist won the race. \n"}, {"text": "The final sketch in the first episode is the 'world's funniest joke' sketch, a Monty Python classic.  Who was the original author of the world's funniest (and most lethal) joke?", "correct": "Ernest Scribbler", "options": ["Ron Obvious", "David Unction", "George Head"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErnest Scribbler.\n\n\tSadly, the joke is so utterly amusing that it takes the lives of its own creator, Ernest Scribbler, and his unwitting wife.  On the positive side, the joke was co-opted by British intelligence and made into a weapon lethal at up to 50 yards.  It's first deployment was on July 8, 1944 in the Ardennes. \n"}, {"text": "Do we ever hear the English translation of the world's funniest joke during this episode?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tLucky for us the answer is no.  The German translation of the joke is as follows: 'Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja!...Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!'  Reports suggest that, indeed this is nonsense German, and hence there is no English translation.  Several other jokes are told during this sketch, including one that is a German attempt at retaliation.  It goes: 'There were 'zwei' peanuts walking down the 'strasse' and one was assualted...peanut.' Amusing, but nowhere near as funny as the 'world's deadliest joke'.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you found it almost utterly meaningless! \n"}]}
