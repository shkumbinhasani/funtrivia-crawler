Hence, he sends a certain Captain to the 4077th to investigate the psychiatric well-being of the staff there.  What is this Captain's surname?", "correct": "Hildebrand", "options": ["Thompson", "Millbanks", "Cooper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHildebrand.\n\n\tCaptain Hildebrand was played in this episode by actor Anthony Holland, who appeared in such films as 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Klute'. \n"}, {"text": "Before sending this psychiatric specialist to the 4077th, General Clayton describes several members of the staff there.  How does he describe Henry as an administrator?", "correct": "Fair to middlin'", "options": ["Nincompoopish", "Completely incompetent", "Top drawer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFair to middlin'.\n\n\tGeneral Clayton obviously respects Henry, calling him a 'fine surgeon', but he is not so impressed by Henry's leadership skills.  \r This is the first of four appearances for Herb Voland in 'M*A*S*H' season two episodes.  He also appeared in three season one episodes as General Clayton. \n"}, {"text": "General Clayton continues on, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each member of the 4077th staff.  What is the critical word he uses to describe Frank?", "correct": "Prude", "options": ["Obnoxious", "Bungling", "Loud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrude.\n\n\tGeneral Clayton actually calls Frank a 'competent' surgeon.  Apparently he didn't discuss this with Hawkeye.  Clayton is also of the opinion that Frank is a prude.  Clayton calls Margaret an 'angel of mercy', which is no surprise considering the fact that the two have a history together! \n"}, {"text": "According to General Clayton, only Henry is supposed to know about this camp psychiatric evaluation.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tGood luck with that!

Good luck enforcing it, Henry! \n"}, {"text": "When Henry introduces the psychiatric evaluator to Trapper and Hawkeye, he claims that the Captain is a doctor.  What is his specialty, according to Henry?", "correct": "Gynecology", "options": ["Oncology", "Proctology", "Pediatrics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGynecology.\n\n\tWhile Henry says 'gynecology', Hildebrand suggests he's an 'ears, nose and throat' man.  In the mess tent, the doctors are on their best behavior.  They even suggest that they are planning to open a practice together after the war, with Hawkeye pointing out that Frank will be the parking valet. \n"}, {"text": "After observing some zany antics at the 4077th, the psychiatric evaluator has come to several conclusions.

Specifically, he says: 'Not childlike, with its connotations of innocence and joyous abandon, but childish.  Delight in petty bickering, summer-camp capers and in general behavior that is ill befitting officers in the United States Army and members of the medical profession.' \n"}, {"text": "Just as it seems that the 4077th staff is going to be broken up, wounded soldiers arrive.  After watching this crack surgical team at work, the psychiatric evaluator has a different opinion of them.  He praises them highly to General Clayton, while at the same time suggesting that they engage in several 'isms', including fetishism and...?", "correct": "Voyeurism", "options": ["Malapropism", "Anarchism", "Albinism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVoyeurism.\n\n\tThis quote from Hildebrand says it all: 'In my short stay here I have seen textbook examples of neuroses, psychoses. I have seen voyeurism, fetishism, and a few isms I've never even heard of. And let me tell you this, General. These impossible people are in an impossible place, doing totally impossible work. They're mad, quite mad, all of them. And the only act I can think of that would be madder still, would be breaking them up.' \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the episode, we get a rundown of the characters/cast members.  Which of these is not mentioned in these closing 'credits'?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Klinger", "Hot Lips", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tOddly enough, Father Mulcahy (William Christopher) is not listed as a 'regular', though he was listed as such during the first season.
