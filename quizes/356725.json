Bonney a.k.a. Billy the Kid, was a famous Old West gunslinger that was shot and killed by which of the following, equally famous, Wild West figure? ", "correct": "Sheriff Pat Garrett", "options": ["Constable Wyatt Earp", "Deputy Marshall John Holliday", "Detective Allan Pinkerton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheriff Pat Garrett.\n\n\tBilly the Kid (1859-1881) is one of the most famous characters of the Old West. In every different resource you look at, you will find different \"facts\" about his life and death listed. Some books state that this outlaw killed as few as four men while others list as many as 21. Sheriff Pat Garrett, who is believed to have killed Billy the Kid, wrote a biography about him called \"The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid\" which was published in 1882. Rumors started early on, that Billy the Kid was not actually dead and up until at least 1949 there were men who claimed to be the mythologized gun fighter.Genetic testing proved that none of these men were the real Billy the Kid. The truth about his life will probably never be known for sure. \n"}, {"text": "Although a famous Wild West figure, which of these men probably killed fewer than three men, and spent most of his later life as a sport writer and editor for \"The New York Morning Telegraph\"?", "correct": "Bat Masterson", "options": ["Wyatt Earp", "Frank James", "William Quantrill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBat Masterson.\n\n\tWilliam Barclay \"Bat\" Masterson (1853-1921) undoubtedly led a colorful life, but much of the detail may have been pure fiction. The self-promoting Masterson lived in the Arizona Territory during a period of high crime and did meet many of the Wild West's more infamous characters. He was at one time a deputy U.S. Marshal, gambler, and newspaper columnist.He was known to buy old pistols, carve notches in the handle and then pawn them for money, claiming they were his famous guns used while he was an \"outlaw\". The real truth about Masterson's exploits are, usually, part fiction. It was often claimed that he killed 26 men, when, in reality, he probably only killed one and was involved in only three gunfights.He died of a heart attack while sitting at his desk at \"The New York Morning Telegraph\". \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these names that sounds like the name of a bird was actually also the name of an Old West gunslinger?", "correct": "King Fisher", "options": ["Mute Swan", "Sea Gull", "Blue Jay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKing Fisher.\n\n\tKing Fisher (1854-1884) was a flamboyant Texas gunman and gang leader. Most of his crimes were against Mexican gangs and he was known on both sides of the border for the speed of his guns. Like many other gunslingers of the time, he also worked on the other side of the law occasionally. In 1883 he became the sheriff of Uvalde County, Texas and was known for catching everyone he went after.King Fisher was killed at the age of 30 by another desperado after attending a play at the Turner Hall Opera House in San Antonio, Texas. The exact number of his kills is unknown, but most historians agree that the number is over 25 and possibly as many as 50. \n"}, {"text": "Like many of the other gunfighters of the Old West, Dallas Stoudenmire was involved in which of the following before moving out west?", "correct": "The American Civil War", "options": ["The Spanish American War", "The War of 1812", "The Battle of the Alamo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe American Civil War.\n\n\tMany of the Old West's gunfighters were veterans of the American Civil War. Dallas Stoudenmire was just another disillusioned soldier who had survived the horrendous battles of the American Civil War and was left looking for a way to make a living. As with many of the Old West's legendary gunfighters, he was known as a gunfighter as well as being employed as a lawman at times.He may not be as famous as some of the other men in this quiz, but he was probably involved in more actual gunfights than most of them, as well as being more famous while he was alive. Many Old West figures did not become famous until after their deaths, by which time their exploits were often exaggerated.An exact death count for Stoudenmire is not known but he is thought to have killed at least 15 men in his lifetime. \n"}, {"text": "What is the famous nickname for the Old West figure James Butler Hickock?", "correct": "Wild Bill", "options": ["Kill Bill", "Cherokee Bill", "Buffalo Bill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWild Bill.\n\n\t\"Wild Bill\" Hickok (1837-1876) is one of the best known figures from the American Old West. Like many others he was known as a gunfighter as well as a lawman. His name has been linked with other famous/infamous figures of the time, including Buffalo Bill Cody, Calamity Jane and John Wesley Hardin. Although Hickok undoubtedly killed over 15 men in his lifetime, the exact count will never be known.Hickok died while playing poker at the Nuttal & Mann's Saloon in Deadwood, in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory. Hickock was holding a pair of black aces and pair of black eights in his hand when he was shot in the back of the head by a former buffalo hunter known as \"Broken Nose\" Jack McCall.This poker hand is still known as \"The Dead Man's Hand\". \n"}, {"text": "Clay Allison may have been one of the Old West's most famous gunfighters, but in which unusual manner did he die?", "correct": "He fell of the back of a wagon and broke his neck.", "options": ["He drowned in a bathtub while drunk. ", "He was struck by lightning.", "He died from radiation poisoning."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe fell of the back of a wagon and broke his neck.\n\n\tClay Allison (1840-1887) is believed to have shot and killed at least 15 men. He was discharged from the Confederate Army for reasons of mental illness described as partly epileptic and partly maniacal. He was known for his psychotic behavior when drinking, and most of the men he killed took place while he was drinking. Allison died when he tried to catch a sack of grain that fell off his wagon. He fell off the wagon, which then rolled over him, breaking his neck. Some might find this a rather ignominious death for one of the Old West's most legendary gun fighters. \n"}, {"text": "Jim \"Killer\" Miller also known as \"Deacon Jim\" was known for which of these predilections?", "correct": "He went to church every Sunday.", "options": ["He was known to wear a pink hat.", "He carried a cup of coffee everywhere he went.", "He rode a cow instead of a horse."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe went to church every Sunday.\n\n\tDeacon Jim (1866-1909) was one of the most sadistic of the Old West figures. He is known to have killed between 12-50 men. He was a hired killer who openly stated he would kill anyone for money. In spite of this, he went to church every Sunday, and did not smoke, drink, or curse. He served a term as a lawman, during which he gained the reputation of shooting many Hispanic and Indian prisoners, claiming they were all trying to escape.He was rumored to have worn an iron plate under his black frock coat, and was probably the inspiration for this act which was portrayed by Clint Eastwood in the 1964 western \"A Fistful of Dollars\". He was hung by a lynch mob in a stable in Ada, Oklahoma for the murder of a Deputy U.S. Marshal.\n"}, {"text": "What was the cause of death for John Henry \"Doc\" Holliday, one of the Old West's most notorious figures? ", "correct": "Tuberculosis", "options": ["Syphilis", "Shot at the \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\"", "Hung for murder in Yuma, Arizona "], "explanation": "\n\n\nTuberculosis.\n\n\tDoc Holliday (1851-1887) died from tuberculosis, the same disease that killed his mother when he was 15. While he was involved in the incident that came to be known as \"The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\", he was not one of the three men who died at the infamous confrontation. As with most figures of the Old West his death count is probably inflated though he probably killed at least 10 men.He died in a hotel in Glenwood Springs, Colorado after suffering for years from the dreaded disease known at the time as consumption (tuberculosis). He is one of the most romanticized figures of the Old West, having been portrayed in numerous movies, television programs and novels. \n"}, {"text": "John Wesley Hardin, one of the Old West's most famous gunfighters, served 16 years in prison and when he got out he became an attorney.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tJohn Wesley Hardin was known for carrying two pistols which he carried strapped to his chest.

At the age of 25 he was caught by a team of Texas Rangers and served 16 years in prison.While in prison he wrote his own autobiography and started studying the law. When he was released from prison he passed the bar exams and became an attorney. As with most gunfighters of the time, the truth about his life tended to become blurred by publicity, rumor and folk legends.

The character is an aging gunfighter who has come to town to confirm with the town doctor that he is dying of cancer. The story focused on the end of the era known as the Wild West, as western parts of the U.S. attempted to move into the industrialized 20th century.In real life, very few desperados grew old, as most were killed by other gunfighters, or executed for their crimes.
