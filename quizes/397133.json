{"id": "397133", "name": "10 Question Movie Quiz: Doctor Strange |     Movies", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Doctor Strange"], "questions": [{"text": "Kaecilius robs the Kamar-Taj, but what does he steal?", "correct": "Pages from a book", "options": ["A rare stone", "A child", "The sacred cloak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPages from a book.\n\n\tA librarian files away books in the library of the Kamar-Taj before he's surrounded and strung up by the members of an enemy order.  Their leader, Kaecilius, does the honours by beheading the librarian and unchaining one of the room's many works.  He tears the relevant pages free from the book before dropping it on the ground. When a hooded figure in yellow enters, he's warned that his theft of the pages will bring great sorrow before a portal is opened and a chase commences in the city of London.  The yellow-garbed figure traps Kaecilius and his men, inverting the street they're on so that they may fight on its side, but Kaecilius escapes through another wormhole. The one in yellow has no choice but to be on her way. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Stephen Strange specializes in which of these?", "correct": "Neurology", "options": ["Cardiology", "Oncology", "Ocular surgery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeurology.\n\n\tIn New York City, Dr. Stephen Strange preps to perform a complicated surgical operation.  Dr. Palmer, who Strange once went out with for a short time, comes to him with another patient issue and he diagnoses on the spot, recognizing a very odd case involving a bullet lodged in a brain.  Strange, stuck for time, opts to remove the bullet free-hand, successfully extracting it with the steadiest hands in the business.  It saves the man's life.\rHeading out to an event out of the city, Strange dresses up and drives his fast car through the winding roads of the New York mountains, weaving through the traffic on the dark, twisting trail, and it starts to rain.  As he takes his eyes off the road to look at an x-ray, he crashes the vehicle, spinning out of control off the road and crushing his hands in the accident. \n"}, {"text": "Jonathan Pangborn recovered from which of these through spiritual elevation?", "correct": "Paralysis", "options": ["Deafness", "Dementia", "Blindness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParalysis.\n\n\tStrange is brought to the hospital and despite the horrible accident he survives.  That being said, the crash caused severe nerve damage to his hands and the resulting surgery meant that 11 steel pins had to be placed into his bones to keep the limbs functioning.  He makes a recovery, personally, but his hands have to undergo numerous extra surgeries, many of which are experimental and at his discretion and expense.  During rehabilitation, he's told that there was a former patient, at one time, who recovered from a severe factory accident and, after a year, overcame his muscle pain to be able to walk again.  Strange demands the man's file; he can't believe it's true.\rHe receives the file in the mail when he's at his wit's end and seeks out the patient, Jonathan Pangborn, in the city, finding the man playing basketball.  Pangborn, seeing Strange's dilemma, tells him that instead of seeking a cure for his injuries, he sought to elevate his mind, finding the miracle he needed by reaching an elevated state in a place known as Kamar-Taj. \n"}, {"text": "Strange find the Kamar-Taj in what nation?", "correct": "Nepal", "options": ["China", "India", "Mongolia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNepal.\n\n\tStrange, seeking his miracle, flies to Kathmandu, Nepal and asks around to find the Kamar-Taj, inevitably being found by someone of the order in his aimless wandering.  At one point, Strange is cornered in an alley by thugs and beaten, but the man who's been following him intervenes, allowing him to follow him through the city. The man gives some advice: to forget everything he thinks he knows.  And as they walk through a building speaking of 'The Ancient One', Strange meets the figure - a woman who seems to already know about him and his predicament.  She serves him tea and admits that she helped Pangborn by convincing him he could; she says that while nerves can attach themselves and heal in one specific way, she believes the body can find other ways if compelled. Strange, shocked, asks why she's sitting on such cutting edge medical technology, but she says she can instead reorient the spirit to better heal the body. \n"}, {"text": "As soon as The Ancient One meets Steven Strange, she allows him to learn from her.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhen The Ancient One opens a book for Strange, she shows him about the chakras and acupuncture techniques and it sets him off.  He believes that she's a hack and that he's wasted his money coming to Nepal for a scam, but she states that he's simply not opening his mind; he's looking at things too narrowly, almost as though he can't see all the parts of the whole.  And as he arrogantly walks up to her, she grabs his hand and pushes him back, separating his astral form from his body for a brief moment, allowing him to enter the Astral Dimension.  It proves one thing: he has no idea what he's in for.\rShe sends him reeling through the other dimensions, experiencing the multiverse first hand as he hurtles through a fraction of what's out there.  And when he crashes back down at The Ancient One's feet, he asks her to teach him.  She refuses though, kicking him out.\rIt takes hours of Strange banging on their doors before she's convinced that his strength and arrogance, while potentially a problem, remind her of her former student, Kaecilius.  She and her other student, Mordo, realize that despite the risk that Kaecilius became after his studies, they could use a man like Strange.  So they let him in. \n"}, {"text": "To force Strange to use his powers, The Ancient One sends him where?", "correct": "Mount Everest", "options": ["The middle of the ocean", "The moon", "A crypt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMount Everest.\n\n\tTo be able to harness the energies of the multiverse and perform spells as per the teachings of The Ancient One, Strange needs to study, just like he did to be a world-class neurologist.  He takes this very seriously, meeting Wong, the librarian of the Kamar-Taj, who gives him more advanced readings to indulge in.  During their time in the more advanced section of the library, Strange comes upon the Master's private collection of books, learning of Kaecilius' theft of a ritual from a book about time.\rStrange's studies continue and, during a lesson on utilizing the Sling Ring, a device that can allow sorcerers to teleport themselves anywhere they envision, The Ancient One brings him aside, urging him to silence his ego to surrender to the magic.  She then takes him through a portal to the summit of Mount Everest and, expecting him to go into shock in minutes, departs, expecting him to use magic to find a way back.  Summoning the strength and letting go, he manages to make it back to the courtyard on his own.  That night, for the first time in months, his hands are steady enough for him to shave and groom.\rElsewhere, Kaecilius calls upon the power that he and his acolytes can use to lash out against the one who betrayed them. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these cities does not contain a sorcerer Sanctum?", "correct": "Paris", "options": ["New York City", "London", "Hong Kong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParis.\n\n\tStrange's skills advance quicker than The Ancient One could have ever expected, and to help him test out his more dangerous spells, she invites him to the Mirror Dimension, where he can't be detected.  From there, they can surveil and imprison.  Strange also learns combat from Mordo who, at the same time, talks of Kaecilius' refusal to follow The Ancient One's ways and the existence of relics of great power.  When the time comes, and the relic decides, Strange may yet have his own.\rOn a trip to the library, Strange learns of the Eye of Agamotto, using his powers to open it while the library appears to be empty.  Using its magic, he finds that he is able to control time and, thinking on this, he magically re-forms the book's pages, allowing him to read about the Dark Dimension and the evil denizen therein, Dormammu.  Mordo and Wong find him there, reading the pages, and chastise him for performing the spell since temporal manipulations can create branches in time and, with that, unstable dimensional openings.  Time loops could put everyone in danger.  No one should tamper with natural law.\rMordo and Wong have no choice but to tell Strange more, if only to protect them all.  As sorcerers, they are on Earth to protect it from mystical threats in the same way that The Avengers protect it from physical ones.  The original Ancient One created Structures of Power in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, and the doorways exist in Kamar-Taj.  They shield the planet and the sorcerers protect them from beings in the multiverse.  Some beings, like Dormammu, have infinite power and seek to destroy Earth, bringing it to the Dark Dimension.\rAs they speak, the door to the London sanctum opens and Kaecilius fires through the threshold.  Strange is knocked through another door. \n"}, {"text": "The cloak relic found by Strange has what power?", "correct": "Levitation", "options": ["Mind control", "Invisibility", "Everlasting life"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLevitation.\n\n\tHeading out the front door of the building he's been sent to, Strange finds himself on Bleecker St. in New York City.  The place is empty though, and it take him a while of looking around before he finds Kaecilius and his disciples breaking in.  Strange emerges when the master of the Sanctum is killed but he's not powerful enough to succeed against several of them at once, and when Kaecilius manipulates the surroundings around Strange, he stands next to no chance.  The battle progresses into a hall of relics where Kaecilius, tossing Strange around, ends up breaking through several glass display cases.  Just as Strange is about to be killed by Kaecilius... numerous times... a cloak flutters in to wrap itself around him and, in a sentient manner, helps him gain the upper hand, entrapping the evil sorcerer long enough to talk alone with him.  Though Kaecilius speaks to Strange about healing and everlasting life, he puts doubts into his mind.  The truth is that The Ancient One has been using the Dark Dimension to keep herself eternally young.\rStrange is attacked by one of Kaecilius' disciples during this time and while the cloak relic is able to ward off the enemy, wrapping itself around his head, Strange is able to escape into the hallway of his old hospital, find Christine, and get into an operating theatre to save his life.  His astral body is able to communicate with her to perform the procedure the way he knows he needs to...even if that means getting into a fight in another dimension. \n"}, {"text": "Is Doctor Strange able to save The Ancient One in the operating room?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tStrange returns to the New York Sanctum to find the cloak waiting for him.  Kaecilius has departed.  Mordo and The Ancient One arrive to find him and commend him for attracting the attention of the Cloak of Levitation (it's very fickle, apparently).  The Ancient One suggests that, since the New York Sanctum needs a new master, Strange could take up the mantle, but he doesn't take to the idea, especially since it puts people at great harm.  It escalates to an argument in which Strange reveals what he knows about Kaecilius' abilities to manipulate space and time in the material dimension and The Ancient One's immortal ways, and though The Ancient One brushes him off, Mordo is caught off-guard, worrying that she may be lying to him.  Kaecilius returns while Strange and Mordo talk and Strange pulls them all into the Mirror Dimension to protect New York.  Unfortunately, it proves to be a near-suicidal decision as Kaecilius' dark powers are enhanced there.\rStrange is only saved by The Ancient One who tries to talk sense into her former student and protect her newer ones.  A fight begins, but it ends quickly; Kaecilius stabs through one of his pupils and through The Ancient One's stomach before tossing her through a portal and hurtling to the ground, hundreds of feet below.\rStrange rushes The Ancient One to the hospital, but while their physical bodies remain in the operating room, the two of them speak alone in the Astral Dimension, musing on the lesson Strange must still learn: it's not all about him.  She knew her life would end where they are in place and time, but his possibilities are endless and, in many cases, good for the universe.  With his ability to bend the rules to succeed and Mordo's strength, they can defeat Kaecilius and prevent Dormammu from taking Earth into the Dark Dimension.\rThe Ancient One dies on the operating table. \n"}, {"text": "In the end, who is taken into the Dark Dimension by Dormammu?", "correct": "Kaecilius", "options": ["Doctor Strange", "Mordu", "The Ancient One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKaecilius.\n\n\tKaecilius travels to Hong Kong and the final Sanctum to find Wong guarding the premises.  Kaecilius, of course, makes short work of him out on the streets in front of the building.\rStrange reunites with Mordo in the Kamar-Taj and while Mordo's faith in sorcery is shaken, the two of them know they must head to Hong Kong to intercept Kaecilius and stop Dormammu.  They make it to Hong Kong, but the Sanctum has already fallen; they're too late, and the Dark Dimension is upon them.  But Strange has a way of fixing things  Using the Eye of Agamotto, he reverses time, allowing him and Mordo to have a second chance to save Earth.  By breaking the laws of nature, Strange saves the citizens of Hong Kong and resurrects Wong, but Kaecilius stops them from returning to the Sanctum, freezing time in its moment while the Dark Dimension waits beyond time.\rStrange, realizing this power, flies alone into the Dark Dimension and seeks out Dormammu, finding him there and seeking a bargain.  Dormammu, unbelieving in Strange's abilities, kills him simply.\r... But using the power of the Eye of Agamotto, Strange resets the timer on his life, returning on a loop and repeating the moment for eternity.  Though Strange and Dormammu will be stuck in the moment for eternity, forever living out Strange's death, the people of Earth will be separate, able to live on outside the loop.  \rDormammu, eventually seeing himself as a prisoner to Strange's abilities, gives in.  Strange forces Dormmamu to take Kaecilius and his disciples and leave Earth alone forever, and when he does, he ends the loop.  Strange returns to Hong Kong to see Kaecilius get pulled into the Dark Dimension and vanish with it.  He turns back time, restores the Sanctum, and Earth is none the wiser.\rMordo, inflexible, is still shocked that they violated the natural order and that they will be punished for what they've done.  He leaves the Kamar-Taj behind, vowing not to follow the same path.  Strange remains there, in a sense, to return the Eye of Agamotto.  Wong agrees with this decision; the Infinity Stone within the relic is not for bringing onto the streets.\rStrange takes up the mantle as the Master of the New York Sanctum to continue his research. \n"}]}
