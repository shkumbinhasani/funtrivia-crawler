{"id": "13053", "name": "Leonardo, Michelangelo, or Raphael? Trivia Game | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Renaissance Art"], "questions": [{"text": "Who studied under Verrocchio in Florence?", "correct": "Leonardo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonardo.\n\n\tVerrocchio, old 'Mr. True-eye' (his name translates as that from Italian), was a wonderful painter and sculptor in his own right.  However, his reputation as the greatest sculptor during the period in between Donatello and Michelangelo has taken a back seat to his reputation as Leonardo's teacher.  Perhaps he should have selected a less virtuous pupil? \n"}, {"text": "Who painted the work 'The School of Athens'?", "correct": "Raphael", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaphael.\n\n\tThe 'School of Athens' features portraits of Raphael and Michelangelo, along with a who's who of great Greek philosophers.  Walking down the center of the painting we see Aristotle and Plato in deep discussion. \n"}, {"text": "Who painted a famous mural in about 1495 in Milan?", "correct": "Leonardo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonardo.\n\n\tThat mural being the 'Last Supper', which can be found in the refectory of Sta Maria delle Grazie in that lovely Italian town Milan. \n"}, {"text": "Whose master was Perugino?", "correct": "Raphael", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaphael.\n\n\tAs you might have guessed, Perugino was from Perugia, in Italy.  Pietro Perugino also studied with Verrocchio, probably right alongside Leonardo, hence we see a pattern emerging among our great High Renaissance painters.  Ironically, the Pre-Raphaelite painters placed Perugino on a pedastel, dismissing his great pupil as entirely too affected! \n"}, {"text": "Who sculpted 'Moses'?", "correct": "Michelangelo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichelangelo.\n\n\tHis Moses was sculpted for the tomb of Pope Julius II.  Upon the head of Moses can be found two horns, interesting.  Michelangelo also sculpted his two slaves, now located in the Louvre, for the Pope's tomb. \n"}, {"text": "Who studied under the Ghirlandaio?", "correct": "Michelangelo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichelangelo.\n\n\tWe know that Ghirlandaio trained with Baldovinetti, but it has been suggested that he also was apprenticed to Verrocchio at some point, completing the connection among our three great painters featured in this quiz!  His son Ridolfo was a portrait painter, and a very good friend of Raphael's.  Can you imagine all of these great men and their interactions? \n"}, {"text": "Which of the three was born first?", "correct": "Leonardo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonardo.\n\n\tLeonardo was born in 1452, Michelangelo in 1475 and Raphael in 1483.  All three were painting contemporaries in Florence during the early 16th century. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the three artists had a friendship with Vittoria Colonna, who inspired many of his sonnets?", "correct": "Michelangelo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichelangelo.\n\n\tMichelangelo's lovely sonnets to Vittoria Colonna are relatively ignored by the art-loving public, vastly overshadowed by his sculpture and painting.  However, they are a worthy read. \n"}, {"text": "Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine chapel?", "correct": "Michelangelo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichelangelo.\n\n\tWell, we all know the story of his tremendous 4-year labor...it must have been back-breaking work.  Michelangelo set up apparatus so that he could lie horizontally while vigorously painting the amazing biblical scenes which are still vivid and deeply moving up to this day. \n"}, {"text": "Who died at the relatively young age of 37?", "correct": "Raphael", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaphael.\n\n\tSadly, Raphael only lived 37 years, from 1483-1520. If he had lived a full life, who knows the wonders he could have produced? Michelangelo lived 89 years, while Leonardo lived for 67 years.  I hope that you enjoyed this quiz...thank you for playing! \n"}]}
