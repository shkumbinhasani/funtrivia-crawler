In those 18 seasons, they went to the World Series an amazing 15 times.  In that run, they won five consecutive Series from 1949-1953.  During that five year run, they couldn't lose with the bats of Berra, Collins, Gehrig, Rizzuto, and DiMaggio.  Casey Stengel took them to 10 of those Series.  Where is the error in this?", "correct": "Gehrig had already retired", "options": ["Casey Stengel never managed the Yankees", "No team has won five consecutive World Series", "DiMaggio's career had not begun yet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGehrig had already retired.\n\n\tGehrig not only had retired, but he died in 1941.  DiMaggio played from 1936-1951.  In those 15 appearances, the Yankees won it all ten times.  This would end the dominance of the Yankee club until 1996, when Joe Torre took over the reins of the club.\rTheir ten titles were: 1947, 1949-50-51-52-53, 1956, 1958 and 1961-62. \n"}, {"text": "The 1927 Yankees were one of the greatest teams in baseball history.  They went 110-44 for the season.  It was easy with Ruth's 60 home runs, the fourth time he had hit over 50.  The pinstripes also had the bat of Lou Gehrig, who hit 47 home runs of his own.  From the speed of Bob Meusel and the arm of 22 game winner Waite Hoyt, the Yankees were a heavy favorite to win the World Series.  They did indeed, by skunking the Pirates in four games.  Can you find the error?", "correct": "It was not Ruth's fourth time to hit 50", "options": ["Meusel never led the team in steals", "The Series went five games", "Hoyt won 20 games"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was not Ruth's fourth time to hit 50.\n\n\tRuth, prior to the 1927 season, hit 54 in 1920, then 59 in 1921.  Ruth's fourth time to hit 50 or more was in 1928.  Ruth also hit two World Series home runs in 1927.  These were the only home runs in the Series.  Meusel led the Yankees in stolen bases with 24 in 1927.  Hoyt was 22-7 in the season. \n"}, {"text": "There have been some young players join the Majors throughout time.  Did they join too early?  Alex Rodriguez was 18 when he made his debut with the Mariners, and hit no home runs in his first season.  Robin Yount was also 18 when he began with the Brewers.  How about the Mets' Ed Kranepool, who began his career at the young age of 17.  What about Joe Nuxhall, the first little leaguer to play in the Majors at age 15?  Bob Feller was 17 when he began his career with the Indians.  Were they too young?  Where is the error?", "correct": "Nuxhall was not a little leaguer", "options": ["Kranepool began as a Padre", "Yount was 17", "Rodriguez hit one home run in his first season"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNuxhall was not a little leaguer.\n\n\tJoey Jay was the first little leaguer to play in the Majors.  In 1953, Jay pitched for the Milwaukee Braves.  He played for 13 seasons, and retired in 1966 with 99 wins. \n"}, {"text": "The greatest pitcher of all-time is always debated.  Sandy Koufax of the Dodgers, Walter Johnson of the Senators and Pirates, or the great Cy Young who had an award named after him.  How about the first left-hander to reach 4000 career strikeouts, Steve Carlton?  Jack Chesbro won 41 games in the 20th century.  Harvey Haddix pitching 12 perfect innings in a game?  How about the great Satchel Paige, who pitched in a game at the age of 58?  Without debate, those were all pitching greats.

He was not credited with a perfect game.  Chesbro threw 41 wins, setting a 20th century record in 1904 with the New York Highlanders (later Yankees).  Paige, pitched for the Athletics in 1965 at age 58.  Johnson's career spanned 21 seasons with the Senators, retiring in 1927.  Walter was inducted into the Hall in 1936. \n"}, {"text": "Without umpires, baseball would be chaos.  There have been some umpiring greats in baseball.  In the American League, from Cy Rigler, Billy Evans, Bill McGowan, to Tom Connolly who served for 31 years.  In the National League it was Bill Klem, who umpired 17 World Series  over his 37 year career.  How about Silk O'Loughlin, who was the first 'third umpire' in a World Series?

Which statement is incorrect?", "correct": "Klem umpired in 18 World Series", "options": ["Billy Evans was a NL umpire", "The 'Merkle Game' was in 1910", "Bill Summers was the first 'third umpire'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlem umpired in 18 World Series.\n\n\tKlem began his umpiring career in 1904.  He officiated in 18 World Series, the last being in 1940.  Klem was inducted into the Hall of Fame as an umpire in 1953, along with fellow umpire Tom Connolly.  The Merkle Game was between the Giants and Cubs in 1908.  In this crucial game, base umpire Bob Emslie did not see whether Fred Merkle of the Giants touched second base on an appeal call, after Merkle was singled home on the apparent winning run in the game. Emslie gave the call to home plate umpire Hank O'Day, who called Merkle out.  Chaos ensued and the game had to be stopped, and resumed at the end of the season. The Cubs ended up winning the game and the pennant.  \n"}, {"text": "The American League began in 1901 with eight teams.  The Boston Pilgrims represented the AL in the first World Series in 1901, and defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates.

He was a 1972 Hall of Fame inductee. \n"}, {"text": "There were some historical 'firsts' in the big leagues.  In 1934, the Reds were the first team to fly together by air.  In 1924, WMAQ of Chicago, was the first radio station to broadcast both teams in an area, the Cubs and White Sox, and Hal Totten was their voice.

Whether it be Scott Stratton of the Chicago Colts, who was the last pitcher to throw from a rectangular box, 50 feet away from the plate; to the 3'7\" pinch-hitter Eddie Gaedel; to Tommy Agee being the first player in history to win a Gold Glove in both leagues in 1970; or Curt Flood's attempted trade to the Phillies which started arbitration.

He pitched in only four innings of that game, but still made his name in history.  1892 was the year with the Chicago Colts of the National League. \n"}, {"text": "There were iron horse pitchers in the big leagues, who played in a bevy of games in a season.  From Pud Galvin and Hoss Radbourn in 1883, to Jim Konstanty with 74 appearances for the Phillies in 1950, to Mike Marshall who set appearance records in both leagues.  In the early days of baseball, it was common for a pitcher to appear in 50 games in a season.  Since the 1960s, and with the advent of relief pitchers and closers, 50 appearances is nothing.
