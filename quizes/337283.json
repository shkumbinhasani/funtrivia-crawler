{"id": "337283", "name": "Top of the List Quiz | Mixed 10 Questions | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Mixed 10 Questions", "  Mixed 10 Q. Very Difficult [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "Harrison, George\nLennon, John\nMcCartney, Paul\nStarr, Ringo\n\nThese four men make up the Beatles.  Who would be at the top of the list, if you were to organize them by oldest to youngest?", "correct": "Ringo Starr", "options": ["Paul McCartney", "George Harrison", "John Lennon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRingo Starr.\n\n\tRingo Starr war born on July 7, 1940, making him the oldest Beatle.  John Lennon is a close second, as he was born October 9, 1940.  Next on the list is Paul McCartney, who was born on June 18, 1942.  Finally, George Harrison was the youngest Beatle, because he was born on February 25, 1943.\r Therefore, the list from oldest to youngest is:\r Ringo Starr\rJohn Lennon\rPaul McCartney\rGeorge Harrison \n"}, {"text": "Niobium\nStrontium\nYttrium\nZirconium\n\nThese are four elements found on the Periodic Table.  Which of these elements would make it to the top of the list, if you organized that list by atomic weight, going from heaviest to lightest?", "correct": "Niobium", "options": ["Zirconium", "Strontium", "Yttrium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNiobium.\n\n\tNiobium has an atomic weight of 92.906.  Zirconium comes in second place with 91.224.  Yttrium's atomic weight drops from that of zirconium's down to 88.906.  Strontium has an atomic weight of 87.62.  These are all pretty high compared to hydrogen; which is only 1.0079!\r So the new list, reading from heaviest to lightest, should read:\r Niobium\rZirconium\rYttrium\rStrontium \n"}, {"text": "Chile\nEgypt\nTurkey\nVenezuela\n\nIf you were to organize this list so that the largest country is on top, which would that be?", "correct": "Egypt", "options": ["Chile", "Turkey", "Venezuela"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEgypt.\n\n\tEgypt wins with 387,000 square miles (1,002,000 km sq).  In second place is Venezuela with 352,140 square miles (912,050 km sq).  Turkey is next with 302,535 square miles (783,562 km sq).  Chile might look small, but it is actually only a little smaller than Turkey, at 291,933 square miles (756,102 km sq).  On a list of countries, Egypt is the 30th largest, Venezuela comes in at 33, Turkey is 37th, and Chile is 38th.\r So the new list, organizing the countries from largest to smallest, is:\r Egypt\rVenezuela\rTurkey\rChile \n"}, {"text": "Empire State Building\nPetronas Towers\nSears Tower\nTaipei 101\n\nIf you were to order these buildings in a list based on height, which would be the tallest, on the top of the list?", "correct": "Taipei 101", "options": ["Sears Tower", "Petronas Towers", "Empire State Building"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTaipei 101.\n\n\tAll of these buildings were the tallest building in the world at one point in time.\r First was the Empire State Building (New York), which was completed in 1931.  It became the tallest building then, standing at 1,250 feet.  Then, in 1974, the Sears Tower (Chicago) was completed, with a total of 1,451 feet.  In 1998, however, the 1,483 foot tall towers in Kuala Lumpur, known as the Petronas Towers, were both built, and took the record for the tallest building.  In 2004, however, the Taipei 101 (Taipei) took the title of the tallest building at a whopping 1,667 feet tall.\r So of the buildings listed, this is the order from tallest to shortest:\r Taipei 101\rPetronas Towers\rSears Tower\rEmpire State Building \n"}, {"text": "Polk, James K.\nTaylor, Zachary\nTyler, John\nFillmore, Millard\n\nThese people were all Presidents of the United States during the 19th century.  But if you were to reorganize the list, putting them from the earlier President to the latest, who would be at the top of the list?", "correct": "John Tyler", "options": ["James K. Polk", "Millard Fillmore", "Zachary Taylor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Tyler.\n\n\tJohn Tyler was president from 1841-1845.  James K. Polk took his place in 1845, and lasted to 1849 (though he wasn't a very well liked President at the time).  Zachary Taylor was president only from 1849-1850.  Millard Fillmore was the most recent, serving his term from 1850-1853.\r Therefore, the new list would read as follows:\r John Tyler\rJames K. Polk\rZachary Taylor\rMillard Fillmore \n"}, {"text": "California\nIowa\nTexas\nWisconsin\n\nIf this list were to be organized based on what date the states were admitted into the Union, with the earlier states listed first, which would be at the top of the list?", "correct": "Texas", "options": ["Wisconsin", "Iowa", "California"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTexas.\n\n\tTexas gained statehood on December 29, 1845.  Just a day short of a year later (December 28, 1846), Iowa gained statehood.  Wisconsin was next admitted into the Union May 29, 1848.  California was not a state until September 9, 1850.  These four states were states 28-31.\r So the new list would read as:\r Texas\rIowa\rWisconsin\rCalifornia \n"}, {"text": "Blue-Ringed Octopus\nDeath Stalker Scorpion\nInland Taipan (snake)\nPoison Dart Frog\n\nThese are all very poisonous animals.  If you were to devise a list of the most deadly (not most poisonous), which of these would land on the top?", "correct": "Blue-Ringed Octopus", "options": ["Poison Dark Frog", "Inland Taipan", "Death Stalker Scorpion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue-Ringed Octopus.\n\n\tThe most poisonous animal in the world is the Box Jellyfish, with a recorded 5,567 deaths caused by the jellyfish in only 50 years!  Their venom attacks the heart and nervous system.  A very interesting fact about the poisonous stonefish; the pain of the poison is said to be so great, those affected by it immediately want the limb affected amputated, and it is supposedly the most horrible pain on earth that anyone can go through.\r As far as my list, however, the blue-ringed octopus takes the cake.  It's only the size of a golf ball, but it contains enough venom to kill 26 humans in minutes.  There is no antidote.  Scarier yet is that its bite is painless; and you might not even realize you've been bitten by something harmful until it is too late.  Next is the death stalker scorpion, one of the few scorpions to actually be considered harmful to humans, though it hardly ever actually kills a human.  But it does cause some serious damage.  Next is the inland taipan, which happens to be the world's most venomous snake.  The snake has enough venom to kill 100 humans.  Even though it is far more venomous than a king cobra, the king cobra is actually considered more deadly because it injects five times as much venom, thus killing those five times faster.  It's also much longer, so has a longer range of attack.  Finally is the poison dart frog, which might be the most poisonous animal on the planet.  It has enough poison to kill ten humans.  It is called the \"dart\" frog because tribes around the area once used the frog's venom on tips of blow darts.  The frog has no need to bite, either, because the poison is in the skin.  Even touching the frog could kill a human.\r However, because of how much venom is in each animal, the potential to kill, and how many they have actually killed, the list of the most \"deadly\" might appear much different than that of the most poisonous.  Because, for instance, a poison dart frog only needs about a pin head's worth of poison to kill a human, whereas a king cobra uses much, much more, it is often considered that a poison dart frog is more POISONOUS.  However, because the king cobra uses even more venom than needed to kill, it is more DEADLY.  The list of the top 10 is as follows (with the ones from my list of four in all caps):\r Box Jellyfish\rKing Cobra\rMarbled Cone Snail\rBLUE-RINGED OCTOPUS\rDEATH STALKER SCORPION\rStonefish\rBrazilian Wandering Spider\rINLAND TAIPAN\rPOISON DART FROG\rPufferfish \n"}, {"text": "Jiffy\nMicrofortnight\nSecond\nShake\n\nThese are all terms used to measure time.  If you were to order them from the longest to the shortest in terms of time, which would be at the top of the list?", "correct": "Microfortnight", "options": ["Shake", "Second", "Jiffy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMicrofortnight.\n\n\tA microfortnight is actually defined as 1.2096 seconds.  A jiffy is 0.01 seconds, and a shake is 10 nanoseconds.  A nanosecond is a billionth of a second (or 0.000000001 seconds) which means a shake lasts 0.00000001 seconds.\r So, in terms of length of time, from longest to shortest, here is the list:\r Microfortnight\rSecond\rJiffy\rShake \n"}, {"text": "Dime\nNickel\nPenny\nQuarter\n\nThese are all US coins.  But if you were to arrange the list from most ridges to least ridges on the side of the coins, which would be on top of the list?", "correct": "Quarter", "options": ["Dime", "Nickel", "Penny"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuarter.\n\n\tThe quarter has 119 ridges, and the dime is a close second with 118.  The nickel and penny do not have ridges.  These ridges are called \"reeds\".  When coins were first produced and made out of silver, these ridges were added into the silver coins.  The reason was so that there was a design on the coins.  This way you could tell if someone had filed off the silver from the edges of the coins.  Pennies and nickels were never made of silver, so there had never been a need for ridges, or reeds.  Therefore, pennies and nickels are both smooth.\r So the list would read as follows:\r Quarter\rDime\rTied between Nickel and Penny \n"}, {"text": "\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"\n\"Rescuers, the\"\n\"Saturday Night Fever\"\n\"Star Wars: A New Hope\"\n\nAll of these movies were released in 1977.  But if you were to list them from order of release, the oldest being listed first, what would be on top of the list?", "correct": "Star Wars: A New Hope", "options": ["The Rescuers", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "Saturday Night Fever"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Wars: A New Hope.\n\n\tThe first \"Star Wars\" movie, \"A New Hope\", was released on May 25, 1977.  It was the top grossing movie of that year, more than doubling that of second place, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", which was released November 16, 1977.  \"The Rescuers\" was released on June 22, 1977.  \"Saturday Night Fever\" was not released until December 14, 1977.\r So \"Star Wars\" wins this one.  Here is the new list:\r \"Star Wars: A New Hope\"\r\"The Rescuers\"\r\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"\r\"Saturday Night Fever\" \n"}]}
