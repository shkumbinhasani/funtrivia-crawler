The skit was a take-off on \"E\" television's \"True Hollywood Stories\", but was told from the perspective of Eddie Murphy's older brother, Charlie. The stories were supposedly true events that Charlie had experienced while hanging out with his famous brother during Eddie's rise to stardom during the 1980's.\r From Charlie's account, he and Rick James had a love-hate relationship going on during the 1980s, hence the basis for the sketch. Rick James actually appeared on the show in various snippets to either confirm or refute different parts of Charlie's story. James said, \"Cocaine is a helluva drug\" several times throughout the skit in reference to several accusations by Murphy that he had behaved in a certain way. One instance involved Rick dropping by Eddie Murphy's home and stomping on his brand new couch with muddy shoes on. When this was mentioned to James, he flatly denied doing it.
