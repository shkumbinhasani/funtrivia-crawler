{"id": "146760", "name": "'Ben Hur', Part V Quiz | Ben Hur . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Ben Hur"], "questions": [{"text": "After gaining redemption against his mortal enemy Messala, Ben Hur journeys to the Valley of the Lepers to seek his family.  In the valley, he encounters Esther, who has been providing food for Ben Hur's mother and sister.  Does Ben Hur make contact with his mother and sister at this time?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tEsther informs Ben Hur of the wishes of his mother and sister, that he not look upon their faces.  While Esther gives Miriam and Tirzah baskets of food, Ben Hur hides behind a rock, painfully listening to the sound of his mother's voice.  Afterward, he makes an attempt to see them, but he is stopped by Esther's pleadings. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the rather large, bald man that accompanies Esther to the Valley of the Lepers?", "correct": "Malluch", "options": ["Lublon", "Riamondo", "Spintho"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMalluch.\n\n\tMalluch, a very large deaf-mute, was Simonides' prisonmate for a number of years.  Simonides claims that Malluch is his legs (the old man has lost the use of his lower limbs), while he is Malluch's voice.  Malluch helps block Ben Hur from entering the cave to see his mother and sister. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur and Esther venture to an apparent sermon upon a mount, given by Christ.  Which very devout character of the film meets with the two of them near a stream across from the mount?", "correct": "Balthasar", "options": ["Joseph", "Simonides", "Ilderim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalthasar.\n\n\tBalthasar, played by Finlay Currie, is the chief conduit between Ben Hur and Christ during the film.  Incidentally, Currie also plays the narrator early on in the film.  As many of you realized (and recognized from one of the earlier quizzes), Balthasar is one of the three wise men of Christian lore who see Christ in the manger at Bethlehem. \n"}, {"text": "Does Ben Hur remain to listen to Christ's sermon?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIndeed not.  Rather, he claims to have business with Rome.  He also alludes to the man that gave him water just prior to his entering the Roman galley.  He does not realize that the sermon is being given by that same man. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur is summoned for a meeting with the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate.  What is offered to the former upon his visit with the governor?", "correct": "Roman citizenship", "options": ["Command of a Roman legion", "A position in command of Judaea", "A senatorship in Rome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoman citizenship.\n\n\tNothing so spectacular as a governmental or military position, at least not at this time.  Ben Hur is offered simply his Roman citizenship, as the son of Quintus Arrius.  He decides to turn down this offer from Pontius Pilate, and returns the ring provided to him by the elder Arrius as a sign of his adoption.  Ben Hur decides to once again become a common dweller of Judaea, and perhaps a champion of the Jewish cause. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur returns to the family home after his meeting with the Roman governor.  A very emotive conversation occurs between himself and Esther.  Esther quotes Christ several times during this conversation.  Which phrase of Jesus does Esther NOT use during the dialogue?", "correct": "Turn the other cheek.", "options": ["Do good to those who despitefully use you.", "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.", "Love your enemy."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurn the other cheek.\n\n\tEsther also warns Ben Hur by uttering the adage, 'Blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.  Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.  She adds, 'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.'  Her goal is to promote a more peace-loving Ben Hur, but she fails during this conversation. \n"}, {"text": "By the end of the conversation, Esther stings Ben Hur by claiming that he is becoming more like which of the following individuals?", "correct": "Messala", "options": ["Quintus Arrius", "Pontius Pilate", "Judas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMessala.\n\n\t'You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy, giving evil for evil.  Hatred is turning you to stone.' Esther says.  'It's as though you had become Messala,' she goes on to suggest.  Ben Hur can't but stare in stunned silence at this accusation...the truth hurts! \n"}, {"text": "Esther returns to the Valley of the Lepers, this time not to provide supplies, but to exhort Tirzah and Miriam to come with her to meet Christ.  Sadly, one of the two has neared death, but which?", "correct": "Tirzah", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTirzah.\n\n\tThis time, Ben Hur has followed Esther into the Valley of the Lepers with the intention of contacting his mother and sister face to face.  Both he and Esther do more than simply contact them, however.  They both touch the leprous women, sealing their fate as well. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur and Esther return to the city, this time with Miriam and Tirzah in tow.  The trial of Christ is occurring as they enter the city streets.  The four of them wait at the side of the road while Christ walks past bearing his cross.  Ben Hur attempts to help Christ along the way by helping him carry the cross.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBen Hur indeed helps Christ, but he is no Simon.  Rather, Ben Hur attempts to repay Christ for his kindness earlier in the film by providing him with water.  The Roman soldiers do not allow the water to touch Christ's lips, however, and Ben Hur can only stand idly by and watch Christ move on to the crucifixion site.  After watching the crucifixion, Ben Hur is convinced to follow the way of peace. \n"}, {"text": "Near the end of the film, Tirzah and Miriam are miraculously cured of their leprosy.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhile Christ is depicted dying on the cross, a great rain storm occurs.  The blood of Christ is shown flowing throughout the land, with curative effects and all.  Tirzah, Miriam and Esther take cover in a cave, and the former two find themselves miraculously cured of their horrible disease.  It is suggested that Christ's blood is the source of their cure.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you will (or have) take a look at the other quizzes in this series! \n"}]}
