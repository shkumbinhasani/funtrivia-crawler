{"id": "400623", "name": "Cat Scan Trivia Game | Thematic Animals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Thematic Animals", "Thematic Cats"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these cities is in the Americas?", "correct": "St. Catharines", "options": ["Catania", "Muscat", "Mabalacat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Catharines\n\n\tFound in Ontario, St. Catharines is a city south of Toronto, closer to Niagara Falls and the United States border.  Known for being surrounded by the Niagara wine region, St. Catharines was originally founded by American Loyalists though it took its name from a local miller's wife who died shortly after the town was established.\r Catania is in Italy, Muscat is in Oman, and Mabalacat is in the Philippines. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these movies from Disney was made the earliest?", "correct": "That Darn Cat!", "options": ["The Catfish from Outer Space", "The Aristocats", "African Cats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat Darn Cat!.\n\n\tAll four of these options were actually predated by a film released in 1960, \"Jungle Cat\", which released as a documentary film set in Brazil.  That said, the first scripted feature to fit the bill is the original \"That Darn Cat!\" starring Hayley Mills and Dean Jones and featuring a wily cat who helps foil a bank robbery.  The movie was remade in the 1990s starring Christina Ricci.  \"The Aristocats\" showed up in theatres in 1970, \"The Cat from Outer Space\" was a live-action comedy from 1978, and \"African Cats\" was a DisneyNature documentary from 2011. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these was a hit single for American rock band Linkin Park?", "correct": "The Catalyst", "options": ["Catgroove", "Catch and Release", "In a World Called Catastrophe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Catalyst.\n\n\t\"The Catalyst\" was the band's leading single from their fourth album, \"A Thousand Suns\", leading them into what would be best-described as their first concept album (after \"Hybrid Theory\", \"Meteora\", and \"Minutes to Midnight\").  They continued their upward trajectory by taking in more mainstream influences in \"A Thousand Suns\" and succeeded; the album went platinum in the U.S. and the song \"The Catalyst\" appeared on four Billboard charts (topping two of them). \n"}, {"text": "If you are chewing on something, you are performing which of these actions?", "correct": "Mastication", "options": ["Prognostication", "Ossification", "Bifurcation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMastication.\n\n\tAlthough all of these are actions, mastication, derived from the Latin masticatus, means to chew or gnash teeth.  Of course, it's a bulky word so it's a bit out-of-fashion, but in scientific circles it's also listed as the first step in the digestive process; proper mastication allows you to take in the food.\r Prognostication is the act of prophecizing or divining the future; bifurcation occurs when something splits into two attached but separate parts; ossification is the bodily process of creating new bone tissue. \n"}, {"text": "We're going to look at some unique words found in the arts.  Which of these is a word that relates to a musical instrument?", "correct": "Pizzicato", "options": ["Catalexis", "Piccata", "Siccative"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPizzicato.\n\n\tPizzicato is a word used with stringed instruments and it refers to the action of plucking strings to make music rather than strumming or using a bow.  On sheet music, the action is denoted by the abbreviation 'pizz.' overtop the affected note(s).\r The other answers all have to do with different arts.  Catalexis, for instance, is literary in nature and refers to the absence of a particular stress at the end of a meter of poetry.  Meanwhile, a siccative is a drying agent used in the creation of oil-based paints.  Piccata is a bit of a stretch as it's used in culinary arts.  To prepare meat piccata, you would butterfly it, coat it in flour, and cook it in a pan with butter or lard, capers, and lemon. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these world sites or landmarks was the last to be constructed?", "correct": "The Parisian Catacombs", "options": ["The Monasteries of Popocat\u00e9petl", "Canterbury Cathedral", "The Fortifications of Luxembourg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Parisian Catacombs.\n\n\tThe Parisian Catacombs may seem like the oldest of the lot since they contain the bones of more than seven million people, but you might be surprised to know that the (under)groundwork for this landmark commenced in the mid-eighteenth century.  The Old Quarters and Fortifications of Luxembourg were started a century before that while the Mexican monasteries at Popocat\u00e9petl were built a century before those!  Canterbury Cathedral was consecrated in 1070 and construction continued for centuries after. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is a gardening implement?", "correct": "Secateurs", "options": ["Catalpa", "Muscatel", "Catbrier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSecateurs.\n\n\tYou might encounter the other options in gardens though.  Muscatel is a variety of grape known for making raisins, so if you're working in a vineyard, it's not an uncommon item to use some secateurs on.  Catbrier can also be found in certain gardens-- they're spiky vines of a sort.  Catalpa are also flowering plants.\r Secateurs, however, are pruning shears.  The name 'secateurs', is French, but it's derived from Latin; 'secare' means 'to cut'. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these actresses won an Oscar for her role in \"Blue Jasmine\"?", "correct": "Cate Blanchett", "options": ["Catherine Zeta-Jones", "Caterina Scorsone", "Catalina Sandino Moreno"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCate Blanchett.\n\n\tThough Catherine Zeta-Jones won the 'Best Supporting Actress' Oscar for her role in \"Chicago\", Cate Blanchett has a bit of a one-up having won 'Best Supporting Actress' for her role as Katherine Hepburn in \"The Aviator\" as well as 'Best Actress' nine years later for \"Blue Jasmine\" (it would be her third nomination for that award).  \rCatalina Sandino Moreno has also been up for an Oscar, appearing in the 2004 movie \"Maria Full of Grace\" (but losing to Hilary Swank in \"Million Dollar Baby\").  Caterina Scorsone is best known for her acting on TV's \"Private Practice\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of these options refers to a profession?", "correct": "Dogcatcher", "options": ["Cowcatcher", "Oystercatcher", "Flycatcher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDogcatcher.\n\n\tA dogcatcher is probably the one most people are familiar with as these figures have been seen in films and television for years.  If you need a stray dog removed from your neighbourhood, this is the person you call.\r The others aren't what you think.  Flycatchers are small birds known for catching and eating flies in the American continents while Osytercatchers, similarly, do the same thing with worms and bugs by the sea coast.  A cowcatcher isn't an animal at all; it's a metal implement affixed to the front of a locomotive designed to push away objects impeding the track. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these would be the smallest creature?", "correct": "Caterpillar", "options": ["Tomcat", "Catamount", "Seecatch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaterpillar.\n\n\tA caterpillar, of course, is a small insect which, when it eats enough, will cocoon itself to transform into a moth or butterfly.  Compared to the other answers, as odd as some might be, it's tiny.  The next-biggest would be the tomcat, a general male feline.  Above that would be the catamount, a larger feline not unlike a cougar found throughout the Americas.  The largest (though it's quite comparable to the catamount) is the seecatch, which one might know as the term for a fully-grown Alaskan fur seal. \n"}]}
