One was \"Universe of Energy\". What was the other one?", "correct": "Energy (You Make The World Go Round)", "options": ["One Little Spark", "The Energy Conudrum", "Tomorrow's Child"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEnergy (You Make The World Go Round).\n\n\tAn interesting, and well produced, documentary on energy has been replaced by \"Ellen's Energy Adventure.\" Another example of the \"dumming down\" of education in our society. \n"}, {"text": "What was the theme song to \"The Land Boat Ride\"?", "correct": "Listen to the Land", "options": ["Living with the Land", "Veggie, Veggie, Fruit, Fruit", "Symbiosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nListen to the Land.\n\n\t\"Living with the Land\" is what it is now called. Same exact ride minus the song. Go figure? \"Symbiosis\" was a great movie at The Land Pavilion that is now gone, along with the charming \"Kitchen Kabaret\" which featured the hilarious \"Veggie, Veggie, Fruit, Fruit.\" \n"}, {"text": "Now that the Dreamfinder is gone from \"Journey Into Imagination\", there is no one to sing which song?", "correct": "One Little Spark", "options": ["Magic Journeys", "It's Fun To Be Free", "Makin Memories"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne Little Spark.\n\n\tKids everywhere should declare a year of mourning.

Where was this attraction found?", "correct": "Communicore", "options": ["Wonders of Life", "Innoventions", "Journey Into Imagination"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommunicore.\n\n\tInnoventions replaced Communicore. This is one example of where the powers that be were correct in their thinking. Communicore was starting to look dated and Innoventions is closer to what Disney intended the spirit of Epcot to be. \n"}, {"text": "Now that Kodak no longer sponsers the 3-D films in Future World, which song has been 86-ed.", "correct": "Makin Memories", "options": ["Kaleidoscope of Color", "The Spectrum Song", "The Wonderful World of Color"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMakin Memories.\n\n"}, {"text": "Only one musical number at Epcot has had its original music added to, rather than removed.
