It is perhaps not surprising, then, that the city's international airport should be named after a scholar and Nobel laureate. \r Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi was born in Bologna in 1874. An electrical engineer and inventor, he is often credited with the invention of radio. He certainly shared the 1909 Nobel Prize for Physics with the German inventor Karl Ferdinand Braun for their pioneering work in the field of wireless telegraphy.\r The city itself is also one of the oldest in Europe, with human habitation here stretching back more than 3,000 years.

Federico Fellini International Airport serves Rimini, the filmmaker having been born in the city in 1920.

In 1928, he made the first Trans-Pacific flight, from Oakland, California to Brisbane via Hawaii and Fiji, a total distance of 7,187 miles which Smith and his three crew covered in a flying time of just under 82 hours at an average speed of just under 90 mph.\r Sydney's international airport was renamed in honour of Kingsford Smith in 1936. Kingsford-Smith and his co-pilot had had been attempting to break the England-Australia speed record when their plane disappeared during an overnight leg between India and Singapore November 1935. Parts of the plane were found 90 feet deep in the Andaman Sea eighteen months later, but the bodies were never recovered. \n"}, {"text": "Belfast City Airport was renamed in 2006 in honour of which of Northern Ireland's sporting heroes?", "correct": "George Best", "options": ["Pat Jennings", "Alex \"Hurricane\" Higgins", "Dame Mary Peters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Best.\n\n\tLocated next to the port, three miles from the centre of Belfast, the Belfast City Airport was renamed in honour of soccer player George Best in 2006. \r Born in Belfast in 1946, Best made his debut for Manchester United in 1963 at the age 17.

Mary Peters, although born in Lancashire in England, lived in Northern Ireland from the age of eleven. Peters represented Northern Ireland at every Commonwealth Games between 1958 and 1974, winning the pentathlon twice and the shot once, but it was representing Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the Munich Olympics in 1972 that she became the true darling of the public by winning the pentathlon. Born in Belfast in 1949, Alex Higgins won the world Snooker Championship in 1972 and 1982, and reached two other finals (in 1976 and 1980). Victory in the 1983-84 UK Championship completed the Triple Crown (World championship, The Masters and the UK) for Higgins, the third player to achieve this feat following Steve David and Terry Griffiths.
