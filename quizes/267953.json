{"id": "267953", "name": "Letter to Philemon Quiz | New Testament | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", " New Testament", " Philemon"], "questions": [{"text": "In his salutation, Paul mentions where he is writing from. It's an ironic place indeed, considering his past as a persecutor of Christians. Where is Paul penning this letter?", "correct": "From prison", "options": ["From the Colosseum in Antioch", "From the catacombs", "From a secret church"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom prison.\n\n\t\"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus,\" is how he identifies himself in verse 1. Later, he mentions his \"imprisonment for the gospel\" (verse 13) and passes along the greetings of a \"fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus\" (verse 23). Paul's tone shows confidence and optimism; he does not appear anxious about his time in jail. \n"}, {"text": "In addition to Philemon, Paul extends his greetings to several others, including \"the church in your house\" and which two early martyrs?", "correct": "Apphia and Archippus", "options": ["Sapphira and Ananias", "Prisca and Aquila", "Stephen and Dorcas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApphia and Archippus.\n\n\t\"To Philemon our dear friend and coworker,\" Paul writes in verses 1 and 2, \"to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home.\" Apphia, the wife of Philemon, was later martyred with him at Colossae, in Phrygia. Archippus -- himself an eventual martyr -- was also mentioned in the final part of Paul's letter to the Colossians: \"And say to Archippus, 'See that you complete the task that you have received in the Lord'\" (Colossians 4:17). Paul's salutations emphasize the fact that the early church really was a community, of friendship as well as of faith. \n"}, {"text": "After the salutation, Paul describes his prayers for Philemon and his gratitude for his devotion. He expresses a desire that the \"sharing of [Philemon's] faith\" will be more fruitful; what does Paul hope will make his correspondent more effective as a missionary?", "correct": "The knowledge of \"every good thing we share for the sake of Christ\"", "options": ["The \"joy and encouragement\" that come of God's love", "The responsibility of being Paul's ambassador while he is away", "The strengthening of his resolve by \"the hearts of the Lord's people\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe knowledge of \"every good thing we share for the sake of Christ\".\n\n\t\"When I remember you in my prayers,\" writes Paul, \"I always thank my God because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus\" (verses 4-5). Having delivered such a lovely compliment, he reminds Philemon that the stakes are high and that the time has come to work still harder.\r The quotations in the incorrect answer choices come from verse 7 of this passage, and refer to the pleasant results of Philemon's faith and labor thus far: \"Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord's people.\" \n"}, {"text": "Paul is writing to Philemon in order to instruct him to do something. \"Although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,\" he says, \"yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of ____.\" On what does Paul want to base his request?", "correct": "Love", "options": ["Money", "Hope", "Faith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLove.\n\n\tAfter extolling Philemon's love in verses 4-7, Paul appeals to it in verses 8 and 9. \"It is as none other than Paul-an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus- 10 that I appeal to you,\" he writes. How can anyone refuse such a request? \n"}, {"text": "Paul's instructions center on a man named Onesimus, known to Philemon and considered as \"a son\" by Paul. While explaining the situation, Paul makes a pun on the man's name. What does \"Onesimus\" mean?", "correct": "Useful", "options": ["Scholarly", "Worthless", "Lazy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUseful.\n\n\t\"I appeal to you for my son, Onesimus,\" Paul writes in verses 10-11, \"who became my son while I was in chains. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.\" Having repented of his sins, converted to Christianity, and dedicated himself to the service of God, Onesimus is finally living up to his name.\r Tradition holds that, accepted and forgiven by Philemon, Onesimus eventually became Bishop of Ephesus before being martyred in Rome; stories disagree as to whether he succumbed to stoning or to beheading.\r There was another famous Onesimus who lived much later. Enslaved by Puritan minister Cotton Mather, he is credited with saving lives during a 1721 smallpox epidemic in Boston. He recalled undergoing a form of smallpox inoculation (using a thorn to convey the infectious material) as a child in Africa, and suggested it to Mather. With the aid of Dr. Zabdiel Boylston (subsequently elected to the Royal Society in London), some 244 people were inoculated. \n"}, {"text": "\"I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel,\" Paul writes of Onesimus in verse 13. Why does Paul decide not to keep Onesimus with him, instead sending him back to Philemon?", "correct": "He wants Philemon to do a good deed of his own free will.", "options": ["Onesimus asks him for the chance to make his peace with Philemon.", "He wants Philemon's advice as to whether Onesimus is a true Christian.", "Paul's companions persuade him that Onesimus will be more useful in Philemon's household."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe wants Philemon to do a good deed of his own free will.\n\n\tPaul has the ability to give Onesimus almost everything he needs: freedom, forgiveness, fellowship, and a belief in the Gospel of Christ. Freedom and forgiveness, however, are rightly Philemon's gifts to give. \"I did not want to do anything without your consent,\" Paul writes in verse 14, \" I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary.\" Onesimus, \"that is, my own heart\" (verse 12), is Paul's messenger.Of course, Paul expresses no doubt of Philemon's eventual choice: \"Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask\" (verse 21). \n"}, {"text": "Paul wants to involve Philemon because he knows that he and Onesimus have a history. What is that story?", "correct": "Onesimus, a slave of Philemon's, ran away -- and may have stolen something in the process.", "options": ["Onesimus denounced Philemon as a Christian, putting him in grave danger.", "Onesimus married Philemon's daughter without his consent, \"stealing\" her dowry.", "Onesimus bested Philemon in a fight, embarrassing him in front of his sons."], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnesimus, a slave of Philemon's, ran away -- and may have stolen something in the process.\n\n\tWe do not know for certain whether Onesimus stole anything from Philemon, although Paul alludes to the idea that he may have in verse 18. Paul does, however, explicitly state that Onesimus was Philemon's slave, who had run away and who later learned the Gospel from Paul: \"Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever- 16 no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother\" (verses 15-16).\r This history explains Philemon's prominent position on both sides of the slavery debates. Abolitionists pointed to the fact that Onesimus was to be welcomed as a brother, and that Paul clearly saw him as Philemon's equal. On the pro-slavery side, it was argued that -- despite ample opportunities to proclaim slavery contrary to the Gospels -- Paul chose instead to frame the letter as a personal appeal, and Onesimus's emancipation as a decision only Philemon could make. \n"}, {"text": "Recognizing that Philemon has reason to be angry with Onesimus, Paul offers him a way to save face. What is Philemon supposed to do with Onesimus's debts and wrongdoing?", "correct": "Charge them to Paul's account", "options": ["Write them down and burn the paper", "Forgive them, after Onesimus apologizes", "Offer them up to God"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharge them to Paul's account.\n\n\t\"If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything,\" Paul writes in verses 18-19, \"charge it to me. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back.\" And then Paul, not one to miss an opportunity, casually notes, \"not to mention that you owe me your very self.\" It is easy to see why Christian tradition is so confident that Philemon did as Paul asked, despite there being no follow-up to this incident in the Bible: it is almost impossible to imagine Philemon doing otherwise! \n"}, {"text": "Toward the end of the letter, Paul expresses confidence that he will soon be freed from his plight. What does he tell Philemon that he will do afterward?", "correct": "Visit him", "options": ["Go to Jerusalem to meditate on the Resurrection", "Tour those parts of the Mediterranean that have not yet heard the Gospel", "Seek an audience with Caesar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVisit him.\n\n\tVerse 22 reads \"And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.\"\r This line, the last in the body of the letter, is a beautiful example of Paul's persuasiveness. In a subtle and friendly way, he lets Philemon know that he expects to be in town soon to see how he has treated Onesimus. If Philemon needs any more nudging to do the right thing, this ought to do it! \n"}, {"text": "Paul closes the letter by sharing greetings from his companions, and by bestowing a final blessing on Philemon. Whom does he name as a \"prisoner in Christ Jesus\"?", "correct": "Epaphras", "options": ["Luke", "Demas", "Mark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEpaphras.\n\n\t\"Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit\" (verses 23-25). These are familiar names! Mark and Luke are thought to refer to the writers of those two Gospels. Along with Demas, Aristarchus, and Epaphras, they all earn a mention in Paul's letter to the Colossians (where he also mentions Onesimus's journey home); Aristarchus is Paul's \"fellow prisoner\", and Epaphras \"is always wrestling in his prayers on [the Colossians'] behalf.\" (Colossians 4:9-14)\r Thank you for joining me on a visit to a brief but beautiful book of the Bible. \n"}]}
