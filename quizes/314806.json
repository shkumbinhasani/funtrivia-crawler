Herbert went to New York newspapers, but they declined to print the story, fearing libel. Stempel was eventually supported by James Snodgrass, who had sent registered letters to himself with the proof that he (Snodgrass) had been provided with answers.  Stempel proved to a Grand Jury that he had been coached on his appearance and how to act and dress.
