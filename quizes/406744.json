In a race first, Phil contacted all eleven competing teams via a video on a provided Nokia phone and instructed them to grab their backpacks and depart immediately, hopping into a waiting cab to head to the nearest airport and catch a flight to Mexico, City.  Teams would be able to collect their first clue at the Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n and embark on a race around the world.
