In the first game, this character is the second to last boss, but in the second game, he has Crash going around collecting gems to destroy Cortex.  In \"Crash Twinsanity\", he pairs himself with an old friend to defeat Cortex and gain the Evil Twins' treasure.  Who is this evil-gone-good guy?", "correct": "N. Brio", "options": ["N. Tropy", "N.

Brio went to Madame Amberly's Academy of Evil along with Neo Cortex and N. Gin.  He was Cortex's righthand man in \"Crash Bandicoot\", and switched sides in \"Cortex Strikes Back\" by creating a laser to destroy Cortex's space station. He needs Crash to gather gems to complete his laser, however, and in the end, gives Crash the honor of shooting the laser.  In \"Crash Twinsanity\", Nefarious Tropy tells Nitrus Brio to \"get changed\", and he drinks a poison to make him a giant toad to destroy Crash after he leaves N. Gin's sinking ship. N.
