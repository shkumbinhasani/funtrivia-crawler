{"id": "407246", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 29\" [6] Quiz | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 29"], "questions": [{"text": "In Leg 11, teams flew to what South Korean city?", "correct": "Seoul", "options": ["Busan", "Daegu", "Incheon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeoul.\n\n\tTeams finally left the heat of Vietnam in Leg 11, making their way out of Hoa L\u01b0 and back to Hanoi to catch a sixteen hundred mile flight north, over China, to Seoul, South Korea.  Upon landing in Seoul in the evening, teams jumped into cabs or trains and made their way to Gangnam District.  They would be able to find their next clue in front of the sign at Gangnam Station where a group of K-pop dancers would be performing for a local crowd. \n"}, {"text": "The first Road Block found in Leg 11 involved sport stacking in South Korea.  What did team members need to stack?", "correct": "Cups", "options": ["Buckets", "People", "Books"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCups.\n\n\tReaching Gangnam, teams had to proceed by taxi to Hanyang University Olympic Gymnasium for what would be the first of two Road Blocks encountered in this leg.  Here, one member of each team needed to stack up, joining the local youths in a round of sport stacking.  Using cups, participating team members were required to build pyramids with cups and properly disassemble them within seven seconds.  If they could beat the clock they would get their next clue.  Joey, Brooke, Logan, and Redmond completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "What traditional Korean dish did teams need to make during their visit in Leg 11?", "correct": "Kimchi", "options": ["Bulgogi", "Bibimbap", "Ddukbokki"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKimchi.\n\n\tFinishing the first Road Block, teams needed to travel by taxi to the Mugyewon Arts & Cultural Center where they would be able to watch a silent demonstration on how to make Korea's national dish, kimchi.  The duos would have to make six servings to the approval of their instructors, packing them into ceramic jars to ferment.  Once the task was complete they would be given a taste of completed kimchi along with their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "The second Road Block in Leg 11 forced team members to play which of these?", "correct": "A video game", "options": ["A musical instrument", "I Spy", "Pinball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA video game.\n\n\tFinishing the kimchi task, teams took their cabs back into Seoul's city centre to head to the Seoul OGN e-Stadium and a surprise second Road Block task.  Here, the team member who didn't complete the first task was forced to complete this one, meaning they had to go head-to-head against some of the best players in fighting video games. All they needed to do was win one game of \"Street Fighter V\" against the pro, but after every ten rounds, a disadvantage would be placed on the gamer (ie. blindfolded, or with an arm behind their back).  Winning a round would result in a clue.  London, Tara, Scott, and Matt had to complete this one. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was the last to be eliminated from the race in Leg 11?", "correct": "Matt and Redmond", "options": ["London and Logan", "Tara and Joey", "Brooke and Scott"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt and Redmond.\n\n\tLeaving their esports matches behind, teams were told to get into one last taxi and make their way to the race's final Pit Stop, the Gavit Some Roof Garden, where Phil would check them in and let them know if they would make it into the final leg.  Though the top three spots were highly contested throughout the evening but it was Brooke and Scott who won the leg-- their first of the race.  After making poor choices in taking the train and with bad luck in cabs, it was frontrunners Matt and Redmond who were eliminated this time, leaving three in the running. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 12, teams visited Chicagoland Speedway.  All six racers completed a lap around the track.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLeaving Seoul, South Korea for the final leg of the race, the last three teams were told that they would be flying more than six thousand miles across the Pacific to their final destination city, Chicago, Illinois, in premium class.  When they landed on home soil they took a taxi to Chicagoland Speedway for their first task. The challenge was divided between both team members.  One team member joined the pit crew to replace a tire in under forty seconds while the other hopped into the driver's seat of a NASCAR vehicle to take one lap in under forty-eight seconds.  If both could fulfill their end of the deal, they could reunite at the winner's podium and get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Teams visited three different Chicago locations based on provided riddles.  Which of these was not one of them?", "correct": "Millennium Park", "options": ["Chicago Water Tower", "Buckingham Fountain", "Wabash Avenue Bridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMillennium Park.\n\n\tAfter the speedway challenge, teams needed to take a cab to Monroe Street Station to collect their next clue from a subway worker, and what they found waiting for them was a series of riddles.  For these, teams needed to not only identify the landmarks being represented (the Chicago Water Tower, Buckingham Fountain, and Wabash Avenue Bridge), but proceed on foot and collect a postcard from each.  These postcards would lead to the next clue on the Chicago City Hall Rooftop where they could trade the souvenirs for what they needed. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 12, teams had to prepare ten of what snack for Chicago baseball fans?", "correct": "Hot dogs", "options": ["Nachos", "Peanuts and crackerjacks", "Buffalo wings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHot dogs.\n\n\tThe clue atop City Hall led teams onward to Wrigleyville Dogs where, working together, team members needed to fill a food order of ten Chicago-style hot dogs with proper fixings and bring them, on foot, to 3639 North Sheffield Avenue.  There, they would need to ascend to the rooftop viewing area, one of the local houses with seats to view the games at Wrigley Stadium from outside.  At the top, they could meet with \"Amazing Race 19\" winners Ernie and Cindy who would give them tickets to the stadium, and with those they'd gain entry to the stadium and their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "In Wrigley Field, teams found their memory challenge for the race.  What, of these, did they need to remember?", "correct": "Their leg placements", "options": ["Flags of nations", "The other teams", "Past tasks on the race course"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir leg placements.\n\n\tTeams' final task was in Wrigley Field, and it was there that, the team members split up to take on the memory challenge.  With one teammate in the press box and the others behind the scoreboard, the press box teammate needed to communicate numbers, via radio, to reflect their team placements at each Pit Stop. It wasn't as easy as putting them in order, however; communication was key since the destinations were in an order that only the press box racer could see.  If they could get the proper numbers in the proper spots, they could visit home plate and receive a series of math questions involving the placements they specified. The answers would lead to seats in the stadium where they could find their final clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which team won \"The Amazing Race 29\"?", "correct": "Brooke and Scott", "options": ["Tara and Joey", "Matt and Redmond", "London and Logan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrooke and Scott.\n\n\tThe last clue of the race, found in one of the seats in Wrigley Field, sent teams racing to the Finish Line, and for this, teams needed to take a taxi and then travel on foot through Milton Lee Olive Park where, near the water's edge, they would find out if they succeeded in conquering \"The Amazing Race\".  Despite what many would have considered significant struggles throughout the race, underdogs Brooke and Scott kept the lead throughout the leg and arrived in first place, winning the million dollar prize.  Tara and Joey arrived in second while London and Logan arrived in third. \n"}]}
