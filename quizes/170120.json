Already in his 30s, his maturity led to quick recognition of his acting talents.  For which of these films did he receive his first Oscar nomination?", "correct": "Bonnie and Clyde", "options": ["Lilith", "First to Fight", "Hawaii"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonnie and Clyde.\n\n\tHackman appeared in all of these films, but it was his portrayal of Buck Barrow, the older brother of Clyde, in the 1967 film 'Bonnie and Clyde' that first brought the recognition of the Academy.  This would not be his last nomination! \n"}, {"text": "Gene Hackman received his first Oscar for playing Detective Jimmy Doyle in the rousing action/thriller 'The French Connection'.  What is the nickname of his character in this 1971 film?", "correct": "Popeye", "options": ["Sundance", "Rocky", "Doc"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPopeye.\n\n\tThe Doyle character was based on real life detective Eddie Egan, and the film was based on a true story.  Hackman deserved the Oscar simply for having done his own driving stunts during the film! \n"}, {"text": "With which great director did Gene Hackman team in the 1974 crime thriller 'The Conversation'?", "correct": "Francis Ford Coppola", "options": ["Martin Scorcese", "Roman Polanski", "Sam Peckinpah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola.\n\n\tIn between the two 'Godfather' projects, Coppola did a little film called 'The Conversation' (released in 1974).  Funded by the money Coppola received for doing the first 'Godfather' picture, it turned out to be a low-key success.  Hackman considers it to be his personal favorite among the films he's done. \n"}, {"text": "Gene Hackman's talents are not simply confined to crime dramas and thrillers.  He has also taken several turns in comedic films.  In which of these Mel Brooks films did Hackman play a small role?", "correct": "Young Frankenstein", "options": ["History of the World Part I", "Blazing Saddles", "Spaceballs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoung Frankenstein.\n\n\tIn the 1974 film 'Young Frankenstein', Hackman played the role of Harold, a blind man who seeks a friend, even in a hideous monster.  Hackman's turn in this role was surprising and clever.  Apparently, Hackman improvised the 'Wait. Where are you going? I was going to make Espresso' line...a classic! \n"}, {"text": "Gene Hackman may be best known to Generation X kids by his role as Lex Luthor in the 'Superman' series.  In which of the 'Superman' films did Hackman not appear as Luthor?", "correct": "Superman III", "options": ["Superman", "Superman II", "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuperman III.\n\n\tHackman made apperances in the first two films of the series, appearing in theaters in 1978 and 1980, respectively, and the fourth in the series, which was released in 1987.  Hackman's comedic talent was especially portrayed in the second film...several terrific lines. \n"}, {"text": "Hackman has a penchant for war movies, this becoming rather apparent when examining his film history.  Which of these war-related films featuring Hackman deals with Vietnam?", "correct": "Uncommon Valor", "options": ["March or Die", "Under Fire", "A Bridge Too Far"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUncommon Valor.\n\n\tGene Hackman has covered virtually every war in the modern era with his film repertoire.  'March or Die' features Hackman as Major William Sherman Foster in the post-World War I Middle East.  In that film he fights with the French Foreign Legion.  In 'A Bridge Too Far', set during World War II, Hackman plays Major General Stanislaw Sosabowski. 'Under Fire' takes place in 1979 Nicaragua, wherein Hackman plays news reporter Alex Grazier.  'Uncommon Valor' features Hackman as Colonel Cal Rhodes.  He leads a group of Vietnam War veterans into Vietnam, where they rescue some of their POW buddies.  Hackman also did the Vietnam-era film 'Bat*21', for good measure. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite films from Gene Hackman was the 1986 movie 'Hoosiers'.  In this film, Hackman plays which down-and-out coach, who leads a rural Indiana basketball team to an unlikely state championship?", "correct": "Norman Dale", "options": ["Sheb Wooley", "Chelcie Ross", "Michael Sassone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorman Dale.\n\n\tWooley, Ross and Sassone all co-star alongside Hackman in this classic Cinderella story.  Dennis Hopper and Barbar Hershey also star in 'Hoosiers', a film based on the real life story of the 1954 Indiana state basketball champion Milan Indians.  'Hoosiers' was called 'Best Shot' overseas, as the producers feared that no one would understand what a 'Hoosier' was! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these actors worked alongside Gene Hackman in the highly acclaimed 1988 film 'Mississippi Burning'?", "correct": "Willem Dafoe", "options": ["Nick Nolte", "Tom Berenger", "Gary Busey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWillem Dafoe.\n\n\tHackman was once again nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in 'Mississippi Burning' (his fourth nomination), but did not take home the Oscar gold.  The film also featured the fine work of Frances McDormand, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky and Brad Dourif.  It was nominated for seven academy awards, but was beaten out by 'Rain Man' for best picture (and Hackman was beaten out by Dustin Hoffman, also for 'Rain Man' -- personally, I think Edward James Olmos should have won it for 'Stand and Deliver'). \n"}, {"text": "Gene Hackman played what awful character in an award-winning performance in the 1992 Clint Eastwood-directed, western 'Unforgiven'?", "correct": "Little Bill", "options": ["Big Bob", "Burly Brad", "Bad Bart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLittle Bill.\n\n\tIn his second Oscar-winning performance (Best Supporting Actor), Gene Hackman takes an acting turn as a bullying and despicable lawman who is ousted by the gunslinger William Munny, played by Clint Eastwood.

The film also featured the excellent work of Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these movies does Gene Hackman play an extraordinarily boring U.S. Senator?", "correct": "The Birdcage", "options": ["Get Shorty", "Behind Enemy Lines", "The Royal Tenenbaums"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Birdcage.\n\n\tHackman stars alongside Nathan Lane and Robin Williams in this very funny film based on the French movie 'La Cage aux folles'.  Perhaps the best Hackman scene occurs at the end, when he is dressed up in drag and spirited out of a nightclub featuring drag queens.
