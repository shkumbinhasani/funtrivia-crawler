{"id": "396909", "name": "Thor: The Dark World Multiple Choice Quiz |   Movies", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Thor"], "questions": [{"text": "What was the name of Odin's father?", "correct": "Bor", "options": ["Hymir", "Vili", "Tyr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBor.\n\n\tLong before all light, there was darkness, and in that darkness, there were dark elves.  Their leader, Malekith, sought to bring the universe back to eternal night using the destructive force of the Ether.  The armies of Asgard, led by Bor, Odin's father, were led into war against the dark elves on Svartalfheim. As the nine realms aligned, Malekith planned to use the ether but Asgard snatched the weapon and stole away with it, leading to the dark elves' demise.  Malekith sacrificed his own people to attempt to bring down the Asgardians and he was vanquished.  Asgard was led to believe that the ether was no more, but they could not destroy it.  Instead, they buried it. \n"}, {"text": "Upon returning to Asgard after the events in New York City, what happens to Loki?", "correct": "He's placed into the dungeon.", "options": ["He is forced to work in the mines.", "He's given a throne.", "He is banished."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's placed into the dungeon.\n\n\tLoki is brought to the Asgardian throne room in chains.  Odin reams him out for all of the actions he's taken since assisting Laufey and then traveling to Earth, all for the sake of a throne, and he sends him to live out his days in the dungeons, showing mercy on Frigga's behalf for their adopted son.\rThor, meanwhile, seeks to restore order to the Nine Realms.  He's in battle in Vanaheim at that moment alongside Sif and the Warriors Three.  As they all battle their foes, a great roar is heard and Thor must go head-to-head against a golem creature.  When Thor destroys it in a single blow, the enemy army surrenders and Thor is able to return to Asgard via the Bifr\u00f6st, restored since Loki and Thor destroyed it years earlier.  The Nine Realms are, once again, at peace, but Thor's mind is on Jane Foster.  Odin wishes for him to take the throne, but how can he? \n"}, {"text": "Where do Jane, Darcy, and Dr. Selvig end up traveling, hunting for more anomalies?", "correct": "The UK", "options": ["Norway", "Canada", "Russia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe UK.\n\n\tIn London, Jane Foster goes on a date but can't stop thinking about other things, mainly Thor, and when Darcy appears at the restaurant to interrupt the meal and point out that their equipment has been malfunctioning, she has more reason to leave.  She does, and when she joins Darcy and Darcy's intern, Ian, they try to get a hold of Dr. Selvig to investigate the reason they traveled to the UK in the first place.  They don't know that Selvig was last seen at Stonehenge, running around naked with lab equipment preaching the apocalypse.  The police take him in.\rJane, Darcy, and Ian end up at an abandoned warehouse and, there, they find that the laws of physics are operating abnormally.  Jane realizes that her readings haven't been so significant since New Mexico and she wanders off alone, accidentally getting pulled into another realm against her will. \n"}, {"text": "What term is used to describe the near-alignment of the Nine Realms?", "correct": "The Convergence", "options": ["The Folding", "The Parallax", "The Confluence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Convergence.\n\n\tOn the other side of the invisible portal, Jane emerges on the edge of a narrow platform and behind her is an obelisk of some unnatural origin.  She steps towards it, peering into the light that emanates from within it, and as she does, a dark matter reaches out and flows into her.\rAs this happens, a space vessel comes to life, re-powering itself and awakening Malekith and his men.\rIn Asgard, Thor approaches Heimdall to peer upon Jane.  They both discuss the odd occurrences in the universe as of late as the Nine Realms near alignment in an event known as the Convergence.  While most can't see it, it will cause issues across the realms.  There's an issue, however, as Heimdall can't see Jane at all, anywhere in the universe. \n"}, {"text": "What is the word given to the force that infects Jane?", "correct": "Aether", "options": ["Ambrosia", "Mana", "Miasma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAether.\n\n\tJane reawakens in the UK five hours after she vanished.  As soon as she is found by Darcy, who called the cops, she's also found by Thor, who travels across the realms to see her again.  He explains his absence as they're about to get arrested, but before anything can happen, Jane is pulled aside for trespassing and, against her will, unleashes a devastating blast of energy.  To prevent her from hurting herself and others and to prevent her from being taken to jail, Thor brings her back to Asgard with him via the Bifr\u00f6st.\rJane is brought before Asgard's finest medics but none of them can determine the cause of her infection.  It isn't until Odin sees the energy within her first-hand that Jane is able to be helped.  Whatever is inside of her predates the universe and was once used by the Dark Elves, and Malekith, to return everything to darkness.  If left inside Jane, it would use her life-force and kill her in the process.  But there's not a solution; Odin doesn't know how to remove it. \n"}, {"text": "Who, alone, is able to bring down a Dark Elf ship?", "correct": "Heimdall", "options": ["Loki", "Odin", "Thor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeimdall.\n\n\tMalekith, sensing the Aether, sends one of his strongest men, Algrim, to Asgard in an attempt to infiltrate the royal palace.  Loki watches prisoners get sent to the dungeon while he argues with Frigga, but after she leaves, Algrim springs into action, transforming into a Kursed and breaking free of his cell, killing the guards in the process.  Algrim leaves Loki in his cell, freeing everyone else.\rWhile Thor heads to the dungeons, Frigga protects Jane.  At the Bifr\u00f6st bridge, Heimdall spots and brings down a cloaked Dark Elf ship, but can't begin to take down the multitude of others that have also come in with Malekith's army.  The turrets and craft of Asgard have to stand in for defence.  Instead, Heimdall activates a barrier around the royal palace, attempting to seal it  off until Algrim destroys the technology inside.  One ship crashes straight through. \n"}, {"text": "Who is killed during the Dark Elf battle in Asgard?", "correct": "Frigga", "options": ["Odin", "Sif", "Heimdall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrigga.\n\n\tMalekith himself emerges as his forces infiltrate the palace, stepping out and sensing his way to the aether, destroying the throne along the way.  Odin reaches the throne room just too late, but realizes that Frigga and Jane are in danger.  Frigga, having armed herself, stands up to Malekith, putting herself between the Dark Elf and Jane and engaging in a sword fight.  She is, however, killed when Algrim intervenes and the Jane before them is revealed to have been an illusion.  Odin and Thor arrive moments too late to save her and she is laid to rest in a burning pyre, her spirit freed into the universe along with those who fell in the battle.\rIn London, Dr. Selvig describes the Convergence to a crowd of mental patients.  Darcy, meanwhile, tries to get a hold of him and discovers that he's on the news. \n"}, {"text": "How many people sneak into the hidden portal to Svartalfheim aboard the Asgardian ship?", "correct": "Three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree & 3.\n\n\tThor takes Odin aside because, with Asgard no longer able to be defended, Jane must be placed somewhere safe, especially since the Dark Elves are likely looming nearby.  Thor theorizes that if they can get Jane to Svartalfheim and have Malekith try and take the aether on the Dark World, they can save Jane and destroy the substance while it's exposed.  Odin vetoes this idea, but Thor disobeys his father, instead heading to the dungeons and seeking Loki's assistance, promising vengeance for the death of their mother.  He frees his adopted brother from his cell and, with the help of Heimdall, Sif, Volstagg, and Fandral, they commit a bit of treason, absconding to a secret portal and disappearing into it-- just the three of them; Thor, Jane, and Loki.\rDarcy and Ian collect Dr. Zelvig from the institution and with him they collect his prescription medication and unique lab equipment.  Something appears to be happening outside; the portals are forming more and more. \n"}, {"text": "Where, according to Dr. Selvig, is the point at which the Nine Realms will be connected?", "correct": "Earth", "options": ["Asgard", "Jotunheim", "Svartalfheim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarth.\n\n\tOn Svartalfheim, Thor, Loki, and Jane have little to do but wait, but they don't wait long.  Malekith returns to his home planet to draw the Aether from Jane and as they move in to meet the Dark Elf, Loki convinces Thor to remove his handcuffs and immediately stabs Thor, kicking him to the ground before the enemy forces and cutting off his hand.  All of this is a ruse though; as Malekith moves in and pulls the Aether from within Jane, Loki drops the illusion and Thor uses Mjolnir to blast the substance with light energy.  It doesn't work though.  While Jane is saved, the Aether crystallizes and protects itself before infusing into Malekith.  Malekith turns to leave, attempting to kill Loki on his way out, and Algrim stays back to finish the job, but the extended battle ends just as poorly.  Loki returns to save his half-brother, but ends up impaled on a Dark Elf weapon before he can get away.  He dies in Thor's arms.\rHiding away in a cave, Thor and Jane discuss their options...though those amount to none.  Malekith plans to spread the Aether starting on Earth, and with the Convergence soon to occur, it seems all too possible.  They are trapped on Svartalfheim, however.  That's when Jane receives a phone call on her cell, somehow able to get a signal.  On the cave floor, she finds the keys to her car as they'd been thrown through from the other side.  She and Thor walk a few steps and emerge back at the abandoned warehouse, and while her car may be vandalized, it still works.\rIt means that they can drive to Jane's London lab, and when they get there, they find Darcy, Ian, and Dr. Selvig already hard at work determining where the Nine Worlds will connect.  Selvig theorizes that if Malekith unleashed the Aether there, its power would be unstoppable.  The right place and the right time, they realize, can be determined by the directions given to them by millennia of records.  Right in the middle-- Greenwich. \n"}, {"text": "In the end, Thor takes up his rightful seat on the throne as the King of Asgard.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tJane, Selvig, Darcy, and Ian work together to set up Selvig's equipment to dampen the effects of the Convergence just as the Dark Elves make landfall in Greenwich.  Malekith and his forces step out as the portals begin to form around the city, but Thor is there to meet them.  They know that as long as the portals close, they'll be that much closer to foiling Malekith's plan, but in the interim, the portals continue to form, spilling the fight across the realms into Svartalfheim, Jotunheim, Vanaheim, London, and elsewhere.  The battle attracts, of all things, a frost giant from Jotunheim and while it wreaks havoc, the humans get cornered, and Thor gets tossed into the London Underground, Malekith moves back into position under the Convergence, unleashing the Aether into the portals in the skies and across the realms.  Thor reunites with Jane and Selvig at the last moment to grab their equipment, brave the darkness of the Aether, and toss the portal technology at Malekith enough to split him up in pieces across the realms, stopping the spread of darkness.  At the last moment, before Thor and Jane can be crushed by the Dark Elf ship, Selvig teleports it back to Svartalfheim, crushing Malekith in the process.  Above Greenwich, the portals seal shut.\rThor has to leave soon after, but Jane doesn't seem too worried.  After all, they committed treason on the way out of Asgard.\rIn Asgard, Thor speaks to Odin about what has been done, and in the rebuilt throne room, Thor admits to his father that he does not wish to be king, though he will protect Asgard with his life.  He can not rule from a throne.  As Thor departs, he does not see his father transform in the throne revealing that it is actually Loki seated as king. \n"}]}
