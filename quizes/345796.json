My name is Warren Moon and I entered the NFL, in 1984, with the Houston Oilers. My teams were offensive juggernauts in executing the 'Run-and Shoot' scheme, which allowed me to be selected to the Pro Bowl nine times, as well as win one NFL Offensive Player of the Year award. In which year did I win that honor?", "correct": "1990", "options": ["1991", "1988", "1987"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1990.\n\n\tGraduating from the University of Washington, in 1978, after leading the Huskies to an 11-1 season and a Rose Bowl victory over the Michigan Wolverines, 27-20, Warren Moon spent six seasons in the Canadian Football League, winning five straight Grey Cups with the Edmonton Eskimoes before entering the National Football League, in 1984.\r During his 17 year NFL career, Moon threw for 49,325 yards and 291 touchdowns, as well as recording four seasons with at least 4,000 passing (1990, 1991, 1994, and 1995). In 1990, Moon was named the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year after he threw for 4,689 yards and 33 touchdowns. He was a Pro Bowl selectee every year from 1988-1997, missing the cut only once, in 1996. In 2006, Moon became the first African-American quarterback to be elected into the NFL Hall of Fame. \n"}, {"text": "Great job, Warren! With stats like that, you certainly deserved your Hall of Fame entry. Hello, all, I'm Vince Evans and I played almost as long as Warren did. On December 7, 1980, I accomplished something which only six other quarterbacks did that decade. What was it?", "correct": "Achieved a perfect quarterback rating of 156.8", "options": ["Threw for over 500 yards", "Completed 20 consecutive passes before the first incompletion", "Threw four touchdowns of 50+ yards in the fourth quarter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAchieved a perfect quarterback rating of 156.8\n\n\tDrafted in the sixth round out of the University of Southern California, in 1977, Vince Evans played 16 seasons in the NFL for both the Chicago Bears and the Los Angeles/ Oakland Raiders, with a three year stint in the now-defunct United States Football League in between them. \r Although his career stats were not all that impressive (9,485 passing yards, 52 touchdowns, 74 interceptions), Evans did have one shining moment on December 7, 1980 against the Green Bay Packers. In that game Evans's statline read: 18-22, 316 yards, three touchdowns zero interceptions in leading the Bears to a 61-7 rout. That performance allowed him to achieve a perfect quarterback rating of 156.8 something only six other quarterbacks during that decade were able to do, and they were:\r Dave Kreig\rJoe Montana\rSteve Young\rCraig Morton\rKen O'Brien\rSteve Bartkowski \n"}, {"text": "Wow, Vince, that was a spectacular performance! Hello, all, I'm Joe Gilliam. You may remember me as the guy Terry Bradshaw replaced as quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers, in 1974. My career only lasted 20 games, but I had a winning record and I also did something that no other person on this list can claim. What was it?", "correct": "Became the first African-American quarterback to have started and won an Opening Day game in the NFL", "options": ["Became the first African-American quarterback to have thrown for back-to-back 80 yard touchdowns on consecutive series", "Became the first African-American quarterback to have started and won a post-season game", "Became the first African-American quarterback to have rushed for over 100 yards in a game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecame the first African-American quarterback to have started and won an Opening Day game in the NFL.\n\n\tNicknamed \"Jefferson Street Joe\", Gilliam was drafted out of Tennessee State, in 1972, by the Pittsburgh Steelers as a possible replacement for future Hall of Famer, Terry Bradshaw. He compiled a 4-2-1 record over his brief 20 game career and on September 15, 1974, he became the first African-American quarterback to have started and won an Opening Day game in the NFL when he beat the Baltimore Colts 30-0, going 17-31 for 257 yards, which included a 54 yard touchdown strike to future Hall of Famer, Lynn Swann.\rSadly, he passed away at age 49 on Christmas Day, 2000. \n"}, {"text": "You're right about that, Joe, you're the only one who can make that claim, but I did something which no one on this list can claim, too. Hi, all, I'm...well, I'll let you try and guess who I am. I came into the league in 1978 and took my team to a championship game the very next year, but it wasn't until 1987 that I won the ultimate prize with a victory in Super Bowl XXII. Who am I?", "correct": "Doug Williams", "options": ["Warren Moon", "John Gilliam", "Vince Evans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoug Williams.\n\n\tDoug Williams was the first African-American to win a Super Bowl title when he lead the Washington Redskins over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXII, 42-10. \r Selected in the first round of the 1978 NFL Draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers out of Grambling State University, Williams led the team to three playoff appearances in his five years there, taking them all the way to the NFC Championship game in his second season as a starter where they lost a defensive battle to the Los Angeles Rams, 9-0. He played nine NFL seasons and compiled 16,998 yards to go along with 100 touchdowns. \n"}, {"text": "You're right about your unmatched deed, Mr...., ooops, I almost spoke your name; sorry. Hello, all, I'm James Harris and while I can't claim a Super Bowl victory on my resume', I did do something very special, in 1974, which none of the men on this list can say brag about. What was it?", "correct": "Became the first African-American to start in a Conference Championship Game", "options": ["Became the first African-American to win a playoff game that went into overtime", "Became the first African-American to win back-to-back playoff games in a single season", "Became the first African-American to a playoff game on the road"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecame the first African-American to start in a Conference Championship Game.\n\n\tNicknamed 'Shack' long before the Los Angeles Lakers' center was born, James Harris was an Eighth Round selection out of Grambling State University, in 1969, for the Buffalo Bills. After three seasons there, he was released and signed with the Los Angeles Rams, where he was a back up to John Hadl until Hadl was sent to Green Bay six games into the 1974 season. Harris was then elevated to starting quarterback and went 7-2 the rest of the way leading the Rams to their second straight division title and a playoff win over the Washington Redskins, 19-10, their first postseason win since 1951. When he stepped under center the next week at Minnesota, he became the first African-American to start a Conference Championship Game.\rIn his 13 year career, Harris threw for 8,136 yards and 45 touchdowns. \n"}, {"text": "Yeah, that's a pretty cool thing to have on your resume, Mr. Harris. While I can't make the claim that I was the first to do anything, I do take pride in the fact that I was a pretty versatile player; in fact, I have often been referred to as 'The Ultimate Weapon'. Who am I?", "correct": "Randall Cunningham", "options": ["Rodney Peete", "Daunte Culpepper", "Kordell Stewart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRandall Cunningham.\n\n\tNicknamed \"The Ultimate Weapon\", Randall Cunningham was one of the most gifted and dynamic athletes ever to grace a football field. Taken in the Second Round of the 1985 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles out of the University of Nevada Las Vegas, Cunningham spent 16 seasons in the league playing with four different teams (Philadelphia, Minnesota, Dallas, and Baltimore). He also made the Pro Bowl four times (1988, 1989, 1990, and 1998). Just how versatile was he? Check out these plays: \r 1989--Lined up as the punter and kicked the ball 91 yards\r1990--Threw a 99 yard touchdown and ended up with the 10th best rushing total for that season after gaining 942 yards.\r For his career, Cunningham tossed 207 touchdowns for 29,979 yards, rushed for 4,928 more, as well as had a punting average of 44.7. Pretty impressive, huh? \n"}, {"text": "Now, that's impressive! And, I know what I'm talking about since I was a pretty versatile quarterback myself. Hello, all, I'm Donovan McNabb and I was named to the Pro Bowl ____ times between 1999 and 2010. Can you identify how many times?", "correct": "6", "options": ["4", "7", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n6.\n\n\tAs a Philadelphia Eagle from 1999-2009, Donovan McNabb was selected to the Pro Bowl six times (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2010). When he was drafted as the Number Two pick in the First Round out of Syracuse University in 1999, no one would have thought that he would ever come close to even getting to one Pro Bowl. Booed on Draft Day by a portion of the Eagles fans because the organization did not take Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams instead, McNabb wasted little time in proving those that doubted him wrong.\r After the 2000 season, McNabb finished second only to the incomparable Marshall Faulk in the Associated Press's MVP voting and went on to lead the Eagles to four consecutive Division titles (2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004), five NFC Conference appearances (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2009), one NFC Conference title, and Super Bowl XXXIX. \r All in all, not a bad resume to have for someone who wasn't wanted, initially. \n"}, {"text": "You da man, Donovan! That was a great run. Hello, all, I'm Michael Vick and while I may be one of the most controversial players off the field, I did do something on the field that no one else in NFL history had ever done. What was it?", "correct": "Gave the Green Bay Packers their first ever home playoff loss", "options": ["Gave the Dallas Cowboys their first ever home loss in Cowboys Stadium", "Gave the Atlanta Falcons their first ever road playoff win", "Took the Atlanta Falcons to their first ever Conference championship game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGave the Green Bay Packers their first ever home playoff loss.\n\n\tThe NFL's overall Number One draft pick of the Atlanta Falcons, in 2001, from the University of Virgina Tech, Michael Vick was very first quarterback to have handed the storied Green Bay Packers their first ever home playoff loss, 27-7, in January, 2003, which was only his second season in the league. During his first six years with the Falcons, he led the team to the playoffs at the end of both the 2002 and 2004 seasons, going 2-2.\r While in Atlanta, Vick was as dynamic a player as had ever been seen in the NFL and he seemingly had the city (if not the whole world) in his hands; he could do no wrong...until that fateful day in April, 2007 when a drug investigation into his Virginia home which a cousin of his was using at the time, uncovered an unlawful dogfighting operation. Vick was initially sentenced to 23 months in Federal prison, but only served 19 of them.\r Released in July, 2009, Vick was picked up by the Philadelphia Eagles where he played sparingly. He became the Eagles starting quarterback in September, 2010, after then-starting quarterback, Kevin Kolb, was injured. \n"}, {"text": "Well, I have to say that every one of you on this list have done some things to be proud of. Hello, everyone, my name is Marlin Briscoe and I accomplished something that I am very proud of, also. Can you pick out what is was from the answers below?", "correct": "Became the first African-American quarterback to have started a regular season game in the modern NFL era", "options": ["Became the first African-American to start in a Conference Championship Game", "Became the first African-American quarterback to have started and won an Opening Day game in the NFL", "Became the first African-American quarterback to have started and won an Opening Day game in the AFL"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecame the first African-American quarterback to have started a regular season game in the modern NFL era.\n\n\tThe pioneer of this list, Marlin Briscoe, who was chosen by the Denver Broncos in the 14th round of that year's NFL Draft out of the University of Nebraska-Omaha, became the first African-American quarterback to have started a game in the modern NFL era when he lined up behind Center Larry Kaminski against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 6, 1968. It was the fourth game of the season and the Denver Broncos had yet to win a game behind starting Quarterback Steve Tensi, who had become injured, but Briscoe helped lead the team their first win, 10-7. He would go on to start a total of five games that season, going 2-3, and throwing for 14 touchdowns.\r Although he played well, the Broncos traded him at the end of that season to the Buffalo Bills where he became a wide receiver. He never played quarterback in the NFL again. However, Briscoe could not be too upset about his new position because it was at wide receiver that he became an All Pro for the Bills and later the Miami Dolphins, where he was a member of both their 1972 undefeated squad which won Super Bowl VII, as well as their Super Bowl VIII-winning team.\r Briscoe would spend nine years in the NFL, retiring with the New England Patriots after the 1976 season. Thank you for paving the way, Marlin! \n"}, {"text": "Steve McNair was the second African-American quarterback to reach a Super Bowl when he took the Tennessee Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV at the end of the 1999 season.

In his best statical season, he had a 100.4 rating, throwing for 3,215 yards, 24 touchdowns, with only seven interceptions.

In his nine year tenure as the team's leader, he guided the Titans to five postseason appearances, including Super Bowl XXXIV (which they lost to the St. Louis Rams on the final play of the game, 23-16), as well as capturing three Pro Bowl selections. \r In 2003, McNair was awarded the Associated Press's NFL's Most Valuable Player honor, an award that he shared with the Indianapolis Colts' Peyton Manning.
