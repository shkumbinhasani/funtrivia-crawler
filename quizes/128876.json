{"id": "128876", "name": "How Well Do You Know \"Henry V\" ? Quiz | Literature | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Shakespeare", "Henry V"], "questions": [{"text": "In the opening scene with which other churchman does the Bishop of Ely discuss the character of the King?", "correct": "Archbishop of Canterbury", "options": ["Archbishop of York", "Bishop of Carlisle", "Bishop of London"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArchbishop of Canterbury.\n\n\tIn this opening scene we note that the Church was not above promoting a foreign war in order to gain the King's favour. We also note the changed character of Henry as described by the two men. Formerly wild and uncaring he has become wise and pious. \n"}, {"text": "What are the titles held by the King's two brothers in this play?", "correct": "Gloucester and Bedford", "options": ["Bedford and Westmoreland", "York and Gloucester", "Exeter and Scroop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGloucester and Bedford.\n\n\tThese two men are left with the problem of England after their brother dies and his son is just an infant unable to rule in his own right. The Lancastrian dynasty seems dominant at this point with so many possible male heirs to Henry IV's throne. In the reign of Henry VI this all changes. \n"}, {"text": "Which nation does Henry fear will take advantage if he leaves England to make war on the French?", "correct": "Scotland", "options": ["Spain", "Wales", "Ireland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScotland.\n\n\t\"If that you will France win,\r Then with Scotland first begin.\"\rThe Archbishop of Canterbury in the same speech compares England to an eagle and the Scots to a weasel that will crawl into the nest and destroy the eggs. \n"}, {"text": "The French send tennis balls to Henry to suggest he will be more suited to playing games than making war. Which French person ordered the tennis balls to be sent?", "correct": "The Dauphin of France", "options": ["The Constable of France", "The King of France", "The Duke of Orleans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dauphin of France.\n\n\tThe Dauphin is the title given to the eldest son of the French king. The English sometimes use the word \"dolphin\" instead. The tennis balls are meant as a calculated insult but Henry uses them as an excuse for a rousing speech to his noblemen. \n"}, {"text": "What are the names of the three traitors who conspire to kill Henry before he goes on board ship to France?", "correct": "Cambridge, Scroop and Grey", "options": ["Bedford, Erpingham and Exeter", "Cambridge, York  and Grey", "Scroop, Warwick and Cambridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCambridge, Scroop and Grey.\n\n\tThe three men have apparently taken money from the French in order to carry out this act. Shakespeare makes a pun on the words \"gilt\" (gold coins) and \"guilt\". Cambridge was the most important of this group because he was a direct descendant in the Yorkist line. His brother York remains loyal and dies at Agincourt. \n"}, {"text": "To whom is the hostess of the tavern in Eastcheap married?", "correct": "Pistol", "options": ["Falstaff", "Nym", "Bardolph"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPistol.\n\n\tWe are told that she had been \"troth-plight\" to Nym but in fact married Pistol. For a while this causes a good deal of friction between the two men as they set off for war. \n"}, {"text": "When the French King discusses the English with his son and his nobles he reminds them of which English hero from the past in order to stop them being over-confident?", "correct": "Edward, the Black Prince", "options": ["Edward III", "Robin Hood", "John of Gaunt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdward, the Black Prince.\n\n\tEdward, Prince of Wales, was the eldest son of Edward III and he took part in two memorable victories over the French at Crecy and at Poitiers. He was nicknamed the \"Black Prince\", probably because of his armour but this is a point that is still debated. He died before he could inherit the throne from his father. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of Henry's family is sent to the French King as the ambassador who will demand that the kingdom of France be given up to the English?", "correct": "Exeter", "options": ["Bedford", "Westmoreland", "York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExeter.\n\n\tHis uncle Exeter is ultra-loyal to Henry and carries out his mission with power and dignity. \n"}, {"text": "When he is rallying his men at the siege of Harfleur which animal does Henry ask them to imitate?", "correct": "tiger", "options": ["panther", "lion", "leopard"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntiger.\n\n\tAfter mentioning the tiger Henry suggests it is its fearsome appearance that is one of the things that he wants his men to adopt.\r\"Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage; \rThen lend the eye a terrible aspect.\" \n"}, {"text": "The name of which classical hero is used to inspire his men in the Harfleur rallying speech?", "correct": "Alexander", "options": ["Achilles", "Julius Caesar", "Hector"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlexander.\n\n\tIn fact Henry compares the fathers of his men to \"so many Alexanders\" in order to draw upon both the ancient story of Alexander the Great of Macedon and the more recent deeds done by the previous generations of Englishmen on the fields of France. \n"}, {"text": "Which person attempts to drive Nym, Pistol, Bardolph and the Boy forward into the breach at Harfleur?", "correct": "Captain Fluellen", "options": ["Henry", "Exeter", "Falstaff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Fluellen.\n\n\tShakespeare has presented the nobles as the officer class who are doing the leading and he also shows us some of the hangers-on like Nym and Bardolph who are only there to get what they can steal. Fluellen, Gower, MacMorris and Jamie are more like the lower officers in the army who can be trusted to lead small numbers of men. Note that each part of the British Isles is represented and that they quarrel with each other but fight the common enemy. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Princess Katherine's maid who discusses with her the names for various different parts of the body in English?", "correct": "Alice", "options": ["Marianne", "Isabelle", "Jeanne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlice.\n\n\tThe French princess appears to be but a pawn in the game that is being played out for the kingdom of France. A marriage to Henry would be based upon political necessity rather than any real knowledge of  or affection for her prospective partner. \n"}, {"text": "What does the Duke of Bourbon call the English in order to show his hatred and contempt for them?", "correct": "Norman bastards", "options": ["English rosbifs", "English girls", "Men from the foggy island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorman bastards.\n\n\tThe French would regard most of the English nobility as being descended from William the Conqueror, the bastard Duke of Normandy who invaded England in 1066. The Normans were descended from the \"Northmen\" or Vikings who had settled in France. The French nobility would regard their own ancestors as more purely French. \n"}, {"text": "What is the fate of Bardolph in this play?", "correct": "He is hanged for stealing from a church.", "options": ["He is caught stealing but pardoned by Henry.", "He dies in a fight with Pistol.", "He survives the campaign and goes safely home."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is hanged for stealing from a church.\n\n\tEven though Bardolph had been a companion of his rather wild youth Henry maintains order and discipline in his army by confirming what Exeter and Fluellen had decided should be the correct punishment for stealing as previously set out by the King. Bardolph is thus hanged for his crimes. \n"}, {"text": "From which man does Henry borrow a cloak on the night before the battle of Agincourt?", "correct": "Sir Thomas Erpingham", "options": ["Exeter", "Williams", "Fluellen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSir Thomas Erpingham.\n\n\tHenry visits the different parts of the English camp using the cloak to help disguise his appearance. In the Chorus this is described as \"A little touch of Harry in the night\". \n"}, {"text": "What are names of the three ordinary soldiers that Henry talks with on the night before the battle?", "correct": "Bates, Court, and Williams", "options": ["Miles, Jennings and Kent", "Wilson, Fletcher and Hood", "Smith, Jones and Cartwright"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBates, Court, and Williams.\n\n\tShakespeare now presents his audience with the ordinary men of the English army. Previously the only men of working class that had been shown were villains like Bardolph and Nym. The soldiers are shown to have all the worries and concerns of any man before a battle. \n"}, {"text": "How many extra men does Westmoreland wish that they had available from England?", "correct": "ten thousand", "options": ["twenty thousand", "five thousand", "twelve thousand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nten thousand.\n\n\t\"O but we had here,\r But one ten thousand of those men in England\r That do no work today.\"\r  He thinks of men on holiday in England who could be gainfully employed in fighting for their nation in France. \n"}, {"text": "What day does the Battle of Agincourt take place on?", "correct": "St. Crispin's Day", "options": ["St. David's Day", "St. George's Day", "Midsummer's Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Crispin's Day\n\n\tHenry makes use of the idea of a special day that will be remembered to the end of their lives by the soldiers that took part in it. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following names is not one that King Henry mentions in his speech as likely to be remembered and \"Familiar in his mouth as household words\" by the future veterans of the battle?", "correct": "York", "options": ["Bedford", "Warwick", "Talbot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYork.\n\n\tHe lists, \"Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,\r           Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester\".\r   Other supporters are present but Henry has mentioned his brothers and his uncle as well as other famous leaders. \n"}, {"text": "Which nobleman asks to lead the \"vaward\" or the front rank of the attack at the Battle of Agincourt?", "correct": "York", "options": ["Westmoreland", "Salisbury", "Exeter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYork.\n\n\tThe Duke of York was one of the men who rebelled against Henry IV, the present king's father. Having been forgiven he serves loyally the House of Lancaster from that point onwards. In \"Richard II\" he was known by the title Aumerle. \n"}, {"text": "Which incident during the battle finally makes Henry lose his temper?", "correct": "The news that the French had killed the boys at the baggage train.", "options": ["The news that Pistol had deserted.", "The news that Exeter had disobeyed orders.", "The news that his brother was dead."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe news that the French had killed the boys at the baggage train.\n\n\tHenry is angry that the unarmed boys who are normally left alone in the fight between two armies are attacked and killed by the French. The boys are left with the baggage and it was possibly the idea of plunder which caused the French to attack in this way. As Fluellen puts it \"'tis expressly against the law of arms.\" \n"}, {"text": "Apart from four men of rank, how many other English soldiers were killed at the Battle of Agincourt?", "correct": "twenty-five", "options": ["five", "five hundred", "one hundred and fifty"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwenty-five.\n\n\tWhen you consider that the French losses are counted as over ten thousand you can see why Henry might believe that God had a large hand in his success.  Only twenty-five English soldiers are said to have lost their lives. \n"}, {"text": "Edward Duke of York, Sir Richard Ketley and Davy Gam esquire are three of the English men of rank killed at Agincourt. Who is the fourth?", "correct": "The Earl of Suffolk", "options": ["The Earl of Warwick", "The Earl of Salisbury", "The Earl of Westmoreland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Earl of Suffolk.\n\n\tIn fact the Earl of Suffolk is not part of the cast list of the play. Apart from York it would seem that none of the men who surround Henry are affected adversely by the battle. It would seem to an audience that nearly everybody came through successfully. \n"}, {"text": "In which French town do the English and French Kings finally meet?", "correct": "Troyes", "options": ["Orleans", "Calais", "Paris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTroyes.\n\n\tThe town of Troyes is in the region of Champagne. The surviving members of the French court have little choice but to acceed to the demands of the occupying army. \n"}, {"text": "Which powerful foreign nobleman tries to encourage the English and French to make peace for the sake of the country of France?", "correct": "The Duke of Burgundy", "options": ["The Emperor of Austria", "The King of Spain", "The Emperor of Germany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy.\n\n\tBurgundy's speech about the damage done to both the land and people of France is one of the most poweful anti-war statements in all of Shakespeare. It quite clearly shows the consequences of taking up arms no matter what the cause. \n"}]}
