{"id": "387107", "name": "Path of the Mammals Quiz / Test | Mixed Animals for Kids | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "Mixed Animals for Kids", "Mammals for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "You might see some of these mammals collecting acorns for the winter or building a dam on their favourite river. What are they?", "correct": "Rodents", "options": ["Frogs", "Cats", "Ducks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRodents.\n\n\tRodents are the by far largest order of mammals in the world, with around two out of every five mammals being a rodent. They include some animals that are fun to keep as pets, such as mice, rats, hamsters and gerbils; and some you definitely wouldn't want, like beavers and the giant South American capybara. All rodents have two large front teeth that keep growing for their whole lives, no wonder they're always gnawing on something! \n"}, {"text": "Which order of mammals have nifty thumbs that let them pick things up and brains that they like to claim are bigger than most other animals?", "correct": "Primates", "options": ["Elephants", "Bats", "Insects"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrimates.\n\n\tPrimates are the order of mammals that includes humans, as well as our close relatives the monkeys and the apes. They are distinguished by their 'opposable' thumbs, meaning that they can place their thumb opposite their other fingers in order to pick things up. This makes them really good at using simple tools like sticks and swinging from tree to tree in the jungle. \n"}, {"text": "Who needs thumbs when you've got a proboscis the size of these mammals! The heaviest land animals on Earth, what are these creatures?", "correct": "Elephants", "options": ["Antelopes", "Rhinoceroses", "Giraffes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElephants.\n\n\tThe order of mammals known as the Proboscidea are named after their extremely long noses, also known as trunks. They can use them to feed themselves, wash themselves and cool themselves down. Hands are overrated! African and Indian elephants are the only surviving members of the order today but in the past it included woolly mammoths and the enormous palaeoloxodon namadicus, the largest land mammal ever. \n"}, {"text": "Not all mammals give birth to live young: an order known as the monotremes give birth to their babies in eggs. Which funny-looking creature belongs to the monotreme order?", "correct": "Platypus", "options": ["Armadillo", "Donkey", "Squirrel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlatypus.\n\n\tThe playtpus is one of only five species of monotreme on the entire planet. The other four are all varieties of a spiny creature known as an echidna. All monotremes live in the southern hemisphere, with the platypus being restricted to Eastern Australia and the several species of echidna being found both on the Australian mainland and the neighbouring island of New Guinea. \n"}, {"text": "Originally named after the Greek word for sea monster, scientists like to call these mammals 'Cetacea'. Which of the following might you find in this group?", "correct": "Dolphins", "options": ["Sharks", "Clownfish", "Tuna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDolphins.\n\n\tFish definitely aren't mammals, but not all of the animals in the sea are fish. While they might look similar to sharks, dolphins are actually mammals and have to breathe the air like we do. That's why they're always jumping out of the ocean! Some other cetacean mammals that live in the sea are whales and porpoises. \n"}, {"text": "Many farm animals, including pigs, sheep and cows fit into the same order. They are all grouped together because they have an even number of what feature?", "correct": "Toes on their hooves", "options": ["Eyelashes on their brows", "Bones in their knees", "Spots on their faces"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToes on their hooves.\n\n\tAll of these animals are collected together in an order known as 'Artiodactyla', meaning 'even-toed'. However, the Simpsons family wouldn't be allowed in because they have human-like feet and not hooves; its all very exclusive. Other animals with an even number of toes on their hooves include hippos, camels and giraffes. \n"}, {"text": "Don't be afraid of the fancy name 'Lagomorpha', its just a Greek word meaning 'shaped like a hare'. Which other animals join the hares in this order?", "correct": "Rabbits", "options": ["Rats", "Groundhogs", "Shrews"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRabbits.\n\n\tDespite being named exclusively for hares, the lagomorphs contain a range of animals including rabbits, hares and pikas. Pikas are small mammals that live in North America and Central Asia. They like to make their homes between rocks so if you want to spot one you'll need to keep your eyes open! \n"}, {"text": "Mostly found in Australia, these mammals have to keep their babies in a pouch until they grow up and some like to hop around. What are they?", "correct": "Marsupials", "options": ["Carnivores", "Primates", "Pandas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarsupials.\n\n\tAll of the marsupials living in the world make their home in either Australasia (the continent containing Australia) or somewhere in the Americas. Cuddly koalas and bouncy kangaroos are perhaps the most famous marsupials, but over 300 species exist in total. The only marsupial found in North America is the opossum. \n"}, {"text": "Often found hanging around in coastal regions, these mammals live in the sea but don't have blowholes on their heads. What is the common name for this order which includes the friendly manatee?", "correct": "Sea cows", "options": ["Sea dogs", "Sea horses", "Sea pigs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSea cows.\n\n\tThe official name for the sea cows is 'Sirenia' because fisherman thought they were the sirens that appear in Greek mythology. Sea cows are some of the most laid back creatures in the world, gracefully swimming with their large front flippers and spending most of their day eating. What a life! They can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes but usually like to come up for air every 3-4 minutes. \n"}, {"text": "This order contains one of the tiniest mammals out there and its name comes from the Greek for 'hand' and 'wing'. Which mammals, often incorrectly thought to be blind, are from the order Chiroptera? ", "correct": "Bats", "options": ["Foxes", "Sloths", "Tapirs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBats.\n\n\tMany people use the phrase 'blind as a bat' to describe a human that can't see very well, but in reality most bats can see almost as well as humans. However, bats also have a special system called echolocation in which they use sound waves to create an image of objects around them to make sure they don't crash when in flight. Very useful in the dark! \n"}]}
