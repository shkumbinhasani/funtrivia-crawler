{"id": "181978", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'Out of Sight, Out of Mind' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "As the credits complete, Frank Burns is pictured in the dark listening to a baseball game.  His devious facial expression suggests that he is up to no good!  It turns out that Frank is planning to swindle some fellows by betting on a game in which he already knows the outcome.  Who hits the game-winning home run in the ninth inning of this game?", "correct": "Gil Hodges", "options": ["Willie Mays", "Mickey Mantle", "Ted Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGil Hodges.\n\n\tThe Dodgers win the game in dramatic fashion thanks to a three-run home run in the ninth inning by Gil Hodges.  The final score is 4-3.  Of course, only Frank Burns knows this the next day when he bets three suckers who are listening to the second broadcast of the game.  Frank comes out the richer...but for how long? \n"}, {"text": "Shortly after the baseball game ends, two nurses barge into the Swamp asking for Hawkeye's assistance.  What is it that they need from our favorite chief surgeon?", "correct": "To fix the stove in their tent", "options": ["To help a wounded patient", "To catch a mouse that has entered their tent", "To carry an extra cot into their tent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo fix the stove in their tent.\n\n\tAccording to the nurses, Hawkeye is the 'only one' who can fix the stove in their tent.  I find this hard to believe since they merely need to re-light the pilot light.  Couldn't one of them do it, or perhaps BJ?  Oh wait, then the plot for the episode would have no basis...never mind. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye injures his eyes while assisting the nurses, and the entire camp comes alive with his screams of pain.  Colonel Potter immediately commands Radar to call an ophthalmologist, which the young Corporal does with alacrity.  During the call, Radar assumes what high rank in order to speed up his contact with the eye doctor?", "correct": "General", "options": ["Major", "Colonel", "Captain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneral.\n\n\tRadar goes right to the top, transforming himself into General Walter O'Reilly, 'three stars and real mad'.  According to Radar, 'If Major Overman isn't over here by the time they crack my powdered eggs for breakfast I'll have you digging a latrine for every G.I. in Korea!'  Hmm...'cracking' powdered eggs is a new one for me. \n"}, {"text": "After being treated by the ophthalmologist Hawkeye finds himself temporarily blind, but not helpless, in the post-op ward.  Insisting on making himself useful, he makes the rounds with the other patients.  Encountering an empty bed, who does Hawkeye suggest is lying there?", "correct": "Claude Rains", "options": ["The Thin Man", "Tom Thumb", "Tiny Tim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClaude Rains.\n\n\tAs many of you are probably aware, Claude Rains played the lead role of Jack Griffin in the classic 1933 horror/sci-fi film 'The Invisible Man'.  Hawkeye is simply making an allusion to this film based on the book by H.G. Wells. \n"}, {"text": "Continuing to make the rounds, Hawkeye encounters another patient named Straw who has received a wound to his eyes.  This young soldier claims to be from which American city?", "correct": "San Francisco", "options": ["Boston", "Miami", "St. Louis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Francisco.\n\n\tHawkeye meets Straw, a young lad who was injured in the face when a grenade exploded ten feet in front of him.  Initially, Hawkeye asks Straw to read his clipboard, which offends the young man.  They then mutually discover that each has suffered eye wounds.  Straw tells Hawkeye that he is from San Francisco and that he 'looks forward to not seeing the Golden Gate Bridge again'.  Hawkeye leaves even more depressed than before. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter decides to move Hawkeye into the Swamp after numerous complaints from Frank that Hawkeye is interfering with business in the post-op.  In the Swamp, Radar reads Hawkeye letters from home in order to help the surgeon while away the time.  In typical Frank Burns fashion, Ferret Face enters the Swamp whistling what child's tune?", "correct": "Three Blind Mice", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree Blind Mice.\n\n\tRadar reads (not very well, I might add) a letter from home while Hawkeye attempts unsuccessfully to juggle.  Frank enters the scene, cruelly whistling the song 'Three Blind Mice', only to encounter Hawkeye pretending to read his letters with glasses on the outside of his bandages. \n"}, {"text": "Next to visit Hawkeye is Klinger, who provides the doctor with a duck call and an escort to the latrine.  While Hawkeye uses the latrine, Margaret assumes the role of escort after dispatching Klinger to Colonel Potter's office.  Hawkeye emerges and immediately recognizes Margaret by her perfume.  What scent does Margaret claim she is wearing?", "correct": "Forbidden Furlough", "options": ["A Scent Without Leave", "Eau de Fort Lafayette", "Officer's Scent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForbidden Furlough.\n\n\tHawkeye suggests that Margaret's perfume is called 'Moon over Fort Dix', but Margaret corrects him.  Margaret escorts Hawkeye to the mess tent, after which he suggests they escape to her tent for a game of blind man's bluff. \n"}, {"text": "In the post-op, Hawkeye bids farewell to Straw, who his being shipped to the 121st Evac.  Straw has had his bandages removed and his eyesight has been restored.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tUnfortunately, Straw leaves without knowing whether or not he will have his eyesight back.  He fears how his wife will react if he turns out to be blind, to which Hawkeye responds, 'Don't sell her short'. \n"}, {"text": "Still in the post-op, Hawkeye is confronted by BJ, who is worried about the former's behavior.  Hawkeye insists that, though he is scared and wants his eyesight back, he has learned a great deal from this experience.  As an example, Hawkeye describes the non-visual sensations he experienced that morning related to what event?", "correct": "A rainstorm", "options": ["Breakfast", "A drive through the hills", "A walk around camp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA rainstorm.\n\n\tHawkeye spent two hours that morning listening to a rainstorm.  During that time, he discovered that rain hitting the ground sounds like steaks barbecuing, that thunder seems to echo forever and that the sound of a person slipping in the mud is funny (especially when one imagines it to be Frank Burns).  Hawkeye suggests that there might be some sort of advantage in being blind, and that he has 'never spent a more conscious day in [his] life'.  Interesting. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye has caught on to Frank Burns little baseball radio scam and engineers a phony baseball radio broadcast in order to get back at Ferret Face.  Which two teams play in the game manufactured by Hawkeye and friends?", "correct": "Yankees and Indians", "options": ["Giants and Phillies", "Red Sox and Tigers", "Cardinals and Cubs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYankees and Indians.\n\n\tWhile Hawkeye plays the announcer, BJ mans the bat noise (using Hawkeye's cane and another stick), Klinger does the ball and mitt sound and Radar does a wonderful rendition of a cheering crowd.  In the version doctored by Hawkeye and friends, Cleveland defeats the Yankees 5-4.  In the actual game, the Yankees win 8-1.  Frank has bet the farm and lost!
