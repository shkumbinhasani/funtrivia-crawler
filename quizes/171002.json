{"id": "171002", "name": "Hard 'M*A*S*H' - 'Lt. Radar O'Reilly Quiz / Test | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "The episode entitled 'Lt. Radar O'Reilly' opens with, brace yourselves, a poker game!  As per usual, Radar manages to take a fair bundle of money off of his mates at the 4077th by pulling off a full house.  After winning the only hand shown, what does Radar announce he will buy for his mother?", "correct": "Electrolysis", "options": ["Ping pong table", "Dentures", "A milk cow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElectrolysis.\n\n\tRadar always seems lucky with cards.  In virtually every 'M*A*S*H' episode in which we see him play he wins a large pot.  In this case, he is especially happy because his mother seems to be desperately hairy and counts on her son to provide money for her electrolysis treatments.  Later in the episode, when he requests that he be 'busted' back down from Lieutenant, he requests that he be lowered no further than corporal...again, so he can afford to pay for his mother's electrolysis! \n"}, {"text": "Following the break up of the card game which character is quoted as saying, 'Unlucky at cards, unlucky at love.'?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Margaret", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy has lost $16 during the card game and laments this fact after the game.  Naturally, he can announce that he is 'unlucky at cards', but how does he know he is 'unlucky at love'?  It seems to me that he hasn't given the latter a fair shot. \n"}, {"text": "After most of the players have left the Swamp, Hawkeye and BJ are left chatting with the one remaining straggler, a certain sergeant who owes Hawkeye and BJ a lot of money.  What is this sergeant's surname?", "correct": "Woodruff", "options": ["Frascati", "Bonner", "Mahoney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWoodruff.\n\n\tWoodruff owes both Hawkeye and BJ money, as he has drawn I.O.U.s for two card games in a row.  Unable to pay them back their money, he offers to promote them.  You see, Sgt. Woodruff is in charge of the mimeograph machine at I-CORPS.  In their usual unselfish manner, BJ and Hawkeye forego their own promotion in favor of one for Radar.  Let the fun begin! \n"}, {"text": "The scene shifts to the morning of some unspecified day following the poker game.  Radar is delivering the camp mail and is encountered on his rounds by Frank Burns.  Frank demands a salute from Radar, prompting the young lad to drop a package meant for Major Burns.  What item is damaged in Frank's package?", "correct": "Aftershave bottle", "options": ["Picture frame", "Antique vase", "Wine bottle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAftershave bottle.\n\n\tFrank has such bad karma, doesn't he?  After Radar retrieves the broken aftershave bottle, with liquid literally pouring from all directions, Frank responds, 'You little poop.  You planned that whole salute!' \n"}, {"text": "In a very memorable scene, Radar enters Margaret's tent with a large package from Lt. Col. Donald Penobscott.  What has Margaret's beloved fianc\u00e9 generously sent her as a gift?", "correct": "Leather whip", "options": ["Matching garters and bra", "Fishnet stockings", "Transparent nightgown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeather whip.\n\n\t'Oh!  Oh, that thoughtful darling!' cries Margaret, who continues 'He knows I love fine leathers!'  Much to Radar's chagrin, she then proceeds to show her handicraft with the whip, flailing it about her tent with much alacrity.  Margaret proves very skillful with her new gift! \n"}, {"text": "Radar's next stop along his regular mail route is to Father Mulcahy's tent.  Radar provides the Father with a small box that is supposed to be stocked with communion wafers.  Instead, Mulcahy has received what items?", "correct": "Ritz crackers", "options": ["Oreo cookies", "Vanilla wafers", "Cheese nips"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRitz crackers.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy is rather disappointed to receive the Ritz crackers, they will not be of much good during the eucharist ceremony (but he does find them quite edible, nonetheless.)  The good Father asks if his biblical bookmarks have come, prompting Radar to go into his mailbag.  Radar pulls out a bra that he has accidently pilfered from Margaret's tent, much to the shock of Father Mulcahy.  Radar claims that the bra is 'athletic equipment'...a 'slingshot', no less!  Father Mulcahy responds with a smile and the following, 'With a slingshot like that I think David could have slain two Goliaths.' \n"}, {"text": "Radar makes a special delivery to the nurses tent, only to find himself accosted by a certain nurse who seems rather enthralled by his hulking manliness.  Which 4077th nurse has a crush on our poor Radar?", "correct": "Nurse Baker", "options": ["Nurse Kelly", "Nurse Abel", "Nurse Havilland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNurse Baker.\n\n\tAfter Radar enters the nurses' tent, Baker captures him with her towel, drawing him near.  She asks, 'Radar, what about us?' Radar responds, 'You mean you and me and you?'  Nurse Baker is especially drawn to Radar because he is enlisted and she is a Lieutenant.  According to Nurse Baker, Radar is 'forbidden fruit'. \n"}, {"text": "In a letter adressed to Colonel Potter, it is discovered that Radar has been promoted to 2nd Lieutenant.  Colonel Potter is rather skeptical about this and calls I-CORPS for confirmation.  He is told, among other things, that Radar has received his promotion for which of the following activities?", "correct": "Bugling", "options": ["Spelling", "Typing", "Penmanship"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBugling.\n\n\tPotter, being the skeptic that he is, calls I-CORPS.  Fortunately, he is directed to Sgt. Woodruff by Hawkeye and BJ.  After discovering that it's Colonel Potter on the phone inquiring about Radar, Woodruff shuffles a few pieces of paper on his desk, pretending to pull of Radar's file.  He then announces that Radar's promotion was for 'efficiency, punctuality and bugling over and above the call of duty.'  According to the still unconvinced Potter, 'My horse could bugle better than him!' \n"}, {"text": "Radar soon finds himself regretting his newfound promotion.  Though his regular duties are now delegated to those under his command, this causes a rift between him and the other enlisted men.  Radar has confrontations with all but which of the following enlisted men from the camp?", "correct": "Goldman", "options": ["Klinger", "Igor", "Zale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoldman.\n\n\tRadar is told to request supplies from the supply tent, which at current is being 'manned' by Zale and Igor.  Radar finds them both snoozing and uncooperative.  When they refuse to respond to his request, Radar commands them to follow his orders.  Later, Radar attempts to train Klinger in the art of making camp announcements.  Klinger proves extraordinarily recalcitrant, refusing to take his duties, or Radar, seriously.  Radar later laments to BJ and Hawkeye his predicament, and requests to be decomissioned. \n"}, {"text": "By the end of the episode, Radar has been returned to corporal status.  As a lieutenant, he was unable to attract the nurse who earlier had shown extreme interest in him.  Once again a corporal, is he able to get the girl?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIn the penultimate scene of the show we see Radar locking lips with Nurse Baker...his forbidden fruit once again becomes irresistable.  Leaving her tent, Radar is accosted by the other enlisted men who no accept the little fellow back in their lowly community.  Being a corporal has its perks!  Thanks for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
