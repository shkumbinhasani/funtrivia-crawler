Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "Nothing is more amusing than watching three urban dwelling Australian drag queens travelling thousands of miles across a vast desert in a broken down bus, is there?  Which of these actors was NOT a member of the three man drag team in the film 'The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'?", "correct": "Sean Bean", "options": ["Hugo Weaving", "Terence Stamp", "Guy Pearce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Bean.\n\n\tHugo Weaving you may also know as Smith from 'The Matrix' and Elrond from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.  Guy Pearce has also appeared in such films as 'L.A. Confidential' and 'Memento'.  Terence Stamp is an old hand in films, showing up in everything from the 1962 movie 'Billy Budd' to the 1980 film 'Superman II', as General Zod.  \r Good lord, could you imagine Sean Bean in drag?  One never knows, it could happen! \n"}, {"text": "What was the screen name of the transvestite actor Harris Glen Milstead, who appeared in a number of John Waters' more famous movies, including 'Hairspray' and 'Pink Flamingos'?", "correct": "Divine", "options": ["Vanity", "Chastity", "Faithful"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDivine.\n\n\tFor something truly unusual and different, check out a few of John Waters' films.  They often feature a rather large cross-dresser with the screen name Divine.  In Waters' 1972 film 'Pink Flamingos', Divine portrays Babs Johnson, while in the 1988 film 'Hairspray', Divine plays the role of Edna Turnblad, proud mother of Tracy Turnblad (played by Ricki Lake).  Divine's twelve-film career was sadly cut short when the actor suffered a heart attack in 1988; he was only 42. \n"}, {"text": "One of the all-time greatest cross-dressing performances was put on by Dustin Hoffman in 1982's 'Tootsie'.  In that film, not only does Hoffman star as struggling actor Michael Dorsey, but also portrays the role of what female soap opera actress?", "correct": "Dorothy Michaels", "options": ["Julie Nichols", "Rita Marshall", "April Page"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDorothy Michaels.\n\n\tNaturally, Dorothy Michaels is simply a play on the name Michael Dorsey.  The other three names mentioned were all characters from the film played by Jessica Lange (Julie Nichols), Geena Davis (April Page) and Doris Belack (Rita Marshall).  None of them wore drag for the film. \n"}, {"text": "Besides the outrageously wonderful performance put on by the occasionally cross-dressing Nathan Lane in the film 'The Birdcage', which other actor appears in full drag in that 1996 film?", "correct": "Gene Hackman", "options": ["Hank Azaria", "Dan Futterman", "Robin Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGene Hackman.\n\n\tThough Azaria, Williams and Futterman do also appear in the film, none of them are forced to don women's attire as Hackman is towards the end of the film.  Nathan Lane's eccentric performance as Albert/Starina Goldman is one for the ages, and makes the film worth watching.  Gene Hackman plays a U.S. senator who is forced to dress as a woman to escape the relentless paparazzi.  For further explanation, please see the film! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the 1992 film directed by Neil Jordan and starring, among others, Jaye Davidson in a truly stunning performance as a transvestite?", "correct": "The Crying Game", "options": ["Just Like a Woman", "After Hours", "High Heels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Crying Game.\n\n\t'The Crying Game' caused a big stir in the movie world in 1992, especially the surprise climactic scene when Dil (Jaye Davidson) reveals her (?) little secret to her boyfriend Fergus (Stephen Rea).  Davidson's performance was so convincing that he was nominated for a Best Actor in a Supporting Role Oscar, but did not win.  Davidson's only other feature film role was in the 1994 film 'Stargate'.\r The film is about an IRA soldier (Fergus) who goes on the lam in London, where he meets the ex-lover of a British soldier he had helped kidnap earlier in the film.  Sound complex?  You bet it is. \n"}, {"text": "Robin Williams takes his turn as a cross-dresser in the 1993 film 'Mrs. Doubtfire', wherein he plays an estranged father desperately trying to find access to his children.  What is the name of the male role Williams plays in the film?", "correct": "Daniel Hillard", "options": ["Stuart Dunmeyer", "Jonathan Lundy", "Justin Gregory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaniel Hillard.\n\n\tJonathan Lundy (Robert Prosky), Justin Gregory (Martin Mull) and Stuart Dunmeyer (Pierce Brosnan) are also male characters featured in the film.\r Robin Williams portrays Daniel Hillard, a man who has lost custody of his children during a messy divorce.  To see his three children more, Hillard dresses as an old, Scottish woman named Euphegenia Doubtfire and manages successfully to become the housekeeper for his estranged wife.  Naturally, wackiness ensues. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Terry Gilliam films features a lovely number performed by Michael Jeter, fully decked out in drag, for a 'mousy girl named Lydia'?", "correct": "The Fisher King", "options": ["Time Bandits", "Brazil", "Twelve Monkeys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fisher King.\n\n\tIn the marvelous 1991 film 'The Fisher King', character actor Michael Jeter dresses as a woman and puts on an emphatic performance for an office worker named Lydia (played by Amanda Plummer).

Mercedes Ruehl plays Jack's girlfriend Anne, an eternal optimist who just wants a happy relationship.  Robin Williams is featured as Parry, the husband of a woman killed by Jack's radio listener.

This rib-tickling comedy is bolstered by the convincing performances pulled off by Curtis and Lemmon, and having Marilyn Monroe along doesn't hurt any. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite comedies with a transvestite theme is the 2001 film 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch'.  Featuring an excellent soundtrack and an amusing, off-the-wall plot, the movie was the brainchild of which of the following individuals?", "correct": "John Cameron Mitchell", "options": ["Alex Proyas", "Tim Hunter", "Paul Weitz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell.\n\n\tIf you haven't seen 'Hedwig', and you can tolerate outrageous cross-dressing comedy, I must recommend this film.  Not only does it feature an excellent soundtrack, with original songs written by Mitchell and Stephen Trask, it also provides an interesting and clever storyline, which features Hedwig (played by Mitchell) as the lead singer of a band that also includes another cross-dresser named Yitzhak (this time, female to male).  Hedwig attempts to gain revenge on his turncoat former lover Tommy Gnosis, who has stolen his songs and his dignity. \n"}, {"text": "In one of the all-time most famous movie cross-dressing moments, Anthony Perkins appears as both Norman Bates and as his mother in which classic 1960 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock?", "correct": "Psycho", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPsycho.\n\n\tIn this brilliantly directed horror classic, shocking things occur at a small motel in rural Arizona that is run by a young man named Norman Bates and, supposedly, his mother.
