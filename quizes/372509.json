They eventually find the girl responsible, Paninya, and trap her with alchemy only to discover she has two Auto-mail legs. Winry is, of course, thrilled with the craftsmanship and seeks out the creator so that she can become his apprentice.  Unfortunately, he refuses her offer.  During their stay in Rush Valley, the engineer's daughter ends up having a baby, forcing Winry to assist with the childbirth. This, luckily, softens the man enough to assist her in a small way, even though he won't apprentice her directly.  The Elric Brothers catch the train out of Rush Valley bound for Dublith while Winry stays behind, vowing to learn enough to help Edward be the best he can be. \n"}, {"text": "\"One Is All, All Is One\" - Reaching Dublith, Edward and Alphonse reunite with their teacher, Izumi.  In their pre-training as children, what did she do to them?", "correct": "Maroon them on an island", "options": ["Trap them in a cage", "Whip them", "Bury them underground"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaroon them on an island.\n\n\tReaching Dublith, Ed and Al reunite with their teacher, Izumi, who still resides there with her husband, Sig.  It was many years ago that she took them under her wing, originally marooning them for thirty days to learn the value of the Laws of Equivalent Exchange before taking them in.  She welcomes them but notices something is amiss. It isn't until they fight that she instantly realizes Al is a suit of armour and Ed has two Auto-Mail limbs; he's also managed to perform alchemy using his own body as the transmutation circle, implying that they've both gone beyond and seen the same things on the other side. She reveals to them that in an effort to have a child, she also broke the taboo and tried to perform human transmutation, barely surviving in the end.  She also reveals that she knows nothing of the Philosopher's Stone, but she once had an encounter with someone who did-- Van Hohenheim-- their estranged father.  Ed refuses to search for him. \n"}, {"text": "\"Beasts of Dublith\" - Which Homunculus kidnaps Alphonse?", "correct": "Greed", "options": ["Pride", "Lust", "Envy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreed.\n\n\tAfter the boys tell their teacher of their story, she expels them outright, sending them to the train station immediately.  Realizing that they're equals, they state that they're staying because they need her help  Izumi hypothesizes that because Al lost his whole body, he likely saw more on the other side than they ever did; he must have not remembered out of shock.  Someone, as they don't know, is listening to their conversation.\rAl is led to an alleyway by a group of people claiming to have answers and, to his surprise, they're able to hijack his body and kidnap him.  As it turns out, they're all chimeras, albeit more advanced forms allegedly created by the government, and they're all in the care of Greed, who informs him that he's actually a Homunculus, a human created through alchemy.  Greed demands to know the secret behind Al's immortality but, fortunately, Edward arrives that moment and begins to fight (while Al is taken away).  Greed, using a personal shield and regeneration ability, seems cocky but Ed works out the alchemy behind it; both are created and maintained by carbon, and manipulating that, he can defeat Greed in battle.  Although it seems like things are about to take a turn for the worse, Izumi arrives to join her former pupil.\rIn East City, Colonel Mustang is promoted and sent to Central with his team.\rElsewhere, the scarred assassin is visited and reprimanded by his master.  He departs nonetheless. \n"}, {"text": "\"Those Who Lurk Underground\" - Grand F\u00fchrer hides the fact that he is a Homunculus.  He embodies which of the deadly sins?", "correct": "Wrath", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWrath.\n\n\tColonel Mustang arrives in Central to the glares of his new colleagues but discovers that Grand F\u00fchrer Bradley is on a mission to the South.  Coincidentally, it happens to be to Dublith; he and Major Armstrong are on their way to investigate and exterminate the chimeras that already have the Elric Brothers in their grasp.  Greed makes his escape into the sewers with some of his most trusted minions and Al, but the F\u00fchrer takes chase, catching up and destroying them all, bringing down Greed with his speed and dexterity.  It's then that he reveals that he's also a Homunculus, albeit a younger one.\rAl, who sees none of this, regains his memories of his time on the other side when new blood hits the mark inside his armour.  Unfortunately, he still can't recall any clues to getting his and Ed's bodies back.  When he comes to, he and Ed are asked if they revealed anything about the military to Greed and are let off the hook when it becomes apparent they didn't.  They do, however, remain suspicious of all that's going on.\rElsewhere, Greed, tied up and unable to escape, is brought before his Homunculus siblings.  Lust reveals that the Grand F\u00fchrer is actually Wrath before their father asks if Greed will once again be loyal.  Greed refuses to side with his father and is, subsequently, melted down. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Envoy From the East\" - Ling Yao makes himself known to the Elric Brothers, having traveled from what foreign land?", "correct": "Xing", "options": ["Drachma", "Aerugo", "Creta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nXing.\n\n\tThe scarred Ishvalan assassin returns to his hideout to find a girl from Xing.

He decides to bring her along.\rIn Central, Lieutenant Hawkeye is attacked by Barry the Chopper, but staying calm and collected, she Colonel Mustang, and his team end up capturing him and holding him hostage in a warehouse.  Barry's story seems to make it clear that something serious is amiss in the city.\rIn Rush Valley, the Elrics return to Winry for further repairs and end up meeting a man named Ling Yao, a prince from the land to the east, Xing, who seeks information about the Philosopher's Stone.  His servants battle the boys, but all of them end up heading to Central together, with Winry in tow, to get answers. \n"}, {"text": "\"Footsteps of a Comrade-in-Arms\" - Who is framed for the murder of Colonel Hughes?", "correct": "Second Lieutenant Ross", "options": ["Colonel Mustang", "Second Lieutenant Havoc", "Lieutenant Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSecond Lieutenant Ross.\n\n\tThe Elrics end up arriving in Central whereupon they're lied to by Colonel Mustang; it's not long before they discover that Hughes was killed, likely because he aided the boys.  When they reach Hughes' apartment they give their condolences to his wife and realize that they need to keep going with their investigation to avoid his death from being in vain.\rLust and Envy both work together to throw  Colonel Mustang off the trail.  While Envy appears as other officials in Central for intel, Lust poses as a woman named Solaris to date Mustang's Second Lieutenant, Havoc.\rMeanwhile, Second Lieutenant Ross is brought in for questioning regarding the murder of Colonel Hughes. \n"}, {"text": "\"Cold Flame\" - Who breaks into Central Prison?", "correct": "Barry the Chopper", "options": ["Ling Yao's servants", "Edward Elric", "The scarred assassin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarry the Chopper.\n\n\tDuring interrogation it seems clear that Second Lieutenant Ross has no chance of being found innocent as corroborating reports aren't being investigated.  She has no choice but to wait in prison for the verdict.  The newspaper runs a story almost immediately after, proclaiming her the murderer, and this lands on Colonel Mustang's desk.  Soon, a plan is set in motion.\rBarry the Chopper escapes his safehouse in the city and heads on a rampage through prison, freeing Maria Ross and telling her that she can stay and die or take her chances in prison.  Along the way he also frees Ling Yao, imprisoned for being an illegal alien.  As they run through the city alleys, the Elric Brothers come across them and begin to battle Barry, allowing for Maria to get away en route to the rendezvous point.  Unfortunately, Colonel Mustang stands in her way, and with one explosive fireball, all that's left is a charred corpse.\rThe events spur a series of requests for leaves of absence.  Major Armstrong decides to go to Resembool with Edward in tow; Lieutenant Hawkeye asks for her own time off.  Ling Yao, now hiding out with Barry, uses a smoke signal to call his servants along.  Elsewhere, Lust frees Barry's body, now containing a more ravenous soul, to retrieve the metal Barry from his hiding place in the city. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Arrogant Palm of a Small Human\" - Edward and Major Armstrong travel through the desert to what famous ancient ruin?", "correct": "Xerxes", "options": ["Ishval", "Xing", "Bonath"], "explanation": "\n\n\nXerxes.\n\n\tReaching Resembool, Armstrong and Edward find Second Lieutenant Breda and end up riding camels into the eastern desert to the Ruins of Xerxes.  Ling's bodyguard meets them there to show them that Second Lieutenant Ross is alive and well, hiding as far away as possible from Central.  She ends up heading to Xing with a caravan to ensure her safety.\rAs it turned out, when the news broke that Ross was being convicted, Colonel Mustang and Barry ended up working together, orchestrating a rendezvous in the alley where Ross' death could be staged.  She was smuggled out of the city to Xerxes.  Ed was only kept in the dark to avoid any renegade behaviour.\rIn Central, Barry is attacked by Barry's body and, as such, Mustang's team is thrown into the chaos.  Havoc and Falman bring the Barrys out to the streets where Hawkeye, allegedly on leave, waits in a nearby clocktower with a sniper rifle, ready for any enemies to emerge.  Unfortunately, she's attacked from behind by Gluttony. \n"}, {"text": "\"Death of the Undying\" - Colonel Mustang defeats which of the following Homunculi in the basement of the Third Laboratory?", "correct": "Lust", "options": ["Envy", "Greed", "Gluttony"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLust.\n\n\tThough it seems that Gluttony has Lieutenant Hawkeye in his grasp, Colonel Mustang, who listened to the combat from his office, arrives at the last moment to blast the Homunculus out of the tower, incapacitating him temporarily.  Al arrives soon after, planning to help expose the people responsible for the Fifth Laboratory and Hughes' death, and he joins in pursuit of human Barry.  The journey ultimately leads them all to the Third Laboratory where Mustang, Hawkeye, Havoc, and Al descend to the basement level and split up.\rMustang and Havoc end up finding a dead end and, subsequently, Lust as she emerges from the darkness, revealing herself to be Solaris.  She also shows them her power as a Homunculus, stopping Mustang from using his flame powers by dousing them in water.  He is able to transmute the water in the room into hydrogen gas and, with the flick of a lighter, destroys the area, but with Lust's regenerative powers and the Philosopher's Stone at her core, she's able to fight back, stab both men, and leave them for dead on the floor.\rIn the opposite end of the lab, Al and Hawkeye find Barry in an immense room and end up getting trapped by Lust.  She destroys Barry, slicing him to pieces, before Al steps in to protect Hawkeye.  At the last moment he's able to transmute a wall and bring them to safety just before Colonel Mustang returns, having carved a transmutation circle into his hand and sealed his and Havoc's wounds with fire.  Using the flint on Havoc's lighter, he conjures flames to scorch Lust, and with enough blasts she perishes in a wisp of ash, destroying her and the stone completely.\rEdward, walking through Resembool, passes his mother's grave to find a man standing over it.  It's his father. \n"}, {"text": "\"Father Before the Grave\" - Who helps Ed dig up the body he and Al created in Resembool?", "correct": "Pinako", "options": ["Winry", "Van Hohenheim", "Major Armstrong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPinako.\n\n\tVan Hohenheim, Edward and Alphonse's father, returns to Resembool to stay with Pinako Rockbell and he ends up running into Ed on his way back from Xerxes.  Disappointed that his house has been razed and that the boys attempted human transmutation, he and Ed argue during the bulk of their reunion. Hohenheim ends up telling Pinako, knowing his son is eavesdropping, that it was unlikely his wife was in the body of the returned creature. He leaves the next day, giving Ed and Pinako the chance to dig up the body and confirm that it had a different hair colour from the boys' mother.  While this would imply that no one can come back from the dead, it means that Alphonse's body can be retrieved and his soul can return to it.  Ed returns to Central to tell Al and their newfound knowledge gives them newfound resolve to meet their goal. \n"}]}
