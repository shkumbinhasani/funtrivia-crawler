{"id": "407244", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 29\" [4] Quiz | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 29"], "questions": [{"text": "Early in Leg 7, teams needed to travel by bus to Venice, Italy, finding which of these in Piazza San Marco?", "correct": "A street sweeper", "options": ["A bike messenger", "A maitre'd", "A gondolier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA street sweeper.\n\n\tCracking open their clues in the Lake Como town of Cernobbio, teams were told to make their way by one of two early morning charter buses to the city of Venice, Italy.  The buses would take them to Marco Polo Airport at which point they would have to disembark and hop into a marked water taxi and head directly to Piazza San Marco.  Once there, teams could search the plaza for a local spazzino, a street sweeper, whose marked broom would indicate that he had their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which team did not complete the 'Sing It' Detour challenge in Venice in Leg 7?", "correct": "London and Logan", "options": ["Brooke and Scott", "Becca and Floyd", "Liz and Michael"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLondon and Logan.\n\n\tThe clue collected in Piazza San Marco was the teams' Detour, a choice between 'Sing It' and 'Bring It' in the early morning streets of Venice.  In 'Sing It', teams needed to get into a traditional Venice gondola and learn the lyrics and vocal stylings of \"La Biondina in Gondoleta\", a song which they would need to perform as their gondolier paddled them through the canals of the city.  If they could perform the song to the satisfaction of their mandolin player, he would reward them with the next clue.  Becca and Floyd, Liz and Michael, and Brooke and Scott completed this task \n"}, {"text": "What did teams need to haul around Venice during the 'Bring It' Detour task in Leg 7?", "correct": "Luggage", "options": ["A gondola", "Cannolis", "Artwork"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuggage.\n\n\tTeams completing 'Bring It' Detour task heaved their way through the narrow alleys of Venice instead of taking the leisurely trip through its waters.  Grabbing a unique dolly used to navigate the stair-covered bridges of the city, teams had to transport a pile of luggage from their starting point to a hotel.  Tara and Joey, Matt and Redmond, and London and Logan hauled it on this task, bringing their packs to their proper spots to get their clue. \n"}, {"text": "The Road Block encountered in Venice in Leg 7 asked team members to try their hand at what artistic ability?", "correct": "Painting", "options": ["Singing", "Dancing", "Acting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPainting.\n\n\tCompleting the Detour, teams were instructed to make their way by water taxi to Ca'Zenobio to find their next clue box waiting out front.  This was the teams' Road Block task wherein one member of each pair needed to assist the theatre troupe at Commedia dell'arte by taking one of their masquerade masks and painting a one-to-one copy of it.  If participants could hone their masked intentions and craft with precision and detail, they could nab their next clue.  Redmond, Tara, Floyd, Liz, London, and Brooke completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was last to arrive at the Pit Stop in Venice at the end of Leg 7?", "correct": "Liz and Michael", "options": ["London and Logan", "Tara and Joey", "Brooke and Scott"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiz and Michael.\n\n\tAfter finishing the tough Road Block, teams traded their masks for clues to their seventh Pit Stop, across the city of Venice at Campo San Vio, across the Grand Canal from Piazza San Marco.  Matt and Redmond, a challenge ahead of all the other teams, managed to claim the number one spot after seven legs of close calls. For their win, the pair took a trip for two to Grenada courtesy of Travelocity.  Liz and Michael were the last to check into the Pit Stop, arriving on the mat in sixth.  Fortunately, they checked in at a non-elimination Pit Stop and were spared from going home.  They would, however, need to face a Speed Bump in Leg 7. \n"}, {"text": "Did any teams use the Double U-Turn board found in Arachova, Greece in Leg 8?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tLeg 8 began with a ton of travel as teams needed to depart from Venice's Ponte della Costituzione and head across the Adriatic and Mediterranean to Patras, Greece.  To get there, teams flew from Venice to Bari, Italy on the eastern coast of the country.  From there, they hopped on a ferry to take them southeast to the city of Patras. Once there, teams drove themselves to the town of Arachova to find a traditional Greek wedding at Kaplanis Taverna and, surprisingly, the last Double U-Turn of the race.  Two teams used it: Brooke and Scott on Liz and Michael and Tara and Joey on Becca and Floyd. \n"}, {"text": "All six teams completed what Detour task in Greece (in Leg 8)?", "correct": "'For the Bride'", "options": ["'For the Groom'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'For the Bride'.\n\n\tWith the Double U-Turn in effect, the teams headed into the Detour in the town of Arachova.  Their choice: 'For the Bride' or 'For the Groom', both of which involved delivering a Greek wedding gift.  In 'For the Bride', teams had to bring two tins of sheeps milk to two locations, delivering it on the back of a mule. They would trade the milk for cheese which could be delivered to the bride for their next clue.  In 'For the Groom', teams instead raced up the staircase-- 252 steps up-- to the Church of Saint George, collected two sheep, and delivered them to the groom at the same wedding.  All teams completed 'For the Bride' while the U-Turned teams later went to 'For the Groom'. \n"}, {"text": "The team needing to complete the Speed Bump in Leg 8 had to serve which of the following Greek foods?", "correct": "Kokoretsi", "options": ["Greek salad", "Souvlaki", "Moussaka"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKokoretsi.\n\n\tBreaking open a plate at the end of the Detour, teams were instructed to drive to the Greek capital, Athens, where they could complete a lap around the Panathenaic Stadium to get their next clue.  While teams did this, Liz and Michael, having placed last in Leg 7, needed to complete their Speed Bump.  This meant that they had to visit a nearby food truck and take the time to make a traditional meat dish, kokoretsi, which involved skewering meat and intestines.  Once the food was prepared, they could rejoin at the literal race course. \n"}, {"text": "Who completed the Leg 8 Road Block at the Zappeion in Athens?", "correct": "Brooke", "options": ["Redmond", "Logan", "Joey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrooke.\n\n\tFinishing their victory lap, teams had to continue on foot to the Zappeion to grab their Road Block clue.  There, one member of each team joined the Greek Presidential Guards and donned their garb, learning how to perform the choreography of the traditional Changing of the Guards in front of the Zappeion.  If they could perform in sync, they could take their next clue and head to the Pit Stop.  Tara, Matt, Brooke, London, Becca and Liz stepped in time to get their clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was last to arrive at the Pit Stop in Greece, finding themselves eliminated at the end of Leg 8?", "correct": "Liz and Michael", "options": ["London and Logan", "Becca and Floyd", "Brooke and Scott"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiz and Michael.\n\n\tCompletion of the Road Block meant teams could keep heading around Athens on foot, but it marked their last task: finding the eighth Pit Stop.  If teams could find the Areopagus, an outcropping overlooking the Acropolis, they could find Phil and hit the mat.  Tara and Joey maintained a sizeable lead throughout the entire leg in Greece and, as such, won their third leg of the race. To celebrate their victory, the two were given a prize of $7,500 USD (each).  Liz and Michael placed last-- their third time in the race (after one keep-on-racing leg and one non-elimination leg).  It was their last Pit Stop altogether. \n"}]}
