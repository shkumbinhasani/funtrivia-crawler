{"id": "338129", "name": "Cell Phone Quiz | Word Play | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", " Word Play", "Cryptograms"], "questions": [{"text": "Using the letters that correspond with the numbers on a touchtone phone, you have to figure out which part of the cell I am calling. \n\n2 = A, B, C.\n3 = D, E, F.\n4 = G, H, I.\n5 = J, K, L.\n6 = M, N, O.\n7 = P, Q, R, S.\n8 = T, U, V.\n9 = W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor example, if I was calling the cell in general, I'd use:\n2=C, 3=E, 5=L, 5=L\n\nGot it? Then here we go!\n\nThese part of the cell can be reached by dialing 648-624-6637-42. At the other end, someone might say that you've reached the \"power plant of the cell\". What is this \"mighty\" organelle?", "correct": "Mitochondria", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMitochondria.\n\n\tThe mitochondria are found in both plant and animal cells. The mitochondria (plural form of mitochondrion) produce most of a cell's adenosine triphosphate. The mitochondrial count varies, depending on the type of tissue and organism. There may be anywhere from a single mitochondrion to a few thousand mitochondria in a cell. \n"}, {"text": "I picked up my phone again and dialed 298-675-276. What gooey part of the cell have I called?", "correct": "Cytoplasm", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCytoplasm.\n\n\tThe cytoplasm is a thick liquid that holds all cell organelles together, except for the nucleus. Most cell activities occur in the cytoplasm, as it stretches all the way around and through the cell. \n"}, {"text": "I felt like a swim, so I dialed up 822-8653 to see if this cell organelle was open for visitors. This cell part is much larger in plant cells, and is essentially filled with water. Lucky for me it was. So, where did I go?", "correct": "Vacuole", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVacuole.\n\n\tThe vacuole consists of water containing organic and inorganic material. The vacuole, unlike other organelles, has no set structure. The size and shape can vary like snowflakes, with no two being alike.\r When I went for my swim I found the smell was not too nice. Little did I know the vacuole also serves as a \"garbage dump\" where waste products are stored before being excreted out of the cell. Harmful materials and solutions are kept within the vacuole so they stay isolated from the rest of the cell. I don't expect to go back there again. \n"}, {"text": "I wasn't happy with my pool visit so I decided to let this organelle know about it. So I called them up at 682-5387 to complain. What part of the cell acts as the \"control centre\" or \"town hall\" of a cell?", "correct": "Nucleus", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNucleus.\n\n\tA cell's nucleus contains much of the cell's genetic material in the form of DNA. The nucleus also controls the cell's activities, so it also acts as a \"brain\". Inside the nucleus lies the nucleolus which makes ribosomes that help in protein synthesis. \n"}, {"text": "I tried to call 742-676-637, but I got a busy signal as I was told they were busy making proteins. ", "correct": "Ribosomes & Ribosome", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRibosomes & Ribosome.\n\n\tThe ribosomes produce important protein that is needed for the cell to survive. They link amino acids together, forming a chain, in order to produce these proteins. The proteins are a crucial part of a cell's DNA. \n"}, {"text": "I called up 245-676-75278 in an animal cell and then got an automated voice telling me \"The number you're calling does not exist\". Little did I know this organelle is only found in plant cells. The reason is because this cell organelle makes food via photosynthesis. What is it?", "correct": "Chloroplast", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nChloroplast.\n\n\tPlants are the basis of all life. In the chloroplast, sugars and starches are produced via photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are found in plants, and some protists, so if I had called a plant cell, there would be someone on the other end! \n"}, {"text": "Well after I couldn't reach them, I dialed 2355 and then 9255 in the animal cell, and again was told \"This line does not exist\". So after saying a few choice words, I redialed in the plant cell, and someone picked up! What organelle am I trying to get in contact with?", "correct": "Cell Wall", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCell Wall.\n\n\tThe cell wall is the outer casing of a plant cell. The wall is made of cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose. Water and small molecules can get through the wall, as well as select proteins. \n"}, {"text": "Talk about tough to get in contact with! I phoned the 3636-7527-642 then I was told to dial the extension 738-428-586, then was told to either press 1 for the \"smooth\" or to press 2 for the \"rough\".", "correct": "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEndoplasmic Reticulum.\n\n\tThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) acts as the packaging system in a cell. The ER stretches throughout the cell like roads. Rough ER holds ribosomes, and appear bumpy. Smooth ER acts like storage bins, and look more like cylinders. The rough ER is important in the making of proteins. Proteins, once finished, can be sent off around the cell through the ER to reach their intended destination. \n"}, {"text": "I reached these bodies by typing in 46544 on my phone. I reached, yet another answering machine telling me they were out sorting the chemicals they were storing. Who did I call this time?", "correct": "Golgi & Golgi Bodies & Golgi Body & Golgi Complex", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolgi & Golgi Bodies & Golgi Body & Golgi Complex.\n\n\tThe Golgi bodies' role in the cell is to sort, store and release proteins, chemicals and other substances needed by the cell. They are flat membranes that are stacked on top of each other. Golgi bodies also package vesicles which are made of the above substances. They are named after Italian physicist Camillo Golgi, who discovered them in 1898. \n"}, {"text": "I dialed up 597-676-63 and ironically the voice on the other end asked me if I was hungry. I said yes, and they said good, 'cause we're the digestion centre of the cell. Who did I call?", "correct": "Lysosome & Lysosomes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLysosome & Lysosomes.\n\n\tThe lysosomes act as the digestion hub in the cell. They hold enzymes created by the cell. The lysosomes are a specialized vesicle, produced by the Golgi bodies. The enzymes are produced by the endoplasmic reticulum and are placed in the vesicle by the Golgi bodies. Once they are built, they float in the cytoplasm until they are needed. \n"}]}
