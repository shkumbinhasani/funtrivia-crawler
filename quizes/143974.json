{"id": "143974", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Welcome to Korea' (Part 2) Online Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "When we left off in the first quiz, Hawkeye and Radar had just met up with BJ, and the three of them were having drinks at an officer's club at a military base.  While finishing up the drinks, Hawkeye orders Radar to pay for the drinks, but unfortunately the lad hasn't enough cash.  BJ pulls out a wad of cash, prompting Hawkeye to ask if the new doctor enjoys which game?", "correct": "Poker", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoker.\n\n\tHawkeye eyes BJ's thick wad of cash and asks, 'You, uh, play poker, doctor?'  'I'm not very good,' B.J. responds.  Hawkeye answers, 'Neither am I.'  Sure, Hawk! \n"}, {"text": "Meanwhile, back at the camp, we find Frank in Father Mulcahy's tent discussing the coming week's sermon.  Apparently Frank has submitted a lecture that he wants Mulcahy to 'work into the sermon'.  What theme is inferred in this lecture?", "correct": "Strength through obedience", "options": ["Slovenliness and punishment", "The evils of thinking for oneself", "Better morale from strong discipline"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrength through obedience.\n\n\tA Frank Burns-led 4077th is looking more and more exciting all the time!  Margaret soon enters the tent and questions Frank about Hawkeye's absence (she did not make the order that he could leave!)  Frank asks if Margaret has looked everywhere for Hawkeye, to which she responds, 'Obviously I've looked everywhere if I know that he's not anywhere, or nowhere!'  Huh? \n"}, {"text": "Returning to Hawkeye, BJ and Radar, we find them on the road back to the 4077th.  Their first encounter on the way back from the airbase is with which of the following?", "correct": "Military police", "options": ["Wounded soldiers", "Armed local guerrillas", "A farming family"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilitary police.\n\n\tTheir first human encounter during their return trip is with the same military police Hawkeye and Radar had met on the way to Kimpo.  If you'll recall, they had tricked the MP into believing that Radar was suffering from neurapraxia.  The MP is quite skeptical when he notices that, not only is Radar now driving the jeep, but the jeep is entirely different as well.  This makes sense since they had stolen a general's jeep at Kimpo! \n"}, {"text": "Still on the road back to the 4077th, Hawkeye and friends discover a farming family at the side of the road.  With what activity is this family engaged?", "correct": "Searching for landmines in a field", "options": ["Tending to a wounded Korean soldier", "Gathering shrapnel and other metal scraps", "Plowing and tilling a field"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSearching for landmines in a field.\n\n\tWhile the father, mother and young son stand by the side of the road with the family's ox, the two daughters search through a field with high grass for landmines using only long sticks.  Radar and Hawkeye scream for the girls to stop, but to no avail.  One of the girls is injured when a mine goes off under her stick. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye becomes upset with the father of the Korean family and calls him what he believes to be a derisive word in the Korean language, 'u-san'.  Radar informs Hawkeye that he has called the father which of the following?", "correct": "Umbrella", "options": ["Tree trunk", "Coat hanger", "Airplane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUmbrella.\n\n\tAnd Radar is very much correct!  The Korean word for umbrella is indeed 'u-san' (this is also the Chinese word, 'yu-san').  Hawkeye believes he is calling the father a 'jackass'.  After the landmine blows up near the girl Radar bravely (or foolishly) runs out into the field and picks her up.  Afterward, the entire family, aside from the father and the ox, drives off with to a hospital with the M*A*S*H-ites. \n"}, {"text": "The next adventure for Hawkeye and friends involves a flat tire, and some hostile locals.  After very hurriedly changing the flat tire, Hawkeye swiftly drives off.  Just before doing so, Radar attempts to save which item?", "correct": "The jack", "options": ["The lug nuts", "The T-bar", "The flat tire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe jack.\n\n\tSeveral locals walk by the jeep while the doctors and Radar work on the flat, then disappear into nearby bushes.  Soon after, gunshots ring out and the M*A*S*H-ites desperately throw the spare tire onto the car before hopping back into the jeep.  Radar then realizes that they have left the 'general's jack' and attempts to save it.  Hawkeye commands Radar to 'salute it and get in!'  The jack is left behind... \n"}, {"text": "What item of Radar's does he claim to have 'left in the other jeep' during this scene, only to have it mysteriously reappear several minutes later?", "correct": "Gum", "options": ["Hat", "Glasses", "Pen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGum.\n\n\tEarlier in the scene Radar makes a small scene about leaving his gum in the other jeep.  After they set off on the road again, Radar suddenly pops a 'chiclet' into his mouth.  Hmm...he must have been mistaken.  Later he gives a few chiclets to a wounded soldier. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and friends next encounter a small regiment of U.S. soldiers.  After a brief chit-chat, they find themselves bombarded by mortar shells.  Which of the following doesn't happen to BJ during this brief scene?", "correct": "He receives his first battle wound", "options": ["He cares for his first combat casualty", "He becomes sick and vomits after viewing a dead soldier", "He falls face first into mud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe receives his first battle wound.\n\n\tIn the space of a few minutes, BJ is indoctrinated into the horrors of war.  He cares for a soldier wounded in the leg, then charges over to assist Hawkeye and falls face first into a muddy tire rut.  Attempting to help a soldier lying face down, BJ becomes nauseated at the site of his mangled face and body, and proceeds to vomit.  Thus the title of the episode 'Welcome to Korea'. \n"}, {"text": "After a stop at Rosie's Bar, where Hawkeye and B.J. get quite drunk, they finally return to the 4077th.  What are BJ's first words upon being introduced to Frank Burns?", "correct": "What say you, Ferret Face?", "options": ["Nice to meet you Major Ferret Face!", "Reporting for duty, Ferret Face!", "Chin up, Major Ferret Face!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhat say you, Ferret Face?.\n\n\tBJ then drunkenly falls into the arms of Margaret, standing right nearby.  So much for molding BJ in Frank's image!  Poor Frank's torture will continue on!  (And it does...Frank is arrested by the MPs for stealing a general's jeep in the very next scene.) \n"}, {"text": "Does Harry Morgan appear in the episode 'Welcome to Korea' as the ever-loving Colonel Potter?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tColonel Potter is announced as a member of the cast at the end of the episode.  We then see him arrive at the 4077th in a jeep.  He drives up in front of the operating room where Radar is sunning himself.  Radar's first words to Colonel Potter, 'Stick that horn in your ear!'  Colonel Potter's first words in response, 'On your feet soldier I'm Colonel Potter!'  Morgan is also credited at the beginning of the episode, but his true introduction comes in the following episode called 'Change of Command'.
