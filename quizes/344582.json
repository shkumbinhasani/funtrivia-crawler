Realizing that the things in the house are no longer hers, she seeks comfort for a man who places his hand on her shoulder.  She says she can't find her baby as they depart.  The Rubberman suit, thrown out earlier in the night after its discovery in the attic, is retrieved from the trash outside.\rVivian finds the figure in her bedroom doorway before they begin to make love.  As the Rubberman leaves the bedroom, he passes Ben in the hallway, making his way back to the room.  Elsewhere in the house, Rubberman removes his mask, revealing himself to be Tate. \n"}, {"text": "Who purchased the rubber suit?", "correct": "Chad", "options": ["Larry", "Ben", "Constance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChad.\n\n\tIn the kitchen, Viv tells Marcy and Moira about her encounter with the past owner of the house, Nora, based on the picture of her that Violet saw in the attic.  Marcy reasons that she must've had a granddaughter and Moira says that perhaps everyone has a doppelganger.  Vivian is sure, however, that she saw what she saw.  Marcy decides to leave because she needs to contact Mr. Escandarian who has, mysteriously gone missing.  Viv thinks that maybe she really is going crazy.\rThe previous year, Chad spoke with a friend about his issues with Patrick; he knew Patrick cheated on him and he'd been sleepwalking.  Further, Patrick seemed uneasy whenever they discussed adoption.  When Chad found Patrick's open computer, he discovered that his boyfriend had an interest in S&M gear, so his friend suggested that perhaps a preemptive strike was in order.  Heading to an S&M shop, Chad purchased the rubber suit in an attempt to appeal to Patrick's desires. \n"}, {"text": "How does Hayden prove to Nora that she's dead?", "correct": "By showing her her fatal wound", "options": ["By making her leave the house", "By showing pictures of her funeral", "By pushing her down the stairs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy showing her her fatal wound.\n\n\tAt the house, Patrick was approached by Chad in the rubber suit while in the bedroom.  Rather than feel attraction to the idea, Patrick felt repulsed.  Instead of being interested in Chad, he decided to laugh.  Soon, the two began to argue about their life together; Patrick claimed he'd never met the guys on the chat room online and he liked leather-- not latex, and he wondered what Chad would hold over his head when they lost the house.\rNora cries over her misfortunes in the bedroom of the Harmon household before Hayden comes in and tells her to stop; she's driving her crazy.  Nora asks who she is and Hayden claims that, like the others, she's dead.  Nora doesn't believe she's dead until Hayden makes her feel the gunshot wound in the back of her head.  Hayden assures her that some of the spirits trapped in the house are good, but others are not. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Hayden want to drive Vivian mad?", "correct": "To claim one of her babies", "options": ["To drive her away from the house", "To prove that she's the stronger woman", "Out of revenge for forcing Ben away"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo claim one of her babies.\n\n\tHayden claims that the house has a power over the spirits, trapping them there in the afterlife, but it's also a power that they can use to get what they want.  Nora wonders why she would kill herself but soon she believes it was because of her baby.  Hayden says that she lost her baby too and they both agree that it's unfair that Vivian could have two babies.  Hayden suggests that they each take one of the twins-- the babies have to have mothers and you can't raise a baby in the loony bin.\rViv, tired in the dark house, cleans up before bed and walks down the hall before the ball from the attic is rolled to her feet.  She turns on the light, but there's no one there.  That's when the lights flicker out and a vase falls from the mantle-- Hayden's doing. \n"}, {"text": "Where in the house were Chad and Patrick's bodies found?", "correct": "The basement", "options": ["The attic", "The backyard", "The bedroom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe basement.\n\n\tVivian continues in the dark as more items break.  She's pushed into the bathroom by a moving bookcase and she finds the rubber mask sitting on the sink, causing her to cower in fear.\rA year and a half ago, at this very sink, Tate donned the Rubberman suit, went downstairs, and attacked Chad, breaking his neck in the bucket of bobbing apples on Halloween.  Patrick came in shortly after and tried to fight back, but this was futile.  Tate got the upper hand and knocked him out before beating him to death with the fire poker.  Bringing both of their bodies downstairs to the cellar, he comforted Nora by by assuring her that these men no longer wanted a child after their constant fighting.  By killing them, he would ensure that a new family could move in and, perhaps, give her the child she wanted. \n"}, {"text": "Viv tries to reason that which of these is responsible for her 'seeing things' in the house?", "correct": "Nausea medication", "options": ["Pregnancy hormones", "Lack of sleep", "Brain tumor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNausea medication.\n\n\tIn the basement, Ben finds Violet talking to someone in the basement.  He brushes it off because the matter at hand is more important-- she hasn't been in school in two weeks and her teachers are concerned.  She says she doesn't like it.  It's boring and she gets bullied.  Ben asks if she's told her mother, but Violet says he's blind to the fact that Viv is going crazy.  When she's not worrying about everything, she's eating raw brains.  Ben reasons that she's probably suffering from depression, but Violet says if she is, he's the one responsible for putting her there.\rIn the kitchen, Viv asks to have a heart-to-heart talk with Moira.  She says that her nausea medication must be the only explanation for all the crazy stuff going on.  Moira says that she just needs a good cry.  Viv says everyone thinks she's crazy, but Moira says that men will do that.  She refers to Charlotte perkins Gilman's \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" and says that men make women seem crazier, even going so far as to make up diseases for them.  Moira says that Viv is not crazy and it's not the drugs.  Moira says that this house is possessed and she needs to get out while she still can. \n"}, {"text": "Do Vivian and Violet manage to drive away from the house during their escape?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tViv wakes Violet up in the middle of the night and says that they need to leave the house and go to Aunt Jo's.  They get their things and pack them into the car.  Tate watches from the door as Violet gets into the car, but they don't get far; the two home invaders are in the back seat.  Vivian and Violet, frightened, rush back into the house while Hayden looks on with delight.\rBen criticizes Viv's decision to take Violet out of state without his consent but Viv is shocked that he's not even listening to her-- the people that tried to murder them five months earlier were six inches from her face.  He doesn't believe her and tries to diagnose her, but she says that Violet can confirm it because she was there too. \n"}, {"text": "Who recommends to Violet that she lie about what she saw during the house escape?", "correct": "Tate", "options": ["Vivian", "Hayden", "Ben"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTate.\n\n\tTate and Violet talk in her room about the spirits of the house and Tate says they can't hurt them.  She asks about the home invaders and Tate says she can't say anything about them because they'll think she's crazy and lock her up.  They'll try to take her away and they'll never see her again.  Ben calls her downstairs.\rBen says that Viv must be mentally unstable since she's seeing things.  Vivian brings up Hayden and suggests that perhaps he gave her the code to the house.  Maybe he's trying to kill her.  She shows him the rubber mask and, genuinely surprised, he says he threw it out months ago.\rWhen Violet comes in, they ask her to tell the truth about what happened.  She says that she saw Viv really upset and that she told the police what she thought she wanted to tell them.  She claims that she didn't see anything.  Ben says that he's staying in his office for the night to protect his daughter. \n"}, {"text": "What does Viv steal from Marcy's purse?", "correct": "A gun", "options": ["Money", "A cell phone", "A business card"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA gun.\n\n\tIn the basement, Hayden and Tate discuss what's happening in the house.  Tate says he's tired of being the bad guy and that he's in love.  Hayden says that Viv's already booked the tickets to Florida, so he needs to act fast to stop them.\rVivian invites Marcy to the house and sits her down to say that she and Violet will be leaving the next day.  In addition, she wants to know about Mr. Escandarian, whose offer they accepted but have yet to hear about.  Marcy says that the man won't return her calls.  Viv says that she's not trying to be confrontational, she's just pregnant, dizzy, nauseous, and plagued by migraines.  She asks Marcy to get her a glass of water and when she does, she takes the gun hidden in Marcy's purse and hides it under the cushion of her chair.  Marcy shows herself out of the house, happy to be rid of the responsibility of looking after Viv.\rThat night, before going to sleep, Viv looks underneath her bed with a flashlight, checks behind the drapes and in the closet, and makes sure the room is secure before trying to sleep.  In the darkness, the Rubberman grabs her and she races to her bedside table to hit the panic button on her security system.  She grabs the gun and fires when the door to the bedroom opens and she hits Ben in the arm.\rWhen the paramedics arrive to look after Ben's wound, Viv is given a valium and left upstairs.  Luke also arrives because of the emergency call and they discuss Vivian's recent fears and delusions. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of the episode, Vivian is taken to which of these places?", "correct": "A mental health facility", "options": ["An airport", "A hospital", "The cellar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA mental health facility.\n\n\tUpstairs, Vivian, dreary and suffering from the side-effects of the valium, is woken up by Hayden who smashes the security remote.  Viv tells Hayden that she can have Ben, but Hayden doesn't want him either.  Instead, she wants the babies.  Hayden says that she's dead and she has the father of her babies with her.  Rubberman emerges from the shadows to attack Viv, bringing her to the floor.  In her deluded state, Vivian doesn't notice he's gone until Ben is on top of her, trying to help.  He and Luke are unable to understand how the man in the rubber suit could've even been there.  She also says that Hayden was there.  She tries to prove the truth, but it's too late-- the cops are ready to take her away.  She's unstable and she needs to be evaluated by mental health officials.  Ben says he didn't want to do it, but it's for the best; he shot her and she's unsafe.\rViv is taken downstairs, comforted at least by the fact that she'll be out of the house.  Ben and Luke take her out the front door and Violet says it's all her fault.  Ben says it isn't-- she told the truth.  When Ben leaves, Tate says that he's still there with her.\rA year and a half earlier, when Tate killed Patrick and Chad, the two of them spent their final moments reaching for each other's hands on basement floor.  Moira convinced Tate to shoot them using their own gun to spare them from an embarrassing death in the faces of their families.  He did so, shooting Patrick thrice and leaving the gun in Chad's hand.  When they died, Tate said that it was romantic.  They could be together forever. \n"}]}
