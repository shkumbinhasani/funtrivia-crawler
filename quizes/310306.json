After this first episode in the series, the treehouse faded from the picture.\rThe episode opens with Marge warning the audience about the episode's content.  Homer, dressed as a ghost, returns home from a night of trick-or-treating to find the kids still awake in the treehouse in the backyard.  Lisa tells the urban legend about the babysitter with a murderer in the house and Bart says that it isn't scary; he heard it in the third grade.  Lisa challenges him to tell a funnier one and he takes the stage to tell \"Bad Dream House\". \n"}, {"text": "In \"Bad Dream House\", what is the first ghoulish incident to occur?", "correct": "Levitating books", "options": ["The house vibrates", "An omniscient voice speaks", "The walls bleed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLevitating books.\n\n\tIn this vignette, the family moves into a creepy, old house on a hill.  As Homer tips their moving van driver with a dollar bill, the man remarks that he's happy the house is cursed.  Homer just blows the idea off.  Marge is concerned with the deal they got on the house saying it was too inexpensive to be true; Homer calls the place a motivated seller. While Bart begins unpacking a box of books, no one notices a ghostly force placing them back into the box, and when no one watches, one book flies across the room and hits Lisa in the back of the head.  Before anyone can react, an odd voice grumbles \"Get out\".  Homer reasons that the house is just settling. \n"}, {"text": "What do the Simpsons find in their new kitchen in \"Bad Dream House\"?", "correct": "A vortex", "options": ["A noose", "A corpse", "A large stove"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA vortex.\n\n\tMarge walks into the new kitchen as the walls and cupboards begin to bleed and she comments that it needs a woman's touch.  As she puts down some pots and pans, she looks to the wall to find a wormhole.  When Homer and Lisa go in to check it out, Lisa says that it must be a vortex or a portal to another dimension.  Homer tests this theory by tossing in an orange- in response he gets a letter telling him to stop throwing food into the other dimension.\rMeanwhile, Bart screams for help in the living room.  A force has lifted him and Maggie off the ground and has begun to strangle him with the cord of a table lamp.  Homer tells Bart, as he pulls him to the ground, that he has some explaining to do, but Lisa interrupts with the thought that there's an evil presence in the house.  Marge quickly shows her concern and tells the kids to get their coats, but before they can, they float directly onto them.  Homer tells them not to leave- it's a fixer-upper.  They decide to stay one night. \n"}, {"text": "What happens to the Simpsons' new abode in \"Bad Dream House\"?", "correct": "It destroys itself", "options": ["It eats them all", "It promises to be nice", "It turns into a spaceship"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt destroys itself.\n\n\tIn the middle of the night, the family slowly wakes up.  Bart, Lisa, Homer, and Maggie are all convinced by the voice within the house to get a sharp weapon and kill one another.  Before they have a chance to attack each other in the living room, Marge emerges from the kitchen, having made herself a sandwich, and she tells them to stop. When they realize what they're doing, they drop their weapons and Marge tells them that they need to leave.  Lisa finds an ancient Indian burial ground in the basement and Homer calls the real estate agent.  Soon though, the house starts trying to tell the family that they will all die in horrible ways, but Marge angrily yells back that it needs to stop trying to push them around. The kids soon start trying to ask the house questions and Bart asks it to make the walls bleed again.  When Lisa asks it why it's acting the way it is, Marge tells it that regardless, it needs to be nicer because they're all living there regardless.  The house asks the family for a moment to think and they all head out to the street to let it, but they watch as it implodes in upon itself (a la \"Poltergeist\").  Rather than live with the Simpson family, the house decides that destruction is the only option. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Hungry Are the Damned\", what are the Simpsons doing when they are abducted?", "correct": "Barbecuing", "options": ["Washing the car", "Playing tennis", "Driving to the mall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarbecuing.\n\n\tSuffice to say, Lisa is not impressed with Bart's haunted house story.  He attempts to scare her with a story about aliens, \"Hungry are the Damned\".\rThe story starts with the Simpson family in the backyard.  Homer fires up the barbecue (with more than enough starter fluid) and starts making the family some burgers.  Lisa, who lays in the grass, watches in shock as a UFO floats across their backyard, and soon, the family is helpless as they are abducted by the flying saucer's tractor beam.  Although most of the family simply shoots up into the ship, Homer's size requires that two tractor beams pull him up.  All this time, he continues to eat his burger. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these meals is not served to the Simpsons on the UFO in \"Hungry are the Damned\"?", "correct": "Lamb Chops", "options": ["Radish Rosettes", "Fried Shrimp", "Sloppy Joes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLamb Chops.\n\n\tThe aliens on the ship introduce themselves as citizens of the planet Rigel 4.  While Lisa gives a speech about why the Simpsons should be spared from abduction, Kang informs them that it's time for dinner as another alien pushes out a table of food.  Each member of the family receives their favourite dish; Lisa gets Fried Shrimp, Bart gets Sloppy Joes, Homer gets Pork Chops, and Marge gets Radish Rosettes (which she claims are extremely hard to make).  Kang tells the family to 'grow large with food' and Lisa suspects something isn't right.  While the family eats, the aliens watch over them, drooling.\rAfter dinner, the aliens take the Simpsons on a tour of the ship, showing them various forms of entertainment (such as an intergalactic TV and a copy of \"Pong\").  Before they know it though, it's once again time for more food.\rAfter listening to the aliens throw around phrases like 'chew the fat' and after the family is weighed, Lisa goes to explore the ship.  When she finds the kitchen, she discovers a book called 'How to Cook Humans' on the countertop and she rushes to show the family. \n"}, {"text": "What is the full title of the book Lisa finds in the UFO in \"Hungry are the Damned\"?", "correct": "How to Cook for Forty Humans", "options": ["Chicken Soup for the Intergalactic Soul", "How to Cook Humans", "How to Cook Ninety Humans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHow to Cook for Forty Humans.\n\n\tLisa finds the family seated once more at a dinner table, and while the family is a bit confused as to why she's so worried, she reveals the cookbook as Kang appears.  Homer tells Kang that nobody eats the Simpson family and Kang replies that it's preposterous.  He explains that it's a harmless cookbook before blowing a layer of space dust off the cover. Eventually, the family discovers that it's a cookbook from Rigel 4 about cooking for humans as opposed to cooking with them.  The aliens are shocked by the accusations brought on by the family and the chef alien ends up breaking down into tears because of the family's reaction. Rather than take them to Rigel 4, the aliens drop the Simpsons off in their own backyard saying that they would have lived forever as Gods on their planet, experiencing emotions thousands of times greater than on Earth, but it can no longer be.  They take off and the family tells off Lisa for being too smart for her own good. \n"}, {"text": "Who tells the story of \"The Raven\"?", "correct": "Lisa", "options": ["Bart", "Homer", "Marge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLisa.\n\n\tAfter \"Hungry are the Damned\", the kids realize that they haven't really scared each other.  Bart attempts to pull a gag to scare his sister, but she remains in the treehouse reading a school book.  When he tells her to put it away, she says that she's going to read a classic horror story by Edgar Allen Poe, \"The Raven\".\rOnce upon a midnight dreary, Homer sits in his chamber reading a book of Forgotten Lore.  He awakens from a nap once he hears a rapping at his chamber door, but he falls back into a deep sleep, recognizing it as a visitor and nothing more.\rBart doesn't find this scary, but Lisa tells him to wait- the author is establishing mood. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Raven\", Homer remembers his lost love.  What is her name?", "correct": "Lenore", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLenore.\n\n\tAwakening from his slumber once more, Homer puts down his volume of Forgotten Lore and walks to the wall to view a picture of his long-lost Lenore.  Soon though, he is frightened again, this time by the breeze and curtains, and once more of the stranger knocking at his chamber door.  He slowly advances to his door, apologizing to the stranger for having not arrived sooner, but when he opens it, there is no one there but darkness, and nothing more.\rHomer hears a louder banging when he goes back into the room and he opens the shutter to investigate, but in walks a darkened raven who crosses the room perches itself.  As he inquires as to why it has flown in, the raven speaks- \"Nevermore!\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Raven\", where does the titular bird actually sit?", "correct": "Atop the chamber door", "options": ["Upon the floor", "On the frame of a picture of Lenore", "By the window, near the shore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtop the chamber door.\n\n\tHomer weeps for his lost Lenore and the raven once more quoth \"Nevermore.\"  Homer gets angry with the bird and yells at the figure to leave, but it continues to rest on the bust above the chamber door.  When he realizes that the raven will not leave, he chases it around the room, climbing shelves and throwing vases and books, but nevertheless it is all in vain.  As he sits in the mess on the floor, and watches the raven's shadow from atop his chamber door, he realizes that his soul will be lifted nevermore.\rAfter the story is told, both Bart and Lisa are a bit let down.  Realizing that perhaps they aren't that easy to scare, they go to bed.  Homer on the other hand, who listened to the stories from outside the treehouse, goes to bed worried and asks Marge to keep the lights on.  As she turns it out and goes to bed, Homer watches a raven fly by out the window and a wolf howls in the moonlight. \n"}]}
