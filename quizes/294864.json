{"id": "294864", "name": "Yessongs Quiz | Music | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music T-Z", "Yes"], "questions": [{"text": "The album opens with an excerpt from which Igor Stravinsky classic?", "correct": "'Firebird Suite'", "options": ["'Oedipus Rex'", "'The Rite of Spring'", "'Requiem Canticles'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Firebird Suite'.\n\n\t'The Firebird' was a ballet written by Stravinsky in 1910. Yes frequently open live performances with their version of 'Excerpts from the Firebird Suite'. \n"}, {"text": "Which is the only track on the album that is a solo composition by Steve Howe?", "correct": "'Mood for a Day'", "options": ["'Close the the Edge'", "'Roundabout'", "'I've Seen All Good People'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Mood for a Day'.\n\n\t'Mood for a Day' first appeared on the fourth Yes album, 'Fragile' in 1971. This album was particularly notable as it was Rick Wakeman's first with the group. It also included numerous tracks that would become Yes standards, notably 'Roundabout', 'Long Distance Runaround' and 'Heart of the Sunrise'.\rIn addition to the classics, each band member contributed one solo track to 'Fragile', and Steve Howe's was 'Mood for a Day'.\rOf the alternatives, all three were Howe/Anderson collaborations. \n"}, {"text": "The first half of which track includes the lyrics: \"Move me on to any black square//Make the white queen run so fast\"? ", "correct": "'I've Seen All Good People'", "options": ["'Starship Trooper'", "'Close to the Edge'", "'Siberian Khatru'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'I've Seen All Good People'.\n\n\t'I've Seen All Good People' debuted on the third album, 'The Yes Album'. It is divided into two distinct sections, 'Your Move', written by Jon Anderson, which includes numerous chess references including those in the question, and 'All Good People' written by Chris Squire. \n"}, {"text": "Which single track filled one whole side of the original 3-disc record release of 'Yessongs'?", "correct": "'Close to the Edge'", "options": ["'I've Seen All Good People'", "'Yours is No Disgrace'", "'And You and I'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Close to the Edge'.\n\n\tWeighing in at 18 minutes 13 seconds, 'Close to the Edge' is the only track on 'Side 5' of the original album. The track is split into four movements, 'The Solid Time of Change', the very short 'Total Mass Retain', 'I Get Up I Get Down' and 'Seasons of Man'. All four sections were written by Jon Anderson, 'I Get Up I Get Down' with Chris Squire and the other three with Steve Howe.\r'Close to the Edge' was the title track on the groups' fifth album, released in 1972. It occupied the whole of Side 1 with two other tracks that also appear on 'Yessongs', 'And You and I' and 'Siberian Khatru' on Side 2. \n"}, {"text": "Alan White is the drummer on most of 'Yessongs', but on which two tracks is Bill Bruford the stickman? ", "correct": "'Perpetual Change'/'Long Distance Runaround'", "options": ["'Siberian Khatru'/'And You and I'", "'Close to the Edge'/'Yours is No Disgrace'", "'Starship Trooper'/'Heart of the Sunrise'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Perpetual Change'/'Long Distance Runaround'.\n\n\tWilliam Scott Bruford was the original drummer with Yes, when he shared a house with Anderson and Squire. He left in 1972 to join King Crimson and also toured as the drummer with Genesis.\rAlan White joined Yes at the start of the 1972 'Close to the Edge Tour' on a three-month trial. He has featured on every Yes album since. Born in County Durham, he is a lifelong-member of Newcastle United's 'Toon Army. \n"}, {"text": "Which other Yes album was released outside North America in the same year as 'Yessongs'?", "correct": "'Tales from  Topographic Oceans'", "options": ["'Going for the One'", "'Relayer'", "'Close to the Edge'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Tales from  Topographic Oceans'.\n\n\t'Yessongs' was released in May 1973. December 1973 saw the worldwide release of the 4-track double-album 'Tales from Topographic Oceans' (although this was not released in North America until  January 1974). This was never the most popular of Yes albums in most quarters. Indeed, Rick Wakeman famously once ate a curry during a live performance of one of the exceedingly long tracks from 'Tales', one of the events which ultimately led to his departure from the band, to be replaced by Patrick Moraz on the 'Relayer' album which followed.\rOf the alternatives, most of 'Yessongs' was recorded on the 1972 'Close to the Edge' tour and that album came out a year earlier. 'Relayer' followed in 1974 and 'Going for the One' appeared in 1977. \n"}, {"text": "Which song on the album is divided into three segments subtitled 'Life Seeker', 'Disillusion'  and 'W\u00fcrm'?", "correct": "'Starship Trooper'", "options": ["'Close to the Edge'", "'Yours is No Disgrace'", "'And You and I'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Starship Trooper'.\n\n\tThis was 'Starship Trooper', the final track on the album and, for me, the best. It first appeared on 'The Yes Album' in 1971.\rJon Anderson apparently once claimed authorship of the first two sections of this track, although 'Disillusion' is usually credited to Chris Squire. 'W\u00fcrm' is an awesome three-minute-plus guitar segment from the brilliant Steve Howe that evolved from a song he originally wrote for his earlier group, Bodcast. \n"}, {"text": "Which four-part track begins with Steve Howe tuning his guitar?", "correct": "'And You and I'", "options": ["'Six Wives of Henry VIII'", "'Close to the Edge'", "'Yours is No Disgrace'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'And You and I'.\n\n\t'And You and I' originally made up half of Side 2 of the 'Close to the Edge' album. It is divided into four movements beginning with 'Cord of Life', which starts out as a Howe guitar solo and then introduces the vocal melody half way through. Then comes 'Eclipse' which has some superb synth work by Rick Wakeman, 'The Preacher The Teacher' and the short, haunting 'Apocalypse' to close. All in all, another brilliant composition. \n"}, {"text": "Which track is the Rick Wakeman solo composition on the album?", "correct": "'Excerpts from The Six Wives of Henry VIII'", "options": ["'Perpetual Change'", "'Siberian Khatru'", "'Roundabout'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Excerpts from The Six Wives of Henry VIII'.\n\n\t'The Six Wives of Henry VIII' was a Rick Wakeman solo album that was released in the same year as 'Yessongs', 1973. The six-and-a-half minute excerpt on 'Yessongs' is primarily an expansion of the 'Catherine of Aragon' track from the Wakeman album which allows the keyboard maestro to display his undoubted dexterity. \n"}, {"text": "Which nearly 10-minute track from 'Yessongs' was edited and released as a single in 1972?", "correct": "'Roundabout'", "options": ["'Perpetual Change'", "'And You and I'", "'Yours is No Disgrace'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Roundabout'.\n\n\tWritten by Jon Anderson and Steve Howe, 'Roundabout' is probably the most widely known of all Yes songs primarily because of its release as a single. It first appeared as the opening track on the 1971 'Fragile' album. The 1972 single had a shortened version of 'Long Distance Runaround' on the B-side.\r Thanks for playing this quiz and, whatever your score, may I say in the words of  Anderson, Bruford, Kay, Squire and Howe 'Yours is No Disgrace'. \n"}]}
