{"id": "189663", "name": "History of Astronomy - Part 3 Trivia Game | History of Science | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " History of Science"], "questions": [{"text": "When we left the Greek world in the second quiz, the Platonic revolution was in full flux.  Plato's greatest pupil was undoubtedly Aristotle, a student who disagreed with his master about a great many things.  However, in the realm of astronomy their differences weren't so pronounced.  Which of these is not true of Aristotle and his cosmological belief system?", "correct": "He believed that the Earth revolved around the sun", "options": ["He subscribed to the theory of heavenly spheres first developed by Eudoxus", "He believed that the world was a globe", "He endorsed the idea of a geocentric universe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe believed that the Earth revolved around the sun.\n\n\tMuch like Plato, Aristotle promoted the concept of a geocentric solar system, with the planets held in place by a series of concentric spheres.  Like the Pythagoreans, and his master Plato, Aristotle endorsed the concept that the Earth was spherical, but it certainly did not revolve around the sun.  Aristotle's book of astronomical theory was called 'On the Heavens' (De Caelo).  Most of the Aristotelian cosmological program was adopted by Ptolemy in the 2nd century A.D. \n"}, {"text": "Bucking the Platonic trend was another student of Plato, Heracleides of Pontus.  Contrary to the system being developed by the Platonists and the Aristotelians, Heracleides asserted which of the following hypotheses?", "correct": "The Earth revolves around its own axis", "options": ["The sun was the largest object in the solar system", "The Earth was spherical in shape", "The solar system rotated around the center of the galaxy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Earth revolves around its own axis.\n\n\tHeracleides (c. 390 - c. 322 BC) contradicted conventional wisdom by announcing his theory that the Earth rotated about its own axis, directly contradicting the Platonic/Aristotelian notion that the Earth was fixed in position.  Heracleides further blasphemed against the general intellectual trends of the day by suggesting that Venus and Mercury revolved around the sun.  Heracleides never quite advanced his theory to the point of entirely rejecting the geocentric conception of the universe. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the greatest of ancient astronomers was Aristarchus, who lived from c. 310 to 230 B.C.E.  Which of these facts is most associated with Aristarchus?", "correct": "He was the first astronomer to advance a heliocentric conception of the solar system", "options": ["He was the first astronomer to accurately measure the length of a year", "He was the first astronomer to suggest that all interstellar bodies are spherical", "He was the first astronomer to utilize geometric concepts to make astronomical measurements"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was the first astronomer to advance a heliocentric conception of the solar system.\n\n\tAristarchus of Samos was, along with Hipparchus, the greatest of the ancient Greek astronomers.  Through the use of scientific observation, he developed his sun-centered conception of the solar system about 1,800 years before Copernicus in 270 B.C.E.  Because of this, Aristarchus is sometimes referred to as the 'Copernicus of Antiquity'. Unfortunately, most intellects of the time scoffed at the notion that the Earth did not rest in the center of the universe, and in fact Aristarchus was threatened with charges of impiety for his stated observations. \n"}, {"text": "Aristarchus' contributions to astronomy were so significant, he really does deserve two separate questions.  With which of these astronomical measurements is Aristarchus associated?", "correct": "Distance from the Earth to the sun", "options": ["Distance from Earth to Jupiter", "Diameter of the solar system", "Length of time light takes to reach Earth from the sun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDistance from the Earth to the sun.\n\n\tRemarkably, Aristarchus made this measurement (the distance from the Earth to the sun) using only his naked eye.  His technique was sound, measuring the angle from the moon to the sun in the night sky to attain the distance of the sun to the Earth.  However, Aristarchus miscalculated the angle by about 2.5 degrees resulting in a vast error in his final measurement (he predicted that the sun was 19 times as distant to the Earth as the moon; the actual measure is about 397 times).  Nonetheless, this effort, along with relatively accurate efforts in measuring the diameter of the moon and its distance from the Earth helped spur even more astronomical curiosity. His influence on ancient astronomy must not be underestimated, despite the lack of belief in his heliocentric system. \n"}, {"text": "Another of the greats of the 3rd century B.C.E. was this man, whose greatest contribution to the astronomical science was his very accurate measurement of the Earth's diameter.  Who was this Alexandrian scientist?", "correct": "Eratosthenes", "options": ["Strato", "Erasistratus", "Strabo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEratosthenes.\n\n\tSome consider Eratosthenes (c. 276 - c. 194 B.C.E.) to be the greatest of ancient scientists.  His contribution to astronomy came mainly with his geometric calculations resulting in rather accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and diameter.  Eratosthenes was also a notable mathematician and geographer, and was the third librarian of the great library in Alexandria.  Like Empedocles, Eratosthenes was flamboyant and rather vain.  After losing his eyesight at an elderly age, he committed suicide by starving himself to death. \n"}, {"text": "In 240 B.C.E. the first known recording of Halley's comet was taken by astronomers of which culture?", "correct": "Chinese", "options": ["Mayan", "Egyptian", "Indian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChinese.\n\n\tThe Chinese were full active in recording stellar phenomena well into the 2nd millenium B.C.  The Chinese recording of Halley's comet comes fully 1700 years before German scientist Johannes M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigsberg, aka Regiomontanus, made the first scientific recording of the comet in the Western world.  Halley's comet is also observed on the Bayeux Tapestry, which documents events of 1066 A.D. \n"}, {"text": "It is most likely that which of these navigational instruments that utilize astronomical objects for measurement was first perfected by the Greeks in the 3rd century B.C.E.?", "correct": "Astrolabe", "options": ["Octant", "Sextant", "Orrery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAstrolabe.\n\n\tWhile the sextant and octant weren't developed until the 17th century A.D. (and the orrery not until the 18th century), the astrolabe is an navigational instrument of ancient origins.  The astrolabe was used to calculate latitude by use of the relative positions of the stars in the sky.  This marriage of astronomy with navigation allowed for much more accurate seafaring in the ancient world.  Some attribute the invention of the astrolabe to the great Hipparchus, though there is no proof that the instrument was of his design. \n"}, {"text": "Aside from Aristarchus, the other giant in the ancient world of astronomy was Hipparchus.  Where was Hipparchus active for most of his career as an astronomer?", "correct": "Rhodes", "options": ["Alexandria", "Croton", "Pergamum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRhodes.\n\n\tHipparchus helped erect the great observatory at Rhodes c. 150 B.C.E.  There he made his incredibly detailed observations of the night sky, which he, in turn, recorded in his now-famous catalogue of 850 stars.  This star catalogue was the most complete and detailed such document of ancient times.  Hipparchus lived from c. 190 to c. 120 B.C.E., dying at Rhodes. \n"}, {"text": "Hipparchus was involved in so many large astronomical projects that it might be good to ask a question about what a project with which he was NOT involved.  With which of these endeavors was Hipparchus not associated?", "correct": "The nature of the sun's light and heat", "options": ["Measurement of relative brightness of stars", "Calculation of the precession of the equinoxes", "Theory of the motion of planets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe nature of the sun's light and heat.\n\n\tHipparchus was a very busy man, not limiting himself merely to the study of astronomy.  He also involved himself with geometry and geography, and has been given the title 'Father of Trigonometry' for his extensive work in that field.  His best contributions to science arguably came in astronomy, however, in particular his accurate measure of the precession of the equinoxes and his theory of the motion of planets, which led to accurate predictions of eclipses. \n"}, {"text": "The greatest champion of Aristarchus' theoretical ideas was this man, who is also known for his theories on the nature of the Earth's tidal cycle.  What was his name?", "correct": "Seleucis", "options": ["Solon", "Proclus", "Euguertes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeleucis.\n\n\tSeleucis of Seleucia, who flourished around 150 B.C.E., was the greatest champion of Aristarchus' sun-centered theory in the ancient Greek world.  Unfortunately, he failed to win over a still skeptical public, including most scientists of the time that continued to dream of an Earth-centered cosmological scheme.  Seleucis' greatest contribution to astronomy was his correct prediction that the tidal cycle was related to the relative position of the moon and the Earth.\r Thank you for having tried this quiz.  I hope you enjoyed it and will try the others in this series (not to mention some of my other quizzes). \n"}]}
