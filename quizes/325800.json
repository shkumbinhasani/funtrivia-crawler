{"id": "325800", "name": "Ralph the Llama Visits the Cinema Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies Grab Bag", "Grab Bag - Average 10"], "questions": [{"text": "Imagine the surprise of Ralph the Llama went he went to the cinema to see what he thought was a religious epic and instead watched a classic British comedy that was co-produced by \"Ralph the Wonder Llama\".  Which 1975 film was allegedly directed by \"40 specially trained Ecuadorian mountain llamas\", among others?", "correct": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", "options": ["Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", "Ben Hur", "The Gods Must Be Crazy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\n\t\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" was a comic take on the legend of King Arthur and his quest to find the Holy Grail (which was the cup or dish used at the Last Supper of Jesus Christ).  The credits to \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" oddly enough were at the beginning of the film.  Besides the \"Ecuadorian mountain llamas\", the directors included \"6 Venezuelan red llamas, 142 Mexican whooping llamas, 14 north Chilean guanacos (closely related to the llama), Reg Llama of Brixton, 76,000 Battery llamas from 'Llama-Fresh' Farms Ltd. near Paraguay and Terry Gilliam & Terry Jones\".  Allegedly, the latter two had most of the creative power over the film.\r PDAZ had recommended this flick to Ralph. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph heard two boys talking about a film they had just seen, centered on a llama farm called World o' Wool.  Promising, he felt, and was appalled when he found out the subject matter of a film in which the action is triggered by a young woman running down a llama in the wilds of Texas.  What 1997 B-grade horror film did poor Ralph find himself watching?", "correct": "Barn of the Blood Llama", "options": ["Llamas, Anyone?", "The Llamas' Revenge", "Attack of the Killer Llamas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarn of the Blood Llama.\n\n\t\"Barn of the Blood Llama\" had the tagline 'A new look at bad animal husbandry', and is intended as a satire on the rural horror genre.  A family running a tourist trap, that they literally use to trap tourists, is the centre of the action, which involves a number of bizarre sub-plots.  The one that Ralph found most distressing (and looney_tunes agrees) involved an animal doctor conducting genetic experiments that turned the llamas into sex-starved toxic beasts.  This is definitely not a movie for the crias (young llamas)! \n"}, {"text": "Hoping to have a better cinema experience, Ralph was excited to see a break dance movie starring a relative of his.  The movie is 1984's \"Body Rock\".  Sadly the movie does not, in fact, star a relative nor do any camelids even appear in the film.  Who was the star of \"Body Rock\"?", "correct": "Lorenzo Lamas", "options": ["Al Paca", "Vic\"una\" Damone", "Stanley Kamel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLorenzo Lamas.\n\n\tIn case you missed this movie when it came out in 1984 (as deputygary did, despite his keen interest in break dancing) here is the plot:  Lorenzo Lamas, son of Fernando Lamas, starred as \"Chilly\" a regular break dancing virtuoso who is discovered by a club owner while performing with his friends on the streets of New York City. The club owner hires him to perform and Chilly becomes famous--and rich.  He becomes so rich and famous that he loses touch with his old friends from the streets and discovers that fame and fortune don't guarantee happiness.  The film has been described as \"Singing in the Rain\" without the love, talent and production numbers. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph's foray into the world of animated cinema was a good choice. Seating himself in theater #4, he watched a Disney movie set in Peru featuring David Spade as none other than a llama.  What 2000 film didn't go out of its way to glamorize the hard life of the llama, dethroned from his position as a country's leader?", "correct": "The Emperor's New Groove", "options": ["Atlantis: The Lost Empire", "The Great Llama Detective", "Lilo & Stitch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Emperor's New Groove.\n\n\tPopular with kids, adults, critics, and (we can only assume) llamas, \"The Emperor's New Groove\" hit theaters in 2000, starring David Spade, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, and Eartha Kitt.  Set in Peru, the film follows Kuzco, the Emperor, as he is accidentally transformed into a llama by Ysma who wants nothing more than his seat on the throne.  The film follows his journey home with a new companion, Pacha, as he learns lessons about selfishness, friendship, and himself.  The film, a box office success, was followed by the characteristic straight-to-video Disney sequel, \"Kronk's New Groove\", and the TV animated series, \"The Emperor's New School\".  So...many...llamas...\r Kyleisalive saw Ralph walk into the theater to see this one. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph settled down to watch one of the real feel-good movies of the 1970s.  His ears perked up when he heard the lyrics \"We go together like rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong remembered for ever like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom.\"  He was not too sure what language they were singing in but if it was about llamas, he wanted to know more about it.  What was the movie that Ralph was watching?", "correct": "Grease", "options": ["The Wiz", "Saturday Night Fever", "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrease.\n\n\tIn 1978 the movie \"Grease\" was the highest grossing movie of the year and set the record for the highest grossing musical, passing \"Sound of Music\".  Harking back to the more idyllic times of the 1950s, its catchy songs and story of young love was just what the movie-going public was looking for.  The lyrics to \"We Go Together\" are sung by the whole cast in the dramatic finale as everyone gets back together with the one they belonged with and all ends happily for ever after.\r maninmidohio was happy to recommend this movie to Ralph. \n"}, {"text": "How could Ralph resist a movie set in the Andes? But, as he sits back to watch the film \"Alive\", he realises that there are no llamas here, just a crashed plane and its survivors. Which of the following is one of the movie's significant themes?", "correct": "Cannibalism", "options": ["Tribal infighting", "Nuclear war", "Religious conversion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCannibalism.\n\n\t\"Alive\" was made in 1993 and starred Ethan Hawke with narration by John Malkovich. It tells the true story of the 1972 crash in which a Uruguayan rugby team was stranded high in the Argentinean Andes. Sixteen survivors were rescued after 72 days but not before they had taken the agonizing decision that their only chance of survival was to feed on the flesh of the victims. \r Ralph appears in this question courtesy of ROTL Productions and was personally directed by glendathecat. \n"}, {"text": "\"Is that a llama with a hammer?\"\n\nRalph got very frisky when he came across this quote but, on watching the movie in question, found his hopes dashed when it turned out to be an alpaca. From which of these movies was the quote taken?", "correct": "Evan Almighty", "options": ["The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers", "Adventures in Babysitting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvan Almighty.\n\n\tJoan Baxter: \"Is that a llama with a hammer?\"\rJordan Baxter: \"An alpaca. They rarely spit at people, unless frightened or abused.\"\r \"Evan Almighty\" (2007) was the sequel to \"Bruce Almighty\" and proclaimed itself to be \"a comedy of biblical proportions.\" This is entirely appropriate as the original pitch for the movie - God asks man to build large boat and save animals from a huge deluge of water - appears in the Old Testament book of Genesis. \r The team wishes to underline the fact that llamas and alpacas are mild-mannered in the face of humans and only spit under great duress much like glendathecat who, on this occasion, shared Ralph's popcorn. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph the Llama had heard about another movie about a llama and was really looking forward to seeing one of his own kind starring in his own movie.  He settled down to watch and at first noticed nothing amiss with all of the great shots of snow capped mountains, but he failed to see any llamas.  He finally realized he was watching a biographic picture of the Dalai Lama photographed in Tibet rather than his beloved Andes.  Making the best of it he really got caught up in the music and photography of this film that was directed by Martin Scorsese in 1997.  What was this four-time Oscar nominated movie?", "correct": "Kundun", "options": ["A Lama's Story", "Dreaming Lasha", "Seven Years in Tibet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKundun.\n\n\t\"Kundun\" means \"presence\" and is how the Dalai Lama is addressed.  Melissa Mathison, the writer of \"E.T.\", prepared the script from extensive personal interviews with the Dalai Lama.  Scorsese was brought in to direct and Phillip Glass produced a haunting electronic score that evokes life at the top of the world.  Cinematographer Roger Deakins gave the film the \"look of an illuminated manuscript\" (film critic Stephen Holden).  Although the film was not a financial success (probably hurt by the release earlier that year of \"Seven Years of Tibet\" which covered some of the same material), it certainly was a critical success and has stood the test of time.\r Ralph thanked maninmidohio for recommending this movie. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph chooses his next movie wisely.  He knows this one has animals in it because he saw the poster.  He saw a pig, a parrot, a dog, a monkey, Rex Harrison (the actor), and something that looked very much like a llama except for the fact that it had two heads.  The movie called it a pushmi-pullyu.  What movie features a pushmi-pullyu (and Rex Harrison)?", "correct": "Doctor Dolittle", "options": ["Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", "All Creatures Great and Small", "Llama of La Mancha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoctor Dolittle.\n\n\tThe book, \"Doctor Dolittle: Being the History of His Peculiar Life at Home and Astonishing Adventures in Foreign Parts Never Before Printed\", and its eleven sequels were all written by Hugh Lofting.  Doctor Dolittle has the strange ability to talk to animals.  As you might imagine, this is a positive boon to his work as a veterinarian.\r Working with so many animals greatly complicated production.  A goat ate the director's script.  Rex Harrison had to periodically be sprayed down due to the flies from the sheep.  Squirrels would eat the scenery.  And one production number was interrupted when the parrot yelled \"Cut!\"\r deputygary watched this movie in an attempt to learn how to tell his dog to quit chewing on his golf shoes--to no avail. \n"}, {"text": "Ralph sat back and reached for the popcorn, one of his favourite actresses was on next, Ms Dorothy Llamaour. Ah, Dorothy... she set his shaggy heart on fire. The only problem with Dorothy was that she was always messing around with a bunch of useless comedians, so he'd asked his big cousin in North Africa to take care of them if they caused any trouble. Wow, the movie had hardly started when his cousin the camel met Bob Hope and taught him a lesson that movies will never forget. So what did the camel do to Bob Hope on the \"Road to Morocco\"?", "correct": "It spat in his eye.", "options": ["It backed him into a pyramid.", "It trod on his foot.", "It pelted him with coconuts."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt spat in his eye.\n\n\tAs the film begins, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby hijack a camel and set off on the road to Morocco, where they meet Dorothy Lamour and have many silly adventures. However the camel didn't seem to have read the script and spat in Bob Hope's eye - the scene was so funny they left it in the movie and it is now probably the main thing that people remember. The movie also includes a talking camel who remarked \"this is the screwiest picture I've ever been in\" - sadly history does not record how many other movies had featured that camel.\r Camels are much bigger than llamas and so they are allowed to spit; when llamas spit it's usually because their team mates have got a lot more badges than they do. Flopsymopsy says that rabbits do not spit; rabbits who think they're llamas may be more easily provoked. \n"}]}
