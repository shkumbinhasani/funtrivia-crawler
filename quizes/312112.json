We are hoping that we will get to see Seilag. This mysterious aquatic beast lives in which Scottish lake?", "correct": "Loch Shiel", "options": ["Loch Lomond", "Lake Victoria", "Lake Baikal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoch Shiel.\n\n\tSince 1874, witnesses have claimed to see an unknown type of aquatic beast in Loch Shiel on the western coast of Scotland. While not as well known as the Loch Ness Monster, this cryptid has been witnessed by many people. It has been described as 70 ft long, gray in color and with multiple humps. Who know what else lies below the waters of the mysterious Scottish lakes? \n"}, {"text": "Next, we are hopping on a plane and going to Lake Simcoe in Canada. About 60 miles north of Toronto, this beautiful lake is home to an aquatic cryptid that the locals have named Igopogo. What Canadian province are we in?", "correct": "Ontario", "options": ["British Columbia", "Isle of Wight", "Nova Scotia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOntario.\n\n\tWe are in the beautiful province of Ontario. Igopogo got his name from his cousin Ogopogo, who is said to inhabit Lake Okanagan in British Columbia. He is usually described as being 12-15 ft long, with a canine type head, and a long neck. Some reports claim he basks in the sun and may have fins. There is some film footage and photos that claim to show images of this benign cryptid. \n"}, {"text": "Our next destination will be the Pacific Northwest area of the United States. We are going to search this tree-laden paradise for a bipedal ape-like creature known through-out the world as Bigfoot. He has many other names. Which of the following is another nickname for this famous cryptid?", "correct": "Old Yellow Top", "options": ["Old Red Top", "Old Blue Eyes", "ZZ Top"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOld Yellow Top.\n\n\tThe legend of Bigfoot existed before the European colonization of this vast and heavily forested area. There are many names for this beast including Sasquatch, Nuk-Luk, and Old Yellow Top. There are thousands who claim to have seen Bigfoot. There are also photographs, film footage and plaster casts of  footprints supporting this creatures existence. In this unforgiving landscape, who knows what might exist? \n"}, {"text": "Now, let's go to a warmer climate! We're hopping on a plane and flying to the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. We are hoping to see the infamous cryptid  that the locals call Chupacabra. He has a reputation of attacking livestock and then drinking their blood. What is the meaning of the name Chupacabra? ", "correct": "Goat sucker", "options": ["Butcher of the night", "Night spirit", "Evil demon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoat sucker.\n\n\tThe correct answer is goat sucker. Sightings of Chupacabra have slowly risen since the original reports in 1995. He has reportedly been sighted as far north as Maine, and as far south as Chile. He is usually seen in Latin American communities. Descriptions of the Chupacabra vary. He is usually described as reptilian in nature, with spines on his back. He supposedly has grayish-green scales and is usually described to be about 3-4 ft tall. Unlike some of our previous mystery animals, there is no film footage nor photos of him. All photographic evidence is the purported aftermath of his visit. \n"}, {"text": "While we are enjoying the heat, let's go to the Amazon Basin. We are going to look for a lesser known cryptid. While we are here, we will be searching for a creature that the locals have named Sucuri Gigante. It is said to have complete control over certain areas in the Amazon River and can make a meal out of any native species. What type of animal does this cryptid resemble? ", "correct": "snake", "options": ["bird", "fish", "alligator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsnake.\n\n\tSucuri Gigante is described as an enormous constrictor type snake. Cryptozoologists speculate that this could be a relative of Gigantophis, a very large, snake-like reptile from the Eocine period. In 1948 , the Brazilian newspaper \"The Diario\" claimed that local inhabitants caught a Sucuri Gigante that was 130 ft long and weighed over five tons. No swimming for me! \n"}, {"text": "Next, we are going to fly across the Pacific and go to Cambodia. We will be searching for a bovine-type animal that is said to live in the heavily wooded areas. Its name is Kting Voar, which translates into \"snake-eating cow\". What would be the greatest threat to any animal that lives in the forests of this Asian country?", "correct": "loss of habitat", "options": ["hunting", "tsunamis", "acid rain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nloss of habitat.\n\n\tThis mysterious animal causes a lot of disagreement between mainstream zoologists and cryptozoologists. There has been a lot of anecdotal proof put forward, but no actual DNA nor a dead body. If the Kting Voar is real, the mass deforestation of Cambodia and Vietnam will almost certainly cause its extinction, as well as many other confirmed indigenous species. Loss of habitat has always been a major cause of extinction. When will we ever learn? \n"}, {"text": "Let's take a cruise now to the Indonesian island of Flores. We are hoping to get to see a local cryptid described as a small humanoid. This humanoid is said to take food and even small children from local camps. What are we hoping to see?", "correct": "Ebu Gogo", "options": ["The Hobbit", "Emela-ntouka", "Skunk Ape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEbu Gogo.\n\n\tIf we get really lucky, we may see Ebu Gogo. What makes this creature so interesting is that, other than humans, there are no other primates known to live on this island (including monkeys). Also, in 2003, there was a discovery on the island of fossil remains of a new species, Homo Floresiensis. They are the remains of a one meter tall hominid that lived approximately 13,000 years ago. Does it still survive? It fits the description of Ebu Gogo! \n"}, {"text": "We are now going to Tasmania. We are going to try and gather proof that an animal last seen alive in 1936 may still exist in the wild. Photographs of this marsupial show an animal that looks like a canine with stripes on the back only. What animal are we hoping to discover is still alive? ", "correct": "Thylacine", "options": ["Pouakai", "Veo", "Dodo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThylacine.\n\n\tThe Thylacine is connected to a story of the atrocious behavior that humans are able to exhibit at times. This unique animal was systematically annihilated because it was known to eat the sheep that had been introduced by European settlers. Locals have been claiming for years to have seen the animal in the wild, but no physical proof has come forth. Let's hope the locals are right! \n"}, {"text": "In 1938, a strange fish was discovered off the continent of Africa. The coelecanth had been presumed extinct for many thousands of years, and was only known from fossil records. What is the name of the island group that is closely associated with this unusual cryptid?", "correct": "Comoros Islands", "options": ["The Lesser Antilles", "Falkland Islands", "Guam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComoros Islands.\n\n\tThe Comoros Islands are often called the home of the coelecanth. The vast majority of these unusual animals have been caught near these island located between Madagascar and Africa. This creature is included in the field of cryptozoology because it was a \"hidden animal\" for many years. It has existed since the cretaceous period without being known to the scientific community. Who knows what else lives undiscovered or unproven in depths of our oceans? \n"}, {"text": "The last stop on our trip will be in the heart of Africa. Here we will be looking for a mysterious beast that is best described as a giant bat. Do you know the name of this cryptid?", "correct": "Olitiau", "options": ["Hodag", "Orang Mawas", "Batman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOlitiau.\n\n\tEuropean settlers in the area claimed to have seen this animal flying above their settlements. It is reported to have a 6' to 10' wing span and sport 2\" teeth. In 1932, Scottish naturalist Ivan Sanderson claimed to have seen Olitau while he was on an expedition studying local fruit bats. Who knows what animals have yet to be discovered in the heart of Africa? \n"}]}
