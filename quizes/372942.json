They find, however, that May has disappeared.\rCol. Mustang's squad are all sent across the map or, worse, incapacitated in Central or working directly under the orders of Fuhrer King Bradley.  Fortunately, a note is left for him in his chess set.  He picks up Al and Ed for a drive, dropping them off at their destination, before visiting a woman named Madame Christmas who takes his note and connects him with Lt. General Grumman in the East.\rFu returns from dropping Maria Ross off in Xing and meets with Lan Fan.  Upon discovering her sacrifice, he refuses Automail as an option.  After they leave, Dr. Knox greeted by his wife and son who return after years of estrangement.\rIn Central, Kimblee is released from prison by Envy who plans to use him to seek out Scar and Dr. Marcoh who, as it turned out, escaped using the body of a chimera.  He hands over a new Philosopher Stone.  Scar and Dr. Marcoh, meanwhile, are found by May and they head off to collect Scar's brother's research notes...which he hid in the North. \n"}, {"text": "\"The F\u00fchrer's Son\" - What is the name of Fuhrer King Bradley's adopted son?", "correct": "Selim", "options": ["Rory", "Edward", "Matthew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSelim.\n\n\tMay heads north on the train from East City at the same time that Lt. General Grumman hops on a train to Central, bound to meet Col. Mustang.  Disguised as an elderly woman, he ends up rendezvousing in front of Hughes' grave.  Both worry that Central is causing more trouble than they know, and Grumman is excited to be involved.  \rScar, meanwhile, seems to head toward West City on another train while Kimblee, now working for Fuhrer King Bradley, hunts him down.  Fortunately, Scar is able to hop off the train with his companion, escaping and heading north.\rThe Elrics, meanwhile, search the Central Library for info on Alkahestry but find Major Armstrong instead, delivering a message from Col. Mustang's suggesting they head north.  He hands them a note, sending them to see The Northern Wall of Briggs, before Selim Bradley, the Fuhrer's son, appears, starstruck, and invites them home.  They have no choice but to go, finding themselves in the Fuhrer's company, before they advance northward. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Northern Wall of Briggs\" - Why doesn't Edward's Automail seem to work well in the North?", "correct": "Because it's made of steel", "options": ["Because it rusts in the snow", "Because it makes him nervous", "Because it's not attuned to the latitude"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause it's made of steel.\n\n\tIt doesn't take long for Kimblee to discover that Scar is heading northward, so he heads to Fort Briggs alone to intercept, leaping from his own train on the parallel track.  Kimblee finds Scar is traveling with Yoki, not Dr. Marcoh, and battle ensues.  Kimblee is speared, but splits them up by destroying the train's cars to ensure a rematch.\rMarcoh and May arrive at the northern mountain range near the border with Drachma on foot.  When they reach an abandoned cabin, the find the Ishvalan notebook buried in the floor.\rEdward and Alphonse reach North City in the snow but have to proceed by car and on foot to get to Fort Briggs.  When they do, however, they find themselves getting into battle on the way to the Northern Wall.  Additionally, Ed's Automail proves to be a problem since it's not made of an alloy that can withstand the cold.  The battle only ends when General Olivier Mira Armstrong, Major Armstrong's older sister and the 'Northern Wall of Briggs', the fort's commander, allows them to enter Briggs. \n"}, {"text": "\"Ice Queen\" - Which Homunculus breaks into Fort Briggs through the floor?", "correct": "Sloth", "options": ["Envy", "Wrath", "Greed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSloth.\n\n\tThe boys, discovering that they would need new Automail alloy to withstand the cold, consider asking to send for Winry, but first they need to speak to Armstrong who makes it clear she does not want them in the fort; they cause too much trouble running loose.  She does agree, however, that she wants to know the secrets of Alkahestry and use it as a weapon against enemies from the north.  In the meantime she puts them to work, introducing the Elrics to Miles, a man of Ishvalan decent, who has found a home devoid of discrimination in Fort Briggs.  He ends up reuniting them with Officer Falman who was moved up to the fort, promoted, and taken off his career track.\rFalman takes the boys on a tour of the Fort, bringing them to the large chambers below the upper offices where a mysterious noise is getting louder.  With the boys watching, a Homunculus breaks through the ground, insists he can't stop digging, and promptly falls asleep.  The Elrics can't seem to hold the Homunculus, who admits to being Sloth, from advancing when he awakens, and he breaks into the Development sector where General Armstrong tries (and fails) to hold him back with a tank. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Shape of This Country\" - The Elrics determine that the tunnels beneath Fort Briggs connect with others around Amestris to form a transmutation circle they first saw where?", "correct": "The Fifth Laboratory", "options": ["Central Library", "Fuhrer Bradley's Palace", "Resembool"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fifth Laboratory.\n\n\tGen. Armstrong, still fighting off Sloth, suggests that they cover the Homunculus in fuel and, using the tanks at their disposal, they force him into the elevator down to Gate 8 where, with one good push, they send him into the cold.  The fuel, vaporizing in the cold, freezes him solid.\rMiles is sent to the hospital to meet with Kimblee and warn him not to get in Fort Briggs' way.\rGeneral Raven, sent from Central, arrives in short time with a doctor.\rThe Elrics are sent underground with Gen. Armstrong and into the tunnels made below so that they will tell the whole truth to her.  They have no choice, and when they try to work out why Sloth was digging the tunnel it becomes apparent that it was dug in a giant circle.  Using a map, the boys determine that, along with Briggs, there are key points on a map which form the transmutation circle from the Fifth Laboratory, and the military from Central was involved in each conflict.  They hypothesize that General Hughes knew, and it was why he died.\rThere's little time to work out any more facts though-- Lt. Gen. Raven arrives at Fort Briggs seeking a meeting with Armstrong.  Cunningly, she is able to get him to spill the beans-- there's a possibility that she can be in on a plot to bring forth a league of immortal soldiers. \n"}, {"text": "\"Family Portrait\" - Who kills Lt. Gen. Raven during his visit to Fort Briggs?", "correct": "Gen. Armstrong", "options": ["Kimblee", "Edward", "Miles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGen. Armstrong\n\n\tIn Fort Briggs, Armstrong's men struggle as they search the tunnels beneath the mountains when a darkness envelops and kills them all in an instant.  In the fort, Armstrong is summoned down to investigate the goings-on.  Lt. Gen. Raven follows and advises her to seal Sloth into the tunnel and leave him be; she has no reason to stop things from going their natural course.\rThe Elrics cross paths with Kimblee before meeting General Raven in their cell.  He assures them that Armstrong is on 'their' side and, sure enough, Sloth goes back into the tunnel of his own volition to keep digging.\rWhile observing the concrete being laid over the hole to the tunnels, Lt. Gen. Raven is attacked by Armstrong; she cuts him in half and tosses him into the concrete to die.  Upon hearing the news, Kimblee seems fine that Raven is missing; it means he can act on his own accord since the Fuhrer has given him some reign.  Kimblee stops to have a word with the Elrics in their cell just as Winry arrives; Fuhrer King Bradley sent her up, presumably to remind the Elrics of his grip on their role in the plans.\rScar and Yoki reach May and Dr. Marcoh in the mountain cabin, but they have to leave since the Briggs soldiers know their location.  Meanwhile, in Central, Col. Mustang hears of the news in the North as Gen. Armstrong sends him a coded message through a flower vendor, later revealed to be another from the Armstrong family. \n"}, {"text": "\"The First Homunculus\" - Who claims to be the First Homunculus?", "correct": "Pride & Selim & Selim Bradley", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPride & Selim & Selim Bradley.\n\n\tKimblee ends up schmoozing a bit to keep up a front in front of Winry; it doesn't take much to appeal to her emotional side.  Ed tells her not to trust the man considering his past.\rA team is sent into the tunnel to locate the missing advance team who, at this point, have been gone for a week.  They give themselves twenty-four hours.  What they find is a massacre, and there are only two survivors.  This time, when the shadows advance to strike, they pull back at the last moment.\rIn Central, Mustang receives intel from Mrs. Armstrong asking for the Eastern Army to help up north.  Hawkeye, meanwhile, delivers papers to the Fuhrer and the shadows reach in for her; she discovers that it's Selim, the Fuhrer's son, who's related to the Fuhrer, but not his adopted mother.  Selim is a Homunculus-- the first-- Pride.  He warns Hawkeye not to tell anyone or he'll kill her from the shadows.\rKimblee tells Ed that he has three jobs from the Fuhrer for him: (1) Find Scar, (2) find Dr. Marcoh, and (3) carve a crest of blood in Fort Brigg, like in Ishval.  Kimblee offers Philosopher's Stone and and Al agree to do it, partly because they know they don't need the stone.  Winry makes an excuse to join them, and Kimblee, as they head off to find Scar. \n"}, {"text": "\"Conflict at Baschool\" - Baschool was formerly known for which industry?", "correct": "Mining", "options": ["Gambling", "Tourism", "Logging"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMining.\n\n\tHawkeye returns home feeling trapped, but she's just in time for a call from Col. Mustang.  Considering the recent events, she refuses to meet with him.\rEd, Al, Winry, Miles, and Kimblee reach the abandoned mining town of Baschool to search for Scar.  The Elrics manage to lose their guards (with Winry inside Al's armor), but the town is too big.  Fortunately, May finds them and Dr. Marcoh and Yoki emerge behind her.  The book of Alkahestry is revealed to the Elrics, but it's clear they need Scar to decode what's inside.\rScar, eventually, is found by Kimblee's men, both of whom are chimeras.  The Elrics fight them off despite their protests and they tell Scar he'll pay for what he did.  When the Ishvalan grabs his arm and finds out it can't be broken since it's not steel, Winry comes in with Miles and the others.  An explosion occurs and, before Kimblee can react outside, Ed reaches him to tell him the bad news: Scar has taken Winry hostage.\rMore than twenty-four hours after entering the tunnels, the door in Fort Briggs opens.  Outside, Gen. Armstrong watches the trucks roll in from Central. \n"}, {"text": "\"Daydream\" - Who suggests traveling to Fort Briggs via a series of tunnels?", "correct": "Yoki", "options": ["Scar", "Alphonse", "Miles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoki.\n\n\tAs it turns out, the Elrics are in on the charade.  Winry tried to save Scar's life just as Kimblee was told of his whereabouts, but a plan was put in motion to have Scar decode the notes, only if they spared him from his inevitable judgment.  Winry, already a hostage, offered to play the role of hostage to Scar instead.  Yoki suggested the mine tunnels, allowing Marcoh, Scar, May, Winry, and himself to head back to For Briggs (and safety) that way with two other 'hostages', Kimblee's chimeras who had a change of heart.\rFort Briggs, however, is no longer safe.  Gen. Armstrong is called to Central to speak to the Fuhrer directly.\rAl, realizing he needs to stop the others from getting back to the Fort, goes into the storm.  On the way though, he has a vision of himself and the door from the other side.  When he returns to Baschool in his right mind, he realizes that, perhaps, time is running out.  He's being rejected from his body. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Dwarf in the Flask\" - Who does Van Hohenheim use his healing powers to help?", "correct": "Izumi", "options": ["Col. Mustang", "Dr. Marcoh", "Scar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIzumi.\n\n\tGen. Armstrong arrives in Central, running into Mustang before visiting Fuhrer King Bradley.  She tells the truth that Raven spouted too much information to her too fast and she claims he did not deserve his spot in the hierarchy, so she plans to take his role.  The Fuhrer likes this response and gives her the position.  Fort Briggs will be taken over by his people, but Armstrong's team, unknown to him, still plans to work as one unit.\rMustang and Hawkeye talk over lunch, but using code so that she's not suspected by Pride's shadows.  Using said code, she conveys that Selim Bradley is a Homunculus, which comes as a shock to the Colonel.\r Father dreams of his past in which he used a slave, Van Hohenheim, to rise to power (literally, using his blood).  The King of Xerxes, seeking immortality, tried to use the dwarf in the flask (as the Homunculus was known) to give the information on the topic and, as a result, ended up digging irrigation trenches around the country to form a transmutation circle.  The King was tricked, however, and Van Hohenheim was placed at the center of the circle and granted immortality to himself and the Homunculus while all of Xerxes was destroyed.  The Homunculus returned from the other side nearly identical to Van Hohenheim, due to his DNA, explaining their similar appearances.\r Hohenheim awakens on a train and runs into the boys' teacher, Izumi.  The two of them walk together upon disembarking and, in an alleyway, he partially heals her, righting the wrongs caused when she tried to perform human transmutation.  He admits to her that he's a Philosopher's Stone in the form of a man, and it's the least he can do for the lessons she gave his sons. \n"}]}
