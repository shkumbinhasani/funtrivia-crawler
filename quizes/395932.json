Finishing sixth, she was later picked up by Cover Girl for a short ad stint and appeared in both the 2001 Rob Schneider film \"The Animal\" (which was far from a quality movie) and an episode of \"That '70s Show\".  She stopped acting the year after. \n"}, {"text": "Jerri Manthey, carving a niche for herself after appearing as the villain in \"The Australian Outback\", later appeared in the first season of what mid-2000s D-list celebrity reality show?", "correct": "The Surreal Life", "options": ["Battle of the Network TV Stars", "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!", "Dancing With the Stars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Surreal Life.\n\n\t\"The Surreal Life\" lasted four years, showing up on the WB network and VH1 before cancellation, but it ended up bringing with it a wave of lesser-known and forgotten celebrities who lived together in a house for a short time a la \"The Real World\", the long-running MTV reality show.  Manthey appeared with MC Hammer, Corey Feldman, and Emmanuel Lewis, amongst others. The show later featured celebrities such as Verne Troyer, Vanilla Ice, Flavor Flav, and Omarosa, if you need a bit more context.  Manthey was one of many who rode the wave of reality TV somebodies in the 2000s when the genre was getting its feet in a chaotic way. She returned to \"Survivor\" a handful of times, placing fourth in \"Heroes vs. Villains\". \n"}, {"text": "After appearing in \"The Australian Outback\", Elizabeth Filarski later found fame on what long-running daytime television show?", "correct": "The View", "options": ["The Chew", "The Young and the Restless", "Days of Our Lives"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe View.\n\n\tElizabeth, who would later marry NFL player Tim Hasselbeck, placed fourth in the show's sophomore season and two years later she found her way to the panel on \"The View\" which, in its sixth season at the time, was maintaining steady ratings.  She would go on to cohost for twelve years as one of the more right-leaning hosts, being a counterpoint to Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg, and others during her time there. She left the show to co-host \"Fox and Friends\" on the FOX News network and then retired in 2015, doing so in her late 30s.  During her time on \"The View\" she also co-wrote two cookbooks for those with celiac disease. \n"}, {"text": "\"Africa\" winner Ethan Zohn later founded a nonprofit organization involving which sport (for which he was a member of the U.S. league)?", "correct": "Soccer", "options": ["Basketball", "Baseball", "Cricket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSoccer.\n\n\tEthan Zohn, the million dollar winner from \"Africa\", used his experiences and talents to form Grassroots Soccer, a non-profit that would turn a focus on raising money for HIV/AIDS awareness in the 2000s and onward.  Zohn was its face for many years, though at the same time he seemed to suffer from that early reality TV era fame wave, also appearing on \"Fear Factor\" and \"Celebrity Paranormal Project\" on VH1.  He also appeared in ads for PETA, hosted the Discovery show \"Earth Tripping\", and became a member of the first team eliminated (along with fellow \"Survivor\" winner and ex-girlfriend Jenna Morasca) in \"The Amazing Race 19\".  He was a player in the USL Second Division throughout the 2000s. \n"}, {"text": "\"Marquesas\" contestant Rob Mariano appeared on \"Survivor\" four times before winning the million.

After Rob proposed to her during the live finale, CBS aired their wedding in 2005.  The couple would go on to compete in \"The Amazing Race 7\" (placing second) and \"The Amazing Race All-Stars\" (placing much lower).  Rob returned for \"Heroes and Villains\" and later won \"Survivor: Redemption Island\" in 2011. \n"}, {"text": "Following their time on \"Survivor\", which \"Amazon\" contestant formed a podcast about reality TV competitions, in turn winning awards for their work with the medium?", "correct": "Rob Cesternino", "options": ["Matthew von Ertfelda", "Alex Bell", "Roger Sexton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRob Cesternino.\n\n\tRob Cesternino quickly became somewhat of a game-master as reality TV continued to take off throughout the 2010s, positioning himself to be the go-to guy for reality TV goings on in the worlds of \"Survivor\", \"Big Brother\", and \"The Amazing Race\" with his releases of \"Rob Has a Podcast\" starting in 2010 (starting around season twenty of \"Survivor\").  He has since developed the podcast into somewhat of a network which has been celebrated in the industry with a number of podcasting awards.

While he never won the seasons he was on, the show opened him up to more appearances over time, eventually winding him up to be on other CBS reality programs. Rupert ran for a seat as Governor of Indiana in 2012 losing to Mike Pence, the eventual Vice President of the United States under Donald Trump.

Barry has also done robotics work as a hobby, appearing on the TV show \"Battlebots\" for a short time.  Dan Barry is one of the few people to perform spacewalks and certainly the first on \"Survivor\" to do so.  He was the second-oldest participant on the show in his season at the age of 52.  Interestingly, Rudy Bosch was the oldest contestant to that point, joining \"All-Stars' at the age of 75. \n"}, {"text": "Tamara Johnson-George, known as 'Taj' on \"Survivor: Tocantins\", was also a member of SWV, a 1990s group known for what genre of music?", "correct": "Gospel", "options": ["Dance", "Hard rock", "Rap"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGospel.\n\n\tSWV, or Sisters With Voices, formed in 1986 and found itself nominated for four Grammy Awards over time (and more than a dozen Billboard Awards).

Taj married footballer Eddie George, which was convenient when \"Survivor\" went looking for a football wife and brought her on for their eighteenth season.  She placed fourth. \n"}, {"text": "\"Survivor: Philippines\" contestant Lisa Whelchel is also known for being a star on what 1980s sitcom?", "correct": "The Facts of Life", "options": ["The Wonder Years", "Blossom", "Head of the Class"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Facts of Life.\n\n\tIn addition to playing Blair on \"The Facts of Life\" for all nine seasons of the show (from 1979 to 1988), Whelchel rose up through the entertainment industry starting her career at the age of 12 in \"The New Mickey Mouse Club\" during the 1970s.

Whelchel made it to the final Tribal Council in \"Survivor's\" twenty-fifth season, also winning the fan favourite award. \n"}]}
