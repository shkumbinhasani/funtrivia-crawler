{"id": "139923", "name": "Fungal Infections in Dogs Trivia Game | Dogs | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Dogs", "Dog Health"], "questions": [{"text": "A yeast infection in dogs is a type of fungal infection.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tYeast infections commonly affect the ears. Signs to look out for are shaking of the head and, sometimes, a sweet odor. \n"}, {"text": "What is the most common fungal infection in dogs?", "correct": "Ringworm", "options": ["Scabies", "Valley fever", "Mange"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRingworm.\n\n\tRingworm is a skin disease caused by any of four different fungi. The lesions on the dog's skin are hairless, itchy and round like a curled worm. Ringworm is usually treated by topical preparations like medicated shampoos. Ringworm is contagious to people, so avoid touching the lesions. \n"}, {"text": "This systemic fungal infection is most common in dogs that live close to water, as the organism grows best in wet, acidic  soils. In the U.S., the disease is found primarily in the Mid-Atlantic states and in areas along the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers. Symptoms include coughing, eye problems, skin lesions, and weight loss. ", "correct": "Blastomycosis", "options": ["Valley fever", "Cryptococcus", "Pityriasis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlastomycosis.\n\n\tBlastomycosis is most common in dogs that spend a lot of time in or near the water, such as retrievers. Up to 40% of dogs with blastomycosis will have eye lesions, and 85% will have lung lesions. Dogs often develop draining skin lesions that look like small abscesses. \n"}, {"text": "This fungal disease is often called \"Valley Fever.\" It is most common in the southwestern U.S. It prefers dry, alkaline soil. Symptoms of infection with this agent include respiratory disease with coughing and weight loss.  It also commonly affects the long bones such as the leg bones.", "correct": "Coccidiomycosis", "options": ["Histoplasmosis", "Malassezia infection", "Aspergillosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoccidiomycosis.\n\n\tCoccidiomycetes requires almost exactly the opposite conditions as Blastomycetes. Both are often misdiagnosed by veterinarians, as they \"masquerade\" as many diseases- especially cancer. Lesions caused by fungal infection resemble cancer in X-rays. \n"}, {"text": "Most commonly acquired from bird droppings, this fungal infection, like most other fungal infections, usually starts in the lungs. However, it also commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract, causing diarrhea, anemia, weight loss and internal bleeding.", "correct": "Histoplasmosis", "options": ["Coccidiomycosis", "Cryptococcus", "Zygomycosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHistoplasmosis.\n\n\tHistoplasmosis is often contracted from contact with large amounts of bird droppings, especially pigeon droppings. Bat guano can also spread histoplasmosis. Most dogs that contract histoplasmosis are outdoor dogs, although some indoor dogs have picked up the disease-presumably from manure-containing potting soil. \n"}, {"text": "Several breeds of dogs share a (presumably inherited) susceptibility to one type of fungal skin infection. Affected breeds include Maltese, several breeds of terriers, poodles, German shepherd dogs and Shetland sheepdogs. ", "correct": "Malassezia infection", "options": ["Ringworm", "Sporotrichosis", "Zygomycosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMalassezia infection.\n\n\tSymptoms of malassezia infection include itching, offensive odor, greasy skin, hair loss, red or black discoloration of the skin, and thickening of the skin. \n"}, {"text": "This fungal infection is most common in dogs with a compromised immune system. It is the most common fungal cause of neurological problems. Unlike other fungal infections, dogs with this disease usually do not have respiratory symptoms.", "correct": "Cryptococcus", "options": ["Aspergillosis", "Blastomycosis", "Histoplasmosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCryptococcus.\n\n\tAbout 75% of dogs with cryptococcal infection have neurological problems. Eye problems are also common. \n"}, {"text": "Fungal diseases are usually easy to diagnose.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tFungal diseases are often misdiagnosed. Many of their symptoms- weight loss, skin lesions, lameness, loss of appetite, fever- mimic those of other diseases. It is often difficult to get biopsy specimens that actually contain the causative organism. \n"}, {"text": "What is the most commonly used drug for treatment of systemic fungal infections in dogs?", "correct": "Ketoconazole", "options": ["Amphotericin B", "Griseofulvin", "Lufenuron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKetoconazole.\n\n\tAlthough all of these drugs are used for treating fungal infections, ketoconazole is the most commonly used. It is much cheaper than other drugs in its family (although it may be less effective.) The related drugs itraconazole and fluconazole are much more expensive, but may cause fewer side effects. However, their price is a barrier to usage- the cost of fluconazole, for example, for a Labrador Retriever-sized dog is about $1500.00 a month- and dogs with systemic fungal infections may need treatment for life! Ketoconazole may cause liver damage, so dogs receiving this medication should get blood tests every month or two. \n"}, {"text": "Most canine fungal infections can be transmitted to humans.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWith the exceptions of some skin infections such as ringworm, fungal infections are not contagious. \n"}]}
