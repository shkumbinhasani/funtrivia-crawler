Hence, in some of the lower rounds, interesting and odd picks would sometimes be made.  Which of these track-and-field stars was *not* chosen in an NBA draft?", "correct": "Dan O'Brian", "options": ["Bruce Jenner", "Carl Lewis", "Bob Beamon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDan O'Brian.\n\n\tThe famed long-jumper Bob Beamon was a 15th round pick of the Phoenix Suns in 1969.  Bruce Jenner, an unbelievable performer in the Olympic decathalon in 1976, was selected in the 7th round by the Kansas City Kings the following year.  Carl Lewis, well known for his multiple medals in several competitions during several Olympic competitions, was selected by the Chicago Bulls in 10th round of the 1984 draft.  None of them ever made the jump to the NBA (excuse the pun!) \n"}, {"text": "The name 'Celtics' was never used by a professional basketball team before it was adopted by the NBA team long famous for playing in Boston.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe first team to take the name Celtics were the New York Celtics, who formed in 1915.  After World War I, during which time the team disbanded, they added the word 'Original' before 'New York'.  The team finally disbanded in 1940, and were later enshrined collectively into the pro basketball hall-of-fame in 1959.

The team had been called the Bullets since 1963 when it had relocated to Baltimore, but owner Abe Pollen decided that sending a positive message held precedence over nostalgia and team history.  Given that Washington, D.C. is one of the most violent cities in the United States, perhaps they made a good decision. \n"}, {"text": "Magic Johnson retired from playing NBA basketball twice, both times in the 1990s.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOn November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced to the world that he was infected with the HIV-virus, and effectively retired from pro-basketball.

The Celtics picked Chuck Cooper out of Duquesne University in the 2nd round of the 1950 NBA draft.  Chuck Cooper began play with the Celtics in the 1950-51 season and played in the league until the 1955-56 season.  He averaged 6.7 points per game.

C. Jones", "Phil Jackson", "Chuck Daly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPat Riley.\n\n\tPat Riley established a trademark on the term 'three-peat' (which, supposedly, was originally the idea of Byron Scott) in 1988, after the Lakers had won their second straight title.  Riley was hoping that the Lakers would win again in 1989, and that he could then capitalize with the rush of merchandise that would bear the term. Unfortunately, they Lakers failed to win a third straight championship the following season, but the story still has a happy ending for Riley.  He has been able to capitalize successively on the fortunes of the Bulls (twice in the 90s) and the Lakers (early 2000s), as both teams 'three-peated'.  Apparently, Riley has been able to make mega-dough off of his clever idea. \n"}, {"text": "In perhaps one of the all-time most bizarre situations in NBA history, which former NBA player disappeared without a trace in 2002?", "correct": "Bison Dele", "options": ["Alvin Robertson", "Bobby Phills", "Jamie Watson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBison Dele.\n\n\tBison Dele, aka Brian Williams, former star of the Arizona Wildcats and several NBA teams (including Orlando, Denver and Detroit), disappeared without a trace along with his girlfriend (and a boat captain) from his boat near Tahiti.
