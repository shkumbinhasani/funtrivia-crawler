{"id": "247021", "name": "Hardest 'M*A*S*H' - 'Check-Up' Trivia Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Towards the beginning of the episode, Henry makes an announcement about the physicals all of the 4077th personnel must submit to.  He also makes an announcement about the movies for that evening.  Which of these 'monstrous' names is mentioned in one of the titles?", "correct": "Godzilla", "options": ["Dracula", "King Kong", "Frankenstein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGodzilla.\n\n\t'Godzilla and the Bobby Soxer' and 'Ma and Pa Kettle Have a Baby' are the two films for that evening.  Trouble is, not only was there never a movie with the title 'Godzilla and the Bobby Soxer', but in fact the original 'Godzilla' movie didn't come out until 1954, after the Korean War was over! \n"}, {"text": "In the mess tent, the enlisted men are given a thorough physical examination by the doctors.  What doctor gets stuck with 'turn your head and cough'?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Henry", "Hawkeye", "Trapper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tHawkeye and Trapper have already established their positions in the 'assembly line', and they give Frank the dirtiest job.  Most amusingly, Klinger is in line wearing on a skirt and a bra that is hanging from his shoulder. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye is the lucky winner in the 'who gets to examine Hot Lips' sweepsteaks.  Did he trade for this duty with Trapper?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNo way would Trapper do something so crazy!  Hawkeye is originally assigned to physically examine Hot Lips, and he's completely giddy about it. \n"}, {"text": "Who is scheduled to examine Trapper, only to have Trapper refuse to submit to the examination?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Henry", "Hot Lips"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tTrapper will not let Frank lay a finger on him.  'There's not a clean finger in the whole camp,' he claims.  Hawkeye is perplexed by Trapper's stubbornness, which becomes even more apparent when Trapper won't let anyone give him a check-up, not even his buddy Hawkeye. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye obviously relishes his opportunity to examine Hot Lips, and also manages to slip in a verbal barb that sticks in Margaret's craw.  What does Hawkeye say that clearly upsets her?", "correct": "She could lose about 10 pounds", "options": ["One eye is larger than the other", "She has fungus on her feet", "Her teeth are crooked"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe could lose about 10 pounds.\n\n\tIn another episode Hawkeye does find that Margaret has foot fungus, but in this one he makes it clear that she is a bit overweight.  He suggests that she 'stop grazing between meals', something that sets her steaming.  Frank later shows up, and is given the third degree about her 'fatness'.  He succeeds in pleasing Margaret by calling her 'full-bodied'. \n"}, {"text": "When Henry does his examination of Radar, we notice Radar in a rare moment without his shirt.  Even more unusual is the fact that Radar has a tattoo on his arm.  What is this a tattoo of?", "correct": "Anchor", "options": ["Heart with an arrow through it", "Teddy bear", "Eagle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnchor.\n\n\tRadar is known for two things in later episodes, modesty and innocence.  He is very self-conscious, and rarely likes to take his shirt off for people.  I suppose Henry giving him a check-up might be an exception.  A later episode of 'M*A*S*H' is entirely themed around Radar getting a tattoo, something that he chooses against in the end.  Perhaps he has selective amnesia in that episode? \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye finally confronts Trapper about his refusal to submit to a physical.  Trapper admits that he has a problem, specifically, an ulcer.  Where is this ulcer, according to Trap?", "correct": "Duodenum", "options": ["Stomach", "Ileum", "Cecum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuodenum.\n\n\tTrapper has been refusing alcohol and drinking antacid.  He is also suffering from severe heartburn.  His preliminary diagnosis is a duodenal ulcer, and sure enough, an x-ray confirms his suspicions. \n"}, {"text": "With his ulcer, Trapper is now free to go home, or so it would seem.  Later in the episode, Radar receives a communication about Trapper.  Where will he be sent for treatment?", "correct": "Tokyo General", "options": ["San Francisco", "21st Evac Hospital", "Seoul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTokyo General.\n\n\tTrapper will not be going home.  Rather, the army will send him to Tokyo General for several weeks of treatment, and then he will likely be assigned to another unit.  His only other option is to stay put at the 4077th and receive treatment there.  Guess which one he chooses? \n"}, {"text": "At Trapper's going away part at the end of the episode, he receives a number of gifts from the personnel at the 4077th.  What do the nurses get him?", "correct": "Pajama tops (but no bottoms)", "options": ["After shave lotion", "Wool cap", "Silver-plated razor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPajama tops (but no bottoms).\n\n\tSpecifically, the pajamas are 'all weather'.  They will give him the pajama bottoms only after he has returned to the U.S.  The enlisted men get Trapper matched bronzed cockroach cufflinks.  Those will come in handy at any social function! \n"}, {"text": "The hospital staff has also chipped in for a lovely parting gift.  It is a record album made by what famous entertainer?", "correct": "Sonja Henie", "options": ["Al Jolson", "Bob Hope", "Bette Davis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSonja Henie.\n\n\t'Sonja Henie Sings Figure Eights for You' is the title.  After the gift giving, Trapper makes the announcement that he has chosen to stay thanks to the army and its 'infinite insanity'.  He then proclaims, 'Milk is on me!'\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
