{"id": "366783", "name": "Alphabetical Horror Films - I Trivia Game | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Originally created as part of the J-Horror Theater collection, what 2004 Japanese horror film, set in a hospital, involved a weird black rash and a weirder green goo?", "correct": "Infection", "options": ["I C U", "Infirmary", "Internal Organs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInfection.\n\n\t\"Infection\", the first to be released from the six-year-long collection in 'J-Horror Theater', was made by Masayuki Ochiai, who directed the U.S. version of \"Shutter\" in 2008 (despite that originally being a Thai film).  \"Kansen\", as the movie was known in Japan, followed several doctors and nurses in a clearly understaffed, run-down hospital trying to deal with a mysterious illness and, eventually, their own delusions and hysteria.  When patients and workers started melting into a green goo, tensions ran high and the staff started to turn on each other. \n"}, {"text": "Before they were married, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. both starred in what teen slasher flick, about a fisherman with a hook in 1997?", "correct": "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "options": ["Invitation", "I Know Who Killed Me", "Identity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer.\n\n\tOne of the more well-known slashers of the time, the movie was meant to capitalize on the burgeoning teen slasher craze popularized by Wes Craven's \"Scream\".  In the movie, Gellar, Prinze Jr., Jennifer Love Hewitt and Ryan Phillippe, hit a guy in their car and, a year later, they discovered that someone knew their horrible secret.  Hewitt and Prinze Jr. returned for a sequel, \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\", a year later.  They didn't return for the third film. \n"}, {"text": "What 1980 Italian horror film was Dario Argento's sequel to the surreal classic \"Suspiria\"?", "correct": "Inferno", "options": ["Imago Mortis", "Imprint", "Island of the Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInferno.\n\n\tIntended as the second in Italian horror icon Dario Argento's 'Three Mothers' Trilogy, \"Inferno\" was made to represent Mater Tenebrarum, the Lady of Darkness (while \"Suspiria\" followed Mater Suspiriorum, the Lady of Sighs, and \"The Mother of Tears\" followed Mater Lachrymarum).  \"Inferno\" has been considered one of Argento's strongest works, though many of his later giallo films and retellings of classics have been regarded as a sharp drop-off for the director.  It took nearly thirty years before Argento released the third film in the trilogy starring his daughter, Asia Argento. \n"}, {"text": "What well-known alien movie from 1978 featured Leonard Nimoy and 'Pod People'?", "correct": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", "options": ["It's Alive!", "Isopods", "Infestation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\n\t\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was originally made in 1956 by Don Siegel.  A veiled, allusive film taking shots at the then-prominent Communist scare, the movie was lauded in the years after its release.  A bigger remake appeared in 1978 with Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy on the cast list; it has since been regarded as a classic, particularly because of the frightening closing scene, and been lauded as an exemplar of properly-executed remakes.  The film was remade yet again in the 2000s as \"The Invasion\" starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.  It did not fare quite as well. \n"}, {"text": "A young boy fell asleep and didn't wake up because he was pulled into a spirit realm called 'The Further' in what 2010 horror film directed by James Wan?", "correct": "Insidious", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsidious.\n\n\tOne of the most profitable horror films of the turn of the century, \"Insidious\" used terror and frightening circumstances to fuel its narrative instead of gore.  In the movie, a couple (Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson) had their world shaken when they moved into a new house and their son fell into a coma.  A series of supernatural occurrences forced them to move house, but they realized that the locations weren't haunted -- only their boy.  The movie was directed by James Wan, known for \"Saw\".  It was followed by a 'second chapter' in 2013.  Both were successful financially. \n"}, {"text": "Ti West directed what 2011 film, about a failing hotel, a haunting, and a psychic played by Kelly McGillis?", "correct": "The Innkeepers", "options": ["In Fear", "I Didn't Come Here to Die", "The Inherited"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Innkeepers.\n\n\tFollowing up on his critically-lauded \"House of the Devil\", \"The Innkeepers\" was written and directed by West.  This time he visited the common haunting trope, setting the film in a failing historic hotel.  Starring Sara Paxton and Pat Healy, the movie featured many scenes in which the protagonists decided to hunt specters through the halls of the Yankee Pedlar Inn.  What they found was more than they bargained for.  Much like West's previous films, it was a shining example of slow-burn horror. \n"}, {"text": "What 2006 French film was allegedly the inspiration for Bryan Bertino's home invasion movie \"The Strangers\" (2008)?", "correct": "Ils (Them)", "options": ["Into the Void", "Intimacy", "Irr\u00e9versible"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIls (Them).\n\n\tShot in Romania but filmed with a French cast, \"Ils\" put two people into a remote house in the woods and forced them to hide from vicious captors who set out to play a cruel, torturous game with them.  Unlike \"The Strangers\", released two years later in the United States\", \"Ils\" took its action further from the house, heightening the tension as the couple tried to make an escape.  Both films were praised for their dark, tense atmospheres though, ultimately, \"The Strangers\" made tons more money. \n"}, {"text": "What 1978 revenge film about an abused woman was banned in several countries due to its depicted violence against women?", "correct": "I Spit on Your Grave", "options": ["I, Victim", "I Sell the Dead", "I See Dead People"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI Spit on Your Grave.\n\n\tAs is the way with movies banned for questionable content, \"I Spit on Your Grave\" ended up attaining a rather large cult following despite the misogynistic overtones of the film.  In the film, a woman was beaten and sexually abused, only to enact vengeance, killing her attackers in increasingly graphic ways. The movie received a remake in 2010 which, after theatrical release, was popular enough to warrant a sequel a few years later.  Nonetheless, the original was banned in much of Europe, Australia, and Canada, only being released a few decades later, and in some cases with substantial censors and edits. \n"}, {"text": "\"A l'int\u00e9rieur\" was the original French name for what 2007 French extremity horror film?", "correct": "Inside", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nInside.\n\n\t\"A l'int\u00e9rieur\", released in 2007, was an odd case in that it was critically praised by modern critics despite being overtly graphic.  Part of the then-new wave of French Extremity, a subgenre categorized by extreme graphic content and gore, the movie was about a woman fleeing from the person who wanted to take her still-unborn child.  Premiering at Sitges, the film was later picked up for release in North America by Dimension Extreme.  It's considered one of the bloodiest of its kind, along with \"Martyrs\", \"Haute Tension\", and \"Frontier(e)s\". \n"}, {"text": "Sam Neill continuously found himself trapped in the town of Hobb's End in what 1995 John Carpenter film, the third in his 'Apocalypse Trilogy'?", "correct": "In the Mouth of Madness", "options": ["The Invisible", "I am Legend", "It Waits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness.\n\n\tEnding the trilogy started by \"The Thing\" and \"Prince of Darkness\", Carpenter placed Sam Neill into the lead role as an insurance investigator sent out to retrieve a missing manuscript.  As the story developed, however, he found the book in a town populated by horrible monsters, and all signs pointed to the end of the world.  Like the previous two films in the trilogy, the movie was left open-ended to an extent.  The same could be said for his \"Masters of Horror\" feature, \"Cigarette Burns\". \n"}]}
