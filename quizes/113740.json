The Sherlock Holmes Museum is actually situated between 237 and 241 Baker Street, further along the same stretch of road.For 15 years there was a dispute between Abbey National and the Holmes Museum for the right to receive mail addressed to \"221B Baker Street\". Since the closure of Abbey House in 2005, ownership of the address by the Holmes Museum has not been challenged despite it being as fictional as Holmes himself.\n"}, {"text": "Paris is full of lovely and interesting landmarks.

I think driving it is kind of a waste, you have to wait about 45 minutes to an hour on the average day, and it only takes about 2 minutes to drive down the darn thing!  I recommend to potential tourists that you walk to it, you'll get more satisfaction that way. Incidentally, a section of nearby Filbert Street, between the same two cross-streets (Hyde and Leavenworth) is the steepest street in the United States with a 32% grade! \n"}, {"text": "Film fans may be able to get the answer to this one.
