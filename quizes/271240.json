His boss immediately says no, claiming that there would be no air in the stalls.  After this, Mr. Steinbrenner takes notice of George's lunch, a calzone filled with cheese, pepperoni, and eggplant.  After tasting the dish, he orders the meeting to an end and he instructs George to get him some more eggplant calzones.\rElaine, meanwhile, tells Jerry that she will be having a date with a Todd Gack, who better her a dinner that Dustin Hoffman appeared in \"Star Wars\". \n"}, {"text": "What movie do Jerry and his girlfriend, Nicki, end up seeing at the theatre?", "correct": "Means to an End", "options": ["Chunnel", "Checkmate", "Blame it on the Rain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeans to an End.\n\n\tAs Elaine is leaving, Kramer comes into Jerry's apartment to rave about his latest idea: to wear all of his clothes, piping hot from the dryer.  Jerry finds the system illogical as Kramer will need to go to the basement to do his laundry every morning.  Meanwhile, George has lunch with Mr. Steinbrenner and discovers that his 'being there' will greatly impact the company as he ends up swaying his boss to put a lost and found in the stadium.\rJerry and his girlfriend, Nicki, end up running into Todd Gack and Elaine at the theater.  Jerry and Nicki say that they're going to see \"Means to an End\", but Elaine says that the tickets are sold out, so they're going to see \"Blame it on the Rain\".  Nicki ends up having a word with the manager and gets them tickets while Elaine tries to figure out how she did it. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Todd Gack end up picking up Cuban cigars?", "correct": "Montreal", "options": ["Toronto", "Kingston", "Havana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMontreal.\n\n\tBefore Jerry and Nicki see their movie, Todd Gack says that he's heading up to Montreal and that he can hook Jerry up with a box of Cuban cigars for real cheap.  Jerry says that if they're cheap, he'd enjoy some, so Todd says he'll give them to Elaine when he gets back.\rJerry and George have lunch the next day and George ends up mentioning the ideas that he's giving to his boss over calzones.  However, George finds he has a different problem.  Whenever he purchases the calzones for lunch, the cashier ends up turning away when he places the money in the tip jar.  When the cashier turns back around, he ends up giving him a look, as if George didn't give him any tips. \n"}, {"text": "Kramer's dryers only accept quarters.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhen Jerry returns home from his meal with George, he finds Kramer searching through piles of change on his table (since Kramer doesn't have a table of his own).  The reason for this is because Kramer wants to heat up another shirt, but to do that, he needs to pay a quarter for the dryer to work.\rSoon after, Elaine stops by and Jerry realizes that this Todd Gack may be sneakier than he seems.  He seems to have found a dating loophole in which he is not rejected for a date, yet he still gets one.  Jerry hypothesizes that Gack made up the obvious wrong answer to the \"Star Wars\" question, then took Elaine to dinner and a movie on purpose, then he offered Jerry the cigars, setting him and Elaine up on yet another date.  Elaine thinks the idea is crazy. \n"}, {"text": "According to Mr. Steinbrenner, why shouldn't George order Chinese for their lunch?", "correct": "Too messy", "options": ["Too greasy", "Too spicy", "Too expensive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToo messy.\n\n\tWhen George picks up more calzones for Mr. Steinbrenner, he ends up trying once again to tip the cashier, but the man turns away once again.  George decides to take back his dollar to try again, but the man catches him with his hand in the tip jar and bans him from the store.  When George returns to the office, he tells his boss that maybe they should order Chinese or eat corned beef for lunch the next day, but Mr. Steinbrenner insists saying that from 1972 to 1983, he had the same lunch every day, and that when he finds something he likes, he sticks with it.\rMeanwhile, Elaine has her second 'loophole date' with Todd Gack.  Elaine asks him if the bet thing was all a plan to get a date with her, but he maintains the idea that it was just a friendly thing.  Then, he asks if she wants to meet up on Saturday. \n"}, {"text": "Of which country are the cigars that Todd Gack gets for Jerry?", "correct": "Peru", "options": ["Columbia", "Jamaica", "Panama"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeru.\n\n\tWhile Elaine finishes her night with Todd Gack, Jerry exercises Nicki's powers of beauty by purposely speeding down a country road, getting pulled over, and avoiding paying a traffic ticket.\rWhen Jerry ends up bringing the cigars home with him, Kramer ends up telling him that they aren't Cubans; they're Peruvian cigars.  Jerry says he simply paid three hundred dollars for Todd Gack to have another date with Elaine.\rKramer is in Jerry's apartment in the first place because he's drying a shirt in his oven while a pie bakes in his own.  He states that there's more control.  He can cook it at the right amount of time, at the right temperature, for less cost, and at any time.\rMeanwhile, George is concerned with his job.  The lack of calzones coming to his boss may result in his exile from the company. \n"}, {"text": "Who does George ask to pick up calzones for him when he is banned from the restaurant?", "correct": "Newman", "options": ["Kramer", "Jerry", "Elaine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNewman.\n\n\tWhile cooking a pair of corduroy pants, Kramer ends up telling George that Newman raves about the calzone restaurant as it's on his mail route, so George stops by Newman's apartment for help.  Since it's on his route, George asks him if he can pick up two calzones daily for himself and his boss so that he can be in Steinbrenner's good books. Newman says he doesn't care for George, but he will help out as long as he gets a calzone, large soda, and a slice of pizza of his own (as well as a canoli three times a week) in exchange for the service, so George agrees, since it greatly benefits his position. \n"}, {"text": "Who do Elaine and Todd Gack end up having dinner with?", "correct": "Todd's parents", "options": ["Kramer", "Jerry and Nicki", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTodd's parents.\n\n\tWhen Elaine goes on his date with Todd Gack, he ends up revealing that he reserved a table for four so that he could have dinner with his parents as well.  Elaine is a bit creeped out by this because his parents constantly state that she's a great girl and that they seemingly 'approve' of her.  Elaine questions Todd's motives claiming that it isn't  'wonderful evening' anymore as they just had a date with his parents, but he says that he thought she'd enjoy them because they're good people.  He tries to kiss her at the door on the way out, but she pulls away surprised.\rMeanwhile, George goes to drop off the calzone money for the week only to discover that Newman is at home having called in sick since it's raining.  George immediately states that postal workers are supposed to work in rain, sleet, and snow, but Newman says he was never much for creeds. \n"}, {"text": "Why doesn't Kramer end up delivering calzones to George in the end of the episode?", "correct": "He tried to pay all in change", "options": ["He revealed he was doing it for George", "He snuck his jacket into their oven", "He insulted Italian culture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe tried to pay all in change.\n\n\tAfter discovering that Newman is not on his route, George decides to ask Kramer to get the calzones for him, and he agrees to do this.  However, Kramer dons a pair of cargo pants and walks down the street with all of his spare change that he was sorting through.  He ends up tripping and losing half of it on the sidewalk.  When he arrives, he orders three calzones and discovers that the restaurant has a rather large oven, so he decides to stick his jacket inside to dry it.  When the food is cooked, he finds that his jacket has burnt when it comes out.  He then tries to pay entirely in loose change, but the cashier doesn't accept it, saying that he needs real, paper money.\rMeanwhile, Jerry sends Nicki to speak to Todd Gack about the cigars since she has the powers of persuasion at her disposal. \n"}, {"text": "According to Todd Gack, what was Richard Nixon's middle name?", "correct": "Moe", "options": ["Maxwell", "Marlon", "Matthew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoe.\n\n\tElaine finds Nikki and Todd together at the coffee shop and she discovers that Todd is up to his old tricks again.  This time, he offers dinner to Nicki, pretending he thinks that Richard Nixon's middle name was Moe.  Elaine realizes that Jerry was right.  They end up smoking the Peruvian cigars as Todd and Nicki end up together in the end and he is unable to get out of paying for them.\rKramer stops in at George's office to say that he couldn't get the calzones because he wanted to pay in change.  He ends up tossing he burnt clothes into George's trash can as they're of no use to him anymore.  George notes that his clothes smell like the calzones, and decides to rush off to another Italian food place to get different calzones.  Meanwhile, Steinbrenner smells Kramer's clothes through the vents and rushes off to find his lunch.  He ends up tearing apart George's office to find the food.  When he discovers that the clothes made the smell, he gets the idea from George to place all of the players' uniforms into a large pizza oven before every game.\rKramer ends up using all of his loose change (in a large pillowsack) to pay for Jerry's expensive, yet disgusting cigars.  He seals the deal by throwing them at Todd Gack at his apartment. \n"}]}
