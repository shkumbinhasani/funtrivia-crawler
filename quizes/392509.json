{"id": "392509", "name": "Mist Opportunities Online Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games D-F", "Dead by Daylight"], "questions": [{"text": "Items that affect the thickness of Dark Mist are known by what name?", "correct": "Reagents", "options": ["Potio", "Draughts", "Unguents"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReagents.\n\n\tAlthough there is a base level for Dark Mist in each level, players (Survivors and Killers alike) can affect the levels using reagents of different types-- some rare than others-- and increase the amount of mist on the ground for their own purposes.  There are three reagents that can be used to thicken the mist: Faint Reagent, Hazy Reagent, and Murky Reagent.  These are common, uncommon, and rare items respectively when you find them on your Bloodweb, and each one increases the mist more and more. \n"}, {"text": "Can players stack items that affect Dark Mist in any match?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAll Reagents stack, so if more than one player uses the consumable Reagents at the start of a match, they will compound the effects of the items and make for a more dynamic map.  This means that, theoretically, all four Survivors and the Killer could make the stage more misty, greatly hindering the range of vision on the map and, very likely, altering the gameplay on both sides of the playing field. \n"}, {"text": "Can Dark Mist be found on maps that are set primarily indoors?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhile it may seem like Dark Mist should only, reasonably, form when you're on a map set out in the open air, indoor maps can be afflicted with this environmental hazard as well, so if you're playing on a stage like Lery's Memorial Institute or the Gideon Meat Plant (the latter of which is entirely set indoors), you can still bury yourself in the mist to your liking.  Because of the narrow corridors in both of these locations, hiding can be a bit easier for some; enhancing the mist is typically a greater priority when on a map with wide, open space. \n"}, {"text": "Players should still take every opportunity to play smart if the Dark Mist is present.  Which of these motions can be made to hide from the Killer which, likely, would be greatly enhanced by the mist?", "correct": "Crouching", "options": ["Using a flashlight", "Hiding in lockers", "Pallet dropping"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrouching.\n\n\tSurvivors don't have many options available to them when facing off against murderous Killers, and sometimes all you can rely on is stealthiness to get by.  Of all of the options listed, crouching is likely to be the only one that would take a benefit from enhanced Dark Mist levels because the others are either unaffected by Dark Mist or, alternatively, assist the Killer in locating you.  Using a flashlight will not be hindered by the mist and dropping a pallet will actually create noise that will alert the Killer. \n"}, {"text": "As a Killer, The Pig is greatly aided by the Dark Mist.  Why is this?", "correct": "Much of her approach involves stealth", "options": ["She can blow away the mist", "She can smell out Survivors", "Her items only function in misty areas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMuch of her approach involves stealth.\n\n\tThe Pig, based on Amanda Young from the \"Saw\" series, wears a pig mask and travels around the map enacting her cruel, torturous 'lessons' on unexpecting Survivors, mainly by crouching to reduce her chance of being tracked by players' senses and by dashing forward to slash them.  The Dark Mist is definitely favourable for strong Pig players because the obscured vision allows for the Killer to better conceal herself away (though it also helps that she's a smaller Killer as well).  It does, of course, work the other way around too since The Pig could lose the Survivors in the fog. \n"}, {"text": "Which Killer's items, when combined with Logwood Dye or a Tar Bottle, have a lesser chance of being spotted when shrouded in Dark Mist?", "correct": "The Trapper", "options": ["The Cannibal", "The Hag", "The Huntress"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Trapper.\n\n\tThe Trapper bases much of his mechanics around being able to catch prey in bear traps that he can place anywhere flat on the map, and when a Survivor accidentally steps in one he can go over and retrieve them, hopefully before they can be freed from its jaws.  Both Logwood Dye and Tar Bottles darken the traps so that in the right environment, they can be extremely difficult to see without a perk like Small Game in play.  In denser mist, they can be even harder to see, making them a very problematic element for a Survivor to contend with on a tough-to-navigate map. \n"}, {"text": "Which Killer, already stealthy by nature, is harder to locate in denser mist as a result, even if in somewhat plain sight?", "correct": "The Wraith", "options": ["The Hillbilly", "The Nightmare", "The Nurse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wraith.\n\n\tThe Wraith, with his Wailing Bell, already uses stealth to a significant advantage in the game because he can shift into and out of sight (though he can only attack when he has materialized).  Survivors can spot him even when cloaked, but only by noticing distinct movement around them.  In Dark Mist, because of the poor visibility, there's a natural benefit for the Killer. The Nightmare, similarly, is not visible to players on the surface (though they can see his movement in tall grass), but can be seen in the Dream World.  The Dark Mist does not affect much either way in this case, though it does carry over into the Dream World. \n"}, {"text": "What former customizable in-game element could somewhat counter an increase of Dark Mist by illuminating the map?", "correct": "Moonlight", "options": ["Fireflies", "Storm clouds", "Malaise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoonlight.\n\n\tWhile Reagents could be used to affect Dark Mist, players could also come across Bouquets in their Bloodwebs that had the ability to increase moonlight brightness on the battlefield though these were done away with in a 2017 patch, removing them from nearly all game modes.  And it's not hard to understand why. With an increase in maps set indoors, enhanced moonlight could be a sunk item for players.  While Dark Mist could be used anywhere, indoor moonlight wouldn't make sense.  It still exists in the 'Kill Your Friends' mode, however, in which you can play multiplayer against up to four people you know. \n"}, {"text": "Which perk will greatly benefit a Killer searching for Survivors in the Dark Mist due to its very nature?", "correct": "Whispers", "options": ["Agitation", "Enduring", "Beast of Prey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhispers.\n\n\tWhispers is an interesting perk in that it allows the Killer to sporadically hear the whispers of the Entity when in a specific tiered range of any nearby Survivors.  While this won't pinpoint the exact location of the prey, it does help when looking through Dark Mist, at least to verify that the Killer is on the right track.  It's also very useful when the Survivors are holed up in lockers nearby.  The other perks listed do not have much stake in environmental effects, so they would not be good counters to Reagent use. \n"}, {"text": "Is it possible for players to reduce Dark Mist on a map?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhile most of the Reagents found on the Bloodweb are used to increase the levels of Dark Mist found in any given stage, the commonly used Clear Reagent lessens the Dark Mist by 50%.  You could, theoretically, have five players using Clear Reagent in a game, reducing the base level of Dark Mist to about 3%.  It means that there's no point in looking for any mist at that point; the battleground is clearer than it's ever going to be.  Since this item stacks with the other Reagents, it could technically cancel out other players' mist-generating Reagents if played in tandem. \n"}]}
