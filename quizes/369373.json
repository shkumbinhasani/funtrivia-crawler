{"id": "369373", "name": "Video Games By Characters...For Beginners Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture", "Video Game Characters"], "questions": [{"text": "What video game series features Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle?", "correct": "Pokemon", "options": ["Animal Crossing", "Crash Bandicoot", "Kirby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPokemon.\n\n\t\"Pokemon\", since its release in the mid-to-late-'90s, became a cultural phenomenon that shaped the world of handheld gaming and further pushed Nintendo into a position of ubiquity in the video gaming world.  In the games, the point was always to catch Pokemon in 'Pokeballs', train them in battles, and travel around the world collecting badges to become a 'Pokemon Master'.  Little has been done to deviate from this typical pattern over the years, but the series still garners countless players, all aiming to catch 'em all.\r You'd probably know Pikachu out of all the rest; there are, after all, hundreds and hundreds of individual Pokemon. \n"}, {"text": "Inky, Clyde, Blinky, and Pinky all made appearances in what famous arcade game?", "correct": "Pac-Man", "options": ["Frogger", "Galaga", "Bubble Bobble"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPac-Man.\n\n\tInky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde all made supporting appearances in the \"Pac-Man\" series as the only enemies of the game.

Their Japanese names-- Oikake, Machibuse, Kimagure, and Otoboke-- translate to Chaser, Ambusher, Fickle, and Stupid. \n"}, {"text": "Playing as Master Chief would signify your involvement with what Xbox game series?", "correct": "Halo", "options": ["Gears of War", "Grand Theft Auto", "Crackdown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalo.\n\n\tSpartan-117, better known as Master Chief, is the protagonist of MOST of the \"Halo\" games (though there were a couple which did not feature the seemingly unstoppable cloned soldier).  Visiting a number of planets and planet-destroying rings across the galaxy, he has a tendency to be able to withstand rigors unfounded by any normal stretch of the imagination.\r The \"Halo\" games first started appearing on the original Xbox and the PC and have since grown to be one of Microsoft's leading franchises. \n"}, {"text": "Despite the name of the series, in which game would you take the role of Link?", "correct": "The Legend of Zelda", "options": ["Professor Layton and the Curious Village", "Final Fantasy", "Metroid Prime"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda.\n\n\tLink, a Hylian warrior who doesn't speak but wields a sword unlike any other, is the oft-green-clad hero of the \"Legend of Zelda\" series and has been since the original title's release on the NES console in the 1980s.
