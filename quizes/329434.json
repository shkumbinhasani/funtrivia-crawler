{"id": "329434", "name": "\"Bad Reputation\" Online Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "The episode begins with the kids watching a video of Sue Sylvester.  Who found the video?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Puck", "Quinn", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tKurt claims to have found it inside a locked cabinet of Sue Sylvester's office and the kids end up watching her sing and dance to the song \"Physical\" by Olivia Newton John in their classroom.  Both Jesse and Finn decide that putting the video onto Youtube is the most obvious decision to make.  By afternoon, the whole school knows about it and kids are making fun of it in the halls in front of Ms. Sylvester. She brings Will to Principal Figgins' office to reveal that one of the kids in Glee Club must have done it.  An additional piece of evidence: someone has been posting a 'Glist' around the school, a list of Glee Club kids ranked by their reputations and images within the school. Figgins agrees that this may have gone too far.  One of the kids in Glee had to have done it based on the library computer login information.  Figgins tells Will that he'll need to find out who did it and suspend them or else the entire club will need to be held responsible. \n"}, {"text": "Who is at the bottom of the 'Glist'?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Artie", "Brittany", "Tina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tWhile there are thirteen members of Glee Club, only nine kids appear on the 'Glist' with Rachel hitting the bottom slot with -5 points.  Will tells the kids that they're gaining a bad reputation and that while they're miffed about their social status since Sectionals, they shouldn't become the types of people they've disliked.  Will also gives the kids their assignment for the week: to find a song with a relatively bad reputation gained over years of wear and tear, salvage the good parts of it, and make it good again.\rTo demonstrate how it's done, Will performs Vanilla Ice's \"Ice Ice Baby\" with the kids taking moves from the original and working them into a good number. \n"}, {"text": "According to Kurt, what is the worst thing a McKinley student can do?", "correct": "Be a disruption in the library", "options": ["Eat in the cafeteria", "Become friends with Sue Sylvester", "Be seen with Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBe a disruption in the library.\n\n\tSue realizes that she's lost her fear edge in the staff room.  Upon entering the lounge for some coffee, she ends up becoming a laughing stock.  A new teacher, Brenda Castle, approaches her and states that she can no longer teach in Indiana because of her drug problems, but Sue is an embarrassment in comparison.  Rachel, meanwhile, is angry with her good reputation and decides to ask Artie for the AV Club's backing in order to make herself musically promiscuous and bring herself to the top of the 'Glist'.\rKurt, Tina, Mercedes, and Artie meet in the choir room to discuss their omission from the 'Glist' and decide that actions must be taken to avoid falling off the social radar.  Brittany, who inadvertently overhears their conversation (having sat in the choir room since first period after taking all her antibiotics for her cold) joins in to raise her reputation from fourth on the list to the top 3.  Kurt says that they need to create chaos in the library to rise through the ranks. \n"}, {"text": "When Sue decides to help someone else to make herself feel better, who does she decide to 'help'?", "correct": "Emma", "options": ["Quinn", "Rachel", "Will"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmma.\n\n\tSue speaks to her sister about her issues, particularly about the embarrassment and slow-motion laughter she's been receiving from everyone around the school.  Jean recommends helping someone in more need when she feels sad because there's always someone worse off in need of help.  Sue goes to Emma for this. Not to receive advice, but to give advice to Emma.  She reveals that she bribed Will's landlord to place baby monitors into his apartment and that he's been spending nights not only with Shelby Corcoran from Vocal Adrenaline (in \"Hell-O\") but April Rhodes as well (in \"Home\").  Sue tells Emma to stand up for herself and insults her before leaving. When the time comes, Sue brings Emma to the staff lounge, a public place, so that she can tell Will how she feels.  It turns out to be the worst possible time and she makes somewhat of a fool of herself, but the message gets across and says that she's through with him. \n"}, {"text": "Who does not perform \"U Can't Touch This\" in this episode?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Brittany", "Artie", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\tRachel invites Puck over to make a proposal.  To improve both of their images, she decides that he should play her male lead in her weekly project, this time a recreation of David Geddes' \"Run Joey Run\".  He's hesitant since he'd rather be making out and can't see the benefits of remaking an otherwise stupid song, but she convinces him to work on it with her.\rKurt, Tina, Mercedes, Artie, and Brittany head to the library wearing full MC Hammer garb (including parachute pants) to perform their impromptu and 'chaotic' rendition of Hammer's \"U Can't Touch This\".  While they do certainly cause a scene as per Kurt's scheme, the librarian isn't phased.  She actually claims to have enjoyed in and decides to speak to her pastor to get them to perform at her church. \n"}, {"text": "From where does Olivia Newton-John call Sue?", "correct": "Her limo", "options": ["Her luxurious mansion", "An autograph signing", "The set of a movie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer limo.\n\n\tWill interrogates all of the Glee kids one by one to get answers about the 'Glist' and he receives an array of different comments and excuses.  Some clearly could not have done it while some facts just don't correspond.  The MC Hammer kids decide that they need to take more rash actions to get a reputation; they need to confess to Sue that they posted the video and take a suspension.\rSue, meanwhile, realizes that her humiliation may have been karma and she decides that she needs to soften up her outward appearance to make things work.  Of course, that's the moment when Olivia Newton-John calls from her limo (while she's on her way to a benefit for orphaned koala bears) and decides that her video needs to be reworked as the original, one of the first music videos created, may have been the cause for the song's loss of popularity. \n"}, {"text": "During the recreation of the \"Physical\" music video, does Sue sing?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tKurt is the one to confess to Sue that they were the ones to post the \"Physical\" video on Youtube making her a laughing stock.  Sue, however, thanks him, leaving the kids kind of surprised by her reaction.  They all head to the choir room to figure out why and they discover that Sue has been collaborating with Olivia Newton-John herself to recreate the entire \"Physical\" music video as a modern duet, scene by scene, just like she did with \"Vogue\" (in \"The Power of Madonna\").  That's not the only re-imagining to surprise New Directions though... \n"}, {"text": "Who does not appear in Rachel's \"Run Joey Run\" video?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Finn", "Santana", "Jesse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tAs the week comes to an end the kids gather in the choir room to watch Rachel's song re-imagining, a project she feels will put her at the top of the 'Glist'.  None of the kids have stepped forward in regards to its creation, so they all need to take the heat of their punishment.  Rachel is eager because of this and starts her film (which opens with Brittany and Santana as angels).  Rachel and Puck begin the song together, but as the video goes on the boys discover that she switched her actors. Puck became Jesse who became Finn as the movie progressed.  All three boys were shocked by her deception and they figure that her reputation is more important than their friendships. \n"}, {"text": "Who posted the 'Glist' around the school?", "correct": "Quinn", "options": ["Jesse", "Tina", "Principal Figgins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn.\n\n\tSue heads to her sister's nursing home and informs her that she stood up in front of the other teachers and proved to them that she wasn't bothered by her laughing because the video made her more famous.  While Olivia Newton-John's share of the royalties would go to saving manatees, Sue's earnings would go to Jean's nursing home.\rWill brings Emma a bouquet of flowers for her office.  It's too much though; she can't bring herself to simply forgive him.  She says that if their relationship is ever going to work, they need to see each other for who they are.\rWill also discovers the true poster of the 'Glist'.  While she initially claims she didn't do it, Quinn eventually gives in.  Will states that any choices can bring you from the top of the list to the bottom.  She had the most to gain from the 'Glist' and she actually dropped the furthest.  Will assures her it's all okay and informs Figgin that the 'Glists' have stopped regardless, so they should chalk it up as a victory. \n"}, {"text": "With what song does the episode end?", "correct": "\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" by Bonnie Tyler", "options": ["\"Home\" from \"The Wiz\"", "\"One\" by U2", "\"Like a Prayer\" by Madonna"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" by Bonnie Tyler.\n\n\tJesse confronts Rachel.  Despite the fact that no one really knew who she was, she seemed trustworthy enough for him to switch schools and develop a relationship with.  Nonetheless, he clearly couldn't be enough for her and her desire to be popular won out in the end.  She broke his heart before he had the chance to break hers.\rThe episode ends with a final 'bad reputation' song.  Rachel leads into Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" in which Jesse, Puck, and Finn all sing back-up vocals.  As her performance, both in the choir room and the ballet studio, comes to a close, she is left alone and is forced to come to terms with the consequences of her actions and her own attempts to garner a bad reputation. \n"}]}
