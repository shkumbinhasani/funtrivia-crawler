{"id": "390269", "name": "\"The Lost Sister\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stranger Things"], "questions": [{"text": "Eleven believes she must find a girl from her mother's memories.  The girl is seen in a room marked with which symbol?", "correct": "Rainbow", "options": ["Sunflower", "Sun", "Lightning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRainbow.\n\n\tIn the blackness, Eleven saw her mother's final memories, looping through her mind on constant repeat and affecting her mental capacity in the real world.  She tells her aunt, Becky, about the truth, pinpointing the appearance of a second girl in the room in the lab marked by a rainbow, a girl that was different from her.  Because of this, she thinks her mother wants her to find the girl to find the answers she needs.  The two of them go through the files in the house, many of which contain articles about missing children (like Jane), and she ends up finding a page about a missing Indian girl from London.  It's her.\rThe television is set to static again as Eleven goes into the blackness to search for the girl, but she can't find her. \n"}, {"text": "Eleven, seeking answers about the mysterious girl from her mother's memories, travels to which city?", "correct": "Chicago", "options": ["Indianapolis", "Detroit", "St. Paul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChicago.\n\n\tThat night, Eleven dreams of the Indian girl, finding herself in the darkness and spying the girl next to a flaming barrel of trash.  When she awakens, she rushes to tell Becky but finds her aunt on the phone outside the kitchen, calling to try and get a hold of Detective Hopper.  This, of course, means that Eleven can't hang around since others can get the info.  Becky finds that her purse has been looted and Eleven is gone.\rEleven ends up on a bus, and during her trip to Chicago, Illinois, she tries her best to locate the girl.  Her intuition leads her to the seedy back alleys of the city until, eventually, she comes across a warehouse and lets herself inside.  Sure enough, it's the right place. \n"}, {"text": "What number appears on Kali's wrist?", "correct": "008", "options": ["012", "100", "011"], "explanation": "\n\n\n008.\n\n\tEleven wastes no time in approaching the gang huddled around a flaming barrel in the warehouse.  They start to give her trouble, but the girl they refer to as Kali intervenes, stepping forward to ask Eleven some questions, chiefly 'who is she?' and 'why is she there?'  When Eleven reveals that she has a picture of her, the two compare their number tattoos.  Jane is, of course, 'Eleven'; Kali, as it would seem, is 'Eight'.\rThrough the night, Eleven gives Kali the whole story and Kali reveals her power-- she can convince people that they can see things that don't exist. \n"}, {"text": "Kali informs her gang that she plans to use Eleven's powers to their benefit.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tKali allows Eleven to stay with the group because, as she says, she feels whole now, as though a missing piece has come back into place.  She thinks Jane's mother sent her for a reason, and she may have found her way home.  After Eleven goes to sleep, Kali tells the others that she found them with nothing more than a picture, so they'll gather their things and head out for another job the next day, even though the cops are already looking for them, because they need to test her abilities.\rThat night, Eleven finds herself in the blackness and listens to Hopper's apology on the radio transmission.  A hand grabs her and wakes her from the dream.  It's Kali waking her; she's slept in. \n"}, {"text": "Besides Kali, how many other outcasts are a part of the group Eleven meets?", "correct": "Four & 4", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour & 4.\n\n\tKali introduces Jane to the rest of the group.  There's Axel, with the mohawk; there's Dottie, who's recently left home; there's Mick, who keeps an eye out for the group; and there's Funshine, their warrior.  All of them are outcasts; society left them behind and discarded them, so they grouped up under Kali's leadership.  They reveal that they're set on bringing down all of the men who wronged them but getting to them and killing them.\rKali takes Eleven out on her own and says that confronting her pain will allow her to heal.  Kali asks her to pull an entire train car towards them, down the road, and Eleven is unable to do so with her mind, straining due to its weight.  When Kali tells her to tap into her anger though, she's able. \n"}, {"text": "Eleven recognizes one of Kali's targets.  What is that man's name?", "correct": "Ray", "options": ["Mitch", "Matthew", "Dennis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRay.\n\n\tKali shows Eleven the photos of the bad men who are still out there, insisting that many are still alive.  She remembers one by his picture because she saw him in her mother's memory, and Kali confirms that he hurt her as well.  Unfortunately, he's gone missing because he knows how dangerous their types are. The others give Eleven the blindfold and static she needs to go into the blackness and she finds them the address; it's an hour east.  They get their things and decide to give Eleven a memorable first time, leaving in their van after giving her a needed makeover.  On the way out of the city, a cop notices their van. \n"}, {"text": "Eleven and the gang rob which of these during their excursion?", "correct": "Gas station", "options": ["Radio Shack", "Bank", "Apartment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGas station.\n\n\tThe group stops off at a gas station to rob some supplies and the event goes off with a few hitches.  Notably, Eleven is forced to attack the man behind the counter when a gun is pulled on Kali.  That night, they arrive at Ray's place and don their masks.  Eleven unlocks the chain on the door with her mind before they ambush him and force him to sit down. While Axel and Dottie steal from the guy's bedroom, Eleven and Kali reveal themselves and attack the former scientist.  Ray begs for his life, saying that he can help them find Brenner, Eleven's father, even though Eleven is certain that he's dead. \n"}, {"text": "Although Eleven doesn't murder the former scientist she goes to see, Kali does.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tEleven starts to strangle Ray with her mind, egged on by Kali's reminders of what he did to them and her mother.  She has to stop though because she realizes that he has two daughters.  Sure enough, Axel and Dottie find the children in their bedroom, and they've called the police already.  Kali continues to provoke Eleven, but when it's clear they're almost out of time, Kali pulls a gun. Eleven has no choice but to use her powers to throw the gun from her hands.  They flee before the cops can get them and return to their warehouse.  On the way, Kali tells her never to take the mercy from her ever again. \n"}, {"text": "When did Kali leave the lab?", "correct": "When her powers were strong enough", "options": ["When she was smuggled out", "When she was freed", "When she was transferred to another facility"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen her powers were strong enough.\n\n\tAt the warehouse, Kali speaks to Eleven privately, saying that she's hard on her because she sees herself in her, and doesn't want her to fall into the same traps she did when she was merciful in her early days hunting the scientists.  Kali remembers when she went to the rainbow room and Eleven never showed back up.  Her powers grew and she escaped.  Eventually, she had nowhere to go, so she had to use her gifts to fight back.  Eleven says that she believes their father is still dead, but Kali uses her powers to bring his image to them.  She assures Eleven that she's free to leave when she wants, but if she stays they can fight together.\rThat's when the police start to drive up.  Mick doesn't notice the armed men entering the building. \n"}, {"text": "The cops eventually find Kali's gang.  Does Eleven join them in their escape?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tEleven, longing for her friends back in Hawkins, shifts back into the blackness to find Hopper in front of a control panel, still in the lab.  She sees as Mike struggles to inform the others that they're in a trap.  When he disappears, all she hears is the banging of a metal door behind her.  Kali has to grab her and bring her upstairs where, with the others all together, she's able to use her powers and hide them from the cops even though they're standing in the middle of the room.  They're able to make it out to the van and return fire and Kali uses her powers to form a barricade.  As the group files into the vehicle, Jane stays behind.  She can't stay with Kali, even though her mother sent her to Chicago, because she knows her friends need her help.  Eleven runs down a nearby alley as Kali and her crew ride off into the night.\rBefore long, Eleven is already back on a bus to Indiana.   Another passenger asks where she's off to; she's headed back to Indiana and her friends. \n"}]}
