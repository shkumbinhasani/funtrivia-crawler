{"id": "225620", "name": "Super Smashing Differences Multiple Choice Quiz | Super Smash Brothers Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games Q-S", "Super Smash Brothers Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Which character that once needed to be unlocked (in \"Super Smash Bros.\") still needs to be unlocked the same way in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\"?", "correct": "Jigglypuff", "options": ["Ness", "Captain Falcon", "Luigi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJigglypuff.\n\n\tThere are only four unlockable characters in the original \"Super Smash Bros.\", but there is more than triple the amount of unlockable characters in the sequel.  To get Jigglypuff in both games, you simply need to beat the one player mode without losing all of your lives.  None of the unlockable characters in \"Super Smash Bros.Melee\" (excluding Jigglypuff and Luigi) were in the previous game.  Although Jigglypuff is often referred to as a weak character (which is further proven by the fact that she's so easy to unlock), some of her moves, like Rest, are best used in event matches; especially the final event. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Super Smash Bros.\", players can fight Master Hand at the end of the single player adventure.  What is the name of the second hand in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\"?", "correct": "Crazy Hand", "options": ["Left Hand", "Right Hand", "Mad Hand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrazy Hand.\n\n\tCrazy Hand is an odd character.  Although you normally just fight Master Hand during Classic 1-P Mode of \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" (or 1-P Mode of \"Super Smash Bros.\"), Crazy Hand may also make an appearance if you are at a high enough difficulty.  Crazy Hand has a few different moves, but a few can also be used in conjunction with Master Hand.  Both of these appendages appeared in the Game Boy Advance game \"Kirby and the Amazing Mirror\" as bosses.  Both characters can also be played against in the penultimate Event Match of \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\". \n"}, {"text": "When you play \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" for the first time, you'll have fourteen playable characters.  How many characters are initially available in \"Super Smash Bros.\"?", "correct": "Eight", "options": ["Twelve", "Ten", "Fourteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight.\n\n\tThe eight starting characters are Donkey Kong, Mario, Fox, Kirby, Link, Pikachu, Samus, and Yoshi.  All of these characters are also available when you first begin \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\".  Two secret characters in the first game become original characters in the sequel (Ness and Captain Falcon), and Bowser, Princess Peach, Zelda, and Ice Climbers were added to the default gang. \n"}, {"text": "The \"Break the Targets\" test is in both games.  Is the \"Home Run Contest\" minigame found in both games as well?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe Sandbag is only found in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" and it's used to unlock a new stage.  The best way to complete the task is by using Yoshi's flutter kick to raise the percentage of the Sandbag's health to over 100%.  Then, pick up the Home Run Bat and knock it out of the park.  To get the stage, you need a distance of at least 1,350 ft.  You can also get the Sandbag Trophy at a shorter distance. \n"}, {"text": "Which of Ness' moves was introduced in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\"?", "correct": "PK Flash", "options": ["PK Thunder", "PK Fire", "PK Shield"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPK Flash.\n\n\tNess is one of the only characters in the game to have an attack change.  In \"Super Smash Bros.\", the PK Fire attack was assigned to the B button, PK Tunder was assigned to Up-B, and PK Shield was the Down-B attack.  In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", PK Fire was movce to Left-B and Right-B while PK Flash took its old position as the basic B attack.  When you use this move, it will arc over Ness' head and burst.  If you hold the B button, it will go a bit lower, but it'll become more powerful. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", you can unlock past stages which were used in \"Super Smash Bros.\".  Which is not one of these unlockable stages?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Stadium", "options": ["Yoshi's Island", "Kongo Jungle", "Dream Land"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium.\n\n\tPok\u00e9mon Stadium is not an unlockable stage, and it was never in \"Super Smash Bros. (N64)\".  The other three choices (Kongo Jungle, Dream Land, and Yoshi's Island) are the only unlockable Past Stages in the game.  In the original \"Super Smash Bros.\", the only Pok\u00e9mon-based level was Saffron City, but in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", you can play in Pok\u00e9mon Stadium, or the unlockable Pok\u00e9 Floats level.  To unlock this stage, you need to play two hundred multiplayer matches. \n"}, {"text": "There are some stages from both \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" that aren't unlockable Past Stages.  Which is not one of these?\n(Watch out!  Some have different names although they're the same level.)", "correct": "Hyrule Castle", "options": ["Brinstar", "Princess Peach's Castle", "Corneria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyrule Castle.\n\n\tHyrule Castle is only found in \"Super Smash Bros. (N64)\".  In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", the \"Legend of Zelda\"-themed levels are Hyrule Temple and Great Bay.  Princess Peach's Castle is basically the same in both games although Brinstar was known as Planet Zebes in the first \"Super Smash Bros.\".  In \"Super Smash Bros.Melee\", Brinstar returns as well as a \"Metroid\" stage called Brinstar Depths, which can be unlocked after playing fifty full multiplayer matches.  Corneria is from the \"Star Fox\" series, and it was called Sector Z in the original \"Super Smash Bros.\".  The second \"Star Fox\" level in \"Super Smash Bros.Melee\" is Venom. \n"}, {"text": "Which item from \"Super Smash Bros.\" did not reappear in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\"?", "correct": "Bumper", "options": ["Hammer", "Fire Flower", "Heart Container"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBumper.\n\n\tThe Bumper is the only object that never returned in the second \"Super Smash Bros.\" game, but all is not lost!  This object was replaced by the Flipper.  Sure, it only does 1% of damage, but it's a good obstacle for any player.  Many items were added to \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" including the Freezie, Barrel Cannon, Warp Star, Parasol, and more. \n"}, {"text": "Which Pok\u00e9mon did not come out of a Pok\u00e9ball in both \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\"?", "correct": "Onix", "options": ["Blastoise", "Clefairy", "Chansey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnix.\n\n\tMany random Pok\u00e9mon in \"Super Smash Bros.\" were switched around quite a bit.  Many never returned for a second game such as Onix, Meowth, Beedrill, Koffing, Hitmonlee, and Starmie, but some returned.  In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", there are twenty-nine different Pok\u00e9mon that can randomly appear when you throw a Pok\u00e9ball.  These can range from the literally useless Goldeen, to the three legendary birds.  Of course, you don't need Pok\u00e9balls to see some Pok\u00e9mon; you could always play as Pikachu, Pichu, Mewtwo, or Jigglypuff. \n"}, {"text": "Was the \"Race To The Finish\" mini-game in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\"?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\t\"Race To The Finish\" was in both \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" although they weren't the same in both games.  In \"Super Smash Bros.\", \"Race To The Finish\" contained fighting polygons.  In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", \"Race To The Finish\" was just one long obstacle course with many paths and many doors.  You could go through a door at any time, but the further you went, the more points you'd earn.  You could also find trophies on the course. \n"}]}
