Which of these is not a Warrior attribute?", "correct": "Leadership", "options": ["Swordsmanship", "Tactics", "Axe Mastery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeadership.\n\n\tAlthough Swordsmanship, Axe Mastery, and Tactics are Warrior attributes, Leadership is an attribute used by the \"Nightfall\" profession, the Paragon.  Along with those three attributes, Warriors have the Hammer Mastery attribute and the Strength primary attribute which will add armor penetration for every point added to its total.  In the game, Warriors are often referred to as 'Tanks' due to their immense defensive strength and their armor-shattering offense. \n"}, {"text": "One popular attribute for Rangers is Beast Mastery.  In which \"Guild Wars\" title can a Ranger charm a tiger?", "correct": "Factions", "options": ["Nightfall", "Prophecies", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFactions.\n\n\tThe Ranger is a popular ranged-attack character because they often use bows to attack enemies from afar.  The Marksmanship attribute and primary attribute, Expertise will allow the Ranger to strengthen their bow and arrow skills.  Along with these and the Beast Mastery attributes, a Ranger can also use Wilderness Survival spells which can create traps and start rituals.  Rangers can often interrupt enemy attacks and 'Barrage Rangers' are commonly found in the game.  These often use Elementalists or Monks as a secondary profession. \n"}, {"text": "The Monk is the healing profession, there's no way around it.  What is the name of the Monk's primary attribute?", "correct": "Divine Favor", "options": ["Energy Storage", "Fast Casting", "Mysticism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDivine Favor.\n\n\tMonks are characters that every party will be searching for.  Quite simply, the Monk is what keeps the party going, and without one, teams will have a hard time resurrecting or healing party members.  Secondary attributes for the Monk include Healing Prayers, Protective Prayers, and Smiting Prayers.  Divine Favor, the primary attribute, will allow a Monk to heal allies much more effectively. Famous Monks include Brother Mhenlo and Danika of the Kurzicks.  Players often hear about the 55 Monk as well.  It only has 55HP, but due to the way that the character is built, it survives easily in battle. \n"}, {"text": "Necromancers are a popular character in the game due to the fact that they can raise the dead.  Which is not a minion that they can 'animate'?", "correct": "Flash Demon", "options": ["Flesh Golem", "Bone Fiend", "Vampiric Horror"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlash Demon.\n\n\tThe Necromancer is often sought after for the fact that they can be a Minion Master (often abbreviated to MM) and because of this, they can use large groups of undead allies to attack an enemy.  Necromancers can also use Blood Magic to steal enemy health and help their party (including minions).  The Death Magic and (primary) Soul Reaping attributes both assist the Necromancer with these skills. \n"}, {"text": "What is the Mesmer primary attribute?", "correct": "Fast Casting", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFast Casting.\n\n\tMesmers are odd characters, often using magic to change a situation to their liking.  Using hexes, spells, enchantments, and other magic, Mesmers can interrupt opponents, remove status effects and more.  Next to the Fast Casting technique, Mesmers use Domination, Illusion, and Inspiration Magic to inflict damage or prevent damage from foes. \n"}, {"text": "The Elementalists uses the power of the elements to cast magic spells.  Is the Elementalist the only profession with four secondary attributes?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe Elementalist uses the Energy Storage attribute to increase total energy by three points per skill.  Along with this, players can choose one of four secondary professions relating to Fire, Water, Earth, and Air Magic.  Each of these involve their own spells and powers that affect different enemies.  The Fire Elementalist (also known as Pyromancer) is the most common due to its strength. Fire Elementalists are also called Nukers in the game due to their catastrophic blows with Meteor, Meteor Shower, and Fire Storm skills.  The Warrior is the only other profession with four secondary skills. \n"}, {"text": "The Assassin was the first of two new professions in \"Guild Wars: Factions\".  Which of these henchmen is an Assassin?", "correct": "Nika", "options": ["Talon Silverwing", "Aeson", "Cynn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNika.\n\n\tThe Assassin is much like a ninja due to the Asian influence on \"Guild Wars: Factions\", and like all other professions found in an expansion, the Assassin can only be made on Shing Jea Island, the starting point for the game.  The primary attribute for the Assassin is to deal Critical Strikes, but the Assassin can also deal damage using the secondary attributes Dagger Mastery, Shadow Arts, and Deadly Arts. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not a spirit that can be created by a Ritualist?", "correct": "Spirit of Favorable Winds", "options": ["Spirit of Dissonance", "Spirit of Pain", "Spirit of Blood Song"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpirit of Favorable Winds.\n\n\tSpirit summoning is done through use of the Communing secondary attribute.  Ritualists are the second profession to come out of Cantha in \"Guild Wars: Factions\".  Using spirits, the Ritualist is a good party member to have around, but that's not the only thing a 'Rit' does.  Using the Channeling Magic attribute, the Ritualist can use lightning damage, and with Restoration, your Rit can heal the party and steal health.  The primary attribute, Spawning Power, is used to raise the health of spirits. \n"}, {"text": "The Paragon is one of two Elonan professions from \"Guild Wars: Nightfall\".  Which of these is the Paragon primary attribute?", "correct": "Leadership", "options": ["Command", "Motivation", "Spear Mastery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeadership.\n\n\tLike the Dervish character, the Paragon can only be created in the land of Elona in \"Guild Wars: Nightfall\", the third \"Guild Wars\" title.  Aside from using spears, the Paragon is widely-regarded as a support player like the Ritualist and Monk due to the fact that skills are used by the character to assist others.  For example, Motivation skills such as \"It's Just a Flesh Wound\", will help party members at a price.  Many Paragon Skills are also used to heal characters. \n"}, {"text": "The Dervish is another character from Elona.  Which weapon does this character use and have a secondary attribute for?", "correct": "Scythe", "options": ["Warhammer", "Bow", "Sai"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScythe.\n\n\tOne of the Dervish's secondary attributes is the Scythe Mastery skill, which allows them to use the Scythe much better and attack with more damage.  Besides this, the Dervish uses Wind and Earth Prayers to attack much like the Elementalist with spells.  The primary attribute for the Dervish is the Mysticism skill, which will heal a Dervish's health and energy depending on the points placed into the skill. \n"}]}
