{"id": "338001", "name": "City With No Children Online Trivia | Europe | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Europe", "Vatican City"], "questions": [{"text": "The flag of the Vatican contains keys on the right side.  Whose keys are these?", "correct": "St. Peter's", "options": ["St. John's", "St. Patrick's", "St. Paul's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Peter's\n\n\tThe keys are Peter's, which are well-known in the Bible as the keys to Heaven.  One key is gold, and the other is silver, and they are crossed on the right side of the flag on a white band.  The other half of the flag (the left half) is yellow.  The Vatican's flag is one of only two square national flags; the other is Switzerland.\r It's interesting to know that the Vatican City flag is different than the Holy See flag. \n"}, {"text": "The Vatican is the smallest country in the world, and it is also has the least population density.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, though the Vatican is only 0.17 square miles, its population is over 800.  This gives it a density of over 4,800 people per square mile.  This actually ranks the Vatican 6th place in terms of population density. \n"}, {"text": "The Vatican Gardens stretches across more than half of the Vatican.  What is the Vatican Gardens situated on?", "correct": "Vatican Hill", "options": ["Vatican Mountain", "Vatican Plateau", "Vatican Mound"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVatican Hill.\n\n\tThe Vatican Hill contains most of the Vatican Gardens, which covers more than half of the entire country.  The Hill reaches 200 feet at its tallest point.  The Vatican Gardens contains not only plants, but several beautiful fountains and statues as well. \n"}, {"text": "In the late 19th century and the early 20th century, a political dispute between Italy and the Vatican occured.  What was this dispute called?", "correct": "Roman Question", "options": ["Vatican Query", "Holy See", "Italian Inquisition"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoman Question.\n\n\tThe Roman Question began in 1861 when Rome became the capital of Italy.  When Rome was captured in 1870, residents of the Vatican considered themselves prisoners of the Vatican.  It wasn't until 1929 that the Popes left their palace into Rome itself. \n"}, {"text": "During World War II, what side did the Vatican take?", "correct": "Neutral", "options": ["The Vatican did not exist yet", "Axis (Germany, Japan, Italy)", "Allies (US, USSR, Great Britain)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeutral.\n\n\tThe Vatican City remained neutral during World War II.  Germany occupied Rome in 1943, yet the Vatican City had been left alone.  They did not even join the Axis powers with Italy.  The Vatican was able to remain neutral throughout the entire war, under the leadership of Pope Pius XII. \n"}, {"text": "A camerlengo is an office held in the Papal court.  What does camerlengo mean?", "correct": "Chamberlain", "options": ["Cardinal", "Priest", "Camera Lens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChamberlain.\n\n\tThough \"camerlengo\" means \"chamberlain\" in Italian, the camerlengo is usually also a cardinal.  In Dan Brown's novel \"Angels and Demons\", the camerlengo was a main character.  However, in the novel, the camerlengo was just a priest, sort of like a \"right hand man\" to the Pope.  The camerlengo is actually a chamberlain and cardinal, however. \n"}, {"text": "What kind of government is used by the Vatican (think about the famous leaders there)?", "correct": "Monarchy", "options": ["Anarchy", "Democracy", "Oligarchy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonarchy.\n\n\tRemember, the Vatican City is ruled by one ruler, who is the Pope.  Since a monarchy is a government ruled by a single official, the Vatican City falls under this type of government.  An oligarchy is ruled by a group of people and a democracy gives power to the people.  The Vatican gives power just to the Pope, though. \n"}, {"text": "The Vatican's police force is the Pontifical Swiss Guard.  What does \"pontifical\" mean?", "correct": "Papal", "options": ["Powerful", "Pompous", "Pomp (and Circumstance)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPapal.\n\n\tThe pontiff is the Pope, and pontifical means referring to the Pope.  So the Pontifical Swiss Guard basically means \"Papal Swiss Guard\".  To pontificate means to speak or write in a pompous way. \n"}, {"text": "What is the Vatican City's official language?", "correct": "It does not have one", "options": ["Latin", "Italian", "English"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt does not have one.\n\n\tThe Vatican City does not have an official language, but it does use Italian for documents and the like.  However, the Holy See (Pope) uses Latin for his important documents.  Though Italian and Latin are commonly used, neither have been set as an official language of the Vatican. \n"}, {"text": "The JPA (John Paul Airport) is one of the busiest airports in all of Europe.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThere are actually no airports in the Vatican, and there are no highways, either.  Since it is only 0.17 square miles, it is too small for a sufficient airport.  There is a heliport, however, which is of great use to the Pope (when he needs it).  There are roads, but there is hardly a need for them since the Vatican is small enough that you could walk across it several times in a single day.\r To give you an idea of how small the Vatican is, think of this...  Walking at a regular speed of 3 miles an hour would mean it would take you only three and a half minutes to walk from one side of the Vatican to the other.  At a jog, it would take less than two and a half minutes. \n"}]}
