{"id": "340", "name": "Chemistry 101: Elements and Compounds Quiz | Sci / Tech | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Chemistry"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the following gases would you find in a soft drink?", "correct": "CO2", "options": ["H2SO4", "CO", "HCl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCO2.\n\n\tCO2 is carbon dioxide which is added to soft drinks to make them fizzy. \n"}, {"text": "What is the chemical symbol for the element mercury?", "correct": "Hg", "options": ["My", "Mc", "Me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHg.\n\n\tMercury is an unusual element in that it is one of only two elements to occur as a liquid at room temperature (25 degrees C).  The other element to fall under this category is bromine. \n"}, {"text": "Nitrous oxide is also known as what?", "correct": "Laughing gas", "options": ["Hot air balloon gas", "Rotten egg gas", "Smelly gas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaughing gas.\n\n\tNitrous oxide, formula N2O, used to be used in dentistry as an anaesthetic.  Its nickname came from the fact that laughter is a common side-effect of inhaling it. \n"}, {"text": "Which element is most abundant in the air that we breathe?", "correct": "Nitrogen", "options": ["Hydrogen", "Oxygen", "Helium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNitrogen.\n\n\tThe earth's atmosphere is made up of 78% nitrogen, N2.  Oxygen is the next most abundant gas in the atmosphere, at over 20%. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following compounds would you most likely drink?", "correct": "H2O", "options": ["H2SO4", "HCl", "H2O2"], "explanation": "\n\n\nH2O.\n\n\tH2O is just water.  HCl is hydrogen chloride, which when dissolved in water is known as hydrochloric acid; H2SO4 is sulphuric acid and H2O2 is hydrogen peroxide, none of which would be good to drink! \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following would you most likely sprinkle on your food?", "correct": "KCl", "options": ["NaOH", "Mg", "HF"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKCl.\n\n\tKCl is salt substitute for those people on sodium free diets.  NaOH is sodium hydroxide, a strong base that causes burns.  HF is hydrofluoric acid and Mg is the element magnesium. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is the symbol for gold?", "correct": "Au", "options": ["G", "Gd", "Ag"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAu.\n\n\tThe chemical symbol for the element gold is taken from the Latin word \"aurum\", which means \"gold\".  Ag is the symbol for the element silver. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is ozone?", "correct": "O3", "options": ["O2", "O", "OH"], "explanation": "\n\n\nO3.\n\n\tOzone is what shields the earth from damaging ultraviolet rays from the sun.  Ozone is another form of the element oxygen, whose most stable form is O2. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is the closest to the atomic weight of hydrogen?", "correct": "1.0079", "options": ["10.0079", "2.0079", "3.0079"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1.0079\n\n\tHydrogen is the lightest of all the elements and has the atomic number 1. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of the following is the formula for baking soda?", "correct": "NaHCO3", "options": ["HCl", "Na2CO3", "NaOH"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNaHCO3.\n\n\tBaking soda's chemical name is sodium bicarbonate (or sodium hydrogen carbonate).  Na2CO3 is sodium carbonate (which is different from baking soda!), NaOH is sodium hydroxide and HCl is hydrogen chloride. \n"}]}
