Four girls were eventually chosen and they began their career with the song \"DIVE\" featured in \"DDR 5th Mix\".  Over the years, many of the girls in the group disbanded and others were called in to take their places. Over ten girls would be considered members, past or present, by the end of their first decade.  Riyu Kosaka would go on to produce songs solo including \"Love (Love) Shine\" which would appear in many versions of the game including \"Supernova\", arcade versions of \"Extreme 2\", and others. \n"}, {"text": "Captain Jack, a band releasing Europop Dance songs for the \"Dance Dance Revolution\" series, did not release which of these?", "correct": "Strict Machine", "options": ["Centerfold", "In the Navy", "Together & Forever"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrict Machine.\n\n\tFrankie Gee, the Cuban bandleader for the Captain Jack band, passed away in 2005 but the group was immortalized in several versions of \"Dance Dance Revolution\", both in console and arcade versions.  Despite this, Captain Jack rebuilt themselves in 2008 to continue releasing albums in Europe.  Particularly, the band is known for their self-titled single, \"Captain Jack (Grandale Remix)\" which appeared on arcade versions of \"Dance Dance Revolution Extreme\" and console versions of \"Extreme 2\" (PS2).  \"Centerfold\" would appear as a remix of a J.

After the success of their dance game singles, they released albums in Japan to success.  According to Bemani, E-ROTIC became one of the most licensed artists in the game, second only to Captain Jack.  Other songs by the group include \"Turn Me On\" and \"Gimme Gimme Gimme\". \n"}, {"text": "\"I've been searching for a man\nAll across Japan\nJust to find, to find my samurai\"\n\nThis song, by the pop band smile.dk, is quite famous in the canon.

Known for upbeat J-Pop, their singles include \"Sweet Sweet (Love) Magic\" (first seen in \"Extreme 2\"), \"HAPPY(star)ANGEL\" (in \"Supernova\"), and \"TRUE(heart)LOVE\" (in \"Supernova\").  Due to the group's tendency to omit sexual references in their music, the songs have been frequently seen on Wii releases of the series. \n"}, {"text": "NAOKI, known for \"B4U\", \"BRILLIANT 2U\", and \"CAN'T STOP FALLIN' IN LOVE\", has also released songs in the \"Dance Dance Revolution\" universe under what other name?", "correct": "NAOKI Underground", "options": ["DJ Simon", "RE-VENGE", "True Kiss Destination"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNAOKI Underground.\n\n\tNAOKI is another prolific artist in the \"Dance Dance Revolution\" catalogue with several singles under the belt.

Light"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrange Lounge.\n\n\tOrange Lounge is a pseudonym used by Bemani in-house musician Tomosuke Funaki for the \"Dance Dance Revolution\" games.

Orange Lounge is specifically responsible for \"LOVE IS ORANGE\" (from \"Extreme 2\"), \"Mobo(heart)Moga\" (from \"Extreme\"), and \"Mondo Street\" (from Supernova 2\").  To be fair, many of the musicians in-house at Bemani use pseudonyms and aliases. Yuichi Asami, for example, performed a remix of \"Healing Vision\" under the name 2MB while Riyu Kosaka of BeForU has also been credited as Mimi Roberts for a recording of \"Baby's Tears\".

Extremely difficult to pass on almost any difficulty, the BPM for these songs usually fluctuates between 150 and 320, so sometimes memorization is a good idea.  The higher difficulties of these titles should only be attempted by the pros...with stamina...who aren't playing on a full stomach...\rThese songs have appeared on console and arcade versions of the game, but on arcade versions, the player will usually need to play their third song (a specific one) on the hardest difficulty, hit the notes perfectly, and play the 'Encore'. \n"}]}
