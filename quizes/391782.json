{"id": "391782", "name": "The Visit Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies U-Z", "V"], "questions": [{"text": "Becca and Tyler's mother haven't spoken to her parents in more than a decade.  What's the reason behind this?", "correct": "They didn't approve of her husband.", "options": ["They had differing political views.", "Child Protective Services took her away.", "Her parents are dead."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey didn't approve of her husband.\n\n\tBecca and Tyler's mother, Loretta, fell in love with her substitute English teacher toward the end of high school.  They married and had two kids (Becca and Tyler) before he met someone new in a Starbucks, married her, and moved to Palo Alto, California, cutting things off with his old family.  Such is life. Loretta's parents never liked the guy, so she left home at 19 and didn't speak to her parents for fifteen years.  Recently, her parents wanted to meet the grandkids.  Fortunately, the grandkids want to meet them too, so they leave Philadelphia on the train and head out to Masonville, PA, while their mother takes a beach cruise with her new boyfriend (who the kids like).  They plan to film the whole visit. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is Tyler's most prevalent hobby?", "correct": "Rapping", "options": ["Playing sports", "Magic tricks", "Playing video games"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRapping.\n\n\tArriving in Masonville, Becca and Tyler spot their grandparents, Maria and Frederick Jamison, waving a sign near the train station and race up to meet them.  After quick introductions, they drive out to the house they'll be staying in for the next week and take the establishing shots for the documentary, finding items from mother's old stories to fill in the gaps. They rap for a bit and eat some of their grandmother's cooking before setting up camp in their mother's old room.  Both grandparents are delighted that they'll be staying the week, even if the kids can't use their phones for peace of mind-- there's no bars out in this part of rural Pennsylvania. After a quick Skype call to their mother, they're ready to lay back. \n"}, {"text": "According to Nana and Pop Pop, what's in the basement?", "correct": "Mold", "options": ["Rats", "A flood", "Asbestos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMold.\n\n\tBefore the first night, comes to an end, Pop Pop really only makes two things clear to the kids.  Firstly, he asks them to politely avoid the basement because there's mold and they don't want to get sick.  Secondly, after nightfall, he tells the kids that he and Nana are old and prefer to go to bed at 9:30, so past that, they need to stay in their room. Becca knowingly breaks the curfew on the first night-- the Monday night-- to go to the kitchen to look for something to eat (specifically Nana's cookies), and when she does she comes across Nana walking around downstairs, throwing up violently in the front hall. She asks Pop Pop about it the next morning, but he blames a flu virus. \n"}, {"text": "What does Tyler find in the shed on his grandparents' property?", "correct": "Diapers", "options": ["Animals", "Bodies", "Gifts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiapers.\n\n\tBetween Nana playing a frightening game of hide and seek with Becca and Tyler under the house and dealing with visitors to the house during Nana and Pop Pop's midday walk, Tuesday proves to be eventful for the kids.  Things escalate a little bit more when Tyler decides to take a peek into the shed on the property. He waits until Pop Pop leaves and lets himself in to find a horrible smell.  It's because there's a pile of adult diapers inside.  Nana later tells him that Pop Pop is just embarrassed of his incontinence; he soils the diapers and burns them out in the fields to spare himself the shame. \n"}, {"text": "What is the term that Pop Pop uses to describe Nana's odd nighttime behaviour?", "correct": "Sundowning", "options": ["Wintering", "Moonlighting", "Twilighting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSundowning.\n\n\tVisiting town, the kids end up visiting some of their mother's old hangouts, but Pop Pop seems to get paranoid, fearing that someone is watching them before attacking a pedestrian.  That night, the kids keep hearing noises outside their door, but they're a bit afraid to check it out.  When they do, they find their Nana, naked, scratching the walls in the hallway. The next morning, Pop Pop explains that Nana has been diagnosed with a disorder that only affects her at nighttime-- they call it 'sundowning'.  Becca looks it up later and it checks out.  After Nana spills biscuit batter on the kids' computer webcam, the kids try to have a video call with their mother and they all agree that things are a bit weird, but it's nothing too unexpected. \n"}, {"text": "Before Becca is allowed to ask her Nana any questions, she's first asked to do which of these things?", "correct": "Clean the oven", "options": ["Walk on the frozen pond", "Check the traps", "Climb into the chimney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClean the oven.\n\n\tThings get weirder.  When Becca asks Nana about her mother, Nana urges her to clean the back of the inside of the oven-- all the way in-- and when Becca does that she says she'll star in her movie.  Nana dresses herself up for this, answering questions about when she first met Pop Pop.  When Becca asks about her mother though, Nana has a fit, refusing outright to answer the questions.  That night, Nana 'sundowns' again.\rAfter a day of concerning activity, Becca allows Tyler to put a camera downstairs so that they can find out what's really going on. \n"}, {"text": "Does Nana find the hidden camera in the middle of the night?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tShe finds it almost instantly.  While the kids try to sleep through the sundowning happening downstairs, Nana makes noise and finds the camera almost immediately, grabbing it and walking around with it.  At one point, she grabs a large kitchen knife, sets the camera down in a sitting room, and goes to the children's door, attempting to unlock it from the outside. The kids wake up and hear this, and when Friday morning finally rolls around, they play back the footage.  They decide that they'll ask their mother to pick them up that evening once she gets home from the cruise.  In the meantime they just need to get through the day. \n"}, {"text": "Are Nana and Pop Pop Becca and Tyler's actual grandparents?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNana and Pop Pop seem to show some regret that their grandchildren are leaving, and, despite some hesitance, Becca has some sit-down interviews with them on-camera to close out her documentary.  Both seem to tell cryptic stories that only lend to the idea that, perhaps, their mental states are further along than previously assumed.\rWhen Becca and Tyler call their mother on Skype one more time, it appears that she's finally home.  The kids ask her to pick them up as soon as possible because there's something wrong, and when they finally turn the camera towards their grandparents without their noticing, their mother realizes that they've been spending the week with two people who certainly are not her mother and father.  She calls the police and departs immediately. \n"}, {"text": "On their final day at their grandparents' house, what game do Becca and Tyler play?", "correct": "Yahtzee", "options": ["Hide and Seek", "Monopoly", "Scrabble"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYahtzee.\n\n\tFor their final night, 'Nana' and 'Pop Pop' ask for some help with chores before some board games, just like a family would, but it's clear that the kids are very uncomfortable with their situation, especially when they see a body hanging from a tree outside.  Becca, claiming to need a new camera battery, ends up going into the basement instead, leaving her brother with the strangers upstairs and investigating the mysterious part of the house they'd never actually checked out. Since it's almost half-past nine, 'Pop Pop' decides to take 'Nana' to bed before she starts sundowning.  It's then that Becca finds the outfits from Maple Shade Psychiatric Hospital...and worse. \n"}, {"text": "What's actually in the basement of the Jamison house?", "correct": "Dead bodies", "options": ["Gold", "A werewolf", "A demon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDead bodies.\n\n\tAlong with the outfits from the psychiatric hospital, Becca uncovers her real grandparents who, as it would seem, were murdered with a hammer and hidden in the basement.  'Pop Pop', actually a man named Mitchell, claims that 'Nana' (actually Claire) deserved the week with grandchildren, even though she killed her own children years before, and so begins a chase through the house. Mitchell takes Becca up to Claire's room and locks her in, forcing them to fight until Becca stabs her to death.  Downstairs, Tyler fights Mitchell, slamming his head in the refrigerator door repeatedly.  As the kids escape the house, their mother arrives with the police. \n"}]}
