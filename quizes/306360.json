{"id": "306360", "name": "The Life of a Blender Quiz | Topics for Kids | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Food for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "It seems that my owner is going to make some smoothies, and has already pulled out a tub of something that means \"thick\" in Turkish.  What could he be using?", "correct": "Yoghurt", "options": ["Sour cream", "Popcorn", "Butter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoghurt.\n\n\tYoghurt can be found in all types of flavors, from strawberry, to chocolate, to key lime pie!  Yoghurt is of Turkish origin, of course meaning that it originated in Turkey.  The word \"yoghurt\" means \"thick\" in the Turkish language. \n"}, {"text": "It appears my owner is now adding some fragaria to me.  These fruits, which are technically not fruits, are small and red, with little dots on them.  What could they be?", "correct": "Strawberries", "options": ["Watermelons", "Apples", "Cherries"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrawberries.\n\n\tStrawberries grow on vines, and are not actually considered fruits.  They are actually called \"false fruits.\"  The strawberry is known for the shape, a heart shaped red fruit with edible seeds covering it. \n"}, {"text": "Ouch, my owner just burned his eyes with some citrus.  This should give the smoothie a nice pop.  What could he have squeezed?", "correct": "Lemon", "options": ["Grape", "Carrot", "Pickle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLemon.\n\n\tLemons are very tart, due to the citric acid.  In fact, the citric acid in lemons give is a pH of 2 or 3!  Neutral is 7 on the pH scale, and the lower the number, the more sour it is.  Grapes, pickles, and carrots are not citrus, and they aren't tart, unless they have gone bad. \n"}, {"text": "Bob seems to be adding my favorite fruit, which is long and yellow.  It starts out green, though.  What could this be?", "correct": "Banana", "options": ["Pear", "Can't say, they all fit the description", "Apple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBanana.\n\n\tBananas, bananitos, and plantains are all in the same family.  The plantain is not near as sweet as the banana and the bananito, so it is usually used more for cooking, and not baking with sweets.  The bananito resembles a short and fat banana, and when it is ripe, it can turn completely black!  The bananito is a fruit that many dream of creating...  It is a banana that tastes like an apple!  That's right, the \"legendary\" banapple is actually the bananito. \n"}, {"text": "My owner, Bob, wants to make the smoothies thicker.  Which is the best thing for him to add to the smoothies to achieve this?", "correct": "Ice", "options": ["Okra-the slime is thick!", "Root beer", "Lima beans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce.\n\n\tIce adds thickness to an already thick smoothie.  It also makes the smoothie colder for longer.  The smoothie may not have started cold, with room temperature fruit, but the ice will keep it cold.  Make sure you use a setting that can actually grind up the ice well, though! \n"}, {"text": "Now that the smoothies are in glasses, Bob adds one final thing.  He adds a device that was first made by the Sumerians, but wasn't patented until 1888 by Marvin C. Stone.  What device did he put in the smoothie to help drink it?", "correct": "Straw", "options": ["Spoon", "Little umbrella", "Sprig of mint"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStraw.\n\n\tMint was never \"patented!\"  The drinking straw has been around for centuries.  It dates back to the Sumerians, who used these tubular devices to drink their beer.  The smaller opening made it so they could avoid drinking the solid byproducts of the fermentation process.  In Argentina, a similar device was used that was made of metal. It was used to both strain and drink their mate tea.  Several straws have since been created using the basic design of Marvin Stone's straw, and has since advanced from paper to plastic.  Of these include a bendy straw, a crazy straw, and a spoon straw.  And, of course, you don't drink anything through an umbrella or a spoon! \n"}, {"text": "Would you look at that, Bob is making shakes!  He seems to be adding some \"faloodeh\" to make the shakes.  What is it he is putting in the blender to use as the base of a shake?", "correct": "Ice cream", "options": ["Creme fraiche", "Sour cream", "Butter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce cream.\n\n\tIce cream is called faloodeh in Iran.  It is quite a debate as to how ice cream originated.  However, the Chinese are credited with making the device that is used today, although it was much less sophisticated then, to make ice cream.  Popular brands include Breyers, Dreyers, Hagan Daaz, Ben and Jerry's, and Baskin Robbins.  Yum yum! \n"}, {"text": "Bob is adding some sort of thin, white liquid to the shake.  I wonder what it could be?", "correct": "Milk", "options": ["Soup", "Rootbeer", "Ground toffee bits soaked in water"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilk.\n\n\tMilk is what makes a milkshake a milkshake!  Of course, any milk will work, skim milk, whole milk, 2% milk, soy milk, any kind of milk.  However, whole milk is the best to use, because the thicker the milk, the thicker the shake! \n"}, {"text": "Now Bob is wanting to make this shake a chocolate shake.  Therefore, he puts some chocolate into his blender.  Which of these is the best thing to use to make a chocolate-flavored shake?", "correct": "Chocolate sauce", "options": ["Chocolate crepes", "Chocolate peanut butter", "Mud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate sauce.\n\n\tChocolate sauce is the most common ingredient used to flavor a milkshake.  Hershey's is the most common brand in the United States for chocolate sauce.  While there are many kinds of chocolate brands, like Hershey's, Dagobah, Nestle, and countless others, the most common chocolate sauce, besides Safeway brand or Kroger, is Hershey's!  You would never want to use crepes or peanut butter to flavor your chocolate shake, unless, of course, you were making a chocolate peanut butter shake. \n"}, {"text": "It seems that Bob is done with the shakes.  He has now stuck on a sprig of mint on the shake.  What word would best describe what he has just done?", "correct": "Garnish", "options": ["Yummy", "Decorate", "Mintify"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarnish.\n\n\tAdding greens and other pieces of food that is not part of the main dish is called garnishing.  Garnish can be virtually anything edible, but is usually made of leafy green herbs.  For drinks and desserts, the most common garnish is mint, which can come in many different varieties.  Varieties of mint include spearmint, peppermint, and candy mint, which tastes like a candy cane!\r Well, I hope you enjoyed making smoothies and shakes with Bob IN me.  Please tell Bob to start using me more often (and if _you_ decide to use me, make sure you ask your mom or dad to help first!).  I don't like being trapped in the pantry.  I am a great appliance to have around!\r Thanks for playing! \n"}]}
