{"id": "406660", "name": "\"Blood Buffet\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Double Feature"], "questions": [{"text": "For how long has the Chemist been living in Provincetown?", "correct": "Five years", "options": ["Six months", "Two years", "Her whole life"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive years.\n\n\tFive years ago, in the month of October, the Chemist drove up the cape to Provincetown to meet with Holden Vaughn, the real estate agent and interior designer for many of the town's most chic homes.  The Chemist, claiming to have gotten out of a messy divorce, was in the market for a quiet place to focus on her work.  Holden wasn't interested in anything short of the curious truth when he asked her for her real motivation, believing it to be meth, considering the locals, but the Chemist, claiming to have a ph.d from Harvard, claimed meth was below her pay grade.  She was just looking for some quiet, and that's why she took the house.\r Bringing her cases into her new home, she set up her lab and started getting to work.  Making the pills was no trouble at all. \n"}, {"text": "The Chemist used to work for which of the following?", "correct": "The U.S. Military", "options": ["The last American alchemist", "Big Pharma", "The Illuminati"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe U.S. Military\n\n\tThe Chemist used to go to The Muse for drinks in her early days in Provincetown and there she used to watch the locals go about their lives.  After watching Mickey strike out with Holden Vaughn, she took him back to her place to spend the night.  There, serving him a drink while he watched the beakers and lab equipment, she discussed his prices (and his interesting seasonal deals) but ultimately settled on just using his time to talk. Their talks quickly turned to dreams and Mickey expressed his interest in writing.  Ultimately, the Chemist used to work with the U.S. Military looking for ways to unlock the creative parts of the brain. As she explained, the military wanted to lock away soldiers' creative minds, but to do that, they needed to learn how to unlock it.  That's why she has her research into the occipital lobe; her drugs target the neurons in that area and they work. \n"}, {"text": "Did the Chemist test her creativity pills before giving them to people?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThere was a hidden catch to the Chemist's research.  When the pills she made were tested on primates, they certainly did work...but only on primates with higher cognitive function.  The ones that were smarter could play complex notes on a keyboard.  The ones that weren't smarter went bloodthirsty, tearing the other apes limb from limb.  Non-creative creatures, it seemed, could only tolerate their lack of talent until confronted with it.\r That was when the Chemist put a tube of pills on the table and gave Mickey the choice-- maybe he would be one of the talented ones.  He did, of course, refuse.  But on his way out, the Chemist offered $50 for any person he could bring over to test the pills. \n"}, {"text": "Mickey sent a friend of his to the Chemist's as a test subject on the back of which of these talents?", "correct": "Singing", "options": ["Sculpting", "Dancing", "Writing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSinging.\n\n\tMickey ended up at a karaoke bar for drinks on another night.  Musing on the changing of the season, Karen talked about how much she appreciated the galleries closing for the winter, if only to spare her the mocking of the art inside.  It was then that Mickey asked her about her talents, but Karen claimed that she really didn't believe she had much of them.  She couldn't possibly paint something for those galleries.\r Mickey would instead send a friend of his, a singer, to the Chemist's house, believing him to be a good enough test subject for her needs. \n"}, {"text": "When Belle Noir visited Cape Cod on her book tour, she was already a 'New York Times' bestselling author.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAt an Autumn Reading Octoberfest book signing at the Tip of the Cape bookstore, Belle Noir was given the chance to give a reading from her new self-published novel, 'Martha's Cherry Tree', a racy retelling of George and Martha Washington's love life.  The story was outlandish and it appeared that she hadn't quite reached the potential she would eventually be known for.  The Chemist encountered her there, and as Belle signed her book, she said that she had a lot of potential.  At this point, Belle didn't have a publisher.\r Heading outside, Belle reunited with her husband who, unsupportive of her dreams, tried to get her to realize the futility of her book tour.  In Provincetown she sold one of her disgusting books; in the entire tour she'd sold six total.  Though they were together for forty years, he seemed to be at his end. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Belle meet Mickey for the first time?", "correct": "At The Muse", "options": ["At her book signing", "In her hotel lobby", "At the bus stop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt The Muse.\n\n\tWith her husband uninterested in watching the Cape sunset, Belle Noir made her way to The Muse for a glass of wine.  Mickey found her at the bar there and chatted her up, recognizing her as the author from the book signing, and Belle was kind enough to offer him a drink.  During their talk, Belle admitted that she knew she wrote schlock, but she was a writer nonetheless, even if she died writing, ruining her life and marriage to do what she loves.  She asked Mickey if he had any cocaine.  He didn't, but he had something else that could do the trick-- methamphetamine.\r While Belle danced next to the bar, Mickey watched as the singer he sent to the Chemist's came into the building and ordered a bloody mary.  The man, now seeming to be very sick, headed to the restroom to throw up the drink.  It was there, standing in the mirror and running his hands through his hair, that he found he was able to pull chunks from his scalp. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these, according to the Chemist, would be a likely side effect for anyone who consumes the pill?", "correct": "Aggression", "options": ["Euphoria", "Time dilation", "Hair loss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAggression.\n\n\tBelle, riding off her euphoric first high, suggested to Mickey that she wanted to feel as happy as she did in that moment, but forever.  Though Mickey let her know that addicts always try to seek that first great high, he could have something for a talented person like herself.  And that was what brought them to the Chemist's house.  There, after the Chemist read through Belle's most recent book, the pills were placed on the table and Belle, seeking a way to hone her talent at any cost, brushed aside the mention of the obvious side effects.  A little aggression, she stated, could go a long way since she lacked that backbone.  The Chemist warned her that the effects would be temporary, but the pills would keep coming provided she stayed in the area as a subject of study.  And with that, Belle Noir took the pill and started to meet her destiny.\r That evening, Belle returned to her hotel room and felt the effects upon arriving.  Sitting at her computer, she began writing immediately, letting the words spill out onto the page as fast as she could write.  By the time her husband got home she finished the novel she'd envisioned, even if he didn't believe it.  But his denial of her capability...and the honesty of his infidelity... was the last straw.  She smashed an empty wine bottle, slit his throat, and began to gorge on his blood. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Belle dispose of her husband's body?", "correct": "The ocean", "options": ["A fireplace", "The walls of a rental property", "A trash chute"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe ocean.\n\n\tThe morning of her husband's murder, Belle returned to the Chemist's house to report back on the findings of the pill.  As she explained, it was as though she'd been overcome by immediate rage-- a thirst where she could smell his blood through his skin; she needed it or she felt she would die.  Interestingly, the test monkeys did the same sort of thing.\r Belle had to contemplate if she would need to keep doing the same thing to continue being prolific in her craft, and the Chemist made it clear that she would need to feed herself if she wanted to take the pills once again.  Immediately after drinking her husband's blood, she sat down and wrote another fifty pages of the sequel novel.\r The Chemist let her know-- the first order of business was to dispose of her husband's body.  She did, cutting it into pieces and tossing it out at the beach.  It would be found by Holden Vaughn, walking his dogs near the water's edge. \n"}, {"text": "Who was responsible for clothing the pale men in their padded trenchcoats?", "correct": "Lark", "options": ["Holden Vaughn", "Austin", "Chief Burelson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLark.\n\n\tThe Chemist's first test subject returned to her house completely bald, having lost all his hair during the trial time or shaved it off.  Additionally, his skin had taken on a creamy, anemic texture and his temper was hit or miss.  He was jonesing for the pills and he was days away from another.  He complained about the cold but the Chemist reminded him that it was October; he might simply need a warmer jacket.\r And that's why he headed to Lark's shop in town to pick up something warmer.  There, Lark gave him a raw deal-- old fashion from the '80s, left behind when they passed away and put back up for sale second-hand.  She basically gave him a broad-shouldered, warmer jacket for free.  On the same day he bought the jacket, he killed a woman in mourning and feasted on her blood before returning to town...just in time for Halloween.\r When the singer showed up at the Chemist's house, he expressed that he never wanted to kill but the pill made him hate everybody.  The Chemist verified his newfound knowledge; in talented people, their hatred materialized from their arrogance but in untalented people, the pill made them aggressive due to the realization of their inadequacy.  The Chemist drew a gun on the man before he could attack and she forced him to leave.  He could fend for himself.\r That's when the attacks commenced in earnest. \n"}, {"text": "What was Austin's drag name?", "correct": "Patty O'Furniture", "options": ["Dina Saur", "Maxi Padds", "Bella Donna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatty O'Furniture.\n\n\tThree years after the Chemist arrived in Provincetown, on another Halloween night, Belle shopped around for new clothes at Lark's store and both admitted they were taking the pill to great success.  By this point, Belle had six 'New York Times' bestsellers; Lark became a miraculous tattoo artist and dental prodigy.\r Decked out in a new outfit, Belle made her way through Provincetown to watch drag night at the club and there, she met Austin after he performed \"Magic Man\" onstage dressed as a woman.  When the night came to an end, she found him playing the piano and she served him a drink to break the ice.  Recognizing his talents, she offered him the pill, partly due to her own actions as she killed the theatre owner who planned to feature his play in town.  He took it without much regard.\r What followed was a massacre as Belle and Austin fell upon a house full of drag queens.  Belle shot the most of them and they fed on the bodies though one escaped.  They didn't make it far, however, as the Chemist's first test subject fed on them in the nearby graveyard. \n"}]}
