", "correct": "A small plastic box with a metal tongue that makes a clicking noise when pressed", "options": ["A television remote control", "An electric collar", "A small wooden musical instrument"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA small plastic box with a metal tongue that makes a clicking noise when pressed.\n\n\tThe earliest clickers were children's toys, made of metal or plastic, with a tongue that made a clicking noise when pressed. They were often made in animal shapes, most commonly frogs. Sometimes they were called \"crickets.\" The first clickers I ever bought were plastic and shaped like snowmen! Nowadays, clickers are made expressly for use in animal training. \n"}, {"text": "What is the clicker used for?", "correct": "As an event marker for the dog", "options": ["As a conditioned punisher", "As primary reinforcement", "As an antecedent to behavior"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs an event marker for the dog.\n\n\tThe clicker serves to \"mark\" exactly what behavior the animal is being rewarded for. See below for how this is trained. \n"}, {"text": "What must follow the click?", "correct": "Something the dog enjoys", "options": ["Food", "Verbal praise", "A command"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomething the dog enjoys.\n\n\tThe click lets the dog know that \"that behavior was what I wanted, your reward is coming!\" \n"}, {"text": "How do you train the dog to know what the click means?", "correct": "Click and then reward the dog. Do this multiple times", "options": ["You don't- it's natural", "Click and then give the dog a command", "Reward the dog, then click. Do this multiple times"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClick and then reward the dog. Do this multiple times\n\n\tBy pairing the click and the reward (usually food,) you teach the dog that the click means \"something good is coming.\" For most dogs, 10-20 repetitions is enough to teach them this. \n"}, {"text": "Once the dog knows what the click means, what will happen if you start to click every time the dog does a certain behavior?", "correct": "The rate of that behavior will increase", "options": ["The dog will stop that behavior and offer a new one", "The rate of that behavior will decrease", "The dog will keep on performing that behavior, without stopping"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe rate of that behavior will increase.\n\n\tBecause the click signals a reward, the rewarded behavior will increase. However, it's also important to know that the click signals the end of the behavior- that the reward is coming. So, for example, if you click sits, the number of sits will soon begin to increase. However, every time you click one sit, that sit is over, and the dog may get up to get his treat. \n"}, {"text": "What kinds of behaviors can you teach with the clicker?", "correct": "Anything that the dog is physically capable of doing", "options": ["Tricks", "Obedience behaviors", "Anything that can't be communicated verbally to the dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnything that the dog is physically capable of doing.\n\n\tIf the dog can do it, you can train it with a clicker. \n"}, {"text": "When using a clicker to train a behavior, what is \"free shaping\"?", "correct": "Clicking for  closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior, without luring the dog in any way", "options": ["Giving extra-\"free\" -treats for  repetitions of the desired behavior", "Using your hands to \"shape\" the dog into position, then clicking", "Free shaping isn't used when clicker training"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClicking for  closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior, without luring the dog in any way.\n\n\tWhen free shaping, you wait for the dog to emit a behavior that is close to what you desire, then you click. You then click behaviors that are closer and closer to what you want. The advantage to this is that there are no prompts to fade. The disadvantage is that it cannot be used easily for complex behaviors. It's great for easy behaviors like \"sit.\" \n"}, {"text": "Clicker trainers do not use punishment to train dogs.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis is one of the biggest myths about clicker training. Clicker trainers generally do not use positive punishment- adding a punishing stimulus that decreases a behavior to a dog's environment, like a jerk on a choke collar. But they do use negative punishment- removal of something in the environment that decreases behavior. For example, if the dog jumps up, the trainer may leave the room, thereby denying attention to the dog. \n"}, {"text": "Why is using a clicker better than using a word, such as \"good!\"?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["The sound of the clicker is unlike anything else in the environment", "The clicker is more precise", "The clicker has no other meaning to the dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tDogs hear our voices all the time, and thus often ignore them! The clicker is a unique stimulus that has no other meaning to the dog. In addition, people can click faster than they can say \"Good dog!\" \n"}, {"text": "Although clicker training is great for one-on-one training, it doesn't work well in group classes because dogs get confused about who's clicking.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDogs have very good hearing- they have no trouble distinguishing which click is theirs! \n"}]}
