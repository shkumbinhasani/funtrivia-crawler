{"id": "281075", "name": "Tools of the Laser Optics Lab Multiple Choice Quiz | Physics | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " Physics", "Electromagnetic Spectrum and Optics"], "questions": [{"text": "Before you enter the laser lab, there's one tool you need with you: safety goggles for eye protection. In this lab, however, there's a whole rack of them to choose from! What information must you consider when choosing your laser safety goggles?", "correct": "The wavelength of the laser in use", "options": ["Whether the laser is pulsed or continuous wave (at the same power)", "The types of chemicals in use", "Whether the lab receives direct sunlight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe wavelength of the laser in use.\n\n\tLasers above a certain power (energy output per second) are very dangerous to eyesight. Vision works because the lens of your eye focuses light onto your retina, which contains light-sensitive cells -- but if you focus too much energy there, your retina will burn. Unlike damage from the sun, you can't blink fast enough to avoid damage from a high-powered laser -- and if the beam is invisible, your blink reflex won't even trigger at all.\r Laser safety goggles are designed to solve this problem, absorbing enough photons at the laser wavelength that the light reaching your eyes is safe. These only work at limited wavelength ranges -- otherwise you wouldn't be able to see anything! -- so it's important to make sure you're wearing the right goggles for your laser. \n"}, {"text": "Now that you've got the right safety equipment, let's head into the lab! The laser and its optics are set up on a special \"optical table\"; a good one can cost thousands of dollars! The thick tabletop is filled with foam and supported by an internal honeycomb of steel; it sits on pneumatic legs filled with compressed air. Why is all this necessary?", "correct": "To keep the laser system from shaking or vibrating", "options": ["To shield the rest of the lab from harmful radiation", "To support the laser's enormous weight", "To keep the laser at a constant temperature"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo keep the laser system from shaking or vibrating.\n\n\tLaser optics systems require precise alignment -- often to accuracies of a few nanometers (those are millionths of a millimeter!) When such levels of precision are needed, scientists must be very careful to remove sources of error -- and vibration, even the sound of a cough or the impact of a foot on the floor, is a big source of error. Optical tables, with their complex innards, are designed to damp vibrations and keep laser systems in alignment.\r Optical tables have a second advantage for alignment: they're generally topped with a steel or aluminum breadboard, a grid of standard screw holes on a flat surface. Mirrors, lenses and other optical goodies can thus be easily and securely mounted along straight lines or right angles, simplifying the setup of a complex system. \n"}, {"text": "The optical table may be covered with dozens -- or hundreds! -- of optics tools, but it all leads back to the laser itself. There are many types of lasers, each relying on a slightly different principle; one major division is between continuous-wave lasers and pulsed lasers. Which of these is an advantage of pulsed lasers?", "correct": "Pulsed lasers can produce higher peak powers than continuous-wave lasers.", "options": ["Pulsed lasers heat up quickly, making the lab more comfortable.", "Pulsed lasers are always faster to \"turn on\" than continuous-wave lasers.", "Pulsed lasers produce better-polarized laser beams than continuous-wave lasers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nPulsed lasers can produce higher peak powers than continuous-wave lasers.\n\n\tA laser -- the name stands for \"Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\" -- has at its core a particular gain medium, which could be (among other things) a semiconductor, a gas, or a crystal. By applying some energy, you can \"invert the population\" -- moving the atoms or molecules to a state with a higher energy. Then, when an atom or molecule is perturbed by a photon with the right energy, it decays back to the lower-energy state, emitting the excess energy in the form of a photon. In this process, called stimulated emission, the original photon becomes two -- with the same energy, the same direction of motion, and the same phase (that is, the peaks and valleys of their waveforms line up). The gain medium is enclosed by two mirrors, so that light bounces back and forth, amplified every time; with constant energy input to keep the population inverted in the gain medium, one ends up with a powerful beam.\r A laser can be designed to run continuously (that is, continuous-wave or CW operation) or in a pulsed mode. High-powered CW lasers suffer from heating up too quickly; pulsed lasers achieve greater peak power partly because there's time for the gain medium to recover between pulses. By the same token, however, CW lasers are always on; although some types of pulsed laser have high repetition rates, others require waiting seconds, minutes or even hours between pulses! Choosing a laser requires carefully weighing the pros and cons for your particular application. \n"}, {"text": "In the popular imagination, laser beams are perfectly straight lines, but in truth this is only an approximation: laser beams always have a more complicated shape. The simplest (and thus most widely used) of these shapes is a Gaussian beam, which can be described by only two parameters: the laser wavelength and the beam waist. Which of these defines the \"waist\" of a Gaussian beam?", "correct": "The diameter of the beam's cross section at its narrowest point", "options": ["The distance traveled by the beam before it strikes the first lens", "The diameter of the beam's cross section at its widest point", "The number of photons in a cubic centimeter of beam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe diameter of the beam's cross section at its narrowest point.\n\n\tA Gaussian laser beam, seen from the side, looks a bit like a bow-tie, or like two cones placed tip to tip. The beam begins with a relatively large diameter (or \"spot size\"), and gradually tapers to its narrowest extent, the waist - after which it gradually spreads out again. The quickness of this spreading - called the beam divergence - depends on the laser wavelength and on the beam waist: the narrower the waist, the faster the beam diverges from it on either side.With the right optics, one can get a laser beam very close to a straight line; the process is called collimation, and it relies on maintaining a large beam waist and small divergence. \n"}, {"text": "Okay, it looks like we're ready to start experimenting! Let's turn on the laser and -- wait a minute. This is an infrared laser, outside the spectrum of light that humans can see. Which of these tools will be most useful in determining the location and size of the beam?", "correct": "A \"viewing card\" that responds to infrared light by fluorescing at a visible wavelength", "options": ["A nonlinear optical crystal that converts the beam to a different wavelength", "A dichroic filter that reduces the beam to its visible components", "No tool is necessary -- the wavelength will change over distance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA \"viewing card\" that responds to infrared light by fluorescing at a visible wavelength.\n\n\tAn ideal laser produces a beam of coherent light, all at a single wavelength; real-world lasers can never be quite as good, but the wavelengths of laser light should fall in a tight range around the central value. You'll never see a single laser producing a beam that includes both red and green light, let alone light that spans both visible and infrared! Remember, too, that the wavelength of a photon depends on its energy -- and the energy of a particle should not change if all it's doing is moving across the room. A nonlinear optical crystal can change the wavelength of a laser beam passing through it, but the process is both inefficient and finicky. It requires extremely precise beam steering and focusing, so it isn't terribly useful as a diagnostic tool.\r A viewing card, however, is a crucial tool for any laser lab. If you're taking proper safety precautions (namely laser safety goggles), you won't be able to see your laser beam whether it falls in the visible range or not -- but you CAN see its image on the viewing card. And it's as portable as it sounds: by moving it around, you can see how the beam's spot size changes with distance, or search for stray reflections. Don't leave home without it! \n"}, {"text": "We've got our laser beam and we've got a way to see it, but the first thing we see is a problem: the beam has a very large diameter where we need it to have a very small one. Which tool is best for changing the shape of the beam?", "correct": "A lens", "options": ["A beamsplitter", "A plane mirror", "A half-wave plate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA lens.\n\n\tManipulating laser light is much like manipulating regular light -- except that, since lasers pack much more energy into a smaller area, the necessary optics must be sturdier, more precise and (naturally) more expensive. A laser optics lens is a piece of glass, curved in such a way that it converges or diverges a passing beam of light at a specified angle.It's the same principle that allows a magnifying glass to make an image appear larger, and that allows the lens of your eye to focus the results on your retina! All of these lenses alter the shape or size of the beam, so they're crucial tools for optimizing the laser beam -- whether it's too large, too small, or too elliptical. \n"}, {"text": "Part of the challenge of laser optics is getting the laser beam exactly where you want it. Let's say, for example, that you want to pass the laser beam through some helium gas. The beam travels across the table at a height of 1 centimeter, but the target is on a large and complicated mount -- so the gas is 10 centimeters above the table. How will you change the height of the beam?", "correct": "With a pair of plane mirrors", "options": ["With a pellicle beamsplitter", "With a spherical integrator", "With an optical ramp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith a pair of plane mirrors.\n\n\tIf you want to send the beam off at some angle but leave it otherwise unchanged, a plane mirror is your best bet. By turning the face of the mirror relative to the incident laser light, you can get an outgoing beam at any angle, although it's most common to try for a right angle. Changing the height of a beam with a pair of plane mirrors is simple. First, you tilt a mirror so that it takes a horizontal beam and directs it straight up. Next, where the upward-traveling beam would reach the correct height, place a second mirror to make it horizontal again.\r Laser optics scientists usually try to place the beam at some standard height to take advantage of mass-produced optics mounts, like pedestal posts of a standard height or mirror mounts of a standard diameter. \n"}, {"text": "Now that we can control the beam's shape and location, it's time to start thinking about its other properties. For example, several useful tools -- like quarter-wave plates -- allow us to change the beam's polarization. But what IS the polarization of a moving photon?", "correct": "The orientation of its electric and magnetic fields", "options": ["Its energy density", "The direction in which it is moving", "The orientation of its strong and weak fields"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe orientation of its electric and magnetic fields.\n\n\tWe can think of a photon as a traveling electromagnetic wave, carrying an electric field E and a magnetic field B along with it. E and B are at right angles both to each other and to the direction in which the photon is moving, but those requirements leave a lot of freedom. Take a photon traveling horizontally across an optics table. Its electric field could point straight up, or horizontally at a right angle to its path, or at a 45-degree angle between the table and the floor. It could even rotate about the axis of its momentum! Each of these choices describes a possible photon polarization state (the first three \"linear\" and the last one \"circular\"); if most of its photons share a polarization, a laser beam is said to be polarized too.\r A photon interacts with matter via its electromagnetic fields, so its polarization affects how some physical processes unfold. As a laser scientist, you probably want to control these effects, so you might start with a polarized laser beam and use quarter-wave plates and half-wave plates to get the precise polarization state you want. (Broadly, a half-wave plate rotates a linear polarization state, and a quarter-wave plate switches between linear and circular polarizations.) \n"}, {"text": "We've got a pretty good little laser system set up here, but some experiments just won't work with a single laser beam. For example, if you want to detect gravitational waves, you'll need to find some way of dividing the beam in two -- while preserving its important properties. Which of these tools should you use?", "correct": "A beamsplitter", "options": ["A half-wave plate", "An attenuator", "A fiber amplifier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA beamsplitter.\n\n\tThere are many reasons you might want to \"split\" a laser beam. For example, suppose you want to use a camera to measure the beam's shape -- but your lowest laser power setting is more than enough to fry the camera. A pellicle beamsplitter could save the day: it's a thin film that transmits about 92% of the light while reflecting the other 8%. Or you might have been playing with nonlinear optical crystals, resulting in a beam made up of both infrared and green light -- in which case a dichroic mirror, which reflects one wavelength and transmits the other, can separate those frequencies to give you two monochromatic laser beams. \r But beamsplitters' most common use may be in interferometers -- like the ones used to look for gravitational waves. Here the basic idea is to begin with laser light from a single source, split it in two, and send the two beams along different paths that are supposed to be the same length. When you bring them together again, any difference in the path lengths -- such as might be caused by gravitational waves! -- will result in interference between the beams. \n"}, {"text": "For some experiments, the classic setup -- an optical table supporting a \"forest\" of elements -- just won't work. It's hard to find a table big enough (or a beam in a straight enough line) to check the state of your photons after they've traveled, say, a mile! One solution is to send your laser beam through a fiber-optic cable. How does such a cable contain the entire beam?", "correct": "Total internal reflection", "options": ["Total external refraction", "Snell's Law", "Polarization transfer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTotal internal reflection.\n\n\tA typical fiber-optic cable is a long, thin cylinder of glass, coated in \"cladding\" (often another type of glass). You might expect that a lot of light would escape from such a fiber -- but optical engineers make use of a special property called total internal reflection. \r Think of how light passes from one material to another. Some of it is reflected back from the boundary; some of it is refracted, passing across the boundary but bent by some angle that's dictated by the properties of the two materials. When the light is approaching from the denser side of the boundary, there's a \"critical angle\" above which all light is reflected and none is refracted -- so that it's all contained in that first material. So all you need to do is make sure that your laser beam enters the fiber core at some angle greater than the critical angle, and it will travel the length of the cable with very little loss. (Sadly, in real-world systems, there's always SOME loss.) Scientists have sent laser beams traveling for miles in this way! \n"}]}
