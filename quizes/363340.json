{"id": "363340", "name": "Murray, the Hippo With the Guttural Roar Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games Q-S", "Sly Cooper Games"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of \"Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus\", we are introduced to the three main characters.  Sly Cooper was introduced as \"The Thief\", and Bentley was called \"The Brains\".  What was Murray?", "correct": "The Brawn", "options": ["The Mechanic", "The Strategist", "The Other Guy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Brawn.\n\n\tMurray, as he is a hippo, is fairly strong, and since his comrades are only raccoons and turtles, it makes sense that the strength-related word belongs to him.  He is not all that bright, though he has a knack for certain things (like being the mechanic), and he has an artistic side to him as well. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the series, we are reminded of how Sly, Bentley, and Murray met.  They had been friends since they were young children, but where exactly did they meet?", "correct": "Orphanage", "options": ["School", "Playground", "They met as adults"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrphanage.\n\n\tSly, Bentley, and Murray became best of friends when they were all placed in the \"Happy Camper Orphanage\" as young boys.  This is where they became friends, and also where they first teamed up for a heist (though, as kids, their first heist was a jar of cookies). \n"}, {"text": "If you were to picture a hippo, you may think of him as gray, but \"Sly Cooper\"'s Murray is not a gray hippo.  What is his actual color?", "correct": "Magenta", "options": ["Nah, he's gray", "Cyan", "Sepia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagenta.\n\n\tMurray is often mistaken as a pink hippo (I admit, I have been guilty of believing this myself).  However, his signature color is actually magenta, not pink.  Admittedly, he does appear 'pinker' in \"Sly Cooper 2\" than he does in the original \"Sly Cooper\", where he does actually look somewhat purple. \n"}, {"text": "After blaming himself for Bentley's injury, Murray decided to look for a new path of peace by speaking with a peaceful creature; a spiritual man.  What was the name of his teacher?", "correct": "The Guru", "options": ["The Priest", "The Shaman", "The Sensei"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Guru.\n\n\tMurray felt bad about what happened to Bentley (he was injured and confined to a wheelchair) and blamed himself for it, believing he could have prevented it from happening.  He felt so bad, he decided to give up thievery and try to learn inner peace to suppress his anger.  He traveled to Australia to train with the Guru, an Aboriginal purple koala who lived at Ayers Rock. \n"}, {"text": "Most boss battles in the \"Sly Cooper\" series are fought between the boss and Sly Cooper himself, but Murray has also been known to get in on a battle.  Which of these bosses is not one Murray has fought himself?", "correct": "Captain LeFwee", "options": ["Muggshott", "Octavio", "Rajan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain LeFwee.\n\n\tThough the majority of bosses are fought directly as Sly Cooper, there are still a fair number fought by his teammates, and Murray himself has fought more than most of the other companions.  He fought Rajan the Indian tiger in \"Sly Cooper 2\", after Sly had become unconscious and Rajan called Murray a \"fat pathetic weakling\".  In the third game of the series, Murray fought Muggshott (while Bentley fought off some goons with booby traps) in the airplane hangar to prevent him from sabotaging the Cooper Gang. He fought Octavio also in \"Sly Cooper 3\", but as he was in training with the Guru, he could not fight until the tar was removed with the canals of Venice (\"when the black water ran pure\"). \n"}, {"text": "In \"Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves\", Murray was finally given the ability to pickpocket enemies.  What is his unconventional method of stealing valuables from the guards' pockets?", "correct": "He shakes it out of their pockets", "options": ["He uses a magnet on the end of a fishing pole", "He removes the entire pocket", "He kills the enemy and then takes the items"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe shakes it out of their pockets.\n\n\tPickpocketing is a great way to get some extra cash, which can be extremely helpful to buy expensive items and power-ups on the Thief Net.  However, up until \"Sly 3\", only Sly himself could pick-pocket.  However, both Murray and Bentley were given the ability to pickpocket, though with much different methods than Sly.  Murray could hit an enemy and stomp his foot on the ground to pick him up.  Then he would shake the enemy around until money and items fell out of the pockets; but the danger with this method is that the guards create a lot of noise and alert other nearby enemies. Bentley also had newly learned to pickpocket, but instead of using brute force as Murray did, he would use a magnet to suck out the coins and valuables from the pockets of unsuspecting guards. \n"}, {"text": "After the gang split up at the end of \"Sly Cooper 3\", Murray found a new passion and profession.  What was it?", "correct": "Racecar Driver", "options": ["Playboy, Philanthropist, Billionaire", "Pizza Delivery Guy", "Yoga Instructor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRacecar Driver.\n\n\tWhen Sly left the Cooper Gang to pursue a relationship with Carmelita Fox (by faking amnesia), Bentley and Murray both decided to pursue their own interests as well.  Bentley, along with his girlfriend, Penelope, spent his time researching time travel and creating a time machine.  Murray took his van and used it to become a racer, decimating the competing sports cars with only his large van. \n"}, {"text": "Like so many video game characters, Murray does not wear an entire typical outfit.  There is an integral article of clothing missing; which is it that he lacks?", "correct": "Pants", "options": ["Gloves", "Shirt", "Shoes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPants.\n\n\tDue to the fact that Murray is so large around the waist, he has a difficult time finding clothes to fit him, so he chooses to go without pants.  He does wear, however, a shirt, shoes, fingerless gloves, and a headband.  In my opinion, he should find a good tailor to make him some custom fit trousers; or at the very least, a large pair of undergarments. \n"}, {"text": "Murray has quite the appetite, but he won't eat just anything.  In fact, if you let Murray stand still for long enough in \"Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time\", he will begin to eat some sort of food, but if it is a vegetable, he will not eat it.  Which of these vegetables will he throw on the ground and refuse to eat?", "correct": "Broccoli", "options": ["Cucumber", "Bok Choy", "Kale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBroccoli.\n\n\tOftentimes, just for added fun, game designers make their characters perform certain actions if you leave them motionless for certain periods of time.  In the case of Murray, he will pull out a variety of foods and eat them.  However, if it is a piece of broccoli that he eats, he will throw it on the ground and suppress his barf; yes, he hates healthy foods almost as much as I did when I was a young child! \n"}, {"text": "I could not mention the Guttural Roar in the title without asking something about it in one of the questions, could I?\n\nThe Guttural Roar is an ability of Murray's that does what, exactly?", "correct": "Makes enemies quake with fear", "options": ["Makes Murray invincible for ten seconds", "Makes enemies freeze for a short period of time", "Kills all enemies within a certain radius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMakes enemies quake with fear.\n\n\tMurray has several abilities throughout the series, but one of his trademark moves is his Guttural Roar.  Though Murray was originally quite fearful of most enemies, once he decided to join Sly in the field, he became a bit more courageous.  The Guttural Roar is proof of this change; making the enemies fear HIM, instead of the enemies making him cower. \n"}]}
