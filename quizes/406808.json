{"id": "406808", "name": "Midnight Mass - Book VI: Acts of the Apostles Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "Midnight Mass"], "questions": [{"text": "Ed, Annie, and Warren wake up to find which of these on their beds?", "correct": "Letters", "options": ["Bibles", "Flowers", "Cassette tapes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLetters.\n\n\tErin, sitting alone in the rowboat at sunrise, can only look on while Riley's ashes blow away in the wind.  When she's finally composed, she dusts off his seat and grabs the oars to head back to Crockett's Island.\r With the sunrise, the Flynns find handwritten notes waiting on their beds.  Father Hill returns home to spend his day inside.  Erin walks past St. Patrick's Church to find the sign being changed, announcing the midnight Easter vigil.  She heads to Dr. Gunning's house before she goes home and she tells her everything; she needs help. \n"}, {"text": "Bev recommends that the town be re-baptized during a ceremony on which date?", "correct": "Easter", "options": ["Independence Day", "Vernal equinox", "Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEaster.\n\n\tOnce Erin gets the story out, Sarah asks her if she's ever heard of Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician who was in charge of two maternity wards.  It was his idea to perform chlorine hand washes before births to lower death rates that was met with disdain from the medical community two decades before germ theory was created.  He was committed to an asylum by another scientist.  She tells his story because Erin might sound crazy, but there are other crazy things going on.\r Sarah tells Erin that what's going on with her mother is similarly crazy; no one would believe it.  She takes Erin to her office and pours her mother's blood on a petri dish before placing it in the sun and they watch as it combusts.  When Mildred comes down to investigate the smoke alarm, Erin sees that the once infirm woman is younger than she's ever seen her.\r At the Monsignor's house, Bev finds Father Hill mourning Riley; somehow he knew he was gone when he self-immolated.  Bev suggests that perhaps Riley poisoned the well for Crockett's Island, and the wisest way to move forward is to determine who he may have spread the gospel to the previous evening.  Judas, after all, was part of God's plan too.  Tonight, she recommends, they share all that they have with their church, especially since it's Easter, a night of baptism. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Gunning suggests that the people of Crockett's Island may have a disease similar to EPP, which causes which of these to occur?", "correct": "Anemia", "options": ["Delusions of grandeur", "Rabies-like symptoms", "Violent tendencies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnemia.\n\n\tDr. Gunning tells Erin about the blood disorder EPP (erythropoietic protoporphyria).  People with this disorder are often anemic and have a tendency to blister in the sun; whatever this new virus is, it's similar but different.  When Sarah put her mother's and Erin's blood into the sun, this thing burned away, leaving their normal blood behind.  Perhaps Riley had more of this substance in his blood.  It would stand to reason that the substance in Erin's blood may have altered her body and destroyed her baby.  Mildred asks if the body can stop the process, but Sarah doesn't know; perhaps the body can force it out, like alcohol.\r Ed heads to Father Hill's house to find the structure already occupied by Bev, the Scarboroughs, and Sturge, but the priest gives a moment of his time.  Ed admits that he doesn't think Riley is well; the letters he left as amends didn't paint a good picture.  His words are crazy and delusional, and if he has to ask the Sheriff for help, he'll surely be brought back to an institution.  Father Hill agrees-- Riley isn't...wasn't well-- but insists that he doesn't need to assume the worst.  Ed hands over the letters before departing, hoping that all will be alright. \n"}, {"text": "When Erin speaks to Annie, she reveals which of the following?", "correct": "That Riley is dead", "options": ["That they're all infected", "That the Monsignor is on the island", "That she will be burning down the church"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat Riley is dead.\n\n\tErin visits the Flynn household to speak to Annie and put forth an odd request, specifically asking that they accompany her to the mainland for the evening.  Annie apologizes but, unfortunately, they have Easter vigil in the evening.  Annie, however, asks for help.  She's worried about Riley and perhaps if Erin asks him kindly, he'll come home.  Erin tells the truth though-- she says that Riley is dead and his last wish was that his family be safe and off Crockett's Island.  Annie won't hear it, however.  She sends Erin away, refusing to believe her.\r Sarah, meanwhile, heads to the Sheriff's office, suggesting that she too will be heading to the mainland with her findings.  She'll head to the lab to corroborate the evidence and then she'll return to the island with help (and the truth).  All she asks is that he look into St. Patrick's Church. \n"}, {"text": "Sheriff Hassan used to work in which major city's police force?", "correct": "New York City", "options": ["Miami", "Los Angeles", "Washington DC"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York City.\n\n\tSheriff Hassan clues Sarah into the fact that the investigation into St. Patrick's is a lot to ask.  He explains that he moved to Crockett's Island for complicated reasons.  When the towers were hit on 9/11, he went to the mosque for the first time-- he was never religious before then-- and he participated in a blood drive because he wanted to help.  He ended up moving to New York after this, applying for the NYPD and working his way up.  He got married, had his kid, got promoted to help the FBI, and achieved his dreams, but when he started to see what was really going on behind the scenes, he was pushed back and surveilled by other cops for questioning the process.  The NYPD wondered, what if he was a double agent?  When his wife was diagnosed with cancer and passed away, he and Ali got as far away as they could, eventually arriving at Crockett's Island.  He doesn't intimidate or intrude because he needs to belong...and still Bev Keene and others can't look past him.  And yet Sarah wants him to investigate the church.\r Sheriff Hassan asks her to think about the third-hand source of her info-- Riley Flynn, who isn't the most trustworthy person on the island.  All Sarah asks is if the sheriff carries a gun.  He admits he doesn't. \n"}, {"text": "Of these impediments, which of these does the mayor suggest saving until last?", "correct": "Cutting out cell service", "options": ["Disabling the boats", "Cutting out power", "Mandating church service"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCutting out cell service.\n\n\tErin, Sarah, and Mildred make their way to the ferry station to find that the boat isn't there.  Sturge lets the ladies know that the ferry needed to go for repairs; the Mayor asked that it be serviced in the afternoon with the route resuming by morning.  Sarah asks if, in the event of an emergency, she could just ask a fisherman to take them over.  Sturge reminds them that Easter vigil is in the evening.\r As the sun sets, Sheriff Hassan starts to file a missing persons report for Riley before the power cuts out.  When he calls Sturge, he doesn't know that the Mayor has asked the handyman to cut the lines, removing the fuses entirely.  They decide to leave the cell tower until the end of the night.\r Erin, Sarah, and Mildred realize that if the cell towers are lost, they'll be completely cut off, and with water surrounding the island in every direction for thirty miles, there's not much of a hope for escape.  Erin lets the others know it won't stop her from trying to do something; Riley sacrificed everything because he thought she could help.\r As Sheriff Hassan prays by candlelight, he asks Ali to join him.  Ali, however, asks that they join Easter vigil.  There is, after all, a big surprise-- a miracle, they say. \n"}, {"text": "Who of these does not join the procession headed to St. Patrick's Church?", "correct": "Joe", "options": ["Sturge", "Bev", "Warren"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe.\n\n\tBev meets the Scarboroughs at their house, gathering candles and walking up the street with their vigil candles and printed hymns.  Their voices can be heard throughout the town, and by the time they pass by the Gunning household, the ladies inside see that they have amassed most of the people on Crockett's Island.  Reluctantly, they join the group in their procession.\r On the hillside, watching as the group continues to St. Patrick's Church, Sturge cuts power to the cell tower.  None notice as they enter the building and fill out the seats.  When Father Hill enters, following his altar boys, he takes his place at the altar and commences Easter Mass.  Erin, Sarah, Hassan, and Ed Flynn nervously watch, none of them singing along. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Father Hill use as the first townsperson to drink the poisoned communion wine?", "correct": "Sturge", "options": ["Ooker", "Warren", "Bev"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSturge.\n\n\tAs the churchgoers take their seats, Father Hill celebrates their holy day and suggests that they are all in the beginning of a new era.  While they will be celebrating the resurrection, they will be doing so more than anyone ever has.\r He begins with the admission of his sin-- he's lied to them all.  He didn't come to Crockett's Island to fill in for Monsignor Pruitt and the Monsignor has not been in a hospital recovering from illness; he's perfectly healthy.  He was the first to be healed amongst them and he stands before them seeking forgiveness.  An Angel of the Lord bestowed upon him a cure for his ill health and he has brought the Angel to them.  They will all be tested like Jesus.  They will endure death.  And they will fear it but they will overcome and be risen again.\r Father Hill calls Sturge forth as Bev retrieves a chalice from the adjacent room, looking on at the cups of Compound 1080 awaiting their drinkers.  When the priest gives the communion to Sturge to drink, it takes only moments before it affects him.  He dies in Father Hill's arms while the church watches and the priest begs them to wait.\r Sheriff Hassan grabs Ali's hands and makes for the door, but the way is blocked.  The Angel has arrived. \n"}, {"text": "Sheriff Hassan brings a gun into St. Patrick's Church and Mildred is the one to fire it, but at whom?", "correct": "Father Hill", "options": ["Sheriff Hassan", "The Angel", "Bev"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Hill.\n\n\tAs the Angel enters St. Patrick's Church, the people of Crockett's Island recoil in terror and Father Hill urges them not to be afraid.  The creature stands before them at the altar and spreads its wings as Sturge rises from death, taking to his feet and embracing Father Hill, resurrected.  The Scarboroughs take to their feet as well, handing cups of Compound 1080 to the congregation alongside Bev.  Most of them already have the Angel's blood inside them; all they need to do is open their minds and their hearts and take one leap of faith.\r Sheriff Hassan attempts to drag his son from the room, but Ali resists, taking his place by Father Hill's side.  To the surprise of the townspeople, the Sheriff draws a gun and fires it into the air but he's taken down by the other members of the congregation and restrained.  Bev steps forth, thanking Ali for setting an example in front of the others and placing a cup into his hands.  While his father cries, Ali takes the drink, chooses God, and dies in Father Hill's arms.\r The other townspeople follow suit while a small group tries to convince them not to drink the poison.  Mildred, grabbing the discarded gun off the ground, fires it at Father Hill, hitting him in the head before the Angel leaps forth, grabs her, and flies off into the night.  All the while, the congregation dies to be reborn again. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills Bev Keane in the vestibule?", "correct": "Erin", "options": ["Sheriff Hassan", "Annie", "The Angel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErin.\n\n\tBev instructs Sturge to close and lock the doors while she tends to Father Hill, already healing from the gunshot wound taken to the head.  She insists on taking Sheriff Hassan out back as they will all need food; it was all part of Father Hill's plan.  As Ali, the Scarboroughs, and the others who took the communion awaken from their deaths, they begin to feel the overwhelming hunger.\r Erin grabs the gun, dropped on the floor when Mildred was taken by the Angel, while the risen townspeople begin to feed.  Although half of the congregation pools at the locked front door, Sheriff Hassan and Warren are able to escape with Sarah, Erin, Leeza, and Annie, locking themselves into the vestibule during the bloodbath.  They see that Bev has sealed herself into the other side, hiding after having committed the island to its fate.\r Erin shoots Bev dead.  They have, perhaps, five minutes to flee into the night.\r Bev awakens to a quiet church, returning to find the townspeople having awakened from their frenzy.  She asks Sturge to open the doors, much against Father Hill's words, claiming it to be part of God's plans.  While the priest shakes his head from the ground and the townspeople all rise, Sturge opens the doors.  They shall spread the gospel. \n"}]}
