{"id": "338471", "name": "Scoop! Quiz | Food & Drink | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "Food & Drink", "Ice Cream"], "questions": [{"text": "\"That was delicious!  May I have another scoop of that green stuff?\"\n\nWhich of these ice cream flavors is not usually green in color?", "correct": "Butter Pecan", "options": ["Green Tea", "Mint Chocolate Chip", "Pistachio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nButter Pecan.\n\n\tWhile some mint chocolate chip ice creams are white in color, they are often given a green coloring so you know it is mint.  Pistachio ice cream has pieces of pistachio in it and is usually green in color, and green tea ice cream is served in Chinese restaurants and is of a very bright green.  It can be very bitter, too, especially if the green tea used to make the ice cream was steeped too long.  Butter pecan ice cream is usually a light cream color because of the caramel. \n"}, {"text": "I love marshmallows.  Which of these ice creams contains marshmallows?", "correct": "Rocky Road", "options": ["French Salted Caramel", "Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough", "Moosetracks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRocky Road.\n\n\tRocky Road ice cream is made with chocolate ice cream, and it contains nuts and marshmallows in it.  None of the other listed ice creams contain marshmallows, but S'mores ice cream definitely does! \n"}, {"text": "Which flavor of ice cream contains chunks of waffle cone in it?  (American brand)", "correct": "Drumstick", "options": ["Pianokey", "Guitarpick", "Gongmallet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrumstick.\n\n\tDrumstick is a type of Nestl\u00e9 ice cream that is on a cone and covered in chocolate and sometimes nuts.  Drumsticks also have a clump of chocolate at the bottom of the cone; arguably the best part of the drumstick.  Drumstick ice cream is a flavor that contains chunks of waffle cone as well as chocolate and nuts in it, so it is like a crushed Drumstick in a bowl. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these ice creams does not contain caramel in it?", "correct": "Reese's", "options": ["French Salted Caramel", "Dulce de Leche", "Butter Pecan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReese's.\n\n\tReese's is a flavor of ice cream that contains Reese's peanut butter cups in it.  The ice cream is peanut butter and chocolate, not caramel.  Dulce de Leche is a caramel ice cream, and butter pecan contains a bit of caramel swirls in it.  As the name suggests, French salted caramel ice cream is caramel swirled ice cream with chocolate covered salted caramels in it.  Truly delicious! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not something a flavor of classic Neapolitan ice cream comes from?", "correct": "Leaves", "options": ["Cacao pod", "Fruit", "Bean"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeaves.\n\n\tNeapolitan contains chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream.  The chocolate flavoring would come from the cacao pod, the vanilla flavoring comes from the vanilla bean, and the strawberry flavor obviously comes from the strawberry fruit.  None of the flavors in Neapolitan ice cream come from leaves. \n"}, {"text": "There is a flavor of ice cream that contains (American) Girl Scout cookies that are usually found in a green box.  What flavor of ice cream is this?", "correct": "Thin Mint", "options": ["Dulce de Leche", "Samoa", "Tagalong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThin Mint.\n\n\tThin Mint ice cream is mint ice cream with chunks of thin mint cookies in it.  The cookies become soft because of the ice cream, which is much different from the classic snap of a thin mint.  However, the ice cream tastes almost exactly like a fresh thin mint. \n"}, {"text": "What kind of cookie (milk's favorite) is often used in cookies and cream ice cream?", "correct": "Oreos", "options": ["Chips Ahoy", "Snickerdoodles", "Chocolate Chip Cookies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOreos.\n\n\tOreo cookies are often used in some brands of cookies and cream ice cream.  They crush the cookies into the ice cream, and the cookie part gives the ice cream a chocolaty flavor while the cream inside the Oreo supplies the cream part of \"cookies and cream\". \n"}, {"text": "Cake batter ice cream really does have cake batter mixed right in the ice cream.  But what is excluded from the cake batter so people don't get sick?", "correct": "Eggs", "options": ["Sugar", "Flour", "Milk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEggs.\n\n\tCake batter ice cream is made by mixing regular ice cream with cake batter.  Coldstone, an ice cream company, served cake batter ice cream with eggs in it, but later removed the eggs from the flavor because people were getting sick.  Since cake batter is uncooked, the eggs were raw, and thus causing salmonella and other sicknesses.  Most cake batter ice creams contain no eggs for this very reason. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes added to ice cream is a brand of syrup that hardens when it hits the ice cream.  What topping is this called?  (This is an American brand)", "correct": "Magic Shell", "options": ["Hardening Sauce", "Brick Liq-uid", "QuickSyrup"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagic Shell.\n\n\tMagic Shell is a brand of syrup that hardens as it hits the ice cream.  It hardens when in contact with cold, so NEVER put the Magic Shell in the refrigerator.  If you make this mistake, you will learn that the entire bottle hardens; and it cannot be recovered.  Not even microwaving can reverse the effects of refrigeration of the Magic Shell.  Magic Shell comes in many flavors, including turtle, Heath, Reese's, and cupcake (much better than it sounds). \n"}, {"text": "My favorite frozen treat is a flavor that is orange in color.  What could it possibly be?", "correct": "Mango Sorbet", "options": ["Passionfruit Frozen Yogurt", "Lemon Sherbet", "Guava Gelato"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMango Sorbet.\n\n\tSince the mango is an orange fruit, it gives mango sorbet an orange color.  Lemons are yellow, so lemon sherbet would also be yellow.  Guava is a pink fruit with a green skin, but since the inside is used, the gelato would become pink.  Passionfruit is a yellowish fruit that becomes pinkish or even purplish when it is ripe.  Passionfruit frozen yogurt (which is quite tasty, by the way) would thus be pink or purple, and even a dark red, but not orange. \n"}]}
