{"id": "92274", "name": "Oak Island Treasure Mystery #2 Quiz | World | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Global Trivia", " Missing Treasure"], "questions": [{"text": "Captain Kidd, legendary pirate, is often mentioned in connection with the treasure. Whatever happened to him?", "correct": "He was hanged", "options": ["He died in prison", "He disappeared", "He was paroled and given the task of stopping piracy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was hanged.\n\n\tKidd was originally charged with the task of stamping out piracy. Later, however, his purpose got \"altered\". He was imprisoned, hanged -and put on display (as a warning to others). While his pirate sailings\rplace him in the approximate vicinity of Oak Island, it is hard to say with certainty that he was ever there. Be that as it may, buried pirate treasure is a possibility. \n"}, {"text": "Another theory suggests that the treasure may consist of Aztec or Inca gold. What explorers plundered this treasure?", "correct": "Spanish", "options": ["Portuguese", "English", "French"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpanish.\n\n\tSpain was a dominant power in the exploration of the New World. \rPizarro (Peru) and Cortez (Mexico) helped fatten the Spanish treasury\rconsiderably. Ships, however, were known to sink - or beach - for any one of several reasons. Could a ship in trouble have buried the treasure? \n"}, {"text": "It has been suggested that the secret identity of the \"real\" Shakespeare is buried in the \"money pit\". Whose name is most often associated with this theory? ", "correct": "Francis Bacon", "options": ["Christopher Marlowe", "Lord Oxford", "Lord Derby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancis Bacon.\n\n\tTheories abound as to the \"true\" identity of the author of Shakespeare's plays. These four choices are the leading contenders, but Bacon is the name that is often associated with the idea of burying his secret in the money pit. \n"}, {"text": "In connection with the \"Shakespeare theory\", why would the \"real\" author need to conceal his identity?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Concern with his safety", "Lack of prestige involved in writing for the theatre", "Enhancement of freedom of expression"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tCertainly, a man with access to the royal court did not want to be identitifed as a \"lowly\" writer of plays. In addition, there was a safety problem: some of the views expressed in some of the plays may have been unpopular and unwelcome at court. Anonymity (or a pseudonym)\rprovided greater freedom of expression. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following sailors is most often associated with the money pit?", "correct": "Francis Drake", "options": ["Magellan", "John Cabot", "Henry Hudson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancis Drake.\n\n\tDrake was a world class privateer. He plundered - for England, for himself, for adventure. He had wealth, reason to conceal it, time to build a complicated structure, etc. \n"}, {"text": "It has also been suggested that the Templars were responsible for burying the treasure. Who were they?", "correct": "An Order of Knights", "options": ["Members of Royalty", "A Pacifist  Religious Order or Monks", "Wealthy Business Entrepreneurs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn Order of Knights.\n\n\tThe Knights Templar were an order that dated back to the time of the Crusades. They amassed considerable wealth during their heyday, but their fortunes waned in the face of persecution (sparked by greed and envy). What happened to the wealth that they had accumulated? \n"}, {"text": "Another theory suggests that certain crown jewels are buried in the pit. From what country?", "correct": "France", "options": ["England", "Spain", "Portugal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrance.\n\n\tThere is a theory that jewels from the Court of Marie Antoinette may be found in the pit. Possible, I suppose. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these must be considered in considering - and disqualifying - possible builders of the pit?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Scientific Knowledge", "Motive", "Financial Ability"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tWhy would anyone want to build the pit? Who had substantial wealth or\rsecrets that were worthy of such a venture? Who had sufficient money to finance such a project? Moreover, who had the technical knowledge to mastermind the complicated engineering involved in the underwater traps? \n"}, {"text": "What key piece of the puzzle disappeared?", "correct": "Inscription on a Stone", "options": ["Wrecked Ship", "Treasure Map", "Sailor's Diary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInscription on a Stone.\n\n\tThere were stones that were inscribed with symbols - that were ultimately decoded to reveal the existence of treasure below. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is known with certainty?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["When the pit was built", "How the underwater channels were engineered", "How the treasure was going to be retrieved"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tNo one knows anything for certain about the pit - other than the fact that it exists and clearly seems to be man-made. Other than these few facts, it cannot be said for certain what is down there, how it got there, why it was put there, etc. \n"}]}
