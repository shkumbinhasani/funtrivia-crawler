Forster wrote \"A Passage to India\" (which resembles \"Burmese Days\" in some ways, since both authors are critical of British imperialism). \"Keep the Aspidistra Flying\" is a heart-wrenching novel by Orwell, and \"Down and Out in Paris and London\" is a sad but funny memoir about being \"down and out\" in these two cities. \n"}, {"text": "Which children's author wrote the Melendy books (such as \"The Four Story Mistake\") and the Gone-Away Lake books?", "correct": "Elizabeth Enright", "options": ["Beverly Cleary", "Cynthia Voigt", "Irene Hunt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElizabeth Enright.\n\n\tElizabeth Enright is one of my favorite children's authors. She won a Newbery Medal for \"Thimble Summer\". She's warm, witty, and poetic. Her Melendy books (my favorites) take place during the 1940s. (I have a quiz on Enright under For Children under Books for Older Children.) Beverly Cleary writes the Beezus and Ramona books, among many others. Cynthia Voigt wrote a wonderful book for young adults called \"Homecoming\". Its sequel, \"Dicey's Song\", won a Newbery Medal. Irene Hunt won a Newbery Medal for a terrific book called \"Up a Road Slowly\". \n"}, {"text": "Who wrote \"Lucky Jim\"?", "correct": "Kingsley Amis", "options": ["George Orwell", "E.M. Forster", "Thomas Hardy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKingsley Amis.\n\n\t\"Lucky Jim\" is Amis's first novel. It takes place in the early 1950s, and it is laugh-out-loud funny. It's about a hapless young history professor who's stuck with a job he doesn't like, a pompous supervisor whom he despises, and a clingy girlfriend whom he doesn't love (or even like very much). I have tried to read other books of Amis's, but never liked any of them, oddly enough. \n"}, {"text": "Which series did children's author Walter R.
