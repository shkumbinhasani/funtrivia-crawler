He ended up crashing his mom's car into a convenience store to steal an ATM.  As a result of his actions, the team is desperate to find a replacement (or two) so that they have enough people for Sectionals.  Luckily, Sam Evans has joined to pick up the slack. After brief introductions, Will informs them that their project this week will be to sing duets with one another.  In addition, he'll be making this into a competition.  The pair to sing the best duet (put to a vote) would win a dinner for two to Breadstix.  Everyone loves the idea and Kurt decides to try and duet with Sam. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Kurt not claim is one of his traits?", "correct": "His charm", "options": ["His ability to know when hair colour comes from a bottle", "His ability to spot trends in men's fashion", "His voice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis charm.\n\n\tKurt meets up with Sam in the hall at school and introduces himself before welcoming him to New Directions.  He decides to start his conversation with Sam's hair which, he claims, comes straight from a bottle, though Sam denies this.  To make it up to him, Kurt offers to be his duet partner for the competition this week and tells him to learn some male-male duets from the fifties in preparation.\rBrittany wants to sing her duet with Santana and suggests Melissa Etheridge's \"Come to My Window\" while they're making out in Brittany's room.  Santana, on the other hand, doesn't want to think about it.  She wants to spend time with Brittany because Puck's in juvie, but she already has an idea of who she wants to sing with: Mercedes.  Mercedes is initially hesitant to sing with her because they don't really like each other, but they both realize that their voices, together, will be too good to lose. \n"}, {"text": "Whose idea is it to throw the duet competition?", "correct": "Rachel's", "options": ["Finn's", "Kurt's", "Quinn's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel's.\n\n\tFinn talks to Kurt about his intentions with Sam and suggests that he lay off so that Sam will stay with New Directions; they're desperate for a new member, especially with Puck in juvie, and if he and Kurt sing, then he'll get too much flac and leave.  Kurt persists that he won't do any harm.\rLater, Finn and Rachel practice their duet which they believe will be a surefire winner, \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" by Elton John and Kiki Dee.  Rachel is disappointed that they're going to win though; she says it makes her look selfish.  To be a better person, Rachel suggests that they throw the competition so that Sam can win.  This way he'll want to stay in Glee Club.  Finn says that technically her plan does help her in the long-run (since they can win Nationals) but she purposely ignores him. \n"}, {"text": "Sam is able to avoid getting Slushied in the school hallways.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tTina and Mike argue about their performance since Mike rarely sings in Glee Club and he certainly never does solo vocals.  She says that he has to for it to be a real duet and that they really need to win the dinner at Breadstix to have a normal night out.\rMeanwhile, Brittany tells Artie that she's really into him.  The two of them decide to get together for their duet and start dating.  Brittany's intentions become clearer when Santana discovers that this is happening.\rFinn talks to Sam about singing with Kurt and explains that while winning Nationals will make everyone popular, he needs to lay low and avoid singing with another guy to spare himself from humiliation brought on by the other students.  Sam claims that he gave his word though, and he won't go back on it.  When he leaves the locker room, he gets Slushied immediately. \n"}, {"text": "Which Tina Turner duet did Mercedes and Santana perform for their song?", "correct": "River Deep - Mountain High", "options": ["Baby Get It On", "Proud Mary", "(Simply) The Best"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiver Deep - Mountain High.\n\n\tQuinn is the one to help a Slushied Sam clean up in the school washroom.  When he asks why she's a member of New Directions despite being head cheerleader, she says that there's no point in being popular if she can't do what she wants, and she wants to be in Glee Club.\rAt home, Kurt speaks to his dad, who is still recovering from his earlier heart attack (in \"Grilled Cheesus\").  When Kurt mentions the Sam issue, Burt sides with Finn saying that perhaps it's best not to come on too strong with someone who might not take well to the idea.\rMercedes and Santana perform their duet, Ike and Tina Turner's \"River Deep - Mountain High\" in Glee Club the next day and it goes over quite well.  While Sam showers in the locker room later on, Kurt informs him that they will no longer need to be duet partners as he's decided to find someone who better matches his vocal and talent levels.\rSeeing what some of the others are capable of, Rachel and Finn decide that to lose they need a song so bad it's offensive.  They get to work on this. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of New Directions plays the guitar in this episode?", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Mike", "Finn", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tTina approaches Artie for a duet partnership and while he finds her offer kind, he says that he can't because his current partnership with Brittany has blossomed into a romance.  When Will asks the next participants to step up, and Kurt takes the floor alone.  He says he will be doing a duet with himself with a number featured in the stage show \"Victor/Victoria\", \"Le Jazz Hot!\".  Taking to the stage in the auditorium, he pulls off a jazzy performance that's enjoyed by the whole group.\rIn the astronomy classroom, Sam invites Quinn to be his duet partner and he brings his guitar along.  Before she can say no, he invites her to play the chords while he plays the guitar.  Before he can lean in for a kiss, she decides that she can't bring herself to do it and leaves Sam partnerless. \n"}, {"text": "Who ultimately becomes Tina's duet partner?", "correct": "Mike", "options": ["Puck", "Artie", "Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike.\n\n\tMike and Tina are next to do their duet and it turns out that both of them have chosen \"Sing!\" from \"A Chorus Line\" allowing both of them to perform a legitimate duet while Mike can still dance.  Their song also turns out to be quite well-received and everyone congratulates Mike on his first vocal performance.\rThe others find out about Sam trying to kiss Quinn and Rachel and Finn set their plans in motion to make them perform with one another.  While Finn is angry that he tried to kiss her, he still suggests that they perform and Rachel speaks with Quinn by herself saying that in order to top the social pyramid (or at least get close to beating her and Finn) her only chance is with Sam.  Both agree to sing together.\rAt Brittany's house, Artie tries to make things work for their duet but he realizes that he still has feelings for Tina.  To help him get over his ex, Brittany sleeps with him. \n"}, {"text": "Quinn and Sam sing which duet together?", "correct": "\"Lucky\"", "options": ["\"I'm Yours\"", "\"With You I'm Born Again\"", "\"Endless Love\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Lucky\".\n\n\tThe time finally comes for Rachel and Finn's performance and the two of them do a duet of Syreeta Wright and Billy Preston's \"With You I'm Born Again\" dressed as a schoolgirl and Catholic priest.  The whole thing makes everyone uneasy prompting Quinn to say that she wanted to punch both of them while they were singing it.  Will concurs saying that there was little appropriate about their approach.  Rachel and Finn both claim to be shocked and say that they hope it doesn't cost them the competition.\rQuinn and Sam become the final couple to perform and they take to the floor to sing the Jason Mraz/Colbie Caillat song \"Lucky\" with Sam and Quinn sharing the guitar. \n"}, {"text": "Which duo wins the duet competition?", "correct": "Sam and Quinn", "options": ["Kurt and...Kurt", "No one wins- everyone ties", "Santana and Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam and Quinn.\n\n\tArtie tells Brittany that they're no longer partners because he got it on good authority that she was using him for his voice.  She claims that this isn't true- she actually wanted to go to dinner with him at Breadstix so that they could share one long piece of spaghetti like in \"Lady and the Tramp\".  It's too late, though.  Artie already told Mr. Schuester that they were dropping out he says that they shouldn't be together.\rBecause no more performances need be done, the votes are tallied.  While many people vote for themselves in order to win the dinner for two at Breadstix, the winner ultimately turns out to be Sam and Quinn (because Rachel and Finn voted for them).  The other club members are upset and Rachel notices Kurt being quite down. \n"}, {"text": "Who performs an actual duet with Kurt at the end of the episode?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Finn", "Sam", "Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tRachel approaches Kurt in person about his loneliness and she says that the two of them have a lot in common.  She says that New Directions will win Nationals because they have Kurt.  He may feel lonely, but he's not alone.  She also says that she's already picked out a duet for the both of them that has artists both of them love and he agrees to join her.\rAt Breadstix, Sam presents Quinn with some bad jokes and lame impressions and he reveals that he went to an all-boys boarding school (which she isn't surprised by considering his 'flirting').  He commends her for being brave and coming back to McKinley after her last year and says that he knows what it's like to have a secret.  He reveals that before coming to McKinley he wanted to seem cooler, so he did dye his hair (as Kurt somehow knew) using lemon juice.  Quinn thinks it looks cute and puts away their free dinner certificate saying that they won't need it; a gentleman always pays on the first date.\rThe next table over, Brittany sits alone and practices rolling a meatball across a plate with her nose (a la \"Lady and the Tramp\").\rIn the choir room, Kurt and Rachel perform their duet, a mash-up of Judy Garland's \"Get Happy\" and Barbra Streisand's \"Happy Days Are Here Again\". \n"}]}
