The Ravens, Chargers, and Bears all went 13-3, and the Colts and Patriots both went 12-4.  The Raiders brought up the rear with only two wins.  In a long awaited Super Bowl, Chicago fans finally saw their Bears in it, but lost to the Indianapolis Colts 29-17.", "correct": "The Chargers went 14-2 to lead the NFL", "options": ["The Raiders went 10-6 in 2006", "The Bears didn't make it to the Super Bowl", "The Atlanta Falcons won the Super Bowl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Chargers went 14-2 to lead the NFL.\n\n\tThe Chargers not only led the league with their record, but they blasted out 492 offensive points, 65 points more than the Colts and Bears.  While the Chargers allowed only 303 points scored against them in the season, the Ravens were by far more stingy, allowing only 201 points. \n"}, {"text": "Super Bowl III was anticipated to be one of the biggest blowouts in pro football.  It pitted quarterback Bob Griese and the New York Jets against the heavily favored Baltimore Colts and quarterback Johnny Unitas.  After being tired of his underdog status, Griese predicted to worldwide television and guaranteed a victory in that Super Bowl.  The Jets won Super Bowl III, 16-7.", "correct": "The Jets quarterback was Joe Namath", "options": ["The Colts won the Super Bowl 35-10", "Johnny Unitas was the Colts' running back", "The Super Bowl in question was XXIV"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Jets quarterback was Joe Namath.\n\n\tThe 1968 Jets finished the season under Weeb Ewbank at 11-3-0.  The Jets had Namath and Babe Parilli taking the snaps, Matt Snell and Emerson Boozer in the backfield, with Don Maynard and George Sauer via air express.  The head-to-head statistics showed the Colts were more durable and rugged, and lost only to the Browns in week 6, 30-20.  The Colts finished the season at 13-1, before mowing over the Browns 34-0 in the NFL Championship game.  Then came Namath and the Jets to spoil their dream. \n"}, {"text": "Eric Dickerson was a Hall of Fame running back, and was noted for the goggles that he wore.  Rushing for an unheard record of 2904 yards in 1984 with the Rams, he still couldn't help the Rams even into the playoffs.  1987 saw him as a Colt.  He made the Pro Bowl six times.  The hall took Dickerson in 1999.", "correct": "His record was 2105 yards", "options": ["Dickerson was never selected to the Pro Bowl", "The Rams won the Super Bowl in 1984", "Eric never played for the Colts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis record was 2105 yards.\n\n\tThe Rams finished 10-6 in 1984, and even Dickerson couldn't help them.  In a strange trade, Eric went to the Colts in 1987.  He ended his career in Atlanta in 1993, and rushed for 90 touchdowns. \n"}, {"text": "Life could not have been better for the 1972 Miami Dolphins.  Under head coach Jimmy Johnson, the team went a perfect 14-0 with the arm of Bob Griese and the legs of Larry Csonka and Mercury Morris.

Miami went totally undefeated all the way to Super Bowl VII, and defeated the Washington Redskins 14-7.", "correct": "Their coach was Don Shula", "options": ["Their quarterback was Dan Marino", "Csonka rushed for only 894 yards in the season", "Miami defeated the Redskins 55-0 in the Super Bowl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir coach was Don Shula.\n\n\tWith Csonka rushing for 1117 yards, Morris was slighted by hitting the 1000 mark exactly (he was credited after the season with yardage to make 1000).  Jim Kiick was another running back and rushed for 521 yards.  It was mainly Earl Morrall during the season, then Griese came back after injuries to finish the job out.  Four wide receivers caught in double-figures for the season, including Paul Warfield with his 29.  Don Shula retired in 1995 with 328 career wins, breaking the old record set by George \"Papa Bear\" Halas with 318. \n"}, {"text": "The Pittsburgh Steelers ruled the National Football League in the 1970s.  Not only going to four Super Bowls, they won all four with Chuck Knox at the helm of the club.  With Terry Bradshaw taking snaps, Franco Harris in the backfield, and Lynn Swann waving his arms, the Steelers could seemingly do no wrong.  They won Super Bowl IX over Minnesota, X over the Cowboys, then XIII over the Cowboys again, and topped them all off in Super Bowl XIV with a victory over the Rams.

Harris was a rookie in 1972, and Swann joined the club in 1974.  Head coach Chuck Noll was already in place, taking over in 1969.  Noll was their head coach for 23 seasons.  In the 1972 season, the Steelers went 11-3, but were stopped by the Dolphins who stopped everyone.  1973 saw them go 10-4 but couldn't get into the playoffs.  1974 would change everything.  Going 10-3-1, the Steelers found themselves in Super Bowl IX, beating the Vikings 16-6. \n"}, {"text": "The 2004 season seemed to be all about Indianapolis' Peyton Manning, who broke Terry Bradshaw's season record for throwing 49 touchdown passes.  Although the New England Patriots finished 14-2, all eyes were on Manning.  But, it isn't about personal stats as much as how they team finishes.  The Colts never got to the championship game.  They were embarrassed by the Patriots 20-3, then New England went on to win the Super Bowl.", "correct": "The record once belonged to Dan Marino", "options": ["The Colts won the championship game 20-3, then went on to win the Super Bowl", "The Patriots went 3-13 in 2004", "Manning never threw more than 40 TD passes in a season"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe record once belonged to Dan Marino.\n\n\tIn 1984, Marino of the Dolphins smashed George Blanda's TD passing record of 36 set in 1961.

The Patriots won Super Bowl XXXIX over the Eagles, 24-21, for their second consecutive title. \n"}, {"text": "My name is Dan Reeves.  I played my football with the Cowboys as a running back.

Hank Stram, mainly of the Chiefs, lost only 97 career games in his 17 seasons. \n"}, {"text": "Professional football began in 1920 with the APFA.
