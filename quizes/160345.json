{"id": "160345", "name": "Ultimate LOTR - 'Return of the King' Part 3 Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "J. R. R. Tolkien", "The Return of the King"], "questions": [{"text": "The Battle of Pelennor Fields is beginning to look hopeless, even despite the battle being joined by the Riders of Rohan.   Th\u00e9oden has been killed under his horse, and his sister-daughter \u00c9owyn, the prince Faramir and the hobbit Merry have all been felled in battle.  Just when all seemed desperately hopeless, some ships are seen in the distance on the river Anduin.  The men of Gondor are disheartened when they discover that the ships belong to the Corsairs of what land?  ", "correct": "Umbar", "options": ["Eriador", "Rhudaur", "Khand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUmbar.\n\n\tAh, but they would not be disheartened for long.  Though the ships are those of the Corsairs of Umbar, a land to the south that has been a traditional enemy of Gondor, they are captained by none other than one of our heroes...Aragorn! \n"}, {"text": "Gloom turns to glee when it is discovered that the apparent ships of the enemy turn out to be captained by Aragorn, and are carrying his men to join the battle at Pelennor Fields.  The men of Gondor know it is Aragorn at the helm of the flagship when the ship's standard unfurls, revealing what symbol?  ", "correct": "The white tree", "options": ["The white tower", "The white mountain", "The white city"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe white tree.\n\n\tThe White Tree of Gondor, called Telperion, was apparently planted at Minas Tirith by a distant ancestor of Aragorn.  Later in the story, Aragorn goes with Gandalf on a hike up Mindolluin, the mountain behind the city of Minas Tirith, and they discover a sapling.  Both agree that it is a scion of Nimloth (the original white tree), and Aragorn brings the sapling back to Minas Tirith in order to plant it next to the dead and withered Telperion. \n"}, {"text": "Denethor, Steward of Gondor, greets Aragorn at the aftermath of the battle of the Pelennor Fields, and bestows upon him the throne of Gondor.  ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDenethor, long since turned mad from the death of his first son Boromir, and the apparant death of his younger son Faramir, decides that life is no longer worth living.  He immolates himself upon the pyre that he had prepared for himself and Faramir, thus relinquishing by default his stewardship, which passes to his son Faramir, who, happily, is far from dead.  Later, Faramir would wholeheartedly relinquish his stewardship when he returns to health and is met by Aragorn.  Aragorn very graciously declines, for a time, and when he does accept the kingship, he allows Faramir to continue with the title Steward. \n"}, {"text": "While Faramir and friends continuing to convalesce at the Houses of Healing, Gandalf, Aragorn and the other chief members of the war party meet there to discuss the coming confrontation with the forces of Sauron at the gates of Mordor.  Who does Aragorn say should 'rule us all', and lead the forces of good against Mordor?  ", "correct": "Gandalf", "options": ["Himself", "\u00c9omer", "Imrahil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGandalf.\n\n\tAragorn very modestly claims himself to simply be the Captain of the D\u00fanedain of Arnor, and that Gandalf is the most competent to lead the collected forces of good against Sauron's evil hordes.  All seem in agreement at this wise decision by the soon to be King of Gondor. \n"}, {"text": "Ioreth, a wise old woman who works in the Houses of Healing, attempts to care for Merry, Faramir and \u00c9owyn, but claims that only the rightful king can heal such wounds.  She then identifies that Aragorn could be the healer that our friends need.  Aragorn is well aware of this old tale, and immediately gets to work in the healing process.  What is the name of the plant he needs to make a remedy for his friends' wounds?  ", "correct": "Athelas", "options": ["Hithlain", "Lebethron", "Nicotiana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAthelas.\n\n\tAthelas is also known as kingsfoil, a name that Ioreth knows well.  Unfortunately, the Houses of Healing don't have a supply of the herb, which Aragorn also calls as\u00eba aranion.  Happily, the young boy Bergil returns with a small amount of the plant after Aragorn dispatches several people to locate some. \n"}, {"text": "Aragorn is called by many names in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but by what name is he called by the people of Minas Tirith after the word goes through the city that 'The King is come again'?  ", "correct": "Elfstone", "options": ["Telcontar", "Strider", "Estel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElfstone.\n\n\tThe people of Minas Tirith call Aragorn 'Elfstone' after the green stone that he wears.  The Elven translation of the name 'Elfstone' is 'Elessar', and he later chooses the reign name Elessar Telcontar (Telcontar is a translation of 'Strider').  This name was prophesied at his birth. \n"}, {"text": "Gandalf and Aragorn develop a plan to confront the forces of Mordor at the very gates of the evil land.  They do this knowing full well that they are hopelessly outnumbered, and will very possibly not survive the battle against the massively superior forces of Sauron.  ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAccording to Gandalf, 'without [the ring] we cannot by force defeat [Sauron's] force'.  Later in his speech he suggests that they may well perish in the battle, but that they must make such a sacrifice in order to distract Sauron's eye away from Frodo and Sam's awful task.  In other words, Gandalf, Aragorn and all of the forces under them, are to be used as bait! \n"}, {"text": "With a force of how many men do Gandalf, Aragorn, Imrahil, \u00c9omer and the other leaders of the forces of good set out to confront Sauron and his minions of evil at the 'black gate' of Mordor?  ", "correct": "7,000", "options": ["15,000", "12,000", "10,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n7,000.\n\n\tThe total force contains 1,000 mounted cavalry and 6,000 infantrymen.  It seems so ridiculous that Imrahil is obliged to exclaim that 'this is the greatest jest in all the history of Gondor!'  Later, another 1,000 men would leave the vanguard force in fear; Aragorn is very compassionate, and dispatches those in fear to Cair Andros to create a rearguard force. \n"}, {"text": "The undersized force of Gondor finally makes its way to the great black gates of Mordor.  Trumpets are sounded at the imposing gates, and the forces of Mordor are called out to confront the brave detachment of the Gondorian army.  Which of these is a name for the black gates that they now confront?  ", "correct": "Morannon", "options": ["Gorgoroth", "Dagerlad", "Isenmouth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorannon.\n\n\tThe response to the intrepid challenge by our audacious friends is a thunderous drumming and a great shrieking of horns followed by the opening of the middle gate.  From this vacuous chasm emerges the 'Mouth of Sauron' followed by his evil lieutenants to confront Aragorn and friends.  The battle will soon begin. \n"}, {"text": "Before the battle between throngs of Mordor and the valorous outfit of Gondor, the 'Mouth of Sauron' reveals that some of Frodo's and Sam's effects have been captured, stunning Gandalf and his party.  The 'Mouth' then names Sauron's terms for the surrender of Gondor.  Which of these is not one of the terms?  ", "correct": "Aragorn shall remain in Gondor, slave to Sauron and lieutenant of the forces of Mordor", "options": ["The rabble of Gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw at once beyond the Anduin", "West of the Anduin as far as the Misty Mountains and the Gap of Rohan shall be tributary to Mordor", "All lands east of the Anduin shall be Sauron's forever, solely"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAragorn shall remain in Gondor, slave to Sauron and lieutenant of the forces of Mordor.\n\n\tGandalf rejects the terms outright, believing that if Sam and Frodo had been captured, their bodies would have been presented for them to view.  As it stands, he takes the risk that the two hobbits are alive and continuing with their terrible quest.  The die has been cast; now the final battle begins!
