All the other bits of words I threw together to make \"midcalc\", \"approxsuppose\" and \"conjectimate\" contain parts of words meaning \"guess\" or \"calculate\" probably didn't fool you. This just shows that, though \"guestimate\" is an ugly word, you do know it. \n"}, {"text": "Technical words being blended can often lead to new words for familiar devices.
