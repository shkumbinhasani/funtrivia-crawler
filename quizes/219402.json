{"id": "219402", "name": "St. Peter's Fair Quiz | Authors | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors L-P", " Ellis Peters"], "questions": [{"text": "The story opens in the days leading up to St. Peter's Fair, a time when merchants from all over England and Wales sell their wares as guests of the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul. This year, the citizens of Shrewsbury are unhappy, and they complain to the abbot. Why?", "correct": "They want a share of the proceeds from the fair.", "options": ["They hate strangers and want the fair to be canceled.", "They think it's sacrilegious for a holy monastery to be involved in a money-making enterprise.", "They are unhappy with the merchants whom the abbey has invited; they demand a wider selection of goods."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey want a share of the proceeds from the fair.\n\n\tThe previous summer, there was no St. Peter's Fair because the city of Shrewsbury -- then loyal to Empress Maud -- was under siege by King Stephen. (The siege and its aftermath are described in \"One Corpse Too Many,\" the second chronicle of Brother Cadfael.) The townspeople are now stuck with the bill for the damage to the city walls and to the streets, and they appeal to Abbot Radulfus (whose abbey remained neutral and sustained no damage) to share the money with them for repairs. The Abbot refuses, not wanting to alter the terms of their longstanding charter. \n"}, {"text": "On the evening before the fair, Brother Cadfael is sent to translate for one of the more important merchants. What language, relatively rare in Shrewsbury, does he speak?", "correct": "Welsh", "options": ["Gaelic", "French", "Greek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWelsh.\n\n\tBrother Cadfael grew up in Wales, spent his youth traveling the world as a crusader and mercenary, and retired to the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul as an \"old man\" in his fifties. He is now the monk in charge of the abbey's herb gardens and healing potions, but he is often called upon to translate since Shrewsbury is near the Welsh border. The merchant he's translating for on this occasion is a very canny man named Rhodri ap Huw. \n"}, {"text": "Several aggrieved youngsters from the town come to the wharf to plead their case to the merchants unloading their wares. One merchant, Thomas of Bristol, comes to blows with the youths' leader. What is the name of this young shoemaker, son of the town's provost?", "correct": "Philip Corviser", "options": ["Ivo Corbi\u00e8re", "Turstan Fowler", "Rhodri ap Huw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhilip Corviser.\n\n\tIt isn't really poor Philip's fault that the encounter turns physical: he lays a hand on Thomas's shoulder, intending only to speak to him further about Shrewsbury's financial problems, but Thomas interprets it as a threat and strikes him so hard with his staff that the boy falls dazed to the cobblestones. Seeing this, Philip's friends start fighting with the merchants, and soon there's a full-scale riot complete with valuable goods being thrown into the Severn River. The sheriff's men, coming to break things up, are not terribly sympathetic to the young men of Shrewsbury. \n"}, {"text": "Thomas of Bristol has a beautiful niece and heiress, Emma Vernold, who turns heads wherever she goes. It is she who comes to Cadfael, and to his friend Hugh Beringar the deputy sheriff, when her uncle is late coming home on the night before the fair. Where is her uncle's body found the next morning?", "correct": "In the Severn River", "options": ["Locked inside his own booth at the fair", "In a narrow passage between booths at the fair", "Balanced in the lower branches of a tree"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the Severn River.\n\n\tCadfael, Hugh, Ivo, and several other men spend the night looking for Thomas, even though they think that Emma is probably worried over nothing. Early the next morning, however, a group of merchants sailing up to Shrewbury fish Thomas's nude body out of the river. A dagger wound is visible on his body, and Hugh and Cadfael have themselves a case of murder. \n"}, {"text": "Without her uncle to chaperone her on their barge, and with a murderer about, Emma clearly cannot stay on the ship. Who takes her as a guest, for her protection?", "correct": "Deputy Sheriff Hugh Beringar and his lady, Aline", "options": ["Abbot Radulfus", "The Corviser family", "Sheriff Gilbert Prestcote and his lady, Isabelle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeputy Sheriff Hugh Beringar and his lady, Aline.\n\n\tEmma is nervous about staying on the barge alone, since one of her uncle's servants (a man named Roger Dod) loves her unrequitedly and she fears for her safety. Hugh and Aline, themselves guests of the abbey, are happy to take her in. Emma repays their hospitality with witty conversation and by embroidering beautiful clothes for the baby Aline is expecting. \n"}, {"text": "The mystery deepens when Emma's uncle's barge is broken into and searched, a fact she discovers in Cadfael's presence. What does she claim was stolen?", "correct": "a small metal clasp and a pair of embroidered gloves", "options": ["the mermaid figurehead of the ship", "a portrait of her uncle and a bag of gold coins", "a stack of fine linens"], "explanation": "\n\n\na small metal clasp and a pair of embroidered gloves.\n\n\tEmma had returned to the barge, in Cadfael's company, in order to get her clothes and personal items for her stay with Hugh and Aline. He is on deck when she realizes that the barge has been searched, and in her initial excitement she tells him immediately that nothing has been taken. After a careful search of her belongings she reports that the clasp and gloves are missing, but Cadfael -- remembering her initial statement -- suspects that they never existed in the first place. \n"}, {"text": "In the midst of all this tragedy, love blooms. The provost's son, under suspicion of murdering her uncle, is clearly in love with Emma. She is also being genteelly courted by a nobleman staying at the abbey, a handsome man of what name?", "correct": "Ivo Corbi\u00e8re", "options": ["Adam Courcelle", "Hugh Beringar", "Gilbert Prestcote"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIvo Corbi\u00e8re.\n\n\tAline is very excited for Emma: a nobleman like Ivo, with several manors, would be an impressive catch for a shopkeeper's daughter! And Ivo does make Emma's heart flutter. But she can't help but feel that it's strange, for a nobleman to court below his social class; he's simply too good to be true. It turns out that she's right to be suspicious. \n"}, {"text": "Thomas of Bristol's booth is ransacked; the thieves take only the strongbox. Brother Cadfael begins to suspect that Emma knows exactly what they're looking for, a suspicion confirmed when she slips away one morning to make contact with the person she's supposed to hand the item over to. But her contact is found murdered. Who was he?", "correct": "Euan of Shotwick, the glover", "options": ["Martin Bellecote, the carpenter", "Rhodri ap Huw, the Welsh trader", "Wat the innkeeper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEuan of Shotwick, the glover.\n\n\tCadfael had thought that Euan might be the contact, since it was so strange that Emma should have thought of gloves back in the barge -- although it was the heat of summer. It suggested that a glover might be on her mind. But he didn't foresee that Euan would be killed overnight in his own booth at the fair. Emma is present when his body is discovered, and she becomes very distraught. Who can blame her? Death seems to follow in her path. \n"}, {"text": "Examining the crime scene, Cadfael realizes that the latest victim managed to wound his attacker, a fact which allows them to track him down. In whose employ is the murderer?", "correct": "Ivo Corbi\u00e8re", "options": ["Abbot Radulfus", "Hugh Beringar", "Gilbert Prestcote"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIvo Corbi\u00e8re.\n\n\tThe murderer is a man named Ewald, a groom for Ivo Corbi\u00e8re; Cadfael discovers his identity from his apprentice, Brother Mark, who treated Ewald's wound. Cadfael confronts Ewald in the abbey stables, accompanied by Hugh, Ivo, and Ivo's armsman Turstan Fowler. Ewald makes a run for it, stealing Ivo's horse (knocking Ivo down in the process); Turstan shoots him down with a crossbow on Ivo's orders, killing him instantly. But Cadfael suspects that the situation may be more complicated than it first appears ... \n"}, {"text": "It's a good thing Emma is level-headed, because she ends up face-to-face with the man who plotted her uncle's murder and is now willing to murder her in order to get what object?", "correct": "A letter to Earl Ranulf, listing the important noblemen who have secretly taken Maud's side in the civil war", "options": ["An ancient mask made of pure gold", "A letter to King Stephen, revealing the location of treasure buried by King Arthur", "A letter to Earl Ranulf, divulging insider trading information that could make a man rich"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA letter to Earl Ranulf, listing the important noblemen who have secretly taken Maud's side in the civil war.\n\n\tBefore Cadfael realizes that Ivo must be involved in the murders, the nobleman has offered to escort Emma home to Bristol, and they are well on their way before the forces of the law realize what is happening. While Cadfael, Hugh, and Philip follow their hours-old trail on horseback, Emma is trapped with Ivo in a locked room of his manor. He wants the letter so that he can give it to Stephen and be rewarded with additional lands and titles; Emma hasn't chosen sides in the civil war, but can't stand the thought of more people dying to serve Ivo's greed. She manages to drop the letter into a burning brazier; when Ivo tries to rescue it from the flame, she overturns it, setting the room (and Ivo) on fire and ensuring the destruction of the letter. Philip, in hot pursuit, breaks through the door and drags her from the room in time to save her from death; Ivo is not so fortunate.\r I hope you've enjoyed this quiz. Cadfael, sometimes aided by Hugh, goes on to solve many more medieval mysteries -- check your local library! \n"}]}
