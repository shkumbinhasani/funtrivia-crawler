He just couldn't see Burr as the constantly losing District Attorney Hamilton Burger. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the character played by William Hopper?", "correct": "Paul Drake", "options": ["Hamilton Burger", "Sergeant Holcombe", "Lieutenant Tragg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul Drake.\n\n\tWilliam Hopper was the son of the legendary gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. In another strange twist in the more modern \"Perry Mason\" series the actor who played \"Paul Drake Junior\", William Katt, was the son of actress Barbara Hale who played Della Street. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the actor who played the ever unsuccessful District Attorney Hamilton Burger?", "correct": "William Talman", "options": ["Paul Picerni", "Roger Smith", "Gary Collins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Talman.\n\n\tWilliam Talman once incurred the wrath of Erle Stanley Gardner by complaining about the way he never won a case. Later Talman became famous when, finding that he was dying of lung cancer, he was one of the first actors to speak out publically against the tobacco industry. \n"}, {"text": "What is the first name of Lieutenant Tragg, the chief police detective in the series?", "correct": "Arthur", "options": ["Ray", "David", "Albert"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArthur.\n\n\tThe actor who played this part was Ray Collins who was a veteran of many cinema films.

This was for two reasons. As stated it was more dramatic to have the real murderer confess. Secondly it was cheaper for CBS to have the case decided at a \"preliminary\" or \"evidential\" hearing. This only needed a judge and so they didn't have to pay 12 actors to be jurors. \n"}, {"text": "What was unusual about the episode entitled \"The Case of the Deadly Verdict\"?", "correct": "It begins with Perry Mason losing a murder case.", "options": ["Perry Mason proposes marriage to Della Street", "Burr plays both Mason and the murderer", "Paul Drake nearly dies from a gunshot wound."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt begins with Perry Mason losing a murder case.\n\n\tOne of the chief executives on the show Gail Jackson released statements to the press about Mason's failure at the beginning of the 1963-64 season so that new interest would be stimulated in the show. Mason did lose other cases such as \"The Case of the Terrified Typist\" but his client is always found innocent in the end. \n"}, {"text": "\"Perry Mason\" was shown by the CBS network and so NBC, the rival network, responded by showing which cowboy series about a wealthy family in Nevada at the same time?", "correct": "Bonanza", "options": ["The Outlaws", "The Big Valley", "Have Gun, Will Travel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonanza.\n\n\tOriginally \"Perry Mason\" was up against Perry Como and the famous singer's show was rescheduled.Much later when \"Bonanza\" began to be shown in colour against the black and white \"Perry Mason\" it was the lawyer that started to lose out. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following leading Hollywood actors appeared in the episode entitled \"The Case of the Treacherous Toupee\"?", "correct": "Robert Redford", "options": ["Burt Reynolds", "Adam West", "Leonard Nimoy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Redford.\n\n\tThe other three actors all appeared in other episodes of the famous show as did Barbara Eden, Jerry Van Dyke, Jim Davis, Angie Dickinson and many others. \n"}, {"text": "Who played the judge in the final televised episode \"The Case of the Final Fadeout\"?", "correct": "Erle Stanley Gardner", "options": ["Gail Patrick", "Ronald Reagan", "Burt Reynolds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErle Stanley Gardner.\n\n\tBecause the story was about a television show there were many glimpses \"backstage\" during the episode and thus there are some shots of the original crew. An attempt to revive the show with Monte Markham in 1973 failed and Raymond Burr returned in 1985. His main requirement was that Barbara Hale be hired again to play Della. \n"}]}
