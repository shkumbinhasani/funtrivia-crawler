{"id": "378753", "name": "\"Up Go the Flaps, Down Go the Wheels\" - Nazareth Trivia Game | Music | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music L-P", "Nazareth"], "questions": [{"text": "The band that was eventually to become Nazareth was initially called the Shadettes.  In which Scottish town or city were the Shadettes founded?", "correct": "Dunfermline", "options": ["Nairn", "Stirling", "Edinburgh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDunfermline.\n\n\tThe Shadettes were formed in the town of Dunfermline by bass guitarist Pete Agnew during 1961.  Dunfermline, once the royal capital of Scotland, is situated in the former historic county of Fife which lies between the firths of the rivers Tay and Forth.  Initially the band were forced to play cover versions of songs from the UK Top Thirty Chart, as were many others; ballroom owners and music promoters were more interested in attracting paying customers, having 'bums on seats', than they were in helping to develop new, original acts playing their own material. Bands had no choice but to comply with this rule if they wanted to be paid for performing. Incidentally, although he wasn't born in Scotland, adopted son Stuart Adamson of rock band Big Country had his childhood home just a mile or so outside of Dunfermline. \n"}, {"text": "By 1963 Pete Agnew had been joined by musician Darrell Sweet who had replaced original Shadettes member, Alan Fraser.

In 1965 they were joined by vocalist Dan McCafferty.  The last member to complete the classic Nazareth line-up was Manny Charlton who joined in 1968 after the departure of the Shadettes original guitarist, Bryan Brady. \n"}, {"text": "At the beginning of 1970, the band line-up, as it was to remain for the next twenty years, was complete.  The band agreed that the Shadettes name was no longer suitable and, after making a selection from a tourist guide, the name 'Nazareth' was agreed upon.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe choice of band name had nothing at all to do with tourist guides.  The new name was decided upon after the band, who had been relaxing in a hotel bar overheard the song 'The Weight' by US rock group The Band being played over the hotel's sound system, the name Nazareth appearing in the first line of that song's lyric. \n"}, {"text": "For a number of years Nazareth's financial backing was provided by Perth millionaire, Bill Fehilly.  Clickety-click; from which form of entertainment or leisure pursuit had Fehilly amassed his fortune?", "correct": "Bingo", "options": ["Bookmaking", "Hotels", "Sports promotion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBingo.\n\n\tBill Fehilly had made his millions as a bingo hall owner and games promoter.  On the evening of the 27th of July 1976, the Piper Aztec aircraft in which he was travelling had taken off from Blackpool Airport in Lancashire and was due to transport him and five other passengers and crew to Perth in Scotland... It never arrived. The aircraft suffered a catastrophic engine failure just after it had entered the airspace over southern Scotland.  The aircraft hit a hillside near the town of Moffat in Dumfries and Galloway with all six on board perishing in the impact and intense fire that reduced the aircraft to ash. Sadly, Fehilly's 11 year old son Liam also died in the crash. \n"}, {"text": "Through hard work and extensive touring during the early 1970s Nazareth had built up a solid fan base and in 1973 their first big success, the album 'Razamanaz', was released.  This studio recording was produced by which bass playing member of rock band 'Deep Purple'?", "correct": "Roger Glover", "options": ["Jon Hiseman", "Jon Lord", "Ritchie Blackmore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoger Glover.\n\n\tThis album, Nazareth's third, was the band's breakthrough recording and provided them with two big selling hit singles.  The band had called on Roger Glover to produce the album for them whilst touring with Deep Purple.  Glover would go on to produce three albums for Nazareth; 'Razamanaz', 'Loud 'N' Proud' later that same year and 'Rampant' which was released in May 1974.  After the departure of Glover, production duties for the band were taken over by guitarist, Manny Charlton. \n"}, {"text": "Which single, one of two taken from the album 'Razamanaz', attained the number nine  position on the British singles chart and enjoyed a chart run for a total of eleven weeks?", "correct": "Broken Down Angel", "options": ["Vigilante Man", "Tattoo'd Lady", "Burn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBroken Down Angel.\n\n\tThe single 'Broken Down Angel' was released in April 1973 and remains the band's highest placed single release.  The other single release from 'Razamanaz' was the ribald song 'Bad, Bad, Boy' which reached a singles chart highest position of number ten and which spent a total of nine weeks on the chart.  Both songs remain hugely popular with Nazareth fans today and are still among the band's most often requested during their live shows. The distinctly bluesy 'Vigilante Man', which also appeared on 'Razamanaz', is one of this authors favourite Nazareth tracks.  'Burn' is a song and an album of the same name by great British rockers Deep Purple and 'Tattoo'd Lady' was a popular song composed by Irish blues guitar legend, Rory Gallagher. \n"}, {"text": "Which song, covered by Nazareth, so impressed its original writer that it was later reported that she considered it to be a Nazareth song and not one of her own?", "correct": "This Flight Tonight", "options": ["Please, Mr. Postman", "Because the Night", "Me and Bobby McGee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThis Flight Tonight.\n\n\tAppearing on Nazareth's 1973 album 'Loud 'N Proud', the song 'This Flight Tonight' was a great success for the band achieving the number eleven spot on the UK singles chart , the number one spot in Germany and twenty-seventh position on the Canadian chart.  The song, which had been written by folk and pop artist Joni Mitchell, saw the light of day for the first time on her 1971 album 'Blue'.  In 2007 after a long and distinguished career, Mitchell released her last album of original songs and announced her intention to quit touring. \n"}, {"text": "In which large country in the western hemisphere, has Nazareth enjoyed their greatest success earning an impressive tally of gold records?", "correct": "Canada", "options": ["Mexico", "Brazil", "Spain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanada.\n\n\tWith the exception of a brief period in the early 1970s when they enjoyed their chart success, Nazareth has been largely overlooked by music fans on this side of the Atlantic.  However, in Canada the band have enjoyed some huge success having achieved gold or platinum record status with every album release between 1973 and 1981; a total of eleven recordings! \n"}, {"text": "The recording of the album 'No Mean City', the bands offering of 1979, saw Nazareth joined by a guitarist noted for his unusual stage make-up.

Cleminson remained with Nazareth for two years after leaving the SAHB and during that time he contributed greatly to the band's darker and heavier sound; a sound that can be heard on 'No Mean City'.  After leaving Nazareth in 1980, Cleminson started his own band, the wonderfully named Tandoori Cassette which proved unsuccessful and was short lived project. \n"}, {"text": "In 1999 the band were stunned by the sudden death of drummer Darrell Sweet who had passed away after suffering from which medical condition?", "correct": "Heart attack", "options": ["Prostate cancer", "Aortic Aneurism", "Cirrhosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeart attack.\n\n\tShortly after the release of the album 'Boogaloo' in 1998, Nazareth embarked upon a tour of the US and Canada in order to follow up on the success of the album in Europe.  On the 30th of April 1999, as the band arrived at the venue for the first concert of the tour, drummer Darrell Sweet was taken ill.  As he was being helped from the tour bus by paramedics he suffered a massive heart attack and was declared dead a short time later. The death of Sweet had a profound impact on the other band members and they returned home to Scotland to take stock and to decide on which direction the band should take after this tragedy. \n"}, {"text": "Nazareth has been cited as an influence on both the music and careers of which late 1980s rock mega-stars from the west coast of the United States?", "correct": "Guns 'n Roses", "options": ["M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce", "Aerosmith", "Van Halen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuns 'n Roses.\n\n\tReporter Tom Russell of Metal Hammer magazine, wrote in an interview that on one occasion whilst Guns 'n Roses were on tour in the United Kingdom he visited them in their hotel room.   The music that they were playing on their entertainment system was Nazareth's greatest hits album.  It was also reported that whilst Nazareth were touring the United States, members of Guns attended each of their seven Californian concerts. Nazareth received a request from Guns 'n Roses vocalist Axl Rose to play a set at his wedding and although the band turned his request down, Guns 'n Roses complimented Nazareth by recording a cover version of the Nazareth song 'Hair of the Dog' on their 1993 covers album 'The Spaghetti Incident'. \n"}, {"text": "In January 1989 the band released the album that was to contribute largely to the departure of one of the band's stalwarts, guitarist Manny Charlton.  What was the name of this album, the last upon which the four original band members worked together?", "correct": "Snakes and Ladders", "options": ["Chess", "Cluedo", "Sorry!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnakes and Ladders.\n\n\tThe album 'Snakes and Ladders' along with their previous work, the 1986 release 'Cinema', are considered to be the worst in the Nazareth canon. The recording of this album, the band's seventeenth in the studio, took place during a difficult period for the band; so much so that Manny Charlton, who had been with Nazareth for twenty two years, departed for good. The album 'Cinema' had been met with such a poor response that a number of live shows had to be cancelled due to almost non-existent ticket sales.  Just to make matters worse, Rolling Stone magazine published a recommendation that the band call it a day on their careers!  It's just a thought, but could Nazareth have been the real inspiration behind Spinal Tap? \n"}, {"text": "With the departure of Manny Charlton, a young musician who had spent a short tenure with the band a few years previously was re-appointed as Charlton's permanent replacement.  Who was this young guitarist?", "correct": "Billy Rankin", "options": ["Jim Steinman", "Scott Gorham", "Stuart Adamson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly Rankin.\n\n\tBilly Rankin had first joined Nazareth in 1981 shortly after the release of the album 'The Fool Circle'.  It was at this point that Nazareth with the recruitment of keyboard player John Locke recorded their highly successful double live album 'Snaz' which featured covers of songs by J.J. Cale and ZZ Top.  Rankin left Nazareth in 1983 in order to pursue a solo career with John Locke leaving that same year due to personal issues with the band's manager, Jim White. Rankin was again asked to join Nazareth after Charlton's departure and the band embarked on a tour of the US and Europe shortly afterwards. After contributing to the band for five years, Rankin left again due to personality issues within the band. \n"}, {"text": "Although the tragic death of Darrell Sweet came as an immense shock to Nazareth, his friends took only a relatively short time to appoint his replacement; that replacement was Darrell Sweet's son, Lee.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLee Agnew, the son of Nazareth bass player Pete Agnew, was appointed to take Sweet's place in the band.  Lee Agnew had always been a favourite of Darrell's in addition to being a very fine drummer in his own right.  The band decided that it would be a fitting tribute to Sweet to fill his shoes with someone that he had held in high esteem on a personal level. Whilst the young Agnew was growing up he had often accompanied the band on tour; this gave him the advantage of being completely familiar with the band's live set.  Lee Agnew is also a talented songwriter and his contribution to the band in this area in recent years has been considerable. \n"}, {"text": "After a total of forty-three years fronting Nazareth, vocalist Dan McCafferty was forced to retire from performing live after being diagnosed with a debilitating illness.

At the time the band had seriously considered giving up altogether but, after a period of intensive auditioning for his replacement, the band settled on singer Carl Sentence who was at that time touring with the Classic Rock Show and who had also previously toured with bands such as Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. \n"}]}
