{"id": "261247", "name": "\"Boy\" - Part 2 Quiz | Dahl, Roald | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "Dahl, Roald", "Boy"], "questions": [{"text": "What time of day was letter writing time?", "correct": "Sunday morning", "options": ["Saturday evening", "Sunday evening", "Saturday morning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSunday morning.\n\n\tOn Sunday mornings Dahl and his classmates would be paraded into a hall to write a letter to their parents. However, the masters censored what was written in the letters so that the boys did not speak ill of the school or say that they were being mistreated. Dahl thoroughly enjoyed this practice and continued to write weekly to his mother up until her death (Dahl was in his 20s). His mother filed these letters and when Dahl returned home he was able to see everything he wrote over a period of more than 10 years. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the Latin master who was caught in an embrace with the matron?", "correct": "Victor Corrado", "options": ["Alfred Borgetti", "John Smithstein", "Christopher Hardcastle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictor Corrado.\n\n\tDahl struggled with Latin and it is therefore rarely mentioned in the book.

In those days there weren't any requirement for training and tests to get your license and she was therefore quite inexperienced. The children had watched excitedly as the speed dial crept over 30mph and continued rising. However the ancient half-sister panicked as they reached a tight bend and lost control of the car. Most of the family escaped unscathed but Roald went through the windscreen and almost cut off his nose. \n"}, {"text": "What simile does Dahl use to describe Captain Hardcastle's hair?", "correct": "Like a ripe orange", "options": ["Like a rusty nail", "Like a blooming flower", "Like barbed wire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLike a ripe orange.\n\n\tCaptain Harcastle had been in the army during the war and he kept his title of Captain.

Dahl comments on Ellis' bravery for such a little boy. \n"}, {"text": "What was the occupation of the manly lover?", "correct": "Doctor", "options": ["Grocer", "RAF pilot", "Blacksmith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoctor.\n\n\tThe Norwegian holiday was usually a time for family but one year the ancient half-sister brought along her manly lover, a doctor. The rest of the family disapproved of the way they spent so much time alone and not swimming with the rest of the family. One time when they (half-sister and manly lover) went off for a swim Dahl had an ingenious plan. He concealed some shaved goat's droppings amongst the manly lover's tobacco. When the manly lover returned for a smoke of his pipe, he was left choking on the fumes of goat's tobacco. \n"}, {"text": "Why did Dahl choose to go to Repton over Marlborough?", "correct": "Easier to say", "options": ["Closer to his family", "Nearer to church", "Further away from his family"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEasier to say.\n\n\tWhen Dahl's mother asked him which public school he would like to go to out of Repton and Marlborough he chose Repton because it was easier to say. He recognised that they were both very good schools but for readers it would have been interesting to see life at Marlborough in comparison to the evil Boazers at Repton. \n"}, {"text": "What was the alternative to \"4 strokes with the dressing gown on\"?", "correct": "3 with it off", "options": ["2 with it off", "5 with it off", "1 with it off"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3 with it off.\n\n\tIf you did anything wrong during the night at Repton you had to report straight to the headmaster for the cane. When you arrived he would ask you whether you would like 4 strokes of the cane with the dressing gown on, or 3 with it off. The common idea among the students was that the dressing gown provided some protection so it was preferable to have 4 with it on. \n"}, {"text": "What position did Dahl's headmaster later take up?", "correct": "Archbishop of Canterbury", "options": ["Prime Minister", "Member of parliament", "Headmaster at Marlborough"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArchbishop of Canterbury.\n\n\tDahl comments on how he finds it difficult to understand how a man who relentlessly beats little boys with a strip of wood could be able to take up the holy position of Archbishop of Canterbury. He thought that you had to be kind and understanding to undertake such an important religious position, but apparently not. \n"}, {"text": "What was used as a \"control bar\" when Cadbury sent their new collection of chocolate bars?", "correct": "Coffee Cream bar", "options": ["Fudge bar", "Dairy Milk", "Caramel bar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoffee Cream bar.\n\n\tRepton was reasonably close to the Cadbury's chocolate factory and so when they wanted analysis on their new inventions they would sent samples to the school for the boys to taste. Young boys were considered experts on the matter because they ate lots of chocolate and were the target market. There were always nine new bars and one control bar, the coffee cream bar. The boys were asked to mark the chocolate and also make comments. \n"}, {"text": "Which lesson did Corkers pretend to teach?", "correct": "Maths", "options": ["Science", "English", "Geography"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaths.\n\n\tCorkers was one of Dahl's favourite teachers because he took teaching as a joke.

For example, Carleton.", "correct": "Boazers", "options": ["Prefects", "Beaters", "Bouncers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoazers.\n\n\tBoazers were the older students who had the power to do pretty much anything to the younger ones. They could summon you to their office for the cane, get you to warm their toilet seat in the winter and other horrible things. Dahl recounts how he and another fag were set the task of making Carlton's study spotless. However when Carleton found one speck of dust, they would get the cane. Dahl could have become a Boazer in his latter years but the teachers said that he was too nice. \n"}, {"text": "Which two games was Dahl the school captain of? Squash rackets and...", "correct": "Fives", "options": ["Cricket", "Soccer", "Rugby football"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFives.\n\n\tDahl was very good at sports and as captain of two sports had a lot of respect and responsibility in the school.

Fortunately for him this was in East Africa where he got exactly what he wanted and had many great experiences. \n"}]}
