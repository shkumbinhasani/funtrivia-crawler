Please call Marty or Doc, 555-1821.\n\nWhat Michael J. Fox/Christopher Lloyd time-travel flick centered around this car?", "correct": "Back to the Future", "options": ["Time Bandits", "The Philadelphia Experiment", "Late for Dinner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBack to the Future.\n\n\t\"Back to the Future\" is the story of Marty McFly, a high school student who goes back in a Delorean time machine and meets his parents, inadvertently interfering with their courtship and thus jeopardizing his own existence and, as is seen in each of the two sequels, possibly the future of the whole city.\r The sequel to \"Back to the Future\" resulted in one of the more interesting legal cases to come out of Hollywood. Much of \"Back to the Future Part II\" is archive footage from the first film, and as such, much of it includes Crispin Glover, who played George McFly in the first film. However, he didn't agree to appear in the second film and was replaced by Jeffrey Weissman. Had they reshot the archive footage, there would have been no problem. But as it were, Glover appeared in the second film against his will, and as such, filed suit.\r I went to college in Southern California and found myself in a place one time that looked a little familiar. I went to Puente Hills Mall in the City of Industry and thought I'd been there before... Then I realized--that's the Twin Pines/Lone Pine Mall from \"Back to the Future\". \n"}, {"text": "TRAVEL BOOKSTORE for sale in fashionable section of London. Owner retiring to marry American actress. Call William Thacker, 555-3284.\n\nWhat Hugh Grant/Julia Roberts film took place in and around a travel bookshop in a specific London neighborhood?", "correct": "Notting Hill", "options": ["4 Weddings and a Funeral", "You've Got Mail", "Pretty Woman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNotting Hill.\n\n\tWilliam Thacker is a mild mannered, English travel bookshop owner who has a chance encounter with the most famous actress in the world, which turns into an improbable romance. Everybody knows her and his own mother sometimes forgets him. Can they maintain a relationship amidst the paparazzi, the pressure, and his desire to be normal?\r Interesting parallels between the film and real life. Julia Roberts is Anna Scott, perhaps. When asked at the birthday party how much she was paid for her last movie, Anna Scott answers $15 million, the amount Julia Roberts was paid for \"Notting Hill\". Can someone like that have a relationship with a normal person? Or would that person be swarmed with paparazzi?\r Well, according to the movie's official website, when they filmed the film (including the scenes where she was swarmed with paparazzi), the producers made donations to over 200 charities in exchange for people leaving them alone to shoot the film in peace. \n"}, {"text": "*** THE GENERAL LEE ***\n1969 Dodge Charger, heavily modified race car, #01, Confederate flag on top. Incredibly fast, jumps well. Call Bo or Luke, 555-2910\n\nJohn Schneider becomes Seann William Scott, Tom Wopat becomes Johnny Knoxville, and Catherine Bach becomes Jessica Simpson. What adaption of an 80's TV show is this? ", "correct": "The Dukes of Hazzard", "options": ["Stroker Ace", "Moonrunners", "The Cannonball Run"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dukes of Hazzard.\n\n\tThe Duke Boys find themselves leaving Hazzard County, where they are folk heroes in their feud against the corrupt Boss Hogg and going to Atlanta where they are seen as relics of a past wanting to be forgotten, all in the hopes of gathering support for a road race to save their farm in Hazzard County.\r The movie was based on the TV show, which was based on the 1975 film \"Moonrunners\", which was based on the life of Jerry Rushing, a bootlegger in North Carolina. Throughout his 20s, Rushing would run illegal, homemade moonshine whiskey through the backwoods of the deep South, late at night, driving at high speed without headlights in his modified 1958 Chrysler (called \"The Traveler\", after a horse of General Robert E. Lee). Gy Waldron interviewed him for \"Moonrunners\", then combined that story with the stories of his childhood in Kentucky for \"The Dukes of Hazzard\". \n"}, {"text": "IOWA FARMLAND FOR SALE, 40 acres of prime cornfields with farm house and baseball field. Call Ray Kinsella, 555-8921\n\nWhich Kevin Costner baseball fantasy is this?", "correct": "Field of Dreams", "options": ["Bull Durham", "For the Love of the Game", "Long Gone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nField of Dreams.\n\n\tRay Kinsella is an Iowa farmer who, upon hearing a whispered \"If you build it, they will come\", sacrifices much of his farm and its profits to build a baseball field. He then seeks out a Boston writer and finally returns to the farm to find that an old-time baseball team is working out on it.\r Started out as a book, \"Shoeless Joe\", by W.P. Kinsella. \r The baseball players, including Archibald \"Moonlight\" Graham, were real players. Most of them were the \"Black Sox\", who were banned from baseball for throwing the 1919 World Series. Graham, however, predated them by a decade. He appeared in his only game in 1905, and as is mentioned in the movie, never made it to the plate. He only played a little in the outfield. \n"}, {"text": "ONE BALABUSHKA, the finest of pool cues. Used only a couple times. Be the envy of all the hustlers (and so intimidating that the best may leave you alone). Call Vincent at 555-9271.\n\nWhat Tom Cruise/Paul Newman sequel to \"The Hustler\" included a Balabushka cue that had to be left behind because no serious player would play against one? ", "correct": "The Color of Money", "options": ["The Baron and the Kid", "Pool Sharks", "Up Against the Eight Ball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Color of Money.\n\n\tFast Eddie Felson is a retired pool hustler who now makes a living selling whiskey and staking pool players. He sees Vincent, a young, cocky, toy store employee with some incredible talent and absolutely no street smarts whatsoever, and decides to teach him how to be the hustler that Felson himself had once been. And since hustling involves looking like less of a player than you really are, so that people think they can beat you, the last thing you want to do is play with a professional cue like a Balabushka.\r The most famous pool player of all time is probably Minnesota Fats, real name Rudolph Wanderone. Minnesota Fats was also the name of the pool player, played by Jackie Gleason, who takes on Fast Eddie Felson in \"The Hustler\". \r The interesting bit of trivia from that: Rudolph Wanderone took the name Minnesota Fats from the movie, not the other way around. \n"}, {"text": "ONE COKE BOTTLE. To a heavy person may not be worth much, but to the Bushmen of the deep Kalahari it is among the most useful and beautiful things. Please take it, as the Gods only brought one and the family is starting to fight.

The village finds many uses for it, starts fighting over it, and decides it must be disposed of, so Xi leaves to throw it off the end of the earth. Along the way, he meets civilization, in the form of an inept scientist, a band of revolutionaries, a schoolteacher, and the court system.\r The sequel \"The Gods Must Be Crazy II\" is also excellent. A South African zoologist and American corporate lawyer are in a small plane crash, encounter a couple soldiers fighting each other and a couple wildlife poachers, all while Xi (now called Xixo) is trying to find his two children who accidentally climbed aboard the poachers' truck.\r Also by filmmaker Jamie Uys, \"Animals are Beautiful People\", which is perhaps the funniest wildlife documentary ever made. \n"}, {"text": "SMALL BARBECUE CAFE in Whistle Stop, Alabama.

Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) is the old South in the 1980s, meeting elderly Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) who is certainly far more modern. Ninny tells of the 1920's friendship between old South Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker) and far more modern Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson). Intermingled is the murder mystery of who killed Ruth's abusive husband Frank Bennett.\r A fantastic movie, and a very interesting novel (\"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe\" by Fannie Flagg), especially for its writing style--the story is intermingled with articles from a local newspaper called \"The Weems Weekly\".\r Oh, and the author, Fannie Flagg? Yes, game show buffs will remember her from the Match Game! \n"}, {"text": "RUBY SLIPPERS, size 7, very stylish. Cairn Terrier, female, well behaved.

We will never really know. L. Frank Baum denied the politics consistently, but he was well known for his involvement in politics in the 1890s, as was his illustrator, W.W. Denslow. And he does make his first denial in the introduction to the book--methinks he doth protest too much (why deny before the accusation is made?).\r Anyway: Oz. Is this as in Ounce? The gold standard? The yellow brick road? The gold standard? The Emerald City--a place that appears to have wealth but it is all an illusion--emerald--green--paper money--actually worthless. Dorothy--The innocent everyman from the heartland. The Tin Man--the disgruntled worker. The Scarecrow--the farmer. The Munchkins--the Little People. The Cowardly Lion--William Jennings Bryan. Wicked Witch of the East--Grover Cleveland. Wicked Witch of the West--William McKinley.\rWho knows?

He endures all sorts of 50's era challenges in his quest--an overprotective mother, an unsympathetic teacher, the bully and his toady, and a particularly evil department  store Santa.\r Jean Shepherd, the narrator in the film, is also the writer of the film (and, of course, its main character). He is well known to fans of old-time radio dramas as the host of a radio show called \"Shepherd's Pie\", and \"A Christmas Story\" comes from a series of stories called \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash\". \n"}, {"text": "ANTIQUE OAK ROLL TOP Desk, good condition, very roomy (enough storage for small man), on castors.

She has just returned from vacation, where she has met her newfound love, and she will be leaving town and the newspaper business for good. She has one last story to cover--the execution of questionably convicted murderer Earl Williams. While she is following that story, Burns is sabotaging the new relationship, and the corrupt sheriff and mayor are conspiring to move the execution to before the election and preventing any reprieves from the governor. On the night of the execution, Williams escapes, Burns and Johnson find him and hide him in a rolltop desk, and then the fun begins...\r There are actually several versions of this story on film. The original was \"The Front Page\", with Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson as two male newspapermen. \"His Girl Friday\" made Hildy the ex-wife to add additional plot twists.\r Then Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau remade \"The Front Page\", and Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner redid \"His Girl Friday\" as \"Switching Channels\".\r \"Switching Channels\" makes some interesting updates to \"His Girl Friday.\" For example, the newspaper is now a television station and the killer is now hiding inside an office copier. \n"}]}
