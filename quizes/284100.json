{"id": "284100", "name": "Edit My Quiz - \"Twilight Princess\"  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Twilight Princess\" is a game filled with unique locations and challenging quests, but part of the game's charm comes from the various characters met along the way.  From the start, Link knows the residents of Ordon Village, from the mayor, Bo, who gives the hero the Iron Boots, to the young, yet mature infant, Malo, who opens up their own franchise in Kakariko Village and Hyrule Castle Town.  As Link crosses Hyrule, he will come to recognize the friendly faces of others including Falbi and Fyer, who run their own businesses on Lake Hylia to Yeto and his wife, Yeta, who spend their free time rolling down Snowpeak to their home within the area's dungeon.\n\nWhich of these facts in this paragraph is incorrect?", "correct": "Yeto and Yeta use icy leaves to slide down Snowpeak; they don't roll.", "options": ["Falbi owns a business at Lake Hylia, but Fyer is found in Northern Hyrule Field.", "Mayor Bo does not give Link the Iron Boots, but instead, he gives him an Empty Bottle.", "Malo's shops are in Kakariko Village and Ordon Village."], "explanation": "\n\n\nYeto and Yeta use icy leaves to slide down Snowpeak; they don't roll.\n\n\tAfter following the scent of the Reekfish from Zora's Domain to the top of Snowpeak Mountain, Link must follow Yeto to his home, the fifth dungeon of the game, Snowpeak Ruins.  In order to do this, however, Link must use one of the icy leaves fallen from the tree on the peak to slide to the Ruins.  Once inside, Link will need to fight through the snowy fort to help Yeta, Yeto's wife, who is visibly ill.  After the completion of the dungeon, Yeto and Yeta will gladly race you down the mountain for a reward.\rIn order to open up Malo's second shop, Link needs to donate two thousand hard-earned Rupees (you may want to redeem your collected bugs for this).  Mayor Bo gives Link the Iron Boots in order to defeat Gor Coron at the top of Death Mountain.  Falbi and Fyer are both on Lake Hylia.  Falbi owns the 'Flight By Fowl' shop on top of Lake Hylia's cliffs while Fyer runs the cannon on the surface of the lake. \n"}, {"text": "Nothing may be more fascinating than traveling around Hyrule for the first time.  In wolf form, Link must travel through a twilit image of the world around him, defeating enemies that many people can't even fathom in the real world.  In many cases, it is not possible for Link to be in his true form in the twilight, so Midna will ride him through Hyrule, allowing Link to use some of her powers.  As soon as Link departs from the woods in the south, he will head to the northwest and Kakariko Village to find the children of Ordon Village in the care of Renado.  Going around Hyrule in a counter-clockwise pattern, he will also encounter other areas afflicted by the twilight, including Hyrule Castle Town and Lake Hylia.  Link does not need to encounter the twilight involuntarily in the Gerudo Desert and Snowpeak Province.\n\nWhich fact is wrong here?", "correct": "Link initially travels around Hyrule in a clockwise direction.", "options": ["During Link's first visit to Gerudo Valley, it is covered in twilight.", "The children of Ordon Village are found in the care of Telma.", "Hyrule Castle Town is never found in twilight."], "explanation": "\n\n\nLink initially travels around Hyrule in a clockwise direction.\n\n\tAfter departing from the forests in southern Hyrule, Link will head northwest to Kakariko Village and Death Mountain, travel over the Bridge of Eldin to the north, curve around to Hyrule Castle Town in the west, go south over Lake Hylia, and cut back across to Southern Hyrule Field, opening the gate to allow for free passage.  Hyrule Field is home to many Poe Souls, Heart Pieces, and extra goodies necessary for completing the secondary aspects of the game.  To find all of these areas, Link will need to utilize his skills in wolf form (and twilight) as well as with the weapons used in human form.\rAfter the completion of the Lakebed Temple, Link will travel through the Sacred Forest to claim the Master Sword.  In doing this, Link will be able to shift back and forth between the twilit world and the regular version of Hyrule.  Traveling to Gerudo Desert and Snowpeak Province will be a bit easier after this as Link won't need to fill Vessels of Light to invigorate the area.  Hyrule Castle Town is visited in twilight after Link completes the Goron Mines.  Telma and Ilia can be found inside Telma's Bar with Prince Ralis at this time.  Renado cares for the children of Ordon Village until the game is over.  This is done in Kakariko Village. \n"}, {"text": "Hyrule is architecturally unique in the sense that many of the aged structures found about the lands are intricate, well-built, or rather large.  The Great Hylian Bridge, for example has stood the tests of time.  Link will need to plunge off this bridge during one battle in order to survive a Bulblin attack.  Of course, the landing is broken by the dried-up Lake Hylia below.  Because of the disappearance of Lanayru, the local spirit, there seems to the somewhat of a drought.  Another wonder is Snowpeak Ruins.  Built to last, this fort houses Yeto and Yeta, and becomes the fifth dungeon of the game.  A sturdy, well-furnished living room houses the fifth dungeon boss battle of the game, and despite the pummeling the structure takes, not damage is really done.  Arbiter's Grounds and the Mirror Chamber located therein have also withstood ages of erosion.  This is where Link finds the Spinner.\n\nI know something is wrong here, but I can't pick it out.  What's the wrong bit of info?", "correct": "The boss battle in Snowpeak Ruins is within a bedroom.", "options": ["The Spinner is obtained in Lakebed Temple.", "Link jumps off the Great Hylian Bridge in order to flee from the Twilit Bloat.", "Snowpeak Ruins is the sixth dungeon of the game."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe boss battle in Snowpeak Ruins is within a bedroom.\n\n\tAlthough Link is first introduced to Yeta in the Snowpeak Ruins living room, it isn't until he finds her in front of the bedroom that the boss battle begins.  After running around the Ruins finding ingredients for soup (and the Ball and Chain), Link must fight for a shard of the Mirror of Twilight by defeating the Twilit Ice Mass, Blizzeta, the evil form of Yeta spawned by a Twilit Parasite.  In order to enter the bedroom, however, Link must find the Bedroom Key in the chapel filled with Chillfos.\rIn order to complete the Arbiter's Grounds, Link must find the Spinner by defeating Death Sword.  After beating the boss of this dungeon, Stallord, Link will reach the Mirror Chamber.  This is the fourth dungeon of the game, Snowpeak Ruins is the fifth, and the sixth is the Temple of Time.  Link jumps of the Great Hylian Bridge prior to the third dungeon, Lakebed Temple, because he needs to flee from a Twilit Bulblin Archer who is setting the bridge ablaze.  Both Link and the bridge survive, and Link is one step closer to reaching Zora Domain. \n"}, {"text": "Forest Temple, being the first dungeon of the game, may be regarded as the easiest although it may get confusing at times.  In order to cross windy canyons, spider-filled caves, and leafy bridges, Link needs to obtain the level's weapon, the Gale Boomerang.  In order to do this, he must beat the first boss of the dungeon, Diababa, who will use the weapon until they are defeated.  As Link progresses through the various dungeons of the game, he will have to fight many other dangerous creatures including Aeralfos, Dangoro the Goron, and Stallord, the boss of Arbiter's Grounds.  Link enters the Temple of Time alongside Ooccoo of the Oocca tribe, but he doesn't meet the other members of the tribe until visiting the City in the Sky.\n\nThe facts aren't straight here either.  What's wrong with this synopsis?", "correct": "Diababa does not carry the Gale Boomerang.", "options": ["Link enters the Arbiter's Grounds alongside Ooccoo.", "Stallord is not the boss of the Arbiter's Grounds.", "Dangoro is a Zora; not a Goron."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiababa does not carry the Gale Boomerang.\n\n\tAlthough Diababa is still a staple of the Forest Temple, Link does not encounter this Twilit Parasite until the very end of the stage, and even when doing so, Ook, the original holder of the Gale Boomerang, is present, helping Link destroy the plant boss.  The Gale Boomerang will allow Link to use various switches, fans, and wind-powered objects in order to navigate through the Temple (and some portions of Hyrule as well).\rStallord is the boss of Arbiter's Grounds, and it is defeated using the Spinner.  Dangoro, the Goron mid-boss of the Goron Mines, is also present in the game.  After defeating this character, Link will obtain the Hero's Bow, necessary for beating the dungeon's boss.  Although Ooccoo is discovered in nearly every dungeon of the game, Ooccoo (and Ooccoo Jr.) will enter the doorway to the Temple of Time with Link in order to find their way home.  It isn't until Link discovers the Oocca Cannon and shoots to the City in the Sky that he meets the rest of Ooccoo's tribe. \n"}, {"text": "In this game, Link finds weapons that have never before been seen in \"Zelda\" games.  The Spinner, for example, allows Link to cross otherwise uncrossable areas by hovering on a spinning disc.  Using specialized tracks, Link can also use the device to transport him up rock faces, walls, or obstacles.  The Ball and Chain are also quite unfamiliar.  Found in Snowpeak Ruins, this object is heavy enough to break through walls of ice and other walls of lesser integrity.  The Dominion Rod, originally found in the Palace of Twilight, isn't used as much as other objects in the game, but its power is immense, allowing players to transport/move large inanimate objects.\n\nThis paragraph is short and sweet, but it's still somewhat incorrect.  Where was I in error?", "correct": "The Dominion Rod is obtained in the Temple of Time.", "options": ["The Ball and Chain can't break through ice; it's too heavy to throw.", "The Spinner can't run on a track.", "The Dominion Rod shoots fire; it can't make things move."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dominion Rod is obtained in the Temple of Time.\n\n\tThe Dominion Rod, located in the sixth dungeon of the game, is obtained after Link defeats Darknut in the tallest tower of the Temple of Time.  This item is later used to defeat the boss of the dungeon, Armogohma.  It does not shoot fire, though Rods discovered in other \"Legend of Zelda\" games may.\rThe Ball and Chain can be thrown, but it is still impedingly heavy.  When Link equips this item, he will be bored down by the weight of it, and this will cause him to walk slower.  Unequipping the item or putting it away will solve this small problem.  Luckily, the item's weight makes it great for bluntly destroying large items.  The Spinner does, in fact, run on its own and on tracks.  When it does run on a track, Link has a chance, at any time, to disengage with the track.  This is how he defeats the boss of the Arbiter's Grounds. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the game, Link needs to obtain many items that are necessary in completing the main quest or secondary quests that allow for further progression.  One such item is Ilia's Charm, which ends up becoming Link's Horse Call.  In order to get this however, Link must rescue Ilia from the Hidden Village, and show her Ashei's Sketch.  The Hawkeye, bought from Malo Mart, is used to increase sight when Link uses a ranged weapon such as the Hero's Bow.  It can be purchased for 100 Rupees.\n\nWhat error would warrant a correction in this case?", "correct": "Ilia doesn't need to view Ashei's Sketch to give her charm to Link.", "options": ["Ilia's Charm does not turn into the Horse Call.", "The Hawkeye costs 150 Rupees.", "Link finds the Hawkeye in a Lantern Cavern north of Kakariko Village."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIlia doesn't need to view Ashei's Sketch to give her charm to Link.\n\n\tAshei's Sketch has literally nothing to do with Ilia at this point.  Ashei gives this to you just outside Zora's Domain at the entrance to Snowpeak.  When it's obtained, Prince Ralis needs to view the image (he should be in Kakariko Village, at the graveyard).  This will in turn result in a Coral Earring, which will catch a Reekfish when used at Zora's Domain.  Upon taking the scent of this fish, Link will be able to navigate his way to the top of Snowpeak, and eventually arrive at the game's fifth dungeon.\rWith the Horse Call, Link can contact Epona in various locations around Hyrule, but not all of them.  The Hawkeye can be bought in Kakariko Village after Link obtains the Hero's Bow and beats the Goron Mines.  In order to obtain it, Link has to pay Malo at his newly-opened shop.  Oh, how they grow up so fast. \n"}, {"text": "The bosses of the game are plentiful, and they certainly amount to a headache for Link.  Situated at the end of their respective temples and dungeons, the various large creatures residing there can be difficult unless you have a set plan.  Fyrus, the boss of the Goron Mines, is a strange case.  Fyrus is actually the Goron known as Darbus, who has been attacked by a Twilit Parasite.  Link needs to make use of the Iron Boots and Gale Boomerang in order to defeat this beast.  The Twilit Aquatic boss of the Lakebed Temple, Morpheel, is unique as well, being the only boss in the game to be fought underwater.  The Iron Boots are required for this battle as well, but the Clawshot is also needed.\n\nAlas!  Another error!  What's wrong with this paragraph?", "correct": "The Gale Boomerang is not required for the battle against Fyrus.", "options": ["The Clawshot is not obtained until after Morpheel is defeated, and is thus unused in the battle.", "Fyrus is actually the Twilit form of Dangoro; not Darbus.", "Morpheel is not the only boss fought underwater."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Gale Boomerang is not required for the battle against Fyrus.\n\n\tThe Gale Boomerang is a weapon obtained in the Forest Temple, and because of this, it is not required as much in the future dungeons.  It is primarily used in the boss fight against Diababa, the Twilit Parasite, though it has many uses in certain locations.  The Hero's Bow, the weapon of the second dungeon, is found in the Goron Mines.  To obtain it, Link must used the Iron Boots to defeat Dangoro, who guards the treasure.  As noted, Fyrus/Darbus is the boss here.  Following this, the next dungeon is Lakebed Temple, and because of the abundance of water in this dungeon, Link will need to utilize the Iron Boots on numerous occasions- both to obtain the Clawshot and defeat the boss, Morpheel.\rBosses in this game range from memorable to reminiscent.  Some of the bosses seem familiar from other games, the one in the Temple of Time, for example, but each has new quirks that require special attention in the game.  On most occasions, the weapon you pick up in the dungeon you are fighting the boss in is necessary to win the battle. \n"}, {"text": "Hyrule is home to unnatural creatures, many of which will hinder Link's passage in his journey.  To begin, Chilfos are confusing creatures.  Originally found in the snowier regions of Hyrule, they act similar to Stalfos, a common \"Legend of Zelda\" enemy.  Stalfos are also found in this game though, as early as the Forest Temple.  Lizalfos are an incarnation of these as well, and they use various weapons, including an axe tail, to get the job done.  One unique enemy (or two) would be Zant's Hands.  As Link moves through the Palace of Twilight, these hands will attempt to reclaim two Sol Orbs found in the dungeon.  These can not be defeated unless you exit their respective domains.\n\nUgh.  Another error, but where?", "correct": "Stalfos aren't found until the Arbiter's Grounds.", "options": ["There are three Sol Orbs in the Palace of Twilight.", "Zant's Hands can be defeated with the Dominion Rods.", "Chilfos are only found in Lakebed Dungeon."], "explanation": "\n\n\nStalfos aren't found until the Arbiter's Grounds.\n\n\tFrom A to Zant, the enemies of \"Twilight Princess\" are both inspiring and dangerous.  Stalfos, a \"Zelda\" staple, are found in the Arbiter's Grounds, the fourth dungeon of the game.  Chilfos are found in the chapel of Snowpeak Ruins, where Link finds the Bedroom (Boss) Key.  They are best matched against the new Ball and Chain.  Zant's Hands do, in fact, guard the Sol Orbs in the Palace of Twilight, of which there is two.  Once these are collected and used, they are used to imbue Link's weapon with the power of light, thus creating the Master Sword of Light.  Only with this weapon can Link defeat the Usurper King, Zant, and the final boss of the game shortly after.\rAlthough some enemies, such as Lizalfos and White Wolfos, can be found in other games, certain realism is applied to some of the newer enemies, allowing for the game to provide a whole new experience.  Then again, players of the second \"Metroid Prime\" game may feel all to at home in the twilight... \n"}, {"text": "The land of Hyrule is home to some great treasures, but in order to obtain them, Link must partake in some of the local pastimes.  Fishing, for example, can be done around the bend of the Zora River.  Here, Link can hire a boat, work to upgrade the lures for his Fishing Rod from Ordon Village, or play a small mini-game, known as RollGoal.  Another hobby Link may wish to consider is bug collecting.  If Link collects all twenty-four different bugs around Hyrule, he can give them to Agitha in Hyrule Castle Town in exchange for the Giant Wallet, which can hold 1,000 rupees.  One important sidequest to note is the seven swordsmanship techniques taught to Link by Hero's Shade.  The first of these can be found outside Link's house near Ordon Village.\n\nOne error to note here as well, but which is it?", "correct": "The first encounter with Hero's Shade is outside the Forest Temple.", "options": ["The Giant Wallet holds 999 rupees.", "RollGoal is not played at the fishing hut; it's in Kakariko Village.", "There are twenty-six bugs to collect in Hyrule."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe first encounter with Hero's Shade is outside the Forest Temple.\n\n\tOver the course of the game, Link has the opportunity a total of seven times to learn from the wisdom of Hero's Shade.  On six of these occasions, he must use the howl of his wolf form to summon Hero's Shade at designated locations.  The first incident where Link comes across this spirit is in front of the Forest Temple. To gain the skill, he must master the Ending Blow, a skill that allows him to defeat an enemy in one single knockout blow.  All seven can be added to your techniques and used in nearly any battle.  Bugs are tracked n the game just like all other items.  Link can view these as he collects them all. Each time one of the twenty-four, or each double (one male and one female of each bug) is returned, Link will receive a prize in rupees from this 'princess'.  After all twelve pairs are recovered, Link will get the largest wallet of the game, necessary for buying the Magic Armor in Hyrule Castle Town's Malo Mart.  Playing RollGoal through to the end will result in a new lure for Link, which can be used with the Fishing Rod.  It's played by looking (first-person) at the game in the Zora River fishing hut. \n"}, {"text": "Zant's puppet master, Ganon, is revealed to be the final boss of the game.  Upon reaching the highest point in Hyrule Castle, Link will come across Ganondorf and his captive Princess Zelda.  Upon Link's arrival, he will abruptly use Princess Zelda to do his bidding in the first part of the battle, taking control of her like he did with Zant.  After attacking her, Ganon takes matters into his own hands, becoming a dark beast that crashes around the inner sanctum of the castle.  During this part of the battle, Ganon will leap out of portals in the room, and Link must use the Clawshot to bring him down and sword him.  After this, the battle progresses to Hyrule Field, where Ganon will attack from a trusty steed.  Zelda assists in this matter, using Light Arrows to subdue the boss.  Following this, one final swordfight between the protector of Hyrule and the dark lord will begin, and the completion of this finishes the game.\n\nAt last the game is complete.  One error remains though.  What is it?", "correct": "While fighting the beast form of Ganon, the Clawshot is not required.", "options": ["The final battle is completed in the ruins of Hyrule Castle- not Hyrule Field.", "Zelda does not use Light Arrows during the horse chase with Ganondorf.", "None of these are errors.  The paragraph is flawless- job well done!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhile fighting the beast form of Ganon, the Clawshot is not required.\n\n\tDuring the wild beast phase of Ganon's battle, Link will require the Hero's Bow in order to attack Ganon's face as he escapes his self-made portals in the inner sanctum.  This will allow Link to attack Ganon while he is stunned on the floor.\rFollowing the last swordfight, Ganondorf will be defeated.  Midna, now free of the powers that had befallen the land of Hyrule, takes her true form as the Princess of the Twilight.  The three make their way to the Mirror Chamber on top of the Arbiter's Grounds where Midna bids a farewell to the other two and walks into the portal one last time.  As she departs, she shatters the mirror that Link constructed throughout the game, ensuring that the realms of Hyrule and the twilight would never be crossed again.\r Now that the errors have been addressed, it looks like this quiz should be about ready for submission.  Thankfully, you know your way around \"Twilight Princess\".  Thanks for the quick edit! :) \n"}]}
