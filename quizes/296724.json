Before Murray, who was the last male British tennis player to reach a Grand Slam singles final?", "correct": "Greg Rusedski", "options": ["Tim Henman", "John Lloyd", "Fred Perry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreg Rusedski.\n\n\tAlthough born in Montreal, Canada, Rusedski took British citizenship in 1995 (English mother, and German father). In his 26-year career as a professional prior to his retirement in 2007, he won 15 singles titles and reached #4 in the world rankings. His performance in Grand Slams was nothing special, only making it to the second week twice, both in 1997, when he reached the quarter-final at Wimbledon and the final of the US Open, where he was defeated by Pat Rafter in four sets. Nevertheless, his performance that year earned him 'The BBC Sports Personality of the Year' award.\r Of the alternatives, Henman never made it to a Grand Slam final - he lost in the semi-final at Wimbledon four times between 1998-2002 and he reached the same stage in both the US Open and the French in 2004. John Lloyd is perhaps best remembered as Mr Chris Evert, but he did reach a Grand Slam final, the Australian in 1977 where he lost in five sets to Vitus Geralitus. More than 80 years on, Fred Perry remains the last Englishman to win a Grand Slam singles title, and he won eight -- Wimbledon and the US three times each and the other two each once, with his last victory coming in 1936. \n"}, {"text": "SOCCER (England): which Football League team was the most successful F.A. Cup side of the 1920s, winning the trophy three times in the decade?", "correct": "Bolton Wanderers", "options": ["Arsenal", "Sheffield United", "Aston Villa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBolton Wanderers.\n\n\tBolton Wanderers have won the F.A. Cup four times, but few of their fans are even old enough to remember their victory in 1958, let alone their heyday in the 1920s. They defeated West Ham 2-0 in the historic 1923 Final, the first to be held at the then-new Wembley Stadium. Bolton-born local hero David Jack scored the opening goal of that game, the first goal ever scored at Wembley, and then won the Cup again for Bolton three years later with the only goal of the 1926 Final against Manchester City. Jack was the first player transfered for more than \u00a310,000, more than double the previous record, when he was sold to Arsenal in 1928. Bolton completed their hat-trick of wins in 1929 with a 2-0 victory over Portsmouth in the Final. \r Bolton's next appearance was in the famous 'Matthews' Final' of 1953, when they lost 5-3 to Blackpool. They produced a winning return in 1958 when Nat Lofthouse scored twice in a 2-0 defeat of Manchester United, but we have now passed the 50th anniversary of the their last appearance in the final. \n"}, {"text": "HORSE RACING: In which English county is Wincanton race course?", "correct": "Somerset", "options": ["Gloucestershire", "Suffolk", "Sussex"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomerset.\n\n\tThe small but historic village from which the racetrack gets its name is located just off the A303 in the southeastern corner of Somerset. Exclusively  used for National Hunt racing (jumps), the course had the highest casualty rate of any British track in 2008, with nine deaths. The biggest race on Wincanton's annual calendar is the 2-mile Kingwell Hurdle in February. Jockey Richard Dunwoody won the race five times on five different horses in the 1990s. Numerous horses (e.g. Katchit in 2008), have won the Kingwell and then gone on to win the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham later in the year. \n"}, {"text": "BOXING: Born in Wilmington, North Carolina in 1956, which boxer won World Championship titles at Welterweight, Light Middleweight, Middleweight, Light Heavyweight and Super Middleweight?", "correct": "Sugar Ray Leonard", "options": ["Roberto Duran", "Marvin Haggler", "Thomas Hearns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSugar Ray Leonard.\n\n\tRay Charles Leonard is widely considered one of the best boxers of all time. As an amateur, he won gold in the light welterweight division at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. When he turned professional, his trainer was the legendary Angelo Dundee. He won his first 25 pro fights and finished his career with a 36-3-1 record including 25 wins by KO. He won his first World title, at welterweight, in 1979. During the 1980s, an injury-plagued Leonard constantly retired and then returned, but that period will always be remembered by boxing fans for the 'showdowns' between Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Marvin Haggler. \n"}, {"text": "SNOOKER: Which snooker player, World Champion in 1980, was nicknamed 'The Grinder'?", "correct": "Cliff Thorburn", "options": ["Terry Griffith", "John Spencer", "Steve Davis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCliff Thorburn.\n\n\tClifford Charles Devlin Thorburn was born in Victoria, BC, Canada in 1946.

He won nine of those events and collected the silver medal in the other three. In 1925 alone, Nurmi broke 39 world records in winning 53 of the 55 races he entered. He held most of the major distance running records at some point. His 10,000m world record set in 1924, stood for almost 13 years. Two annual 'Paavo Nurmi Marathons' are staged, one in his home town of Turku, Finland and the other in Iron County in northern Wisconsin. He was the final torch bearer when the Olympic Games were held in Helsinki in 1952.\r Of the alternatives, all are Olympic-winning Finns... Koskenniemi was a member of the winning cross-country team along with Nurmi in 1920, Vasala won the 1500m in 1972 in Munich, and Viren won both 5,000m and 10,000m in 1972 and in 1976 in Montreal. \n"}, {"text": "BASEBALL: which MLB franchise was founded in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings?", "correct": "Atlanta Braves", "options": ["Boston Red Sox", "Milwaukee Brewers", "Cincinnati Reds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtlanta Braves.\n\n\tThe team played as the Boston Red Stockings until changing their name to the Boston Beaneaters in 1883. Between 1906 and 1940 they went through numerous names, Doves, Rustlers, Braves and Bees, all the time remaining in Boston. They eventually settled on The Boston Braves in 1941, but 10 years later they moved more than 1,000 miles west to Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Braves lasted just 13 seasons before heading South and becoming the Atlanta Braves at the start of the 1966 season.\r Of the alternatives, the Red Sox were founded in 1901 as the Boston Americans and adopted their present name in 1908. The Brewers began as the Seattle Pilots in 1969, but stayed on the West coast for just one season before morphing into the Milwaukee Brewers. The Cincinnati franchise, founded in 1882, has never moved and has only tinkered with their name ... They started as the Red Stockings but became the Reds in 1890. They changed to the Redlegs for a few years in the 1950s, but that was a short-lived aberration. \n"}, {"text": "GOLF: In which country was 3-time Major winner Nick Price born?", "correct": "South Africa", "options": ["Australia", "Rhodesia/Zimbabwe", "England"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSouth Africa.\n\n\tNicholas Raymond Leigh Price was born in Durban, South Africa in 1957. His English parents moved to Rhodesia when he was young and Price grew up as a Zimbabwean citizen and even served in the army during the civil War there. \rHe turned professional in 1977 and played his first Major, the Open, the following year. He twice finished second in the Open (1982 and 1988) before finally winning it in 1994.

He drove his entire F1 career for Lotus, debuting in the 1960 season. He was killed driving in a Formula Two race at the Hockenheimring in Germany in 1968. Clark won the driver's World Championship twice (1963 and 1965). Fittingly, he had won the only race of the 1968 season, in South Africa, when he died. He won his first British GP at the third attempt, in 1962. He then dominated the race for the rest of his career, winning four in a row (1962-65), and adding a fifth victory in 1967. \r Of the alternatives, 3-time World Champion Jackie Stewart won the British Grand Prix twice (1969 and 1971) in his nine starts. Prost, like Clark, won the British GP five times, although he started 13 times to Clark's eight. He only managed a consecutive winning streak of two, though (1989 and 1990). The British GP was not Michael Schumacher's favorite - just three wins (1998, 2002 and 2004) in 14 starts. \n"}, {"text": "CRICKET: Which nickname is shared by the Tasmania state team in Australia, the Kolkata team in the Indian Cricket League, and the Bangladesh national team?", "correct": "Tigers", "options": ["Lions", "Warriors", "Giants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTigers.\n\n\tThe Tasmanian Tigers inclusion in 1977 made the Sheffield Shield a 6-state competition.
