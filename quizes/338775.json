{"id": "338775", "name": "Top of the Bottom 6 Quiz | Best and Worst Lists | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "Best and Worst Lists", "Worst Songs Lists"], "questions": [{"text": "#50: The Proclaimers received the honor of being in the dead center of the Worst Songs Ever list.  I was a bit upset though; I love this song.  It seems that it made the list because it was overplayed, and a bit annoying.  Their song is \"I'm Gonna Be\", but what is the subtitle (in parentheses) of the song?", "correct": "(500 Miles)", "options": ["(5,000 Miles)", "(500 Kilometres)", "(5,000 Kilometres)"], "explanation": "\n\n\n(500 Miles).\n\n\tIn 1988, the song \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" was released on the Proclaimers' album \"Sunshine on Leith\" in the UK.  It reached number 11 on the charts, and number one on Australia charts in 1989.  Even with its huge success, it wasn't until 1993 that it reached the US, where it reached number three on the charts. \n"}, {"text": "#49: For reasons I will not go into, \"The Bad Touch\" made the list at number 49.  Who sang this song?", "correct": "The Bloodhound Gang", "options": ["The Chain Gang", "The Apple Dumpling Gang", "The Gangrene Gang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bloodhound Gang.\n\n\tWARNING: There is not much I can say about this song in here without giving you the \"reader discretion is advised\" bit.  So...  Reader discretion is advised.\r    \"The Bad Touch\" was released in 1999 in Europe and in 2000 in the US.  The single's cover features two mating zebras, which, sadly, is quite fitting for the lyrics found within the song.  It came from the album \"Hooray for Boobies\", and the cover, well, yeah. \n"}, {"text": "#48: \"(You're) Having My Baby\".  Interesting name for a song.  It became this man's first number one single in fifteen years; his previous being \"Lonely Boy\".  However, it made it on number 48 of AOL Radio's Worst Songs Ever list.  Who sang it?", "correct": "Paul Anka", "options": ["Frank Sinatra", "Tony Bennett", "Elvis Costello"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul Anka.\n\n\tPaul Anka released the single \"(You're) Having My Baby\" in 1974, his first number one hit single since \"Lonely Boy\" of 1959.  Though the song gained a lot of popularity, in 2006 it was called the number one worst song of all time by CNN.com.  And, of course, it was listed as the 48th worst song of all time by Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio. \n"}, {"text": "#47: Repetition of a word or phrase tends to get a song to find its way onto our list of the worst songs of all time.  This song is no different.  Quad City DJ's released the song \"C'Mon and Ride It (_)\", but what belongs in the parentheses?", "correct": "The Train", "options": ["The Plane", "The Roller Coaster", "The Car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Train.\n\n\t\"C'Mon and Ride It (The Train)\" was released in 1996 on Quad City DJ's album \"Get on Up and Dance\".  It only made it to 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, but was quite popular.  However, the repetition has landed it on the list as one of the worst songs of all time.  But, it still managed to find its way onto \"Dance Central\" For the XBox Kinect. \n"}, {"text": "#46: \"I Touch Myself\" was one of this Australian group's biggest hits, but it also made it on the list of the worst songs of all time.  It's just \"too much information\", as Wilkening put it.  Who sang \"I Touch Myself\"?", "correct": "The Divinyls", "options": ["Men at Work", "The Bangles", "Simon and Garfunkel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Divinyls.\n\n\tThe Divinyls released their hit \"I Touch Myself\" in 1991.  It is off of their self-titled album, released in 1990. \n"}, {"text": "#45: Here is a little snippet from the 45th worst song ever.  \"We like to party, we like we like to party, we like to party, we like we like to party, we like to party (and repeat that a few more times).\"\n\nIf you think you've never heard this song (called \"We Like to Party\", of course), you might want to think again.  It is a very popular song used on Six Flags commercials.  Who sings it?", "correct": "Vengaboys", "options": ["Sengaboys", "Jengaboys", "Xengaboys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVengaboys.\n\n\tPerhaps you still don't think you've heard the song.  Well, to that I say: envision an old, bald man who walks onto the screen and begins to dance wildly and all over the place.  He is advertising Six Flags adventure park.  Well, that song he dances to, yeah, it's this song.  Matthew Wilkening put it best when he said \"If you live within a few hundred miles of a Six Flags adventure park, you've heard this 4,000 times.\"\r Vengaboys released \"We Like to Party\" on their 1998 album \"The Party Album\".\r The commercial for Six Flags might be catchy, but if you listen to the song in its entirety, you can see how it would make the list; it's extremely repetitive. \n"}, {"text": "#44: After listening the D4L's song, I lost all meaning of the words \"Laffy Taffy\".  Nobody will ever learn that too much repetition makes for a song that becomes an \"earworm\" that people soon learn to hate.\n\nWait, I gave you the band (D4L) as well as the song (\"Laffy Taffy\").  What will I ask?\n\nI know; what does D4L stand for?  It's also the album.", "correct": "Down For Life", "options": ["Death For Laffytaffy", "Deliverance For Ludwig", "Die For Love"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDown For Life.\n\n\t\"Laffy Taffy\" was released in 2006, and gained most of its popularity status due to its number of digital sales.  It comes from D4L's album \"Down For Life\".\r Here is a sample of the lyrics.\r \"Laffy taffy.  That laffy taffy.  Laffy taffy.  That laffy taffy laffy taffy.\" \n"}, {"text": "#43: Which of these boy bands announced that they were back when they sang the song \"Everybody (_ Back)\" (word omitted for obvious reasons)?", "correct": "Backstreet Boys", "options": ["N'Sync", "98 Degrees", "New Kids on the Block"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBackstreet Boys.\n\n\tThe Backstreet Boys released \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" as a single on their second album in 1997.  The album was called \"Backstreet's Back\".\r The boy band made many singles from 1996 to 2000, but it wasn't until 2011 that their next single was released. \n"}, {"text": "#42: Billy Joel himself admitted that, after this song, he had run out of songs.  It shows with this one, where the lyrics mention over one hundred world news headlines.\n\nWhich Billy Joel song is this?", "correct": "We Didn't Start the Fire", "options": ["Piano Man", "An Innocent Man", "All My Life"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe Didn't Start the Fire.\n\n\tBilly Joel released \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" on his album \"Storm Front\" in 1989.  The song lists over 100 headlines that occurred from the time of Joel's birth (1949) to the present (when the song was released in 1989).\r Billy Joel admitted that after this song, he was really starting to run out of material.  In 1993, he discontinued recording songs, but in 2007, he released one more single; \"All My Life\".  In that time period, however, he did continue to tour. \n"}, {"text": "#41: I was very upset when I first saw this Eiffel 65 song on the list; at the time, it was my favorite song.  Now, I see why it is number 41.  It is extremely repetitive.  Lyrics below, then the question.\n\n\"_ his house, with a _ little window and a _ Corvette ... I'm _ da ba dee, da ba da, da ba dee, da ba da, da ba dee, da ba da, da ba dee, da ba da.\"\n\nWhich color fits in the blank, and is also the title of the song?", "correct": "Blue", "options": ["Green", "Periwinkle with a bit of chartreuse mixed in", "Red"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue.\n\n\t\"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" was released in 1999 by Eiffel 65, an Italian Eurodance band.  The song was an international hit (called \"I'm Blue\" in some countries), but after playing it over and over and over and over and over again, it became an irritating earworm to many.  Matthew Wilkening describes it as a ringtone that never ever ends.  The song is from their debut 1999 album \"Europop\". \n"}]}
