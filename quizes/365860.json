He told his friends that after school he was going to become an engineer and help the people of New Orleans, and if he walked into a meeting with a dumb tattoo on his arm, he wouldn't be taken seriously.  Now, chained up in the greenhouse of Miss Robichaux's Academy, he realizes that both of his friends' new tattoos are on his body-- he has one of their arms and one of their legs.\r Zoe comes into the room with Madison's gun behind her back. \n"}, {"text": "Madison, newly reanimated, is unable to feel physical pain.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMadison Montgomery, now reanimated, contemplates the misery of existence.  A cynic and numb to suffering, Madison admits that she never wanted to feel.  She would give up anything to feel something now.  She takes many of the herbs in the greenhouse in an attempt to restore her senses but finds nothing of use in that regard.  When she eats most of the food in the kitchen, she still feels unsatisfied.  Nothing helps.\r In the greenhouse, Zoe approaches Kyle who, seeing the gun, cowers in fear.

That's when the two of them head to a fast-food drive-thru.  Delphine is thrilled by the meal and claims it's the best food she's ever had.  Delphine ends up telling Queenie that the other witches will never see her as a sister witch because she's black, which gets her thinking.\r Cordelia, in the middle of the night, receives a call from a distraught Hank.  What she doesn't know is that he's sitting on the floor of a hotel room, drinking, with his firearms splayed out in front.  Unable to sleep, Cordelia wakes up and finds her way around the house.  That's when she finds Madison and, when she touches her bare skin, she realizes that Fiona was responsible for killing her. \n"}, {"text": "The Axeman brings Fiona to his apartment, except it's not really his.

He compliments her frequently and turns on some jazz music before offering her a seat and a glass of bourbon.  He lights her a cigarette and he thanks her for joining him.  When she uses the bathroom and runs her hand through her hair, she notices some of it falling out; she doesn't notice the body in the bathtub, covered by a shower curtain. She shows her hesitance to letting her guard down and says that she's a wretched person before trying to leave.

She makes flash cards to reteach him how to function as a person but he finds it too utterly frustrating.  Madison comes in and asks about Kyle, but she can't remember anything about him.  She says she'll watch over him; Zoe needs to speak to Cordelia.  When Zoe leaves however, Madison, realizing that Kyle has been brought back from the dead just like she was, opens up to him.  Zoe later returns to find them having sex in her bedroom. \n"}, {"text": "According to Marie Laveau, what's the price of admission to join the voodoo witches?", "correct": "Delphine LaLaurie", "options": ["The head of a Salem witch", "A human soul", "Eye of newt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDelphine LaLaurie.\n\n\tOut at Cornrow City, Marie Laveau welcomes Queenie by for a chat and a taste of her Sunday gumbo.  Queenie, wondering about her place in the coven, is told that the other girls will probably never accept her and Marie says that the idea of Delphine as a slave doesn't interest her in the slightest since LaLaurie is too monstrous to be anything but buried in the ground for eternity.  Marie tells Queenie to ask Delphine what she did and, if Queenie really wants to join the voodoo witches, she needs to bring Delphine as price of admission. \n"}, {"text": "According to Cordelia, who is the biggest threat to the coven?", "correct": "Fiona", "options": ["The witch hunters", "Marie Laveau", "Themselves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFiona.\n\n\tCordelia sits Zoe down for a serious conversation about the future of the Coven.  Considering that Zoe summoned up and then banished the spirit of the Axeman from the academy, she's a powerful witch and that puts a target on her back from their biggest enemy-- Fiona.  Cordelia admits that she doesn't know if Zoe is the next Supreme, but if Fiona believes she is, she'll slit her throat just like she did Madison's.  What they must do, according to Cordelia, is kill Fiona to save the coven.\r At the Axeman's apartment, Fiona reveals that she's known about the body in the bathtub the whole time.

Spalding is thrilled by the development but Zoe reveals that the truth enchantment is still on the tongue...and he can't refuse any longer.  When she asks him to reveal who killed Madison, he has no choice but to say it was Fiona.  He reveals that he loves their Supreme but Zoe says that he's not a witch and she is no more than his employer.  That's when she stabs him in the chest.\r Down in the kitchen, Queenie takes the opportunity to ask Delphine what she did.  Although she's hesitant, Delphine tells the truth because she thinks that they can be true friends.  Her biggest regret, she says, is killing a newborn baby and using its blood in her treatment, forcing the mother to help her apply it.  Youth, she claimed, begets youth.

Madison makes a couple of jokes about sleeping with Kyle but tells Zoe that they can share him since being with him was the only time she felt anything since dying.  Since Kyle was dead to begin with, Zoe's unfortunate powers would never work on him again.  Both of them urge Zoe to join them in bed, so she does.\r Fiona stops herself from shaving her hair off and heads to the jazz club instead, intending to have another night with her odd admirer.\r Queenie, meanwhile, takes Delphine out to Cornrow City for a 'haircut' but it's quickly revealed to be a trap.  Marie Laveau emerges and reimprisons LaLaurie in a cage in her back room, telling Queenie to make the first cuts to her.  That evening, Marie Laveau applies her bloody beauty treatment, only using LaLaurie's blood. \n"}]}
