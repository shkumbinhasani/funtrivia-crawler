{"id": "197503", "name": "\"Ocean's Twelve\": The Boys (and Girl) Are Back Quiz | Movies | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Ocean's..", "Ocean's Twelve"], "questions": [{"text": "The opening scene takes place three and a half years before most of the events of this film take place, and sets up the relationship between Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  In which European city does this scene occur?", "correct": "Rome, Italy", "options": ["Venice, Italy", "Paris, France", "Nice, France"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRome, Italy.\n\n\tA title card tells us that the characters are in Rome.  The scene ends with Rusty jumping out the window once he realizes that Isabel has come across evidence that links him to a recent robbery.  Presumably, they don't see each other again until the present center of the film, over three years later. \n"}, {"text": "Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), still furious about the heist pulled by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his cohorts in \"Ocean's Eleven\", tracks down each member of the original crew and threatens him.  Which character is \"caught\" by Benedict while enjoying a pedicure?", "correct": "Frank Catton (Bernie Mac)", "options": ["Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner)", "Yen (Shaobo Qin)", "Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank Catton (Bernie Mac).\n\n\tFrank, who seemed preoccupied with his hands in the previous film, now owns a nail salon, and apparently remains interested in the health and cleanliness of both his fingernails and toenails. \n"}, {"text": "Benedict catches up with Turk Malloy (Scott Caan) and Virgil Malloy (Casey Affleck) at the same time by interrupting a celebration where both brothers are present.  What's the occasion that Benedict interrupts?", "correct": "Virgil's wedding rehearsal dinner", "options": ["Turk's birthday party", "Turk's wedding rehearsal dinner", "Virgil's birthday party"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVirgil's wedding rehearsal dinner.\n\n\tBenedict \"outs\" the Malloy twins as thieves in front of many of their family members, as well as the family of Virgil's fiancee. \n"}, {"text": "Rusty Ryan, now the owner of at least one hotel, is shown dealing with a celebrity guest who has gone slightly berzerk.  This celebrity also appeared in \"Ocean's Eleven\" as one of Rusty's poker students.  Who is it?", "correct": "Topher Grace", "options": ["Holly Marie-Combs", "Joshua Jackson", "Shane West"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTopher Grace.\n\n\tGrace does a pretty impressive job of laughing at himself in this scene, just as he did in the first film.  Rusty's conversation with Grace is cut short by a surprise phone call from Terry Benedict. \n"}, {"text": "Once Danny Ocean (George Clooney) gathers his original team together, the men discuss the fact that Benedict wants his stolen $165 million back, plus interest.  Given what each man has spent of his original take, and how much the interest actually amounts to, how \"short\" is Ocean's team in terms of what they collectively owe Benedict?", "correct": "$97 million", "options": ["$107 million", "$87 million", "$77 million"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$97 million.\n\n\tThis figure is quickly calculated by Reuben once he hears how much each man has left of his original take, and what the interest comes to. \n"}, {"text": "One of the original eleven thieves opts not to join the rest of the team in their new scheme, and walks out of the planning meeting.  Who is it?", "correct": "Saul", "options": ["Reuben", "Yen", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaul.\n\n\tSaul deems himself too old for another adventure, and bows out of the big European plan.  He does show up later in the film, though...and you knew he would! \n"}, {"text": "We learn Rusty Ryan's real first name in this film.  What is it?", "correct": "Robert", "options": ["Russell", "Ryan", "Richard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert.\n\n\tSeveral times throughout the film, Isabel Lahiri calls him by his real name, Robert, instead of the nickname \"Rusty\".  It's hard to tell whether she does this to bother him, or if it's a sign of actual intimacy. \n"}, {"text": "Once the crew realizes that they have to go to Europe to find a job that they can actually undertake without being immediately arrested, Danny and Rusty arrange a meeting with a man named Matsui (Robbie Coltrane).  In what city does this meeting take place?", "correct": "Amsterdam", "options": ["Hamburg", "London", "Vienna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmsterdam.\n\n\tThe meeting takes place at a pub in Amsterdam, and yes, Soderbergh's crew actually filmed there.  Flashbacks later in the film strongly suggest that Rusty first met Isabel in Amsterdam, while working a job with Frank Catton. \n"}, {"text": "During the meeting with Matsui, Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) is utterly baffled when Danny, Rusty, and Matsui inexplicably start saying bizarre things.  Call them aphorisms or parables or nuggets of Zen wisdom -- however you slice it, Linus has no idea what's going on.  In desperation, when it's his \"turn\" to contribute, he recites the lyrics to a classic rock song.  Who originally performed it?", "correct": "Led Zeppelin", "options": ["Pink Floyd", "AC/DC", "Lynyrd Skynyrd"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLed Zeppelin.\n\n\tLinus, at a total loss, starts reciting (not singing) the opening lyrics to Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\", which can be found on the album \"Physical Graffiti\". \n"}, {"text": "Rusty winds up leading the team in a plan to use underwater pylons to elevate the house of their \"mark\" a certain number of inches, so that Basher (Don Cheadle) can make a difficult crossbow shot from across the street.  How many inches does the house need to be raised?", "correct": "three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nthree & 3.\n\n\tRusty learned about the pylons years ago from Isabel, his former lover.  She figures out what happened mere minutes after arriving on the scene of the burgled house. \n"}, {"text": "This film is entitled \"Ocean's Twelve\" because a twelfth person winds up being drawn into the machinations of the thieves' overall plan.  Which actor or actress plays this twelfth party?", "correct": "Julia Roberts", "options": ["Catherine Zeta-Jones", "None of these", "Vincent Cassel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJulia Roberts.\n\n\tDanny's wife Tess (Julia Roberts) gets pulled into the thick of things once Linus takes charge.  Amusingly enough, Linus' plan is for Tess to pretend to be actress Julia Roberts.  The closing credits include the acknowledgement \"and Introducing Tess as Julia Roberts.\"  (Get it?) \n"}, {"text": "In a surprising development, just before Danny Ocean's team is about to pull their big score, most of the team is arrested and incarcerated.  Only three of Ocean's original eleven are free after this setback.  Who, among the following, is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Reuben", "options": ["Linus", "Basher", "Turk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReuben.\n\n\tEight of the eleven men are jailed, since Isabel has upped the security at the museum that the team was planning to rob.  Only Linus, Basher, and Turk remain free...which more or less leaves Linus \"Mastermind in Training\" Caldwell in charge, unfortunately. \n"}, {"text": "Bruce Willis appears as himself in this film.  Which of his previous films do at least two characters reference while conversing with him?", "correct": "The Sixth Sense", "options": ["Die Hard", "Pulp Fiction", "The Fifth Element"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sixth Sense.\n\n\tBoth Linus and a minor character inform Bruce that they figured out \"the secret\" of \"The Sixth Sense\" fairly early in the film.  Willis is none too impressed. \n"}, {"text": "Late in the film, we learn that the Faberge egg (the object that attracts a great deal of attention in the last third of the film) was stolen by Ocean and his crew long before rival thief Francois Toulour (Vincent Cassel) had a chance to steal it (or, rather, its replica!) from the museum in Rome.  From where did Ocean and company steal the egg?", "correct": "a train", "options": ["a restaurant", "an airplane", "a public park"], "explanation": "\n\n\na train.\n\n\tDanny, Basher, Turk, and Linus manage to steal the egg from a courier who is traveling by train.  They accomplish this feat by staging a fake fistfight as a distraction -- while Danny and Basher wrangle with Turk and fall all over their fellow passengers, Linus swaps the courier's backpack with his own, which looks just like the courier's. \n"}, {"text": "The final shot of this film is a freeze frame of sorts, featuring a single character.  Who is it?", "correct": "Isabel Lahiri", "options": ["Rusty Ryan", "Danny Ocean", "Tess Ocean"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsabel Lahiri.\n\n\tOddly, the final shot of the film features Isabel, the law-enforcement agent who has been pursuing the crew throughout the film, during a celebration the team throws for themselves.  Since Rusty brings her to the party, it's a safe bet that she's now \"part of the family\". \n"}]}
