In this Japanese film, MM88 is in the air, and it's deadly.\"\n\nWhat film has Salami chosen for the 1980 sci/fi film?", "correct": "Virus", "options": ["Epidemic", "Contagion", "Diseased"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVirus.\n\n\tIn 1980, the Japanese film \"Virus\" was released.  At the time, it was regarded as the most expensive Japanese film to have ever been made.  The film, obviously, is about a virus, known as MM88.  In the film, the virus wipes out all except for 863 scientists who were camping out in Antarctica (it's too cold for MM88).  Not all of those men survived the winter weather, of course... \n"}, {"text": "\"Well that was certainly cheery,\" Qrayx says dryly.\n\"The music was nice.  Do you have something more lighthearted for us to watch next?\"\n\"Not really.  Our next movie is set in the futuristic year of 1997 where Snake Plissken has to extract the President from the most dangerous prison in the United States.\"\n\nWhat film has Qrayx chosen for the 1981 sci-fi film?", "correct": "Escape From New York", "options": ["The Final Countdown", "Assault on Precinct 13", "RoboCop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEscape From New York.\n\n\tIn \"Escape From New York\", set in the future year of 1997, Manhattan is the United States' largest maximum security prison.  A wall was erected around the island, and the guards only make sure that no one escapes.  With no guards and only criminals on the island, Manhattan is a very dangerous place.  When Air Force One goes down on the island, former soldier and criminal Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is sent in to retrieve the President in exchange for a full pardon.  The catch?  He has only twenty-four hours to complete his mission.\r A sequel, \"Escape From L.A.\", was released in 1996.\r \"Assault on Precinct 13\" was released in 1976 and was remade in 2005. \"The Final Countdown\" was released in 1980, and depicted an American aircraft carrier being sent back in time to World War II. \"RoboCop\" was released in 1987. \n"}, {"text": "\"For our next film, Qrayx, I bought us some munchies,\" Salami grins, pulling out a shopping bag.\n\"Ooh, we have popcorn?\" Qrayx's face lights up.\n\"Not quite. I felt that, since I had the choice for the 1982 film, I could not pass up a classic.  We are going to eat Reese's Pieces for this one!\"\n\nFor which film would Reese's Pieces be an appropriate snack (they're featured in the film)?", "correct": "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", "options": ["Blade Runner", "The Thing", "Tron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\n\t\"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (commonly called simply \"ET\") was released in 1982. The film is about a cute little alien who is left on Earth by his friends. He finds a boy named Elliott who helps ET to \"phone home\". At the time of its release, it surpassed \"Star Wars\" for the highest grossing film of all time.  With a budget of only $10.5 million, it grossed nearly $800 million in sales!  Reese's Pieces are prominently featured in the film; ET falls in love with the little peanut butter candies.\r Between all the 1982 sci-films, salami_swami had a tough choice.  But; who could resist \"ET\"? \n"}, {"text": "When Qrayx pulls out the movie for 1983, he has the biggest grin Salami has ever seen.\n\"If I had to name one movie as my favorite, this would be it,\" says Qrayx.\n\"I think I can see where this is going...\"\n\"This film was the third in George Lucas' groundbreaking trilogy set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away...\"\n\nWhat film from 1983 is Qrayx's all-time favorite?", "correct": "Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi", "options": ["Superman II", "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.\n\n\t\"Return of the Jedi\" was the final chapter in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. The \"Star Wars\" series used new and innovative filmmaking techniques that revolutionized the film industry, and showed that science fiction could be popular with mainstream audiences. The \"Star Wars\" trilogy was such a huge success that, even 30 years after its initial release, most everyone had heard of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Darth Vader.\r In \"Return of the Jedi\", The Death Star is destroyed for good, and the Sith are no more. Vader returns to being a \"good guy\" near his end, when he kills his Sith Master. He, in turn, dies, and asks to be unmasked so he may see his son (Luke Skywalker) face to face before his death. \n"}, {"text": "\"Qrayx, you may be interested to know that Sigourney Weaver is my favorite actress.  Therefore, for our 1984 flick, I have chosen a movie of hers.\"\n\"She's been in a lot, which one do you refer to, Salami?\" Qrayx inquires.\n\"Well, it might just be enough to say there is some paranormal activity in the film.\"\n\nSo, who ARE you gonna call?", "correct": "Ghostbusters", "options": ["Avatar", "Alien", "Holes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGhostbusters.\n\n\tThough all are Sigourney Weaver films, only \"Ghostbusters\" was released in 1984.  The comedy sci/fi film is about three parapsychologists who decide to get into the ghost catching business.  The film also features Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd.\r \"Alien\" was released in 1979, \"Holes\" in 2003, and \"Avatar\" in 2009.  All feature Salami's favorite actress, Sigourney Weaver. \n"}, {"text": "\"Hey, Qrayx. They stopped playing the song. You can stop dancing now.\"\n\"Sorry.\"\n\"What what did you have in mind for our 1985 film?\"\n\"I chose something a little strange. Jonathan Pryce plays Sam Lowry in a bizarre vision of the future, in this cult film.\"\n\nWhich film will the duo be watching next?", "correct": "Brazil", "options": ["Repo Man", "Back to the Future", "Nineteen Eight-Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrazil.\n\n\t\"Brazil\" (1985) depicts a future in which mind-numbingly useless and inefficient regulations and gadgets were used to add unnecessary complications to life. Sam Lowry, played by Jonathan Pryce, is a low-level government employee who falls in love with a woman who has been falsely accused by the state.\r \"Repo Man\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" were both films released in 1984 (fancy that), and \"Back To The Future\" was released in 1985. \n"}, {"text": "\"You know, Qrayx, there is an Oscar category for Best Actress.\"\n\"Yes, I am aware,\" Qrayx was unsure where this was going.\n\"Science fiction films had never had a nomination for Best Actress until 1986.  I think we should watch that film next.\"\n\"Sounds good... Which film is that again?\"\n\"It's the one where Ellen Ripley is rescued after spending 57 years adrift, and returns to the location she first encountered the title creature.\"\n\nWhat is Salami intending to watch for the 1986 sci/fi film?", "correct": "Aliens", "options": ["Short Circuit", "Critters", "Eliminators"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAliens.\n\n\tThe 1986 sequel to \"Alien\" (1979) was \"Aliens\", and again starred Sigourney Weaver.  For this film, Sigourney gained an impressive achievement.  Though sci/fi films had been around for decades, it was not until this film that the genre was featured in the Best Actress Oscar category (also Sigourney's first nomination).  The film had seven nominations total, but the one for Best Actress was the most noted.\r The film follows Ellen Ripley, who had spent 57 years in stasis. When trying to prove the existence of the alien encountered in he first film, she has no proof. A while later, she is again found encountered by the alien; maybe this time she will be believed. \n"}, {"text": "\"Well, what did you think?\" asks Salami.\n\"Is it over? Can I come out now?\" Qrayx replied from under the blankets.\n\"Yes, the monsters are all gone,\" Salami says patiently.\n\"Good. I think I'm going to have to go with something a little more lighthearted, which makes my next pick excellent. This 1987 movie, by Mel Brooks, lampoons pretty much everything we've already seen today.\"\n\nWhich endlessly quotable movie does Qrayx have planned?", "correct": "Spaceballs", "options": ["RoboCop", "Tremors", "Galaxy Quest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpaceballs.\n\n\t\"Spaceballs\" (1987) is a classic Mel Brooks film that parodies many science fiction movies. Brooks himself plays two roles in the film: the president of the evil Spaceballs, and Yogurt, who teaches the heroes about the Schwartz (parodying Yoda and the Force, from \"Star Wars\"). The film somewhat follows the story of all three films in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, but, of course, in a comedic fashion. The protagonist is Lone Starr, who is a parody of Han Solo, who eventually fights Lord Dark Helmet, the parody of Vader (May the Schwartz be with you). Starr is unable to marry the Princess, Vespa, until his royal lineage is revealed.\r \"They've gone to plaid.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Number 5 is alive!\" Salami blurts out as soon as the previous film ends.\n\"I already know what movie you want to see next,\" Qrayx shakes his head at Salami's over-excitement. \"I'll get it started.\"\n\nSalami chose a sequel from 1988. Which is it?", "correct": "Short Circuit 2", "options": ["Ghostbusters II", "Critters 2: The Main Course", "Back to the Future Part II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShort Circuit 2.\n\n\t\"Short Circuit 2\" (1988) was a sequel to the film starring the lovable robot Johnny 5 released two years prior. This film is set in New York, where Johnny 5 toys are being produced. It doesn't go entirely as planned, and Johnny 5 ends up on his own to explore New York City. Unfortunately, though, the film did not succeed as well as the first film did; perhaps the sequel should have also starred Steve Guttenberg (it didn't). \n"}, {"text": "\"Right. Last one. What do you have for us?\" asks Salami.\n\"Our final '80s sci-fi movie is a James Cameron movie that stars Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. It's about the crew of an underwater oil rig as they investigate a sunken US Navy ship.\"\n\nWhat is Qrayx and Salami's final movie of the night?", "correct": "The Abyss", "options": ["Slipstream", "Leviathan", "Lord of the Deep"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Abyss.\n\n\tIn \"The Abyss\" (1989), the USS Montana sinks while carrying nuclear ballistic missiles. A SEAL team is sent to recover the missiles, and decides to use the experimental underwater oil rig as a base of operations. With the Russians closing in, the SEALs want to act fast while the rig crew is more concerned about the safety of the station. To make matters worse, the rig is near the Cayman Trough, and a peculiar third party shows up to complicate matters. \n"}]}
