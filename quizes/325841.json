Eventually, Jonah was swallowed by a big fish and spit out where he needed to go.  Which city, who turned from their evil ways, was saved by God?", "correct": "Nineveh", "options": ["Assyria", "Tarshish", "Nimrud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNineveh.\n\n\tGod commanded Jonah to go to Nineveh to save the people from destruction, but Jonah rebelled, and went the other direction, toward Tarshish.  However, Jonah was eventually forced to travel to Nineveh.  According to Jonah 3:10, the Ninevites repented and were saved, and not destroyed.  However, though they repented and were saved this time, the Ninevites again went back to their evil ways, and would thus be destroyed later.  The destruction of the city was foretold in Zephaniah 2:13-15.  This prophesy was fulfilled when Nabopolassar and Cyaxares besieged and captured Nineveh.  The Medes and Persians destroyed Nineveh, making it \"a ruin heap\".

As soon as they finished their seventh rotation, Jericho fell to the ground!  All except, of course, Rahab's home.  She and her family, though she was a prostitute, were saved by God, and they were not destroyed with the rest of the city.  The fall of Jericho can be read in Joshua 5:13-6:20. \n"}, {"text": "One night, this city had a party.  The people were confident that their city's walls would keep them safe, so they carelessly left the doors open.  This left the perfect opening for Cyrus to seize the city.

Both \"Babylon\" and \"Babel\" mean \"confusion\", since Babel was the city where God confused the languages. \n"}, {"text": "Though it was not exactly a city, Samson did destroy an entire temple single-handedly.

Though, according to verse 22, his hair had started to grow back, thus giving him his strength back.  With his hair grown back, in verse 28, Samson asked God for the strength so he could avenge himself.
