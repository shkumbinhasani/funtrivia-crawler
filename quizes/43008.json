{"id": "43008", "name": "The Problem of the Plague Trivia Game | Specialized History | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "   Specialized History", "Plague"], "questions": [{"text": "The plague in the sixth century was thought by medieval doctors to have been caused by what reptiles in the rivers?", "correct": "serpents", "options": ["chameleons", "tortoises", "iguanas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nserpents.\n\n\tSerpents, snakes, and dragons were closely associated with each other and with evil in the medieval mind; after all, it was a serpent who had tempted Eve in the garden. Although no one saw waterborne snakes in the 1348 epidemic, many believed that poisoned breath from snakes in the far East had spread through the air and caused the Plague. \n"}, {"text": "A more tragic misconception was that Europe's traditional scapegoats -- the Jews -- were somehow responsible. Throughout northern and western Europe, Jews were forced under torture to confess to having caused the Black Death by doing what?", "correct": "poisoning wells", "options": ["conspiring with the Devil", "trading with infected regions", "overcharging for medical services"], "explanation": "\n\n\npoisoning wells.\n\n\tThe accusation was laughable but the results were not. Thousands of Jews were burned by local governments, slaughtered by mobs, or exiled from the cities they had inhabited for generations. Pope Clement VI was able to protect the Jews living near him in Avignon, and some bishops also protected the Jews in their dioceses, but most clerics were perfectly content to take their confiscated property.A few secular governments, such as the city council of Strasbourg, also attempted to protect the Jews in their jurisdictions; these governments were overthrown by angry mobs and replaced with more anti-Semitic ones.It was the aftermath of the Black Death that led so many Jews to settle in Poland, where there was little anti-Semitism until the mid-1600s. \n"}, {"text": "The most widely held modern belief is that bubonic plague was carried by fleas living on what common pest?", "correct": "rats", "options": ["stray dogs", "mice", "raccoons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nrats.\n\n\tRats were everywhere in the Middle Ages, and frequently stowed away on board cargo ships. This would explain the plague's transmission to places like England and Iceland, across a barrier of water from the continent. \n"}, {"text": "One explanation for the entry of the Black Death into Europe is that an invading army besieged a diseased city in the Crimea ... and the citizens did what?", "correct": "flung infected corpses over the walls", "options": ["welcomed them and gave them plague-infected blankets", "breathed into their enemies' water supply", "sent dying diplomats 'to negotiate surrender' but actually to spread disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nflung infected corpses over the walls.\n\n\tIt is not known, however, whether bubonic plague can be caught from cadavers. \n"}, {"text": "A competing medieval theory for how the Black Death reached Europe involved three infected ships which stopped first at what Italian city before being driven from port to port, not allowed to stop and unload, spreading pestilence in their wake?", "correct": "Genoa", "options": ["Milan", "Rome", "Venice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenoa.\n\n\tAlthough the story has appealing parallels to legends like that of the Flying Dutchman, it is no longer considered particularly plausible. The chronicler Louis Sanctus of Beringen, however, recorded it as fact in April of 1348. \n"}, {"text": "In Paris during the Black Death, the king convened a group of scholars who announced that the plague was caused by what?", "correct": "an astrological problem: Saturn in the house of Jupiter", "options": ["a spiritual problem: mankind's sins had infuriated God", "a general physiological problem: the essential humors were out of balance", "an ecological problem: rains of scorpions in the Orient"], "explanation": "\n\n\nan astrological problem: Saturn in the house of Jupiter.\n\n\tAlthough all of these theories were advanced by scholars in 1348, the king's commission decided the answer was in the stars. \n"}, {"text": "Modern academics Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe claim that bubonic plague is a classic example of what disease vector they call 'vertical transmission'?", "correct": "Pathogens arrive on earth in an 'organic rain' from passing comets", "options": ["Mothers transmit pathogens to their unborn children", "The disease emerged in poorer areas and spread upward through the social classes.", "Due to the changed diaphragmic positions, standing people are more susceptible than people who are sitting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPathogens arrive on earth in an 'organic rain' from passing comets.\n\n\tTheir theory is seriously undermined by their argument that ALL diseases MUST have come from space (since no bacteria could have evolved on Earth, oh no) and by their fundamental misunderstanding of Darwin's theory of evolution. In epidemiology, vertical transmission refers to the transfer of diseases from mother to fetus. \n"}, {"text": "The invention of microscopes enabled doctors to identify the bacillus that causes bubonic plague. What is its name?", "correct": "Yersinia pestis", "options": ["Escherichia coli", "Escherichia pestis", "Yersinia coli"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYersinia pestis.\n\n\tCalled Y. pestis for short. E. coli is responsible for most modern food poisoning associated with beef, although humans could not survive without its presence in our guts. \n"}, {"text": "A significant percentage of plague victims never developed the telltale buboes, or painful welts, that give bubonic plague its name; medieval plague victims also succumbed more quickly than is typical of bubonic plague sufferers. To explain these inconsistencies, modern historian Graham Twigg proposed that the bubonic plague epidemic was combined with an outbreak of what other disease?", "correct": "anthrax", "options": ["foot and mouth disease", "tuberculosis", "gonorrhea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nanthrax.\n\n\tAnthrax, a cattle disease, would also have spread more quickly than a rat-borne disease. \n"}, {"text": "The inconsistencies in the symptoms are more conventionally explained by the fact that the plague bacillus causes not only bubonic plague, but two other diseases as well. This theory holds that the Black Death was a combination of what three varieties of plague?", "correct": "bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic", "options": ["meningial, septicemic, and tracheal", "bubonic, pneumonic, and meningial", "bubonic, meningial, and septicemic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic.\n\n\tBubonic plague is distinguished by the aforementioned buboes and takes the longest to kill its victims. It is spread only by flea bites, as far as is known. Pneumonic plague affects the lungs, kills more quickly than bubonic plague, and is harder to diagnose; it can be spread through the air, much like tuberculosis.Septicemia, a disease of the blood, kills the fastest of all and is hardest to recognize; it is, however, much rarer than the other two. It is commonly believed that most plague victims suffered from two or three of these varieties at once -- which would certainly explain how they died so quickly. \n"}]}
