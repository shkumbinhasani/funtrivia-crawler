In what year was this Regiment raised and where did this take place?", "correct": "Raised in 1633 in Scotland", "options": ["Raised in 1633 in France", "Raised in 1638 in Scotland", "Raised in 1635 in Wales"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaised in 1633 in Scotland.\n\n\tThe Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment) were the oldest British Infantry Regiment of the Line. They were raised by Sir John Hepburn in Scotland and were destined originally for service in France. A contingent of the regiment's original members had seen service as mercenaries in King Adolphus of Sweden's \"Green Brigade\". Many of them were foreign and it is only because of King Charles I granting his Royal Warrant that the Regiment was considered to be British.On the 28th of March 2006 the regiment, 373 years to the day of its raising, was amalgamated with The 1st Battalion The Kings Own Scottish Borderers to form The 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland. \n"}, {"text": "Second Lieutenant Stephens (fictitious) is a junior Commissioned Officer who commands a platoon in 'C' Company of his regiment.  It has been published on Battalion Part One Orders that he has been placed on duty this coming weekend. What duty is he MOST likely to perform?", "correct": "Battalion Orderly Officer", "options": ["Garrison Orderly Officer", "Battalion Guard Commander", "Company Orderly Sergeant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBattalion Orderly Officer.\n\n\t2Lt Stephens has really drawn the short straw.  Not only has he drawn duty but he's on duty over the weekend.  His duties as the Battalion Orderly Officer will include inspecting the cleanliness and the quality of food in the Battalion Canteen (known affectionately as the 'Cookhouse'), and he will also be responsible for the maintenance of discipline and good order of his unit's soldiers whilst they are off duty at the weekend.  He will also be present at the daily mounting of the guard to ensure that those soldiers on duty are well turned out and are aware of the duties that they are expected to perform whilst on Guard.  2Lt Stephens will also liaise with the Orderly Officers of the other units within the Garrison as well as with the local Civil Police Forces.  The Garrison Orderly Officer will carry out similar duties but will usually be of a more senior rank and will report any incidents directly to the Garrison Commander.\r Battalion Guard Commander is a role usually carried out by a Corporal and assisted by a Lance Corporal as his second-in-command.  His responsibility is the security of the barracks and its equipment, taking responsibility for the welfare of those soldiers undergoing punishment in the 'Guardroom' and providing the Battalion Fire Picquet (in case of a fire occuring within the barracks).  Company Orderly Sergeant is a duty usually performed by a Lance Corporal.  This duty is mainly to provide an efficient flow of information and orders from the Officer Commanding the Company or the Company Sergeant Major down to the soldiers under their command. \n"}, {"text": "\"Sir!  I have no live rounds or ***** ***** in my possession, Sir!\"\nThis declaration takes place at the end of any period where live ammunition has been used: a Company range day or a Battalion Skill-At-Arms Meeting for example.  It is a very important declaration that has to be made by every soldier who has attended and is made to the senior person present.  What items are missing from this declaration?", "correct": "Empty Cases", "options": ["Magazines or bayonets", "Bombs or bullets", "Blank Firing attachments or pyrotechnics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmpty Cases.\n\n\tThe declaration is very important and making a false statement knowingly is a very serious offence in the Army. If, after making your declaration and on your return to barracks, you DO find any live rounds or empty cases in your equipment, providing they are surrendered immediately to the senior rank to whom you made your declaration, or to your Platoon Commander/Platoon Sergeant nothing else will be said. If, however, you are later to be caught in possession of either live rounds or empty cases then you can expect to appear before your Battalion Commanding Officer or, dependant on the quantity that you were caught with, an appearance at a Court Martial. \r After an exercise where NO live ammunition is used you would also declare (in addition) that you are not in possession of any blank rounds, empty cases or pyrotechnics (flares or smoke grenades etc). \n"}, {"text": "The regulations that detail how the Army is to be 'run' from the highest to the lowest levels are laid down in a publication that is held within every department within a regiment. By what title are these regulations known? ", "correct": "The Queen's Regulations for the Army (QRs)", "options": ["The General Officer Commanding's Regulations (GOCRs)", "The Lord Lieutenant's Regulations for the Army (LLRs)", "The Prince of Wales' Regulations for the Army (PoWRs)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Queen's Regulations for the Army (QRs).\n\n\tEvery instruction that ensures the efficient running of the Army at every level and which also lays down the regulations that affect the administration, discipline and financial responsibilities of members of the Army are detailed within The Queen's Regulations for The Army. Believe me when I say that it is a \"well thumbed publication\"! It is usually found (at Company level) in the Company Sergeant Major's Office and leaves the building infrequently as it is so heavy!  When our current monarch (God Save Her) is no longer with us,and our next monarch is crowned, these regulations will be amended and become known as \"The King's Regulations for The Army\".  \n"}, {"text": "If you've ever been fortunate enough to witness the Trooping of the Colour at Horse Guards in London, you may have noticed the uniforms worn by our Regiments of Foot Guards, and that the layout of buttons on their tunics is quite unusual in that they are grouped together. If you had been watching the Trooping of the Colour with the 1st Battalion The Irish Guards on parade, how many buttons would you expect to see in each grouping? ", "correct": "4", "options": ["3", "2", "5"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4.\n\n\tThis grouping of four buttons signifies the fact that the Irish Guards were the fourth Regiment of Foot Guards to be founded. The Irish Guards also wear a large and quite prominent blue feather plume on the right hand side of their bearskins. The Irish Guards are also affectionately known as \"The Micks\" or \"The Fighting Micks\", two terms which may be thought of as derogatory by some. But certainly not in their case! \n"}, {"text": "The Black Watch (The Royal Highland Regiment) Museum is housed in which historic Scottish castle situated near the centre of the city of Perth?", "correct": "Balhousie Castle", "options": ["Fort George", "Stirling Castle", "518 Sauchiehall Street"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalhousie Castle.\n\n\tThe Black Watch Museum at Balhousie Castle consists of 10 rooms that take you on a chronological journey through the history of the Regiment.

You have turned up at Company Muster Parade after racing back to barracks and haven't had time to prepare yourself and smarten up.  You sweat as the Platoon Sergeant paces down each rank getting closer and closer... He comes up behind you, leans forward and whispers in your ear \" Am I hurting you soldier?\" \"No Sergeant\" you reply nervously... \"Well, I should be, I'm standing on your hair!!\" he screams deafeningly in your ear. That will be this evening messed up for you - what minor punishment can you expect for presenting yourself in bad order?", "correct": "Show Parade", "options": ["Staff Parade", "OC's (Officer Commanding) Orders", "Restriction of Privileges"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShow Parade.\n\n\tShow Parade is usually given to a soldier who turns out on parade in 'bad order'.  This could mean having untidy hair, being unshaven, wearing dirty uniform or having dirty boots.  The soldier must present himself at the Guardroom at 6pm (although this might vary within different units) for inspection by the Battalion Orderly Sergeant or Battalion Orderly Officer with the offending item corrected. In this case a visit to the barber was required.  If, at Show Parade, you are still in bad order, life becomes very awkward as you could then be ordered to return again at 10pm for Staff Parade.  \r Staff Parade usually means parading at the Guardroom in full No2 dress (Parade Dress) carrying correctly packed webbing equipment for inspection by the Battalion Orderly Officer. This chain of events will continue every day until the soldier gets it right and turns up in an acceptable state of dress!\rRestriction of Privileges is a punishment awarded, usually by your Company Commander (OC) for slightly more serious offences such as minor insubordination or falling asleep on Guard Duty, although both of these offences may result in an appearance in front of the Battalion Commanding Officer with the corresponding increase in tariff! \n"}, {"text": "Following a common theme for the last 200 years or so, what 'musical' instrument has always featured prominently in the Regimental Badge of all British Light Infantry Regiments?", "correct": "The Bugle Horn", "options": ["The Hunting Horn", "The Alpine Horn", "The French Horn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bugle Horn.\n\n\tThe Light Infantry Regiments were originally raised as skirmishing troops and were expected to be lightly equipped, highly mobile forces.  Because of this, they would often find themselves operating independently and away from the main force involved in battle.  As it was difficult for commanders on the ground to shout orders to these Light Infantry troops, the Bugle Horn would be used to relay orders and instructions. Each member of the Regiment was expected to know what each and every bugle call meant and how they were expected to respond. The Bugle Horn became synonymous with these units and was thus adopted as the main feature in each Light Infantry Regimental Badge. \n"}, {"text": "Whilst on active service, in Afghanistan for example, a Regiment may hold a 'Drumhead Service'.  These services follow a tradition that goes back hundreds of years that allow soldiers in the field, without access to their chapels or church, to hold a religious service.  What iconic and historical items would you expect to see being used as the altarpiece?", "correct": "The Regimental Colours and Regimental Drums", "options": ["The Regimental Colours and Battalion Heavy Weapons", "The Company Standard and Soldiers Rifles", "The Regimental Drums and Officers Swords"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Regimental Colours and Regimental Drums.\n\n\tAn Infantry Regiment usually possess two Regimental Colours.  These Standards represent a Regiment's Officers and Soldiers, its achievements and its history. Because of this they hold an iconic and religious status within the Regiment and are its most valuable possessions.  At a Drumhead Service the Regimental Chaplain would preside over the stacking of the Regimental Drums to form an altarpiece.These drums would then be consecrated by the Regimental Colours being placed over them and the service could then take place. These services, whenever they are held, always used to be compulsory whether you held any religious belief or not.\n"}, {"text": "Field Marshall Sam Manekshaw MC, a former Chief of Staff of the Indian Army, once said: \"If a man says that he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or he is a ******\". To which Asian mountain-dwelling people was he referring?", "correct": "The Gurkhas", "options": ["The Zouaves", "The Bengalis", "The Afghans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Gurkhas.\n\n\tBetween 1814 and 1816, during the Gurkha War, the Gurkhas fought against the private army of the British East India Company.  The Gurkhas gained a reputation as disciplined and tenacious soldiers and impressed the British authorities of the time immensely. After Nepal had become a British Protectorate, the Gurkhas began to be recruited as mercenaries serving within the British Army. Over the last 200 years these soldiers have become hugely respected by those within the British Army and feared by those who have had the misfortune to come up against them in battle. The debt that Great Britain owes to these men and their families was finally settled when, on the 21st May 2009, the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that all Gurkhas who had retired before 1997 and who had four years service or more would be permitted to settle in the UK. And not before time! \n"}]}
