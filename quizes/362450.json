{"id": "362450", "name": "Reality Check: A Mixture Multiple Choice Quiz | Mixture: Reality TV | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "TV Mixture", "Mixture: Reality TV"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these reality TV show stalwarts did not first appear on \"Survivor\"?", "correct": "Omarosa Manigault", "options": ["Richard Hatch", "Rob Mariano", "Elisabeth Hasselbeck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOmarosa Manigault.\n\n\tOmarosa first appeared on the debut season of the Donald Trump-hosted \"The Apprentice\", first airing on NBC in early 2004.  The show placed businesspeople into high-stakes tasks to win themselves a high-salary contract with Donald Trump's organization.  The show has since had several celebrity iterations, two of which featured Omarosa, the show's most notorious contestant (except, maybe, Gary Busey).  It took until her third appearance, in 2013, to win as Project Manager.\r Richard Hatch was the winner of the first \"Survivor\" back in 2000; he was arrested for tax evasion.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck was in the second season set in the Australian Outback; she would go on to be a co-host on \"The View\" for many years.  Rob Mariano-- Boston Rob-- would appear on several seasons of the show, winning in his fourth bout (\"Redemption Island\").  He married former Survivor Amber Brkich (who won \"All-Stars\") and raced with her in \"The Amazing Race 7\" and \"All-Stars\" (11). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not a challenge type on the TV cooking competition, \"MasterChef\" (US)?", "correct": "Field Test", "options": ["Pressure Test", "Mystery Box Challenge", "Invention Test"], "explanation": "\n\n\nField Test.\n\n\tPerhaps a 'Field Test' would be the equivalent of what's actually known as the Team Challenge-- for these, the home cooks on the show head out in teams to complete a stressful task (ie. serving hundreds of schoolkids, catering a wedding, working the line in a Michelin-star restaurant, etc.).\r Typically, however, the show is filmed in the luxurious MasterChef Kitchen and hosted by Gordon Ramsey, Graham Elliot, and Joe Bastianich.  There, they judge Mystery Box Challenges (in which the cooks receive an unknown box of ingredients and make a dish with the contents), Invention Tests (which give criteria to fulfill to make a single dish), and Pressure Tests (requiring exacting specifications or the creation of complex dishes to beat out other home cooks). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these U.S. reality TV shows was not distributed by Endemol?", "correct": "Work of Art: The Next Great Artist", "options": ["Big Brother", "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition", "Fear Factor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWork of Art: The Next Great Artist.\n\n\tA Dutch-based TV company (and, apparently, think-tank) for reality and game shows, Endemol has created some of the world's most popular television franchises.  Aside from \"Fear Factor\", \"Big Brother\", and \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\", they also released \"Kid Nation\", \"Estate of Panic\", and \"Auction Kings\".  On the game show side, they produced the well-known \"Deal or No Deal\", \"1 vs. 100\", \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", \"Pointless\", and \"Wipeout\".\r \"Work of Art\", an (obviously) art-themed show airing on Bravo for a couple of years, was executive produced by actress Sarah Jessica Parker. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Amazing Race\", what race mechanic allows a team to 'skip all tasks and proceed directly to the next Pit Stop'?", "correct": "Fast Forward", "options": ["Detour", "Switchback", "Express Pass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFast Forward.\n\n\tThe Fast Forward is a unique task which appears rarely (if at all) in a single race, granting teams the opportunity to forge ahead, not needing to complete any of the other tasks in a single leg of the race.  To do so, however, the team needs to complete a difficult task; in some seasons they've had to eat bowls of grasshoppers, in others they've had to perform adrenaline-pumping bungee jumps, and in some, teams have shaved their heads. In early seasons, Fast Forwards appeared in every leg of the race making them dynamic tactical options.  They're signified by a green clue.  Only one team can take a Fast Forward in any leg of the race (unless Intersected, as has happened in \"The Amazing Race 10\" and \"The Amazing Race 11\"). \n"}, {"text": "Which is not one of Mama's children in \"Here Comes Honey Boo Boo\"?", "correct": "'Baby Kaitlyn'", "options": ["'Pumpkin'", "'Chubbs'", "'Chickadee'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Baby Kaitlyn'.\n\n\tOn this TLC show about a self-proclaimed redneck family from rural Georgia, everyone has a nickname.  The family is headed by 'Mama' whose children, in order, are 'Chickadee', 'Pumpkin', 'Chubbs', and 'Honey Boo Boo' herself.  'Baby Kaitlyn' is also a family member, but she's the first child of 'Chickadee', who got pregnant in her mid-to-late teen years.  Almost as if the show needed a further boon to get ratings, Kaitlyn was born with an extra finger.  The show quickly became one of the most talked-about, most-viewed shows on the former educational network. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the crash test dummy used to test dangerous myths on the scientific TV show \"Mythbusters\"?", "correct": "Buster", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuster.\n\n\tBuster was introduced early on when 'professional mythbusters' Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage needed to test an exploding toilet (seriously).  He has since become an informal mascot for the show, getting used for many subsequent myths involving cannons, explosives, ballistics, and more.  His body parts have been destroyed, rebuilt, remolded, shattered, and gone missing, but he's still in it.  The original Buster was retired from use in later years; he has since been replaced by new dummies. \n"}, {"text": "Three seasons of \"Flavor of Love\" aired on VH1 in the mid-2000s.  Did Flavor Flav marry any of his prospective flavors who competed on the show?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tUltimately, after three dips into the contestant pool for Flavor Flav, he ended up marrying a completely different woman in the final episode, a reunion show airing in 2008, who also happened to be the mother of one of his children.  This, I may remind, occurred after eliminating sixty-two women total and giving up on his relationships with the three winners (one per season).  Flav is perhaps best-known for being a member of the rap group Public Enemy, his drug charges, and for wearing a clock on a chain around his neck. Like \"The Bachelor\", the show featured ceremonies in which the girls received gifts to keep them in the competition; instead of a rose, he gave them a clock. \n"}, {"text": "The single-season FOX reality show \"Murder in Small Town X\" took place in what fictional seaside town?", "correct": "Sunrise", "options": ["Gold Coast", "Windfall", "Hope"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSunrise.\n\n\tAlthough \"Murder in Small Town X\" was considered a reality TV show, the premise involved a fair bit of fabrication, mainly to maintain a storyline and mystery throughout.  A group of amateur investigators were sent to Sunrise, Maine, allegedly the earliest town to see the sunrise in the U.S., to solve a murder mystery.  The town used for the show was actually Eastport, Maine and it is, actually, the easternmost point in the States, as the show said. \n"}, {"text": "In \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", which of the following competitions is used to help Ru determine who sashays away from the show?", "correct": "Lipsynching", "options": ["Voguing", "Drag-walking", "Speech-writing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLipsynching.\n\n\tAfter a mini-challenge and a full-fledged challenge judged by Ru and a panel of esteemed colleagues, contestants in the drag race are told to don a particular theme of clothing and strut down the runway for a final component.  Finally, Ru narrows the pool down to the two worst contestants and forces them to Lipsynch for their Lives.  Although there are judges, the decision is ultimately Ru's.  The person remaining is told \"Shante; you stay.\"  The person eliminated must \"Sashay; away.\"  The lipsynched song is usually a RuPaul single or drag staple and involves a lot of showboating. \n"}, {"text": "The contestants on \"The Voice\" are backed by professional mentors/judges.  Which international version of the show has featured Sir Tom Jones, rapper will.i.am, and Jessie J?", "correct": "UK", "options": ["U.S.", "Australia", "The Philippines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUK.\n\n\t\"The Voice\", created by John de Mol, has emerged as a major competitor to the \"Pop Idol\" franchise around the world.  In the show, after a series of blind auditions, four judges/mentors take on musicians based on voice alone, training them to hone their skills and battle it out to become a winner.  The UK version originated in 2012 with Sir Tom Jones, Jessie J, will.i.am, and Danny O'Donoghue as mentors. In the U.S., judges have included Blake Shelton, Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera, Cee-Lo Green, Shakira, and Usher.  The AUS version has included Joel Madden, Seal, Keith Urban, Delta Goodrem, and Ricky Martin. Coincidentally, the version from The Philippines features will.i.am's fellow Black Eyed Peas member Apl.de.Ap. \n"}]}
