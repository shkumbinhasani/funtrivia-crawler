{"id": "175767", "name": "Richard I - The Truth Not the Myth Quiz | People | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "House of Plantagenet", "Richard I"], "questions": [{"text": "Where was King Richard I born?", "correct": "In Oxford in England", "options": ["In Chinon in France", "In Toulouse in France", "In London in England"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn Oxford in England.\n\n\tRichard was born the 8th September, 1157 at Beaumont Palace in Oxford. Thus, in spite of not speaking a word of English, Richard was at least born in the country. \n"}, {"text": "How many brothers and sisters did Richard I have?", "correct": "Seven - four brothers and three sisters.", "options": ["Three - all brothers.", "Five - three brothers and two sisters.", "Six - three brothers and three sisters."], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven - four brothers and three sisters.\n\n\tThe eight children of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine were William (who died young), Henry, Matilda, Geoffrey, Eleanor, Joan, John and, of course, Richard himself. The legends tend to focus on Richard and John, though Geoffrey's son, Arthur, is often included when King John becomes king. \n"}, {"text": "In which city in Europe did Richard spend many of the years of his youth at his mother's court?", "correct": "Poitiers", "options": ["Paris", "Rouen", "Caen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoitiers.\n\n\tThough Richard's reputation is largely based on his exploits during war-time, he actually preferred the company of his sophisticated and well-educated mother in Aquitaine to that of his belligerent father who was always on the move. This didn't stop Richard from becoming the sort of man who seemed to look anywhere for an opportunity to fight. \n"}, {"text": "In 1173 and 1174, Richard joined his brothers Henry and Geoffrey in a campaign against which person?", "correct": "His father - Henry II", "options": ["His eldest brother - William", "Philip II - the King of France", "Sancho of Navarre - King of Spain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis father - Henry II.\n\n\tThe campaign was in fact a revolt by the brothers against the will of their father and the way he insisted they should run their parts of his larger kingdom. It seems odd that Richard's reputation should remain so high after betraying the trust of the one who gave him life and who was his king. He was more than once a traitor. \n"}, {"text": "What curious phenomenon was reported to have occurred when Richard approached the dead body of his father Henry II in Fontrevault?", "correct": "Henry's nose suddenly began to bleed.", "options": ["Henry's closed eyes suddenly fell open.", "Henry's sword fell from his body to the floor.", "A raven descended to begin pecking at the body."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry's nose suddenly began to bleed.\n\n\tHowden and Giraldus both report this incident. To them contemporary people would have assumed that this indicated that Richard was guilty of killing his father. That Richard may have contributed to his father's death is certainly probable for he had combined with the France king in a final rebellion. On the other hand John, Henry II's favourite son, probably caused his father more grief when he too was found to be numbered amongst the rebels. \n"}, {"text": "How old was Richard when he was crowned King of England at Westminster Abbey?", "correct": "31", "options": ["36", "25", "28"], "explanation": "\n\n\n31.\n\n\tRichard was born on the 8th September, 1157 and was crowned on the 2nd September, 1189. Thus he was 31 years of age and only just short of being 32. Two older brothers had died before he, the third son, came to the throne. His brother Henry had actually been crowned as King of England but this was done by the Archbishop of York rather than that of Canterbury and Henry II had tried to give this son this minor kingdom whilst he considered himself the King of several kingdoms.The \"young king\" was not recognised by the Pope nor any of the important European monarchs. Thus when young Henry died Henry II was forced to recognise Richard, whom he did not like or trust, as his heir. \n"}, {"text": "What event in England at the time of Richard's coronation cast a stain over any celebrations?", "correct": "The slaughter of a large number of Jews.", "options": ["The outbreak of the plague in the east end of London.", "The death of the Bishop of London.", "The news that the Scots had raided over the border into England."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe slaughter of a large number of Jews.\n\n\tRichard was probably partly responsible for the massacre that took place. It is reported that in the strongest terms he encouraged his subjects to turn away the unbelievers from the ceremony. This was interpreted as a license for attacking the Jews and their property in London. \n"}, {"text": "How many years of his 10 year reign did Richard actually spend in England?", "correct": "Less than 1 year", "options": ["Just 3 years", "Just 2 years", "Just 4 years"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLess than 1 year.\n\n\tSome sources say that he spent no more than 6 months in England. Others report that is was 10 months. All agree that it was certainly less than a year. The truth is that he had no love for England and a great deal of love for those areas of France which he considered his home. \n"}, {"text": "Which city did Richard say that he would sell if he could find someone to buy it?", "correct": "London", "options": ["Bristol", "Jerusalem", "York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLondon.\n\n\tThe only thing that appealed to Richard about England was the money that he could raise by taxing his people or by selling his estates. There is no evidence whatsoever of concern for any of his subjects. \n"}, {"text": "In which Crusade did Richard I play a leading part?", "correct": "The Third Crusade", "options": ["The Second Crusade", "The Fourth Crusade", "The First Crusade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Third Crusade.\n\n\tSome historians report that Richard I went on the Third Crusade as a result of a promise that he made to his dying father. He won several victories but never did capture Jerusalem. His reputation as a fierce fighter was certainly enhanced at this time. \n"}, {"text": "At whose suggestion did Richard marry Berengaria of Navarre in 1191?", "correct": "His mother's - Eleanor of Aquitaine", "options": ["The French King's - Philip II", "His brother's - Prince John", "Ducas Comnenus - the ruler of Cyprus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis mother's - Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\n\tThe marriage took place on the 12th May at Limassol in Cyprus. The lands of Navarre were adjacent to those of Aquitaine, the part of Richard's own lands that he most loved. In spite of this marriage Richard and Berengaria had no children and Richard only lived openly with his wife when a charge of sodomy was brought against him. \n"}, {"text": "After he had taken Acre in the Holy Land what order did Richard give about the Muslims who had surrendered?", "correct": "He ordered them to be massacred.", "options": ["He ordered them to be set free.", "He ordered them to be sold into slavery in Egypt.", "He ordered them to transported to England."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe ordered them to be massacred.\n\n\tThe numbers given for this act of slaughter were 2,700. The fact that the victims had surrendered rather than been taken prisoner during the battle made this crime seem even worse. It is suggested that Richard I lost his patience over the negotiations and ordered the men, women and children to be butchered in full sight of the opposing army of Saladin. In contrast Saladin enjoyed a reputation for treating his prisoners well. \n"}, {"text": "Whom had Richard nominated as his heir if anything should happen to him whilst he was away on Crusade?", "correct": "His nephew Arthur", "options": ["His brother Geoffrey", "His brother John", "His brother-in-law William of Sicily"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis nephew Arthur.\n\n\tIn spite of this nomination Richard actually left England to be run by William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely. He was another Frenchman much hated by most of the people of England. Longchamp operated under the supervision of Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Before he died Richard nominated John as his heir in spite of Arthur's better claim through an elder brother. Thus he caused the succession to be disputed once again. \n"}, {"text": "Richard I was killed at Chalus as a result of gangrene from a crossbow wound. Why had he gone to Chalus in the first place?", "correct": "He wanted to claim some gold that a peasant had dug up.", "options": ["He wanted to rescue his minstrel Blondel from the castle.", "He wanted to see his mother for one last time.", "He wanted to obtain a piece of the true cross from the castle there."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe wanted to claim some gold that a peasant had dug up.\n\n\tRichard's motivation on this occasion seems to have been greed. The peasant had passed the gold to his immediate overlord and Richard had demanded that it be passed on to him. It was a trivial way for a king to die. Typically Richard carried it off in great style by pardoning the man who had fired the fatal crossbow bolt. \n"}, {"text": "Richard I died in 1199 at the age of 41. Where was his body buried?", "correct": "At Fontrevault near his father.", "options": ["In Poitiers near his mother.", "In Chateau Gaillard, the great castle he built for himself.", "In Westminster Abbey where he had been crowned."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt Fontrevault near his father.\n\n\tHis body was buried at Fontrevault but his heart was removed from his corpse and buried in Rouen. The building of Chateau Gaillard was just one of the ways he had found of costing his country a fortune. His captivity in Austria meant that a ransom equivalent to \u00a312 million in modern money had to be screwed out of the people of England for a man who showed no affection at all for the country. \n"}]}
