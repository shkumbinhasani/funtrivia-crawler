I will give you a clue as to the animal's name, and you will have to guess what it is.  Good luck!\n\nWe'll start off easy.  This smaller \"big cat\" species lives in North America.  It is named after its very characteristic tail.  It resembles a lynx because of the tufts of hair on its ears.  What animal might this be?", "correct": "Bobcat & Bobcats", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBobcat & Bobcats.\n\n\tBobcats are very small big cats; they are only about twice the size of the average house cat.  They are very closely related to the lynx.  There are 12 subspecies of bobcats, such as the Goodwin and Mearns bobcats.\r bobCAT \n"}, {"text": "Bugs are animals, right?  This should be a fairly easy one.  These bugs are just the beginning stage of another kind of bug.  They live their life growing very quickly by constantly eating.  What might this little creature be called?", "correct": "Caterpillar & Caterpillars", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaterpillar & Caterpillars.\n\n\tThere are many different species of caterpillar.  Each species will become either a butterfly or a moth.  A species of caterpillar will only become one type of butterfly or moth, however.  For instance, a monarch caterpillar will turn into a monarch butterfly, not a zebra butterfly, or any other kind.  When caterpillars grow large enough, they will form a crysalis, or cocoon, and stay in there for a long period of time while they somehow form large wings and become butterflies or moths.  They are, appropriately, in the same family as butterflies and moths; Lepidoptera.\r CATerpillar \n"}, {"text": "This next animal has a bird named after it.  The answer is a plural of this farm animal.  They eat grass/hay and drink water.  What group of animals might this be?", "correct": "Cattle", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCattle.\n\n\t'Cattle' is the plural form of 'cow'.  There are many species of cow.  There are dairy cattle and beef cattle.  Dairy cattle are usually milked.  The milk comes from the udder.  Beef cattle is where we get a lot of meat here in the US, from hamburgers to steaks to ground beef.  The most recognizable cow is white with black spots, a common dairy cow, and it is often joked that a brown cow with black spots is a chocolate milk cow.  The bird that feeds off of what the cattle kick up with their hooves is called the cattle egret.  I added that they drink water because many people think they drink milk.  They produce milk, but do not drink it (except when they are very young).\r CATtle \n"}, {"text": "A group of these might be called a mob, a clan, or a gang.  They're the African equivalent of the prairie dog...  No matter what you do to try and stop them, they will keep popping their heads out of their holes.  They're everywhere.  An animal that enters their burrow backwards has a best friend that is this creature in several Disney movies.

They live in the Kalahari desert and in South Africa.\r meerKAT \n"}, {"text": "This animal is the most common and well-known species of the family Delphinidae.

What kind of animal might this be?", "correct": "Bottlenose Dolphin", "options": ["Orca/Killer Whale", "River Dolphin", "Pink Dolphin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBottlenose Dolphin.\n\n\tBottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin known.  Flipper is the famous bottlenose dolphin on TV and in movies I was alluding to.  It is interesting to know that technically, Tursiops truncatus is the common bottlenose dolphin, as there are now two species of bottlenose dolphins, the second being Tursiops aduncus, or the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin.\r bottlenose dolphin - Tursiops trunCATus \n"}, {"text": "It's time for another aquatic animal.  These creatures are from the order Siluriformes.  These aquatic animals are so named for a catlike quality.  What type of animal is this?", "correct": "Catfish & Catfishes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatfish & Catfishes.\n\n\tCatfish are usually bottom dwellers, where they eat dead matter on the bottom of the ocean or lake floor, so they are called detritivores.  They range in size greatly from the smaller candiru, which is only a few inches in length, to the Mekong giant catfish, which can weigh over a quarter of a ton.  The largest ever caught was nearly nine feet and 650 pounds!  The catfish is named so because they have whiskerlike appendages on their face, much like our beloved feline.\r CATfish \n"}, {"text": "Although there are many different species of this bird, they all are nearly identical.

Most oystercatchers look basically the same, but the variable oystercatcher is unique.  They are variable, so they can be all sorts of colors, like the blue variable oystercatcher.\r oysterCATcher \n"}, {"text": "We now move on to another bird.
