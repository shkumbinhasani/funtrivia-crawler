{"id": "131216", "name": "'The Matrix', Part 1: Before We Reload... Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies L-P", " The Matrix"], "questions": [{"text": "'The Matrix' opens with a conversation, and a rather revealing one at that if one is paying attention.  Which two characters have this introductory discussion?  \n", "correct": "Trinity and Cypher", "options": ["Morpheus and Cypher", "Trinity and Morpheus", "Neo and Trinity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrinity and Cypher.\n\n\tThis elucidating conversation includes a prediction by Cypher that 'we're gonna kill him', in reference to Neo, and also initiates suspicion that an informant exists among the protagonists.  Of course, a neophyte watcher of the film would not pick up these nuances, and the conversation comes off as mostly cryptic to the first-time viewer.  Listening to the conversation again after having watched the film a number of times, however, allows for some keen insight. \n"}, {"text": "After discovering that her phone line is tapped, Trinity is forced to escape from the truly wretched confines of the roach motel in which she is holed up.  After contacting Morpheus, Trinity is instructed to reach a public phone on a street corner.  The street corner is located at the intersection of which two streets?  \n", "correct": "Wells and Lake", "options": ["Market and Ash", "University and Oxford", "State and Indiana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWells and Lake.\n\n\tDuring this intense opening fight scene we see glimpses of the possibilities within this film.  Trinity is able to defy gravity, leap across building tops and literally 'fly'.  In addition, we discover through one reverse kick to the head of a policeman that she is extraordinarily flexible!  We are also introduced to the three agents in the film, all of whom apparently have similar super powers. \n"}, {"text": "The scene now shifts to a dark apartment.  Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, is napping in front of his active computer.  Suddenly, the computer screen goes blank, and three words appear...'Wake up Neo.'  Promptly enough, Neo loses his slumber just in time to see another cryptic message on his monitor, 'The Matrix has you.'  A third message soon appears, an allusion to which piece of classic literature?  ", "correct": "Alice in Wonderland", "options": ["Robinson Crusoe", "Tom Sawyer", "Crime and Punishment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlice in Wonderland.\n\n\tThe second message reads, 'Follow the white rabbit', a reference to Lewis Carroll's classic 'Alice in Wonderland'.  This 'Alice' motif continues throughout the first quarter of the film.  A third message follows on Neo's computer screen, namely 'Knock, knock, Neo'.  He has guests... \n"}, {"text": "A bit out of sorts, the groggy and disoriented Neo is next visited by an interesting rabble who apparently have some shady business dealings with our hero.  In return for a wad of cash, Neo provides a mini-disc to his friend Choi.  Neo has the disc stashed in a hollowed-out book called 'Simulacra and Simulation', a work by which French social theorist?  ", "correct": "Jean Baudrillard", "options": ["Jacques Lacan", "Michael Foucault", "Pierre Bourdieu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJean Baudrillard.\n\n\tIt seems that the creators of the film, the Wachowski brothers, are voracious readers of philosophy and, more especially, post-modernist social theory.  The theme of the Baudrillard volume certainly fits with the film, discussions inside the tome revolve around the simulated reality that human beings have created for themselves using symbols (simulacra).  Of course, this sort of literature is very dense and difficult to understand, but it's well worth a look if you have the time. \n"}, {"text": "Neo, prompted by a tattoo he sees on the shoulder of Choi's lady friend, decides to join his visitors at a nearby nightclub.  Here, he meets Trinity for the first time.  While chatting with Trinity in the seedy nightclub, which performer's music plays in the background?", "correct": "Rob Zombie", "options": ["Rage Against the Machine", "Marilyn Manson", "Nine Inch Nails"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRob Zombie.\n\n\tThe Rob Zombie song heard in the background is 'Dragula', one of the various hits from the hard-core Matrix soundtrack (a song by the band Prodigy can also be heard).  The tattoo referred to here is the white rabbit, which Neo/Alice follows to the nightclub.  Before Neo leaves the club that night, Trinity manages to further intrigue and confuse him with discussions of Morpheus and the Matrix... \n"}, {"text": "Habitually late for work, we find Neo being chewed out in the following scene by his condescending boss.  At which faceless corporate entity does Neo work?  ", "correct": "Metacortex", "options": ["Primaneutics", "Alphametrix", "Theradatics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMetacortex.\n\n\tWe're not certain what exactly is done at Metacortex, but we do discover that Neo, aka Thomas Anderson, has his very own cubicle, a la Dilbert.  It's no wonder that Neo gives up this meaningless job to discover the secrets of the Matrix.  The name 'Metacortex' is an interesting one...another hint at the deeper meaning of the film, that is, escaping the bounds of what we believe is real in our minds (meta = to go beyond, cortex = outer covering, in this case a reference to the cerebral cortex of the brain). \n"}, {"text": "Neo's day at work only gets worse following his meeting with his boss; the agents are coming!  Morpheus attempts to help Neo escape the agents by delivering a package containing which of these devices?  ", "correct": "Telephone", "options": ["Machine gun", "Desktop computer", "Two-way radio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelephone.\n\n\tMorpheus' telephone trick is suitably impressive, but unfortunately he is unable to convince Neo to properly follow his instructions, which include climbing out on a window ledge towards a scaffolding.  Naturally, Neo chickens out when a strong gust of wind sweeps the telephone out of his hand and down to the street far below.  Frankly, Morpheus' expectations for Neo are a bit too high at this point... \n"}, {"text": "Following Neo's failed attempt to escape, Agent Smith and his associates are able to capture Neo and take him into custody.  They attempt to make a deal with Neo, but he isn't having any of it.  Neo demands a phone call; he 'knows his rights'.  He also asserts that the agents can't scare him with their tactics, which he describes with which of the following adjectives? ", "correct": "Gestapo", "options": ["Mafioso", "Nazi", "Fascist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGestapo.\n\n\tYes, it's true that the agents can't scare Neo with their 'gestapo crap'.  However, they can scare him by sealing his mouth with flesh and releasing a quasi-metal bug into his belly button!  Sounds pretty 'gestapo' to me... \n"}, {"text": "The agents 'bug' Neo, but then release him, apparently believing that he will lead them to Morpheus.  Morpheus contacts Neo and sends Trinity and some of his other acolytes to retrieve the poor, dazed fellow.  In the car that has been dispatched to pick up Neo, along with Trinity, are Switch and Apoc.  Juxtaposed against the nurturing and gentle Trinity, who coaxes Neo with her smooth talk, the impatient and somewhat belligerent Switch insists that Neo follow their directions without question.  She refers to Neo by what cleverly derisive name?  ", "correct": "Copper top", "options": ["Monkey wrench", "Chemical bag", "Pin cushion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCopper top.\n\n\tThe 'copper top' comment is a reference to the fact that Neo's mind is still locked into the Matrix while his real body is being utilized essentially as a battery for the machines.  If I am not mistaken, a 'copper top' is a Duracell... \n"}, {"text": "Neo is now brought to an eerie, drab mansion, where he finally meets Morpheus face-to-face (well, sort of...remember, this is still the matrix!)  Morpheus presents Neo with a choice, he can choose to walk away or he can choose to discover what the Matrix really is.  As expected, Neo chooses the latter.  While preparing to take this leap of faith, Neo meets Cypher for the first time.  Cypher's first words to Neo are a reference to which classic American film?  ", "correct": "The Wizard of Oz", "options": ["Citizen Kane", "Casablanca", "The Godfather"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wizard of Oz.\n\n\tMorpheus provides Neo with a pill, which he swallows.  Neo soon learns that the pill is part of a 'trace program' meant to help Morpheus' team locate Neo's real body.  Of course, Neo is still in the dark, and responds to Morpheus' comment by asking, 'What does that mean?'  Cypher interrupts, 'It means, buckle your seat belt Dorothy, cause Kansas...it's going bye bye.'  Now Neo is both Alice and Dorothy all rolled up into one!
