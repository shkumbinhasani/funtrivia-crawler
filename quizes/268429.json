He and his wife Sheila live in a scummy ghetto in the poor part of town and their daughter, Cathy, has influenza.  Ben decides (after watching the FreeVee) that he will participate on one of the Network's highly-rated Reality TV shows in order to get his family the money they need to survive.  Arriving at the Network Games building, he gives the security guards an ID card and proceeds through a lengthy examination which will determine the game he's right for. \n"}, {"text": "On what floor of the Network Games building does Ben Richards meet with Dan Killian?", "correct": "Sixth", "options": ["Fifth", "Fourth", "Ninth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSixth.\n\n\tAfter an intense physical, mental, and psychological investigation, Ben makes his way thorough the system to the sixth floor where he and two others are interviewed by Dan Killian.  Here he is told he will be on the Network's most popular, lucrative, and dangerous game show, \"The Running Man\" which almost ensures his death in return for cash for his family.  Ben accepts the offer and is given a 4,800 Network Dollar cash advance, some of which he sends to his family.  He is holed up in a room for his last few days of freedom without contact with Sheila and Cathy and he waits out his time. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the host of \"The Running Man\"?", "correct": "Bobby Thompson", "options": ["Richard Bachman", "Dan Killian", "Evan McCone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBobby Thompson.\n\n\tWhen game day comes, Ben is pulled on stage in front of an angry crowd where America gets its first look at the man they'll need to be searching for.  Anyone who spots Ben and gives 'The Hunters' good information about his whereabouts is given a cash reward.  When Ben is led out of the studio, Killian expresses the fact that he likes Ben and he warns him to stay near his own people. Ben also leaves with a water-proof/shock-proof video camera and numerous tapes which must be sent twice a day for the duration of his time in the game.  Ben quickly assumes a new identity and makes his way to New York and down the coast. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Ben burn down the YMCA?", "correct": "Boston", "options": ["New York", "Philadelphia", "Providence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston.\n\n\tBen soon rushes off to Boston where he feels like he is in somewhat of a safe place as he is not only quite far from home, but he's also amongst his own people (poor and unwell).  When he reaches the YMCA though, he realizes he may have been closely followed.  He decides to make a move and hides away in a back room before setting fire to the building and escaping out a vent pipe to the sewers.  When he manages to find his way to the street, he is spotted by a young kid who instantly recognizes him.  Ben asks the kid (Stacey) for help and he and his brother take him home. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Bradley's younger sister?", "correct": "Cassie", "options": ["Wendy", "Stacey", "Mary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCassie.\n\n\tBradley and Stacey take Ben into their house and talk with him about his situation.  They also agree upon the fact that \"The Running Man\" simply promotes hate through the media since it shows the families of the cops that Richards killed when the YMCA burnt down.  Bradley introduces Richards to his sister, Cassie, who has asthma due to the immense amount of the pollution that the future creates. The two decide to escape and Richards is placed in Bradley's trunk as they travel across the country.  When they arrive at their location, Ben imitates a priest and stays at the Winthrop House in New England while mailing tapes back to Bradley in Boston (in order to keep his location secret). \n"}, {"text": "Where does Ben meet Elton Parrakis?", "correct": "Portland", "options": ["Augusta", "None of these", "Rockport"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortland.\n\n\tWhen Ben stays in the Winthrop House as Father Ogden Grassner, he discovers that the other running man, Laughlin, was been shot and killed.  He decides that his stay at the Winthrop House has been too long and drives to Portland to stay with Bradley's friend, Elton Parrakis, who lives with his mother Virginia. Unfortunately, his mother, fearing for her son, calls the cops and the two are forced to flee through Portland.  They evade police, but they crash and Elton is severely wounded.  They drive to an abandoned construction site where Elton drives off to get the cops off his trail, leaving Ben on his own once again. \n"}, {"text": "Where is the airport that Ben has Amelia drive him to?", "correct": "Derry", "options": ["Castle Rock", "Rockland", "Freeport"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDerry.\n\n\tAfter Elton leaves Ben at the Super Pine Tree Mall, Ben discovers it might be a great place to hide until he's in the clear.  He soon discovers, however, that he needs to continue on though because he needs to mail two tapes a day, and if he is in a place without a mailbox, he needs to venture out a lot.  He gives the tapes to a boy at a local gas station (who luckily doesn't recognize him) and jumps into the car of Amelia Williams, an upper-middle-class woman.  She agrees to drive him to Derry out of fear and Ben alerts the authorities that he is doing so. \n"}, {"text": "What does Ben pretend is a bomb in order to prevent cops from shooting him?", "correct": "A purse", "options": ["A box of chocolates", "A car manual", "A hat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA purse.\n\n\tWhen Ben and Amelia arrive at Voigt Airport, he is given a megaphone to list off what he needs- free passage and a plane with a ghost crew.  The police, and the lead Hunter, Evan McCone, believe he is lying about the bomb, but Ben sends Amelia out and tells her to lie for him.  He begins counting out the time that the cops have left and they supply him with a plane while interrogating Amelia (to no avail).  He is escorted with his 'bomb' to the plane where he and McCone discuss the fact that he is the longest-lasting Running Man they've ever had (who had lasted eight and a half days). \n"}, {"text": "Ben is offered Evan McCone's job.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhen Ben boards the plane, he asks that Amelia and McCone be brought on as well and he straps them in for the ride.  When they take off, he speaks with the pilot and his co-pilot about the trip they'll be taking and they begin heading south from the Canada/Vermont border.  Soon, Ben has a talk with Dan Killian and Killian reveals that he is one of the best runners they've ever had and that his hunch about liking him was a smart one. However, the plane had numerous bomb detectors on it, and they were able to determine that he was not in possession of a real bomb.  He also reveals that Cathy and Sheila were killed by inner-city thugs and that he is no longer fighting to save anybody. Ben is shocked by the news and is offered McCone's job as Killian feels he is no longer fit for the job (having let Ben steal a plane and force him aboard). \n"}, {"text": "Ultimately, where does the plane containing Ben crash?", "correct": "Co-op City", "options": ["Boston", "Detroit", "Denver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCo-op City.\n\n\tBen thinks about the offer and decides to accept it before disconnecting his call with Killian.  However, he soon has a change of heart and kills the pilot and co-pilot of the plane.  He forces Amelia to take the sole parachute on the plane and she escapes.  McCone hears the brawl from the back of the plane and emerges to defeat Ben, but the two end up shooting each other.  McCone is killed instantly and Ben is fatally wounded.  He manages to make his way to the cockpit and overrides the plane's automatic controls causing it to crash into the Network Games Building in Co-op City. \n"}]}
