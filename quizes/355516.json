Tough [A] "], "questions": [{"text": "The first quiz I ever wrote was about very small countries. One I failed to include was one of the smallest countries in the world. Which country, consisting of only small islands, was once known as Pleasant Island?", "correct": "Nauru", "options": ["Niue", "Palau", "Fiji"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNauru.\n\n\tNauru gained independence in 1968.  Its capital is Yaren. The overall size of the country is only 8.1 square miles, so it is no wonder why the population was under 10,000 in 2012! \n"}, {"text": "One of my early quizzes also did well enough to reach my highest rating at the time. The quiz was about my favorite movie at that time, so now a question about my favorite movie.  \n\nThough the famous \"mirror scene\" did not originate with the film, the Marx Brothers made it famous in which film, starring Groucho as Rufus Firefly?", "correct": "Duck Soup", "options": ["A Night in Casablanca", "Animal Crackers", "Horse Feathers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuck Soup.\n\n\t\"Duck Soup\" was a Marx Brothers film released in 1933. Though Charlie Chaplin had scenes featuring a \"mirror\" as early as 1916, this film made it famous. The scene? One character, dressed as another character, was almost caught (in this case, Pinky was dressed as Firefly, and they found each other in the house). To outsmart the one, the other dressed similarly began mimicking all the movements of the one, so the one thought he was simply looking at a reflection.Somehow, they managed to walk in a circle, studying each other, with the one still unaware it was not a reflection. It was not until a third person bumped into one that the original realized something was amiss. \n"}, {"text": "I wrote an alphabetics quiz with my team in 2008, which became my first Editor's Choice a few years later. Since the alphabet contains 26 letters, and the quiz only had 25 questions, this will be a question about the left out letter, Z.\n\nZ is for zebra. In \"The Life of Pi\", in Pi's more believable story, he replaces animals with people. Who is represented by the zebra?", "correct": "Sailor", "options": ["Pi himself", "Pi's mother", "Cook"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSailor.\n\n\t\"Life of Pi\", written by Yann Martel, was released in 2001. It became a motion picture in 2012. In the book and film, Pi is the only human survivor after a ship sinks. Some of the zoo animals that were aboard manage to escape with him, however, including a zebra, orangutan, and hyena. During his adventure, the hyena attacks the zebra, and the orangutan fights back. After defeating the zebra, the hyena goes for the orangutan. Shortly after, the tiger (named Richard Parker) emerges from the small boat and kills the hyena.\r When being interviewed as to why the ship sunk, Pi was asked to tell his story. As the first was too unbelievable, he made up a different one. In this version, Pi becomes the tiger, the hyena is the cook, Pi's mother is the orangutan, and the zebra is the sailor. In this story, the cook is a brute man who kills the sailor (the hyena attacked the zebra). Pi's mother tried to prevent this cruel killing, but was in turn killed by the cook (the orangutan fought the hyena, and lost). Pi was so mad at the cook at this point that he killed him in the same way (the tiger killed the hyena). \n"}, {"text": "My tenth category of quizzes was hobbies, and I wrote about the popular pastime known as \"Sport Stacking\".  In this competitive game, players make stacks with special cups. The first round of \"The Cycle\" contains two pyramids of three and a pyramid of six. Then two pyramids of six are created for the second round, and the final round is a pyramid of ten.  How many cups are needed to perform \"The Cycle\"?", "correct": "Twelve", "options": ["Ten", "Thirty-Four", "Thirty-Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelve.\n\n\tOne only needs twelve cups to perform \"The Cycle\". It begins with the twelve cups stacked in three stacks; three in one, six in the second, and three in the last. The three is made into a pyramid (two on the bottom and one on top), then the six are made into a larger pyramid, and the final three are made into a pyramid. The pyramids are taken down in the order they were created, but when the final set of three is taken down, the player moves it over to the other set of three and makes a pyramid of six. The other six are then made into a pyramid. The first is taken down, and those cups are then used to take down the second set of six. When a full stack of twelve is accomplished, one can begin building the biggest pyramid of them all, with ten cups. The two cups left over are used to deconstruct this large pyramid, returning the piles to the original 3-6-3 set up.\r Oh, and in national competitions held in Denver, Colorado, competitors can do this in under six seconds! \n"}, {"text": "My 100th quiz came so quickly that I forgot to do anything special for it. The quiz was the second in a series of four; a series about the mini-games of \"Mario Party DS\". Since you may not be thrilled about a video games question (though it was bound to happen), I will ask the question about my favorite minigame with a twist.\n\nMy favorite of these games is called \"Cucumber Jacks\". In this game, you compete to slice a cucumber into thin slices faster than your opponents. These slices sometimes don't come out exactly round, either; with which of these handheld devices would you be able to make the thinnest slices?", "correct": "Vegetable Peeler", "options": ["Cheese Slicer", "Bread Cutter", "Paring Knife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVegetable Peeler.\n\n\tThough you may, technically, be able to use all of these devices to slice a cucumber, a few of the choices may not be your best option. Paring knives do cut cucumbers into slices quite well, but for the thinnest of slices, and for the \"Cucumber Jacks\" minigame, a vegetable peeler is the best thing to use. There are many kinds of vegetable peelers out there, but the one in question can also be used to slice (and looks like a miniature handheld mandolin).\r \"Mario Party DS\" was the eleventh in a series of party games featuring Mario (surprise surprise), and was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007. \n"}, {"text": "After I had cemented my love for quiz-writing, the Author's Lounge was created, and it was quite a success. The first commission on this board was a wonderful experience for authors, and I took part in it. The quiz I wrote for it was a bit somber, because it described accidental deaths.\n\nThe British soap \"Emmerdale\" features a character named Nicola King. Her daughter was Angelica, who was portrayed by a child actor who died when her dress caught fire at her grandmother's house. What was the name of the girl who portrayed Angelica in 2009?", "correct": "Sophie Firth", "options": ["Sophie Powles", "Grace Cassidy", "Rebecca Bakes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSophie Firth.\n\n\tSophie Firth portrayed Angelica King as a baby in 2009 on the British soap \"Emmerdale\" (Rebecca Bakes portrayed the character later). Sadly, on December 2, 2012, Sophie's dress caught fire from a gas fire at her grandmother's house. She was rushed to the hospital, and on the 7th, she was given a skin graft (due to a 70% burn cover). Unfortunately, on December 11th, 2012, Sophie passed away due to a blood infection, causing her organs to fail. She was three-and-a-half years old. \n"}, {"text": "After quite a bit of quiz-writing, I realized that I had not written in all 20 categories, so I made myself the goal to do so. When my first religion quiz went online, this completed my goal; and I had each of the main categories represented through my quizzes. The religion quiz was about some famous Bible verses, but I used my own copy of the Bible.\n\nIn my copy of the Bible, John 11:35 is translated slightly different than the norm. It says \"Jesus gave way to tears\". Which of these translations did I use?", "correct": "New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures", "options": ["New International Version", "King James Bible", "The Living Bible"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.\n\n\tJohn 11:35 is most commonly translated as \"Jesus wept\", as it is translated in the three alternate options of the question. The 'New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures', however, translates this scripture as \"Jesus gave way to tears\". The scripture tells us of when Jesus mourned for the loss of Lazarus (even though he knew he'd be resurrecting his friend). \n"}, {"text": "In the Author's Lounge, authors often discussed the need for twitching and chocolate while they had a quiz in the queue (we're an odd bunch, what can I say?). Somehow, we created a wonderful \"vault\" that stored all the chocolate, and Kyleisalive (editor who created the Lounge) suggested someone make a quiz about breaking into the vault. So I did.\n\nInside the vault are all sorts of chocolate. Back to reality, one can buy chocolate with all kinds of goodies inside.  Which of these is not something one can find in a chocolate bar at the supermarket?", "correct": "One can find all these, and so much more", "options": ["Bacon", "Blueberries", "Habaneros"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne can find all these, and so much more.\n\n\tChocolate has been popular for centuries, but as time has gone on, people found new ingredients to put inside a chocolate bar. Eventually, fruits and nuts were added to chocolate for a sweet and crunchy bar. Imitating the popular Mayan cocoa drink, chilies and other hot peppers (like habaneros) were added into chocolate.One company even decided to put meat inside the chocolate, and \"Mo's Bacon Bar\" was created. This met with more success than expected, and other chocolate companies began making chocolate bacon bars, and the race for new chocolate flavors was on. Chocolate also became a flavoring agent for many bizarre things: chocolate soda, chocolate beer, and chocolate noodles are a few of the strange chocolate delights. \n"}, {"text": "For my 250th quiz, I wanted to do something bizarre. So I wrote an entire quiz without asking a single question (I'd already asked several thousand). The twist was that I was writing about the question mark, without using a question mark.\n\nThe four kinds of sentences are: declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory. The correct answer is the one that uses a question mark.  ", "correct": "Interrogative", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nInterrogative.\n\n\tInterrogative sentences are ones that ask questions. Some of these can be direct, and ask questions using the question mark (e.g. 'where are my keys?'). They can also be asked indirectly, where one ponders the answer to a question (e.g. 'I wonder where my keys are').\r Yes, I realized I used a question mark in this question, though the original quiz did not use it whatsoever. But I never made that promise for this question. ;-) \n"}, {"text": "I was thrilled when I received my second Editor's Choice award for a quiz in the music category. The quiz was a collaboration between me and Kyleisalive, where we discussed our favorite songs that mention video games.\n\nSomehow, we missed the song simply known as \"Video Games\". The song was released in 2011 by which artist?", "correct": "Lana Del Rey", "options": ["Taylor Swift", "Enya", "Fiona Apple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLana Del Rey.\n\n\tElizabeth Grant, known as Lana Del Rey, released \"Video Games\" as her debut single in October of 2011. It appeared on her extended play album \"Lana Del Rey\" in January of 2012, as well as her major label debut album \"Born to Die\", released in January of 2012 as well. \n"}]}
