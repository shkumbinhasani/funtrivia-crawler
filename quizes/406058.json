{"id": "406058", "name": "Taking Stock of Raccoon City Quiz | Resident Evil | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis"], "questions": [{"text": "How many Hip Pouches can you obtain in the game?", "correct": "Eight & 8", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight & 8.\n\n\tThough only six could be collected as wither Claire or Leon in \"Resident Evil 2\", you're able to nab eight total in this game, five of which are added when you're playing as Jill (as early as in the Downtown and Uptown regions of Raccoon City), two are added when you're playing as Carlos (once in the Raccoon City Police Department and once in Spencer Memorial Hospital), and one can be purchased in the post-game shop to be used on subsequent playthroughs.  Each Hip Pouch adds two inventory slots to your character.  They aren't necessary, but they are a big help. \n"}, {"text": "While Carlos will never get to use this item, Jill needs it to open yellow locks.  What's the tool?", "correct": "Lockpick", "options": ["Skeleton Key", "Bolt Cutters", "Small Key"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLockpick.\n\n\tThroughout the game there will be a number of important to-dos and some less-important 'nice-things-to-have' that you'll only really be able to access with the proper tools at your disposal. \r Jill, having faced off against these certain horrors at the Spencer Mansion (in \"Resident Evil\") has shown off her lockpicking abilities before.  That's why, when she finds the Lockpick on the body outside the Subway Power Substation, she'll be the one to make the most use out of it. \r It'll open any yellow locks in the game, many of which seal silver cases containing weapon upgrades, strong ammo, and the like. \n"}, {"text": "In the Sewers you'll need a Battery Pack to open the electronic door locks.  How many inventory slots will you need to take this with you?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["None", "One", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tIt becomes apparent when you stumble into the Sewers that your Lockpick isn't a solution to every problem, especially since this under-street part of the map seems to have higher security that you'd think (maybe it has something to do with the awful creatures being spawned there).  You need to get your hands on a Battery Pack, and it's big. This two-slot item has to be left in the lock for you to have continual access through certain passages.  There are three of these doors, two of which are absolute necessities to get through, but you'll have to get crafty and solve the door puzzles to make the tough situation work in your favour. Once you're out of the area, the item can be discarded. \n"}, {"text": "Whose ID Card will grant you access to specific rooms in the RPD Building?", "correct": "Brad Vickers", "options": ["Leon S Kennedy", "Forest Speyer", "Chris Redfield"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrad Vickers.\n\n\tWhile Jill gets caught up with erm... delays in the subway, Carlos will head to the Raccoon City Police Department to rendezvous with Dr. Bard, a man who might have insight into the T-Virus Vaccine.  What this means is stepping foot into yet another building with a dearth of awful creatures to maneuver around. Players of \"Resident Evil 2\" will catch some obvious easter eggs along the way, but everyone else might be surprised to face off against their first Lickers on the hunt for the S.T.A.R.S. Office.  Brad, who was bitten at the start of the game, appears near the front door.  His keycard will be integral to navigating the building. \n"}, {"text": "There's C4 in the Shower Room of the RPD Building.  To create a Detonator for it, you need a Battery and which other item?", "correct": "Electronic Gadget", "options": ["S.T.A.R.S. Badge", "Calculator", "Computer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElectronic Gadget.\n\n\tIf you've entered the RPD Building later in the night (as Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield in \"Resident Evil 2\" then you'll know that the Shower Room is likely to be in a bit of a state, but what you might not know until now is that it's Carlos' fault.  In an effort to reach the S.T.A.R.S. Office on the third floor of the west wing, he'll have to combine an Electronic Gadget with a Battery, stick it to some C4, and blast through the showers to gain passage. Interestingly, Leon/Claire need to do the same thing, but in a storage space (also on the top floor) to get a hidden emblem during their visit. \n"}, {"text": "The Tape Player and Audiocassette Tape are both necessary items found on which map?", "correct": "Hospital", "options": ["Orphanage", "Sewers", "School"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHospital.\n\n\tWhen Carlos brings an unconscious Jill to the Spencer Memorial Hospital he'll drop her off in a bed and start searching the building for a vaccine.  The problem is that the vaccine is in Dr. Bard's lab, and the only way to gain access to that room is by bypassing his voice-activated security protocol.  While you can find a Tape Player in the nurse's station next to his lab, the player will be empty. It'll take some navigating to find the Audiocassette Tape, a recording Dr. Bard made for human resources, and a moment to combine it with the player to make it all work.  And then you'll never need that tape again. \n"}, {"text": "The Vaccine Sample found by Carlos can cure the T-Virus.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAfter Jill is attacked and poisoned by Nemesis, there's only one solution, and it comes in the form of a T-Virus Vaccine Sample created by Dr. Bard in the Spencer Memorial Hospital.  Most of Carlos' efforts will involving accessing that specific lab and when he finally gets in, he'll find a single purple syringe containing what he needs to save Jill's life.  It'll be only a matter of time-- about the length of one long zombie battle-- before she can resume her explorations. \n"}, {"text": "The NEST 2 Lab's Override Key is actually which of these?", "correct": "Flash Drive", "options": ["Metal Disc", "Credit Card", "Voice ID"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlash Drive.\n\n\tJill can find a security terminal in the NEST 2 Lab's vaccine synthesizing room, and when she engages with it she'll receive a single Flash Drive.  Further inspection of this will allow her to identify it as an Override Key, an emergency deice used by employees to override the lab's security protocols in the event of an emergency evacuation.  This means that any doors with red control panels in the lab are now yours to pass through.  Easy as that. \n"}, {"text": "The Antigen and the Adjuvant are combined to create which of these?", "correct": "Vaccine Base", "options": ["Purple Vial", "T-Virus Solution", "T-Antidote"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVaccine Base.\n\n\tYour goal in the NEST 2 Laboratory is to synthesize a vaccine, but to do this, according to a note found in the vaccine lab, you need to obtain an Antigen and an Adjuvant, both of which combine to create a working Vaccine Base.  The machine to synthesize these is in the same room as the note, but the two halves of the puzzle are elsewhere in the NEST (naturally).  The inert T-Virus Culture Sample (the Antigen), is in a large centrifuge in Lab 1; the Adjuvant (simply referred to as a Liquid-Filled Test Tube) is in the Incubation Lab.  Combining them creates the Vaccine Base, and placing that into the synthesizer creates the Vaccine. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these weapons does not have upgrades or add-ons that Jill/Carlos can find throughout the game?", "correct": "Grenade Launcher", "options": ["Assault Rifle", "G19 Handgun", "Shotgun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrenade Launcher.\n\n\tThough the Grenade Launcher uses four different types of rounds throughout the game (Mine Rounds, Explosive Rounds, Flame Rounds, and Acid Rounds), its versatility suggests that further upgrades are not necessarily needed.  On the other hand, the G19 Handgun can be upgraded by a Dot Sight, the Shotgun can get two barrel upgrades and a Semi-Auto attachment, and Carlos' Assault Rifle can get a sight and grip attachment.  The MAG also gets a bonus attachment-- an extended barrel. \n"}]}
