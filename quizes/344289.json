{"id": "344289", "name": "Weapons and Equippables of \"Skyward Sword\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Skyward Sword"], "questions": [{"text": "Perhaps the most important weapon in the game is Link's sword.  After the completion of which dungeon does Link hold the Master Sword?", "correct": "Fire Sanctuary", "options": ["Sky Keep", "Lanayru Mining Facility", "The Sandship"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFire Sanctuary.\n\n\tLink goes through six different swords throughout the game (or at least that many versions).  Starting with the Practice Sword in Skyloft at the start of the game, he receives the Goddess Sword from a pedestal in the statue of the goddess in the same city.  Every time Link absorbs the flames from the fourth, fifth, and sixth dungeon, his sword upgrades.  He receives the Goddess Longsword, Goddess White Sword, and the Master Sword.  Finally, Link ends up with the True Master Sword when he travels back in time to the Sealed Temple of yesteryear.\rRegardless of which sword Link uses (save the Practice Sword), if he lifts it skyward he will magically power it up. \n"}, {"text": "Who gives Link the Hylian Shield?", "correct": "The Thunder Dragon", "options": ["Rupin", "Impa", "Headmaster Gaepora"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Thunder Dragon.\n\n\tLink can carry up to ten different shields in the game.  Three of them can be purchased in the bazaar in Skyloft as you progress through the first three dungeons of the game, and each of them can be upgraded twice.  The Hylian Shield, Link's traditional shield from earlier games, can be earned under special circumstances.  If you visit the Thunder Dragon in Lanayru Gorge you can receive the Hylian Shield after eight rounds of battle.  This shield will not break unlike other earlier shields; it's also larger than the others. \n"}, {"text": "Link's Slingshot only upgrades once...into what new item?", "correct": "Scattershot", "options": ["Sling Bow", "Sharpshot", "Supersling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScattershot.\n\n\tThe Slingshot is found by Link in Faron Woods, given to him by the Kikwi elder after he locates the other Kikwis in the forest.  The Slingshot is Link's first long-range weapon, allowing him to hit enemies and switches from a distance.  To upgrade, Link needs to spend fifty Rupees, two Dusk Relics, two Amber Relics, and three Jelly Blobs.  Each shot from the Scattershot, when fully drawn back, will break into pieces, striking the enemy with more force than a single strike.  Three types of seed satchels are also available and can be upgraded in the same way to be held in the Adventure Pouch. \n"}, {"text": "When Link wields Bombs, which of these is not an option he can use?", "correct": "Bury", "options": ["Roll", "Throw", "Put Down"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBury.\n\n\tLink receives a Bomb Bag after defeating Lizalfos in the Earth Sanctuary, the game's second dungeon.  Containing a mere ten bombs, the Bomb Bag can be upgraded three times in the same way as Link's Seed Satchels.  Link can do an overhead toss of the Bombs with a wave of the Wii Remote or, if the Wii Remote goes underhand, toss a Bomb along the ground, rolling it to a target or underneath objects.  Likewise, by simply pressing the A button, Link will drop a bomb in front of him. \n"}, {"text": "Where does the Beetle upgrade to the Hook Beetle?", "correct": "Lanayru Desert", "options": ["Eldin Volcano", "Faron Woods", "Skyloft Bazaar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLanayru Desert.\n\n\tThe Beetle is the item obtained in the very first dungeon of the game, Skyview Temple in the Faron Woods.  Link can pilot this item through the key to hit switches, collect items, and break ropes.  The Beetle is upgraded by a robot in the Lanayru Desert to feature hooks, allowing it to lift up bombs.  After this, Link can upgrade the Beetle into the Quick Beetle and Tough Beetle which gives a boost to speed and time of use respectively. The Beetle can also be used as an exploratory tool; Link can use it to scout areas he can't reach.  Some enemies are also scared of the Beetle (some Bokoblins, for example). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these can not be caught in the Bug Net?", "correct": "Fish", "options": ["Birds", "Tumbleweeds", "Bugs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFish.\n\n\tVisiting Beedle's airship overtop of Skyloft, Link can purchase the Bug Net and begin collecting bugs, a major component of potion upgrades.  The Bug Net will become a Big Bug Net when Link combines Tumbleweeds, Ancient Flowers, and an Evil Crystal in the Skyloft Bazaar.  Besides bugs, Link can also use the Bug Net to catch birds (for their feathers) and Tumbleweeds in Lanayru Desert.  These can, in turn, be used to upgrade even more items.  Another use for the net is to catch Fairies though you can do the same thing by scooping them into Bottles in your Adventure Pouch. \n"}, {"text": "To which directional button is the Goddess' Harp attached?", "correct": "Up", "options": ["Left", "Down", "Right"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUp.\n\n\tThe Goddess' Harp is given to Link by Princess Zelda herself before she heads into the Gate of Time at the Temple of Time in Lanayru Desert.  As soon as Link receives this instrument it will instantly be bound to the up position on the directional pad.  Link learns five songs on the harp and it can not be upgraded throughout the entire game; each of these songs is needed to either open the Thunderhead or to access the four different Silent Realm trial stages (one in Faron Woods, one in Eldin Volcano, one in Lanayru Desert, and one in Skyloft). \n"}, {"text": "How many different Medals can Link receive and keep in his Adventure Pouch during the game?", "correct": "Seven", "options": ["Ten", "Four", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven.\n\n\tMedals can be bought from Beedle's floating airshop or found in Goddess Cube chests above the surface if you're lucky.  When held, these medals can grant amazing bonuses.  The Heart Medal, Rupee Medal, and Treasure medal each grant the holder more of these during their travels while the Bug Medal locates different bugs on the map. The Potion Medal enhances certain potions' durations while the Life Medal adds another heart piece to Link's total (temporarily).  The Cursed Medal is unique in that it will do the same thing as the Rupee AND Treasure Medals, but it will prevent you from using your Adventure Pouch. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Link receive the Bow?", "correct": "The Sandship", "options": ["The Ancient Cistern", "Fire Sanctuary", "Silent Realm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sandship.\n\n\tAfter defeating Scervo on the bow of the Sandship (in the present time), Link will be able to claim the Bow from a chest.  The Bow works similarly to the Slingshot in that Link must draw the projectile and fire when ready; the Bow, however, has a straighter shot, a further shot, and does more damage.  Link needs to use it to hit the Timeshift Stone found on the mast of the Sandship to complete the dungeon.  The Bow can be upgraded twice, once for damage and the twice for range.  Oddly, you need to use Tumbleweeds to do this. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these can the Whip not do?", "correct": "Retract", "options": ["Pull switches", "Allow Link to swing", "Steal items from enemies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRetract.\n\n\tThe Whip is the item found in one of the basement levels of the Ancient Cistern, the fourth dungeon of the game.  A unique item in every right, it's necessary to use the Whip to access unreachable switches and platforms (by whipping at specific targets).  When fighting the boss of the dungeon, Koloktos, Link must use the hip to pull body parts off the foe. The Whip is also able to pull specific items off of enemies.  Bokoblins, for example, can have their Monster Horns stolen if Link uses the Whip to snag it out of their hands.  Monster Horns are yet another item component used in upgrades.  The Whip can not be upgraded. \n"}]}
