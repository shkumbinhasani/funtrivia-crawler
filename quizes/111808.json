Name this author of numerous publications pressing this cause, including 'A Discourse of Western Planting'.  \n", "correct": "Richard Hakluyt", "options": ["John Hawkins", "Dr. John Dee", "John Cabot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Hakluyt.\n\n\tThough these other three gentleman were all involved in either exploring or promoting the colonization of North America, none had more impact than Hakluyt.  His various publications promoting the 'planting' of English colonies across the ocean were enough to convince several eager adventurers such as Walter Raleigh to set asail for the new world.  Hakluyt was also a noted geographer, and introduced globes into the English classroom. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: Sir Walter Raleigh's Roanoke voyages were the first attempt by England to colonize mainland North America.  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tPrior to the Roanoke voyages of 1584, Raleigh's half-brother Humphrey Gilbert set out to establish a colony in North America.  Gilbert's fleet of ships made landfall at St. John's, Newfoundland, but his adventure proved eventually to be unsuccessful.  Gilbert lost his life while aboard the Squirrel, a rather small vessel, which foundered a month after the Newfoundland landing.  He was last seen reading a book on deck...now that's the way to go! \n"}, {"text": "Raleigh's first voyage to America was significant in that Roanoke Island was located.  It was also significant for other reasons, including being the first to return Native Americans to England for an 'official' visit.  What were the names of the two American Indians that paid a visit to England on Raleigh's first return trip?  \n", "correct": "Manteo and Wanchese", "options": ["Metacom and Sassamon", "Samoset and Squanto", "Powhatan and Opechancanought"], "explanation": "\n\n\nManteo and Wanchese.\n\n\tManteo and Wanchese were brought to London in order to help press upon potential investors in the Roanoke colony that the local populace was agreeable and willing to assist in the planting of a nascent English colony.  The reality is that tensions were high between the English colonists and the natives right from the start. \n"}, {"text": "In May of 1585 a fleet of ships set sail for the east coast of America, with plans to finally plant colonists at Roanoke.  Who was the captain of this fleet?  \n", "correct": "Richard Grenville", "options": ["Ralph Lane", "John White", "Thomas Hariot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Grenville.\n\n\tRaleigh, who had become the court favorite of Queen Elizabeth, remained behind but put his cousin, Grenville, in charge of this colonizing effort.  With several ships, Grenville made his way westward towards Roanoke in a rather circuitous fashion.  Grenville's fleet finally arrived in July and a fort was built on the island, with over a dozen men left behind to occupy it.  Ralph Lane was the commander of these troops, while Hariot served as the science expert and White as the 'official painter'.  It seems that plunder was more of a concern than colony planting for this mission in the end, however. On his return trip Grenville captured a large Spanish vessel loaded with treasure for the Spanish court.  A healthy return for the investment in this expedition was thus guaranteed... \n"}, {"text": "John White was named first governor of the Roanoke colony.  \n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tJohn White, the artist who had drawn sketches of the local flora and fauna, and had created a detailed map of the area, was appointed first governor of the colony in 1587 when 150 people (including women and children) were left there during an expedition led by Captain Simon Fernandez.  White left the colony shortly thereafter with Fernandez, however, with his family remaining behind. His object was to gather up a relief expedition.  Unfortunately, the war with against the Spanish Armada was at its apex and White could not return for another 3 years.  By the time he did return, the colony had disappeared, with trace of any of the inhabitants remaining other than the occasional chest and some cryptic messages carved in trees. \n"}, {"text": "Shortly after landing at Roanoke a child was born (meaning a pregnant woman had made the treacherous voyage!) What was the name of this first English child born on the North American continent?  \n", "correct": "Virginia", "options": ["Lucy", "Elizabeth", "Mary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVirginia.\n\n\tVirginia Dare was born to Elanora, daughter of John White (mentioned previously), and Ananias Dare on August 18, 1587.  Sadly, little Virginia was among those missing on White's return mission.  It's likely that she was taken by natives and integrated into their tribe, so her blood may very well flow through the veins of some modern Americans. \n"}, {"text": "Aside from the famous 'CROATOAN' discovered carved on a nearby tree, what was the only other message left by the colonists of the abandoned Roanoke colony?  \n", "correct": "The letters 'CRO' carved on another tree", "options": ["There was no other message", "A Maltese cross  carved on another tree", "Several mysterious carved characters whose meanings have never been deciphered"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe letters 'CRO' carved on another tree.\n\n\tThe three letters 'CRO' were also found carved on a nearby tree, apparently an additional, unfinished 'CROATOAN'.  The word Croatoan referred to a nearby island, but no evidence of the colonists was found there.  The colonists were requested to carve a Maltese cross as a sign of trouble, but no cross carving was found.  No trace of the colonists has ever been discovered, though theories abound. \n"}, {"text": "The famous British philosopher Francis Bacon counted all but which of these as reasons behind the tragic loss of the Roanoke colony in his essay 'On Plantations'?  \n", "correct": "Not enough settlers in the initial 'planting'", "options": ["The selfish desire of the investors for quick profits", "Improper behavior and actions toward the native people", "Lack of relief missions to fortify and strengthen the colony"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNot enough settlers in the initial 'planting'.\n\n\tBacon wrote his essay in 1625, and of course had the benefit of hindsight in his favor, but he was quite correct in his assessment.  In the first place, the colony was recklessly planted by the leaders of the expedition, whose minds were turned more toward capturing and looting Spanish ships than properly establishing a colony. In addition, it is likely that, if more formal and regular contacts were made with the local Indian tribes, the initial colony would not have been wrecked.  Finally, the obvious lack of relief for the colony, in great part caused by the war with the Spanish fleet, helped sound its death knell. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, further attempts at English colonization of North America took place, despite the disaster at Roanoke.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe next attempt at colonization did not occur until the 17th century, with the planting of the Jamestown colony in Virginia, the first permanent English settlement.  Raleigh fell from favor with Elizabeth after the extraordinary failure of Roanoke and as a result of his further, unsavory, activities. \n"}, {"text": "Sir Walter Raleigh is usually considered to be the 'mastermind' behind the planting of the Roanoke Colony.  What was the ultimate, eventual fate of this erstwhile colonialist?", "correct": "Executed under King James I", "options": ["Imprisoned but eventually pardoned on the charge of treason", "Killed in a pirate raid on the Azores", "Died of old age, still dreaming of colonizing America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExecuted under King James I.\n\n\tRaleigh fell from favor under Elizabeth and lost influence among those interested in colonizing the New World.  He became interested in literature and helped fund Spenser's 'The Faerie Queene' (an attempt to 'kiss up' to her royal highness?).  In the late 1590s he became involved in piracy, raiding Spanish and Portuguese ships and settlements.  He was imprisoned for treason by King James I in 1603 and spend 13 years there, all the while writing his 'History of the World'.  He was eventually released in 1616 but was executed two years later for treason. \n"}]}
