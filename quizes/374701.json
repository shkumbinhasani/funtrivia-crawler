Their three 1963 albums all made it into the Top Ten in the US with \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" getting to number two. \"Summer Days (And Summer Nights!)\" matched that performance in 1965. Remarkably, though, The Beach Boys never topped the US or UK charts with any studio album. They are still trying, though: their 29th studio album, \"That's Why God Made the Radio\" released in 2012, reached number three in the US and number 15 in the UK.\rTheir first live album, \"Beach Boys Concert\" in 1964, did top the US chart. They also topped the US chart once and the UK chart twice with their 50 (yes fifty) compilation albums.\rThey also topped the US Billboard 100 chart four times and the UK singles chart once (with \"Good Vibrations\" in 1966). \n"}, {"text": "Founded in 1962, they released their debut album, \"Come and Get These Memories\", in 1963, the title track also providing their first Top 30 single.

Their biggest hit, and their only UK Top Five single, was \"Dancing in the Street\" in 1864. \rThey were primarily a singles group, with their studio albums making little impression on the charts.

Strangely, the song for which they are best remembered today, \"Lola\", made it only to number two. It came off that strangely-named 1970 album that has a clue in the title. \n"}, {"text": "Although they began in 1964, it was almost a decade before they released an album, and that debut contained one of the two songs for which they are now best remembered. \"Second Helping\", released in 1974, contained the other. \"Street Survivors\", in 1977, gave them their first Top Five album.

Their first album, \"(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)\", was released in 1973 and contained the iconic \"Free Bird\" (their only UK chart single). Their most successful single, \"Sweet Home Alabama\", which reached number eight in the Billboard 100, came from \"Second Helping\".

The first period produced the excellent albums \"Selling England by the Pound\" in 1973, which reached number three in the UK album chart, \"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\" in 1974 and \"A Trick of the Tail\" in 1976. The second incarnation, with Phil Collins moving from back-of-stage to front, began with \"...And Then There Were Three...\" in 1978, another number three.

The first vocalist change came in 1980, with Ronnie James Dio taking over in time for \"Heaven and Hell\". Ian Gillan's only album at the mike was \"Born Again\" in 1983, followed by \"Seventh Star\" with former Deep Purple vocalist Glenn Hughes. \"Forbidden\", in 1995, was to be the band's last studio album for almost two decades, until Ozzy returned for \"13\" in 2013. \n"}, {"text": "Formed in 1969, they released \"Indelibly Stamped\" in 1971, which also produced their debut single, \"Forever\". \"Even in the Quietest Moments...\", released in 1977, was a number one album in Canada and the Netherlands. \"Free as a Bird\" was their final album before their first break-up, in 1988.

This album contained two memorable singles, \"Dreamer\" and their first charting single, \"Bloody Well Right\" in addition to the title track and \"Rudy\". Then came \"Crisis? What Crisis?\", released in 1975. The band's magnum opus, \"Breakfast in America\" released in 1979, topped the album charts in eight countries including the U.S. but, remarkably, only reached number three in the UK (their highest chart position in their home country).
