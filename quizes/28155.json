Most ocean currents are broken up by continents, which helps divert waters warmed in the tropics to more temperate climes.  But the Southern Ocean's uninterrupted current at its latitude helps quell storm systems coming from the tropics and keeps Antarctica technically a desert (receiving less than 10 inches of precipitation a year). \n"}, {"text": "What continental landmass borders all but one of the world's oceans?", "correct": "Eurasia", "options": ["North America", "Africa", "Australia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEurasia.\n\n\tThe Southern Ocean - surrounding Antarctica - does not border the Eurasian landmass. \n"}]}
