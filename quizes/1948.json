Baker's chocolate is the most toxic; milk chocolate the least. An 8-ounce bar of baker's chocolate can kill a small dog. Keep chocolate out of reach! \n"}, {"text": "You are contemplating purchasing a golden retriever puppy. In the USA, which of the following certifications should the parents have had before breeding?", "correct": "Both OFA and CERF", "options": ["No health testing is needed, especially for just a pet dog.", "OFA for hips", "CERF for eyes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoth OFA and CERF.\n\n\tOFA -Orthopedic Foundation for Animals- assures that a dog does not have the crippling disorder hip dysplasia. CERF -Canine Eye Registry Foundation- checks for genetic eye disorders. Both certifications are important - especially for a healthy pet! Responsible breeders always health-test their breeding stock. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following places should be your last choice, as a place to ethically purchase a puppy?", "correct": "A pet store", "options": ["An animal shelter", "A reputable breeder", "A breed rescue group"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pet store.\n\n\tMost pet store pups come from horrible places called puppymills, where the parent dogs are literally bred to death. Such puppies are unhealthy and rarely look or act like the breed they are supposed to be. NO responsible breeder sells puppies to a pet store. Responsible breeders want to know what happens to their puppies, not send them off to an unknown fate to be sold to anyone with the cash to buy them. \n"}, {"text": "Why shouldn't you leave your dog in a car at the shopping center?", "correct": "All of these reasons", "options": ["It could get heatstroke", "It could be stolen", "It could panic and damage the car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these reasons.\n\n\tAll of these are good reasons.

In addition, dogs can be stolen from cars or ruin them! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these leads to the highest death toll in dogs in the United States?", "correct": "Behavior problems", "options": ["Rabies", "Distemper", "Car accidents"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBehavior problems.\n\n\tOver 20 million dogs are killed in shelters and pounds every year in the USA, and untold numbers of dogs are abandoned. The most common reason that people dispose of a dog is behavior problems- most of which are easily cured with knowledgeable training. \n"}, {"text": "You have a beautiful female Collie with no pedigree. She has had no health testing, has never competed in any performance events, and her conformation has never been evaluated. Is it a good idea to breed from her?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn a society where millions of dogs are killed yearly, untested dogs of unknown lineage should never be bred. All breeding should be to benefit the breed involved. No scientific study has ever shown that such poor breeding practices- or deliberate breeding of mixed breeds- produces healthier dogs. The healthiest dogs come from health-tested parents of known ancestry. \n"}, {"text": "Spaying and neutering have important health and behavioral benefits for ______ .", "correct": "male and female dogs", "options": ["female dogs only", "male dogs only", "no dogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmale and female dogs.\n\n\tSpaying protects a female from mammary and ovarian cancer.
