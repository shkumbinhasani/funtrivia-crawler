{"id": "346688", "name": "Heard in Hawai'i Quiz | English | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "English", "Borrowed Words and Phrases"], "questions": [{"text": "Everywhere you go in Hawai'i, from native speakers of Hawaiian to those who speak only English, you hear it: \"Aloha!\" Which of these is NOT a meaning of the word?", "correct": "Victory", "options": ["Love", "Hello", "Goodbye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictory.\n\n\t\"Aloha\" is a tremendously versatile word, covering a wide range of concepts tied together by affection and harmony. Its use as a greeting (or a farewell) parallels other languages from across the world; one of aloha's many meanings is peace, recalling the Arabic greeting \"salaam\" or the Hebrew \"shalom.\" Hawai'i's official nickname is \"Aloha State,\" and the \"Aloha spirit\" is even codified into state law (although it's a guideline for the way officials should conduct state business, not a criminal statute). The relevant law, 5-7.5, even includes a mnemonic, in which kindness, unity, agreeableness, humility, and patience - expressed in the Hawaiian language - spell out the word ALOHA. \n"}, {"text": "As you move around the Honolulu International Airport, you may find yourself on a Wiki Wiki bus. That word may be familiar to you from Wikipedia and other wiki sites on the Internet - but all of these outfits borrowed the word from Hawaiian for more or less the same reason. What does \"wiki\" mean?", "correct": "Quick", "options": ["Long-distance", "Incorrect", "Air-conditioned"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuick.\n\n\tThere's a convention in the Hawaiian language to repeat a word for emphasis: a Wiki bus may be quick, but a Wiki Wiki bus is *very* quick. Similarly, a wiki site can be updated quickly, since content is added and edited collaboratively by the site's users. \r As it happens, this airport terminal bus is more closely related to Internet terminology than you might think! Ward Cunningham, who pioneered user-editable websites with the WikiWikiWeb in 1995, was inspired by his experience on the Wiki Wiki bus in Honolulu. He wanted to use an unusual and euphonic word for his new website idea, and the result caught on better than he could have dreamed. \n"}, {"text": "Stepping onto the curb by your hotel, you give the Japanese-American taxi driver some money. \"Mahalo,\" he says, borrowing a useful word from Hawaiian. Which of these would be the best response?", "correct": "You're welcome.", "options": ["I'm sure that's enough.", "How dare you!", "Nice to meet you."], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n\t\"Mahalo\" -- pronounced ma-HALL-oh -- is simply \"thank you,\" and you'll hear it everywhere in the islands. The airport's English-language public-address system will tell you \"mahalo for visiting\"; at the beach, an otherwise English sign might say \"mahalo\" for properly disposing of your trash. It's nice that this pleasantry is conveyed by such a gracious word. \n"}, {"text": "Stretched out on the beach and reading a political thriller, you see one character advise another to consult the \"big kahuna\" for a final decision on an urgent matter. It may surprise you to know that \"kahuna\" originally comes from Hawaiian! Which of these is closest to its original meaning?", "correct": "Shaman", "options": ["Grandfather", "King", "Evil mastermind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShaman.\n\n\tKahuna is the word for a priest or magician in the Hawaiian religion; it can also refer to a person with mastery over a given area, such as navigation or herbal medicine. Both meanings may have contributed to the English phrase \"big kahuna.\" \r In surfer culture, the \"big kahuna\" is the most skilled surfer on the beach, one who has demonstrated true mastery of the sport. \n"}, {"text": "Walking down the street in the business district, you linger by a display of clothing in a shop window. The display includes a rather stunning mu\u02bbumu\u02bbu. Which of the following best describes this article of clothing, whose name is yet again borrowed from Hawaiian?", "correct": "A loose dress", "options": ["A feathered cape", "A grass skirt", "A shirt with buttons down the side"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA loose dress.\n\n\tA mu\u02bbumu\u02bbu - that's four syllables, not two - is supported from the shoulder and hangs loosely on the body below. Worn for formal occasions as well as by expecting mothers and workers in the Hawaiian hospitality industry, the mu\u02bbumu\u02bbu is famously comfortable, so this store is likely to do a good business. Tourist mu\u02bbumu\u02bbu (and mu'umu'u available in stores outside the islands) are usually both more colorful and more floral than the ones worn by locals. Keep an eye out for the differences and decide which variety you like! \n"}, {"text": "You're famished after a long day, and that hamburger shack smells amazing. \"I wonder if it's any good,\" you say to yourself. A passerby, mixing a Hawaiian word in with his English, tells you, \"I've been there. It's ono.\" What does that mean?", "correct": "The food is delicious.", "options": ["The restaurant is closed.", "The food is expensive.", "The food is terrible."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe food is delicious.\n\n\t\"Ono\" may sound alarming, but oh no -- it's a great thing to hear about your food! You'll see the word pop up in restaurant names, menu headings, and casual conversation. I can tell you now, though: when it comes to being ono, nothing tops a real shaved ice. \n"}, {"text": "A lei is a symbol of Hawai'i, and a mark of affection. If you are honored with a lei, what should you do with it?", "correct": "Wear it around your neck", "options": ["Wear it around your waist", "Eat it\t", "Listen to it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWear it around your neck.\n\n\tA lei is a garland worn around the neck, and has been a part of Hawaiian culture from the islands' first settlement by humans. The archetypal lei is made of botanical material - fresh flowers, leaves, and perhaps nuts - but shells and feathers are also traditional favorites. (Modern tourist lei often rely on the famous plastic flower.) At some special occasions - like weddings or graduations - honorees' shoulders are piled high with the garlands, but luckily these don't weigh enough to be a burden.\r Keep in mind that, as a symbol of fondness and honor, a lei should be treated with respect, even at the end of its life. \n"}, {"text": "Not all language is spoken. The shaka sign, also called \"hang loose,\" is a common sight around Hawai'i. How do you make a shaka sign?", "correct": "Extend your thumb and little finger, curl the middle fingers in, and shake.", "options": ["Extend your four fingers in a V shape, split in the middle.", "Make a circle with your four fingers meeting your thumb.", "Spread out all five fingers on each hand, and shake."], "explanation": "\n\n\nExtend your thumb and little finger, curl the middle fingers in, and shake.\n\n\tThe origins of the shaka sign are not clear, but the meaning is crystal: it's an emblem of the aloha spirit and a friendly, unhurried island style. If you need to thank another driver for making way, try a shaka instead of a friendly wave -- it'll be appreciated! Elsewhere in the United States, you'll see this hand sign in surfer culture -- a mark of how much surfing owes to the Hawaiian islands -- and among hang-glider enthusiasts. \n"}, {"text": "Making arrangements to meet someone at their home, you may be told, \"We'll be on the lanai.\" Where should you look for them?", "correct": "On the porch", "options": ["In the kitchen", "On the beach", "In the garden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn the porch.\n\n\tA lanai, in English or in Hawaiian, is a roofed porch with open sides (except for the one backing onto the building, of course). It may be close to the ground, like a patio, or it may be raised like a balcony. Either way, it's a marvelous architectural feature for an island chain with such fantastic weather. It's a true pleasure to sit on the lanai and catch the breeze, be it at home, at a hotel room, or at a restaurant. \n"}, {"text": "There's excitement in the air: it's going to be a fun night! Which of the following borrowed words should you expect to find on an invitation to a party or feast in Hawai'i?", "correct": "Luau", "options": ["Kahuna", "Pahoehoe", "Honu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuau.\n\n\tTraditionally, a luau was a special feast, at which guests enjoyed special foods and entertainment while sitting on the ground. Over time, there have been some changes - forks and knives are now standard, and tables and chairs often make an appearance - but the basic ingredients of food and fun remain the same, whether it's a formal luau with professional entertainment or a party in celebration of a birthday or a graduation. Traditional luau foods include pork, fruit, taro (often in the form of poi), and fish. \n"}]}
