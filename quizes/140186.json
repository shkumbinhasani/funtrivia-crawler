{"id": "140186", "name": "'Pirates of the Caribbean' Quotes Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Pirates of the Caribbean", "POTC: The Curse of the Black Pearl"], "questions": [{"text": "Near the beginning of the film we see Miss Elizabeth Swann in conversation with her father, the governor.  They discuss a new dress for which Elizabeth is being fitted.  Governor Swann states that 'it's the latest fashion in London.'  Elizabeth replies, 'Well the women in London must have learned not to breathe!' Putting on what item of clothing provokes this response?", "correct": "Corset", "options": ["Chastity belt", "Scarf", "Petticoat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorset.\n\n\tThe corset is so tight, Elizabeth becomes unable to breath, and she later plunges into water far below a wall on which she is standing (only to be saved by Jack Sparrow).  Later, to one of the pirates, Elizabeth exclaims, 'You like pain?  Try wearing a corset!' \n"}, {"text": "In attempting to escape British troops who mean to hang him, Jack Sparrow finds himself suddenly engaged in a sword fight with Will Turner.  Turner turns out to be quite the excellent swordsman, and Jack is easy to compliment him.  What is Jack's response when hearing that Will 'practices three hours a day'?", "correct": "'You need to find yourself a girl, mate!'", "options": ["'What, for the past week?'", "'I'd hate to find out how you spend the other 21 hours!'", "'All for me?  And I didn't get you anything!'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'You need to find yourself a girl, mate!'.\n\n\tJack continues, '...or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you found one, and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet?'  Will Turner retorts, 'I practice three hours a day, so when I meet a pirate, I can kill it!' \n"}, {"text": "Who states about Jack, who is in the process of attempting to steal a British battlecruiser, 'That has to be the worst pirate I have ever seen'?", "correct": "Norrington", "options": ["Elizabeth Swann", "Governor Swann", "Will Turner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorrington.\n\n\tNorrington soon learns to eat his words as Jack manages to escape with his fastest ship, the HMS Interceptor.  Once Jack is safely off to sea, Norrington's aide-de-camp turns to his commander and says, 'That has to be the best pirate, I have ever seen.' \n"}, {"text": "The Barbossa character, played by Geoffrey Rush, has his fair share of clever lines.  Fill in the blank from this Barbossa excerpt: 'First, your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement so I must do nothing. And secondly, you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply and you're not. And thirdly, the code is more what you'd call ___________ than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner.'", "correct": "guidelines & guide lines & guideline", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nguidelines & guide lines & guideline.\n\n\tThe 'guidelines' gag is used three times within the movie, and it doesn't get old.  The key for the Rush line above is in the delivery, however.  Geoffrey Rush is the master of the sinister, as his work in films such as 'Quills' and 'Mystery Men' attest! \n"}, {"text": "To properly go after Barbossa, who holds Elizabeth Swann captive, Jack and Will require a crew.  This leads them to Tortuga, where Jack proceeds to assemble the greatest bunch of scallywags one ever did see.  One of these seadogs is Anamaria, who claims that Jack 'stole her boat'.  How does Jack respond to this accusation?", "correct": "'Borrowed! Borrowed...without permission...'", "options": ["'Was that your ship?  I didn't see your name on it!'", "'Stole' is such an ugly word.  I prefer, 'creatively pilfered'.'", "'I'm sorry.  If it's any consolation it sunk well.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Borrowed! Borrowed...without permission...'\n\n\tJack Sparrow, played magnificently by Johnny Depp, is always getting himself entangled in trouble.  He is slapped a total of four times, the first one undeservedly and the second perhaps deservedly.  The third one, delivered care of Anamaria, prompts Will Turner to state, 'I bet you didn't deserve that either', to which Jack responds, 'No, that one I deserved.'  She then slugs him again for good measure! \n"}, {"text": "Jack's new first mate, Mr. Gibbs (who is an old acquaintance), converses with Will Turner along the way about Jack's miraculous escape from a deserted island.  According to Mr. Gibbs, Jack did which of the following in order to get off the island?", "correct": "He roped a couple of sea turtles and rode them away", "options": ["He created a hang-glider out of the sails of his ship", "He waited until low tide and swam to Cuba", "He crafted a life-raft out of old coconut shells"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe roped a couple of sea turtles and rode them away.\n\n\tAfter hearing this tall tale, Will incredulously responds, 'Roped a couple of sea turtles? What did he use for rope?'  Jack, listening from behind, answers, 'Human hair...from my back.'  Big laughs! \n"}, {"text": "Which character delivers the following classic line? 'You best start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner. You're in one.'", "correct": "Barbossa", "options": ["Ragetti", "Pintel", "Twigg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarbossa.\n\n\tGeoffrey Rush really understands how to deliver a good line, and his timing is impeccable.  Much attention goes to Johnny Depp for his outstanding performance as Jack Sparrow, but let us not forget about the villainous Rush!  He makes this statement after Elizabeth discovers the morbid secret behind the crew of the Black Pearl...yikes! \n"}, {"text": "Which character delivers this excellent line, when told that no one has survived a confrontation with the Black Pearl: 'No survivors, eh? Then where do the stories come from, I wonder?'", "correct": "Jack Sparrow", "options": ["Will Turner", "Mr. Gibbs", "Norrington"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Sparrow.\n\n\tThis is one of Jack Sparrow's more incisive lines, and a question that should perhaps be asked more often when people make outrageous claims!  It turns out that Jack Sparrow was indeed a survivor of a confrontation with the Black Pearl...he later becomes captain of the dreaded ship once again! \n"}, {"text": "In the big confrontation between Jack's crew and the Black Pearl, there is a hilarious exchange between Jack and Barbossa.  Barbossa, managing to get back the gold doubloon that he has been desperately pursuing, says 'Thank you, Jack.'  Jack Sparrow, believing himself to be the target of this unexpected pleasantry, responds, 'You're welcome.'  Barbossa then delivers the rejoinder, 'Oh, not you.  We named the ______ Jack!'  Which name for an animal completes this funny moment?", "correct": "Monkey", "options": ["Parrot", "Cat", "Dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonkey.\n\n\tPoor Jack, he has been likened to a monkey (a rather cute one, at that) by Barbossa and his former men.  The monkey, like the rest of the cursed crew of the Black Pearl, has a personal interest in returning the gold piece, so no wonder he is so obedient! \n"}, {"text": "As Jack Sparrow parts company with the other major characters at the end of the film, he turns to Elizabeth Swann and says, 'Elizabeth, it would never have worked between us darling, I'm sorry.'  Then, he turns to Will Turner and most unsentimentally says which of the following?", "correct": "'Nice hat!'", "options": ["'Lucky devil!'", "'Good chap!'", "'You need a shave!'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Nice hat!'.\n\n\tI thought this exit was entirely fitting for old Jack.  Rather than a sappy ending with tears and kisses all around, Jack chooses some rather madcap lines, culminating in the unceremonious 'nice hat'.  He then proceeds to fall over the castle wall into the water, where he is picked up by the Black Pearl.  Thanks for playing, I hope you enjoyed the quiz (and the film)! \n"}]}
