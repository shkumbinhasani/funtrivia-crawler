Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Name the Movie"], "questions": [{"text": "Which epic 1960 Stanley Kubrick film, the highest-grossing (in the U.S.) movie of the year, starred Kirk Douglas in the title role?", "correct": "Spartacus", "options": ["Exodus", "The Alamo", "Ocean's 11"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpartacus.\n\n\tBased on the novel by Howard Fast and set in the Roman Empire, \"Spartacus\" tells the story of the leader of a slave revolt. \r Kirk Douglas played the title character in an all-star cast that included Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton and Tony Curtis. Peter Ustinov earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Lentulus Batiatus, the owner of a gladiatorial school near Mount Vesuvius. \r Somewhat surprisingly, the film was not even nominated in either the Best Picture or Best Director category at that year's Oscars, both of which were won by Billy wilder's \"The Apartment\". \n"}, {"text": "\"The Sound of Music\" was both the top-grossing movie and the Best Picture Oscar winner in 1965. Our film from that year was not even nominated for Best Picture, but it was subsequently voted by the American Film Institute as one of the \"10 Best Westerns of All Time\". Nat King Cole played The Sunrise Kid in which film?", "correct": "Cat Ballou", "options": [" The Wild Bunch ", " For a Few Dollars More ", "McCabe & Mrs. Miller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCat Ballou.\n\n\tThe 20 top-grossing films of 1965 included not only \"The Sound of Music\", but also \"Doctor Zhivago\", \"Thunderball\", \"Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines\", \"What's New Pussycat?\",  \"Von Ryan's Express\", \"For a Few Dollars More\" and \"Help!\". \r Our film, \"Cat Ballou\" starring Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda, ranked number seven on that list. The film tells the story of a woman who hires a legendary gunfighter to protect her father and his farm from a hired killer. Marvin, who played the dual roles of both gunfighters, of Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn, not only won the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance, but also the BAFTA and Golden Globe in that same category. \n"}, {"text": "One of the ten highest-grossing films of 1970 and starring Martin Balsam with Jason Robards and James Whitmore also in the cast, which 1970 film told the story of the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor?", "correct": "Tora! Tora! Tora!", "options": ["Little Big Man", "Patton", "Airport"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTora! Tora! Tora!.\n\n\t'Tora' literally means \"tiger\" but, in this case, it was an acronym of 'totsugeki raigeki' (\"lightning attack\"), and was used by the Japanese attackers to confirm that the American defenders were unaware of the impending attack. \r Unusually, \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" was co-directed by Richard Fleischer, Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku, creating a film that portrayed the events of one of the century's most historic days from both sides. Three years of preparation and eight months of filming produced an epic that, although the Academy did not particularly like it - it won only one Oscar (for Special Effects) from its five nominations, and was not even nominated in any of the major categories - has gone down as one of the classic WWII films. \n"}, {"text": "\"Jaws\" was by far the highest-grossing movie of 1975, whilst that year's Oscars were dominated by the third-placed film on that list, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". Which film starring a young Susan Sarandon as the heroine Janet Weiss split those two, grossing more than $110m in the U.S.?  ", "correct": "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", "options": ["The Return of the Pink Panther", "Dog Day Afternoon", "Shampoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show.\n\n\tA tongue-in-cheek nod to every 'B' movie and science-fiction ever made, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" was based on the 1973 stage musical written by Richard O'Brien, who played the handyman Riff Raff in the movie. Fittingly, it was filmed at Oakley Court, a Gothic Victorian estate in Berkshire that had previously been the home of Hammer Film Productions, whose props and stages were used in making the film. \r Tim Curry and Barry Bostwick co-starred with Susan Sarandon in a cast that also included a pre-\"Bat Out of Hell\" Meat Loaf. \n"}, {"text": "Strangely, not one of the six highest-grossing films of 1980 was even nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" led that list, which includes our selection, a Goldie Hawn film that was later voted by the American Film Institute as one of the \"100 Funniest Movies of All Time\". Which film is this?", "correct": "Private Benjamin", "options": ["Any Which Way You Can", "Airplane! ", "The Sugarland Express"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrivate Benjamin.\n\n\tGoldie Hawn had won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar and Golden Globe for one of her very first movies, \"Cactus Flower\" (1969), and was nominated for Golden Globes in the Best Actress category four times during the 1970s. It was \"Private Benjamin\" (1980), though, that she earned her first Best Actress Oscar nomination.\r The film begins with Judy Benjamin getting married, only for her husband to die during consummation on their wedding night. Her reaction is to join the Army and the film follows her hilarious efforts to make it through boot camp. Eileen Brennan, Armand Assante, Sam Wanamaker, Harry Dean Stanton and Craig T. Nelson all feature in an excellent cast, but this movie is all about Goldie Hawn at her very best.\r A must-see if you missed it the first time around. \n"}, {"text": "One of the first films directed by former child acting star Ron Howard, this 1985 movie was one of the top ten highest-grossing movies of the year. The cast of which fantasy-comedy film included Don Ameche, Wilford Brimley, Hume Cronyn, Brian Dennehy, Steve Guttenberg, Maureen Stapleton and Jessica Tandy?", "correct": "Cocoon", "options": ["The Color Purple", "Back to the Future", "Splash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCocoon.\n\n\tFilmed in and around one of America's biggest retirement communities in Saint Petersburg, Florida, \"Cocoon\" tells the story of a group of people in their latter years who are rejuvenated by aliens from the planet Antarea. \r The 77-year old Don Ameche won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Like the year's highest-grossing movie, \"Back to the Future\", \"Cocoon\" was not nominated for Best Picture, which was won by \"Out of Africa\".\r If you like 'feel good movies' be sure to see \"Cocoon\" if you missed it the first time around. \n"}, {"text": "1990 was a great year for blockbuster movies, with four films grossing in excess of $400m in the U.S. Top of that list was a Jerry Zucker romantic fantasy starring Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg. Which film is this?", "correct": "Ghost", "options": ["Dances with Wolves", "Pretty Woman ", "Total Recall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGhost.\n\n\t\"Ghost\" was voted into the top 20 in the American Film Institute's poll of \"100 Years... 100 Passions\", the greatest love stories ever filmed. This is a real tear-jerker as Molly Jensen (Demi Moore), assisted by fake psychic Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), is reunited at the pottery wheel with her murdered lover (Patrick Swayze). \r Goldberg won that year's Best Supporting Actress Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe for her performance. The film also won in the Best Original Screenplay category at the Oscars. In the Best Picture category, \"Ghost\" lost out to another film equally well worth seeing, Kevin Costner's \"Dances with Wolves\". \n"}, {"text": "By contrast, 1995 was a fairly uninspiring year for movies, with sequels dominating the box-office list. Our selection from that year is based on a 1981 children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, whose \"The Polar Express\" was also later adapted for the screen. Kirsten Dunst, Bonnie Hunt and Bebe Neuwirth all appear in which 1990 fantasy comedy?", "correct": "Jumanji", "options": ["Seven ", "Casper", "Waterworld"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJumanji.\n\n\tWith special effects by Industrial Light & Magic and Robin Williams starring as his crazy self, \"Jumanji\" was always likely to be worth seeing. A 12-year old gets trapped inside a board game. When a couple of kids find the game 26 years later and start playing, they find the now adult Alan Parrish (Williams). Between them they have to find a way to finish the game so that they can all escape.\r Although the Academy didn't notice it, the public did and it was one of 1990's top ten highest-grossing movies. By contrast, that year's Best Picture Oscar winner, \"Braveheart\" did not resonate with the public at the box office. For my money, though, the best movie of the year was \"Apollo 13\", a true gem in amongst all of the sequels, like \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\", \"Batman Forever\" and the return of James Bond with a new star (Pierce Brosnan) in the role, in \"Goldeneye\". \n"}, {"text": "The star of our 2000 selection, a multiple-Oscar winning actor, also co-produced. If there was an Oscar category for Best Inanimate Character, not only of the year but, perhaps, ever, then Wilson would surely have won.

His most important find, as it turns out, is a volleyball. He names it Wilson and, as time passes, it becomes his friend and confidant. \r This was a wonderful performance by Hanks, who earned a Best Actor Oscar nomination, although the Academy preferred Russell Crowe in \"Gladiator\" (which also won Best Picture).\r At the box office, \"Cast Away\" was the third highest-grossing movie of the year, after \"Mission: Impossible II\" and \"Gladiator\". \n"}, {"text": "2005 was the year of the blockbuster, but our selection had star attraction in the form of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to carry it into the top ten list of the year's highest-grossing movies. Which film directed by Doug Liman, is this?", "correct": "Mr and Mrs Smith", "options": ["Madagascar", "Crash", "War of the Worlds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr and Mrs Smith.\n\n\t2005 was the year of the blockbuster, with \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", \"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\" and \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" leading the way at the box office. \"Mr and Mrs Smith\" made it into the year's top ten, though, as Pitt and Jolie play a bored married couple who discover that they are both assassins and that each has been hired by a different contractor to kill the other. \r Curiously, not one of the five films nominated for Best Picture in 2005 made it into the top ten list of that year's highest-grossing films. The Oscar went to \"Crash\", with \"Capote\" and \"Brokeback Mountain\" amongst the nominees. \n"}]}
