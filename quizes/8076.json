{"id": "8076", "name": "To Their Uncredit... Online Trivia | Name the People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Name the People", "Bit Parts"], "questions": [{"text": "Uncredited in the theatrical version of \"Hannibal\" (2001), what versatile actor played the role of the disfigured Mason Verger?", "correct": "Gary Oldman", "options": ["Jim Carrey", "Daniel Day-Lewis", "Johnny Depp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGary Oldman.\n\n\tAlthough Oldman wasn't credited in \"Hannibal\", the \"Silence of the Lambs\" sequel, he would be third-billed after the film ended its theatrical release (under Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling).  Although the eventual TV show of \"Hannibal\" (released 2013-2015) would show how Mason Verger would become disfigured, Oldman played a version of the sadistic character who was disfigured from the get-go.  Part of the reason behind keeping Oldman off the credits was to keep people guessing; Oldman originally insisted on high billing, but came back to the production and asked to be removed entirely. It took six hours per day to apply his prosthetics. \n"}, {"text": "What actress who appeared, masked and covered in disposable coveralls, played Simon Pegg's girlfriend, Janine, at the start of \"Hot Fuzz\" (2007)?", "correct": "Cate Blanchett", "options": ["Tilda Swinton", "Billie Piper", "Anne Hathaway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCate Blanchett.\n\n\tThough Janine only really appeared at the beginning of the movie (to break up with Simon Pegg's character, Nicholas Angel), it's that action that began Nick's life-changing job switch as he headed from London to the small, one-would-presume-to-be-idyllic town of Sandford.  Cate Blanchett played the role, filming in one day, and donated her cameo fee to charity; she wasn't billed in the credits.  Coincidentally, \"Lord of the Rings\" director Peter Jackson also had an uncredited appearance in \"Hot Fuzz\" playing a murderous Santa. \n"}, {"text": "Which Ghostbuster appeared for a brief moment in the live-action \"Casper\" film (released in 1995), fleeing from the ghosts?", "correct": "Dan Aykroyd", "options": ["Ernie Hudson", "Bill Murray", "Harold Ramis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDan Aykroyd.\n\n\tSeveral famous actors cameoed without credit in \"Casper\" (including Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, and Rodney Dangerfield) but none were as tongue-in-cheek as Dan Aykroyd reprising his role as Ray Stantz, heading into the haunted mansion to bust the ghosts but being forced out.  He would, in later interviews, claim that \"Casper\" was canon with the \"Ghostbusters\" universe.  He didn't play the role again until \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" twenty-one years later. \n"}, {"text": "What Oscar-winner played Van Garrett and was beheaded in the opening of \"Sleepy Hollow\" (1999)?", "correct": "Martin Landau", "options": ["Michael Gambon", "Christopher Walken", "Christopher Lee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartin Landau.\n\n\tLandau took the Best Supporting Actor Oscar when he performed as Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's 1994 film \"Ed Wood\".  He was asked back in this cameo, kicking off Burton's retelling of Washington Irving's \"Sleepy Hollow\".  Both movies starred Johnny Depp in the lead role.  Landau's scene in \"Sleepy Hollow\" was no more than a couple of minutes long and, of course, featured his decapitation at the hands of the Headless Horseman.  Landau would reunite one last time with Burton for \"Frankenweenie\" in 2012. \n"}, {"text": "What actor, playing John Doe, didn't appear in the opening credits of \"Se7en\" (though he was the first name listed at its conclusion)?", "correct": "Kevin Spacey", "options": ["R. Lee Ermey", "Brad Pitt", "Morgan Freeman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin Spacey.\n\n\tIn one of the more surprising hidden cast moments of the 1990s, the David Fincher thriller \"Se7en\" intentionally kept Spacey out of the opening credit sequence to leave his presence a mystery; Spacey didn't appear in the film until late in the story, turning himself in at the police station.  As a result, producers had him top-billed in the closing credits in addition to listing him with the rest of the cast during the end credit roll.  To continue preserving the twist, Spacey was also left out of all press junkets for the film.  Interestingly, Spacey was one of the last actors to be cast. \n"}, {"text": "In the 2004 film \"Collateral\", what actor, technically only listed as 'Airport Man', handed a briefcase off to Tom Cruise?", "correct": "Jason Statham", "options": ["Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson", "Vin Diesel", "Keanu Reeves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJason Statham.\n\n\tIn a brief moment near the start of the film, Statham's character handed off the briefcase that Cruise's hitman character, Vincent, would bring with him into Jamie Foxx's cab.  Calling him 'uncredited' for this might be a bit of a stretch since, technically, Statham is credited as 'Airport Man'.  This said, the filmmakers would later claim that Statham was actually reprising his role as Frank Martin from 2002's \"The Transporter\". \n"}, {"text": "One of the main characters of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" was uncredited.  Who voiced Jessica Rabbit?", "correct": "Kathleen Turner", "options": ["Isabella Rossellini", "Madonna", "Sharon Stone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKathleen Turner.\n\n\tThe 1988 film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" was a weird instance that blended live-action and animation, and as such, most of the live-action characters are billed, famous actors (like Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd).  Really, only Charles Fleischer, who voiced Roger, has high billing of all the animated figures. Jessica Rabbit, his sultry, noir-esque wife, was voiced by Kathleen Turner and intentionally left uncredited, a move that allowed Jessica Rabbit to appear as herself, so to speak.  The voice acting was done, by Turner, as a favour to director Robert Zemeckis; she was nine months pregnant at the time. \n"}, {"text": "Left out of all promotional materials, what acclaimed actor was left uncredited at the start of the film for his role as Mann in \"Interstellar\"?", "correct": "Matt Damon", "options": ["Michael Caine", "Ben Affleck", "Christian Bale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt Damon.\n\n\tDamon didn't appear until one of the later moments of the movie when Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway reached Mann's purported-to-be-inhabitable ice planet.  They landed on its surface to find Mann, alive there after having gone into cryo-sleep waiting for others to arrive.  Damon's scenes were filmed, quietly, in Iceland and he was left out of all promotional materials and press tours for the film.  He didn't appear in the opening credits but he did appear at the end.  He also appeared, uncredited, in roles in \"Thor: Ragnarok\" and \"Deadpool 2\" in later years. \n"}, {"text": "Who played the uncredited role of King Richard the Lionheart in 1991's \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\"?", "correct": "Sean Connery", "options": ["Kevin Costner", "Alan Rickman", "Christian Slater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Connery.\n\n\tOne of the top-grossing movies of 1991, this retelling of the Robin Hood tale ended with the appearance of King Richard attending Robin Hood and Lady Marian's wedding.  The cameo was an expensive one.  Though he only had a short day of filming, Connery's original price tag was $1,000,000 USD; he was ultimately paid a quarter of that, though it was donated to a hospital in Scotland. \n"}, {"text": "What actress, visiting Robin Williams on the set of \"Hook\" (1991), wore a beard for her cameo role as 'Gutless'?", "correct": "Glenn Close", "options": ["Meryl Streep", "Julia Roberts", "Maggie Smith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlenn Close.\n\n\tIt was one of those chance roles for Close who, visiting Robin Williams during a day of filming, was asked by director Steven Spielberg if she wanted to make a cameo.  The rest is history; Close donned a beard and prosthetics and played the role of Gutless, the hapless pirate placed into the Boo Box by Dustin Hoffman's Captain Hook.  The movie featured a number of uncredited cameos beyond just Close; you can see David Crosby, Jimmy Buffett, George Lucas, and Carrie Fisher in other moments. \n"}]}
