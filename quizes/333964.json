This region is mostly covered by deserts and forests; the Chihuahuan Desert is one of the largest ecosystems of this type in North and Central America.  This desert is east of the Sonoran Desert which includes Arizona, Baja, and the Mexican State of Sonora.  Chihuahua makes up nearly an eighth of Mexico's total area, and while it's not necessarily the most populous state, it's certainly quite spread out.  The city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez contains the most people followed by Chihuahua City itself.  Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez rests on the U.S. border next to the city of El Paso, Texas.\rAlthough unconfirmed, many believe the Chihuahua to have originated in either Europe or Mexico. \n"}, {"text": "This prefecture in Northern Japan is home to the beautiful Mount Chokai in the Ou Mountain range and rests on the Sea of Japan.

Because of the mountains stretching along the eastern border of the prefecture, much of Akita is rural and pulls its economic gain from agriculture and forestry.  Its capital, Akita, rests on the Sea of Japan and is a major oil city on the coast.\rThe Akita Inu is named after the region having come from the area originally.  The Akita is commonly regarded as one of Japan's oldest domestic dogs. \n"}, {"text": "This Canadian island (also a province) is one of the easternmost points on the continent of North America.

Most notable for its fishing industry, Newfoundland was discovered by Vikings nearly a millennium ago and settled by the British in the late sixteenth century.  Newfoundland is one of the world's largest islands (it's fifteenth in area) and it's home to over half a million residents, most of whom reside in the province's capital, St. John's.\rThe Newfoundland dog is bred for life near the water.

Happy Valley and Goose Bay, while some of the largest cities in Labrador, typically hold less than ten thousand citizens and make up a quarter of the total population of the area.  Labrador is home to a number of indigenous local tribes and, aside from mining, is known for fishing much like Newfoundland just off its coast.\rThe Labrador, while somewhat similar to the Newfoundland, is a much more popular domestic dog appearing in golden, black, and chocolate colours.  A retriever dog, the Labrador is very loyal and family-friendly. \n"}, {"text": "Found in the Mediterranean Sea, these islands, also a European nation, are south of Sicily and house the Megalithic Temples.

Created over one hundred million years ago, the Pyrenees are actually some of the older mountains in Europe and they contain a number of hot springs and national parks (for both Spain and France).

Despite this, Siberia is notable for its expanses of untapped natural beauty.  Travelers will recognize the tracks of the Trans-Siberian Railway cutting through the country from the more-populated St. Petersburg and Moscow all the way across to Lake Baikal and south into Mongolia.  Some of Siberia rests in the Arctic Circle and is often snow-covered while most of Southern Siberia is covered in forests, old mountains, and lakes.  Lake Baikal is actually the deepest freshwater lake in the world.\rThe Siberian Husky is native to this region of the world, and the breed is known for being a working and sledding dog.

This waterway is also one of the southernmost points of Argentina, which rests on its eastern end and heads along the coast of Chile to the west.

Which of these would it be?", "correct": "Dalmatia", "options": ["Neapolitan", "Anatolia", "Papillon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDalmatia.\n\n\tDalmatia stretches along the coast of the Adriatic Sea, and while most of the Dalmatian coastline heads through Croatia, parts of it also push to the Bay of Kotor in Montenegro to the south.  Dalmatia also takes in a lot of the islands of the Adriatic including Korcula, the birthplace of Marco Polo.  Since the Dalmatian region was originally occupied by the Romans in its early days, a number of landmarks and buildings still retain Italian and Roman influences.\rDalmatians are medium to large sized dogs with characteristic spots.  They're typically seen as firehouse dogs although they are usually seen as domestic pets. \n"}]}
