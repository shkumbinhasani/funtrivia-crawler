He is also credited with postulating many of the laws of physics and curiously enough he disproved the notion of Aristotle that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. \n"}, {"text": "What are the phyto-hormones which influence plant growth and root-elongation generally called?\n", "correct": "auxins", "options": ["pheromones", "cions", "phytons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nauxins.\n\n\tAuxins can be prepared from human urine, yeasts, mold and vegetable oils. \n"}, {"text": "What is the simplest design of a plant body?\n", "correct": "single cell", "options": ["cellulite", "cytoplasm", "mud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsingle cell.\n\n\tGreen algae (Chlorophyta) are an example of this...they are found in unicellular forms, with flagella serving for locomotion, and in multicellular forms, i.e. spirogyra. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following items is a product of the cambium of a plant?", "correct": "cork", "options": ["wort", "germ", "fruit"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncork.\n\n\tThe cambium of a plant is the ultimate source for phloem, xylem and cork, which grow by division. \n"}, {"text": "What substance produced from the plant is used to create its cell walls?", "correct": "cellulose", "options": ["ligature", "lignin", "sap"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncellulose.\n\n"}, {"text": "The Ascomycetes (sac fungi) produce a species of fungus which is economically useful. The blue-mold or Penicillium in this species is useful in the production of which product?", "correct": "cheese", "options": ["bread", "milk", "wine"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncheese.\n\n\tPenicillium roqueforti and penicillium camemberti are quite essential in the production of these cheeses.

But unlike animals they reproduce by spores and do possess cell walls. \n"}, {"text": "The Basidiomycetes contain a most useful group of fungi.
