{"id": "311010", "name": "Where in \"Diablo II\" Are We? Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games D-F", "Diablo Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Where are we if we're speaking to Hadriel?", "correct": "River of Flame", "options": ["Tal Rasha's Tomb", "Frigid Highlands", "Durance of Hate, Level 1"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiver of Flame.\n\n\tHadriel is found shortly after the constant Waypoint found in the middle of the River of Flame (the final Waypoint of its kind in Act IV).  While Hadriel has no bearing on the quests of the Act (like Flavie between Blood Moor and Cold Plains in Act I), they do guard the path and inform us that we are going in the right direction.  Tyrael, on the other hand, appears after we defeat Duriel in Tal Rasha's Chamber, he appears in Pandemonium Fortress in Act IV, and he shows up once more in Act V.  Durance of Hate, regardless of which level, does not contain any NPC characters. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we've just recovered The Book of Skill?", "correct": "Sewers, Level 3", "options": ["Den of Evil", "Travincal", "Arachnid's Lair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSewers, Level 3.\n\n\tWe can only get the Book of Skill once per difficulty level (Normal, Nightmare, or Hell) by defeating Radament, the final boss found in the Sewers, Level 3 in Act 2.  The Sewers as a whole are found beneath the city of Lut Gholein, the main safe zone of Act 2, and there are two ways we can get into it: one by opening a trapdoor in the north end near Greiz and one by taking a staircase in the south end. There is a waypoint we can access in Sewers, Level 2.  Coincidentally, Radament, the boss at the end of this stage, will also be guarding the Horadric Scroll, needed to begin the second quest of the Act, 'The Horadric Staff'.  The Sewers are the only place at which we can complete the first quest, Radament's Lair'. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we able to use a potion to free Anya?", "correct": "Frozen River", "options": ["Crystalline Passage", "Arcane Sanctuary", "Ancient's Way"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrozen River.\n\n\tIn the third quest of Act V, we need to locate Anya, one of the NPCs of Harrogath, as she's been taken into the Frozen River and frozen by enemies.  When we find her, we need to hightail it back to Harrogath to speak to Malah and get a potion that will unthaw her from her icy entrapment.  This will result in the completion of the quest 'Prison of Ice' and we will receive a Scroll of Resistance. After the completion of this quest, Anya will trigger the beginning of quest four, 'Betrayal of Harrogath', in which you need to go to Nihlathak's Temple to defeat the man who betrayed the city for his own personal reasons. \n"}, {"text": "Where could we be if we've just handed over the Jade Figurine?", "correct": "Kurast Docks", "options": ["Rogue Encampment", "Lut Gholein", "Pandemonium Fortress"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurast Docks.\n\n\tThe Jade Figurine is one part of the first quest found in Act III, 'The Golden Bird'.  The Jade Figurine itself can be dropped from the first unique boss defeated in the Act wherever that may be.  Once we find it, we need to return it to Meshif in the west end of Kurast Docks (he's the one who sailed us from Lut Gholein to Kurast in the first place).  He will trade the Jade Figurine for the Golden Bird which contains ingredients that must be given to Alkor to make the Potion of Life. This Potion will allow us to have twenty Health Points permanently added to our total and this can be done once per difficulty. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we've just fought Bishibosh?", "correct": "Cold Plains", "options": ["Spider Forest", "Stony Field", "Black Marsh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCold Plains.\n\n\tBishibosh is a unique Fallen Shaman boss we can find amongst the Fallen and other Shaman in the camps of Cold Plains.  This easier area can be found between Blood Moor (the first explorable area of the game) and Stony Field.  While Bishibosh has no impact on any of our quests in Act 1, defeating him is always a nice thing to do.  As he progresses through the difficulties, he will also gain a resistance to magic and an immunity to fire.\rStony Field has a similar boss, Rakinishu, who will deal out a fair amount of lightning damage to us if we aren't careful around the Cairn Stones.\rWe can find Black Marsh quite easily as long as we follow the course of Act 1; it comes directly after Dark Wood and is home to the fourth quest of the Act, 'The Forgotten Tower'.  Spider Forest is the first area we come across in Act 3 as soon as we step out of Kurast Docks. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're in Act V?", "correct": "Bloody Foothills", "options": ["Outer Steppes", "Blood Moor", "Spider Forest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBloody Foothills.\n\n\tAlthough all the possible choices are directly connected to the major towns of their respective Acts, only the Bloody Foothills can be found to the northwest of Harrogath, the major city of Act V.  The Bloody Foothills is home to our first quest in Act V, 'Stop the Siege', during which we need to defeat Shenk the Overseer in the northernmost point of the area near the entrance of the Frigid Highlands. Most of the earlier areas of Act V are occupied by stronger enemy forces with resilient skin and heavy-hitting weaponry.  When we finish with these types of areas, we'll move on to the ice caves and eventually the Worldstone Keep, home of Baal. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're speaking to Halbu?", "correct": "Pandemonium Fortress", "options": ["Blood Moor", "Lut Gholein", "Harrogath"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPandemonium Fortress.\n\n\tHalbu is one of the two traders found in Pandemonium Fortress and he's found in the southeastern-most position on the map of the town.  Jamella, his counterpart, is also a trader, but she also allows us to gamble.  There are only four NPCs in this city, slightly less than all other Acts, but then again, we can tell that this Act (the fourth) is a bit shorter than the rest. In Act IV, we can only complete three quests and we only have three waypoints, a clear testament to how long the area is supposed to take in terms of duration.  Both Halbu and Jamella do not dish out quests; only Deckard Cain and Tyrael have the ability to do this. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we've just picked up the Horadric Malus?", "correct": "The Barracks", "options": ["Durance of Hate, Level 3", "Outer Steppes", "Arcane Sanctuary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Barracks.\n\n\tThe Horadric Malus is the basis of the fifth quest found in Act 1 ('The Tools of the Trade').  When we navigate through the monastery in the end of Act 1, we'll eventually make our way to The Barracks, home to the Extra Strong unique boss known as The Smith.  Once we take the Malus, we can bring it back to Charsi in the Rogue Encampment and use it to imbue any non-socketed, non-set, non-enchanted armor with magical properties.  This can be done once per difficulty and it must be done to completely finish the quest.\rFrom The Barracks we can also visit Jail, Level 1 and the Outer Cloister, both of which contain Act 1 waypoints.  Outer Steppes is in Act 4, Durance of Hate, Level 3 is home to Mephisto in Act 3, and the Arcane Sanctuary is in Act 2. \n"}, {"text": "Where in the game are we if we're smashing the Compelling Orb?", "correct": "Travincal", "options": ["Far Oasis", "Tal Rasha's Tomb", "Flayer Jungle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTravincal.\n\n\tThe Travincal is the penultimate area found in Act III, directly proceeding the Durance of Hate and the boss fight against Mephisto.  It is at the Travincal where we can complete the third and fifth quests of Act III, 'Khalim's Will' and 'The Blackened Temple' respectively.  The fifth quest directly relates to smashing the Compelling Orb in the final temple at the end of the Travincal (and defeating the members of High Council).  Once the Compelling Orb is smashed, we will lose Khalim's Will much like we lost the Horadric Staff in Act II and we will be able to take a newly-opened staircase doen to the Durance of Hate, Level 1.  The Travincal is the second-to-last waypoint of Act III. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're at the portal to the Arcane Sanctuary?", "correct": "Palace Cellar, Level 3", "options": ["Catacombs, Level 4", "Durance of Hate, Level 2", "Arreat Summit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPalace Cellar, Level 3.\n\n\tAs a major part of the fourth and fifth quests of Act 2, 'Arcane Sanctuary' and 'The Summoner', respectively.  To get here, we need to complete the first three quests of Act 2 and compile the pieces needed to create the Horadric Staff.  When this is done, Jerhyn, the Lord of Lut Gholein, will open up his lavish Harem to us and we'll be able to travel into the Palace Cellar's three floors to fight hordes of evil enemies and make our way into the other dimension in which the Arcane Sanctuary was built (via an obscurely-placed portal).\rThe Arcane Sanctuary (another waypoint on the tour of Act 2) is home to many magic-based creatures such as Spectres as well as The Summoner, a unique sub-boss with a Cold Enchantment hiding randomly in one of the four corners of the map.  Beating this will let us finish the Act and defeat Duriel. \n"}]}
