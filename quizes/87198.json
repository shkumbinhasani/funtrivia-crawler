He proved prescient in 1500 when he drowned off the cape during a storm. This happened while Dias was accompanying Cabral on the mission which had previously reached the coast of Brazil (which Cabral claimed for Portugal).  Intended as a negotiatory mission to India, it ran into trouble at the Cape of Good Hope...7 of the fleet's 13 ships were lost. \n"}, {"text": "Which American poet lept drunk off of a steamship, with only the words 'Goodbye, everybody!' leaving his lips?  \n", "correct": "Hart Crane", "options": ["Ezra Pound", "Archibald McLeish", "Joyce Kilmer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHart Crane.\n\n\tCrane, traveling on the steamboat Orizaba from Mexico to the United States, was drunk and miserable, having gotten into a spat with the wife of a friend, with whom he was having an affair.
