{"id": "183307", "name": "Titles of Movies, Books, Etc. - In Other Words Quiz | Brain Teasers | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", " Word Play", "In Other Words"], "questions": [{"text": "One of my favorite films of all time could have been called 'Move Rhythmically to Music in Tandem with a Carnivorous Mammal of the Species Canis Lupus', but unfortunately it was not.  Which of these Hollywood stars was featured in this film (in other words)?", "correct": "Kevin Costner", "options": ["Jack Nicholson", "Robert Duvall", "Richard Gere"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin Costner.\n\n\tThe film in question is 'Dances with Wolves'.  The taxonomic name for wolf is Canis lupus ('Canis' being Latin for dog, and 'lupus' the Latin for wolf).  If you wish to learn more about this 1990 hit that won Kevin Costner a pair of Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, I recommend my series of quizzes that may be found here: http://www.funtrivia.com/quizlistgold.cfm?cat=1868. \n"}, {"text": "Vincent van Gogh was one of the great artists of the 19th century, but my goodness were the titles of his paintings unimaginative.  For instance, one of his great works might well have been entitled 'Those Who Ingurgitate Tuberous Root Plants from the Nightshade Family', but instead, he selected the safe (and, might I say, banal) route and named the painting...?", "correct": "The Potato Eaters", "options": ["The Leek Eaters", "The Tomato Eaters", "The Pumpkin Eaters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Potato Eaters.\n\n\tVincent van Gogh executed the painting 'The Potato Eaters' in 1885, and it can now be viewed at the van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.  For those of you who were perhaps not aware, a potato is a tuberous root that belongs to the nightshade family of plants.  Though some members of the nightshade family are poisonous, for example belladonna, others, such as the potato, the tomato and the eggplant, are not. \n"}, {"text": "Though not as verbose as some of my other selections, the novel called 'Helios, Withal, Increases in Elevation' in other words might still be a tantalizing selection.  Which of these authors might well have used this as the title of one of his books?", "correct": "Ernest Hemingway", "options": ["John Steinbeck", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "James Joyce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErnest Hemingway.\n\n\t'The Sun Also Rises', published in 1926, was the first of many novels to come for Ernest Hemingway.  Helios, as many of you are aware, was the living embodiment of the sun for the ancient Greeks.  Withal is an archaic term for 'also', used by scholars who wish to appear more erudite than perhaps they really are. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most beautiful works of modern classical music might have been even more beautiful if the title 'Vernal Period among the Massif that Closely Follows the Oriental Contours of the United States' had been settled upon.  Who composed this lovely musical piece that was given a rather more ungenerous name?", "correct": "Aaron Copland", "options": ["George Gershwin", "Irving Berlin", "Stephen Foster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAaron Copland.\n\n\tAaron Copland won a Pulitzer Prize in 1942 for 'Appalachian Spring', a wonderful musical score for a Martha Graham ballet (the piece was originally entitled 'Ballet for Martha'). \r Vernal is an adjective referring to spring.  Massif is a French-derived term (meaning 'massive') for a mountain range. \n"}, {"text": "Among my personal favorite plays is this one, which I have lovingly entitled in other words 'The extinguishing of a human being of the masculine variety who earns income sufficient for living by the vending of miscellaneous objects'.  Which of these playwrights was responsible for the authorship of this wonderful theatrical work?", "correct": "Arthur Miller", "options": ["Eugene O'Neill", "Thornton Wilder", "Bertolt Brecht"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArthur Miller.\n\n\tArthur Miller's 1949 Pulitzer Prize winning 'Death of a Salesman' is certainly one of the great plays of the 20th century.  It features the story of a small time salesman named Willy Loman and his family.  I'm partial to Willy's two sons, Biff and Happy. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these grand films would certainly have broken much greater box office ground had it used my recommended title, 'The Daily Matutinal Repast Coterie'?", "correct": "The Breakfast Club", "options": ["Red Dawn", "The Early Birds", "The Living Daylights"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Breakfast Club.\n\n\tJohn Hughes 1985 film focusing on teenage angst was provided the title 'The Breakfast Club', much against my advise!  Certainly a film title that featured words such as 'matutinal', meaning 'of, or occurring, in the morning', 'repast', meaning 'a meal', and 'coterie', meaning 'a small group of people with mutual interests or shared tastes', would be box office gold.  Alas, perchance not... \n"}, {"text": "Back to the world of painting, I have conjured up another alternate title for a famous work of art that might well have purchased it much greater mass appeal.  Which of these painters could have been responsible for 'The Cyanic Stripling', but resolved instead to select a more conventional title?", "correct": "Thomas Gainsborough", "options": ["Henry Raeburn", "Joshua Reynolds", "Thomas Lawrence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThomas Gainsborough.\n\n\tThomas Gainsborough, that 18th century British painter with a wonderful touch for portraiture, probably is best recognized for his 'The Blue Boy'.  My title, which features the Greek derived term 'cyanic' (an adjective relating to the color blue) and 'stripling' (an archaic term used in reference to a boy) could really have added some verve (or so I fantasize). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these authors might well have entitled one of her most well-known novels 'En Route Towards the Pharos', but in a flash of impatience opted for a much less flashy moniker for the book?", "correct": "Virginia Woolf", "options": ["Anne Br\u00f6nte", "Jane Austen", "Edith Wharton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVirginia Woolf.\n\n\tVirginia Woolf's novel 'To the Lighthouse' was published in 1927.  Certainly during that era the word 'Pharos', referring to the ancient lighthouse at Alexandria that served as one of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World, was extant.  Tis a shame she opted for the less electrifying choice of titles... \n"}, {"text": "'The Articulation of Well Wishes Prior to Imbibing or Upon Bidding One's Adieu' is a longer, and might I add much more eloquent, title (in other words) for what popular American television series?", "correct": "Cheers", "options": ["Friends", "Happy Days", "Good Times"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheers.\n\n\t'Cheers', which ran on NBC from 1982 until 1993, was certainly one of the most popular television series in American history.  Starring Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Rhea Perlman and Woody Harrelson, among others, it was set in a bar in Boston.  It's likely that my title wasn't chosen simply because it would have been difficult to fit so many words on the wooden sign outside the bar. \n"}, {"text": "I now attack the opera world with this suggestion for a title, in other words, that really would have sent ripples through the operatic community: 'Papilionaceous Gentlewoman'.  Which opera might otherwise have been do dually entitled?", "correct": "Madam Butterfly", "options": ["Miss Saigon", "Lady MacBeth", "The Second Mrs. Kong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadam Butterfly.\n\n\tFans of Puccini will likely have sensed that I was referring to the 1904 opera 'Madam Butterfly' with my alternative title, especially if they recognized the similarities between the word 'papilionaceous' and the French term 'papillon' (the one an adjective and the other a noun, the meaning of both relating to 'butterfly'). \n"}]}
