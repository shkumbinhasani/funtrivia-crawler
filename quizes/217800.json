{"id": "217800", "name": "\"Firefly\": \"Objects In Space\" Quiz | Firefly | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Firefly"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Objects in Space\" opens with an extended scene from River's point of view. She hears what crew members aren't saying, feeling their thoughts and emotions. What hidden thought does she hear from Simon?", "correct": "\"I would be there now.\"", "options": ["\"I don't give a flying hump if you're innocent or not.\"", "\"None of it means a . . . thing.\"", "\"I got stupid. The money was too good.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"I would be there now.\"\n\n\tSimon had been telling Kaylee a funny story about the day he made surgeon - and he's clearly thinking that, if he hadn't had to rescue River, he would still be working at the hospital he loved, on top of the world.\r The other choices were uttered by other crew members. Mal, upset about Inara's leaving, thinks \"None of it means a ... thing.\" Jayne, guilty about having betrayed Simon and River in the episode \"Ariel,\" explains to himself that he \"got stupid. The money was too good.\" Shepherd Book apparently doesn't care whether River is innocent or not, a confusing thought from a mysterious man. \n"}, {"text": "River visits the cargo bay and picks up what looks like a tree branch. What is it really?", "correct": "A gun", "options": ["A hand grenade", "A tree branch", "A butcher knife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA gun.\n\n\tThe rest of the crew becomes very agitated and nervous, but she reassures them: \"It's just an object. It's not what you think.\"\r When Mal takes the gun from her (\"No touching guns!\" he scolds), he realizes it was loaded with the safety off: \"A recipe for unpleasantness.\" Thus begins the grand discussion of what to do with River. \n"}, {"text": "In light of this incident, Kaylee decides to tell the others about River's surprising military talent and -- possibly -- mindreading. In what episode did Kaylee witness River's amazing skills?", "correct": "\"War Stories\"", "options": ["\"Trash\"", "\"Bushwhacked\"", "\"Safe\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"War Stories\".\n\n\tIn \"War Stories\", Kaylee was pinned down by three of Niska's marksmen. She had never fought before, and was panicking. River emerged from the ship, took Kaylee's gun, glanced at the enemies, and killed all three of them with her eyes closed. While River had saved her life, Kaylee couldn't help but be a bit unsettled by the experience, and she decided that the others had to know that River was less harmless than she appeared. \n"}, {"text": "A bounty hunter named Early has been following the ship; now he comes aboard. Who is the first crew member he encounters?", "correct": "Mal", "options": ["Jayne", "Simon", "Kaylee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMal.\n\n\tMost of the crew members are asleep as Early skulks through the corridors, but Mal is awake and heading for his bunk. There's a moment of incomprehension after they first spy each other, but then Mal realizes that there's an intruder on the ship. Unfortunately for Mal, Early handily wins the ensuing fistfight; the crew members sleeping nearby don't even wake up. He locks all crew quarters, noticing that Kaylee is not in her bunk, and heads on his way. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Early force to guide him as he searches the ship?", "correct": "Simon", "options": ["Wash", "Book", "Inara"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSimon.\n\n\tAfter tying up Kaylee and beating up Book, Early encounters Simon and asks him to him look for River. Simon refuses -- \"I don't think my last act in this 'verse is going to be betraying my sister\" -- but Early persuades him with two arguments: (1) Every moment Simon is with Early is another moment he can possibly turn the tables, and (2) if Simon does not cooperate, Early promises that Kaylee \"will die weeping.\" Simon goes reluctantly with the bounty hunter. \n"}, {"text": "When River first speaks to Early, where does she tell him she is?", "correct": "In the ship: she _is_ Serenity", "options": ["On the ship, hidden where he'll never find her", "On the ship, right behind him", "Outside the ship, in a spacesuit, clinging to the hull"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the ship: she _is_ Serenity.\n\n\t\"You're wrong, Early,\" River says over the comm after Early threatens her brother's life. \"River's not on the ship. They didn't want her here [a reference to the conference about the gun], but she couldn't make herself leave, so she melted. Melted away . . . I'm not on the ship. I'm in the ship. I am the ship.\" She isn't, of course, but no one on the ship is entirely sure as to the extent of her abilities. Early sums it up best: \"That's somewhat unsettling.\" \n"}, {"text": "River speaks to Kaylee and asks her to help. What does she have Kaylee do after freeing herself?", "correct": "unlock the crew quarters", "options": ["send a distress call", "tackle Early", "lock Early in the bridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nunlock the crew quarters.\n\n\tKaylee is lying bound and frightened in the engine room, but River speaks to her over the comm and tells her she's \"gotta be brave ... Don't be scared. I'm right here.\" After Kaylee frees herself using one of her sharper tools, she sneaks towards the bridge in order to unlock the rest of the crew, trapped in their quarters. It's a terrifying moment for her -- the console is in full view of Early on the bridge -- but she does her part. \n"}, {"text": "Zoe and Wash want to take Early out by brute force, but River forbids it. What is the reason she gives?", "correct": "\"No touching guns!\"", "options": ["\"Your guns won't work anymore.\"", "\"If you shoot him, his superiors will come after us.\"", "\"It's hopeless anyway. Why resist?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"No touching guns!\".\n\n\tAt first she points out that he's wearing armor, but Wash argues with her: \"What about his face? Is his face wearing armor?\" This is when River lays down the law about touching guns, arguing that he'll be leaving soon anyway. It's unclear why she feels so strongly; perhaps she fears for Simon's safety in a shootout, or perhaps she is remembering Mal's lecture to her about guns in the cargo bay. \n"}, {"text": "River shows off a bit on the comm, telling Early about his troubled childhood, the \"darkness inside\", the animals he harmed and the way his mother mistrusted him. It's during the course of this conversation, when she tells him that \"everything in here gleams,\" that he realizes where she really is. Where is she?", "correct": "on his ship", "options": ["outside Serenity, in a spacesuit", "in Inara's shuttle", "in the engine room"], "explanation": "\n\n\non his ship.\n\n\t\"It's very interesting,\" River says when Early works this out. \"All these buttons!\" This is the only time we see the bounty hunter lose his cool, begging her not to touch any buttons or fiddle with any dials.\r Simon and River hid outside Serenity's hull, in spacesuits, when the Alliance searched Serenity in the episode \"Bushwhacked.\" \n"}, {"text": "What does River tell Early in order to persuade him to leave Serenity?", "correct": "She tells him she'll go with him: \"I'll be your bounty, Jubal Early.\"", "options": ["She tells him that the real feds are coming: \"You'd better run, Jubal Early.\"", "She tells him she's rigged Serenity to self-destruct: \"You have five minutes before we scatter our atoms all over space.\"", "She tells him the captain is right behind him with a laser weapon, \"and he's crazy enough to use it.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe tells him she'll go with him: \"I'll be your bounty, Jubal Early.\"\n\n\tShe justifies her decision by telling him she doesn't belong on Serenity; if she weren't there, then \"people could be who they wanted to be, could be with the people they wanted... could live simple. No secrets.\" Simon, anguished, tries to stop this by tackling Early, but is shot for his efforts. It's all part of River's grand plan, though ... but to see how it all works out, you'll have to watch the episode! Thanks for playing. \n"}]}
