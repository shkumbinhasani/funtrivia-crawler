{"id": "245633", "name": "Top Movies of 1981 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1980s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Indiana Jones finds himself in various exotic locals, namely in a Peruvian jungle, a frozen village in Nepal and the winded desert of Egypt, all in the quest for lost idols and sacred treasures.  Meanwhile, he battles insidious Nazis, avoids dreaded snakes, gets beaten up by an irritable ex-girlfriend and cavorts with a monkey with questionable allegiences.  What classic 1981 film is described here?", "correct": "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "options": ["Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", "Young Indiana Jones", "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark.\n\n\tIndiana Jones's wardrobe and accoutrements in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' include a Herbert Johnson Poet fedora, an A-2/Type 440 hybrid leather jacket, a British gas mask bag, a 10-foot bullwhip and a .45 ACP Smith and Wesson Hand Ejector 2nd model revolver.  I'd kill to be able to wear an outfit like that around on a daily basis! \n"}, {"text": "The 1981 film 'Das Boot', a 293 minute (director's cut) exercise in absolutely impeccable filmmaking (not to mention claustrophobia), takes the viewer on a ride with a German U-boat crew during World War II.  Incredibly enough, despite the fact that the U-boat is fighting on the 'wrong' side of the war, the viewer is inevitably drawn in emotionally, sympathizing with the crew on a basic, human level.  What director is responsible for this masterpiece?", "correct": "Wolfgang Petersen", "options": ["Werner Herzog", "Uwe Boll", "Wim Wenders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWolfgang Petersen.\n\n\tWolfgang Petersen started out directing films in Germany, but was inevitably drawn by Hollywood's lure of big budgets and big stars.  Though he has made such films as 'Enemy Mine', 'In the Line of Fire', 'Air Force One' and 'Troy', 'Das Boot' remains his most spectacular film. \n"}, {"text": "1979's 'Mad Max' was such an unexpected hit, it naturally inspired a sequel, namely the 1981 film 'The Road Warrior'.  What action actor's early career is practically defined by his gritty portrayal of the drifting, morally-ambiguous main character Max Rockatansky in this fast-paced thrillfest?", "correct": "Mel Gibson", "options": ["Bruce Willis", "Michael Keaton", "Peter Weller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMel Gibson.\n\n\tBefore he became the emotionally unstable LA detective Martin Riggs, before dawning the kilt for 'Braveheart' and the sword for 'Hamlet', before drawing out Christ's passion and the anger of the Jewish community, Mel Gibson was simply Max.  The one thing he seems to have retained from the character is a certain 'madness'.  Despite his major character flaws, one must admit that without Mel Gibson in the role of Max Rockatansky, the films just would not have been the same. 'The Road Warrior' simply defined the post-apocalyptic, punk rock, high speed road race genre, if indeed there is such a thing! \n"}, {"text": "Though it did not contain a single word of English, or any other intelligible modern language for that matter, this epic film tracing the movements of a lonely tribe of pre-historic humans as they fend off their enemies, search for sustenance and otherwise brave the elements, is breathtaking in its emotional intensity.  What 1981 film directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud fits the description above?", "correct": "Quest for Fire", "options": ["The Last Survivor", "Caveman", "The Clan of the Cave Bear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuest for Fire.\n\n\tFor one thing, the film is done beautifully in every aspect, from the cinematography to the sounds, and from the costumes to the makeup.  For another thing, it features the film debut of Ron Perlman, one of the most underrated actors working today.  It also features the otherwise mediocre actress Rae Dawn Chong in a non-speaking role, a role in which she performs quite admirably.  This movie is certainly one to watch if you're looking for (mostly) quiet intensity. \n"}, {"text": "One of my personal favorites of 1981 is 'Chariots of Fire', an uplifting drama focusing on two track athletes set to compete in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.  In what country is this glorious film set?", "correct": "U.K.", "options": ["Canada", "U.S.", "Australia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nU.K.\n\n\tSpecifically, the film focuses on British athletes Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell, played by Ben Cross and Ian Charleson, respectively.  The two leads do a marvelous job with their characters, but my personal favorite performance in the film is submitted by Ian Holm, who plays Sam Mussabini, the personal trainer of Cross.  Of course, no mention of 'Chariots of Fire' would be complete without an endorsement of the soundtrack by Vangelis.  Once you get the title theme into your head, it's hard to get it out of there! \n"}, {"text": "One of the hidden gems from 1981 is 'Pennies from Heaven', a musical set in depression-era Chicago.  Though the storyline is very depressing, the musical numbers are fantastic; well-choreographed homages to song-and-dance acts of Hollywood past.  Which of these actors or actresses does not appear in this Herbert Ross-directed movie?", "correct": "Henry Winkler", "options": ["Bernadette Peters", "Steve Martin", "Christopher Walken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry Winkler.\n\n\tAlong with Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters, who both perform their own song and dance numbers, are a number of outstanding performers, including the standout Christopher Walken dance number that is not to be missed (yes, I said Christopher Walken!), an intense performance by Jessica Harper and the title song dance sequence by Vernel Bagneris.  Yes, you may feel depressed by the story itself, but the visuals and the music will make the viewing of this film worthwhile. \n"}, {"text": "A band of six dwarves (no, not seven!) steal a map from the Supreme Being that shows the locations of portals through both time and space.  The thieves happen upon a young boy who is inadvertently drawn into their gang as they attempt to avoid the wrath of the Almighty.  All the while, the personification of Evil attempts to lure this diminutive band of kleptomaniacs into his lair so that he may acquire the map and become omnipotent.  Does this plot seem familiar?  What outrageously entertaining film is delineated here?", "correct": "Time Bandits", "options": ["The Fisher King", "Jabberwocky", "Brazil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTime Bandits.\n\n\tOne of my favorite in the Terry Gilliam oeuvre, 'Time Bandits' not only follows a completely ridiculous premise, it also places its main characters in the most absurd situations imaginable...but what's new with Terry Gilliam?  Great performances are submitted in this film by Sean Connery as King Agamemmnon, John Cleese as Robin Hood, Ian Holm as Napoleon, Ralph Richardson as the Supreme Being, David Warner as Evil, Peter Vaughan and Katherine Helmond as Mr. and Mrs. Winston Ogre and the pairing of Shelley Duvall and Michael Palin as an unfortunate couple named Pansy and Vincent (I must have fruit!)\r For the performances alone, the film is worth a look, and if you love Terry Gilliam, this is certainly the movie for you. \n"}, {"text": "'Pixote' is a frightening look at the circumstances surrounding a pack of children who seem to have no supervision in their lives.  Resorting to thievery, prostitution and even murder, the kids in this film virtually play out the circumstances described in 'Lord of the Flies'.  In what country does the action in 1981's 'Pixote' take place?", "correct": "Brazil", "options": ["India", "Zaire", "Albania"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrazil.\n\n\tThis is not a film for the faint of heart, but if you're looking for an interesting analysis of what life on the streets is like in a huge, third world city surrounded by shantytowns, this film will shove it right in your face.  Reminiscent of more recent Brazilian films such as 'City of God' and 'Central Station', 'Pixote' is especially disturbing because the director Hector Babenco drew members of his cast from the streets of Sao Paulo. \n"}, {"text": "'Gallipoli' is the disturbing look at the lives of two young Australian men who are transplanted from their relatively idyllic existences in their homeland to the dangerous battlefields of World War I.  Featuring the acting of Mel Gibson and Mark Lee, 'Gallipoli' was directed by one of Australia's best filmmakers.  Who directed this 1981 film?", "correct": "Peter Weir", "options": ["Phillip Noyce", "Gillian Armstrong", "Stephan Elliott"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter Weir.\n\n\tPeter Weir, well-known for his work on such early films as 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' and 'The Last Wave', gained international attention for 1981's 'Gallipoli'.  He would go on to direct such excellent movies as 'Witness', 'Dead Poets Society' and 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World', among others.  I strongly recommend this film, despite its tragic ending! \n"}, {"text": "'The Woman Next Door' is a quiet film from 1981 that deals with the subjects of love, adultery and obsession, among others.  Called 'La Femme d'a Cote' in French, it tragically was the second-to-last film made by what French auteur?", "correct": "Francois Truffaut", "options": ["Jean-Luc Godard", "Jean Renoir", "Alain Resnais"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancois Truffaut.\n\n\tTruffaut, known for such excellent films as 'The 400 Blows', 'Jules and Jim' and 'Day for Night', was only 52 when he died in 1984.  His cast in 'The Woman Next Door' included Fanny Ardant and Gerard Depardieu.  This is another one of those films that may tend towards the depressing, but films can't always be gleeful!  I recommend it.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it.  Feel free to let me know where you agree or disagree with my list for 1981...I want to hear your opinions! \n"}]}
