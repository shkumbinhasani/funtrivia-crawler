When they arrive at the scene, the Alien Tripod rises from underground and begins shooting its heat rays at people; turning them to ashes.

When they arrive, confused refugees force them to leave the car behind and climb onto the ferry just as the Tripods arrive.

When there's a large explosion, Ray fears that Robbie is dead and takes Rachel to the abandoned house where Harlan Ogilvy is staying.  He tells them to stay since he has enough food to last them a few weeks. When he pulls Ray aside to get to know each other, he offers up a bit of Peach Schnapps (which he has a crate full of) and he says that his whole family was killed by the Tripods.  This contributes to Harlan's insanity while Ray and Rachel are staying with him. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the lullaby that Rachel asks Ray to sing to her?", "correct": "Hushabye Mountain", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHushabye Mountain.\n\n\tWhen Rachel tries to go to sleep in the old house, she asks him to sing \"Hushabye Mountain\", but he can't since he doesn't know the words.

When Ray runs outside, the aliens capture her and Ray finds a bunch of grenades in an army truck and has himself get captured.

Ray and Rachel finally arrive at their destination and they reunite with Mary Ann, Tim, and Rachel and Robbie's Grandparents.  We also find that Robbie survived the explosion and made it to Boston before they did.\r \"From the moment the invaders arrived, breathed our air, ate, and drank, they were doomed. They were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by the tiniest creatures that God, in His wisdom, put upon this earth. By the toll of a billion deaths, man has earned his immunity, his right to survive among this planet's infinite organisms, and that right is ours against all challenges. For neither do men live nor die in vain.\" \n"}]}
