The sequence lists the real first names of the last six Popes of the 20th century, so you need to identify who came next. \r Austrian-born Achille Ratti was the 259th Pope, Pius XI who held office from 1922-39. Roman-born Eugenio Pacelli was Pope Pius XII from 1939-58. Another Italian, \u00c0ngelo Roncalli, was John XXIII from 1958-63. Italian Giovanni Montini reigned from 1963-78 as Pope Paul VI. Then came the short-lived Pope John Paul I, Italian Albino Luciani, who held office for just 33 days. Polish-born Karol Wojty\u0142a (probably the biggest clue) reigned as Pope John Paul II from 1978-2005. The first 21st-Century and the 265th Pope (and the next in the sequence) was German-born Joseph Alois Ratzinger, who took office as Benedict XVI in 2005 and abdicated in February 2013. \n"}, {"text": "U.S.A.

It is not, though, the state of which they were the governor before they became President (George H.W. Bush was never a state governor), so Illinois was an option just to tempt you. The key is the state in which each President was born.\r The 39th US President, Jimmy Carter, was in office from 1977-81. He was born in Plains, Georgia. Ronald Reagan (the first divorc\u00e9e to become President) held office from 1981-89. He was born in Tampico, Illinois.  George H.W. Bush, President from 1989-93, was born in Milton, Massachusetts.

George W Bush, President from 2001-2009 and the second son of a former President to hold the job (John Quincy Adams was the first), was born in New Haven, Connecticut.

Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Cl\u00e9zio won in 2008. Romanian-born German poet/novelist Herta M\u00fcller won in 2009. Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa won in 2010 and Sweden's Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer in 2011.

They all have Roman equivalents, and if you look at that list instead you will see a very familiar pattern. The Roman equivalent for Hermes, the Messenger God, is Mercury. Aphrodite's equivalent is Venus. There is no God named Earth.Mars is the Roman equivalent of Mars. Zeus, the King of the Greek Gods, is matched by Jupiter, the Roman equivalent. The next in the sequence is, therefore, Saturn's Greek equivalent, which is Cronus.

Eleanor Smith became First Lady in 1977 as the wife of Jimmy Carter. Nancy Robbins first became Nancy Davis before she married Ronald Reagan. Barbara Pierce married the first President Bush and is the mother of the second. The biggest clue was probably Hillary Rodham, who still sometimes uses the name with 'Clinton' appended. Laura Welch became First Lady as the wife of George W Bush. The next in the sequence is, therefore, Robinson, which was the surname with which Michelle Obama was born.\r The alternatives would appeared earlier in the sequence -- Elizabeth Bloomer became Betty Ford, Thelma Ryan was the birth name of Pat Nixon, and Claudia Taylor is better known as Ladybird Johnson. \n"}, {"text": "U.K. POLITICS: Which comes next in this sequence? \nCardiff South East, Finchley, Huntingdon, Sedgefield, Kirkcaldy & Cowdenbeath, _______ .", "correct": "Witney", "options": ["Huyton", "Kinross & Western Perthshire", "Sidcup"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWitney.\n\n\tThe subject for this list is British Prime Ministers and, specifically, the constituencies from which they were elected to Parliament.
