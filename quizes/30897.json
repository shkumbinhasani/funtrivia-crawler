But three flags' stars represent specific stars in the nighttime sky. Which three states?", "correct": "Maine, Alaska and Minnesota", "options": ["Maine, Missouri and Texas", "Texas, Minnesota and Missouri", "Missouri, Alaska and Maine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaine, Alaska and Minnesota.\n\n\tMaine's has a star above the state seal representing the North Star, because it was the northernmost state of the Union when it was admitted. Alaska's flag has the stars of Ursa Major (Big Dipper) as well as the North Star, said to represent the future state of Alaska and its far northerly position. Alaska's flag was designed by a 13-year-old orphan, Benny Benson. (Arguably, Arizona star represents the Sun, but I asked for nighttime sky stars.) \n"}, {"text": "Nine states have 13 of something on their flags, representative of the original 13 states.

Some have mostly red, white, and blue, but then add their state seal, which has other colors in it (e.g. Wyoming). The states that are strictly red, white, and blue are Arkansas, Hawaii, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas. (I have recently added Arkansas, as someone (a Brit, no less) has pointed out that I had forgot it. So those that previously answered '6' were right and '5' were wrong. I'm sorry that I can't amend the scores, but it's right now.) \n"}, {"text": "How many states' flags have a bear or bears on them?", "correct": "2", "options": ["5", "3", "4"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tCalifornia has one bear.
