Frank Robinson hit two grand slams in consecutive at-bats in a game.  The Giants' Jim Ray Hart tied a Major League record by hitting six RBIs in one inning.  The Braves' Hank Aaron smacked his 3000th career hit.  Amongst all that, the National League saw which pitcher set a single game record by striking out 19 San Diego Padre players, with 10 of them being consecutive to end the game?", "correct": "Tom Seaver", "options": ["Robin Roberts", "Roy Halladay", "Bob Feller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Seaver.\n\n\tSeaver and the Mets had their stuff on April 22.  Tom threw a two-hitter against the Padres, and gave up their only run by an Al Ferrara second inning home run.  They won the game 2-1.\rThe year also saw Curt Flood of the Cardinals file suit against Major League Baseball involving the contract reserve clause.  Aaron's 3000th hit came off Wayne Granger of the Reds on May 17th.  In Jim Ray Hart's huge fifth inning on July 8 against the Braves, he hit a three-run home run off Phil Niekro, then a three-run triple off Aubrey Gatewood for a total of six RBIs.  He went on to hit for the cycle in the game in the 13-0 Giants win.  The Orioles' Frank Robinson's grand slams were against the Washington Senators. \n"}, {"text": "The 1971 season saw the Cubs' Ernie Banks hit the final home run of his career, number 512.  The Pittsburgh Pirates won the World Series.  Also, in a strange event, why did the BBWAA (Baseball Writers' Association of America) not induct anyone into the Hall of Fame?", "correct": "Nobody received enough votes", "options": ["The association was sued over balloting rules", "The ballots were inadvertently not sent out on time, and the voting process passed the deadline", "The association president was charged with ballot-fixing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNobody received enough votes.\n\n\tThe Hall of Fame opened its doors in 1936 when it inducted Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Babe Ruth, and Honus Wagner.  In 1971, no person received the 270 votes that were required for them to be inducted.  In fact, no person was even close to the 270-mark.  The closest number was 242, and those ballots belonged to Yankee star Yogi Berra (Berra would be inducted in 1972).\rErnie Banks, known as 'Mr. Cub', hit his 512th home run on August 24 off pitcher Jim McGlothlin of the Reds.  The Pirates' World Series crown against the Orioles was the team's fourth series crown.  In 1971, Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn also made new policy and opened the Hall of Fame doors up to players of the Negro Leagues. \n"}, {"text": "In 1972, a weird thing came to view on June 4th.  Of the 16 games pitched on that day, eight of them were by shutout.  Nolan Ryan missed a perfect game by one pitch.  Roberto Clemente hit a double in the final at-bat of his career.  On another note, who was the first player in almost 60 years to grow and wear a moustache during league play?", "correct": "Reggie Jackson", "options": ["Joe DiMaggio", "Duke Snider", "Lou Gehrig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReggie Jackson.\n\n\tIn another one of Reggie's, 'Hey, look at me!' antics, he brought his natural moustache to an Oakland Athletics game.  This was enhanced into a trend by Athletics owner Charlie Finley in offering money to all his players who would grow one.  This brought on Rollie Fingers' famous handlebar moustache amongst others.  Jackson was the first player since Wally Schang in 1914 to wear one.    \rIn Ryan's game, he gave up a first inning one-out single to Boston's Carl Yastrzemski, then retired the next 26 batters in a row.  Clemente's final hit of his career, a double, came off Jon Matlack of the Mets on September 30.  It was the 3000th hit of his career.  Clemente was killed three months later in a plane crash.  In another strange occurrence, a last place team had a Cy Young Award winner.  Steve Carlton threw a 27-10 season for his last place Phillies.  The Twin's Rod Carew was also the first player to win an AL batting crown without hitting a home run in the season. \n"}, {"text": "Amongst the weirdness of 1973, Frank Robinson completed the cycle of hitting a home run in all 32 Major League ballparks.  Wilbur Wood of the Chicago White Sox was the last pitcher to start both games of a doubleheader.  The 'designated hitter' rule was approved by the American League.  Willie Mays hit the final home run of his career.  In a final note, strikeout king Nolan Ryan broke Sandy Koufax's single season strikeout record when he struck out the final batter that he faced in the season.  Who was this Minnesota Twins victim?", "correct": "Rich Reese", "options": ["Tony Perez", "Albert Pujols", "Larry Bowa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRich Reese.\n\n\tReese struck out only 23 times in the season, but it would give Ryan number 383, breaking Koufax's 1965 record by one strikeout.\rRobinson was a California Angel at the time, and was in his 18th season when he completed the pie slices.  Wood's attempt to duplicate early baseball pitching by starting both doubleheader games turned into a fiasco.  The White Sox lost both games, 12-0 and 7-0.  On August 17th, Willie Mays' 660th home run, his career final, was dished up by Don Gullett of the Reds. \n"}, {"text": "The 1974 season began with a historical bang.  Hank Aaron tied Babe Ruth's mark of 714 home runs on April 4th.  Later in the season, the Mets and which other team played a 25-inning game that took over seven hours to complete?", "correct": "Cardinals", "options": ["Tigers", "Athletics", "Orioles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCardinals.\n\n\tInterleague play had not yet been introduced.  The Mets hosted the Cardinals, with the Mets starting Jerry Koosman against the Cardinals' Bob Forsch. Forsch went six innings, Koosman went nine, then the fun began.  The game was tied at 3-3 going into the 10th, and it would remain that score until the top of the 25th when Bake McBride singled.  In a crazy play, the Mets had him picked off first, but first baseman John Milner choked out an error, then McBride ran to second.  Then, another throwing error allowed him to score.  The final was Cardinals 4, Mets 3.  The game set many other records than the obvious also.  The game lasted seven hours and 25 minutes, with the Mets batting 103 times.  The game began with an attendance of 13,460, and ended with less than 1000 at the 3:00am local time finish.\rAs for the great Hank Aaron, his 714th home run which tied the great Babe Ruth, came off pitcher Jack Billingham of the Reds.  It was a shame that Aaron could not tie or break Ruth's record in the previous season.  Thus, he and his family went through tons of racial issues and death threats during the offseason.  A few days after number 714, came the new record for Hank. \n"}, {"text": "The 1975 season had its ups and down.  Baseball lost Casey Stengel on September 29.  The Reds won the first of two consecutive World Series via the 'Big Red Machine'.  Also, after almost 30 years of when Jackie Robinson became Major League Baseball's first African-American modern day player, baseball had its first African-American manager.  His name was Frank Robinson.  Which American League team did he manage in this 1975 season? ", "correct": "Cleveland Indians", "options": ["Chicago Cubs", "Montreal Expos", "Anaheim Angels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCleveland Indians.\n\n\tAfter making a name for himself playing with the Reds and Orioles for many seasons, he took the helm of the Cleveland Indians in 1975, replacing Ken Aspromonte.  He would manage the Indians for three seasons, then four with the Giants before taking over the Orioles in 1988.  He was Manager of the Year in 1989 with Baltimore. During Frank's baseball career, the awards he won were the 1956 NL Rookie of the Year, 1961 NL MVP, 1966 AL Babe Ruth Award, 1966 AL Triple Crown Award, 1966 Major League Player of the Year Award, 1966 AL MVP, 1966 World Series MVP, 1971 All-Star Game MVP, and 1989 Manager of the Year Award. Robinson was also inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 1982. \n"}, {"text": "The fans in 1976 saw the Cincinnati Reds win their second consecutive World Series.  The Pirates' John Candeleria missed a perfect game by one base-on-balls.  Yankee Stadium was renovated.  Hank Aaron hit the final home run of his career.  Fans also saw which Yankee become the first Yankee captain since Lou Gehrig in the 1930s?", "correct": "Thurman Munson", "options": ["Derek Jeter", "Tony Lazzeri", "Roger Maris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThurman Munson.\n\n\tMunson was the 1970 American League Rookie of the Year.

Like fellow-Yankee Lou Gehrig, Munson's career ended early in life, and Munson died in a plane crash.  \rThe Yankees would go on to lose in the World Series against the Reds.  It was the second time in history that the Yankees were skunked in a World Series, the first being by the 1963 Dodgers.  Aaron hit number 755 off pitcher Dick Drago of the Angels on July 20.  In another rare feat, on April 17, Mike Schmidt of the Phillies hit four home runs in four consecutive at-bats. \n"}, {"text": "Baseball's 1977 season had a few 'firsts' of its own.

Jackson, nicknamed 'Mr. October', wasn't picky as he hit his three home runs off three different Dodger pitchers in game six.  The Dodger victims were Burt Hooton, Charlie Hough, and Elias Sosa.  Reggie's other two blasts came in game four and game five.  He had nine hits and batted .450 in the series to also win the series MVP.  \rFrank Robinson became the first African-American manager when the Indians hired him in 1975.  After only 57 games of the 1977 season, the Indians fired him and replaced him with Jeff Torborg.  Mary Shane was the first female regular play-by-play announcer when she was hired by the White Sox media team.  Fans also mourned the loss of Hall of Famers Bucky Harris and Ernie Lombardi in the year. \n"}, {"text": "Baltimore fans in 1978 saw Cal Ripken Jr. drafted into the big leagues.  They knew little of the upcoming.  The Cubs and Expos set a record by using 45 players in one game.  A U.S. District Court Judge lifted the ban on female reporters in locker rooms.  Willie McCovey hit his 500th home run.  Pete Rose would get career hit number 3000.

Ron went on to strike out 248 in the season.  \rRipken was drafted in the second round in the 1978 draft, but would not begin his Major League career until 1981.  He would go on to break Lou Gehrig's consecutive game playing streak.  On May 5, Rose collected his 3000th career hit off Montreal pitcher Steve Rogers.  A month later, Rose would start his 44-game hitting streak.  The District Court ruling came after \"Sports Illustrated\" filed suit against the Yankees for banning their female reporters from the Yankee locker room.  Judge Constance Baker Motley ruled that women reporters could no longer be banned from the locker rooms of all New York City sports teams. \n"}, {"text": "The umpires made an impact on baseball in 1979 by going on a 45-day strike.
