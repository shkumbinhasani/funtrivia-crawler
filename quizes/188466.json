It's the provost marshal's office to investigate BJ.  What is the accusation against BJ?", "correct": "That he's an imposter", "options": ["That he's been performing illegal medical procedures", "That he didn't complete army officer's training", "That he is embezzling army funds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat he's an imposter.\n\n\tOf course the viewer soon discovers that there is no investigation, it's only a mischievous friend of BJ's looking for a good laugh.  \r Radar sings the 'ABC' song at the beginning of the episode while he thumbs through the files in Colonel Potter's filing cabinet.  The Colonel joins in the song for the first round, but requests that Radar cease the childish song when he begins anew. \n"}, {"text": "Soon after the annoying phone call, Colonel Potter is confronted with an even more vexing problem.  Enter, Max Klinger and his invisible camel!  Klinger wears an Arab headdress and coddles his invisible camel, which he has named...?", "correct": "Habibi", "options": ["Ayesha", "Maya", "Fatimah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHabibi.\n\n\tAccording to Klinger, Habibi is a high-spirited two-humper (or bactrian) that spits.  Colonel Potter is especially annoyed at Klinger's antics on this day, especially now that he has to deal with the provost marshal's office.  Radar is rather amused, however, and insists that he will write home about it.  After Klinger exits, Radar comments on the smell, which Colonel Potter explains is 'Lebanese aftershave'. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter frantically searches for BJ in order to inform him about the impending arrival of the provost marshal.  He finds BJ in the mess tent, along with Hawkeye and Father Mulcahy.  Potter reveals some information about the phone call he has received, including the name of the 'colonel' whose intended arrival at the 4077th is imminent.

(BJ's response: 'The league of women voters.')\r When Colonel Potter provides the name Bardonaro, BJ understands right away what is happening.  It's his friend Leo Bardonaro from Stanford playing a practical joke. \n"}, {"text": "It turns out that the charges against BJ are phony, set up by BJ's old pal Leo.  Speaking of Leo, which of these character actors plays the role of BJ's practical joking medical school pal?", "correct": "James Cromwell", "options": ["Joe Piscopo", "Matt Freuer", "Ed Binns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Cromwell.\n\n\tYou may recognize James Cromwell from other television and movie roles.

In this episode, his only appearance on 'M*A*S*H', he really gives BJ a hard time with his wacky practical joking high jinks. \n"}, {"text": "Leo arrives at the 4077th and pays BJ and Hawkeye a brief visit.  On his way out the door, Leo is able to pull off two practical jokes, with Hawkeye and BJ the respective victims.  What time-honored method does he use to 'get' BJ?", "correct": "Exploding cigar", "options": ["Trick chewing gum", "Joy buzzer", "Whoopee cushion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExploding cigar.\n\n\tWhen Leo offers BJ a cigar he takes the one from Leo's mouth, not trusting his old pal.  Little does BJ know that Leo has anticipated his friend's mistrust and has pulled the old switcheroo in reverse.  While departing after some ever-so-brief repartee, Leo manages to cajole Hawkeye into a joy buzzer-handshake.  After leaving the Swamp, BJ laughs at Hawkeye only to have the cigar blow up in his face.  Looks like Leo is not beneath even the cheapest tricks! \n"}, {"text": "Soon after Leo's departure, a pair of MPs arrive at the 4077th with arrest orders.  Once again Leo has pulled a fast one on BJ, having used his old pal's name to sign into a hotel in Seoul.

Bardonaro also had the brilliant idea of holding a barbecue on the hotel balcony, filling some of the hotel rooms with smoke.  After someone shouted 'fire!', the general and his secretary, both in the buff, ran into the hotel hallway.  Needless to say...the General was not pleased. \n"}, {"text": "BJ is taken away by the MPs, with Hawkeye and Colonel Potter following quickly behind with evidence meant to acquit BJ of any involvement in the hotel incident.  After they leave the 4077th, an angry and upset Margaret insists that Radar make a call to Tokyo so that she may talk to her husband Donald.  Why is Radar unable to make the call?", "correct": "The generator at I-corps has burned out, leaving Sparky helpless to patch calls through", "options": ["Colonel Potter has given Radar strict orders to keep the phone lines clear", "Eisenhower is in Korea and all the phone lines are busy", "There has been an earthquake in Tokyo and all the phone lines are down"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe generator at I-corps has burned out, leaving Sparky helpless to patch calls through.\n\n\tRadar makes an attempt to get a call through to Tokyo, but he soon discovers (to his chagrin) that a generator is down at I-corps and that they won't get another frequency till midnight.  Margaret raises havoc in Radar's office, tossing papers and folders about.  With Radar scrambling on the floor, collecting his papers, Margaret takes the opportunity to kick our poor little beloved Corporal in the rump.  She ends her rampage by placing the garbage can directly over Radar's head (he did somewhat deserve this, calling Margaret 'old'). \n"}, {"text": "In the following scene we see BJ, alongside Hawkeye and Colonel Potter, attempting to clear his name.  What activity does BJ use as his alibi during the time that the hotel incident occurred?", "correct": "Company sock wash", "options": ["Cesspool boat races", "Camp spitting contest", "Late night poker game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCompany sock wash.\n\n\tAside from duty logs and company reports which show that BJ was clearly at the 4077th on the day of the shenanigans at the hotel, Hawkeye points out that BJ attended a company sock wash that evening.  When Colonel Potter is questioned about the sock wash, he answers that he did not attend because it was 'for the younger crowd'.  The General persists, not believing the sock wash alibi.  He produces a hat from the hotel room and insists that BJ try it on.  BJ complies; it turns out to be at least three sizes too big for BJ's head.  That finally settles the matter. \n"}, {"text": "Upon returning to the 4077th, Hawkeye and BJ find Leo waiting in the Swamp, just as expected.  You see, BJ has pulled a fast one on Leo and stolen his buddy's travel papers.  BJ returns them to Leo and sees him off.  Unfortunately, Leo appears to get the last laugh.

But, in reality BJ has gotten the last laugh, as we shall soon see! \n"}, {"text": "Despite Leo's efforts to have the last laugh in this show, BJ and Hawkeye enjoy the ultimate guffaw of the episode.

Hawkeye queries after why BJ is taking the 'joke' so well.  BJ responds, 'Well, he'll (Leo) be walking back here in about an hour.  The only thing gassed up in that jeep was us!'\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope that it was you who got the last laugh.
