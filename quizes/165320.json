Kaufman and Moss Hart; it later became a movie with Monty Woolley (doing a superb job) and Bette Davis.

It is supposedly a portrayal of Harpo Marx. \n"}, {"text": "\"On The Waterfront\" was said to be a (thinly) disguised comment by the movie's director on the \"rightness\" of going forward and \"naming names\" in the days of the Hollywood Blacklist. Who was the director? ", "correct": "Elia Kazan", "options": ["Billy Wilder", "William Friedkin", "Fred Zinnemann"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElia Kazan.\n\n\tKazan spoke out -- and took some heat.

Cooper", "The Sharon Tate Murders", "The Black Dahlia Murder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack the Ripper.\n\n\tThe movie starred Laird Cregar as a Ripper-type murderer. (It wasn't too bad for an old black-and-white movie.) \n"}, {"text": "\"Washington Square\" was said to be a work of fiction -- but the author was criticized for his portrayal of a woman who actually lived in the area. Who was the author?", "correct": "Henry James", "options": ["John Steinbeck", "Jack London", "F. Scott Fitzgerald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry James.\n\n\tJames professed surprise at the criticism, but others said they \"clearly\" recognized the woman being described.
