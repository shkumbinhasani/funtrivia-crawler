It turns out, however, that they gave it what mundane title?", "correct": "Rain Man & Rainman", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRain Man & Rainman.\n\n\tThe word pluvial relates to rainfall, as an adjective, and to a period of increased rainfall as a noun.  Hombre is a Spanish word meaning 'man' that has been adopted into the English language by people who are cool.\r The film 'Rain Man' starred Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise as Raymond and Charlie Babbit, respectively.  Raymond, who receives a fortune from their recently deceased father, suffers from Autism.  Charlie kidnaps Raymond from a mental institution in order that he may 'get his half'. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite films is the 1986 adventure/drama that could otherwise have been called 'Perch Yourself in an Erect Position within the Vicinity of Yours Truly'.  Instead, they chose what run-of-the-mill title for this Rob Reiner film?", "correct": "Stand by Me", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStand by Me.\n\n\t'Stand by Me' starred River Phoenix, Will Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell as four youngsters who set out on a trek to see a dead body.  It was based on the Stephen King novella called 'The Body'.  The names of their characters were Chris Chambers, Gordie LaChance, Teddy Duchamp and Vern Tessio, respectively. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these pairs of actors teamed up in the 1994 film that unfortunately wasn't called 'Obtuse, and Yet Even More So' (but tragically could have been, in other words)?", "correct": "Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels", "options": ["Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott", "Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter", "Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJim Carrey and Jeff Daniels.\n\n\tI am, of course, referring to the 1994 classic 'Dumb and Dumber', directed by the Farrelly brothers.  This was the first film directed by this crazy pair of siblings who have also brought us 'Kingpin', 'There's Something About Mary' and the extremely underrated 'Stuck on You' (I highly recommend the last film!) \n"}, {"text": "This 1956 film starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Vincente Minnelli could feasibly have been titled 'Cupidity for that Condition that Distinguishes Animals and Plants from Inorganic Matter' in other words, but they instead opted for the more pedestrian...?", "correct": "Lust for Life", "options": ["Hunger for Humanity", "Love of Stone", "Desire of the Flesh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLust for Life.\n\n\tCupidity is another word for lust, or greed.\r The film 'Lust for Life' featured Kirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh, the tortured Dutch painter.  Anthony Quinn played his French companion Paul Gauguin and James Donald takes a turn as Theo, van Gogh's loving brother.  The movie chronicles the life and times of the troubled but wonderfully talented painter. \n"}, {"text": "For marketing purposes, a certain film produced in 1975 would probably have been entitled 'The Lowest Cardinal Number Soared above the Eyrie of the Cuculus Canorus' if I was in charge.  The less crafty film producer (and indeed, book author) opted for a different title.  Who starred in the film with the title above, in other words?", "correct": "Jack Nicholson", "options": ["Robert De Niro", "Gene Hackman", "Warren Beatty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Nicholson.\n\n\t'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' was the boring old title chosen by author Ken Kesey, and carried over by director Milos Forman (and producer Michael Douglas).  The film also featured Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Scatman Crothers.   By the way, an 'eyrie' is typically a nest used by eagles and other birds of prey (probably not cuckoos).  The taxonomic name for the cuckoo bird is Cuculus canorus. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these eminent Hollywood directors might very well have created the 1976 masterpiece 'Operator of the Fiacre' before settling on the more quotidian title by which the film is actually known, in other words?", "correct": "Martin Scorsese", "options": ["Steven Spielberg", "Francis Ford Coppola", "Sidney Lumet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartin Scorsese.\n\n\tProbably Scorsese's finest film was the out of kilter 1976 drama 'Taxi Driver', starring Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Jodi Foster and Harvey Keitel.  (I apologize to fans of 'Raging Bull' and/or 'Good Fellows' who believe otherwise!)\r A fiacre was a four-wheeled carriage used in the days before the automobile as a public transport.  The name comes from the H\u00f4tel de St Fiacre in Paris. \n"}, {"text": "Another classic of Hollywood with a dull name, this 1961 film could more wisely have been denominated 'Chronicle about the Occidental Margin' in other words.  Rather than challenge the audience with such a provocative title, however, directors Wise and Robbins chose the pedestrian name by which the film is now known.  What was the film called? ", "correct": "West Side Story", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWest Side Story.\n\n\tThe musical 'West Side Story' won Wise and Robbins a pair of Oscars for Best Director (the first time that that award was shared).  Actresses Natalie Wood and Rita Moreno featured prominently in the film, portraying Maria and Anita, respectively.  The film follows the basic premise of the Shakespeare play 'Romeo and Juliet'...two warring factions (the Jets and the Sharks) and a romance that blooms between two kids, one belonging to each side.\r Occident is the term for 'west' from Latin, still occasionally used by daring and/or bored academics to spruce up otherwise monotonous scholarly tomes. \n"}, {"text": "'Very Potently Go the Way of the Flesh' sounds like a title Shakespeare would have chosen, no?  I certainly would have selected this title for the 1988 action/thriller that was ultimately given a far less stimulating moniker, in other words.  Who was the main character of the film in question?", "correct": "John McClane", "options": ["John Rambo", "John Matrix", "John Spartan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn McClane.\n\n\tBruce Willis starred as New York police officer John McClane in the action hit 'Die Hard' (and its much less thrilling sequels, as well).  The film probably wouldn't have worked without great supporting performances by Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Paul Gleason and William Atherton, among others.\r To 'go the way of the flesh' is a euphemistic way to say 'to die'.  It sounds so much more pleasant... \n"}, {"text": "The 1958 film which I might have called 'That Condition Characterized by a Sense of Dizzyness and Loss of Balance, Brought on by Either Looking Down from a High Elevation or by a Disease of the Inner Ear' was rather parsimoniously provided a one-word title, in other words, by Alfred Hitchcock.  What name did he choose for the film?", "correct": "Vertigo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVertigo.\n\n\tOne of Hitchcock's classics, 'Vertigo' was based on the French novel 'D'Entre les Morts' (From Among the Dead) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, which was written especially for Hitchcock's use.  It starred Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak, and is considered a classic of the art of film-making.  In the film, Jimmy Stewart is hired to investigate the erratic behavior of the Kim Novak character, and runs into a tangled we of intrigue beyond his control. \n"}, {"text": "Which 1957 film classic starring Henry Fonda conceivably could have been entitled 'A Duodecad of Highly Irascible Male Personages of the Species Homo Sapiens Sapiens', but foolishly was given a less verbose title (in other words)?", "correct": "Twelve Angry Men", "options": ["The Wild Bunch", "The Dirty Dozen", "The Magnificent Seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelve Angry Men.\n\n\tOne of my favorite films of all time, 'Twelve Angry Men' also features Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, Jack Warden and a host of other good performers.  The men in the title are members of a jury that must deliberate a case involving a young man accused of killing his father.  If you haven't seen it, you must!\r A duodecad is an archaic term connoting a group of twelve.  The human species is called Homo sapiens (sub-species: Sapiens).\r Thank you for having tried this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other stuff. \n"}]}
