{"id": "271236", "name": "Alphabetical Horror Films - C Online Trivia | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Which horror movie was based on the Clive Barker short story, \"The Forbidden\"?", "correct": "Candyman", "options": ["Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things", "The Children of the Corn", "Cherry Falls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCandyman.\n\n\tDirector Bernard Rose was perhaps best known for his work on Clive Barker's \"Candyman\", his only horror release. First available to view in theaters in 1992, the film revolved around Virgnia Madsen's character, Helen, as she began her thesis on urban legends. When she began to uncover the legend of the Candyman, she realized that some urban legends were dying to be recognized. Soon, she had to fight what may either be her own madness or the wrath of one of time's forgotten myths.\rThe original \"Candyman\" film did quite well in the box office, grossing three times its $8,000,000 budget. Two sequels, \"Farewell to the Flesh\" and \"Day of the Dead\", were released in 1995 and 1999 respectively to continue the story of the fabled Candyman though neither of these were directly written by Barker himself. It remains as yet another example of Clive Barker's tendency to make cult horror films. \n"}, {"text": "Eli Roth's first venture into the director's chair was with what film?", "correct": "Cabin Fever", "options": ["Campfire Tales", "The Children", "Creep"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCabin Fever.\n\n\t\"Cabin Fever\", released in 2002, was Roth's first feature film. While its budget was quite minute, the film grossed $30,000,000 in the box office. This unprecedented gross revenue later led him to greenlight work on the \"Hostel\" films, renowned for their unflinching inclusion of violence and torture. Roth, aside from directing, has also acted in the Quentin Tarantino films \"Death Proof\" and \"Inglorious Basterds\".\r\"Cabin Fever\" itself was based on the premise of five friends taking a trip to a remote cabin in the woods. When they arrived, everything was fine until one of them got sick. Soon, they came to realize that a flesh-eating disease was in the water system but, of course, it was too late for many of them to act on it. When the sheriff's department found out, it was a matter of self-preservation for all sides of the battle. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these films about a haunting won the first Canadian 'Genie' Award?", "correct": "The Changeling", "options": ["Curtains", "C. H. U. D.", "Cat's Eye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Changeling.\n\n\tNot to be confused with the 2008 Angelina Jolie film \"Changeling\", \"The Changeling\" was released in 1980. The film itself revolved around a man who  lost his family in a tragic accident. When he moved across the country in order to rebuild his life, he discovered that his house may have a ghost or two of its own. Inevitably, he needed to deal with the poltergeists within his new abode and solve the mysteries behind them.\r\"The Changeling\" was directed by Peter Medak. Notably, the film was Canadian-made, shot in Canada, but with an American cast. The film was the first Genie Award-winning title -taking home wins for Best Picture, Foreign Actor and Actress, and five other awards. The director is also known for his work on \"Species II\", released in 1998 and based on the original film starring Natasha Henstridge. \n"}, {"text": "Which film contained the vignettes \"Something to Tide You Over\" and \"They're Creeping Up on You!\"?", "correct": "Creepshow", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreepshow.\n\n\t\"Creepshow\" was a joint-venture by famous horror write Stephen King and famous horror movie-maker George A. Romero (known for the 'of the Dead' series). The 1982 original featured five different stories starring numerous famous actors. Perhaps the best known segment of the show, \"Something to Tide You Over\" (written by Stephen King) featured Ted Danson being buried to his neck in beach sand and being killed as the tide rolls in.\r\"Creepshow\", released in 1982 originally, was followed by two sequels in 1987 and 2006 with more planned long after. As the series progressed, less and less original Romero/King works were used for the anthology until none were used at all. The original, however, was quite successful financially and critically.  The entire film series was loosely based on the \"EC Comic Book\" series. \n"}, {"text": "Released in 2005, which film starred Jon Bon Jovi?", "correct": "Cry Wolf", "options": ["The Cave", "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari", "Cursed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCry Wolf.\n\n\tThough \"Cry Wolf\" really never picked up speed after its initial theatrical run, the film itself ended up winning its way into the spotlight through a film making competition. After $1,000,000 was spent to make the film, the resulting win inevitably ended up earning director Jeff Wadlow a hefty $16,000,000 in the box office. Moviegoers may recognize his name as the one behind direction in the 2008 movie \"Never Back Down\", his second film.\r\"Cry Wolf\" was set at a private school and was based on the idea of a crafty murderer using chatboards, cell phones, and other technology to inevitably trap and lure his victims. The title of the film itself, \"Cry_Wolf\", was the screen name of the murderer on the protagonist's computer screen. Jon Bon Jovi, who had only appeared in one horror movie prior to \"Cry Wolf\", is known best for his music in the band Bon Jovi, but also for his work on the TV show \"Ally McBeal\". \n"}, {"text": "The sequel to what 1997 film was entitled \"Hypercube\"?", "correct": "Cube", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCube.\n\n\tMade in Canada, this ubiquitous film took place inside a series of maze-like cubic rooms connected with one another on every wall, floor, and ceiling, some of which were safe and some of which contained horribly deadly traps. As certain people found themselves waking up in these horrible chambers, no one could determine why they were there, how to get out, or what they could do to stay alive.\r\"Cube 2: Hypercube\" (released in 2002) and \"Cube Zero\" (released as a prequel in 2004) explored similar themes and gave more backstory to the ideas and concepts of the cube itself, but neither touched on the social commentary displayed by the original (though the traps were still just as deadly, if not more confusing).\rThough the film initially had a little budget, it quickly became popular as a cult classic sci-fi/horror title. The film had such a small budget that the entire movie was filmed in one cube set. \n"}, {"text": "Which horror franchise was about a doll possessed by a man named Charles Lee Ray?", "correct": "Child's Play", "options": ["The Crazies", "The Children of the Corn", "Camp Blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChild's Play.\n\n\tOver many decades (beginning in 1988), the story of Chucky the 'Good Guy Doll' has progressed to unbelievable results. Since his inception in the first \"Child's Play\" film, Chucky found a bride in actress Jennifer Tilly (named Tiffany, as per her doll in \"Bride of Chucky\") and he had an androgynous child named Glen (or Glenda, depending) in the 2004 film \"Seed of Chucky\".\rThe original \"Child's Play\" film was directed by Tom Holland, also known for the 1985 film, \"Fright Night\" and the adaptation of Stephen King's work, \"Thinner\", in 1996. The first film of the series revolved around the voodoo ritual performed by the escaped murderer, Charles Lee Ray, to put himself into a Good Guy Doll. In turn, the doll was purchased by the protagonist for her son, and they inevitably learned that it was possessed (in the worst way, of course).\rThe film was relatively well-received and grossed five times its budget in the box office making it quite the success. Subsequent 'Chucky' films were not so well-received, but were still popular in theaters. \n"}, {"text": "Which 2007 film, distributed under the After Dark Horrorfest name (but not actually a part of the '8 Films to Die For'), starred Elisha Cuthbert?", "correct": "Captivity", "options": ["Credo", "Crazy Eights", "The Cottage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptivity.\n\n\tAlthough the film was originally slated to be released as a bonus addition to the 2007 edition of After Dark Horrorfest's '8 Films to Die For', \"Captivity\" was scrapped and the film \"Crazy Eights\" was put into its place. 2007 was the second year of the Horrorfest. After Dark Films is run through Lionsgate Films, known for many significant horror releases after 2000 (including the \"Saw\" series).\r\"Captivity\" was about a famous model, Jennifer, who got captured by a kidnapper and thrown into a torture chamber. Over the course of the film, Jennifer needed to find a way to outsmart her captor and escape the confinement of the chamber.\rNotably, the film had a notoriously controversial ad campaign (including a billboard of Elisha Cuthbert suffocating) which scrapped a fair bit of the plans for the film's release. After its release, it was regarded as one of the worst films of the year for its overdoing of the 'torture porn' genre of horror. \n"}, {"text": "Set in New York, what J. J. Abrams-produced film was released in 2008?", "correct": "Cloverfield", "options": ["The Covenant", "Cronos", "The Craft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCloverfield.\n\n\tThe mystery of \"Cloverfield\" began many months before the movie was even released. An online viral marketing campaign (headed by the image of the Statue of Liberty with its head torn off) set the stage for one of the most popular horror films of 2008. Released in January of that year, the film became quite the popular hit despite the fact that many did not particularly enjoy the shaky-camera effects caused by the handheld cameras used for the entirety of the film's duration. This style of camera-work later appeared in the 2008 films \"Diary of the Dead\" and \"Quarantine\".\rThe film, set in New York, involved a gigantic, unknown monster that wreaked havoc upon the city. The main characters attempted to cross the city to save a friend, but discovered that the monster was only one of their major problems. J. J. Abrams, at the time of producing \"Cloverfield\", had also created the popular TV show, \"LOST\" and begun work on a film recreation of \"Star Trek\" for release the following year. \"Cloverfield\" grossed $170,000,000 at the box office. \n"}, {"text": "Brian de Palma directed the movie based on Stephen King's first novel. What was it called?", "correct": "Carrie", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarrie.\n\n\tReleased as a novel in 1974, Brian de Palma's theatrical adaptation of the novel was released two years later and quickly became one of the most widely-celebrated horror films of its time. Starring Sissy Spacek, the story involves a high school girl who was inevitably humiliated on her prom night. Little did her schoolmates know, however, that Carrie had psychic powers. When she was doused in pig's blood at the event, she killed the student body with telekinesis and proceeded to exact revenge.\rThe popularity of the film and book were both quite high, and the release of the original movie later spurred the development of a sequel (\"The Rage: Carrie 2\" in 1999) and a TV remake in 2002. Regardless, the film made over $100,000,000 worldwide and became one of King's more profitable movies. \n"}]}
