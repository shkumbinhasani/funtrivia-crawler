{"id": "406059", "name": "Spelling It Out - \"Resident Evil 3\" (PC) Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of the UBCS mercenary who is killed in the Raccoon City subway tunnels?", "correct": "Mikhail", "options": ["Tyrell", "Carlos", "Brad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMikhail.\n\n\tThe Captain of the Delta Platoon, Mikhail sacrifices himself to stop Nemesis and protect Jill at a moment when Nicholai turns tail and shows his true colours.  A seasoned veteran in sticky situations, he proves to be a born leader in a moment of crisis.  His sacrifice is a big help in the moment if only because it allows Jill to escape the subway.  That said, she doesn't have to go too far before Nemesis reemerges on her way to the Clock Tower. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these will open locked boxes in the RPD Building?", "correct": "ID Card", "options": ["Safety Deposit Key", "Lockpick", "Electronic Gadget"], "explanation": "\n\n\nID Card.\n\n\tBelonging to former S.T.A.R.S. member Brad Vickers, the ID Card is an item that only Carlos will obtain on his way into the Raccoon City Police Department.  Brad, turned into a zombie after falling to the foes early in the game, will be close to his old stomping ground at the entrance to the station and you'll have to pick the card off him to use it on item boxes and locked rooms in the RPD.  Most importantly, the card is going to be used to access the S.T.A.R.S. Office on the third floor of the building; it's there that Carlos will contact Dr. Bard. \n"}, {"text": "What game difficulty is unlocked when you win the game on Hardcore Mode?", "correct": "Nightmare", "options": ["Outbreak", "Inferno", "Hell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNightmare.\n\n\tNightmare difficulty, in which everything is not only tougher to kill, but you get less to kill with, isn't even the hardest difficulty to appear in the game; if you beat Nightmare, you can play the game in Inferno difficulty.  In Nightmare, you might also notice that items found throughout Raccoon City are in different places than they were in the normal difficulties.  In Inferno, the auto-save feature is turned off completely. \n"}, {"text": "Combining Explosive A with which of these will create a Flame Round?", "correct": "Explosive B", "options": ["High-Grade Gunpowder", "Explosive A", "Gunpowder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExplosive B.\n\n\tThere are a number of combination items that you can make if you stock up and search your environment for bits and bobs, and you can be assured that all of them will come in handy, especially since consumables like ammunition are in rare supply in the game.  Once you nab the Grenade Launcher you can use one of a handful of times of ammo, but you can also make your own common types with Explosives A and B, small components you can pair together in your inventory.  Two of A makes an Explosive Round; two of B makes an Acid Round; one of A and one of B makes a Flame Round. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these items will not have an effect when used on its own?", "correct": "Red Herb", "options": ["Green Herb", "First Aid Spray", "Combined Herb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed Herb.\n\n\tRed Herbs are the odd healing item out since they are used to enhance the capability of a Green Herb.  In earlier games in the series, these could also be used to enhance Blue Herbs for protective purposes, but in \"Nemesis\", your only choices are Green and Red.  Both can be combined together and then again with another Green Herb to create a Combined G+G+R healing item, one of the stronger ones in the game if you're not using your First Aid Sprays. \n"}, {"text": "What is Carlos' surname?", "correct": "Oliveira", "options": ["Kennedy", "Viktor", "Valentine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOliveira.\n\n\tA Corporal in the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (UBCS), Carlos is the second playable character in \"Resident Evil 3\" (after Jill) and he's facing a bit of a rough task in this game since he has to work in direct competition with a greedy saboteur, Nicholai, who's aiming to collect a vaccine and destroy it.  Carlos, who uses an Assault Rifle throughout the game, is in your control when you visit the Raccoon City Police Department and take your first round in Spencer Memorial Hospital. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the pharmaceutical corporation revealed to be making bioweapons?", "correct": "Umbrella", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nUmbrella.\n\n\tAs has been known since S.T.A.R.S. infiltrated the Spencer Mansion in the first \"Resident Evil\" game, the Umbrella Corporation has been causing all the problems in Raccoon City, and their influence can be seen the deeper you dive into the game.  The NEST 2 Labs in particular (and the warehouse and hospital above them) are rife with Umbrella logos and instruments.  Though Umbrella is known for pharmaceuticals, it's their technology in regeneration that allow them to experiment on living things and create bioweapons. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is the first name of vaccine creator, Dr. Bard?", "correct": "Nathaniel", "options": ["Nicholai", "Brian", "Leon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNathaniel.\n\n\tDr. Bard is Carlos' contact in Raccoon City and it's his aim to locate and protect the figure due to his importance in the outbreak.  Though Carlos and Tyrell will head to the Raccoon City Police Department searching for him, a computer terminal in the S.T.A.R.S. Office will allow Carlos to be pointed to the Spencer Memorial Hospital.  Unfortunately, Dr. Bard will have been shot and killed by Nicholai before Carlos can find the man, and it will mean needing to descend into the NEST 2 Lab to make the vaccine. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these monsters is only fought in the Raccoon City Power Substation?", "correct": "Drain Deimos", "options": ["Hunter (Beta)", "Pale Heads", "Hunter (Gamma)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrain Deimos.\n\n\tThese smaller foes are nasty and almost definitively going to hit you.  Made from odd insects that have drained infected blood from the zombies of Raccoon City, these spider-like creatures can poison Jill as she passes through the building searching for fuses.  Though other \"Resident Evil\" games contained Blue Herbs specifically for poison care, this one did not, so you can fix the toxins with a normal Green Herb instead.  Fortunately, these small creatures die with one shot.  Aim wisely and you shouldn't have a problem. \n"}, {"text": "If you take the first letter of the previous nine answers, you'll be able to spell the name of what item that you can use, but never create?", "correct": "MINE ROUND", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMINE ROUND.\n\n\tThough you can create Flame Rounds, Explosive Rounds, and Acid Rounds using Explosive components found throughout the game, Mine Rounds start to come into play around the time Jill faces off against Nemesis at the Clock Tower, and they're especially important because Nemesis has a tendency to climb along the sides of buildings.  Mine Rounds allow you to get the jump on foes, either by protecting you from their path or by allowing you to position yourself to avoid harm.  Since Mine Rounds can't be made, you have a very limited quantity. \n"}]}
