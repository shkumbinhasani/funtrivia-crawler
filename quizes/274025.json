What is her on-air nickname?", "correct": "Jungle Julia", "options": ["The Soul Sister", "Julia Jive", "The Radio Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJungle Julia.\n\n\tThe movie opens with Jungle Julia and her friends, Arlene and Shanna, as they get together for a day and night in Austin's bars.  When they drive to their first bar, Guerro's, they pass by several billboards erected to advertise Julia's radio show.  They also discuss Arlene's new boyfriend, their upcoming weekend at the lake together, and the fact that they want to score some marijuana. When the three of them stop along the way at a Mexican restaurant for lunch, Arlene notices a souped up, black Chevy Nova with a skull and crossbones on the hood slowly drive by.  Little do she and her friends know that the man inside has been following them for quite some time. \n"}, {"text": "On the radio, Julia told her listeners that she and her friends would be going clubbing.  One perk regarding this is the fact that she told everyone that her friend (who is actually Arlene) would give a lap dance to the first guy that called her which name?", "correct": "Butterfly", "options": ["Kitten", "Ladybug", "Swan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nButterfly.\n\n\tJulia eventually tells Arlene that she mentioned her on the air, but she ends up springing the surprise on her.  Arlene is told that she must voluntarily give a lap dance to the first guy who comes up to her, buys her a drink, and recites:\r \"The woods are lovely, dark and deep.\rBut I have promises to keep,\rAnd miles to go before I sleep,\rDid you hear me Butterfly?\rMiles to go before I sleep.\"\r She is angry that her friends set this up for her, but she is able to get out of the situation by simply telling anyone who asks that she already did the task at another bar. \n"}, {"text": "Does Stuntman Mike spend his night drinking alcohol in the bar and watching Julia, Arlene, and Shanna?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhen the group arrives at their final bar of the night, they meet 'the guys' for some drinks in the corner booth.  Julia runs off to text message her boyfriend, while Arlene stops outside for a smoke and notices the Chevy Nova parked beside the building.  Her boyfriend comes outside with an umbrella and they head to his car for a make-out session.\rWhile Julia has to wait for her drug connections, the girls sit back at the table with the guys and Arlene notices a blonde sitting at the bar.  The blonde, Pam, used to know Julia in school, and she ends up asking the barkeeper, Warren, to find someone to give her a ride home.  The first and only offer immediately comes from Stuntman Mike, who has been sitting at the bar eating nachos and drinking club soda with lime.  Pam asks if he'll be alright to drive home and he says he doesn't need to drink at a bar to have a good time. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Arlene end up giving her lap dance to?", "correct": "Stuntman Mike", "options": ["No one.  She tells every guy that recites the poem that she has already done it.", "Her boyfriend", "No one.  She doesn't get any offers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nStuntman Mike.\n\n\tStuntman Mike ends up buying a beer for both Arlene and Jungle Julia and surprising them with the poem.  Julia quickly stands up for her friend (realizing it was a stupid thing to do) and tells him that she has already given the lap dance to someone at another bar, but Mike says that she's lying.  He asks Arlene why she's so afraid of him, and she says that it's his car.  He quickly charms her over though, and exposes her bruised ego since she never had any guys recite the poem for her, and she heads into the bar to give Mike his lap dance.\rUnfortunately, the theatrical version of the film is missing the entire scene, and the audience is quickly taken to the scene where everyone is leaving the bar. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first to be killed by Stuntman Mike?", "correct": "Pam", "options": ["Julia", "Arlene", "Shanna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPam.\n\n\tWhen everyone leaves the bar, Stuntman Mike shows Pam to his car.  Although she is nervous that it may be dangerous, he assures her that the entire machine is 'death proof', since it was made to withstand stunts and crashes.  She finally accepts the reassurance and hops into the empty passenger seat, which is little more than a metal seat surrounded by reinforced steel bars.  As they head out of the parking lot, Stuntman Mike asks which way she needs to go to get home.  When she says 'right', he is disappointed, as she'll soon catch on to the fact that they won't be going in the right direction.  He quickly speeds up, spins the car, and slams the brakes, killing her when she impacts with the windshield.  Of course, he isn't harmed- the driver's seat is the only 'death proof' part of the car.  He speeds in the direction that Jungle Julia and her group went and passes them on the way.\rUnfortunately, everyone in Jungle Julia's car (driven by her dealer, Lanna Frank) is hammered.  They don't even notice when Stuntman Mike spins around up ahead, turns off his headlights, and crashes into their car head-on.  All four girls inside are brutally murdered. \n"}, {"text": "Following the accident, Stuntman Mike is sent to the hospital for a broken leg.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tFollowing the horrific accident, Stuntman Mike was sent to the hospital for breaking a few bones and smashing up a finger.  The local police are shocked by this, and one ranger is sticking with the idea that Mike is guilty of the crime.  Unfortunately, the charges against him are cleared since everybody in Julia's car had been intoxicated while driving, and Mike had not touched a drop of alcohol at the bar.  He had been drinking club soda and virgin pina coladas instead.  The ranger figures that Stuntman Mike finds some sort of sexual pleasure from the ordeal.\rWhen Stuntman Mike is released from the hospital, he ends up in Tennessee just over a year later stalking another group of girls. \n"}, {"text": "What magazine is Lee featured in?", "correct": "Allure", "options": ["Glamour", "Cosmopolitan", "Playboy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAllure.\n\n\tStuntman Mike's next set of girls are in Lebanon, Tennessee, and they have their first encounter with him outside a convenience store.  While Kim goes into the store for coffee and Red Bull, Abernathy sleeps with her feet out the window and Lee listens to her iPod.  Stuntman Mike ends up sexually assaulting her (without her knowing) and he quickly drives off, watching the girls the entire time.  When Abernathy goes into the store, she finds a magazine with Lee's picture inside and decides to purchase it.  Lee is starring in a film nearby, while Abernathy and Kim are members of the crew.\rAfter leaving the store, they rush off to the airport to pick up their friend, stuntwoman Zoe Bell.  They don't realize, however, that Stuntman Mike is there as well, taking pictures of the group of them. \n"}, {"text": "What type of car does Zoe find for her Ship's Mast stunt?", "correct": "Dodge Challenger", "options": ["Chevy Nova", "Dodge Charger", "Pontiac Firebird Trans Am"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDodge Challenger.\n\n\tAfter picking Zoe up from the airport, the girls head out for lunch discussing their recent flings, the movie they're working in, past stories, and the fact that Kim always carries a gun.  Zoe soon brings up the fact that the one thing that she wanted to do when she travelled to America was get a muscle car, specifically a 1970 Dodge Challenger with a four-cylinder engine, and ride around in it to fulfill her dream. Luckily, she found one nearby.  When she knew she was flying over, she did some research and found a car similar to the one from the movie \"Vanishing Point\".  The girls decide to finish their meal and head directly to the farm where it's being held to take it for a 'test drive'. \n"}, {"text": "Who is forced to stay behind while Zoe takes the car out for a 'test drive'?", "correct": "Lee", "options": ["Kim", "Abernathy", "No one"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLee.\n\n\tZoe talks to Kim about taking the car for a single ride in order to perform a stunt called the Ship's Mast, which they vowed they'd never do again after they did it in New Zealand.  Kim finally gives in and decides to go along with it, but they need to con the owner into letting them drive the car in the first place.  Abernathy realizes that they want to take the car without her, so she makes a deal that if she can get them the test drive, that she can come along with them.  She ends up insinuating that Lee will sexually pleasure the man in exchange for a short test drive, and they head on their way, leaving Lee asleep and unknowing by the barn.\rWhile on the road, Zoe straps two belts to the hood of the car, hangs on, and lets Kim speed away down the road while she holds tight. \n"}, {"text": "After crashing the car, what does Zoe use to attack Stuntman Mike?", "correct": "A pipe", "options": ["A knife", "A gun", "A bat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pipe.\n\n\tWhile Zoe is on the hood of the Challenger, Stuntman Mike catches up to them and begins ramming the car on all ends.  Zoe is nearly killed many times in the process while Kim struggles to keep the car stable on the road and Abernathy watches in fear from the back seat.  Kim soon remembers her gun and shoots Stuntman Mike in the arm before they drive to the edge of the road.  Stuntman Mike flees and Zoe is thrown off the hood of the car into the brush.  She survives and the girls hop back into the car to pursue their attacker and bring him to justice in revenge.\rMike parks his car down a country road and tends to his wound, exposing his true self.  When the girls find him, he drives off once again, but he forgets to put on his seatbelt and he is injured as they crash into him numerous times.  They deal one final blow to his Charger and pull him out of the car, beating him to death and getting their just revenge. \n"}]}
