{"id": "397595", "name": "10 Thor: Ragnarok Questions |   Movies Trivia Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Thor"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of the demon who seeks the Eternal Flame?", "correct": "Surtur", "options": ["Ragnarok", "Ares", "Fafnir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSurtur.\n\n\tThor, chained and caged in another realm, is brought before the demon Surtur, who believes that prophecy will lead him to destroy Asgard and bring forth the Ragnarok.  All Surtur needs to do is use the Eternal Flame to regain his strength, and when he does, he can bring down Thor and his people.  Since neither Thor nor his father, Odin, is in Asgard on the throne, it's the opportunity Surtur needs. Thor, calling upon Mjolnir, breaks free of his bindings and fights Surtur's underlings before knocking off his foe's crown and calling on Heimdall for the Bifrost.  Unfortunately, Heimdall isn't there, but Skurge eventually gets the message and pulls him back.\n"}, {"text": "Who, upon Thor's return to Earth, requests a visit?", "correct": "Dr. Stephen Strange", "options": ["Tony Stark", "Dr. Bruce Banner", "Nick Fury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Stephen Strange\n\n\tThor arrives back in Asgard in time to watch a play chronicling Loki's last moments, back when he was attacked and supposedly killed on Svartalfheim.  The truth is, however, that Loki posed as Odin and took the throne instead, faking his death to ascend and rule Asgard without anyone knowing.  When Thor makes it in time to watch the end of the play, he instantly knows that Loki is in disguise, and he forces his brother's hand, revealing his trick to the people around them.  It's because of this that he forces Loki to join him in heading to Midgar to locate their father.\rBut to find Odin, they need to go to New York City, where Loki seems to have left Odin in an old age home.  He's not there, and when they investigate, Loki is pulled through a portal, leaving Thor to head to Bleecker Street to meet with Dr. Stephen Strange.  Strange, as it seems, pulled Loki into the portal to protect the planet from Loki, one of the people on his watch list.  Strange does let him know, however, that Odin headed elsewhere, believing himself to be in exile.  He kindly sends the brothers exactly where they need to be. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Thor and Loki find Odin?", "correct": "Norway", "options": ["New York City", "Iceland", "Los Angeles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorway.\n\n\tSure enough, heading through Strange's portal, Thor and Loki find Odin waiting on the edge of a cliff.  Clearly aged, Odin says that he has been waiting for them, but there's not much time.  He doesn't have long, he claims, as Ragnarok is yet to occur and will happen upon his imminent death.  The goddess of death, Hela, who was his firstborn daughter, was locked away many years ago, and when he dies, she will be freed.  Her strength, pulled from Asgard, will make her too powerful to defeat and, unfortunately, Thor and Loki will need to face her alone.  And with that, Odin vanishes into the ether while his sons look on.\rAlmost immediately, the sky darkens and a dark portal appears on the horizon.  From this, Hela emerges and introduces herself to the duo, urging them to kneel before their queen.  Thor throws Mjolnir at her, but she grabs the hammer from the air and uses her strength to shatter it before their very eyes.  Loki calls upon the Bifrost to bring them back, but this allows Hela to shoot through to Asgard, and on the way she throws Loki and Thor out into space, scattering them separately across the realm. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the trash heap planet where Thor and Loki end up being cast?", "correct": "Sakaar", "options": ["J\u00f6tunheim", "Xandar", "Vormir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSakaar.\n\n\tHela emerges in Asgard to find the Warriors Three guarding the Bifrost and the city and though they immediately take up their weapons, she defeats them handily.  Skurge, who kneels before her, is immediately given a job as her servant.  It doesn't take long before Hela stands before the people of the city and asks them to kneel as well so that they can lead a conquest to take over all of the realms.  They don't, and what follows is a huge battle-- Hela against the army-- in which she emerges victorious and virtually unscathed.\rElsewhere in the cosmos, Thor is dropped on a planet loaded with heaped trash, Sakaar.  There, a robotic craft settles before him and the people inside emerge to take him as food.  Fortunately, since he can fight, he's instead taken in by Scrapper 142, subdued by foreign tech, and brought in to her boss, a man known only as The Grandmaster, who lords over the planet. \n"}, {"text": "Hela uses which of these items to create her army?", "correct": "The Eternal Flame", "options": ["Surtur's helmet", "The Tesseract", "Loki's staff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Eternal Flame.\n\n\tBrought before the Grandmaster on Sakaar, Thor very quickly comes to realize that he is going to be a part of what the planet's people call the Contest of Champions.  He breaks free of his bindings, but Scrapper 142 still has complete control and he's subdued further, being taken by the Grandmaster to a party and introduced as a contender.  Thor finds Loki there, discovering that time has worked differently since his arrival; Loki had spent weeks there already, becoming trusted by its citizens.  Thor, however, needs to prove himself.  If he can best the Grandmaster's greatest champion, he can go free and return to Asgard.  The catch is that everyone who's faced the greatest champion has perished.\rOn Asgard, Hela recommences her reign.  With most of Asgardian's warriors having fallen against her, she heads into the vault and grabs the Eternal Flame, descending into the crypts and using the artifact to awaken an army of soldiers including her great wolf, Fenris. \n"}, {"text": "Which other Avenger is part of the Contest of Champions?", "correct": "The Incredible Hulk", "options": ["Iron Man", "Captain America", "Black Widow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Incredible Hulk.\n\n\tThor is brought to the Contest of Champions and prepared for battle, and it's there that he discovers that Scrapper 142 is from Asgard.  In fact, based on her tattoos, he realizes that she was once a Valkyrie.  He tries to convince her to help him for the good of Asgard, but he's instead pulled to the arena as part of the Contest's main match.  And when he steps into the centre of the battleground, his opponent is introduced as none other than The Incredible Hulk, Dr. David Banner himself, who disappeared after the events in Sokovia when the Avengers faced off against Ultron.  Hulk insists on battle, and soon the two Avengers go head-to-head in a dangerous fight that shocks the crowd and the Grandmaster.  Thor tries to appeal to his old friend but has to use his powers to ensure he isn't killed.  When Thor uses his lightning powers, however, the Grandmaster steps in, sabotaging Thor to put an end to it.\rBack in Asgard, Hela makes Skurge her new executioner, much like Odin made her long ago.  When the two of them head to the Bifrost to begin their conquest they find that the sword used to control it has been taken.  They don't know that the person responsible is none other than Heimdall, who's been absconding with frightened citizens and hiding them outside of the city. \n"}, {"text": "Scrapper 142 is one of the only surviving Valkyries.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThor awakens in comfortable chambers despite his apparent loss in the arena and, as it turns out, he's been shacked up with the Hulk.  The two argue about what they should do, and while Thor knows he needs to get back to Asgard to prevent Ragnarok, the Hulk insists on staying.  The matter becomes urgent for the former, especially since Heimdall communicates with him and insists upon his return, and the possibility floats since the Hulk arrived on the Quinjet from Earth.  They are, however, trapped.\rThor and Hulk manage to convince Scrapper 142 to hear out Thor's plan to stop Hela though it's clear that she has her concerns, especially since the Valkyries were called in to stop her the first time, failing to do so.  During their conversation, Thor manages to free himself from her security device before leaving out the window and rushing down to the Quinjet, but when he arrives it takes a while for him to activate the controls.  It takes long enough, in fact, that the Hulk arrives and starts destroying the ship, only stopping when a recording from Natasha Romanoff begins to play, triggering Hulk's memories and allowing him to transform back into Dr. Banner for the first time in two years. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these, according to Loki, is the only way back to Asgard?", "correct": "Going through a wormhole", "options": ["Using the power of the Bifrost", "Via teleportation", "By foot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoing through a wormhole.\n\n\tThe people of Sakaar are called upon to hunt down Hulk and Thor and both Loki and Scrapper 142 lead the charge.  The two face off against one another before heading out and it's during this time that Loki forces 142 to relive the moment Hela killed all of the other Valkyries in combat, leaving her as one of the only survivors. 142 ultimately finds Thor and Banner as they try to make their way through a massive parade celebrating the Hulk, inevitably revealing that she subdued Loki and tied him up in her lodgings.  It's there that all four of them agree that they need a ship to leave out the planet's largest wormhole, a passage known locally as 'The Devil's Anus', and Loki actually has just the thing-- one of the Grandmaster's ships. He asks for safe passage and they all agree that this may be their best option.  Thor decides to let Loki play his part, but first they must start a revolution. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the ship used to help Thor and others escape back to Asgard?", "correct": "The Commodore", "options": ["The Milano", "The Grandmaster", "The Quinjet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Commodore.\n\n\tThe Grandmaster receives word that his slaves have been armed and freed and soon, Sakaar is in the throes of revolution.  Thor and Loki head into the Grandmaster's hangars, meanwhile, armed with alien guns, and all the while they talk about their relationship.  Oddly, both brothers believe that Loki should stay back on Sakaar; it's the perfect place for him to flourish. Go figure though, Loki puts quick effort into betraying Thor reaching the ships, but Thor ends up catching wise early on, planting a slavery disc onto his back and leaving alone.  He reunites with 142 and Banner during a high-adrenaline escape on the Grandmaster's pleasure craft, the Commodore, and they fight off the Grandmaster's pilots before heading off the planet. The revolutionaries, meanwhile, give Loki a bit of a hand on their way out. \n"}, {"text": "What does Thor decide must be done to stop Hela?", "correct": "Asgard must be destroyed", "options": ["He must give up his powers", "He must sacrifice his life", "Mjolnir must be destroyed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsgard must be destroyed.\n\n\tThor, 142, and Banner return to Asgard just as Hela and Skurge flush out Heimdall to reclaim the Bifrost sword.  Thor splits up from the other two in an attempt to locate Hela who, out in the mountains, locates Heimdall and the hidden Asgardians fleeing their safe haven.  She only leaves their trail when Thor summons her from the throne, giving the last opportunity for the citizens to take the Bifrost Bridge to safety.  Unfortunately, the great wolf, Fenris, and Skurge's forces flank them on the bridge, only avoiding fighting the untrained people of Asgard when 142 and Banner swoop in with firepower.  Banner, realizing that Fenris won't die with their ship, leaps from the Commodore and transforms into the Hulk, morphing when he lands on the Bifrost Bridge and taking Hela's beast down into the water.  At the same time, when the fight seems lost, Loki arrives with the revolutionaries, landing on the bridge to provide support.\rIn the throne room, Hela gets the upper hand against Thor because of her immense strength and she manages to bring him to his knees, swinging with her sword and removing one of his eyes.  As she takes him into her grasp, Thor has a vision of Odin's spirit, still in Norway, and he receives the insight he needs: Asgard could be anywhere.  Even if Hela has taken it, then it's wherever the Asgardians are.  Only Ragnarok can stop Hela.\rWith a massive bolt of lightning, Thor is empowered.  He casts Hela away and uses his electricity to battle her army alongside 142 and Loki.  Thor, knowing he has to stop Hela once and for all, asks his brother to help him destroy the city.  While the Asgardians flee and he sends Loki into the vault to grab Surtur's Crown, Thor and 142 battle the Goddess of Death on the bridge and, sure enough, his plan works.  Surtur is reborn in the Eternal Flame and Asgard is almost instantly destroyed.  The prophecy of Ragnarok is fulfilled.\rThor saves his people from extinction while Hela perishes with Asgard.  As they fly off into the cosmos, Thor thanks Loki for his efforts.  There, in their spacecraft, Thor takes the throne before his people as the King and they head to Earth. \n"}]}
