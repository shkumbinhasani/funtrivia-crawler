The only girl he wants is Lauren.  In class, he recalls their supposed seven minutes in heaven, promised to Lauren because she joined New Directions for Sectionals, and notes that they only spent three minutes in the janitor's closet because she thought he was scrawny and a bad kisser.  After class, Lauren criticizes Puck's choice in Valentine's Day chocolates and tells him to stop staring at her.  When she leaves, he says he can't help it because he loves her.\rFinn, meanwhile, is receiving a lot of attention from the girls at school because he led the football team to victory.  The only girl he wants though, is Quinn. \n"}, {"text": "Finn, in an attempt to earn money for the Glee Club, suggests that he start which of these money-raising schemes?", "correct": "A kissing booth", "options": ["A fashion show", "A bake sale", "An open-mic night"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA kissing booth.\n\n\tBlaine and Kurt discuss Valentine's Day while at the coffee shop.  To Kurt's surprise, Blaine wants to go all-out and sing a song for the guy he's been falling for.  Kurt believes that he's this particular guy when Blaine orders his coffee and picks up the bill.\rIn the choir room, Will has the kids celebrate 'love' as their theme for the week.  Their job: to pick a partner and perform what they think is the world's greatest love song.  Finn stands up after the talk and has his own chat about his football win being the catalyst for the good vibes that New Directions has been receiving (ie. no Slushies all week).  As a result, he wants to start a kissing booth in the school at $1 per kiss to raise money for the club.  The girls feel that he just wants to kiss everyone in the school. \n"}, {"text": "The guy Blaine likes is a junior manager at what store?", "correct": "GAP", "options": ["American Apparel", "H&M", "Abercrombie & Fitch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGAP.\n\n\tWhen Santana starts making fun of Finn for his idea, she claims that she's just keeping it real.  This doesn't go over well with the others who feel that her constant insulting is cruel.  Rachel strikes the final blow before Santana leaves to cry in the hall.  As it turns out, she can dish it, but she can't take it.\rPuck speaks with Lauren after the meeting and she thanks him for sticking up for her in the choir room; he says he didn't need to because she's so tough and he asks her to a Valentine's Day dinner at Breadstix, but she says it won't be that easy.\rAt Dalton Academy, Blaine says that the Warblers have been called to an emergency meeting; when they gather, he asks the Warblers to help him perform a song because he's in love.  To do this, they need to perform off-campus, a suggestion that they don't take too lightly because of a previous incident.  Kurt, using examples from New Directions, suggests that performing off-campus will give them confidence.  When Blaine reveals that the guy is a junior manager at a GAP store in the mall, Kurt is surprised and disappointed. \n"}, {"text": "To express his love for Lauren, Puck sings a song by what rock band?", "correct": "Queen", "options": ["Boston", "The Eagles", "Journey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen.\n\n\tKurt has a girl's night with Rachel and Mercedes and they all discuss the surprising turn of events.  They sympathize with Kurt although it's clear he could've made the whole flirting thing up in his head.  Rachel says that she's got a plan for herself as well-- she'll head to Finn's kissing booth, place a $100 down, and force him to kiss her when he can't make change.  Mercedes criticizes them both; the reason she's fine is because a number of divas didn't need relationships because they channeled their loneliness into song and focused on their talent.  All three of them can fly solo for a while to regain their footing.\rIn the choir room, Puck decides to serenade Lauren to win her affection.  How?  He sings Queen's \"Fat Bottomed Girls\".  Will and the girls are a bit surprised by the song choice but the guys support him.  When everyone leaves, Lauren says that it was the first time anyone ever sang her a love song, but it made her feel like crap. \n"}, {"text": "What is the Christmas present Finn bought for Rachel?", "correct": "A necklace", "options": ["A CD", "Tickets to a Broadway show", "A hairbrush"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA necklace.\n\n\tThe kissing booth is set up quite soon after and Finn starts taking donations from the girls of the school.  When he closes down for a break, Quinn stops by and says that she knows why he's doing it; it's to get her to cave in to peer pressure and kiss him again.  He argues that sooner or later she'll do it.\rSam sees this conversation and approaches Quinn in the library saying that something is fishy about it all.  Their argument leads Quinn to the decision that she will kiss Finn.\rRachel gives the dollar for her kiss and Finn concedes to giving her a peck on the cheek.  This frustrates Rachel and she finally lets it slip that she still loves him.

(Pretty Young Thing)\" by Michael Jackson and their dance takes them into the next Glee Club meeting.\rSantana tells Puck that she bought him a gift to give her and that he can reimburse her for the cost over dinner at Breadstix.  She apologizes for her attitude before insulting Lauren, and Lauren overhears her.  Santana starts to stand up for herself before Lauren starts fighting, tossing her against the lockers.  Beiste is forced to drag Santana to the nurse and puck begs her to go out with him.

Kurt convinces him to stay and the Warblers assist Blaine in a rendition of Robin Thicke's \"When I Get You Alone\".  The song proves to be a difficult one to sing, especially since Blaine stalks Jeremiah around the store.  Kurt looks longingly at Blaine in the meantime.\rWhen Jeremiah's shift at work ends, it turns out he got fired.  In addition, he hasn't come out yet, so Blaine's to blame for that.  Even if they were to go out, Blaine's underage.  Jeremiah asks him to step back a bit.\rIn the choir room at McKinley, Santana watches the happy couples in disappointment and realizes that there's something going on between Quinn and Finn by their facial expressions.  She deduces that they're cheating and she decides to take action, specifically by way of revenge.  Donning a candy-striper outfit, she heads to the nurse's office and kisses a student sick with mono before kissing Finn on the lips. \n"}, {"text": "What does Puck offer to Lauren to convince her to say yes to a Valentine's dinner?", "correct": "A Ring Pop", "options": ["A Cadbury Creme Egg", "A Marshmallow Peep", "A box of cinnamon hearts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Ring Pop.\n\n\tIn the library (a place Puck has never been), Lauren criticizes Puck's approach to securing a date, particularly because there seems to be no envelopes of cash or muffin baskets lying around; she also notes the offensive love song.  To appeal to her, he decides to get down on one knee and propose to dinner at Breadstix using a Ring Pop.  In fact, the dinner is just a pre-date because he has more plans for the actual Valentine's Day event.  She accepts.\rIn the auditorium, Quinn meets up with Finn for another kiss.  Quinn says that it's hypocritical for Finn to consider making her cheat, but Quinn is also at fault because she's so close to Sam.  They embrace because Quinn says she needs to know one way or another. \n"}, {"text": "When it comes time for Lauren and Puck's date, she stands him up.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tBlaine has time to think about what he's done and he soon comes to despise Valentine's Day; Kurt notices the shift he's taken since the failed love song.  Like Kurt, though, he made it all up in his head.  Kurt decides to come clean-- he says that he thought Blaine wanted to sing to him on Valentine's Day because of how close they are.  Blaine says that he's clueless and he doesn't know what he's doing.  He's never been a boyfriend, just like Kurt.  He really cares about Kurt but he's not good at romance and doesn't want to screw it up.  They order their coffee before Kurt realizes that they have a plan for Valentine's Day.\rAt Breadstix, Puck gets stood up by Lauren.  He makes out with a waitress to take the sting off.\rIn the choir room, a clearly-ill Finn announces that he raised $300, enough for half a ticket to Nationals.  Everyone notices his sickness; Quinn seems ill too.  Will also announces that Tina's the next to perform and she rises to begin a rendition of \"My Funny Valentine\" for Mike.  She doesn't get very far before breaking into tears, though.  She claims it's only because she's never been so happy and that every day is Valentine's with Mike.  Will notes that it was a 'powerful rendition'.\rWhen Tina's performance ends, both Finn and Quinn ask to be excused because they're feeling horrible.  Santana takes this opportunity to reveal that they have mono before they leave.  In the nurse's station, Quinn complains that every time she cheats, something bad happens-- the first time it was pregnancy, this time it's mono.  She says that she can't be with Finn, at least not until she decides what to do about her and Sam. \n"}, {"text": "On Valentine's Day, which New Directions member is left without a date?", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Tina", "Brittany", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tIn the hall, Puck speaks to Lauren about her ditching their date.  He says he didn't appreciate it, but he likes that she's a strong, independent woman.  She says that they'll need to take it slow, though.\rIn the nurse's office, Rachel tends to Finn and she keeps mentioning that Quinn is prettier than her.  He admits to kissing Quinn and when she asks what it felt like, he says it felt like fireworks.  He doesn't answer when she asks about her own kiss.  She leaves because she finally found the strength to move on and because she found a song choice for this week: \"Firework\" by Katy Perry.  She directs her love song at Finn even though she knows it won't be returned.  The other girls join in in the choir room.\rAt Breadstix, Rachel meets up with Mercedes, Mike, and Tina to watch the Warblers perform \"Silly Love Songs\" by Wings.  While Lauren and Puck sit together and Artie and Tina nuzzle one another, Santana listens alone and looks back at a lonely Sam sitting by himself-- they exchange a smile. \n"}]}
