Then NBC threatened to cancel the program, and horrified fans launched a bold letter-writing campaign. What show was thus saved for a third season?", "correct": "Star Trek", "options": ["Stargate Universe", "Battlestar Galactica", "Caprica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Trek.\n\n\t\"Star Trek\" - there was no need to call it \"The Original Series\" before its spin-offs,  starting with \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" arrived on the scene - began airing on NBC in 1966. Its ratings were never fantastic, but its fans truly loved its view of an optimistic future - one where competent bridge officers of all human races, and one alien race, worked together - and its careful allegorical treatment of contemporary issues.When it was threatened with cancellation, more than a hundred thousand letters arrived at NBC studios (along with a few hundred student marchers). We cannot know whether the network was more impressed by the numbers or by the favorable demographics of the letter-writers, who tended to be well educated and well off, but the end result was a third season for \"Star Trek.\" Unfortunately, the happy ending didn't last: the show's next gifts from the studio were a terrible time slot and a significant budget cut, and the cancellation after Season Three was final.In movies, TV spinoffs, books, and geek culture, however, the original Trekkies lived on. \n"}, {"text": "High school is famously hard on many -- most? -- of its students, but it's also a surprisingly tough environment for television shows. One such smartly written, unsentimental show won a devoted following that wasn't quite large enough, even though the series featured future stars Claire Danes and Jared Leto. Name this show, which was canceled after its first season.", "correct": "My So-Called Life", "options": ["Freaks and Geeks", "Saved by the Bell", "Joan of Arcadia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy So-Called Life.\n\n\tWith Danes in the lead as 15-year-old Angela Chase, \"My So-Called Life\" delved deep into the high-school experience. Its characters faced real problems -- from drugs to abuse -- that evolved over multiple episodes, instead of being introduced, solved, and forgotten in a single \"after-school special.\" The numbers weren't large enough, though, and Danes's schoolwork and budding movie career added complications. Despite fan letters and fan-sponsored magazine ads, ABC canceled the show in 1995 rather than ordering a second season. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a mystery show that followed a high-school student whose world fell apart after the murder of her best friend; she spent the first season privately solving one mystery after another, all the while chasing her friend's elusive killer. Later seasons brought new mysteries, but cancellation came after season three. Which show was this?", "correct": "Veronica Mars", "options": ["Twin Peaks", "Angel", "The Closer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVeronica Mars.\n\n\tHeartbroken fans sent network executives thousands of Mars bars, candies chosen as a homage to the character played by Kristen Bell in the UPN/CW series from 2004 to 2007. Beloved for its transplantation of film-noir tropes to a high-school setting in Neptune, California, \"Veronica Mars\" nonetheless failed to capture a broad enough crowd to survive, and vague plans for a movie didn't pan out either. \n"}, {"text": "The title character of this spy comedy went on a mission every week, using the computer in his brain - along with his own wit and charm - to save the world with his CIA and NSA handlers in tow. And when the show was in danger of cancellation, fans went on a mission too: they bought large quantities of food from one of the show's main sponsors, the sandwich chain Subway. Which of these shows did fans save in 2009, ensuring three more seasons of fun at the Buy More?", "correct": "Chuck", "options": ["Spy Vs Spy", "Burn Notice", "La Femme Nikita"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChuck.\n\n\tThis wasn't the first fan campaign to involve food: mailing symbolic items to the studio is an old standby. The target, though, was new: \"Chuck\" fans made their most direct expression of loyalty not to the characters, nor to the writers or showrunners, but to a deep-pocketed advertiser. The tactic worked, although it did slightly change the tenor of the show: supporting characters began to make surprisingly blatant in-show pitches for Subway sandwiches, playing the situation for camp.\r Running from 2007 to 2012, \"Chuck\" followed an ordinary employee at a big-box electronics store (the Buy More) as he suddenly became entangled in the intrigue of the spy world. The initial premise was absurd; the follow-through was usually great fun. \n"}, {"text": "If the end of a favorite TV show can seem like the end of the world, then the end of a show ABOUT the end of the world must be even worse. This show began with the detonation of nuclear bombs in 23 US cities, following life in a small Kansas town with a closer connection to the catastrophe than one might expect. Fans persuaded CBS to give it a second season, but what show then got the axe?", "correct": "Jericho", "options": ["Eureka", "Revolution", "The Big Bang Theory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJericho.\n\n\tThe name of the show comes from the name of the town, whose stunned, struggling residents include one with ties to the bombings. In the first season, the people of Jericho worked to regain their footing, only to face war with the neighboring town of New Bern. In the season's cliffhanger finale, one major character's defiant declaration \"Nuts!\" shaped fans' campaigns to save the show. Loyal viewers sent some 20 tons of nuts to network executives, who donated the food to charity and then signed off on a second season.\r Sadly, ratings continued to fall, and no rescue came after the season two cliffhanger in 2008. The story continues, however, in comic books. \n"}, {"text": "Many high-school shows are successful; the setting is a wonderful vehicle for low-stakes but high-drama conflicts. This particular high-school comedy-drama was not successful, however. The problem can't have been the acting, since series regulars like Seth Rogen, James Franco and Linda Cardellini went on to great careers, but for whatever reason this NBC show was canceled in 2000, partway through its first season. What was this show, set in the 1980s?", "correct": "Freaks and Geeks", "options": ["Glee", "Veronica Mars", "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreaks and Geeks.\n\n\tMaybe the problem was the fact that the main characters of this show are, well, freaks and geeks; they're far outside the golden high-school in-crowd. In its short life, however, this smartly written show won an Emmy award (for casting), picked up nominations for a range of other awards, and attracted a devoted following that just wasn't quite large enough.The show was canceled after twelve episodes aired, with six more in the can. Fans did have a measure of success in trying to save the show: they talked NBC into airing three of the remaining episodes, but the rest had to wait for syndication that fall.The depth of their devotion may be seen in the release of an eight-disk deluxe DVD set (for only eighteen episodes!) in 2008. \n"}, {"text": "On a ship called Serenity (and a network called Fox), a motley mix of smugglers, fugitives, and more respectable hangers-on traveled the edges of the galactic Alliance. Although their voyages lasted just half a season, fans refused to let go. What show do \"Browncoats\" lovingly remember?", "correct": "Firefly", "options": ["Battlestar Galactica", "Star Trek", "Dollhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFirefly.\n\n\tOnly 14 episodes of \"Firefly\" - a name taken from the make of the ship - were ever produced, and only 11 of them aired on Fox in 2002. Fans knew the warm, quirky Joss Whedon show was in trouble from the beginning and struggled to save it, even taking out a full-page ad in \"Variety\" - but to no avail. Strong DVD sales, though, earned the show an epilogue in the form of the 2005 movie \"Serenity.\" \n"}, {"text": "This 1990s show, set in a small town in Washington state, centered around the terrible murder of Laura Palmer - but its ratings went sour after the murderer was revealed. Which show limped through the end of its second season, thanks to its fans' efforts, but never saw a season three?", "correct": "Twin Peaks", "options": ["Glee", "Veronica Mars", "Matlock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwin Peaks.\n\n\t\"Twin Peaks\" aired on ABC in 1990 and 1991. The show began as an FBI agent named Dale Cooper came to investigate the murder, and he was soon drawn into a tight and disturbing web. Many things were rotten in the town of Twin Peaks, from demonic possession to more ordinary vices. Sadly, the ratings were rotten, too, and they fell off a cliff after the mid-second-season revelation of Laura's murderer. \r Banding together as COOP (Citizens Opposed to the Offing of Peaks),  fans made a concerted effort to save the show. They wrote letters to network executives and held rallies to get press attention, evoking elements from the show: eye patches, owls, and even plastic-wrap garments. (One of the show's iconic images was of Palmer's body as it was discovered, garbed only in plastic wrap.) Ultimately, however, the continued adventures of the town's memorable characters were not enough to renew interest; despite the mobilization of COOP there was no third season to resolve the cliffhanger at the end of the second. \n"}, {"text": "Fans of this show should have expected the loss: after all, the whole sitcom centered on what happened to the Bluth family after their patriarch George Senior went to prison and the family lost their incredible wealth. Which show took absurdist dysfunction to new levels for three seasons on Fox?", "correct": "Arrested Development", "options": ["Glee", "Futurama", "Dollhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArrested Development.\n\n\tThe Bluth response to their fall from grace ranged from functional (son Michael and his son George Michael) to wholly bizarre (just about everybody else), with hilarious results. Fans were disappointed by its cancellation after three seasons, but despite a letter-writing campaign, critical acclaim, and six Emmy awards, they were unable to prevent its end in 2006. Hope returned in 2012, however, when video-rental and streaming giant Netflix picked up rights to the series and commissioned a fourth season with the full original cast. \n"}, {"text": "Many sitcoms have bizarre premises, but this one may take the cake. On New Year's 2000, a New York pizza deliveryman accidentally cryogenically froze himself, and woke up a thousand years later to the wholly changed city of New New York. He befriended a robot, got a job with an interplanetary delivery company owned by his great-great-etc-nephew, and fell in unrequited love with a cyclopean coworker. Which of these animated shows suffered a nearly five-year hiatus after its fourth season?", "correct": "Futurama", "options": ["Aqua Teen Hunger Force", "The Simpsons", "Family Guy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFuturama.\n\n\t\"Futurama,\" developed by David X. Cohen and \"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening, developed a cult following in its initial run on Fox from 1999 to 2003. Nevertheless, after some confusing scheduling snafus, the show was dropped after four seasons. Yet, unusually, it achieved a second life: Comedy Central, which had started syndicating \"Futurama,\" decided first to commission a few direct-to-DVD movies, and then to start ordering new episodes.Delivery man Philip J. Fry (Billy West), ship captain Turanga Leela (Katey Sagal), and curmudgeonly robot Bender (John DiMaggio) returned for a fifth season in 2008, and \"Futurama\" fans at last let out their breath. \n"}]}
