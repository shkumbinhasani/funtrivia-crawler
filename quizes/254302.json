{"id": "254302", "name": "'King of the Hill' - The Souphanousinphones Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "King Of The Hill", "'King Of The Hill' - Characters and Actors"], "questions": [{"text": "The Souphanousinphones live right next door to the Hills in 'King of the Hill', but they haven't always lived there.  What is the home country of both Kahn and his wife Minh?", "correct": "Laos", "options": ["South Korea", "Malaysia", "The Philippines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaos.\n\n\tLaos, a small landlocked country between Thailand and Vietnam (or so Kahn puts it), is the home country of both Kahn and his wife.  Kahn is very proud, perhaps overly proud, of his Laotian background, and he constantly juxtaposes himself against the 'rednecks' that live all around him. \n"}, {"text": "Is Texas the first state in the United States that the Souphanousinphones have called home?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tBefore they moved to Arlen, Kahn and his family resided in Orange County, California.

Lauren Tom has appeared in numerous movie and television roles.

Laoma falls for the lonely Bill when she works as a housekeeper in his bachelor pad.  Kahn is simply appalled at the whole situation, not only by the love affair but also by the fact that his mother is working in 'that filthy cracker shack', or so he refers to Bill's home. \n"}, {"text": "Kahn drives a Chevy Tahoe.

At what musical instrument does she especially excel?", "correct": "Violin", "options": ["Tuba", "Piano", "Saxophone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViolin.\n\n\tUnlike her on-again, off-again boyfriend Bobby Hill, Connie is a straight-A student in school, and is very focused on her academic future.
