{"id": "271238", "name": "The Bottle Deposit Quiz | 'Seinfeld' - Season 7 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Seinfeld", "Episodes", "Season 7"], "questions": [{"text": "What item does Mr. Peterman want Elaine to secure for him at an auction?", "correct": "A set of golf clubs", "options": ["A car", "A dinette set", "A blazer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA set of golf clubs.\n\n\tIn the beginning of this episode, Mr. Peterman informs Elaine of an auction for JFK memorabilia, and he asks if she would attend while he is out with a lady-friend.  She agrees to go and bid on a set of JFK's presidential golf clubs, which Mr. Peterman says he would bid $10,000 for.\rMeanwhile, George is talking with Mr. Wilhelm about a task he is to undertake (as per Mr. Steinbrenner).  Unfortunately, he gaps you during their conversation, and George nearly follows the man into the bathroom to hear what he's saying.  He decides to wait outside.  This turns out to be a bad move though, as he agrees to the plan without the knowledge of what it actually is.  Jerry discusses the idea with George and suggests he ask Mr. Wilhelm a follow-up question to get direction. \n"}, {"text": "According to Kramer, which state refunds ten cents for each recycled bottle?", "correct": "Michigan", "options": ["Wisconsin", "Vermont", "Massachusetts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichigan.\n\n\tWhen Newman drops an empty bottle into Jerry's garbage can, he says he doesn't want to pay the five cents to recycle it.  He's quickly corrected and realizes that he actually gets five cents for doing it; ten if he brings it back in Michigan.  Kramer stops him there; he's tried to bring bottles back to Michigan before to make money off the idea, but he could never get the margins to work, and he'd always lose money.  Newman vows to make the scam work.\rWhen Jerry takes Elaine to the auction, they run into Elaine's arch-nemesis, Sue Ellen Mischke.  Although she assumes they're there to get a glimpse of high-society, Elaine counters her, saying she came to bid on anything that took her fancy.  When she bids on the clubs, Sue Ellen attempts to beat Elaine, and Elaine does end up winning them, but only after offering double what Mr. Peterman gave her. \n"}, {"text": "What did Kramer and Newman leave under the hood of Jerry's car?", "correct": "Groceries", "options": ["Christmas presents", "Their jackets", "A spare tire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGroceries.\n\n\tWhen Jerry drops Elaine off at her apartment, he notices a reason behind an odd clunking noise under the hood of his car.  Newman and Kramer, who took the car out earlier that day, had left their groceries under the hood, having run out of room in the rest of the car.  Jerry says he needs to take the car in to Tony, his mechanic, who he finds is good at working on his car, but is so obsessive over such tiny things.\rElaine tells Mr. Peterman of the high-priced bid for the golf clubs and he quickly gets over the fact.  However, Elaine left them in Jerry's car the night before, so she has to make up a story to get them first.\rGeorge quickly formulates his plan in the meantime and he asks Mr. Wilhelm for advice.  He quickly discovers he needs to work on payroll for it. \n"}, {"text": "Before what day do Kramer and Newman initiate their bottle return plan?", "correct": "Mother's Day", "options": ["Valentine's Day", "Christmas Day", "Easter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMother's Day.\n\n\tNewman, noticing a picture of his mother on a nearby table, realizes a loophole in the tightly-sealed bottle deposit plan.  He remembers that all regional mail goes to a facility in Michigan to be sorted, and extra trucks are sent out before major holidays.  He signs up a truck to take to Michigan and tells Kramer that they can fill the rest with bottles.  Kramer finally agrees to go since the idea is foolproof and they begin collecting cans.\rWhile George nearly nods off to sleep in his office, Mr. Wilhelm comes in to check the progress he's made.  George asks for more guidance and discovers he needs to go downtown.  When he asks for clarification, Mr. Wilhelm says he need to go downtown just like the Petula Clark song.  He goes to Jerry with this information and they try to analyze it, but they come up with nothing. \n"}, {"text": "According to Tony, what's the life-blood of the car?", "correct": "Motor oil", "options": ["Transmission fluid", "Washer fluid", "Gas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMotor oil.\n\n\tWhen Jerry gets back home, he gets a message from his mechanic telling him that he needs to talk about the car.  He also gets a call from Elaine regarding the golf clubs and she decides to meet him at the shop to pick them up.  Tony goes on to tell Jerry that he needs to do a complete overhaul but he needs help in the long-run from Jerry, who will need to maintain it.  Jerry simply says he can't afford it, so as long as his car runs fine, he'll be okay. He also says that he wants to take his car to another place.  Tony says he'll take the car off the lift and take it around to him at the front.  Elaine arrives shortly after and the two witness Tony speeding around the building and stealing Jerry's car. \n"}, {"text": "When Jerry talks to the detective about his car, is he reassured that they will find it?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAfter giving Tony's information and info about his car and driving styles, Jerry learns that most cases of car theft go unsolved or they have a bad ending to them.  Meanwhile, Elaine tells Mr. Peterman of the snag with his golf clubs and the fact that they're in the back seat of the car.\rMr. Wilhelm also talks to George about the good job that he did on the assignment.  Unfortunately, George never actually did the assignment because he didn't know what to do about it.  He tells Jerry later that day that he really doesn't care because he's getting good credit for work he didn't need to do.  It is later revealed that Mr. Wilhelm may have been responsible as he was getting forgetful (as a result of forgetting to take his medication). \n"}, {"text": "What type of car does Jerry drive?", "correct": "Saab", "options": ["BMW", "Ford", "GM"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaab.\n\n\tJerry and Elaine are called down to the shop with his service records and they find that the detectives have uncovered a dismantled Saab that Tony had been working on.  Luckily, it isn't Jerry's car.  They discover this because Jerry never had a Turbo.  They are forced to break the news to the real owner.\rLater that night, Jerry gets a call from Tony on his car phone and discovers that they are driving down a nice, traffic-free road that's free of potholes.  Tony informs Jerry that the car is alright, but he won't be bringing it back.\rMeanwhile, Kramer and Newman continue their trip to Saginaw, Michigan with thousands of bottles and cans in the back of a mail truck.  Along the way, they sing their own variation of 'One Hundred Bottles of Beer on the Wall'. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Newman and Kramer find Jerry's car?", "correct": "Ohio", "options": ["Upstate New York", "Connecticut", "The Hamptons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOhio.\n\n\tWhile driving down the highway, Kramer spots a Saab similar to Jerry's with New York plates, so he gives Jerry a call for confirmation and discovers that they in fact have the same license plate number.  They decide to follow Tony and the car to see where it's heading.\rJerry calls Elaine and the two listen over the phone to their progress.  When Tony takes a turn onto another highway, Kramer says he can't do it since he and Newman are depositing the bottles in Michigan, but with some pleading, Jerry and Elaine are able to persuade Kramer into following the car and clubs.  However, the two are barely able to make it up the ramp due to their weight, and Kramer is forced to open the hatch in the back of the truck and toss out some bags of cans. \n"}, {"text": "How is Kramer able to lure Newman out of the mail truck?", "correct": "By claiming that he saw a pie stand.", "options": ["He didn't.  Newman lured Kramer out of the truck.", "By letting him out to get food at a gas bar.", "By saying to take a washroom break."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy claiming that he saw a pie stand.\n\n\tWhen Kramer realizes that they can't gain any ground on Tony and the car, he discovers that the problem for his sluggish driving spawns from the fact that Newman is in the passenger seat.  He decides to kick Newman out of the truck and leave him on the side of the road to get ahead (which he is able to do).  Newman ends up wandering through forests and fields before stumbling on a house that will take him in.  The one rule he has to adhere to: he can't touch the homeowner's attractive daughter.\rKramer begins to tail Tony and the car, but Tony catches on and begins throwing the golf clubs at him from the back seat.  He goes through the entire bag and finally throws the bag itself before Kramer blows a tire and is forced to stop the mail truck.  Tony gets away with the car, but Kramer is able to pick up the near-destroyed golf club set. \n"}, {"text": "Does Jerry ever get his car back in this episode?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tMr. Steinbrenner is disappointed in the work that Mr. Wilhelm did and he assumes it was George's responsibility, so he has him committed to a mental institution.  While George is there, he runs into Deena and her 'Pop' from the episode \"The Gum\".  She doesn't help him though, as she believed he was crazy all along.\rKramer picks up the golf clubs and stops at an old farmhouse for help, but he discovers that Newman has been inside.  The two are forced to leave when the homeowner realizes that Newman has been touching his attractive daughter.  He chases them out with a gun.\rJerry never gets his car back in the end, but Elaine gets the broken and bent clubs back.  Mr. Peterman is pleased with them nonetheless.  He just assumes that JFK was a violent golfer. \n"}]}
