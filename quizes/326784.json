What was the name of the film?", "correct": "Groundhog Day", "options": ["Day of Doom", "Day In, Day Out", "A Day in the Life"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGroundhog Day.\n\n\t\"Groundhog Day\", directed by Murray collaborator Harold Ramis, was released to critical acclaim after appearing in theaters in 1993.  In the film, Murray plays a weatherman who after a dismal Groundhog Day, during which he has to film a piece about Punxsutawney Phil, ends up being forced to relive the same day over and over again.  Now a part of the U.S. National Film Registry, \"Groundhog Day\" was one of the most successful films of 1993, earning over $70,000,000 in its theatrical run.  Since its release it has appeared on several different AFI lists. \n"}, {"text": "James Bond's twentieth adventure took him to North Korea, Iceland, and Cuba.  Sure, it wasn't all in one day, but hey, when you have to stop a solar-powered laser from melting the ice caps, you have to act fast.  What's the 2002 movie's name?", "correct": "Die Another Day", "options": ["Days of Solace", "The Living Daylights", "Tomorrow Never Dies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDie Another Day.\n\n\tIn Pierce Brosnan's final bout as James Bond, the classic 00-agent, he and Halle Berry teamed up to take down the Koreans.  Gustav Graves had control of a satellite known as the Icarus, which he planned to use to shoot concentrated beams of sunlight at any location on the planet.  All the while, Bond took the time to visit fancy ice hotels, fence with Madonna and uncover this devious scheme. After \"Die Another Day\" was released, the Bond franchise took a turn by returning to the \"Casino Royale\" story to reboot the entire storyline.  After its box office run finished, it had earned over $400,000,000. \n"}, {"text": "This George A. Romero zombie flick, released in 1985, was the third in his series.  What was its name?", "correct": "Day of the Dead", "options": ["28 Days Later", "Day of the Living Dead", "Day of the Zombies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDay of the Dead.\n\n\tOften regarded as one of the worst of Romero's original \"Of the Dead\" creations, \"Day of the Dead\" was released in 1985, almost two decades after the original \"Night of the Living Dead\" (these days just drag on, don't they?).  It was, coincidentally, released in the same year as Dan O'Bannon's hilarious spin-off, \"Revenge of the Living Dead\".  Not being one to shrug off the horror remake train, \"Day of the Dead\" (like \"Night of\" and \"Dawn of\" before it) was graced with a remake in 2008 by Steve Miner, the director of the second and third \"Friday the 13th\" films in the 1980s, though it went straight-to-DVD.  The original \"Day of the Dead\" earned $34,000,000 in the box office and was followed twenty years later by \"Land of the Dead\". \n"}, {"text": "On this day in 1996, Will Smith battled aliens, the White House exploded, and Bill Pullman was president.  What was the title of this high-grossing, Roland Emmerich film?", "correct": "Independence Day", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndependence Day.\n\n\tCertainly the successful film, \"Independence Day\" was a film that sparked a renewal of the sci-fi genre.  Released in 1996 and directed by Roland Emmerich (who likes to destroy the Earth in the majority of his movies), \"Independence Day\" was a hit, earning over $800,000,000 in the box office.  In its first week, it broke box office records for total gross (and remained undefeated until the second \"Jurassic Park\").  It remained a winner and became the top-grossing movie of 1996.\rIn the movie, the world was surrounded, over its largest cities, by alien spaceships.  With this invasion in progress, the world had to figure out how to save their planet before they were wiped out.  The States sort of spearheaded the operation in the movie; it was quite patriotic.  You should see Emmerich's other films...they're very similar. \n"}, {"text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger returned for this second movie in the \"Terminator\" series in 1991, along with Linda Hamilton.  What was the subtitle of this James Cameron film?", "correct": "Judgment Day", "options": ["Day of the Cyborg", "Day of the Terminator", "End of Days"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJudgment Day.\n\n\tSet many years after the original \"Terminator\" film, released in 1984, \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" was nominated for six different Academy Awards (winning four).  It also earned over $500,000,000 in the box office, though at the time it was the most expensive movie ever produced.  James Cameron has always had a knack for that though - \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\" weren't funded through food stamps.\rStarring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, the film occurs many years after the original.  The evil Terminator from the first film (Schwarzenegger) has been reprogrammed for good and an evil T-1000, made of liquid metal, is here to kill John Connor.  This film was followed by \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\" in 2003. \n"}, {"text": "Jason Voorhees wreaked havoc on teenagers at Camp Crystal Lake, in Manhattan, and even in space in this horror franchise, known by what name?", "correct": "Friday the 13th", "options": ["Reckoning Day", "April Fools Day", "Happy Birthday to Me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFriday the 13th.\n\n\tPerhaps one of horror's most profitable series, \"Friday the 13th\" began in 1980 directed by Sean S. Cunningham (who also produced many Wes Craven films).  Critics didn't like it.  Audiences did.  By the time the series' twelfth film, a remake of the first four, arrived in 2009, it earned a collective $400,000,000.  Eight different \"Friday the 13th\" titles appeared in the 1980s, with more to follow in the coming decades. Voorhees later went head-to-head with Freddy Krueger, of \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" fame, in \"Freddy Vs. Jason\" in 2003, before Freddy too went aboard the remake train through Platinum Dunes in 2010.  Michael Bay certainly has a thing for horror reboots, doesn't he? \n"}, {"text": "Keanu Reeves played an emotionless alien (ha!) who comes to Earth to warn everyone of impending danger in what 2008 film directed by Scott Derrickson?", "correct": "The Day the Earth Stood Still", "options": ["The Day of the Invasion", "The Day the Matrix Died", "The Day of the Body Snatchers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still.\n\n\tAlso starring Jennifer Connelly (of \"A Beautiful Mind\" and \"Dark Water\"), Kathy Bates, and John Cleese, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" was based on a movie of the same name, released over fifty years earlier.  Keanu (Klaatu in the film) has arrived on the planet with 'Gort', a Genetically Organized Robotic Technology, in order to provide a message about the future of the planet.  While the film was filled with effects, it stood as still as its title implied - many felt it had no story.  It still made over $200,000,000 - people stood still long enough to watch it.\rDirector Scott Derrickson was also known for \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" while Keanu Reeves is likely to continue to find himself typecast in emotionless roles. \n"}, {"text": "Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz both starred in this 2010 film about a secret agent and a source of unlimited energy.  What is the name of this movie?", "correct": "Knight and Day", "options": ["Every Day", "Daybreakers", "Daylight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKnight and Day.\n\n\tCruise played the secret agent in this one and, after a whirlwind of a time with Cameron Diaz, she got pulled into a plot involving an everlasting battery of energy.  Coincidentally, Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise also filmed \"Vanilla Sky\" together in 2001 (directed by \"Almost Famous\" director, Cameron Crowe).\r\"Knight and Day\" was directed by James Mangold, also known for his work in \"Identity\" and \"Walk the Line\".  It also starred Maggie Grace (of \"Lost\") and \"Little Miss Sunshine's\" Paul Dano. \n"}, {"text": "This film, with a massive ensemble cast, was released in 2010 and could have been the American version of \"Love, Actually\"...only set at a different holiday.  What Garry Marshall film was it?", "correct": "Valentine's Day", "options": ["Easter", "St. Patrick's Day", "Christmas Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nValentine's Day.\n\n\tStarring every actor from Alba onwards through the alphabet, \"Valentine's Day\" appeared in theaters around that time of year and commanded box office intake for the weekend.  Overall it earned over $200,000,000 (how much was divided amongst its principal cast?) and sparked interest in a \"New Year's Eve\" sequel. The film took place on the titular day with several different couples uniting, meeting, and embracing their love in different settings.  Julia Roberts showed up on a plane, Jennifer Garner was a school teacher, and Taylor Swift made an appearance with a \"Twilight\" werewolf.  Unfortunately, despite big numbers in theaters, critics really didn't feel the love. \n"}, {"text": "In this 2009 movie, a greeting card company worker dated Zooey Deschanel for several days.  What sleeper hit directed by Marc Webb was this?", "correct": "500 Days of Summer", "options": ["500 Days of Autumn", "500 Days of Spring", "500 Days of Winter"], "explanation": "\n\n\n500 Days of Summer.\n\n\tStarring Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the film was directed by Marc Webb (who has an extensive filmography in the music video world!).  Taking in over $70,000,000 in his debut work with \"500 Days of Summer\" made the film quite the popular summer sleeper.  Critics highly enjoyed the movie too!  Many featured the film on top ten lists for 2009 (even in the #1 position).  This independent film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival before taking a wider release.\rThe movie was about a man who worked at a greeting card company.  Over the course of 500 days, he and a girl named Summer developed a relationship, despite the fact that she didn't believe that true love existed.  The movie took a cross-section of several different days, and not in chronological order, making the movie truly unique in its storytelling. \n"}]}
