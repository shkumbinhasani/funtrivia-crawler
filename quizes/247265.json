{"id": "247265", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'House Arrest' Multiple Choice Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "After a session in the O.R., tempers are high and tolerance for nonsense is low.  Thus, when Hawkeye insults Margaret, she eggs Frank on to guard her honor.  How exactly does Frank retaliate on her behalf?", "correct": "He whips Hawkeye in the rear end with a towel", "options": ["He bops Hawkeye on the head with a clipboard", "He whacks Hawkeye over the hand with a scrub brush", "He slaps Hawkeye with a latex glove"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe whips Hawkeye in the rear end with a towel.\n\n\tHot Lips is insulted and demands 'satisfaction', much as if she were calling for a duel.  However, her satisfaction will only come through Frank, who seems weary about getting involved.  Frank's fragile ego can only take so much from the persistent Hot Lips, however, and he is forced to towel whip Hawkeye. \n"}, {"text": "What exactly does Hawkeye do in retaliation for Frank's seemingly harmless violation of his space bubble?", "correct": "Socks Frank in the face", "options": ["Kicks Frank in the groin", "Punches Frank in the gut", "Tackles Frank to the ground"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSocks Frank in the face.\n\n\tTalk about your assymetrical retaliations!  Frank's seemingly childish act is met by brute force from Hawkeye.  This somewhat uncomfortable scene is reminiscent of a scene in the 1970 film 'MASH', where Trapper punches Frank after he had blamed an orderly for the death of a patient.  In the scene in this episode, the reasoning for the punch seems much less justified. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret is completely unnerved at the beginning of the episode, and why not, a certain Colonel Reese is coming to observe her work.  When Reese arrives, where does she take her quarters?", "correct": "Margaret's tent", "options": ["The nurses' tent", "The V.I.P. tent", "She brings her own trailor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret's tent.\n\n\tColonel Reese is very forward, quite jovial and apparently hungry for attention from the opposite sex.  Classic Hollywood actress Mary Wickes, who appeared in such films as 'Now, Voyager' and 'White Christmas', does an excellent job as Colonel Reese here! \n"}, {"text": "Frank and Margaret have chosen to press charges against Hawkeye for his violence against Frank.  However, Trapper has another story as to how Frank received his injury.  What does Trapper claim happened to Frank?", "correct": "He slipped on a bar of soap", "options": ["He tripped over some dirty towels", "He injured himself giving mouth-to-mouth to Hot Lips", "The door of the O.R. hit him"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe slipped on a bar of soap.\n\n\tHenry is seen in his office helping to coach Trapper with the 'bar of soap' story.  Later in the episode when Margaret becomes upset with Frank, she exclaims, 'Hawkeye didn't hit him.  He slipped on a bar of soap!' \n"}, {"text": "During Hawkeye's house arrest, he is completely confined to the Swamp, except for latrine calls.  While enjoying his stay in his tent, Trapper brings Hawkeye a surprise steak dinner.  What type of steak is it?", "correct": "Water buffalo", "options": ["Shark", "Wild boar", "Goat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWater buffalo.\n\n\tHawkeye is afraid that the water buffalo steak might be tough, but Trapper assures him with the following: 'A little old lady rode it to church every Sunday.'  Father Mulcahy arrives just in time to have a taste, but then realizes that its Friday.  Trapper saves the day by claiming, 'it's Saturday, we're over the Date Line.' \n"}, {"text": "Father Mulcahy is generous enough to bring Hawkeye a little care package.  What type of cookies are contained within this prisoner-of-war box that is provided to Hawkeye?", "correct": "Oreos", "options": ["Nilla Wafers", "Nutter Butters", "Lorna Doones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOreos.\n\n\tAmong the items in this prisoner-of-war package that, according to Father Mulcahy, is included as part of the Geneva Convention, include: a razor, toothpaste, soap, a wash cloth, six aspirin and four Oreo cookies.  This doesn't seem like much, frankly.  No panty hose? \n"}, {"text": "That evening, since Hawkeye is unable to move from the Swamp, the entire camp comes there to watch a classic film.  What beautiful actress is the star of the movie for that evening?", "correct": "Gene Tierney", "options": ["Jean Harlow", "Bette Davis", "Joan Crawford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGene Tierney.\n\n\tSpecifically, the film they show is 'Leave Her to Heaven', starring Gene Tierney, Cornell Wilde and Vincent Price.  It's really a good film, probably Gene Tierney's best acting performance.  She received her only Oscar nomination for the film.  According to Hawkeye, Gene Tierney's overbite gets him every time. \n"}, {"text": "While the movie is being shown, Radar and Klinger chat away in the camp office.  It seems that Radar has purchases a pair of elevated shoes to make him look taller.  What company made these shoes?", "correct": "O'Brien & Brophy", "options": ["Indiana Consolidated", "Kenwick & Associates", "Shoes & Such"], "explanation": "\n\n\nO'Brien & Brophy.\n\n\tEarly in the episode, Radar requests that is pants need to be lengthened by three inches, so we know he's up to something.  Later, he receives his elevated shoes from O'Brien & Brophy, and is please as punch.  'I'm a real person,' he happily proclaims. \n"}, {"text": "When Frank sees Radar, does he specifically notice that Radar has elevated shoes?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tFrank is too dense to notice that Radar is taller, but he does notice a general change.  At first, he thinks Radar has changed the part in his hair, but then he realizes that it's Radar's glasses that have been replaced (though they have not, in actuality).  Regardless, Frank compliments Radar as having the apperance of 'dignity and authority'. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the episode, the extremely aggressive Colonel Reese comes on to one of the main 'M*A*S*H' characters, but which?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Klinger", "Radar", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tWhile everyone else is enjoying the movie, Frank is in Margaret's tent, alone with Colonel Reese.  She promises him a promotion to colonel and a position at Walter Reed if he will submit to her.  Just as things begin to heat up, Margaret arrives, prompting Colonel Reese to scream 'Rape!'  The tables are turned on Frank when he comes under house arrest while Hawkeye gets away scot-free!\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
