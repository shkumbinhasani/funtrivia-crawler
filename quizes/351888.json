While the majority of the world will eat this herb, a minority finds it so awful, they describe it to taste like soap, and smell like bugs (Julia Child even told Larry King that she hated the herb so much she would pick it out and throw it on the floor).  This is not too appetizing of a description, but, chemically speaking, it makes perfect sense.  Which herb smells like creepy crawlies and tastes like a bar of Irish Spring?", "correct": "Cilantro", "options": ["Basil", "Chamomile", "Oregano"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCilantro.\n\n\tCilantro, also called Chinese parsley or dhania, is from the coriander plant.  Cilantro is a common herb eaten almost worldwide.  Those who do not like the taste of cilantro may describe the taste as soapy, and the smell as buggy.  This makes perfect sense; cilantro contains certain aldehydes that are also common in soaps and the bug species of insects. When someone tries cilantro for the first time, the brain tries to associate the new taste with familiar items; which is why some find it to taste like soap.  The brain has associated those aldehydes in the cilantro with those found in soap. One can develop a fondness of cilantro if one continues to try it many times. The brain will develop cilantro as its own taste completely, and not associate it with soap as much.  Granted, the soapy taste may never go away (this also can be related to genetics and perhaps even allergies), but one can learn to appreciate the other qualities of cilantro and get past that soap taste. \n"}, {"text": "I like to add a bay leaf or two to quite a number of dishes.  It adds a nice flavor to chili, goes well in chowders, and adds a bit of depth of flavor to many kinds of sauces.  However, when I finish cooking, I remove the bay leaf before serving.  Why is it a wise idea to remove the bay leaves from a dish before serving?", "correct": "They may cause choking", "options": ["They are too strong in flavor; and will take over the dish unless removed", "They are poisonous", "They are brown, wrinkly, gross, and otherwise unappealing to the eye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey may cause choking.\n\n\tBay leaves are delicious in many dishes, especially soups and chilis.  It is often claimed that bay leaves should be removed due to their high level of toxicity.  However, this is just a myth.  Bay leaves are by no means toxic, and, when ground or powdered, can be incorporated into a dish without any risk of harm. The main reason bay leaves are removed is actually because it is difficult to eat.  Even throughout the cooking process, a whole bay leaf remains stiff, and if your dinner guest attempts to eat the bay leaf, it can scratch his throat and even cause one to choke.  It has tiny barbs that will stick to the throat, so once it is finally swallowed, it will have scratched and torn the throat, causing some minor damage (and a lot of coughing, no doubt). \n"}, {"text": "This herb, which is most commonly used to make pesto, is very versatile.  Even the seeds can be used.  Some species of this herb, when their seeds are soaked in water, they become gelatinous, and, in this form, are used in many popular Asian desserts and beverages.  One of these drinks is faluda.  Which herb can be formed into a gel to make certain drinks?", "correct": "Basil", "options": ["Mint", "Oregano", "Cilantro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBasil.\n\n\tIt might sound a bit odd, but basil seeds can be soaked in water and used as a sweet component in many Asian drinks and desserts.  When soaked, the basil seeds become a sticky, gelatinous mass; and though it might sound strange, these jelly seeds are quite sweet.  They are used to make faluda, sherbet, and hote (basil seed drink). \n"}, {"text": "When one goes to a local Japanese restaurant and orders sushi, they are often given a small plate of garnishes for the sushi.  One of these spicy garnishes is known as wasabi.  Wasabi is known for its spice that will clear the sinuses of just about anybody.  To make this spicy paste, one grinds the wasabi root, which then becomes a paste.  But wait, if you are in the United States and decide to eat at a small sushi restaurant, and order wasabi, is it usually actually from the wasabi plant?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tTypically, in the United States, wasabi is not actually made from the wasabi plant.  This is because the plant is actually fairly rare, and can only be found in specialty stores and higher end restaurants.  More often than not, the wasabi is actually made from a mixture of horseradish (which is related to wasabi, but does actually taste much different), mustard, starches, and green food coloring.  Real wasabi is typically found only in Japan, where there are a few regions where this difficult-to-cultivate plants are actually grown.\r Wasabi leaves are spicy just like the roots.  The reason wasabi does not burn the throat and nose for long periods of time is because, unlike peppers, the spice is not oil-based.  Therefore, a simple sip of water will be enough to reduce the spiciness of the wasabi, whereas that would not be such a good idea if eating spicy peppers. \n"}, {"text": "If you have ever had a maple syrup substitute, you have no doubt eaten a mixture that contains the seeds of a certain herb.  The leaves of the herb are often used as a vegetable, and eaten more as a lettuce in a salad than a flavoring herb.  Which maple-scented herb is this?", "correct": "Fenugreek", "options": ["Anise", "Fennel", "Oregano"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFenugreek.\n\n\tIn 2005, residents of New York City complained about a maple syrup smell, and they were worried it was, though a pleasant smell, a means of chemical warfare.  The smells lasted off and on until 2009.  The source of the smell?  A fenugreek seed processing plant in New Jersey.  The seeds of the fenugreek are often used in the production of maple syrup substitutes, so, fortunately for those paranoid New Yorkers, there was no chemical harm associated with the maple scented skies.\r Fenugreek is also used in salads, eaten more as a lettuce than an actual herb.  The leaves are much more mild than is common for an herb, so is used more of a vegetable than a flavoring agent. \n"}, {"text": "There is an herb that is often used in soups, salads and omelets, mostly in France.  The herb is related to parsley, and is sometimes called \"gourmet's parsley\".  It also has a slight licorice taste to it.  Which mild herb is this?", "correct": "Chervil", "options": ["Chives", "Chicory", "Chimaera"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChervil.\n\n\tChervil is a mild herb that is used widely throughout France to flavor soups, salads, and omelets.  It is also great with seafood, chicken, and vegetables.  The herb is related to parsley, and is oftentimes called the \"gourmet's parsley\".  The licorice taste is not prevalent in chervil, as it is not actually related to the other licorice tasting plants (such as anise, fennel, cicely, etc). \n"}, {"text": "I typically use this herb as a flavoring agent for soups and meats (I love herbs, and liberally cover my foods with them), but they are much more versatile than that.  In fact, a popular soft-drink of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia is flavored with the herb.  What is more, you can use the stems of young plants of this herb as a substitute for asparagus!  What is this unique herb, commonly used to flavor Bearnaise sauce?", "correct": "Tarragon", "options": ["Thyme", "Turmeric", "Taco Seasoning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTarragon.\n\n\tTarragon, also called dragon's-wort or silky wormwood (it is of the wormwood family, after all), is commonly used for many soups, stews, meat rubs, and sauces, most commonly Bearnaise sauce.  Tarragon is, in fact, the main flavor of the sauce, which is commonly used on steak.  Tarragon is also used to make a popular soft-drink called Tarhun, which is made from a sugared tarragon concentrate, and it is bright green in color.  Young tarragon stems can also be used as a replacement to asparagus. \n"}, {"text": "This herb, which is well-known as being used in the making of root beer (or, once was, anyway), can also be used to make gumbo.  It is first powdered into a fil\u00e9 powder, and that powder then is used in the making of gumbo.  The herb can also be used to make soaps and candles, as well as oils.  Which herb is it?", "correct": "Sassafras", "options": ["Saffron", "Safflower", "Sorrel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSassafras.\n\n\tSassafras was once widely used in the making of root beers, though the practice was mostly stopped save for a few old-fashioned type brands.  Typically, sassafras is no longer used due to the fact that it can eventually cause liver damage and cancer, though it takes large quantities to affect humans greatly. Even though it is, for the most part, not used in the making of root beer or teas any longer, some microbreweries do still use it, as well as those who make root beer as a hobby.  Sassafras is mainly used, commercially, for its scent, and can be found in candles, essential oils, soaps, and other scented products. \n"}, {"text": "Leaves of this herb are often used in soups and salads, and the roots are used as a vegetable, often found grated over a salad.
