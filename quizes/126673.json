{"id": "126673", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The General Flipped at Dawn' Quiz | Television | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Very early in the episode Henry calls a meeting in his office where he announces the impending arrival of the new commander of operations in Korea.  This commander, Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele, is played by an actor that all M*A*S*H-o-philes know and love.  Who is this actor?", "correct": "Harry Morgan & Morgan", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Morgan & Morgan.\n\n\tMorgan's performance as General Steele is brilliant, and likely earned him his job replacing the departing McLean Stevenson following the third season.  We all better know and love Morgan as Colonel Sherman T. Potter, but for this one Emmy-nominated performance he was the wild and wacky General Steele...certainly the nuttiest performance this side of Edward Winter, aka Colonel Flagg. \n"}, {"text": "Our favorite M*A*S*H residents learn that Steele is 100% GI, meaning that the camp has to be cleaned up.  Uniforms are to be pressed, haircuts and shaves are to be mandatory, and living quarters are to be 'ship-shape'.  Frank Burns does his part, dusting the Swamp, until he arrives at Hawkeye's corner of the tent.  Hawkeye becomes defensive when Frank approaches his 'medical magazines'.  What is the title of the magazine Frank picks up?", "correct": "The Joy of Nudity", "options": ["The Naked and the Semi-Naked", "Volleyball Fun-a-rama", "Bikini Beach Bash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Joy of Nudity.\n\n\tHmm...'The Joy of Nudity' doesn't exactly sound like a medical text.  Perhaps Hawkeye uses it to study dermatology?  Frank is especially offended when he discovers naked people playing volleyball...sounds extremely risque! \n"}, {"text": "Immediately after General Steele arrives, Henry orders the camp to fall in for inspections.  The general first approaches Frank, commanding him to do which of the following?", "correct": "Trim his nose hair", "options": ["Align his eyes", "Extend his chin", "Dewax his ears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrim his nose hair.\n\n\tMuch to Frank's chagrin the general notices several menacing nose hairs emerging from Frank's proboscis, apparently a big no-no in the army.  Steele commands his aide to give Frank an 'N' on his notepad, for 'nostril'. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret is next for the treatment.  Steele's orders to Margaret?  'Gut in, chest out!'  According to Steele, this was a quote from which historical figure?", "correct": "Black Jack Pershing", "options": ["Joan of Arc", "Stonewall Jackson", "Hannibal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack Jack Pershing.\n\n\tI'm quite certain that the historical record does not list American World War I General Pershing as ever having spoken these words, though perhaps he uttered them off the record? \n"}, {"text": "After announcing to Father Mulcahy that 'there are no atheists in foxholes' the general turns to Radar.  According to his comment to Radar, who does the general consider to be 'rotten Indian fighters'?", "correct": "The Irish", "options": ["Enlisted men", "Iowans", "Short people"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Irish.\n\n\tSteele insists that Father Mulcahy shine up his cross after the 'atheists' comment.  Afterward he turns to Radar, asking his name.  Discovering that Radar has an Irish name he follows with his charming comment about the Irish being rotten Indian fighters.  When the hapless Radar responds to Steele's question, 'Where are you from son?', the general quickly interrupts, 'No talking in ranks!' \n"}, {"text": "Steele's final encounter during the inspection is with Klinger, who has selected a lovely blue checkered dress and a red hat for the occasion.  Rather than demanding an explanation as to Klinger's attire, the general mistakes him for his wife.  We learn that the general's wife is named...?", "correct": "Marjory", "options": ["Laverne", "Lorraine", "Mildred"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarjory.\n\n\tYou would think the five o'clock shadow and beak-like nose would tip General Steele off that this was not his wife Marjory, but rather a man dressed in drag...but then again, we have never seen the general's wife!  The general's exact words to the perplexed Klinger...'Not now Marjory, I'm inspecting the troops!' \n"}, {"text": "That evening Henry treats General Steele to a roasted pig.  After leaving the mess tent, the general discovers which discarded medical item on the ground, insisting that it can be reused?", "correct": "Tongue depressor", "options": ["Surgical Gauze", "Bandage", "Hypodermic needle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTongue depressor.\n\n\tThis begins the general's theme of 'waste, waste, waste', eventually leading to his decision to move the camp.  According to Steele, 'It was waste that defeated Hnnibal at the Battle of Zama!' \n"}, {"text": "After dinner Steele insists that Henry direct him towards the supply room, where Hawkeye is unfortunately having a 'date' with Nurse Baker.  Which items of food has Radar procured for Hawkeye to improve the date with Nurse Baker?", "correct": "Saltines and cheese", "options": ["Biscuits and fried chicken", "Champagne and sardines", "Canned ham and French bread"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaltines and cheese.\n\n\tHawkeye especially comments on saltines several times during the episode, making it apparent that anything besides typical mess fare was a luxury in Korea! \n"}, {"text": "After Henry and General Steele enter the supply room, Hawkeye masquerades as a reporter for the United Press in order to stay out of trouble.  Steele is delighted to share with Hawkeye several 'quotes' among other personal information.  This includes the fact that he is sending which item home to his wife?", "correct": "Jeep", "options": ["Gatling gun", "Helicopter", "Howitzer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeep.\n\n\tThe general launches a few zingers at Hawkeye once he discovers Hawkeye is a member of the 'fourth estate'.  For the record the general 'predicts and early end of the war, if it doesn't rain and we get all wet.'  After offering to provide some 8 by 10 glossies, Steele announces that 'A picture is worth a thousand words', this quote being from General George Armstrong Custer, of course!  Finally, he requests that Hawkeye write home to his wife about the jeep and to thank her for the dried prunes, 'The best thing since the Gatling gun.' \n"}, {"text": "We next see Steele in the Officers' Club where he encounters Trapper having a drink with Warrant Officer Martin Williams, the chopper pilot.  After grilling Williams about his helicopter's fuel efficiency, Steele decides that the M*A*S*H should be moved closer to the front.  He enforces this with a quote from General Cornwallis, or so he claims.  What is this quote?", "correct": "You do your best business on Main street!", "options": ["You can't treat the enemy until you see the white in their eyes!", "Doctors and nurses shall be our front line of defense!", "Craters and cross-fire shall never stand in the way of progress!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou do your best business on Main street!.\n\n\tOnce again the inappropriately matches an unlikely quote to an unlikely source, the British General Cornwallis never said such a thing!  According to Steele, 'M*A*S*H means mobile army surgical hospital, and mobile you shall be!' \n"}, {"text": "Soon after the Cornwallis quote, General Steele cites his most amusing apocryphal quote.  Please complete the quote by filling in the blank:  'A ________ will never stand in the way of victory!'", "correct": "Radish", "options": ["Sponge", "Latrine", "Boot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadish.\n\n\tThis is Steele's response to Henry, who in his consternation about bugging out announces that the 'nurses have just recently planted radishes!'  The general assigns his radish quote to French World War I Marshall Foch...does anyone know how to say 'radish' in French? \n"}, {"text": "General Steele brings Henry and Frank along with him to discover a new location for the M*A*S*H, dangerously close to the front.  With sniper bullets zinging over his head, which song does the general gleefully sing?", "correct": "I Love a Parade", "options": ["Singin' in the Rain", "Daisy", "76 Trombones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI Love a Parade.\n\n\tSteele's ideal location looks like a swamp, which doesn't seem to bother Frank or Henry much.  What does bother them, however, is the general's insistence that Henry salute him.  Even Frank seems rational in suggesting that saluting an officer so close to the front might draw sniper fire, but Steele insists.  Sure enough, the bullets come flying and both Henry and Frank become terrified.  General Steele seems right at home, singing 'I Love a Parade' while driving off in a shower of bullets! \n"}, {"text": "Back to the camp, arrangements are being made to bug out.  Hawkeye has other ideas, however, such as helping to save a wounded soldier.  Hawkeye sends a soldier to Seoul via chopper, disobeying Steele's orders to hold the chopper for his private use.  This results in Hawkeye's being court martialed by the general.  Which of these is not one of the charges faced by Hawkeye?", "correct": "Failure to attend inspection", "options": ["Disobedience of orders", "Insubordination", "Impersonating a civilian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFailure to attend inspection.\n\n\tHawkeye gets himself into trouble with Steele after sending the chopper off to Seoul, disobeying a direct order.  Steele berates Hawkeye for being 'insubordinate' and 'insolent', to which Hawkey responds, 'You're nuts!'  Even the general can't argue with that... \n"}, {"text": "At the beginning of Hawkeye's court martial trial, the chopper pilot is called to testify.  But before Steele begins with the questioning, he insists on a musical number from chopper pilot Williams.  Which song does Steele end up performing as an illustration to Williams?", "correct": "Mississippi Mud", "options": ["My Old Kentucky Home", "Tennessee Waltz", "Sweet Georgia Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMississippi Mud.\n\n\tThis is one of the most humorous moments in the episode, watching Morgan dance about while performing 'Mississippi Mud' to the shock and surprise of everyone at the trial.  Needless to say, the case is closed as a result of Steele's performance...Hawkeye is off the hook. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: Steele is returned to the United States where he is given an honorable discharge.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, Steele is promoted to three-star general and given command of the entire Asian theater of operationss  What a zany world the M*A*S*H characters live in!
