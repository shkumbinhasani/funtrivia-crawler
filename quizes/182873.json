{"id": "182873", "name": "The Masters and Their Works IV Quiz | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Matching Artist and Art"], "questions": [{"text": "Among the greatest painters of the early Renaissance was the Flemish artist Jan van Eyck.  Together with his brother he produced one of the key works of the 15th century, called 'The ______ Altarpiece'.  For which city was this triptych produced (and can still be seen)?", "correct": "Ghent", "options": ["Bruges", "Brussels", "Liege"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGhent.\n\n\tProbably begun by Hubert van Eyck, Jan's elder brother, the Ghent Altarpiece is an almost unbelievable work of art for its time.  Featuring various scenes from Ghent, along with a great number of religious figures, the folding altarpiece is covered front and back with paintings by the brothers.  It may now be viewed in the Cathedral of St. Bavo, Ghent (Belgium). \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite members of the Impressionist movement is Camille Pissarro, certainly the most underrated painter of that genre.  Some of his greatest works feature scenes of the busy boulevards of Paris.  An especially lovely painting was executed in 1897 by Pissarro which he entitled 'The Boulevard des __________, Morning, Sunlight' (a very impressionistic title, yes?).  Which of these fills the blank?", "correct": "Italiens", "options": ["Espagnols", "Chinois", "Mexicains"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItaliens.\n\n\tPissarro's paintings of the Boulevard Italiens and the Boulevard Montmartre rank among his greatest pieces, as they show Paris in action during all moments of the day.  Pissarro was concerned with the effects of sunlight and darkness on the buildings, trees and people that stood (or moved) along these great streets.  The painting in this question can be seen at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. \n"}, {"text": "Picasso was a master of many art genres, but he is probably most famous for his involvement in Cubism.  Some suggest that his painting 'Les Demoiselles d'_______' was the prototype of the Cubist genre, as it influenced Georges Braque to develop the Analytic Cubist style.  In which city were these 'Demoiselles' in Picasso's painting?", "correct": "Avignon", "options": ["Lyon", "Marseilles", "Toulouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvignon.\n\n\t'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon' was executed on a canvas that is 96\" high and 92\" across (244 cm x 233 cm), a rather large and bold undertaking for the still very young Pablo (he was only 26 at the time).  The painting features five nude women whose faces and bodies are contorted much as in African art, the very effect for which Picasso was striving.  If you want to see this painting simply go to the MoMA in New York. \n"}, {"text": "El Greco was one of the key painters of the late 16th, early 17th centuries, particularly for his Mannerist style works.  One of his key paintings was executed in 1586 and called 'The Burial of _________'.  Whose name and title fit the blank?", "correct": "Count Orgaz", "options": ["Duchess Estrella", "Duke Artez", "Bishop Campanella"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCount Orgaz.\n\n\t'The Burial of Count Orgaz' can be found in the Church of San Tom\u00e9, in Toledo, Spain.  The various elongated figures in this masterpiece exemplify the Mannerist style of El Greco, who was born Domenikos Theotocopoulos on the island of Crete. \n"}, {"text": "Surrealist extraordinaire Ren\u00e9 Magritte was famous for his reality defying works of art.  In one such painting we see a rather large portrait of a smoking pipe with the words 'Ceci n'est pas une pipe' (This is not a pipe) right beneath.  The English title of this painting is 'The ________ of Images'.  (Fill in the blank)", "correct": "Treachery", "options": ["Fleetingness", "Obstinance", "Uselessness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTreachery.\n\n\tCertainly 'The Treachery of Images' is one of Magritte's most mischievous paintings.  Magritte presents us with a carefully painted image of a smoking pipe, but then assures us with his words that we are indeed not looking at a real pipe.  The veracity of his statement is troubling...it is, of course, only an image of a pipe, but isn't that enough to call it such? \n"}, {"text": "Among my favorite paintings from the 16th century Dutch master Peter Bruegel the Elder is a rather imaginative rendition of a biblical edifice called 'The Tower of _____'.  What word fills the blank and completes the title of this 1563 work?", "correct": "Babel & Bable & Babble & Babbel", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBabel & Bable & Babble & Babbel.\n\n\tBruegel's delicately detailed 'Tower' is magnificently presented in tempera, genuinely bringing to life the storied biblical structure for the viewer.  To see this masterpiece by Bruegel you must journey to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.  (Or, you could go to this webpage: http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/bruegel/babel.jpg) \n"}, {"text": "Together, Paul Signac and Georges Seurat began a movement that they called 'Divisionism', but that we know better today as 'Pointillism'.  One of Seurat's great paintings in this style was his 'Bathers at ________', featuring an idyllic scene at a river bank.  Which location completes the title of this sublime art piece?", "correct": "Asni\u00e8res", "options": ["Limoges", "Chexbres", "Walchensee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsni\u00e8res.\n\n\tThe 'Bathers at Asni\u00e8res' may be found in the National Gallery, London.  Seurat is probably most well-known for his painting called 'Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte', which can be found in Chicago, but I thought perhaps we might focus on another of his marvelous paintings for the purpose of making this quiz more challenging. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite paintings from Sir Joshua Reynolds of the 18th century English school of painters is a delicate portrait of a young girl, dressed in yellow and carrying a basket on her right arm.  The painting is called 'The _________ Girl'; what fruit fills the blank (and the basket)?", "correct": "Strawberry", "options": ["Peach", "Apple", "Lemon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrawberry.\n\n\t'The Strawberry Girl' is one of those paintings that leaves an indelible image in one's mind.  To be found in the Wallace Collection in London, this portrait fancily portrays a child carrying her basket of wild strawberries.  Typically, Reynolds painted classical style portraits of well-heeled adults, so the 'Strawberry Girl' was something of a departure for the famed master. \n"}, {"text": "Famous for shocking the world with his 'Ready Made' pieces, Marcel Duchamp also employed his skills as a virtuoso with the brush in creating wonderful semi-abstract paintings such as his '_____ Descending a Staircase'.  In this painting, which of these descends down the steps?", "correct": "Nude", "options": ["Goddess", "Dog", "Painter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNude.\n\n\tWhen Duchamp first displayed his 'Nude Descending a Staircase' at the New York Armory Show in 1913 it caused a scandal that rippled throughout the art world.  In retrospect, the painting can be viewed as a step along the path towards abstraction and the broadening of possibilities for painters and sculptors alike.  Duchamp's influence on art in the 20th century is probably only surpassed by Picasso (and perhaps C\u00e9zanne or Matisse). \n"}, {"text": "\u00c9douard Manet played a key role in the formation of the Impressionist movement that developed in the second half of the 19th century.  One of his most famous paintings is his '______ on the Grass', which was first exhibited at the Salon des Refuses in 1863.  What meal of the day is happening on the grass in this painting?  ", "correct": "Luncheon", "options": ["Supper", "Dinner", "Breakfast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuncheon.\n\n\tCalled 'Dejeuner sur l'herbe' in French, Manet's 'Luncheon on the Grass' was once displayed in the Louvre, but now resides in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.  This painting is unusual for several reasons, one being that there is a woman who is nude for reasons unbeknownst to the viewer...reminding one somewhat of Giorgione's 'The Tempest' in its mystery.\rI hope that you have enjoyed this little museum tour, and I would be honored if you would try the other quizzes in this series (and perhaps some of my other art quizzes as well.) \n"}]}
