Everyone who placed a call during and following this moment would turn into a rampaging, zombie-like menace beyond their control.  This endless rage would change the world in a matter of hours. Clayton Riddell was in Boston at this time, on business, and while out on the streets, he witnessed the arrival of 'The Pulse' first-hand.  Pixie Dark, a girl who only got a partial blast from her friend's (Pixie Light, as Clay calls her) cell phone, wandered around aimlessly shouting 'WHO AM I!?' and other unusual questions before running into a lamppost multiple times.\n"}, {"text": "Prior to the arrival of 'The Pulse', Clay was a comic book artist.

Here, they bunker down for a bit in the lobby (as the other floors aren't safe) by turning off the elevator and blocking the doors with a couple of tall chairs.  Before they enter, Clay notices a girl in a dress in shock and walking up the street.  She runs away when Clay tries to help her, but she later returns and hides with them in the hotel.  Her name is Alice, and her mother was transformed by The Pulse while they were in a taxi cab. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Tom's cat?", "correct": "Rafe & Rafael & Rafer", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRafe & Rafael & Rafer.\n\n\tAfter deciding that it is safe to leave the hotel, the trio heads to Tom's house in Malden, where they can spend the night.  Here, Tom's cat, Rafe, welcomes them.  Along the way to the house, they meet up with a large group of people evacuating Boston including a religious fanatic who attacks Alice.

Some of the phone-crazies come through the gate and into Tom's backyard to eat the vegetables that he's growing.  After a quick argument between the 'zombies', George ends up breaking the neck of another phone-crazy over a piece of pumpkin. \n"}, {"text": "According to the signs featured along the group's route, what does Kashwak equal?", "correct": "Nofo & No fo & No-Fo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNofo & No fo & No-Fo.\n\n\tAs the trio continues, they meet two people outside the Gaiten Academy in New Hampshire.

These two introduce the main characters to a field full of phone-crazies on the schoolgrounds in Tonney Park.  They also make note of the fact that the phone-crazies sleep there at night while listening to loud boomboxes (usually playing easy-listening tracks).  They all decide to destroy the field to kill the phone-crazies, and to do this, they shoot two propane tankers that they place in the center of the field.  The phone-crazies later get their revenge.\rKashwak=No Fo makes note of the fact that Kashwak is an area where there are no cell phone signals. \n"}, {"text": "What item does Alice carry around with her throughout the journey?", "correct": "A sneaker", "options": ["A cell phone", "A toy car", "A rosary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA sneaker.\n\n\tBack in Malden, Alice picked up a tiny, child's sneaker off the ground.

The next morning, however, it is returned to her when the phone-crazies leave their melted boomboxes on the doorstep of the academy.  That night, they find that Headmaster Ardai has killed himself, though it was actually through telepathy generated by the phone-crazies. \n"}, {"text": "What university name is printed on the front of the Raggedy Man's hoodie?", "correct": "Harvard", "options": ["Yale", "Princeton", "Duke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarvard.\n\n\tThe one who projects all of the images to the survivors is an African-American man in a Harvard hoodie who they call the Raggedy Man because of his appearance.  After Ardai's death, the group continues onward towards Maine and Alice is killed by two normal people (who are later killed by the phone-crazies via telekinesis, as they have plans for the Tonney Park destroyers).  When the remaining three characters arrive in Clay's hometown, they realize that Johnny may still be alive as he escaped the terror and fled to the city hall with the other 'normies'.  They later went north as well. \n"}, {"text": "Does Clay find his son by the end of the novel?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAs they continue, the group joins up with another bunch of people (who actually destroyed two phone-crazy rest stops) and they continue on to Kashwak.  Along the way, one normie in the group (Ray) murders himself after handing Clay a cell phone and a number.  When they arrive in Kashwak, the group is locked in a casino for the night and Clay discovers that there was a phone-activated bomb in the bus that they drove to Kashwak with. Jordan is able to drive the bus into the phone-crazies and they are able to escape.  While Tom and Jordan continue to the safety of Canada, Clay continues to search for his son. He later finds his son in a forest, and although he isn't normal, he's much better off than the other phone-crazies.  Due to the deterioration of the Pulse (possibly due to a worm, as per Jordan's theory), Johnny turns out safer.  In the end, Clay puts a cell phone up to his son's ear in hope that the Pulse may reset itself once more having destroyed itself. \n"}]}
