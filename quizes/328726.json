{"id": "328726", "name": "Spelling It Out - \"Paper Mario\" (N64) Trivia Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Paper Mario", "Paper Mario (N64)"], "questions": [{"text": "Which item can refill 10HP?", "correct": "Super Shroom", "options": ["Mushroom", "Koopa Leaf", "Nutty Cake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Shroom.\n\n\tThe Super Shroom is a blue mushroom item found in some shops and in a number of '?' Blocks around the Mushroom Kingdom.  Mario can use said item inside or outside of battle in order to refill 10HP.  A regular Mushroom (a red item) will only refill a total of 5HP.  Nutty Cake, created by Tayce T. if you hand over a Goomnut (found only in Goomba Village) will refill 10FP while a Koopa Leaf (found in Koopa Village) will only refill 3FP.  A green mushroom, the Ultra Shroom, will refill 50HP later int he game while Life Shrooms can be used to revive Mario if he falls in battle. \n"}, {"text": "What is the boss who has an odd affinity for Chain Chomps in Chapter 2?", "correct": "Tutankoopa", "options": ["Anti-Guy", "Buzzar", "Tubba Blubba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTutankoopa.\n\n\tTutankoopa is responsible for guarding the second of seven Star Spirits in the game in Dry Dry Ruins.  Mario, heading through the temple, will come across numerous strong (and occasionally spiky) enemies which will require a bit of planning to defeat.  Chomps appear on many occasions in the dungeon, even during the boss fight against the evil Tutankoopa. When Mario finishes this boss battle, the second Star Spirit, Mamar, will send Mario on his way with the Lullaby technique for use in battle.  Tubba Blubba is the boss of Chapter 3 and while Buzzar appears in Chapter 2, he is an optional boss on Mt. Rugged. \n"}, {"text": "What badge can be traded to Merlow for a single Star Piece?", "correct": "Attack FX A", "options": ["Peekaboo", "Flower Finder", "Zap Tap"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttack FX A.\n\n\tHeading towards Shooting Star Summit, you can visit Merlow in a house owned by Merluvlee.  On the top floor, Merlow will trade any Star Pieces you find in your travels for rare badges, many of which can't be found elsewhere.  Attack FX A is the lowest-priced and likely the most unnecessary.  These Attack FX badges move all the way up to E, so Mario can sound completely different by the game's end. None require badge points to use.  Flower Finder costs twelve Star Pieces and takes up 3BP but it allows for enemies to drop more flowers after battle.  Peekaboo, costing 3BP and ten Star Pieces will always show enemy health and Zap Tap, at 10 Star Pieces and 4BP gives Mario a permanent electrical charge in battle. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the badge salesman in Toad Town?", "correct": "Rowf", "options": ["Thrift T.", "Dawg", "Merlow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRowf.\n\n\tRowf and his son set up a shop in Toad Town early on in the game (next to Flower Fields) and Mario can visit them once the game is properly underway.  The two of them tend to sell some run of the mill badges for a certain amount of coins.  In some cases they even sell the Speedy Spin badge which makes Mario spin faster outside of battle (using 1BP).  Rowf will also hand over the useful I Spy badge after Mario returns his calculator from Shy Guy Toy Box in Chapter 4.  This badge allows Mario to locate hidden panels around the world to unearth Star Pieces. \n"}, {"text": "Which of Mario's companions is a mail carrier?", "correct": "Parakarry", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nParakarry.\n\n\tParakarry, a Paratroopa who works in the Toad Town Post Office, is the first of Mario's allies to be seen in the game, but the fourth to be added to the group.  Appearing in the second chapter, Mario can add Parakarry to the group if he locates three pieces of dropped mail across Mt. Rugged.  Once added to the party, Parakarry is a valuable asset as he can carry Mario for short distances to cross large gaps.  If Parakarry is your active party member outside of battle, he can also deliver any mail you find to the proper recipients so that Mario can earn Star Pieces. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the attack used by Lady Bow that turns Mario invisible in battle?", "correct": "Outta Sight", "options": ["Cloud Nine", "Air Lift", "Water Block"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOutta Sight.\n\n\tLady Bow, Mario's fifth companion on the journey, is the Boo who owns Boo Mansion on the far side of Forever Forest.  In defeating the \"Invincible\" Tubba Blubba in Chapter 3, Mario will add Bow to the party.  In battle, Bow starts with a straight-forward attack called Smack and Outta Sight which uses Bow's powers of invisibility to shield Mario for one round.  The proceeding round, however, Bow can not attack.  This technique costs 2FP when used.  Lady Bow will later learn Spook and Fan Smack upon reaching later rankings.\rCloud Nine is used by Lakilester, Water Block is used by Sushie, and Air Lift is a skill used by Parakarry. \n"}, {"text": "What word was once used to describe Tubba Blubba?", "correct": "Invincible", "options": ["Unstoppable", "Gruesome", "Angry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInvincible.\n\n\tThe 'Invincible' Tubba Blubba is the final boss of Chapter 3 in which Mario must head to Boo Mansion and Gusty Gulch to assist Lady Bow and her people (the Boos).  Tubba Blubba lives in a castle at the far side of this area and figured to be invincible, he is impossible to defeat until Mario heads through his castle and claims the key to the Windy Mill.  When Mario dives into this location, he'll find Tubba Blubba's heart, the source of his power which, when reunited with its body, will render the boss beatable. \n"}, {"text": "In this game, these creatures care for the Star Kids at Starborn Valley.  What are they?", "correct": "Ninjis", "options": ["Pokeys", "Bumpties", "Goombas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNinjis.\n\n\tStarborn Valley is across the Shiver Snowfield if you head out from Shiver City.  This location (guarded by a harmless creature known as Monstar) is the place where Star Kids are taken care of before they ascend to the heavens.  Here, Mario can meet Merle, Merlon's son, and find a piece of the puzzle concerning the entrance to Shiver Mountain and the seventh dungeon. Ninjis, while typically seen as enemies in the series, are friendly here and act as guardians to the stars.  They are usually seen wearing black.  Bumpties are the penguins seen in Shiver City, Goombas are friends in Goomba Village (and enemies elsewhere), and Pokeys can be seen in Dry Dry Desert. \n"}, {"text": "Appearing in parts of the story involving Princess Peach, what is the name of the Star Kid who informs Mario of the Star Spirits' whereabouts?", "correct": "Twink", "options": ["Kidstar", "Sparkle", "Shine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwink.\n\n\tTwink first appears when Princess Peach is locked in her room in the castle.  After Mario is knocked out of the sky by Bowser, she is placed in captivity until Twink arrives and the two of them muster up the courage to escape out a secret exit (in her fireplace).  Doing this, the two of them usually discover the location of proceeding Star Spirits and Twink is able to evade capture enough times to inform Mario of their whereabouts.  Twink also plays a major part in the final battle against Bowser in the climax of the game's storyline. \n"}, {"text": "What nine-letter location, character, enemy, or item is spelled out with the first letter of the previous nine answers?", "correct": "Star Point", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Point.\n\n\tA Star Point is a unit of experience used in \"Paper Mario\" (N64).  Upon completing a battle (properly), Mario will earn Star Points of a certain amount.  Once he reaches a total of 100, he'll level up and the player can choose from HP, FP, or BP to upgrade.  If Mario is too high a level in battle, he will not receive Star Points from specific enemies. If you're sneaky, you can find someone to cast an enchantment on you somewhere in the game to randomly double the amount of Star Points you receive from some battles.  Of course, you'll probably come across said person in your adventures- it'll cost fifty coins for said power-up. \n"}]}
