Which statement is true of Lincoln's early life?", "correct": "He lost his mother and his sister.", "options": ["He lost a brother and a sister.", "He lost his mother and his father.", "He lost his father and his brother."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe lost his mother and his sister.\n\n\tThe Rutledge story appears to be true; she died of \"brain fever\". Certainly, his marriage to Mary Todd was not made in heaven. As a young boy, Abe lost his mother, Nancy, to \"milk sickness\": the cows apparently ate toxic material and passed it on via their milk. After that Lincoln lost a beloved sister, Sarah, during childbirth. (Lincoln\rwas never particularly close to his father, Thomas.) After his marriage, three of his four sons would die young. \n"}, {"text": "This writer lost his mother at an early age, then later lost his very young wife to tuberculosis. ", "correct": "Edgar Allan Poe", "options": ["Percy Shelley", "T.S. Eliot", "William Butler Yeats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdgar Allan Poe.\n\n\tPoor Edgar had a tough life.

How?", "correct": "Accident", "options": ["Fire", "Suicide", "Epidemic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAccident.\n\n\tThe children were in a car that somehow managed to roll into the river. The children drowned. (An automobile also played a part in Isadora's death: her scarf apparently got tangled with the car -- with disastrous results.) \n"}, {"text": "Rudyard Kipling lost a son in combat. Which war?", "correct": "WW I", "options": ["Crimean War", "WW II", "Boer War"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWW I.\n\n\tKipling's son disappeared during a campaign in the middle of WWI.

", "correct": "Mozart", "options": ["Brahms", "Beethoven", "Chopin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMozart.\n\n\tIn addition to having to deal with the death of his father, Leopold, Mozart lost several children at an early age.

", "correct": "Mariette Hartley", "options": ["Marilyn Monroe", "Gail Russell", "Betty Ford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMariette Hartley.\n\n\tHartley (once well-known for her TV commercials with James Garner) has had a long career in TV and movies. Her mother was the daughter of noted behavioral psychologist John B. Watson. The others have had  other problems. \n"}, {"text": "This actress had to do deal with the gunshot death of her son.", "correct": "Mary Tyler Moore", "options": ["Joan Rivers", "Carol Burnett", "Lucille Ball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMary Tyler Moore.\n\n\tMoore's son, Richie, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
