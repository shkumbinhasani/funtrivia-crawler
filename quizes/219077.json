{"id": "219077", "name": "'Grad 68' Quiz / Test | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television A-C", "Corner Gas"], "questions": [{"text": "What day does Lacey try to advertise in the newspaper?", "correct": "Wings Wednesday", "options": ["French Fries Friday", "Smoked Salmon Saturday", "Second Refills Sunday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWings Wednesday.\n\n\tLacey is disappointed because the paper she planned on advertising in has a really lame editorial that rips off Woodsy the Owl's catch phrase.  When Lacey mentions 'Wings Wednesday' to Wanda, Wanda assumes that she's actually talking about \"Wings\" the TV show rather than chicken wings. \n"}, {"text": "What does one get for subscribing to the Dog River Howler?", "correct": "A calculator", "options": ["A coupon book", "A raffle ticket", "A free coffee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA calculator.\n\n\tWhen Davis ends up counting something wrong, Karen suggests that he subscribe to the paper in order to get the free calculator.  Karen also suggests that they paint over the 'Grad 68' painted on the water tower. \n"}, {"text": "Who never wrote a column for the Dog River Howler?", "correct": "Brent", "options": ["Wanda", "Hank", "Emma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrent.\n\n\tWanda tells Lacey that she once wrote for the Howler and Lacey decides that she could take a shot at writing a column too.  When Brent goes for coffee, he tells Lacey that Hank once wrote a humour column called 'Hank's Hang-ups'. \n"}, {"text": "What does Karen buy at the gas station?", "correct": "A Kit-Kat bar", "options": ["A Coffee Crisp bar", "A pack of Wine Gums", "A box of Ritz Crackers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Kit-Kat bar.\n\n\tWhen Brent bends down to get the chocolate bar for Karen, he gets dizzy and pauses for a while.  Soon after, Lacey comes in and says that the editor of the Howler wants Hank to go back to writing.  Hank says he'd rather direct something. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Davis find his house key?", "correct": "Under a rock", "options": ["In his glove compartment", "In his desk", "Under a welcome mat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnder a rock.\n\n\tDavis finds the key and notices that its odd that Karen brought up a conversation about finding a house key earlier.  He talks to Karen and thinks that she has some weird sixth sense that would let him find any key. \n"}, {"text": "Davis writes a column in the Howler.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDavis writes a Bridge column in the Howler, and when Lacey finds this out, she gets depressed because everyone did virtually nothing to get their columns, and she can't even get a letter to the editor published.  Lacey tells Brent to do whatever he wants with the bathrooms in her depressed state. \n"}, {"text": "When did Brent graduate from high school?", "correct": "1986", "options": ["1932", "1968", "1974"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1986.\n\n\tKaren goes to Oscar when she has no other clues for her 'cold case', and Oscar points Brent out in the yearbook.  He complains that he was dragged along to the graduation and that it was a waste of time and money. \n"}, {"text": "When Karen gathers everyone to The Ruby for an interrogation, Emma is not present.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDavis, Lacey, Brent, Wanda, Emma, Oscar, and Hank are all present, but only because it's 'Wings Wednesday'.  Karen decides to talk to them all in order to determine the felon. \n"}, {"text": "Who began painting Grad 68 on the water tower?", "correct": "Brent", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrent.\n\n\tKaren discovers that Brent was the one who painted Grad 68 because it was listed in his yearbook under post-graduation goals that he wanted to paint 'Grad '86' on the water tower.  Once again, Brent gets dizzy and passes the spray paint to his accomplice. \n"}, {"text": "Hank's picture is in the 1986 yearbook.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tHank actually slept in on picture day and missed getting his photo, but Karen still figures out that not only Hank, but Emma and Davis were also Brent's accomplices.  Emma was able to distract Oscar by handing him a Rubik's Cube, and Davis was able to stop traffic for the vandalism to be performed.  In the end, Karen writes a story for the Howler about the Grad 68 Mystery. \n"}]}
