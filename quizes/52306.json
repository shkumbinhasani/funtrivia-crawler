Clinton's real-world comments to the press regarding the possible discovery of life on Mars (remember that?) fit perfectly into the context of the film. The Clinton administration was reportedly peeved that Zemeckis used this footage without official permission. \n"}, {"text": "When the team discovers video and audio data buried within the overall signal, there is a moment of confusion, as the audio material is in German. Who provides everyone with an immediate translation?", "correct": "Kent Clark", "options": ["Ellie Arroway", "Michael Kitz", "David Drumlin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKent Clark.\n\n\tKent Clark, the blind astronomer who is Ellie's most valued colleague, is based on Dr. Kent Cullers, an actual scientist with SETI. \n"}, {"text": "Before Hadden provides Ellie with the translation primer, several speculations are made as to what message the thousands of pages of alien text might contain.

It's entirely possible that the test dummy is named after this computer or system that was instrumental in detecting the signal. \n"}, {"text": "What brand of cologne does NSA Advisor Michael Kitz wear?", "correct": "Polo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPolo.\n\n\tKent Clark somewhat compensates for his blindness with superb hearing and an uncanny sense of smell. He recognizes Kitz solely by detecting his cologne, and muses, 'I never would have pegged him as a Polo man.' \n"}, {"text": "When Ellie finally arrives at her destination, the alien landscape she perceives is oddly familiar. On what did the aliens base her surroundings?", "correct": "A drawing she made as a child", "options": ["A recurring dream she's had all her life", "The Grand Canyon", "The Very Large Array control center"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA drawing she made as a child.\n\n\tEarly in the film, we see a drawing that young Ellie has made of Pensacola, Florida, a place she had presumably never been, but had contacted that night with her ham radio.
