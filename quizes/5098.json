Finely divided metals, glass, ceramics, carbon, and even water burn in fluorine with a bright flame. \n"}, {"text": "What element's three isotopes have different names?", "correct": "Hydrogen", "options": ["Helium", "Carbon", "Oxygen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHydrogen.\n\n\tThe ordinary isotope of hydrogen, H, is known as Protium, the other two isotopes are Deuterium (a proton and a neutron) and Tritium (a protron and two neutrons). Deuterium and Tritium are both used as fuel in nuclear fusion reactors. One atom of Deuterium is found in about 6000 ordinary hydrogen atoms. \n"}, {"text": "What element is named after Copenhagen, Denmark?", "correct": "Hafnium", "options": ["Cobalt", "Arsenic", "Copper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHafnium.\n\n\tHafinia, Latin name for Copenhagen \n"}, {"text": "Which element has close to 10,000,000 known compounds?", "correct": "Carbon", "options": ["Oxygen", "Hydrogen", "Sodium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarbon.\n\n\tCarbon is unique among the elements in the vast number and variety of compounds it can form. With hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements, it forms a very large number of compounds, carbon atom often being linked to carbon atom. There are close to ten million known carbon compounds, many thousands of which are vital to organic and life processes. \n"}, {"text": "It was not a good idea to invest in this gas in the early 20th century.
