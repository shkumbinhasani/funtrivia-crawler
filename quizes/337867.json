(Think about pi...)", "correct": "March 14th", "options": ["November 22nd", "February 3rd", "August 31st"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarch 14th.\n\n\tNational Pi Day falls on March 14th.  This is because March is the third month (3) and the 14th is day 14 (.14).  Therefore, the day of March 14th can be written as \"3.14\", which is the number that is pi.\r However, National Pi Day falls on July 22 in other parts of the world, where the date is written as day/month instead of month/day, so Pi Day would be 22/7. \n"}, {"text": "If you were to find the volume of an object, you might use pi.  Which of these would not need pi in order to find the volume?", "correct": "Cube", "options": ["Sphere", "Cylinder", "Cone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCube.\n\n\tPi is usually used to find the diameter or the area of a circle.  Since a sphere, cylinder, and cone all contain a circle, they all use pi.\r The volume for a sphere is 4/3 \u2219 (pi) \u2219 r^3.\rThe volume for a cylinder is (pi) \u2219 r^2 \u2219 h.\rThe volume for a cone is 1/3 \u2219 (pi) \u2219 r^2 \u2219 h.\r Key:\rh - height\rr - radius\r^ - to the power of\r\u2219 - multiply\r To find the volume of a cube, you simply multiply the length by the width by the height. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these numbers is pi closest to?", "correct": "22/7", "options": ["25/8", "19/6", "7/2"], "explanation": "\n\n\n22/7.\n\n\tRemember, pi is 3.14159265...\r 22/7 is the same as 3.142857143.  This is pretty close to pi.\r 19/6 is 3.166666667.  Still pretty close to pi, but 22/7 is definitely closer.\r25/8 is 3.125, which is still close to pi, but definitely not as close as 22/7.\rThe furthest away from pi, however, is 7/2, which is equal to 3.5. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these letters does the symbol for pi most resemble?", "correct": "n", "options": ["j", "B", "E"], "explanation": "\n\n\nn.\n\n\tThe symbol for pi looks sort of like a squared off \"n\" with a flat top that extends past both legs, similar to a layer of a house of cards.  Some versions of the symbol are a bit more wavy, similar to putting a big ~ on top of ||.  I would show you the symbol itself, but the site does not allow HTML, so you'll have to be content with googling. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these mathematical equations would always have an end result of pi?", "correct": "Circumference divided by diameter", "options": ["Radius times ulna", "Diameter divided by radius", "Circumference times radius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCircumference divided by diameter.\n\n\tTo find the circumference of a circle, you multiply the diameter by pi.  Therefore, dividing the circumference by the diameter would result in pi.\r Dividing the diameter by the radius would always equal 2, because the radius is defined as half of the diameter.\r The circumference times the radius would be different depending on what the size of the circle is. \n"}, {"text": "If you had a circle with a radius of 50 centimeters, what would the circumference be?", "correct": "314 cm", "options": ["31,400 cm", "7,850 cm", "157 cm"], "explanation": "\n\n\n314 cm.\n\n\tTo find the circumference, you multiply the diameter by pi.  Since the radius of a circle is half its diameter, we know the diameter is 100 cm.  When we multiply 100 by pi (3.14) we get 314.  Therefore, the answer is 314 cm. \n"}, {"text": "What length does the diameter have to be in order for both the circumference AND the area to be the same?", "correct": "4", "options": ["2", "1", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4.\n\n\tIf the length of the diameter is 4, the circumference is 4 times pi.  With the diameter measuring 4, the radius, which is half that, would be 2.  To find the area, you find r^2, which, in this case, would be 4, and multiply by pi, so we get 4 times pi.\r If we use a 1 as a radius, we do not get the same circumference and area.  Remember, to find the area, we use r^2, which would be 1 in this case, and multiply it by pi, which would make the area 3.14.  To find the circumference, we multiply the radius by 2 to find the circumference.  That would leave us with 2.  We multiply that by pi to then get the answer of 6.28. \n"}, {"text": "Imagine that there is a square that is 13 centimeters by 13 centimeters.  Inside the square is a circle that has a diameter of 8 centimeters.  Roughly what percentage of the square is not contained within the circle (outside of the circle but inside of the square)?", "correct": "70%", "options": ["30%", "15%", "85%"], "explanation": "\n\n\n70%.\n\n\tLet's begin by finding the area of the circle.  Remember, to find the area, we take the radius squared and multiply it by pi.  Since the radius is half of the diameter, and the diameter is 8 centimeters, we know the radius is 4 centimeters.  Square this number to get 16, and multiply that by pi to get 50.24 centimeters.\r Now let's find the area of the square.  We take its two sides, both 13 centimeters, and multiply them to get 169 centimeters.\r Now we can determine what part of the square has no circle in it.  Subtract 50.24 from 169.  This gives us 118.76.  This is the area of the square that is not contained within the circle as well.  Now, to find the percentage, we need to take 118.76/169.  This gives us 0.7027 (roughly).  Multiplying this by 100 gives us 70.27.  Therefore, there is roughly 70% of the square that does not contain the circle. \n"}, {"text": "What is the volume of a cylinder with a diameter of 20 inches and a height of 13 inches?", "correct": "4,082 cubic inches", "options": ["6,082 cubic inches", "8,082 cubic inches", "2,082 cubic inches"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4,082 cubic inches.\n\n\tTo find the volume of a cylinder, we first need to find the area of the circle.  Since the diameter is 20, the radius is 10.  We square this to get 100, and multiply that by pi, which gives an answer of 314 inches.  We multiply this by the height, which is 13, to give us an answer of 4,082 inches cubed. \n"}, {"text": "What is the surface area of a cylinder that has a diameter of 20 inches and a height of 13 inches?", "correct": "1,444.4 square inches", "options": ["4,222.2 square inches", "2,666.6 square inches", "3,888.8 square inches"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1,444.4 square inches\n\n\tTo find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to first find the area of the circle.  The area of the circle is 314.  There are two of these circles in a cylinder, so that equals 628 total.  Now we need to find the rest.  To do this, we need to find the circumference.  Remember, the circumference can be found by multiplying the diameter by pi, which in this case gives us 62.8.  We then multiply the circumference by the height (13), which happens to be 816.4 in this case. Now let's add 816.4 and 628 to find the total surface area of the cylinder.  This gives us a total of 1,444.4 inches squared for the surface area of the cylinder. \n"}]}
