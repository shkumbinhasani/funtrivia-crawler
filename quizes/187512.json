{"id": "187512", "name": "\"Star Trek TNG\": Data Quiz | 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' - Characters | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "'Star Trek: The Next Generation' - Characters"], "questions": [{"text": "Here's a crazy idea, let's start with the real name of the actor who played Data throughout the 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' series.  What are his first and last names?", "correct": "Brent Spiner", "options": ["Michael Dorn", "Lavar Burton", "Patrick Stewart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrent Spiner.\n\n\tThough most well known for his role as Data in the the television and movie versions of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation', Spiner has also done work in other films of note, for example 'Independence Day' and 'Miss Firecracker'.  His greatest love is perhaps the theater; he has made numerous stage appearances both on and off Broadway. \n"}, {"text": "Now for some relatively easy questions about Data to help start you going.  As an android, Data has a completely artificial central nervous system.  What sort of 'brain' does Data have?", "correct": "Positronic", "options": ["Technotronic", "Hydroponic", "Quadrophonic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPositronic.\n\n\tThe concept of a positronic brain was not developed by the creators of 'Star Trek', but was rather conjured up by Isaac Asimov in around 1939.  The term is a portmanteau word, combining 'positron' with 'electronic'. \n"}, {"text": "Data's father, Dr. Noonien Soong, was the inventor of the robot series that included Data, his brother Lore and several others.  Did Data ever get a chance to meet his father face to face?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed, he did.  In the 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' episode 'Brothers', Dr. Soong sent for Data via a homing signal.  After essentially hijacking the Enterprise, Data steered the Enterprise to Terlina III, a planet upon which Dr. Soong was hiding out.  Soong's intention was to provide Data with an emotion chip, but unfortunately Data's brother Lore also appeared at Soong's laboratory and stole the emotion chip away from Soong.  Soong died in Data's arms from injuries received in the scuffle with Lore.  Incidentally, all three characters (Data, Lore, Soong) were portrayed by Brent Spiner! \n"}, {"text": "Slightly more challenging now: Aboard the Enterprise D, what was Data's official title, aside from being Second Officer?", "correct": "Operations Manager", "options": ["Personnel Manager", "Chief Petty Officer", "Chief Technician"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOperations Manager.\n\n\tIt was originally intended that Data follow in Spock's footsteps as Chief Science Officer, but apparently the creators of the show decided to give Data some semblance of his own identity, and hence the position Operations Manager was born.  After the Enterprise E was commissioned, it was intended that Data would replace Riker and become the new First Officer.  Unfortunately, the poor chap died before he was able to assume that position (see the film 'Star Trek: Nemesis', if you haven't already). \n"}, {"text": "In the 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' episode 'Descent', Data plays a rousing game of cards with some of history's greatest geniuses.  Who is not present at the card table with Data in this episode?", "correct": "Charles Darwin", "options": ["Stephen Hawking", "Isaac Newton", "Albert Einstein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles Darwin.\n\n\tIn one of the great moments in the history of the series, Data appears alongside Stephen Hawking (incidentally, the only modern day individual to portray himself in any episode of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'), Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton in the holodeck.  After some snappy repartee among the players, Stephen Hawking wins the only hand shown. \n"}, {"text": "In one of the most philosophical episodes of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation', entitled 'The Measure of the Man', Data must appear before a JAG to prove that he is sentient.  What is the name of the man who challenges Data's right to freedom of choice based on the assertion that Data is not a life form?", "correct": "Bruce Maddox", "options": ["John Herbst", "William Lucas", "Philip Watson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBruce Maddox.\n\n\tMaddox, a cyberneticist, has been given permission by Star Fleet to disassemble Data in the hopes that the secrets of Data's positronic brain would be revealed.  Data, believing himself to be a unique life form, chooses not to submit to Maddox's study, and ultimately is forced to resign from Star Fleet.  Maddox challenges Data's right to resign, forcing a trial in which Captain Picard, representing Data, successfully argues that Data is a sentient being, and that, by infringing on his rights, he would be treated no better than a slave. \n"}, {"text": "Being a fully-functioning android, Data is programmed in multiple techniques.  One such technique is the art of love.  Aside from his intimate relationship with Tasha Yar, which of these other lucky ladies does Data attempt to woo?", "correct": "Jenna D'Sora", "options": ["Deanna Troi", "Rachel Sythius", "Alena Fornoth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJenna D'Sora.\n\n\tIn the first season episode 'The Naked Now', Data becomes intoxicated and finds himself in the loving arms of his crewmate Tasha Yar.  In the much later episode called 'In Theory', Data attempts to create a relationship with Jenna D'Sora, another member of the Enterprise crew.  My favorite exchange between the two is as follows:\r Jenna: \"What were you just thinking?\" \r Data: \"In that particular moment, I was reconfiguring the warp field parameters, analyzing the collected works of Charles Dickens, calculating the maximum pressure I could safely apply to your lips, considering a new food supplement for Spot...\"\r Jenna: \"I'm glad I was in there somewhere.\" \n"}, {"text": "In the 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' episode 'The Offspring', Data 'gives birth' to a daughter android named Lal.  Data chose the name Lal from the Hindi language word meaning...?", "correct": "Beloved", "options": ["Daughter", "Brilliant", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeloved.\n\n\tLal is a precocious child, always curious and equipped with emotions, unlike her father.  Lal finds great difficulty assimilating to her environment, largely because of some malfunctions in her neural network.  Her official cause of death (which occurs in the same episode) is a 'cascade failure of her neural systems'.  Fortunately, before she is taken offline, Data preserves her memories in his positronic brain. \n"}, {"text": "In the 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' episode 'Inheritance', Data meets a woman named Dr. Juliana Tainer who claims to be his mother.  Is this woman, in actuality, his co-creator?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn fact, she is not, in actuality, a woman.  Rather, she is another android created by Dr. Noonien Soong after the death of his wife, the real Juliana.  During the episode, Data discovers her true nature, but does not reveal to her that she is an android. \n"}, {"text": "Data enjoys a brief stint as captain of another ship during the 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' episode 'Redemption'.  What is the name of the ship that Data commands in this memorable episode?", "correct": "Sutherland", "options": ["Omicron", "Trieste", "Mark Twain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSutherland.\n\n\tData, aboard the U.S.S. Sutherland, foils a plot launched by Sela (Tasha Yar's offspring) and the Romulans to cross into Klingon space and assist the Duras family in a war against Gowron.  Data survives a challenge from his first officer (Hobson) who doesn't believe that an android is fit to command a ship.  Data emphatically proves Hobson wrong!  \r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other stuff. \n"}]}
