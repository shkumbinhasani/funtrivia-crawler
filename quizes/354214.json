{"id": "354214", "name": "Basic Cell Quiz | Biology | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Biology", "Cell and Molecular Biology"], "questions": [{"text": "Plant and animal cells contain different organelles. Which of the following is *not* found in animal cells?", "correct": "Chloroplast", "options": ["Chloroplast ", "Nucleus ", "Mitochondria ", "Cell Membrane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChloroplast.\n\n\tThe chloroplast is where photosynthesis occurs. This process creates food in the form of glucose for the plant. Chloroplasts absorb light from the sun with a pigment called chlorophyll. They look green because they reflect green light. This gives plants their green color. \n"}, {"text": "The part of the cell cycle where the cell nucleus divides is called mitosis. What is the name of the phase of in which division of the cytoplasm occurs?", "correct": "Cytokinesis", "options": ["Cytophase", "Anaphase", "Prophase", "Cytokinesis "], "explanation": "\n\n\nCytokinesis.\n\n\tCells divide because they perform better when they are smaller. The smaller the cell the more easily it is to move objects in and out of the cell. Division creates two identical new cells. \n"}, {"text": "Cellular respiration is the process in which cells release energy. In which organelle does it occur?", "correct": "Mitochondria", "options": ["Ribosome ", "Lysosome ", "Nucleus ", "Mitochondria "], "explanation": "\n\n\nMitochondria.\n\n\tCellular respiration creates energy in the form of ATP to be used by the cell. It requires oxygen so it is called aerobic. This is where we get the energy we need during physical activity. \n"}, {"text": "Cell division is controlled by the centrioles. Which of the following is a disease of the cell cycle in which cells have lost control of division?  ", "correct": "Cancer", "options": ["Cyclin", "Mitosis failure ", "Cell Disease "], "explanation": "\n\n\nCancer.\n\n\tScientists are not sure what causes a cell to lose control of its own division. Cancer can cause cells to divide too rapidly and out of control. Cells that do not divide can form large tissues called tumors. Cancer is a very serious disease and causes many deaths each year. \n"}, {"text": "Cells move things in and out through the cell membrane. Diffusion occurs when these objects - molecules - move from an area where there are more of them to an area where there are fewer of them. What is diffusion of water through a cell membrane called?", "correct": "Osmosis", "options": ["Osmosis ", "Water Diffusion", "Active Transport", "Water Displacement "], "explanation": "\n\n\nOsmosis.\n\n\tThe opposite of diffusion is known as active transport. This occurs when objects move across the membrane from an area where there are fewer of them to an area where there are more of them. This requires the cell to use energy. \n"}, {"text": "Glycolysis is anaerobic, which means it does not require oxygen. It occurs in the cytoplasm and produces two molecules of ATP energy. If oxygen is present, which of the following processes that consists of two stages occurs in the mitochondria and produces 36 more ATP molecules?", "correct": "Cellular Respiration", "options": ["Cellular Respiration ", "Fermentation ", "Phtosynthesis", "Mitosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCellular Respiration.\n\n\tIf oxygen is not present then glycolysis is followed by fermentation. This process does not create any energy but it creates electron carriers that allow glycolysis to continue over and over again. \n"}, {"text": "Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are opposite cell processes. One puts this compound into the atmosphere and the other one takes it out. Which compound fits this description?", "correct": "Carbon Dioxide", "options": ["Nitrogen", "Carbon Monoxide ", "Hydrogen", "Carbon Dioxide "], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarbon Dioxide.\n\n\tAnother substance that would have fit this description is oxygen, but it's an element, not a compound. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are opposite processes because their chemical equations are reversed. Also, one stores energy while the other releases it. \n"}, {"text": "Plants need more support than animals to keep their shape. Which of the following is found outside of the cell membrane of plant cells to perform this function?", "correct": "Cell Wall", "options": ["Ribosome", "Chloroplast ", "Nucleus "], "explanation": "\n\n\nCell Wall.\n\n\tHaving no bones, plants are more fragile than animals which is why their cells need extra protection. The cell wall protects the plant cell and gives it its shape. Under a microscope, plant cells look like small boxes. Isolated animal cells usually look circular. \n"}, {"text": "Cells contain DNA which contains the instructions that cells need to operate and divide. All cells of the same type have identical DNA. DNA is located in the nucleus inside what structure? ", "correct": "Chromosomes", "options": ["Cytoplasm", "Lysosomes", "Ribosomes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChromosomes.\n\n\tThe nucleus is the complex organelle that contains DNA and controls the cell. A special active center of the nucleus is called the nucleolus. The entire nucleus is surrounded by a structure called the nuclear envelope. The rest of the cell's organelles are located outside of the nuclear envelope in the cytoplasm. \n"}, {"text": "During the cell cycle chromosomes duplicate so that each cell has the same amount of DNA after cell division. When the chromosomes duplicate, they form two identical structures attached in the middle. What are these two structures (not the attachment point) called?    ", "correct": "Chromatids", "options": ["Ribosomes ", "Centromere", "Endoplasmic Reticulum "], "explanation": "\n\n\nChromatids.\n\n\tDuring the second phase of cell division, known as metaphase, the chromosomes line up at the center of the cell. During the next phase, known as anaphase, the two chromatids separate becoming individual chromosomes. The attachment point itself is called the centromere. \n"}]}
