{"id": "131102", "name": "Double sound words again. Let's \"razzle-dazzle\". Quiz / Test | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Alphabetical Words", "Letters in Common - Letter Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Complete the word that means an \"unsophisticated country person\" - \"hill-....\"", "correct": "billy", "options": ["dilly", "silly", "milly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbilly.\n\n\tNow you really would expect that the \"Beverly Hillbillies\" would fix that word in the mind. The term is usually used in a somewhat derogatory fashion, and suggests the intolerance of an insular urban resident on contemplating members of a rural society of which they have little understanding. \n"}, {"text": "You would be on a slippery slope with which fairground attraction?", "correct": "a helter-skelter", "options": ["a whirly-whirly", "a hurly-burly", "a trip trap", " a helter-skelter"], "explanation": "\n\n\na helter-skelter.\n\n\tOf course \"helter-skelter\" can sometimes be used to suggest going somewhere in hurry and confusion as well as being the name for the the spiral slide. What with the music and the noise of the fairground machines you might be forgiven for thinking of a \"hurly-burly\". \n"}, {"text": "What is a \"ha-ha\"?", "correct": "a sunken fence that allows uninterrupted views", "options": ["an instruction card held up by studio managers", "a special type of skirt worn by dancers", "an old fashioned steam locomotive"], "explanation": "\n\n\na sunken fence that allows uninterrupted views.\n\n\tWhen you look out of your mansion you don't want to see fences cutting across your estate but you do want to keep the cattle out. So you call in \"Capability\" Brown who will build you a \"ha-ha\". I wonder if some of you started thinking of \"ra-ra\" skirts or possibly even \"tutus\". \"Ha-ha\" also represents the sound of laughter. \n"}, {"text": "What is a \"hurdy-gurdy\"?", "correct": "a musical instrument rather like a barrel organ", "options": ["a special circular movement in old-time dances", "an old-fashioned hooped dress", "a device for operating a mechanical fan"], "explanation": "\n\n\na musical instrument rather like a barrel organ.\n\n\tWhen gramophones were first invented some people referred to them as \"hurdy-gurdies\" because of the rotating movement involved. Some of you will probably be saying, \"What's a gramophone?\" All technology gets overtaken eventually but sometimes the word remains behind. \n"}, {"text": "What's a good name for an old fogy, a square, a stick-in-the-mud, someone who is out of date and very conservative?", "correct": "a fuddy-duddy", "options": ["a diddle-daddle", "a missed-history", "a faddy-daddy"], "explanation": "\n\n\na fuddy-duddy.\n\n\tIt is strange how when we are young the older generation are \"fuddy-duddies\" and then we learn how to become one ourselves as we grow older. At least it is better than turning into a \"rat-bag\". No doubt a \"fuddy-duddy\" would approve of a \"humdrum\" way of life. \n"}, {"text": "What is the meaning of the word \"Mau-Mau\"?", "correct": "a terrorist organisation in Kenya when under British rule", "options": ["the chain used to restrain a captive elephant", "a wind that blows in the South Pacific", "the Egyptian word for the worship of cats"], "explanation": "\n\n\na terrorist organisation in Kenya when under British rule.\n\n\tThe word \"Mau-Mau\" shows us that English is not the only language that uses the idea of doubling sounds to make a word memorable. No doubt \"Mau-Mau\" was a word of terror for the white settlers but also a word that meant freedom to the native peoples of Kenya. The Mau-Mau leader eventually became the first president of independent Kenya. \n"}, {"text": "What is the word that can be used to describe disreputable people, those people you think of as inferior and merely a rabble?", "correct": "riffraff", "options": ["gutter-clutter", "pleb-plebs", "argy-bargy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nriffraff.\n\n\tOf course we would never call anybody \"riffraff\". That's because we learned the posh Greek word \"hoi-polloi\" from doing the first quiz and it means much the same thing. \"Argy-bargy\" hovers in between slang and respectabilty and means a verbal argument or sometimes a physical scuffle - the sort of thing \"riffraff\" go in for. \n"}, {"text": "In the U.S.A. an important person might be called a \"big shot\" or a \"big cheese\" whilst in Britain we still might use the old-fashioned term a \"big...\"?", "correct": "wig", "options": ["fig", "pig", "dig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwig.\n\n\tYes, a bigwig is \"a celebrity, a dignitary, a heavyweight, nob, a notability, a panjandrum, a personage, a somebody, a V.I.P.\" - according to the dictionary. This puts him or her at the opposite end of the scale to the \"riffraff\". In fact it is just the sort of person to have a \"ha-ha\" on their country estate. \n"}, {"text": "What does the word \"shilly-shally\" mean?", "correct": "to be filled with wavering indecision", "options": ["to run quickly to your next destination", "to argue fiercely on any subject", "to give in quietly to everyone's demands"], "explanation": "\n\n\nto be filled with wavering indecision.\n\n\tHow long did you \"shilly-shally\" over choosing the right answer? The old musical hall song \"My Old Man\" warns you not to \"Shilly-shally on the way\" (some versions use the phrase dilly-dally, with the same meaning) or you will get lost. On the other hand there's no use in getting in a \"hurly-burly\" (a loud confusion) over it. Even Macbeth's witches had to wait for the \"hurly-burly\" to be \"done\". \n"}, {"text": "The answer to this one is very secret.", "correct": "hush-hush", "options": ["sch-sch", "whisper-whisper", "little-lipped"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhush-hush.\n\n\tDid you get that? Your score should be \"tip-top\". To celebrate you should run \"pell-mell\" (headlong in confusion) down Pall Mall (in London) and perhaps have a game of \"ping pong\" or even have a \"sing-song\" and eat a \"bonbon\".  But if your score was only \"so-so\" I would keep it \"hush-hush\". \"Bye Bye\". \n"}]}
