It has been used for making coins, blades, and decorative items. Bronze is especially good at resisting salt-water corrosion and is a good conductor of heat and electricity. \n"}, {"text": "CHRMM", "correct": "Chromium", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nChromium.\n\n\tChromium is a lustrous gray metal that is both malleable yet hard. By adding a small amount of other pigments, it is possible to make colored chromium, a trait that helped give this beautiful metallic element its name. It is often used as a coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, and any other item in which a high metallic luster is desired. \n"}, {"text": "NCKL", "correct": "Nickel", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNickel.\n\n\tThe core of the earth is believed to contain large amounts of nickel. This silvery-white metallic element has been used by mankind for at least 5,000 years. Much of the worlds nickel is used to make stainless steel as well as other alloys. \n"}, {"text": "LMNM", "correct": "Aluminium & Aluminum", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAluminium & Aluminum.\n\n\tAluminium makes up about eight per cent of the earth's crust and is very chemically reactive. Aluminium is valued for its low density, and corrosion resistance. Aluminium is one of the most successfully recycled metals on the planet and is used in the making of many kinds of transport vehicles, packaging, electronics and construction. \n"}, {"text": "THLLM", "correct": "Thallium", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThallium.\n\n\tMany people when first viewing thallium would guess it to be tin, as they are very similar in appearance. Most thallium is used in the electronics industry while the rest is used in glass manufacturing and the pharmaceutical industry. \n"}, {"text": "PLTNM", "correct": "Platinum", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlatinum.\n\n\tPlatinum is one of the world's most valuable metals. This is due to its resistance to corrosion, its natural beauty, and its rarity. The vast majority of platinum is mined in South Africa and it is used in jewelry, electrodes, dentistry equipment and catalytic converters. \n"}, {"text": "MNGNS", "correct": "Manganese", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nManganese.\n\n\tManganese is a blackish-gray, semi-lustrous metal. It is a hard somewhat brittle metal. The major use of manganese is as a strengthening agent to other metallic alloys and is often found in batteries and helmets. \n"}, {"text": "PWTR", "correct": "Pewter", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPewter.\n\n\tPewter is a type of tin alloy. It contains over 90% tin with a variety of other metals including antimony. Man has been using pewter for over 3,000 years, mostly in tableware. Pewter must be hand polished regularly as it tarnishes easily, going from a silvery color to dark gray that has no shine. \n"}, {"text": "LD", "correct": "Lead", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLead.\n\n\tLead is a heavy metal that has a shiny silver chrome-like luster when it is first cut or when it is in liquid form. Once it solidifies and is exposed to air it becomes a dull gray color. Lead has been used in plumbing, batteries, ammunition and in radiation shielding.Excessive contact to lead can be very toxic to humans and animals causing nervous system damage and even death. \n"}, {"text": "PLTNM", "correct": "Plutonium", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlutonium.\n\n\tPlutonium is the heaviest metallic element. It is also radioactive and as a powder it can spontaneously ignite. It is used in nuclear weapons and as a power and heat source. Great care must be used when handling this metallic element as the misuse of plutonium can be catastrophic. \n"}, {"text": "CDMM", "correct": "Cadmium", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCadmium.\n\n\tCadmium is a lovely metallic element with a bluish-white color. Cadmium has a low melting point, is soft, malleable and can be polished to a high luster. Due to its toxicity, uses for cadmium have been limited to picture tubes in televisions, batteries, and some lasers. \n"}, {"text": "RDM", "correct": "Radium", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadium.\n\n\tRadium is a beautiful pure white metal, that when exposed to air, turns a dull blackish gray. It is highly radioactive and unprotected exposure can lead to illness or death. It has been used as a pigment in some paints due to its luminescent effect, and in pharmacology. \n"}, {"text": "CBLT", "correct": "Cobalt", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCobalt.\n\n\tCobalt is known for its hardness and for having a lustrous dark silver-gray color. It has been used for thousands of years as a blue pigment in paints, ceramics, glazes, and glass. Today, the main use for cobalt is as an additive to other metallic alloys to endow strength. \n"}, {"text": "BRSS", "correct": "Brass", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrass.\n\n\tBrass is an alloy that comes in many shades of golden yellows. The colors vary with the mixture of metals involved. It is often used for decoration purposes and in situations where low friction is required, such as ammunition, doorknobs, locks, gears, and in zippers. \n"}, {"text": "TTNM", "correct": "Titanium", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTitanium.\n\n\tHave to squeeze the title metal in here! Titanium is a lustrous, corrosion-resistant silver colored metal. It has the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metal.
