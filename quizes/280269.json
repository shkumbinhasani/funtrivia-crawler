This is where the vault is located.  To the left side of the room, there is a blocked off passage you will use later in another mission. \n"}, {"text": "How many legs does the Contessa have?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Eight", "Four", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tThe Contessa is a spider, remember?  Spiders have eight legs.  Then why does she only have 6, you might ask?  She has only six legs, because two of her eight limbs are actually arms. \n"}, {"text": "What is the color of the water in this level?", "correct": "Dark Purple", "options": ["Light Green", "Light Purple", "Dark Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDark Purple.\n\n\tThe water, although it looks like it is an endless abyss at parts, is a very dark shade of purple, almost a dark plum.  The dark of the purple really adds to the spook factor of the whole level.  Dark water is a little mysterious, and this level is a mysterious place.  Thanks to silentdogood for this question. \n"}, {"text": "How many keys do you pick from the Contessa's pocket?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Three", "One", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tAlthough you pick her pocket three times total, only two of these are keys.  The last one is the patrol schedule.  Before you can pick her pocket, however, you must fight off her guards one at a time.  Make sure they don't see you, or the Contessa will come running and you will fail your mission. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a security number you take a photo of?", "correct": "643", "options": ["459", "314", "707"], "explanation": "\n\n\n643.\n\n\tYou must take a picture of four different security codes for Bentley.  The four are 459, 314, 417, and 707.  They won't always appear in this order.  It depends on which alarm you head to first. \n"}, {"text": "How many total wheels must one turn when reversing the lightning rods magnetic force?", "correct": "Fifteen", "options": ["Five", "What Lightning Rods?", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFifteen.\n\n\tYou must turn a total of fifteen wheels, three wheels on five different lightning rods.  Once you have successfully turned all wheels once, the magnetic force of the rods will reverse and destroy the Contessa's giant attack robot.  Believe Bentley when he tells you the giant water tower is really an attack robot. \n"}, {"text": "What IQ does one need to crack the Contessa's vault code?", "correct": "140", "options": ["145", "150", "155"], "explanation": "\n\n\n140.\n\n\tBentley, being the cocky brains of the team, tells Sly the Contessa is very smart, and you need an IQ of at least 140 to crack it.  Of course, he cracks it with ease, showing that his IQ is much higher than that. \n"}, {"text": "What color smoke comes from the little spiders the werewolves shoot out to attack you?", "correct": "Green", "options": ["What smoke?", "Red", "Grey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen.\n\n\tEach miniature spider turns to green smoke when they jump, attack, blow up, get whacked, or simply appear.  Some jump on you to attack, some are bombs that blow up, and others don't do anything. \n"}, {"text": "Do you ever fight the Contessa herself in this level?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAlthough she does lay eggsacs with a spider in it for you to fight, you never actually fight the Contessa.  You are chasing her and fighting her miniature spider bombs as you go.  Don't try to avoid them, because they will chase you at a very fast speed and blow you up. \n"}, {"text": "In the end video, how many marshmallows is Bentley roasting?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["One", "Two", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tBentley is attempting to roast marshmallows, failing miserably.  His marshmallows became scorched.  Having saved the whole team by himself, Murray let Bentley drive the Gang's van.  He has driven it before, when Sly and Murray were captured at the end of \"The Predator Awakes\".  To drive it, though, he had to learn how to use a stick shift. \n"}]}
