According to Radar, has anyone been wounded in the bombing?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAs a matter of fact, Radar reports three people wounded.  The 4077th has also lost its generator and its water tank.  Despite these facts, the officer on the phone with Radar insists, in a very condescending tone, that there is no bombing in the area.
