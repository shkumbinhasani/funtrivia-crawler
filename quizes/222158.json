{"id": "222158", "name": "Log Homes Quiz | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "  Homes & Gardens"], "questions": [{"text": "There are basically two kinds of log homes: hand-crafted and milled. Which is NOT a difference between the two?", "correct": "Hand-crafted homes take longer to erect on site", "options": ["Hand-crafted homes are generally more expensive per square foot", "The logs for hand-crafted homes are individually shaped by hand; milled homes are shaped by machine", "Hand-crafted homes look more rustic and individual; milled homes look more uniform"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHand-crafted homes take longer to erect on site.\n\n\tHand-crafted homes are built from logs that are shaped to fit together by hand. As the logs are shaped, the entire structure of the house, called a \"shell,\" is actually built, much like a set of Lincoln Logs! When all of the logs are finished and assembled, they are numbered so they can be reassembled. The shell is then taken apart and trucked to its new location. Since all of the cutting and shaping is already done, the shell can be erected very quickly - usually in just a day or two!\r In contrast, the logs for milled homes are prepared in a factory, and are rarely assembled beforehand. They generally take longer to assemble on-site, as openings for windows and doors, drilling for electrical and so on are usually done on-site. \n"}, {"text": "What species of tree would NOT likely be used to build a log home?", "correct": "Walnut", "options": ["Western red cedar", "Lodgepole pine", "Douglas fir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalnut.\n\n\tMost trees used to build log homes are conifers - evergreens like pines, spruces, firs and cedars. They tend to be trees that produce long, straight logs that are relatively light and easy to work with. Hardwoods are rarely used for log home building as they rarely grow straight to the lengths required for log homes, and they are heavy and expensive. \n"}, {"text": "When you buy a handcrafted log package from a log home company, what is the most common package that you will receive?", "correct": "All the logs for the walls, joists, rafters, etc. - basically, the outside and skeleton of the house", "options": ["All of the house except for the roof", "The whole house assembled for you", "All of the house except for the interior fixtures and flooring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll the logs for the walls, joists, rafters, etc. - basically, the outside and skeleton of the house\n\n\tMost handcrafted companies are in the business of working with logs, not with general construction. They supply the logwork; it's up to you or your general contractor to finish the house. Many companies do offer contractor services to finish your house, but it's not their primary business. \n"}, {"text": "Many log homes have a material between each log, used to prevent gaps between logs and seal the house. This material is visible as stripes between the logs. What is this material called?", "correct": "Chinking", "options": ["Grouting", "Epoxy", "Putty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChinking.\n\n\tToday's chinking is a flexible material that expands and contracts with the house. Chinking is most often used with milled homes. \n"}, {"text": "How does the insulation capability of log homes compare to conventional homes?", "correct": "Due to the high thermal mass of the logs, they are as good as or better than conventional homes", "options": ["Poorer than conventional homes; wood is not a good insulator", "Only as good if there is insulation between each course of logs", "Much better than any conventional home, wood is a much better insulator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDue to the high thermal mass of the logs, they are as good as or better than conventional homes.\n\n\tWood isn't great insulation, and if you were to judge the thermal performance of a log home by R value (the standard measure of insulation performance by thermal resistance) alone, you would be misled. Logs, unlike insulation, have high thermal mass - they store up heat. Think of  a boulder, sitting in the sun, on a warm day. Even after the sun goes down, the boulder will continue to radiate heat. Logs work in much the same way. \n"}, {"text": "All log homes will settle after they are built.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSettling is a natural consequence of log homes, and their design must take account of this natural occurrence. As an example, gaps will be left above doors and windows, concealed by molding, to allow settling of the logs without deforming of doors or cracking of windows. Kiln-dried milled-log homes settle less than handcrafted homes of green wood, but all log homes will settle to some extent. \n"}, {"text": "When creating the log walls for a hand-crafted home, the logworker cuts and shapes the bottom of each log to fit exactly over the top of the log below it. What is this process called?", "correct": "Scribing", "options": ["Shaping", "Molding", "Planing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScribing.\n\n\tHand-scribing creates log walls that fit together tightly without the benefit of chinking. It also allows logs that are not of uniform width to be used. \n"}, {"text": "Log homes generally cost less to build than conventional homes.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLog homes usually cost somewhat more to build than a conventional home, with milled homes being cheaper and handcrafted homes being more expensive. In the United States, a low-end estimate for the complete cost of building a log home is $80-120.00 per square foot. Log homes require more labor than conventional homes, usually are produced from a custom plan rather than a \"cookie-cutter\"-type subdivision house plan, and are generally finished using high-end material like natural stone and hardwood floors rather than vinyl and stucco. \n"}, {"text": "Log homes are never built from green (freshly-cut) wood; all wood must be well-seasoned and dry before being used in construction.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tGreen wood is often used in the construction of hand-crafted homes. An experienced woodworker will be able to shape and manage the logs to avoid any problems that might arise from the drying of the wood, such as splits and cracking. \n"}, {"text": "What is the most important thing log home owners must be concerned with in maintaining their homes?", "correct": "Keeping water off the outside walls", "options": ["Staining and sealing the logs every year", "Yearly termite treatments", "Woodpeckers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeeping water off the outside walls.\n\n\tWater on the walls invites rot and fungus. Most log homes are built with large roof overhangs to prevent much water damage.\r Log homes only need to be stained and sealed every 3-5 years. Termites aren't any more of a problem for log homes than for conventional ones, as long as no logs touch the ground. Woodpeckers can be a problem for some homeowners, but certainly aren't a top threat! \n"}]}
