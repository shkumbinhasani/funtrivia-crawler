You are required to find 30 bottles with clues in them.  You never know what the clues are, but Bentley uses them to crack the code for the vault.  Inside is something you can use.  You can access Dimitri's office through a window above a small cafe.  Don't worry if you do not have all the bottles when you first go to Dimitri's office.  You can always go back. \n"}, {"text": "Which two colors are Dimitri's boat?", "correct": "Teal and red", "options": ["White and red", "Blue and red", "Cream and red"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeal and red.\n\n\tThe boat is always there throughout the level, and never moves.

How many keys are on this piano?", "correct": "Fifty-one", "options": ["Eighty-eight", "Sixty-four", "Twelve"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFifty-one.\n\n\tThere are a total of 51 keys, with 11 black and 40 white.  The piano is located in the same room as the two guitars and the drum.  You must fight a bunch of rats before moving on.  The piano is right next to where you must go in the air vent to Dimitri's office. \n"}, {"text": "What did the sign on the generator say?", "correct": "Please do not blow up generator", "options": ["Please do not turn off generator", "Please do not touch generator", "Please do not fall in generator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlease do not blow up generator.\n\n\tThis is quite a funny sign that was put up.  You get the best view when you take recon photos in the beginning of the level.  The generator is what powers Dimitri's money making machine, using the Clockwerk tailfeathers. \n"}, {"text": "The sign on the generator was signed by whom?", "correct": "The MGMT", "options": ["Greasy Sweet", "None of these", "Dimitri"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe MGMT.\n\n\tThe MGMT signed the note, asking people not to blow up the generator.  The stuff inside the generator is pink, and is in a giant glass container.  Blowing up the generator would make a big mess and would stop the process of Dimitri's money-making scheme. \n"}, {"text": "What color is Dimitri's tongue?", "correct": "Green", "options": ["Blue", "Red", "Pink"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen.\n\n\tHis green tongue can first be seen when you ring the bell on his boat.  They show a snapshot of him, and you must follow him.  Dimitri used to be a young art student who wanted the world to love his new way of making art.  When nobody liked his art technique, he started forging art pieces to show the world what he could do.  He is a heavy smoker.  You will never find him without a cigarette, until \"Sly 3\" when he is on your team. \n"}, {"text": "Which famous piece of art did Sly take from Dimitri's office, then replacing it with a portrait of himself?", "correct": "The Scream", "options": ["None of the above", "Mona Lisa", "Starry Night"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Scream.\n\n\tSly replaced \"The Scream\" with one of his own paintings.  \"The Scream\" was painted by Edvard Munch in 1893.  Sly and his gang sold this painting for big bucks back at the safehouse, if you get it there undamaged. \n"}, {"text": "How many fan control keys must you collect before being able to walk on the fans?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Five", "Four", "Seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tThese six keys are in the pockets of flashlight guards.  The flashlight guards are the most dangerous.  They are giant boars.  Make sure you do not fight them before you get the keys, because the keys are very fragile and you will fail your mission if you destroy a guard before collecting his key. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the gang starts the final operation in this level?", "correct": "Bentley", "options": ["Murray", "Sly", "Dimitri"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBentley.\n\n\tBentley, the brains, begins the final operation to destroy Dimitri's money-making machine and take the Clockwerk tailfeathers.  Bentley's markers on the screen are green, Murray's are pink, and Sly's are blue.  This can come in very helpful when you cannot see the faces at the end of the marker.  The green marker starts this mission, which is Bentley's. \n"}, {"text": "The tip of the Eiffel Tower is which of the following colors?", "correct": "Blue", "options": ["Yellow", "Red", "Gold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue.\n\n\tIt is aqua blue, to be more exact.  Even the little souveniers on each table have an aqua tip.  The souvenier tables are great to hide under when you are heard by a guard and they come to investigate.  However, never use these when the guard has SEEN you.  They will be able to see you crawl under the table, and they destroy the table.  If it is a flashlight guard, you will be right in his light, so it would be beneficial to run as fast as you can.  Thanks to silentdogood for this answer as well. \n"}]}
