{"id": "222361", "name": "Hardest \"Super Mario RPG\" Party Members Trivia Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Mario Games", "Super Mario RPG"], "questions": [{"text": "Mario is the main character in the game, so therefore he's the first party member.  What special move does Mario start out with?", "correct": "Jump", "options": ["Hammer", "Glove Smack", "Fire Orb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJump.\n\n\tJump only uses three FP (Flower Points), so it's the most efficient attack that deals quite a bit of damage.  Early in the game, this attack is quite handy, but later on, you'll get moves like Fire Orb, Super Jump, and Ultra Jump.  Mario also uses a hammer, but it's an equippable item first found on Mushroom Way.  Like usual, you can also get upgrades for your equippable items.  The Hammer also comes in Super Hammer, Ultra Hammer, and Masher versions. \n"}, {"text": "Where is the first location where you can control Mario?", "correct": "Bowser's Keep", "options": ["Mario's Pad", "Vista Hill", "Mushroom Kingdom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowser's Keep.\n\n\tIn the very beginning of the game, Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool and takes her to his keep just north of Mario's Pad.  Mario immediately takes action and follows them.  You can control Mario as soon as he enters the castle, and your first boss battle can be against Bowser himself.  In the beginning, Mario only has 20 HP, he's unarmed, and he only has the Jump attack, but with some strategy, there's no way you can fail in Bowser's Keep (the first time you're in it).  Mario later returns to Bowser's Keep, but not until the last bit of the game where he has six of the seven stars. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Mario first meet Mallow?", "correct": "Mushroom Kingdom", "options": ["Tadpole Pond", "Bandit's Way", "Nimbus Land"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMushroom Kingdom.\n\n\tWhen Mario goes to the Chancellor with news of the giant sword and Princess Toadstool's unknown whereabouts, he leaves the castle and finds Mallow being robbed.  Mario lets Mallow tag along in order to get the stolen item (a Frog Coin) back from the thief, Croco, so you head to Bandit's Way.  This Frog Coin is used to buy a Cricket Pie from the shop in Mushroom Kingdom. This pie will get you a Froggiestick from Frogfucius when the time comes.  You'll learn from Frogfucius that Mallow isn't really a tadpole (although he thinks he is), and you go on a quest to find his real parents who are actually the rulers of Nimbus Land. \n"}, {"text": "Which is not one of Mallow's special attacks?", "correct": "Mute", "options": ["Snowy", "Psychopath", "Shocker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMute.\n\n\tMute is actually one of Princess Toadstool's special attacks.  Psychopath only uses one Flower Point, but if you're lucky, not only can you discover an enemy's remaining HP, but you can understand their thoughts.  Mallow's Shocker move will strike one enemy with a powerful bolt of lightning while Snowy will attack all members of the enemy party.  You can charge Snowy using the control pad, but the other two Mallow moves can't be charged. \n"}, {"text": "Geno took the form of a doll owned by which character?", "correct": "Gaz", "options": ["Princess Toadstool", "Raini", "Frogfucius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGaz.\n\n\tWhen Mario enters the inn in Rose Town for the first time, he'll meet Gaz and her mother who owns the inn.  Gaz will be playing with her Mario, Bowser, and Princess Toadstool dolls and you'll be asked to play with her.  When Mario uses the Bowser doll, Gaz brings out her Geno doll and accidentally shoots Mario (with a 'shooting star attack' and knocks him unconscious. While Gaz and her mother take Mario upstairs, a star-like being will insert itself into the Geno doll and grow bigger, then it will leave the inn.  Mario runs into Geno again in the Forest Maze and battles with him for the first time against Bowyer who guards the second star. Geno will then tell his story about being a guardian of the Star Road which grants dreams.  Geno will then join your party in order to retrieve the Seven Stars. \n"}, {"text": "Which is not one of Geno's equippable items throughout the game?", "correct": "Masher", "options": ["Lazy Shell", "Hand Gun", "Double Punch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMasher.\n\n\tMasher is actually one of Mario's equippable items which is extremely powerful.  It can only be found in Booster's Tower.  The Lazy Shell can be equipped by anybody in your party and it has the highest defensive powers in the game (although it decreases your attack powers drastically).  Hand Gun and Double Punch are two of Geno's earlier weapons in the game and they can be bought in some of the earlier stores. \n"}, {"text": "Bowser is the fourth member to join your party.  What option is added to your X-button menu when Bowser joins the gang?", "correct": "Switch", "options": ["Power", "Map", "Team"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwitch.\n\n\tSince you can only have three members of your party fighting at one time, you will acquire the 'Switch' option as soon as you receive your fourth member, Bowser.  When using this option, you can never switch Mario because he is the main character, but you can always switch the other four and place them in any order you choose.  The Map option is added to your list when you receive a map from the Chancellor of Mushroom Kingdom early in the game. \n"}, {"text": "What is Bowser's only Special Ability when you first get him into your party?", "correct": "Terrorize", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerrorize.\n\n\tTerrorize is only used to scare some weaker enemies away from battle.  Bowser has this ability before you even start using him and it requires six Flower Points to use.  Bowser's other Special Skills include Poison Gas which obviously poisons enemies, Crusher which damages all enemies, and his final attack Bowser Crush which (at the cost of sixteen FP) will damage all enemies. \n"}, {"text": "Princess Toadstool is the fifth party member in the game.  Which character does she nearly get married to?", "correct": "Booster", "options": ["Bowser", "Mario", "Yardovich"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBooster.\n\n\tWhen Mario finds Princess Toadstool on the highest balcony of Booster Tower, Booster rushes her up Booster Hill to Marrymore in order to get married to her in the wedding chapel.  Before the ceremony, Mario stops the wedding and fights an evil wedding cake before taking her back to Mushroom Kingdom.  When you leave the castle, Princess Toadstool will fly from her bedroom window to the ground with her Parasol and join the party. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Princess Toadstool's sole Special Ability which directly damages the enemy?", "correct": "Psych Bomb", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPsych Bomb.\n\n\tThis attack is learned at level eighteen, and while it has high FP usage (it costs 15 FP to use), it's pretty good.  Other than this, the princess can also heal members of the party with Therapy, Group Hug, and Come Back, and alter the status of enemies with Mute and Sleepy Time.  Although she isn't too powerful with physical damage (after all, she uses a parasol and her gloves as weapons), she's good as a healer for the party. \n"}]}
