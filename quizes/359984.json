Name the binary compound Na2S.", "correct": "Sodium Sulphide", "options": ["Sodium Sulphate", "Disodium Sulphate", "Sodium Sulphur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSodium Sulphide.\n\n\tSodium sulphide is used in the production of paper, and can be found in OTC ingrown toenail relief products. It can cause skin burns if in contact with humans.\r Naming binary compounds is the easiest in chemical nomenclature. Simply state the metal first, then the non-metal with the last suffix of \"-ide\" instead of its normal suffix. Oxidation numbers represent the charge (or charges) for an element. Here are some other binary compounds:\r Li3P - Lithium Phosphide\rCaCl2 - Calcium Chloride\rNaF - Sodium Floride \n"}, {"text": "Some metals have multiple oxidation numbers. For example, determine the formula of Ferrous chloride or Iron (II) chloride.", "correct": "FeCl2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFeCl2.\n\n\tIron (II) chloride is used in water treatment to reduce chromates in the water.\r The most common way to distinguish which oxidation state is to either put the number in Roman numerals between the two elements. The other way used in this example is only valid for those with exactly two oxidation numbers. Use the Latin word for iron, and add the suffix -ous or -is depending on whether it is the lower or higher of the two oxidation numbers, respectively. \r SnCl2 - Tin (II) Chloride OR stannous chloride\rPb3N4 - Lead (TV) Nitride OR plumbic nitride\rFeBr3 - Iron (III) Bromide OR ferric bromide \n"}, {"text": "When naming covalent compounds, the prefix system is used. CCl4 is a covalent compound, so how is it named using the prefix system?\n\n", "correct": "Carbon Tetrachloride", "options": ["Carbon Chloride", "Monocarbon Chloride", "Carbonochloride"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarbon Tetrachloride.\n\n\tCCl4 is used by stamp collectors to reveal watermarks without damaging the stamp. It has previously been used in lava lamps and fire extinguishers. It can also be called tetrachloromethane in organic chemistry.\r Mono can be eliminated when dealing with the first of the two elements. Along with changing the second element's suffix to -ide, both elements need to have the correct prefix in front. These are the prefixes used:\r 1- Mono  2- Di 3- Tri 4- Tetra 5-Penta 6-Hexa 7-Hepta 8-Octa 9-Nona 10-Deca \r Here are some other compounds that follow these rules:\rDinitrogen Pentoxide -N2O5\rSelenium Hexaoxide - SeO6\rChlorine Dioxide - ClO2 \n"}, {"text": "Not just revolutionaries, in chemistry radicals are fragmentary covalent compounds with one or more unpaired electrons. Name the \"revolutionary\" ClO3.", "correct": "Chlorate", "options": ["Chloaoxide", "Chlorical", "Trichloride Oxygen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChlorate.\n\n\tChlorate is a powerful oxidizer, and were once used in pyrotechnics. They are unstable when combined with combustible substances, so now perchlorates are used in fireworks.\r Radicals can also gain and lose electrons. For each situation, these are the changes:\r +1 oxygen: add prefix \"per\" (ClO4, perchlorate)\r-1 oxygen: use suffix \"ite\" (ClO2, chlorite)\r-2 oxygen: use suffix \"ite\" and prefix \"hypo\" (ClO, hypochlorite) \n"}, {"text": "The oxyacid HNO3 is formed when H+ ions are added to a radical. (NO3). Name the acid.", "correct": "Nitric Acid", "options": ["Hydronitric Acid", "Hydroxide Acid", "Nitrogen Trioxide Acid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNitric Acid.\n\n\tThe most common use of nitric acid is in rocket fuel, and fertilizer. Nitric acid is used in woodworking to artificially age pine and maple wood. It is a very corrosive liquid as well. \r The number of oxygens can vary in oxyacids, but in its original form the suffix -ic is added to the root of the middle element to name it. Here is the nomenclature for each outcome:\r +1 Oxygen...add perfix \"per\" (HNO4, pernitric acid)\r-1 Oxygen...use suffix \"ous\" instead of \"ic\" (HNO2, nitrous acid)\r-2 Oxygen...use preifx \"hypo\" and suffix \"ous\" (HNO, hyponitrous acid) \n"}, {"text": "Many metals bond with radicals like they do with non-metals, using similar nomenclature. Name Al2(SO4)3.", "correct": "Aluminium Sulphate", "options": ["Alumnium Sulphoxide", "Aluminum Sulphide", "Dialuminum Trisulphate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAluminium Sulphate.\n\n\tAluminum sulphate is used to lower the pH of garden soil, and can be found in water purification. It has been the subject of controversy, as small traces are found in baking soda. Concerns have been raised over having aluminum in the diet.\r Naming salts with radicals, are the same as normal ionic compounds, except the radical is left as is, and the suffix does not change. The radical naming rules also has to be correct as well. If it was SO3, than it would be sulphite, not sulphate, its general radical. The metal is left in its normal name.  Some other radicals\r Mg(ClO3)2 - Magnesium Chlorate\rMg(IO)2 - Magnesium Hypoiodite\rCa3(PO4)2- Calcium Phosphate \n"}, {"text": "Binary acids are composed of hydrogen, and a non-metal, and dissolved in water. Name the binary acid HBr(aq).\n", "correct": "Hydrobromic Acid", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHydrobromic Acid.\n\n\tHydrobromic Acid is used mostly in chemistry, to form different forms of compounds.  \r Naming binary acids is also quite easy, as the hydro- is used to indicate hydrogen, and the root of the non-metal is included. The second word is always \"acid\". To top it of add the suffix \"-ic\" is put on the end. For example.\r HI(aq) - Hydroiodic Acid\rHCl(aq) - Hydrochloric Acid\rHF(aq) - Hydrofluoric Acid\r Note: Binary acids are formed once dissolved in water. HBr is hydrogen bromide if no water is present. \n"}, {"text": "Peroxides are normal binary compounds, where oxygen is the non-metal, with one extra oxygen. Which of these is an example of a peroxide?", "correct": "K2O2", "options": ["LiO", "Al2O3", "Mg2O"], "explanation": "\n\n\nK2O2.\n\n\tPotassium peroxide is formed when potassium reacts in air with oxygen. There are not any common uses of the compound.\r Note - With peroxides, the subscripts are not reduced. (in this case, to KO).\r Naming peroxides is the normal cation (or metal) plus peroxide. Potassium Oxide is K20 (as oxygen has a charge of -1, and potassium's is +1) Here are some peroxide examples.\r H2O2 - Hydrogen Peroxide\rMg2O3 - Magnesium Peroxide \n"}, {"text": "Acid salts are formed when metals react with oxyacids. Unlike other forms of nomenclature, they can be named two ways. The compound NaHCO3 is both sodium bicarbonate, and sodium hydrogen carbonate.\n", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tNaHCO3 is baking soda, and has been used an antacid to reduce heartburn. Toothpastes, shampoos, deodorant and mouthwashes each contain it.\r As usual, the metal is named first with its regular name. If only one hydrogen is in the compound, either \"bi\" can be added to the name of the radical (carbonate), or the word hydrogen can be placed in the middle. If multiple hydrogens are in the compound, there is only one method. \"Dihydrogen\" is placed in the middle between the metal and the radical. Having three or more hydrogens are impossible in these compounds. For example:\r KH2PO3 - Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate\rCa(HSO3)2 - Calcium Bisulfite OR Calcium Hydrogen Sulfite \n"}, {"text": "Hydrates are ionic compounds with water attached. Name the compound LiBr > 3 H2O.", "correct": "Lithium Bromide Trihydrate", "options": ["Lithium Bromide Liquid", "Lithium Bromide Triwater", "Lithium Bromide Triaqua"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLithium Bromide Trihydrate.\n\n\tLithium bromide has been used as a sedative, but was stopped in 1940 after being linked to deaths. It was used to treat bipolar disorder. As a hydrate, it has no uses.\r The numerical prefixes used when naming hydrates are the same as the ones used in covalent compounds. The compound is named using normal bonding rules. The prefix is added to \"-hydrate\", and placed on the end of the name. Here are some more examples.\r CuSO4 > 2 H2O - Copper Sulphate Dihydrate\rNa2O > 5 H2O - Sodium Oxide Pentahydrate \n"}]}
