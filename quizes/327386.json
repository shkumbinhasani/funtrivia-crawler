{"id": "327386", "name": "The Music of \"Glee\" 4 Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Glee"], "questions": [{"text": "To explain the working of the ballad in the episode \"Ballad\", what song do Will and Rachel perform a duet to in rehearsal?", "correct": "Endless Love", "options": ["I Got You Babe", "You Don't Bring Me Flowers", "Ebony & Ivory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEndless Love.\n\n\tNew Directions takes on their assignment of the week, the ballad, as one is required for Sectionals.  Will's plan is to split everyone off into pairs, forcing them to sing a duet and ballad for themselves.  When Matt is unable to attend rehearsal for the week, Rachel is inadvertently paired with Mr. Schuester and they decide to demonstrate the ballad, as a form, to the class.  Rachel chooses Diana Ross and Lionel Richie's \"Endless Love\", during which she ends up following Will around the piano giving eyes that freak him out...and a crush develops.\r\"Endless Love\" appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\" and was released as a single.  It reached a peak of #78 on the 'Billboard Hot 100' charts before falling back off. \n"}, {"text": "When does Finn decide to perform the song \"You're Having My Baby\" during the \"Ballad\" episode?", "correct": "During dinner with Quinn's parents", "options": ["During Glee Club rehearsal", "During football practice", "On a date with Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuring dinner with Quinn's parents.\n\n\tFinn, needing to express how he feels to Quinn about their baby, decides to break the ice with Quinn's parents during dinner and sings Paul Anka's \"You're Having My Baby\" to show his emotions.  Unfortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Fabray catch on and decide that Quinn can no longer stay in their house.  She takes up residence in Finn's house until she can do something about her situation.  Performing the song during dinner was an idea conceived by Kurt, Finn's ballad partner for the week.\rWhile \"You're Having My Baby\" was a single from \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\", it failed to appear on any music chart becoming the first single released from the show's soundtracks to do so. \n"}, {"text": "Who does not sing in the version of \"Lean On Me\" performed in the end of the \"Ballad\" episode?", "correct": "Quinn", "options": ["Kurt", "Rachel", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn.\n\n\tTo show their support for Quinn and Finn in their time of troubles, the rest of New Directions bands together to sing \"Lean On Me\" as a surprise in the common room.  Sitting them down next to the piano, the group takes turns singing the lyrics of this Bill Withers classic.\r\"Lean On Me\" was the highest charting song for the episode.  Appearing on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\", the single reached a peak of #50 on the 'Billboard Hot 100'.  It would ultimately be the highest reaching single for the album (on the American charts at least). \n"}, {"text": "\"Bootylicious\" was performed by New Directions in the episode known as \"Hairography\"?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\t\"Bootylicious\", originally performed by Destiny's Child, was performed by the Glee Club from the Jane Adams Academy, a school for delinquent teenage girls.  When Will discovers that Sue may have been leaking the New Directions setlist to other competitors, he heads to speak to Ms. Hitchens, the Glee Club instructor for said school.  Discovering that this was not the case, he invites her club to perform in the McKinley High School auditorium and they end up giving their rendition of this song.  Will, who is kind of worried about the performance's finesse, is assured by Rachel that they use nothing but a smoke and mirrors technique known as 'Hairography'.  He's not quite assured though.\r\"Bootylicious\" did not appear on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\" nor did it show on the 'Billboard' charts after its release as a single. \n"}, {"text": "The Haverbrook School of the Deaf performs which John Lennon classic for the New Directions kids in \"Hairography\"?", "correct": "Imagine", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nImagine.\n\n\tTo make things fair, Will is forced to let the Haverbrook School of the Deaf perform for the kids in New Directions (and vice versa) and he tries his own hairography number by mashing up Beyonce's \"Crazy in Love\" and the theme from \"Hair\".  It doesn't do too well and when the kids from Haverbrook produce a raw performance of John Lennon's \"Imagine\", the kids decide to join in, learn the sign language, and sing along.\r\"Imagine\" reached a climax of #67 on the 'Billboard Hot 100' and appeared in \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\" while the \"Crazy in Love/Hair\" mash-up sort of fizzled out. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of New Directions leads the Glee Club through a rendition of \"True Colors\" in the end of \"Hairography\"?", "correct": "Tina", "options": ["Rachel", "Kurt", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTina.\n\n\tTina, in her first solo song since \"Tonight\" from the show's fourth episode, is put front-and-center for the episode's final song.  Realizing that the kids shouldn't need to rely on theatrics and smoke and mirrors for their performances to be stellar, he strips their music down to vocals, sits them in seats on the stage, and tells them that \"True Colors\" is their newest Sectionals setlist possibility.  While the rest of the club provides back-up vocals, Tina is the lead singer.\r\"True Colors\", originally performed by Cyndi Lauper, reached #66 on the 'Billboard Hot 100' and appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\". \n"}, {"text": "In the episode \"Mattress\", the kids in New Directions perform \"Jump\" for which of these events?", "correct": "A commercial", "options": ["A concert", "A news special", "Rehearsal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA commercial.\n\n\tRachel, while posing for a school photo for Glee Club, is able to snag acting roles for herself and the others in New Directions in a local commercial for a mattress store.  Everyone excited with the idea, they arrive and spice up the commercial with a song and dance to Van Halen's \"Jump\" on the store's mattresses.  The store owner is thrilled and sends them a stack of mattresses as a thank you, but this inevitably puts Will's role as Glee Club director in jeopardy.\r\"Jump\" was one of three songs from the episode to appear on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\" although none of them charted in the U.S. \n"}, {"text": "During \"Sectionals\", who performed the first song of New Directions' setlist?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["All of these", "Mercedes", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tHaving been forced to resign as Glee Club coach, Will is unable to help the kids during \"Sectionals\".  When the kids discover that their setlist was leaked to the other two performing schools, they must band together quickly to make it work.  Mercedes, who was originally supposed to sing the first song, a rendition of Jennifer Hudson's version of \"And I'm Telling You I Am Not Going\", says that Rachel is the best option for their ballad performance.  Rachel sings and performs her version of \"Don't Rain on My Parade\", Barbra Streisand's popular song from \"Funny Girl\" before introducing New Directions on stage.\r\"Don't Rain on My Parade\" appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\" and took position #53 on the 'Billboard Hot 100'.  \"And I'm Telling You I Am Not Going\" reached #94. \n"}, {"text": "What Rolling Stones song do the kids of New Directions perform during \"Sectionals\"?", "correct": "You Can't Always Get What You Want", "options": ["(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", "Sympathy for the Devil", "Gimme Shelter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou Can't Always Get What You Want.\n\n\tFinn, who had doubts that he should ever return to Glee Club after the truth about Quinn's baby was revealed to him, shows up before New Directions is set to perform and suggests \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" as a replacement for \"Don't Stop Believin'\" which was performed by the kids from Haverbrook.  The song is one of three performed by New Directions (though only two are shown since the third, presumably, is \"Somebody to Love\") to win them the first place prize at Sectionals.\r\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" reached a peak of #71 on the 'Billboard Hot 100' and appeared as a single from \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\".  The entire Glee Club performs the song. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Sectionals\", who does not participate in the version of \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" at the end of the episode?", "correct": "Will", "options": ["Finn", "Rachel", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill.\n\n\tThe final song of the first thirteen episodes, \"My Life Would Suck Without You\", originally performed by Kelly Clarkson, was the kids' way of thanking Mr. Schuester and giving him a treat as he was unable to attend Sectionals to see them win.  While Rachel does most of the vocals for the song, the group performs some homages to dances from past episodes.  The kids sing alongside Will's search for Emma before she leaves the school.  He finally finds her at the end of the song and kisses her.\r\"My Life Would Suck Without You\" was the final song to be released from \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 2\".
