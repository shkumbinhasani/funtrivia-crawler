By what 'B' name do we know him?  \n", "correct": "Buddha", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuddha.\n\n\tHis birth name was Guatama Siddhartha, but he was given the title Lord Buddha (which means 'enlightened one').  After having been shocked by his first experiences with poverty, sickness and death, he decided to leave his wife and child and dedicate his life to a spiritual asceticism.  By the way, contrary to popular belief...the Buddha was never fat...he was a monk after all and had no access to hamburgers.  The overweight 'Buddha' that you sometimes see in restaurants is supposed to be Maitreya...the future Boddhisattva. \n"}, {"text": "This man did the dirty work by meticulously observing the orbits of the known planets which his pupil Kepler used to develop his famed three laws of planetary motion.  Who was this Danish astronomer with a cold nose?  \n", "correct": "Tycho Brahe", "options": ["Henry Bessemer", "Walther Bothe", "Niels Bohr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTycho Brahe.\n\n\tTycho Brahe, aside from being one of the first modern astronomers, was also a man with a colorful life.  Once in a duel, much of his nose was severed, and he was forced to wear a metal replacement...which only enhances his fame amongst students of his life and work.  I suppose he could have brought new meaning to the term...digging for gold. \n"}, {"text": "A notorious family from the 15th-16th century - the father managed to become a Pope while his famed son was a ruthless general, and his daughter was known for her various marriages and sexual relationships.  What was their family name?  \n", "correct": "Borgia", "options": ["Bruno", "Botero", "Bernini"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBorgia.\n\n\tRodrigo, the father, became Pope Alexander VI through various machinations.  The son, Cesare, was known to be ruthless but successful in war; he became the model for Machiavelli's 'The Prince'.  The daughter, Lucrezia, was married 3 times during her teens and was said to have committed incest with both her father and brother...what a terrible life!  Though the Borgia name draws up mostly negative connotations, they were known as lavish patrons of the arts, with artists such as Titian and Leonardo and writers such as Ariosto gaining prestige under the Borgia reign. \n"}, {"text": "Relatively unknown to us today, this Italian architect was commissioned by Pope Julius II to draw up design plans for the great St. Peter's in Rome, after the old basilica had been dismantled.  Who was this architect?  \n", "correct": "Bramante", "options": ["Bellini", "Burri", "Bellarmine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBramante.\n\n\tDonato Bramante and the Pope had such lavish plans for the new St. Peter's.

All because one architect dreamed big! \n"}, {"text": "Buonarroti was the surname of which of these artistic greats?  \n", "correct": "Michelangelo", "options": ["Leonardo", "Donatello", "Raphael"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichelangelo.\n\n\tMichelangelo is widely regarded to be the greatest sculptor of all time, I certainly cannot fault such opinions.

Lucien ensured Napoleon's enthronement at the head of the Council of Five Hundred in 1799.  Louis was made king of Holland by Napoleon in 1806, but Napoleon eventually removed him from the post, dissatisfied with his work.  He was the father of Napoleon III.  Caroline was married to Joachim Murat, who was made King of Naples and eventually attempted to become king of all Italy...he was assassinated. Finally, Jerome became king of Westphalia under Napoleon's reign.  Jerome was the last of the siblings to die, doing so in 1860.

What is this great thinker's name?  \n", "correct": "Francis Bacon", "options": ["George Berkeley", "Edmund Burke", "William Beveridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancis Bacon.\n\n\tThough Bacon was one of the greatest minds of his, or any, generation, there is probably no validity to the claims that he authored Shakespeare's work.  Why are people so desperate to discredit Shakespeare anyhow?  Oops...back to Bacon.  The year Bacon became Lord Chancellor, 1618, he was found guilty of taking a bribe from the king.  His political career was over but he continued to write until his death in 1626. \n"}, {"text": "This man's name means 'tiger' in Persian, he was born Zahir ud-din Muhammad, and is best known for founding the Mughal Dynasty in India.
