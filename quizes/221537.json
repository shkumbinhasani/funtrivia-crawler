{"id": "221537", "name": "People in Indigo Girls Lyrics Quiz / Test | Music | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music H-K", "Indigo Girls"], "questions": [{"text": "According to the lyrics of this, one of the Indigo Girls' most popular songs, whose \"head was on the block- the crime was looking up for truth\"?", "correct": "Galileo & Galileo Galilei", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGalileo & Galileo Galilei.\n\n\tGalileo, of course, was the astronomer whose wide-ranging discoveries were the foundations of much of today's science. His arguments that the sun, not the earth, was the center of the solar system, which contradicted Biblical teachings, led to his trial by the Inquisition in 1633. He actually was not executed- a common misconception. Instead, he lived the next 8 years under house arrest, before dying at the age of 77. \"Galileo\" first appeared on the album \"Rites of Passage.\" \n"}, {"text": "Although they did not write the song (it was penned by Buffy Marie Sainte James,)\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" is one of the most powerful performances the Indigo Girls have turned in. The lyrics mention the person many consider to be the martyr of the American Indian Movement (AIM), Leonard Peltier. What other Native American activist do they mention?", "correct": "Anna Mae Aquash", "options": ["Clyde Bellecourt", "Winona LaDuke", "Floyd Red Crow Westerman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnna Mae Aquash.\n\n\t\"My girlfriend Anna Mae\rtalked about uranium\rher head was full of bullets\rand her body dumped\rthe FBI cut off her hands\rand told us she died of exposure\"\r The real story is extremely interesting. Anna Mae Aquash was one of the few female activists in AIM. She was present at the Feb. 1973 incident in Wounded Knee, South Dakota, where over 200 Native American activists attempted to take over the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where they claimed the government was about to sell off the lands for uranium mining. AIM held the reservation for 71 days before surrendering.\r In December of 1975, Anna Mae disappeared. A body was found two months later at the base of a cliff, and the coroner ruled that the person had died of exposure. However, the body was so decomposed that no positive ID could be made, thus the hands were removed and sent to an FBI lab for fingerprint analysis, which showed that they were the hands of Anna Mae. At this point, another autopsy was done, which revealed a bullet hole in the back of her skull.\r For 27 years, her death remained a mystery. Despite the lyrics of this song, the primary theory about her death was that she was suspected of being an undercover agent for the FBI, and had been killed by AIM activists for this reason. Few actually thought that the FBI had killed her.\r The engrossing story of the 27-year attempt to solve the murder  can be found at http://dickshovel.com/annausnews.html. Eventually, two former AIM members were accused of the murder, and, as of 2005, one has been convicted.\r \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" is found in both live and studio versions on the album \"1200 Curfews.\" \n"}, {"text": "The song \"Go\" is an anthem to young activists.
