Who is this English-born science fantasy writer who produced the \"Apprentice Adept\" series and the mammoth \"Xanth\" series? ", "correct": "Piers Anthony", "options": ["Robert Asprin", "Patrick H. Adkins", "K. A. Applegate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPiers Anthony.\n\n\tBorn Piers Anthony Dillingham Jacob in 1934 in the English university city of Oxford, he has published more than 150 novels in a writing career of almost half a century. His first novel, \"Chthon\", published in 1967, was nominated for the 1967 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1968 Hugo Award in the same category.\r Anthony is perhaps best-known for the still-expanding \"Magic of Xanth\" series, which already spans more than 40 books. The series, which was originally supposed to be a trilogy, began in 1977 with \"A Spell for Chameleon\". Geographically, the Xanth world mirrors the U.S. state of Florida, where Anthony now lives, but within it can be found well-known landmarks from around the world. This fantasy universe is populated by humans, each of whom is born with a unique magical ability. You will also come across centaurs, demons, dragons, gargoyles, goblins, nymphs, ogres, zombies and many other weird and wonderful creatures as you travel around this wonderful universe. \n"}, {"text": "Born around 620 B.C., Aesop is perhaps the best-known of all fabulists. In which ancient culture did he live and write?", "correct": "Greek", "options": ["Persian", "Roman", "Egyptian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreek.\n\n\tAesop was an Ancient Greek writer, probably in the historic region of Thrace on the coast of the Black Sea. He was known to have been born a slave, but later became a free man. He was executed by being thrown from a cliff top in the city of Delphi in 564 B.C., although it seems likely that the charges against him were falsified. \r No actual writings by Aesop have survived, and it seems likely that many of the stories credited to him have been added from other cultures over time. The underlying theme of fables credited to Aesop is of animals and various objects that speak and display other human characteristics. \n"}, {"text": "The novels of V.C. Andrews combined family saga with Gothic horror, with stories frequently involving family secrets. Her most famous novel, twice adapted for film and the first instalment in the Dollanganger series, told the story of four children who were imprisoned for three years by their estranged grandmother. What is the title of the novel?  ", "correct": "Flowers in the Attic", "options": ["Down the Wishing Well", "Statues in the Garden", "Babes in the Basement"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlowers in the Attic.\n\n\tBorn Cleo Virginia Andrews in 1923 in Portsmouth, Virginia, she wrote under the names V.C. Andrews and Virginia C Andrews. Written in the first person through the eyes of Cathy Dollanganger, \"Flowers in the Attic\" was a controversial bestseller. More than 40 million copies were sold even though it was banned in numerous places due to the incestuous relationship between two adolescent siblings.  \r Kristy Swanson played Cathy in the 1987 film version, with Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher as the evil grandmother, Olivia Foxworth. In the 2014 adaptation, Ellen Burstyn starred as Olivia with Kiernan Shipka playing Cathy. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps best-known for the \"Helliconia\" trilogy, published in the 1980s, this award-winning science-fiction author was given an OBE for services to literature in the 2005 Queen's Birthday Honours list.

His novels include \"Hothouse\", set in a future Earth which has stopped rotating, \"Greybeard\", set on an Earth where nuclear bomb tests have sterilized the population, and the \"Helliconia\" trilogy, an epic tale set on an Earth-like planet where each season lasts for centuries. \r The winner of a Nebula Award, a John W. Campbell Memorial Award and two Hugo Awards, Aldiss was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2000, he was named as a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America. \n"}, {"text": "Born in Austrian-occupied Bosnia in 1892, he was the Yugoslav ambassador to Germany from 1939 until 1941.

Forster. \r The alternatives are the other three \"A\" authors who won the Nobel Prize in its first 100 years. Although born in Austria-Hungary, Shmuel Yosef Agnon claimed Israeli nationality when he shared the 1966 prize with Sweden's Nelly Sachs.

A barrister by trade, he gave up the legal profession to write when he inherited a fortune. Austin was appointed to the vacant Poet Laureate post after others considered more suitable had either turned it down or been ruled out for non-literary reasons, and there was speculation that his appointment was due to his friendship with and support for Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. Austin was not highly rated by his peers either, and was described as a 'Banjo Byron'. Austin was Poet Laureate for 17 years and was succeeded on his death in 1913 by Robert Bridges.\r Of the alternatives, Richard Aldington was a WWI poet who later wrote an award-winning biography of The Duke of Wellington and a controversial one of Lawrence of Arabia; W.H.

He resigned five years later amid a financial scandal that left him almost bankrupt, but he was saved from financial ruin by the publication of his first novel, \"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less\" (published in 1974 in the US and two years later in the UK). \"Shall We Tell the President?\" in 1977 was followed by the 1979 \"Kane and Abel\" (one of my all-time favourite novels), which topped the 'New York Times' bestseller list and was later made into a TV miniseries by CBS. \r Archer never looked back as an author, and has continued to produce novels that sold in their millions ever since. His personal life has been less of an even road, with highs such as being awarded a Life Peerage as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare in 1992, to lows of a three-year stint at Her Majesty's Pleasure, for perjury and perverting the course of justice, in 2001-03. \n"}]}
