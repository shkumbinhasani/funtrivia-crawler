With the White Witch and the wolves in full pursuit, they have no choice but to traverse this frigtening riverine obstacle.  Happily, they are able to make it across the river safely, with the wolves apparently consumed by the raging river. \n"}, {"text": "Edmund, who has unwillingly accompanied the White Witch in her pursuit of his siblings, is turned to stone when he attempts to steal the White Witch's magic wand.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNo, this is not Edmund's fate.
