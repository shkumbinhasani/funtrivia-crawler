That is perhaps not the best goodbye a family can have.  However, it turned out to be one of the greatest things that could have happened to him, because he was sold into Egypt where he became second in command to Pharaoh himself.\n\nWho was this young mistreated man?", "correct": "Joseph", "options": ["Jacob", "Jeremiah", "Job"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoseph.\n\n\tJoseph was his father's (Jacob) favorite son, which was apparent when he gave Joseph a long coat of many colors, which was not a cheap gift in those days.  Joseph's brothers began to hate him, and wanted to kill him.  Fortunately for Joseph, Reuben suggested instead to sell him as a slave.  They did so, and dipped his coat in blood to make their father believe Joseph had died. The brothers' mission had been achieved, but it turned out for the better for Joseph.  He soon became the second-highest ranking person in Egypt, behind only Pharaoh.  The account of Joseph being sold into slavery by his brothers can be read in the 37th chapter of Genesis. \n"}, {"text": "It might not be easy to leave with a stranger to go marry someone even stranger.  However, this woman did just that.  When Abraham sent Eliezer off to find a wife for Isaac, he found this woman, who decided to go with him to marry Isaac.  The family did not want her to go, but her willingness to leave was a wise choice; she would become an ancestress of Jesus Christ.\n\nWho was the woman?", "correct": "Rebekah", "options": ["Rahab", "Ruth", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRebekah.\n\n\tRebekah was found by Eliezer at a well, where she kindly gave him a drink, and even drew water for his camels.  This was a sign for Eliezer that he would be the wife of Isaac.  She took him to her home, where her family met the man wanting to take Rebekah away from them.  Their response was not so favorable, but Rebekah was willing to leave to marry the unknown man waiting for her elsewhere. She was blessed for her sacrifice, however, and became one of the ancestresses of Jesus Christ (the genealogy of which can be found in Luke chapter 3).  Her story can be found in Genesis, beginning in the 24th chapter. \n"}, {"text": "Abraham and Sarah had a wonderful life with many blessings; they were well off financially.

Abraham and Sarah's story can be read in Genesis chapters 11-26. \n"}, {"text": "Hannah was a childless woman, the wife of Elkanah.  She was so upset about being barren that she went to the temple and wept, praying to God.  If she were to bear a son, she would dedicate him to God.  And that is exactly what she did.
