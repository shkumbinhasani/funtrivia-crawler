Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd are perfect in their roles as Billy Valentine, a street swindler, and Louis Winthorpe, another swindler, but one with a nice suit and fat bank account.  Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy bring some old Hollywood charm with their performances as the Duke brothers. \n"}, {"text": "'A Christmas Story' has simply become a Christmas classic.
