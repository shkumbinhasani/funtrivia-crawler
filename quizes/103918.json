Fill-in-the blank questions can have only ONE possible answer, and questions with two or more possibilities will be rejected. Most riddles have answers that can be written in many ways and thus won't work well as FITBs. For example, you may think the answer is \"mother\", but quizmakers may write that as \"mother\", \"mom\", \"mommy\", \"your mom\", \"your mother\"...it just won't work!\" In addition, many times quizmakers submit very long answers, such as \"The doctor was the mother,\" that can be written in numerous ways as well. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following would be an acceptable question and answer for an FITB riddle question?", "correct": "Q.- I go forever forward, never looking back.

It comes from a quiz that got put online. All of the other answers are from quizzes that never made it online. These answers are totally unsuitable as FITBs, as they can be written in numerous ways and still be correct. \n"}, {"text": "It's a good idea to copy all of the riddles on your quiz from a book or website, so that you don't make any errors.
