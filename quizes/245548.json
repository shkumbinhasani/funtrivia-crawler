{"id": "245548", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Major Fred C. Dobbs' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "This episode opens in the operating room where an agitated Frank Burns lays into one of the nurses for her 'incompetence'.  What nurse is the victim of Frank's frustration?", "correct": "Ginger", "options": ["Baker", "Kellye", "Cutler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGinger.\n\n\tPlayed by Odessa Cleveland, Ginger Bayliss appears in 22 total 'M*A*S*H' episodes, including 11 during the first season.  In this episode, she is the target of Frank Burns' anger, probably in part as a result of the razzing he takes from Hawkeye and Trapper! \n"}, {"text": "In retaliation for his rotten behavior, what dirty trick to Trapper and Hawkeye pull on Frank Burns that prompts the latter to finally request a transfer out of the 4077th?", "correct": "They put his arm in a cast.", "options": ["They shave his hair off.", "They trap him in a wooden box.", "They put his cot in the latrine and lock the door."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey put his arm in a cast.\n\n\tNot only is Frank's arm in a cast, but he has been provided with a very functional hook.  Frank nearly chokes himself while displaying his frustration in Henry's tent. \n"}, {"text": "While pleading his case, Frank Burns brings up several other examples to Henry of the relentless practical jokes pulled on him by Trapper and Hawkeye.  Which fairy tale corresponds with a prank that has been pulled on Major Burns?", "correct": "Princess and the Pea", "options": ["Emperor's New Clothes", "Rapunzel", "Cinderella"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincess and the Pea.\n\n\tThe Princess and the Pea treatment involves stacking 5 cots, one under the other, until Frank is '12 feet' above the ground.  In addition, Hawkeye and Trapper put hamburger in Frank's ear, allowing a dog to nibble away, and they also put Frank's hand in warm water while he sleeps, causing Frank to have a little nocturnal bathroom booboo. \n"}, {"text": "Seemingly unrelated to the developing story, we see Radar entering camp with a horse fully packed with mining tools.  Radar claims to have discovered gold after encountering Hawkeye and Trapper.  What is it actually that he has found?", "correct": "Pyrite", "options": ["Copper", "Silver", "Lead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPyrite.\n\n\tRadar has struck pyrite, iron pyrite to be exact, a gold lookalike.  A classic example of a McGuffin, this scene triggers a later idea in the episode for Hawkeye and Trapper.\r Incidentally, Larry Gelbart claimed that the idea for this episode comes from the fact that Korea is the world's fifth largest gold producer, something pointed out by Radar during the show. \n"}, {"text": "Frank enters Margaret's tent after demanding that Henry transfer him to another M*A*S*H unit.  Hot Lips is in great form, informing Frank that she has ordered what item for his dining pleasure, with extra fat?", "correct": "Pork chops", "options": ["Spare ribs", "Lamb chops", "T-bone steaks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPork chops.\n\n\tOblivious to Frank's previous dealings with Henry, Margaret is in her usual mode.  However, when Frank lets Hot Lips know that he is leaving, she's completely distraught.  Suddenly the pork chops with extra fat seem lean and trivial! \n"}, {"text": "Back in the Swamp, an annoyed Frank packs his things for his impending transfer, but not before attacking Trapper and Hawkeye with various verbal barbs.  What is Hawkeye's retort to Frank's claim that he and Trapper are 'nothing but common drunks'?", "correct": "That is a rumor started by people I've fallen over!", "options": ["Common?  Never!  We are unique drunks!", "Aw Frank, you say such sweet things when you're angry!", "That's not true, we are just uncommon sobers!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat is a rumor started by people I've fallen over!.\n\n\tLittle do Hawkeye and Trapper realize that their shenanigans have upset Henry.  They will soon pay for their overboard antics, well-intentioned as they may have been. \n"}, {"text": "With Frank already requesting a transfer and Hot Lips closely following, Trapper and Hawkeye suddenly find themselves in hot water.  Fortunately, Hawkeye formulates a plan that takes advantage of 'three' basic human emotions.  What are they?", "correct": "Greed, fear and greed", "options": ["Gluttony, cupidity and avarice", "Anger, hostility and more hostility", "Love of money, love of sex and love of fame"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreed, fear and greed.\n\n\tIn Frank's case, the love of money is the root of all evils, thus why Hawkeye says 'greed' twice.  \r Hawkeye and Trapper suddenly find themselves pulling double duty.  Having Frank around doesn't seem so bad at this point.  A plan must be hatched to keep Frank (and Hot Lips, if necessary) at the 4077th! \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye's plan involves convincing Frank that there is gold near the 4077th.  He and Trapper set up an elaborate ruse, enticing Frank to search for gold at the location they reveal while he is feigning sleep.  Hawkeye even leaves a gold token on a table in the Swamp to fool Frank.  Whose tooth filling does Hawkeye use in this instance?", "correct": "Henry", "options": ["Margaret", "Father Mulcahy", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry.\n\n\tPoor Henry, he's writhing in pain with a bad tooth and the Swamp rats are using his filling as bait!  Henry provides great comic relief in this episode, despite his suffering.  \r When Frank discovers the small chunk of gold that is Henry's gold filling, he checks it with his teeth to make sure it's real gold.  How ironic! \n"}, {"text": "That evening, Frank sneaks into Radar's office to take some of the latter's mining equipment.  Radar is sound asleep with his teddy bear, but he wakes up when Frank makes a loud noise.  Frank asks, 'Do you always slept with a teddy bear?'  What is Radar's response?", "correct": "Not when I'm on duty, sir.", "options": ["No, sometimes I sleep with my stuffed tiger.", "That isn't my teddy bear.  I'm holding it for one of the wounded men.", "Yes, it's an experiment the army's doing with some of its corporals."], "explanation": "\n\n\nNot when I'm on duty, sir.\n\n\tThis is the first appearance of Radar's famous teddy bear, which makes its final appearance in the last episode of the show.\r Incidentally, did you know that this episode is named for the Humphrey Bogart character in the classic film 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'? \n"}, {"text": "When it finally becomes obvious to Frank that he has been duped into staying at the 4077th, there is a P.A. announcement about 'tonight's double feature'.  Along with 'The Major is a Minor', what is the other film that is showing?", "correct": "Greed", "options": ["Intolerance", "Repulsion", "The Gold Rush"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreed.\n\n\tAccording to several of the cast members, and even Larry Gelbart himself, this is one of the worst episodes, if not *the* worst, of the series.  However, I find it to be cute, and it has its entertaining moments.  One must simply suspend reality when one watches this episode!\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
