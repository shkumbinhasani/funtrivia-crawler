{"id": "162181", "name": "Hardest The Most Important 'P' People Trivia Quiz | Mixed People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", " Mixed People", " People by Surname"], "questions": [{"text": "This 17th-century genius made a contribution in a number of different scientific and philosophic areas, including geometry, probability and hydrostatics, and invented perhaps the first mechanical calculator in 1642.  Name him.  ", "correct": "Blaise Pascal", "options": ["Paracelsus", "Jean Picard", "William Prout"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlaise Pascal.\n\n\tThough passing away at the rather young age of 39, this French mathematician and physicist managed to make a number of important contributions to human knowledge.  Most importantly, he developed his mechanical calculator, albeit one that did not prove long-lasting.  Nevertheless, it inspired future developers of such instruments.  Pascal also developed theory in connection with probability, and laid the groundwork for Newton and Leibniz's creation of calculus.  Pascal was one of the first scientists to experiment with vacuums and the concept of pressure, which helped him ultimately to invent the syringe and the hydraulic press.  The SI unit of pressure is named in Pascal's honor.  Later in life he turned to philosophical theology, \rwriting his famed 'Pens\u00e9es'...a fascinating read! \n"}, {"text": "Peter the Great is considered by many scholars to be the most influential of Russian tsars.  Early on in his reign as tsar, he took an extended sojourn to western Europe in order to see the effects of modernization in that region.  Which of these did Peter not do during his trip?  ", "correct": "Attended courses on physics at the Sorbonne", "options": ["Worked as a ship's carpenter in Holland", "Labored in the dockyard of the Royal Navy in England", "Studied gunnery in Prussia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttended courses on physics at the Sorbonne.\n\n\tPeter understood that, compared to the industrializing countries of western Europe, his Russia was a relative backwater.  Hence, in 1697-98, with a retinue of 250 people, he made his way through the countries of Europe, all the while developing ideas about modernity.  He took much of what he learnt on his trip and applied it to a modernization program in Russia.  Though his reign could be brutal at times, and included expansion and war as part of its policy of growth, he managed in a rather short time to help Russia make significant advances in developing economically, militarily and politically. \n"}, {"text": "German physicist Max Planck is typically considered to be the father of what modern scientific discipline?  ", "correct": "Quantum mechanics", "options": ["Electromagnetism", "Molecular biology", "Physiology"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuantum mechanics.\n\n\tIn 1900, Planck theorized that the energy of light waves were emitted in small clumps called 'quanta', overthrowing the well-entrenched wave theory.  So few scientists at the time believed Planck that he was considered a charlatan, but soon new research by scientists like Bohr and Einstein helped verify the correctness of Planck's ideas.  His breakthrough was a true Kuhnian moment in the history of science. \n"}, {"text": "Though many of his theories and ideas in the realms of physics and astronomy proved ultimately to be based largely on fallacies, there is little question that the 2nd century AD mathematician Ptolemy of Alexandria deserves a place among the greats whose names begin with 'P'.  His greatest work was called the 'Almagest', but what is his other great work of writing called?  ", "correct": "Geographical Outline", "options": ["Phaenomena", "On Divination", "Phaedo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeographical Outline.\n\n\tPtolemy's masterwork of astronomy was called the 'Almagest', a guide to understanding the known universe.  The 'Almagest' erroneously placed the earth at the center of the universe, a theory that held widespread popularity for the next 1500 years. Ptolemy's 'Geographical Outline' preserves for the modern age a summary of the combined knowledge of the Greeks and Romans in the realm of geography.  The maps within this work are fascinating to behold, particularly the one containing the British isles! \n"}, {"text": "Prior to the 19th century, the most significant work of literature in Europe describing the countries of the Far East was written by the Venetian traveler Marco Polo.  Marco left for China with his father and uncle, both of whom had previously visited the distant East in the prior decade.  What were the names of Marco's father and uncle?  ", "correct": "Niccol\u00f2 and Maffeo", "options": ["Benvenuto and Giorgio", "Diego and Cristoforo", "Amedeo and Rufe\u00f2"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNiccol\u00f2 and Maffeo.\n\n\tNiccol\u00f2 and Maffeo arrived in China in 1266, and returned to Venice three years later.  On their second trip to China they were accompanied by Niccol\u00f2's son Marco.  They reached what is now Beijing in 1275, and Marco remained in China under the service of the current ruler Kublai Khan for nearly 20 years.  After returning to Venice he soon found himself in prison, where he dictated his unbelievable adventures to Rustichiello of Pisa, and later became published in a book called 'Il Milione'.  Marco's fascinating tales were so shocking that many dismissed them as fanciful delusions.  However, others were greatly influenced by Marco's stories, which collectively comprised the best source of knowledge about east Asia during the Renaissance period and indeed all the way until the 19th century. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the most important early proselytizer of the Christian faith, St. Paul, was born in Tarsus, Cilicia, now located in which present-day country?  ", "correct": "Turkey", "options": ["Egypt", "Syria", "Israel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurkey.\n\n\tPaul was born Saul of Tarsus, and was of Jewish birth.  During his younger years he strongly resisted the Christian movement, even going so far as to participate in persecutions.  Later, Paul apparently had a vision on his way to Damascus, and spent the rest of his life doing missionary work and writing portions of what would become the New Testament.  Thanks to his devoted efforts, Christianity spread wildly during the early Roman imperial period. \n"}, {"text": "Plato, along with his pupil Aristotle, laid the groundwork for Greco-Roman philosophy in his writings.  Though we call him Plato (which means 'broad-shouldered'), what was this 5th-4th century BC Greek philosopher's name at birth?  ", "correct": "Aristocles", "options": ["Diaphanes", "Eugertes", "Xenophanes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAristocles.\n\n\tPlato was apparently called by that nickname because he had a 'wrestler's body', but his real name was similar to his pupil's (Aristocles/Aristotle).  Plato's greatest works of philosophy include: 'The Republic', 'Symposium', 'Timaeus and Critias' and others.  Much of his ideas are said to have been derived from his mentor, Socrates. \n"}, {"text": "Largely through the actions of the Spanish explorer and adventurer Francisco Pizarro in the 1530s, which empire was brought under the dominion of Spain?  ", "correct": "Incan Empire", "options": ["Moghul Empire", "Aztec Empire", "Philippine Empire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIncan Empire.\n\n\tWith a force of only 180 men, Pizarro entered the capital city of the Incan Empire, confronting the Emperor Atahualpa.  After having been presented with gifts, Pizarro devised a plan, using the superior fighting ability of his horse-mounted cavalry and the surprise of firearms, to kidnap the emperor.  He managed to do just this while killing several thousand Incan warriors.  These actions destabilized the empire to such a degree that the entire population of 6 million was placed under Spanish submission within 40 years.  For this unbelievable feat, Pizarro, who was later killed by his own men, deserves a place in this quiz. (I must add that, in a normative sense, Pizarro's actions were simply horrid!) \n"}, {"text": "One of the founders of Western science and mathematics was the ancient Greek scholar named Pythagoras.  Born on Samos in the Aegean, he later founded a school in what is now southern Italy.  In which Greek colony of Magna Graecia (southern Italy) did Pythagoras settle?  ", "correct": "Croton", "options": ["Locri", "Syracuse", "Tarentum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCroton.\n\n\tPythagoras had a profound influence on the early history of mathematics, and particularly geometry; so much so that the famous 'Pythagorean Theorum' is still named for him.  The school of thought that Pythagoras founded also changed men's outlooks in the areas of philosophy, physics and astronomy.  For example, Pythagoras was one of the first scientists to predict that the solar system is heliocentric and that the Earth is globe-shaped.  Pythagoras' pupils, including Philolaus and Alcmaeon, also had profound influences on future scholarship.  Their names are cited in the works of Plato and Aristotle, among others. \n"}, {"text": "Last, but not least, we have Louis Pasteur, the famous French biologist.  Which of these was not an accomplishment of the great Pasteur? ", "correct": "Developed techniques for antiseptic surgery", "options": ["Development of the pasteurization process", "Development of an anthrax vaccine", "Developed a technique for inoculating people for rabies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeveloped techniques for antiseptic surgery.\n\n\tPasteur also significantly pressed for the acceptance of the germ theory of disease, and dealt the final blow(s) to the concept of spontaneous generation.  His vaccines for rabies and anthrax helped saved the lives of millions of people (and cows!)  The pasteurization process has made many foods much safer for human consumption, and has helped make Pasteur's name immortal.  I hope you have agreed with most of my 'P' selections, and will forgive me for the omission of individuals such as Paracelsus, St. Peter, Picasso, Philip of Macedon, Pavlov and any others I might have missed.
