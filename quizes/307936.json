The music swells, the cage opens, and she strides onstage. \"You're a superstar / Driving in your car,\" she sings to an enthralled crowd -- and then it all goes horribly wrong. What happens?", "correct": "The stage pyrotechnics set a backup singer on fire.", "options": ["The lead singer collapses onstage.", "A crazed fan fires wildly into the crowd.", "A sandbag falls from above, breaking a backup singer's leg."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe stage pyrotechnics set a backup singer on fire.\n\n\tAs part of the number's complex staging, flash bombs are going off as the backup singers and dancers pass between them. On one of them, however, the timing is off and the explosive charge is double what it should be -- and one of the backup singers is caught in the flames. The fire is put out quickly, but it's something of a showstopper. \n"}, {"text": "In Adelle's office, we learn that Rayna (the singer) is not concerned about the threats to her life -- but her chief of security is. He wants to hire a Doll to protect her, without Rayna realizing it. What role does Echo therefore adopt?", "correct": "Backup singer", "options": ["Choreographer", "Makeup artist", "Documentary filmmaker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBackup singer.\n\n\tIt seems that the pyrotechnics incident that left a job opening for Echo (as the security chief Biz, played by Jim Piddock, rather callously describes it) has not been Rayna's only near-death experience. The musical superstar, portrayed by singer Jaime Lee Kirchner, has received threatening letters from someone styling himself her \"number-one fan\" -- and then there is the matter of the mysterious dropping sandbag at a previous performance. It isn't just random mayhem, either; the malfunctioning pyrotechnic would have caught Rayna instead of her backup singer, if it hadn't been for a last-minute choreography change just before the show.\r To protect Rayna, Echo becomes Jordan, an aspiring singer and dancer with hidden martial arts and tactical skills. The goal is for her to be a deep-undercover bodyguard, protecting Rayna with her life -- without really realizing that she's doing it. \n"}, {"text": "After Echo (now known as Jordan) is hired, she is quickly immersed in the stress and chaos of Rayna's backstage world. In the middle of a dance practice, the music star reveals herself as an extreme diva. What does she complain about?", "correct": "Someone has eaten a mint.", "options": ["The dance floor is made from the wrong kind of bamboo.", "Jordan/Echo's quarter-turn was more of a 20%-turn.", "The left side of Rayna's costume has slightly fewer sequins than the right side."], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomeone has eaten a mint.\n\n\tWhen a pop star like Rayna turns up in a show like this, you have to expect some caricature. Rayna is a professional, running her own dance rehearsals; a perfectionist, insisting on the purity of her artistic vision; and a micro-manager, controlling her staff down to the last breath mint. Jordan/Echo is breathlessly excited to be here (and to be Rayna's new favorite), but even she is a little taken aback by Rayna's behavior -- and by the minute size of the costume she's expected to wear. \n"}, {"text": "FBI agent Paul Ballard is still investigating the Dollhouse, and he's still counting on his informant Lubov to feed him clues. He may be trusting Lubov too much, though. What do viewers learn about Lubov in \"Stage Fright\"?", "correct": "Lubov is a Doll.", "options": ["Lubov suffers from hallucinations.", "Lubov is a Dollhouse security man.", "Lubov is selling information on the Dollhouse to Ballard, and information on Ballard to the Dollhouse."], "explanation": "\n\n\nLubov is a Doll.\n\n\tLubov has been spending the early part of the episode chasing after Ballard, trying to set up a rendezvous. (He tells a neighbor of Ballard's that he knew him in the Navy, and -- at her blank stare -- hastily amends it to, \"Old Navy. I did retail, before. He would, um, buy slacks.\") After he dangles a little bait for our favorite FBI fisherman, we learn that Lubov himself is not what he seems, in a quick cut to the actor in the Dollhouse's fancy chair just after a personality wipe.\r When he turns up a scene or two later to phone in a tip to the basement of an abandoned hotel, it's very like the anticipation in a horror movie. No, Ballard! Don't go in there! \n"}, {"text": "Rayna is a superstar, and no one wants to lose her. In light of the high stakes of Echo/Jordan's mission, the Dollhouse sends back-up in the form of Sierra, programmed with the personality of an Australian woman named Audra. What is Sierra/Audra's reason for staying near Rayna?", "correct": "She is the winner of a fan contest.", "options": ["She is a reporter for \"Rolling Stone.\"", "She is a dead ringer for Rayna's cousin.", "She is filming a documentary on Rayna."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe is the winner of a fan contest.\n\n\tSierra/Audra is introduced to Rayna as her \"number-one fan,\" winner of an enviable package that includes both plane tickets from Sydney to the U.S. and nearly unlimited backstage access. Audra is both nervous and thrilled beyond belief to meet her idol; Rayna, deeply unimpressed, has to be reminded to be polite to her. Jordan, however, seems to form an instant connection with Audra; could this reflect the gentle, shallow friendship shared by Echo and Sierra in their mind-wiped time at the Dollhouse? \n"}, {"text": "Acting on a tip from the mysterious Lubov, Ballard goes alone to the basement of an abandoned hotel in search of clues to the Dollhouse. What happens there?", "correct": "He is ambushed by Russian mobsters, and is seriously wounded fighting them off.", "options": ["He is seriously injured when the building suddenly explodes.", "His FBI superiors are waiting, and chide him for wasting the Bureau's time.", "He surprises two dozen senior citizens at their bingo game."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is ambushed by Russian mobsters, and is seriously wounded fighting them off.\n\n\tIt's an odd choice for Ballard to go to the Devonshire Hotel, alone, without back-up, and without anyone at the FBI knowing his plans. Hasn't he ever seen  any television? But he does waltz in solo, and he's surprised by a group of three goons from the Russian crime family he's been investigating. They are not looking for friendship.\r Despite his ill-conceived entrance (even one of the goons mocks him for not having back-up!), Ballard does have the scriptwriters on his side, which is why he's able to kill or subdue all three of his opponents despite being shot in the gut fairly early in the fight. By the time he manages to call 911, however, he's nearly passed out, and we get some suspense as the camerawork and music imply he might not make it. (He does.) \n"}, {"text": "Meanwhile, backstage with Rayna, Echo/Jordan makes a shocking discovery: the superstar is in league with the deranged fan who's trying to kill her. How does she find out that Rayna is a co-conspirator in her own murder?", "correct": "Rayna's dressing room is filled with flowers and notes from her would-be killer.", "options": ["She overhears a phone conversation in which Rayna is choreographing her own death.", "She catches Rayna setting fire to her body armor.", "She finds Rayna slipping a copy of her dressing-room key to a fan."], "explanation": "\n\n\nRayna's dressing room is filled with flowers and notes from her would-be killer.\n\n\tRayna's dressing room is filled with orchids, all sent by her would-be killer, and they're accompanied by creepily written notes on red construction paper. Echo/Jordan realizes first that all of Rayna's fan mail is supposed to be going directly to the police -- and then she picks one up and realizes what they say.Rayna pouts, telling Jordan that she feels imprisoned by her life -- just another factory-made pop star, right down to her start in Disney's Mickey Mouse Club. The killer, Rayna says, is her \"number-one fan,\" and she just wants to give the audience a performance they'll never forget. \"I'm not crazy,\" Rayna argues, despite all evidence to the contrary.\"I just want to be free.\" \n"}, {"text": "At Rayna's show that night, her stalker -- now known to us as a skinny young man with strawberry hair -- takes some shots at the stage, but no one is hurt. The frustrated gunman, however, is furious with Rayna over something she said onstage, and in the chaotic aftermath, he kidnaps someone to teach the singer a lesson. Whom does he kidnap, and why?", "correct": "Sierra/Audra, because she's Rayna's \"number-one fan\"", "options": ["Echo/Jordan, because Rayna said she owed her her life", "Ballard's neighbor Mellie, because he thinks the FBI hasn't paid him enough attention", "Rayna herself, because she said she loved life"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSierra/Audra, because she's Rayna's \"number-one fan\".\n\n\tWe've seen in the dressing room that the stalker (played by Graham Norris) believes himself to be Rayna's number-one fan, and takes inordinate pride in being the one chosen to take her to the next level of stardom. (Yes, their plans are that twisted.) So it's not surprising that he's hurt and offended when Rayna introduces Audra on stage, in front of everyone, as her real \"number-one fan,\" in order to cover for Echo/Jordan's disruption of the show.He snatches Audra off the street as everyone is distracted by the aftermath of the shooting, and sends a threatening video to Rayna. \"You gave her what was mine,\" the stalker accuses, and tells Rayna that she knows how to reach him in order to save her fan's life. \n"}, {"text": "The time has come for the final showdown, which (naturally) takes place on a catwalk. The two sides appear to be at an impasse, until Echo/Jordan takes control of the situation. How does she persuade Rayna of the value of life?", "correct": "She throws Rayna off the catwalk.", "options": ["She sings an impassioned song about freedom.", "She points a revolver at Rayna and flips off the safety.", "She gives a moving speech about what the future might bring."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe throws Rayna off the catwalk.\n\n\tEcho/Jordan, fired by the music star she's programmed to protect, goes off-mission as soon as she sees that Sierra/Audra is in danger. When Rayna isn't fast enough to take action, Jordan hits her over the head with a chair and drags her to the rendezvous with Audra and her kidnapper. There, Jordan summarizes the situation neatly: Rayna, in love with a romantic ideal of death at the top of one's art, wants to die. The stalker wants to kill her. And Jordan doesn't much care one way or another. So she simplifies things by throwing Rayna off the catwalk -- which is when we, and Rayna, learn that she has a rope harness, so that she dangles harmlessly below Jordan's feet.\r In her brief plunge, Rayna -- facing mortality -- discovers that the real and immediate possibility of death is far less romantic than the idealized version she's been pursuing. She wants to live! And, in the ensuing uproar, the stalker is arrested, everyone is saved, and the Dollhouse breathes a sigh of relief that Jordan wasn't off-mission after all; she was just stopping the person who truly wanted Rayna dead, namely Rayna. It may not have been the best way of doing so, but this justification allows the Dollhouse brass to avoid asking themselves hard questions. \n"}, {"text": "Back at the Dollhouse, Audra's and Jordan's personalities have been wiped, and Sierra and Echo wander about, blissfully blank-slate. Or are they? After Sierra approaches Echo in bright-eyed friendship, the two of them share a moment which may mean they know more than they let on. What happens?", "correct": "Echo warns Sierra off with a subtle head shake, and Sierra walks away.", "options": ["Echo has a flashback to one of Jordan's memories.", "Echo calls Sierra by the wrong name: Audra.", "Sierra catches a glimpse of herself in a mirror, and pauses."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEcho warns Sierra off with a subtle head shake, and Sierra walks away.\n\n\tEcho knows that the two of them are being watched (at the very least by their handlers, Boyd and Hearn), and seems not to want to let it show that they have a deeper friendship than the Dollhouse expects. (After all, it's been telegraphed that -- as Jordan -- Echo abandoned her Dollhouse mission in order to save Sierra, as Audra.) Sierra appears to understand, and moves away without making a scene. \r This may not seem like much, but it's a much, much deeper interaction than we've ever seen between two mind-wiped Dolls. In the Dollhouse, they're limited to shallow, scripted exchanges about being their best and about friends helping each other. Any interaction with layers of meaning bodes well for a deepening mystery in the next episodes! \n"}]}
