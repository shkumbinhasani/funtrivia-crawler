{"id": "373126", "name": "Television Quiz: \"Radio Bart\": 10 Questions | 'Simpsons' - Seasons and Episodes", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Simpsons", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Where does Homer learn of the Superstar Celebrity Microphone?", "correct": "From the TV", "options": ["From a newspaper ad", "From the radio", "He sees someone using one on the street"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom the TV.\n\n\tHomer walks into the living room to find Lisa dancing to something on TV and is promptly distracted by what's onscreen.  During this time, Lisa asks him if she can have some money to buy Bart a birthday gift; he ends up handing over his entire wallet.  An advertisement comes on the television as soon as she walks off, and Homer is enraptured with the idea of buying Bart a Superstar Celebrity Microphone solely because of the ad.  That night, in bed, Homer tells Marge it'll be the boy's best birthday gift.  He will buy his son's love yet! \n"}, {"text": "How old does Bart turn for his birthday in this episode?", "correct": "Ten", "options": ["Nine", "Eleven", "Twelve"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTen.\n\n\tBart's birthday finally comes up and it's apparent that he's excited.  He begins by getting his height recorded on his door and follows it up by seeing his name appear in the scrolling birthday list on the 'Krusty the Klown Show'.  Soon after, it's time to hit the town to get all the birthday freebies he can ranging from an ice cream sundae to a straight-razor shave and a tango lesson.  Before he knows it, it's time to head off to his birthday party. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Bart's birthday party held?", "correct": "Wall E. Weasel's", "options": ["Chuck E. Cheese's", "Ed E. Eagle's", "Pizza the Hutt's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWall E. Weasel's\n\n\tAt the restaurant, Bart and all of his friends have a great time enjoying the arcade before the Wall E. mascot himself comes out with a pizza.  It becomes apparent that the restaurant is a bit lacklustre when an animatronic stage show celebrating any generic birthday falls apart and sets ablaze.  Soon though, the presents start arriving and Bart is a fair bit disappointed. Patty and Selma got him a labelmaker; he receives socks and a cactus from someone else.  Bart isn't the least bit excited by Homer's microphone.  The only thing that gets use from the get-go is the labelmaker; he sticks 'PROPERTY OF BART SIMPSON' to every conceivable item at home. \n"}, {"text": "Who convinces Bart that the Superstar Celebrity Microphone is an excellent gift?", "correct": "Marge", "options": ["Homer", "Lisa", "Milhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarge.\n\n\tHomer's disappointed that Bart is using the microphone as little more than a wedge to prop open his bedroom window and sets out to show off the great applications of the device, mainly by mimicking everything from the commercials.  The problem is, his yelling distorts the microphone signal enough to create feedback. Marge later tries the device out on a portable radio and convinces Bart of its good use...but Bart has other ideas.  He begins by pranking Homer, using the radio to fake a radio broadcast from aliens.  While Homer is initially gullible to the idea, he realizes that Bart is actually enjoying his gift and allows him to keep playing provided it's not used for any more pranks. Bart has other ideas. \n"}, {"text": "Bart tosses a radio into an old well to play his biggest prank.  Who's the first to hear his broadcast for this one?", "correct": "Groundskeeper Willie", "options": ["Principal Skinner", "Police Chief Wiggum", "Lisa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGroundskeeper Willie.\n\n\tThe pranks continue almost immediately throughout the house.  He hides the radio in Maggie's crib to fake her first words before placing the microphone underneath Lisa's bed to listen in on her private talks with Janey.  In class, he uses the microphone to fake fart sounds while he toys with the Flanders kids' belief in God.  The coup de grace comes when he accidentally drops his radio down a well, fooling Groundskeeper Willie into believing that a child fell into it...but soon the entire town catches wind of the news. \n"}, {"text": "What name does Bart give to the little boy he falsely pretends to be in the bottom of the well?", "correct": "Timmy", "options": ["Billy", "Bart-Bart", "Jimmy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTimmy.\n\n\tThe whole town, it seems, heads out to the well while Bart hides in the bushes with his microphone.  They ask for the boy's name and he responds with 'Timmy O'Toole'.  When they ask about his parents, he claims not to have had any, and when he tried to enrol in school, principal Skinner told him off for having shabby clothes.  Kent Brockman also ends up onsite to report the news, stating that no one can go in and rescue Timmy because his leg is trapped under a rock and the local police force is too overweight to fit into the well. \n"}, {"text": "What famous musician does Krusty pull into the rescue effort by co-writing the song \"Sending Our Love Down the Well\"?", "correct": "Sting", "options": ["Michael Jackson", "Prince", "Eric Clapton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSting.\n\n\tThe town starts positing less-than-genius methods of freeing Timmy from the well, most of which are too impractical or are outright nonsensical.  Nonetheless, everyone believes that Timmy is real, and while the Simpsons eat dinner in front of the TV, Marge leads a prayer for the trapped boy.  Bart, the only one who knows the truth, can't do anything but laugh.  All of them find that even Krusty the Klown is in on the rescue effort, roping Sting into the cause and making a charity single called \"Sending Our Love Down the Well\" to contribute.  The royalties may or may not make it to the effort. \n"}, {"text": "Bart descends into the well and gets trapped inside.  Why does he does this?", "correct": "To retrieve his radio", "options": ["For fame", "On a dare", "His size allows him to help Timmy escape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo retrieve his radio.\n\n\tBefore anyone knows it, there's a carnival surrounding the well charging for admission, and anyone who can capitalize on the trapped Timmy O'Toole is doing so.  After watching an 'Itchy and Scratchy' cartoon dedicated to the boy, Lisa connects the dots.  Watching Bart and Santa's Little Helper fight over the microphone and seeing live footage from the well (of people shocked to hear growls and fighting deep in the earth), she criticizes her brother who covers the mishap by claiming to try and gnaw his foot off. Lisa vows that the police will catch onto him soon, likely because there's a 'PROPERTY OF BART SIMPSON' label on the radio. That night, Bart grabs some rope and descends into the well to retrieve his condemning property...trapping himself down there in the process, ironically with a rock covering his leg. \n"}, {"text": "After Bart is revealed as the prankster, Mayor Quimby puts a halt to rescue efforts, effectively leaving the boy trapped in the well.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIt doesn't take long for the police to realize Bart is now in the well, and he admits to the prank outright.  The problem is, the police are now wise to his antics, and considering he lied about Timmy, they are in no rush in dealing with the situation.  Homer brings some of Bart's belongings to the well to make him feel more at home while Marge asks about the effort and when the city catches wind, they blame Homer and Marge, of course. Soon, Mayor Quimby decides to pull back on any rescue efforts to save Bart because it's hurting his public appeal.  Even the newspapers back off, and the only people visiting Bart are the Simpsons. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first to begin digging into the ground to save Bart?", "correct": "Homer", "options": ["Krusty", "Lisa", "Marge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHomer.\n\n\tHomer, fed up, decides that if no one will help, he'll dig his boy out of the well on his own.  With a single shovel and a wheelbarrow, he begins.  Soon, others come by to help until, finally, they reach the bottom of the well and Sting himself breaks through the side.  Homer and Marge are there to reunite with the boy and free him from the prison he created for himself.  The next day, Groundskeeper Willie puts up a single sign-- a fair distance away-- to advise people to avoid the well. \n"}]}
