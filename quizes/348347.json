Most longships were double ended meaning that they did not have to turn around to go the opposite way, they just changed which way they were rowing. Famous Viking kings and warriors were sometimes buried with their longships when they died.There was also a tradition of putting the body on the ship, sending it out to sea, and setting it on fire.   \n"}, {"text": "A sampan is an ancient sailboat made of banyan wood by the Maori tribe of New Zealand.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tA sampan is actually a flat-bottomed wooden river boat that is found on all major waterways of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Vietnam.
