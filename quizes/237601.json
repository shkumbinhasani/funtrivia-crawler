{"id": "237601", "name": "Hardest Video Games - In Other Words 3 Trivia Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Video Games Wordplay", "Video Games In Other Words"], "questions": [{"text": "On one's own without light", "correct": "Alone in the Dark", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlone in the Dark.\n\n\t\"Alone in the Dark\" was regarded as one of the first survival-horror games, created even before \"Resident Evil\" and the \"Silent Hill\" series in 1992.  The game follows a detective on their own in a haunted Vitorian mansion containing evil creatures and catacombs as they set out to find out what really happened to a man who had earlier committed suicide in the attic.  The game is based on H. P. Lovecraft's works, and was later adapted into a film by Uwe Boll, which, like his other works, was loosely related to the plots of the series. \n"}, {"text": "Quarrels between groups of warriors", "correct": "Guild Wars", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuild Wars.\n\n\tThe \"Guild Wars\" series became a popular MMORPG, but no one really knew about it.  Unlike its more popular competition (\"World of Warcraft\"), \"Guild Wars\" has more refined graphics and different, more simplistic gameplay.  With two stand-alone, expandable sequels ('Factions' and 'Nightfall') and a full-fledged expansion ('Eye of the North'), the game and its creators at Arenanet grew a respectable fanbase.  With ten different playable professions, numerous exotic landscapes and hundreds of skills, quests, and features, 'Guild Wars\" should definitely make you reconsider online gaming. \n"}, {"text": "Scalers of frozen water", "correct": "Ice Climbers & Ice Climber", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce Climbers & Ice Climber.\n\n\tWith renewed interest after their appearance in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", Popo and Nana have returned.  Making their debut in the arcade and NES versions of \"Ice Climbers\", the duo scaled mountains in order to reclaim their eggplants from that pesky condor (blasted arctic condors!).  Versions of the game have also reappeared in Gamecube's \"Animal Crossing\" and the Wii's Virtual Console.  \"Ice Climbers\" first hit the arcades in 1985. \n"}, {"text": "Large state governed by ornamental Chinese gemstones", "correct": "Jade Empire", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJade Empire.\n\n\tReleased on the Xbox in 2005 (and PC in 2007), \"Jade Empire\" was a modestly popular game which was welcomely received by RPG and adventure gamers.  The game, set in ancient China, contained many martial arts aspects and a simplified version of a role-playing game (with the player focussing on body, mind, and spirit).  The game was created by the Canadian gaming company Bioware, who was also responsible for \"Neverwinter Nights\" and \"Baldur's Gate\". \n"}, {"text": "Empty area taking control of foreign land", "correct": "Space Invaders", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpace Invaders.\n\n\t\"Space Invaders\" was first created in 1978, and is regarded as a classic due to the influence that it has had over video gaming as a whole.  The game is based around a player character at the bottom of the screen who fends off evil alien invaders, who attack the planet.  The player character shoots the enemies before they hit the ground while picking up bonus and upgrades.  If an alien touched down, or if the player was hit by oncoming fire, they would lose the game. \n"}, {"text": "The last brawl", "correct": "Final Fight", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinal Fight.\n\n\tThe \"Final Fight\" games were originally created as part of the \"Street Fighter\" series, but the two split off (while keeping the same characters).  The first \"Final Fight\" games were in the arcade and on the SNES console, but they have gone on through the generations of gaming, appearing on handheld and console systems alike.  In 2007, \"Final Fight\" appeared on the Wii Virtual Console. \n"}, {"text": "The people who live next door were devoured by the living dead", "correct": "Zombies Ate My Neighbours & Zombies Ate My Neighbors", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nZombies Ate My Neighbours & Zombies Ate My Neighbors.\n\n\tIn this hilarious take on the B-Movies of decades past, the player assumes the role of Nancy or Zeke as they fight through the neighbourhood and town to defend themselves from zombies (which ate their neghbours).  The game pokes fun and contains allusions to horror films, and in the forty-fourth stage (as well as the final and forty-eighth stage), the player battles with the mad Dr. Tongue.  The game was initially released on the SNES. \n"}, {"text": "Tale of a syrup-producing tree", "correct": "Maple Story", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaple Story.\n\n\tThis side-scrolling MMORPG (odd combo, eh?) was developed in Korea in 2003 and has spread around the globe on various servers to become a moderately popular game.  Because it is an MMORPG, players can trade, talk, and play with one another in the giant Maple World.  Like other MMOs, the game allows the character to develop and expand through leveling and skill training.  This is often done in quests.  The popularity of the game in Asia spawned the idea of a \"Maple Story\" game for the Nintendo DS, which would be able to make use of the DS Opera Browser. \n"}, {"text": "The era of the control center of your central nervous system", "correct": "Brain Age", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrain Age.\n\n\t\"Brain Age\" (and its original counterpart, \"Big Brain Academy\") were released in the first half of 2006 under the 'Touch! Generation' series.  Both were designed exclusively as logic and thinking puzzles which would stimulate the brain.  Following the success of these, \"Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree\" was released on the Wii in 2007, and \"Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day\" was also released.  \"Brain Age\" was extremely popular on the DS, selling more than ten million copies in its first year of release. \n"}, {"text": "Eliminate every single person", "correct": "Destroy All Humans", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDestroy All Humans.\n\n\t\"Destroy All Humans!\" was first released in 2005 and was quite popular.  With it being released on the Xbox and the Playstation 2, many players snatched it because of its addictive style and fun storyline.  Due to its success, a sequel was released on both systems.  The game was rated a bit higher than average (in regards to the ESRB rating) due to the occasional sexual humour it contained, despite the fact that it did not contain gore or obscure violence. \n"}]}
