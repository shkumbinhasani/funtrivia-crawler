Her career began with a self-title debut album that went 'Gold' in 1960. Her most successful single, \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\", reached #3 in the US Billboard 100 chart, #6 in the UK Singles chart, and topped the US Adult Contemporary chart in 1971.

", "correct": "Byron", "options": ["Keats", "Wilde", "Browning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nByron.\n\n\tThere are towns named Byron in states from Maine to California and from Georgia to Minnesota. South Dakota's Lake Byron, which feeds the James River, is particularly popular with game fishermen. Cape Byron, just north of the town on Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, is the easternmost point of mainland Australia. It was named by Captain James Cook, not though for the poet Lord Byron but for British explorer John Byron, who circumnavigated the globe in the 1760s in HMS Dolphin. The 65-mile wide Byron Crater on Mercury, though, was named for the poet. \rJames Byron Dean was born in Marion IN in 1931. After a handful of uncredited film appearances in the early 1950s, he made only three films in starring roles but was nominated twice for a Best Actor Oscar. He died in a 1955 auto accident before the last of those three films (\"Giant\") was even released. \n"}, {"text": "The Eagles put the Arizona town of Winslow on the map, although there are also towns of the same name in a dozen other states.

(Kelsey is actually his middle name -- he was born Allen Kelsey Grammer.) Curiously, Frasier's brother, Niles, although given an unusual first name was given no middle name at all. \rOf the alternatives, Roseanne Harris Connor from \"Roseanne\" was played by Roseanne Barr; Sabrina Spellman (played by Melissa Joan Hart in \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\") was not given a middle name; and poor old Malcolm (portrayed by Frankie Muniz) from \"Malcolm in the Middle\" was not only not given a middle name but he did not even have a last name (and nor did any of the other characters in the series). \n"}, {"text": "Most people have one middle name, some two and mostly only royalty more.

The British Prime Minister from 1964-1970 and again from 1974-1976, he was born James Harold Wilson in Huddersfield, Yorkshire in 1916. \rBorn in Tampico IL in 1911, Ronald Wilson Reagan was the 40th President of the U.S., holding office from 1981 until 1989.

A year later, Tracy was nominated again, for \"Captains Courageous\", and this time he carried the statue away too. A second consecutive Oscar win followed for what is perhaps Tracy's most famous film role, as Father Flanagan in \"Boys Town\" with Mickey Rooney. \rTracy's posthumous nomination for the 1967 Best Actor Oscar for \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" gave him a record nine nominations in the category. Laurence Olivier tied that record in 1978. Paul Newman died one short of Tracy and Olivier's record for nominations. Jack Nicholson's 2002 nomination and Peter O'Toole's nomination in 2006 moved each of them level with Newman, one behind Tracy and Olivier.\rOf the alternatives, Paul Muni won his Oscar the year before Tracy's double, in 1936 for \"The Story of Louis Pasteur\". Muni was born with the impressive name of Frederich Meshilem Meier Weisenfreund in Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w), Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine) in 1895.

His new name, and the one under which he became President in 1974, was Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr.\rOf the alternatives, Calvin Coolidge is another of those Presidents known by his middle name -- he was born John Calvin Coolidge in Plymouth Notch VT in 1872.
