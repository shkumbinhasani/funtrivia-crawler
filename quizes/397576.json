The team adopted its distinctive purple colours in 1929; the player's shirts were originally red and white, the colours of Florence's coat of arms, representing a red fleur-de-lis on a white field. The fleur-de-lis is also used as the club's badge - hence the team's other nickname of \"I Gigliati\" (those that wear the lily).

They play AFL, which is known more familiarly as Aussie Rules, an Australian specific game which came into being in 1896. Although the club and training grounds were indeed once based at Freemantle in Western Australia, 19km south of Perth, the club and training grounds are now based in Cockburn Central in Perth. \r Matches are played between two teams of eighteen players. Players are not allowed to run while holding onto the ball, but must bounce it on the ground as they gallop up and down the field. That oddly shaped ball isn't a nice round ball at all, but more oval in shape with pointed ends, and when bounced it has a tendency to bounce anywhere but straight back up. Players are also not allowed to be caught while in possession of the ball. Another unusual feature of this game takes place at the start of each game. The umpire bounces the ball on the ground between the teams, and two ruckman (usually the tallest in the teams) leap up into the air as high as they can go - as they battle to get possession of that oval shaped piece of leather. This has led to Aussie Rules being given the nickname by tougher League and Union players, of \"aerial Ping-Pong\".\r (Creedy) \n"}, {"text": "Which celebrated racehorse owner was named \"British Flat Racing Champion Owner\" in both 1954 and 1957?", "correct": "Queen Elizabeth II", "options": ["Aga Khan III", "Sheikh Mohammed", "Sir Victor Sassoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen Elizabeth II.\n\n\tFrom an early age Queen Elizabeth displayed a keen interest and love of horses, which was hardly surprising as both of her parents were similarly enthusiastic.
