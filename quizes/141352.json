Confidential"], "questions": [{"text": "When Officer Bud White (Russell Crowe) pays his first surprise visit to Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn) at Patchett's palatial home, what is Patchett doing?", "correct": "playing golf", "options": ["eating lunch", "eating breakfast", "playing tennis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nplaying golf.\n\n\tPatchett is working on his putting skills in his enormous backyard. \n"}, {"text": "Patchett eventually admits to White that he runs a prostitution ring, and that most of the women who work for him look like famous movie stars, either through luck or surgical alteration.  Who is NOT one of the actresses he lists as a template for one of his employees?", "correct": "Brigitte Bardot", "options": ["Ava Gardner", "Marilyn Monroe", "Lana Turner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrigitte Bardot.\n\n\tPatchett states that he \"has\" look-alikes of (Ava) Gardner, (Rosalind -- or does he mean Jean?) Russell, Marilyn Monroe, Lana Turner, and Veronica Lake.  Bardot is never mentioned in this scene. \n"}, {"text": "Patchett has an unusual middle name.  What is it?", "correct": "Morehouse", "options": ["Stanford", "Milhous", "Standground"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorehouse.\n\n\tAt one point in his exasperating conversation with Patchett, White mutters, \"Jesus H. Christ.\"  Patchett \"corrects\" White with a huge dollop of sarcasm by saying, \"No -- Pierce Morehouse Patchett.\" \n"}, {"text": "When White first visits the home of prostitute Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), he interrupts a \"session\" that she is having with a \"client.\"  White recognizes this client right away.  What civil service position does this man apparently hold?", "correct": "Councilman", "options": ["Commissioner", "Sheriff", "Senator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCouncilman.\n\n\tThe unnamed city councilman tries to play it tough when White tells him to vacate the premises, but White threatens to call the man's wife if he doesn't scram.  On his way out, the man calls White \"Officer.\"  White replies with, \"Councilman.\" \n"}, {"text": "Lynn Bracken underwent plastic surgery in order to solidify her resemblance to film star Veronica Lake.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhite assumes that Lynn has been surgically altered (as many of Patchett's employees have been), but Lynn quickly corrects Bud: \"No. I'm really a brunette.  The rest is me.\"  Apparently a dye job was all that Lynn needed to make the illusion work. \n"}, {"text": "Despite some masterful, manipulative interrogation by Lt. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), the three young men suspected of felonious activity at a local diner are not answering questions quickly enough or thoroughly enough to satisfy Officer White.  He bursts into the interrogation room, removes all but one of the six bullets from his revolver, and proceeds to force one of the prisoners into a rather one-sided game of \"Russian Roulette\" in order to get the answers he wants.\n\nHow many times does White actually pull the trigger of his gun while its barrel is firmly planted in the terrified suspect's mouth?", "correct": "3", "options": ["4", "2", "5"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tWhite cocks the gun and pulls the trigger three times.  It didn't look as though White pulled a fast one by removing all six bullets, either, which means that any one of those three pulls of the trigger could have killed the suspect, in full view of the squad room! \n"}, {"text": "The young men apprehended by Exley, White, and company were truly guilty of a number of crimes.  Which of the following crimes was NOT committed by even ONE of these men?", "correct": "murder", "options": ["rape", "battery", "kidnapping"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmurder.\n\n\tThe three men who were originally arrested as possible perpetrators of the \"Nite Owl Massacre\" actually had nothing at all to do with the killings that took place in that diner.  They were, however -- along with a fourth man (whom White eventually kills in cold blood) -- guilty of kidnapping, beating, and raping a young woman.  Not one of the four men actually killed anyone. \n"}, {"text": "The intellectual, straight-arrow Edmund Exley surprisingly earns the nickname \"Shotgun Ed\" after he abruptly thwarts the escape of a prisoner by killing him with a shotgun blast \"sneaked\" into the almost-closed door of an elevator car.  Who first gives Exley the nickname \"Shotgun Ed\"?", "correct": "Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell)", "options": ["Lynn Bracken", "Officer Bud White", "Detective Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell).\n\n\tAfter Exley kills the fleeing prisoner, Smith says, with some amusement, \"Who'd have guessed it?  Shotgun Ed.\" \n"}, {"text": "Lynn Bracken is not a California native.  From what state does she actually hail?", "correct": "Arizona", "options": ["New Mexico", "Texas", "Nevada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArizona.\n\n\tAfter White discovers, in Lynn's residence, a small embroidered pillow with the word \"Arizona\" on it, Lynn explains that Arizona is her home state.  (Kim Basinger, the actress who plays Lynn, is from Georgia.) \n"}, {"text": "After White and Lynn Bracken start seeing each other socially, we are shown a brief scene in which the couple attend a movie.  What movie are they seeing?", "correct": "Roman Holiday", "options": ["The Bad and the Beautiful", "Shane", "From Here to Eternity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoman Holiday.\n\n\tAudrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are clearly seen gallivanting about the streets of Rome on the big screen as Bud and Lynn giggle and share popcorn. \n"}, {"text": "Exley admits to Vincennes that he has made up a fictional name for the unidentified man who, years ago, killed his (Exley's) father and got away scot free.  What are the initials of this killer, according to the completely made-up name that Exley has assigned him?", "correct": "R. T.", "options": ["T. R.", "J. T.", "T. J."], "explanation": "\n\n\nR. T.\n\n\tExley calls this man \"Rollo Tomasi.\" \n"}, {"text": "The woman who looks like Lana Turner and throws a drink in Lt. Exley's face is actually one of Patchett's prostitutes who has been altered to RESEMBLE Lana Turner.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tVincennes, an expert on Hollywood celebrities, realizes almost immediately that Exley has made a mistake, and that the woman Exley is callously dismissing as a hooker is in fact the REAL Lana Turner.  The news from Vincennes doesn't come in time, though, to save Exley from getting a drink thrown in his face at the Frolic Room. \n"}, {"text": "According to his own dialogue, how many daughters does Captain Dudley Smith have?", "correct": "4 & four", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n4 & four.\n\n\tWhen Vincennes pays a late-night visit to Smith, the captain mentions that his wife and four daughters are in Santa Barbara for the weekend. \n"}, {"text": "Dudley Smith manipulates certain events so that Officer White finds out that Lt. Exley has had sex with Lynn Bracken, White's lover.

Exley and White realize almost immediately, though, that Patchett was murdered.  How do they know it wasn't suicide?", "correct": "Two of Patchett's fingers are broken.", "options": ["There are \"defensive wounds\" from a blade of some sort on Patchett's palms.", "The pen that supposedly wrote the \"suicide note\" is in the wrong hand.", "The handwriting on the \"suicide note\" does not match Patchett's."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo of Patchett's fingers are broken.\n\n\tPatchett's wrists have been slashed...but, since two of Patchett's fingers are broken, White immediately deduces that Patchett was forced into submission and had his wrists slit by someone else entirely. \n"}, {"text": "Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) does not survive this film.  Who killed him?", "correct": "Dudley Smith", "options": ["Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel)", "Sid Hudgens (Danny Devito)", "Pierce Patchett"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDudley Smith.\n\n\tThis is the moment when we learn that Captain Smith is the real bad guy -- he kills Vincennes with a single shot to the heart (in Smith's own kitchen!) just seconds after Vincennes makes it clear that he's stumbled across some dirty cops in the precinct. \n"}, {"text": "The final showdown of this film takes place at the very motel where Officer White -- on the orders of Captain Smith -- has been performing some less-than-legal \"muscle work\" on suspected criminals.  What is the name of this motel?", "correct": "Victory Motel", "options": ["Triumph Motel", "Starlight Motel", "Treetop Motel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictory Motel.\n\n\tThe sign for the Victory Motel is clearly visible at many times throughout the film, and it's mentioned in dialogue more than once. \n"}, {"text": "In her final scene, Lynn Bracken's appearance is different from her appearances throughout the rest of the film.  What's different in this last scene?", "correct": "She has cut her hair.", "options": ["She is wearing a nurse's uniform.", "She has dyed her hair.", "She is wearing a policewoman's uniform."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe has cut her hair.\n\n\tThe long, Veronica Lake-like locks have been hacked off, leaving Lynn looking more than a little like Marilyn Monroe, oddly enough.  The idea seems to be that she no longer needs to look like Lake, the movie star whom Patchett trained her to emulate. \n"}, {"text": "Exley and White share a fairly heartfelt handshake in the final moments of this film.  What does White say to Exley in this scene?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["\"I won't forget you.\"", "\"Thanks for the push.\"", "\"Some men get the world.  Other men get ex-hookers and a trip to [a state in the USA].\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tSince White was shot through the cheek in the climactic gunfight, it's clear in this final scene -- thanks to the painful-looking bandaging of his face -- that he's entirely incapable of speech.  White therefore doesn't say a single word.  (Lynn is the one who makes the \"Some men get the world\" comment.) \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following Academy Awards did this film NOT win?", "correct": "Best Director", "options": ["Best Supporting Actress", "The film won ALL of these awards", "Best Adapted Screenplay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBest Director.\n\n\tKim Basinger won Best Supporting Actress, and Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland won for their adaptation of James Ellroy's novel.  Hanson lost the Best Director nod to James Cameron for \"Titanic.\"  \r Hope you enjoyed the ride! \n"}]}
