{"id": "128185", "name": "Jim Reeves Lyric Titles Quiz | Music | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music Q-S", " Jim Reeves"], "questions": [{"text": "Complete the title : \"Distant....\"", "correct": "Drums", "options": ["Songs", "Voices", "Islands"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrums.\n\n\t\"Distant Drums\" was a big hit for Jim Reeves. It throws up the age-old question of whether you should marry your sweet-heart before you go off to battle or whether you should wait until you are safely home. Some people connected this song with the war in Vietnam. We never do learn if Mary said, \"Yes.\" \n"}, {"text": "Complete the title : \"The Highway to ......\"", "correct": "Nowhere", "options": ["Old Mexico", "Laramie", "The one I love"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNowhere.\n\n\tIt's all about that frustration of trying to make an impression on the girl that you love. He compares it to getting lost on the highway and the song brings in the idea of a \"detour\" and ending up back where he started. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the title : \"He'll Have To ...\"", "correct": "Go", "options": ["Wait", "Leave", "Meet Me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGo.\n\n\tThis has the interesting idea of the song being sung down a telephone line. Jim refers to the girl's date as \"your friend\" but you can sense the controlled antagonism in his voice. A reply to this song was composed soon after - for a female artist to sing. Poor Jim wasn't going to get the girl. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the title : \"Anna ....\"", "correct": "Marie", "options": ["Elena", "Lucia", "Belle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarie.\n\n\t\"Anna Marie. Anna Marie. My heart remembers and sighs.\" Part of this lyric is actually sung in French. Jim also attempted \"Beautiful Dreamer\" sung in Afrikaans ! The voice was always just as good. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the title : \"Adios ....\"", "correct": "Amigo", "options": ["California", "Muchacho", "Compadre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmigo.\n\n\tYou can sense the whole story behind this song from just the short lyric. Two men have fallen for the same girl. Jim plays the part of the one who loses out. He can still part with his friend on good terms. He asks him to name one of the boys after him. He will ride far away and try to forget. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the title: \"Mexican ....\"", "correct": "Joe", "options": ["Bill", "Pete", "Juanito"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe.\n\n\tMexican Joe seems to have the best of everything. \"He's got more fun than anybody's had.\"  \"But when he wants a kiss all he's got to do is say so.\" Lucky man. The bit about them trying to collect from him when they win always makes me want to smile. \"They don't know where he is.\" \n"}, {"text": "Complete the title : \"I Missed ....\"", "correct": "Me", "options": ["Your Eyes", "You", "Your Lips"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMe.\n\n\tSomeone else is in his place at his girlfriend's house. There's someone else kissing her beneath the porch light. He's torturing himself by thinking about what he used to do. Now there's a different car in the drive and someone else walking out on the lawn. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the title : \"Your Old ......\"", "correct": "Love Letters", "options": ["Wonderful Smile", "Pretty Face", "Sweet Lips"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLove Letters.\n\n\tHe's burning the old love letters that she wrote to him some time before. The first letter is always the sweetest and the last is always the heart-breaker. It's another song where the memory of love is sweet but the sense of loss is deeper. All the letters, like their love, are going to go up in smoke. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the title : \"How's The ...... Treating You?\"", "correct": "World", "options": ["Boy", "Night", "Darkness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld.\n\n\tIt's in this song that he talks about how every day is \"blue Monday\". They have been parted for a while but he still hasn't recovered. He has no plans for the future. His only hope is that she might be \"burning and yearning\" now that they are apart. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the title : \"There's a ........ Following Me.\"", "correct": "Heartache", "options": ["Memory", "Blue Feeling", "Sweetheart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeartache.\n\n\tThis once again reflects the feeling of being trapped by the love that is over for her but not for him. He's never really \"free\". He can tell lies to his friends about how he feels but the heartache is always there. \n"}]}
