At this point, the reader senses trouble, considering that Pickwick has made clear his intention of not paying a cent of any damages that may be incurred in a court loss! \n"}, {"text": "Following the episode with his lawyers, Pickwick and friends spend an evening with Bob Sawyer and Benjamin Allen, a 'bachelor party' of sorts.

His first act of physical revenge. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 34 might be the single most memorable episode of the book.  Here, the trial of Bardell versus Pickwick is presented.  Mrs. Bardell's lawyer Buzfuz makes a rather fervent case for his client, while at the same time smearing the good name of our friend Pickwick.

Yours, Pickwick.  Gentlemen, what does this mean?  Chops and tomata sauce.  Yours, Pickwick?  Chops!  Gracious heavens! and Tomata sauce!'
