Nicknamed \"The Rajah\", he played much of his 23-year career in Saint Louis. Who is this Hall of Fame second baseman who batted over .400 three times and in 1924 posted a .424 batting average that no one has come close to matching? He died in January 1963.", "correct": "Rogers Hornsby", "options": ["Honus Wagner", "Jimmie Foxx", "Stan Musial"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRogers Hornsby.\n\n\tBorn in Winters TX in 1896, Rogers Hornsby made his MLB debut for the St. Louis Cardinals at the age of 19. He spent eleven years with the Cards, then had spells with the Giants, Braves and Cubs before returning to Saint Louis, first with the Cards and then the Browns, for the final five years of his playing career. From 1925 on, he was both player and manager except for half of the 1933 season with the Cardinals. \rA World Series champion in 1926, Hornsby was twice named National league MVP. Only Ty Cobb (.366) has finished a Major League career with a higher batting average that Hornsby's .358. He won seven batting titles -- only Cobb (11), Tony Gwynn and Honus Wagner (8 each) won more. He also hit for power -- he was the first National League player to break the 300 HR total. In 1922, he hit 40 homer runs and batted over .400 -- the only player to manage that combination in MLB history. Hornsby and Ted Williams are the only players who have won the batting \"triple crown\" more than once.\rElected to the Baseball Half of Fame in 1942, Rogers Hornsby was named the starting second baseman in the \"Major League Baseball All-Time Team\" in a vote by the \"Baseball Writers Association of America\" in a 1997 poll.\rHornsby died of a heart attack following cataract surgery on January 5, 1963 in Chicago aged 66. \n"}, {"text": "Born in San Francisco in 1874 and recognized as one of 20th-century America's greatest poets, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry four times and in 1960 was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal?

Primarily a music hall performer, Miller also made more than a dozen films in the 1930s and 1940s. \rMiller never swore or actually told a dirty joke, but he was the master of innuendo and by omitting the final word of a gag or skit he sidestepped the censorship legislation of the time to deliver what was considered highly risqu\u00e9 material. Known for his flamboyant suits and numerous catchphrases, Miller's humor outlived him by decades with many comedians continuing to tell his jokes long after his death.

This gave him access to Top Secret documents that he then transmitted to the KGB. During the Marshall Plan negotiations, Burgess was seconded to the British Embassy in Washington D.C., where he shared a flat with Kim Philby.Maclean was suspected of espionage in 1951 but he was tipped off by Philby and escaped to Moscow, and Burgess went with him.

His most-acclaimed films include \"Beauty and the Beast\" (in 1946) and \"Orpheus\" (in 1949). It is ironic that he wrote the enormously successful play \"Le Bel Indiff\u00e9rent\" for singer Edith Piaf in 1940 -- 23 years later the writer and the star of the show would both die on the same day.\rCocteau was a Commander of the Legion of Honor, France's highest award.\rJean Cocteau died of a heart attack on October 11, 1963 in Essonne, France aged 74.

Fifty years on in 2013, though, the anniversary of Lewis's death was commemorated by a memorial in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. \n"}]}
