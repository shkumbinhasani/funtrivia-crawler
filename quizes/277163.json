In which of the following languages does the word \"CENT\" mean \"one hundred\"?", "correct": "French", "options": ["German", "Spanish", "Portuguese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrench.\n\n\tLike \"ciento\" (Spanish) and \"cem\" (Portuguese), the French word \"cent\" derives from the Latin word \"centum.\" Through the development of the French language, the pronunciation of the word changed (to sahN, with a nasal N at the end), but the spelling remained similar. The German word for 100 -- \"hundert\" -- betrays the fact that German is not a Romance language and did not evolve from the Latin. (As I'm sure you noticed, it also betrays the fact that English and German are closely related!)\r The Latin \"cent\" shows up in a wide variety of English words, including many that you'll find in this quiz. A centimeter is a hundredth of a meter; a centenarian has reached the impressive age of a hundred years. You'll see a few more such examples in the next 19 questions! \n"}, {"text": "Here's one For Children, or for any \"Harry Potter\" fan. While plotting to brew Polyjuice Potion and investigate the Heir of Slytherin, Hermione Granger managed to get a hair from the robes of MilliCENT Bulstrode, a Slytherin student -- but disaster ensued when the hair turned out to be from Millicent's cat! In which book did this memorable subplot occur?", "correct": "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", "options": ["Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n\n\tIn \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,\" the second book in J.K. Rowling's wildly popular series, Harry, Ron and Hermione raced against time to identify the Heir of Slytherin and stop him or her from attacking Muggle-born students. Persuaded that the culprit must be one of their fellow students in the famously arrogant Slytherin House, the friends brewed Polyjuice Potion so that they could take on the appearance of Slytherin students and secretly listen to conversations among their peers.Although Ron and Harry successfully posed as their classmates Crabbe and Goyle, Hermione's cat-hair potion required her to spend more than a month recovering in the infirmary.This particular mission turned out to be a bust, but the tenacious trio didn't give up -- read the book to find out more! \n"}, {"text": "Think back to one of the most bloodsoaked periods in History -- World War I. This war pitted the Allies against the CENTral Powers for four years and twenty million deaths. Which of these nations was NOT among the Central Powers?", "correct": "Italy", "options": ["Ottoman Empire", "Bulgaria", "Austria-Hungary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItaly.\n\n\tBefore the August 1914 outbreak of war, Germany and Austria-Hungary belonged to the Triple Alliance with Italy. When fighting began, they called on Italy to join them according to the terms of that alliance -- but Italy refused, arguing that the Triple Alliance was strictly defensive, and that the declaration of war on Serbia made the war an offensive one. A year later, Italy joined the war on the side of the Allies.\r The other two Central Powers -- Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire -- entered the war slightly later. The Ottomans allied themselves with Germany in August and began military action against Russia in October; Bulgaria joined in an invasion of Serbia in 1915. Last to enter the war, Bulgaria was also the first Central Power to leave it, making a separate peace in September 1918; the Ottomans, now in their death throes as an empire, followed suit in October. Austria and Hungary split from each other on October 31 and signed separate ceasefires with the Allies in the following days; Germany's armistice came on November 11. \n"}, {"text": "\"Things fall apart; the CENTre cannot hold;\n Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.\"\n\nThese famous lines were first published in 1920, in a poem called \"The Second Coming.\" What Irish poet, recipient of a Nobel prize in Literature, wrote them?", "correct": "William Butler Yeats", "options": ["James Joyce", "Samuel Beckett", "Seamus Heaney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats.\n\n\t\"The Second Coming\" treats the decline and collapse of Western civilization, which Yeats believed to be imminent. \"And what rough beast,\" the poem asks in response to the hope of a Second Coming of Christ, \"its hour come round at last / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\"\r Chinua Achebe's classic novel \"Things Fall Apart,\" which tells the story of the collapse of a native Nigerian civilization in the wake of colonization, takes its title from these lines. \n"}, {"text": "VinCENT van Gogh is one of the more famous People covered on this website. His paintings are justly famous, but many people focus on the more bizarre aspects of his life, such as the fact that he cut off part of his own left earlobe and gave it to a prostitute. At the time of this 1888 event, van Gogh was distraught over the end of his friendship with what other painter, famous for his scenes of Tahiti?", "correct": "Paul Gauguin", "options": ["Theo van Gogh", "Eug\u00e8ne Boch", "Pierre-Auguste Renoir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul Gauguin.\n\n\tGauguin (1848-1903) and van Gogh (1853-1890) met in Paris the year before van Gogh's breakdown. This was a fruitful time in van Gogh's life; the Impressionist colors and uses of light that he first encountered in Paris had a great impact on his own post-Impressionist work. When van Gogh moved to Arles in 1888, he invited several artists to join him in painting there, but his dreams of forming an artists' colony were dashed when Gauguin was the only one to come.The month they spent painting together seriously damaged their friendship, and Gauguin left after  van Gogh's breakdown. Van Gogh killed himself a little over a year after this event; Gauguin struggled all his life with mental illness, but was renewed artistically and emotionally when he moved to the south Pacific in 1891. \n"}, {"text": "Reba MCENTire made her name as a country singer, and her acting success cements her status as a Celebrity. From 2001 to 2007, she starred as a struggling but clever single mother in the television sitcom \"Reba\". By the time of the show, she had personal experience with divorce -- but had she experienced raising a child on her own?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tReba McEntire's first marriage, to rodeo star Charlie Battles, failed in 1987 after 11 years; she was 32. They had no children, however; Reba waited for motherhood until her second marriage, to manager and steel guitar player Narvel Blackstock. Their son Shelby Steven McEntire Blackstock was born in 1990.\r At the time \"Reba\" ran (and, indeed, at the time of this writing) the McEntire-Blackstock marriage was going strong, so Reba had to draw on her imagination and acting talents to portray her character's trials raising three children after her divorce. Her work won her a People's Choice Award in 2002, a Family Television Award in 2005, and a Golden Globe nomination in 2004. \n"}, {"text": "A CENTurion was an officer of the Roman army, but one particular centurion played an important role in Religion as well as the military. According to the Bible, this devout and upright soldier sought out Simon Peter and became the first Gentile (non-Jew) to convert to Christianity. What was the name of this man?", "correct": "Cornelius", "options": ["Paul", "Stephen", "Ananias"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCornelius.\n\n\tChapter 10 of the Book of Acts tells the story. Peter received a vision of unclean animals made clean by God, but was unsure what it might mean -- and then who should come to his door but Cornelius, not only a Gentile but a soldier of Rome, instructed by an angel to ask Peter about God. \"You yourselves know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or to visit a Gentile,\" Peter told them, \"but God has shown me that I should not call anyone profane or unclean\" (Acts 10:28). He then taught Cornelius and his companions about Jesus Christ, they were touched by the Holy Spirit and began speaking in many languages, and finally they were baptized.The controversy over Gentile involvement in the early church continued, but Cornelius's conversion set Christianity on the path to becoming a widespread world religion rather than a local one. \n"}, {"text": "50 CENT is an American rapper who burst onto the Music scene in 2003, selling over 850,000 copies of his commercial debut album in only four days. What is the title of this album -- a title shared with a 2005 film about his life?", "correct": "Get Rich or Die Tryin'", "options": ["Before I Self Destruct", "The Massacre", "Home of the Brave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGet Rich or Die Tryin'.\n\n\tBorn Curtis James Jackson III in 1975, 50 Cent had a troubled early life. His mother, only fifteen when he was born, dealt cocaine on the streets; although she was murdered when he was only eight, he later turned to drug dealing himself. He could have been a statistic; he could have become a casualty of the streets, his name forgotten by all but his family. That he didn't is due to two things: the 1997 birth of his son, Marquise, who inspired him to seek a more peaceful career in music; and to luck, which saved him from a 2000 attack in which he was shot nine times at close range.\r \"Get Rich or Die Tryin',\" produced by rappers Dr. Dre and Eminem, was a smashing success -- especially for a debut album. Two singles from the album (\"In da Club\" and \"21 Questions\") hit #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. His musical success, combined with his compelling biography, explains the moderately successful movie \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\", in which 50 Cent plays a character based on himself. \n"}, {"text": "Let's try a Brain Teaser next. What follows is a fractured word clue: if you read the phrase aloud, it should sound like a well-known word (which, naturally, contains the letters CENT). What word is represented by the following phrase?\n\nEGGS END TRICK", "correct": "eccentric", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\neccentric.\n\n\tThe word \"ecCENTric\" refers to something that is bizarre, strange, or off-kilter. In geometry, an oval is regarded as an eccentric circle; a very narrow oval, so thin as to be a straight line, has an eccentricity of one hundred percent. A fun but cynical saying sums up its use with respect to people: \"The poor are insane; the rich are eccentric\". \n"}, {"text": "CENTipedes are justly famous in the Animal kingdom for their segmented bodies and impressive number of legs. Which of these traits do all centipedes have in common?", "correct": "A pair of poison claws on the first body segment", "options": ["Compound eyes with 100 sections each", "Exactly 100 total legs", "Mating habits which conclude with the decapitation of the male"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pair of poison claws on the first body segment.\n\n\tDespite their name -- \"centipede\" comes from the Latin for \"hundred feet\" -- the several thousand worldwide centipede species can have anywhere from 30 legs to nearly 400, with one pair of legs per body segment. (Millipedes, \"thousand feet,\" have two pairs of legs per segment, for a total of between 80 and 750 legs.) The structure of their eyes also varies immensely from species to species, and mating does not occur individual-to-individual for any centipede -- instead, the male deposits a sperm capsule, which he then tries to lure the female into accepting.\r All centipedes, however, have poisonous claws (instead of legs) on the segment closes to the head, which helps make them fearsome predators in their weight class. The largest known centipede, Scolopendra gigantea, hails from the Amazon and is known to devour bats -- it can reach about a foot (30 cm) in length! \n"}, {"text": "The world of Sports gives us the phrase \"CENTury break,\" referring to the scoring of 100 points in one turn -- without missing a shot. A player seeking a century break must begin the turn with at least ten red balls on the table, putting them in the pockets in alternation with the colored balls. In what sport can a century break thus be achieved?", "correct": "Snooker", "options": ["Three-cushion billiards", "Eight-ball", "Straight billiards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnooker.\n\n\tThe sports listed are all cue sports, played using a long stick (a cue) to move billiard balls around on a table. Tables for straight and three-cushion billiards lack pockets; instead of sinking the balls, the challenge is to strike two balls (and, in the three-cushion version, three rails) with the cue ball. Eight-ball does use pocketed tables, with players attempting to sink either the striped balls or the solids, and finish up the game with the solid-black ball marked with a number eight. \r Snooker has more complex rules: it begins with fifteen red balls (each worth one point) and six colored balls (with values ranging from 2 to 7 points). The object is to use the cue and cue ball to pocket these balls in a specific order -- a red ball, then a colored ball (which is immediately replaced on the table), a red ball, and so on. When the red balls have all been pocketed, the colored balls are sunk in point order. A single game (from all object balls on the table to none) is called a frame; a single turn at the table is called a break; and a century break is thus a player scoring 100 points in a single turn. Traditionally, the highest-scoring possible break yields 147 points. \n"}, {"text": "Regular Television viewers may recall the thirteenth-season \"Simpsons\" episode \"Half-DeCENT Proposal,\" in which billionaire bachelor Artie Ziff offers one of Springfield's lovely ladies a million dollars to spend the weekend with him. On which of these femmes fatales does he set his sights?", "correct": "Marge Simpson", "options": ["Agnes Skinner", "Edna Krabappel", "Patty Bouvier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarge Simpson.\n\n\tArtie, who made his fortune on a device that creates easy listening music out of modem noise, has been obsessed with Marge Simpson (nee Bouvier) since high school. Having blown their prom date with his \"busy hands\", Artie has since converted his mansion into a rather creepy shrine to Marge -- but despite this history, Marge accepts his offer in order to pay for anti-snoring surgery for Homer. Can Marge's and Homer's marriage be saved?\r This episode parodies the 1993 movie \"Indecent Proposal,\" in which Robert Redford makes a similar offer to a young wife (Demi Moore). \n"}, {"text": "In 1954, Dr. Fredric Wertham's book \"Seduction of the InnoCENT\" caused a sensation in the Entertainment industry. Arguing that comic-book depictions of sex and violence caused delinquent behavior among children, Wertham's testimony led to the establishment of a self-censorship board for comic book publishers. What is the name of this board, whose seal still appears on approved comic books?", "correct": "Comics Code Authority", "options": ["Office of Graphic Novel Classification", "Comic Content Rating Association", "Comics Decency Board"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComics Code Authority.\n\n\t\"Seduction of the Innocent\", filled with juicy anecdotes and lavishly illustrated with objectionable scenes from comic books, caused a minor panic when it was released. Although many of Wertham's arguments (such as the alleged concealment of naughty images in the shading of muscles or tree bark) seem rather strange today, and others (such as Wonder Woman as a subversive role model for young girls) are downright laughable, in other areas he did have a point: gruesome crime stories were marketed to children -- complete with advertisements for knives -- and comic shop owners sometimes felt coerced by publishers into carrying titles that made them uncomfortable.\r The resulting Comic Code Authority (CCA), founded by the comic book publishers in fear of government censorship, was a mixed bag. It banned the most grotesque scenes and storylines, but also insisted that all storylines must end with the punishment of the malefactor and a victory by good over evil. It made no distinction between comic books read by children and those read by adults, denying those adults a free choice of reading matter. And some of its prohibitions were overly strict, as the makers of \"Spider-Man\" discovered when they ran a 1971 story -- at the request of the U.S. government -- showing drug use as dangerous and ugly. This story was denied a CCA seal because it mentioned drugs at all! The CCA is now much less powerful than it was -- Marvel Comics, for example, decided in 2001 to switch to its own internal ratings system -- and some parts of the code have been changed with the times. \n"}, {"text": "We'll delve into Movies now, for a look at the 1992 film that won Al Pacino his first Academy Award. \"SCENT of a Woman\" treats the developing friendship between a retired Army colonel (Pacino) and a poor prep-school student (Chris O'Donnell) during a fraught time in both their lives. With what disability is Pacino's character afflicted?", "correct": "Blindness", "options": ["Brain damage", "Deafness", "Loss of a leg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlindness.\n\n\tMedically discharged after having been blinded in an accident, the colonel seeks one last, wild weekend in New York City before committing suicide. The student, facing financial difficulties as well as disciplinary trouble at school, is hired to take care of the colonel -- never expecting that this simple trip will turn out to be of such importance.\r Pacino was roundly praised for his acting in \"Scent of a Woman\", a remake of a 1974 Italian movie (\"Profumo di donna\"). When he won his Oscar for Best Actor, the only surprise most observers admitted to was that it had not come sooner! \n"}, {"text": "When it comes to Mount Everest, most people tend to focus on its altitude (a healthy 8,848 meters or 29,028 feet) -- but its Geography is equally fascinating. Climbers have a choice of asCENTs to the top of the mountain, but the most popular choice is along the southeastern ridge. After a few weeks of acclimatization at a base camp, they traverse the Khumbu icefall and climb the face of Lhotse, a nearby mountain, on their way to the peak. In what country does this ascent begin?", "correct": "Nepal", "options": ["China", "India", "Bhutan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNepal.\n\n\tEverest straddles the border between Nepal and Tibet (which China annexed in 1951); its south face, along with the easiest climbing route, is in Nepal, while its north face is in China. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary, who in 1953 became the first people to reach the summit, used this southerly route to achieve their goal.\r Of course, \"easiest\" is a relative term. The high altitude of the peak means the summit is in a \"death zone\" (yes, that's really what they call it) -- featuring lack of oxygen, a slippery landscape, high winds, and intense cold. Even before reaching the death zone, climbers must face deadly, shifting ice in the Khumbu icefall, rope climbs, and occasional storms. Up to 15 people a year die on the slopes of Mount Everest. I think I'll stick to reading about it! \n"}, {"text": "A quick perusal of the Humanities category reveals that the ancient Greeks told of CENTaurs, beings who consisted of a human head and torso joined to the body of a horse. The most famous of these was Chiron, the gentle and intelligent teacher of innumerable legendary figures. Which of these heroes of the Iliad, the son of the sea nymph Thetis, did Chiron raise?", "correct": "Achilles", "options": ["Telemachus", "Hector", "Odysseus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAchilles.\n\n\tChiron, a half-brother of Zeus, was different from the other centaurs (who traced their ancestry to the union of a murderous king and a Hera-shaped raincloud). Where Chiron was educated and civilized, the others were drunk, violent, and best known for their attempt to carry off a whole tribe's worth of women (the Lapiths) for their own nefarious purposes. Nevertheless, numerous mythological parents were able to overcome these stereotypes and trust to Chiron's true, virtuous nature. In addition to raising Achilles (after Thetis left her family) and his friend Patroclus, Chiron also taught Jason (of Argonaut fame), Actaeon (later transformed into a stag and eaten by his own dogs), and Asclepius (demigod of medicine). \r Also considered a trusted figure by more modern authors, Chiron guards the seventh circle of hell in Dante's \"Inferno,\" assists Faust in Goethe's play of the same name, and is a prominent character in John Updike's \"The Centaur.\" \n"}, {"text": "Mathematics is the language of Sci/Tech, and data ranging from measurement errors to survey results are presented in the form of perCENTages, or parts per hundred. Which of the following numbers is equivalent to 80%?", "correct": "0.8", "options": ["8/100", "80.0", "4/6"], "explanation": "\n\n\n0.8\n\n\t80% is equal to 80/100, a fraction that reduces to 4/5. In decimal form, this is equal to 0.8, or eight tenths.\r Percentage problems remind many people uncomfortably of primary-school math class, but being able to convert between percentages and other number formats is a handy skill. If you're considering an elective surgery with an 80% success rate, it's useful to understand that the surgery fails for one out of every five patients. If you're considering whether clipping a 5% coupon is really worthwhile for a $20 purchase, it's helpful to be able to calculate that 5% of $20 = 0.05 * $20.00 = $1 off from the purchase price. And even more useful is the knowledge that, after answering this question, you're 85% done with the quiz! \n"}, {"text": "Players frequenting the Hobbies category may know that, in addition to their beauty, agave plants of various types can be distilled to produce alcohol. One of these species, the CENTury plant or maguey (Agave americana), is used to make which of these spirits?", "correct": "Mezcal", "options": ["Brandy", "Mead", "Gin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMezcal.\n\n\tTequila, perhaps the most famous agave-derived spirit, can only legally be made from the blue agave (Agave tequilana); spirits derived from the Century plant are called mezcal. The central bulbs of an agave plant are removed, baked in underground ovens, and carefully smashed to extract a sweet juice, which is then distilled to produce the mezcal. \r The Century plant is named for its long life cycle, which is actually closer to 25 years than to 100. When it flowers, which it does only once before its death, the plant's cluster of spiky leaves produces a 25-foot (8-meter) stalk to support its yellow blossoms. Mezcal farmers chop off this stalk once it begins to form, so that the plant's energy is redirected towards its juicy center. \n"}, {"text": "At the close of the popular \"Civilization\" Video Games, one of the ways players can win is to launch a spaceship and colonize a star system. Which strategy game, also developed by Sid Meier, follows the fate of the colonization mission?", "correct": "Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri", "options": ["Sid Meier's Centaurs in Space", "Sid Meier's Central Core", "Sid Meier's Century Mission"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSid Meier's Alpha Centauri.\n\n\t\"Sid Meier's Alpha CENTauri\" plays much like the \"Civilization\" series, but on another world. The colony group from Earth, having suffered ship malfunction and even the assassination of their captain, splits into seven factions (one per escape pod), which must each build bases, conduct research into new technologies,  and (naturally) fight wars with their neighbors. Never quite as popular as the series from which it arose, it nevertheless did quite well, even gaining a record high rating (98%) from \"PC Gamer\" magazine in April 1999. \n"}, {"text": "And now to the General category, home of odds and ends -- including this quiz! In addition to trivia mixtures, General is the place to go for numbers and anniversaries, and that's what we'll wrap up with. We name an anniversary year by taking Latin number words and multiplying them together -- thus bicentennial, bi multiplied by centennial, gives us the word for a 200-year commemoration. With this in mind, how many years does a semisesquicentennial celebrate?", "correct": "75", "options": ["150", "300", "600"], "explanation": "\n\n\n75.\n\n\tSemi- gives us one half, sesqui- gives us one and a half, and centennial gives us one hundred years. A sesquicentennial is thus 1.5 * 100 years = 150 years -- and a semisesquicentennial is half of that, or 75 years. Somehow \"75-year anniversary\" seems a little less of a mouthful!\r I hope you've enjoyed playing this quiz as much as I've enjoyed writing it. I'm looking forward to the next hundred quizzes! \n"}]}
