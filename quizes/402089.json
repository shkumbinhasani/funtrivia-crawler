{"id": "402089", "name": "\"Arrow\" 7.09 \"Elseworlds\" Quiz | Arrow | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television A-C", "Arrow"], "questions": [{"text": "Who was Diggle fighting in the opening of the episode when Supergirl, The Flash and Green Arrow appeared? ", "correct": "Deathstroke", "options": ["Reverse Flash", "A.M.A.Z.O.", "Malcolm Merlyn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeathstroke.\n\n\tHe was trying to take down Deathstroke along with four ARGUS field agents.  They were losing until the three superheroes showed up. They quickly filled him in with what had happened on the previous episode of \"The Flash\" which set up the events of this episode. \n"}, {"text": "What city were the three heroes preparing to head off to?", "correct": "Gotham City", "options": ["Starling City", "Metropolis", "Argo City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGotham City.\n\n\tGotham City had been mentioned in passing in the \"Arrowverse\" before, but hadn't been seen prior to a quick cut in \"The Flash\" episode that served as the lead in to this episode.  \"Supergirl\" is set in National City, \"Arrow\" is set in Star City and \"The Flash\" is set in Central City. \n"}, {"text": "Which hero's existence is questioned during a conversation between Barry and Olliver? ", "correct": "Batman", "options": ["Martian Manhunter", "Aquaman", "Shazam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatman.\n\n\tBatman hadn't been allowed by company executives to be used in the TV series. That was partly because there was a series not in the \"Arrowverse\" called \"Gotham\" that was running at the same time, and aptly so the character could remain special for movie viewers. Olliver maintained that he, Green Arrow, was the original vigilante and Batman was made up by the Gotham City Police, Barry thought he was real. \n"}, {"text": "Oliver Queen was arrested after defending himself in a street fight. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tGotham City Police officers recognized \"Oliver Queen\" (funny since it was Barry in Ollie's body) and arrested the trio after they had fought and disarmed people who were trying to rob them. Laurel Lance, who appeared in name only, decided they should remain in jail, but Kate Kane bailed them out of jail before telling them to leave town. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the CEO of Wayne Industries?", "correct": "Kate Kane", "options": ["Ray Palmer", "Bruce Wayne", "Oliver Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKate Kane.\n\n\tBruce Wayne had left town three years earlier. The first time she appeared on screen she made a joke about Batman having not been seen in years, so he wasn't around to compare grappling hooks. Kate later revealed to Supergirl that she was Bruce's cousin. \n"}, {"text": "Why wasn't Felicity Smoak told about the body swap between Ollie and Barry? ", "correct": "Ollie didn't want to upset her.", "options": ["She was informed.", "She didn't exist in this reality.", "She was in a mental institution."], "explanation": "\n\n\nOllie didn't want to upset her.\n\n\tOlliver had only just gotten out of jail, and their marriage was under strain, so he chose not to tell her. She was informed by a member of the team after Barry, Ollie, and Kara went to Gotham. She made a joke about it not being every day that her husband and ex-boyfriend switch bodies. \n"}, {"text": "What was the wifi password at Wayne Industries?", "correct": "Alfred", "options": ["OllieSmells", "Fizzing Whizzbees", "IAmBatman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlfred.\n\n\tNo other reference to why it was Alfred was made. But longtime comic book fans know that Alfred Pennyworth was Bruce Wayne/Batman's butler and father figure. Kate mentioned it to the trio while they were working from the Wane Industries building. \n"}, {"text": "Who played the Barry Allen from Earth-90?", "correct": "John Wesley Shipp", "options": ["Grant Gustin", "Michael Rosenbaum", "Ezra Miller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Wesley Shipp.\n\n\tAll four actors have played Barry Allen at one time or another in various adaptations of the character. \r John Wesley Shipp had previously appeared in \"The Flash\" as both Jay Garrick (a Flash from another timeline yet) and as Henry Allen, Barry's dad.  Those roles were in reference to him having played Barry Allen in 1990 on his own series, \"The Flash\" which had lasted a single season. In this episode, he revived the role completely and was seen in the same Flash suit he wore in the 1990 series. He provided the team with information on the big bad of the crossover episodes and provided some details on how to move forward heading into the final episode of the arc. \n"}, {"text": "Among the options, who was exposed to fear gas while in Arkham Asylum?", "correct": "Barry", "options": ["Ray Palmer", "Clark", "Kara"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarry.\n\n\tBarry and Ollie were both exposed. They believed each other to be Eobard Thawne (Flash villain from season one of his show) and Malcolm Merlyn (Green Arrow villain from season one of his show) while under the influence of the gas. They were exposed while fighting with Nora Fries, who in the DC Comics universe is the wife of Dr. Victor Fries, who hasn't been in any of the \"Arrowverse\" TV shows as of this crossover. \n"}, {"text": "Who woke those who were exposed to the fear gas out of their drug-induced states? ", "correct": "Batwoman", "options": ["Killer Frost", "Supergirl", "Captain Cold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatwoman.\n\n\tKate Kane/Batwoman showed up and fought both Barry and Olliver while they were drugged and fighting each other. Caitlyn (Killer Frost) just watched as Batwoman took them out, and then brought them back to consciousness. After waking them, and being joined by Supergirl, Batwoman tells them they have caused enough trouble in Gotham for one night, and to leave the city. \n"}]}
