{"id": "406691", "name": "Resident Evil 4 Quiz | Resident Evil 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 4"], "questions": [{"text": "This game takes place in a rural region of what country?", "correct": "Spain", "options": ["The United States", "France", "Kenya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpain.\n\n\tAfter the Raccoon City incident, Umbrella was exposed for its activities in the United States and prevented from continuing to develop their technologies and experiments.  Despite this, however, they didn't stop their tests elsewhere.\r Six years after Raccoon City was destroyed, Leon S. Kennedy, who survived the events there, finds himself working under the new President of the United States.  His very first job is a rescue mission, heading to Europe to locate the President's kidnapped daughter, Ashley Graham.\r It brings him to the rural villages of Spain where, after being separated by his liaison, he's forced to fight off crazed villagers.  Something is amiss. \n"}, {"text": "Leon will spend the game in contact with which remote agent, who communicates him via a satellite device?", "correct": "Ingrid", "options": ["Jill", "Rebecca", "Claire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIngrid.\n\n\tDirected by remote agent Ingrid Hunnigan, Leon will come across a quiet Spanish village and quickly find himself beset upon by locals until a church bell rings, signalling their departure.  It's only the start of the weird events to unfold, however, as he makes his way through abandoned farms and houses to find Luis Sera, a former Madrid cop, hiding from the townspeople and local prophet Osmund Saddler. It's then, captured, that Leon is injected with the Las Plagas virus, lot unlike the villagers.  What unfolds it the revelation of a cult-- Los Illuminados-- and Umbrella's influence on the region. It comes to the forefront when Leon tries to cross a lake only to face off against a gigantic fish known as Del Lago. \n"}, {"text": "Leon will find Ashley Graham in which of these spots?", "correct": "Church", "options": ["Castle", "Cave", "Coffin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChurch.\n\n\tLeon is knocked out for several hours once he survives the El Lago encounter and when he awakens his mission continues.  It leads him to a hulking beast known as El Gigante, but when he finally gets into a hilltop church he'll find the aim of his journey-- the President's daughter, Ashley Graham.  They're urged to leave the village in an extraction chopper, but Osmund Saddler, the leader of Los Illuminados, reveals that he's infected both Ashley and Leon with the intent to send them back and control them with Las Plagas. Go figure, their chopper's shot down (and another is sent) and the mob closes in.  It's getting more intense! \n"}, {"text": "Village Chief Mendez will transform into a centipede-like creature during an encounter in which of these spots?", "correct": "A burning barn", "options": ["An underground cathedral", "A cable car station", "A hidden lagoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA burning barn.\n\n\tAfter the mob encounter fought with Luis by their side, Leon and Ashley will need to make careful choices to navigate the countryside, eventually taking a cable car with the aim to reach an extraction point.  It'll lead them to the village mayor, Chief Mendez, who will attack Leon in a barn and set the building ablaze while he transforms into a multi-legged creature and bisects himself. The barn won't burn down completely, but if Leon wins the fight then Mendez will drop the False Eye and he can pass through a locked gate-- the only remaining way to go.  The chapter will end with Leon and Ashley getting forced into a castle; there's nowhere to go but inside. \n"}, {"text": "In Salazar's Castle, Leon will come face-to-face with which character from his past?", "correct": "Ada Wong", "options": ["Sherry Birkin", "Claire Redfield", "Jill Valentine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAda Wong.\n\n\tAs Leon and Ashley make their way into Salazar's Castle, Leon will lose communication with Hunnigan and need to go through to get out.  This causes its own problems however, as the castle is a maze loaded with necessary keys and items and new foes.  Eventually, he'll come into contact with the Castellan, Ramon Salazar, who'll welcome him to the castle but leave him to wander-- after all, Leon and Ashley are growing sicker and sicker due to the Las Plagas infection.\r Ashley will get captured and Leon will have to go solo through the sewers, galleries, and halls, eventually coming across a hedge maze and, at the end of that, encounter Ada Wong, once again on assignment.  She's gone as quickly as she arrives. \n"}, {"text": "Once Leon frees Ashley from her bindings in Castle Salazar, you'll be able to control her for a brief period.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThere's more navigation through the castle before things start to change for Leon, and some of these changes are bad.  Luis will appear at one point with the Plagas sample, but he'll be killed in quick order by Saddler, who'll appear to retrieve it.  Before he dies, Luis will hand over antivirals to keep Leon and Ashley's sickness at bay. Ashley, meanwhile, will also reappear; Leon can free her but be powerless to help her escape the Ganados of the castle for a while.  Instead, you'll be able to control Ashley as she navigates the darker storage spaces of the building, finding her way back to Leon and picking up Key Items along the way. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Leon encounter Verdugo?", "correct": "Beneath the castle", "options": ["In the clock tower", "At the extraction point", "In the throne room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeneath the castle.\n\n\tAlthough Leon and Ashley will continue through Salazar's Castle together, Ashley will once again prove to be a bit of a detriment when she's taken by Novistadors in the destroyed castle ballroom.  It will lead Leon on a wild trip through the castle's main floor to the throne room (even taking a couple of cart rides and climbing a clock tower) to prevent Salazar from performing the ritual to make Ashley a member of Los Illuminados. Leon will make it to the throne room, but a trap door will land him in the sewers (and later, the mines), giving Salazar the chance to send his right-hand aide, Verdugo, down to fight, and for Saddler to put Jack Krauser into action. \n"}, {"text": "Salazar will ultimately be fought atop his tower, but where will Ashley be headed at this time?", "correct": "The island", "options": ["Home", "The cemetery", "The airport"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe island.\n\n\tLeon needs to get back to the throne room or, at least, to Salazar and Ashley, so the remainder of Chapter 4 involves him resurfacing.  The trail is a straight shot that takes him through the mines (including a long mine cart track) and back into the castle where a giant statue of Salazar himself will bear down. It all leads to a culminating battle at the top of a tall tower.  While Salazar will let Leon know that Ashley has been taken onward to an island nearby, he'll transform and take a new shape that Leon will need to face off against.  If he survives, he'll hitch a ride with Ada Wong, head to the island, and split off to find the President's daughter (again). \n"}, {"text": "Is Jack Krauser infected by Las Plagas?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tLeon will run around the island looking for Ashley, reuniting with her, and then losing her again (there's a pattern to all this!) before encountering his former comrade, Jack Krauser, for a battle at the end of Chapter 5-3.  It's a rough road to get there, though, since Leon will make his way through labs and coastal caverns in pursuit of a way out of the nightmare. When Leon finally reaches a sandy fortress he'll face off against Krauser in earnest and he, as it seems, will be just one more person under Lord Saddler's influence.  Once Leon defeats him, Saddler should be the last person standing in the way of leaving with Ashley. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the game, Leon will receive a set of keys for a jetski.  What's on the keychain?", "correct": "Teddy bear", "options": ["Umbrella logo", "BSAA logo", "Rocket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeddy bear.\n\n\tLeon's last stretch will involve a number of near misses as his extraction helicopter (which finally arrives) will be shot down and the Plagas inside him will be close to ready to take over.  With Ada's help, he'll be able to reach Ashley and use the provided tools to remove the parasites from within the two of them. It'll still be up to him, however, to defeat Lord Saddler once and for all, and he'll be able to do that with (of course) a Rocket Launcher.  Ada will swoop in at the last minute to claim the Las Plagas Sample in Saddler's possession, but she'll leave Leon with a Jetski Key that he can use to get himself and Ashley of the island before it explodes. They make it clear of the caves and they're home free. \n"}]}
