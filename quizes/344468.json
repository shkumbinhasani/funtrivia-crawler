When she calls her father, he tells her not to open the door-- it's safer inside.  When she hangs up the phone, she doesn't know that the Rubberman is right behind her.  When she turns to look at him, he's gone.  Going to her room, Violet stands at the door and rubs her eyes, unaware that a hand is reaching for her from a nearby vent.  It can't grab her; she's distracted by Tate throwing pebbles at her window.  When he comes inside he gives her a black rose and assures her that everything is alright; she claims she's never gotten a flower from a boy before.  They go on their date.\rBen and Viv return home from the hospital to find the security system going off.  Violet's gone.  Ben tells Viv to call her cell phone before a knocking is heard at the front door.  When Ben answers, he finds Hayden standing on the other side.  He slams it on her.\rThe phone rings upstairs and Viv answers-- it's Violet and she assures her that everything is okay; she's out with friends and the guy at the door left earlier.

He says that kids destroyed their Halloween decor out front; Viv wonders why he needs a knife to clean it up.  She decides to take a relaxing bath considering their long day and says that in the morning, they'll discuss his moving out.  Ben says that it won't need to come to that-- he's not giving up on the family.\rWhen Ben heads outside he takes a shovel and searches the yard.  Larry shows up and Ben hits him in the head.  Ben asks him about Hayden and he says that she's still under the gazebo, but he doesn't buy it.  Ben thinks they're both in on it.  Larry says that the dead have nothing left to lose and he doesn't even get it.  Ben continues to beat him up and Larry pleads that he kill him, that way he can come back and haunt him.\rThe doorbell rings and Viv checks it to find Luke, the security guard.  Luke asks about the alarm and the mess on the lawn and Viv says everything is alright. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Violet and Tate go on their date?", "correct": "The beach", "options": ["The basement", "The woods", "A restaurant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe beach.\n\n\tOn the beach, Tate and Violet create a bonfire and spend time kissing in front of the surf.  When Tate rebuffs an advance, Violet finds herself wanting to go home but he convinces her to stay with him.  He says he used to come to the beach as an escape.  He'd look out at the ocean and realize how useless high school was.  All the famous actors dropped out.  He'd look out at the vast, limitless expanse of water and think he could do or be anything.\rViolet spies a group of kids climbing down the hills near the beach who approach them in front of the fire.  They say that Tate has finally come out of hiding and that perhaps it's time he paid.  All of them are covered in blood.  Violet and Tate decide to leave. \n"}, {"text": "What does Hayden write on Viv's bathroom mirror?", "correct": "ASK HIM", "options": ["ADULTRESS", "WATCH OUT", "YOU'RE NEXT"], "explanation": "\n\n\nASK HIM.\n\n\tViv runs a relaxing bath before her phone starts to ring-- it's Hayden.  The two of them speak with one another and Viv says that it's time for them to speak.  Hayden brings up Boston and Viv says that while she may find it hard to believe, she understands what Hayden is trying to do.  Hayden responds that there was just something about her that Ben wouldn't find in Viv, a particular freshness and vitality.  Hayden reminds her to ask about Boston before hanging up.  Viv, shutting off the faucet, sees a message written in the fog on the bathroom mirror: 'ASK HIM'.\rRunning downstairs, Viv tells Ben that Hayden is in the house.  Ben says that she's overreacting, but she thinks that she's acting as expected considering the circumstances.  Viv wants to call the cops but Ben stops her-- he knows that having ten cop cars outside the murder house on Halloween won't get them any closer to selling the house.  He takes a knife from the block in the kitchen and heads downstairs alone. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Vivian find destroying the decorations in the front yard?", "correct": "Chad", "options": ["Constance", "Patrick", "Larry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChad.\n\n\tBen calls for Hayden in the basement and she appears to him almost immediately.  She says she loves it when he says her name and he asks her to leave.  She says it's horrible that he closed the door on her face, especially on the mother of his child.  She tries to kiss him, but he holds her back.  She spits up blood; she says she's rotting from the inside out.  She complains about the gazebo-- she didn't even get a headstone.  She complains that he's a misogynist and that he can't keep doing what he's doing.  He says she needs professional help.  Their conversation ends abruptly when Larry hits Ben in the back of the head with a shovel.  Hayden says she has to deal with Vivian and Larry makes it clear that it's time to use his trusty lighter.\rUpstairs, Vivian finds Chad destroying pumpkins on the lawn, frustrated that Patrick is out at the bars hitting on other guys.  He claims that he just wanted one night with his husband in the house that he loves-- his house-- and she took it from him.  She threatens to call the security company and he chases her inside. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Larry set on fire?", "correct": "Viv's towels", "options": ["Violet's bed", "The basement stairs", "The gazebo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViv's towels.\n\n\tSearching the house for Ben, Vivian finds the bathroom door unlocked.  She doesn't know that Hayden is occupying her bathtub.  She rushes for the security remote and clicks the button.  When she hears the dog barking in the hallway she sees smoke under one of the doors.  Looking inside, her towels are on fire.  She's able to put them out.\rGetting home, Violet asks Tate about the kids at the beach but he doesn't know who they were.  Violet can tell Tate is freaked out. When they hear the dog barking, they find that the kids have followed them back home.  Violet grabs a pair of scissors.\rViv finds her phone on the floor and picks it up to find Hayden on the other end.  Hayden apologizes and says that she didn't want the bath to go to waste.  Viv looks in to find bloody water.  Hayden asks \"why don't you come over here girl\" and Viv says she'd like to, but Hayden responds that she wasn't talking to her-- also, she loves what she's done with the kitchen.  When Viv goes downstairs, golf club in hand, she sees dog food spilled on the floor and hears the microwave running in the pantry.  The item in the microwave explodes red. \n"}, {"text": "Did Hayden kill Vivian's dog?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tOutside, Violet confronts the teens with her scissors.  She tells them to go home, but they explain that they really don't have a home to go to.  They think she's worse than Tate because she thinks what he did to them is okay.  Violet explains that she doesn't know.  They tell her to read the paper or a yearbook; they're famous.  Tate tells her to go outside and he runs down the street.  They chase him down.  Violet calls the cops on her cell before Constance drags her aside.  She tells her to leave her alone, but Constance says that Addy is dead because of her.\rIn the bedroom, Vivian opens the closet door to find her dog inside, alive and well after the microwave scare.  When the dog leaves, Viv finds Hayden at her bedroom door.  Hayden suggests that Ben might be capable of more than Viv will ever know, perhaps even murder, but Viv says she can't be shocked.  Hayden says that Viv needs to know about Boston, the pregnancy, and everything else, and Viv is surprised that she knows about her pregnancy.  Hayden didn't.  Realizing the truth, Hayden believes that Ben decided he couldn't be with her since Viv was already having his child; he didn't need Hayden's.  She breaks a picture on the mantle, picks up a glass shard, and approaches Viv. \n"}, {"text": "Who unties Ben in the basement?", "correct": "Nora", "options": ["Charles", "Violet", "Tate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNora.\n\n\tIn the living room, Larry starts dousing the walls and floor with gasoline.  Chad finds him beginning to commit arson and asks what he's doing to HIS house.\rIn the basement, Ben awakens, tied up.  He sees Nora in front of him and she unties him, feeling that she can't let her get away with taking away the only meaning in his life.  She will not permit another failure in this house.  She whispers in his ear-- he needs to save the baby.\rBen walks in on Hayden preparing to end Viv's life and the life of her unborn child.  He tells her to stop, but both of them ask him to tell Viv about Boston.  He admits that he went to the East Coast to help Hayden because she needed him.  He lied to her.  Hayden puts down the glass as Luke enters, gun drawn.  Hayden goes willingly. \n"}, {"text": "Tate is the son of which character?", "correct": "Constance", "options": ["Nora", "Moira", "Vivian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConstance.\n\n\tIn Constance's kitchen, Violet is told about the visit to the morgue.  When Constance saw her daughter on the slab, she decided to apply make-up to her face, making her the pretty girl she always wanted to be.  When a parent dies, she says, the child fears their mortality.  When the child dies, however, a parent loses immortality.\rViolet apologizes for the loss, but Constance realizes that she was just trying to be kind.  The world will do what it will do.  Constance says that Addy was more like her than any of her other children.  Violet was unaware that Constance had other kids; Tate, she discovers, was Constance's son.  Constance says that Tate can not yet know that Addy has passed on as he does not react well.  She explains that Tate likes her so much because she's so strong.  They need to protect him. \n"}, {"text": "When do the ghosts return to the Harmon household?", "correct": "At sunrise", "options": ["When their work is done", "When the bells chime", "They don't"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt sunrise.\n\n\tTate returns to the beach and stops running; the other kids catch up.  They explain that he killed them all, put guns to their heads, and showed no mercy.  He owes them an explanation.  Tate says that they have the wrong guy and they need to get out of his head.  They ask him to say what he did; one girl says that she should be thirty-four years old.  He persists...he doesn't know them.  They leave as the sun starts to rise.\rMoira, Chad, and the other ghosts of the Harmon household begin their walk back to the property.  They feel doomed.\rLuke drives Hayden to the police station and she says that she once had Ben.  She didn't even intend to hurt Viv's feelings with the microwave prank; they were tomatoes she cooked.  When they pull up to the station, Luke notices that the back seat of his cruiser is empty.\rBen packs his things.  He finds Vivian in the kitchen and kisses her on the forehead.  She looks on wearily as he takes his bags and departs. \n"}]}
