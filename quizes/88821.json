You go out to milk the goats, and your prize Nubian, who ate a bit too much grass yesterday, has a heck of a bellyache. She's standing away from the others, looking kind of droopy, and her stomach is distended. What do you do for her first?", "correct": "Give her some Gas-X", "options": ["Give her some Pepto-Bismol", "Give her some Tums", "Give her some Metamucil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGive her some Gas-X.\n\n\tThese are the symptoms of bloat, a buildup of gas in the rumen. Bloat can be a real emergency, and can kill a goat quickly. Gas-X contains a surfactant, simethicone, which breaks down the gas bubbles in the goat's stomach and allows her to burp them up. If the Gas-X doesn't work, you might have to pass a stomach tube to let the gas out. \n"}, {"text": "After you  finish milking the goat does, you check on your bucks. Eeew!

They don't like to get wet, and a fan won't help because they don't sweat (they use their ears to radiate heat.)They will cuddle up to the cold bottle. \n"}, {"text": "Now on to those crowing hens...yes, hens. Even the rooster looks perplexed as that cute young thing lets out a high-pitched but definite crow. What the heck is going on?", "correct": "Could be any of these", "options": ["She has a hormonal imbalance", "Maybe she's a he", "Nothing-it's normal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCould be any of these.\n\n\tSome hens crow, but always in a shriller and higher-pitched voice than a real rooster.
