{"id": "169543", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Interview' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "'The Interview' was interesting and unique for several reasons, not least of which revolved around its documentary style format.  Which of these is NOT true about this episode?", "correct": "It features the entire 'M*A*S*H' cast", "options": ["It was broadcast in black and white", "It was Larry Gelbart's last episode", "It involved a great deal of spontaneity with the actors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt features the entire 'M*A*S*H' cast.\n\n\tFilmed in black and white, 'The Interview' was one of the truly unique episodes of 'M*A*S*H' history, and did indeed mark the end of Larry Gelbart's four-year run on the show.  Apparently, the actors were allowed to make some impromptu responses to the questions delivered to them by the interviewer.  Gelbart believed that the actors knew their characters best, and was willing to give such latitude.  Sadly, we don't see Margaret; Loretta Swit made appearances in only a certain percentage of episodes during the first several seasons. \n"}, {"text": "Clete Roberts, who does the interviewing during the episode called 'The Interview', was an actual news correspondent during the Korean War.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tClete Roberts (Feb 1, 1912-Sep 30, 1984) was a journalist who worked during both World War II and the Korean War.  This was the first of two appearances by Roberts on 'M*A*S*H', he also shows up in the one-hour episode called 'Our Finest Hour' during year seven, also in black and white. \n"}, {"text": "Roberts asks each of the interviewees what they have found most difficult about adjusting to their situation in Korea.  What is Hawkeye's response?", "correct": "That everything is painted green", "options": ["Problems with the latrines", "That he doesn't have access to fresh food", "That the boys he is working on are so young"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat everything is painted green.\n\n\tHawkeye complains that everything is green in the army, except for the vegetables, of course.  The only thing that is not painted green, according to Hawkeye, is the blood...and there's lots of that! \n"}, {"text": "Klinger talks fondly about his wife and about Toledo during 'The Interview'.  Naturally, he mentions his favorite restaurant in his home city, a place that serves 'Hungarian hot dogs with chili peppers'.  What is this restaurant called?", "correct": "Tony Packo's", "options": ["Top Dog", "Norman's", "Red Hots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTony Packo's.\n\n\tThis is Klinger's first of many mini-advertisements for Tony Packo's hot dogs, a staple establishment for fine cuisine in northern Ohio.  From what I understand, Tony Paco's is an actual restaurant in Toledo. \n"}, {"text": "Radar regales us by describing one of his many hobbies at the 4077th.  Apparently, according to his interview during this episode, Radar raises what type of creatures?", "correct": "Earthworms", "options": ["Spiders", "Bumblebees", "Frogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarthworms.\n\n\tRadar claims to raise earthworms, and has 160,000 to 180,000 currently occupying an area of dirt at the 4077th.  He provides the earthworms to local farmers, as they are good for the dirt, according to Radar.  He also races earthworms and cockroaches!  During the description of this hobby, Radar wonders if it is okay to say 'latrine' on television. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the 4077th claims that his time in Korea has not changed him at all?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Potter", "Mulcahy", "BJ"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tWhen asked if 'this experience has changed you in any way', Frank responds, 'Certainly not!'  The thing that Frank has had the most difficult time adjusting to in Korea is the lack of patriotism.  Frank's answers are always pithy...short and to the point.  Later, Frank calls marriage the 'headstone' of American society (as opposed to 'cornerstone'). \n"}, {"text": "Which character muses rather somberly that, on cold days when the doctors perform surgery on wounded patients, steam is emitted from the patients' bodies?", "correct": "Mulcahy", "options": ["Potter", "Klinger", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMulcahy.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy then goes on to describe how the doctors warm their hands using the body heat of the patients.  Almost in tears, the good Father comments, 'Could anyone look on that and not feel changed?' \n"}, {"text": "Roberts asks the various interviewees who their heroes are.  What is Colonel Potter's response to this question?", "correct": "Abraham Lincoln", "options": ["Isaac Newton", "Ernest Hemingway", "Nathan Hale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbraham Lincoln.\n\n\tPotter says about Lincoln, 'I think in so many ways he was the most interesting American that ever lived.'  He continues, 'He would have been a great doctor.  Such a gentle man, had such compassion, such humor, and yet there was a terrific toughness about him.  He was a real fighter, right up to the very end.  He was of the common people, and he never lost that.'  He suggests that Harry Truman is 'that kind of man'.  I think Harry Morgan was shooting from the cuff here. \n"}, {"text": "When Roberts allows the various interviewees to say 'hello' to their friends and family back home, who mentions Harry Truman?", "correct": "Hawkeye", "options": ["Potter", "BJ", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye.\n\n\tHawkeye says 'hello' to Harry Truman and his wife Bess, and wonders why Bess hasn't written back.  Radar and Klinger are tickled to say hello to their families, while BJ tells his wife that he loves her.  The Colonel thinks that such a thing would be 'undignified' and thus doesn't make any greetings.  Frank doesn't either because he thinks it's unnecessary, he knows how the people at home feel about him. \n"}, {"text": "When describing his situation in Korea, BJ calls himself which of the following?", "correct": "Temporarily misassigned civilian", "options": ["Randomly situated non-combatant", "Private citizen in borrowed fatigues", "A common surgeon in uncommon circumstances"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTemporarily misassigned civilian.\n\n\tThe episode ends with several of the most poignant comments during the interviews.  It is well-known that 'M*A*S*H' was an anti-war television show, and particularly this episode (which aired in 1976) was responding to the aftermath of the Vietnam War.  The final words heard during the episode are Hawkeye's 'It's crazy'.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
