Elaine brags to the doctor that she is going to Kenya to steal an idea for sandals from the Masai natives.  Later, George comments that her skin will be bubbling due to the intense heat.\rJerry later asks George and Elaine if they want to go to the Tonight Show where he will be performing.  George decides to take his parents along as well.

Jerry mentions that they're considering moving back to Del Boca Vista, but in the meantime, they're staying at Uncle Leo's while Leo stays with his new girlfriend.  Meanwhile, Kramer is disappointed that all of the apartments in the building are having new shower heads installed that are on a low-flow system and Elaine wonders why George's parents never moved to Florida like all other retired Americans.

Jerry realizes that the only way he can get back his 1,200-mile buffer zone is by getting Uncle Leo to move back into his place, but to do that he needs to end his relationship with Lydia.  During lunch with his uncle, Jerry tries to sway Leo into ruining his relationship by saying he could date women twenty years younger than he is. \n"}, {"text": "What does Elaine's urine sample test positive for?", "correct": "Opium", "options": ["Cocaine", "Marijuana", "Diabetes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOpium.\n\n\tWhile Elaine excitedly reads an article about African bushmen, J. Peterman walks in to inform her that she will not be accompanying him in Kenya because the doctors tested her urine and they came back with a positive result for opium.  She denies the claim and vows that she will take a pop urine test to prove that she never did drugs.  Peterman gives her the second chance, and once again, to her dismay, she tests positive.\rMeanwhile, George tries to get his parents interested in moving to Florida by saying that the weather is too cold in New York for them to be staying around.  Estelle says that he's probably just trying to get rid of them, but George says that he just cares about them (which he clearly doesn't). \n"}, {"text": "Who goes to Elaine in search of a shower with adequate water pressure?", "correct": "Kramer", "options": ["Jerry", "Newman", "George"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKramer.\n\n\tOnce the shower heads are installed, Kramer, Jerry, and Newman all realize that the idea was horrible as each of them can't get the shampoo out of their hair with low-flow nozzles.  Kramer decides to ask Elaine as he can't feel good without a proper shower, but when J. Peterman overhears their conversation, he assumes that Elaine is dealing opium to people.
