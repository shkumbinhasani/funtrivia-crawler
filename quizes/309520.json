Because both 6 and 9 represent a G, I will not be using 9.  All answers with a G will use a 6.  To answer these calculator words, I will give you the definition of a word.  What you must do is give me the numbers that you would type in order to see the word on the calculator.  To see the word, the calculator must be flipped.\n\nFor example, if I said \"What you might say to scare someone.\" The answer would be \"boo.\" But instead of typing in \"boo,\" you would type in \"008\" (8=B, 0=O). Remember, you would not type this in as \"800\", because you need to flip the calculator to read the word \"boo\"! Be careful how you type your answers\n\nOk, to start, here is your key.\n\n1=I\n2=Z\n3=E\n4=H\n5=S\n6=G\n7=L\n8=B\n0=O\n\nFirst word: What calculator word means \"the noises turkeys make?\"\n\nRemember, type what you would have to input into a calculator to see the word.
