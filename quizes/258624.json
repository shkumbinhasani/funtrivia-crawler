{"id": "258624", "name": "How much do you know about Classic Video Games? | Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture", "Arcade Games Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "1983: Kapt'n Krooz'r must shoot monsters in matching pairs in order to destroy them. (The first is temporarily frozen until its twin is also shot, or if a mismatched monster is shot.)  In later rounds, if mismatched monsters are shot, their top and bottom halves exchange, and they must be unscrambled before being destroyed.", "correct": "Wacko", "options": ["Lost In Space", "Monster Madness", "Krooz'r Kontrol"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWacko.\n\n\tThis had an interesting cabinet design.  The right side of the control panel and the game's marquee were 3-4\" lower than the left side, so they slanted about 20 degrees. \n"}, {"text": "1983: You are a police mouse, retrieving stolen goods from a house full of burglar-cats (not catburglars 8-) ).  You collect 5 pairs of items, earning a multiplication bonus if they're picked up in pair order.  You bounce between floors of the house on trampolines, where you're safe from the cats.  However, you can only bounce 3 times in a row on a trampoline, or else it breaks.  Also helping you are \"microwave doors\", which when opened will push any cats pursuing you away.", "correct": "Mappy", "options": ["Burglar-Cats", "Long Arm of the Paw", "Cat-n-Mouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMappy.\n\n\tThis machine had a unique marquee.  Instead of a standard 8 x 22 marquee, it had a 16.5 x 22 marquee backlit by a light box that was mounted atop the main cabinet. \n"}, {"text": "1984: You control a ball rolling through an obstacle course.  Besides steering clear of the sheer drop-offs, you must avoid munchers, acid pools, an evil ball, hammers, etc. The playing field includes a maze, ice patches, a funnel, catapult, sine-wave carpet, and jump ramps you must go off of fast enough to jump crevasses.", "correct": "Marble Madness", "options": ["Steel Balls", "Roller Derby", "Orbs!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarble Madness.\n\n\tThis game's only control was one rollerball per player.  (It had two for two-player race format.)  Playing it for hours produces a significant bruise on the perimeter of one's palm. \n"}, {"text": "1981: A combination of 5 video games.  Players must go through 5 levels - space invaders, laser attack, galaxians, space warp, and flag ship - to advance their rank.  Each round of 5 gets harder.", "correct": "Gorf", "options": ["Pentawarrior", "Space Attack", "Galaxian Plus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGorf.\n\n\tThis game combined a couple of then-popular games - \"Space Invaders\" and \"Galaxian\" - with 3 non-specific space games.  The game was so popular that many arcades had entire rows of just this game.  \"Gorf\" - according to an early flyer - stood for Galactic Orbiting Robot Force. \n"}, {"text": "1983: You are a secret agent, driving a special spy car down an endless highway.  The enemy agents are after you, all driving dark blue sedans, boats, or helicopters.  They try to ram, shoot, slash, or bomb you off the road.  Along the way you can add weapons to your car: missiles, oil slicks, or smoke screens.  You can also take side roads that let you take to the water on a speed boat (where your oil slick lights on fire when released).  ", "correct": "Spy Hunter", "options": ["Peter Gunn", "James Bond", "Secret Agent Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpy Hunter.\n\n\tThis game came in two cabinet styles: upright and sit-down.  The latter was preferrable, because when you got good at this game, you could go for hours.  (One friend of mine went 6 hours!)  It played the \"Peter Gunn\" them over and over, which was OK because it was a very jazzy, cool version.\r It's sequel, \"Spy Hunter II\", did very poorly, as it changed the point-of-view and quality of graphics. \n"}, {"text": "1983: Players - from 1 to 4 - competed in various decathalon events, tapping buttons to run faster or to gather more height.  (US name)", "correct": "Track & Field", "options": ["Olympians", "Olympiad", "Decathalon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrack & Field.\n\n\tThis game also came in two cabinet styles: upright and a horizontal model that allowed up to 4 players to compete.  \r The buttons wore out relatively quickly, because the faster you tapped on them, the faster your character ran in the game. \n"}, {"text": "1982: You are flying an attack shuttle through a pseudo-3-D (orthographic) course, destroying fuel dumps, gun implacements, missiles, enemy fighters, force fields, and robots.  ", "correct": "Zaxxon", "options": ["Defender", "Mission to Mars", "Trancers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZaxxon.\n\n\tZaxxon is the name of the killer robot you must destroy at the end of each round.  \r This was one of the first games to utilize an orthogonal perspective in the gameplay. \n"}, {"text": "1981: You fly behind formations of aliens in space (who come into formation in various loopy maneuvers).  But don't shoot them all immediately.  If you're patient (and have an extra ship), allow one of the big aliens to tractor beam your ship away.  Then, shoot that big alien when he attacks in formation with your captured ship.  Once your first ship is released, you have a double-shooting ship with which to dispatch aliens.", "correct": "Galaga", "options": ["Space Invaders", "Galaxian", "Attack!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGalaga.\n\n\tThis game had a couple of involved cheats that would cause the alien fighters to stop firing missiles at you.  \r It was one of the first (along with Pac-Man) to use color monitors rather than black-and-white monitor with colored overlays. \n"}, {"text": "1984: A simple one-on-one hockey game.  It left skate trails on the ice as the game proceeded, which were cleaned up at the end of the game by a Zamboni.", "correct": "Hat Trick", "options": ["Slap Shot", "Five for Fighting", "Hockey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHat Trick.\n\n\tThe name derives from a Victorian Era term for when a magician pulled three rabbits from his hat.  In modern parlance, it means three feats, goals, wickets, etc., performed in a row by the same player in a sport. \n"}, {"text": "1982: This game goes medieval.  You are a knight atop a flying ostrich.  You are trying to defeat enemy Buzzard-Riders by hitting them while your lance is higher than theirs.  Defeated, they turn into eggs, which you must collect before they re-hatch into more skilled flyers.", "correct": "Joust", "options": ["Lance", "In Days Of Old", "Renaissance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoust.\n\n\tThis game also has lava pits in which a vaporous hand will reach up and grab the player who flies too low.\r Another enemy was a pterodactyl.  It would appear if you were taking too long in clearing a level.  It could be killed if you lanced him just right in his mouth. \n"}]}
