Burgerville pays very competitive wages to its employees, and all receive health-care benefits (Burgerville pays 95% of the premiums); a rarity in the fast food industry. Burgerville purchases its power from environmentally-friendly wind generators. By not using fossil fuel power, this reduces carbon emissions as much as taking 1700 cars off our freeways! \n"}, {"text": "Burgerville also supports the concept of humane farming; raising livestock without strict confinement or antibiotics.

Tom, of course, talked about how Burgerville supports local farmers who provide his company with a plethora of seasonal produce, talked about recycling, and then he spoke of his vision and the company's mission of \"Serve with Love\".\r He said something to the affect that they instruct all of their employees that of all responsibilities, they must \"Serve with Love\". He went on to say that when people go to Burgerville and they are served with love, they will be, literally, nourished with love. They will then leave Burgerville and go out into their communities and they'll have a little more love to share with their friends, neighbors, and families. That love will continue to be shared to other communities and eventually spread around the world. So in a sense, Burgerville's mission is to heal the world by sharing love.\" \n"}]}
