What is the enemy called?", "correct": "Zombie", "options": ["Infected", "Flesh-eater", "Corpse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZombie.\n\n\tAfter the Spencer Estate was contaminated, the workers were left under quarantine until they got their cravings for human flesh.  Now, all of the residents are the walking dead.  Once you kill a zombie, you either need to burn them or decapitate them.  To burn them, you'll need the oil/kerosene canteen and a lighter.  A good idea is to pile the zombies on top of another so you use less kerosene.  Another method of preventing the redead from living for a third time is to shoot them with Incendiary Rounds from your Grenade Launcher. \n"}, {"text": "The Umbrella Corporation also experimented by using the T-Virus on dogs.  What is the dog-like creation called?", "correct": "Cerberus", "options": ["Redead Dog", "Poochie", "Mauler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCerberus.\n\n\tCerberus' charge at your character and will either bite your arm or throat.  The shotgun is a powerful weapon to use, but it's also good to use the handgun.  Then again, a shot from a rocket launcher could do the trick too if you happen to acquire one. \n"}, {"text": "Crows are affected by the T-Virus.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn some locations, relatively large packs of crows will have a chance to attack you.  Although they are a bit difficult to hit, you may not need to; they'll only attack if provoked. \n"}, {"text": "One important boss in the game is a giant snake that can be found in a couple of different places.  What is the snake's name?", "correct": "Yawn", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nYawn.\n\n\tIf you are attacked by this huge reptile, you are at great risk of becoming poisoned.

You'll find Yawn in the attic and the library of the mansion. \n"}, {"text": "How many different spider breeds do you fight in the game?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Three", "One", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tThroughout the game, you will fight Web-spinners and Black Tiger Spiders.  Ugh, if only this game had no spiders.  These two arachnids are nearly the same, but the Black Tiger Spider is larger and more powerful.  Both are slow at turning, so it's good to run around them. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the shark that is found in the estate's residence?", "correct": "Neptune", "options": ["Venus", "Saturn", "Jupiter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeptune.\n\n\tNeptune will kill you in one bite.

You'll need to watch out when you're lower in the water because Neptune could drown you at any time. \n"}, {"text": "______ 42 can be found in the estate's residence, and it uses its tentacles to suck your blood.", "correct": "Plant", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlant.\n\n\tSomehow, Plant 42 has rooted itself into the basement of the residence.

The Sweeper can inflict poison damage. \n"}, {"text": "If you don't burn or decapitate humans infected with the T-Virus, what will they become?", "correct": "Crimson Heads", "options": ["Motionless...", "Redeads", "Sweepers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrimson Heads.\n\n\tCrimson Heads are basicaly more agressive Zombies with more attack power.  If you don't decapitate or burn previous zombies, you could find Crimson Heads where those previous Zombies were.  In some situations, they'll even appear if you burn every Zombie in the game. \n"}, {"text": "The final boss is Umbrella Corporation's ultimate weapon.  What is its name?", "correct": "Tyrant", "options": ["Chimera", "T-Virus", "Lisa Trevor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTyrant.\n\n\tThe Tyrant's claws can inflict a great deal of damage on your character, but it has one flaw: its heart is exposed.
