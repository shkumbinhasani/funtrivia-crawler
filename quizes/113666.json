{"id": "113666", "name": "Chinese Place Names Quiz | Chinese | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", "Languages", "Chinese"], "questions": [{"text": "Though most place names are transliterations from English or from the native languages of those localities, some are not.  An example is the term 'Zhong-guo', which refers to China itself.  What does this name literally mean in English translation?", "correct": "Middle country", "options": ["River valley", "Land of two rivers", "Western homeland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiddle country.\n\n\tThe word 'zhong' means 'middle, center' and the word 'guo' means 'land, country'.  Taken together, the term means 'middle country', something of an ethnocentric name really.  However, one must put this into perspective.  In naming China the 'middle country' the Chinese were making reference to the 'four directions', each of which contained a 'paradise'.  China itself just happened to be in the middle of these distant lands!  In ancient times people did not have the benefits of accurate mapmaking and/or globes... \n"}, {"text": "The Chinese name for Tokyo is 'Dong-jing'.  If we establish that the Chinese capital 'Bei-jing' is the northern capital and 'Nan-jing' is the southern capital, which capital would you guess 'Dong-jing' to be?", "correct": "Eastern & East & Eastern Capital & East Capital", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEastern & East & Eastern Capital & East Capital.\n\n\tIndeed, 'Dong-jing' translates as 'eastern capital' in English.  This makes sense when one considers that Japan is to the east of China!  Incidentally, there is no 'western capital' or 'Xi-jing'.  As you might have guessed: jing = capital, bei = north, nan = south, dong = east and xi = west. \n"}, {"text": "There are two locative terms that are both pronounced 'zhou' (much like the name Joe) in Chinese, both with the first tone.  'Zhou' can mean both 'state' and 'continent'.  With that in mind, 'Ou-zhou' (oh Joe) is the Chinese name for which continent?", "correct": "Europe", "options": ["North America", "Africa", "Antarctica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEurope.\n\n\tThis is a transliteration of the first syllable of 'Europe', though the pronunciation is slightly off.  Many Chinese terms have been taken directly from English and have been simply modified with Chinese characters! \n"}, {"text": "As I mentioned in the introduction, many Chinese place names are simply transliterations.  See if you can't figure out several place names by sounding them out.  Which country's Chinese name is 'Ying-guo'?", "correct": "England & Great Britain & United Kingdom & UK & U.K.", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEngland & Great Britain & United Kingdom & UK & U.K.\n\n\t'Ying-guo' is a very interesting name.  Not only is it a transliteration, with 'ying' mimicking the sound of 'Eng' in England, but it also has a literal meaning that is quite flattering.  The Chinese word 'Ying' means 'very talented person' or 'hero'.  This name is a bit ironic considering the early history of relations between England and China, but it stuck nonetheless! \n"}, {"text": "Here is another fun transliteration...take a guess!  The Chinese place name 'Jia-na-da' refers to which rather large country?", "correct": "Canada", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanada.\n\n\tThough 'Jia' doesn't have the hard 'C' sound, it's about the closest the transliterators could get.  So far as I am aware, there is no specific meaning that can be drawn from this name...it's merely a sound-alike. \n"}, {"text": "Here's an interesting transliteration, mainly because it is the same for two world cities.  See if you can't figure out one of the two world cities that is represented by the Chinese 'Ao-ke-lan'!", "correct": "Auckland & Oakland", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAuckland & Oakland.\n\n\tThe Chinese term 'Ao-ke-lan' is used to represent both the New Zealander city of Auckland and the United States bay area city Oakland.  Once again, there is no specific meaning for this name, it is simply a mimic of the English versions.  If you ever order plane tickets from Shanghai to one of these two cities, be sure to specify which one or you could end up on the wrong side of the world! \n"}, {"text": "I'm having fun with the transliterations, are you?  Here's another one to quench your wild transliteration thirst!  Which country is called 'Yi-da-li' ('Yi' is pronounced with the sound of a long 'e' as in 'seek') in the Chinese language?", "correct": "Italy", "options": ["Indonesia", "India", "Eritrea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItaly.\n\n\t'Yi-da-li' is the home of that 'other' pasta, the kind that comes covered with tomato sauce, according to the Chinese.  Incidentally, the Italians were among the first Westerners to visit and write extensively about China, with individuals like Carpini, Marco Polo and Matteo Ricci among the most famous! \n"}, {"text": "Enough with the transliterations for now.  Let's get back to some place names with meaning.  Which Chinese city has a name that means 'above the water'?", "correct": "Shanghai", "options": ["Wuhan", "Canton", "Xi'an"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShanghai.\n\n\t'Shang' means 'above, higher, upper, etc.' in Mandarin Chinese, while 'hai' means 'sea'.  This name makes some sense if we consider that Shanghai is built so close to the East China Sea, just above the water.  Shanghai was a relative backwater before the 20th century, but its phenomenal growth has made it the largest in the country and still growing. \n"}, {"text": "During the 19th century, many Chinese, especially from the south, migrated to other lands looking for work and opportunity.  They made their way to various cities and countries around the world.  One city gained the nickname 'Jiu-jin-shan' during that century, a name that translates as 'Old gold mountain'.  Which of these cities became the 'Old gold mountain' of Chinese migrants in the 1800s?", "correct": "San Francisco", "options": ["Singapore", "Sidney", "Capetown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Francisco.\n\n\tSan Francisco was called the 'old gold mountain' because of the great gold rush of the mid 1800s which attracted prospectors from around the world, including many from China.  In the late 20th century the Chinese began calling San Francisco 'San-fan-zhi', a transliterated name, because the 'Old gold mountain' seemed like a ridiculous and archaic term to them.  These days, it appears that the name 'San-fan-zhi' is prevailing. \n"}, {"text": "Another American city has a unique, non-transliterated name.  The name of this city is translated directly according to the meaning of each word.  Which American city is called 'Yan-hu-cheng' by the Chinese?", "correct": "Salt Lake City", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalt Lake City.\n\n\tYes, a city close to my own heart.  The Chinese word for salt is 'yan', the word for lake is 'hu' and city is 'cheng' (though this usually refers to 'town', while the word 'shi' normally translates better as city.)  Forgive me for the self-indulgence, I once called Salt Lake home! \n"}, {"text": "Let's play a fun game here.  Which of the following countries is not properly matched up with its Chinese name?", "correct": "Japan : Nip-pon", "options": ["France: Fa-guo", "Australia : Ao-da-li-ya", "Vietnam : Yue-nan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan : Nip-pon.\n\n\tThought I might attempt to trick the Japanese experts out there.  'Nippon' is actually the Japanese name for Japan (or Nihon), while the Chinese call Japan 'Ri-ben', which means essentially 'rising sun' (or 'source of the sun').  This is the Chinese name for Japan, which is to the east of China and hence exists where the sun rises!  Australia is called 'Ao-da-li-ya' or 'Ao-zhou', if it's referred to as a continent. The name 'Vietnam' is derived from the Chinese name 'Yue-nan'...the Vietnamese people were initially called the 'Yue' and came from what is now south China a couple thousand years ago. 'Fa-guo' is another transliterated name, with 'guo' added for good measure. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: The Chinese name for the island/country of Taiwan is 'Taiwan'.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAbsolutely!  The Chinese government considers Taiwan a renegade province of the 'homeland', though Taiwan and the mainland have quite a mixed history.  Taiwan only came to be dominated by the Chinese beginning in the 17th century, when large scale migrations occurred due to the fall of the Ming Dynasty. In the modern era, Taiwan was always an outlying province at best before it was turned over to Japan after the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-5.  When Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 he established a separate government and administration there, a virtual Nationalist Chinese government in exile. Ever since that year, the two sides have butted heads over the status of the island. \n"}, {"text": "Traditionally, the Chinese have referred to which country as either 'Chao-xian' or 'Han-guo'?", "correct": "Korea", "options": ["Thailand", "Burma", "Philippines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKorea.\n\n\tThe Chinese name 'Chao-xian' is a transliteration from 'Chosun', the name of the first and last Korean dynasties.  The Koreans call themselves the 'Han' people, and the Chinese sometimes do too, thus the name 'Han-guo'. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these major cities is not properly matched up with its Chinese name?", "correct": "London : Lin-tin", "options": ["Paris : Ba-li", "Rome : Luo-ma", "Washington : Hua-sheng-dun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLondon : Lin-tin.\n\n\tSorry for the tricky one.  London is in fact called 'Lun-dun' by the Chinese, a pretty obvious transliteration.  The other examples: Luo-ma (Rome), Ba-li (Paris, think of the French pronunciation) and Hua-sheng-dun (Washington) are all pretty obvious transliterations as well.  No deeper meaning for any of these cities can be derived, so far as I know. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: According to the Chinese, the United States is a 'beautiful country'.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Chinese name for the United States is 'Mei-guo', which translates literally as 'beautiful country'.  Whether the Chinese all really believe America to be beautiful, or if they even have enough data to establish such a judgement, is questionable.  Regardless, the name has held and continues to do so.  Well...I hope you learned a thing or two from this quiz...and enjoyed it as well.
