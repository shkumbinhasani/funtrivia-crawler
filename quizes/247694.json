What amount is the result of this careful calculation?", "correct": "A nickel", "options": ["A sawbuck", "$1000", "A red cent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA nickel.\n\n\tHawkeye's calculation works out like this...all the work he has done divided by the time he has been in the army.  The result of this inexplicable calculation, a nickel an operation.  I think this is Hawkeye's comment on just exactly how extremely busy the doctors have been since coming to Korea. \n"}, {"text": "While Hawkeye thinks of the fees he should be charging the army, Frank's mind is on trash.  Specifically, Frank wants to start charging the locals for the refuse that they have been collecting from the 4077th.  Hawkeye agrees.  He believes that if the locals get free garbage from the 4077th, the next thing they will want is what U.S. state?", "correct": "New Jersey", "options": ["Oklahoma", "Florida", "Hawaii"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Jersey.\n\n\t'Frank's right!' Hawkeye exclaims, 'Give these people a taste of our garbage and next they'll want New Jersey.'  Why New Jersey has such a bad name, I'll never know.  I was born there!  Frank insists that the locals pay for the refuse, including tin cans, egg shells, pus-filled bandage and germ-filled tongue depressors -- 'every rind, every drop of swill'. \n"}, {"text": "In the kitchen, Klinger has pulled KP duty.
