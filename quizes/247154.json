What nurse is the subject of Hot Lips' ire?", "correct": "Nurse Janet Baker", "options": ["Nurse Kellye Nakahara", "Nurse Kathy Able", "Nurse Ginger Bayliss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNurse Janet Baker.\n\n\tNurse Baker talks back to Frank after she hands him an instrument that he actually asks for (though he claims he did not).  Margaret's punishment for nurse Baker includes a charge of insubordination, with punishment being 'bed arrest' for one month. \n"}, {"text": "Henry is extremely agitated by Margaret's confrontational behavior, and does his best to shield himself from the onslaught.  When Margaret persists, he finally lodges his own protest.  He complains that if it's not Margaret criticizing her nurses, it's the nurses whining about Margaret.  Who do they compare Margaret to?", "correct": "Hermann Goering", "options": ["Genghis Khan", "Attila the Hun", "Napoleon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHermann Goering.\n\n\t'Hermann Goering in drag', to be specific.  Hermann Goering became the head of the German air force, the Luftwaffe, in the 1930s, and was Hitler's right-hand man.  Hence, this comparison is certainly not flattering for Hot Lips! \n"}, {"text": "Captain Spaulding, the guitar playing doctor of the 4077th during season three, makes yet another appearance in this episode.  What is Spaulding's first name, as spoken by Hawkeye?", "correct": "Calvin", "options": ["Michael", "Marvin", "Laurence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalvin.\n\n\tCaptain Calvin Spaulding is his full name.

While there, Radar suggests that Margaret looks a lot like which of his family members?", "correct": "Sister", "options": ["Mother", "Grandmother", "Aunt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSister.\n\n\tRadar claims that Margaret looks just like his sister, but a little older.  Margaret inquires as to his sister's age, and he claims 37 (which was actually Loretta Swit's age at the airing of this episode).  She is reasonably annoyed and tells him to get out.\r Incidentally, in other episodes, Radar claims to be an only child. \n"}, {"text": "Frank is the next to visit Margaret.  What bizarre gift does Frank give to Margaret, to remember him by?", "correct": "Hair trimmings", "options": ["Toenails", "Wisdom teeth", "A bottle of his blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHair trimmings.\n\n\tFrank has apparently saved his hair from six months worth of haircuts, and its all neatly tucked in an envelope for Margaret to enjoy.  He claims that he has been saving the hair for his mother who glues it into the shape of flowers under her glass table.  Yikes! \n"}, {"text": "The nurses have left the camp, and the male personnel are suffering from feminine deprivation.  Frank, one of the worst hit, talks with Margaret on the phone.  During this hilarious conversation, Frank emphasizes his jealousy.  He claims that if he finds out Margaret has been cheating with another man, he will blow his brains out, then kill both of them.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOne of my favorite moments in this episode.  After Margaret hears Frank's ridiculous plan, she corrects him.  Giggling, Frank agrees that he would kill the both of them, *then* himself.  'Seriously, Frank.  Knowing you'd kill me somehow makes my life worthwhile,' responds Hot Lips.  'Well, I wouldn't kill just anyone, Margaret,' Frank answers. \n"}, {"text": "With absolutely nothing to do, Hawkeye and Trapper locate a home movie that has been sent to Frank.  What event takes place in this cinematic masterpiece?", "correct": "Frank's wedding", "options": ["Frank's honeymoon", "Frank's vacation to Hawaii", "Frank's father's funeral"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank's wedding.\n\n\tFrank and his dour, sullen wife (played by Jeanne Schuller) are married, with various other unhappy-looking folk in attendance.  During the cake cutting scene, Frank's face gets stuck in some fly paper.  Later, his wife takes the driver's seat of the car, and after some brief protestations, Frank takes his place as the passenger.

'Give up Yankee imperialist dog', say the leaflets, which continue, 'Harry Truman is sleeping with your wives'.  So much for the threat!\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
