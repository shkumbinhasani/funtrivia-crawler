{"id": "406750", "name": "Detours of \"The Amazing Race 28\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 28"], "questions": [{"text": "Teams' first task in this season was a Detour held in which city?", "correct": "Mexico City", "options": ["Panama City", "Ottawa", "Havana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMexico City.\n\n\tThe first leg of the race sent teams to Mexico City for a night and early morning of tasks in and around the nation's capital.  Arriving at the Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n, teams picked up a Detour task asking them to choose between 'Mariachi Madness' and 'Great Bulls of Fire'.  In the former task, completed quicker, teams had to search a group performance of three hundred mariachis for one of a handful not playing the same song a the others while in the latter, which required more time, teams had to create a torito atop a parking garage and load it with fireworks to get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "In Colombia in Leg 2, teams who didn't choose the 'Pop-Up' Detour task instead had to make dishes with which ingredient?", "correct": "Fish", "options": ["Beef", "Pork", "Chicken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFish.\n\n\tHeading to Cartagena, Colombia in Leg 2, teams ended off the leg with a beachside Detour where they opted to either construct a shelter or cook for a local party.  In 'Pop-Up', teams used rudimentary materials to create a shaded structure in the sand while in 'Parilla', teams made three fish dishes to be served at the same party.  There was a nearly-even distribution between the tasks with most front-runners taking 'Pop-Up' and most at the back of the pack choosing to cook.  Following this, all teams headed to the Pit Stop. \n"}, {"text": "In Cartagena, Colombia in Leg 3, teams played 'Tejo' for one of their Detour options.  How many targets did they need to hit?", "correct": "Three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree & 3.\n\n\tTeams immersed themselves in typical Cartagena activities in Leg 3, embarking on either 'Tickets' or 'Tejo' for their Detour.  In 'Tickets', three of the teams hopped aboard a Cartagena bus to take fares for local transit riders.  When they collected 20,000 pesos they could continue racing.  In 'Tejo', teams instead headed to a local restaurant to play a Colombian game of cornhole, tossing heavy discs at gunpowder-loaded targets.  If they hit three loaded targets and caused them to explode, they could receive their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "How many teams were able to complete the 'Work Bench' Detour task in Leg 4 (in Switzerland) at the same time?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Five", "One", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tIn Geneva, Switzerland, teams had the choice between 'Work Bench' and 'Bench Work'.  The former task involved creating an authentic Swiss Army Knife, and for that, teams headed to the Victorinox store to use instructions and machines to create their work.  Due to limited amounts of machines, only three teams could attempt this task at a time.  Fortunately, only Tyler and Korey, Zach and Rachel, and Scott and Blair attempted this task anyways.  All of the other teams determined how many people could sit on the long bench at Promenade de la Treille (it was between 190-197) for 'Bench Work'. \n"}, {"text": "Both the 'Dynamite' and 'Campsite' Detour options found in Leg 5 were completed in which of these unique locations?", "correct": "On a mountain", "options": ["On a beach", "Underwater", "In a cave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn a mountain.\n\n\tVisiting Chamonix, France in Leg 5, teams spent a day at high altitudes, encountering mountains throughout their trip around the city.  Locating their Detour clue high atop the Mount Blanc Massif, teams had the option to hike along a narrow mountain trail or to build a campsite safe on a snowy plateau.  Seven of the eight competing teams went with 'Dynamite', the former task, delivering sticks of explosives and baguettes to local mountaineers. Only Burnie and Ashley chose 'Campsite', attempting to take a risk to overcome other teams, but falling to the back of the pack as a result of the task's difficulty. \n"}, {"text": "What type of bread did teams bake while completing the 'Bread' Detour task in Armenia in Leg 6?", "correct": "Lavash", "options": ["Pita", "Naan", "Matzah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLavash.\n\n\tVisiting Yerevan, Armenia in Leg 6, teams could either create Armenian carpets or cook Armenian breads during their Detour task.  Only Brodie and Kurt and Burnie and Ashley went to a local restaurant to create fifteen lavash for the bakers there, rolling out the dough and then smacking it into the heat of an underground oven, then trading the correctly-made ones for their clue.  The other five teams went to a carpet weaving factory where they had to weave a row of two hundred threads on an in-progress carpet. \n"}, {"text": "How many teams finished the 'String' Detour task, creating candied nuts in Georgia in Leg 7?", "correct": "Four", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tAlthough six teams headed to the 'String' Detour spot in rural Georgia, only four teams followed through with their aim to complete it (Zach and Rachel, Burnie and Ashley, Brodie and Kurt, and Scott and Blair) while Dana and Matt and Tyler and Korey flipped over to 'Clean' and Sheri and Cole started with the 'Clean' task all along.  In 'String', teams needed to create churchkhela, a traditional treat made by stringing twenty hazelnuts and dipping them in a wine-based glaze.  Those completing 'Clean' instead cleaned out a giant clay wine fermentation unit to get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Both Detour options in Leg 8, when teams visited Dubai, involved which of these animals?", "correct": "Camels", "options": ["Dogs", "Elephants", "Fish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCamels.\n\n\tWhether or not they wanted to, teams headed to the deserts around Dubai, UAE in Leg 8 and had to handle camels in one of two ways.  For the 'Races' Detour, teams raced camels (with the teams on bikes) in an attempt to cross a finish line first while in the 'Oasis' Detour, teams could take a more leisurely pace by taking camels for a walk through the scorching desert.  In both cases, teams navigated their way through the challenges with their Travelocity Roaming Gnome in tow. \n"}, {"text": "Which team did not appear on the Double U-Turn board in Leg 10 (in Indonesia) either as a user or a recipient?", "correct": "Dana and Matt", "options": ["Tyler and Korey", "Brodie and Kurt", "Burnie and Ashley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDana and Matt.\n\n\tIn a purely tactical move to get out their strongest competition, Tyler and Korey and Burnie and Ashley managed to collaborate using the Double U-Turn.  Tyler and Korey, leading the leg, U-Turned Brodie and Kurt, forcing them to complete both sides of the Leg 10 Detour while Burnie and Ashley, coming in behind them, U-Turned Tyler and Korey, who they knew had already passed through.  This meant that only Brodie and Kurt were stuck doing the extra task.  It was enough to get them eliminated from the race. \n"}, {"text": "In the final Detour of the race, a choice between 'Commuter Cycle' and 'Master of Arts', all four teams completed the same task.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tVisiting Shenzhen, China in Leg 11, teams could either learn how to ride self-balancing unicycles or spend time in Shenzhen's art galleries.  In 'Commuter Cycle', teams had to learn how to ride a unique form of transportation and complete a course, balancing while holding onto a briefcase and coffee cup. In 'Master of Arts', teams instead visited the Dafen Oil Painting Village to hang paintings in a local gallery.  Sheri and Cole were the only team to complete the former task and while they finished it long after the other teams finished 'Master of Arts', traffic and taxi troubles allowed them to check into the Pit Stop in third place. \n"}]}
