First published in 1605, in which city was it based?", "correct": "Strasbourg", "options": ["Antwerp", "Oxford", "Frankfurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrasbourg.\n\n\tUsually known simply as the \"Relation\", the full title of the world's first newspaper was \"Relation aller F\u00fcrnemmen und Gedenckw\u00fcrdigen Historien\" (which translates to \"Collection of all Distinguished and Commemorable News\"). It was first published in German in 1605 in Strasbourg, which was then part of the Holy Roman Empire and is now in eastern France.\r The first paper published outside the Holy Roman Empire was based in Basel in Switzerland and began in 1610. By 1620 there were also newspapers based in Frankfurt, Berlin, Amsterdam and Antwerp. The first French-language newspaper, La Gazette, began in Paris in 1631. By 1661 there were newspapers in Swedish, Polish, Spanish and Italian, and the first English-language paper, the Oxford Gazette, opened in 1665. A year later, production moved east and it changed its name to the London Gazette, which is still published today. \n"}, {"text": "The oldest English-language daily newspaper still in existence today began life in 1737. Which paper is this?", "correct": "The Belfast News Letter", "options": ["The Times of London", "The Glasgow Herald", "The Edinburgh Scotsman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Belfast News Letter.\n\n\tStill published six days a week, the \"News Letter\" is one of Northern Ireland's principal newspapers along with the \"Irish News\" and the \"Belfast Telegraph\". It is still legally called the \"Belfast News Letter\" although the city name no longer appears on the masthead.\rThe alternatives are all current newspapers that began not long after American independence. The \"Herald\", Glasgow's main newspaper, was first published in 1783. The \"Times\" began two years later, in 1785, and the \"Scotsman\" dates back to 1817. \n"}, {"text": "Visitors to France have a wide choice of daily newspapers. Although some regional papers have larger circulations, what is the most-read national daily in France?", "correct": "Aujourd'hui en France", "options": ["Le Figaro", "Le Monde", "Lib\u00e9ration"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAujourd'hui en France.\n\n\tThe national edition of \"Le Parisien\", \"Aujourd'hui en France\" (\"Today in France\") has the largest circulation of any of the country's national daily papers. \rOf the alternatives, \"Le Figaro\" is the second largest and is also the oldest still-existing newspaper in the country, having first appeared in Paris in 1826. \"Le Monde\" (\"The World\"), first published in December 1944, is the third-ranking French national daily. \"Lib\u00e9ration\" began in 1973 as an extreme left-wing paper but is now more mainstream. \n"}, {"text": "First published in 1821, the \"Guardian\" is still one of the UK's best-known daily newspapers. Until 1959, its title included the name of which English city?

National circulation for the \"Guardian\" reached an all-time high at around 494,000 in 1987 but by 2013 this had dropped to just over 200,000. (This was less than 10% of England's most-read daily, the \"Sun\" which was still selling around 2.4 million copies daily, down from a 1987 high of 3.99 million.) As of June 2012, though, the \"Guardian\" online edition was the third most widely read in the world. \n"}, {"text": "Founded in 1893, \"Lidov\u00e9 Noviny\" (\"People's News\" or \"The People's Newspaper\") is the oldest national news daily in which European country?", "correct": "Czech Republic", "options": ["Hungary", "Poland", "Finland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCzech Republic.\n\n\tFounded in 1893 in Brno, the largest Moravian city and the second largest in the Czech Republic, \"Lidov\u00e9 Noviny\" is a centre right/conservative daily with a circulation of around 73,000.

With which newspaper do most residents of Cleveland, Ohio start their day?", "correct": "The Plain Dealer", "options": ["The Courant", "The Deseret News", "The Post-Dispatch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Plain Dealer.\n\n\tEstablished in 1842, \"The Plain Dealer\" has a readership of around 750,000 on weekdays and one million on Sundays, so it is estimated that more than 75% of the adult residents of the Greater Cleveland region read the Sunday edition, which is the highest readership percentage anywhere in the Americas. During the week, that figure drops to 63.26%, leaving it second behind only the \"New York Times\".\rOf the alternatives, \"The Courant\" is the regional newspaper in Hartford CT. Founded in 1764, it is one of the oldest surviving dailies in the U.S. Founded in 1850, \"The Deseret News\" is the regional daily in Salt Lake City UT, whilst readers in St Louis MO have woken up to \"The Post-Dispatch\" since 1878. \n"}, {"text": "Still its country's most widely-read daily papers (and also the oldest), early risers in which African city have a choice of \"Al-Ahram\" or \"Al-Waqa'i'a al-Masriya\" with their cornflakes?", "correct": "Cairo", "options": ["Casablanca", "Cape Town", "Khartoum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCairo.\n\n\tFirst published in 1828, \"Al-Waqa'i'a al-Masriya\" (\"Egyptian Affairs\" or \"Egyptian Events\" is the Middle East's first indigenous newspaper. Originally published in both Ottoman Turkish and Arabic, you'll need to be able to read Arabic to understand it these days. With a circulation of one million daily (and 1.2 million on Fridays), \"Al-Ahram\" (\"The Pyramids\") is the most widely-read Egyptian newspaper. Published in Arabic at home, \"Al-Ahram\" is also aimed at the international audience so it produces editions in both English and French too. \n"}, {"text": "The \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" has the largest circulation of any newspaper in the world.

Today"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal.\n\n\tWith a worldwide circulation approaching 2.4 million, the \"Wall Street Journal\" is comfortably the best-selling daily newspaper in the U.S. This compares with a daily circulation of 2.2 million for the London-based \"Financial Times\", which targets a similar market. \rOf the alternatives, \"USA Today\" is also available worldwide. It has a circulation of around 1.67 million daily. Perhaps surprisingly, \"The New York Times\" sells even more than that - around 1.87 million, and 2.3 million on Sundays. (Neither the \"Wall Street Journal\" nor \"USA Today\" publish a Sunday edition.) Of the regional newspapers, the \"Washington Post\" is the fifth-largest in the country, with a circulation of 475,000.
