{"id": "330364", "name": "\"Theatricality\" Online Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Who is in trouble and called into Principal Figgins' office as the episode begins?", "correct": "Tina", "options": ["Puck", "Finn", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTina.\n\n\tSurprisingly it is Tina, one of the relatively quiet, introverted students in Will's Glee Club, who finds herself on the other side of Figgins' desk. It turns out that she's in trouble for her clothing style (which he states is known as 'Goth').  Since the school is being hit by \"Twilight-fever\", Figgins is setting out to ensure that students don't become vampires obsessed with the occult. Just the previous day, Jacob Ben Israel was attacked by supposedly-vampiric students.  Will and Tina deduce that Figgins believes in vampires and they try to dissuade his choice, but his mind is made up.  A strict dress code creates a stable environment with less vampirism. There is no choice; Tina must find new clothes or risk suspension. \n"}, {"text": "Which 'new look' is not suggested for Tina in Glee Club?", "correct": "Rock 'n' Roller", "options": ["Cross-country Skier", "Biker chick", "Cowgirl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRock 'n' Roller.\n\n\tFinn isn't doing too well either.  He arrives in the basement of Kurt's house to discover that Burt asked he and his mom to move in.  The plan is for Kurt and Finn to share the basement until they can add a new room to the house.  Finn is kind of shocked by this development and Kurt tries to reassure him that it'll be fine- they'll redecorate.  Burt offers some money to smooth things over for Finn, but Kurt takes it to spend at IKEA.\rTina shows up at school the next day in a sweatshirt and jeans and everyone tries to make her feel better with suggestions as to how she might want to look.  None seem to work though.  This issue is put on hold when Rachel storms in.  It turns out, Vocal Adrenaline bought several bulbs and yards of lace for their most recent venture.  Kurt and Mercedes immediately catch on: they're doing Lady Gaga.  Will decides that New Directions will find a number for Regionals and get Tina a new look. \n"}, {"text": "Rachel discovers that Shelby Corcoran, the coach for Vocal Adrenaline, is her mother.  Who is with her when this happens?", "correct": "Mercedes and Quinn", "options": ["Finn", "Brittany and Santana", "Kurt and Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes and Quinn.\n\n\tMercedes, Quinn, and Rachel decide to pay a visit to Carmel High to spy (against the rules) on Vocal Adrenaline's Lady Gaga number (in which their members dance in red lace costumes a la \"Bad Romance\").  Shelby stops them in the middle of their choreography to lecture them on theatricality before sending them offstage. She decides to elaborate her point by singing Barbra Streisand's \"Funny Girl\", a song Rachel claims is perfect.  It is during this performance that she realizes Shelby is her mother, having heard her voice on a tape in the previous episode (\"Dream On\").  After the song, she heads to the stage to confront her and the two decide to speak to each other. \n"}, {"text": "Kurt is the only male Glee Club member to perform \"Bad Romance\" with the girls.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tRachel and Shelby have a strained talk, both concerned with what to say.  Shelby explains that she has regretted not being there for her and that she saw her perform excellently at Sectionals.  Rachel explains that she feels thirsty.  Her dads would always bring her a glass of water when she was sad and it got to a point where she couldn't tell the difference.  Shelby decides to leave because it doesn't feel right for the two of them to meet.\rFinn confronts Mr. Schuester; the boys don't want to do Lady Gaga for their Glee assignment.  He feels that they always do what the girls want to do, so Will lets the guys change their approach to theatricality.\rPuck tries to convince Quinn that they should name their kid Jack or Jackie Daniels, but Quinn tells him to stop- she's getting rid of the child to avoid doing this with him.  Further down the hall, Kurt and Tina arrive in their Gaga-inspired outfits only to be harassed by the school bullies.  When they arrive in the choir room, they prepare themselves for a rendition of Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" complete with their own homemade uniforms while the guys watch from the sidelines. \n"}, {"text": "The boys, deciding to choose a different artist than Lady Gaga for their theatricality performance, decide to choose what band?", "correct": "KISS", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKISS.\n\n\tFinn runs into the bullies in the school washrooms while he's putting on make-up for his performance and both accuse him of being homosexual based on his moving in with Kurt.  There's no way for him to do both football and Glee Club in their opinion.  Rachel, meanwhile, heads to Carmel High School to ask her mother for help.  Her first Gaga costume, consisting of stuffed animals stapled to her dress (a la Gaga's Kermit the Frog outfit) didn't really work out too well since her dads can't sew.  Shelby sets her up with a more fitting Gaga look.\rWhen Rachel returns to McKinley, the boys are all set for their performance: KISS' \"Shout it Out Loud\" in which all of the guys (minus Kurt) hit the stage in full make-up and metal clothes. \n"}, {"text": "In what theme does Kurt decorate the basement room?", "correct": "Moroccan", "options": ["Western", "Japanese", "Hollywood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoroccan.\n\n\tKurt decides to have a talk with Finn since the bullies are back to harassing him about his outfit.  Finn says that there's not much he can do about it since they're harassing him too.  He doesn't want to make a spectacle of things and he suggests that Kurt try harder at blending in.\rWill speaks with Shelby because he's worried about Rachel.  She's an emotional girl who is hoping for an emotional commitment in her relationship with her mother.  Shelby, however, is worried about this.  She can't have kids anymore, but she's apprehensive about having a teenage daughter.  Shelby wanted her baby back, but Rachel is old enough not to need her mother.  Will recommends that she say this to Rachel.\rFinn returns home to find Kurt's idea of a peace offering, a decorated room for the both of them.  It turns out his idea was Moroccan-themed, something that frustrates Finn very much.  They start to argue. \n"}, {"text": "After Kurt and Finn fight and Burt overhears their argument, what happens?", "correct": "Finn is asked to move out", "options": ["Finn's mother sides with Kurt and asks Finn to apologize", "Kurt reveals his true feelings for Finn", "Burt decides to split the boys up and move Finn to a new room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn is asked to move out.\n\n\tWhen Finn explains that he doesn't feel comfortable with the choices Kurt has made or even with being around him, the two of them begin to argue that Kurt still has feelings for Finn even though he's not gay.  Eventually, Burt hears the two of them arguing and comes downstairs to hear Finn describing the furniture as 'faggy'.  This is the only straw for Burt who claims that he thought Finn was better than the other kids who make fun of people who are different. He decides, right there and then, that he and his mom can no longer live with them, even though he still loves her.  Neither has a chance to explain the situation to Burt before Finn is told to leave. Burt compliments his son on the look of the room before heading upstairs.  At school the next day, Kurt doesn't let Finn explain though Finn tries to tell him that he is different, even though Kurt thinks he isn't. \n"}, {"text": "What does Puck propose as the name for his and Quinn's child?", "correct": "Beth", "options": ["Janie", "Rosie", "Lucy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeth.\n\n\tPuck comes into the choir room and asks Will for the floor.  He reveals that he never cared about the theatricality assignment until he thought over what he learned about KISS.  It turns out that while Jackie Daniels is, as he says, a great name for a powerboat, it's not good enough for the baby.  He asks the guys to join him in singing the song \"Beth\" (by KISS) for the others and he suggests to Quinn that if the baby is a girl, they should use that name.  Holding back tears, she agrees.\rMeanwhile, Rachel and Shelby decide to have an important talk about their relationship in the auditorium. \n"}, {"text": "What Lady Gaga song do Rachel and Shelby sing as a duet?", "correct": "Poker Face", "options": ["Speechless", "Dance in the Dark", "Paparazzi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoker Face.\n\n\tRachel realizes why her mother has come to speak to her; she needs to say goodbye.  While Shelby wanted their relationship to work out, she realized that the two of them would never have those childhood memories with one another.  It's too late for them to have that type of relationship.  While Rachel wants a mom, Shelby only feels like a mother. They decide to be grateful for one another from afar until they can find a comfortable range.  Shelby also says that she's not going any easier on her at Regionals.  Before Shelby leaves, Rachel asks to sing with her, a dream she's always had.  The two decide to perform a duet of \"Poker Face\" in a playful, intimate style of their own. Shelby departs soon after as Rachel cries to herself. \n"}, {"text": "As a gift, what does Shelby give to Rachel toward the end of the episode?", "correct": "A drinking glass", "options": ["A microphone", "Earrings", "Her phone number"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA drinking glass.\n\n\tAs a parting gift, Shelby gives Rachel a drinking glass in case she feels sad and needs a drink.  The glass has a gold star on it (which Shelby claims is 'her thing'), something that she isn't aware is one of Rachel's favourite symbols.\rAs the kids come to Glee Club in their outfits to find out the point behind their theatricality lessons, Will admits that he's not quite sure what they needed to learn.  On the bright side, Tina is able to wear her regular clothes again.  It turns out that dressing like a vampire and scaring/threatening Principal Figgins with vampiric concepts was enough to let her go on wearing what she feels comfortable in.  It turns out that being a little theatrical has its benefits.\rWhen the kids realize that Kurt and Finn are missing, they find Finn in the hall wearing a Lady Gaga costume and stopping the bullies from harassing Kurt.  The others back them up and Will realizes that they may have inadvertently stumbled upon a lesson.  They all decide that it's okay to be different and that it's time to go back to work to finish getting ready for Regionals! \n"}]}
