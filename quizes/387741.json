{"id": "387741", "name": "\"RuPaul's Drag Race\" - Season 4 Online Trivia | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "RuPaul's Drag Race"], "questions": [{"text": "How many drag queens competed in this season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\"?", "correct": "Thirteen & 13", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThirteen & 13.\n\n\tKeeping with the same total as the third season of the show (as opposed to the lower totals in the first two), RuPaul brought a baker's dozen of new queens and threatened the return of Shangela (before promptly tossing her out to the dumpster, thankfully).  After the first impressions were put across in the work room, the thirteen had to go head-to-head in challenges revolving around the RuPocalypse, forcing them to face their zombified drag predecessors and create couture looks.  After a first lip-sync in front of Elvira, Mistress of the Night, Alisa Summer was told to sashay away. \n"}, {"text": "The contestants paired up for a task involving which of these sporting events?", "correct": "Wrestling", "options": ["Tennis", "Golf", "Rugby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWrestling.\n\n\tBecause there were twelve queens left in the second week of the competition, there was no better opportunity to pair them off for some drag-in-the-ring realness.  Beginning by making badonkadonk butts, the paired-off queens were told to learn fight choreography in a wrestling ring and perform the physical entertainment to the best of their abilities while, of course, looking fabulous and glam.  Lashauwn Beyond ended up getting sent home after a poor lip-synch against The Princess. \n"}, {"text": "In the third week of the competition, teams of queens took turns promoting two of RuPaul's albums-- 'Champion' and which other release?", "correct": "'Glamazon'", "options": ["'Real Me'", "'Red Hot'", "'American'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Glamazon'.\n\n\tBoth 'Glamazon' and 'Champion' were releases made during production of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", so it was only fitting that the girls work as teams to create infomercials promoting their memories of the classics on their respective discs.  Phi Phi O'Hara and Kenya Michaels won a mini-challenge by creating a butterfly-styled hat together, so they chose teams, inevitably leading Sharon Needles to a victory on the runway. The Princess, unfortunately, failed to impress the judges, including singer-songwriter Natalie Cole, during a lip-synch of Cole's own \"This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)\", and was sent sashaying away. \n"}, {"text": "The queens were asked to create an episode of the faux sitcom 'Hot in Tuckahoe'; both were set in which location?", "correct": "Prison", "options": ["Law firm", "School", "Movie studio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrison.\n\n\tIn the fourth week of the competition, the girls posed for mugshot photos before they were told they would have to play outlaws (or cops) in their own sitcom pilots for a new TV show called \"Hot in Tuckahoe\", which featured them splitting into teams of two to enact a far-fetched, drag-related crime in front of the camera (and for guest judges actress Nicole Sullivan and director Max Mutchnick.  Latrice blew away the judges with her comedic timing, leading to a win, and Madame LaQueer went home for her muted lip-synch performance to Pink's \"Trouble\". \n"}, {"text": "Week 5 of the competition saw the return of what recurring challenge involving impersonations and a game show setup?", "correct": "Snatch Game & The Snatch Game", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnatch Game & The Snatch Game.\n\n\tBringing back a standard for \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", the girls were told to bring their very best celebrity impersonations to the table and play a round of Snatch Game with special guests Ross Matthews and Loretta Devine.  Ultimately, the game brought out the best in some of the contestants though others were irked by the shenanigans of the younger competitors, namely Jiggly Caliente, Kenya Michaels, and Phi Phi O'Hara, who either missed the mark or took things too far. Ultimately, Kenya Michaels failed to wow the judges with her medicated Beyonce impersonation and her lack of pop culture knowledge showed more during a lip-sync to Madonna's \"Vogue\", so she departed. \n"}, {"text": "To celebrate gay pride, the queens were told to decorate floats for a parade, all of which were shaped like which of these?", "correct": "Boats", "options": ["Male symbols", "Drag queens", "Planets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoats.\n\n\tWith eight queens left in the race, Ru asked each of them to build a pride float, taking one of the eight colours of the gay pride flag and building around that with provided materials.  They also needed to make an accompanying drag look.  Willam, who won the wet t-shirt mini-challenge and got to choose everyone's respective colours, took the win this week by creating a boat that was plastered with stickers of himself, but still making the runway performance more about her.  Milan went packing for the exact opposite reason; the boat seemed to be more about Milan than pride. \n"}, {"text": "Which queen was disqualified from the season for breaking the rules?", "correct": "Willam", "options": ["Jiggly Caliente", "DiDa Ritz", "Milan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWillam.\n\n\tThis shocking event occurred in week 8, a week after Willam was sent to the bottom two for a lip-synch against Jiggly Caliente.  Although it was never stated until the reunion show, Willam was removed from the competition for having visits with people from outside the competition during the filming of the show-- a rule clearly stated in the queens' contracts.  As such, Willam was removed from the show at the runway, but not before she threw up after winning the frenemies challenge with Latrice Royale and watching a tense lip-synch battle between rivals Phi Phi O'Hara and Sharon Needles. \n"}, {"text": "Which queen was brought back into the competition and then promptly told to sashay away in the same episode?", "correct": "Kenya Michaels", "options": ["DiDa Ritz", "Alisa Summers", "Jiggly Caliente"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKenya Michaels.\n\n\tWhen the final five shrunk down to the final four, Ru informed the girls that Michelle and Santino were asked to bring back another of their competitors just in case she got something wrong during a prior elimination.  As such, they elected to return Puerto Rican Kenya Michaels to the show, having her face off once more, though in a challenge involving dressing up masculine fathers in drag for a 'drag mother-daughter' pregnancy-themed runway show involving looks and a striptease. Phi Phi, who informed Kenya's decisions when handing out the fathers, won the competition; Kenya, unfortunately, was asked to sashay away a second time. \n"}, {"text": "Which queen, who placed fourth overall, won the Miss Congeniality award?", "correct": "Latrice Royale", "options": ["Kenya Michaels", "DiDa Ritz", "Willam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLatrice Royale.\n\n\tLatrice was eliminated in the penultimate challenge of the competition, during which the queens not only needed to walk the runway with a dog (chosen by mini-challenge winner Chad Michaels), but create three different looks complimented by their various scenarios (Daytime Dog Park, Pooch in a Purse and Canine Couture) for their runway show. Latrice ended up in the bottom for the third time in a row, though this time with bottom-two first-timer Chad Michaels, and was sent home for a subpar country song lip-synch in front of Wynonna Judd.  Latrice, regarded by many as one of the kindest queens on the show, took Miss Congeniality at the reunion special. \n"}, {"text": "Which queen became the winner of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" season 4?", "correct": "Sharon Needles", "options": ["Chad Michaels", "Phi Phi O'Hara", "Alisa Summers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSharon Needles.\n\n\tAfter a final episode (involving a music video and three-person lip-synch to Ru's song \"Glamazon\"), the final three contestants were only told their fates at the live reunion show at which point Ru gave third place to Phi Phi O'Hara, second to Chad Michaels, and first place to Sharon Needles, regarded by many to be the most shocking of all the contestants this season.  Needles walked away with the title of 'Drag Superstar', a lifetime supply of Nyx Cosmetics, a trip courtesy of Al and Chuck's, the headlining position on a tour sponsored by Absolut Vodka, and $100,000. \n"}]}
