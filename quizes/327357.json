{"id": "327357", "name": "\"Ballad\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Will informs the kids that they will pair up to perform ballads with one another.  Who is not present for this?", "correct": "Matt", "options": ["Puck", "Santana", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt.\n\n\tBallads are the theme of this week's Glee Club assignment.  When Will asks the kids to define a ballad, Brittany comments that it's a type of duck.  Will corrects the kids' assessments of what a ballad really is and informs them that it's a story set to words used to evoke an emotion.  Their assignment: to pair up with someone and sing about how they feel about that person. All of their names are placed into a hat (which Brittany assumes contains the duck) and they draw them to pair up.  According to Santana, Matt had to go to the hospital because they found a spider in his ear.  Will puts his own name in as a replacement. Puck gets Mercedes, Artie gets Quinn, Finn gets Kurt (to Kurt's joy), Tina gets Mike, Santana gets Brittany, and Rachel is stuck with Mr. Schuester.  Will is worried about this arrangement and when Artie asks to explain the types of songs they should sing, Rachel starts up a duet of \"Endless Love\" to sing.  Rachel notices Will's beautiful eyes and Will notices her crazy gazes.  It freaks him out. \n"}, {"text": "What does Rachel give to Will as a gift?", "correct": "A tie", "options": ["An autograph", "A mug", "A matching outfit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA tie.\n\n\tQuinn and her mother end up trying out Quinn's dress for the chastity ball and find that although they purchased it a month earlier, it no longer fits.  Quinn blames it on a big lunch and her mother says that they'll just go to the tailor's and let it out.  She is also concerned for her daughter's priorities, quitting the Cheerios and joining show choir.  Her father comes in to inform her that he's invited Finn over for dinner on Sunday.\rRachel, meanwhile, informs Mr. Schuester that Matt will not be back the entire week and that they'll both be rehearsing their ballads together.  She also gives him a tie embroidered with gold stars saying that he can wear it and think of the star that he's helping her become.  Will goes to Emma for help. \n"}, {"text": "What happened to Suzie Pepper, the worst crush that Will has dealt with?", "correct": "She took it badly and ended up in a coma as a result of her actions", "options": ["She took it surprisingly well", "She left the state never to return again", "She disappeared entirely- no one knows what happened to her"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe took it badly and ended up in a coma as a result of her actions.\n\n\tWill explains to Emma that these crushes always start with tacky novelty gifts before blowing up and Emma can't help but say that if any teacher in the school were crush-worthy, he'd be it.  Will tells her the story of Suzie Pepper, perhaps the worst crush he's ever faced.  Similar to Rachel, Suzie bought Will a tie (this time, of peppers to remember her by).  When Will faced the issue head-on, she took it horribly.  She decided to eat the world's hottest pepper (which she had shipped up from Mexico) and it burned holes in her esophagus.  The ambulance arrived in time, but she was in a medically-induced coma for three days.  Emma suggests that he use the lesson he told the kids: let her down gently through song.\rKurt tries to get Finn to sing to him, but Finn's not willing to sing to another guy.  Finn blames his problems on the baby.  He's worried he may never get a chance to tell her what she feels.  Kurt suggests he sing out to her, so he does; he sings The Pretenders' \"I'll Stand By You\". \n"}, {"text": "When Finn sings his song to Quinn's baby, who overhears him?", "correct": "His mother", "options": ["Quinn", "Will", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis mother.\n\n\tFinn continues to sing the song after school, even bringing a copy of the sonogram home to sing to it in his room.  His mother finds him doing this and Finn is forced to confess the truth.  When he tells Quinn the next day, she's frustrated and takes it out on him.  Kurt tries to help (by favouring himself and saying that she does it because she's a girl) but secretly, he has a crush on Finn.  Since he first laid eyes on him, Kurt feels that his feelings have grown to a point where he just has to wait for Quinn to cut off all ties so he can make his move and be there for a devastated Finn. \n"}, {"text": "Other than Rachel, who watches Will perform his mash-up in the choir room?", "correct": "Emma", "options": ["Quinn", "Puck", "Terri"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmma.\n\n\tWill, eager to get his point across to Rachel, decides to perform a ballad mash-up in order to evoke his message to her in song.  Bringing Emma along, he decides to sing \"Young Girl\" by Gary Puckett and the Union Gap and \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" by The Police, two songs that (when combined) give a clear message about what he wants to evoke to her.  When he finishes, both Emma and Rachel are more enamored with him than before.  When asked what the message is, Rachel responds that she's very young and it's hard for Will to stand close to her.  The plan fails.\rRachel heads home to make a medley of her own for Mr. Schuester.  As she leaves the choir room, someone watches her from the distance: Suzie Pepper. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Finn find an outfit to wear to the Fabrays' house for dinner?", "correct": "His basement", "options": ["Kurt's house", "McKinley's costume department", "Goodwill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis basement.\n\n\tFinn invites Kurt over to help him find an outfit to wear to dinner with Quinn and her parents and they both talk about their parents.  While Finn goes through his father's old things, Kurt talks about his deceased mother and the two of them connect in this regard.  Finn finds a blazer (that fits) amongst his father's belongings and tries it on.  Kurt suggests that he could use his voice and sing how he feels for the Fabrays to make himself feel better.\rWill returns home in the evening to find Rachel in his apartment.  Terri knows entirely, in fact it was her idea to let her stay and help clean.  She reasons that she's been dealing with these schoolgirl crushes for years and she can take advantage, so Rachel's cleaning their bathroom.  Will decides to take her home. \n"}, {"text": "Who tells Mercedes that Puck is actually the father of Quinn's baby?", "correct": "Puck", "options": ["Rachel", "Finn", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuck.\n\n\tOn the drive home, Rachel sits in the back seat as per Will's suggestion and suggests that since they have alone-time it's a golden opportunity to practice their ballad.  While Will says he has no music, Rachel pulls out a CD she made for the occasion and plays Jennifer Paige's \"Crush\" before Will turns off the radio.  The next day, Rachel is approached by Suzie Pepper in school and Rachel tells her off.\rIn the choir room, Mercedes gets off the phone with Tina to begin rehearsing with Puck.  She complains that she and the others are too distracted by Quinn, Finn, and 'Babygate' to figure out their own emotions and ballads and Puck is angry with this concern.  Mercedes says that everyone may sing them a ballad together to show that they have their backs and Puck reveals that they shouldn't because he's actually the father.

When Mr. Fabray proposes a toast, Finn's mind wanders off and he can't focus so he asks to excuse himself for the washroom.  Quinn tells her father (when Finn leaves) that he's just intimidated.  In the bathroom, Finn calls Kurt for support and he returns to the table with the kitchen radio.  Quinn pleads him to stop but he says he has to to it for both of them.  What does he do?  He sings Paul Anka's \"(You're) Having My Baby\".  Suffice to say, dinner ends there.\rMr. Fabray sits Quinn and Finn down in the living room before deciding that both Finn and Quinn need to leave the house.  Quinn says that Mrs. Fabray knew since they tried on the dress but didn't say anything.  Neither parent offers to help.  Finn's mom takes her in telling her to stay as long as she wants. \n"}, {"text": "Who convinces Rachel that she and Mr. Schuester won't be together?", "correct": "Suzie", "options": ["Mercedes", "Finn", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuzie.\n\n\tSuzie approaches Rachel in the school washrooms and tells her what she doesn't want to hear.  After years of intense psychotherapy and an esophagus transplant, she learned that Will is unobtainable for her and while she's mildly-attractive and grating, she has plenty of self-esteem issues that can't be fixed by this crush.\rThe next day, Rachel and Will confront the problem in the choir room.  Will begins by telling her she's been acting inappropriately, but Rachel already realized this.  He tells her that one day, she'll find someone who will love her despite the flaws she feels she has, but it can't be him because he's her teacher and won't be anything more.  The two of them ditch rehearsal for the day as Rachel's fine on her ballads. \n"}, {"text": "The kids end the episode by singing what song for Quinn and Finn?", "correct": "Lean On Me", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLean On Me.\n\n\tFinn and Kurt continue to work at their ballad in the auditorium before Kurt asks about what happened with dinner.  Finn explains the whole scenario; Quinn's dad gave her a half-hour to pack and leave, but it's all for the best as this way there's no secrets.  He urges Kurt to work at his ballad since he helped him so much and Kurt replies \"honestly, I love you\".  Finn says he doesn't know the song, but it sounds positive.  Before this can sink in, Mercedes interrupts and has them come to the choir room.\rWhen Finn arrives, Quinn is already there.  Will informs them that the rest of the Glee Club has a ballad for them.  For Quinn and Finn, they've chosen Bill Withers' song \"Lean On Me\" to express how they truly feel about them. \n"}]}
