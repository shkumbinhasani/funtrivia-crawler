", "correct": "Deer", "options": ["Dog", "Pig", "Beaver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeer.\n\n\tThe one who was driving was texting and telling his co-worker a story about how he dated a guy once for a week.

After the second beaver attack she ran from the lake back to the cabin and tried to use the landline, but it was shown that the beavers had clawed the outside of the cabin and cut the phone lines.\r Apparently the toxic waste that turned them to Zombeavers also gave them superior intelligence. \n"}, {"text": "One of the boys tossed Zoe's dog into the lake, sacrificing him to the deadly beavers. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIt was the only way he could think to get the three Zombeavers headed in the other direction from the raft.

(IE: How many people died?)", "correct": "10", "options": ["3", "102", "77"], "explanation": "\n\n\n10.\n\n\tI know, most of you probably didn't count, that's why the numbers are so far off it's easy to estimate.\r There were 10 humans, 2 dogs, a bear and the deer that was hit by the truck. Plus all the Zombeavers that were killed. \n"}, {"text": "What creature is seen eating one of the Zombeavers corpses at the end of the movie?", "correct": "Bee", "options": ["Deer", "Bear", "Human"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBee.\n\n\tThe bee was shown to eat part of the Zombeaver and then fly back to its colony.
