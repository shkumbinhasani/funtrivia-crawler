What is the actual name of the theme song?", "correct": "Heavy Action", "options": ["Breakin' Free", "Football on Mondays", "Under the Midnight Sky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeavy Action.\n\n\tBritish composer/pianist, Johnny Pearson, wrote the piece, \"Heavy Action\", for the British sports show, \"Superstars\", in 1970. The show, which was a competition pitting various athletes against each other in various sporting events (the athletes could not compete in their own events of expertise, however), was a huge hit in Europe before catching on in the U.S., in 1973. ABC bought the rights to use \"Heavy Action\" as the theme song for ABC's \"Monday Night Football\" telecasts, in 1971, and it continued to be a staple of the show throughout its run on ABC. \r In 1987, composer Edd Kalehoff, who specializes in music compositions for televsion, re-vamped the song. While Kalehoff's version remained true to Pearson's version, anyone can tell that there is a distinct difference between the two songs. \"Heavy Action\" is still used on ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" telecasts, but not with the same prominence that Pearson's version was used. The theme song has been replaced by Hank Williams, Jr.'s \"All My Rowdy Friends (Are You Ready For Some Football)\" for the show's introduction. For me, Johnny Pearson's version will always have a special place in my heart. \n"}]}
