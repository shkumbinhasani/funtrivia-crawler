{"id": "48294", "name": "How to Capitalize a Title Quiz | Quiz Creation Guidelines | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", " Quiz Creation Guidelines", "    Spelling & Punctuation"], "questions": [{"text": "According to the standard rules of capitalization, sometimes, the first letter of the first word in a title should be capitalized, and sometimes it shouldn't.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe first word in a title should ALWAYS be capitalized in the standard rules, even if it isn't a very important one. Think of 'The Simpsons' and 'A Day in the Life of ...' Some writers and artists break this rule for artistic effect, but such instances are very rare. \n"}, {"text": "To use title case correctly, the first letter of EVERY word in a title should be capitalized.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe first word in a title should always be capitalized, but among the other words only the major ones should be capitalized. Usually this means that 'a', 'an', 'the', and prepositions (like 'in' or 'as') and conjunctions (like 'and' or 'but') should not be capitalized. \n"}, {"text": "Only the first letter of the first word of a title should be capitalized in title case.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis rule is true in some European languages, but not in the rules used for most English publications. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these titles is capitalized correctly in title case?", "correct": "'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'", "options": ["'Ash wednesday'", "'The waste Land'", "'Old possum's Book Of Practical Cats'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'\n\n\t'The' is capitalized because it's the first word, and 'of' is not capitalized because it's a preposition that comes in the middle of the title. 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock' is a lovely poem by T.S. Eliot, by the way; J. Alfred Prufrock is the main character's name. \n"}, {"text": "Which Harry Potter title is capitalized correctly in title case?", "correct": "'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'", "options": ["'HARRY POTTER and the PRISONER of AZKABAN'", "'Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone'", "'Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.\n\n\t'And', 'the' and 'of' aren't capitalized because they're minor words - a conjunction, an article, and a preposition, respectively. Putting major words in ALL CAPS may add emphasis, but it's wrong as capitalization. \n"}, {"text": "I'm trying to use title case to write the title of a book by Judy Blume. Which one is correct?", "correct": "'Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret.'", "options": ["'Are you there, God? It's me Margaret.'", "'R U There, God? It's Me, Margaret.'", "'r u there god? it's me, margaret.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret.'\n\n\tEven though the usual rule is that only the first word of a sentence (plus any proper names) is capitalized, this is a title and all major words must be capitalized. Abbreviations like 'r' for 'are' and 'u' for 'you' are not accepted at Quizzyland, no matter how they're capitalized! \n"}, {"text": "The rules of title case can also apply to social titles - like the formal title for a duchess or a president.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tElizabeth II is (in 2001) the Queen of the United Kingdom, not the Queen Of The United Kingdom. George W. Bush is the President of the United States. Jesse Helms is the Senator from North Carolina, and Prince Andrew is the Duke of York. \n"}, {"text": "Which TV show title is capitalized correctly in title case?", "correct": "'Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place'", "options": ["'The family guy'", "'The pjs'", "'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place'.\n\n\tWhen there's an abbreviation that's a major part of the title - as in 'The PJs' - that abbreviation should be capitalized. For Regis Philbin's show, the word 'be' is a verb and should be capitalized, but 'to' and 'a' should not be: 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' \n"}, {"text": "By default, the standard capitalization rules also typically apply to the names of organizations like corporations and government agencies.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThus, it's the Bureau of Engraving and Citicorp of North America. The preposition - 'of' - is not capitalized.\r Some bands and corporations will break these rules in their own names for dramatic or artistic effect, just as poets bell hooks and e.e. cummings chose to forgo capitalization in their own names. Sometimes, an odd-looking capitalization tells the history of the name: for example, FedEx has two capital letters in one word because it's a contraction of Federal Express.\r The default rule is to capitalize such names in the standard way -- unless the organization has made a decision to capitalize their name differently. \n"}, {"text": "Finally, which of these song titles is capitalized INCORRECTLY in title case?", "correct": "'The Ballad Of John And Yoko'", "options": ["'Pride (In the Name of Love)'", "'One of Us'", "'Somewhere They Can't Find Me'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Ballad Of John And Yoko'.\n\n\tThat's right - it should be 'The Ballad of John and Yoko'. I hope this quiz has made capitalization a little clearer! \n"}]}
