The order in which they picked their partners was decided by which of these?", "correct": "How quickly they found luggage", "options": ["Random drawing", "Birthdates", "Their knowledge of foreign cities"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHow quickly they found luggage.\n\n\tIn Grand Hope Park in Downtown Los Angeles, twenty-two individuals arrived at the starting line of a unique race around the world.  For the first time in \"Amazing Race\" history, there were not preset teams of two.  Instead, they would be pairing up with people then and there.  First, racers would have to take the streets two blocks southwest and then seven blocks southeast to find a luggage store. Then, they needed to bring back an item of luggage bearing the Panamanian flag.  They order they arrived in (with correct luggage), the earlier they could choose their partner.  When they'd paired up, they would be able to head to Panama with their new teammate and commence their race around the globe. \n"}, {"text": "Which team received the race's only Express Pass?", "correct": "Becca and Floyd", "options": ["Liz and Michael", "London and Logan", "Seth and Olive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecca and Floyd.\n\n\tAs soon as Phil gave the go, teams would be able to open the luggage they'd collected, rip open the clue, hop in a taxi, and head to LAX to catch the first flight to Panama City.  In addition, one of the twenty-two pieces of luggage collected would contain the race's only Express Pass, dished out via random draw per the first task.  Hopping into their cab, Becca and Floyd found it in the latter's case.  Additionally, because Jessie and Francesca were the remaining racers with no partner selected, they became a team by default.  For this inconvenience, Phil drove them to LAX himself. \n"}, {"text": "Heading to Panama City in the first leg, teams located a clue at which of these spots on the Panama Canal?", "correct": "Miraflores Locks", "options": ["Gatun Locks", "Pedro Miguel Locks", "Port of Balboa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiraflores Locks.\n\n\tOpening their first clue, teams were directed to Panama City, picking up one of two flights on Copa Airlines arriving the next morning.  Upon landing, they could pick up a rental car and navigate to the Miraflores Locks to find their first clue box.  Following this, teams could drive themselves to the Panama Rainforest Discovery Center in Gamboa's Soberan\u00eda National Park.  If they could find the Canopy Tower they could climb to the top and get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which Detour was completed by more teams in Panama (in Leg 1)?", "correct": "'Scoot'", "options": ["Both were completed equally", "'Shoot'", "Neither of these were options"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Scoot'.\n\n\tReaching the Canopy Tower, teams found their first Detour of the race, both tasks of which brought them to the Gamboa Rainforest Resort.  In 'Shoot', teams needed to use a bow and arrow to knock two fish off of pedestals in the water of the Chagres River while in 'Scoot', teams had to attempt to race against professional rowers on a river course.  Both Detour options had teams paddling cayucos, traditional canoes (a dugout in 'Shoot', but a modern version in 'Scoot').  Only Becca and Floyd managed to finish 'Shoot' while the remainder of the teams launched into 'Scoot'. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated from the race in Panama at the end of the first leg?", "correct": "Kevin and Jenn", "options": ["Liz and Michael", "Jessie and Francesca", "London and Logan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin and Jenn.\n\n\tFinishing their Detour in Gamboa, the teams were told to drive themselves to the race's first Pit Stop beneath the massive Panamanian flag on Cinta Costera Tres, the beltway running around Panama City.  The first team to make it to Phil and the mat was Seth and Olive who, interestingly, were the first pair-up at the starting line.  Kevin and Jenn, unable to navigate at every stage of the leg, were unable to finish either Detour task due to their late arrival.  They were forced to take a two hour penalty and, as such, they became the first team eliminated from the race. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 2, teams flew to what Brazilian city?", "correct": "S\u00e3o Paulo", "options": ["Fortaleza", "Rio de Janeiro", "Manaus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\tLeg 2 started late in the evening as teams ripped open their clues in Panama City and raced to the travel agency to book tickets and catch a flight to the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.  The ten teams racing in this leg managed to book passage on six different flights, all landing in Brazil in the middle of the night, before they hit the ground running and made their way to the Helipark T\u00e1xi A\u00e9reo e Manuten\u00e7\u00e3o Aeron\u00e1utica.  There, they could board a helicopter and fly over the city to Maksoud Plaza, disembark, and take a taxi to Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9. \n"}, {"text": "Which team finished the 'Keep the Beat' Detour option in Brazil in Leg 2?", "correct": "Shamir and Sara", "options": ["Matt and Redmond", "Brooke and Scott", "Tara and Joey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShamir and Sara.\n\n\tArriving in front of the S\u00e3o Paulo Cathedral in Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9, teams collected their Detour clue.  For 'Keep The Beat', teams needed to make their way to Santa Ifig\u00eania and join a samba troupe.  There, one member of the team would take a traditional drum known as a surdo while the other would take a percussive device known as a chocalho and both would need to properly perform the musical number with the group to get their next clue.  Shamir and Sara, Liz and Michael, London and Logan, Becca and Floyd, and Jessie and Francesca completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "In the 'Work Your Feet' Detour task (in Leg 2), teams had to do which of the following?", "correct": "Construct a workout station", "options": ["Measure a building", "Dance", "Serve food"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConstruct a workout station.\n\n\tIn 'Work Your Feet', teams went to the gym, building a workout station using rudimentary equipment in the Br\u00e1s neighbourhood.  Working with a refrigerator, a giant truck tire, tin cans, and spare auto parts, they had to make do and make their station to a professional boxer's specifications to get their next clue.  Matt and Redmond, Vanck and Ashton, Seth and Olive, Brooke and Scott, and Tara and Joey selected this task.  After completing the Detour, teams proceeded to Paulista Avenue to find a marked bicyclist wearing the race colours to get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "The Road Block in Leg 2 (in Brazil) asked teams to rappel down which of these?", "correct": "Building", "options": ["Cave", "Statue", "Cliff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuilding.\n\n\tReaching their Road Block clue on Paulista Avenue, teams had to choose the member who likes things 'squeaky clean'.  For this challenge, the person chosen had to travel to Instituto Cervantes S\u00e3o Paulo and rappel down the side to wash a marked window.  If they could finish the job, an attendant inside would hand them their next clue and they could keep racing.  Ashton, Liz, Redmond, Seth, Scott, Shamir, Becca, Tara, Logan, and Francesca completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated from the race at the end of Leg 2?", "correct": "Jessie and Francesca", "options": ["Shamir and Sara", "London and Logan", "Tara and Joey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJessie and Francesca.\n\n\tWrapping with the Road Block, teams had to visit the urban rainforest of Trianon Park to find Phil and the race's second Pit Stop.  Liz and Michael blasted through their tasks and took a quick cab to the Pit Stop to find Phil before everyone else, earning themselves a trip for two to Barbados courtesy of Travelocity, narrowly beating Vanck and Ashton.  Though several teams stumbled with tasks and navigation this leg (in some cases getting injured), Jessie and Francesca stayed behind all leg due to a late flight; they were the second team eliminated from the race. \n"}]}
