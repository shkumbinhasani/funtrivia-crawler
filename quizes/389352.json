Jean-Paul Gaultier was born on the 24th of April 1952 in the suburb of Arcueil to the south of Paris. For an artist with no formal professional training he has enjoyed a long and successful career as a designer; he presented his first collection in 1976 and rapidly became regarded as the bad boy of French fashion design through his use of unusual models which included old people, tattooed and pierced models and those with 'fuller' figures - and sometimes a combination of all of them!  Undeterred Gaultier continued to employ his own unique techniques which garnered him both the respect and criticism of his peers and a great degree of popularity with the public. Gaultier was also the designer responsible for the costumes, notably the golden cone bra and corset set, that caused outrage in some circles during 1990 at the start of Madonna's 'Blond Ambition' world tour.  In recent years Gaultier's designs have been influenced by nautical themes as can be seen in many of the television adverts promoting his fragrances.  In addition to 'The Fifth Element', he has designed the costumes for a number of films, most notably the Peter Greenaway film 'The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover' and 'The City of Lost Children' directed by Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet. \n"}, {"text": "On return to the temple with the sacred stones, Korben, Cornelius, David and Ruby are unable to activate them.  Which member of the team eventually stumbles across the method for doing so?", "correct": "David", "options": ["Ruby Rhod", "Vito Cornelius", "Korben Dallas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid.\n\n\t\"Wind blows, fire burns and rain falls\" whispers the badly injured Leeloo into Dallas' ear as she contemplates within herself whether or not humanity is worth saving.  After positioning the stones upon their plinths they fail to activate and the team believe that all is lost.  David, exasperated, leans forward toward the stone in front of him and sighs. To his astonishment the stone begins to open although he is initially unaware as to how this happened.  Once they realise that the passage of David's breath over the stone displaying the symbol for air activates it, they set about working on the others; the water stone, by dripping beads of sweat from a handkerchief upon it, the earth stone by placing a handful of sand upon it and the fire stone by placing a lighted match on its top. As soon as each stone is activated and Dallas convinces Leeloo that humanity is indeed worth saving, powerful beams of light project towards the figure of Leeloo in the centre of the chamber; this beam of divine light then bursts forth from her mouth and flies off into space where it finally destroys the evil sphere and saves all life on earth. \n"}]}
