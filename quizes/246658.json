However, during an episode in the first season, by what name did he refer to her?", "correct": "Mildred", "options": ["Laverne", "Bonnie", "Colleen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMildred.\n\n\tSome fans have speculated that Henry's wife's name includes both Lorraine and Mildred, perhaps Mildred Lorraine Blake, or vice-versa.  Regardless, after the first season, we never hear the name Mildred in reference to his wife again. \n"}, {"text": "In the episode 'Mail Call', Hawkeye mentions that he has a brother, while in later episodes he becomes an only child.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, it's a sister he mentions.  Not only does he apparently have a sister in that episode, she has also knit him a sweater, albeit a very poorly wrought one. \n"}, {"text": "In the first season episode 'Dear Dad', Hawkeye mentions that he and his father have a home in what state, never to be mentioned again in later episodes?", "correct": "Vermont", "options": ["Washington", "New York", "Michigan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVermont.\n\n\tOf course, Hawkeye also mentions in another episode that he and his father 'summer' in Maine, so it very well could be that they own two dwellings.  However, this is hard to believe considering that they are small town doctors.  In addition, Hawkeye only mentions Crabapple Cove, Maine as his home for the rest of the series. \n"}, {"text": "What 'M*A*S*H' character's father is claimed dead in an early episode, only to appear in person in a much later episode?", "correct": "Margaret", "options": ["Radar", "Frank", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret.\n\n\tIn the season three episode 'Bulletin Board', Margaret's 'dead' father is mentioned.

But in his first appearance in the season two episode 'Radar's Report', what was Sidney's first name?", "correct": "Milton", "options": ["Filbert", "Thomas", "Robert"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilton.\n\n\tAgain, fans have theorized that his full name is either Sidney Milton Freedman, or Milton Sidney Freedman, and he just happened to refer to himself as Milton in the first episode.  It might be that they changed his name to Sidney because there is a famous economist named Milton Friedman. \n"}, {"text": "Sidney Freedman was not the only minor character to go through a name adjustment.  What semi-regular character was originally introduced as Captain Halloran?", "correct": "Colonel Flagg", "options": ["Captain Sam Pak", "Sergeant Zale", "Sergeant Rizzo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColonel Flagg.\n\n\tIn the second season episode 'Deal Me Out', Edward Winter played Captain Halloran, from army intelligence.  The theory here is that 'Captain Halloran' was just another alias of Colonel Flagg, but alas, in that episode he does act a little differently than Flagg, less gung ho. \n"}, {"text": "What character on 'M*A*S*H' mentioned early on that he had his home in Nebraska?", "correct": "Colonel Potter", "options": ["Frank Burns", "Father Mulcahy", "Charles Emerson Winchester III"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColonel Potter.\n\n\tIn an episode in the fourth season, Colonel Potter mentions that his home is in Nebraska.
