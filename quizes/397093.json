His mission: to intercept a vehicle, kill its driver, and claim the packs of serum from inside its trunk.\rIn modern-day Lagos, Wanda Maximoff calls some info to Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Fisher who are in Nigeria to hunt down a target.  As a truck launches like a battering ram into the Institute for Infectious Diseases, they all move in against former S.H.I.E.L.D. double agent Brock Rumlow, who has since upped his game for Hydra and broken in to claim a bioweapon.  As his men split up to hide the bioweapon (which is inevitably reclaimed by Romanoff), Rumlow fights Cap alone, intending it as a kamikaze attack.  Though Rumlow is defeated in a hand-to-hand fight, he gets to Cap by insisting that Bucky Barnes was the one who sent him to Lagos having been re-brainwashed by Hydra, and he presses his personal detonator, setting off his suicidal explosion.  Wanda arrives at the last minute, using her powers to contain the blast and throw it upwards, but in doing so she destroys part of a nearby skyscraper, resulting in the casualties of several Wakandans. \n"}, {"text": "The Sokovia Accords state that The Avengers would be overseen by which of these?", "correct": "The United Nations", "options": ["S.H.I.E.L.D.", "The World Peace Organization", "The United States Government"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe United Nations.\n\n\tAt the MIT Alumni honors, Tony Stark exhibits his experimental, new technology which allows computers to regenerate memories and reshape them to help the brain cope with past traumas.  At his speech he awards all of the students full funding for their current research as part of the Stark Industries' new 'September Grant'.  As he leaves, a woman speaks to him alone in a university hallway, claiming that her son died in Sokovia.  She blames Tony for what happened.\rStark ends up bringing Thaddeus Ross, the Secretary of State, to the Avengers' lodgings to speak about some plans being put into place by the United Nations.  For the past four years, the Avengers have worked with relatively unlimited power and no restriction and it's caused countless casualties, even indirectly.  The governments of the world can no longer tolerate it, so they've drafted up the Sokovia Accords.  The Avengers can no longer be a private organization; they'll work under a UN panel if and when they're needed.\rIn Cleveland, Ohio, the documents from Hydra's Siberian lab are reclaimed from the wall of a basement by a man named Helmut Zemo,  When Black Widow released S.H.I.E.L.D.'s documents to the public, the mission report for Siberia 1991 wasn't amongst them.  Zemo leaves with the information he needs. \n"}, {"text": "Whose father is killed during the ratification of the Sokovia Accords?", "correct": "T'Challa", "options": ["Steve Rogers", "Hope Van Dyne", "Tony Stark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nT'Challa.\n\n\tThe Avengers discuss the Sokovia Accord and Vision puts forth the point that their very strength, as a group, may be a cause of the increasing catastrophes around the world.  Tony agrees with Vision; they're killing innocent people, even if they're fighting bad guys, so they need to be put in check.  Steve believes that the document simply shifts the blame; people on the United Nations panel will be pushing agendas and The Avengers will lose their right to choose.  The Avengers are split down the middle with this.  Romanoff, surprisingly, agrees with Stark, believing that if they have one hand on the wheel of the situation, they can still steer.\rSteve gets a message on his phone calling him away; Peggy died in her sleep in her nineties.  He flies to London for her funeral and finds motivation in her words, reassured that he needs to stand firm on his decision.  Though Romanoff flies on to Vienna to sign the Accords, Steve refuses.\rIn Vienna, one hundred and seventeen countries ratify the Sokovia Accords.  Romanoff meets T'Challa, the Prince of Wakanda, and apologizes not only for the casualties in Lagos, but for Rogers' non-attendance.  During the event, a bomb is blown up outside the conference room and it kills T'Challa's father, the King, and justifies the Accords all the more. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Steve and Sam locate Bucky after the bombing?", "correct": "Bucharest", "options": ["Bratislava", "Berlin", "Budapest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBucharest.\n\n\tAs the news comes in, the bomber of the United Nations building is identified as Bucky Barnes and the manhunt is renewed.  Romanoff speaks to T'Challa and offers her apologies, but T'Challa vows to hunt down Barnes himself, refusing to let the Accords his father wished to see come to pass have a say in his revenge.  Steve calls Romanoff soon after and while she tries to convince him otherwise, he decides to bring Sam with him to Bucharest (on Sharon Carter's intelligence) to bring Bucky in himself.\rIn Bucharest, it doesn't take long for Steve and Sam to locate Bucky's apartment and get into contact with him.  Though Steve tries to convince Bucky to leave before the police come in, their talk runs long and they have to work together, somewhat, to get away.  While Bucky sees no harm in killing his way through the building, Steve tries to clean things up behind him.  It allows T'Challa, the Black Panther, to swoop in from above and engage in combat as well, forcing a chase through the Bucharest city streets.  Ultimately, Steve prevents T'Challa from harming Bucky, but the three of them (and Sam) get cornered by the police and War Machine swoops in to defuse the situation. \n"}, {"text": "Helmut Zemo infiltrates Bucky's psychological evaluation, prompting his escape using which of these?", "correct": "EMP", "options": ["Cell phone app", "Nuclear missile", "Ultron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEMP.\n\n\tAt Avengers HQ, Vision tries to lift Wanda's spirits and the two of them discuss the mysteries of their lives, being unable to understand their powers.  Wanda offers to go to the store to pick up some ingredients for a meal, but Vision stops her, on Stark's request, suggesting that she lay low until the Accords are in place.  The truth is, he's hiding her to avoid deportation.\rIn Berlin, Cap and the others are brought in.  T'Challa confirms that his suit is made from the same material as Cap's shield.  He insists that he's still eager to kill Bucky.  Everett Ross is called in to take care of the fugitive Avengers and Stark and Romanoff are revealed to be present, doing damage control.  Rogers' shield is placed into the hands of the government.  When he talks to Stark alone, they both admit they can't back down from their causes; Cap feels that something bad is happening, but Tony feels that the Accords will help them all.\rHelmut Zemo shows up at the compound in disguise, appearing as a psychiatrist there to speak to Bucky.  As his EMP is delivered to a nearby hydro field, he speaks a trigger phrase controlling Bucky, resetting his internal programming and allowing him to break free of his cell.  Cap and Sam arrive on the scene first and try to fight, but both are knocked aside.  Although Tony, Natasha, T'Challa, and Sharon Carter try to slow Bucky down, it's Cap, regaining his ground, who manages to nab Bucky outside of the building, pulling his helicopter out of the air and down to the roof before plummeting into the adjacent river.  This time, it's Steve who pulls Bucky out of the water. \n"}, {"text": "Who of these is not recruited by Steve to oppose the Sokovia Accords?", "correct": "Bruce Banner", "options": ["Scott Lang", "Wanda Maximoff", "Clint Barton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBruce Banner.\n\n\tSteve and Sam bring Bucky to a near-abandoned warehouse and trap his arm in a powerful vice.  When Cap determines the version of Bucky he's talking to, they work out that Zemo was there to try and learn more about Siberia, where Bucky was made and kept, because there's more than one Winter Soldier.  In 1991, when Bucky took out a vehicle on a quiet country road, its trunk actually contained serums to create super-soldiers that were strong enough to take down Bucky in battle.  They all had more kills than anyone in Hydra history and the stealth to take down a whole country in one night.  Cap reasons that the Accords prevent them from getting help from any Avengers, but Sam claims to know a guy.\rAt Avengers HQ Clint Barton, fresh out of retirement, arrives to grab Wanda.  Vision tries to prevent them from leaving, but Wanda is able to overpower him.  The two later rendezvous with Cap and Sam, but only after Cap gets his suit and shield back from Sharon, at a multi-level parking lot, the reason being that they need to examine their final recruit-- Scott Lang-- who's come all the way from San Francisco on request. \n"}, {"text": "Stark recruits which teenage superhero to his team to oppose and capture Captain America?", "correct": "Peter Parker", "options": ["Carol Danvers", "Pietro Maximoff", "Stephen Strange"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter Parker.\n\n\tStark and Romanoff are given only thirty-six hours to locate Bucky, Steve, and Sam, so Tony heads to Queens, New York City, to catch a teenage Peter Parker getting home from school.  Claiming that Peter received the September Grant, Stark manages to get a few minutes alone with the boy, revealing that he's actually the young Spider-Man who's been saving lives and stopping crimes all throughout New York City as an amateur hero.  Stark believes he needs an upgrade...and a passport.\rNatasha doesn't need to leave the building to find back-up, instead speaking to T'Challa for her support.\rAll of them head to Leipzig/Halle Airport, Germany, where a helicopter plans to take Cap's team onward, and after evacuating the premises, they await battle. \n"}, {"text": "Where does the battle between Captain America (anti-Accords) team and Iron Man's (pro-Accords) team take place?", "correct": "Airport", "options": ["Mountaintop", "Above the sea", "New York City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAirport.\n\n\tCap and Stark, meeting on the runway of the airport, aren't able to come to an agreement, and as the Quinjet is located in one of the hangars, a battle ensues in which Captain America, Falcon, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, the Winter Soldier, and Ant-Man face off against Iron Man, Black Widow, War Machine, Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Vision.  There's nothing to do but fight, and nearly every super-being comes into contact with every other as the jet is nearly ignored.  The others reason that Cap and Bucky need to get to the Quinjet; the rest of them need to make a diversion.  So that's what they get when Lang reverses the abilities of his suit, becoming Giant-Man and standing in the way of the battle.  It allows Cap and Barnes to reach the hangar, albeit with a bit of help from Wanda.  When they arrive, only Black Widow stands in their way, and when she realizes that Steve won't stop, she helps him out by switching sides and helping him get to the plane.\rOutside, the others bring down Giant-Man, but Cap and Barnes escape.  As they do, Falcon pursues and tries to slow them down and it leads Rhodes to ask Vision for a bit of help.  Vision, distracted, fires a beam up to hit Falcon, but it misses, hitting Rhodes' suit instead, sending him plummeting to the ground with a damaged suit.  Both Sam and Tony fly down to help, but he crashes to the ground and the battle comes to an end. \n"}, {"text": "All heroes captured by Iron Man as fugitives are placed into a facility known by what name?", "correct": "The Raft", "options": ["The Kyln", "The Ring", "The Box"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Raft.\n\n\tRhodes is brought to a hospital and the diagnosis is poor; he'll live, but he'll likely be paralyzed.  Tony, angry with Natasha for the double-cross, warns her that T'Challa has informed the UN of her deception, so she departs.  It's only then Tony receives word that Hydra's Helmut Zemo was responsible for the attack in the UN building.  He sends it on to Ross, but heads to the Raft, an underwater prison, to speak to the fugitives that were taken in.  Stark knocks out the surveillance and reveals what he knows to Sam while he can and, luckily, he's able to get Siberia out of him.  He doesn't realize he's being followed by T'Challa though.\rWhen Steve and Barnes arrive in Siberia, they locate the super-soldier facility moments before Tony follows them in, asking for a truce.  As they navigate through the corridors, they find a single heat signature-- Zemo, who's already there putting an end to the super-soldiers in their containment chambers. \n"}, {"text": "In the end it's revealed that Bucky Barnes was responsible for whose death?", "correct": "Howard Stark", "options": ["Peggy Carter", "Ben Parker", "Pepper Potts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoward Stark.\n\n\tZemo, hiding in a protected chamber, says that they served their purpose, allowing him to get Cap and Barnes where he needed them, before he plays surveillance footage from the accident in 1991.  The footage, unseen by the others, proves that Barnes was the very person responsible for the deaths of Tony's Parents, who were transporting the serums on that fateful night.  An empire that crumbles from within, Zemo claims, crumbles forever.\rAfter Tony watches the footage, there's not much else on his mind except to fight and kill Bucky, so an immense battle through the facility ensues in which Cap tries to get Bucky out and reason with his Avenger compatriot.  It's a devastating fight that ends with Bucky's arm being destroyed by Stark's suit.\rOutside, T'Challa finds Zemo musing about what's happened and what he lost to bring him to the point he got to.  T'Challa, deciding not to let his own anger consume him, prevents Helmut from committing suicide to bring him in to the authorities.\rStark, realizing he can't win hand-to-hand, has his suit analyze the battle and nearly gets the upper hand, but Cap is able to use his shield to put an end to Tony's suit, destroying its energy core before picking up Bucky and leaving the shield, which Tony's father created, behind.\rStark inevitably returns to an empty Avengers HQ to help Rhodes rehabilitate.  With him still unable to walk, Stark's mechanical prosthetics could help.  Stark receives a letter in the mail from Cap explaining his actions but not apologizing for his actions.  He also sends a cell phone; if he needs him or the others, they'll be there.\rOn the Raft, there's a breach as Captain America arrives to free the prisoners. \n"}]}
