Salty died of a stroke, perhaps in the most unassuming way, and Elsa says it was for the best that he went when he did; most pinheads don't make it past forty.  Pepper, of course, is heartbroken because she loved Salty more than anyone. Elsa tells Stanley that she tried her best with Salty, but he never quite took to lessons in the same way as Pepper.  Stanley, on the other hand, tries to point out that she looks worse having suffered.  When Elsa tries to kick him out, he points out that the head of the network wants to see her in three weeks, so kicking him out would be bad for her. Elsa refuses to rest since Pepper needs her. \n"}, {"text": "What part of Salty's body is placed on display at the Museum of Morbidity?", "correct": "Head", "options": ["All of him", "Hands", "He's not placed in the museum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHead.\n\n\tStanley, in an effort to salvage what he can, tells Elsa that he'll end the suffering by getting rid of Salty's body.  Pepper, he says, would likely be happy to receive an urn of his ashes but Elsa insists that a burial would be more to her liking.  Unfortunately, it doesn't take much to convince Elsa that Stanley has everyone's best interests in mind.  That night, taking an axe, he lops off Salty's head and the Museum of Morbidity receives a new package.  Salty's head is placed in the same hall as Ma Petite's body. \n"}, {"text": "Who reads \"The Velveteen Rabbit\" to Pepper?", "correct": "Desiree", "options": ["Elsa", "Maggie", "Dell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDesiree.\n\n\tDesiree reads Pepper to sleep before Dell comes in and apologizes for the mistakes he's made in the past; he just wants another shot with her.  Unfortunately, Des knows she can't make him happy, so they shouldn't waste their time.  Before she can leave, Pepper insists that she stay and she throws a tantrum. Des, however, won't have any of it and tells her to clean her mess up.  When Des goes straight to Elsa's tent and shares a drink, she says that Elsa's inevitable departure will likely break the poor girl.  This, of course, gets Elsa thinking about what she can do to protect her dearest freak. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Elsa find Pepper originally?", "correct": "An orphanage", "options": ["On her doorstep", "On the street", "In a circus sideshow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn orphanage.\n\n\tElsa tells Desiree about her arrival in the United States.  Showing up in 1936, Elsa already had trouble with work in the circus but she got a job in Boston as a chorus girl, quickly risig to the top with her vocals.  She decided to have her own show eventually, using her business savvy to get her there in the end. The freaks, she decided, were the best way to go.  Her first freak ended up being Pepper; she found her in an orphanage and took to her almost immediately, adopting her as soon as possible and feeling unconditional love ever since.  The troupe grew, and Pepper always stayed by her side. \n"}, {"text": "Elsa traded which of the following to keep Ma Petite?", "correct": "Dr. Pepper", "options": ["Gold", "Chickens", "Pepper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Pepper\n\n\tThe troupe changed forever, Elsa says, when a group of Indians traveled to see the freak show and brought with them Ma Petite.  Elsa was immediately smitten but the Indians considered her a favourite pet and, unfortunately, untouchable and untradable.  After Elsa serves a drink of Dr. Pepper, however, they leave her behind for three cases of the stuff. That day, Pepper was the happiest she'd ever been; her need to be a mother was sated.  Elsa realized that this wouldn't be enough, though.  She needed a husband.  Six months later, she found Salty and it was love at first sight.  They had a wedding and all was well. Elsa, who put them all together, considered herself a fairy godmother.  Desiree recommends that they get in contact with Pepper's estranged sister as it may be her best option. \n"}, {"text": "Maggie admits to Elsa that she's not actually a fortuneteller.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMaggie, drinking in her tent and thinking about Jimmy, is approached by Desiree and her beau, Angus, about a crystal ball reading.  They ask what she sees in their future and, using her observational powers, she's able to make some clear assumptions about the couple.  When she sees the two of them happy, however, she tosses the game aside and starts to say that the relationship will go south.  They leave angrily, refusing to believe her nonsense.\rLater that night, Des approaches Maggie looking for the truth and the girl admits everything to her.  She and Richard (better known as Stanley) have been working together since 1941, grifting people.  She doesn't tell the truth about killing the freaks, but Des catches on quickly.  She warns Maggie that if she finds her responsible for the deaths of any freaks, she will retaliate. \n"}, {"text": "Who visits Jimmy in prison?", "correct": "Stanley", "options": ["Elsa", "Maggie", "Bette and Dot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStanley.\n\n\tMaggie returns to her tent to find Dot and Bette waiting for her.  Both, as it seems, want to help get Jimmy out of prison, so they're willing to use all of their money to hire a lawyer and help.  Bette, to Dot's disappointment, tells Maggie that she can go to Jimmy's rescue but she laughs at the idea.  Both sisters say that Maggie's a phony, but they give her the money anyways; she needs to do right by Jimmy.\rThe next day, Stanley ends up being the one to show up at the prison.  He gets Jimmy to admit he doesn't know if he committed the murders (considering the drinking) and he says that he's willing to get a lawyer for him.  The problem is, they need to get the money together to do so.  Stanley looks to Jimmy for options. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Pepper's sister, Rita, live?", "correct": "Massachusetts", "options": ["Virginia", "Florida", "California"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n\tWhile attempting to make dinner at the campsite, Des is met in the food tent by Maggie.

They need to travel.\rElsa ends up in Massachusetts with Pepper so that they can meet up with her sister, Rita.  Rita's worried that her husband will never approve but Elsa insists that Pepper has a pure soul and will be no burden.  Rita feels she has no real choice and heads off to set up the study.  Elsa struggles to leave as Pepper breaks down in tears.  To comfort her, Elsa says that she will always be her family, and when she gets lonely, she can remember the kiss on her hand and place it on her cheek \n"}, {"text": "To Maggie's shock, what's the newest exhibit at the American Morbidity Museum?", "correct": "Lobster hands", "options": ["A two-headed corpse", "Legless Suzi", "Pepper's head"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLobster hands.\n\n\tMaggie takes Desiree northward to the American Morbidity Museum to unveil the truth and provide a witness if and when Stanley catches wind of Maggie's plan to expose him.  As soon as they enter the halls of curios and freak parts, Des is shocked to find Ma Petite's body, intact, preserved, and suspended in a glass jar.  Stanley got $3,000 for it.

Pepper was eager to help out, both with the baby and her sister, but raising the baby put strain on Rita and her husband.  Rita tells Sister Mary Eunice that Pepper killed Lucas, slicing his ears off and drowning him, but it was actually Rita's husband.  The two of them, seeking an exit from both Pepper and Lucas, schemed to get her away by framing her and they succeeded.
