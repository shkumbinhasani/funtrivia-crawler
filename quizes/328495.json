Taking in $37,000,000 in the box office, the movie was added to the National Film Registry for its importance in American culture.  Starring Spike Lee, Danny Aiello, Samuel L. Jackson and a large ensemble cast, \"Do the Right Thing\" followed a group of inner-city residents as they struggled with racial tensions and the stifling weather problem (in the form of a heat wave).  The overpowering, warm weather symbolized racial tensions, a major theme of the film. While the movie was nominated for two Academy Awards, it did not win either. \n"}, {"text": "While not specifically about a particular weather anomaly, the main character, played by Nicolas Cage, had a job that fit the theme quite well.  What 2005 Gore Verbinski film would this be?", "correct": "The Weather Man", "options": ["Storm Chaser", "Windtalkers", "Little Miss Sunshine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Weather Man.\n\n\t\"The Weather Man\", released in 2005, starred Nicolas Cage as (brace yourselves) a weather man who really didn't have a lucky streak.  Plagued by problems off-camera, Cage's character dealt with his personal and family life while trying to be successful on-screen and at work.  The movie also starred Michael Caine, and while Verbinski, who helmed the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies and \"The Ring\", has been notable for generating revenue, \"The Weather Man\" bombed taking in only $19,000,000.  Critics didn't really care for it either, so things never really worked out. Coincidentally, Cage also starred in \"Windtalkers\" in 2002.  It wasn't really about the wind. \n"}, {"text": "A film in the documentary genre, what 2006 weather-themed movie was narrated by Al Gore?", "correct": "An Inconvenient Truth", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn Inconvenient Truth.\n\n\tPremiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2006, \"An Inconvenient Truth\" was integral in promoting awareness of global warming and climate change.  Debunking many scientific myths and providing proof that humans have been the cause of possibly irreversible damage to our planet, Al Gore's work in the film won an Academy Award for 'Best Documentary Feature' (and 'Best Original Song').  The movie earned nearly $50,000,000 in the box office and became one of the highest-grossing theatrical-run documentaries of all time.  Gore went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize the following year. \n"}, {"text": "In this 2010 Martin Scorsese film, Leonardo DiCaprio investigated a disappearance on an island prison before an uncanny storm blew in and trapped him without an escape.  What film was this?", "correct": "Shutter Island", "options": ["The 11th Hour", "Inception", "Revolutionary Road"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShutter Island.\n\n\tBased on a novel written by \"Mystic River\" author, Dennis Lehane, \"Shutter Island\" appeared in theaters in early 2010 and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels, an investigator called to the mysterious Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate who could never have possibly escaped.  When a storm appeared on the island, he and his partner (played by Mark Ruffalo) became trapped and unable to leave on the only ferry back to the mainland.  This storm caused certain damages to the buildings in the compound and opened up more questions in regards to the overall mystery of the film.\r\"Shutter Island\" wasn't as well-received as Scorsese's other films, but it managed to take in almost $300,000,000 in the box office (definitely a plus).  DiCaprio later starred in Christopher Nolan's \"Inception\" in the same year. \n"}, {"text": "Following the story of the Andrea Gail, what 2000 film about a ship at sea (in quite inclement weather) starred George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg?", "correct": "The Perfect Storm", "options": ["Daylight", "Storm of the Century", "Poseidon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Perfect Storm.\n\n\tDirected by Wolfgang Petersen, who also directed \"Troy\", \"Air Force One\", and \"Poseidon\", \"The Perfect Storm\" appeared in theaters in 2000 and was quite popular with movie-goers (taking in over $325,000,000).  Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, and John C. Reilly, the movie involved a fishing boat at sea caught in a truly devastating ocean storm.  While the film was said to be 'based on a true story', the screenplay was adapted from a book by Sebastian Junger.  The film was only moderately well-received by critics, but it did earn a fair bit of money. \n"}, {"text": "Sure, in this 1982 John Carpenter film there was an alien, but another danger was the Antarctic blizzard raging outside.  What movie was it?", "correct": "The Thing", "options": ["Alien Vs. Predator", "Whiteout", "The Last Winter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Thing.\n\n\tStarring Kurt Russell, \"The Thing\" was a 1982 horror flick about a crew of researchers in Antarctica.  After some odd events out on the ice, an alien parasite eventually made its way into the film and its unique perk was the ability to transform itself into the likeness of any human it came into contact with.  Trapping the researchers in their compound was a friendly blizzard (of course).  Only making $18,000,000 in the box office, the film was released around the same time as \"E. T.: The Extraterrestrial\" and fell by the way-side because of this cinematic juggernaut. \n"}, {"text": "Set in an Indiana town, what 1998 heist film set during a flood starred Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater?", "correct": "Hard Rain", "options": ["Deep Rising", "The Flood", "Inside Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHard Rain.\n\n\tDirected by Mikael Salomon in 1998, \"Hard Rain\" earned just under $20,000,000 in the U.S. box office- fifty million less than its budget.  Receiving generally negative reviews and a low domestic earning, the movie was considered a large flop.  Starring Morgan Freeman, Christian Slater, Randy Quaid, and Minnie Driver, \"Hard Rain\" involved a truly rainy storm and the flood which followed in small-town-America.  As the waters began to rise, a heist was in progress throughout the film.  A damn burst, more water got everywhere...it was pretty wet. \n"}, {"text": "In 1996, Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton came face to face with nature's wrath in what blockbuster film?", "correct": "Twister", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwister.\n\n\tDirected by Jan de Bont (known for \"Speed\", \"The Haunting\", and other films), \"Twister\" followed a group of storm-chasers traveling through Oklahoma for scientific research.  While much of the movie was based around the Paxton-Hunt relationship within, there were several scenes in which ripping winds, cyclones, and horrible storms tore everything to bits and razed small towns in the central States. Nominated for two technical Academy Awards, the film earned nearly $500,000,000 in the summer of 1996.  The movie was co-written and co-produced by author Michael Crichton who previously wrote \"Jurassic Park\". \n"}, {"text": "Tornadoes in Los Angeles, a tsunami in New York city, and an impromptu blizzard freezing the Northern Hemisphere all appeared in what 2004 disaster film?", "correct": "The Day After Tomorrow", "options": ["Disaster Movie", "2012", "Apocalypto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow.\n\n\tStarring Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, and others, this movie (directed by Roland Emmerich) was very popular.  Fueled by environmental concern and the subsequent release of \"An Inconvenient Truth\", the movie took in over $650,000,000 in the box office (worldwide) and became one of 2004's top films.  Due to Emmerich's penchant for destroying everything ever created, the film featured a number of scenes in which humanity's very existence is threatened. He later followed this up with the blockbuster, \"2012\".  Despite the movie's popularity, \"The Day After Tomorrow\" was deemed extremely inaccurate from a scientific standpoint. \n"}, {"text": "According to one 2009 Dreamworks animated film, the weather was \"Cloudy with a Chance\" of which one of these?", "correct": "Meatballs", "options": ["Sunshine", "Pain", "Frogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeatballs.\n\n\t\"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" released in the summer of 2009 earning over $200,000,000 in the box office.  Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the movie starred Bill Hader, Anna Faris, and a large ensemble cast.  The plot followed a children's story released in 1978 and it received relatively good critical reviews.  In the movie, clouds had a tendency to rain certain foods...kinda delicious, really.  The movie was created by Sony Pictures Animation who also created \"Surf's Up\" and \"Open Season\". \n"}]}
