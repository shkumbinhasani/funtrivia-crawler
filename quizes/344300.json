After amassing millions upon millions of views over the years, Brolsma appeared in legitimate TV shows, commercials, and music videos.  After less than four years online, 'The Numa Numa Guy' video was sneaking up on ten million views.  As most viral videos do, this particular online video received tons of copycats and parodies. \n"}, {"text": "Appearing on the web in 2003, 'Star Wars Kid' featured a teenager pretending to wield a lightsaber in his garage.  What item was substituted for a lightsaber?", "correct": "Golf ball retriever", "options": ["Baseball bat", "Wooden staff", "Tent pole"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolf ball retriever.\n\n\tHere's a video that was never intended to see the light of day.  Filmed by a Canadian teenager, the video was found by his school friends on a cassette and placed online in 2003 against the 'Star Wars Kid's' best wishes; a lawsuit ensued, but after over a billion views, the video was too popular not to be unseen.  'Star Wars Kid' was parodied on nearly every major animated show in the 2000s as well as comedies such as \"Arrested Development\".  The video simply features the kid swinging a golf club around the basement to the \"Star Wars\" theme. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the internet celebrity known for singing \"Chocolate Rain\" in 2007?", "correct": "Tay Zonday", "options": ["Hampton the Hamster", "Antoine Dodson", "\"General\" Larry Platt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTay Zonday.\n\n\tWinner of a 2007 YouTube Award, the \"Chocolate Rain\" video was latched onto by avid viral viewers very quickly, particularly because of singer Tay Zonday's odd voice, trite lyrics, and awkward production.  Tay Zonday, whose real name is Adam Nyerere Bahner, made fame because of his tendency to \"move away from the mic to breathe in\" (something he notes in the song) and he appeared in several parodies and TV shows after amassing tens of millions of views.  Many famous musicians have also made attempts to perform the song...live. \n"}, {"text": "Which band, known for their viral 'one-take' music videos, won a Grammy after a release featuring treadmills in 2006?", "correct": "OK Go", "options": ["Weezer", "Radiohead", "Foo Fighters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOK Go.\n\n\t2006 saw the introduction of \"Here It Goes Again\", a single from OK Go's \"Oh No\" album, as a popular viral video.  It features the four band members in a choreographed dance on treadmills.

Other hits from the band include \"This Too Shall Pass\", \"A Million Ways\", and \"White Knuckles\", a video filmed in a single take with SPCA-provided animals looking for adoption. \n"}, {"text": "When someone is 'Rickrolled', they view a video of which musician?", "correct": "Rick Astley", "options": ["Rick Ross", "Rick Davies", "Rick Springfield"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRick Astley.\n\n\tAlthough Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" was first put into a music video in the late-1980s becoming a cult pop song, its appearance online heralded a terrifying new infamy.  Rickrolling, as it is so named, involves posting a URL for a user online and inadvertently linking them to Rick Astley's music video. Its popularity became so great that clever, new ways of getting Rickrolled soon became the norm; videos can be found online in which people hear the song in really odd places, including at work...in singing telegrams...and the reaction is usually priceless.  For April Fools Day in the late 2000s, YouTube linked all of its videos to Rick Astley's song-- it was the largest Rickroll ever conducted. \n"}, {"text": "Although less than a minute long, a certain 2007 video of a baby biting a child's finger became a viral sensation.  What is the name of the baby?", "correct": "Charlie", "options": ["William", "Harry", "Henry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlie.\n\n\tThe video in question is 'Charlie Bit My Finger', a video which amassed over three hundred million views in less than five years.

Spread mostly through word-of-mouth, TV appearances (including \"America's Funniest Home Video\", and mentions in news media outlets, the video view count was bolstered to the extreme.  The children featured in the video, Charlie and his older brother, Harry, appeared in a number of other videos in later years. \n"}, {"text": "\"Algebraic!\"  What absurd animated video starring Finn and Jake received enough viral popularity to result in a TV show?", "correct": "Adventure Time", "options": ["Salad Fingers", "Annoying Orange", "Weebl and Bob"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdventure Time.\n\n\t\"Adventure Time\" was originally made as an animated short and posted to YouTube in 2008.  After receiving millions of views, the show was picked up by the U.S. Cartoon Network in 2010, becoming \"Adventure Time with Finn and Jake\".  The original pilot video online followed Finn and his canine friend, Jake, as they spouted math terms while saving Princess Rainicorn from the evil Ice King in his fortress. This, of course, involved an out-of-body trip to Mars to meet Abraham Lincoln...you know...because.  The surreal comedy of the pilot and the show had no bounds it seemed, and it paid off.  After all, it was viral enough to not only garner a full-fledged show, but positive reviews. \n"}, {"text": "Charlie's adventures to Candy Mountain, to visit the Banana King, and under the sea all became viral animated videos.  What is Charlie?", "correct": "A unicorn", "options": ["A dragon", "A middle-aged banker", "A chimera"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA unicorn.\n\n\t\"Charlie the Unicorn\" debuted on Newgrounds in 2005, slowly progressing to the FilmCow Youtube page and website.  The entire thing was created by Jason Steele who designed the entire video using Flash animation; it proved to be a successful venture and several sequels were created.  Like \"Adventure Time\", \"Charlie the Unicorn\" benefits by surreal whimsy and absurdist humour. Charlie, a grey unicorn, is essentially assaulted by two mysterious unicorns, one blue and one pink, as they go off on adventures for really unique items (eg. Candy Mountain, the Banana King's crown, etc.).  FilmCow's later productions including \"Llamas With Hats\" and \"Detective Mittens\" also had somewhat of a cult following in terms of internet memes. \n"}, {"text": "In less than a year, Nyan Cat received over fifty million views in 2011.  What is Nyan Cat's body?", "correct": "A Pop Tart", "options": ["A toaster", "A steak", "A comet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Pop Tart.\n\n\tNyan Cat is an extremely simple GIF set to a loop; a cat with a Pop Tart body moves along the night sky with a rainbow following behind.  And yet millions of people have turned on the video.  In a lot of cases, Nyan Cat videos can run for hours-- the original only ran for an hour and a half though.  Oh, and did I mention the song?  Nyan Cat flies through the skies to an obnoxious song whose only lyrics are \"Nyannyannyannyannyannyan...\"\rThe cat image was created by Christopher Torres, but it was revised as an animation and music was added after several revisions by different YouTube members.  The original \"Nyan Cat\" and its subsequent versions were truly a pastiche of different elements from different users. \n"}, {"text": "In 2011, ARK Music Factory released a music video featuring teenager Rebecca Black.  What was the title of her notorious song?", "correct": "Friday", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFriday.\n\n\tFull of trite lyrics and auto-tuned vocals, \"Friday\" became an instant sensation, even appearing on music charts in the U.S.  Highly-disliked by most viewers, Black ended up going from a normal teenage life to appearing on news programs, her popularity fueled by social media.  \"Friday\" became so popular that other artists began performing it in live concerts and it appeared on TV's \"Glee\".\rThe popularity got out of control and ARK Music Factory claimed exclusive rights to both Black and the video.  After several months of legal back-and-forth, Black signed onto a new label, added the video to her own YouTube channel, posted the single on iTunes, and started to work on her first album, all in the span of eight months. \n"}]}
