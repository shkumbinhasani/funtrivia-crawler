The Cardinal pitcher Dean, was hit by a line drive in the first inning of this all-star game from Earl Averill of the Indians and broke his toe.  Dizzy still continued to pitch but came out of the game in the third inning. Returning from the injury too soon, it caused Dean to hurt his pitching arm while pitching from an altered stance.  He never came back to form again.  After winning 20+ games in four consecutive seasons prior, Dean never won more than eight games in a season after the 1937 game. \n"}, {"text": "Which league almost became the third Major League in the 1940s?", "correct": "Pacific Coast League", "options": ["Union Association", "American Association", "National Association"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPacific Coast League.\n\n\tThe other leagues all went defunct in the 19th century.  It almost came about in 1946.  Part owner of the San Francisco Seals, Paul Fagan, came up with the idea in 1945 to stop supplying Major League teams with the players from the PCL.  He increased the salaries of all the Seal players, flew them first class, stayed at the best hotels, etc. At the time where it almost came to be, the other team owners backed down, refusing to increase their players' salaries.  After the 1946 PCL season, Ferris Fain was sold to the Philadelphia Athletics of the Major Leagues.  He was furious because he was taking a big pay cut with his new team. \n"}, {"text": "Which second baseman came down with tuberculosis, helping to prevent his team from winning their league pennant in the 1950s?", "correct": "Red Schoendienst", "options": ["Lee Mazzilli", "Ed Kranepool", "Randy Hundley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed Schoendienst.\n\n\tNone of the others listed played in the 1950s, and none were second basemen.
