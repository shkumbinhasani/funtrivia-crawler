Which of these best describes Qatar?", "correct": "Peninsula", "options": ["Island", "Quagmire", "Landlocked"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeninsula.\n\n\tQatar is a small country located in the Persian Gulf, but not as an island nation.

There is the quail, quahog, and queen bee, just to name a few. \n"}, {"text": "This question quarters quarts.  How much IS a quarter of a quart (US liquid measurement)?", "correct": "Cup", "options": ["Pint", "Ounce", "Gallon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCup.\n\n\tSometimes the US measuring system can be very confusing.  There are four quarts in a gallon, two pints in a quart, and two cups in a pint.  There are also 8 ounces in a cup.\r To remember how many of one measurement fits in another, draw a giant G, and place four Q's inside of it.  Then, in each Q, draw two P's, and in each P draw two C's.  Keep this handy chart for reference.  Using this chart, it is easy to see that a quarter (1/4) of a quart is a cup.  There are 4 cups in a quart.\r Hey, I could have asked how many ounces were in a gallon!\r 128 ounces, by the way. \n"}, {"text": "A Quizzyland quiz would not qualify as quality without a question on Quaid.\n\nWhich of these films did Dennis Quaid NOT star as a man named Frank?", "correct": "The Day After Tomorrow", "options": ["Frequency", "Far From Heaven", "Yours, Mine, and Ours"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow.\n\n\tDennis Quaid apparently likes playing guys named Frank.

It gained such high popularity that it became one of the most merchandised arcade games of all time, behind none other than \"Pac-Man\" and \"Donkey Kong\".  Q*Bert appeared on many things, including t-shirts, frisbees, and even an animated cartoon.  Interestingly, in 2007, \"Q*Bert\" became the first classic arcade video game to be released for the PlayStation 3's Playstation Network.  The game became Gottlieb's most successful arcade game.\r Cool fact: \"Q*Bert\" was simply named \"Cubes\" during development, though it also was given the name \"Snots and Boogers\" and \"@!#?@!\" during development.  The latter was named after the symbols that appear when \"Q*Bert\" is hit by an enemy.  Of course, this title was scrapped, and for good reason.  You try telling someone that your favorite game is \"@!#?@!\". \n"}]}
