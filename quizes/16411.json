Wechsler developed intelligence tets for adults (WAIS) and for children (WISC). The tests usually involve many diverse areas such as vocabulary, spatial relationships, etc. Tests of this sort must be 'valid' - do they really test intelligence'? - and 'reliable' - will the scores be consistent - so that a re-test of a person will not elicit a widely different score. \n"}, {"text": "Jean Piaget is the dominant name in the field of", "correct": "Child Development", "options": ["Abnormal Psychology", "Altered States", "Operant Conditioning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChild Development.\n\n\tPiaget's prominence derives from his work in the development of children's intelligence. One interesting question in this area: are changes in intelligence as a child grows 'quantitative' - a change in the 'amount' of intelligence - or 'qualitative' -a change in the 'nature' of intelligence? \n"}, {"text": "The best-known projective test for assessing personality is the Rorschach inkblot test. Another projective test is the", "correct": "TAT", "options": ["Stanford-Binet", "MMPI", "WAIS"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTAT.\n\n\tThe Thematic Apperception Test is an effective and commonly used projective test. The MMPI also deals with assessing personality, but it is an objective test (rather than a projective one). The other two tests measure intelligence. \n"}, {"text": "Primitive man used to drill holes in the heads of 'crazy' people in order to let the evil spirits escape.

Dissociative disorders are not considered to be psychoses. \n"}, {"text": "In a famous experiment, this naturalist 'imprinted' young geese so that they reacted to him as if he were their mother", "correct": "Konrad Lorenz", "options": ["Robert Ardrey", "John Eccles", "Anthony Storr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKonrad Lorenz.\n\n\tWherever Lorenz went, the geese followed. Interesting pictures of him walking around his yard - followed by a bunch of goslings. \n"}, {"text": "In a famous experiment, two monkeys were given levers to control. One found that he could prevent the administration of shocks to his body by using the lever; the other found that he had no control over when shocks were administered to him.

It's the monkey who has the ability to control the shocks that suffered from the stress of always having to be alert and vigilant, etc. Hence, modern day executives ... \n"}, {"text": "Which condition is indicative of psychosis?", "correct": "Delusions and Hallucinations", "options": ["Amnesia", "Multiple Personality", "Sociopath"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDelusions and Hallucinations.\n\n\tHallucinations and delusions indicate psychosis.
