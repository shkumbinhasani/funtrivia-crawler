While one boy watched outside, the children and teenagers of Gatlin violently murdered all of the adults.\rThree years ahead, in the present day, the town still exists, but under the rule of the children who spend their time preparing the harvests and living free of moral influence. \n"}, {"text": "Vicky and Burt are driving across the States because Burt is getting a job as which of these?", "correct": "Doctor", "options": ["Teacher", "Farmer", "Salesman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoctor.\n\n\tVicky and Burt end up in Nebraska heading for Washington.  Part of the trip is to move across the country for Burt to take up a job as a doctor in Seattle, but part of it is also a celebration since Burt just graduated.  Much of the drive through Nebraska is spent thinking about the upcoming internship, especially since the landscape bears little more than cornfields as far as the eye can see.\rIn the town of Gatlin, Job and Sarah complain as their friend, Joseph, tries to flee into the cornfield to escape Isaac and Malachai.  He doesn't make it far.  Lost in the corn, he ends up getting found and killed. \n"}, {"text": "Burt and Vicky hit Joseph with their car because they're distracted doing which of these things?", "correct": "Looking at a map", "options": ["Kissing", "Playing with the radio", "Looking in the back seat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLooking at a map.\n\n\tBurt and Vicky end up taking some backroads in Nebraska, inevitably getting lost and passing the town of Gatlin.  While looking at a map, the two end up being distracted enough that they miss seeing Joseph standing in the middle of the road and they hit him with their car.  Burt quickly checks and finds that the boy is dead, but he doesn't know what happened in the fields moments before they got to Gatlin.  Something is very wrong though.  As Burt looks in the nearby field he finds Joseph's suitcase, covered in blood. \n"}, {"text": "Crayons, games, and record players are banned from the town of Gatlin.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSarah and Job, both of whom weren't in the corn the day that 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' made himself known, have long been forgiven by Isaac for not being ardent followers of the Gatlin faith, but there are nonetheless held to the same rules as all of the other children in town.  This is why, when they're found by Malachai in the bedroom of their old house, they're brought in to face punishment. Isaac doesn't punish them, however, when it's also found that one of Job and Sarah's prophetic crayon drawings foretells of a car driving into Gatlin at the same time.  They decide to warn 'the old man'.  The will of 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' shall be done. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the only adult who still lives in Gatlin, three years after the tragedy occurred there?", "correct": "The mechanic", "options": ["The librarian", "The pastor", "The ice cream man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe mechanic.\n\n\tWhile Burt checks the fields, Vicky doesn't notice the teenager with the bloody blade approaching the vehicle.  Burt comes back before anything can happen though and he places Joseph's body into the trunk of the car.  They check the suitcase that was left in the field to find odd religious artifacts, eventually coming across an old mechanic's shop and the town of Gatlin's only surviving adult.  The old man sends them away towards the highway, and for that he's killed by Malachai and others as a storm rolls in overhead.\rBurt and Vicky end up driving towards Gatlin anyways; someone seems to have been messing with the road signs. \n"}, {"text": "Who do Burt and Vicky find in a house in Gatlin?", "correct": "Sarah", "options": ["Rachel", "Job", "Isaac"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSarah.\n\n\tIsaac leads his congregation in worship in the fields and he tells his followers that he had a dream in the night in which 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' warned him of Joseph's betrayal and the arrival of two outlanders who would need to be sacrificed.\rSure enough, Vicky and Burt arrive in Gatlin proper to find the town nearly deserted.  They end up stumbling upon an unlocked cafe to find the place covered in corn husks, but otherwise empty.  They don't seem to notice the children watching their every move until they go back to their car.  On their way out of Gatlin, they see a door open at Job and Sarah's house and investigate finding only Sarah inside.  Sarah tells them that her parents-- all of the parents-- are in the cornfield, and Isaac put them there.  Burt decides he wants to go to town hall to report the body in his trunk, so Vicky decides to say with Sarah and the car. \n"}, {"text": "Vicky is prepared as a sacrifice in the cornfield.  What do they do to her?", "correct": "Hang her from a cross.", "options": ["Place her in a pit.", "Fill her with corn.", "Lock her in a barn."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHang her from a cross.\n\n\tWhile Burt searches Gatlin, Vicky is found by the children (led by Malachai) in Sarah's house and seized; they carry her out to the corn.  Ironically, Sarah's most recent picture depicts Vicky getting taken by the other children.  Burt, meanwhile, ends up finding town hall and discovers that something is truly amiss.  When he gets back to the house he finds that his car has been filled with corn and rendered unusable.\rIn the fields, Vicky is prepared for sacrifice while Isaac argues with Malachai about his actions, mainly because Malachai spilled too much blood without offering and killed their main source of fuel in the old man without discussion.  The children will still need to obtain Burt. \n"}, {"text": "The children of Gatlin are only kept alive until what age?", "correct": "19", "options": ["18", "21", "20"], "explanation": "\n\n\n19.\n\n\tBurt heads out to the fields to find that a path has formed supernaturally in the corn for him to follow.  He's led to the field next to the nearby church, but that's not where Vicky is being placed onto a corn-decorated cross.  Instead, he finds children performing a horrifying blood ritual for one of their peoples' nineteenth birthday.  One of them stabs him before he flees to evade capture, going on a lengthy chase through Gatlin until Job helps him find a good hiding spot in a storm cellar with him and Sarah.\rOut in the fields, Malachai takes the lead of the children, demanding that the others place Isaac on a cross as well to be judged by 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' himself.  Malachai also uses Vicky as bait to call out Burt, but Burt doesn't show until Job tells him what's been going on in the fields anyways. \n"}, {"text": "'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' resurrects who of the following?", "correct": "Isaac", "options": ["Burt", "Malachai", "The Blue Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsaac.\n\n\tAs the sun begins to set, Isaac insists to the others that their decision to use him as a sacrifice breaks the rules set out by 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' as he is meant to be the vessel through which their God speaks.  Sure enough, the children's sacrifice of Isaac angers 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows'.  A supernatural light overtakes Isaac and tosses him through the air, giving Burt the opportunity to free Vicky and fight with Malachai.  The fight comes to an end when Isaac returns from the cornfield, resurrected by their god, to claim Malachai's soul.  And then the storm begins. \n"}, {"text": "How is 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' removed from Gatlin?", "correct": "With fire", "options": ["With snow", "With blood", "With compassion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith fire.\n\n\tVicky and Burt join the children in the nearby barn in an attempt to ride out the supernatural storm caused by 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows'' anger.  A page from the Bible leads Burt and Vicky to discover a method of beating the false god in the field-- they need to cast it into the lake of fire.  Using the gasohol stills in the barn and several hoses, Burt and Job manage to set fire to the entire field and save Gatlin from the supernatural horror pursuing them.  They all reunite at the barn and, happily, Burt, Vicky, Job, and Sarah decide to leave for Seattle together on foot. \n"}]}
