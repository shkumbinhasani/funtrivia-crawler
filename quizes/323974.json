Boys vs. Girls is the matter at hand, and both sides need to create a suitable mash-up to take to sectionals.  The boys take a mash-up of \"It's My Life\" (by Bon Jovi) and \"Confessions, Pt. II\" (by Usher).  The catch?  Terri, who took a position as school nurse, gave them an ingredient used in decongestants to keep them mentally alert.  The entire performance is done hyped-up on meds.\rThe \"It's My Life\"/\"Confessions Pt. II\" mash-up was released as a single and appeared at #30 on the US Billboard charts, but never made an appearance on the \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 1\" collection. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Vitamin D\", the girls of New Directions perform a mash-up of Beyonce's \"Halo\" and a song by which artist/group?", "correct": "Katrina and the Waves", "options": ["Joan Jett", "Madonna", "Tina Turner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKatrina and the Waves.\n\n\tThe girls, surprised by the boys' performance, are still confident about their mash-up, a cross between Beyonce's \"Halo\" and Katrina and the Waves' \"Walking on Sunshine\".

While Sue's Kids perform Jill Scott's \"Hate on Me\", Will creates a performance of Jordin Sparks and Chris Brown's \"No Air\".  By the time they're actually ready to perform, Brittany and Puck have defected sides (Dutch and Jewish backgrounds made them eligible) and Quinn pretends that she is angry with the lack of leading roles to split them up for Sue's sake.\r\"No Air\" appeared on the \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 1\" set and was released as a single in the US, peaking at #65 on the Billboard Charts.
