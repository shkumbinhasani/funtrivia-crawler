{"id": "52176", "name": "Chasing Amy Online Trivia | Chasing Amy | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Chasing Amy"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the official name of the two-man 'corporation' that makes 'Bluntman and Chronic' comic books?", "correct": "Bank Holdup Studios", "options": ["Holden and Banky, Ltd.", "The McNeil-Edwards Report", "Snootchie Bootches, Inc."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBank Holdup Studios.\n\n\tWe see the name of their live-in studio on the sign outside their apartment building, early in the film. \n"}, {"text": "What company occupies the floor above Holden and Banky's studio?", "correct": "Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements", "options": ["Katz and Doggett Veterinary Clinic", "Styx and Stone Publishing", "Beck and Call Investigations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDunn and Reddy Home Improvements.\n\n\tAgain, we get this information from the sign in front of the building. The roofer who discussed 'Return Of the Jedi' with Dante and Randal in 'Clerks' stated that he worked for Dunn and Reddy! \n"}, {"text": "At the comics convention that opens the film, 'Madman' creator Michael Allred is signing autographs. He disagrees with a fan who suggests that a certain actor should star in a prospective 'Madman' movie. Who is the actor?", "correct": "Chow Yun-Fat", "options": ["Dennis Dun", "Jet Li", "Jackie Chan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChow Yun-Fat.\n\n\tFor what it's worth, I agree. Allred is actually responsible for almost all of the 'Bluntman and Chronic' and 'Chasing Amy' artwork seen in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "A fan at the same convention describes Bluntman and Chronic as 'Bill and Ted meets Cheech and Chong!' Holden McNeil says that he sees them as 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern meet...' whom?", "correct": "Vladimir and Estragon", "options": ["Batman and Robin", "Jay and Silent Bob", "Starsky and Hutch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVladimir and Estragon.\n\n\tVladimir and Estragon are the protagonists of Samuel Beckett's 'Waiting For Godot.' A rather lofty reference, and it appropriately whooshes right over the head of the fan in question (played by Ethan Suplee, who also played Willam in Smith's previous film 'Mallrats'). \n"}, {"text": "At the 'minority panel' at the convention, who is seated next to Alyssa Jones?", "correct": "Bryan White", "options": ["Artie Gray", "Alan Green", "Kyle Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBryan White.\n\n\tWe're never told what comic Bryan works on...or why, as a white male, he's part of the 'minority panel.' Perhaps he's gay?  Jewish?  Atheist? \n"}, {"text": "Hooper X wears a prominent button high on the lapel of his leather jacket. What does it say?", "correct": "'The black man is God'", "options": ["'Black power'", "'Black is beautiful'", "'By any means necessary'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The black man is God'.\n\n\tAlyssa Jones observes that Hooper sounds like Minister Farakhan when he's on stage, and Michael Jackson when he's not. \n"}, {"text": "Alyssa Jones writes and draws a comic book whose theme she describes as 'hearts and flowers.' Finish its title: 'Idiosyncratic _________.'", "correct": "Routine", "options": ["Chronicles", "Life", "Observations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoutine.\n\n\tThe book doesn't sell nearly as well as 'Bluntman and Chronic' -- Alyssa muses that if she sells two copies, she 'feels like John Grisham.' \n"}, {"text": "Hooper X's comic is called 'White-Hatin' Coon.' What is the name of this comic's protagonist?", "correct": "Maleekwa", "options": ["Wameekla", "Kaleekma", "Laweekma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaleekwa.\n\n\tThe only image we really get of Maleekwa is the cover of the issue that Hooper holds during his 'sermon.' \n"}, {"text": "The first time we see Holden and Banky at work in their studio, Banky compliments Holden on how well he's drawn a particular object. What is the object?", "correct": "a streetlight", "options": ["a car", "a park bench", "a fire hydrant"], "explanation": "\n\n\na streetlight.\n\n\tBanky: 'That's one of the best streetlights you've ever drawn.' Holden: 'Thanks. It's the one in front of the post office.' \n"}, {"text": "Just before Hooper calls to invite Holden to the city, Holden asks Banky what he'd like to do that night. Banky's big plans are to order a pizza and watch a particular television show. What is the show?", "correct": "'DeGrassi Junior High'", "options": ["'The Greatest American Hero'", "'Melrose Place'", "'Clerks: The Animated Series'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'DeGrassi Junior High'.\n\n\tHolden: 'You've got a weird thing for Canadian melodrama.' Banky: 'I've got a weird thing for girls who say 'aboot'.' \n"}, {"text": "When the MTV producers make their offer to Holden and Banky, what object can be seen behind Holden and Banky?", "correct": "a giant wooden fork", "options": ["a giant MTV symbol", "a giant 'Beavis and Butthead' poster", "a giant 'Mallrats' poster"], "explanation": "\n\n\na giant wooden fork.\n\n\tWhatever significance the fork had was lost on me...but then, I haven't watched MTV in quite some time. The MTV producers were played by Brian O'Halloran (Dante Hicks from 'Clerks') and Matt Damon. \n"}, {"text": "The MTV producers express a desire to adapt the 'Bluntman and Chronic' comic into an animated series. How many half-hour episodes do they want to make?", "correct": "12", "options": ["13", "26", "22"], "explanation": "\n\n\n12.\n\n\tKind of a strange number of episodes for a television season -- or even half-season -- but there you go. \n"}, {"text": "What words are spray-painted on Banky Edwards' bedroom door?", "correct": "'Sex Room'", "options": ["'Here Lies (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Boy'", "'Banky Wuz Here'", "'The Bluntcave'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Sex Room'.\n\n\tYou'd think that Holden's room would be the 'Sex Room,' since he's the only one of the two having sex...but, no. \n"}, {"text": "During the scene in which Holden and Alyssa play darts, what words are clearly written or painted on the wall behind them, between the men's and women's bathrooms?", "correct": "'And on the eighth day God created Beer!'", "options": ["'Knicks Rule!'", "'Kilroy was here'", "'Jesus Saves...but Gretzky recovers and SCORES!'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'And on the eighth day God created Beer!'.\n\n\tPretty standard bar graffiti, I'd say. \n"}, {"text": "Holden bows out of an out-of-town comics convention at the last second so that he can hang out with Alyssa for the weekend. Where would he have wound up if she hadn't beeped him in time?", "correct": "Boston, MA", "options": ["Pittsburgh, PA", "Baltimore, MD", "Washington, DC"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston, MA.\n\n\tHolden: 'Last-minute invitation to the BostonCon.' \n"}, {"text": "During the scene where Alyssa talks Holden into blowing off the invitation to the out-of-town comic book convention, she is wearing a jersey emblazoned with the logo of a certain hockey team. Which team is it?", "correct": "the Toronto Maple Leafs", "options": ["the New York Rangers", "the New Jersey Devils", "the New York Islanders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n\tAccording to Kevin Smith's commentary on the DVD, it was very difficult for him to get Joey Lauren Adams to agree to wear a Toronto jersey.  Apparently, she's not fond of the team. \n"}, {"text": "For at least the first half of the film, Banky Edwards always wears the same hat, backwards. What words have been stitched into the back of the hat (and are thus visible on his forehead)?", "correct": "'Snootchie bootches, Bluntman!'", "options": ["'Mooby the Golden Calf'", "'Bluntman and Chronic'", "'Bank Holdup Studios'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Snootchie bootches, Bluntman!'.\n\n\tI'm guessing that the hat would fetch a fair price, were Jason Lee to put it up for an online auction. \n"}, {"text": "Just before Holden and Banky learn that Alyssa is a lesbian, she is called up on stage by a member of her former band. Who played this old friend of Alyssa's?", "correct": "Guinivere Turner", "options": ["Ileana Douglas", "Julie Cypher", "Natasha Gregson Wagner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuinivere Turner.\n\n\tTurner, an accomplished actress, writer, and producer, is a good friend of Kevin Smith's. He even named a 'Mallrats' character after her -- the one played by Joey Lauren Adams, in fact. \n"}, {"text": "Holden admonishes Banky for essentially gay-bashing the team he was losing to in his game of Sega Hockey. Which team bore the brunt of Banky's angry remarks?", "correct": "the Hartford Whalers", "options": ["the Mighty Ducks Of Anaheim", "the Montreal Canadiens", "the Detroit Red Wings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe Hartford Whalers.\n\n\tHolden: 'If you're gonna get so bent out of shape while playing the game, so much that you feel the need to curse the TV, try not to gay-bash it, all right? You're not that kind of guy.' \n"}, {"text": "Alyssa wants to purchase a painting for Holden in a diner. The price tag on the painting says $75.00. She offers the man at the cash register a lesser amount for it. What is her offer?", "correct": "$50.00", "options": ["$30.00", "$37.50", "$5.00"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$50.00\n\n\tWhen Holden learns that Alyssa bought him the painting so that he'll 'always remember their friendship,' he finally feels compelled to confess his love for her. \n"}, {"text": "While in the record store with Holden, Hooper is approached by a young boy who asks him to autograph a comic book for him. Oddly, the comic is not 'White-Hatin' Coon' -- it is, in fact, a much older comic book that Hooper couldn't possibly have contributed to in any way whatsoever, given his age. What comic book is it?", "correct": "'The Avengers'", "options": ["'Black Lightning'", "'Black Panther'", "'Marvel Jungle Action'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Avengers'.\n\n\tBlink and you miss it, but it's definitely an issue of Marvel Comics' 'The Avengers.' Judging by the condition of the comic, the vintage ad on its back cover, and the style of the 'Avengers' logo on the front cover, the issue in question was published in the late 1970's or early 1980's. Rather strange that a relatively young comic book creator would be asked, in 1997, to SIGN a book that he had no part in creating, no? \n"}, {"text": "Jay and Silent Bob meet Holden in a diner to collect their 'likeness rights' money. What's in Jay's chest pocket in this scene?", "correct": "bus tickets", "options": ["a Chronic action figure", "a pocket protector", "a bag of marijuana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbus tickets.\n\n\tJay and Silent Bob are on their way to Chicago (by bus, initially), and the events of Kevin Smith's next film, 'Dogma.' (Minor continuity gaffe: in 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,' the film AFTER 'Dogma,' the duo acts as though they have never traveled by way of a commercial bus line before. Oops.) \n"}, {"text": "When Banky discovers Holden and Alyssa asleep on his couch, what time is it?", "correct": "8:14 AM", "options": ["8:44 AM", "9:14 AM", "7:44 AM"], "explanation": "\n\n\n8:14 AM.\n\n\tWe get a clear close-up of the clock radio -- it flips over to 8:14 about two seconds before a shocked Banky drops his orange juice, waking Holden and Alyssa. \n"}, {"text": "It is revealed that Alyssa is well-acquainted with several of the characters who appeared in (or were referenced in) 'Clerks' and 'Mallrats.' Which of the following people does she NOT mention knowing personally?", "correct": "Brodie Bruce from 'Mallrats'", "options": ["Julie Dwyer from 'Clerks' and 'Mallrats'", "Caitlin Bree from 'Clerks'", "Gwen Turner from 'Mallrats'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrodie Bruce from 'Mallrats'.\n\n\tJulie Dwyer, whose funeral Dante and Randal disrupted in 'Clerks', was a friend of Alyssa's -- she was at that funeral, in fact. Caitlin Bree, Dante's almost-rekindled-love from 'Clerks,' was Alyssa's best friend. Gwen Turner joined Alyssa and Shannon Hamilton in a romantic tryst -- which is quite amusing when you consider that in 'Mallrats,' Gwen and Shannon were played, respectively, by Joey Lauren Adams and Ben Affleck! \n"}, {"text": "In the final convention scene, we see that Banky Edwards has moved on and created a new comic book all on his own. What is the name of this comic?", "correct": "'Baby Dave'", "options": ["'Chasing Amy'", "'Bluntman Solo Adventures'", "'Banky's Beauties'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Baby Dave'.\n\n\t'Baby Dave' is a reference to cinematographer David Klein. \n"}]}
