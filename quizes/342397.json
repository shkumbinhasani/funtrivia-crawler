Before she can take three steps on the routine being practiced, she starts to feel sick and heads to a nearby trash can.  Santana, back in New Directions after swearing her loyalty, claims that Mercedes is only sick because she ate Quizno's and Mercedes doesn't deny it-- she's been too stressed with everything she's had to do over the last while and she claims she's putting 100% effort in.  Will thinks she isn't and that it's not about doing your best anymore; it's about doing better.\rAt home, Will finds Emma's stash of bridal magazines and confronts her about it.  He says he's not worried because it's the direction they're heading, but he wonders why he hasn't met her parents yet.  She says they're dead; he rebuts with the fact that she called them last night.  She says instead that she just wants to take things slow. \n"}, {"text": "What school does Mike Chang's father want his son to attend?", "correct": "Harvard", "options": ["UCLA", "Yale", "University of Ohio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarvard.\n\n\tIn Principal Figgins' office, Mike's father suspects that his son might be on drugs because of his waning 'A-' grade in chemistry.  Figgins claims that Mike's actually one of the best students in school at the moment and perhaps he's taking this too hard.  Instead, Mr. Chang insists that his son is set for Harvard but there are some road blocks standing in his way, particularly his vampiric girlfriend and Glee Club which, as advisers have said, might actually be a detriment.  Mike says that he'll pay for a tutor; he just wants to stay in Glee Club.\rIn the football locker room, Coach Beiste informs the guys that they'll all be trying out for dancing roles in \"West Side Story\" because it's been shown to boost IQ and get footballers on \"Dancing with the Stars\".  Everyone turns to Mike at that moment though he's off in his own mind. \n"}, {"text": "Who encourages Mercedes to fulfill her aspirations of being a leading lady?", "correct": "Shane", "options": ["Kurt", "Rachel", "Santana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShane.\n\n\tIn the cafeteria, Mercedes gives Rachel a hug and her boyfriend, Shane, says that it was a foolish thing to do since she's her direct competition.  He claims that Mercedes needs to know that she's better than Rachel in order to get the part and she gets the confidence boost she needs to perform Jennifer Hudson's \"Spotlight\" for her audition (with Brittany and Tina) providing backing vocals.  In the choir room she watches as Will seems to give preferential treatment to Rachel and she decides that it's her turn to shine.  With Shane watching from offstage, Mercedes' performance greatly intrigues the judges and worries Rachel.\rIn the halls, Mike tells Tina that he isn't auditioning for the role of Riff in the play anymore because he got an 'Asian F'.  She says that he needs to be honest with his parents to follow his dreams but he thinks it's not that easy. \n"}, {"text": "To motivate students to cast their votes her way, Brittany performs a song by which pop artist during a pep rally?", "correct": "Beyonce", "options": ["Pink", "Rihanna", "Britney Spears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeyonce.\n\n\tKurt tells Rachel that his only opposition for the presidency is Brittany and the straw polls have him leading by 11%, so he doesn't need to worry about Brittany being taken seriously.  While they try to hand out unicorn-themed buttons (created by Brittany for Kurt's campaign the week earlier) Santana and Brittany arrive to ask Rachel who she's voting for. She claims that her fidelity is pledged to Kurt and Brittany claims that her vote's being into the 'magical, poop-stealing water-chair'.  Brittany states that the patriarchy surrounding the role of President has only gotten the United States into more trouble than it needs and she's having a flash mob pep rally to get her point across. She breaks into a song and dance to Beyonce's \"Run the World (Girls)\" which spills into the auditorium and attracts the attention of the female population of the school.  Kurt is shocked by the amount of people now in her support (even the female teachers). \n"}, {"text": "Does Mike sing during his audition?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe directors of the musical are faced with a difficult choice-- who do they get to play Maria?  They pose the question to Will who, while proud of both girls, suggests that they have a callback.  Mercedes is initially off-put by this decision but she and Rachel are both thrilled to be asked to perform a song that showcases both of their talents later in the week: \"Out Here On My Own\" from \"Fame\".\rMike heads out to meet his chemistry teacher but on his way he stops in at a dance studio in the school.  He decides to take a moment to dance but he can't help but visualize his father's disapproval.  \"It's a hobby, not a career.\"  He also imagines Tina's words-- she wants him to be who he is by knowing that he needs to dance; it's why she fell in love with him.\rMike, though late for his audition, shows up and wows the judges to a song and dance from \"West Side Story\".  He performs \"Cool\", having practiced his singing especially for Glee Club and the audition.  Somehow, he also got the football team to dance along. \n"}, {"text": "To congratulate Blaine on his expected casting in the school play, Kurt gives him which of these?", "correct": "Flowers", "options": ["A kiss", "A medal", "A bowtie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlowers.\n\n\tCoach Bieste speaks to Shelby in the teacher's lounge about her new Glee Club and she seems disappointed that no one is signing up.  She leaves as Will comes in to talk to her about Emma.  Bieste suggests that he's everything an in-law would hope for and that he should introduce himself to her parents to get the ball rolling.\rKurt finds Blaine and gives him a bouquet of flowers to congratulate him on what seems to be a shoe-in for the leading role in the school play.  Although the cast list isn't up until the end of the week, he seems sure enough.  Blaine is thrilled.\rAt booty camp, Brittany joins because she wants to dance into the voters' hearts.  Everyone cracks down on a difficult dance move and Mercedes feels like she's being singled out so she claims she doesn't need booty camp and decides to leave.  Will says that if she departs she's out of New Directions.  She and the others in booty camp perform \"It's All Over\" from \"Dreamgirls\". \n"}, {"text": "What did Mike's mother say was once her dream?", "correct": "To dance", "options": ["To sing", "To write novels", "To paint"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo dance.\n\n\tMike continues to practice in the dance studio until he sees his mom in the doorway.  He lies about his dancing saying that he's practicing for football but she knows he's been skipping chemistry tutoring.  He says he doesn't want to be a surgeon or a lawyer; he wants to be an artist.  She says it's her job to encourage his dreams; she doesn't want him to give up on his dreams because she was forced by her parents to give up her own dream of being a dancer.  When he gets the role in the musical, they'll tell his father together.  He asks her to let him teach her to dance.\rIn the auditorium, Finn speaks to Rachel and Shane speaks to Mercedes, encouraging their respective girlfriends for their big Maria-off with everyone from Glee Club and the football team in the audience. \n"}, {"text": "Who wins the coin toss prior to the Maria-off?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Mercedes", "Neither; they choose the order by random draw", "Neither; they choose the order by Rock, Paper, Scissors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tEmma takes the stage and asks the girls to call a coin toss; Rachel wins and she has Mercedes go first to perform \"Out Here On My Own\".  Everyone in the audience is excited by this number (Puck calls it 'a clash of the titans' and Kurt says they'll all discuss it for the rest of their lives).  Although both girls do a wonderful job, Rachel tells Finn backstage that Mercedes clearly did a better job.  After the performance, Rachel heads to Coach Bieste's office for an important meeting.\rEmma heads home after school to find Will setting up candles for a fancy dinner.  Initially she's excited, but when she realizes that he invited her parents for dinner, she gets very nervous.  She pours herself some wine and thinks of excuses to get them to leave, but Will assures her it'll be alright. \n"}, {"text": "Who decides to run for senior class president against Kurt and Brittany?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Mike", "Finn", "Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tEmma explains that her parents are 'Ginger Supremacists' but they prefer to be called 'Ginger Preservationists' as they only prefer the company of other redheads.  They begin to talk about Will's family heritage and the possibility of redheaded genes in his lineage but it's clear that Emma is uncomfortable.  Her mother claims that \"freaky-deaky is coming down with a case of the cleanies\" and it's obvious that her OCD is a result of her parents' influence in her life.  Will tells Emma's parents that they're a bit racist and if he and Emma did have a child they wouldn't care what colour hair it had.\rAt school, Kurt finds Rachel at her locker and confronts her about the gossip going around the school: she's planning to run for presidency.  She says she needs to run for presidency for her NYADA application since Mercedes will likely get the Maria role.  Kurt is disappointed in her and feels as though she's casting him aside.  He vows to win regardless. \n"}, {"text": "Who does not appear on the cast list for \"West Side Story\"?", "correct": "Puck", "options": ["Blaine", "Mike", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuck.\n\n\tThe co-directors ultimately give the Maria role to both Rachel and Mercedes and state that they're both too good to choose one.  In addition, they'll each perform a week of shows so that it's completely fair.  The double-casting disappoints Mercedes who backs out, even after Rachel graciously congratulates her.  Mercedes says that she doesn't want it because this is her senior year and she doesn't want it to be 'The Rachel Berry Show'.  Rachel thanks Finn for his support and he asks if she's still running for presidency.  She says she is because she wants to make a change after being inspired by Brittany's song.  Finn is clearly worried about this - he's cut between Kurt and Rachel.\rAt the apartment, Emma has problems keeping her disorder under control and Will prays by her at their bedside.  He begins to sing Coldplay's \"Fix You\" because he wants to make things better for her.\rThe cast list for \"West Side Story\" is posted.  Rachel gets the Maria role, Blaine is Tony.  Kurt gets the Officer Krupke role while Mike takes Riff and Santana is Anita.\rMercedes visits Shelby Corcoran's classroom and asks to become a member of her new Glee Club. \n"}]}
