{"id": "278634", "name": "\"Sly 2\" - \"The Predator Awakes\" (PS2) Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Sly Cooper Games", "Sly 2: Band of Thieves"], "questions": [{"text": "Where is the vault located?", "correct": "Rajan's office", "options": ["Behind a waterfall", "On a treetop", "Neyla's secret room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRajan's office.\n\n\tYou first enter Rajan's office when you bug his office.  Don't worry about getting it now.  You need to get the bug in the water if it is on your back and you won't have time to open the vault.  You can always come back to it later. \n"}, {"text": "How many spice plants do you collect from the treetops?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Four", "Three", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tThe six spice plants you collect are illegal to grow, but Rajan grows them anyway.  They are very powerful and if one eats too much, he goes in a craze.  Sly finds six spice plants and puts them in the elephant's feeding bag.  This sends the elephant in a wild rampage and he destroys the satellite so Rajan can't listen in on everything Sly and the gang say. \n"}, {"text": "What do you bug Rajan's office with?", "correct": "Indian Water Bug", "options": ["Indian Water Fly", "Indian Water Beetle", "You don't, you use a painting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndian Water Bug.\n\n\tBentley never calls it a beetle or fly, just bug.  The Indian Water Beetle and Indian Water Fly do not exist.  The painting is used to bug Dimitri's office earlier in the game. \n"}, {"text": "How many pools must you use on your way to bug Rajan's office?", "correct": "Nine", "options": ["Eight", "Ten", "Seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine.\n\n\tThere are a total of nine pools, counting the one in Rajan's office and also the one you start with.  The bug gets unhappy when left out of a pool for too long, which can attract guards if you are not careful.  Make sure you never lose your bug or your life or you will have to start over from the beginning. \n"}, {"text": "What is the vault combination code?", "correct": "386", "options": ["836", "863", "368"], "explanation": "\n\n\n386.\n\n\tThis combination will get you another cool item.  With it you are able to electrify your cane.  Doing so will give you the chance to kill an enemy with one whack. \n"}, {"text": "When you first enter the level, how many elephants are there?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Three", "One", "Too many to count"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tThere are only two elephants in this level.  The first can be seen with a tent on his back with two flashlights.  If you get in the lights the elephant will trumpet and an enemy will come out of the tent, so watch out.  The second one is attached to the satellite.  Once you destroy the satellite, that elephant disappears. \n"}, {"text": "When you are on your way to take recon photos, you may notice something floating in the water below you.  What is floating in the water?", "correct": "Spice plant", "options": ["Elephant bones", "Lily pads", "Nothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpice plant.\n\n\tThere were giant things that moved the water around so the spice plants were in motion.  There are buckets that pick up water and drop it through the filter so a pile of spice is all that is left. \n"}, {"text": "How many times do you whack the ruby to remove it?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Five", "One", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tYou must whack the ruby off with four hits, and sell it for a Cherry Bomb 500.  The Cherry bomb 500 will help you in a later mission. \n"}, {"text": "When bringing the ruby to the rendezvous point, what do you throw the ruby on?", "correct": "Cushions", "options": ["Pillows", "Tarps", "Trampolines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCushions.\n\n\tEven though the cushion looks like a trampoline or a tarp, it is a cushion.  The cushions look like the Sly head symbol.  Make sure you don't throw the ruby before Bentley has the cushion set up, or you will break it.  Make sure also to not get caught by guards, as they can break the gem, too. \n"}, {"text": "When you are leaving this level as it floods, how many waterfalls were visible?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Three", "One", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tThe level begins with three waterfalls.  One you go behind so you can get in to take recon photos.  The other is on the opposite side and you can get pretty close to it.  One is quite a ways in the distance.  When you bomb the dam, you create another waterfall.  This gives you a total of four waterfalls at the end of the level. \n"}]}
