{"id": "247259", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Consultant' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Radar is given the responsibility of driving Hawkeye and Trapper to the helipad, where they are set to take off for a medical conference in Tokyo.  An annoyed Henry is displeased with the quality of Radar's driving, and asks the young man where he learned to handle a vehicle.  What is Radar's response?", "correct": "The bumper cars", "options": ["The demolition derby", "The tractor at his family farm", "The drag races"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bumper cars.\n\n\tYet more amusing is the fact that Radar leaves Henry at both his office and at the helipad after dropping Trapper and Hawkeye off.  Both times, Henry orders Radar to certain locations (the Swamp and back to camp), but the assumption is that Henry would be in the jeep *before* Radar drives off! \n"}, {"text": "In Tokyo, Trapper and Hawkeye enjoy a brief respite from their drinking and debauchery in an officer's club, where they, well, drink and debauch.  They also meet Dr. Borelli for the first time here.  What accomplished actor plays this distinguished doctor?", "correct": "Robert Alda", "options": ["James Mason", "Ed Binns", "Stuart Margolin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Alda.\n\n\tDr. Anthony Borelli is played by none other than actor Alphonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo, aka Robert Alda.  He had a son that you may have heard of, namely Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo, aka Alan Alda!  Alan Alda also had a brother named Anthony who appeared in an episode of 'M*A*S*H', namely 'Lend a Hand' from season eight, which included Dr. Borelli's second and final appearance on the show. \n"}, {"text": "In the process of asking Dr. Borelli if he'd like to come visit the 'M*A*S*H' 4077th, Hawkeye also asks if Borelli has ever previously visited the war-torn country.  Has Borelli ever been to Korea?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tTrapper has a lot of nice things to say about Korea.  A partial list of things that can be found in abundance there: trauma surgery, wholesale amputations, typhus, filariasis, encephalitis, typhoid, paratyphoid and cholera.  Sounds like a lovely vacation spot! \n"}, {"text": "Which previous war(s) has Dr. Borelli been involved in some capacity?", "correct": "Both World War I and II", "options": ["Just World War II", "Just World War I", "The Spanish Civil War"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoth World War I and II.\n\n\tBorelli has been through not one, but two world wars.  Now, he claims to be just a civilian.  His rank of major that he wears on his uniform is purely honorary. \n"}, {"text": "After Hawkeye and Trapper return from the medical conference, an angry Frank complains to Henry that neither doctor attended any of the lectures in Tokyo.  Instead, they have been attended to by all but which kind of girls, according to Ferret Face?", "correct": "Ice cream stand girls", "options": ["Girl golf caddies", "Geisha girls", "Bargirls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce cream stand girls.\n\n\tHenry is less concerned about Frank and more concerned about the pool in which he is luxuriating.  When he learns of Frank's accusations his smiling response is: 'I ought to have them whipped, although they probably are.'  When Trapper and Hawkeye arrive, Frank makes known his protestations.  Hawkeye responds, 'We got sick and had to have round the clock nurses.' \n"}, {"text": "Unexpectedly, Dr. Borelli arrives at the 4077th by chopper.  Does Dr. Borelli decide to stay in the V.I.P. tent?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIndeed, not.  Dr. Borelli wants to 'get into the game', and thus he needs to be as close to the action as possible.  Hence, he rooms with the other doctors in the smelly Swamp.  Not long after his arrival, new wounded arrive.  It seems the 'game' has started more quickly than he had planned! \n"}, {"text": "In the O.R., Dr. Borelli observes the doctors in action.  Which doctor is about to amputate a patient's leg, only to be stopped by Dr. Borelli who suggests that an arterial transplant could be performed?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Henry", "Trapper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tDr. Borelli claims that a new section of artery can be transplanted in the leg, thus making it unnecessary to amputate.  'What you're saying is new to us,' claims an interested Henry.  All of the doctors are excited and intrigued by the prospect that they can save the limbs of more patients.  It's agreed that surgery on the patient will be postponed until an artery graft can be found. \n"}, {"text": "In order to retrieve the segment of artery that will be necessary for the arterial transplant, Hawkeye and Trapper have to drive a few hours to another military unit.  What nationality are the men at this unit?", "correct": "British", "options": ["Italian", "French", "Greek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBritish.\n\n\tThe British commander seems 'quite' intrigued and amused by the ghastly proposal of a segment of artery.  While signing the required paperwork to release the arterial graft, he comments, 'A British artery in an American leg.  He'll probably develop an irresistable urge to drive on the left side of the road.' \n"}, {"text": "After Hawkeye and Trapper begin, everyone prepares for surgery, everyone, that is, except Dr. Borelli.  It seems that he has spent the last several hours getting himself soused, and he's in no shape to operate.  Hawkeye and Trapper are forced to perform the arterial graft, with Borelli advising.  Afterwards, Hawkeye is very upset, and refuses to acknowledge Borelli's attempts at peacemaking.  This prompts Borelli to comment that Hawkeye has a great many gifts, but not which of the following?", "correct": "Compassion", "options": ["Truth", "Joviality", "Modesty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCompassion.\n\n\tEveryone at the camp is extremely pleased with the outcome of the operation, except, it seems, Hawkeye.  He is so upset about Borelli's lack of responsibility that he can't seem to enjoy his triumph.  Borelli's attempts to congratulate Hawkeye and Trapper are only met with silence from Hawkeye's end. \n"}, {"text": "Borelli attempts to explain to Hawkeye that he simply hadn't anticipated his own extremely nervous reaction to arriving at the 4077th.  In painting a picture of his current state, which of these is not part of Borelli's 'three sure signs of age'?", "correct": "Forgetfulness", "options": ["A bit of a spread", "Feet of clay", "Gray hair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForgetfulness.\n\n\tEncountering a wave of wounded and the incessant nearby bombing drove Borelli to drink.  Borelli adds that during World War I he never drank, and during World War II, only after surgery.  Noticing Hawkeye drinking away at the still, he makes the pointed comment: 'Doctor, I wish you luck on your third war'.  Hawkeye seems affected by Borelli's words, as he tips his hat as Borelli takes off in a chopper.\r I hope you enjoyed this quiz, thank you for playing! \n"}]}
