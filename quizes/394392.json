In this one, her younger sister died while trying to join in a game of hide-and-seek, and though many were there to witness her accidental death, they made a pact not to tell anyone of their involvement. Ultimately, this resulted in a string of deaths on prom night in the movie.  The film saw a remake in 2008 and several sequels over the years, but Jamie Lee Curtis won a Genie Award for her role in the original. \n"}, {"text": "Jamie Lee Curtis was an aerobics instructor in Los Angeles in what 1985 film also starring John Travolta?", "correct": "Perfect", "options": ["Dominick and Eugene", "Love Letters", "Blue Steel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPerfect.\n\n\tThis film was an interesting one.  Hot off the successes of \"Staying Alive\" and \"Blow Out\" in the early '80s, this Travolta was considered so bad that Travolta didn't return to films for most of the decade, only coming back for \"Look Who's Talking\" in 1989.  Jamie Lee Curtis seemed to come out unscathed though. Despite the film receiving three Razzie nominations (none for Curtis), and flopping in the box office, it has been remembered for its extensive workout scenes featuring both Curtis and Travolta performing aerobics routines in a group setting.  Curtis played instructor Jessie Wilson while Travolta played a \"Rolling Stone\" writer seeking information about Los Angeles' burgeoning exercise industry. Love may have ensued. \n"}, {"text": "Although she pretended to be Kevin Kline's sibling in this 1989 comedy, Jamie Lee Curtis was actually a con woman in what film?", "correct": "A Fish Called Wanda", "options": ["Fierce Creatures", "Queens Logic", "House Arrest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Fish Called Wanda.\n\n\tThis movie, also starring John Cleese and Michael Palin, ended up scoring Kevin Kline a Best Supporting Actor Oscar win for his role as Otto West.

Ultimately, Jamie Lee Curtis' Wanda (also the name of a fish in the movie) ended up trying to use a barrister played by John Cleese to find a way to claim the diamonds for herself.  They ended up having affair in the mix of things, despite her fake-brother Otto clearly having a stake.
