The world's largest cashew tree is over 7,000 square feet.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tBelieve it; it's true.  A cashew tree is a relatively small tree, but the Maior Cajuiero do Mundo is the world's largest cashew tree.  It covers roughly 7,500 square feet (8400 sq. km.), which is roughly the size of 75 regular sized cashew trees.  The tree is estimated to be over 1,000 years old, and its sheer size can produce 60,000 fruit with cashews a year.\r Cashew trees are unique because the weight of the branches make the tree lean towards the ground, but then the branches take root into the ground where it is bent to the ground.  This is what allowed the Maior Cajuiero do Mundo to grow so massive. \n"}, {"text": "True or false?

The answer to this question is false.", "correct": "Neither answer would work", "options": ["Both answers would work", "True", "False"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeither answer would work.\n\n\tThis question creates a paradox because neither answer would be correct.  If the statement were true, that would be implying that the answer would be marked as false.  This would then state that the statement is false, but since the statement says the answer is false, answering false would make the statement true.\r Did I confuse you?  ;-) \n"}]}
