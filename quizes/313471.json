{"id": "313471", "name": "Hardest Survival of the Fittest Trivia Quiz | Biology | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Biology", "Evolution"], "questions": [{"text": "In regards to evolution, what, exactly, does \"fittest\" mean in \"survival of the fittest\"?", "correct": "The organism that produces the most surviving offspring", "options": ["The longest-lived organism", "The strongest organism", "The organism that is healthiest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe organism that produces the most surviving offspring.\n\n\tIn biologic terms, it doesn't matter how big, strong, or beautiful you are if you don't leave any offspring to carry on your genes. \n"}, {"text": "Did Darwin coin the phrase \"survival of the fittest\"?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIt was actually first used by another biologist, Herbert Spencer, in his 1864 book \"Principles of Biology.\" However, Spencer was a believer in Lamarckism- the idea that organisms passed on changes that they acquired during their lives to their offspring- so his idea of \"survival of the fittest\" was quite different from Darwin's. \n"}, {"text": "Evolution is properly defined as the change in the genetic makeup of a population over time. Natural selection is the principal agent of evolution. Which of the following is NOT also a source of change in genetic frequencies?", "correct": "Adaptation", "options": ["Migration", "Genetic drift", "All of these are sources"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdaptation.\n\n\t\"Genetic drift\" is the change in genomes caused by the randomness of sexual recombination. \"Migration\" is the addition of new genes into a population by immigrants.\r Adaptations are the products of natural selection; they are not in themselves sources of genetic variation. \n"}, {"text": "Natural selection acts upon variation in a population. Without such variation, there can be no selection and evolution cannot occur. What do biologists call variation that is caused by a change in a gene in a germ cell (reproductive cell) of an individual?", "correct": "Mutation", "options": ["Gene flow", "Allele", "Migration"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMutation.\n\n\tA mutation is an actual change in the genetic information of a cell. Mutations can be neutral (no effect), harmful, or beneficial. Only mutations that occur in germ cells (eggs, sperm, pollen) can actually be passed down to the next generation. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is most likely to be an example of natural selection?", "correct": "A prolonged cold spell wipes out most mice in a population, but some survive and multiply", "options": ["Hunters shoot the deer with the biggest antlers, so only smaller-antlered deer remain", "Fur farmers select only the mink with unusual coat colors for breeding", "Dog breeders select the most trainable individuals to breed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA prolonged cold spell wipes out most mice in a population, but some survive and multiply.\n\n\tThe three incorrect answers are all artificial selection - selection by humans for or against specific traits. This is how new breeds of plants and animals are developed. \n"}, {"text": "Natural selection always \"selects for\" traits that favor an individual's survival. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tRemember- natural selection selects for those traits that enhance the perpetuation of an individual's genome. The traits can sometimes be contrary to individual survival! The salmon that dies after spawning once, the peacock that risks predation and starvation to grow a magnificent tail, the ground squirrel that enhances kin survival by risking himself as a sentry- all act in ways contrary to individual survival but all help perpetuate their genes. \n"}, {"text": "There are three things that must be present for natural selection to occur. Which of the following is *not* one of them?", "correct": "Mutation", "options": ["Variation", "Differential reproduction", "Heredity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMutation.\n\n\tNatural selection in a nutshell:\rVARIATION in individuals leads to DIFFERENTIAL REPRODUCTION as some individuals are more fit to survive and reproduce than others. Those individuals pass these differences on to their offspring through HEREDITY. These offspring will VARY, and the cycle begins anew. \n"}, {"text": "Natural selection has a goal- to produce the most perfect organisms possible, balanced with their environments. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis is one of the most common misconceptions about natural selection. It is, as Richard Dawkins commented, a \"blind watchmaker,\" a mindless process that has no goals and no intents. Variation occurs, some variants have more offspring and pass their traits to those offspring. That is all. Yet such a process, without guidance or thought, produced the amazing assemblage of living things we see today. \n"}, {"text": "Natural selection is a random process.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis is another very common misconception. While variation by mutation and sexual recombination are random, natural selection is decidedly nonrandom. Those traits that promote genomic survival are selected for, those traits that impede genomic survival are selected against. \n"}, {"text": "One of Darwin's most memorable quotes is this one:\n\"There is grandeur in this view of life.. whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful...\"\n", "correct": "have been, and are being, evolved.", "options": ["appear, but we can never know why or how they appeared.", "are created from chaos and randomness.", "spring up without seeming reason or logic."], "explanation": "\n\n\nhave been, and are being, evolved.\n\n\tThere is nothing more awe-inspiring and wondrous than the enormous array of living things that evolution has produced on our planet. Darwin recognized it, and, 200 years after his birth, these words are just as true and powerful as they were when they were first written. \n"}]}
