The league was then known as the American Professional Football Association, but would later become known as the National Football League.  \r From his first entry into the league, Pollard would be a trailblazer throughout his playing and coaching career. He was one of only two African Americans in the league at the time when he helped the Pros win the first ever league championship, in 1920, with an 8-0-3 record. Then, in 1921, Pollard made history again by becoming the NFL's first African American head coach, when he was named co-coach alongside Elgie Tobin.  \r Pollard played for four different teams during his career and even experienced another head coaching opportunity when he was named the head man with the Hammond Pros in 1925, although that was for just a single game; unfortunately, the team lost. All totaled, Pollard's coaching career lasted only 13 games (8-4-1). He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, in 2005. It is very curious as to why he had to wait so long for such an honor. \n"}]}
