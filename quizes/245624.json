{"id": "245624", "name": "Top Movies of 2001 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "2000s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "A magnificent epic event, director Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy began in 2001 with 'The Fellowship of the Ring'.  Which of these actors did NOT play one of the hobbits in this majestic special effects extravaganza?", "correct": "Viggo Mortensen", "options": ["Ian Holm", "Sean Astin", "Elijah Wood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViggo Mortensen.\n\n\tTolkien's sweeping epic started off with a big-screen bang in 2001 with this first film by Peter Jackson.  Jackson filmed this movie and its two sequels entirely in his native New Zealand.  His triumph led to Oscar gold in 2003 when the third film 'The Return of the King' won him Best Director and Best Picture Oscars. \n"}, {"text": "2001 was a truly great year for films.  Complete the title of the following film musical that features John Cameron Mitchell as a transexual rocker from East Berlin: '________ and the Angry Inch'.", "correct": "Hedwig", "options": ["Bernice", "Priscilla", "Judith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHedwig.\n\n\t'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' is a brilliant cinematic escapade, replete with humor, interesting animations and, most importantly, a marvelous musical score.  John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask originally created 'Hedwig' as an off-broadway production that became such a cult favorite that a film was authorized.  Highly recommended! \n"}, {"text": "'Le Fabuleux destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain', or 'Am\u00e9lie' for short, is a film that cannot be described, it must simply be experienced.  Certainly French director's Jean-Pierre Jeunet masterpiece, this film also features a wonderful performance by what lead actress?", "correct": "Audrey Tautou", "options": ["Emmanuelle B\u00e9art", "Corinne Calvet", "Yvette Guilbert"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAudrey Tautou.\n\n\tNominated for five Oscars, it didn't win any, but it certainly won the hearts of many a filmgoer.  'Am\u00e9lie' is a rare example of a foreign language film that has been widely accepted by the English-speaking audience.  Keep an eye out for several clips of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's classic film 'Jules et Jim' in this movie! \n"}, {"text": "Another foreign language film that caught the attention of the American mainstream, this is an animated masterpiece by Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki featuring the story of a little girl who is separated from her parents (who have been transformed into pigs) in a strange fantasy ghost world.  Its title?", "correct": "Spirited Away", "options": ["Kiki's Delivery Service", "My Neighbor Totoro", "Warriors of the Wind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpirited Away.\n\n\t'Spirited Away' is certainly one of the most imaginative animated films ever made.  If you enjoy Hayao Miyazaki's work with this film, he has a number of others that might also tickle your fancy, for example 'My Neighbor Totoro', 'Princess Mononoke' and 'Howl's Moving Castle'.  I recommend them all. \n"}, {"text": "What quirky director returned with his third feature-length film in 2001, namely the quaint, beautifully filmed 'The Royal Tenenbaums'?", "correct": "Wes Anderson", "options": ["Terrence Malick", "Darren Aronofsky", "Christopher Nolan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWes Anderson.\n\n\tTo understand Wes Anderson, one must first accept the absurdist nature of his characters and stories.  In addition, one must have a taste for black comedy.  In 'The Royal Tenenbaums', an extremely eccentric family, replete with child prodigies, is torn apart and then brought together again by Royal, the irresponsible father played by Gene Hackman.  Ben Stiller, Owen and Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny Glover, Bill Murray and Angelica Houston also star. \n"}, {"text": "Let me repeat, 2001 was really an incredible year in the cinema.  Who can forget this movie, for example, that starred Guy Pearce as a man crippled by a short-term memory disorder who is in relentless pursuit of his wife's killer?  \n\nWhat is the name of this cinematic gem?", "correct": "Memento", "options": ["Dementia", "Evanescence", "Recollection"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMemento.\n\n\tThe very talented Christopher Nolan directed this, only his second film, in 2001.  Since then, he has directed the thriller 'Insomnia' and the action-packed 'Batman Begins', among others.  Appearing alongside Pearce in the mind-boggling 'Memento' are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, both of whom also starred in 'The Matrix'.  \r Warning: 'Memento' is definitely a film you will have to see several times! \n"}, {"text": "Known for his wonderfully filmed sci-fi and action thrillers, what director submitted the powerful war epic 'Blackhawk Down' in 2001?", "correct": "Ridley Scott", "options": ["James Cameron", "Oliver Stone", "John McTiernan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRidley Scott.\n\n\t'Blackhawk Down' is not for the weak of stomach.  The gut-wrenching story tells of the failed U.S. mission into Somalia in the early 1990s, and in particular the Battle of Mogadishu.  Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor and Sam Shepard are just some of the great actors who make an appearance in this film.  Ridley Scott's filmmaking here is tremendous. \n"}, {"text": "Yet another animated feature for this 2001 list, this time it's the charming 'Monsters Inc.'.  My personal favorite among the Pixar-produced animated films, it features what pair of actors as the voices for the characters Mike Wazowski and James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan, respectively? ", "correct": "Billy Crystal and John Goodman", "options": ["Robin Williams and Willen Dafoe", "Matt Damon and Tom Hanks", "Al Pacino and Tim Allen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly Crystal and John Goodman.\n\n\tSet in the fictional city of Monstropolis, 'Monsters Inc.' has just the right balance of comedy and drama, without too much smarmy sap!  Crystal and Goodman have perfect chemistry together as the two lead monsters, and Mary Gibbs, who voiced the part of the little girl 'Boo', was actually only 3-years old at the time! \n"}, {"text": "Another non-English language entry in our countdown, this wonderful film was brought to you by Walter Salles, the same director responsible for 'Central Station' and 'The Motorcycle Diaries'.  Entitled 'Abril Despeda\u00e7ado' (English title: 'Behind the Sun'), in what language was this marvelous coming-of-age movie filmed?", "correct": "Portuguese", "options": ["French", "Hebrew", "Mayan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortuguese.\n\n\tThe story revolves around a family locked in a revenge struggle against another, neighboring family.  Each family dispatches its sons to kill the male offspring of the other.  Rodrigo Santoro is marvelous in the lead role as Tonho, a young man who questions the violent traditions of his family.  See it if you can! \n"}, {"text": "To wrap things up, here's a strange but extremely enticing entry.  'Mulholland Drive', a beautiful film that has an almost indescribable plot, certainly deserves a place on this list.  What director, known for his perplexing films, created this 2001 gem?", "correct": "David Lynch", "options": ["John Waters", "Paul Thomas Anderson", "David O. Russell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Lynch.\n\n\tTo this day, I don't claim to fully understand the plot of 'Mulholland Drive', but this does not stop me from enjoying it every time I see it.  A psychological thriller from end to end, it also features an entrancing performance by Naomi Watts.  If anyone has the plot of this film fully figured out, please alert me!\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it.  Feel free to let me know if I've left anything out.  This was a tough year, I felt bad about leaving out such films as 'Blow', 'Sexy Beast', 'In the Bedroom', 'K-PAX' and 'Donnie Darko', but them's the breaks when you create a 10-question quiz! \n"}]}
