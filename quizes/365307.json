One boy in particular, a possible suitor of her eldest daughter, Borquita, was invited to feel around in bowls of disgusting entrails (pulled from her slaves, no less).  That night, her daughters conspired to kill her to prevent her from inflicting any more harm on them or the slaves.  Unfortunately for them, however, she overheard from the hallway and, that night, had the girls dragged to the attic to be caged and tortured.\rOn Halloween night in 2013, Delphine opens the door of the academy to find her daughters, dead, standing in the doorway.

Fiona asks to see her wounds and Cordelia moves her hands aside to show a face scarred by acid.  The doctor at the hospital informs Fiona that they burned through the optic nerves.  While her eyes are still intact, Cordelia is now blind.\rBack at the academy, the girls look outside the window to see the army descending upon the front lawn.  Zoe has the girls back up from the windows, close the drapes, and turn out the lights.  Luke says that it all has to be a prank and he heads outside to ward them off.

When one takes notice of some boys coming in from the street, they're attacked in a bloody manner, losing their limbs in a single moment of awakening.  Luke is also harmed-- one of the soldiers hits him with a scythe to the back.  Nan witnesses the strike and leaves to help while Delphine distracts Zoe, saying that her daughters must be after her.  Zoe tries to send the rest upstairs to Spalding's room but he refuses to let them in.\rNan and Luke make it out to the car in the driveway to an at-least-temporary safety. \n"}, {"text": "Fiona has the power to bring the dead back to life.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tFiona, distraught and out of meds, wanders the flickering hallways of the hospital while Cordelia sleeps inside.

She sees the hooded figure walking through the halls and tries to follow. She ends up instead finding a woman screaming in her room.  This woman, who gave birth mere hours before, had a stillborn child.  Fiona insists that the mother hold the child since she has to keep her close and make her feel safe.  Although the woman weeps over the tragedy, Fiona uses her powers to mysteriously bring the baby girl back to life. \n"}, {"text": "With what is Borquita's attack finally put to an end?", "correct": "A fire poker", "options": ["A chainsaw", "A candlestick", "A pair of scissors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA fire poker.\n\n\tAs the zombies break into the car containing Nan and Luke, Zoe emerges from the house to distract the undead.  They chase her across the grounds, giving the others enough time to flee.  She ends up hiding in an old storage cellar.\rInside the house, Delphine sends Queenie up to bed to rest while she goes to the kitchen to get drinks.  In a moment of weakness she sees Borquita at the window and lets her daughter in, apologizing for what she's done.  She promises to make amends, but Borquita attacks, her strangling her and lifting her off the ground.\rUpstairs, Queenie sends Spalding to check on Delphine but he's promptly knocked out as soon as he leaves the room.  Queenie gets up to find Borquita attacking him with a candlestick.  Borquita sets her sights on the witch who, in desperation, tries to save herself with her magic.  It isn't until Delphine arrives at the last moment to impale her daughter on a firepoker that Borquita is put to an end. \n"}, {"text": "With which of these does Zoe fight the zombies attacking the academy?", "correct": "Chainsaw", "options": ["Machete", "Fire", "Samurai sword"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChainsaw.\n\n\tNan and Luke take the opportunity to rush back towards the house but they're seen and pursued by the zombies soon after leaving their vehicle.  Luckily for them, Zoe's already armed herself with a chainsaw.  She ends up hacking through several undead attackers and gives them the chance to escape.  When the chainsaw dies, however, it comes down to her innate powers.  Placing a hand in front and muttering an incantation, she defeats a zombie with such force that she knocks Marie Laveau out of her levitation. \n"}, {"text": "Who awakens Cordelia's divination powers?", "correct": "Hank", "options": ["Zoe", "Fiona", "Misty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHank.\n\n\tHank arrives back in New Orleans to visit Cordelia in the hospital but, while she's asleep in bed, Fiona gives him a verbal lashing resulting in an all-out argument.  He's taken aback when he discovers that she's permanently blind and, soon, a nurse tells them that one of them will have to leave.  Fiona gives him no more than fifteen minutes.  When she leaves, he leans in to hold her hand.  Doing so, however, triggers a dormant power-- she's able to read his mind and see his recent infidelities.  This is enough to rouse her from her sleep in shock.\rThe next day at the Robichaux Academy, the girls burn the bodies of the undead remaining on the lawn.  Fiona thanks Zoe for her great service to the coven; Luke is forced to stay in the academy until he's better. \n"}, {"text": "The Council, upon returning to the academy, demands which of the following?", "correct": "That Fiona step down", "options": ["That Cordelia sell the building", "That they attack the voodoo witches", "That a full-scale witch hunt commence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat Fiona step down.\n\n\tThe Council arrives after the bonfire to criticize her leadership, after all, they've been attacked by the voodoo witches, Cordelia has been blinded, one witch is still missing, and more.  They say that they've decided for her to abdicate the title of Supreme; the coven will fall into the care of the Council in the meantime, and Myrtle will lead. Fiona vows that she will not get away with it and steps up to her to accuse her of treachery-- she saw her at the hospital and she burned Cordelia's eyes.  Fiona also notes the coincidence that Madison went missing upon her arrival in the city; she must have planned the coup. \n"}, {"text": "Who is burned at the stake in this episode?", "correct": "Myrtle & Myrtle Snow", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMyrtle & Myrtle Snow.\n\n\tAfter the accusations fly, Fiona tears a glove from Myrtle's hand to reveal chemical burns.  There's no need to argue anymore; the others vote to burn her at the stake.  Myrtle claims that she's been an outcast her whole life and thought the academy was her home, but she will not fight the decision.  The same day the Council, Fiona, and the girls of the coven depart from the city and tie Myrtle to the stake. She's doused with gas before she's told to give her final words.  To this she responds Fiona is leading them to their deaths and she'd rather burn.  Fiona throws her cigarette at her and she is immolated. \n"}, {"text": "What happens when Spalding tries to move Madison's body?", "correct": "Her arm comes off", "options": ["Bugs emerge from the corpse", "She speaks to him", "She sets on fire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer arm comes off.\n\n\tBack at the academy, Queenie speaks to Fiona about the execution and their involvement in the framing.  It turned out that Fiona had Queenie dip her hand in the acid, using her powers to leave the burns and give her reason to go to the stake.  Queenie only did it to repay the favour with the minotaur.  Fiona puts Queenie at ease by making her believe that she is definitely the next Supreme.\rUpstairs, Spalding sprays his attic room with air freshener to cover up the smell of Madison's decaying corpse, now hidden in an old chest.  When he tries to lift her out, he ends up pulling her arm off, much to his shock.\rOut at the stake in the quarry, Misty Day finds the charred body of Myrtle Snow and, with a gentle touch, brings her back to life. \n"}]}
