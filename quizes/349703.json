In 2005, the quote was rated as the fourth most famous of all time. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Toy Story\", Slinky loves to play checkers with Woody. Perhaps he doesn't like to play with Buzz because Buzz thinks he is all that. He could have said \"Never play a game of checkers against a Lightyear. Not when pride is on the line!\"\n\nThis line is a spoof from which of these films?", "correct": "Princess Bride", "options": ["Princess Protection Program", "Princess Diaries", "Frog Princess"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincess Bride.\n\n\t\"Never play a game of wits against a Sicilian.

He could have said \"Buzz phoning home base.\"\n\nOf course, this made-up quote is a spoof of one far more known. E.T. is well-loved by many, and says a quote similar many times.

The movie was about a cute little alien (though he actually frightens me) who gets stuck on earth. He is always wanting to contact his family, which is why he wants to phone home. Pat Welsh had her raspy voice because she was a chain smoker. \n"}, {"text": "\"Life is like an alien claw machine. You never know which one you're gonna get.\" Buzz and Woody manage to get stuck in a claw machine at Pizza Planet. Sid, the evil neighbor kid, played the claw game, expecting to win an alien. He won Buzz and Woody instead. He certainly didn't know he was gonna get that!\n\nThat was not the original quote; it was a spoof.

Actually, the entire movie is a backstory. We watch what really happened as Forrest tells this woman of his life. \n"}, {"text": "When introducing himself to the other toys, Buzz mentioned he was a spaceman.

The line is spoken in a spaceship when Barf was asked who he was, and what.\r \"Spaceballs\" is a spoof of \"Star Wars\", and Barfolomew (yep, Barf is his shortened name) is a spoof of Chewbacca. That's right, I spoofed a spoof. \n"}, {"text": "\"They have big heads, and little arms!\" When Buzz first meets the three-eyed aliens, he could have said this to describe them.\n\nThis line is a spoof of a line said by a dinosaur minion. Which animated movie contains the real quote?", "correct": "Meet the Robinsons", "options": ["Megamind", "Despicable Me", "The Incredibles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeet the Robinsons.\n\n\t\"I have a big head, and little arms.

Play 'You've Got a Friend in Me'.\" This song was played a lot in \"Toy Story\", and Buzz could have asked Woody to play it again.\n\nWait, that's not a real quote. It is just a spoof of a classic line from the 1940s. What song is mentioned in the original quote?", "correct": "As Time Goes By", "options": ["Whistle While You Work", "What a Wonderful World", "As the Stars Go Blue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs Time Goes By.\n\n\t\"Play it, Sam.

Ilsa asked him to play the song for old times sake.\r \"Casablanca\" (1942). \n"}, {"text": "\"Reach for the sky and beyond!\" Instead of saying his usual \"to infinity and beyond\", Buzz could have said this.\n\nHold up, have I just spoofed \"Toy Story\" with more \"Toy Story\"? Indeed I have. Who originally said \"reach for the sky\"?", "correct": "Woody", "options": ["Jessie", "Hamm", "Slinky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWoody.\n\n\t\"Reach for the sky!\" Woody has a pull string on his back, and this is just one of the many lines he uttered when the string is pulled. The string provides entertainment for Andy, but not so much for Woody when the string gets caught and wakes up a dog. \"Toy Story\" was released in 1995. \n"}]}
