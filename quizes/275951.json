The time has come for another job interview.  You assumed that it would be time to take a change from your boring, menial job, but after realizing that demand is no longer what it used to be for over-the-top, risky occupations, you're back to fight for a paper-clip-counting desk job at a new office.\n\nBefore you go in for your interview, you recall your earlier plans to use carabiners on buttresses.  What type of job could you have wanted with that idea in your head?", "correct": "Rock Climbing Instructor", "options": ["High-Rise Window Washer", "Proctologist", "Skydiver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRock Climbing Instructor.\n\n\tI certainly hope you didn't want to use a carabiner in a proctology appointment, but it's quite clear that that sort of equipment is better used climbing rock walls, cliffs, and buttresses on a rock face.  As well, rock climbing certainly wouldn't require paper-clip-counting, but instead, precise movements, agility, and dexterity (as well as a lack of vertigo).\rI imagine that you opted for this alternate career because it allows you to be physically active.  As well, odds are, you'll be traveling to unique settings like the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, or the Andes, or you'll be leading amateur climbers up the side of a rock wall in the Appalachians.\rIt can't be refreshing thinking about the risk though.  One slip could be fatal.  Before you could say 'AVALANCHE', you hustled to the commercial district and lined up for a job. \n"}, {"text": "The interviewer steps outside the office and calls your name.  Quickly, you rise from your seat and shake her hand, saying it's nice to meet her.  She has you come into her office and you hold the door for her (to make a good impression, of course).\nAs she walks behind her desk, she asks you to take a seat in the 'vermilion' chair.  You twinge for a moment as you realize that there are three different coloured chairs in front of the desk.  Which one do you sit in?", "correct": "The red one", "options": ["The blue one", "The green one", "None of these; you decide to take her seat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe red one.\n\n\tWhen you sit down, you remember, that vermilion is a shade of red (and a quite obscure one at that).  Of course, not many recognize vermilion as well as other shades of red because its pigment is a mercury compound, and is therefore toxic.  Secretly, you hope that your chair is safe to sit in.\rAs well, you note that real vermilion would probably be too expensive to use in the chair, as you need to create a compound with mercury and sulfur to make it.\r Perhaps you heard this when you were playing \"Pokemon\" in your time off.  Video game players may remember this as the third gym town in \"Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow\", from the first generation of games...but you would never admit to that in a job interview. \n"}, {"text": "After you sit down, the interviewer says that you'll begin by telling her about yourself.  You decide to go into your hobbies, and then you decide to tell her that you once lived next door to 'that figure skater who got silver in the Nagano Olympics'.  The interviewer is surprised, asking if you are referring to Tara Lipinski.  Who were you really referring to?", "correct": "Michelle Kwan", "options": ["Sarah Hughes", "Kristi Yamaguchi", "Oksana Baiul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichelle Kwan.\n\n\tMichelle Kwan did win silver in Nagano, and shortly after this, continued to win numerous World Championships.  She won bronze in the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, then pulled herself out of the Turin, Italy Olympics in 2006 due to a hip injury, though she was scheduled to appear.  Kwan won seven of seven World Championships between 1998 and 2005.\rHer second place finish in Nagano allowed youngster Tara Lipinski (only 15 at the time) to claim the gold medal, making her the youngest Olympic gold medalist to date.\r This unique comment is written down by your interviewer, despite the fact that it's obviously not going to impact your job performance.  You try to recall the various Michelle Kwan anecdotes you'll need to talk about if you get the job. \n"}, {"text": "Next, the interviewer asks if you have had any previous job experience, to which you reply: yes.  You can never forget the past eight years of office work, no matter how dull.  You also make note of the fact that you know BASIC.  She says it's not required, but it's nice to know.\n\nWhat is BASIC?", "correct": "A Computer Programming Language", "options": ["A Universal Filing System", "A World-Famous Motivational Speaker", "A Contract Procedure used by Law Firms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Computer Programming Language.\n\n\tBASIC, you recall, is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, and despite the fact that it is used for very little in computing nowadays, it is still possible to create applications and perform certain tasks.  Microsoft has also released \"Visual BASIC\" programs to assist in this.  One with logic can probably make sense of the inputs and commands used by the language, but to the untrained eye, it's hard to make sense of it all.\r Over the years, BASIC has become somewhat defunct as it has been replaced by PERL, JAVA, C++, HTML, Python, and other seemingly easier-to-follow languages.  Odds are, your skill is not required for the job...unless it's 1970. \n"}, {"text": "\"Where do you see yourself in two years?\" the interviewer asks.  You'd hate to tell her your real feelings, but you say that you see yourself advancing through the ranks.  Goals are important to you.\n\nIt's then that you think of the Dakar Rally... probably not the best thing to put in your mind at the time.  Has Dakar ever actually been the finish line for the rally?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tDakar, Senegal is located on the western coast of Africa.  Although Dakar is not always the finish race of the world-famous Dakar Rally, it is the majority of the time.  In the first twenty-five years of the race, all but four races have ended in Dakar.\rIn the rally, racers can use two-wheeled vehicles (motorcycles) as well as cars and trucks.  Often times, due to the fact that the rally is so trying and difficult, major car companies will promote themselves if they are successful in the race.\rThe race is very dangerous though, and many have been killed both during the course, and covering the course for a media circuit.  Although the majority of races have started in France, races have also begun in Lisbon, Portugal. \n"}, {"text": "\"For your job,\" she says, \"you'll be required to do a fair bit of running around, usually for other people... copies, appointments, getting lunch.  Would you be opposed to this?\"\nYou say that it's fine.  You really want to promote teamwork and build strong, reliable bonds with other members of the staff.  She seems pleased by your answer.\n\nYou can't help but think however, of \"Pac-Man\", what with the running around and eating objects.  Of course, Pac-Man did it for personal gain; you just want the job.  You remember and ponder the question: How many dots does Pac-Man need to eat in order to advance to the next stage of the game?", "correct": "All of them", "options": ["None of them", "Seven-eighths of them", "Three quarters of them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of them.\n\n\tIf only you had spent less time in the arcades and more time doing your homework.  This clearly isn't the best time to be thinking about video games.  Regardless, you can easily remember \"Pac-Man\", which is regarded as one of the single most-popular video games of all time.  Using a joystick, players can guide Pac-Man through a maze filled with delicious dots and fruits. While fruits are solely used to add to the overall score of the game, dots allow Pac-Man to advance through the game.  As well, impeding the poor Pac-Man are the four ghosts of Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde (also known as Bashful, Speedy, Shadow, and Pokey, respectively).  If one of these catches Pac-Man, he disintegrates into nothingness, but if Pac-Man is powered up and happens to eat a ghost, it must return to its home and restart its reign through the maze. Eating all of the dots will result in advancement.  There's no way around it. \n"}, {"text": "\"What are your hours of availability?\" she asks.  Quickly, you say that you're available anytime, but you would enjoy a good 9-to-5 job.  She also asks if you would be opposed to working overtime.  After you say no, that gets you thinking about a certain song in your head.  Which song discussed 'working overtime' in its lyrics?", "correct": "\"Takin' Care of Business\" - Bachman Turner Overdrive", "options": ["\"Money\" - Pink Floyd", "\"I've Been Working on the Railroad\" - American Folk Song", "\"Five O'Clock World\" - The Vogues"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Takin' Care of Business\" - Bachman Turner Overdrive.\n\n\t\"And I've been takin' care of business- everyday.\rTakin' care of business every way.\rI've been takin' care of business- it's all mine.\rTakin' care of business and working overtime.\"\r Bachman-Turner Overdrive (often known better as BTO) released \"Takin' Care of Business\", arguably their most-popular song, on their second album.  Their third album also bore the popular song \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\".  The band, from Winnipeg, Manitoba, has won many Juno awards in the seventies for their work.  Fans may recognize Pink Floyd's song, \"Money\" from their \"Dark Side of the Moon\" album.  It hit the U.S. charts and became a quick success.  \"Five O'Clock World\", by The Vogues, was featured as one of the three opening songs of \"The Drew Carey Show\". \n"}, {"text": "\"Your job,\" the interviewer continues, \"could mean long hours away from home.  You could be traveling all around North America.\"\nYou aren't too concerned by this.  It might be nice to see new places.  You ask where and she quickly names off a few major cities that have been impacting the company.  You think for a minute and realize that only one of the places she mentioned is real.  Which place could you actually visit during your employment?", "correct": "Glastenbury, Vermont", "options": ["Castle Rock, Maine", "Innsmouth, Massachusetts", "Stoneybrook, Connecticut"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlastenbury, Vermont.\n\n\tWell, let's just put it this way... you realize that if you went to two of the places that she listed, you could end up dead.  Castle Rock, you remember, is a fictional city from Stephen King's short stories and novels, the most memorable of which, perhaps, is \"Needful Things\".  In that story, however, the town and all of its residents are plunged into doom as a mysterious shopkeeper, who may be the devil himself, opens a shop in town.  Oddly, although the town is somewhat destroyed, it later appears once again in \"Lisey's Story\", a later King novel.\rInnsmouth, Mass. is of Lovecraftian fame.  Renowned horror icon H. P. Lovecraft used this, and two other fictional cities to establish Lovecraft County in his Cthulhu Mythos.  Of course, the Esoteric Order or Dagon is responsible for much of the terror here, but since you won't be able to visit it in any sense, it shouldn't be a problem to your working life.\rStoneybrook may have been a bit safer, but recalling your young adult fiction, you remember that this town is home to \"The Baby-sitter Club\".\rGlastenbury is the final choice, but if you're to assume the position in this office, you'll realize it's quite the spook-town.  In fact, it's in what locals know as the Bennington Triangle.  The mountain near the town was said to be cursed, and many people have gone missing around it.  The idea has led the town to become 'haunted'.  It has been termed 'The Paranormal Capital of Vermont' by some.\rYou're sure it's safe though... \n"}, {"text": "\"How committed are you to being a team player?\" she asks.  You dread this question.  You find that your work gets done best when you are the one responsible.\n\"I manage,\" you reply (noting the double entendre).  \"I'm not opposed to a team environment, in fact, I'm actually good in a team setting.  I just happen to adapt well to whatever situation is thrown at me.  I used to play on various sports teams.\"\n\"Oh really,\" she replies. \"What did you play?\"\n\"Croquet, mostly.\"\n\nHas Croquet ever been an Olympic sport?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tCroquet first appeared in the 1900 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, France.  Unfortunately, this was also the final year of Croquet.  1900 also marked the single year of Cricket in the Olympics and the lesser-known sport of Basque Pelota.  The now-defunct Olympic sport of Tug of War was also introduced in these second Olympic Games, but they were later removed in 1924's Olympics (in Paris, coincidentally).  Surviving sporting events from 1900 include Water Polo, Equestrian, Archery, Rowing, and Sailing although Rowing is the only sport to run every Olympiad since.\rIronically, France also swept the podium at said Croquet event, stealing the medals for single ball, double ball, and pair events.  Of course, this was due in part to the fact that of the ten competing teams, nine were French.  One was from Belgium, but they failed to place.\rCroquet, since its creation, has been commonly regarded as a leisurely pastime, although it is commonly attributed to upper-class players. \n"}, {"text": "The interviewer stands at her desk and holds out her hand for you to shake it.  Politely, you do.  \"I have a good feeling about you,\" she says. \"I'd like you to start on Secretary's Day.\"\nAs you leave, you ask yourself.  When is your first day of work?", "correct": "Wednesday", "options": ["Friday", "Sunday", "Monday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWednesday.\n\n\tSecretary's Day, also known as Administrative Professionals Day was created in 1952 and has since been celebrated on the third Wednesday of every April.  This secular holiday also shares the month of April with Easter, World Health Day, Good Friday, Earth Day, Arbor Day, and Patriots' Day.\rSince the holiday is secular, it doesn't mean you'll be getting it off work.  In fact, paid holidays vary by country and region.\r Alas!  Trivia wasn't your ultimate downfall!  You got the job fair and square, and thanks to your knowledge, you were able to successfully answer both the interviewer's questions, and the random questions that plagued your mind during the process.  Congrats! :) \n"}]}
