Isabella was forced to retire to a nunnery. \n"}, {"text": "Which sixteenth century future king of England married his dead elder brother's wife?", "correct": "Henry VIII", "options": ["Edward VI", "Henry VII", "Richard III"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry VIII.\n\n\tHenry VIII's elder brother was called Arthur and he was contracted in marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
