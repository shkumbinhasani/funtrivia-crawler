She's just received a call; she'll be charged with criminal child neglect and her son will be placed into an institution.  She tells Larry that if he truly loves her, he'll stop his suffering just as they discussed.  Larry heads to the attic to find Beau, Constance's deformed son, chained by his ankle.  Larry realizes he wants to play, but puts him to bed as it's too late.  He tells Beau it's time to sleep before smothering him with a pillow. \n"}, {"text": "What does Mr. Escandarian want to add to the Harmons' property?", "correct": "A swimming pool", "options": ["A solarium", "A strip mall", "A detached garage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA swimming pool.\n\n\tAt the doctor's office, Viv and Ben receive another set of results.  Viv half-jokingly asks if the baby has hooves and the doctor assures that everything's fine.  In fact, she's having twins, and they're both healthy.\rMarcy holds an open house in order to find the Harmons a buyer and she shows it to a wealthy businessman named Mr. Escandarian who shows clear interest not only in the building, but in Moira.  He mentions that he'd be adding in a swimming pool and knocking out the gazebo and Moira is thrilled with the idea as he'd need to dig her bones out of the yard to do it.\rMr. Escandarian asks what the catch is and while Marcy tries to hide the truth, Viv comes out and says it candidly-- the house has a past of gruesome murders.  He says he's still interested and leaves his card.  Marcy asks Viv why they don't just include tickets to the murder tour with each showing and Viv thinks they should take the tour, at least to know what actually happened in their house. \n"}, {"text": "When Larry tours the Harmon household during Marcy's open house, what feature does he pay particular attention to?", "correct": "Fireplace", "options": ["Gazebo", "Basement", "Attic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFireplace.\n\n\tViv and Marcy enter the kitchen to find Larry inside.  He samples some of their food and Marcy says that the open house is over...and by appointment only.  When he remains at the counter, she draws a gun from her purse and claims it's in self-defense.  When Larry mentions the Americans with Disabilities act and a lawsuit, she backs off and a tour of the house is given with both Viv and Marcy unaware of his history with the property.  He shows particular interest in the fireplace and suggests that the walls feature a mural.\rWhen Viv goes to bed that night, she thinks about sleeping with her security guard Luke, her husband Ben, and the rubber man in the latex outfit.\rViolet continues to cut herself with a razor blade and Tate makes her promise she'll never cut herself again.  Tate asks Violet if she believes in ghosts before she heads downstairs to a planned family dinner with her parents. \n"}, {"text": "What does Ben believe Violet is?", "correct": "Depressed", "options": ["Agoraphobic", "A compulsive liar", "Anorexic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDepressed.\n\n\tAt dinner, Violet isn't hungry and she complains that her parents aren't dealing with solving the problems of their marriage.  Ben says she's showing signs of depression and she says she's okay with that before heading up to her room.  Viv says that perhaps they shouldn't sell the place and Ben says they really have no choice.  When Viv notes that a man with a burnt face arrived to look at the place, Ben doesn't respond.  She also says that she and Marcy are going to take the murder tour so that Viv can give full disclosure about the house.  She can't justify selling without letting the buyer know.\rThe next day, Moira answers the door to find Mr. Escandarian.  She seduces him and makes her way upstairs, pleasuring him in one of the bedrooms.  Ben finds them leaving the room and Escandarian says that if he purchases the property, he's bulldozing it and making it into units. \n"}, {"text": "Did Larry kill his wife and children?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tLarry returns home to find Ben already inside.  Ben tells him how unnerving it can be to have someone in their house and he knows that Larry never wanted to buy the house.  Ben also reveals that Larry lied about everything-- he never burnt his family.  He was in a burn ward for two years and then he was institutionalized.  He never committed his family's murders.  Ben also believes, however, that Hayden never died.  Larry reassures him that the house has powers.  Larry tried to scare him out of the house but only for his own good; he also needs the house back so that he can be happy again with Constance.\rIn the 1990s, Larry confronted his wife, Lorraine, with the news that he had fallen in love with Constance.  Larry says that she and his girls should move back in with her mother in Ohio.  He and Constance would stay in the house since it was hers before.  Lorraine was the one who set the fire, killing herself and the girls.  Ben makes Larry aware of Mr. Escandarian's plan to tear the house down before departing. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these did Charles use to resurrect his dead son?", "correct": "A beating heart", "options": ["A transfusion", "Parts of other children", "The brain of a cat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA beating heart.\n\n\tOn the murder tour ride, Marcy comments on her hopes for the realty business; no matter how horrible the murder, someone will always buy a house.  The tour guide points out Viv, asking why she left them so suddenly last time before he starts on the story of the murder house.\rAfter the death of their son, Thaddeus, Charles and Nora were still stuck with the crippling debt of the house.  Charles, a mad doctor, finally came to a positive result with their dead child.  He told Nora that their child was sleeping upstairs, waiting for her in the nursery.  Believing it too good to be true she entered the room to discover an inhuman creature...and it was awake.  She returned to the parlor to find Charles dosing himself with laudanum.  She asked how he did it and he replied that it was with the beating heart of one of his patients.  She said that she tried to nurse the child but he didn't want milk and then tried to kill it but it wouldn't die.  She commended Charles for his work but, when he came to embrace her, she shot him in the head.  Immediately after, she placed the gun in her mouth and fired.\rMarcy suggests that none of this should go in the listing. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these toys does Beau pass to Violet?", "correct": "Ball", "options": ["Tricycle", "Top", "Car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBall.\n\n\tViv returns to her doctor's with the news that every time she leaves the house she feels sick; the doctor says that it's probably her body's way of telling her to stay home.  Viv asks for more tests.\rConstance visits the basement of the house looking for Larry, criticizing his cliche attempt to meet with her (with flowers).  She says that her new beau is handsome and that she only wants to see Larry's shame.  Larry says he still loves her but she thinks he's weak and disgusting.  The house did it, she says, but he says otherwise.  Larry tells her that the Harmons are selling the house and the prospective owner is tearing it down.\rViolet walks through the halls upstairs and finds the attic door.  She decides to go up and she comes across Beau, looking to play with his ball.  Tate tells Beau to go away, appearing behind Violet and consoling her.  He admits that Violet sees Beau, a ghost of the house's past, because she's evolving.  All she needs to do is tell them to go away and they will.\rIn the attic wall, Tate shows Violet a stash of items he's found in the house.  Most of these are pictures, some of Thaddeus, Charles, and Nora.  When she looks at these in her room, she sees the apparition of Maria, one of the sorority girls killed in the house in the late '60s.  When Violet tells her to go away, she does. \n"}, {"text": "What is Mr. Escandarian's profession?", "correct": "Developer", "options": ["Archaeologist", "Ghost-hunter", "Home-flipper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeveloper.\n\n\tConstance visits Mr. Escandarian at his luxurious house and he immediately tries to buy her off, offering enough money for her to move out so he can expand his venture.  She can tell he's not from California and she brings up the frontier that was once California.  Now everyone lives on top of each other.  There's no more space but it's still a turf war.  Escandarian says he improves on the past, but Constance says that he's bringing up a haunting by digging up history.\rTate has a session with Ben and he says that things have been going well.  When the session ends, Ben asks Tate, off the clock, what he should do about Violet.  Tate says that there's a point at which he'll need to let her go; she's not a little girl anymore.  Ben says that if Violet gets in trouble, he needs to let him know. \n"}, {"text": "Who decides to help Constance prevent the Harmon household from being sold?", "correct": "Moira", "options": ["Tate", "Ben", "Vivian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoira.\n\n\tConstance stops by the Harmon house to speak to Tate.  On her way in, Moira notices that she's been crying and notes her satisfaction.  Tate isn't thrilled to see Constance and asks him about the sessions with Ben-- he says that the root of the problem is that he hates his mother.  Constance visits Beau in the attic as well, sitting down with him on the bed and complimenting him.  She tells him that it's goodbye.  They'll be taking everything away from her.  When she goes downstairs, she tells Moira that Mr. Escandarian is going to raze the house and seal her tomb forever.  When that happens, Moira will be the maid of the new low-rent housing for eternity and she'll lose her family forever.  Moira wonders why men always lie.  They decide to help each other, and Constance tells her to do what she does best.\rMr. Escandarian is invited over. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these people does Viv recognize from an old photo?", "correct": "Nora", "options": ["Charles", "Thaddeus", "Larry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNora.\n\n\tMoira leads Mr. Escandarian into the basement with the promise of further sexual favours and he shows his eagerness as they proceed into the darkness.  Sitting him down in a chair, Mr. Escandarian is asphyxiated from behind by Larry with a clear, plastic bag.  Constance enters the room and compliments Moira on her talents (of which Constance has finally seen the use).  She tells Larry to remove the body from the premises before it expires; they don't want to see Mr. Escandarian ever again.\rUpstairs, Violet looks at the old pictures of the house and Vivian comes in.  She tells Violet that Mr. Escandarian seems really interested in the house.  When it sells, they'll go live with Viv's sister until they find a place.  They're not sure about Ben.  Viv asks about the pictures and Violet says that they're of the original owners.  When Viv looks at the house's first family, she recognizes Nora-- who looked at the house several months earlier before disappearing. \n"}]}
