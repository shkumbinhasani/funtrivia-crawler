{"id": "88047", "name": "Bible Bs Quiz | Bible Alphabetics | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "Bible Alphabetics", "A-K"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these was a prominent Canaanite deity?", "correct": "Baal", "options": ["Bezai", "Bethel", "Bezer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaal.\n\n\tBaal was the god of fertility in the Canaanite pantheon. Baal influenced everything in Canaanite society from agriculture to human sexuality. Baal worship eventually infiltrated both Israel and Judah. \n"}, {"text": "What type of herbs were the enslaved Hebrews to eat during the plague of the death of the Egyptians' firstborn?", "correct": "bitter", "options": ["boiled", "buttered", "broiled"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbitter.\n\n\tThe Hebrews were to eat the herbs along with roast lamb and unleavened bread. Tradition states that the bitter herbs symbolized the bitterness of the Hebrew enslavement in Egypt. These types of herbs became a part of the Passover commemoration.\r That they were eaten during the plagues is recorded in Exodus 12:8. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not true regarding \"blasphemy\" in general?", "correct": "It cannot be forgiven", "options": ["Jesus was accused of blasphemy", "It was punishable by death in the Old Testament", "It can be defined as contemptuous speech"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt cannot be forgiven.\n\n\tJesus was accused of blasphemy on several occasions (Mark 2:7; John 10:33-36; Mark 14:63-65). Blasphemy was punishable by death in the OT (Lev. 24:10-16;Numbers 15:30). However, blasphemy in general can be forgiven when repented of (Matt. 12:32, Mark 3:28,29). Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is another issue. This involves a person who has gone to the point of refusing to and eventually being unable to recognize the good power of God. Such a person cannot be forgiven because he/she cannot repent. \n"}, {"text": "Who was Ruth's second husband?", "correct": "Boaz", "options": ["Bozrah", "Bozez", "Bozo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoaz.\n\n\tBoaz and Ruth gave birth to Obed, who was David's grandfather. Therefore Boaz and his Moabite wife are ancestors of Christ. He married the widow, and in doing so helped Ruth's first mother-in-law (Naomi) get back some land her deceased husband had owned. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these statements about bread are NOT made or quoted by Jesus?", "correct": "\"Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again.\"", "options": ["\"Man does not live by bread alone.\"", "\"I am the 'Bread of Life'\"", "\"It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again.\"\n\n\tJesus says he is the \"Bread of Life\" in John 6:32-58. While being tempted by Satan he quotes Deuteronomy 8:3 saying  \"Man does not live by bread alone\" (Luke 4:4). Jesus makes a seemingly cruel statement when he tells the Canaanite woman that you don't give bread meant for children to the dogs. I believe Jesus is teaching this woman about her faith and showing the disciples an example of great faith  (Matthew 15:21-28). The quote about casting your bread on the waters comes from Ecclesiastes 11:1. \n"}, {"text": " Of the 12 apostles chosen by Jesus, who is the only one whose name begins  with the letter \"B\"? ", "correct": "Bartholomew", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBartholomew.\n\n\tHe is mentioned in all four lists of the 12 apostles (Matt. 10:2-4; Mark 3:16-19; Luke 6:14-16; Acts 1:13) but nowhere else in the Bible. Tradition states that Bartholomew took the gospel to India and was martyred by being put in a sack and cast into the sea. \n"}, {"text": "What did Moses sculpt so the Israelites could be healed after they were punished by God because of their complaining?", "correct": "A bronze serpent", "options": ["A  bronze calf", "A bronze altar", "A bronze cross"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA bronze serpent.\n\n\tThe Israelites were bitten by venomous snakes sent by God because of their complaining. When they repented God told Moses to make a bronze serpent and put it on a pole so that those who looked at the snake would be healed. (Numbers 21:4-9). Jesus refers to this incident when he talks about having to be \"lifted up\" so humankind can be saved (John 3:12-16). \n"}, {"text": "According to the book of James the \"demons\" do what?", "correct": "believe there is one God", "options": ["break the hearts of the faithful", "boast about their power over the saints", "bring offerings to Satan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbelieve there is one God.\n\n\t\"Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that and shudder. You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?\" James 2:18-20 \n"}, {"text": "Jesus used all the following methods to cure a person's blindness but one. Which one did he NOT use?", "correct": "He used water from the Jordan River", "options": ["He commanded immediate restoration", "He used his own saliva", "He used mud and water from the Pool of Siloam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe used water from the Jordan River.\n\n\tBartimaeus received his sight when Jesus immediately healed him (Mark 10:52). Jesus used his saliva to heal a blind man outside Bethsaida in Mark 8:32 and he used clay, saliva and water from Siloam to heal the blind man in John 9:6-11. We have no record of him using water from the Jordan River to heal a blind person. \n"}, {"text": "What criminal was released when Pilate, in an attempt to free Jesus, made an offer to release a prisoner at the Passover feast?", "correct": "Barabbas", "options": ["Bartimaeus", "Barachias", "Barnabas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarabbas.\n\n\tBarabbas was a robber and murderer.
