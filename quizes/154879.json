He was the last child of Henry II and Eleanor and, for most of his father's life, was the favourite son. \n"}, {"text": "If we exclude the first-born child of Henry II, William of Poitiers, who died in infancy, how many brothers did John have when he was born?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "Two", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tJohn's eldest brother was Henry who became the Young King who died in 1183.

Young Henry, Richard and Geoffrey were no more innocent than John. However, John was his father's favourite upon whom he placed an absolute trust. The French King often used the rivalry amongst Henry's sons as a weapon in their continuous wars. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the man that Richard I left in charge of England whilst he was on Crusade and who was then plotted against by John?", "correct": "William Longchamp", "options": ["Walter Manny", "Walter of Coutances", "Hugh le Brun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Longchamp.\n\n\tRichard had given John vast estates of his own to rule on both sides of the Channel.

The original Isabella remarried twice more. \n"}, {"text": "What new nickname did John acquire after a series of defeats in Normandy and Anjou in the years leading up to 1205?", "correct": "soft-sword", "options": ["home-lover", "blunt-spear", "the running deer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsoft-sword.\n\n\tOnce again Philip of France had taken his opportunity to attack the English monarchy.

Because Geoffrey had been an older brother than John it appeared that his claim to the throne was stronger. However, details of his actual murder when he fell into John's hands remain speculative. John's bad reputation at the time was enough to turn people against him. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the Pope who excommunicated John in the year 1209?", "correct": "Innocent III", "options": ["Hadrian IV", "Leo II", "Alexander I"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInnocent III.\n\n\tIn the previous year 1208 an interdict had been laid upon both England and Wales.
