{"id": "335761", "name": "Parenthood Trivia Quiz | Parenthood | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "Parenthood"], "questions": [{"text": "The main family includes two parents, four children, their spouses, and their children as well.  What is the family name?", "correct": "Braverman", "options": ["Courageman", "Smithson", "Peterman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBraverman.\n\n\tThe Bravermans are the family that the show \"Parenthood\" centers on.  The father is named Zeek, and the mother is Camille.  They have four children, Crosby, Adam, Sarah, and Julia.  Adam married Kristina, and they have two children, Max and Haddie.  Sarah married and divorced Seth Holt, and they had two children together, Amber and Drew.  Julia married Joel Graham and they had a daughter named Sydney.  That leaves Crosby, who was not married when the show began, but has a son named Jabbar. \n"}, {"text": "Haddie moved out of her parents house because they would not let her date Alex, who she met at the soup kitchen where she volunteered.  What was one of the reasons they would not let her date Alex?", "correct": "He is an alcoholic.", "options": ["He eats at the soup kitchen.", "He's black.", "He's too young for her."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is an alcoholic.\n\n\tHaddie's parents gave her several reasons why she should not date Alex.  Not only was he too old for her (he was 19 and she was 16), but he was also too grown up for her.  This was not because of the age difference, but because he had been homeless and lived as a grown man and not as a teenager.  The biggest reason, however, was because he was once an alcoholic.  He had been sober for six months, but Adam and Kristina still didn't like the idea of their 16-year-old daughter dating an alcoholic.  They did not forbid her dating him because he was black, though Haddie believed this was the case. \n"}, {"text": "What does Max suffer from?", "correct": "Asperger syndrome", "options": ["Dyslexia", "Hyperthyroidism", "Depression"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsperger syndrome.\n\n\tMax, Adam and Kristina Braverman's son, suffers from Asperger syndrome, which is a form of high-functioning autism.

What was his phrase he said every time he was starting to get angry?", "correct": "\"I see you, I hear you\"", "options": ["\"I won't get mad, I won't get mad\"", "\"You're here, I'm here\"", "\"Don't get mad, get Glad Force Flex\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"I see you, I hear you\".\n\n\tIn the beginning of season 2, Zeek Braverman was struggling with his marriage to Camille.
