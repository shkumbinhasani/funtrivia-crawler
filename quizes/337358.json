{"id": "337358", "name": "\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "Whose lips are used in the \"Science Fiction/Double Feature\" opening sequence at the beginning of the episode?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Mercedes", "Rachel", "Emma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\tOpening the episode, \"Rocky Horror\" fans are treated to the real deal, an emulation of the original opening of \"Rocky Horror\" in which the red lips (on the black background) sing \"Science Fiction/Double Feature\".   The New Directions student doing the honours is Santana.\rThis quickly progresses to Rachel (as Janet) and Finn (as Brad) on a dry-ice-covered stage as they begin to sing \"Over at the Frankenstein Place\" for their dress rehearsal.  Before the song finishes, they're cut off by Dr. Carl who comes on stage to ask Will what exactly he did with Emma.\rOf course, that needs explaining. \n"}, {"text": "How does Will come to the conclusion that Emma is being made 'better' by Carl?", "correct": "She forgets to cut the crusts off her sandwiches", "options": ["She steps in gum and keeps walking", "She doesn't recycle", "She comes in to work with messy hair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe forgets to cut the crusts off her sandwiches.\n\n\tDuring a lunch break with Emma, Will realizes that she's losing some of her obsessive qualities (eg. she forgot to cut the crusts off her sandwich).  She says that she's been forgetting some of these things since she and Carl went to a local theater to catch a production of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\".  Despite the unsanitary conditions of the theater, she powered through it and loved the performance. Because she's having so much fun with Carl, they've also decided to dress up as characters from the show to go trick or treating.  Will can't help but think that Carl's actually making her better (and 'winning').  Will states that all of this is a big coincidence because he's also decided to make New Directions perform \"Rocky Horror\" for the annual assembly. Emma says it's pretty risque and that Sue and Figgins will need to sign off on it, but Will holds true to his word. \n"}, {"text": "Who originally takes the role of Frank-N-Furter in the play?", "correct": "Mike", "options": ["Kurt", "Mercedes", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike.\n\n\tWill informs the kids that they'll be doing \"Rocky Horror\" for the week and notes that not only has he made edits to the riskier stuff, but he drafted up permission forms so that the kids could be in the play and decided to charge admission for their transportation to Nationals in New York.  When the kids start talking about casting, Rachel and Finn immediately swoop up the Brad and Janet roles while Artie becomes the guy in the wheelchair. Although Will asks Kurt if he wants the Frank role, Kurt declines.  Instead, Mike, now more confident after the previous week's duets, decides to step into the transsexual role. Will also asks Sam to be Rocky, the creature, and he agrees (though he's not really sure what he's getting into).  The girls say that he'd better work on his abs because he'll need them in the show; he says that's no problem.  He has no issues with his body. \n"}, {"text": "Who convinces Sue to encourage the \"Rocky Horror\" performance?", "correct": "The news station managers", "options": ["Will", "Her sister, Jean", "Becky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe news station managers.\n\n\tFinn and Rachel go through the script in the auditorium and Finn is really quite confused with it.  At one point, he realizes, Brad and Janet have to perform in their underwear, and this is something he's not really comfortable with- he's insecure.  Rachel tries to reassure him that he's the hottest guy in school, but he's still uneasy.\rOn the local news, Sue performs her usual 'Sue's Corner' segment, this time about fear and Halloween.  Sue doesn't realize that the local station managers are watching from the shadows.  They visit her office in the school for a small chat about fear-mongering and its importance in the news.  They say that someone has been trying to secure stage rights to \"Rocky Horror\" at the school and while Sue dislikes the play for her own reasons, they need her to perform an expose to show that the secular progressive agenda has arrived in Lima, Ohio's schools.  Sue agrees to the idea. \n"}, {"text": "Does Will give Sue a role in the \"Rocky Horror\" performance?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhile rehearsing, Will instructs Rachel and Finn to perform \"Dammit Janet\" in the choir room (with Mercedes, Kurt, and Quinn singing back-up vocals).  Before they begin, Santana and Brittany both make jokes about Finn's appearance and while Rachel criticizes their insults, Quinn backs them saying that guys comment behind girls' backs all the time.  During the \"Dammit Janet\" rendition, Sue stops by the choir room and talks to Will.  While it seems like Sue is going to oppose the show, she says she just wants to be involved.  He gives her the role of the criminologist.  She also states that she gets all final script approval as per her contract, so she has the final say on rewrites.\rIn the weight room, Sam informs Finn of his diet and states that it's all worth it, even if he feels guilty about eating things he shouldn't.  Finn still can't figure out why he should go through all the trouble. \n"}, {"text": "What role does Carl decide to play in the \"Rocky Horror\" musical?", "correct": "Eddie", "options": ["Riff-Raff", "Rocky", "Brad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEddie.\n\n\tWill speaks with Emma about having her do the costume designing for the play (which is part of his plan to spend time with her) and she agrees because she loves the show.  While they discuss the details, Mike stops by the office to inform Will that his parents read the script and don't want him playing the Frank role in the play; he's officially out of it.  After Sue sends Becky (wearing a Sue Sylvester costume) out of her office, she's also informed of their lack of a lead role and shows concern that her local Emmy may be at risk.\rWhen Sue comes across Carl and Emma showing off their Halloween costumes in the guidance office, she initially tries to stop them from having weird sex parties in the school, but she soon discovers that the two of them are also \"Rocky Horror\" buffs.  Upon learning that Carl knows all the lines from the movie, Sue gets an idea to have him audition for the missing role.  After singing \"Hot Patootie\" for the kids, they all agree that he would make a perfect Eddie, much to Will's disliking. \n"}, {"text": "Who ultimately steps up to take the Frank-N-Furter role when the original performer is forced to step back?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Sue", "Will", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tAfter Carl decides that he would rather take the Eddie role (despite the fact that Sue wrote him out of the script) it's Mercedes who finally steps up to take the lead for this one as she'd been waiting a long time to take a leading role in one of the club's projects.  Will has no choice but to let all of this go on with it.\rThe kids get ready for their first dress rehearsal and it's clear that Finn is still worried about his body.  In one of the underwear sequences he asks to keep his clothes on until opening night.  Sam is also concerned about his rather tight gold shorts in the Rocky role.  They continue with the dress rehearsal and Mercedes sings \"Sweet Transvestite\" as Frank.  After the song, Eddie bursts through the wall on his motorcycle (as Eddie) two acts too early.  Emma loves this wrong move, but Will is frustrated. \n"}, {"text": "Who sees Will and Emma performing \"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\"?", "correct": "Brittany and Santana", "options": ["Kurt and Mercedes", "Finn and Rachel", "Carl and Sue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrittany and Santana.\n\n\tWill takes Emma aside in one of the classrooms and talks about Carl and the other roles in the play.  Sam, for instance, was clearly uncomfortable in his outfit.  He says he stepped in and decided to take the role from Sam fearing that perhaps it shouldn't be played by a student.  Emma is surprised that Will would play this role and he asks if they can practice \"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\".  She agrees and the two of them end up enjoying the moment a bit much.  While Emma sings the lyrics, Brittany and Santana watch on from the window (as the characters in the movie did from the camera screens).  As the song ends, Emma is shocked at what she's done and flees the scene.\rIn the weight room, Sam informs Finn that he no longer has the Rocky part, probably because he complained about looking bad in the gold shorts.  Although Finn is worried about losing his part too, Sam says not to worry; with Brad it's more about confidence than looking good. \n"}, {"text": "Finn is nearly suspended, but for what reason?", "correct": "He walked through the school in his underwear", "options": ["He was caught in the bathroom with a girl", "He was framed for an incident in the auditorium", "He yelled at Sue in the hallways"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe walked through the school in his underwear.\n\n\tThe kids try to rehearse one of the more intricate dialogues of the performance with Sue standing by and without Finn (who is nowhere to be found).  While Sue says that a lot of what they're saying is going to be written out, Will is called to the Principal's office.  He finds Finn there awaiting suspension. It turns out that when he was told by Sam that he needed confidence for the role he decided to wear his underwear in the halls of McKinley to prove he could do it.  Finn says that no one knows how it feels for the guys to have these self-esteem issues.  Figgins decides that a one-month suspension is warranted (and summer school) since many kids signed up for grief counseling as a result, but Will knocks it down to a simple warning. Figgins also tells Will that the type of play they're performing might be crossing some lines, and if any heat arises from it, he won't be able to help him or the Glee club from any issues in the future. \n"}, {"text": "Who cancels the show in the end?", "correct": "Will", "options": ["Sue", "Figgins", "No one- the show is performed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill.\n\n\tThis brings everything back to the issue at the beginning of the episode with \"Over at the Frankenstein Place\" and Carl's anger.  After this fight, it's revealed that he probably started the show to get Emma back.  Will doesn't deny this.  Shortly before Halloween, Will catches wind from Becky about Sue's plans to film an expose about \"Rocky Horror\".  He watches the video and confronts her the following day.  The truth is, Will doesn't even find what she said unreasonable.  He decides to pull the show, much to Sue's dismay.  Her Emmy dreams are crushed.  When speaking to Emma, Will apologizes for everything he's one and he says that he needs to back off for now since Carl makes her happy.\rIn the choir room, Will apologizes to the kids as well; he did the play for the wrong reasons.  The kids understand.\rWill says that they're still going to perform \"Rocky Horror\", but not for an audience.  The kids hit the stage one last time to perform \"Time Warp\". \n"}]}
