TREsemm\u00e9?  Suave?  Garnier?  Schwarzkopf?  Speaking of which, do you know which one makes the shampoo called \"Fructis\"?", "correct": "Garnier", "options": ["TREsemm\u00e9", "Schwarzkopf", "Suave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarnier.\n\n\tGarnier (garn-yay) is a brand of shampoo made by L'Or\u00e9al.  Fructis is a Garnier shampoo.  Fructis' slogan in the United States is \"For hair that shines with all its strength\".  L'Or\u00e9al is one of the world's largest cosmetic companies, and was founded in 1909.  They make all sorts of cosmetics, from skin care to hair care to makeup to perfume to sunscreen. \n"}, {"text": "I hate when shampoo gets in my eyes!  It is very painful, and can sometimes last for hours.  Many ingredients can cause eye irritation, but which of these acids can be found in shampoo?", "correct": "Citric acid", "options": ["Acetic acid", "Sulfuric acid", "Hydrochloric acid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCitric acid.\n\n\tShampoo often contains citric acid because it preserves some of the oils in the shampoo itself.  If also makes the hair look smooth and shiny, and it does not grow bacteria like many other acids do.  Citric acid, however, causes severe eye irritation, so when shampoo gets in the eyes, citric acid is likely one of the causes.  Other eye irritants in shampoo include certain fragrances, sodium chloride, and even some formaldehyde! \n"}, {"text": "When shampoo does get in the eyes, what is the best way to get it out?", "correct": "Splash hot water (but not too hot) into the eye", "options": ["Clean with a damp cloth", "Rinse the eye with a stream of cold water", "Vigorously rub the eye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSplash hot water (but not too hot) into the eye.\n\n\tCold water may actually make the pain in the eye worse.  Never, EVER rub your eyes!  Cleaning with a damp cloth basically has the same affect as rubbing; so don't do it.  Splashing hot water in the eye is the best way to get rid of the shampoo.  An alternate method would be cupping the hand and letting warm water sit between your hand and your eye.  Continue to splash water or cup water in your eye until the shampoo is gone.  Oh, and it might help to get the shampoo off your forehead to keep it from going BACK in the eye. \n"}, {"text": "I hate shampoo because I don't know what the heck is in it.  I'm no scientist; I cannot pronounce all those long named things in shampoo!  Which of these is not often found in shampoo?", "correct": "Monosodium glutamate", "options": ["Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl", "Methylchloroisothiazolinone", "Ammonium lauryl sulfate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonosodium glutamate.\n\n\tMonosodium glutamate is oftentimes known as MSG.  It is a salt used in foods as a flavor additive.  However, many health risks are linked with monosodium glutamate, and many restaurants and foodstuffs now advertise that they are \"MSG free\".\r Ammonium lauryl sulfate acts as a foaming agent, cocodimonium hydroxypropyl is used as a conditioner, and methylchloroisothiazolinone is used as a preservative. \n"}, {"text": "I hate how some shampoo brands name their scents in a way you could never understand what it smells like until you open it.  I mean, really, what is \"Home Fresh\", and how should I know what \"Pleasant Aroma\" smells like?  Which of these is not likely to be used as a shampoo fragrance?", "correct": "New Car", "options": ["Clean Linens", "Strawberry Paradise", "Waterfall Mist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Car.\n\n\tWhile there are dozens, if not hundreds, of shampoo scents, it's probably very unlikely to come across a \"New Car\" shampoo.  Fruity shampoo, especially strawberry, raspberry, and apple are very common, as are many watery scents, such as \"Ocean Breeze\" or \"Waterfall Mist\", or \"Rain\" scents.  You might also come across many \"homey\" scents, such as \"Clean Linens\" or \"Warm Vanilla Sugar\".\r (Many of these scents are from Suave.) \n"}, {"text": "I hate how I even have to buy shampoo in the first place!  Why can't I use soap for my hair instead?", "correct": "It causes hair to dry out", "options": ["It's too hard to rinse out", "It causes hair to fall out", "Why not?  Soap is fine to use in the hair!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt causes hair to dry out.\n\n\tThere are many reasons you should not use soap to clean your hair.  You use two different products for hair and skin for a reason.  The skin on the scalp is much different from the rest of the skin on your body, and is more likely to dry out.  Your hair will dry out as well if you use soap instead of shampoo. Shampoo is pH balanced specifically for your hair; it's about a 5, whereas soap has a much higher pH, somewhere between 8 and 9.  Also, soap does not have the same proteins and vitamins your hair needs for healthy growth as shampoo does.  Shampoo is meant for hair, so you want to keep it that way! \n"}, {"text": "I like that you can use shampoo as body wash, if you're running low.  However, I hate the disadvantages to doing so.  Which of these is a disadvantage to using shampoo as body wash?", "correct": "It leaves you feeling 'slimy'", "options": ["It doesn't clean near as well as soap", "Shampoo is often very expensive", "It's too foamy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt leaves you feeling 'slimy'.\n\n\tShampoo was invented because soap ruined the hair; therefore, shampoo is meant only for the use of the hair.  However, it cleans the skin just as well as soap, and oftentimes is much cheaper than soap or body wash.  It most certainly can be used instead of soap or body wash, but it does have some disadvantages; it leaves the skin feeling 'slimy' because of all the oils in the shampoo that are meant for the hair; not the skin, and these oils can dry out the skin. \n"}, {"text": "I hate the rules \"lather, rinse, repeat\".  Why can't I just shampoo once?  Well, there's a reason you must do this.  Why is it a good idea to repeat the process?", "correct": "Cleaning a second time gets excess gunk out of your hair that you missed the first time", "options": ["It's just a clever shampoo advertising ploy that gets you to use twice as much; therefore buying twice as often", "It allows for a more \"all over\" clean; first you clean the top, then the back and sides", "It feels good to massage your head; so do it twice!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCleaning a second time gets excess gunk out of your hair that you missed the first time.\n\n\tThe truth is, you cannot always get all the dirt and oils out of your hair the first time.  Therefore, many shampoo bottles tell you to lather, rinse, and repeat.  Some special shampoos remove other shampoo oils and really clean your hair deeply, and as it is bad for your hair, you don't repeat; and in fact, it should only be used once a month or so!\r It is possible that the repetition makes shampoo companies more money, but that is not the sole purpose in writing \"repeat\" on the bottles. \n"}, {"text": "When I was just a young lad, I knew someone who had cancer; but I did not know that is why they had no hair.  In fact, I didn't know they wore wigs, and when I asked how their hair could grow so long so fast, they replied that it was because they used peanut butter as shampoo, as it is really good for your hair.\n\nWell, that happens to just be an old wives' tale, and peanut butter should not be used as shampoo (though it's not necessarily bad for your hair, it's not good for it either).  However, it has one handy use when it comes to hair.  Peanut butter can be used to remove what from your hair?", "correct": "Bubblegum", "options": ["Playdough (messy messy kids!)", "Soda", "Tangles and knots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBubblegum.\n\n\tThe oils in peanut butter softens up the gum and makes it easy to \"slide\" the gum out of the hair.  Of course, then you have a mess of peanut butter to clean out of your hair, but it's much less painful than pulling gum out. \n"}, {"text": "Ok, I lied.  The truth is that I love shampoo.  Shampoo keeps your hair clean, and I love being clean.\n\nHowever, it was rumored that a certain \"Twilight\" cast member did not shower, and therefore stunk and always had dirty hair.  He squashed these rumors, though.  This actor played Edward Cullen in \"Twilight\".  Which actor was this?", "correct": "Rob Pattinson", "options": ["Stephenie Meyer", "Taylor Lautner", "Kristen Stewart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRob Pattinson.\n\n\tRob Pattinson played Edward Cullen in \"Twilight\" (2008).  He has been loved by many teenage girls, mainly because of his hair.  Rumors claimed that the way Rob Pattinson styled his hair was simply by not washing it; therefore getting a true \"out-of-bed\" look.  However, he claims that he does wash it.  He used sculpting gel, a round brush, and a blow dryer to get the famous \"messy out-of-bed Rob Pattinson\" look. \n"}]}
