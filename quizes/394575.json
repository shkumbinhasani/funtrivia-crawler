{"id": "394575", "name": "Dearborn Quiz | States M | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "States M", "Michigan"], "questions": [{"text": "Dearborn, Michigan wasn't always a city. What township was the city cut from?", "correct": "Dearborn Township", "options": ["Browntown Township", "Ecorse Township", "Springwells Township"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDearborn Township.\n\n\tOk so a bit of a red herring to start the quiz. Dearborn was incorporated as a city in 1927. Prior to that the area was Dearbornville Village, which itself had come from Dearborn Township. In 1928 the city merged with neighboring Fordson but retained the name of Dearborn. \n"}, {"text": "Dearborn is often regarded as the home of Henry Ford. Why is he famous?", "correct": "Automotive baron", "options": ["Inventor of modern pizza oven", "First ever mayor of Dearborn", "32nd U.S. president"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAutomotive baron.\n\n\tHenry, Clara, and Edsel Ford moved to Dearbornville in 1916, many years before it would become a city. Henry was actually born in Greenfield Township in 1863. A little more than a decade later, that township no longer existed as it had been annexed by Detroit and Highland Park. Ford, founder of Ford Motor Company, would later start the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in honor of his birthplace. \n"}, {"text": "As of the 2010 U.S. Census what was the approximate population of Dearborn? ", "correct": "100,000", "options": ["1.3 million", "50,000", "375,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n100,000.\n\n\tThe census bureau reported 98,153 as the official population of the city. At that time the city had the largest population of Arab people living outside of the middle east in the entire world. About 41.7 percent of the city's population was Arabic at the time. \n"}, {"text": "What river runs through the city? ", "correct": "The Rouge River", "options": ["The St. Clair River", "The Niagra River", "The Rio Grande"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Rouge River.\n\n\tThe city popped up on both sides of the Rouge River, using it as a base to become a heavily industrialized city in the early 20th century.  Not only was the city home to Ford Motor Company, but several steel factories and other industrial factories were built there. \r The other three rivers don't come anywhere near Dearborn. \n"}, {"text": "Neighboring the city to the east, what other municipality did Dearborn's Fire Department agree to protect in 2013?", "correct": "Melvindale", "options": ["Detroit", "Highland Park", "Monroe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMelvindale.\n\n\tOf the options only Detroit and Melvindale actually share a border with Dearborn. The deal between the two cities was unique in that the former Melvindale Firefighters were all offered jobs and at similar ranks as to what they had obtained in the other city. Melvindale's department was small, only 15 members, whereas Dearborn's department had over 100 members at the time. \n"}, {"text": "Dearborn is the only non-contiguous city in Michigan.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tA non-contiguous city would mean that parts of the city can't be accessed without going through another municipality. Under Michigan law, there can't be a city that is non-contiguous. Townships don't have to be completely connected, but in order to become a city they have to be self contained. \r The city owns a large (626-acre) parcel of land in another city in Michigan. It is one of very few cities in the United States to do so. This however doesn't make the city non-contiguous, as they serve only as a property owner of that large parcel; it did not become a part of Dearborn. The city is forced to act as any other property owner would if they owned it. \r For a time the city also owned Dearborn Towers which was an apartment building in Clearwater, Florida. \n"}, {"text": "Of the options, which college never had a campus in Dearborn during the 20th century? ", "correct": "Michigan State University", "options": ["Henry Ford College", "University of Michigan", "Central Michigan University"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichigan State University.\n\n\tHFC was founded at Fordson High School in the city. The University of Michigan-Dearborn campus was the largest satellite campus for UM through the end of the 20th century. Central Michigan University offered in-person classes at various locations in the city from the late 1980s through the end of the 20th century. Among the options, only Michigan State didn't offer some type of in-person class work during that time frame. \n"}, {"text": "What type of building is the Islamic Center of America?", "correct": "Mosque", "options": ["Library", "Shopping Center", "College"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMosque.\n\n\tThe Islamic Center of America dates back to the mid 1960s. A new building opened in 2005, and at that time it was the largest largest mosque in the United States. The center was initially established in Detroit, but moved to Dearborn with the new building. It was founded by  Muhammad Jawad Chirri who served the organization until his death in 1994. \n"}, {"text": "Celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2018, which was at that time the longest publishing newspaper in the city?", "correct": "Press & Guide", "options": ["Times Herald", "The Guardian", "The Argus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPress & Guide.\n\n\tThe first copy of the Dearborn Press came out June 14, 1918. Only 800 copies of that first issue were printed, although it would undergo several owner and publisher changes through the years. \rThe Dearborn Shopping Guide, an all-advertising publication, was started by Roy Lancaster. Debuted in 1947.\rThe Dearborn Shopping Guide was published infrequently March 1947-October 1948, when Lancaster brought together investors George McClellan, Cy Aaron, and William A. Ross, and they changed the Shopping Guide into the Dearborn Guide, with regular newspaper format.\rPanax Corp. bought the Dearborn Press in December 1973. Panax then bought the Dearborn Guide in October 1976 and merged the two into the Press & Guide. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the large island that is located within the city of Dearborn?

Located within the Rouge River, it is the only large island located in a tributary of the Detroit River. The island was privately owned from its creation through the end of the 20th century. \r Not a question, but some bonus information about a geographical quirk of Dearborn. \rThe Detroit Lions (football) practiced in the city for much of the early 21st century. While their practice facility had an address of Allen Park, most of the property was actually located within the City of Dearborn. \n"}]}
