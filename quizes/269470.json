In that film the main character Frank Bigelow, played by Edmund O'Brien, is dying.  What disorder does he have?", "correct": "Radiation poisoning", "options": ["Leukemia", "Cancer", "Lead poisoning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadiation poisoning.\n\n\tBigelow has been poisoned and he only has a few days to live.  He spends the rest of his life in a thrilling search for his killers, who he is finally able to bring to vigilante justice.  Rudolph Mat\u00e9 directed this lesser-known classic, with Ernest Laszlo providing the cinematography.  Dimitri Tiomkin provides the score to this underrated thriller that is a must see! \n"}, {"text": "1943's 'The Ox-Bow Incident' is one of the best westerns of all-time.  Not only does it feature a thought-provoking story, it also involves a number of excellent actors.  Which of these actors does not appear in this black and white classic?", "correct": "Jimmy Stewart", "options": ["Anthony Quinn", "Henry Fonda", "Dana Andrews"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJimmy Stewart.\n\n\tHenry Fonda plays Gil Carter, who with his friend Art Croft (Harry Morgan of 'M*A*S*H' fame) ride into a town where a terrible injustice is about to take place, with three innocent men lynched for a crime they did not commit.  Dana Andrews and Anthony Quinn play two of the innocent men, and Jane Darwell is one of the fierce leaders of the lynch mob.  Worth a look! \n"}, {"text": "What classic 1947 film noir features Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer as steamy lovers on the lam?", "correct": "Out of the Past", "options": ["City on the Edge", "The Naked Night", "Dearly Departed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOut of the Past.\n\n\t'Out of the Past' features Mitchum at his best as Jeff Bailey, a man who believes he has escaped from his past.  Unfortunately, his past catches up with him in the form of Kirk Douglas, the man who hired Bailey (real name Markham) to hunt down his wayward wife.  The whole thing is thrilling and fascinating, with Mitchum in control till the very end. \n"}, {"text": "What classic film actress completely dominates the screen with her mesmerizing performance as a psychotic woman, obsessed with a man she can never have in the 1947 film 'Possessed'?", "correct": "Joan Crawford", "options": ["Greer Garson", "Bette Davis", "Vivien Leigh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoan Crawford.\n\n\tThough Crawford won an Oscar the year before for the film 'Mildred Pierce', this performance is my personal favorite of hers.  Combine this with an excellent supporting cast that features Raymond Massey, Geraldine Brooks and, especially, Van Heflin, and you have an overlooked classic! \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter of 'M*A*S*H' fame claimed that his favorite film of all-time was 'My Darling Clementine', not a bad choice if you ask me!  Who directed this classic that featured fine performances from Henry Fonda and Victor Mature?", "correct": "John Ford", "options": ["John Sturges", "Howard Hawks", "Henry Hathaway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Ford.\n\n\t'My Darling Clementine' is my all-time favorite telling of the story of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  Fonda is terrific as Wyatt Earp, and Victor Mature gives one of his best performances as Doc Holliday.  Add Walter Brennan, Tim Holt, Linda Darnell, Jane Darwell, and Ward Bond, and you have another one for the ages from John Ford. \n"}, {"text": "Gary Cooper plays the un-Gary Cooper-like role of a mercenary gun-runner in the 1936 classic 'The General Died at Dawn'.  In what country does the action in this dark picture take place?", "correct": "China", "options": ["Brazil", "France", "Russia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChina.\n\n\tThough he is a mercenary, he's a mercenary with a heart, attempting to avoid having the guns fall into the wrong hands.  Cooper is, as always, fun to watch, and his supporting cast is enjoyable too, especially Akim Tamiroff as the title character, General Yang.  Also keep an eye out for an insidious William Frawley (later of 'I Love Lucy'). \n"}, {"text": "Marlene Dietrich films are always very entertaining.  In one of her best films she plays the entertainer wife of a dying chemist who, in order to assist in her husband's recovery, gets together with a wealthy playboy.  What movie is this?", "correct": "Blonde Venus", "options": ["Desire", "Morocco", "The Blue Angel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlonde Venus.\n\n\tMy personal favorite Dietrich film, 'Blonde Venus' features the famous dancing scene with Dietrich in a gorilla suit.  Sounds unreal?  You'll have to check it out for yourself!  Herbert Marshall and Cary Grant are there to support Ms. Dietrich in this film, and do so with verve.  Young Dickie Moore, the kid who gave Shirley Temple her first big screen kiss, plays Dietrich's darling child. \n"}, {"text": "What child actor amazed audiences while standing toe-to-toe with his on-screen father, Wallace Beery, in the 1931 tearjerker 'The Champ'?", "correct": "Jackie Cooper", "options": ["Robert Blake", "Jackie Coogan", "Dean Stockwell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJackie Cooper.\n\n\tJackie Cooper, who was honored in that same year with a Best Actor Oscar nomination for the film 'Skippy', held his own playing opposite the loveable lug Wallace Beery, who ended up winning the Oscar that year for 'The Champ'.

Huston deservedly won his Oscar for his pinpoint performance, but the other actors in the film are equally excellent, especially Bogart in, perhaps, his most fearsome role. \n"}, {"text": "Who can forget James Cagney in the 1949 film 'White Heat' screaming, \"Made it, Ma! Top of the world!\" just before his ignominious death?  I sure can't.  But what is the name of Cagney's psychotic character in this, one of his most beloved movies?", "correct": "Cody Jarrett", "options": ["Stan Luther", "Nick Price", "Hardy McCormick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCody Jarrett.\n\n\tCagney is stunning in 'White Heat'.  In fact, in one of the prison scenes his performance turned the heads of surprised extras who were not fully prepared for the extent of his lavish performance.  I must give credit to some of the supporting cast as well, the lovely and cold-blooded Virginia Mayo, the precise and always underrated Edmund O'Brien, and, most importantly, Margaret Wycherly, who comes across as a stunningly ruthless Ma Barker-like figure playing Jarrett's mom. \n"}]}
