{"id": "200000", "name": "A Quiz for Sports Authors | Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "QCNs for Sports"], "questions": [{"text": "Why would this true-false question not be allowed?  Shaquille O'Neal signed with the Miami Heat for the 2004-05 season for $22.5 million.", "correct": "Monetary values are not allowed", "options": ["He signed for 24 million dollars", "Shaquille did not sign with the Miami Heat", "The O'Neal spelling is incorrect"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonetary values are not allowed.\n\n\tWhile the other answer options might be factually correct or incorrect, no monetary values are allowed in the sports category which will nullify your question.  Contracts, salaries, bonuses, or any other gratuities, may not be used whether it is past or present, a matter of record or not. \n"}, {"text": "Babe Ruth's favorite food in the offseason was fried chicken.  Why would this not be allowed in any question form?", "correct": "Favorite type questions are not allowed", "options": ["It leaves nothing to say about what he ate during the baseball season", "Because fried chicken was not the only thing that the Babe ate in the offseason", "Because the 'fried chicken' answer was given by his teammates and not by the Babe himself"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFavorite type questions are not allowed.\n\n\tFavorite type questions are not allowed at all.  Just like 'best friend' questions, these change from time to time, even though the person may have stated this themself.  If the player or celebrity states that their favorite movie in 2005 was such and such movie, in time this could change when the person sees a greater movie. \n"}, {"text": "I've submitted a quiz in the sports category that took me an hour to create.  I was waiting with anticipation to get it online.  Instead, the editor listed absolutely everything that was wrong with it.  What should I do?", "correct": "Adjust everything and resubmit the quiz", "options": ["Message them telling them what I think of them because I'm an expert on the subject", "Delete the quiz because it's too much bother to correct", "Resubmit my quiz in hopes to get a different editor's opinion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdjust everything and resubmit the quiz.\n\n\tIf you get an editor that 'itemizes' everything that needs adjusting in your quiz, you should be relieved that someone took the time to try and help you.  It is not an editor's task to write your quiz for you.  Some editors spend more time researching and listing things to help you, than it took you to write your entire quiz. If you have any questions about the items that an editor has pointed out, please message them and ask.  When resubmitting a quiz without adjusting anything in hopes to get a different editor, you should realize that all editors in all categories communicate very well with each other. The chances of having your quiz rejected a second time is almost 100 percent.  Finally, editors in each category specialize in their own expertise.  This is why they are assigned to specific categories.  You may have personally owned the Manchester United soccer team for 10 years, but please work with the editors as they have an abundance of knowledge also.  A lot of times it is an issue with the way that your question is worded to the quiz players. \n"}, {"text": "How many things can you detect are wrong with this true-false question?  Brett Favre plays for the Green Bay Packers, and he and his team did not make it to the Super Bowl.", "correct": "2", "options": ["5", "6", "There is nothing wrong with the question"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tWhen an author states, \"Brett Favre 'plays' for the Green Bay Packers\", this statement is called time-stamping.  Time-stamped means that your statement is valid as of today, and can change in the future.  Favre may 'play' for the Packers today, but what about the future?  Look at baseball's Roger Clemens, who played all through 2003 in his 'retirement' season. After that season, he signed with the Houston Astros for 2004.  The Brett Favre question should have read that he 'played' for the Green Bay Packers.  The other issue with this author's question is that they did not identify which year or season that they were referring to.  This true-false question should have read:  \"Brett Favre played with the Green Bay Packers in the 2004-2005 season, and both he and the team did not make it to the Super Bowl.\"  This way, the quiz players are not staring at the ceiling wondering which season the author is referring to.  There should be nothing to leave quiz players wondering about.\n"}, {"text": "You have created a quiz about the great Ric Flair, possibly the greatest professional wrestler in history.  Which category should you place this quiz in?", "correct": "Entertainment", "options": ["Sports", "Children", "Television"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEntertainment.\n\n\tProfessional wrestling is recognized as entertainment.  With any quiz, you should also during your quiz creation process, check category and sub-category options which are available.  When you initially create a quiz about Nascar driver Dale Earnhardt for example, you may select \"Sports\" as the category, then check which sub-category options are available for your quiz.  \"Nascar Drivers\" may seem to be a suitable category for your quiz, but if you check for another sub-category, you may see \"Dale Earnhardt\". \n"}, {"text": "How many things are wrong with this true-false question:  \"Here's an easy one.  As of the 2004 season, Barry Bonds holds the all-time record for hitting 73 home runs in a season.\"", "correct": "3", "options": ["5", "1", "There is nothing wrong with this question"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tThere were three issues not allowed about this question.  The first issue is that the question was begun with an introduction itself.  Do not begin a question with an introduction such as, \"Here's an easy one\", \"For all you baseball fans\", \"My final question..\", etc.  Just state the question.  Secondly, to state in your question 'as of' makes this question time-stamped. This means that you are attempting to stop time in its tracks.  This is not allowed.  When this is pointed out to an author, some try to reword it to another time-stamped statement.  Terms such as, 'as of', 'up to', 'now', 'last year', currently', 'this year', etc., are all time-stamped terms. Third, when you state the term \"all-time\" in your statement, this means that this is etched in stone and can never change.  There is really no such thing as 'all-time' except for taxes.  This entire question can be rephrased to avoid all issues by asking, \"Barry Bonds set a season home run record in 2001 by hitting 73 home runs.\"  This way you are not stopping time, your statement cannot ever change, and it just asks the question straight forward. \n"}, {"text": "An author wanted to ask this FITB (fill in the blank) question:  \"Who was the first Olympic USA swimmer to win more than six Gold Medals?\"   The correct answer to this question was Mark Spitz.  How would they display this answer properly?", "correct": "Mark Spitz & Spitz", "options": ["Mark Spitz & mark spitz", "Mr. Mark Spitz", "Mark Spitz or Spitz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMark Spitz & Spitz.\n\n\tFill in the blank questions are a tough question to provide to the quiz players in the proper and a standardized format.  There are many issues with a FITB answer.  First of all, they are not case-sensitive.  This means that an author does not have display, \"Mark Spitz & mark spitz\".  For the author to require the answer of, \"Mark Spitz or Spitz\", requires the quiz player to type exactly that in their answer, which is not the proper format. When seeking a FITB answer with the option of Mark Spitz, using the name of the person, \"Mark Spitz & Spitz\" would be the correct option for the author to use. And in this case, the author should have provided in their hint (located below the answer options), \"Two words or just surname\".  If the author chooses to provide an additional hint after the 'Two words or just surname', this is fine also.  The 'hint' is used only for the FITB type questions.  This example is also used for an author seeking a team name.  For example, \"Vancouver Canucks & Canucks & Vancouver\" would be a viable answer.  However, \"Detroit Red Wings\" would not be allowed because FITB answers may not contain more than two words.  Also, no punctuation of any kind is allowed in a FITB answer.  Another issue with FITB questions is that an author should not use an answer which has an almost impossible name to spell.  If the answer to an author's question is baseball's \"Mark Grudzielanek\", the quiz player may know the answer but is penalized because they could not spell it correctly.  This is not fair to the quiz player.  If you cannot avoid these issues, then change your question to a true-false or multiple choice question. \n"}, {"text": "When creating a question and answer in a quiz, what is required for your 'interesting information' to accompany these?", "correct": "Statements validating your answer, and something interesting for the quiz players", "options": ["Just a one line statement repeating the answer is the only thing required", "Nothing is required.  A proper question and answer are the only things required", "Something provided of opinion or commentary like a sportscaster that may provide entertainment to the quiz players"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStatements validating your answer, and something interesting for the quiz players.\n\n\tInteresting information means just that, interesting information.  An author should try and provide something interesting to the quiz players that may awe them.  Whether the quiz player is an expert or a beginner (an author will never know), the author should provide something that will educate them with something that they may not have known before without writing a book. This in itself will make the difference between a standard quiz and a great one.  The quiz players will tell you what they think of your quiz by rating it when they complete it.  Quality quizzes are recognized by quiz players time and time again, and an author's name will be recognized by those quiz players. When a quiz player sees an author known to create quality quizzes in the past, they tend to jump on that quiz to play it.  Information just repeating the answer or providing personal commentary, or a one-liner statement does not do your quiz or the quiz player justice.  An author should try and give everyone something.  Also, quiz players may have tackled quizzes in the past, and those might not have had any interesting information at all.  Since those quizzes were created, the Quiz Creation Guidelines have changed.  Interesting information is now a requirement to provide valuable information for the quiz players. \n"}, {"text": "The author submitted a quiz titled:  'Los Angeles Laker Numbers'.  Their introduction was: Good luck on these Los Angeles Laker numbers.  Which question would not be proper in the quiz?", "correct": "They are all improper", "options": ["KB wore number 8?", "Kobe Bryant wore which number?", "Kobe Bryant?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are all improper.\n\n\tNone of these questions would be allowed.  The question, \"Kobe Bryant?\" is just two words, and by itself is not asking a complete question.  All questions must be in a full statement/question form of at least five words to explain what the question is asking.  \"KB wore number 8?\" would not be proper because some novice quiz players might not recognize who 'KB' is.  To you as an author, it might be obvious that KB means Kobe Bryant. Whether you are a young sports buff or an older person trying to expand your knowledge to learn new things about sports, would you readily know who 'KB' is if you were playing the quiz?  Asking, \"Kobe Bryant wore which number?\" is not correct because this question is time-based. If your title or question does not state the year in which you are asking, then your statement can change in the future.  The proper way to state this question should be:  \"Which Laker wore the number 8 in the 2004-05 season?\"  In the way that this is worded, this complete question leaves nothing for the quiz player to guess, and the question or answer can never change in the future.  \n"}, {"text": "An author submitted a quiz to a category.  That category editor rejected the quiz and explained to the author what was needed to adjust with the quiz so it could be placed online.  Wanting to work on this particular quiz later, the author then created a new quiz in sports.  It was an absolutely perfect sports quiz in all respects.  Why might this sports quiz have been rejected by the sports editor?", "correct": "The author had a correction note or they deleted a previous quiz", "options": ["The author had missed a couple of punctuation marks in their sports quiz", "The editor didn't like that sports team", "The sports quiz should not have been rejected"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe author had a correction note or they deleted a previous quiz.\n\n\tAlthough an author may miss a few punctuation marks in a quiz, an editor will correct those issues and place the quiz online to help the author, then may state which adjustments they made to help the author with future quizzes.  An editor will not reject a quiz for a few frivolous issues.  An editor rejecting a quiz because they do not like the sports team is absurd. No editor has personal vendettas with anyone or any thing.  The quiz could have been rejected because of a \"correction note\".  This means that the author had a different quiz rejected, and that quiz is still waiting to be adjusted by the author. There are reasons for this rejection.  If an author's quiz was previously rejected, then they need to listen to that editor's comments that were put in place to help the author.  Too many times when an author creates a new quiz after one was rejected, the same improper issues exist with the new quiz, and both the author and editors just play ping pong with a quiz.  The author should focus on one quiz only until it is placed online, so they see exactly what is required to have their quiz placed online. \n"}]}
