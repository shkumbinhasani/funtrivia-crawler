{"id": "346733", "name": "Survivor: Borneo Quiz | Survivor: Borneo | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Survivor", "Survivor: Borneo"], "questions": [{"text": "The events of this very first season of \"Survivor\" occurred in which Asian nation?", "correct": "Malaysia", "options": ["Sri Lanka", "Thailand", "Nauru"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMalaysia.\n\n\tSixteen castaways were marooned on an island in the South China Sea, forced to split into teams of two to survive.  With eight people on the Tagi tribe and eight on the Pagong tribe, the survivors needed to battle it out using their physical and mental strengths to outlast the others.\rBecause of this season's island location, the two teams situated their main camps on separate beaches.  To receive water, both teams needed to trek into the forest to locate a watering hole; other than this, a small amount of supplies taken from their ship would need to suffice.  The rest was up to them. \n"}, {"text": "Each episode of the season was marked with elimination.  The first person voted off of the show was the oldest castaway present in the competition.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhile the first person voted out of the Tagi tribe, Sonja, was 63-years-old, she was the third-oldest castaway in \"Survivor: Borneo\".  B.B., the second person voted off (and the first from the Pagong tribe) was 64-years-old while Rudy, on the Tagi tribe, was 73 at the time of filming.  He would later appear in \"Survivor: All Stars\" at the age of 75, topping his own record for oldest castaway in any \"Survivor\" season.\rIn the end of every episode, the team to lose the immunity challenge needed to head to Tribal Council to vote off one member.  When the tribes merged together, all remaining castaways continued to Tribal Council together with only one in possession of immunity. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these tribe members was not eliminated before the team merger?", "correct": "Gretchen", "options": ["Ramona", "Dirk", "Stacey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGretchen.\n\n\tBefore the teams merged six people were eliminated from the competition-- three from Tagi and Three from Pagong, alternative after every immunity challenge to that point.  By the time teams merged on Day 20, Sonja, Stacey, and Dirk had been eliminated from Tagi while B.B., Ramona, and Joel were eliminated from Pagong.\rReasons for these eliminations were varied with some being ousted for their attitudes at camp (ie. general work ethic and relationships with others) and some for physical incapability.  Nonetheless, many team members formed close bonds, opting to survive together rather than split apart. \n"}, {"text": "When the two teams merged, they combined and took on what new team name?", "correct": "Rattana", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRattana.\n\n\tOn Day 19, Sean (from Tiga) and Jenna (from Pagong) proceeded to visit the other teams' tribes as ambassadors, taking in their respective camps deciding upon a place to share a new camp as a merged group.  Ultimately, after their respective investigations, Jenna and Sean met at a summit on a far-away sand spit to decide to live at the Tiga Beach camp.\rWhen the ten finally united under their new flag, their team name had become Rattana, and they were split down the middle-- one half Tiga and one half Pagong.  The team colour would be green.  Despite this, it would come down to an individualist game.  Tribe members needed to look out for the final goal: the million. \n"}, {"text": "When tribe members began to eliminate members of their merged team, they were inevitably voting members onto the final voting jury.  How many castaways would ultimately make up the jury?", "correct": "Seven", "options": ["Eight", "Five", "Nine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven.\n\n\tAfter the merger, ten teams remained in the running for the title of Sole Survivor.  After the first immunity challenge and subsequent elimination (of Gretchen, originally from the Pagong tribe), every following eliminated tribe member would be placed into a jury of seven people, all of whom would return for the final voting ceremony to choose the winner of the million dollars.  By selecting an odd amount of voters, it ensures that there are no ties when the final votes are cast.  There are no recounts; the Sole Survivor is decided. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these items was never given as a reward during any challenge in this season of \"Survivor\"?", "correct": "Helicopter ride", "options": ["Live chickens", "Waterproof matches", "Chocolate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHelicopter ride.\n\n\tIn the original team reward challenges, the winning team usually walked away with food or supplies which would benefit them during the game.  The first challenge, a combination of both reward and immunity, featured waterproof matches, a key item necessary to start fires, especially during rainier days and nights. Other rewards included fishing supplies, comfort items, live chickens, fruits, canned foods, and chocolates.  Individual rewards included letters, videos, and calls from home, comfort items (eg. food, nights off the beach, etc.).  The reward challenges ended when the Rattana tribe was cut down to four members. \n"}, {"text": "How many challenges during the entirety of the show were completed at night?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Three", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tTeams only needed to complete three overnight challenges, one of which was a reward challenge and two of which were immunity challenges.  In a reward challenge on Day 17, the two teams needed to search an abandoned barracks for three items to win a supply of canned goods.  The penultimate immunity challenge (for the final four) was held preceding Tribal Council at night.  All of the Tribal Councils of the show were completed at night and some of the challenges occurred at sundown, but only the two were completely in the dark. \n"}, {"text": "How many votes at tribal council in this season featured a tie in the votes?", "correct": "One", "options": ["None", "Two", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tIn all but the third-to-last vote (in which only four tribe members remained) there had not been a tie vote.  With one voter holding elimination and another unvoted for, the vote was 2-2 for the remaining tribe members.  The split in the vote ultimately caused animosity during the final vote of the game and has been thought by many to be one of the most famous finale decisions in reality TV.  In later seasons, two consecutive tie votes would've resulted in a tie breaker of some sort (ie. a fire-making challenge, a trivia challenge, or the famous game of 'choose-the-coloured-rock'). \n"}, {"text": "Which single castaway won the most individual immunity challenges?", "correct": "Kelly", "options": ["Rudy", "Colleen", "Sean"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKelly.\n\n\tThere were a total of eight individual immunity challenges in this season of \"Survivor\" ranging from breath-holding challenges to rope courses to quizzes.  Ultimately, however, it came down to one member winning an immunity talisman, protecting them from votes at tribal council.  Kelly won four out of eight consecutive immunity challenges, saving her from elimination on each occasion and ultimately changing the dynamic of the game.  The only round of the competition not to include immunity was the final tribal council consisting of only two people. \n"}, {"text": "Which castaway became the Sole Survivor of \"Survivor: Borneo\"?", "correct": "Richard", "options": ["Susan", "Kelly", "Rudy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard.\n\n\tIn the final ceremony, it came down to Richard and Kelly and seven jury members, all voted out of the game in earlier ceremonies.  After a slew of questions and speeches, the seven went to the voting podium to select the person they wanted to win the million.  After tallying the results, it was Richard Hatch who received four votes (to Kelly Wiglesworth's three) to become the Sole Survivor. Rich received votes from Rudy, Susan, Sean, and Greg, the last of whom only voted based on which of the two selected closest to the number in his head; Kelly received votes from Jenna, Gervase, and Colleen. \n"}]}
