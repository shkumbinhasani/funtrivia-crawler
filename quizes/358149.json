{"id": "358149", "name": "Simply Simple Quiz | Thematic Fun | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun", "Thematic Adjectives"], "questions": [{"text": "According to the saying, what comes after 'easy-peasy'?", "correct": "Lemon-squeezy", "options": ["Cough-and-wheezy", "It's-so-breezy", "Mister-Freezie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLemon-squeezy.\n\n\tSure enough, the term 'easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy' is said to reflect how easy something is, perhaps in a more pleasant way.  This is, of course, followed up with 'mac-and-cheesy', 'Japanesey', and all sorts of other add-ons.\rConsidering what it means, it's not surprising that some companies name their products after the term EasyPeasy.  In software, for instance, you can find a product called EasyPeasy to reflect user-friendly applications. \n"}, {"text": "Something easy could be called 'a cinch'.  What type of animal would wear a cinch?", "correct": "Horse", "options": ["Wallaby", "Dog", "Snake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHorse.\n\n\tWhile something that is a 'cinch' is easy, attaching a cinch to a horse probably isn't quite as simple.  The apparatus is a device used to secure the saddle to the horse; it's also called a girth.  The cinch's purpose is often twofold.  Aside from tying the saddle on it also protects the horse's underside from getting hit during hurdles or otherwise.  A cinch is also considered a piece of clothing that tightens around the wearer.  You could, for instance, cinch a belt around your waist. \n"}, {"text": "In what field would you likely use Visual BASIC?", "correct": "Computer programming", "options": ["Cinema", "Visual art", "Publishing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComputer programming.\n\n\tAlthough computer programmers probably wouldn't use it nowadays, Visual BASIC, created by Microsoft, was a derivation of the original BASIC, Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, a language created in 1964.  This version, however, took its last update in 1998 before being overtaken by more streamlined, modern languages. Nonetheless, Visual BASIC ushered in advancements in Internet technology, but with more people logging into the world wide web, it's only reasonable to move on to bigger things to suit the needs of computer users everywhere.  It would continue to influence later programming languages as well. \n"}, {"text": "\"Child's Play\" was a horror film involving which evil villain?", "correct": "Chucky", "options": ["Jason Voorhees", "Leatherface", "Freddy Krueger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChucky.\n\n\tDirected in 1988 by Tom Holland, \"Child's Play\" was about a murderer whose soul was implanted into the body of a Good Guy Doll purchased by a mother to give to her child.  Things turned murderous, go figure.  The doll killed a bunch of people before a final showdown in an apartment building resulting in the doll being set ablaze and shot in the heart (yes, the heart).  Several sequels followed, inserting the doll into the ever-growing canon of film franchises and their unique villains. The doll's voice was provided by Brad Dourif, who was nominated for an Oscar in 1975 (for \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"). \n"}, {"text": "If something is truly simple, it can be 'easy as pie'.  Which of these pies is not for eating, literally?", "correct": "Humble pie", "options": ["Apple pie", "Steak and kidney pie", "Chicken pot pie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHumble pie.\n\n\tHumble pie is part of an idiom-- if you're having a slice of humble pie, you're apologizing and realizing that you were, admittedly, wrong.  Although you can metaphorically eat the slice, you can not bake a pie containing...humble, I guess.\rBut that's okay.  There are tons of pies out there to try.  Apple pie is your typical, sweet, fruit-based pie while steak and kidney pie and chicken pot pie are examples of savory dishes, usually made for dinners instead of desserts.  Making them isn't as simple as snapping your fingers, but eating them can be as easy as...*cough*...pie. \n"}, {"text": "If something is simple to Sherlock Holmes, many people would expect him to say what single word which recalls primary schools (or the periodic table)?", "correct": "Elementary", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nElementary.\n\n\tAlthough Holmes is always associated with the words \"Elementary, My Dear Watson\", he never actually said that line in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories of the famous London-based detective.  The phrase, however, has become part of the popular lexicon because of its use in films and radio shows about the Baker Street figure.  In fact, \"Elementary\" became the name of an American show about a modern-day Holmes played by Johnny Lee Miller. \n"}, {"text": "Sure, it's no pie, but something simple could also be a 'piece of cake'.  Which of these is not a typical type of baked cake?", "correct": "Crabcake", "options": ["Lamington", "Black Forest Cake", "Molten Lava Cake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrabcake.\n\n\tA crabcake, while still edible, is not baked like a normal dessert cake.  It is, in fact, a seafood dish created with crab meat, breaded and deep or pan-fried with diced vegetables.  An American dish, you'd be likely to see it on the Atlantic Coast, specifically in the northeast (eg. Maine down to Chesapeake Bay), simply because of the typical access to delicious, fresh seafood.\rThe others are famous desserts-- a lamington is a typical Australian cake, Black Forest is a chocolate cake made with cherries, and a molten lava cake is cooked in such a way that the chocolate inside is gooey and spills out when opened.  Delicious! \n"}, {"text": "Something simple could be as 'easy as ABC'.  What musical group performed it for the first time in 1970?", "correct": "The Jackson 5", "options": ["ABBA", "The Beach Boys", "The Beatles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Jackson 5.\n\n\tHitting number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1970, \"ABC\" helped the Jackson 5, still on the baby steps of their musical careers, jet to the top and rise in popularity.  With lead vocals from then-eleven-year-old Michael Jackson, the simple lyrics and upbeat tune made it a fast, catchy hit with lasting appeal.  Michael Jackson, of course, went on to make it look easy with an extensive solo career in subsequent decades.  It debuted on \"American Bandstand\". \n"}, {"text": "To call anything simple may be the same as calling it 'plain'.  Which of these landscapes would likely be referred to as 'the plains'?", "correct": "Prairies", "options": ["Glaciers", "Deserts", "Bogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrairies.\n\n\tPlains are typically flat or rolling areas containing grass or fields; whether or not the fields are used for agriculture doesn't really make a difference.  Plains can vary around the world-- the prairie provinces of Canada, for instance, are dusty, but important for agriculture while the lava floes of North America (some in the Arctic and some in the middle of the United States) were created by cooled basalt millions of years ago.\r And of course we all know the phrase 'the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain'.  It's easy to believe it too!  The mountains north of the plains actually receive more rain.  Just so you know.  ;) \n"}, {"text": "If you look at something simple, it's straightforward.  If you were to draw a 180 degree angle away from you, would it be a straight, forward line?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tA 180 degree angle is also known as a straight angle and it is literally comprised of a straight line where a vertex does not break from the original direction of a ray.  If the angle is one degree more than 180, it becomes a reflex angle until it performs a complete revolution (at 360 degrees).  If it is one degree less it becomes an obtuse angle until it meets 90 degrees (a right angle).\r A straight angle is considered the halfway point when measuring the angles of a circle.  Two straight angles equal a perigon. \n"}]}
