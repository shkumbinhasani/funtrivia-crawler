The show was partnered with \"Frankenstein, Jr\".\r Rope-Man was an actual superhero, too, but he was part of the group, The Mighty Heroes. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these superheroes had the secret identity of James Norcross?", "correct": "Super President", "options": ["Blue Falcon", "Spy Shadow", "The Atom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper President.\n\n\tCaught in a cosmic storm which gave him the power to change his molecular structure into any substance known to man (lead, stone, liquid, what have you), U.S. President James Norcross was the hero known as Super President. The show only ran for a season on NBC, from September 19, 1967-December 28, 1968, and was paired with \"Spy Shadow\", a cartoon about a man who could release his shadow to act independently of himself. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these villains was NOT a tormentor of Cool McCool?", "correct": "The Slug", "options": ["Jack-in-the-Box", "Dr. Madcap", "Hurricane Harry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Slug.\n\n\t\"Cool McCool\" was an animated dig at James Bond. He was a smooth (he thought) detective who had a huge Rogue's Gallery of villains which included Dr. Madcap, Hurricane Harry, and the Jack-in-the-Box. The Slug was not a part of his Rogue's Gallery of villains, however.\r The show premiered on NBC on September 10, 1966 and ran until January 14, 1967. Although the show didn't last a full season, \"Cool McCool\" had a very interesting tie-in with its 'big brother', Batman. They were both created by the same person, Bob Kane. \n"}, {"text": "On \"The Banana Splits Show\", there were five shorts that were shown on a rotating basis, four were animated and the fifth was not. The name of the non-animated show was \"_______ Island\".", "correct": "Danger", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDanger.\n\n\tFleegle, Bingo, Drooper, and Snort made up the musical group the Banana Splits and were on NBC from September 7, 1968-September 5, 1970. The one hour show featured music, silly skits, and five other shows which were seen on a rotating basis each week. \"The Hillbilly Bears\", which atually were re-runs from the \"Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show\", from 1965) \"The Micro-Ventures\", \"The Arabian Knights\", and \"The Three Musketeers\" were the cartoons shown on the show while \"Danger Island\" was the non-animated show.\r \"Danger Island\" was the story of the Hayden family who had become shipwrecked and were trying to get off the island while fighting against the natives, pirates, and all other obstacles that got in their way. Two interesting facts about \"Danger Island\" were that this was the first TV appearance of Jan-Michael Vincent (he played Link Simmons, the boyfriend of the main character's daughter) and this was one of the early directorial vehicles for Richard Donner, who would go on to direct \"Superman\" and Superman II\", along with several other films. \n"}, {"text": "On the primetime, animated show, \"Where's Huddles\", the lead character was the starting quarterback on which of the following teams?", "correct": "the Rhinos", "options": ["the Cougars", "the Pacyderms", "the Sharks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe Rhinos.\n\n\t\"Where's Huddles\" was the story of Ed Huddles, a pro quraterback for the Rhinos, and his family. It was pretty much the same show as 'The Flintstones\", only modernized. In fact, Jan Vander Pyl not only did the voice of Ed's wife, Marge, but she had also done the voice of Wilma Flintstone, as well.\r \"Where's Huddles\" was a Summer replacement for \"The Glen Campbell Good Time Hour\" on CBS and only lasted 10 episodes (July-September, 1970). \n"}, {"text": "Archie, Jughead, Betty, Veronica, and the gang had quite a few television shows on the air, in one form or another, between the late 1960's to the late 1970's. Which order is the correct one that their cartoons appeared chronologically?", "correct": "\"The Archie Show\"-- \"Archie's Funhouse\"-- \"Archie's TV Funnies\"-- \"The U.S. of Archie\"", "options": ["\"The U.S. of Archie\"--\"The Archie Show\"--\"Archie's TV Funnies\"-- \"Archie's Funhouse\"", "\"Archie's TV Funnies\"-- \"The U.S. of Archie\"-- \"Archie's Funhouse\"--\"The Archie Show\"", "\"Archie's Funhouse\"--\"The Archie Show\"-- \"The U.S. of Archie\"--\"Archie's TV Funnies\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Archie Show\"-- \"Archie's Funhouse\"-- \"Archie's TV Funnies\"-- \"The U.S. of Archie\"\n\n\tSince 1941, when creator Bob Montana first brought Archie to life in the comic strips, Archie Andrews and his gang have become a staple of the American pop culture lexicon. Everyone knows the names: Archie, Jughead, Mr. Weatherby, and of course, Betty and Veronica. These characters are truly loved.\r In 1963, CBS produced a 30-minute, live-action pilot called \"Archie\", starring John Simpson, to be shown on Saturday mornings. Unfortunately, it was the only episode produced by the network and the idea of bringing Archie to the small screen was scrapped until September 14, 1968 when \"The Archie Show\" cartoon hit the air. It was an instant success and, although the show was on for only one season, subsequent spin-offs of the show followed. In 1970, \"Archie's Funhouse\" premiered, which was just re-runs of \"The Archie Show\", followed by \"Archie's TV Funnies\", in 1971, which was a show where Archie and the gang were in charge of a television station and they would show various cartoons from popular comic strips such as \"Nancy\", \"The Dropouts\", and \"Dick Tracy\". Then, in 1974, \"The U.S. of Archie\" debuted. This show was a look at famous people and events in American history as seen through the eyes of Archie and his gang's ancestors.\r There were other Archie-related shows between that 1968 show and \"The U.S. of Archie\" like \"The Groovy Ghoulies\" and \"Sabrina, the Teenaged Witch\", but none were as popular as the Archie shows were. Also, because of the great success of \"The Archie Show\", in 1968, Don Kirshner created a studio group called \"The Archies\" which did the musical numbers on that show. The group consisted of Andy Kim, Ron Dante, and Toni Wine and they had several top 40 hits as well as a number 1 hit that stayed on the U.S. Billboard Pop chart for four weeks straight called \"Sugar, Sugar\". \n"}, {"text": "Keeping with the Archie theme for a moment, \"Moon Mullins\" was one of the comic strips shown on \"Archie's TV Funnies\".", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\t\"Archie's TV Funnines\" debuted on September 11, 1971, and ran for two seasons. The show featured many of the comic strips that were run in a vast majority of American daily newspapers such as, \"Broomhilda\", \"The Captain and the Kids\" (which was actually \"The Katzenjammer Kids\"), and \"Smokey Stover\". \"Moon Mullins\" was on the show, as well. \n"}, {"text": "In the theme song of the show \"Kid Power\", there were several colors mentioned. The colors were 'white', 'yellow', 'blue', and 'red'. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\t\"Kid Power\" featured characters which were based on the comic strip \"Wee Pals\" by Morrie Turner. Premiering in 1972, the show taught kids how to get along with different types of people from all races and different walks of life. The colors in the theme song were white, yellow, black, and red; blue was not a color that was mentioned. \n"}, {"text": "The superhero, Birdman, received his orders from a man named Falcon ___.", "correct": "Seven & 7", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven & 7.\n\n\tPaired with the show \"The Galaxy Trio\", \"Birdman\" premiered on NBC in September of 1967 and lasted two seasons. Using his solar-based power to fight crime, with the help of his pet falcon, Avenger, and his sidekick, Birdboy, who was introduced in the second season, Birdman was the scourge of the underworld. He usually received his assignments from his boss, Falcon 7. \n"}, {"text": "1980's musical pop star, Rick Springfield, was first introduced to U.S. audiences, in 1973, through this animated show entitled \"Mission:_______\".", "correct": "Magic", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagic.\n\n\tOn September 8, 1973, \"Mission: Magic\" debuted on ABC and lasted two years. The show revolved around magic teacher, Miss Tickle, and her small group of students called the Adventurers. Whenever there was a mystery that needed solving, Rick Springfield would contact the group via a magical grammaphone and Miss Tickle, who had magical powers, would whisk the class away through a magical door that she'd create on the blackboard. \r Like many of the cartoons produced by the Filmation Company during the late 1960's to the mid 1970's, \"Mission: Magic\" had the two things that the company's other shows did, too: a moral message and a musical number. Maybe it was because of all the things that were going on in the world as we came out of the 1960's, but many Filmation produced cartoons of that time dealt with issues like air pollution, social tolerance, and dealing with peer pressure. Musically, Rick Springfield wrote and performed all the songs that were featured on the show during its entire run. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Race Bannon's sometime-girlfriend who appeared every so often on the original \"Jonny Quest\" series?", "correct": "Jade", "options": ["Lotus", "Sapphire", "Rose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJade.\n\n\tCreated by comic book artist Doug Wildey, Jonny, Hadji, Race, Bandit, and Jonny's father, Dr. Benton Quest, first came into our homes in primetime on ABC on September 18, 1964. Although the series only lasted until March of '65, the episodes were re-run on Saturday mornings where it gathered its cult fan-base.\r The series followed this team of adventurers to some of the most exotic and dangerous places on earth such as India, the Amazon jungle, and the Himalayan mountains. Although no one in the group had any superpowers (Hadji did exhibit some limited East Indian mystical abilities), they were more than a match for any of the enemies that they came up against (it helped that the shows villains had no superpowers either). Whenever the guys were in a really tight pickle, from out of nowhere they would get a helping hand from one of Race's old flames whose name was Jade. Although her background was never fully explored, she seemed to be some type of spy/mercenary who would sell her abilities to the highest bidder; however, if her goals conflicted with those of the Quest gang, she always opted to help them instead.\r \"Jonny Quest\" has had several reincarnations of the original series, as well as several TV movies which were shown on the Cartoon Network, but none hold a candle to the original, 26-episode series, in my opinion. \n"}, {"text": "In the six-part series finale of \"Space Ghost\", our hero goes up against many of his arch-villains who have joined together to bring him down. Which one of these evil-doers was NOT a part of that group?", "correct": "The Sandman", "options": ["Zorak", "Moltar", "The Spider-Woman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sandman.\n\n\t\"Spaaaaace Ghooooost!\" NA NA NANAAAAA...! This was the opening refrain of probably the best-loved cartoon of my youth. Even today, some 40 years later, just hearing the theme song makes me smile. \r Premeiring on CBS on September 10, 1966 and ending on September 7, 1968, \"The Space Ghost/Dino Boy Show\" (which was sometimes paired with \"Frankenstein, Jr.\") followed the adventures of Jan, Jace, Blip, and Space Ghost as they tried to rid the universe of evil. With his powerbands and his Phantom Cruiser, Space Ghost was a formidible adversary for any and all comers. The show was thirty minutes in length with two episodes of \"Space Ghost\" sandwiched around one episode of \"Dino Boy\". \r In the series finale, which was six parts spread over three weeks of shows, Space Ghost returns from a deep space mission to find the Ghost Planet (his HQ) attacked and his team captured by a The Council of Doom, which was most of his arch-villains banded together. The group was made up of The Spider-Woman, Zorak, Metallus, the Creature King, Brak, and Moltar; the Sandman was not a part of the Council. Space Ghost allows himself to be captured by the Council and is blasted off into other dimensions, where he meets many other Hanna-Barbera creations such as Shazzan, the Herculoids, and Frankenstein Jr. After finally returning to his proper universe, Space Ghost overcomes the traps of the Council and apprehends most of them as well as saving his team. This was by far one of the best episodes that I've seen of the show and hopefully, soon, there will be a DVD collecting all the shows. The new series \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" really makes a mockery of my hero, unfortunately, but there are those who enjoy it. For me, however, the original series is the best. \n"}, {"text": "Jenny, Scooter, Snoopy, and Countdown were part of which one of the following superhero groups? ", "correct": "The Space Kidettes", "options": ["The Super Six", "The Galactic Teen Force", "The Planeteers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Space Kidettes.\n\n\t\"The Space Kidettes\" ran from Setember 10, 1966-September 2, 1967 on NBC. The series followed the adventures of these four children and their pet, Pup Star, as they tried to avoid the clutches of the evil Captain Skyhook and his gang, who were trying to steal the kids' treasure map. \n"}, {"text": "On the series \"Samson and Goliath\", from which animal did Goliath transform into a superpowered lion?", "correct": "A dog", "options": ["A lion cub", "None of these. It was Samson who transformed into the lion, not Goliath", "A kitten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA dog.\n\n\tOnly lasting one season on NBC during the 1967-1968 season, \"Samson and Goliath\" was the story of a teenaged boy named Samson and his pet dog, Goliath, who travelled the world on his motor scooter fighting evil. Whenever there was danger, Samson would bang his wristbands together and yell, \"I need Samson power!\" and instantly he would be transformed from a teenager into the super-strong hero, Samson. Touching the bands together again, he would then change Goliath from a dog into a superpowered lion with the ability to leap great distances, shatter mountains with his roar, and shoot energy beams from his eyes. \n"}, {"text": "How did Tor, the teenaged alter-ego of the pre-historic superhero, Mightor, gain his magical club?", "correct": "It was given to him by an old man whom he had rescued from a dinosaur attack.", "options": ["He found it in a cave while hiding from a tribe that his people were at war with.", "It was given to him by the tribal king as thanks for rescuing his daughter from a giant pterodactyl attack.", "It was handed down to him by his father who was the previous Mightor."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was given to him by an old man whom he had rescued from a dinosaur attack.\n\n\tAs Tor and his pet dinosaur were travelling, they happened upon an old man who was being attacked by a giant dinosaur. Rescuing the man, he gave Tor a magical club and whenever he raised the club above his head and shouted, \"Mightor!\", the teenager was changed into the superhero possessing super-strength, the ability to fly, and to emit energy beams from the club; also, whenever he would throw the club, it would return to him, a la the Asgardian god, Thor and his hammer, Mjolnir. Tor's pet dinosaur would also be transformed from a friendly and docile creature into a fire breathing dragon.\r \"Mightor\" was on from September 9, 1967-September 6, 1969 and was paied with the cartoon, \"Moby Dick\". Like the format of \"Space Ghost and Dino Boy\", two episodes of \"Mightor\" were sandwiched around one episode of \"Moby Dick\". \n"}]}
