Thousands lined up outside the U.S. Capitol Building, where he lay in state, to pay their respects; hundreds of thousands paid homage along the route of his funeral train to its final destination. In what city was Lincoln finally laid to rest, three weeks after his death?", "correct": "Springfield, Illinois", "options": ["Chicago, Illinois", "Washington, DC", "Gettysburg, Pennsylvania"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpringfield, Illinois.\n\n\t\"Now he belongs to the ages,\" said Secretary of War Edwin Stanton when Lincoln breathed his last, but he belonged to the country, too. His funeral train made stops in ten cities before it reached Springfield, each time lingering for a procession, a public viewing, and a funeral ceremony; even so, there was great disappointment in cities that had not made the list.Towns along the route of the funeral train devised their own send-off ceremonies for the train as it moved through: twenty-seven towns built archways for the train to pass under, and others arranged for groups of thirty-six young women, wearing white dresses and black sashes, to stand by the tracks and represent the states of the Union.In Springfield itself, capital of Illinois and the home of Lincoln's old law office, most buildings were draped in black bunting by the time the train arrived. \n"}, {"text": "Although it was meant to be a place of peace, Lincoln's tomb would be the site of conspiracy, intrigue, and violence. In what type of setting were his tomb and monument built?", "correct": "A quiet, leafy cemetery outside the city", "options": ["The spacious, marble basement of a government building", "The center of a bustling square at the heart of the city", "A hilltop mansion near downtown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA quiet, leafy cemetery outside the city.\n\n\tOak Ridge Cemetery is located two miles from downtown Springfield, an early exemplar of the rural cemetery movement -- a trend away from crowded (and often neglected) city churchyards. The pretty landscaping, open-air feel and quiet atmosphere appealed to Mary Lincoln, who later said that Lincoln had asked her to \"lay [his] remains in some quiet place.\" The town fathers of Springfield wanted their most famous son in a more central location -- even going so far as to build a suitable hilltop tomb near a downtown mansion they'd signed a contract to buy.In order to force them to respect her wishes, the widow of the President had to call on the Secretary of War and eventually make threats to move the body to Chicago or to Washington DC -- with \"violent efforts\" if necessary.A pretty tomb with a marble sarcophagus was finally erected at Oak Ridge, near a tall obelisk and a memorial center. \n"}, {"text": "The plot to steal Lincoln's body began with an Illinois criminal named \"Big\" Jim Kennally, who in February 1876 was wracking his brain for ways to spring a contact of his from jail. Benjamin Boyd, his imprisoned partner in crime, had been convicted and sentenced for what offense?", "correct": "Counterfeiting money", "options": ["Robbing banks", "Illegal arms dealing", "Murdering for hire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCounterfeiting money.\n\n\tBenjamin Boyd was an engraver, a good one, but he saw no reason to limit his talents to good works. It was much more lucrative to engrave detailed, high-quality plates corresponding to federal and local banknotes, and to rely on a network of \"shovers\" to insert these counterfeits, at high profit, into the local economy. He was part of a pressing national problem. In 1865, of all the paper money circulating in Union states, approximately half was counterfeit -- and a lack of public trust in the money could lead to catastrophe for the government using it to fund the Civil War. The impending crisis led to the birth of the Secret Service, a group of government lawmen charged with protecting the currency (they were not given presidential protection duties until after the 1901 assassination of President McKinley).\r Boyd's arrest was a major Secret Service triumph, but it left his network of distributors and shovers (including Big Jim Kennally) high and dry. Naturally, he decided to get creative ... \n"}, {"text": "Kennally's first (and only) idea was to kidnap Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, demanding the release of his friend in addition to cold hard cash. His first set of co-conspirators were a small gang who coincidentally hailed from Lincoln, Illinois. In March 1876, they traveled to the city where Lincoln was buried, with luggage full of grave-robbing tools. After one of the co-conspirators described their plan to a local citizen, however, they wisely decided to call it off. To whom did this loose-lipped crook make his ill-considered boast?", "correct": "To a prostitute", "options": ["To an undercover cop posing as a hansom cab driver", "To a new drinking buddy", "To the caretaker of the tomb during a public tour"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo a prostitute.\n\n\tThomas Sharp, a newspaper editor, was the head of this gang, based thirty miles north of Springfield. In preparation for the crime, they stayed in Springfield for some time, opening a bar and dance hall in a rented building -- and joining more innocent tourists in inspecting Lincoln's tomb at Oak Ridge. They were cheered by the fact that Lincoln's sarcophagus was above ground, and even more delighted by the fact that the door to the tomb had but one padlock. They planned to break into the tomb on the eve of Independence Day, in July, and bury the body in a gravel bar two miles north of Springfield.\r All was going well for our anti-heroes until June, when Thomas Sharp got a bit too friendly with local prostitute Belle Bruce. He told her that he was about to strike it rich, shared the details of his sure scheme, and promised to shower her with gifts once he had received his payoff. Belle listened, and smiled, and went the next morning to visit a close friend of hers, the Springfield chief of police. As the tomb custodian was trying to get the monument association to take the threat seriously, Sharp -- realizing the game was up -- led his band sheepishly out of town; all they walked away with was the rent they hadn't yet paid. \n"}, {"text": "Disappointed with his first selection of henchmen, Kennally went to Chicago to find a second group of minions. Terence Mullen and Jack Hughes, from the near West Side of Chicago, were excited to be cut in on the theft -- but after Kennally left, they decided that they'd need some extra help themselves. Unfortunately for them, they were not particularly careful recruiters. Whom did they approach to help them with the crime?", "correct": "A Secret Service informer", "options": ["An undercover city cop", "The nephew of the tomb's caretaker", "A former Union soldier who had hero-worshipped Lincoln"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Secret Service informer.\n\n\tKennally and Mullen knew each other well -- in fact, they were partners in running the Hub, a shady saloon and billiard hall famed as a hangout spot for counterfeiters. Hughes was also a longtime friend. But Lewis Swegles, the man Mullen and Hughes turned to for additional help, was not so well-known to them.Mullen and Hughes were reassured by his track record as an oft-suspected, never-convicted horse thief -- but what they didn't know was that he had recently accepted employment as a Secret Service informant, with a daily salary of five dollars. The instant they finished telling him about their plot to steal Lincoln's body, he raced to lawyer Charles Deane and Secret Service agent Patrick Tyrrell to inform them of the dastardly scheme.From then on, the lawmen knew of the gang's plans almost as soon as they were made. \n"}, {"text": "Kennally gave very specific instructions to Hughes and Mullen: he would rely on them to do the dirty work, preferring to stay far away in case anything went wrong. Dazzled by the prospect of a $200,000 ransom payoff (in 1876 dollars!) they readily agreed. How did Kennally instruct them to conceal the kidnapped corpse?", "correct": "By burying it, still in its coffin, in a shallow grave in sand dunes", "options": ["By hiding it, still in its coffin, above ground in the woods on his property", "By removing it from its coffin and hiding it in his icebox", "By concealing it, still in its coffin, in the basement of one of his rivals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy burying it, still in its coffin, in a shallow grave in sand dunes.\n\n\tIt was a strange plan, requiring some ten days of travel with the coffin to the sand dunes of Indiana. They could be stopped at any time by a roadblock, or found out by the men tending their horses at inns along the way. Kennally's first plan -- burying the coffin in a gravel bar in a river near Springfield -- was a better one. Since Thomas Sharp and the first gang of conspirators knew that plan, however, Kennally must have decided it was less risky to choose a new hiding spot. \n"}, {"text": "The co-conspirators put some thought into the date of the crime. If they were going to get away with spiriting Lincoln's body out of its tomb and to their chosen hiding place, they needed to pick a night when the locals would be reliably  distracted. What night, in the autumn of 1876, did they choose?", "correct": "Election night", "options": ["Halloween", "The centennial celebration of Independence Day", "The night of a local championship baseball game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElection night.\n\n\tNovember 7, 1876, was election day in a hard-fought race. (Rutherford Hayes went on to win the Presidency over Samuel Tilden, in a highly contested result that spelled the end of Reconstruction.) Mullen liked the symbolism, calling it an \"elegant time to do it.\" There were also practical advantages: they could expect a great deal of traffic out of Springfield that evening, and one more wagon would hardly be noticed.The gang caught the overnight train from Chicago to Springfield November 6; alerted by his informant Swegles, Secret Service agent Tyrrell was on that same train with two hired Pinkerton detectives. \n"}, {"text": "The long-awaited night arrived, and so did the conspirators. Three of them went down to the tomb, while a fourth waited nearby with a wagon. They found it easy to break into Lincoln's sarcophagus, but then they had a problem: the coffin was too heavy to move with just three people. Why?", "correct": "It was encased in lead.", "options": ["Mary Lincoln had insisted that her husband be buried with pockets full of gold.", "Contrary to popular perception, in life Abraham Lincoln had been a very large man.", "As part of his solemn funeral, a stone from every state of the Union had been placed in the coffin."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was encased in lead.\n\n\tLincoln had traveled the country in a lovingly crafted walnut coffin, lined in white satin, with a silver nameplate on the top. When Lincoln was laid to rest, however, his coffin went into a lead-and-cedar box, sealed with lead, which in turn went into the marble sarcophagus. This box was hard to break into and even harder to carry. Swegles was sent to summon the fourth conspirator for help, which conveniently allowed the informant to slip away from his companions. \n"}, {"text": "Thanks to the information provided by their patriotic mole among the co-conspirators, the law was waiting near the tomb on the evening of the planned grave robbery. At a pre-arranged signal from the spy, they emerged from their hiding place and stealthily made their way to Lincoln's resting place. Suddenly, a sharp noise filled the air, alerting the robbers -- who fled without the body they had come for. What caused the sound?", "correct": "A hired detective's pistol accidentally went off.", "options": ["The nervous spy accidentally knocked over a table, spilling books and tools everywhere.", "A federal cop stumbled over a tree root; thinking it to be Lincoln's body, he screamed.", "An uncooperative owl hooted, spooking the conspirators."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA hired detective's pistol accidentally went off.\n\n\tTyrrell and the Pinkerton detectives raced across the grass from the Memorial Hall -- where they had been hiding -- to the tomb where the grave robbers could be caught in the act. Unfortunately, one of the Pinkertons -- George Hay -- cocked his pistol as he left the Hall, resulting in its accidental discharge when he slipped near the tomb. This gave Mullen and Hughes just enough warning that they were able to escape, leaving their tools, the sawn-open sarcophagus, and the coffin of Abraham Lincoln -- slid more than a foot from its proper resting place.\r Hughes and Mullen were not apprehended that night, but the lawmen need not have worried about losing them. Not the cleverest of conspirators, the pair quickly made their way back to the Hub, their Chicago bar, where they were arrested a few days later. Even worse, Mullen sent several letters from jail, requesting an alibi from friends of his, instructing them in what to say and even offering payment -- and these letters came into the hands of the government and were introduced at trial. They were sentenced to a year each at hard labor. Kennally was apprehended (with assistance from Mullen) in 1880; Swegles's cooperation with the law did not last, and he was convicted of burglary near the same time. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the night, Lincoln's body was safe, and its would-be kidnappers were mere days from being apprehended -- but his tomb had been desecrated and the criminals had come horrifyingly close to their goal. The tomb's caretaker, together with a group of prominent local men calling themselves \"Lincoln's Honor Guard,\" decided to protect the body by hiding it until a more secure burial could be arranged. Where was the body of Abraham Lincoln (and, later, the body of his wife Mary) concealed for the next few decades?", "correct": "In the basement beneath his memorial obelisk", "options": ["In the root cellar of the tomb's caretaker", "In the attic of the tomb's Memorial Center", "In a shallow grave in a nearby forest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the basement beneath his memorial obelisk.\n\n\tTerrified that the next ghoulish group of conspirators would succeed, Lincoln's Honor Guard secretly moved his coffin from its place of honor to the dank basement, burying it (after a few months) in a shallow grave there. When Mary Lincoln died almost six years later, she was buried with pomp and circumstance in the main tomb, and then quietly moved to lie next to her husband. The pair would not be permanently buried until 1901, when -- at the instructions of their son Robert -- their coffins were placed in a steel cage and lowered into an underground vault, which was then filled with concrete to a depth of ten feet. It would take a hardy set of grave robbers to break through these defenses, and no one seems to have tried.\r Thank you for joining me in this look at one of the most bizarre criminal conspiracies in American history.
