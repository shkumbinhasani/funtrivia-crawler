{"id": "270353", "name": "The Doll Quiz | 'Seinfeld' - Season 7 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Seinfeld", "Episodes", "Season 7"], "questions": [{"text": "How does Sally Weaver know Susan?", "correct": "They were roommates", "options": ["They're cousins", "They dated", "They don't"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey were roommates.\n\n\tIn the beginning of this episode, Jerry finishes a gig across the country and runs into Sally Weaver, Susan's roommate from college.  Sally congratulates him on the success of the gig despite the fact that he really doesn't remember her much.  She forces a large box into his arms to give to George and Susan as a wedding present and he promptly leaves as he needs to catch his flight back home. Meanwhile, back in New York, Elaine runs into George and Frank at the coffee shop.  George currently isn't pleased with his father as his attempt at getting them to move to Florida's Del Boca Vista fell through, and his father now wants to turn his old bedroom into a rather expensive billiards room. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Elaine take the picture of the man in front of the 'Costanza' sign?", "correct": "Tuscany", "options": ["Del Boca Vista", "The Hamptons", "Queens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTuscany.\n\n\tAfter Elaine is forced into a conversation with Frank and George, she asks George if he showed Frank a picture she took in Tuscany of a man standing in front of a shop owned by a man with the last name 'Costanza'.  Frank realizes that it may be his long-lost cousin, Carlo.  When Frank asks for a copy of the picture, Elaine says that the only one who may have it still is her boyfriend at the time; The Maestro, Bob Cobb. She claims she wouldn't feel right asking for the picture as they haven't spoken since she spilled red wine all over a poster he had autographed by the third tenor of the Three Tenors (who no one ever seems to remember the name of). \n"}, {"text": "What was broken in Jerry's suitcase on the plane ride home from Memphis?", "correct": "A bottle of barbecue sauce", "options": ["A Faberge egg", "His cell phone", "His electric razor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA bottle of barbecue sauce.\n\n\tWhen Jerry returns home from Memphis, he realizes his entire suitcase has been ruined by a broken bottle of barbecue sauce (which broke when he opted to let the stewardess take his suitcase and shove it into the overhead compartment rather than ruin George and Susan's wedding gift).  Kramer says to salvage whatever he can of the sauce, but Jerry was more interested in the bottle, which looked remarkably similar to Charles Grodin, whose show he would be appearing on.  Kramer tells him to make a new bit on styrofoam instead, but he decides against it.  Meanwhile, George arrives and finds the gift waiting for him. \n"}, {"text": "What is the gift that Sally sent to Susan and George?", "correct": "A doormat", "options": ["A picture frame", "A gravy boat", "A quilt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA doormat.\n\n\tWhen George opens the gift that Jerry dragged to New York, he discovers something he does not really enjoy- a personalized doormat with 'The Costanzas' written on it.  He says that Sally could easily have afforded more, considering she is a rather popular executive at Federal Express.  Jerry is shocked that first off, she packed the doormat in such a large box, and secondly, that she didn't simply ship it through her own company. Kramer suggests giving the doormat to Frank and George says he'd also dislike it.  He brings up the billiard room idea and Kramer decides to stop by for a game.  When he drops by, he and Frank decide to get serious and bet on their matches, but they find that playing in such a small space is quite difficult. \n"}, {"text": "When George views Susan's doll collection, who does one doll bear a striking resemblance to?", "correct": "George's mother", "options": ["Elaine", "George's father", "Sally"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge's mother.\n\n\tWhen George returns from Jerry's he finds Susan unpacking her belongings including a doll collection overlooking their bed.  One of these dolls bears an uncanny resemblance to George's nagging mother.  Susan figures George is looking too much into the idea.  Meanwhile, Frank Costanza tells Estelle to get a hold of The Maestro to find a picture of his possible cousin, but he and Kramer still want to finish their first game (which has taken them three hours to progress through).  Kramer ends up breaking the window on his next play. That night, George finds the doll in bed with him and Susan and he tries to cover it up with a pillow because he thinks it makes him feel like he's sleeping next to his mother. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the toothbrush that Jerry speaks so highly of to Elaine?", "correct": "The Orodent", "options": ["The Plaquebuster", "The Pulsator", "The Dentist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Orodent.\n\n\tJerry tells Elaine that the brush works magnificently, as it makes him feel like he's just come from the dentist's every time he uses it.  He also asks Elaine if she wants to see him perform on the Charles Grodin Show and she finds out that the third tenor from The Three Tenors will be the other guest.  She takes the opportunity to ask Jerry if she can get an autograph to replace the one she ruined for The Maestro. George comes into the apartment after this an discusses the doll that looks like his mother, but Jerry is more shocked at the news that Sally is coming to New York for a visit.  Jerry decides to force her to bring a box of barbecue sauce with her so that she'll have the burden of bringing heavy stuff on the plane with her. Elaine thinks this is juvenile. \n"}, {"text": "Sally brings the correct items from Memphis for Jerry's performance.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tKramer and Frank speak with Bob Cobb about the pictures and invite him over for a game of billiards at Frank's place.  After Bob agrees to this, he gets ready for his performance, revealing the fact that he hasn't been wearing any pants during their conversation.  He says it's an old conductor's trick as it keeps a prefect crease every time. Meanwhile, George brings the doll to Jerry's and says that he would destroy it if guilt weren't getting to him.  Elaine arrives with a picture of the Three Tenors and Jerry tells her once again to buy the Orodent.  After this, Sally arrives with a whole case of barbecue sauce, and Jerry is excited until he discovers she brought back the wrong sauce. \n"}, {"text": "What does Kramer use to play pool instead of his cue later in the episode?", "correct": "A baton", "options": ["A pencil", "Other pool balls", "A stick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA baton.\n\n\tGeorge ends up bringing the doll around with him to the coffee shop and he finds himself talking to it.  Meanwhile, Kramer, Frank, and Bob Cobb continue to play pool and Frank realizes that the man in Tuscany must be his cousin, as they look nearly identical.  When The Maestro steps out for some air, Kramer uses his conductor's baton to play a game of pool. Meanwhile, Jerry realizes the perfect idea for a bit for the Charles Grodin Show.  He decides to call George, get a picture of Estelle, and talk about the striking similarity between her and the doll.  When he calls his apartment, Sally picks up instead and decides to do the job instead. Jerry is forced to let her do it since he can't find George. \n"}, {"text": "Does Elaine get an autographed poster for the Maestro?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tJerry ends up introducing Elaine to the third tenor backstage at the show and she finally gets his autograph.  Jerry also surprises Elaine with the Orodent, which comes in a rather large box to pack away the delicate mechanisms within.  She struggles to carry it out of the room with the poster while Jerry takes off his pants (a trick he learned from Kramer earlier).  When Sally arrives with the doll, he realizes she brought the wrong one instead, as she felt the other doll wasn't that funny. After she leaves, the third tenor uses Jerry's ironed pants as a napkin by mistake and Jerry is called onto the set. Meanwhile, Frank, Kramer, and The Maestro finish their game and Frank sets out to find George and show him the picture. \n"}, {"text": "Is it actually Frank's long-lost cousin in the picture from The Maestro?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn the end, Elaine manages to get both the poster and the Orodent to The Maestro's performance (although she gets coffee splashed on her face on the subway).  When she arrives, The Maestro is pleased, but when he leaves for his performance she accidentally spills wine onto the new autograph, like she did with the previous one. When The Maestro begins performing, he discovers that his conductors wand has been snapped, most likely due to the fact that Kramer used it to play pool.  His performance is ruined.  Frank finally finds George at the apartment, but he also finds the Estelle doll.  He snaps its head off in front of Susan and George's ideas are put to rest. Frank later heads to Tuscany to meet with Carlo, but when he arrives, he discovers that the shopkeeper isn't his cousin at all.  He simply returns to New York, disappointed that he was wrong after all. \n"}]}
