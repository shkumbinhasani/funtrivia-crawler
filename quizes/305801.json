{"id": "305801", "name": "The Ultimate \"Mario Kart Wii\" Quiz | Mario Kart Games", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Mario Kart Games", "Mario Kart Wii"], "questions": [{"text": "How many tracks are there in the game?", "correct": "Thirty-two", "options": ["Sixteen", "Twenty-eight", "Twenty-four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThirty-two.\n\n\tThe thirty-two tracks in \"Mario Kart Wii\" are split up into two sections. There are sixteen races in both the 'New Track' section and the 'Retro' section. Both of these sections are split down into four Cups, which each contain four races. \r The Cups are designed to be in ascending order of difficulty and when you first start out you only have four of the Cups open for you to play (two in each section). \r However, if you manage to achieve a top three finish in both of the Cups in one section, the you will unlock the third cup in that section, and the process is repeated until you have unlocked all of the cups at every level of difficulty (50cc, 100cc, 150cc and SPOILER 150cc Mirror mode). That means that there are thirty-two grand prix in which you can compete! \n"}, {"text": "Fill in the blank of this unlockable character:\n\n____ Bowser", "correct": "Dry & Dry Bowser", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDry & Dry Bowser.\n\n\tDry Bowser appears to be a deadened version of normal Bowser and can be unlocked by achieving a rank of 'one-star' or above in all eight of the 150cc Grand Prix. \r In the beginning there are twelve playable characters but if you complete the game there are a further fourteen unlockable characters in \"Mario Kart Wii\" (including two Mii outfits) giving twenty-six in total. They can be unlocked in many different ways including winning a single Grand Prix, to achieving 'star' rankings to unlocking ghosts in Time Trial mode. \r If you want to unlock all of the characters you really have to look in all areas of the game. \n"}, {"text": "In which cup would you find the track 'Maple Treeway'?", "correct": "Star Cup", "options": ["Leaf Cup", "Mushroom Cup", "Lightning Cup"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Cup.\n\n\tThe Star Cup is one of the most difficult in the game, with tracks that include rapids (Koopa Cape), collapsing earth (Grumble Volcano), giant tree branches (Maple Treeway) and stairwell shortcuts (Daisy Circuit). \r The track in 'Maple treeway' is, as the name suggests, in a tree. At the beginning of the course you ascend the tree, encounter some Wigglers at the top of the track and then descend to the start line. \n"}, {"text": "What type of Kart is the Rally Romper?", "correct": "Small", "options": ["Medium", "Large", "Superhuge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmall.\n\n\tThe Rally Romper can be accessed by unlocking one expert Staff ghost in Time Trial mode. Usually, to unlock an expert staff ghost you have to beat the 'normal' ghost by around 5-7 seconds although the threshold does vary between courses. \r Although Time Trial mode is often shunned by many \"Mario Kart\" enthusiasts, who prefer to play the Grand Prix or online mode, in \"Mario Kart Wii\" it allows you to unlock five characters, two bikes and two karts.\r Unlike \"Mario Kart DS\", where it was possible to use all characters with all karts, in \"Mario Kart Wii\" each character can only use the karts and bikes that are the right size. e.g Large characters use large bikes. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not one of the unlockable 'baby' characters in the game?", "correct": "Baby Waluigi", "options": ["Baby Daisy", "Baby Mario", "Baby Peach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaby Waluigi.\n\n\tWhen starting off in \"Mario Kart Wii\", both Baby Peach and Baby Mario are already available to use. However as you progress through the game it is possible to access Baby Luigi and Baby Daisy by unlocking eight expert staff ghost data and by getting a 'One Star' rank or better in all 50cc Cups.\r Baby Mario and Baby Luigi are found in several Mario games, including \"Mario and Luigi Partners in Time\" on the DS. However, Baby Peach and Baby Daisy rarely appear and this is the first time that they have appeared in any of the \"Mario Kart\" games. \n"}, {"text": "Fill in the blank on this track name:\n\nKoopa ____", "correct": "Cape & Koopa Cape", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCape & Koopa Cape.\n\n\tKoopa Cape is also in the Star Cup, along with Daisy Circuit and Grumble Volcano. \r The track is one of the most original of the new set of tracks containing several new elements including a river that makes you go faster and a waterfall down which you fall to gain access to an underwater tube full of rotating beams of lightning that will make you smaller. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the highest ranking Retro cup?", "correct": "Lightning Cup", "options": ["Special Cup", "Leaf Cup", "Banana Cup"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLightning Cup.\n\n\tThe order of Retro cups from lowest to highest is; Shell Cup, Banana Cup, Leaf Cup, Lightning Cup. The Shell cup contains some easier tracks that help you get into the game and they ascend in difficulty as you climb the ladder.\r The Lightning Cup is the highest ranking of the Retro cups as you have to achieve a top three finish in all of the other retro cups in order to unlock it at any given difficulty level. \r The Lightning Cup contains the tracks Mario Circuit 3 (\"Super Mario Kart\"), Peach Gardens (\"Mario Kart DS\"), DK Mountain (\"Mario Kart Double Dash\") and Bowser's Castle (\"Mario Kart 64\"). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters does not appear as a playable character?", "correct": "Wamario", "options": ["Koopa Troopa", "Waluigi", "Dry Bones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWamario.\n\n\tWaluigi is the evil version of Luigi and is stick thin with a purple outfit. Following the same track, one could assume Mario's opposite to be Wamario. However it is actually Wario, the short plump character with the yellow plumber's suit. \r Koopa Troopa is the small shelled character in the game, with Dry Bones being almost the deadened version of Koopa Troopa (he looks the same but is made of only bones).\r Koopa Troopa's track is Koopa Cape, Waluigi's is Waluigi Stadium, and it may be possible to assume that Dry Bones' course is Desert Hills as the Staff Ghost plays as Dry Bones. \n"}, {"text": "How many racers are in each race?", "correct": "Twelve", "options": ["Eight", "Ten", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelve.\n\n\tIn every previous Mario Kart game, there had been a maximum of eight racers per race. However, in \"Mario Kart Wii\" this was increased to twelve, most likely due to the increase in the number of characters that are available within the game.\r In Grand Prix mode, there was previously a maximum of ten points to be gained for a victory however the set-up has now changed. The number of points available from 1st to 12th is 15, 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 respectively.\r Also, the increased number of racers leads to greater scope in the items that can be used in the race. For example it is now possible to get a red shell while in first place, something that would hardly ever be achieved in other \"Mario Kart\" games. There are also new weapons, including the return of the 'POW' box and the electricity cloud. \n"}, {"text": "On which of these courses would you NOT find a giant cannon?", "correct": "Grumble Volcano", "options": ["DK Snowboard Cross", "DK Mountain", "Maple Treeway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrumble Volcano.\n\n\tIn DK Mountain, a retro track from the Gamecube version of \"Mario Kart (Double Dash)\", there is a large cannon that shoots you up to the top of the mountain, in order to descend again to complete the lap.\r Following the Donkey Kong track theme, there is also a cannon in DK's Snowboard Cross just after the shutter gates which fires you across a chasm to the second part of the track.\r In Maple Treeway, the cannon is located near the beginning of the course, just after the opening set of turns. You are fired up to near the top of the tree, again to descend before the end of the lap. \r Although there are many other obstacles to overcome in Grumble Volacano (such as the ground collapsing beneath your kart), there is not a cannon in the race. \n"}]}
