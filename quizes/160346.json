{"id": "160346", "name": "Ultimate LOTR - 'Return of the King' Part 4 Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "J. R. R. Tolkien", "The Return of the King"], "questions": [{"text": "We meet Samwise Gamgee for the first time in the 'Return of the King' alone in Mordor.  If you recall he has taken Sting and the Ring from Frodo, whom he left for dead in Shelob's cave.  Now he seeks to locate Frodo, whom he now presumes to be alive and in the custody of orcs.  With the Ring solely in his possession, does Sam ever place it on his finger?  ", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed, Sam feels the ring's power a couple of times.  It enhances his vision and his hearing and makes him feel powerful.  He even fantasizes for a brief moment a beautiful world created of his own devices.  However, Sam never seriously considers relinquishing the quest to destroy the ring, nor does he seek to abandon his beloved companion Frodo. \n"}, {"text": "Standing along a high path towering over the evil land of Mordor, Sam has a look around Sauron's fell domain.  In the gray distance he espies the great mountain of fire from whence the Ring of Power first emerged.  By what name is this fearsome volcano known?  \n", "correct": "Orodruin", "options": ["Gargul", "Methedras", "Fanuidhol"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrodruin.\n\n\tRising steeply above the Plateau of Gorgoroth, Orodruin, better known as Mount Doom, is the ultimate objective of Sam's and Frodo's long journey.  In the distance the mountain looks as forbidding as if Sam were standing at its base. \n"}, {"text": "Sam descends along the path towards the Tower of Cirith Ungol, where he hopes to find his master.  He approaches the gates of the tower and discovers that two great stone 'Watchers' are at either side.  The Watchers have faces that are carved to resemble which awful creature?  ", "correct": "Vultures", "options": ["Warthogs", "Hyenas", "Cobras"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVultures.\n\n\tSam finds the presence of the Watchers to be quite formidable, but manages to make his way past them using the phial of Galadriel.  Following his entrance the spellbound Watchers, free from the mesmerizing brilliance of Galadriel's gift, shriek in warning of Sam's coming.  Whoever is in the tower must now be alert to his presence! \n"}, {"text": "After entering the Tower of Cirith Ungol Sam is stunned to find that most of its inhabitants are dead.  It appears that an internecine  struggle has occurred among the various orc factions.  Not a little pleased by his good fortune, Sam thrusts towards the tower in which he imagines Frodo to be kept.  After one or two dangerous encounters with the remaining orcs, Sam locates Frodo, who has been stripped of all his possessions.  Sam goes to acquire new clothing for Frodo and provides what password for his friend, to be announced upon his return?  ", "correct": "Elbereth", "options": ["Tinuviel", "Galadriel", "Undomiel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElbereth.\n\n\tElbereth seems to be the functional word for all the elf-made items that Sam and Frodo possess.  I believe they heard the name in elven song.  An ancient Valier lady was called Elbereth (or Varda Elent\u00e1ri), Queen of the Valar, and she is now spoken of fondly in song and legend. \n"}, {"text": "Having sprung Frodo from his wretched confines in the tower, Sam now leads his friend along the path towards their ultimate destination, Mount Doom.  Unfortunately, they have run alarmingly low in their water supply.  With a stroke of incredible luck, however, they find a streamlet of water along the Morgul-road.  With what two words is this water described?  ", "correct": "Bitter and oily", "options": ["Acidic and salty", "Pungent and slimey", "Acrid and brackish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBitter and oily.\n\n\tSam insists that he be the first to test the water, in case it happens to be poisonous.  Frodo will not hear of this, however, and he insists that they both consume the welcome liquid, despite its rather unpleasant taste.  They also consume a bit of lembas and enjoy a crack of light from the sky that has seemingly appeared by providence. \n"}, {"text": "Continuing along the path on their way to Mount Doom, Sam and Frodo suddenly encounter two orcs, one named Garn, a member of Shagrat's (the orc who kidnapped Frodo) outfit and the other an unnamed tracker.  The two orcs discuss their business, and Gollum is mentioned in their conversation.  What does the tracker call Gollum?  ", "correct": "The gobbler", "options": ["Floppy feet", "The slimey one", "The croaker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe gobbler.\n\n\tThe two orcs are hunting for the perpetrators of an apparent massacre at the Tower of Cirith Ungol, but they know little of the specific description of whom they seek.  The two orcs also discuss 'the gobbler', who Sam surmises to be Gollum.  Frodo and Sam now understand that Gollum is still trailing them and thus must be especially cautious of his presence.  He is no longer to be trusted! \n"}, {"text": "Frodo and Sam now make their way across the desolate Plain of Gorgorath.  With their food and water spent, they decide to relieve the burdens of their armor and other effects.  What item(s) does Sam find hardest of all to discard?  ", "correct": "His cooking gear", "options": ["Galadriel's phial", "Sting", "The Elven rope"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis cooking gear.\n\n\tAs they remove their gear, which mostly includes unwanted orc armor, Sam becomes sentimental, in particular for his cooking utensils which have served him well on the journey.  His eyes well up with tears at the thought of jettisoning those trusty pots and pans.  Sam keeps the phial, and Sting, and the small box of dirt that Galadriel has provided him in the faint hope that he may use it upon his return to the Shire. \n"}, {"text": "Finally reaching the slopes of Mount Doom, Sam and Frodo begin the arduous ascent.  After some time, Sam notices a path that leads from Sauron's dark fortress, Barad-d\u00fbr, to the Chambers of Fire, an entrance into the firey bowels of the rumbling volcano.  What is the name of this chamber?  ", "correct": "Sammath Naur", "options": ["Sarn Geber", "Cerin Amroth", "Min-Rimmon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSammath Naur.\n\n\tWhat Sam views is Sauron's Road, from the dark tower to the chamber wherein the One Ring was initially forged at the side of Mount Doom.  Sam eventually manages to make his way up to this path, carrying Frodo on his back no less! \n"}, {"text": "Nearly at the Chambers of Fire, Sam and Frodo once again encounter the desperate and completely depraved Gollum.  Gollum attacks both Frodo and Sam, but Frodo manages to escape thanks to the power of the Ring.  Sam then turns to the cowering Gollum and attempts to finish him off, but Gollum escapes.  ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn actuality, Sam cannot bring himself to kill Gollum, feeling a sudden pity at this tormented creature.  Sam is restrained by the fact that he too once bore the ring, and now understands the immense power that it holds over its bearer.  Only having held it for a short time, Sam imagines what it must be like for Gollum, who held it for many, many years.  Sam angrily sends Gollum off! \n"}, {"text": "In the Chambers of Fire, Frodo stands at the edge of a great chasm with molten magma flowing beneath him.  Unable to thrust the Ring into the hot lava, he instead places it on his finger, giving in finally to its power.  Suddenly, he is accosted by Gollum whose lust has created a madness that can only be satiated by the return of his former possession.  In the end, Gollum is able to wrest the Ring from Frodo, but falls into the magma during his orgiastic celebratory dance.  What is Gollum's last discernable word before plunging into the magma?  ", "correct": "Precious", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrecious.\n\n\tNaturally, once Gollum reacquires the ring, he immediately celebrates the return of his Precious.  He apparently fails to notice that he stands on a precipice overlooking molten lava, however, and falls by accident.  Thus the quest to destroy the ring is over.  Now the return home begins!
