{"id": "323972", "name": "\"Vitamin D\" Quiz / Test | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "How many teams, according to Will, do the kids need to beat at Sectionals?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Four", "Three", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tThe beginning of the episode features the Glee Kids in their practice room and Will teaching them dance moves for their next number.  He warns them that they need more energy as while it may be easy to win sectionals, they need to up their game for Regionals or else they'll lose.  Half the kids in class at this point, however, seem to be falling asleep. Will explains to Emma later that the kids have been complacent for a week since he announced their competition at Sectionals: a school for the deaf and Jane Adams Academy, a half-way house for girls out of juvie.  Sue overhears their conversation in the lunch room and can't help but insult Will's methods. She explains that once a week, she randomly kicks one of the Cheerios off the squad and encourages fear and competition.  As she departs, Will agrees that she may have a point.  Competition it is. \n"}, {"text": "How does Will set up the competition for the kids in New Directions?", "correct": "Girls vs. Boys", "options": ["Everyone pairs up", "Everyone vs. Rachel", "Free-For-All"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGirls vs. Boys\n\n\tWill splits the kids up by gender and gives them their assignment.  Over one week, both sides need to create and perform a mash-up from the ground up.  They choose the songs, costumes, and everything.  Whoever wins gets to choose a song they perform at Sectionals.  Everyone is eager for this and the girls claim to have it in the bag. Rachel already wants to storyboard their choreography.  After practice, Will talks to Finn about his energy and he claims that he's just worn down because of football.  Meanwhile, Sue writes an entry in her journal vowing to destroy Glee Club from the inside by attacking Will. After all, it's wearing down on one of her star cheerleaders (Quinn) who accidentally quivered in her formation.  Quinn, covering for her pregnancy symptoms, claimed that she was just tired from Glee. \n"}, {"text": "Why does McKinley High lack a school nurse?", "correct": "Sue intentionally harmed the previous one", "options": ["She passed away of natural causes", "She was fired for abusing the drug supplies", "She went missing in Colombia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSue intentionally harmed the previous one.\n\n\tSue acts fast by inviting herself over to Will's place to talk to Terri.  Putting it bluntly, she lets it slip that Will may be having an affair with Emma and the only way to avoid packing up and moving out of the district is to get creative.  It just so happens that a school nurse position has opened up (due, in part, to Sue's tripping the elderly previous nurse down the stairs and putting her into a coma).  Terri sneakily mentions her first-aid training as a worker at Sheets N' Things and gets the position. She surprises Emma and Will in the staff lounge claiming that now, she'll be around all the time. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first to take the 'Vitamin D' given by Terri in this episode?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Quinn", "Rachel", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tFinn is worried.  He has no energy and while he's on the football team and in Glee, he's just so tired and overwhelmed.  The guys in Glee notice this too, and say that they need him around to do their mash-up.  Puck recommends he visit the school nurse.  The girls, on the other hand, are faring no better. Rachel agrees with the complacent behaviour of New Directions and suggests that the girls work on their number to beat the boys, but no one else is willing since they can wing it.  Finn arrives in the nurse's office and finds Terri.  Terri asks Finn some normal questions but tries to enforce the fact that he should only think about one girl at a time. When she explains what she did in high school, she remembers how she accomplished her active lifestyle- Sudofedren, the stuff put into decongestants to make them non-drowsy.  Finn takes two. \n"}, {"text": "For the first mash-up, the group sings Usher's 'Confessions' and what other song?", "correct": "\"It's My Life\" by Bon Jovi", "options": ["\"Shake It\" by Metro Station", "Another One Bites the Dust\" by Queen", "\"Message in a Bottle\" by The Police"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"It's My Life\" by Bon Jovi.\n\n\tReturning to the choir room, Finn is more chipper than ever and ready for the guys' performance.  Handing them a pack of Sudofedren, they rehearse their song and perform it for the girls, Will and their celebrity judge (Emma).  The energetic number (a mix between Bon Jovi's \"It's My Life\" and Usher's \"Confessions\") strikes a good chord and the girls realize what they're up against. Rachel later approaches Quinn about her pregnancy issues as she hasn't been around for a while.  She explains that she doesn't hate Quinn and that she and the Glee Club are her friends no matter what.  Meanwhile, Terri calls Howard, one of her co-workers at Sheets 'N' Things, and asks him to go to the drug store to pick up some decongestants for the students- a whole thirty-six boxes. \n"}, {"text": "Who admits to the second performers that the first mash-up was performed on some sort of drug?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Artie", "Finn", "Terri"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tKen speaks to Terri about Will and Emma and the two decide to devise a way to get them to split as it ruins things for both of them.  Terri recommends to Ken that he go to the nearest store and by Emma an engagement ring before sending him off with her own 'Vitamin D'.  The girls, meanwhile, are still worried about their performance as the boys knocked theirs out of the park. Kurt interrupts their meeting though claiming that his allegiance remains with them due to the boys' rejection of his costume and make-up ideas.  He admits that they all took some sort of pill before their performance, but he doesn't know what. Rachel confronts Finn that day and explains that he doesn't need performance-enhancing drugs to win. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Ken ask Emma to marry him?", "correct": "The school's staff lounge", "options": ["The school parking lot", "Her office", "Her house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe school's staff lounge.\n\n\tCompetition proves too tough.  The girls talk to Terri and get their own doses of Vitamin D.  Terri assures them it's alright as she's a nurse and it's all over-the-counter medicine.  In the lunch room, Terri asserts her dominance over Will but he recoils saying that it's not good for their marriage to be without their separation; now, they have nothing to come home to talk about, and he needs his space. When he leaves, Terri tells Ken to pop the question to Emma nearby.  He does, and he presents her with a cubic zirconia ring.  While he states that he can't necessarily be as clean as she needs him to be, he can keep her life clean of sadness. That's when he pops the question. \n"}, {"text": "For the second mash-up of the episode, \"Walking On Sunshine\" is performed along with what Beyonce single?", "correct": "Halo", "options": ["Crazy in Love", "Diva", "Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalo.\n\n\tThe girls, now under the effects of their 'Vitamins' take to the stage for an energetic performance consisting of \"Halo\" by Beyonce and \"Walking On Sunshine\" by Katrina and the Waves.  Emma, after watching them perform, agrees that his plan may have worked to spur them into a competitive, excited group. Will speaks to her about the proposal soon after.  Emma feels like she has no choice, but Will says it's not a reason to marry someone.  Terri stops into Emma's office later to 'clear the air'.  Emma says that Will deserves better than her as he's nice, kind, and honest.  Terri says that Emma can't possibly win and that she should take Ken's proposal despite his flaws as competing with her would be fruitless. She leaves her with the choice. \n"}, {"text": "Quinn, when speaking to Terri, decides to give up her baby.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAs Terri walks through the school, she runs into Quinn who thanks her for the vitamins that she gave for the baby.  Realizing that her life is where she wants it with school, cheerleading, popularity, and even Glee Club, she decides to give up the baby to Terri (who is thrilled) because she wants herself and Finn to be happy. Her only request from Terri, however, is some money for doctor's bills and maternity clothes.  Terri refuses this, however, saying that she has to pay for the next eighteen years, and Quinn can handle this one.  Emma talks with Ken, stipulating that marriage with her would entail her keeping her last name, her house across town, and no real wedding. She admits that ken is a good man and that neither of them want to be alone.  She accepts his proposal. \n"}, {"text": "Who is called in to co-direct Glee Club in the end of this episode?", "correct": "Sue", "options": ["Emma", "Terri", "Ken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSue.\n\n\tFinn speaks to Rachel about the cheating on both sides.  They both apologize and decide to tell the truth.  Terri and Will find themselves in the Principal's Office where Will criticizes Terri's choices to give drugs to his students.  As it turns out, Harold also felt the brunt of this as he had been accused of buying so many pills to manufacture methamphetamines. Terri claims that she was trying to help, but Will is worried about trust.  If Terri can't watch teenagers, how can she look after a baby?  Will is also left at fault.  With his penchant for trying to enforce competition, he has harboured this odd predicament without even realizing it.  The Principal requests that a co-director be found, and Sue is selected for the role, something that the Glee kids are powerless to prevent despite their apologies. Emma, after this meeting, tells Will that she accepted Ken's proposal.  Will tells her half-heartedly that he's happy for her before they go their separate ways. \n"}]}
