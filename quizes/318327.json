{"id": "318327", "name": "\"Dollhouse\": \"Vows\" Quiz | Dollhouse | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Dollhouse"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Vows\" begins at the Dollhouse, where staff members are discussing Echo's latest assignment. They don't all like it: Boyd calls it \"sick.\" At the end of the teaser, we cut to Echo, in character as Roma. What is she doing?", "correct": "Getting married", "options": ["Assassinating a world leader", "Nursing an infant", "Running for office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGetting married.\n\n\tThe episode's title refers partly to Echo/Roma's wedding vows (and partly to another vow, taken at the end of the episode). With dozens of guests looking on, she swears undying devotion to Martin Klar (Jamie Bamber). But she's a Doll; this personality is not her own, and she has been (and will be) many more people before her five-year stint at the Dollhouse is up. \"Roma\" might believe in her vows, but the groom must surely know the marriage is an unsustainable sham; who would engage the Dollhouse for a fleeting fantasy that will wound his friends and family? Or are they in on it too? \n"}, {"text": "With Echo's engagement underway, it's business as usual for Topher and Ivy at the Dollhouse: a busy schedule of personality tweaks, treatments, and -- eek! Topher opens a cupboard to find it filled with his worst nightmare. What is it?", "correct": "Rats", "options": ["Spiders", "Pink slips", "Fashion magazines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRats.\n\n\tAmusingly, Topher panics and clambers over the balcony railing to escape, while his much put-upon assistant Ivy rounds up the rats. Topher's next act is to call Dr. Saunders, who has been playing pranks on him for a while now: she's still reeling from her discovery in the previous season that she's really a Doll, imprinted with a doctor's personality.\r \"Is this your idea of a joke?\" Topher asks her.\r \"You designed me, Mr. Brink,\" she responds. \"I guess it must be YOUR idea of a joke.\" \n"}, {"text": "Boyd visits Dr. Saunders in her office to give her Victor's latest medical records. The discussion is a bit awkward: the records pertain to a medical procedure that the Dollhouse brass approved for Victor, but denied Dr. Saunders some time previously. What is it?", "correct": "Surgery to correct facial scars", "options": ["Laser-eye surgery", "Face lift", "Liposuction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSurgery to correct facial scars.\n\n\tDr. Saunders sports several thin facial scars, legacies of a past encounter with the renegade Doll Alpha -- who was disturbingly handy with a razor. At the end of Season 1, when Alpha appeared again, he gave Victor the same treatment. Now, Victor is receiving expensive plastic surgery so that he can continue as a Doll, whereas Dr. Saunders -- a Doll when she was attacked -- was hastily imprinted as a staff member, whose looks are not as important.In conversation with Boyd, she claims to like the scars: they help her maintain her status as a distinct personality. Boyd, who is sweet on her, promises that he would never let her be turned into a Doll again. \n"}, {"text": "We soon learn that Echo's engagement has been arranged by Paul Ballard, the erstwhile FBI agent. He's using the personality of \"Roma\" to get information on her \"husband,\" Klar. Why is this man so interesting?", "correct": "He's an arms dealer.", "options": ["He's a spy.", "He's an assassin.", "He's Ballard's son."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's an arms dealer.\n\n\tFor five years, the FBI has been trying and failing to get something on Martin Klar -- and Ballard was one of the agents who tried and failed. Now he's working outside the law, in the Dollhouse, and he's keen to use their resources to gift-wrap Klar for the FBI. Echo believes she's Ballard's partner, posing as a woman in love in order to get close to the target, and she's all for it -- but, as the operation moves forward, Ballard begins to have doubts. Perhaps he's remembered that he spent the entire previous season trying to rescue Echo -- so why is he putting her in harm's way now? \n"}, {"text": "Dolls on long-term engagements are brought in every so often, for a medical work-up and a check on their imprinted personalities. Echo is no exception, but she glitches in the doctor's office and remembers something odd. What is it?", "correct": "A gala that both she and the doctor had attended as Dolls", "options": ["An escape attempt, wherein the doctor had helped her", "A confrontation with Alpha", "A glimpse of her former, pre-Doll self"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA gala that both she and the doctor had attended as Dolls.\n\n\tIt was a fancy-dress party, and Echo and Whiskey (Dr. Saunders's code name as a Doll) were both there -- and programmed to flirt with each other, for the amusement of the client. Rising from the exam table with this memory fresh, Echo calls the doctor by her old name and observes that she was once the Number One Doll -- all facts she should not know, and which send Dr. Saunders to a dark emotional place. \n"}, {"text": "We next cut to Washington, where a young senator -- Daniel Perrin -- is holding a press conference to announce his planned investigation of the Rossum Corporation, parent of the Dollhouse. What actor, who also had a major role in the Joss Whedon shows \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Angel,\" plays the senator?", "correct": "Alexis Denisof", "options": ["Anthony Stewart Head", "Alan Tudyk", "Harry Lennix"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlexis Denisof.\n\n\t\"What is more precious to a human being than their mind?\" Senator Perrin asks. \"Everything we feel, see -- everything we are is controlled by our brains.\" Noting his mother's struggle and his dedication as a lawmaker to health-care advances, he accuses the Rossum Corporation of \"nothing less than a conspiracy ... to withhold medical advances\" and to use \"radical\" techniques in untried ways. Adelle and Boyd watch the press conference in her office. Possibly sensing a multi-episode story arc, they're worried. \n"}, {"text": "That night, Topher wakes to find Dr. Saunders in the room with him. She's obsessed with the fact that he programmed her personality; she loathes the idea that she owes her thoughts to him. So he asks her why she hasn't looked into restoring her original personality, the one she had before she was a Doll. What does she tell him?", "correct": "She doesn't want to die.", "options": ["She can't give up her friends in the Dollhouse.", "She's already made the arrangements.", "She doesn't trust him to give her the right personality."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe doesn't want to die.\n\n\tWhiskey/Dr. Saunders is at a very low ebb, sitting pressed against the wall in a room full of computer racks. \"I don't want to die,\" she tells Topher. \"I'm not even real. I'm in someone else's body and I'm afraid to give it up.\" When Topher, partly from compassion and partly from pride in the personality he has created, tells her she's human, she tells him not to flatter himself. As the poet Yeats wrote, \"Things fall apart. The center cannot hold.\" \n"}, {"text": "Uh oh -- Echo/Roma's cover has been blown, and her \"husband\" knows she isn't who she appears to be. What gave her away?", "correct": "Photos of her talking to Ballard", "options": ["A sudden increase in her bank balance", "The recording device in her purse", "An overheard phone conversation with her handler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhotos of her talking to Ballard.\n\n\tPoor Ballard: everyone's finding him suspicious these days. Adelle thinks he may have an unnaturally great interest in Echo. Topher calls him \"frenemy.\" Boyd thinks he might have tipped Senator Perrin off to the Rossum Corporation's shadier interests. And now Martin Klar's henchman recognizes him as a former FBI agent, and sounds the alarm that the blushing bride has a hidden agenda. Some days, it just doesn't pay to get out of bed. \n"}, {"text": "With her cover blown, Echo/Roma is in terrible trouble at best -- and she is definitely not at her best. In fact, she's glitching: her brain is dumping random personalities into her head, making it impossible for her even to know her name. Why is she glitching?", "correct": "A head injury", "options": ["A sound trigger played by her handler", "Drugs in her coffee", "Shoddy workmanship by Topher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA head injury.\n\n\tEcho/Roma wakes to find her husband gone from the house. She doesn't know that he has been informed of her other identity as an FBI agent, and she tries to break into his desk -- and he catches her at it. Not believing her story that she was only trying to learn the destination of their honeymoon, he slams her head into the desk, hard. \"One day!\" he shouts. \"One day wed, and I get this: proof that my wife is my enemy.\" She begins a beautiful, elegant explanation -- and glitches at the worst possible moment. It takes some fancy footwork to save the day. \n"}, {"text": "\"The honeymoon's over,\" Echo's handler is in disgrace for botching the engagement, Dr. Saunders has run away, Sierra and a fully healed Victor are still sweet on each other, and Ballard has a new job. What is it?", "correct": "Echo's handler", "options": ["Head of Dollhouse security", "Sierra's handler", "Special investigator for Senator Perrin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEcho's handler.\n\n\tAdelle thinks his accepting the position is because of Ballard's fondness for Echo, and she's partly right -- but there's something else there, an implicit pact made explicit in the last scene. \"I remember everything,\" a supposedly blank, personality-wiped Echo tells Ballard in the Dollhouse. \"Sometimes I'm someone else, and then I come back, but I still feel them -- all of them. I've been many people ... I'm all of them, but none of them is me. Do you know who's real?\"\r Told that the real Echo is Caroline, she says she wants to find her -- and all the other people wiped clean to make the Dolls. \"Will you help me?\" she asks Ballard.\r \"I swear,\" he says. \n"}]}
