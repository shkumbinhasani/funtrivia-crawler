{"id": "347249", "name": "Survivor: Africa Quiz | Survivor: Africa | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Survivor", "Survivor: Africa"], "questions": [{"text": "In which country was \"Survivor: Africa\" set?", "correct": "Kenya", "options": ["Tanzania", "Gabon", "Namibia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKenya.\n\n\tOn Day 1 of this new adventure, sixteen new participants headed to a remote locale, this time in Africa, to begin a new cycle of the \"Survivor\" reality TV show.  Driving through Kenya, the participants would have thirty-nine days to outwit, outplay, and outlast as Samburu and Boran, two tribes (one in red, the other in gold).  Everyone was dropped off and left to their own devices in the middle of the savannah and told to select what supplies to bring with them from a crate of items. They would inhabit abandoned villages and need to set up camp as soon as possible to beat the heat.  Fire would be a priority as it would be their greatest means of sterilizing water. All in all it would be up to the teams to set up what mattered most in the beginning. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 6, during the second Immunity Challenge of the season, teams had to face off against a surprising local edible.  What did teams need to digest?", "correct": "Cow's blood", "options": ["Dung beetles", "Praying mantis", "Ostrich brain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCow's blood.\n\n\tAs with previous seasons of the show, the teams' second Immunity Challenge involved the devouring of a local delicacy-- in \"Borneo\" it was grubs and in \"Australia\" it was a buffet of items including cow brains and mangrove worms.  For this incredible edible challenge, the teams needed to face off, shot for shot, drinking fresh cow's blood diluted with fresh milk. Teams watched this process from start to finish and no one backed away from the challenge.  When the task ended in a tie, teams chose a member from each tribe to drink an entire glass of pure cow's blood; whoever did so the fastest won Immunity. Samburu won for the second time in a row. \n"}, {"text": "When a tiebreaker needed to occur at the first Samburu Tribal Council in this season, it was solved by which of these?", "correct": "Completion of a nature quiz", "options": ["A fire-making task", "A game of random chance", "Votes from the opposing tribe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCompletion of a nature quiz.\n\n\tUnder most circumstances, ties at Tribal Council are followed by a revoting.  If this ends with another tie, it is declared a deadlock and the person who is eliminated is the one with the most previous votes cast against them in previous Tribal Council ceremonies.\rBecause Samburu had never been to a Tribal Council ceremony prior to Day 9, a tie between Carl and Lindsey posed a problem.  The two of them were forced to go head-to-head in a nature/survival quiz about Africa with questions pulled from a Bush Guide given to all participants.  Lindsey won this Tribal Council quiz and Carl was eliminated.  Another tie would occur on Day 18 between Lindsey and Tom. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 13, how many members of each team ended up switching sides, joining the opposing tribe?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["One", "Four", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tOn Day 13, teams received a game-changing surprise.  Checking their tree mail, tribes needed to send three members back to where they were dropped off at the beginning of their stay in the savannah.  Here, they were told to give up and switch their team buffs; Silas, Frank, and Teresa became members of Boran while Kelly, Tom, and Lex became members of Samburu. From this point onward, alliances would be shifted and the entire game dynamic would change.  It would take another two Immunity Challenges before the teams would merge but before this could happen, each team would lose once, destroying an earlier alliance in the wake of the swap. \n"}, {"text": "When the Samburu and Boran tribes merged on Day 20, they became a ten-person tribe known by what name?", "correct": "Moto Maji", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoto Maji.\n\n\tMoto Majo, the words for 'Fire' and 'Water' in local languages, was formed at the seventh Immunity Challenge of the game on Day 20.  For this challenge, the first individual Immunity of the game, the tribe members needed to partake in an endurance challenge; Teresa became the winner of this first one leading the strong participant, Clarence, to his ejection before the jury formation.  When they were created, Moto Maji was given green buffs and told to give up their old gold and red ones. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 25, the final eight tribe members were asked to pair up for a Reward Challenge.  What movie was screened during their reward?", "correct": "Out of Africa", "options": ["The Lion King", "The Gods Must Be Crazy", "The African Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOut of Africa.\n\n\tDay 25's challenge forced the Moto Maji team members to choose partners (which they randomly drew) for a battle.  For the challenge, teams completed in heats through an obstacle course involving wall climbs, ladders, and a large timber structure.  For the winners, a screening of the famous film \"Out of Africa\", filmed in the very nature reserve in which this season of \"Survivor\" was set. They would also have unlimited refreshments (popcorn, candy, pop, and hot dogs) to enjoy during their night under the stars.  To much surprise, Frank and Brandon won the challenge despite their typical incompatibility. \n"}, {"text": "In previous seasons of \"Survivor\", castaways were given meals of rice to survive on.  What was the staple food used in \"Survivor: Africa\"?", "correct": "Cornmeal", "options": ["Soup mix", "Flour", "Saltines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCornmeal.\n\n\tCornmeal, a basic food item affectionately referred to as gruel by the Survivors, was given to both teams from Day 1 and soon fell out of favour when the castaways realized that it would need to be rationed and it would soon become repetitive.  Luckily, many of the tribe members were able to even out their mush intake with rewards throughout the competition. On Day 28, shortly after discovering their own lethargy, the tribe attended a \"Survivor\" auction for their Reward Challenge and everyone remaining was allowed to bid on normal food.  Nonetheless, all of the tribe members, four weeks into the game, recognized how much weight they lost and how much their bodies had suffered. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Survivors was not part of the final voting jury?", "correct": "Silas", "options": ["Teresa", "Frank", "Brandon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilas.\n\n\tThe seven-person jury voting for the Sole Survivor consisted of Kelly, Brandon, Frank, Kim P., Teresa, Tom, and Lex, all of whom were voted off in successive Tribal Council ceremonies.  Silas was not part of the jury because he was the fifth Survivor voted out of the game, shortly after the team swap occurred and he was deemed too untrustworthy by the Boran tribemates.  The majority of the jury members consisted of Samburu members, surprisingly. \n"}, {"text": "The winner of the final Reward Challenge, Lex, won which type of car made by Chevrolet?", "correct": "Avalanche", "options": ["Aztec", "Porsche", "Element"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvalanche.\n\n\tOn Day 35, teams competed in their final Reward Challenge shortly after receiving personalized mail from their families.  For their task, they needed to complete a wordsearch and letter puzzle which, when unscrambled, would form the word 'AVALANCHE'.  Lex won the challenge, winning a Chevy Avalanche truck as the final reward.  He was also granted the chance to drive medical supplies to the local Wamba Hospital, supporting HIV efforts.\rThis was the second \"Survivor\" season in which a car was used for the final Reward Challenge-- the first season gave a car to winner Richard Hatch, but not in a challenge.  He won it for winning. \n"}, {"text": "Which participant became the Sole Survivor and million dollar winner of \"Survivor: Africa\"?", "correct": "Ethan & Ethan Zohn & Zohn", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEthan & Ethan Zohn & Zohn.\n\n\tIn the end, Kim J. voted Lex out during the penultimate Tribal Council leaving herself and Ethan as the final two Survivors in the African savannah.  On the evening of Day 39, the two of them packed their things and walked to the final Tribal Council to face off against the seven jury members, each casting their own vote.  In the end, Ethan became the Sole Survivor by securing the votes of Lex, Tom, Teresa, Frank, and Kelly, winning five to two over Kim J.'s votes from Brandon and Kim P. \n"}]}
