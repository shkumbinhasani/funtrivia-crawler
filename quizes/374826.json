One of the great Flemish painters of the Baroque era, he also became the dominant influence on English portrait painting for the next century and a half. \n"}, {"text": "Born March 24, 1909 near Dallas, Texas, he committed his first murder with a lead pipe whilst in prison. Released in 1932, he became one of America's most notorious bank robbers. Whose weapon of choice was the Browning Automatic Rifle? ", "correct": "Clyde Barrow", "options": ["John Dillinger", "Baby Face Nelson", "Al Capone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClyde Barrow.\n\n\tHe was born Clyde Chestnut Barrow near the small town of Telico in Ellis County, Texas, just southeast of Dallas. First sent to prison in 1930, he was paroled after 22 months despite killing a fellow inmate who had assaulted him.\rBarrow had met Bonnie Parker just before he went to jail. In August 1932, they killed the first of nine lawmen that would die during the pair's 2-year crime spree. \rThe couple were ambushed and killed by a posse of four Texas lawmen on May 23, 1934, on a rural road in Bienville Parish, Louisiana. Bonnie and Clyde were shot more than fifty times -- officers were taking no chances! Both John Dillinger and Pretty Boy Floyd sent cards and flowers to Bonnie Parker's funeral. \n"}, {"text": "Born March 26, 1911 in Columbus, Mississippi, he is considered one of the most important American playwrights of the 20th century. Twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, who shot to stardom with his 1944 play \"The Glass Menagerie\"?", "correct": "Tennessee Williams", "options": ["Eugene O'Neill", "Arthur Miller", "Thornton Wilder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTennessee Williams.\n\n\tBorn Thomas Lanier Williams III in the eastern Mississippi city of Columbus, Tennessee Williams won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in in 1955 for \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\". \rWilliams died in controversial circumstances in New York City in 1983 at the age of 71. Despite his expressed wish to be buried at sea, his brother insisted that he should be buried in Saint Louis MO. He bequeathed his future royalties to the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, where the funds support a creative writing program. \n"}, {"text": "Born March 29, 1867 in Gilmore, Ohio, he pitched for five different teams in a Major League Baseball career that lasted from 1890 until 1911. Whose pitching records including most wins, most starts and most complete games still survived as the best of all time a century after his career finished?\n", "correct": "Cy Young", "options": ["Walter Johnson", "Christy Mathewson", "Grover Cleveland Alexander"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCy Young.\n\n\tHe was born Denton True Young in eastern Ohio and made his Major League debut for the Cleveland Spiders in 1890. Nine seasons in Cleveland, two with the St. Louis Perfectos were followed by eight seasons with the Boston Americans/Red Sox. He returned to Ohio in 1909 and played two seasons with the Cleveland Naps before finishing his career with the Boston Rustlers in 1911. \rYoung was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. The year after his death in 1955, the Cy Young Award for the previous season's best pitcher was established.\rIn an era when pitchers now pitch every five days (rather than every other day in Young's day) and 300 wins is considered a Hall of Fame career, Young's record of 511 wins is unlikely ever to be surpassed. Hall of Famers Walter Johnson (417 wins) and Grover Cleveland Alexander and Christy Mathewson (both with 373), all pre-WWII pitchers, have come closest. Warren Spahn (363), Greg Maddux (355) and Roger Clemens (354) were the post-war pitchers with the highest totals a century after Young's career finished. \rOther records that still stood a century later are 7,356 innings pitched, 815 games started, 749 complete games and 25 1\u20443 consecutive hitless innings pitched. Of those, only the last record seems to be even vaguely within the reach of pitchers in the modern game. (Nolan Ryan played for 27 seasons and pitched until the age of 46 and still started 'only' 773 games, still 42 short of Young's record.) At 316, Young also lost more games than any player in history -- perhaps an unwanted record that he will also never lose. \n"}, {"text": "Born on April 1, 1815 in the city of Sch\u00f6nhausen, near Stendal in Prussia, he was a statesman for more than 30 years, dominating European affairs and engineering a series of wars. Who, in 1890, was created as the last Duke of Lauenburg, a once Danish duchy dating back to the 13th century?", "correct": "Otto von Bismarck", "options": ["Franz Josef I of Austria-Hungary", "Konrad Adenauer", "Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOtto von Bismarck.\n\n\tHe was born Otto Eduard Leopold Bismarck on a wealthy family estate to the west of Berlin in the Prussian province of Saxony. Before the 1860s, Germany consisted of numerous principalities loosely joined as members of the German Confederation. Using both diplomacy and the Prussian military, Bismarck achieved unification. Defeats of Denmark, Austria and France left Prussia as the most powerful and dominant component of the new nation state, and of mainland Europe. In 1871, Bismarck was appointed as the first Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire, a position he would hold for the next two decades.\rHe died at the age of 83 in 1898. \n"}, {"text": "Born April 2, 1805, he was a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems but is best-remembered for his stories for children of all ages.

Who was the first person named to the post of British Poet laureate during the reign of Queen Victoria?", "correct": "William Wordsworth", "options": ["Alfred, Lord Tennyson", "Henry James Pye", "Robert Southey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Wordsworth.\n\n\t\"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud...\" William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor-Coleridge launched English literature's Romantic Age with the publication of \"Lyrical Ballads\" in 1798.\rAt the age of 28, in 1798, Wordsworth began work on his greatest epic, an autobiographical conversation work that he simply referred to as \"The Poem\". Today it is widely known as \"The Prelude\" or, to give it its full title, \"The Prelude or, Growth of a Poet's Mind; An Autobiographical Poem\". Wordsworth worked on it for the rest of his life and it was finally published after his death in 1850. His widow, Mary, gave the piece its title.\rWordsworth followed Robert Southey as Poet Laureate in 1843, the first person appointed to the post during Victoria's reign. \n"}, {"text": "Born April 9, 1806 in Portsmouth, England, he was an engineer known for building dockyards, railways, steamships, bridges and tunnels. Who was this man who revolutionized British transport during the Industrial Revolution?", "correct": "Isambard Kingdom Brunel", "options": ["George Stephenson", "Charles Babbage", "Humphry Davy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel.\n\n\tIsambard Kingdom Brunel was voted into second place in a 2002 BBC poll of \"100 Greatest Britons\", behind only Sir Winston Churchill. \rBrunel is perhaps best remembered today for the Clifton Suspension Bridge, a 1,352-foot bridge across the Avon Gorge in Bristol. When it was completed in 1864, it had the longest span of any of the world's bridges. It has also stood the test of time, with more than four million vehicles still crossing annually more than 150 years later.\rHe also established the Great Western Railway: he designed London's Paddington Station as the line's eastern terminus, and built impressive viaducts and huge tunnels (including the world's longest railway tunnel at the time). Even before GWR was completed, Brunel sought to extend the service by building iron-hulled steam-powered ships to carry passengers across the Atlantic Ocean to New York. He developed the \"SS Great Britain\", the world's first propeller-driven ocean-going iron ship and, in 1834, the largest ship ever built.\rBrunel died of a stroke in 1859 aged just 53. \n"}, {"text": "Born April 13, 1743 near Charlotteville in Virginia Colony, British America, he was one of the world's great statesmen and a \"Founding Father\" of the U.S.A. Who sent out the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the 'new west', effectively doubling the size of the United States?", "correct": "Thomas Jefferson", "options": ["James Madison", "George Washington", "John Adams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThomas Jefferson.\n\n\tThomas Jefferson was the principal author of the American Declaration of Independence, the country's first Secretary of State, its second Vice-President and its third President. He took office as President in March 1801 and, in 1803, managed the acquisition from France of the enormous Louisiana Territory. The Lewis and Clark Expedition (or the \"Corps of Discovery Expedition\"), set out on their 27-month journey from Saint Louis, Missouri to the Pacific Coast and back in 1804. They were charged with mapping the country's newly acquired lands, finding a practical route to the West Coast, and establishing an American presence before European powers began claiming what Jefferson saw as American territory.\rIt is fitting, perhaps, that Jefferson died on July 4, American Independence Day, in 1826 at the age of 83. Remarkably, America's second President, John Adams, died on the same day at the age of 90 and, five years later, the country's fifth President, John Monroe, would also die on the same date. \n"}, {"text": "Born on April 16, 1924 in Cleveland, Ohio, he won four Oscars, a Golden Globe and twenty Grammy Awards.

He won 20 times, including the first ever \"Album of the Year\" award (for his theme to the \"Peter Gunn\" TV series). He was also honored with a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995, a year after his death at the age of 70. \rHe was nominated 18 times for an Academy Award, winning four times: for \"Victor Victoria\" in 1982, for the song from \"\"Days of Wine and Roses\" in 1962, and twice for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" in 1961 (for best score and best song). \n"}]}
