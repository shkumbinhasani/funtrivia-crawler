The anvil and the hammer are both kept hot and the piece of metal to be shaped is usually put in a forge to get it hot and to soften it and make it easier to work. The anvil is not a simple block of metal, it has different shapes on each side which are used as molds on which to shape the hot metal.On one side is a conical shaped horn which is used when hammering curved pieces of metal. It also has holes on the top so that holes can be punched into the metal being worked if it is needed. The first metal anvils were made of bronze, and then cast iron.Today, most anvils are made from steel, which is stronger and less likely to become brittle over time. The anvil is one of the blacksmith's most important pieces of equipment and was often handed down from father to son. \n"}, {"text": "For many centuries, blacksmiths often used a striker. Which of the following is the best definition of a striker? ", "correct": "An apprentice who swung huge sledge hammers at metal being held by the blacksmith", "options": ["A small mallet used to hammer gold into paper thin sheets", "A long tool with a cup on the end that was used to melt metal", "The name black smoke and embers that clouded the air in the workshop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn apprentice who swung huge sledge hammers at metal being held by the blacksmith.\n\n\tA striker was usually anapprentice who would swing a large sledge hammer at hot metal being held on the anvil by the blacksmith. This part of the learning experience helped develop the necessary strength needed for this occupation. The striker was used at the beginning of a job when there was a large piece of metal to be flattened. Smaller pieces were usually handled by the blacksmith alone. \n"}, {"text": "Most of the blacksmith's work involved the use of which of the following metals?", "correct": "Iron", "options": ["Magnesium", "Aluminum", "Lead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIron.\n\n\tA blacksmith usually did his work using iron. It was much more plentiful, stronger, and more practical than the other options listed. Iron was often referred to as \"black metal\" and it is from this term that the word blacksmith arose. The blacksmith's shop was usually very hot due to the fires and the steam from hot metal enveloping the room.The blacksmith himself was often covered in black residue from the smoke and ashes in the air. Blacksmiths were often strong men as strength was necessary for their type of work. Unfortunately, blacksmiths were often prone to developing respiratory diseases due to the conditions in which they worked.Severe burns were also a constant hazard. \n"}, {"text": "What was the reason that a blacksmith's shop was kept very dark?", "correct": "It helped the blacksmith tell how hot the metal was", "options": ["It was thought to keep fire imps from invading", "It helped keep the fire burning", "Darkness helped keep the anvil hot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt helped the blacksmith tell how hot the metal was.\n\n\tThe blacksmith worked in a shop called a forge. The forge was deliberately kept dark in order to help the blacksmith judge how hot the metal was that he was working with. This judgment was made by observing the color of the hot iron. As iron is heated it changes color. It starts glowing red and then progresses to orange, then yellow, and then white. Blacksmiths usually worked with iron that had been heated to a yellow-orange color. Darkness helped the smith judge when the metal had become the correct temperature to work with, but had not become too hot. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following substances did the blacksmith alloy with iron in order to make steel?", "correct": "Carbon", "options": ["Silver", "Copper", "Zinc"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarbon.\n\n\tBlacksmiths would alloy carbon with iron in order to make steel. While bronze was sometimes used by blacksmiths it was not the preferred substance. Iron was cheaper and more plentiful. Steel was even harder and more resistant to fracture, but was less ductile, making it harder to work with. Steel was used for weaponry and required even more skill and finesse to work into the desired product.\r Until c. 1860 steel could not be mass produced and was very expensive. It was generally used only for relatively small items, such as knives and swords. Even cannon and the early rails for railroads were made of iron. \n"}, {"text": "The skills of the blacksmith were so misunderstood that during the Middle Ages, some European blacksmiths were put to death for practicing magic.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe darkness of the blacksmith's shop gave an air of mystery to the occupation.

These men of fire and metal were sometimes burned at the stake by those who believed that their skills were taught to them by the devil. \n"}, {"text": "The job of the blacksmith is an ancient one and is even mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (KJV).", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tTubalcain is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, Genesis 4:22 him as an \"instructor of every artificer in brass and iron\" (KJV).

One of the most important jobs of a blacksmith was the making of horse shoes and wagon parts. As more people began to drive automobiles and the use of the horse as a beast of burden began to decline, the blacksmiths lost a large part of their income. The metal parts of an automobile were made by machine and did not require the expertise of a skilled blacksmith. The profession has never recovered and while there are still skilled blacksmiths plying their profession, they are few and far between. \n"}, {"text": "When nighttime came and it was time to close the shop, which of the following things was frequently done with the embers in the forge fire?

Being a blacksmith was a daytime profession. When the blacksmith closed his shop, he would often transport his fire to the closest bakery which used his forge fire to help heat their ovens while baking bread.It was common for a new bakery to be built close to the blacksmith's shop for this reason. Fire was at one time, a commodity that was necessary for cooking, heating, and other crafts. There were no matches, lighters, or other cheap and easy means of starting a fire.Fires were kept burning and were often shared between businesses. In the morning the blacksmith would show up at the bakery and take some of the burning embers to his shop to start the fire that would burn throughout the day while he worked.  \n"}]}
