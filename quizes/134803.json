{"id": "134803", "name": "University of Utah Basketball Quiz | College Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "  College Sports", "   NCAA Basketball"], "questions": [{"text": "Has the Utah men's basketball team ever won the NCAA Division I men's basketball championship?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tYou're darn tootin'!  The Utes first national championship (in any sport) came in 1944 when they defeated Dartmouth by a score of 42-40 in overtime in the final game.  The interesting thing about this championship...the Utes had initially been invited to the NIT, where they lost their opening round game.  They were then invited to enter the NCAA tournament to replace a team that was unable to travel.  Talk about your lucky breaks! \n"}, {"text": "During the 20th century, in how many NCAA men's Division I basketball championship games did the Utah Utes play?", "correct": "2", "options": ["4", "0", "6"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tThe Utes of course played in the 1944 game and followed this up with an appearance in the 1998 championship game against Kentucky, where they lost 78-69...grumble!  The Utes were ahead at the half by 10 points, how heartbreaking for Utah fans... \n"}, {"text": "In which decade of the 20th century did the Utah Utes reach three Division I men's 'Final Fours'?", "correct": "1960s", "options": ["1970s", "1940s", "1990s"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1960s.\n\n\tThe Utes reached the Final Four in 1961, 1963 and 1966.  They placed fourth in all three tournaments (during that period there were runner-up games for the losers of the semifinal games in the tournament.)  Their only other Final Four appearances were in 1944 and 1998 during the 20th century. \n"}, {"text": "The Utah Utes have never won the men's National Invitation Tournament (NIT).", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tA prestigious program like Utah, never winning the NIT?  Think again!  The Utes won the NIT tournament in 1947, their only win in the 20th century.  This was during the coach Vadal Peterson era, the same coach who led the Utes to the NCAA championship in 1944. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the University of Utah Runnin' Utes only four time All-American player of the 20th century?", "correct": "Arnie Ferrin", "options": ["Vern Gardner", "Keith Van Horn", "Andre Miller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArnie Ferrin.\n\n\tArnie Ferrin, the hero of the 1944 championship team, was an All-American in 1944, 1945, 1947 and 1948.  Van Horn, Miller and Gardner were all two-time All-Americans, joined by Billy McGill.  All but Gardner were consensus All-Americans during one of their All-American seasons. \n"}, {"text": "During the 1960s, which of these pairs of Utah players were active?", "correct": "Jerry Chambers and Billy McGill", "options": ["Pace Mannion and David Cecil", "Arnie Ferrin and Vern Gardner", "Jeff Jonas and Jeff Judkins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJerry Chambers and Billy McGill.\n\n\tWhile Ferrin and Gardner were active in the 40s, Jonas and Judkins in the 70s, Mannion and Cecil in the 80s, Jerry Chambers and Billy McGill played heroic roles in the 1960s, both leading the Utes to Final Four appearances. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these star Utah players of the 1980s went on to play professional football with the Dallas Cowboys?", "correct": "Manny Hendrix", "options": ["Chris Winans", "Jerry Stroman", "Mitch Smith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nManny Hendrix.\n\n\tManny Hendrix was a classic guard for the 1980s, pulling off a number of memorable performances.  Unfortunately, he was a bit short for the NBA and opted to try his hand at football.  He played several successful seasons for the Dallas Cowboys at cornerback, the Runnin' Utes version of Bo Jackson! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Utah Ute players did not go on to enjoy a successful professional career in the NBA?", "correct": "Josh Grant", "options": ["Tom Chambers", "Keith Van Horn", "Andre Miller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJosh Grant.\n\n\tJosh Grant was a star Utah Ute player during the early 1990s, but never had the stuff to make it in the NBA.  Tom Chambers scored over 20,000 points while playing with the Seattle Supersonics, the Phoenix Suns and the Utah Jazz in the NBA.  Keith Van Horn was drafted by the New Jersey Nets and played several seasons with them before being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, where he waits around for Allen Iverson to decide to pass. Andre Miller was drafted by the hapless Cleveland Cavaliers, where he languished (in fine fashion) until being traded to the equally hapless Los Angeles Clippers.  Andre has posted spectacular stats for these two teams, but failed to reach the playoffs at either locale.(Come back to Utah, Andre!) \n"}, {"text": "Who coached the University of Utah Runnin' Ute men's basketball team during the entire decade of the 1990s?", "correct": "Rick Majerus", "options": ["Vadal Peterson", "Jerry Pimm", "Jack Gardner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRick Majerus.\n\n\tRick Majerus, that boisterous but easily agitated fellow, led the Utes to the NCAA tournament nearly every season during the 1990s, including the finals season of 1998.  Peterson was coach during the 1940s, while Jack Gardner did his coaching in the 1960s (the only coach to lead two different schools to the final four twice each -- Utah and Kansas State) and Pimm in the 1970s-80s.  The magnificent, rotund Majerus was an assistant coach with Al McGuire at Marquette before coaching at Ball State and Utah. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Utah Ute greats did not have his number retired?", "correct": "Tom Chambers", "options": ["Keith Van Horn", "Danny Vranes", "Billy McGill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Chambers.\n\n\tUp to and including the 2002-3 season, only five Utah players had had their numbers retired: Danny Vranes, Billy McGill, Arnie Ferrin, Keith Van Horn and Vern Gardner.  I was in attendance the night that Van Horn's number 44 was retired (January 29, 1998)...how exciting!  I hope you enjoyed this quiz...and go Utes! \n"}]}
