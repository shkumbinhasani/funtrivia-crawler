{"id": "332692", "name": "Gorgeous \"Black Ops\" Kill Streak Rewards Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Call of Duty Games", "Call of Duty: Black Ops"], "questions": [{"text": "Similar to the UAV in \"Modern Warfare 2\", this default kill streak reward requires three kills (or two with the \"Hardline\" Perk. What is it called in \"Black Ops\"? ", "correct": "Spy Plane", "options": ["LOC-XD", "Radar", "Drone Wave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpy Plane.\n\n\tThe Spy Plane in \"Black Ops\" is the first default kill streak reward. It displays the enemy as red dots on the mini-map but with a slight delay, except if they have the \"Ghost\" perk equipped. The Spy Plane can be shot down by the enemy and can be countered by the Counter Spy Plane the Reward for a four kill streak (or three with the Hardline Perk). The Spy-Plane is extremely useful in Free-for-All matches as an accessory to furthering one's kill streak. \n"}, {"text": "A new kill streak reward in \"Black Ops\" is a small-remote controlled car booby-trapped with explosives, and this is also a three kill streak (or two with \"Hardline\"). What is it called?", "correct": "RC-XD", "options": ["RX-CD", "RD-CX", "RX-DC"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRC-XD.\n\n\tThe Remote Control Explosive Device or RC-XD is a controllable kill streak in \"Black Ops\". It is relatively easy to drive and will explode at the players will. However, if the player does not detonate it in a given time period, it will self-destruct. The upsides of this kill streak reward is that it can kill more than one enemy at detonation, which is impressive for a low three kill streak; however, the main downside is that the user is vulnerable to death while controlling it. \n"}, {"text": "Although there are some kill streak rewards that are completely new, some are very similar to their \"Modern Warfare 2\" counterparts. The eight Kill Streak Reward \"Rolling Thunder\" can be best linked to which \"Modern Warfare 2\" Kill Streak reward? ", "correct": "Stealth Bomber", "options": ["Pave Low", "Emergency Airdrop", "Harrier Strike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStealth Bomber.\n\n\tThe \"Rolling Thunder\" kill streak reward, very similarly to the \"Stealth Bomber\" (a nine kill streak reward) is a B-52 carpet bombing airstrike that can easily achieve multi-kills. However, due to its large bombing radius the player must be careful, as a user can be killed by his own B-52. This kill streak reward is particularly effective in Ground-War gameplay, where the increased amount of players would allow for even heavier multi-kills. \n"}, {"text": "The transition between \"Modern Warfare 2\" and \"Black Ops\" kept some fan favourite kill streak rewards almost exactly as they were before. How many kill streak rewards have the exact same name in both games? ", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Eight", "Two", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tThese 4fourare the Care Package (Five Kill Streak instead of four), Sentry Gun (Six Kill Streak instead of five), Attack Helicopter (Seven Kill Streak in both games), and Chopper Gunner (Nine Kill Streak instead of eleven). The fact that the Chopper Gunner requires two less kills is misleading, as it is harder to call in in \"Black Ops\", because kills achieved from kill streak rewards do not add towards getting another.(In other words, all nine kills must come directly from the player, as opposed to \"Modern Warfare 2\", where getting a Predator Missile often leads to a Chopper Gunner. I'll stop talking now.)  \n"}, {"text": "In Black Ops, the absence of death streaks creates a new function for \"Hardline Pro\". Which kill streak reward does this pro version improve?", "correct": "Care Package", "options": ["Napalm Strike", "Death Machine", "Mortar Team"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCare Package.\n\n\t\"Hardline Pro\" allows the player to substitute his Care Package for another one if he does not like the result. Although this is a gamble, a player who receives ammo or a low kill streak reward has another chance. The pro perk will never send back the same type of kill streak reward, so an ammo crate will certainly be improved! Be aware that the time this consumes can be harmful as enemies can track down the player and steal the new Care Package. \n"}, {"text": "The Highest kill streak where a reward is given is eleven. A player skilled and lucky enough to achieve this feat has two great rewards to choose from. One is piloting an attack \"Gunship\"; what's the other?", "correct": "Attack Dogs", "options": ["AC-130", "Attack Tigers", "Invisibility Cloak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttack Dogs.\n\n\tMany who do not play \"Black Ops\" regularly might wonder \"Dogs? - That's the best they can come up with?\" I assure you these are no ordinary dogs. They attack in numbers and kill in one bite. They are fast and merciless and they are well worth an 11 Kill Streak. The dogs can be killed by knifing or bullets, but will continue to re-spawn until the time allotted for the Kill Streak Reward is over. Like the Chopper Gunner, Rolling Thunder, and Gunship, these beasts are best unleashed in a Ground-War match. Unfortunately, there are no attack tigers...yet. \n"}, {"text": "This seven kill streak reward bears a slight similarity to the Predator Missile in \"Modern Warfare 2\". Upon getting seven kills, the proud owner throws a marker on the ground, and a package is dropped carrying two what?", "correct": "Valkyrie Rockets", "options": ["Flamethrowers", "SAM Turrets", "Sentry Guns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nValkyrie Rockets.\n\n\tThe Valkyrie Rockets can be fired from the shoulder into the sky, and then back down at enemies, who will be marked with Red Squares, unless using \"Ghost Pro\". They will explode at the launcher's will, or after collision with any walls or rooftops. The player has two chances to get as many kills as possible with the rockets, but if he is killed after using only one, the second is not available. Since this is a user-controlled kill streak reward like the RC-XD, it will leave the player vulnerable. \n"}, {"text": "If you're one of those exceptional team players, you're probably going to equip this eight kill streak instead of Rolling Thunder, but what exactly is the Blackbird?", "correct": "An advanced radar that shows the exact position and direction of enemies in real time on the mini-map to all teammates.", "options": ["A health regeneration airdrop that doubles the health of the entire team for 60 seconds.", "An electromagnetic pulse, similar to the EMP in \"Modern Warfare 2\" that disables enemy air support and electronics.", "A jet that provides every team member with a random Care Package, except the person who called it in, who gets two."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn advanced radar that shows the exact position and direction of enemies in real time on the mini-map to all teammates.\n\n\tThe Blackbird is an SR-71 jet, acting as a high-level radar, and the only form of air support or kill streak reward in \"Black Ops\" that cannot be destroyed by the enemies for its entire duration. It shows the enemies as red arrows moving in real-time, similarly to how a player would view his teammates in multi-player. The SR-71 is a very selfless kill streak reward, as it gives the entire team an overwhelming advantage. It is best used in kill-oriented games such as Team DeathMatch rather than objective games, although it very powerful in both. \n"}, {"text": "Like in \"Modern Warfare 2\" the player can only have on three kill streak rewards at any given time.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThat's right. The game would be very unbalanced if there were more than three; however, as previously mentioned all kill streaks are only achieved by direct player kills (no help from previous rewards) in \"Black Ops\", so there is no secret formula to follow in order to maximize kill streak potential. The only exception to this statement could be the equipment of Spy Planes and Blackbirds, (and, less effectively, counter spy planes) which give the player an indirect advantage and may be the reason a higher kill streak reward is achieved.However, these are no different from certain perks or attachments available; therefore, a player must still earn every kill.\n"}, {"text": "This is the alternative five kill streak reward to care package, and fires flames from a directional airstrike. The flames keep burning for ten seconds after the original attack, and scorch curious enemies. ", "correct": "Napalm Strike", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNapalm Strike.\n\n\tThe Napalm Strike is extremely useful in objective-based games as it can forcibly keep enemies away from  bomb sites and flags for a short amount of time, which would be more than enough to ensure a capture or a planted bomb. It is similar to the six kill streak reward \"Precision Airstrike\" in \"Modern Warfare 2\". \n"}]}
