They call and admit their own fouls, and must not intentionally foul. This policy of sportsmanship is called what?", "correct": "the spirit of the game", "options": ["the sunshine policy", "da way ta play", "the golden rule"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe spirit of the game.\n\n\tThe rule works better than you might think.
