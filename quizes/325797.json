{"id": "325797", "name": "Do the Evolution Quiz | Pokemon Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Pokemon Games", " Pokemon Red/ Blue/Yellow"], "questions": [{"text": "Perhaps you'll become the most in touch with your starter Pokemon.  Which of these is not an evolution of a starter Pokemon from \"Pokemon Red, Blue, or Yellow\"?", "correct": "Pichu", "options": ["Blastoise", "Ivysaur", "Charmeleon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPichu.\n\n\tPichu was never introduced to the \"Pokemon\" series until later on (the \"Gold/Silver\" generation) and it was one of the first pre-evolutions of the \"Pokemon\" world.  In \"Pokemon Blue and Red\", the player will be given one of three Pokemon of their choice by Professor Oak: Squirtle, Charmander, or Bulbasaur (water, fire, and grass, respectively).  Each of these Pokemon has two additional evolutions.  Your rival will always have a Pokemon of your selection's weakness.\rSquirtle evolves into Wartortle and then into Blastoise, Charmander evolves into Charmeleon and then into Charizard, and Bulbasaur becomes Ivysaur and then Venusaur.  In \"Pokemon Yellow\", you receive a Pikachu (and Pikachus evolve into Raichus).  In this game your rival always begins with an Eevee. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Pokemon does not evolve?", "correct": "Lapras", "options": ["Ponyta", "Seel", "Growlithe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLapras.\n\n\tLapras (Pokemon #131 in the original series) is a large water-type Pokemon which has no evolutions.  Only seven Pokemon from the original trilogy have no evolutions or similarities to others (like Mewtwo would have to Mew).  Lapras is a water/ice-type Pokemon with comparatively high stats.  You can only catch a Lapras in water in most games though in \"Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow\", you can only obtain a Lapras from an NPC in the Silph Co. building in Saffron City. Teaching a Lapras Surf (HM03) would be recommended as the creature can carry players on its back.  Each of the other answers (Seel, Growlithe, and Ponyta) only have one evolution and are the lowest evolution of their chains. \n"}, {"text": "What Pokemon will only learn Splash and Tackle before evolving at level 20?", "correct": "Magikarp", "options": ["Goldeen", "Dratini", "Staryu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagikarp.\n\n\tMagikarp is an oddity.  This Pokemon is usually fished up with an Old Rod (though can be caught with others) and really can't put up much of a fight.  At level 15, it learns Tackle.  If a Magikarp is tossed into battle before this, it can't do a single thing.  Splash has no effect.  At level 20 though, Magikarp pulls a whole underdog thing and evolves into Gyarados, a water/flying-type Pokemon with many more-powerful attacks. Until then, however, Magikarp is a true 'fish out-of-water' Pokemon and does act that way.  You can find one in pretty much any body of water.  Gyarados, on the other hand, becomes more important in regards to the game's mythology and storyline in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" in the Lake of Rage. \n"}, {"text": "Wigglytuff evolves from which Pokemon using a Moon Stone?", "correct": "Jigglypuff", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJigglypuff.\n\n\tJigglypuff is found near the entrance to Mt. Moon (on the Pewter City side) in all three original games and while it is quite uncommon to find, it's quite the interesting creature.  Jigglypuff is one of the few Pokemon to make use of the Moon Stone (found in Mt. Moon) with the only other creatures to use the item in these games being the Clefairy (which evolves into Clefable), Nidorina (which evolves into Nidoqueen) and Nidorino (which evolves into Nidoking).  In later games, Skitty evolves into Delcatty with the same item. In \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", Jigglypuff was graced with a pre-evolution, Igglybuff, which evolves into Jigglypuff if it gets happy enough to do so.  In other words, to complete this chain of evolution, leveling doesn't really matter a whole lot. \n"}, {"text": "Four Pokemon in \"Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow\" can only be evolved through trading.  Which of these is one of them?", "correct": "Machoke", "options": ["Gastly", "Abra", "Geodude"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMachoke.\n\n\tOne of the more unique occurrences of evolution in these games are those Pokemon which must be traded to another player in order for their evolution to be spurred.  Only four Pokemon in the original three games required that this be done: Machoke (into Machamp), Haunter (into Gengar), Graveler (into Golem) and Kadabra (into Alakazam).  This can be done to these Pokemon at any level so long as they are already evolved from their first stages. If you do this, however, you'll need to wait until later levels before they learn their remaining attacks.  Later games added to this list of tradables though not extensively. This can be done with a Game Boy Link cable, or, in the case of later versions of the game, wirelessly. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Poliwag evolve into at level 25?", "correct": "Poliwhirl", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoliwhirl.\n\n\tPoliwag is an armless tadpole-type Pokemon that uses water-type skills and techniques.  Evolving at level 25 into Poliwhirl (a larger Pokemon, and with arms!), this Pokemon can evolve once more at any time if given a Water Stone, purchasable in the Celadon City department store.  In the \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" games, Poliwag was given an additional evolution option.  Rather than evolve the Poliwhirl form into Poliwrath, you can use the King's Rock item (and a trade) to evolve the creature into Politoed.  Of course, this is beyond the \"Red, Blue, Yellow\" days. \n"}, {"text": "Why wait?  Some Pokemon evolve without leveling at all!  Which Pokemon does not need to be a certain level in order to move to its next evolutionary stage?", "correct": "Gloom", "options": ["Drowzee", "Diglett", "Hitmonchan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGloom.\n\n\tGloom evolves from Oddish at level 21 and (in \"Red, Blue, and Yellow\") evolves into Vileplume with the use of a Leaf Stone.  All three of these are grass-type Pokemon though in the original three games, Oddish is not found in \"Pokemon Blue\" (Bellsprout is caught instead).  In later games, Gloom can also evolve into Bellossom using the Sun Stone.  In the original trilogy, evolutionary stones are easily bought in Celadon City's department store though there are other ways to get them.  Later games complicated the matter as players could pick up or fight for items that cause their Pokemon to level (ie. Onix into Steelix in \"Pokemon Gold and Silver\").\rDiglett evolves into Dugtrio at level 26, Hitmonchan does not evolve in \"Red, Blue, or Yellow\", and Drowzee evolves into Hypno at level 26 as well.  In later games, Hitmonchan (as well as Hitmonlee and Hitmontop) evolved from Tyrogue at level 20 depending on stats. \n"}, {"text": "Does Ditto evolve?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tDitto, across all games, is quite the cute little blob of unknown matter who can transform itself into any Pokemon it opposes.  With no gender, this Pokemon is very adaptable and can be tricky to use- after all, if you use a fire Pokemon against another fire Pokemon (for example) it can be a bit difficult to attack tactically. In later games, it's very useful for breeding Pokemon however in earlier games, it's a very simple creature found in the roads leading to Indigo Plateau.  No evolutions on this one!  A fair number of other Pokemon have the same lack of evolutions (Lapras, for example, or Kangaskhan). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not an evolution of Eevee found in \"Pokemon Red, Blue, or Yellow\"?", "correct": "Leafeon", "options": ["Flareon", "Jolteon", "Vaporeon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeafeon.\n\n\tIn my experiences, it takes a bit of tact to write an Eevee question.  It seems that almost every \"Pokemon\" game releases SEVERAL new Eevee evolutions.\rEevee is only obtainable by speaking to one person in a house in Celadon City.  Unless you trade or use the \"Pokemon Stadium\" (N64) Gym Leader Castle and a Transfer Pak, you will not have more than one Eevee without cheating.  That makes the choice harder.  Eevee will only level when given a specific item.  Water Stone creates Vaporeon, Fire Stone creates Flareon, and Thunder Stone creates Jolteon.  Leafeon didn't appear in games until \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" (along with Glaceon) while Espeon and Umbreon are found in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\".  If you play \"Pokemon Yellow\", your rival will begin with an Eevee which will randomly become one of the three original evolutions by the end of the game. \n"}, {"text": "Which Pokemon evolves at the highest level (of these choices)?", "correct": "Horsea", "options": ["Dratini", "Metapod", "Sandshrew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHorsea.\n\n\tHorsea, while quite the small water-type Pokemon, takes a darn long time to move on from its small form.  It takes level 32 before it evolves into Seadra.  In later games, Seadra can then evolve into Kingdra using a Dragon Scale (and trading).  Dratini is the first stage of a much lengthier evolution process. At level 30, Dratini becomes Dragonair.  The player must then wait until level 55 before Dragonair becomes Dragonite (Pokemon #149).  Sandshrew becomes Sandslash at level 22 while Metapod brings up the rear transforming into Butterfree at level 10.  Similarly, Kakuna evolves into Beedrill at the same level. Both pod Pokemon (and their earlier forms) are found in Viridian Forest very early into the game. \n"}]}
