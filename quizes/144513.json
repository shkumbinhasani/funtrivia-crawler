{"id": "144513", "name": "The Most Important 'L' People Trivia Game | Mixed People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", " Mixed People", " People by Surname"], "questions": [{"text": "This British doctor popularized antiseptic surgery among the medical community in Scotland and England, and eventually throughout the world.  What was the name of this very important man of medicine?  ", "correct": "Joseph Lister", "options": ["James Lind", "Charles Lyell", "Otto Lummer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoseph Lister.\n\n\tJoseph Lister's ideas on making surgery a much cleaner experience helped save millions of lives since his ideas became public in the 1860s.  Interestingly, Lister was not the first to develop these ideas.  Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweiss made very similar discoveries 20 years prior.  Unfortunately, Semmelweiss' ideas on asepsis were largely ignored, despite his having written extensively on the topic. \n"}, {"text": "Martin Luther, German scholar and clergyman, ignited one of the largest reformations in religious history.  At what German university did Luther study and teach?  ", "correct": "Wittenberg", "options": ["Oldenberg", "Ulm", "Heidelberg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWittenberg.\n\n\tMartin Luther received his Doctor of Divinity degree from Wittenberg in 1512, and subsequently became a professor there.  Earlier he had been ordained a Catholic friar, and had paid a visit to Rome in 1510.  There he saw first hand the corruption of the church hierarchy, and several years later started the Reformation by nailing his 95 Theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg.  His chief complaint was the sale of indulgences, but he complained of other corrupt practices as well. \n"}, {"text": "Lao Zi ( or Lao Tzu) is purported to be the founder of the native Chinese religion called Daoism (or Taoism).  What does Lao Zi's name translate as in English?  ", "correct": "Old Master", "options": ["Our Leader", "Enlightened One", "Ocean of Wisdom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOld Master.\n\n\tDaoism is an intriguing religion, replete with philosophical concepts that are very challenging for the mind to grasp.  Daoists are urged to seek a relationship with the natural world, and the chief ideal of the philosophical system is that of 'wuwei', which translates as 'do nothing'.  If you're interested in some heavy reading, try the 'Dao De Jing', a work for which Lao Zi has been assigned authorship. \n"}, {"text": "Certainly Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known as Lenin, played a huge role, for better or for worse, in the story of the 20th century.   The execution of which of Lenin's family members prompted the young man to become a revolutionary? ", "correct": "Brother Alexander", "options": ["Father", "Grandfather", "Wife Nadezhda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrother Alexander.\n\n\tIn 1887, when Lenin was only 17 years of age, his brother Alexander took part in an assassination attempt on the current Czar, Alexander III.  The plot failed and his brother was hanged.  Lenin eventually found himself imprisoned in the Siberian Gulag for three years, during which time he developed his political philosophy.  Eventually he was to lead the communist movement in Russia, and he helped popularize the ideas of Karl Marx throughout the world. \n"}, {"text": "18th century French scientist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier is often considered to be the 'Father of Chemistry' by members of that field.  Which of these is false about this great man of chemistry?    ", "correct": "He discovered the elements hydrogen and oxygen", "options": ["He was executed under the guillotine", "He first identified that water was a compound of hydrogen and oxygen", "He first identified that oxygen was necessary for combustion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe discovered the elements hydrogen and oxygen.\n\n\tAntoine Lavoisier is certainly one of the greats of chemistry.   Aside from his identification that water is comprised of hydrogen and oxygen (where were discovered by Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestly/Karl Scheele respectively), he was the first scientist to seriously challenge the now-defunct theory that combustion requires a mythical substance called phlogiston.  Lavoisier correctly determined that it was oxygen (a name which he bestowed upon the element), and not phlogiston, that was the essential element in the process of combustion.  Sadly, he was a victim of the French Revolution. \n"}, {"text": "Though initially not a scientist by trade, Dutchman Antony van Leeuwenhoek nevertheless established himself as one of the most important figures of the life sciences with his key discovery of microbes.  Is it true or false that Leeuwenhoek was the inventor of the compound microscope?  ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe compound microscope was invented nearly a century before Leeuwenhoek began his investigations into the microcosmic world, by the Dutch lens-maker brothers Hans and Zacharias Janssen.  Leeuwenhoek developed his simple microscope around 1675, though he was not a professional lens-maker.  Through sheer scientific curiosity, Leeuwenhoek made several wonderful discoveries, including the first human identification of bacteria, protozoa and spermatozoa.  Fortunately, Leeuwenhoek kept careful records of his observations, and his influence on future scientists is immeasurable. \n"}, {"text": "17th century Englishman John Locke may perhaps be the most important political philosopher in human history.   Which of the following was not an important philosophical work written by Locke?  ", "correct": "Critique of Pure Reason", "options": ["A Letter Concerning Toleration", "Two Treatises on Government", "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCritique of Pure Reason.\n\n\tJohn Locke's ideas have become nearly all pervasive in modern political society.  He helped popularize the idea that people should be allowed to freely exercise their religion, and for separation of church and state.  Locke also established many of the ideas that the American founding fathers placed in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution.  Rejecting the notion of the divine right of kings, his work was also very influential in the toppling of the French monarchy during the late 18th century.   He was a firm believer in the modern ideals of democracy...a man well before his time. \n"}, {"text": "Though this man only held the reigns of power in China for seven years, he was the founder of one of the great dynasties of world history.  He also could possibly be the first man of 'low birth' to conquer an empire.  Who was this founder of the Chinese Han Dynasty?  ", "correct": "Liu Bang", "options": ["Lin Biao", "Lao She", "Li Sao"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiu Bang.\n\n\tLiu Bang, who took the reign name Gaozu, was emperor of China from 202 to 195 B.C.  He founded the great Han Empire, an imperial dynasty that would last more than 400 years.  His liberalization of the strict legalist philosophy followed by the previous emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di, helped pave the way for the eventual establishment of Confucianism as the official state ideology. \n"}, {"text": "Along with Isaac Newton, this famous scientist is considered the discoverer of calculus, and his style of notation is the prevalent one still used today.  What was his name?  ", "correct": "Gottfried Leibniz", "options": ["Georges Lematre", "Jean Lamarck", "Joseph Lagrange"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGottfried Leibniz.\n\n\tLeibniz, a German philosopher and mathematician, was not only responsible for co-founding calculus, but also for developing a calculating machine, and for advancing the field of symbolic logic.  On top of this, he was a key influence on Enlightenment thinkers with his philosophical ideas, though Voltaire hated him greatly!  Leibniz also made contributions in geology and history during his fruitful life. \n"}, {"text": "Last, but not least on this list, is the 16th U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln.  Along with helping usher the United States through its most difficult period, he participated in ending the heinous practice of slavery in America.  When Lincoln started out in politics, with which political party was he affiliated?  ", "correct": "Whig", "options": ["Democrat", "Republican", "Free-Soil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhig.\n\n\tLincoln was a member of the Whig party when he became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1847.  With the Whig Party dissipating, Lincoln became a member of the newly formed Republican Party in 1854, partially basing this choice on the fact that the party had a strong anti-slavery faction.  His actions as president helped preserve the union, and assisted in the abolition of slavery.  Note: This was a difficult quiz to produce because of the sheer volume of great figures whose names begin with the letter 'L'.  Sadly omitted were such figures as  Jean Lamarck (biologist), Joseph Lagrange (physicist), Etienne Lenoir (inventor of the first practical combustion engine), Karl Landsteiner (pathologist), Louis XIV, and Carolus Linnaeus (botanist).  Any of these individuals might likely have made the top ten lists had their names started with different letters!  Thank you for playing, I look forward to your feedback/opinions.  Oh yes, and if you enjoyed this quiz, please play my other alphabetical quizzes much like it. \n"}]}
