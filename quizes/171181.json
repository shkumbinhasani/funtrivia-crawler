{"id": "171181", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Korean Surgeon' Trivia Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "Among the fresh wounded that arrive at the 4077th at the beginning of this episode is a North Korean doctor.  We discover that he is in fact a doctor by the fact that he has already diagnosed several of his fellow patients.  In the most serious case, the doctor suggests that the patient has intra-abdominal bleed, probably caused by which of these?", "correct": "Ruptured spleen", "options": ["Punctured lung", "Perforated intestines", "Burst appendix"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRuptured spleen.\n\n\tThe doctor's diagnosis is questioned by Frank Burns, but Hawkeye confirms his assessment, making the patient in question 'number one on the hit parade'.  When Frank complains jealously to Hawkeye about his favoritism of the Korean doctor Hawkeye responds, 'Ah, nerts to you!'  Hawkeye has stolen Frank's favorite word! \n"}, {"text": "In the operating room, despite his objections to treating a 'commie', it is Frank who completes the operation on the North Korean doctor.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tFrank is originally intended to treat the North Korean doctor's wounds, but he frightens his patient with his erratic behavior and callous comments.  The poor fellow requests that Hawkeye replace Frank as his surgeon, and both are more than willing to oblige his request. \n"}, {"text": "Following the O.R. scene, we see the Korean surgeon recovering in the post-op ward.  The patient in the bed next to him seems to be having trouble, and he is unable to summon the nurse (Margaret, in this case).  What seems to be the problem with his fellow patient?", "correct": "Labored breathing", "options": ["Bandages have loosened", "Convulsions", "External bleeding"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLabored breathing.\n\n\tThe Korean doctor, injured as he is, attempts to relieve this troubled patient by clearing his tracheotomy tube.  Margaret mistakes this effort, believing the doctor to be attacking the patient and she immediately sets upon the wounded doctor.  Margaret asks Radar to summon Frank, which he does quickly.  When Frank hears that Margaret wants him in the post-op he responds, 'Post-op?  Is she crazy?  Somebody will see us.'  For good measure, Radar wakes Hawkeye and BJ as well. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and BJ converse quietly with the Korean doctor while he rests in post-op.  They discover that he is indeed a surgeon, just like them, only working for the other side.  He claims to have been educated in medicine at which university in the United States?", "correct": "Chicago", "options": ["Yale", "Washington", "UCLA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChicago.\n\n\tHe was educated at the University of Chicago and interned at Cook County Hospital.  It's odd that so many of the Koreans who were educated in the United States on 'M*A*S*H' were trained in Illinois (like Henry Blake)...I wonder why? \n"}, {"text": "The Korean doctor suggests to BJ and Hawkeye that he would love to continue his work as a surgeon, which gives them an idea.  They decide to disguise him as a South Korean doctor, newly dispatched to the 4077th by I-Corps.  Radar is recruited in this secret operation.  What incentive is Radar given for this co-option?", "correct": "Participation in the nurses' annual physicals", "options": ["Knowledge of the location of a peephole in the nurses' showers", "A stack of Hawkeye's nudist volleyball magazines", "A six-day pass to Tokyo with recommendations at Hawkeye's favorite geisha house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParticipation in the nurses' annual physicals.\n\n\tInnocent little Radar -- his loyalty can always be bought by the suggestion of anything illicitly titillating.  Radar only needs to acquire a set of orders, I.D., dog tags and a uniform and his assistantship at the nurses' annual physicals is guaranteed. \n"}, {"text": "Radar's assistant in acquiring the necessities to transform this North Korean doctor to a South Korean will naturally be his operator friend Sparky.  What item does Hawkeye offer up as a bribe for Sparky?", "correct": "A solid gold Chinese watch", "options": ["A slightly used, army-green American jeep", "A trip for two to Honolulu", "A year's supply of aftershave lotion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA solid gold Chinese watch.\n\n\tApparently, the North Korean doctor is willing to give up his gold wristwatch in return for what he considers to be freedom.  Unfortunately, this does not seem plausible to me, not because the bribe is unlikely to work, but rather because I doubt he would have been able to hold on to such a bourgeois item, especially as a Communist officer.  He claims that his wristwatch has Chinese numbers on it...how exotic for Sparky! \n"}, {"text": "The North Korean surgeon's real name is Paik Syn, but for purposes of his South Korean disguise, he takes on which of the following names?", "correct": "Cho Won Ho", "options": ["Rho Woo Yung", "Sung Kiang", "Lee Hong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCho Won Ho.\n\n\tPaik Syn is loaded onto a bus which is to direct him to a POW camp, but is immediately spirited off the bus and into the VIP tent, where Klinger and Radar begin the disguise operation.  He is then presented to Colonel Potter as Captain Cho Won Ho 'board certified, Chicago, 1949'. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret visits Colonel Potter's office while the 'new' surgeon is being presented to the Colonel.  She is immediately suspicious, claiming to recognize the doctor.  He responds to Margaret by asking if she has ever visited a certain 'gin mill' in Seoul, but which one?", "correct": "The Pink Pagoda", "options": ["The Green Temple", "The Blue Mandarin", "The Red Palace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Pink Pagoda.\n\n\t'Captain Cho' asks Margaret if she recalls doing the tango with him at the Pink Pagoda, something which immediately puts Hot Lips on the defensive.  'Certainly not!' she responds.  I'm not surprised that Margaret is suspicious, claiming to have seen Captain Cho before, after all this same actor (Soon Teck Oh) seems to have appeared a half dozen times on 'M*A*S*H', all as different characters! \n"}, {"text": "After the first surgery session with the new Korean doctor, the scene shifts to outdoors, where Klinger, Radar and Frank encounter a jeep driven by two men claiming to be South Korean soldiers.  They request provision of some supplies, and use flattery to convince Frank to furnish them.  They thank Frank for his generosity, at which time Frank claims to be 'the _______________ of Korea.'  Which famous doctor's name goes in the blank?", "correct": "Albert Schweitzer", "options": ["Walter Reed", "David Livingstone", "Benjamin Spock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlbert Schweitzer.\n\n\tIn the earlier surgery session Frank suggests that there is something 'fishy' about Dr. Cho.  Hawkeye responds, 'You'd think there was something fishy about Albert Schweitzer.'  Frank suggests, 'There is! If he were a good doctor he'd be in Beverly Hills helping the wealthy.'  His later comment suggesting that he is the 'Albert Schweitzer of Korea' is a nice segue job by the scriptwriter! \n"}, {"text": "The Korean doctor recognizes that the two 'South Korean' soldiers are actually North Korean.  He recommends that they be given supplies and allowed to go.  Before they leave, however, they 'kidnap' which member of the 4077th?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Radar", "Klinger", "Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tThey don't so much kidnap Frank as he offers his own services to them, claiming that he is willing (as a 'famous' doctor) to lecture to the people at the South Korean hospital.  The North Korean soldiers see the benefit in taking Frank along with them, he might be of use at checkpoints along the road.  When they are done exploiting Frank, they force him out of the jeep, claiming that he is 'driving [them] crazy' and that they 'don't need a hostage that badly'.  'Go back to your camp, it's the best thing you could do for our side,' one of them exclaims. Meanwhile, Colonel Potter discovers the truth about 'Captain Cho', and puts an end to his stint at the 4077th as well. All's fair in love and war, they say.  Thank you for having tried this quiz, I hope that you enjoyed it and will try some of my other stuff. \n"}]}
