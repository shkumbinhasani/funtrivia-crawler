{"id": "81105", "name": "Later Alexandrian Scientists Quiz | Scientists & Inventors | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "Scientists & Inventors", " Scientists"], "questions": [{"text": "Hipparchus, perhaps the greatest astronomer of the ancient world, also first developed\nwhich mathematical discipline?", "correct": "Trigonometry", "options": ["Algebra", "Calculus", "Geometry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrigonometry.\n\n\tHipparchus was the first to observe and\rrecord the precession of the equinoxes, and also developed a system by which eclipses of\rthe moon and sun could be predicted. \n"}, {"text": "The herbalist Crateuas and Apollonius of Citium made what contribution to the scientific\nworld? ", "correct": "Scientific sketches", "options": ["Surgical developments", "Animal taxonomy", "Improvements on architectural design"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScientific sketches.\n\n\tCrateuas sketched plants with important medical applications\rwhile Apollonius sketched medical operations and systems of bandaging.  Crateuas' work\rinfluenced the surgeon Pedanius Dioscorides, who served in the Roman legions under\rNero.  Dioscorides' work provided the basis for botanical research during the Middle\rAges. \n"}, {"text": "The first recorded steam engine was described in a work by which Alexandrian scientist\nof the 1st century AD?", "correct": "Hero", "options": ["Junius", "Cleon", "Chares"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHero.\n\n\tHis simple steam engine is described in his work\r'Pneumatica'.  Unfortunately, few were interested in this contrivance, and the era of steam\rpower would have to wait another 17 centuries! \n"}, {"text": "Which Alexandrian scientist predicted that the sun, in certain circumstances, might be\nvisible even after it had dipped below the horizon?", "correct": "Cleomedes", "options": ["Sylvius", "Hippias", "Varro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCleomedes.\n\n\tHe made this prediction\rafter noticing the refracting effect that water has with light, and made the same\rprediction regarding the earth's atmosphere, suggesting he understood the distorting\reffects contained therein. \n"}, {"text": "Rufus of Ephesus, a medical writer of the 1st century AD, was the first to identify and\ndescribe which important part of the eye?  ", "correct": "lens", "options": ["retina", "optic nerve", "cornea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nlens.\n\n\tRufus named this item the\r'lens'...because it was shaped like a lentil. \n"}, {"text": "One of the last of the ancient Greek mathematicians, which fellow wrote the\n'Arithmetica', a work that contained the first systematic use of signs and symbols in\nalgebraic problems?  ", "correct": "Diophantus", "options": ["Hecateus", "Libavius", "Asclepiades"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiophantus.\n\n\tUnfortunately, Diophantus's work was essentially lost\rfor several hundred centuries, not appearing in print again until a Latin translation in\r1575. \n"}, {"text": "Hypatia is the only female mathematician of antiquity known to us.  Not only was she a\nprofessor of philosophy at Alexandria, succeeding her father, but also an experienced and\nadept writer on the subject of algebra.  Who was her father, the person she replaced as\nprofessor at the university in Alexandria?", "correct": "Theon", "options": ["Speusippus", "Callipus", "Lactantius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheon.\n\n\tHypatia was murdered by Christian\rfanatics in 415 AD, tragically cutting short the career of this Neo-Platonist philosopher and mathematician. \n"}, {"text": "What was the great mathematical and astronomical work of the ancient Egyptian scientist\nPtolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus) called?", "correct": "Almagest", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlmagest.\n\n\tThe Almagest provided the basis for\rthe Earth-centered theory of the universe, not conclusively disproved until the time of\rCopernicus.  The Greeks called this work the 'Megale Mathematike Syntaxis' (great\rmathematical composition) or 'megiste syntaxis'.  This name was shortened and\rtransliterated by Arabic scholars into 'Al-magiste', from whence we get the name\rAlmagest. \n"}, {"text": "Ptolemy described a number of different astronomical instruments within his Almagest. \nWhich of these instruments was used to measure the position of the moon? ", "correct": "Triquetrum", "options": ["Astrolabe", "Alidade", "Groma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTriquetrum.\n\n\tTriquetrum translates from the Latin as 'triangular'.  It could be used even when the moon\rwas in its various phases. \n"}, {"text": "Galen, a scholar of Pergamum during the 2nd century AD, provided a synthesis of the\nbiological and medical sciences that remained the basis for Western medicine for nearly\n1500 years.  One of the cornerstones of his theories regarding the human body was his\nbelief in bodily humors.  Which of these was not one of the four basic humors according\nto Galen?", "correct": "Lymph", "options": ["Phlegm", "Blood", "Choler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLymph.\n\n\tThe four were:  phlegm, blood, choler and melancholy.  Of the four, only blood proved to\rbe a true 'bodily humor'.  It really is a shame that Galen's work remained the authoritative\rsource in the life sciences for so long, most of it proved to be incorrect and misleading.
