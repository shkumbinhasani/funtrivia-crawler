After failing to force the ring from Frodo, Boromir helped make a desperate stand against the orcs who had come to kidnap Frodo and his fellow hobbits.  Boromir died in defense of his friends Merry and Pippin after having slain a great number of orcs.  Aragorn locates Boromir just before he dies and promises Boromir that Gondor will not fall.  Then, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli set Boromir's body into one of the elven boats, along with tokens of the battle (orc weapons, etc.).

The riders are also called Riders of the Mark at some points in the book, but not 'stewards'.  The Riders of Rohan have assisted in the cause of Aragorn and friends by destroying the orc troop that has kidnapped Merry and Pippin, but alas they could lend no information about the two hobbits. \n"}, {"text": "The leader of the riders, \u00c9omer, is generous with his friendship and his horses, lending two to our friends from the Fellowship.  \u00c9omer also tells of his previous dealings with Gandalf, whom he calls 'Greyhame'.

As orcs are wont to do, conflict and wanton killing are intermingled by internecine struggling, and in the process of the chaos one of the hobbits manages to get his hands free and to leave several clues for their friendly pursuers.  Is it Merry or Pippin who manages to drop hints for Aragorn to notice?  \n", "correct": "Pippin", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPippin.\n\n\tPippin manages to loosen the bonds on his hands and drops his elven-brooch, which Aragorn naturally finds.

This long-winded old fellow is delighted to meet the charming little hobbits, and fascinated by their news, though they always seem a bit too hasty.

Within the forest they find further evidence of the hobbits' presence, but fail to discover their final whereabouts.  Compounding this bad news, they suddenly encounter an old man robed in white and take him to be Saruman.  Of course, this is not Saruman, but rather it is Gandalf, now clad in pure white.

Rather than continuing on the quest to find Merry and Pippin, Gandalf suggests that he and the others now share another path, to release the King of Rohan from Saruman's evil clutches.  We also learn here of Gandalf's struggle with the Balrog, and of his rebirth.  The story is heating up! \n"}, {"text": "Gandalf and friends ride across Rohan directly towards the palace of King Th\u00e9oden.  Gandalf knows that Saruman has hold of the King of Rohan, and must first break the spell of the evil wizard over Th\u00e9oden if their cause is to have any hope against Saruman's army.

H\u00e1ma has his reservations, realizing that the staff of a wizard can be a dangerous tool, but he gives way...perhaps knowing the potential consequences of his action.  Needless to say, once inside the hall of the King, Gandalf removes the spell of Saruman and ousts Wormtongue.  Th\u00e9oden King has returned!
