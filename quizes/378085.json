Which one is not an ungulate?", "correct": "Snowshoe rabbit", "options": ["Grey's zebra", "Barbary sheep", "Rock hyrax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnowshoe rabbit.\n\n\tEven though the snowshoe rabbit (aka the snowshoe hare) may look like a hyrax, its feet are fleshy, not hoofed.

She was later stuffed and put on display.\r Irish champion Shergar was abducted at gunpoint in 1983.  A ransom was demanded but while negotiations were still ongoing, the kidnappers (thought to be the IRA) claimed to have killed him.  His body was never found.\r Babe the Pig was the female lead in an award-winning movie from the novel \"Babe: The Gallant Pig\" by Dick King-Smith.  Many people became vegetarians after viewing it.  \r Benjamin the Donkey is a character in \"Animal Farm\".

These animals have a temperament which makes them naturally a little aggressive to each other, mostly while disputing herd leadership. \r Their horn tips are blunted and if they don't want to fight they're not jabbed cruelly with lances ... in fact, unlike a traditional bullfight there is no matador and no \" Death in the Afternoon\" - if a cow is really not in the mood, it can just leave!  \rThe fights are mostly about pushing and shoving and a cow wins when her opponent backs down.\r Why do they do it then?  Prestige and value added to the cows and their calves.  Oh, and a new bell with a fancy leather collar for the victor! (question by avriljean) \n"}, {"text": "What species is the smallest of the even-toed ungulate class?", "correct": "Mouse Deer", "options": ["Camel", "Pig", "Hippopotamus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMouse Deer.\n\n\tThe mouse deer, also called chevrotain, was discovered by the French zoologist Henri Milne-Edwards in 1864.\r They give birth to only a single baby at a time.\r The various Asian species weighs anywhere from 1.5 to 17 pounds, and are significantly smaller than other even-toed ungulates.\r They have a four-chambered stomach and are mostly a vegetarian.

", "correct": "Quagga", "options": ["Horse", "Burchell's Zebra", "Hippopotamus "], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuagga.\n\n\tOnly one quagga was ever photographed, dying in captivity in 1883. More than 100 years later in 1984, that same animal was used as part of the Quagga Project as researchers tried to use selective breeding and DNA sequencing to bring the species back to life.\r Only 23 quagga hides are known to exist.   \r The Quagga Project used plains zebras and selective breeding to attempt to bring the species back, but after decades of trying, the project was deemed a mild success in 2005 when a quagga-like zebra was born in South Africa.

A human toenail is primarily made of keratin. \r The major difference is that an ungulate's hoof is designed to be weight bearing, while a human's nail is not. \r(question by parleydog) \n"}]}
