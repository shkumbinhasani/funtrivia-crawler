{"id": "199373", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Germ Warfare' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "In the post-op, the doctors of the 4077th assiduously attend to their patients.  One young man, who happens to be North Korean, has particular problems, including a dire need for more plasma.  Frank happens to share the young man's blood type.  Is it true that Frank initially offers to give blood until he finds out that the kid is 'the enemy'?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tFrank protests that the young North Korean soldier is being treated in the post-op, insisting that he be shipped to a POW hospital.  Hawkeye has other ideas, however, suggesting that the kid is still too ill to travel.  \r Regarding the blood situation, Frank is never even informed that he has the young man's same blood type.  What fun would that be? \n"}, {"text": "What type of blood, specifically, do Frank and the young North Korean soldier share?", "correct": "AB negative", "options": ["O positive", "B negative", "A positive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAB negative.\n\n\tThe two apparently have a relatively rare blood type, as Frank is the only one at the 4077th who has blood available for the young soldier.  Radar discovers this off a chart that he brings to the Swamp, and he happily shares this information with the doctors not named Frank. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Trapper go to Henry's office to plead the North Korean soldier's case.  Henry is a tough nut to crack, however, and initially refuses their requests.  Annoyed, Hawkeye refers to Henry as which of the following?", "correct": "Regular Army clown", "options": ["Attila the no fun", "Our gutless leader", "George Wishy-Washington"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRegular Army clown.\n\n\tThis phrase, regular army clown, is also used in the 'M*A*S*H' film by the Donald Sutherland version of Hawkeye when referring to Hot Lips (Sally Kellerman).  This seems to be a early season reference to the film that spawned the television show.\r Henry the 'regular army clown' turns out not to be such a bad guy, allowing the young North Korean to stay, so long as he is moved out of the post-op. \n"}, {"text": "With the North Korean soldier safely asleep in the Swamp, Trapper and Hawkeye work on getting him some of Frank's blood.  While Frank sleeps, the two other doctors transform him into an involuntary blood donor.  Hawkeye takes the occasion to impersonate which actor?", "correct": "Bela Lugosi", "options": ["Boris Karloff", "Peter Lorre", "Max Schreck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBela Lugosi.\n\n\tWith his most masterful Hungarian accent, Hawkeye impersonates Dracula, 'Good work, Igor.  Very good.  Tomorrow he will be one of my brides.'  Not quite as excellent as Martin Landau (from 'Ed Wood'), but then, Landau did win an Oscar for his performance.\r The two doctors are able to draw a full pint from the very generous Frank Burns. \n"}, {"text": "In a brief and ridiculous encounter in the mess tent, which nurse makes her second and last appearance at the 4077th (at least, televised)?", "correct": "Dish", "options": ["Cutler", "Baker", "Anderson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDish.\n\n\tLt. Dish, played by Karen Philipp, appeared in two episodes total, the pilot and 'Germ Warfare'.  In this episode, she sits across from Hawkeye as he describes to her is fantasies.  As he talks, the camera returns to Lt. Dish, who appears to be nude (only her shoulders up showing on camera, of course).  Cheesy and tasteless, yes...but good for a cheap laugh. \n"}, {"text": "Trapper locates Hawkeye in the mess tent and delivers some bad news.  The North Korean patient is suddenly showing symptoms of which disease, according to Trapper?", "correct": "Hepatitis", "options": ["Dysentery", "Cholera", "Typhoid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHepatitis.\n\n\tThe young man has severe abdominal pains, nausea, darkened specimen and can't keep a thing down.  Hawkeye suggests that this is a transfusion reaction, and Trapper adds, '[He has the] same symptoms as hepatitis.'  Frank's blood is suspected, though it is deemed unlikely. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Trapper suspect that Frank's blood may be tainted, and attempt to get a blood sample from him, but he refuses.  They then work up a plan to get some of his urine by giving him a beer 'taste test'.  How many cans of beer are presented for Frank to sample?", "correct": "3", "options": ["9", "5", "7"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tThe doctors present Frank with three beer cans, all apparently of the same variety.  Frank seems oblivious to this fact and is more than happy to become the dupe of his fellow surgeons.  After several drinks from each can, Frank is unable to determine which one is best...but he does need to use the latrine. \n"}, {"text": "After his brief beer taste test, Frank suddenly finds himself desperately in need of the latrine.  Unfortunately, Radar is nailing up a sign on the officers' latrine, claiming that it is closed for what purpose?", "correct": "Redecorating", "options": ["Quarantine", "Yom Kippur", "General Clayton's visit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRedecorating.\n\n\tThe sign Radar is nailing up says 'out of order', the young clerk claiming that the latrine needs 'redecorating'.  According to Radar, 'We had complaints the latrines lacked any aesthetic quality whatsoever, and it's essential we show the Koreans democratic plumbing in action.'  Radar then leads Frank to the 'temporary officers' arrangement'...a tiny teepee and a metal bucket. \n"}, {"text": "Frank's urine sample is sent off for lab analysis to determine if he has any illnesses.  In his only appearance in the television series, which character from the film version of 'M*A*S*H' is played here by Robert Gooden?", "correct": "Boone", "options": ["Painless", "Forrest", "Vollmer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoone.\n\n\tIn the film version, Private Lorenzo Boone was played by Bud Cort.  In this episode, Gooden plays Boone.  Theoretically, this could be a different Boone, but this is not likely given the fact that the episode makes several other references to the film, and it occurs during the first season. \n"}, {"text": "The results from the lab come back, and it turns out that Frank is free from any serious disease.  However, he has come down with what condition, according to Hawkeye?", "correct": "Anemia", "options": ["Glycosuria", "Hyperglycemia", "Uremia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnemia.\n\n\tHawkeye attributes Frank's anemia to the fact that the latter contributed so much blood, and he then calls Frank 'selfless'.  Frank is a sucker for flattery, and naturally enjoys this.  In the final scene of the episode, Frank plays checkers with the North Korean patient, and receives flowers from his Swamp-mates.  They had to keep it light during these early episodes.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
