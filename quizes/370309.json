{"id": "370309", "name": "\"World of Warcraft\" - Secondary Professions Online Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Warcraft Games", "World of Warcraft"], "questions": [{"text": "You've just been taught to use the Cooking profession.  What are you also able to use as a result?", "correct": "Cooking Fire", "options": ["Pots and Pans", "Microwave", "Sharp Knives"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCooking Fire.\n\n\tAs soon as you learn how to cook you're also granted the techniques required to make a Cooking Fire which can be done without any additional tools in your pack.  Fire is necessary if you plan to make any dish, and if you're not in town or at a camp, making your own can be a necessity.  Otherwise, using an actual hearth or a generic fire will do if you need to use something.  At the outset, when you become an Apprentice cook, you'll only learn how to make a minimal amount of things.  Start early, or you may find yourself strapped for ingredients as you travel. \n"}, {"text": "Eating food made with your Cooking profession can result in which of the following buffs?", "correct": "Well Fed", "options": ["Full Up", "Empowered", "Satitated"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWell Fed.\n\n\tWell Fed is a small buff, but it does help in big ways, especially the later in the game you get.  When your character eats food (bought or made) they'll end up taking on certain bonus attributes, usually for ten minutes (but occasionally taking as long as an hour).  Although Well Fed can be attained with any food, even if you don't make it, it's just another reason as to why levelling up your Cooking profession can be to your benefit.  The fast majority of personally-cooked meals will affect Stamina and/or health in some way. \n"}, {"text": "Great Feasts can only be created via Mage spells.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis used to be a truth, but changed over the course of expansions and builds.  Dropping a Feast can be a typical occurrence heading into a major raid simply because it buffs the party with adequate bonuses before major battles.  A Great Feast for instance, which requires a Cooking level of 375, will feed an entire raid group, heal health and mana, and raise stamina, attack power, and spell power.  You can learn it from a typical Cooking trainer.  At a higher level, Mages can learn Conjure Refreshment Table to eat mana food.  Same great taste, but is it ever really as good as the real thing? \n"}, {"text": "The First Aid profession starts you off making bandages of what material?", "correct": "Linen", "options": ["Runecloth", "Wool", "Mageweave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLinen.\n\n\tWhile all of these materials are used to make bandages over the course of the profession, Linen Bandages are the earliest and likely to be created in starter zones and the starts of any intermediate zones (so ranging from level 1-10 or 15.  The material upgrades to Wool, Silk, Mageweave, and Runecloth in the original \"WoW\" before moving on to materials dropped in later expansions.  Coincidentally, many of the materials needed for First Aid are also used in Tailoring, though for the latter, the cloth needs to be made into Bolts before being used for clothes. \n"}, {"text": "In which region of the game would you be likely to find Frostweave Cloth to be used for First Aid?", "correct": "Northrend", "options": ["Outlands", "Pandaren", "Draenor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorthrend.\n\n\tFrostweave, as makes sense, can be found in the northern reaches of the Azeroth map, specifically on the continent of Northrend as introduced in \"Wrath of the Lich King\".  Such bandages are particularly useful if you're levelling through your 70s as 80-85 takes you through \"Cataclysm\" zones (for Embersilk Bandages) and 85-90 takes you through Pandaren, the \"Mists of Pandaren\" region to the south (for Windwool Bandages).  In other words, it doesn't end at Runecloth. \n"}, {"text": "Aside from making bandages, First Aid also allows pursuers to create which of the following?", "correct": "Anti-Venom", "options": ["Quarantine Stations", "Healing Potions", "Feasts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnti-Venom.\n\n\tAlthough Anti-Venoms are low-level items which can be made early on in the First Aid track, they're often much harder to come by, mainly because of class skills and healing spells found throughout the game.  In fact, a basic Anti-Venom requires Small Venom Sacs to be created, and those simply aren't too common in all areas of the game.  You're much more likely to level up the profession with bandages.  A second and third Anti-Venom, the Strong and the Powerful Anti-Venom, can be made if you find manuals dropped or obtained in the game. \n"}, {"text": "Working on your Fishing Profession can only be done if you have a Fishing Pole equipped.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhile this was the case at one time, the profession was simplified a bit over time.  Now all you need to do is go to the edge of a boy of water, drop the lure, and click on the bobber when you think you have a bite.  Like actual fishing, the profession rewards patience.  Grinding this profession will take a great deal of time because unlike Cooking and First Aid, you can't simply purchase the necessary materials from the auction house.  Because of its lack of usability for battle and the like, Fishing is likely one of the least-used professions in the game. \n"}, {"text": "Archaeology was the fourth of the core professions to be introduced.  It was added during which expansion?", "correct": "\"Cataclysm\"", "options": ["\"Wrath of the Lich King\"", "\"Mists of Pandaria\"", "\"Warlords of Draenor\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Cataclysm\".\n\n\tWhile Cooking, First Aid, and Fishing have been around since the days of Vanilla \"WoW\", Archaeology became a main profession when it was introduced in \"Cataclysm\", mainly because the cataclysm itself provided an excellent opportunity for players to delve into world lore by unearthing treasures and fragments of the past at different dig sites.  By surveying the area, the player can determine how close they are to a point of interest (though only at a predetermined dig site) and follow their equipment to the buried treasure.  This can be done six times at every dig site. \n"}, {"text": "Up to how many times can you search for archaeological Fragments at a single dig site (in one visit)?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["One", "Four", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tAlthough dig sites re-emerge if explored and left alone for a while, you can stop by at any one marked in the orange blobs on the map to search for six packets of Fragments, usually of a type specific to that region (for instance, looking at Archaeological sites in Ashenvale will more than likely result in Night Elf Artifacts).  Once you've found six sets, usually of varying amounts of Fragments, you won'll be done at that site, completed Artifact or not, and need to dig up new ones elsewhere, at least until the site refreshes for you. In \"Cataclysm\", the maximum amount able to be dug up in one visit was three. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Archaeological artifact types was introduced the latest?", "correct": "Mogu", "options": ["Troll", "Dwarf", "Fossil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMogu.\n\n\tWhile Dwarf, Fossil, and Troll can all be found in early regions of the game having been unearthed during the \"Cataclysm\" expansion, Mogu Artifacts and Fragments first appeared during \"Mists of Pandaria\", ending up incorporated into daily quests along with Pandaren and Mantid types.  \"Mists of Pandaria\" ended up bringing the max level of Archaeology to 600 and would be a must-have skill for anyone pursuing the lore of \"Warcraft\".  With the \"Mists\" expansion, artifacts could be found on every continent investigating twelve different races. \n"}]}
