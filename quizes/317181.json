He also provides him with his first bottle of laudanum, a potent combination of alcohol and morphine (among other things) that was used as a painkiller at the turn of the century. This role was played by Jimmy Stewart, who John Wayne had previously worked with in the great western \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\". \n"}, {"text": "Books is directed by the doctor to go to the local boarding house to rent a room.
