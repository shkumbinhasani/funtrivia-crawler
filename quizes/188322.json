{"id": "188322", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'Fallen Idol' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 6 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "'Fallen Idol' was one of the most intense episodes of 'M*A*S*H' during the sixth season.  It involves several angry exchanges between two of the most beloved characters in the history of the series, Hawkeye and Radar.  Which of these individuals not only wrote the script for this episode, but directed it as well?", "correct": "Alan Alda", "options": ["Gary Burghoff", "Mike Farrell", "Henry Morgan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlan Alda.\n\n\tThis should come as no surprise to fans of 'M*A*S*H'.  Hawkeye wrote and directed some of the most thought-provoking episodes in the show's history, including 'Dear Sigmund', 'Comrades in Arms' (also from the sixth season) and the Emmy-award winning 'Inga'.  Alda was nominated for an Emmy for his writing on this episode, but did not win the award. \n"}, {"text": "The episode opens with Radar making the ordinary mail call rounds.  He reaches the Swamp after a rather stressful run-in with a towel-clad nurse.  Along with a letter from Hawkeye's congressman that smells like horse manure, Radar also has a letter for BJ that smells of...?", "correct": "Crayons", "options": ["Coffee", "Tapioca", "Crumb cake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrayons.\n\n\tRadar is greeted at the door of the nurse's tent by Lieutenant Perry, who is wearing only a towel.  She asks Radar if he 'has anything for [her]', to which Radar can only give a stuttering response.  Of course, she is only requesting her mail, but Radar has a penchant for misunderstanding individuals of the opposite sex.  \r Radar next delivers mail to the Swamp.  Hawkeye requests a letter that smells of lilacs, but only gets a letter from his congressman that was accidentally dropped in the Colonel's horse corral.  BJ receives an envelope from home that apparently contains notes from his wife and his baby daughter Erin...at least one of whom used a crayon. \n"}, {"text": "A frustrated Radar sits down with Hawkeye and BJ in the Swamp in order to confide with them his problems.  It seems that Radar isn't getting a lot out of his Korean experience.  Radar is hoping that he will become which of the following before leaving Korea?", "correct": "A hot lover", "options": ["A Casanova", "A devotee of women", "A boy toy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA hot lover.\n\n\t'I don't think that this place is turning out to be that great an experience for me,' says Radar.  He continues, 'I mean I work under terrible pressures, and there's lots of death and destruction and stuff, but other than that I don't think I'm getting much out of it.'\r Radar is hoping that the army will make a man out of him...hence the desire to become 'a hot lover' (or even a cold one, he doesn't care). \n"}, {"text": "After hearing of Radar's 'plight', Hawkeye makes a suggestion that Radar go and sow his wild oats.  He particularly recommends a place by which name in Seoul?", "correct": "The Pink Pagoda", "options": ["The Lotus Spring", "The Geisha House", "The Peony Pavilian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Pink Pagoda.\n\n\tRadar eventually accepts Hawkeye's advice and immediately leaves for Seoul, despite BJ's advice to the contrary.  Hawkeye will, of course, live to regret providing this advice to Radar.\r Incidentally, the Pink Pagoda is also mentioned in the season five episode called 'The Korean Surgeon'.  Apparently, this place must have been *the* spot in Seoul during the war. \n"}, {"text": "Radar heads for Seoul posthaste after receiving Hawkeye's 'sage' advice.  Somewhere along the road he is injured in a round of mortar fire.  Where on Radar's body has he been wounded?", "correct": "Shoulder", "options": ["Leg", "Abdomen", "Head"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShoulder.\n\n\t'What a dumb, stupid thing.  I sent him into the middle of a war on a date!' Hawkeye says, angrily, after examining Radar in triage.  Hawkeye insists that he will operate on Radar, and in the O.R. he demands quiet as he operates on Radar's shoulder (and partially, his chest).  \r Charles insists on knowing 'why we are being treated to this inordinant demand for silence?'  BJ responds, 'I'll explain that later Charles while I'm sitting on your chest so Hawkeye can beat you with both fists!' \n"}, {"text": "That evening, following successful surgery on Radar, Hawkeye goes on a bender.  The next morning, as a result of a heavy hangover, he is unable to continue in the O.R., walking out on a patient.  Who is forced to finish surgery on Hawkeye's patient so that the poor chap can 'throw up on Ouijongbou'?", "correct": "Charles", "options": ["Potter", "BJ", "Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles.\n\n\tAfter an evening at Rosie's bar, Hawkeye can hardly tell which way is up.  He and BJ return to the Swamp rather late (or early, if you prefer) and, as if on cue, the 4077th receives more casualties.  Hawkeye joins the other surgeons in the O.R., but before long he has to run outside to vomit, forcing Winchester to take over (but only after the Colonel insists!) \n"}, {"text": "Later that day, Hawkeye finally gets around to visiting Radar in post-op.  The two of them immediately have difficulties with each other, as Radar accuses Hawkeye of being irresponsible because of his actions in the O.R. earlier.  Hawkeye becomes very defensive and chides Radar for making his criticisms.  What name does Hawkeye call Radar during this rebuke?", "correct": "Ninny", "options": ["Jerk", "Punk", "Wimp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNinny.\n\n\tRadar makes it known that he is very disappointed in Hawkeye for letting him down, after all, Hawkeye is Radar's role model.  Hawkeye responds:\r 'Look, you can't lay all that on my shoulders.  Don't you know how much this place stinks?  Don't you know what it's like to stand day after day in blood?  In the blood of children?  I hate this place, and if I can't stand up to it to your satisfaction, then the hell with it.  How dare you?  The hell with your Iowa naivete and the hell with your hero worship and your teddy bear and while you're at it the hell with you!  Why don't you grow up for crying out loud?!  I'm not here for you to admire!  I'm here to pull bodies out of a sausage grinder, if possible, without going crazy!  Period!'  \r Radar has no response, except to begin crying, provoking Hawkeye to call him a 'ninny'. \n"}, {"text": "Several individuals angrily approach Hawkeye after learning of his excoriation of Radar.  Which of them is 'persuaded to violence'?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Colonel Potter", "BJ", "Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\t'I am incensed!  I am outraged!  Where's your decency man, your humanity?!  I'm acrimonious!  I'm not a man given to physical demonstrations of emotion, but let me tell you, I am persuaded to violence!' the good Father says.  Mulcahy proceeds to kick the stove in the Swamp, an act that he finds 'particularly unsatisfying', as it is 'entirely possible that [he has] broken [his] toe!'\r Colonel Potter and Margaret storm in after Father Mulcahy, both with angry speeches of their own.  Unfortunately, Margaret is unable to deliver her speech.  Hawkeye leaves to go speak to Radar immediately after the Colonel has his say, which includes the great phrase 'bellicose barrelfull of bull-durham'. \n"}, {"text": "After Hawkeye fails in an attempt to apologize to Radar (the latter ridicules the former for being a drunk), the two of them find themselves sitting next to each other in Rosie's bar.  Hawkeye suggests that it's okay if Radar 'worships the ground he walks on'.  Does Radar accept this offer?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tHawkeye: 'And if you really have to worship the ground I walk on, I guess I can take it.'\r Radar: 'Well, that's okay.  Um, I'd just as soon not.'\r Hawkeye: 'Well, okay.  That's nice too.'\r It seems that Radar has grown up.  He no longer looks at Hawkeye as a hero, but rather as a fellow man and a colleague.  To solidify and symbolize this new relationship, Hawkeye gives Radar his beer and takes Radar's Grape Nehi in return. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the episode, Hawkeye pins a Purple Heart on Radar's lapel and then salutes him.  This is the only time Hawkeye salutes anyone during the run of the series.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNo way, man!  Hawkeye salutes several people, sometimes in jest, other times out of respect.  Among the respectful salutes: Hawkeye salutes Radar in the latter's final episode ('Goodbye, Radar'); Hawkeye salutes Father Mulcahy after pinning captain's bars on him ('Captains Outrageous'); Hawkeye, along with BJ, salutes Colonel Potter in the very last episode ('Goodbye, Farewell and Amen').\r I salute you for taking this quiz, thank you.  I hope you enjoyed it and will try more of my 'M*A*S*H'-related quizzes (and, indeed, some of my other quizzes) in the future. \n"}]}
