{"id": "382710", "name": "\"The Upside Down\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stranger Things"], "questions": [{"text": "According to Dr. Brenner, how many people have been claimed by the monster upon his conversation with Joyce?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Ten", "Two", "Dozens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tJoyce ends up cuffed to a chair in an interrogation room within the Hawkins lab and Dr. Brenner enters to say they know she's contacted her son somehow.  He insists that they can save more people (as six have been taken), but he forced her to have a funeral and (only allegedly) bury her youngest son, so she's not too intrigued by his idea.\rHopper, meanwhile, is tased in another room and asked what he knows.  They ask who he's working with and he doesn't lie, but he's aware they've screwed up big time.  They plan to make it look like he overdosed, but he says, assuredly, they'll likely have to let him and Joyce go with anything they need so that they can find Will. \n"}, {"text": "To get to the gate, Hopper gives Brenner a location at which he can find Eleven.  To his knowledge, does he give an accurate location?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe boys and Eleven, now alone at the middle school, finally realize that Jonathan and Nancy have left.  Eleven says they've gone off to fight the monster.\rNancy and Jonathan are back at the Byers household with all the things they picked up.  They replace all the nights they need to in the lines, plant the bear trap, load the guns, make a spiked bat, and lay down some gasoline.  They're ready.\rDr. Brenner speaks with Hopper alone and he offers up Eleven for everyone else's freedom.  The agreement works, and soon Hopper and Joyce don quarantine suits and head into the basement while Brenner and his agents roll out.\rWith weapons in hand, Hopper and Joyce walk through the gate. \n"}, {"text": "Who arrives at the Byers house before the monster?", "correct": "Steve", "options": ["Karen", "Eleven", "Mr. Clark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve.\n\n\tJoyce and Hopper emerge in the upside down as Hopper remembers his daughter, Nancy.  They have no choice but to follow their lights into the forest.\rThe boys decide to stay in the school on Hopper's advice, and while Mike stays with Eleven, Lucas and Dustin go off to find food.\rNancy and Jonathan both use kitchen knives to cut their hands; blood will lure the creature.  Binding their hands they both wait for the lights to act as alarms...but the monster doesn't arrive before Steve does, knocking on the door to speak to Jonathan.  Nancy gets the door and asks him to leave, but he barges in when he sees her bloodied hand.  The weapons inside are even more concerning.  That's when the monster arrives. \n"}, {"text": "Do Joyce and Hopper reach Castle Byers in the upside down?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tNancy aims a gun at Steve to try to get him to leave, but that's when the lights flicker and, before anyone knows it, the monster tears a hole through the living room ceiling and the three are forced to run into Will's room, jumping over the bear trap on the way.  They keep their guards up but it seems to disappear, not triggering any of their traps.  They head back out to the living room and Nancy finally convinces Steve he has to go.\rJoyce and Hopper wander through the woods to find plenty of concerning things, amongst them an opened yellow egg.  When they reach Castle Byers they find it smashed.  While Joyce screams out for Will, Hopper finds a stuffed cat that looks identical to one his daughter had while she was in the hospital, dying of cancer. \n"}, {"text": "What happens when the monster is set on fire?", "correct": "It disappears", "options": ["It explodes", "It grows", "It dies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt disappears.\n\n\tAs soon as Steve leaves, the lights flicker and go out, leaving Nancy and Jonathan in total darkness.  Nancy is first to spot the monster, but it's too late; it knocks Jonathan to the floor and she shoots it several times to distract it.  Steve returns to fight and uses the bat to knock it back into the bear trap.  Jonathan gets up and, using his lighter, he sets the hallway on fire.  by the time they're able to extinguish the flames, the monster is gone.\rIn the upside down, Joyce and Hopper reach the Byers house and walk through it.  Back in the real world, the teens notice the lights come on where Joyce and Hopper walk.  A mark is on the floor in the upside down where the monster was hurt.\rAs the lights continue to track their way through, Jonathan believes it's his mother.  He's right. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin and Lucas, searching for food, come upon a hidden cache of which of these during their hunt?", "correct": "Chocolate pudding tins", "options": ["Pop Tarts", "Eggo waffles", "Oreos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate pudding tins.\n\n\tDustin and Lucas find the chocolate pudding in the cafeteria while Mike talks about Eleven moving in to his house when everything is said and done...despite not having discussed this before.  Eleven asks if she'd be like his sister, but Mike has to come clean, in a roundabout way, and say that he likes her like a girlfriend.  Rather than saying it though, he kisses her.  That's when the lights go by outside and Mike watches the government agents pull up at the middle school.  They have to leave.\rBy the time the agents find the auditorium, the kids are trapped in the hallways and surrounded on all sides, guns pointed at them.  Eleven has no choice; she uses her powers and kills the agents surrounding them with her mind.  Of course, this expends her powers too, and she passes out. \n"}, {"text": "Where in the upside down do Hopper and Joyce ultimately find Will?", "correct": "Public library", "options": ["Mike's basement", "Middle school", "Police station"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPublic library.\n\n\tThe boys are grabbed by another squad of agents and Dr. Brenner reaches Eleven, promising to make her well again so that no one else gets hurt.  Unfortunately, something bad is about to happen.  As the lights flicker, Mike realizes all the blood around them from the fallen agents, and it's the perfect setting for the monster to appear.  It bursts through a nearby wall as the agents train their weapons on it.  The weapons don't help.  The monster leaps at Dr. Brenner as the boys carry Eleven out of harm's way.\rHopper and Joyce continue to follow the monster's blood through the upside down, eventually reaching Hawkins proper.  The trail leads them to the public library where, inside, they head through the stacks to find bodies in amongst the organic webbing.  Hopper spies Beth's body there and, on a wall, Joyce finds Will with a long, alien tendril in his mouth.  Reminded of his daughter, once again, Hopper pulls it out and shoots it on the ground. \n"}, {"text": "What weapon do the boys ultimately end up using against the monster?", "correct": "Slingshot", "options": ["Chemicals", "Gun", "Fire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlingshot.\n\n\tThe boys bring eleven into Mr. Clark's science lab and place her on one of the countertops.  Mike promises her that she'll be safe when they get out but gunfire can be heard right outside the door...until it stops.  The monster bursts through the door and the boys use the only weapons at their disposal-- Lucas' wrist rocket and the rocks they collected. Lucas takes several shots which don't seem to phase the creature, but the largest rock proves effective.  When he takes aim and fires, Eleven uses her powers to send it straight through the monster, reeling it back across the room.  Eleven forces the boys back and breaks the monster's limbs, but it's clear it's the end. She says goodbye to Mike and disintegrates the monster, leaving nothing in front of the boys but a cloud of dust and ash. \n"}, {"text": "When Will wakes up in the hospital, who is with him in the room?", "correct": "Jonathan", "options": ["Eleven", "Mike", "Nancy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJonathan.\n\n\tJoyce and Hopper take off their helmets and fight to get Will breathing again.  Hopper gives her instructions for CPR and begins the process, urging him to wake up as he remembers his daughter's final moments.  Fortunately, they're able to bring him back.\rKaren arrives at the middle school looking for her son and finally finds him siting in the back of an ambulance, alive but shaken.\rWill wakes up in the hospital to find Joyce and Jonathan sitting by his bed.  Out in the waiting room, everyone else waits to hear the good news (or, in Lucas and Dustin's case, get some sleep).  Mike wakes them when Jonathan emerges and they all head inside to welcome him back and tell about all the cool things they encountered over the week.\rWhile the boys hang out, Jonathan watches as Nancy goes off on her own.  Hopper also takes a bit of a leave as well, heading out for a cigarette and watching as government agents arrive.  He gets into the back seat of their car and they drive off into the night. \n"}, {"text": "The story ends on what day?", "correct": "Christmas Eve", "options": ["Halloween", "The last day of school", "Easter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristmas Eve.\n\n\tOne month later, snow falls outside on Christmas Eve and the boys, finally back together to play, get together and beat a hydra in \"Dungeons and Dragons\", celebrating a victory but complaining that too many loose ends remained (like the lost knight, or the princess, or the flowers in the cave) for it to be completely satisfying after ten hours of playing.  It ends when Jonathan heads down to pick Will up.  Dustin and Lucas playfully fight for a bit while dungeon-master Mike looks back to Eleven's fort, reconstructed, with the walkie-talkie sitting inside.\rOn the way out, Nancy asks Jonathan to wait up and hands him a gift.  They wish each other a Merry Christmas and the Byers boys head out.  It turns out that Nancy bought him a new camera.  She heads back to the living room to sit with Steve.\rHopper heads out from the Christmas party at work and drives out to the woods with a bit of food.  There, he opens a wooden crate and places the food inside...with some Eggo waffles.\rAt the Byers house (now repaired), Jonathan tries out his new camera while Joyce sets the table.  Will heads off to wash his hands and in the bathroom he coughs up something living.  As it slides into the sink he blinks to find himself in the upside down, but soon the lights flicker back into the real world. \n"}]}
