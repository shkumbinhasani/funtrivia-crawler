Poorer families, who could not afford to offer a bull or a ram, were permitted to offer a dove or a young pigeon.\r This echoes the sacrifices offered at the time of the Passover (see Exodus 12), where a year-old lamb, male and without defect was to be offered (v5).\r (Submitted by cal562301) \n"}, {"text": "When a grain offering (made from flour and olive oil) was made to the LORD it had to be seasoned. With what?", "correct": "Salt", "options": ["Pepper", "Mustard", "Vinegar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalt.\n\n\tGrain offerings and the several ways they can be prepared (e.g. in an oven, on a griddle or in a pan) are discussed in Leviticus, chapter 2. Verse 13 stipulates that all grain offerings must be seasoned with salt as a reminder of the eternal covenant which exists between God and the Israelites.\r (Submitted by Watchkeeper) \n"}, {"text": "According to Leviticus 4:24, where should the hand be placed when killing the goat?", "correct": "on the goat's head", "options": ["on the goat's tail", "on the goat's rear end", "on the goat's belly"], "explanation": "\n\n\non the goat's head.\n\n\tWhen this is done it is a sin offering. A sin offering was presented to the Lord as a way to ask for atonement for one's sin(s). In this section, according to commentator Matthew Henry, the Lord was displeased with the rulers of that time. This is why he gave them these laws in this part of Leviticus 4. \r (Submitted by ilona_ritter) \n"}, {"text": "Leviticus contains instructions for observing the seven Feasts of the LORD. Four of these feasts were held in spring and the other three in autumn (fall). Which of these is a fall (autumn) feast?", "correct": "Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles, Tents or Booths)", "options": ["Pesach (Passover)", "First Fruits", "Shavuot (Pentecost)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSukkot (Feast of Tabernacles, Tents or Booths).\n\n\tSukkot commemorates the Israelis living in tents for 40 years as they journeyed toward the Promised Land. You'll find the Feast described in Leviticus 23:39-43 - \"Tell the Israelis that starting the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the week-long Feast of Tents to the LORD\" (International Standard Version). The other Feasts are described earlier in the chapter.\r (Submitted by Watchkeeper) \n"}, {"text": "According to Leviticus 11:12, what animals are considered clean in the water?", "correct": "Those with fins and scales", "options": ["Only seahorses", "Those with shells", "Only trout"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThose with fins and scales.\n\n\tThe verse actually talks about which animals are unclean, which tells us which are clean by virtue of what's unclean. The Levitical Laws deal a lot with clean and unclean eating. One other example is the divided hoofed and undivided hoofed animals. Leviticus 5:11 tells us that the animals that do not divide their hooves are unclean animals. \r (Question submitted by ilona_ritter.) \n"}, {"text": "Levitucus 17:11-12, Easy-to-Read Version (ERV): \n\"It is the __ that makes a person pure. 12 That is why I am telling you Israelites and the foreigners living among you that you must not eat __ .\" \n\nWhat did the LORD command people to not consume? ", "correct": "Blood", "options": ["Cow's milk ", "Devil's food cake ", "Soap ", "Blood "], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlood.\n\n\tGod didn't want His people to be like vampires--or bedbugs; they eat blood too--and I completely understand! I have zero desire to eat or drink blood! \r While many (if not all) Christians believe that the Levitical dietary laws are no longer required, not consuming blood seems to be a moral issue that the New Testament repeats. In Acts 15, the apostles told the Gentile Christians to abstain from blood; meat from strangled animals; things sacrificed to idols, and fornication.   \r (Submitted by Ced-uh) \n"}, {"text": "Leviticus 18:18 includes a law that sounds like it was inspired by Genesis's Leah and Rachel. What does it say? ", "correct": "You must not marry your wife's sister while she's alive.", "options": ["You must not have homosexual sex. ", "You must not have sex with or marry your mother.", "You must not be intimate with your wife while she is on her period."], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou must not marry your wife's sister while she's alive.\n\n\tLeviticus 18:18, Easy-to-Read Version (ERV): \r\"While your wife is still living, you must not take her sister as another wife. This will make the sisters become enemies. You must not have sexual relations with your wife's sister.\" \r(The other translations say essentially the same thing, but with slightly different diction. This is one of the most direct and obvious ways of saying it.) \r In Genesis, Jacob was married to both Leah and Rachel, who were sisters, at the same time. It's important to remember that Jacob didn't plan to marry Leah. He was in love with Rachel and wanted to marry her only, but their father, Laban, tricked him into wedlock with the older sister, Leah. Nonetheless, Leah was technically Jacob's first wife, so if he was living during the time of Moses and Leviticus, he would have needed to wait until Leah died to wed Rachel. However, this specific law was clearly not in effect when Jacob lived, which is why I said that it sounds like it was inspired by the two sisters. \r The other options are also from Leviticus 18:\r Leviticus 18:7-8 say to not have sex with your birth mother OR your stepmother, also known as your father's wife--Jacob's son Reuben was guilty of this one! \r18:19 says to not have relations with a woman on her period. \rThe law against homosexual sex is in 18:22. \r (Submitted by Ced-uh) \n"}, {"text": "In Leviticus 19:3 (King James Version) what are the Hebrews told to keep?", "correct": "the sabbaths", "options": ["records of births and deaths", "a marriage liscense ", "their noses out of other people's business"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe sabbaths.\n\n\tIn the Ten Commandments (found in Exodus 31 and Deuteronomy 5) God commands His people to \"Remember the Sabbath Day and keep it holy.\" This verse in Leviticus is another reminder of that Commandment.\r The Sabbath for Jewish people begins at sundown on Friday and goes till sundown on Saturday so for most Jews the Sabbath day is Saturday. Saturday, in fact, means Sabbath. \r (Submitted by Ilona_Ritter) \n"}, {"text": "According to Leviticus 26:4 of most translations, what did the LORD say He would give the Israelites if they obeyed Him? ", "correct": "Rain", "options": ["Manna from heaven ", "Snow ", "Rain ", "Wind "], "explanation": "\n\n\nRain.\n\n\tThe LORD (or the Lord, or God, or the Lord God--they're all titles of Him!) told the Israelites that He would give them rain in its due season if they obeyed Him. Specifically, in Leviticus 26, He wanted them to obey the Sabbaths, respect His sanctuary, and to NOT make any idols or images. However, I imagine that He also meant to obey the commandments in general, not JUST those ones. \r God also said that the rain would make their trees fruitful. \r On Biblehub.com, Jamieson-Fausset-Brown explains that rain rarely fell in Judea/Israel except for during late autumn and then in late spring, right before the harvest. \r (Submitted by Ced-uh) \n"}, {"text": "What is Leviticus 27, the last chapter of the book, about? ", "correct": "Valuations (prices)", "options": ["Valuations (prices) ", "Marriage ", "Clean and unclean food ", "Ritual handwashing "], "explanation": "\n\n\nValuations (prices).\n\n\tFor details, read chapter 27. In a nutshell, it is about the valuations or prices of people or things dedicated to the LORD. It is also about vows made before the LORD. \r One quote about the price of a house: \r\"If you dedicate your house as holy to the Lord, the priest must decide its price. It doesn't make any difference if the house is good or bad. If the priest decides on a price, that is the price for the house. 15 But if you want to get the house back, you must add one-fifth to the price. Then you will get the house back\" (Leviticus 27:14, Easy-to-Read Version). \r You can find the laws about clean and unclean food in Leviticus 11. Judaism's ritual handwashing is based much more on the Talmud (oral law) than it is on the Torah (written law). This is why Jesus disagreed with ritual handwashing. \r (Submitted by Ced-uh) \n"}]}
