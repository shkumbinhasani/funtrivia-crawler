He is most well-known for his June 1961 remark that implied no wall would be built dividing Berlin, and his swift about-face several months later.  Seen as the key figure in East Germany associated with cold-war politics, he was eventually ousted by Erich Honecker in 1971 and died two years later. \n"}, {"text": "Much attention revolves around the involvement of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and Emperor Hirohito in the Japanese war effort in the 1940s, but which of these individuals was the Japanese army chief of staff during the latter years of World War II?  ", "correct": "Yoshijiro Umezu", "options": ["Tana Umaga", "Naomi Uemura", "Morihei Ueshiba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoshijiro Umezu.\n\n\tYoshijiro Umezu rose steadily in the Japanese army from the time he graduated from the Japanese military academy (1903) until his acquisition of the rank of army chief of staff in 1944.  He served in both the Russo-Japanese War (as a soldier) and World War I (as an observer), and attained the key position of commander of the Guangdong Army in Manchuria (and Ambassador to Manchukuo) in 1939.  It was Umezu who very reluctantly signed the Japanese surrender papers aboard the U.S.S. Missouri in 1945.  Following World War II he was rated as a Class A war criminal, but received a life sentence in prison rather than being executed.

In these works, he promoted the use of what we now know as the Arabic numerals (though they were originally from India and are also referred to as the 'Hindu place-value system').  Al-Uqlidisi is also the first known mathematician to utilize the decimal point system in a written work.  Prior to the introduction of the decimal system, sexagesimal notation was used in the Middle East. \n"}, {"text": "Now, let's play the Pope Urban game.

After a request for assistance from the Byzantine emperor Alexius I, Urban II called a council at Clermont in November of 1095 to discuss the need to 'take back' the holy lands from the Muslims (which seemed to take precedence over aiding the Greeks!) In concluding his speech at Clermont, Urban II was said to have shouted 'Deus volt!' (meaning 'God wills it!') \n"}, {"text": "More Urban musical chairs.

Indeed, during the reign of Urban VIII, the territory and influence of the Papal States expanded.  Urban VIII, who was born Maffeo Barberini, was a great patron of the arts, employing such artists as Claude Lorraine Nicolas Poussin and Gian Lorenzo Bernini.  While he was open-minded about art, Urban's mind was less open to scientific progress.  He was responsible for stifling Galileo, and forced the great Pisan scientist to recant following the publication of Galileo's greatest book 'Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World System' in 1632. \n"}, {"text": "Japanese painter Kitagawa Utamaro is one of the most influential artists of all-time.

He lived and worked around the same time as the two other great Japanese artists of the 18th-19th century period, Hiroshige and Hokusai, all practicing the art of ukiyo-e.  Utamaro's work was a key influence on the European Impressionists who would come along a half century later, thus helping to usher in a new era in Western painting. \n"}, {"text": "This American scientist was the winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1934 for his discovery of the technique that made the isolation of 'heavy hydrogen' (deuterium) possible.

Urey's later career work was concentrated in the field of paleometeorology and the origins of the Earth and moon.   It was Urey's work that led to the gas cloud theory for the origin of the solar system.  Urey's key written works were his 1930 book 'Atoms, Molecules and Quanta' and his 1952 book 'The Planets'. \n"}, {"text": "Stanislaw Marcin Ulam was a key player in the American development of the H-bomb.

He soon came to be involved in the Manhattan Project, and it was his innovations on the early work of Edward Teller that led to the 'radiation implosion' method of detonation for nuclear bombs.  Ulam also developed nuclear pulse propulsion and created the Monty Carlo Method for the analysis of complex integrals during his later career.  He lived until 1984, passing away in New Mexico, where he spent the last 40 years of his life. \n"}]}
