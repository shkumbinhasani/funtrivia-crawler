Quiz | People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "People Q-S", " William Shakespeare"], "questions": [{"text": "The mysterious death of this writer (at approximately the time that Shakespeare was coming into prominence) has led some people to suspect that this man's death was faked. Who was he?", "correct": "Christopher Marlowe", "options": ["Earl of Oxford", "Ben Jonson", "Francis Bacon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristopher Marlowe.\n\n\tMarlowe was almost certainly working as some type of political operative in the highly political Elizabethan world. The man who killed him (and the man's companions) were also probably involved in \"spying\" activities. His death came at a time when he was under investigation for charges of heresy -- a very serious charge in those days. It has been suggested that he faked his death and resumed writing, using the name Shakespeare as an alias. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following had a son named \"Hamnet\"?", "correct": "William Shakespeare", "options": ["Earl of Essex", "Lord Derby", "Walter Raleigh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Shakespeare.\n\n\tUnfortunately, Hamnet's life proved more difficult than that of the fictional Hamlet: Shakespeare's only son, one of a pair of twins, died at approximately 11 years of age. \n"}, {"text": "Many people who believe that this man was the true author of Shakespeare's works refer to the presence of \"ciphers\" in the work for support.", "correct": "Francis Bacon", "options": ["Christopher Marlowe", "Ben Jonson", "Earl of Oxford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancis Bacon.\n\n\tA woman named Delia Bacon - no relation to Francis - is credited with being the first to \"find\" the ciphers. The efforts have been so tortured, however, that they hurt (rather than help) the arguments in support of Francis Bacon. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these prominent Americans doubted that Shakespeare was the true author of the works attributed to him?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Walt Whitman", "Mark Twain", "Henry James"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tOne can add to this list names such as Sigmund Freud, Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Greenleaf Whitier, and others. \n"}, {"text": "The protagonist in \"Hamlet\" has his mother re-marry quickly after his father's death. He encounters pirates at sea. He is betrothed to the daughter of a court advisor. Which of the following men experienced these events in his own life?", "correct": "Earl of Oxford", "options": ["Christopher Marlowe", "Francis Bacon", "Ben Jonson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarl of Oxford.\n\n\tOxford's life is similar to Hamlet's in terms of the death of a father and the quick re-marriage of a mother (to a \"lesser\"). Hamlet was engaged to Ophelia, daughter of Polonius (royal councillor). Oxford was engaged to the daughter of Lord Burghley (who is believed to be the \"model\" for Polonius).

(A \"reckoning\"). The \"small room\" may refer to the fact that the dispute occurred in a room in a private house (where people could go to lunch, etc.) (It has been suggested that it was a \"safe house\" for \"agents\" such as Marlowe and the others.)
