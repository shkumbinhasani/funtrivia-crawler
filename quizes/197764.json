{"id": "197764", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Moose' Online Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "As Hawkeye, Trapper and Spearchucker emerge from the operating tent they discover that the 4077th has a visitor, a certain Sergeant Baker.  Baker is accompanied by a young Korean woman laden with his belongings.  What is her name?", "correct": "Young Hi", "options": ["Byun Ji", "Soo Jin", "Hyul Kun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoung Hi.\n\n\tYoung Hi is played by Virginia Lee, while Baker is portrayed by Paul Jenkins.  \r Baker asks Hawkeye where he might find Colonel Blake.  Hawkeye's marvelous response: 'Yes, Sergeant.  You go straight down there, turn left and you look for a broken down, dirty, old man and you follow him.'  'Yes, sir.  He'll take me to Colonel Blake?' asks Baker.  'That *is* Colonel Blake,' Hawkeye responds. \n"}, {"text": "Right from the beginning, Hawkeye is annoyed by Baker because of the latter's willingness to blithely order his moose around, and for his penchant for racist language.  In the Swamp, the Baker situation is discussed amongst the doctors and Radar.  Radar explains that the term moose comes from the Japanese word 'musume', which means?", "correct": "Girl", "options": ["Labor", "Servant", "Mother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGirl.\n\n\tI have seen translations of 'musume' as diverse as 'girl brought up with tender care' to 'daughter'; suffice it to say, the term implies a very young female.  Despite the fact that the Swampmates have their own houseboy, namely Ho-Jon, they seem very uncomfortable about Baker and his personal servant, especially when they consider the possibility of a sexual aspect to their relationship. \n"}, {"text": "After continued discussion, it is discovered that Sergeant Baker has acquired the services of his moose through purchase.  How much did he pay her family for 'ownership' of the girl?", "correct": "$500", "options": ["$1000", "$100", "$200"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$500.\n\n\tWhile the Swamp-dwellers discuss the moose situation, Ho-jon interjects with information about the young girl.  It seems that her family has sold her to Baker for $500.  Hawkeye reacts to this with disbelief, but Ho-Jon explains that such practices are not unusual, especially among families with little means. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye tries to reason with Henry regarding the moose situation, but of course reasoning with Henry is hopeless.  Next, Hawkeye and Trapper approach the young woman in hopes that they can help extricate her from her current situation.  Unfortunately, the girl is too young and naive to understand their questions, despite her claim to 'speak [English] very ______'.  Which of these completes her sentence?", "correct": "Goodly", "options": ["Right-o", "Wellness", "A - #1"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoodly.\n\n\tYoung Hi claims to 'make English perfect' and 'speak[s] very goodly'.  She then provides the following example, 'Hello Joe, what you know?  You got candy bar for mother?  She sick.'  In reality, the girl understands very little of what Hawkeye and Trapper ask, she only seems to concern herself with her 'duties' to Baker (and her family). \n"}, {"text": "Unable to convince Baker to give up his moose, and failing even to convince the Sergeant to sell her services, Hawkeye decides that it's time to break out the cards.  Using an ingenious plan, which involves Radar, a telescope and an earphone, Hawkeye manages to swindle Baker out of a great deal of cash.  What is Hawkeye's first depicted winning hand in the poker game?", "correct": "Three deuces", "options": ["Heart flush", "A baby straight", "Aces over kings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree deuces.\n\n\tIn the first hand we see, Hawkeye beats Baker's aces and kings with a trio of twos.  In the second hand, Hawkeye's flush beats Baker's baby straight.  The latter is entirely out of money, and has a thousand dollar IOU to pay back.  Hawkeye returns Baker all of his money and the IOU in return for his relinquishment of ownership over Young Hi's services. \n"}, {"text": "In the final depicted poker hand, Radar is delayed in revealing Baker's hand to Hawkeye.  What 'problem' does Radar encounter in this process?", "correct": "A nurse walks in front of the telescope", "options": ["Hot Lips nearly discovers Hawkeye's plan", "Henry asks Radar to assist him", "Frank Burns insists on knowing what Radar is doing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA nurse walks in front of the telescope.\n\n\tWhen Radar is about to see what Baker received for his final hand, a nurse walks in front of the telescope wearing her bathrobe.  Radar trains the scope on the nurse, claiming he is 'blocked'.  'Oh boy am I blocked,' suggests Radar.  When the nurse is in the shower tent, Radar returns to his responsibility, revealing to Hawkeye that Baker has a 'baby straight'. \n"}, {"text": "Following the poker game, Hawkeye suddenly finds himself the not-so-proud 'owner' of a moose.  Despite his efforts to convince the girl that she is now free to return home, Hawkeye is unable to shed himself of his new servant.  Trapper and Spearchucker find ample time to criticize Hawkeye for having acquired the service of the moose, but become especially annoyed when they discover...?", "correct": "The moose has cleaned the Swamp", "options": ["The moose has cooked Hawkeye a five-course meal", "The moose has ironed and pressed their clothes", "The moose has thrown away their old underwear and socks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe moose has cleaned the Swamp.\n\n\tRather than accept her newfound freedom, Young Hi reverts to wait on Hawkeye hand and foot.  She shaves Hawkeye outside the Swamp as Trapper and Spearchucker approach, all full of spit and vinegar.  After entering the tent, Trapper shouts, 'Hawkeye, get in here!'  Hawkeye complies, and Trapper continues, 'Hawkeye, someone snuck in here and committed a neatness!'  Hawkeye vows that Young Hi will be out of the Swamp the following morning.  'Okay,' Trapper responds, 'But as soon as she's gone, we dirty up the joint and get back to normal.' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye sends the young moose off to Seoul to be with her family, but she returns in the middle of the night.  Trapper and Hawkeye discuss the situation and conclude that the only way to handle this dilemma is to begin a 'demoosifying' program.  The young girl is trained to speak and behave as a proper young woman should, and to shed her servile ways.  In the mess tent, she introduces herself in a very polite manner.  She also adds that she is very _________.  (What word goes in the blank?)", "correct": "Beautiful", "options": ["Independent", "Intellectual", "Analytical"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeautiful.\n\n\tAt the mess table at which Hawkeye and friends sit, Young Hi is introduced to the group.  In a very cordial manner, she introduces herself: 'How do you do?  I am pleased to meet you.  My name is Young Hi.'  After some encouraging applause by the gang, Young Hi adds, 'I am also beautiful.'  (Hawkeye had casually called her beautiful in the scene just prior.) \n"}, {"text": "The second part of the plan developed by Hawkeye and Trapper is to summon a member of the moose's family to come to the 4077th and convince her to return home.  The girl's younger brother arrives at camp as the family representative.  What is the name of this young lad?", "correct": "Benny", "options": ["Charlie", "Ralph", "Tim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBenny.\n\n\tBenny turns out to be a smooth-talking 'dead-end kid' (as Hawkeye calls him) with a cigarette hanging from his lips and an unreal command of American slang.  To make matters worse, Benny suggests to Young Hi that, after she returns home, she will be sold once again, this time for double or triple her original 'price'. \n"}, {"text": "The ultimate fate of the moose is that she returns with her younger brother to her family, where she will most likely be sold once again into bondage.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tYoung Hi leaves with Benny, but almost immediately returns to the Swamp, having told her younger sibling to 'shove off'.  In the final scene of the episode, Hawkeye reads a letter from Young Hi.  She is attending a convent school in Seoul and hopes to one day be a nurse's helper.  Hawkeye jokes that he misses her, especially because of the shaves and shoeshines she gives...leading to his being pummeled by Spearchucker and Trapper.\r Thank you for trying this quiz.
