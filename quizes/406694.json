{"id": "406694", "name": "Taking Stock in \"Resident Evil 4\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 4"], "questions": [{"text": "As soon as you enter Salazar's Castle in Chapter 3-1, you'll find two swords.  One is gold; what is the other?", "correct": "Platinum", "options": ["Silver", "Glass", "Wood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlatinum.\n\n\tThese Key Items, though seemingly useless, are the first that Leon must interact with upon arriving inside Salazar's Castle.  They're short-lived too; Leon finds both of them on different floors of the same room, and all he needs to do to advance deeper into the building is swap their places in indentations on the walls.  Doing so will unlock the only route out of the area.  They, otherwise, can not be used as actual weapons; they're purely decorative. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these is not a Card Key Leon must use in the island labs?", "correct": "Computer Room Card Key", "options": ["Freezer Card Key", "Waste Disposal Card Key", "Storage Room Card Key"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComputer Room Card Key.\n\n\tNo area is without its keys!  In Chapter 5-1, Leon will reach a laboratory facility on the island where Ashley has been taken and locked away, and a number of key junctures require something a little more technologically advanced than a normal everyday key.  The Freezer Card Key is first; it can be found in the operating room moments before you encounter your first Regenerator.  This Card Key can be rewritten into the Waste Disposal Card Key in the freezer.  Finally, an Iron Maiden will hold the Storage Room Card Key which you can use to retrieve Ashley, locked away there earlier in the area. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these will open the metal door in the starting village?", "correct": "Insignia Key", "options": ["Key to the Mine", "Spinel", "Staff of Royalty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsignia Key.\n\n\tAt the end of Chapter 1-2, Leon will venture into a more lavish house than most seen throughout the village thus far.  This will turn out to be Bitores Mendez's house, and it's where you can get your hands on the ornate Insignia Key and start making a return to the village proper.  The key is used to enter the small building leading to the church, and when Leon enters it he can take the underground passage hidden there to the cemetery. \n"}, {"text": "Where will Leon locate the Dynamite?", "correct": "The mine", "options": ["The castle", "The village", "The clock tower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe mine.\n\n\tThough a number of Ganados will use dynamite in battle against Leon (potentially leading to some fatal consequences if you're quick enough to stop them), there's a big bundle of Dynamite waiting in a mine cart beneath Castle Salazar, and it's necessary for Leon to get his hands on it to blow up a boulder blocking the route.  The Dynamite only appears once and is a one-time-use item, but it will help Leon get through the underground section once Salazar puts him there. \n"}, {"text": "In Chapter 2-3, Leon will be faced with a choice.  Either he'll be able to claim the Old Key or which of these to advance to the gondola?", "correct": "Camp Key", "options": ["New Key", "Silver Key", "Lift Key"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCamp Key.\n\n\tChapter 2-3, which begins after Leon faces an onslaught of villagers while cornered in a house, involves a choice between a left path and a right path.  On one of these, where Leon claims the Camp Key, he will face off against more Ganados and several chainsaw foes; on the other, Leon will get the Old Key, but face off against another El Gigante.  Both routes lead to the same place, namely the gondola, and you can visit both sides of the fork eventually if you choose. \n"}, {"text": "The Stone of Sacrifice is obtained after a lengthy sequence involving which of these?", "correct": "Mine carts", "options": ["Portraits", "Colmillos", "Snipers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMine carts.\n\n\tAh yes, nothing says high-octane adrenaline quite like a video game mine cart level, and \"Resident Evil 4\", while it touches on this earlier in the game, really hits this particular stride in Chapter 4-3 when Leon, going solo, needed to descend into the mines to obtain the Stone of Sacrifice and find his way back into Salazar's Castle. The mine cart adventure is a lengthy one in which a number of Ganados (including many with angrier Plagas and some with chainsaws) will hitch a ride.  If Leon can survive the fights and survive a plunge at the end, he can get the disc-shaped stone and head along. \n"}, {"text": "The Pieces of the Holy Beast are found in the sand fortress in Chapter 5-3.  Who will pursue you while you collect them?", "correct": "Jack Krauser", "options": ["Lord Saddler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Krauser.\n\n\tReaching the end of Chapter 5-3, Leon will need to battle Jack Krauser in some old island ruins, and Krauser will be very kind in outlining the goal-- there are three Pieces of the Holy Beast (one north, one east, and one on him) that are needed to open the next door.  If Leon can grab the Panther piece and the Eagle piece during the fight and then claim the last one, the Serpent, from Krauser's body, then the battle will be over. \n"}, {"text": "The two halves of the Blue Moonstone are found in which of these parts of Salazar's Castle?", "correct": "Hedge maze", "options": ["Art gallery", "Sewer", "Prison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHedge maze.\n\n\tThere are left and right halves of the Blue Moonstone and both are found in the hedge maze occupied by Salazar's trusty dogs.  Naturally, Leon needs to navigate through the maze, evading and killing Colmillos, to get both sides and finish Chapter 3-2 (using them, combined, on a bedroom door).  Both of the Moonstone pieces can be found on the maze's fountains, one of which is at ground level and one of which is above the maze itself, allowing Leon to get a vantage point for when the dogs inevitably do come rushing in. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these rarely-used weapons do you use to fight Del Lago?", "correct": "Harpoon", "options": ["Grappling Hook", "Trident", "Laser"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarpoon.\n\n\tAt the end of Chapter 1-3, Leon will need to hop into a small boat and cross a lake but he'll be halted by the presence of a Las Plagas-infected fish known as Del Lago, which will be massive enough to knock him out of his boat and into the water to become a tasty morsel of food.  Leon's only means of fighting back is with an unlimited supply of harpoons brought along for the ride.  When Del Lago takes enough damage, Leon can cross over to the other side and plod along into Chapter 2-1. \n"}, {"text": "How many jewels fit into the Beerstein treasure item?", "correct": "Three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree & 3.\n\n\tThroughout the game, Leon can accumulate treasures that can be sold to a merchant for a hefty amount of pesetas, and some of these can be combined with others to increase items' values.  The Beerstein is the earliest to be found (in the village at the start of the game).  It's only worth 3,000 pesetas, but with a few Catseye jewels (a red one, a green one, and a yellow one), the price can raise to 20,000 pesetas by the end of Chapter 2-3.  A handful of other items in the game serve this purpose, notably the Butterfly Lamp, the Elegant Mask, and the Golden Lynx. \n"}]}
