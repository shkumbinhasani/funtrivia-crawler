Since Bob could not afford this, he bought them one to share. It was a good thing, too, because every so often, a new one would come out and they'd all want that. By the time the fourth iPod Touch came out, they all had one; the youngest had a 1G, and the oldest had a 4G...\n\nBut Bob knows nothing about iPods.  What does the G mean?", "correct": "Generation", "options": ["Greatness", "Gigabyte", "Graphics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneration.\n\n\tWhen it comes to the iPod Touch, the G stands for the generation. So if you own a 2G, for instance, that means it is a second-generation iPod, and you can assume it was the second to be released.  The first-generation iPod Touch was released in September 2007, and a new \"generation\" was released yearly until 2010, with the release of the iPod 4G. \n"}, {"text": "Before Apple exploded into the touchscreen world, Nintendo had the power, and Bob's children each owned one of the Nintendo touchscreens.

Which was it?", "correct": "Nintendo DS", "options": ["Nintendo TouchMe", "Nintendo Wii", "Nintendo Gameboy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNintendo DS.\n\n\tThe Nintendo DS was originally released in 2004, and it quickly became a best seller. No one had seen anything like it: a touchscreen handheld console? Eight years later, in 2012, the gaming device was still freakishly popular, even with all the iPod and touch phone hoopla... It was so popular that it became the second highest selling video game console at that time, second only to the PS2. \n"}, {"text": "Bob's eldest daughter was married a year ago and now has invited Bob to dinner. He went to the kitchen to get some water, and was shocked to see touchscreens everywhere!  Which of these could Bob not have encountered in touchscreen version?", "correct": "He could have encountered all of these", "options": ["Oven", "Toaster", "Refrigerator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe could have encountered all of these.\n\n\tDon't worry; I was just as shocked as you when I learned you can actually purchase a touchscreen toaster!  Virtually every kitchen appliance and gadget can come with a touchscreen. Though the microwave might be the most common, refrigerators, stoves, toasters, blenders, and the like all have some sort of touchscreen available. \n"}, {"text": "Bob's 10-year-old son asked him to upgrade his iOS on his touchscreen device. Bob stared at him blankly, having no clue what the iOS was.  \"Go ask your mother,\" was the only response he could give.\n\nPoor Bob.  Can you perhaps help him; what did iOS originally stand for?", "correct": "iPhone Operating System", "options": ["iPhone's Only Storage", "iPod Original Settings", "iPod Overused Signal"], "explanation": "\n\n\niPhone Operating System.\n\n\tIf this doesn't confuse Bob, I don't know what will.

His wife told him that it was just like Siri for her iPhone.\n\nWhat voice recognition software did Google release in response to Apple's \"Siri\"?", "correct": "Iris", "options": ["Iirs", "Risi", "Srii"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIris.\n\n\tWhen Siri (Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface) was released by Apple in August of 2011, crowds went wild. No one else had anything like it; Siri was incredible. Of course, this means that Google Android sales went down. So a team sat down and created their own system, and named it Iris ( which is Siri backwards). They released this software in December of 2011 to compete with Siri. \n"}, {"text": "Bob and his wife went out to buy a new car, but the next day, Bob found a strange device in it. He picked it up and examined it, only to find it was a touchscreen.

He sat down, his son gave him a controller, and then was asked to turn on the console. He found the power button, but before he could press it, the console turned on!

The PS2, however, had no such feature. \n"}, {"text": "When Bob visited his local museum with his family, they found a little resting room.
