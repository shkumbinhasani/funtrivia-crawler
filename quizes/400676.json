{"id": "400676", "name": "Mixed 'Seinfeld' Stuff Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Seinfeld"], "questions": [{"text": "Susan Ross died from licking toxic envelopes, but why was she engaged in such a task?", "correct": "For her wedding", "options": ["For George's birthday", "For work", "For a charity drive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFor her wedding.\n\n\tEnding off a massive arc following George Costanza's dating, engagement, and wedding preparations through season 7, the episode entitled \"The Invitations\" saw Susan licking poorly-made envelopes (purchased by George) and passing out due to their toxic glue.  She subsequently died in the hospital at the end of the episode, freeing George from a marriage he wasn't all-too-excited about in the first place.  Susan never returned in later episodes, but her parents did. \n"}, {"text": "In season 7's episode \"The Rye\", Jerry steals a marble rye from an old woman named Mabel.  Did she return in the series finale as a character witness during the foursome's trial?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tPlayed by Frances Bay, Mabel was an elderly woman who, in season 7, purchased the last marble rye, forcing Jerry to rob her on the street for it (since he needed one for George).  Mabel returns a handful of times, notably in \"The Cadillac (Part I and II)\" as a councilwoman for Morty Seinfeld's condo.  She also returns in \"The Finale\" to recount her story to a packed courtroom and, ultimately, get the four main characters locked away in jail. \n"}, {"text": "In the season 6 episode \"The Pledge Drive\", what does Mr. Pitt eat with a knife and a fork?", "correct": "Snickers", "options": ["Toblerone", "Soup", "Baby Ruth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnickers.\n\n\tElaine witnesses this moment first-hand and, in her confusion and quest for answers, she tells the others about this odd idiosyncrasy.  This results in George eating a Snickers in the same way during a meeting at PBS prior to their pledge drive, and within a short amount of time, others around New York are doing much the same, much to Elaine's dismay. \n"}, {"text": "In the season 8 episode \"The Checks\", Elaine dates a boyfriend who is obsessed with the song \"Desperado\".  She tries to take a similar liking to what other song, much to her boyfriend's disliking?", "correct": "Witchy Woman", "options": ["Lyin' Eyes", "Take It Easy", "Hotel California"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWitchy Woman.\n\n\tThe concern evolves over the course of the episode as Elaine is initially put off by her boyfriend Brett's urging for complete silence every time The Eagles' \"Desperado\" comes on the radio.  Elaine tries to meet him halfway by attempting to find a mutual song they can share together, but her suggestions-- especially \"Witchy Woman\"-- don't make the grade.  Brett is later sent to the hospital where, ironically, he dies during a playing of \"Witchy Woman\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of the four main characters is responsible for wearing 'The Puffy Shirt'?", "correct": "Jerry", "options": ["George", "Elaine", "Kramer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJerry.\n\n\tJerry wears the shirt as a result of inadvertently accepting to do so; he made a comment about wearing Kramer's then-girlfriend's fashion during an appearance on \"The Today Show\".  Unable to back out of it, he did.  The catch was, of course, that he was only on \"The Today Show\" to talk about Goodwill and homelessness.  In the end of the episode, Jerry notices that there's a surprising influx of homeless men wearing puffy shirts on the streets of New York. \n"}, {"text": "The sixth season finale of \"Seinfeld\", \"The Understudy\", saw guest actress Bette Midler playing a role in what fake stageplay based on a fake movie seen earlier in the show?", "correct": "'Rochelle, Rochelle'", "options": ["'CheckMate'", "'Sack Lunch'", "'Chunnel'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Rochelle, Rochelle'.\n\n\tAh yes, a young girl's strange and erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.  'Rochelle, Rochelle' shows up a few times along the course of \"Seinfeld\", first in theatres in season 4's \"The Movie\" and then again as a VHS in \"The Smelly Car\".  It only returns once more at the end of season 6 when Bette Midler is playing Rochelle in the stage adaptation.  Jerry happens to be dating her understudy, Gennice, who takes on the role when Midler is injured in a charity softball game (by George). \n"}, {"text": "What was the cartoon character featured on the eponymous device in the season 3 episode \"The Pez Dispenser\"?", "correct": "Tweety Bird", "options": ["Bugs Bunny", "Marvin the Martian", "Mickey Mouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTweety Bird.\n\n\tThe Pez Dispenser appears when Elaine and Jerry are in the audience for a piano recital at which George's then-girlfriend was playing up on stage.  The dispenser caused Elaine to laugh and, in turn, caused the pianist to make a mistake, setting up a whole downward spiral throughout the episode.  The girlfriend ultimately breaks up with George at the end of the episode because she hears Elaine's laugh, having vowed never to forget it after hearing it the first time. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the bookstore where Jerry caught his Uncle Leo shoplifting?", "correct": "Brentano's", "options": ["Barnes and Noble", "The Strand", "Borders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrentano's.\n\n\tThis occurred in the season 9 episode \"The Bookstore\".  When Jerry and George spotted Uncle Leo stealing from Brentano's (more than once) Jerry confronted him by telling the cops and then found out from his parents that it's just something old people do if they really need it.  In this same episode, George takes a book into the bathroom at the bookstore and gets forced to purchase it (as it's been flagged).  He spends the rest of the episode trying to return it, only to opt to steal another copy and return that to get his money back.  The plan fails. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the TV pilot Jerry and George create for NBC in season 5?", "correct": "Jerry", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJerry.\n\n\tIn an obvious spin on the name \"Seinfeld\", \"Jerry\" features pretty much the same idea as the show in a meta-twist.  Jerry plays himself, of course, with others filling the roles of Elaine, George, and Kramer.  In the two-part fourth season finale, the episode is greenlit and produced, ultimately airing once before getting cancelled by NBC's new head of programming.  A revival of the pilot is the reason the group is involved in the events of \"The Finale\" at the end of season 9. \n"}, {"text": "Who of the four pretends to be a marine biologist?", "correct": "George", "options": ["Elaine", "Kramer", "Jerry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge.\n\n\tOne in a series of lies told throughout the series, George claims to be a marine biologist in the season 5 episode titled \"The Marine Biologist\" during which he, forced to jump into an actual emergency involving a beached whale, removes a golf ball from its blowhole.  The golf ball is, coincidentally, Kramer's; he'd been hitting them off a dock into the ocean. \n"}]}
