{"id": "226684", "name": "How much do you know about Saw II? | Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Saw", "Saw II"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of the death mask victim?", "correct": "Michael", "options": ["Roger", "Todd", "Adam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael.\n\n\tIn the beginning of the movie, we are shown that Jigsaw is still up to his old tricks.  His first victim of the movie, Michael, is in a chair with a large device around his neck that resembles Amanda's bear trap in \"Saw I\".  Using a make-up mirror, he is able to see his swollen eye and the deadly contraption he is in.  Just then, a TV comes on and the friendly jigsaw puppet explains everything. He says that while some may think of Michael as a rat or a snitch, Jigsaw thinks he's unworthy.  To get out of the trap, Michael has to sacrifice what he's used to do his horrible deeds.  By cutting out his right eye with a scalpel in the room, he can get the key to open the trap (which was surgically placed into him two hours earlier).  He attempts this, but the pain is too much, and the trap snaps shut. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Detective Matthews' son?", "correct": "Daniel", "options": ["Matt", "Tyler", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaniel.\n\n\tDetective Matthews is concerned about his son because he continuously pickpockets and steals.  When Matthews lets him go at the police station, he doesn't hear from him again until he finds John (Jigsaw) and discovers he's in the house.  After letting Daniel go, Matthews investigates Michael's murder and finds a jigsaw mark on the body.  When Matthews finds an emblem on the contraption, he sends a squad to the Wilson Steel Company, and they find John. \n"}, {"text": "When the cops first look at the monitors at the steel factory, how much time is remaining on the timer?", "correct": "1:57", "options": ["2:30", "3:00", "0:41"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1:57.\n\n\tWhen they investigate John's hide-out, the police come across a table of TV screens hiding under a dropcloth.  While watching them, Matthews finds his son sitting in the corner and John explains that he's in a house somewhere, and he will soon be breathing in a deadly toxin that will slowly deteriorate his body, causing him to bleed out of every orifice.  He assures Matthews that Daniel is in a safe place, and the people in the house start waking up. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Amanda find the first tape?", "correct": "In the wall", "options": ["In the safe", "Behind the picture", "Under the couch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the wall.\n\n\tWhen Amanda wakes up in the house, she immediately knows who's responsible and searches around the room for the tape.  When she finds it in the wall, she says that everything they'll need to know will be on the tape.  When it's played, Jigsaw says that the doors to the house will open in three hours, but of course all of the people have only two hours to live because they're breathing in a deadly nerve agent. In order to prevent themselves from dying a horrible, painful death is to find an antidote (and there are many throughout the house).  One antidote is in the safe, and the combination is in the back of their minds. Also with the tape is a key and a note saying \"Do not attempt to use this key on the door to this room\".  Amanda knows better and tries to tell everyone, but they decide to try it anyways.  While Xavier tries the key, Gus looks through the peephole.  The key triggers a mechanism which fires a gun through the peephole. \n"}, {"text": "Which 'player' of Jigsaw's game was responsible for capturing the others for Jigsaw?", "correct": "Obi", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nObi.\n\n\tAfter Gus is killed, the door with the gun unlocks and opens, so the group leaves the main room.  Xavier finds a bat with nails sticking out of it and picks it up and he tries breaking down a door that says 'exit' on it, but he finds steel bars behind it.\rWhile Matthews negotiates with John (who tells him that Daniel will be safe if he sits and talks with him), he learns that Jigsaw only gouged jigsaw pieces out of his victims because those people were missing their survival instincts.\rAfter this, Laura finds a door to the basement and the group investigates.  They find a mannequin with a knife in its chest and a note to Obi with a tape.  Jigsaw tells Obi that he can now redeem himself (because he burned everyone with lies and cons).  There are two antidotes in the oven.  One for himself and one for another person.  They force Obi to go into the oven for kidnapping them and he gets the first antidote.  When he pulls the second one down, the oven door shuts and the oven turns on.  He tries to beat away the flames and the others break open a glass window in the oven, but it's no use.  Obi cooks alive and the antidotes don't make it out. \n"}, {"text": "What disease does John have?", "correct": "Cancer", "options": ["Leprosy", "Smallpox", "The Plague"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCancer.\n\n\tMatthews continues to listen to John talk in order to ensure the safety of his son.  John says that he appreciates things differently since he knows that the clock is ticking and he basically has a deadline before he meets his own demise.  We also learn that Lawrence Gordon was John's oncologist (as shown in \"Saw I\").  Apparently, John tried to kill himself once by driving off a cliff, but he survived. His failed suicide attempt showed him that he was strong enough to survive many things, but not the cancer cells.  This helped him decide to change his life and teach people lessons to help them appreciate life. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Xavier throw into the needle pit?", "correct": "Amanda", "options": ["Laura", "Jonas", "Addison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmanda.\n\n\tThe group comes across an unlocked door on the second floor, but it seems to be blocked.  Xavier forces it open and a three minute timer starts on the door on the opposite side of the room.  They find a tape for Xavier and play it and Jigsaw tells them about a key for the door.  The key is under the bed in a pit full of syringes. Jigsaw does this because Xavier is a drug dealer and he gives hope to the desperate.  With a minute left, Xavier throws Amanda into the pit and she digs around for the key in a very disturbing scene.  She finds the key, but it's too late.  The door locks less than a second later. \n"}, {"text": "What number does Xavier find on the back of Gus' neck?", "correct": "2", "options": ["16", "24", "8"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tThis is what Jigsaw meant by saying that the clues are in the back of their minds.  The numbers are colour-coded, so they know that the clue is 'somewhere over the rainbow'.  When Xavier discovers this, he tries to kill Jonas.  Jonas starts to win the fight, but he starts coughing up blood, and Xavier gets the chance to kill him with the nail bat. Meanwhile, Laura finds a picture with an X on it and they look behind it to find a picture of Matthews and Daniel.  They all realize that Matthews and Daniel are father and son and that Matthews put them in jail by planting evidence.  Laura starts convulsing on the floor and she dies while Addison goes off on her own. \n"}, {"text": "Addison uses the antidote in the razor box.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAddison finds a box in a room and an envelope with a name on it, but she's so woozy that she decides to ignore it completely.  She sticks her hand into a hole in the box and reaches for the antidote, but it won't come out of the box.  She sticks her other hand inside, but the syringe breaks open and her hands get trapped inside.  She can't get her hands out since the razors would cut them off, so she's trapped with her wrists slit.  Xavier takes the chance to find the number on her neck and he leaves her to slowly die.\rMeanwhile, Matthews breaks John's finger at the factory and pummels him until he finally tells him that he'll go to the house (because he stayed and talked with him).  They leave out a back entrance and drive to the house alone just as the police find the source of the video feed. \n"}, {"text": "Who has been helping Jigsaw all along?", "correct": "Amanda", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmanda.\n\n\tAmanda and Daniel find Jonas' body with the bat when they're chased by Xavier and they wedge the bat between the wood floor and the door to save themselves.  They find a trapdoor in the floor, outlined by Jonas' blood, so they move the safe and go inside.  They use the key from the beginning and open the door.  They follow a long hall closely followed by Xavier and they head into a bathroom; the same one from \"Saw I\".  They close the door and turn on the lights to find the bodies of Zep and Adam (as well as Gordon's foot).  Xavier makes it in and slices the number off the back of his neck.  Daniel and Amanda fight him with the old hacksaw that Gordon used.\r When Matthews arrives at the house, John gives him a key and he goes inside.  The police arrive shortly after, and the police remaining at the factory can't see them on the cameras.  In the basement, Matthews finds the dead bodies (including Xavier's) and a hand over the rim of the bathtub.  When he looks inside, the pig mask pops out and someone stabs him with a syringe.\r When the timer runs out, a safe opens in the factory and the police find Daniel safe inside (after all, he was in 'a safe and secure place').  Apparently, Matthews didn't talk to John long enough.  It turns out that they weren't getting a live feed, and everything had happened hours earlier.  Matthews wakes up in a room and finds a tape recorder.  When it plays he hears Amanda's voice.  She says that she met Jigsaw in prison (because she was wrongfully arrested by Matthews) and she started using drugs.  She was Jigsaw's first 'player' in the game and she planned to follow in his footsteps by teaching life lessons.  She slams the bathroom door and leaves him for dead.\r 'Game Over.' \n"}]}
