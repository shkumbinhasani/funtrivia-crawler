{"id": "246457", "name": "A Whirlwind Tour of Lisbon Quiz | Europe | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Europe", "Portugal"], "questions": [{"text": "Lisbon -- or Lisboa, as the locals call it -- has been many things over the centuries. Once, its position near the Atlantic made it the launching point of an empire. What is the Portuguese name of the broad river that runs through Lisbon and gives it access to the sea?", "correct": "Tejo", "options": ["Thames", "Seine", "Guadalquivir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTejo.\n\n\tThe Tejo -- also famous under its Latin name, the Tagus -- flows from a large estuary into the Atlantic. Wide and deep, the waterway makes Lisbon an excellent port, attracting first Phoenicians, then Romans, Moors, and Portuguese Christians. Great explorers, including da Gama and Magellan, sailed from these shores. \n"}, {"text": "We'll begin our tour just west of the city, in the pleasant riverside neighborhood of Belem. Though the area's custard tarts are justly famous, the main attractions are all related to exploration: a tower to guard the river mouth, a monastery to commemorate Vasco da Gama's voyage to India, and a 1960 monument (Padrao dos Descobrimentos) to two centuries of Portuguese explorers. What historical figure, father of the Portuguese tradition of exploration, stands at the prow of the monument, gazing across the river?", "correct": "Henry the Navigator", "options": ["Ferdinand Magellan", "Manuel I", "Bartolomeu Dias"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry the Navigator.\n\n\tPrince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460), third son of King Joao I, devoted his life toward promoting Portuguese exploration, navigation and discovery. His interest in Africa piqued by the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta in Morocco, he went on to fund numerous exploratory voyages along the African coast. His voyages led to the discovery and colonization of the Madeira Islands as well as the Azores, and by the 1450s his share of West African slaves and gold made him an extremely wealthy man.\r On the monument in Belem, the figure of Henry stands at the tip of a V-shaped procession of explorers and dignitaries, ranging from the internationally famous (like Magellan and da Gama) to Portuguese artists (including painter Nuno Goncalves and poet Luis Vaz de Camoes). \n"}, {"text": "From the shores of Belem, we have an excellent view of the river as well as one of the most famous bridges across it. This two-kilometer suspension bridge is now known as Ponte 25 de Abril, after the 1974 date when a coup brought an end to dictatorship in Portugal. But when it was built in 1966, the bridge was named after the man who was dictator here for some 36 years. Who was he?", "correct": "Antonio de Oliveira Salazar", "options": ["Marcello Caetano", "Francisco Franco", "Benito Mussolini"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAntonio de Oliveira Salazar.\n\n\tThe first twenty-five years of the twentieth century were fraught with instability for Portugal. The king and crown prince were assassinated in 1908; the monarchy was ended by a military uprising in 1910. The resulting republic seemed like a good idea, but it just didn't take: there were 45 changes of government between 1910 and 1926. Salazar rose to power after that last coup, becoming prime minister in 1932; he held the position until 1968, when he suffered a stroke and was replaced by Marcello Caetano.\r On April 25, 1974, led by a faction of military officers (\"the captains of April\"), the dictatorship was ended in an almost-bloodless coup (four people were killed by government soldiers before they gave up). Many rebelling soldiers put carnations in the barrels of their rifles to indicate their peacefulness. To this day, the Portuguese remember \"the Carnation Revolution,\" and that flower is a symbol of freedom. \n"}, {"text": "Like Rome, Lisbon was built on seven hills -- a fact that's easy to remember (and lament) on the steep hikes between neighborhoods! Luckily, the city planners have provided several lifts to connect one area to another. Most of these are funiculars (similar to cable cars), but one is a vertical elevator, built entirely of iron in a style reminiscent of Gustave Eiffel. What is the name of this lift, which we'll take to get from downtown to Carmo Square in the Bairro Alto neighborhood?", "correct": "Elevador de Santa Justa", "options": ["Elevador Eiffel", "Elevador da Gloria", "Acensor de Lisboa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElevador de Santa Justa.\n\n\tRising 45 meters above its base in Santa Justa Street, the Elevador de Santa Justa is a landmark in its own right. Built by Raul Mesnier de Ponsard from 1900-1902, its neogothic iron frame conceals two spacious wooden elevator cars, complete with benches (this is, after all, public transit!) On reaching the top, you can climb the spiral staircases to the terrace for a fabulous panoramic view of Lisbon; we'll give you ten minutes for photographs before moving across the footbridge to Bairro Alto. \n"}, {"text": "Just after crossing the footbridge into the Bairro Alto, we come upon what was once one of the most beautiful churches in Lisbon. Its walls still stand, but are missing above the rose window frames; the roof above the nave is gone entirely, leaving only eerily perfect arches between the heart of the church and the sky. The Convent of Carmo remains in ruins as a monument to what disaster that devastated Lisbon and destroyed nearly every church therein?", "correct": "An earthquake", "options": ["A fire", "A revolution", "A volcanic eruption"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn earthquake.\n\n\tNovember 1, 1755, was a catastrophic day by any measure. Successive tremors (up to 9 on the Richter scale) toppled buildings, and the shocks brought enormous waves from the Rio Tejo. Several churches and cathedrals were destroyed during Mass (it was All Saints' Day, a Catholic holiday, so the churches were full); the candles used for worship fell during the tremors, helping to ignite a blaze that burned most parts of the city that were not flooded. In Lisbon, as many as 90,000 people may have been killed -- about a third of the city's total population.\r Almost all of the city was later rebuilt; the Convent of Carmo was near the end of the list. In the early 1800s it was decided to leave it a standing ruin as a memorial to the earthquake, and so it stands, its strangely bare arches marking the city skyline. \n"}, {"text": "Let's move on to another popular, highly-placed attraction. The Lisboetas of old knew their city needed fortification, and the resulting Castelo de Sao Jorge adds martial flair to the skyline. It sits amidst the winding, cobbled streets of what neighborhood, Lisbon's last surviving medieval district?", "correct": "Alfama", "options": ["Baixa", "Bairro Alto", "Campo Pequeno"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlfama.\n\n\tThe Alfama, built on bedrock, largely survived the 1755 earthquake that devastated the rest of Lisbon, so it alone was not completely replanned and rebuilt. Many a tourist has gotten lost in its charming yet hopelessly labyrinthine streets, but never fear: our Whirlwind tour guides know their way around. In no time at all you'll be atop the castle walls, admiring the panoramic views of Lisbon. \n"}, {"text": "While we're looking down from the castle walls, take a moment to examine downtown. Almost completely destroyed in 1755, it was subsequently completely rebuilt -- giving it a feature rare in the old quarters of European cities. What makes Lisbon's downtown different?", "correct": "The streets are laid out in a regular grid.", "options": ["No building exceeds two stories.", "The buildings are all skyscrapers.", "The entire place is a vast memorial park."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe streets are laid out in a regular grid.\n\n\tAfter the earthquake, the future Marques de Pombal was charged with the recovery effort; when faced with overwhelming chaos and asked what to do, he famously replied, \"We will bury the dead and feed the living.\" Luckily for Lisbon, he ran it brilliantly and straightforwardly, and he revealed a surprising talent for urban planning. The grid pattern he imposed on downtown (\"the Baixa\") was very innovative at the time. \n"}, {"text": "Walking through old Lisbon, you've probably noticed fancy tilework on a number of the buildings. Some have full facades of colored tiles, glinting in the sunlight; others display rectangular mosaics of hand-painted tiles, depicting scenes of love, history or faith. We'll spend some time in a museum devoted to these tiles, which have become a symbol of Portugal. What is their name, derived from the Arabic word for \"polished stone\"?", "correct": "azulejo", "options": ["nao-tinto", "bleuet", "tegula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nazulejo.\n\n\tFrom \"al zulaycha\" comes \"azulejo,\" one of Portugal's most charming art forms. At the National Azulejo Museum in eastern Lisbon, we'll see that while azulejos are often predominantly blue (especially when used as representational art), the palette has expanded over the centuries. Individually hand-painted tiles are combined to form stunningly complex works of art, from a twelve-tile bordered depiction of a caravel to a thousand-tile retelling of the history of Lisbon. Enjoy the displays, and don't forget to visit the gift shop! \n"}, {"text": "North of the museum is the Parque das Nacoes (Nations Park), built on reclaimed industrial land to host the 1998 World's Fair. It must have been a success: the fair had more visitors than the population of Portugal! The pavilions are gone now but a lovely park remains, as does what attraction where visitors can learn about marine life?", "correct": "The Oceanarium of Lisbon, an aquarium with live specimens", "options": ["The National Museum of Ichthyology, an exhibition with stuffed fish mounts", "Sea World Lisbon, an attraction where visitors can view performing whales and dolphins", "The Institute of Paleo-Oceanography, a museum filled with ancient marine fossils"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Oceanarium of Lisbon, an aquarium with live specimens.\n\n\tThe Oceanario de Lisboa, right on the shore of the Tejo, is home to over 450 species of sea animals living in seven million liters of water. Enjoy the manta rays and sharks at your own pace; then we'll walk around the park a bit before returning to the bus and getting supper. Don't forget to admire the Vasco da Gama cable-stayed bridge, the longest in Europe at 17.2 kilometers (counting viaducts and access ramps). \n"}, {"text": "We'll wrap up our tour with dinner and fado, a uniquely Portuguese musical form that dates to the early 19th century. What is the closest English translation of the word \"fado\"?", "correct": "fate", "options": ["trend", "fade-away", "love"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfate.\n\n\tFado (fate, or destiny) is a mournful style of song that often focuses on longing and the problems of poverty. A single, female singer is backed up by guitarists (or occasionally by an entire string orchestra!) Singers wear a traditional black scarf in memory of the early death of Maria Severa, the first great fado singer; a later great singer, Amalia Rodrigues (1929-1999) is credited with popularizing the form worldwide.\r This concludes our tour; enjoy the show!
