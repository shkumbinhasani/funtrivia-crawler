Which of the following never won a Triple Crown award in their career?", "correct": "Babe Ruth", "options": ["Ty Cobb", "Mickey Mantle", "Lou Gehrig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBabe Ruth.\n\n\tAmazingly, the Babe never won the Triple Crown but came close many times.  In 1923, after leading the league in home runs and RBIs, he was runner-up with his .393 batting average to Harry Heilmann who batted .403 with the Tigers.  In 1924, Ruth led in batting average and home runs, but was runner-up in RBIs to Goose Goslin of the Senators. In 1926, the Babe was again the runner-up in batting by .006 to Heinie Manush of the Tigers.  In 1931, Ruth was the runner-up in RBIs and batting average.

His .316 average, 49 home runs, and 122 RBIs made the Reds regret the trade.  Ironically, Frank never led the league in any of the Triple Crown categories again.  He retired in 1976 as a Cleveland Indian, was inducted into the hall in 1982, and was also a manager. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first switch-hitter to win a Triple Crown?", "correct": "Mickey Mantle", "options": ["Ty Cobb", "Nobody has ever done it", "Pete Rose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMickey Mantle.\n\n\tMantle, a switch-hitter won the award in 1956 with the Yankees.
