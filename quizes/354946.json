When the cops arrive, they find the three fake Bloody Face killers strung up from the ceiling in front of the main stairwell.\r A woman arrives at the asylum with her daughter to speak to Sister Jude.  Apparently, there's something 'odd' about her daughter who, on many occasions, has seemed more like an adult than her other two children.  She's never cried once.  She tells Sister Jude about Jenny and her friend Josie.  One day, when they went out to the woods, Josie was found with a pair of scissors in her chest.  Jenny told her mother and the police that a tall man in a brown jacket did it.  Her mother thought to this day that her daughter was responsible, especially since she found a lock of Josie's hair in her daughter's pocket.  Sister Jude claims that she's always dreamed of having a children's ward, but until then she can do nothing to help. \n"}, {"text": "Lana awakens in Thredson's basement to find him making breakfast.

When realizes, however, that she's still in Dr. Thredson's sterile basement as he makes her a croque-monsieur, she sits up and screams.  He says that no one will hear her.  When she asks about Wendy, he says he hid her body where it could never be found. It wouldn't matter to have her reappear when Kit Walker is awaiting his death sentence in prison.  He brings her some food, what he calls the perfect 'mommy snack', and sits next to her on the bed to say he never had a mother; she abandoned him when he was young and he spent his childhood in an orphanage where his basic needs were met, but he never received a mother's love or affection. Lana says that she knows how it feels to be abandoned-- it's how she felt at Briarcliff.  He says he knows that he was right about her. \n"}, {"text": "Thredson tells Lana that what he craves is which of these?", "correct": "A mother's touch", "options": ["A place in the history books", "The taste of flesh", "Chocolate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA mother's touch.\n\n\tThredson tells Lana that he always knew he was different, but conflicted.

One day, when a woman was brought in on a slab, he recognized her as his mother.  She was thirty-three, the same age as his mother when she left and the same age as Lana, and she couldn't possibly be his real mother, but somehow she still was. When he leaned in to feel her skin, he couldn't stand to be near her because of the smell of formaldehyde, but he realized he craved human contact and the touch of his mother's skin. When he removed her skin it was cold and stiff.  Unfortunately, that corpse couldn't sate his needs.  He decided to use a more lively substitute and used his victims, removing their skin.  When Lana starts to cry he says it's okay.  Now that she's here and can be his mother, all of that work is behind him. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Goodman, Sister Jude's Nazi hunter, informs her that he needs to secure which of the following?", "correct": "Fingerprints", "options": ["Dental records", "Blood sample", "Hair sample"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFingerprints.\n\n\tSister Jude receives a call from the man she hired to investigate the validity behind Anne's accusations that Dr. Arden was a Nazi by the name of Hans Gruber.  She says that she doesn't need the info anymore since the girl wasn't Anne Frank.  Somehow, she got it right; Arden was indeed a Nazi.  Somehow he ended up getting in with the Red Cross.  All Goodman needs is a set of prints.  When Sister Jude hangs up the phone she turns around to find the little girl, Jenny, standing behind her.  Her mother left her behind.  Jude leaves her in the care of Sister Mary Eunice.\r Monsignor Howard heads to the local hospital to perform last rites on a particular patient.

Investigating what would later be his common room and finding beds containing TB patients, he met Doctor Arden who he would later hire as his medical adviser in the asylum.  Arden described the remaining patients as incurables.  The two of them carried a patient downstairs to the death chute; Arden said that during the height of the epidemic they would wheel hundreds through the chute in a week.  They'd burn the bodies in a crematorium out back and keep the ashes in urns in the basement of the facility.  The Monsignor refers to them as 'wasted lives'; Arden refers to them as 'wasted opportunities'.  With Arden leaving the facility he would no longer be able to research medicine-- he'd been working on an immune boosters which could prevent any diseases from taking hold in the human body.  When he'd made the point that it would all be for the greater good and would likely be recognized by the higher-ups in Rome, the Monsignor had made his choice.\r In the hospital, Monsignor Howard strangles Shelley to death.\r The Monsignor returns to Briarcliff to have a word with Dr. Arden who is hardly shaken by the situation.  Arden claims that everyone in Briarcliff is a waste and an exemplar of evolutionary failure.  Using them to perform tests is giving them purpose.  His experiments with a combination of syphilis and tuberculosis have produced unseen of results.  What he's done has made them superhuman.  Arden shows him what he calls \"the next stage of human evolution\", a possibility to protect humanity against a Cold War atomic blasts from Russia.  Arthur warns him that shedding light on the experiments will illuminate all of the misdeeds at Briarcliff and that they need to work together to fight their common enemy, Sister Jude. \n"}, {"text": "Does Sister Mary Eunice believe that Jenny killed her friend?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIn the kitchen, Sister Mary Eunice looks after Jenny, the little girl left behind.  When Jenny asks if she can use the knife, Mary Eunice says she's too young.  Jenny says her mother is scared of her because she thinks she killed Josie; Sister Mary Eunice says she did, and that's fine because she didn't like her anyways. She commends Jenny for her authentic impulse and tells her to never lose it.  When Mary Eunice talks about her longing for good friends, she recalls a time where she was tricked and teased in front of an entire group, so she sought refuge with God.  Unfortunately, she says, there is no God.  She'd know. She's the devil.  Now she's taking orders from a nun who drinks and wears trashy lingerie.  Not for long though. \n"}, {"text": "The Monsignor sets Sister Jude up with a job in which city?", "correct": "Pittsburgh", "options": ["Boston", "Atlanta", "Salem"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPittsburgh.\n\n\tSister Jude gets off the phone with Jenny's mother as the Monsignor steps into the room.  She immediately sees a negative expression on his face and he says that Briarcliff may be too much for her to handle.  He's contacted Father Bernard in Pittsburgh about a job posting at his home for wayward girls; he's recommended her to run it.  He has also booked her flight.

Kit explains the confession tape to Thredson and Thredson denies that they ever had a deal in place to keep him at Briarcliff.  Kit says that now he knows he's innocent because Grace saw Alma and she's alive.  Thredson urges him to take responsibility while Kit claims he's a phony and angers his former psychiatrist.\rWhen Thredson heads downstairs, Lana is clearly worried about something; flipping back the blanket on her bed he discovers that she's been attempting to escape.  In fact, she's already weakened the chain attached to her ankle.  Thredson ties her down tighter and believes that she's abandoning her, just like his mother.  He says that he may just have to end it.\r Back at Briarcliff, Sister Mary Eunice sneaks into Jude's room to try on the lingerie and dance seductively.  As the phone rings, Mary Eunice picks it up.

Mary Eunice says that she's already taken care of everything.  She also says she hid some evidence in case he tries to double cross her.  Arthur refuses to see himself as a monster, but instead as a visionary.  He asks why she's protecting him and realizes that she's not in love with him.  He asks what she wants of him and she says he needs to trust her with his entire soul since everything will work out.
