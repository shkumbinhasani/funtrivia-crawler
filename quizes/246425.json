Radar goes through a laundry list of items that will no longer be available.  What item mentioned by Radar elicits a 'That hurts' from Hawkeye?", "correct": "Toilet paper", "options": ["Shuttlecocks", "Flares", "Bed pans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToilet paper.\n\n\tAmong the items that they won't be receiving: fruit, vegetables, assorted food, fuel oil, blankets, bandages, linen, toilet paper (That hurts.), mail call, electric parts, flares, winter clothes, playing cards and shuttlecocks. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Trapper are extremeley annoyed by this new crisis, and make their usual criticisms of the army.  Frank responds that all this ridicule of the army is galling, especially from officers.  Hawkeye claims that he is not an officer, but rather he was simply 'captured' by two members of the draft board.  How was he captured?", "correct": "Butterfly net", "options": ["Tranquilizer gun", "Bear trap", "Tempted with cheese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nButterfly net.\n\n\tIn response to Hawkeye's comment about the buttefly net, Frank rants, 'There you go.  There's your lounge lizard at work!'  Trapper is so amused, he responds, 'That one I gotta write down.' \n"}, {"text": "Henry assigns each of the officers to a certain duty during this supply crisis.  Who is put in charge of camp morale?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Frank", "Hot Lips"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tFrank is assigned to food detail, while Trapper has been put in charge of heat and electric power.  Hawkeye has nabbed maintenance and general supply duty, and Hot Lips is naturally in charge of the nurses.  Finally, we have Radar as housing officer, and Father Mulcahy in charge of morale.  After Trapper here's that Radar is in charge of housing, he asks to see the lad after the meeting is over. \n"}, {"text": "In the mess tent, Father Mulcahy is running a bingo game.  Frank walks in and is especially disgusted by the fact that Klinger is using what items to cover the numbers on his bingo cards?", "correct": "Coffee beans", "options": ["Raisins", "Chickpeas", "Peanuts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoffee beans.\n\n\tSeeing as how the 4077th is low on supplies, it does seem rather frivolous that Father Mulcahy has allowed coffee beans to be used as bingo markers.  On the other hand, it's not as if the beans can't still be used to make coffee.  Frank is also annoyed, or perhaps jealous, that Klinger wears a mink coat. \n"}, {"text": "In Margaret's tent, Frank and Hot Lips try to keep warm together while eating something Frank has stolen from the kitchen.  What food item(s) has Frank illegally and very selfishly required for himself and Margaret?", "correct": "Ham", "options": ["Fried chicken", "Cake", "Cookies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHam.\n\n\tAs food supply officer, Frank has 'requisitioned [the ham] on a chain of command priority basis', to which Margaret gleefully responds, 'You swiped it, right?'  Unfortunately for the two of them, Hawkeye and Trapper show up and sniff out their illegally comestible booty.  After confiscating the ham, Hawkeye facetiously says, 'Major, what happened here tonight will never leave this room.' \n"}, {"text": "In order to save on heating, more people have been ordered to sleep together in certain tents.  Henry, Radar, Father Mulcahy and Klinger have all moved into the Swamp.

When asked what can be done about this problem, Henry suggests with a smile, 'Do what my wife does.  Hold me close.' \n"}, {"text": "After his usual vesper, Father Mulcahy recites another, much more amusing prayer that goes as follows:\n\nNow I lay me down to sleep,\na bag of peanuts at my feet.\nIf I should die before I wake...\n\nWhat is the last line of this charming rhyme?", "correct": "Give them to my brother Jake.", "options": ["Bless them for an elephant to take.", "Bake them into a delicious cake.", "Throw them in a lovely lake."], "explanation": "\n\n\nGive them to my brother Jake.\n\n\tThis is Father Mulcahy at his most charming.

With tight supplies, the doctors are in for a rough night! \n"}, {"text": "The following night, the same group of men find themselves packed into Henry's tent, even smaller than the Swamp.  As a result, a hammock has been set up over the cots.  Who sleeps in the hammock?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Klinger", "Trapper", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tOne would think Radar would be the one to choose the hammock, since it would be more fun for a kid, but Frank somehow manages to get rights to it.  The tent is so ridiculously packed that Hawkeye quips, 'What time does this tent reach Ellis Island?' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye notices that Frank has no blanket, and questions the Major about it.

Immediately, Hawkeye and Trapper go to work at removing the socks, much to the consternation of Father Mulcahy, who leaves the tent to set up bingo for the following morning. \n"}, {"text": "During the episode, we see Henry's office slowly emptied of its contents.  By the end of the episode, the only things remaining in there are a box to sit on, the telephone and what other item?", "correct": "Skeleton", "options": ["A globe", "Liquor cabinet", "Picture of Henry's wife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkeleton.\n\n\tIn an earlier scene we see Henry sitting at his desk with no legs.  Henry annoyedly remarks, 'To cut off a man's legs and steal his drawers!'  Later, the entire desk but the desk top has been taken.  Finally, the desk, and practically everything else is gone from Henry's office, but there's a nice echo! \n"}]}
