{"id": "402019", "name": "The Jackbox Party Pack 2 Online Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games G-K"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Fibbage 2\" is hosted by what returning character?", "correct": "Cookie Masterson", "options": ["Schmitty", "Nate Shapiro", "Buzz Lippman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCookie Masterson.\n\n\tAlso typically the host of \"You Don't Know Jack!\", Cookie Masterson brings his trademark wit back for some unique trivia.  In \"Fibbage\", a question is provided.  Your goal isn't to necessarily type the answer, but to give your opponents a believable lie (while picking the correct answer yourself!).  You get points if they pick your lie instead.  This new and improved edition of the game features new themed game categories like 'Celebrity Quotes of Great Importance' and 'Road Trip'. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Fibbage 2\", the De-Fib-Rillator will narrow your answer choices to how many options?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tRegardless of how many players are in your game of \"Fibbage\", you'll have to winnow down your answers to guess the right one.  Everyone in the game will receive a De-Fib-Rillator which can be used anytime between the start of the first round and the end of the second, and using it will knock all but two answers off your selections, one being the correct one and one being a lie. \n"}, {"text": "\"Earwax\" can be played with up to how many players?", "correct": "Eight & 8", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight & 8.\n\n\t\"Earwax\" is essentially \"Cards Against Humanity\", but with with sounds.  One player is randomly selected from your group (ranging from three to eight total players) and they select a prompt from a short list that is put in front of all the other participants.  The other players' goal is to choose two sounds, based on their descriptions, that they think best represent the original prompt when played in succession.  Those players are only revealed when the round is completed. \n"}, {"text": "How many points do players need to win a game of \"Earwax\"?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Seven", "Five", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tSince there can be up to eight players in a game of \"Earwax\", this technically means that you could see up to seventeen rounds of play.  In order to get a point, players must go through the round and have their pair of sounds selected by the person who created the prompt based on their subjective opinion of the match.  Once a player hits three points, the game ends. \n"}, {"text": "Over the course of the game \"Bidiots\", players need to make how many works of art?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Three", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\t\"Bidiots\" is the game, from this set, that puts the players to the test with their creative abilities, asking them to create two works that will ultimately be bid on by the other players during that stage of the game.  You start with $3000 with which you can buy art and you'll be given hints about the works to be shown in the auction so that you can optimize your profits.  Players will earn based on the payout while, at the same time, spend their money to advance.  The winner at the end of the game is the person who's best able to navigate the tough world of auction buying. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Bidiots\", someone who needs more cash with which to bid on art can do so with offerings from which of these alleged accredited sources?", "correct": "Predatory Loans", "options": ["Manic Loans", "Impulsive Loans", "Highly-Interested Loans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPredatory Loans.\n\n\tIf you don't have a handle on your funds or you think it's necessary to gird your wallet, then you might go ahead and claim some Predatory Loans which, of course, will need to be paid back with interest at the end of the game.  Some auction-goers might find it necessary to give in and purchase a loan if only because they've been on the receiving end of another player's Screw which, like in other \"Jackbox\" Games, can force a player to act out of turn. In this case, it can make them bid when they don't want to.  Predatory Loans have a catchy jingle, but they can mean the difference between winning and losing. \n"}, {"text": "\"Quiplash XL\" is the fourth game to show up in \"The Jackbox Party Pack 2\".  Did the non-XL version appear in \"Pack 1\"?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAlthough \"Quiplash\" appears here in its 'XL' format with more questions than before, the original \"Quiplash\" was released as a stand-alone game before making its debut in the \"Party Packs\".  In this game, your goal is to answer prompts given in each round with the answer you think will appeal to the rest of the players.  If your answer is voted the better of the two made, you get points.  Two general rounds and a Last Lash are all that matter; at the end, the one with the most points wins. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Quiplash XL\", what is achieved when your answer receives all of the votes given by other players?", "correct": "A Quiplash", "options": ["A Jinx", "A Perfect", "A Win Token"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Quiplash.\n\n\tGetting a Quiplash will give you bonus points as well, so creating an answer that really hits the spot can be doubly advantageous.  Simply progressing through the game will increase the point values on its own since the second round is worth more than the first (so a fumble early on won't be the end of the game).  Of course, the Last Lash is worth the most points and the best answers are determined by the other players' first, second, and third choices for fitting answers.\r A Jinx is declared when both players write the exact same answer. \n"}, {"text": "For how many days do you complete 'The Job' in \"Bomb Corp?", "correct": "Fifteen", "options": ["Three", "Ten", "Fifty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFifteen.\n\n\t'The Job' is this particular game's story mode.  In this, between one and four players head off to their new job and need to complete a series of tasks for each day they attend.  While some of these jobs may be banal, their success depends on their capabilities.  Of course, it wouldn't be a job at Bomb Corp if there weren't bombs to stop either.  Your aim is to use your handheld device to do your task and contribute to the group's activities. \n"}, {"text": "Let's say you don't want to play the story mode for \"Bomb Corp.\"  What alternative mode can you play instead?", "correct": "The Grind", "options": ["The Hobby", "The Squad", "Da Bomb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Grind.\n\n\tWhile 'The Job' follows a storyline, 'The Grind' allows players to shoot for a high score by playing through challenges and modules until they screw up.  In addition to bombs, office workers need to go about their mundane tasks as well-- making copies, defusing bombs, sorting file folders.  Just like in 'The Job', the aim is to work together, a task typically unseen in \"Jackbox\" games. \n"}]}
