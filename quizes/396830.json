In Moscow, the conference plays as Ivan Vanko's father breathes his last breath, claiming that the billionaire should actually be his son.  Soon after, Ivan looks through his father's blueprints - he was the man who created the ARC reactor along with Tony Stark's father - and starts work on building his own, all the while collecting more and more info about Tony Stark's exploits as an international superhero.\rSix months later, Tony launches himself from a plane into a night sky full of fireworks, landing himself onstage at the Stark Expo in New York City to somewhat cockily admit to maintaining peace in the world and to promote new technology. \n"}, {"text": "Tony Stark is called upon for a senate hearing because his suit may be classified as which of these?", "correct": "A weapon", "options": ["An illegal construct", "A nuclear threat", "Alien tech"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA weapon.\n\n\tBackstage at the Stark Expo, Tony reviews his blood toxicity levels and finds that he's up to 19%; the number seems to be growing.  As he leaves the expo he's served with a subpoena and told to head to Washington D.C. the next morning specifically to sit in at a hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee.  The reason is that his Iron Man Suit is seen as part of a weaponized suit defence program and it's expected that he relinquish it to the government which, obviously, he does not wish to do.  The DOD's Primary Weapons Contractor, Justin Hammer, is called into the room to discuss the suit, claiming that it's a sword and Stark is trying to call it a shield.  James Rhodes is also called into the room having compiled a report on the Iron Man suit and, out of context, Rhodes' comments are used against Stark.  Things turn around, however, when the senators try to show satellite photos from other nations' attempts at making copy suits.  Stark debunks these claims though, also showing that Hammer himself is responsible for trying to make his own prototype.  He also makes the claim that he has privatized world peace, and that's probably good enough for now.\rIvan Vanko continues to watch, live, in Moscow.  He's been hard at work for six months.  His unique, new suit, and the dangerous weapons he's made for it, seem to be coming together quite nicely. \n"}, {"text": "Tony appoints who of these as his successor at Stark Industries?", "correct": "Pepper Potts", "options": ["Natalie Rushman", "Justin Hammer", "James Rhodes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPepper Potts.\n\n\tTony is informed by J.A.R.V.I.S., his computer AI, that continued use of the Iron Man suit seems to be accelerating his blood toxicity condition.  After the senate hearing, he's already up to 24%.  Another core has been depleted as well, so the palladium is turning out to be an unfortunate option to keep him alive.  Pepper Potts comes downstairs angry; Tony has given away all of their modern art collection to support the Boy Scouts of America and his Stark Expo was a waste of time.  The argument stops, however, when Tony decides to give Pepper a new job as CEO of Stark Industries, effective immediately.  He needs a successor, he says, and she's the only one who can do the job.  Within a short time, the transfer paperwork is notarized and Pepper takes the lead, appointing Natalie Rushman as her replacement when Tony asks her to... and after witnessing her skills in a boxing ring.\rIn Russia, Ivan Vanko receives a passport and tickets to the Monaco Historic Grand Prix. \n"}, {"text": "Tony brings his Iron Man suit to Monaco, but in what form?", "correct": "It's packed into a briefcase", "options": ["It's called upon with a remote", "It's shipped in a crate", "It's worn under his clothes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's packed into a briefcase.\n\n\tTony and Pepper head to Monaco to attend the Grand Prix and Natalie seems to take to her role perfectly.  When they head to the bar, Tony is ambushed by not only Justin Hammer, but investigative reporter Christine Everhart; both of them are far from Stark's favourite people.  The event is worsened by Tony's new blood toxicity level-- 53%-- and it's because of this that he decides to hop a fence and jump into a car to become a racer in the grand prix, shocking everyone. It's not the most shocking thing though.  Ivan Vanko, posing as a pit crew member, walks into the track to demonstrate his ARC-powered suit, burning his outfit away and using his electric whips to cut a car in half. Tony's bodyguard, Happy, and Pepper drive against the traffic of the race to try and stop Tony, but they arrive too late; Tony's race car is sheared apart, nearly killing him.  Tony gets out of the crash before Ivan is able to cut him out of it, but the fight is clearly unfair and Tony needs to use what little he has to his advantage.  He's ultimately saved when Happy and Pepper crash into Vanko... repeatedly.  He dons the suit from the briefcase in Pepper's care and starts to fight Vanko, but the electric whips seem to affect his suit unlike anything else.  He's barely able to remove the ARC core from Vanko's chest and put an end to the fight. \n"}, {"text": "Vanko receives help to escape from prison.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tVanko is thrown in jail and Tony is allowed to go and speak with him alone, and when Tony asks Vanko why he didn't just sell his tech to the highest bidder, Vanko responds that the Starks are thieves and butchers.  He simply wanted to get revenge for the families' lives he destroyed.  If he can show the world that Tony Stark can bleed, they will stop believing in him.\rThe attack does much to fuel backlash from politicians who double down on trying to get Stark to hand the suit over as a dangerous weapon.  Tony, meanwhile, continues to try and avoid telling anyone the truth about his condition and tries to stop Pepper from taking him back to his birthday party in Los Angeles.\rIn prison, Vanko receives a letter along with his meal and short time later, his planned escape is orchestrated.  He's brought to an airplane hangar for dinner with Justin Hammer and Hammer wants to talk business.  They both decide to work together and head back to Queens together to look through Hammer's labs.\rRhodes finds Tony looking up info on Vanko in his workshop, showing up to ask about the suits.  Tony refuses to back down, however, even though he's clearly not doing well. \n"}, {"text": "Whose words convince Tony to spend his birthday party drunk?", "correct": "Natalie's", "options": ["Rhodes'", "Pepper's", "J.A.R.V.I.S.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNatalie's.\n\n\tOn the night of his birthday party, Stark ends up reaching 89% palladium concentration.  Natalie arrives and agrees with him that the party should be cancelled, but they proceed anyways.  He asks what she would do if it were her last birthday party, and Tony gets an answer that encourages him to wear his Mark IV suit and drink copiously. By the time Rhodes arrives, Tony is stumbling around and breaking things.  Pepper tries to end the night and Tony ignores her concerns, dangerously flaunting his suit.  Rhodes, needing to teach Tony a lesson, heads down to the workshop, dons an earlier prototype, and kicks everyone out. They don't go far, instead hanging around outside to watch the two friends fight and destroy the house in mech suits.  Tony scares them off moments before the two launch blasts from their hands, and it's enough to blow up the sitting room.  Tony looks up in time to see Rhodes depart into the sky with the old suit.  Rhodes flies it all the way to the Mojave Desert, landing it at a local Air Force base. \n"}, {"text": "Natalie, as it turns out, is also working for who of these?", "correct": "Nick Fury", "options": ["Justin Hammer", "Obadiah Stane", "Ivan Vanko"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNick Fury.\n\n\tNick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. finds Tony at a donut shop and takes him inside for a talk, and while it's apparent that Fury wants Tony to join their secretive group, Tony's just not interested.  Just as Fury notices the palladium poisoning that's been spreading up Tony's neck, Natalie walks into the shop, revealing herself to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent by the name of Natasha Romanov who's been tasked with shadowing Stark.  Romanov injects Tony with a shot of lithium dioxide to abate the symptoms of his poisoning.  They plan to get him back to work.\rBack at Stark's destroyed mansion, Nick Fury talks to Tony about the ARC reactor, claiming his father always saw it as the next step on the way to a more powerful energy source; he was onto something big that ruined older power sources.  Fury also knows Vanko; Vanko tried to sell the technology, so Howard Stark had him deported and he lived his life in exile in Russia.  Perhaps most importantly, Howard Stark co-founded S.H.I.E.L.D., and Fury has brought a box of his belongings along so that Tony can work out the solution to the problems before them all.\rVanko and Hammer start to have difficulties at the workshop, especially when Hammer's prototype is changed to remove the suits' helmets and include a drone.  Hammer is kept busy anyways.  When the Air Force gets word of Rhodes' Iron Man prototype, they opt to give it to Hammer to weaponize it for the Stark Expo.  In exchange for the prototype, Hammer offers them weapons of all sorts; Rhodes takes all of it. \n"}, {"text": "What, as it turns out, did Howard Stark leave behind for his son?", "correct": "A new element", "options": ["A fully-formed suit", "Ownership of S.H.I.E.L.D.", "A bottle of bourbon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA new element.\n\n\tTony roots through his father's effects and finds all manner of items including old blueprints, news clippings, and film reels.  When he plays through the film reel, it appears that he, as a child, is also in the clips.  But that's not the important part.  His father also left a message for him, indicating that he left his life's work so that he could unlock its secrets when the technology is ready. Tony figures it out.  He heads to Pepper's office and tries to apologize to her, admitting the truth, but Pepper needs to leave for an engagement.  The old diorama of Stark Expo is still in the room though, and when he looks at it, he realizes that there's something fishy about it.  If the Unisphere were an atom, the outlying buildings would create a new element - one that his father hypothesized 20 years ago - and it would be a suitable replacement for palladium. On its own, it would be unable to be synthesized, but with Tony's abilities and resources, it's possible.  He builds a particle accelerator in his lab and, before he knows it, he has the component he needs to save his life. \n"}, {"text": "At the Stark Expo, Justin Hammer controls all of his drone units and Rhodes' suit.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhen Vanko informs Hammer of a change to his prototype plans, things get heated and Hammer decides to go to the Stark Expo alone.  Vanko decides to call Stark at his home, breaking through the communications block to warn him that he will undo his family legacy.  Stark is only able to trace the call to New York City but no further, though he knows that Hammer's presentation is at the Expo.  He decides not to run tests on the new core; he doesn't have time.\rPepper, Natasha, and Happy arrive at the Expo in time for Hammer's presentation and take to the audience to watch the introduction of a new army - the Hammer Drones of the Army, the Navy, the Marines, and the Air Force.  As the drones hit the stage, Vanko is hard at work, operating computers from afar.  And then James Rhodes hits the stage, demonstrating the functional human suit.\rBut the presentation is interrupted twice.  First, Tony arrives and informs Rhodes that Vanko is still alive to try and put the presentation away.  Second, Vanko overrides Rhodes' suit and the controls of all of the drones, pushing them to take Tony Stark as a target and to take to the skies to chase him.\rBehind the scenes, Hammer discovers that he has no control of the situation.  Romanov compels him to mention Vanko as the culprit while Pepper calls the NYPD to get Hammer arrested for his crimes.  As the Expo is evacuated and civilians attempt to flee the scene, Romanov and Happy head to Hammer Industries. \n"}, {"text": "Vanko reveals that he programmed all of the drones to do which of these on his command?", "correct": "Self-destruct", "options": ["Cloak", "Hibernate", "Self-replicate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSelf-destruct.\n\n\tRomanov infiltrates Hammer Industries, swiftly taking out the guards as she searches for Vanko.  She's not successful in reaching Vanko before he can escape, but she does find a way into his control room to find a way to hack back into Rhodes' suit prototype.  As he and Tony fight in one of the pavilions, Rhodes regains control and the truth is revealed; Pepper also ends up in on the call to find out that he risked dying of palladium poisoning.  The argument has to wait.  As soon as Rhodes can move properly, he and Tony are surrounded by Hammer Drones and shots are fired.  Together, they take them all out.\rRomanov informs the friends that there's one final drone and it turns out to be Vanko in his new and improved suit, complete with stronger electric whips.  Both Tony and Rhodes find themselves at a disadvantage at the end of the whips, and with their final efforts, they do what they did in Tony's house - they fire concussive blasts from their hands, causing an explosion that tears them free and critically wounds Vanko.  It's not over though.  As Vanko lays on the ground, he activates his suit and the drones around him, triggering a self-destruct sequence.  With a jet blast, Tony swoops in and grabs Pepper before she explodes and, although he saves her life and brings her to safety, she resigns her position.  Their argument devolves quickly though, as it seems they both still have business on the mind, and they both kiss... even though Rhodes is on the same roof.\rAfter all is said and done, Tony speaks to Nick Fury at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters for debriefing.  Fury no longer wants him assigned to the Avengers Initiative or obvious reasons, and Romanov, in her report on Stark, claims he is a narcissist prone to self-destructive tendencies.  Basically, Romanov advises that Iron Man is a good fit, but Tony Stark was not.  As such, he will not be needed by S.H.I.E.L.D. unless as a consultant.  He refuses; he's too expensive. \n"}]}
