{"id": "407247", "name": "Detours of \"The Amazing Race 29\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 29"], "questions": [{"text": "During the first Detour selection of the race, 'Shoot' or 'Scoot', teams had to utilize which of these, regardless of task chosen?", "correct": "Canoe", "options": ["Ladder", "Blowgun", "Bicycle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanoe.\n\n\tBoth tasks, taking place at the Gamboa Rainforest Resort outside Panama City, Panama, allowed teams to head out onto the Chagres River to test their strength or their dexterity.  In 'Shoot', teams used a bow and arrow and, balancing in a dugout cayuco, needed to hit two fish targets.  In 'Scoot', teams instead headed out into the river to race against professional rowers in a modern cayuco, shrinking their race course for every missed attempt against them.  Most teams completed 'Scoot' while only Becca and Floyd managed to finish 'Shoot'. \n"}, {"text": "In S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil in Leg 2, an even amount of teams completed both sides of the Detour.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tArriving in this massive city, teams could choose either 'Keep the Beat' or 'Work Your Feet' for their Detour task.  In the former, teams needed to keep the beat with instruments, each taking a different traditional item to play with a samba troupe in the city's streets while in the latter, teams visited a boxing gym to use their physical strength and eye for detail to build a workout station.  Both challenges had an equal number of participants (five and five) before teams moved on to the Road Block. \n"}, {"text": "During the third leg of the race, a Blind Double U-Turn, found before the Detour, ended up knocking which team out of the race?", "correct": "Seth and Olive", "options": ["Matt and Redmond", "Vanck and Ashton", "Tara and Joey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeth and Olive.\n\n\tReaching the island of Zanzibar in Leg 3, teams faced a Blind Double U-Turn that allowed two teams to U-Turn two other teams without anyone knowing the identity of the user.  It meant that Tara and Joey could U-Turn Seth and Olive and Vanck and Ashton could U-Turn Matt and Redmond, forcing them to complete both sides of the upcoming Detour task before continuing with the race.  In this leg, nearly all teams decided to build desks for local schoolchildren instead of weaving coconut leaf baskets, and while Matt and Redmond powered through the leg, Seth and Olive fell victim to the extra task. \n"}, {"text": "More teams completed the 'Lock' compared to 'Knock' during the Detour in Leg 4.  Both tasks were completed in which city?", "correct": "Stone Town", "options": ["Dar es Salaam", "Dodoma", "Mbeya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStone Town.\n\n\tTeams found that both options facing them in Leg 4 were exhausting as they chose between 'Lock' and 'Knock' in Stone Town, Zanzibar.  In 'Lock', teams hauled curio boxes in a Stone Town furniture shop searching through hidden compartments for a key that would unlock their clues while in 'Knock', teams had to race through the streets looking for three royal doors (from which they could collect wood carvings to trade for their next clue).  Following the Detour, teams returned to Dar es Salaam. \n"}, {"text": "During the 'Troll' Detour task in Leg 5, teams obtained a fishing lure with their Pit Stop written on the back.  What five-letter destination were they given?", "correct": "AKSLA", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAKSLA.\n\n\tVisiting the Art Nouveau-lined canals of \u00c5lesund, Norway in Leg 5, teams needed to choose between two similarly-named tasks-- 'Trolls' or 'Troll'-- and both involved the pairs searching for items in the city.  In 'Trolls', teams used a map and a poem to hunt out people dressed as trolls, hidden in the unique architecture of the city streets while in 'Troll', teams hopped into kayaks and searched the canals for fishing lures marked with race colours. In both cases, teams were given the name AKSLA, the name of their next destination, a mountain overlooking the city, and with it they could find their fifth Pit Stop. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 6, teams faced a Double U-Turn on Lake Como in Italy.  How many teams were forced to complete both Detour tasks?", "correct": "One", "options": ["Two", "Three", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tIn a clear case of social racing, all six other teams conspired against Vanck and Ashton.  Liz and Michael U-Turned the pair and Becca and Floyd U-Turned Liz and Michael, effectively blocking the board from being used by anyone else.  It meant that the pair, who were eliminated by the board, had to do both 'Make a Mold' and 'Grab a Hold'.  In 'Make a Mold', teams had to make an art piece, creating a man-shaped ghost from wire and wet plaster while in 'Grab a Hold', teams went rock climbing up a sheer cliff on the edge of Lake Como. Only Tara and Joey and London and Logan chose to complete the former task. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Detour tasks in Venice, Italy (in Leg 7) allowed teams to ride in a gondola?", "correct": "'Sing It'", "options": ["'Bring It'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Sing It'.\n\n\tEach Detour option teams faced in Venice allowed them to navigate Venice by unique means.  In 'Sing It', teams had to pair up with a musician to learn a traditional song that they would be able to sing to gondola patrons on the canals of the city while in 'Bring It', teams used a local method of transporting luggage through the alleys and across the ornate bridges of Venice.  Both tasks were completed evenly with three teams completing 'Sing It' and the other three completing 'Bring It' before heading onward to the Road Block. \n"}, {"text": "In both Detour options in Leg 8, teams delivered items to which of the following Greek events?", "correct": "Wedding", "options": ["Fair", "Funeral", "Decathlon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWedding.\n\n\tIn the town of Arachova, Greece, teams scrambled to beat each other to a Double U-Turn before making one delivery or another for the bride or groom of an ongoing Greek Wedding.  In 'For the Bride', teams delivered milk, on mules, to local cheesemakers to collect cheese for the bride; in 'For the Groom', teams raced up the mountain to collect sheep to deliver or the groom.  Becca and Floyd and Liz and Michael were both victims of the Double U-Turn in this leg, meaning they needed to complete both options regardless.  All teams, otherwise, completed the bride's task. \n"}, {"text": "If teams completed the 'Bamboo Climb' Detour task in Hanoi, Vietnam, they had to pick up a ladder.  How many ladders were available to teams?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "Five", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tVisiting Hanoi in Leg 9, teams received a Detour clue making them pick either 'Bamboo Climb' or 'Window Design'.  In the former task, teams had to nab one of three ladders and, using it, reach a city rooftop from which they could collect a waiting birdcage.  This task was a limited station Detour option, but if a team returned their ladder at the end of the task, another team could claim it.  Otherwise, they could complete 'Window Design', for which they could move mannequins through the streets and use them to decorate a storefront. \n"}, {"text": "None of the final three legs of the race featured a Detour task.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn a race rarity, the Detour tasks dried up by the time the teams left the ninth leg of the race while normally this would stop just before the finale (with a double Road Block being the norm).  This race changed the trend completely, though teams did experience a Detour task (and three Double U-Turns) in the first nine consecutive legs. \n"}]}
