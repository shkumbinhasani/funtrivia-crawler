{"id": "191490", "name": "The Film History of Orson Welles Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed S-Z", " Orson Welles"], "questions": [{"text": "Citizen Kane is widely believed to be Orson Welles' cinematic masterpiece.  Is it true that this was his first time directing a full-length studio film?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tOne can hardly say enough in praise of the 26-year old Orson Welles who, following the success of his popular radio program and stage plays, was able to parlay his cumulative critical accolades into a big studio contract.  Given carte blanche by RKO Radio Pictures to produce this film, Welles (and all those involved) proceeded to create in 1941 what many call the greatest American film.  Despite the excellence of the film, it caused a firestorm of controversy, especially as a result of the fact that it obviously put William Randolph Hearst's life in a negative light.  Hearst would cause Welles great trouble as a result of this picture, so much so that Welles' Hollywood directing career would sputter out after a few short years.\r For more on 'Citizen Kane', why not try my series of quizzes on the film?

The version of this film currently extant is missing approximately 50 minutes from Welles' original cut (and contains a happy ending not approved of by Welles), as RKO decided to remove his total creative license following the controversy caused by 'Citizen Kane'.  \r Another interesting tidbit...there is a rumor that Booth Tarkington based the character George from the book on Welles himself, being the recalcitrant child that he was.  Apparently, Tarkington was a Welles family friend. \n"}, {"text": "The Orson Welles-directed 1946 film 'The Stranger' was based on the novel by the French existentialist novelist Albert Camus.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOddly enough, this is not true.  Rather, the Welles film was based on a story by Victor Trivas about a Nazi war criminal who has hidden himself away in the United States.  This was the first Welles-directed film to feature studio actors (Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young, among others).  It was also the first post-World War II film to include Nazi Holocaust footage. \n"}, {"text": "In 1947, Welles created the film-noir 'The Lady from Shanghai', which featured Welles, several of Welles' Mercury Theater actors, and what Hollywood leading lady?", "correct": "Rita Hayworth", "options": ["Jean Simmons", "Marilyn Monroe", "Audrey Hepburn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRita Hayworth.\n\n\tNow working for Columbia Pictures, Orson Welles was able to create this marvelous film using many of his personal favorite actors, and Rita Hayworth to boot!  As with 'Ambersons', this film was manipulated quite a lot by the producers, who made several film edits, and forced Welles to include more close-up shots of Hayworth.  Regardless, the final product is still enjoyable to behold. \n"}, {"text": "The first of Orson Welles' magnificent films based on Shakespeare's works was his 'Macbeth', created in 1948.  Who played Macbeth in this work of cinematic art?", "correct": "Orson Welles", "options": ["Erskine Sanford", "Joseph Cotten", "Roddy McDowall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrson Welles.\n\n\tRoddy McDowall also appeared in the film as Malcolm, while Erskine Sanford, a regular player in Welles' films, played Duncan (Another Welles regular, Cotten did not appear).  Welles' himself took the challenge of playing the Scottish nobleman Macbeth and did so triumphantly.  People forget that Welles was an excellent actor along with being an almost unparalleled auteur. \n"}, {"text": "Several years after Welles' first stab at Shakespeare with 'Macbeth', the director-extraordinaire created another film adapted from the Bard.  Which of these Shakespeare plays was made into a Welles film in 1952?", "correct": "Othello", "options": ["Titus Andronicus", "Julius Caesar", "The Merchant of Venice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOthello.\n\n\tThe full English language title for Welles' Othello was 'The Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice'.  No longer connected to any Hollywood studio, the film was produced with great difficulty by Welles himself.  He received funding from various sources, many European, and finally finished the film by using the salary he received from films like 'The Third Man'.  The daring Welles once again played the lead role and succeeded brilliantly. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the 1955 Welles-directed film that was based on a novel written by Welles himself?", "correct": "Mr. Arkadin", "options": ["London", "Butterfly", "Compulsion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Arkadin\n\n\tFilmed entirely in Europe, where Welles worked for most of the 1950s, Mr. Arkadin was funded by French and Spanish donors.  Based on a novel written by Welles, it tells the story of an American ex-pat in Europe who is hired to investigate the life of a mysterious and very wealthy man named Arkadin.  In some ways, the story has parellels with 'Kane'.  Again, Welles appears in the title role, this time as the eccentric Arkadin. \n"}, {"text": "Back in the United States in 1958, Welles directed and co-starred in a film-noir classic called 'Touch of Evil'.  Which of these Hollywood leading men starred alongside Welles in this dark thriller?", "correct": "Charlton Heston", "options": ["Montgomery Clift", "Cary Grant", "William Holden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlton Heston.\n\n\tNot only did Charlton Heston co-star with Welles, he was also responsible for getting Welles hired as the director.  Welles was merely set to star in this picture, produced by Universal Pictures, but Heston had signed on to the film under the impression that Welles was to be the director, and insisted that the latter be allowed to perform directing duties.  \r Unfortunately, despite this good-natured gesture by Heston, Welles again found himself frequently annoyed by pestering studio executives.  He typically filmed at night in order to avoid interference by envoys from the studio, but alas this film was not able to escape the meddlesome editing that seems inevitable with Hollywood productions.  Interestingly enough, Welles wrote an angry letter to the studio insisting that his original cut be restored.  It turns out that Heston ultimately came into possession of this letter, and when the film came out in re-release in 1998, a version more faithful to Welles' original was offered to the public.  This and 'Ben Hur' were the two greatest things Mr. Heston has done...thank you sir! \n"}, {"text": "In 1962, Welles, back in Europe, directed a film called 'Le Proc\u00e8s', otherwise known as 'The Trial'.  Upon whose novel was this work of surrealistic extravagance based?", "correct": "Franz Kafka", "options": ["Jean-Paul Sartre", "Antonio Gramsci", "Friedrich Nietzsche"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFranz Kafka.\n\n\tIf you haven't seen 'The Trial', a film based on the hauntingly brilliant work by Kafka, you must.  Starring Anthony Hopkins as Josef K. and Orson Welles as Hastler, it tells the tale of a man accused of and put on trial for a crime he has not committed...in fact, he is never even told what the crime is!  \r This film is a work of cinematic surrealism that must be seen to be believed.  Welles himself considered 'The Trial' to be his masterpiece. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the documentary-style film, released in 1993, that contains footage of a documentary project that Welles had been working on in the early 1940s in Brazil?", "correct": "It's All True", "options": ["Hollywood's Shame", "The Horror!", "One Man's Failure"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's All True.\n\n\tIn 1942, Welles was sent by RKO pictures, at the behest of Nelson Rockefeller, to shoot a documentary film in South America.  The producers expected that Orson Welles would film something like a travel picture, jaunting from one large city to another.  Instead, Welles spent his time documenting the life of the average citizens in Brazil.  When RKO discovered what Welles was up to (and after hearing strange rumors of Welles' behavior) they stopped his funding and forced the director's return to the United States.  \r A great deal of the footage he shot during his foray into Latin America was worked into the 1993 release 'It's All True', a documentary that attempts to investigate Welles' South American efforts.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and learned as much as I did.  If you did appreciate it, I would suggest trying some of my other quizzes. \n"}]}
