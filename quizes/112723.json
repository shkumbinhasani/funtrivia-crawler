{"id": "112723", "name": "Interesting! Entrancing! In/En Words! Quiz | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Words Within Words", "Starting With.."], "questions": [{"text": "To begin...Which of these 'in' words signifies something incomplete, or in its beginning?", "correct": "Inchoate", "options": ["Ineluctable", "Innervate", "Inspissate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInchoate.\n\n\tThe word 'inchoate' is derived originally from the Latin 'inchoare', which means 'to start work on'...which certainly applies to our progress through this quiz thus far! \n"}, {"text": "The word 'endemic' means 'of a particular place'.  Which of the following words would NOT be synomymous with this term?", "correct": "Extraneous", "options": ["Autochthonous", "Aboriginal", "Indigenous"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExtraneous.\n\n\tThe words indigenous, autochthonous and aboriginal all describe something local or native, as does endemic.  Something extraneous comes from the outside, and hence that word would be an antonym! \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following words comes originally from the Latin word for 'island' or 'islet'?", "correct": "Insulin", "options": ["Infant", "Indict", "Incubus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsulin.\n\n\tThis question should make sense to anyone who knows about the anatomy of the pancreas, which contains cells called the 'islets of Langerhans'.  These cells produce both insulin and glucagon, hormones that control blood sugar levels.  The Latin word for island is 'insula'. \n"}, {"text": "If you are a specialist in 'entomology', what sort of creatures would you be most likely to study?", "correct": "Beetles", "options": ["Sparrows", "Opossums", "Iguanas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeetles.\n\n\tAn entomologist specializes in the study of insects, of which certainly beetles are a common type.  The word is derived from the Greek 'entomon', meaning 'insect'! \n"}, {"text": "Here's a very difficult 'in' word.  What would you imagine the word 'ingannation' to mean?", "correct": "Fraud", "options": ["Rash", "Blotched", "Solid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFraud.\n\n\tIngannation is a rather obscure word, not commonly used in everyday speech to be sure...but an English word nonetheless!  Derived from the Latin 'ingannare', it means 'cheat' or 'deception'.  I assure you, this question is no ingannation! \n"}, {"text": "Another tough question.  Which of these 'in' phrases literally means 'in the breast' in Italian, and is commonly used to describe something 'secret' or 'private'?", "correct": "In petto", "options": ["In dulcea", "In coporoa", "In chesto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn petto.\n\n\tNot a commonly used expression, it has been employed to describe the Pope's 'secret' selection of a cabal of cardinals who, not having reached the 'qualifications' of that high office as of yet, remain in study until such time as their appointments can become official.  Perhaps you could use it to describe your secret stash of candy...I keep my stash 'in petto' under my bed, where no one, except maybe ants, can find it! \n"}, {"text": "Which rolled Mexican food, coming in cheese, beef or chicken varieties and covered with sauce, begins with the letters 'En'?", "correct": "Enchilada & Enchiladas", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEnchilada & Enchiladas.\n\n\tAn enchilada typically has a meat filling (though cheese is frequently introduced in place of meat) and covered with a chili-based sauce that is certain to inflame your mouth and enchant your palate! \n"}, {"text": "True or false: If I am 'enamored' with someone I have become hopelessly in love with him/her.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIf you are enamored (or enamoured in the British spelling) with an acquaintance, you certainly are in trouble!  To 'enamor' a person is to inflame them with love...please tell me, are you enamored with this quiz? \n"}, {"text": "Which of these 'En' words could be properly used to describe the action of holding another person spellbound?", "correct": "All of these!", "options": ["Enthrall", "Entrance", "Enchant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these!.\n\n\tGenerally, these 'En' words have a negative connotation, but they can be used to describe something beautiful, such as a painting or sculpture, that simply draws the attention of the crowd. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these 'in' words could be used to describe a person who indulges excessively in alcohol containing substances?", "correct": "Intemperate", "options": ["Indolent", "Inconstant", "Intrepid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIntemperate.\n\n\tAn intemperate person is one given to excesses, and certainly the indulgence in drink is one of the most dangerous excesses faced by humans in their history.  Let us not give into our temptations...unless they involve playing more trivia quizzes!  Thank you for playing mine...I invite you to try my other stuff if you enjoyed this one. \n"}]}
