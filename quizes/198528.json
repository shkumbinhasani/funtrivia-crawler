{"id": "198528", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Cowboy' Trivia Game | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "As this episode opens, a chopper arrives at the 4077th; more wounded for the doctors at our favorite M*A*S*H unit.  It is here that we were encounter the Cowboy.  What is unusual about his entrance?", "correct": "He has been wounded in the shoulder", "options": ["He crashes the chopper", "The chopper lands in the middle of camp", "The chopper is carrying five wounded soldiers (many more than usual)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has been wounded in the shoulder.\n\n\tCowboy is ably played by Billy Bush.  \r I'm not sure why he is nicknamed 'Cowboy', maybe it is because he wears a two-gun holster, a cowboy hat and cowboy boots, hmm?  Kidding aside, the poor fellow has been wounded in the chest, and after landing on the helipad, he exits his chopper and collapses to the ground. \n"}, {"text": "In the operating room, the doctors work assidiously to repair the broken bodies of the freshly wounded young soldiers in the latest 'shipment'.  Father Mulcahy lends a hand in his own special way, delivering a blessing to one soldier in what language?", "correct": "Hebrew", "options": ["German", "Gaelic", "Italian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHebrew.\n\n\tApparently, Father Mulcahy is a polylingual adept.  When discovering that the soldier Trapper is working on is named Goldstein, Mulcahy recites a Hebrew blessing on the young man.  In future episodes, Mulcahy displays a great open-mindedness regarding world religions and a willingness to bless people of virtually any faith. \n"}, {"text": "Following surgery, Trapper and a nurse decide to make a little getaway in a jeep.  Frank Burns will hear nothing of it and attempts to prevent the two from leaving for their 'nature study'.  Henry Blake arrives, and Trapper attempts to convince Henry to allow him use of the jeep by providing what sort of analogy?", "correct": "Baseball", "options": ["Traffic", "Chemistry", "Horse racing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaseball.\n\n\tTrapper complains of his 'curve ball', and calls the nurse his 'pitching coach'.  He claims that she has already straightened out his 'screw ball' and that she has 'great stuff'.  I'll allow you to figure out the meaning of Trapper's unusual anecdote.\r As for the success of his ruse, let us just say that Trapper should attempt a career in marketing. \n"}, {"text": "After Trapper's request is rejected and Hawkeye's efforts to allow the desperate Cowboy to return home for personal reasons rebuffed, they come to the conclusion that Henry is simply too tense.  Hawkeye decides to take Henry out for a game of golf.  What is par for the first hole of their golf course?", "correct": "29", "options": ["191", "4,700", "7"], "explanation": "\n\n\n29.\n\n\tThe first hole is absurdly long, Henry can only see the 'flag' (actually, a starched bra on a pole) by using binoculars.  Hawkeye suggests that 'the minefields are out of bounds on the left and that the Chinese Communists are out of bounds on the right'.  \r Naturally, Henry's second shot is ruined by a sniper who fires and hits his ball.  So much for relaxation! \n"}, {"text": "Thanks to the mischievous mettling of an errant sniper Hawkeye's plan for a relaxing golf game falls to pieces.  Later that evening, Henry is depicted nervously attempting to relax in his tent.  After a drink of seltzer, he settles into bed.  Suddenly, which of the following things happens to his tent?", "correct": "A jeep drives through it", "options": ["It is doused with hundreds of gallons of water", "It is set on fire", "A telephone pole crashes on top of it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA jeep drives through it.\n\n\tHenry appears to believe he is safe in his tent, but alas not.  As soon as he tucks himself into bed, a driverless jeep careens through his tent.  Radar finds Henry under the collapsed tent door, with the latter muttering a few words like 'jeep', 'crash' and 'kill'. \n"}, {"text": "After two near-death experiences, Henry now believes someone is making attempts on his life.  Who is the first person Henry accuses?", "correct": "Trapper", "options": ["Cowboy", "Hawkeye", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrapper.\n\n\tHenry amusingly trods into the Swamp holding a boot in one hand.  Training his mildly deranged eyes on Trapper, he utters the confusing accusation, 'Okay, Trapper.  Don't think I don't know what you think I don't know!'  After Trapper reveals his solid alibis for both the afternoon golf game and evening tent debacle, Henry reverts to the nervous stammering he exhibited after his tent collapsed. \n"}, {"text": "The next attempt on Henry's life comes when the poor fellow attempts to use the bathroom (is nothing sacred?)  Soon after Henry walks into the calm serenity of the camp latrine, only to have the tent explode around him.  When the smoke clears, a soot-covered Henry, toilet seat hanging about his neck, utters a single word.  What word is that?", "correct": "Boom", "options": ["Ouch", "Crash", "Help"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoom.\n\n\tAfter leaving the Swamp, Henry departs for the one place in the camp where he believes he can find comfort, the latrine.  However, the camp latrine is no longer the safe haven Henry believes it to be.  Still holding his boot and looking absurd with his dirt-covered face and toilet seat garland, the hapless camp commander is reduced to desperate single-syllabic gestures.  With Hawkeye, Radar, Trapper and two nurses looking on, Henry emits a solitary 'Boom' from his defeated lips. \n"}, {"text": "It is decided that Henry must leave camp immediately, as these threats on his life have gotten out of hand.  Unfortunately, Henry leaves camp with the very man who has been making these dangerous assassination attempts, the Cowboy.  After taking off in the chopper, Henry notices that Cowboy has a parachute on but he doesn't.  What is Cowboy's response to Henry's inquiry about this matter?", "correct": "You don't need one sir, it would only break your fall.", "options": ["Parachutes don't work for no good commanding officers.", "Don't worry sir, we'll soon be over water...lots of water.", "Why?  Don't you think you could land on your feet after a 100 yard fall?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou don't need one sir, it would only break your fall.\n\n\tHenry is certainly not amused by Cowboy's response, but then, Cowboy isn't in the comedic mood.  Meanwhile, back at the 4077th, Trapper and Hawkeye have just discovered the Cowboy's duffle bag.  Clearly, Cowboy is the one making attempts on Henry's life since the bag is full of dynamite, wiring and gunpowder. \n"}, {"text": "Desperately, Trapper and Hawkeye attempt to reach the Cowboy on the short wave radio.  Meantime, Radar arrives with a letter from Cowboy's wife, the very thing the disgruntled chopper pilot has been waiting impatiently for.  On the envelope is revealed Cowboy's hometown.  What is it?", "correct": "Reno, Nevada", "options": ["Tombstone, Arizona", "Dodge City, Kansas", "Houston, Texas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReno, Nevada.\n\n\tTrapper is finally able to contact the Cowboy after making repeated claims that they have a letter from his wife.  Cowboy initially doesn't believe that they have a letter, but rather that they are just trying anything to save Henry.  He is convinced when Trapper reads that the letter is from a Mrs. Jean Hodges of Reno, Nevada.  At first, when 'Reno' is read, they believe Henry is a goner...as that town is well-known as the divorce capital of America.  However, this is actually the city where Cowboy lives. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the episode, Cowboy is only referred to as 'Cowboy'.  Do we ever discover his real name?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed, we do.  The letter is addressed 'Dear John', which typically would be bad news.  Much to Henry's relief, however, John happens to be the Cowboy's real name.  Later in the letter his wife writes, 'dear, dear John', prompting Radar to lower his head and say, 'Wow, a double 'Dear John'!'  \r The episode ends on a happy note, though, as Cowboy's wife reveals her true love for her husband, Mr. John 'Cowboy' Hodges.  No one is more pleased about this than Henry Blake!\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try more of my 'M*A*S*H'-related quizzes in the future. \n"}]}
