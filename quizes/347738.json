{"id": "347738", "name": "Queen Victoria's Secret Quiz | Health and Human Biology | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " Health and Human Biology", "Diseases"], "questions": [{"text": "What blood clotting disorder is Queen Victoria blamed for passing on to many of the royal houses in Europe?", "correct": "Hemophilia", "options": ["Leukemia", "Neutropenia", "Chalazion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHemophilia.\n\n\tHemophilia, or haemophilia, is a genetic blood clotting disorder that usually meant an early death for most of those affected. This is a sex-linked X- chromosome disorder that usually manifests in males. The disorder can be inherited through either parent. For a female to manifest the disease she will have had to inherited the disease from both parents.It is possible that females may have had the disease more often than thought but most would have bled to death upon having their first period. Through her nine children Victoria spread this disease to the royal houses of Spain, Russia and Germany. She, herself, is believed to have carried the trait because of a spontaneous genetic mutation as there was no sign of the disease in her ancestors.The disease became so prevalent in European royalty that it became known as \"the kings' disease\", \"the royal disease\" and \"Victoria's secret\". There are three types of the disease known as A,B, and C. This hereditary disorder impairs the bloods natural ability to clot, varies in severity and death is usually caused by hemorrhage. Today the life expectancy of someone with this disease has risen to 50 years, with proper medication, transfusions, and gene therapy. \n"}, {"text": "Anemia is a condition that involves low levels of which of the following components?", "correct": "Red blood cells", "options": ["White blood cells", "Plasma", "Platelets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed blood cells.\n\n\tThere are many types of anemia, all of them involve low red blood cell counts. Anemia can be caused by medication reactions, other underlying diseases, genetics, and malnutrition. This deficiency in the oxygen-carrying components of the blood can cause many symptoms. The most common symptoms are lethargy, headache, heart palpitations, low body temperature, and shortness of breath. Treatment for this disorder usually focuses on treating the underlying cause if possible. Blood transfusions and oxygen support may also be needed. The disorder may be acute or chronic. \n"}, {"text": "Aplastic anemia is a blood disorder that occurs when which part of the body does not produce enough new cells?", "correct": "Bone marrow", "options": ["Pancreas", "Liver", "Thymus gland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBone marrow.\n\n\tBone marrow is responsible for for producing new blood cells. In aplastic anemia the patient has low counts of all three types of blood cells i.e. red, white, and platelets. Aplasia is the developmental failure of the production of all blood components resulting in low levels of all these components, while anemia refers only to the low levels of red blood cells. While the cause of the disorder is usually not known, it is known to be part of radiation poisoning. This is the disease that killed Marie Curie after her years of exposure to radioactive substances. Exposure to other toxins such as benzene and quinine are believed to have caused some cases.A bone marrow examination is necessary for diagnosis of this disorder and treatment often consists of bone marrow transplants and suppression of the immune system, which is believed to be a component in many cases. This disorder if left untreated, can cause death, and it can also resolve on its own followed by relapse. If a bone marrow transplant cannot be found, the five year survival rate is around 75%. This number rises to close to 90% with a good bone marrow match on patients who are young and otherwise healthy. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following options is a term for many types of blood cancer?", "correct": "Leukemia", "options": ["Leuvan", "Leucine", "Lepidoptera"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeukemia.\n\n\tLeukemia is a term that covers a broad spectrum of blood and bone marrow cancers. While survival rates are rising, death rates from the disease are still very high. The age at onset, quick diagnosis and the type of leukemia are the big factors that affect survival rate. Leukemia is indicated by an abnormal increase of \"blasts\", the informal term for immature white blood cells.The immune system, and central nervous systems are often affected. The cause of leukemia is not known but genetics mutations are suspected. These may occur spontaneously or be a result of radiation or carcinogenic substances.Treatment involves bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. \n"}, {"text": "Polycythemia vera is a blood disorder most likely to be found in which of the following age group of people?", "correct": "50+ years of age", "options": ["1-5 years of age", "5-10 years of age", "Teenagers"], "explanation": "\n\n\n50+ years of age.\n\n\tThe incidence of polycythemia vera increases with age and is most often seen in people over the age of 50. This disorder is caused by the overproduction of red blood cells. In severe cases the bone marrow may also overproduce white blood cells and platelets. This overproduction causes the blood to become thick which can lead to heart attack, deep venous thrombosis and stroke.Patients may also suffer from severe headaches, fatigue, and problems with memory and concentration. There is evidence that genetics play a role as the disease appears to be much more common in Jews of European extraction than any other population demographic.Aspirin as well as other blood thinners may be prescribed as well as bloodletting. If left untreated, this disease can be fatal, but with proper ongoing treatment the patient can expect to live a relatively normal life. \n"}, {"text": "Thrombocytopenia is usually defined as having a very low count of which of the following blood components that is very important in the clotting of blood?", "correct": "Platelets", "options": ["White blood cells", "Plasma", "Red blood cells"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlatelets.\n\n\tThrombocytopenia is the condition of having a very low platelet count  It can be caused by a variety of reasons including genetics, toxins, medicinal reactions or other disease. Treatment includes the administration of corticosteroids to raise platelet levels and treatment of the underlying condition. Symptoms include  bruising, fatigue, and clotting problems. If not treated, death can ensue usually from hemorrhage or infection. \n"}, {"text": "Beta thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that is believed to have originated in what geographical part of the world?", "correct": "Mediterranean region", "options": ["Sub-Arctic North America", "Southern Africa", "South Pacific islands"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMediterranean region.\n\n\tThalassemia is caused by a genetic defect that is believed to have its origins in the Mediterranean areas. Thalassemia affects the globin chains that make up hemoglobin. The two different types of this disorder are found in different parts of the world. The highest incidents of beta thalassemia is found in areas such as Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Crete.Those that carry the trait are endowed with a degree of protection against malaria. The major dangers of this disorder involve accumulation of iron in the body and enlargement of the spleen. Severe thalassemia can also retard growth and cause heart failure.The primary treatment for this disorder is iron chelation. Experiments with umbilical cord blood are also being done. \n"}, {"text": "Which serious blood disorder is shared by musician Miles Davis, NFL players Ronde and Tiki Barber and actor Larenz Tate? ", "correct": "Sickle cell disease", "options": ["Fifth disease", "Catch-scratch disease", "T-cell disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSickle cell disease.\n\n\tSickle cell disease or Sickle cell anemia is a blood disorder that is most often found in people of African or Mediterranean descent. Red blood cells are usually round in shape but in this disorder the red blood cells take on a crescent shape which causes the cells to get stuck in small blood vessels. They also deliver less oxygen to the bodies organs.Painful episodes, referred to as crises, are experienced by the sufferer. Pain occurs in the chest, long bones, abdomen,  and can be accompanied by excessive thirst, heart palpitations, ulcers and strokes. While some patients have serious episodes multiple times a year others will only have mild symptoms every couple of years.The disease is genetic and passed from parents to their children. If a person only gets one copy of this gene from one parent they are said to have sickle cell trait, if a person gets a copy from both parents they will have sickle cell disease. Treatment involves pain medications, folic acid supplements, and antibiotics. Severe cases may end up involving dialysis or kidney transplant, gallbladder removal, and bone marrow transplants. Life expectancy for a sufferer has tripled in the last 50 years. \n"}, {"text": "Macadamia is a blood disorder in which the sufferer is born with blood that is thick, black and sticky.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis statement is completely false. Macadamia is a plant species native to Indonesia, Australia and New Caledonia. These evergreen trees produce the yummy macadamia nut. There is not an actual blood disorder that fits all these criteria, but occasionally old blood can appear to have this texture. It can also appear in the lungs of patients suffering from cholera morbus. \n"}, {"text": "Methemoglobinemia is a blood disorder that can cause the sufferer to appear to be blue.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Blue Fugates are probably the most notable sufferers of this blood disorder. The disorder can be mild, causing shortness of breath, headache and dizziness. It can also be severe, causing seizures, coma, and death. The Fugates lived in an rural area with a high incidence of intermarriage. They passed this disorder in this manner.Not all methemoglobinemia is genetic. It can be a reaction to certain medications. The disorder is characterized by high levels of methemoglobin which is an oxidized form of hemoglobin. At the time the Blue Fugates became well known, the disease was not understood at all.Today it is treated with methylene blue and supplemental oxygen. These treatments can keep the cyanosis, which makes the sufferer look blue, at a minimum and will usually restore normal color within a month. Ongoing treatment is a must. \n"}]}
