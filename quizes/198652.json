{"id": "198652", "name": "The Red Shoes Quiz | R | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "R", "Ra - Rh Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "The directing duties for 'The Red Shoes' were split between two gentlemen who formed a partnership during the 1940s and 50s.  One of them was Emeric Pressburger, who was the other?", "correct": "Michael Powell", "options": ["Charles Vidor", "Busby Berkeley", "Vincente Minnelli"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Powell.\n\n\tTogether they were called 'The Archers' and their collaboration lasted nearly two decades.  Powell and Pressburger were responsible for co-directing a number of good films, including 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' (1943) and 'Black Narcisuss' (1947). \n"}, {"text": "The story of this film revolves around the lives of three key characters, one an aspiring composer of music, one an ambitious dancer and the last a rigidly controlling director of a ballet company.  What is the name of this ballet impresario?", "correct": "Boris Lermontov", "options": ["Dmitri Poganskaya", "Sergei Ivanovich", "Josef Andropov"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoris Lermontov.\n\n\tFor Boris Lermontov, ballet is a religion.  One must be entirely devoted to this religion or not at all.\r The Lermontov character is played by German actor Anton Walbrook and is based roughly on the real-life head of the Ballet Russes, Serge Diaghilev. \n"}, {"text": "Now to the composer, played by Marius Goring.  What is this character's name?", "correct": "Julian Craster", "options": ["Tommy Linden", "Austen Trevor", "Robert Dorning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJulian Craster.\n\n\tJulian Craster is introduced at the beginning of the film.  He is a strong-willed, young musician who impresses Lermontov with his great talent for composition.  \r Goring was a stage actor who appeared in a great many films and television series; for example 'The Barefoot Contessa' and 'The Scarlet Pimpernel'. \n"}, {"text": "Finally, we have the dancer, Victoria Page.  Which real-life ballerina played the part of Miss Paige in 'The Red Shoes'? ", "correct": "Moira Shearer", "options": ["Sylvie Guillem", "Anna Pavlova", "Margot Fonteyn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoira Shearer.\n\n\tIn addition to 'The Red Shoes', Moira Shearer also appeared in 'The Tales of Hoffman', also directed by Powell and Pressburger, 'The Story of Three Loves' and 'Peeping Tom' (directed by Powell alone).  In total, she only appeared in six feature films, but what a splash she made in 'The Red Shoes'! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the ballet being presented at the beginning of the film, and attended by each of the main characters? ", "correct": "Hearts of Fire", "options": ["The Silver Skates", "Lady be Good", "Neptune's Daughter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHearts of Fire.\n\n\tThe score for 'Hearts of Fire' has been composed by Julian Craster's music instructor, Professor Palmer, but Craster recognizes that the melodies in this score have been lifted from his own compositions.  This leads him to seek out Lermontov, who he wishes to impress with his musical talents.  Craster convinces Lermontov that indeed he was the composer of the work, and that this is only the tip of his creative iceberg. \n"}, {"text": "The ballet after which the film is named, 'The Red Shoes', features Miss Paige as the prima ballerina, and is based on a fairy tale by which of the following?", "correct": "Hans Christian Andersen", "options": ["John Newbery", "Brothers Grimm", "Charles Perrault"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHans Christian Andersen.\n\n\tThe Andersen tale, as summarized by the Lermontov character, revolves around a pair of red shoes that are irresistable to a young girl.  Once she places them on her feet, she is compelled to dance unceasingly until her eventual death.  \r The actual fairy tale is quite different.  Rather than dancing herself to death, the young girl has her feet cut off and receives wooden ones in their place! \n"}, {"text": "Aside from 'The Red Shoes', what other ballet does Miss Page dance in during the film?", "correct": "Swan Lake", "options": ["Giselle", "The Nutcracker", "Romeo and Juliet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwan Lake.\n\n\tVictoria Page appears as the prima ballerina in a local presentation of 'Le Lac des Cygnes' ('Swan Lake') prior to winning a spot in 'The Red Shoes'.  Lermontov attends so that he may witness her performance, and he recognizes her brilliance. \n"}, {"text": "There are two male lead dancers in 'The Red Shoes' ballet, as portrayed in the film.  What is the name of the dancer who portrays the Shoemaker in the ballet, and works as the lead instructor for the ballet company?", "correct": "Grischa", "options": ["Spalanzani", "Antonio", "Schlemil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrischa.\n\n\tGrischa Ljubov is played by L\u00e9onide Massine, the world famous dancer and choreographer who actually got his start with Diaghilev and the Ballet Russes.  Massine choreographed his own dances (The Shoemaker) in the film, but the other choreography was handled by Robert Helpmann (who played Ivan Boleslawsky in the film). \n"}, {"text": "In what city does the ballet 'The Red Shoes' debut in the film?", "correct": "Paris", "options": ["London", "Vienna", "New York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParis.\n\n\tLermontov's ballet company is headquartered in Paris, so it only makes sense that the ballet would see its debut there as well.  Paris was also the headquarters of the Ballet Russes, mentioned above.  Incidentally, Paris would be the only place where Miss Page would perform 'The Red Shoes', as Lermontov forces her to leave his company after discovering that she is in love with Craster. \n"}, {"text": "The film and the ballet both end in tragedy, with the young ballerina (and Miss Page) dying while wearing the red ballet slippers.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe ending of 'The Red Shoes' is quite tragic, with Victoria Page killing herself by leaping before an oncoming train.  In both the ballet and the film, Miss Page dies while wearing her red slippers, another example of life imitating art.\r I hope you have enjoyed this quiz and will try more of my quizzes in the future. \n"}]}
