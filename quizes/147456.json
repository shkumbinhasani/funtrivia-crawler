{"id": "147456", "name": "The Most Important 'N' People Online Trivia | Mixed People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", " Mixed People", " People by Surname"], "questions": [{"text": "Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who lived from 1469 to 1539, was the founder of what minor world religion?  ", "correct": "Sikhism", "options": ["Baha'i", "Jainism", "Manicheism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSikhism.\n\n\tLocated mostly in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan, the Sikhs are a very significant minority group of India.  Sikhism is an offshoot of Hinduism, with influences from Islam and Buddhism as well.  Nanak was the first of ten gurus of the Sikhs, and he laid down many of the major tenets of the religion very early on. \n"}, {"text": "Born on Christmas Day, 1642 in England, Isaac Newton is possibly the most significant scientific personality in human history.   What is the abbreviated, Latin name of his greatest work, 'Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'?  ", "correct": "Principia", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincipia.\n\n\tNewton's 'Principia' laid down the fundamental laws of gravitation and motion, which he had formulated by 'standing on the shoulders' of Kepler and Galileo.  Newton is also considered to be the founder of the modern science of optics, co-discovered calculus and made contributions in several other fields as well.  In fact, the only significant thing he didn't do was to invent sliced bread! \n"}, {"text": "Two years after involvement in the coup that ousted King Farouk in Egypt in 1952 this man became Prime Minister of that key Arab country.  What is the name of this leading Arab nationalist of the mid-20th century?  ", "correct": "Nasser", "options": ["Naguib", "Natal", "Navara"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNasser.\n\n\tThe inclusion of Gamal Abdel Nasser in this quiz may come as a surprise to some, but his contributions to developments in the modern Middle East cannot be denied.  Two years after becoming prime minister in 1954, he became the president of Egypt, and later of the United Arab Republic (that also included Syria).  Nasser was responsible for ending the British presence in Egypt in the late 1950s, and nationalized the Suez Canal.  He advocated pan-Arab nationalism, and promoted a socialist agenda at home.  Nasser's failed policies were very significant, including his building of the massive Aswan Dam (ecological disaster) and his failed war with Israel in 1967. \n"}, {"text": "The Nobel Prize, which has been awarded for over a century to contributors in six major categories, is named after the Swedish inventor of dynamite.  What was Nobel's given name?    ", "correct": "Alfred", "options": ["Olaf", "Hans", "Stephen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlfred.\n\n\tDespite the destructive nature of his most significant invention, dynamite, Nobel was a pacifistic individual who hoped that his inventions would be used for non-violent purposes.   After discovering that this would not be the case, Nobel decided to institute the prizes that carry his namesake.  They are given yearly in six fields: Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Peace, Literature and Economics (added in 1969).  I believe the positive nature of his prizes has far outweighed the negative effects of his inventions (which also include gelignite and ballistite). \n"}, {"text": "German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was one of the most significant thinkers of the 19th century.   Which of the following was not a work produced by Mr. Nietzsche?  ", "correct": "Civilization and its Discontents", "options": ["Thus Spake Zarathustra", "Beyond Good and Evil", "The Gay Science"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCivilization and its Discontents.\n\n\tNietzsche is one of the most controversial, quoted and misinterpreted individuals of the philosophical past.  His ideas included his 'will to power', a rejection of 'slave morality', his '\u00dcbermensch', or superhuman being, and his rejection of Christianity (he was famously quoted as saying 'God is Dead').    His ideas were widely popular in the 20th century in Germany, and were grossly misapplied by the Nazis, who particularly exploited his idea of the 'superman'.  He remains extremely influential in all of the social sciences and in the humanities up to this very day. \n"}, {"text": "He was the first king of the reconstituted Babylonian empire (also called the Chaldean Empire) ruling from 625 to 605 B.C.  What was the name of this king whose efforts put an end to the great Assyrian Empire?

After consolidating his power, and reestablishing Babylon as the key city of the region, he attacked Egypt, battling for control of Syria, the Levant and Judaea.  He was able to wrest control of the former two regions before his death in 605 B.C.  His son,  Nebuchadnezzar II, completed the work, defeating the Egyptians and taking control of Judaea. \n"}, {"text": "Well before James Watt created his steam engine, this English inventor developed a practical steam-powered pumping device.  What was the surname of this very significant innovator?  ", "correct": "Newcomen", "options": ["Nurnst", "Nelson", "Nordhoff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNewcomen.\n\n\tThomas Newcomen's steam-powered water pump, used to remove water from mines, was the first commercially viable steam-powered device.  This device was created in 1712, some 50 years before James Watt came along with an improved version.  (Note: The very first steam powered device was created by Hero of Alexandria in the 1st century A.D., but it did not receive attention from the scientific community.  The steam era would have to wait another 1700 years!) \n"}, {"text": "For which of these advances was Scottish mathematician and inventor John Napier not known?  ", "correct": "Creation of the addition and subtraction signs  (+ and -)", "options": ["Development of the modern decimal point system", "Creation of a calculating machine called 'Napier's Bones'", "Invention of logarithms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreation of the addition and subtraction signs  (+ and -).\n\n\tJohn Napier is one of the most significant figures in the history of mathematics.  His invention of logarithms alone would probably be sufficient to consider him for this quiz, but he is also regarded as the first westerner to employ the decimal point, and also created one of the world's first mechanical calculating devices, called 'Napier's Bones'.  Napier also made some contributions to physics and astronomy as well. \n"}, {"text": "Jawaharlal Nehru was a key figure in the early history of independent India.

", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tRather, Nehru was the first prime minister of India, and remained in that position until his death in 1964.  Nehru was a significant figure in the independence movement of India, becoming president of the Indian National Congress in 1929.  He spent a number of years in jail, usually as a result of participating in the non-violent protest movement instigated by Gandhi.  Nehru became prime minister in 1947 after India became a free country and helped guide the nascent democracy during its formative years.  Nehru also played a significant international role during his time in office, acting as one of the leaders of the 'third world' (a term which he coined).  His daughter and grandson, Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, both spent time as prime minister of India,  creating something of a Nehruvian 'dynasty'. \n"}, {"text": "Living from 1559 to 1626 A.D., this man was the founder of the Manchu state, which would eventually come to dominate all of China as the Qing Dynasty.

Under his very organized 'banner system', he came to dominate the region, and set the stage for his son Abahai, who established the Qing Dynasty.  The Manchus ruled China for nearly 300 years (1644-1911).  My apologies to fans of Admiral Nelson, Nernst, Nero, Nicholas I and II of Russia, Nicolas of Cusa, Nefertiti and whomever else I excluded from this quiz.  I hope you enjoyed it regardless and will try my other alphabetical people quizzes.  Thank you for playing. \n"}]}
