{"id": "146821", "name": "Hardest 'S'uperb Art Terms Trivia Quiz | Art | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Art Terms"], "questions": [{"text": "This art term, describing an outlined image of a solid figure and having the appearance of a 'shadow', was named for a finance minister in the government of French King Louis XV.  What is the name of this shadowy art form?  ", "correct": "Silhouette", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilhouette.\n\n\tForgive me for forcing you to spell such an unreasonable word, but I couldn't imagine any other way to present this question!  The term silhouette comes from the name of one Etienne de Silhouette (1706-67), an individual known more for his reputation as a tightwad than for his aesthetic talents.  The practice of creating silhouettes involves cutting out black paper figures resembling people and/or scenes, and placing said cutouts on a white background.  Photography essentially killed off the silhouette, but it's still a wonderful hobby for children. \n"}, {"text": "Mantegna was a specialist in this illusionistic style, which involves paintings on ceilings that are so foreshortened as to appear suspended in space, floating above the onlooker's head.  Name the technique.  ", "correct": "Sotto in s\u00f9", "options": ["Sopra porte", "Sprezzatura", "Spinario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSotto in s\u00f9.\n\n\tSotto in s\u00f9 (Italian: from below upwards) is often associated with the Baroque movement, but it was established as a technique well before this.  The first known example of this technique is in Mantua, Mantegna's 'Camera degli Sposi' in the Palazzo Ducale.   Michelangelo also used this technique in some of his paintings on the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the art exhibition held in 1863 in Paris upon the orders of Napoleon III wherein Manet's 'D\u00e9jeuner Sur l'Herbe' was first exhibited to the public?  \n", "correct": "Salon des Refus\u00e9s", "options": ["Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants", "Salon d'Automne", "Salon de la Rose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalon des Refus\u00e9s.\n\n\tIn a year when a number of fine artists were denied the right to exhibit at the official Salon, the Emperor Napoleon III ordered that an alternate exhibition be held, the Salon des Refus\u00e9s.  Aside from Manet's masterpiece, a number of other avant-garde artists were allowed to exhibit there, including Pissarro, Whistler, C\u00e9zanne, Boudin and Fantin-Latour.  Its enormous success, despite criticisms from the conservative art public, led to other independent exhibitions, and helped launch the Impressionist movement in France. \n"}, {"text": "Louise Moillon, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin , and Paul C\u00e9zanne were all considered the greatest painters of what genre in France in their respective centuries?   \n", "correct": "Still life", "options": ["Serial painting", "Social realism", "Symbolist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStill life.\n\n\tWhen one thinks of the paintings of any of these three artists, the term 'still life' must come to mind immediately.  Of course, it could be debated that they were the greatest French still life painters of their centuries (Moillon - 17th, Chardin - 18th, C\u00e9zanne - 19th), but that is what art history is about...debate and critique! \n"}, {"text": "Leonardo da Vinci specialized in this technique, which entails blending of tones in colors in such a way that sharply defined boundaries are imperceptible in  a painting.  What is this technique called?  ", "correct": "Sfumato", "options": ["Sfregazzi", "Sforza", "Sgrafitto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSfumato.\n\n\tThe term sfumato is from the Italian, and derives from the terms for smoke (fumo), and can also bear the meaning 'evaporated' or 'shaded off'.  Leonardo described the technique as without lines or borders, in the manner of smoke.'  And he would know, he still remains the master at the technique...see his 'Madonna on the Rocks' for a full and wonderful example. \n"}, {"text": "The term 'Sezession' applies to a group of painters in Germany and Austria who, rebelling against the stultifying atmospheres of the official academies, adopted their own avant-garde exhibitions.  Who was the first president of the Vienna Sezession?  ", "correct": "Gustav Klimt", "options": ["Max Pechstein", "Egon Schiele", "Max Liebermann"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGustav Klimt.\n\n\tThe Sezessionists included Klimt in Vienna, Frank von Stuck and Wilhelm Tr\u00fcbner in Munich and Max Liebermann in Berlin.  Of course, the Sezessionists themselves became entrenched and conservative after a number of years, and this led to the founding of yet more avant-guard groups, for example Die Br\u00fccke. \n"}, {"text": "A creamy dilution of clay, water and possibly pigments, it is used to decorate earthenware.  What is being described here?  ", "correct": "Slip", "options": ["Stucco", "Stoa", "Serdab"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlip.\n\n\tThe term slip is of somewhat obscure origin, it possibly is derived from a Scandinavian word 'slipa', meaning 'slime'.  The best examples of the use of slip that I have seen are in Japanese and Korean pottery.  I exhort you to check out your nearest Asian art museum to have a look! \n"}, {"text": "'Stabile' is the charming term used by French Dada artist Jean Arp in 1932 to describe the sculptures of which of his admired colleagues?  ", "correct": "Alexander Calder", "options": ["Joan Miro", "Marcel Duchamp", "Frances Picabia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlexander Calder.\n\n\tThe year prior, fellow French Dada artist Marcel Duchamp had coined the term 'Mobile' to describe Calder's signature hanging, kinetic art pieces.  The next year, Jean Arp cleverly adapted the term 'Stabile' to describe Calder's non-ambulatory sculptures.  Can one not but love the wonderful imaginations of these colorful Dadaists? \n"}, {"text": "In an ancient Greek or Roman temple, the columns were built upon a masonry platform called...?  ", "correct": "Stylobate", "options": ["Stave", "Spandrel", "Scumble"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStylobate.\n\n\tThe Stylobate (a word from the Greek meaning 'pillar base') is but the top level of the stereobate (from the Greek meaning 'solid base'), the structure which forms the foundation for an ancient greek temple.  Typically, the stereobate (including the stylobate) is a three-tiered structure. \n"}, {"text": "I will be gentle with the final question and ask a rather easy question!  With which 20th century art movement were Salvador Dali, Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Andr\u00e9 Breton associated?  ", "correct": "Surrealism", "options": ["Suprematist", "Superrealism", "Situationalism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSurrealism.\n\n\tOf course, Dali, Magritte and Breton were not the only Surrealists, their ranks also included such master-artists and poets as Ernst, Masson, Delvaux and several other wunderkinds of the art world.  I would like to revive Surrealism through quizmaking, a sort of neo-Surrealist quiz movement...anybody with me?  No?
