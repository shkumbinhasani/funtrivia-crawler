{"id": "323492", "name": "Hard Learn to Fly Quiz / Test | Wild Mammals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "   Wild Mammals", "Bats"], "questions": [{"text": "It is imperative that bats learn to fly quickly, because some bats, you see, live very high up.  Some live in caves, such as the big-eared bat, so they can be several hundred feet from the ground.  Which of these is a major cause of cave-dwelling baby bat deaths?", "correct": "Falling to the ground", "options": ["Getting eaten by glowworms", "Getting eaten by larger male bats", "Baby bat deaths are rare"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalling to the ground.\n\n\tMost baby bats die because they fall from their very high cave roost down to the ground.  If the drop does not kill them, the flesh eating insects that live in the bat guano will.  Therefore, a bat must learn to fly as quickly as possible. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these bats is most likely to learn to fly at the youngest age?", "correct": "Kitti's hog-nosed bat", "options": ["Fruit bat", "Vampire bat", "Giant golden-crowned flying-fox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKitti's hog-nosed bat.\n\n\tGenerally, the smaller the bat, the sooner it will learn to fly.  The Kitti's hog-nosed bat is also known as the bumblebee bat, and has the distinction of being the smallest bat in the world.  It is about one and a half inches in length and weighs only seven hundredths ounces.  The giant golden-crowned flying-fox is the largest, with a wingspan of nearly five feet, and can weigh up to three pounds!  The bumblebee bat is considered a microbat, whereas the giant golden-crowned flying-fox is a megabat. Typically, microbats learn to fly in about six to eight weeks, but the megabats take up to four months to mature into adulthood and be able to fly!  It is also interesting to note that microbats use echolocation, while megabats do not (with a few exceptions).  Also, most megabats eat fruit, pollen, or nectar, while most microbats eat insects, with the exception of the vampire bat, which eats blood. Bats are generally harmless, so don't be afraid if you see one flying above your head! \n"}, {"text": "Most bats have to wait until they are nearly fully grown to be able to fly.  Who takes care of the bat until this time?", "correct": "Mother", "options": ["Entire Colony", "Father", "Mother and Father"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMother.\n\n\tOnly the mother bat takes care of her young.  Usually, a bat will give birth to only one pup at a time.  After mating, the father leaves, and the mother is left to bring up the pup until it is almost an adult.  The pup is not ready to fly until nearly fully grown, so it must rely on its mother until that time comes. \n"}, {"text": "A main reason a baby bat does not fly until later on in life is the fact that their patagium is not fully developed.  What is the patagium?", "correct": "Skin on the wing", "options": ["Bones in the wing", "Thumbs on the tips of the wings", "Echolocation sensory organ"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkin on the wing.\n\n\tThe patagium is the sensitive membrane covering the bat's wings.  It is the skin that creates the wings, and it can tear easily.  A baby bat's patagium is not very well developed early in life, but as it ages, the patagium grows and strengthens.  Eventually, the wings will have developed enough that the bat may actually fly. \n"}, {"text": "The gestation period of a bat is anywhere from forty days to six months, depending on the size of the bat.  In what time period do most bats, such as the fruit bat, usually give birth?", "correct": "Spring", "options": ["Summer", "Autumn", "Winter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpring.\n\n\tMating is very unusual between bats.  Sometimes a male bat will mate with up to 30 females while they are hibernating in the winter months.  The female bat, then, holds the sperm until a better time, usually around springtime, and then fertilizes the egg.  The baby will then develop, and the mother will give birth at the best time possible; spring, when the fruit, insects, pollen, etc, is the most abundant. \n"}, {"text": "Bats usually only give birth to one pup at a time, and will occasionally give birth to twins.  Is it at all possible for a bat to give birth to more than two bats at one time?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tMost bat species give birth to only one pup a year.  Twins are usually very rare, except in the very few species that give birth to twins regularly.  Some species give birth to one or two pups twice a year.  However, the most a mother bat can have in her \"little litter\" is four.  A bat cannot have more than four.  Having four pups is incredibly rare, and, just like a human having octuplets, it is unlikely that all four pups will survive birth.  Baby bats will be born premature, and they will be very small. \n"}, {"text": "A microbat, like the hollow-nosed bat, for instance, will give birth to a pup that is about 25% of her body size.  Why are the babies so large?", "correct": "Pups will be weaned faster", "options": ["Pups will be teens and they won't have to worry about \"diaper days\"", "Pups will be able to hold onto the cave ceiling easier", "Pups will already be able to fly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPups will be weaned faster.\n\n\tMegabats generally have pups 12% of their body size, and microbats give birth to pups about a quarter (25%) of their body size.  That would be like an average woman giving birth to a 35 pound child!  The reason for giving birth to such large pups serves a great purpose; weaning times are far less.  A bat needs to grow up and eat solid food quickly, and as soon as the bat can fly, it is time to move on to solids.  The bigger the pup starts out, the less time it will take for it to actually be able to fly. \n"}, {"text": "Most microbats, like mouse-tailed bats, live in caves.  When the parents go off to feed, what happens to the baby bats?", "correct": "They huddle up together in the roost", "options": ["They ride on the underbelly of their parents", "They are eaten by the parents", "The parents don't go off to feed; it's too risky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey huddle up together in the roost.\n\n\tWhen the mother bat needs to feed at nighttime, after her pup has been weaned, she drops him off in a creche, which is sort of like baby bat daycare, but with no guardians.  When the mother returns, she goes to the creche, remembering the general location where she left her pup, and, from that point, she can smell her own baby and listen for its unique squeak.  Like giraffes' spots, every squeak is different.\r The baby bat can also hold on to its mother's stomach if they need to switch roosts.  But it hardly ever rides with her while feeding. \n"}, {"text": "When the female bats give birth to their young, are they mostly male, or mostly female?", "correct": "They are equal", "options": ["Neither; they give birth to bats without sex organs", "Mostly males", "Mostly females"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are equal.\n\n\tBats generally give birth to an equal amount of males as they do females.  So, in a harem of 100 female bats, if they all gave birth, you could expect around fifty males and fifty females. \n"}, {"text": "When the bat is finally ready to fly, it will drop from its roost, whether it be a cave or a tree, and flap its wings.  Well, sort of.  Bats, unlike birds, do not flap their wings.  Instead, they:", "correct": "Spread their fingers apart and flap just their fingers", "options": ["Fly just like birds do", "Flap their entire forearms", "Only glide, like the flying squirrel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpread their fingers apart and flap just their fingers.\n\n\tBirds fly by flapping their entire forearm.  Bats, however, spread out their long, skinny fingers and, instead of flapping their entire arm, they use only their digits.\r An interesting fact about bats: there are 1,100 species worldwide.  Though they are the only mammals that fly, they makes up about 1/5 of all mammal species on earth! \n"}]}
