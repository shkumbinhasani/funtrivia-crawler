{"id": "342226", "name": "\"The Purple Piano Project\" Trivia Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these characters states that they're a junior at McKinley?", "correct": "Tina", "options": ["Mike", "Kurt", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTina.\n\n\tJacob Ben Israel's video-blog entry marks the start of the year once again-- this year's big topic: senior year.  He discovers that Finn, surprisingly, is without direction heading into his last year at McKinley and he's unsure of what to do with his life.  Mike Chang's parents haven't decided which school he's going to while Tina and Artie are both settled in as juniors. Rachel and Kurt are both excited to apply for Julliard and have an ideal life in New York City with Rachel on Broadway and Kurt legally married by 30.  Mercedes broke up with Sam over the summer when he left the state with his family. Mercedes now has a new football-player boyfriend while Santana wishes to be the head of the Cheerios for her final year (and Brittany exposes her time machine plans).  No one can find Quinn. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these people quit New Directions to ensure that they remain cool?", "correct": "Lauren", "options": ["Sam", "Puck", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLauren.\n\n\tAfter New York, Will returned and Emma moved in with him; the two of them awaken on the first day of school, make each others' lunches, and prepare for a good day.  Emma still seems a bit obsessive, but one thing at a time, right?\rIn the choir room, the New Directions find their trophies in the middle of the room and Will says that this year they need to think big and win it all.  He regrets his Broadway pipe dreams from last year while everyone continues to talk about Rachel and Finn's 'kiss that missed'.  Everyone in the school still hates New Directions.\rThis year, the group is down three members.  Sam left the state with his family, Lauren left glee club and Puck in order to up her cool factor, and no one knows where Quinn is.  Everyone is concerned that no one will join. \n"}, {"text": "How many purple pianos does Will present to the kids in New Directions?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Two", "Four", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tIn order to provide inspiration and to get new kids to join New Directions, Will has received three purple pianos from Motta's Pianos in town for free (since they were from foreclosed homes) and he plans on placing them throughout the school.  Every time a member of the glee club sees one, they need to perform a song at it in order to encourage people to join in and become members.\rIn Emma's office, Kurt and Rachel state their plans to go to Julliard together (although Emma initially thinks they're dating and gives them a pamphlet titled 'Me and My Hag').  Emma bursts their bubble by saying that Julliard doesn't have a musical theater program.  Instead, they can try a closer college or, if they really want to try the big leagues, the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts, who happens to be holding a local mixer for prospective students this coming week. \n"}, {"text": "When Sue says that she needs a position against something for the coming election, Becky suggests which of these oppositions?", "correct": "Toast", "options": ["The arts", "Shoes", "Glee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToast.\n\n\tSue is frustrated; the latest poll numbers are in for prospective congressional runnings and she's in ninth place (with 6%) behind a man running from prison and 'Undecided'.  She decides that she needs to be against something to ensure that people will be behind her.  Becky suggests toast since bread is already baked, so why cook it again.  Sue says that she needs something bigger.\rThat's when she hears it-- a purple piano.  While Tina plays in the hall and Mike dances, Sue comes up with wire cutters and destroys the piano, apologizing because she may have ruined the national anthem of whatever country they came from, but not sorry for putting an end to their horrible music.  They head off but a teacher thanks Sue and states that she'll be getting her vote for the coming election. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not one of 'The Skanks', Quinn's new group of friends?", "correct": "Becky", "options": ["Ronnie", "Sheila", "Mac"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecky.\n\n\tKurt and Blaine talk over coffee about the next year and Kurt tries to persuade his boyfriend to transfer to McKinley, if not to spend time, then to avoid being competition for this year's Glee circuit.  That and Kurt says that he'll just beat him on stage.\rAt McKinley, Quinn makes her surprising return sporting pink hair, a nose ring, and an ironic tattoo of Ryan Seacrest.  Brittany and Santana are disappointed that the three of them are no longer the 'unholy trinity' and Brittany likens Quinn to a Jolly Rancher dropped into an ashtray before Quinn decides that they just grew apart.  Instead she decides to head off with her new friends, 'The Skanks'.  Rachel steps in on their meeting and says that everyone misses Quinn and that they'd be thrilled to see her back whenever she's ready. \n"}, {"text": "Who is made a co-captain of the Cheerios?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Brittany", "Mercedes", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\tSue takes her congressional plans to her latest 'Sue's Corner' segment and states her pledge, if elected, to cut all fund in to the arts and entertainment in schools in the district until schoolkids can read at or above their proper grade level.  Principal Figgins, Will, and Emma all see this on TV and Will heads straight to the principal's office the next morning to discuss it but it's no use; Sue's gaining in the polls (she's tied with the prison inmate) and she plans on doing all she can to stop the arts.\rSue asks Santana and Becky to brace themselves and informs them both (to their surprise) that they will be co-captains of the Cheerios this year.  The plan: they have to get rid of the purple pianos.  Santana makes it clear that she's playing on Team Sue.\rIn the cafeteria, Rachel notes that none of them are following the assignment rules since there's a purple piano nearby.  They decide to give in and start singing The Go-Gos' \"We've Got the Beat\".  At the end of the song, no one is thrilled.  In fact, Becky starts a food fight and things go from bad to worse. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Al Motta's daughter?", "correct": "Sugar & Sugar Motta", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSugar & Sugar Motta.\n\n\tThe kids are discouraged by their attempt at recruiting more people in the cafeteria until a girl named Sugar Motta (daughter of the man who donated the pianos) comes in, claims she has self-diagnosed Aspergers Syndrome, and insults the group before auditioning for them with the song \"Big Spender\".  The song goes horribly and the group is shocked at how bad her voice actually is.  The kids tell Will that she can't join as it'll drag them all down and he said that he'd do anything to get them to win.\rWill speaks to Beiste about the dilemma since he doesn't feel like he could tell a kid they can't join.  But she was horrible.  In other news, Sue's up in the polls against 'anyone white'.\rRachel and Kurt find the purple piano in the auditorium and decide to prepare themselves for their NYADA mixer by performing \"Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead\". \n"}, {"text": "What happens to the final surviving purple piano?", "correct": "It's set on fire", "options": ["It's pushed off the school", "It's left out in the rain", "It's shot at with a gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's set on fire.\n\n\tSantana, Becky, and Sue all sit in on the Cheerios try-outs for this year before Will and Emma come in (Will with a bucket of glitter and Emma with a camera).  Will then proceeds to glitter-bomb Sue to get his message across about the importance of the arts.\rIn the halls, Blaine steps up to Kurt's locker wearing a bowtie and lacking his Dalton Academy uniform and he says that he's made the transfer.  Kurt fears that he only did it to give in to his pleading, but Blaine says that he made the switch to be with the guy he loves.  Kurt says he just needs to get in with New Directions but Blaine already has an idea.  He heads to the school's steps to sing Tom Jones' \"It's Not Unusual\" with the Cheerios dancing alongside him.  Without his knowing, the Cheerios douse the purple piano in gasoline before Quinn tosses her cigarette at it and sets it ablaze. \n"}, {"text": "When Rachel and Kurt go to the NYADA applicants mixer, what does Harmony say her claim to fame is?", "correct": "She was the Gerber baby", "options": ["She's already won three Tony Awards", "She was onstage when she was a fetus", "She was raised by divas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe was the Gerber baby.\n\n\tRachel and Kurt head to the NYADA mixer with great enthusiasm but when they arrive they find what seem to be doppelgangers of themselves.  A girl named Harmony introduces herself and states that they've all been attending these mixers since they were freshmen.  In fact, she was the Gerber baby and her ultrasound was featured on \"Murder, She Wrote\".  The theater kids sit them down and perform a stellar mash-up of \"Anything Goes\" and \"Anything You Can Do\" (ending with pyrotechnics) before Kurt and Rachel depart humiliated. In Rachel's car, Kurt and Rachel consider that maybe they don't have the know-how and talent they need to make it big. Rachel says that perhaps their future is community theater, but Kurt says the pity party is over.  They encourage each other and say they're going to make it regardless; they just need to work harder. \n"}, {"text": "Rachel announces the school musical for this year.  What will be performed?", "correct": "West Side Story", "options": ["Chicago", "Wicked", "Cats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWest Side Story.\n\n\tWill wakes up for another day of school and it's clear he doesn't want to go.  He needs to make a decision about Sugar; he decides not to let her in because she can't sing.  Sue supports his decision to cut Sugar from the Glee Club and glitter-bomb her because his hate towards her boosted her numbers in the polls.\rBlaine ends up stepping into the choir room for the first time and joins the group.  Finn tells him that they're not the Warblers and that they can't just set bonfires on pianos at school.  Santana says it was a political protest and Will tells her to leave.  Unless she can show her allegiance to New Directions (instead of Sue) they can't have her around; they all need to work together to win this year.  She decides a break might be in order anyways.\rRachel announces that this year she'll be heading a school musical production of \"West Side Story\" and that there will be open auditions.  Kurt also announces that he'll be running for senior class president.\rWith the three pianos destroyed, the New Directions are a bit disappointed, but it doesn't stop them from making music.  Rachel leads the group into \"You Can't Stop the Beat\" from \"Hairspray\" beginning as a ballad in the choir room and continuing to the auditorium.  Quinn watches on from the shadows while the kids sing and dance happily to their number one member up and three members down. \n"}]}
