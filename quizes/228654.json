What does this name mean?", "correct": "Gluttonous glutton", "options": ["Taken from the Gwich'in word for \"wolverine\"", "A double reference to the light patch on the wolverine's throat (gullet)", "An onomatopoetic reference to the sound a wolverine makes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGluttonous glutton.\n\n\tThe wolverine has been known throughout history for gluttony. All members of the weasel family have high metabolisms and thus large appetites. In addition, wolverines were reviled for what was seen as a type of gluttony- urinating on food stores that they appropriated from trappers and others, to mark the food as \"theirs.\" \n"}, {"text": "What does a wolverine look like?", "correct": "About the size of a beagle, with long, dense, brown fur. A tan stripe runs over the shoulders and along the flanks.", "options": ["About the size of a Labrador retriever, with long, dark-brown hair and white spots on the paws and the tip of the tail.", "About the size of a wolf, with light-brown dense hair tipped with a gold color like a grizzly.", "Long adamantium claws, slicked-back black hair, fierce scowl on the face...well, not really."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbout the size of a beagle, with long, dense, brown fur. A tan stripe runs over the shoulders and along the flanks.\n\n\tThe wolverine is smaller than most people think, with males averaging 35 pounds. Females are much smaller; on average only half the size of males. In addition to the distinguishing tan stripes, there may be a white spot on the chest. The wolverine also has a short, wide, powerful muzzle and a bushy tail. The human description is of the character Wolverine from \"The X-Men\" comics and movies. \n"}, {"text": "Medieval bestiaries accused the wolverine of having a psychological disorder most similar to which of these?", "correct": "Bulimia", "options": ["Obsessive-compulsive disorder", "Depression", "Paranoid schizophrenia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBulimia.\n\n\tIt was claimed that the wolverine would gorge itself until it could barely waddle, then squeeze itself between two trees that were so narrow that \"effluvium,\" for lack of a more genteel word, would squirt from the wolverine like toothpaste! Thus emptied, the wolverine would gorge itself again and repeat the cycle. Old bestiaries boast graphic engravings depicting the process. \n"}, {"text": "In which of the following places would you be most likely to find a wolverine?", "correct": "Lightly-forested areas just below treeline in Montana", "options": ["Heavily-forested lowlands in Nova Scotia", "Areas of farmland interspersed with forest in Sweden", "Bare ice fields in Alaska"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLightly-forested areas just below treeline in Montana.\n\n\tThe wolverine now inhabits boreal forest areas around the North Pole. In the US, populations are known to exist in Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The wolverine is also found in northern and western Canada and most of northern Eurasia. Throughout their range, wolverines are found almost exclusively in areas far from human habitation. Most of the year, they prefer lightly-forested areas in mountainous regions; they may use lower-elevation forest in winter. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is NOT another name for the wolverine?", "correct": "Honey badger", "options": ["Carcajou", "Devil bear", "Skunk bear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoney badger.\n\n\tOnly the cougar (Felis concolor) seems to have more common names than the wolverine!

What is it?", "correct": "Frost does not collect on it", "options": ["It is hollow", "It does not generate static electricity", "Its odor scares away rabbits and deer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrost does not collect on it.\n\n\tWolverine fur is used as trim on parkas and jackets due to its frost-resistant properties. This is a very unfortunate situation for wolverines, as many are trapped every year for this purpose. \n"}, {"text": "The wolverine's adaptations show that it has evolved to fit a particular niche. What is that niche?", "correct": "Scavenger", "options": ["Hunter of large mammals", "Hunter of fish", "Insectivore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScavenger.\n\n\tThere are many tall tales of wolverines bringing down full-grown moose, but in actuality, the wolverine derives much of its diet from scavenging  already-dead large ungulates.

A wolverine's jaws are so powerful that it can chew through chain-link fence! \n"}, {"text": "What is unusual about the home ranges of wolverines?", "correct": "They are enormous", "options": ["They are concentrated around rich sources of food", "They never cross rivers", "Many wolverines share one home range"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are enormous.\n\n\tAn adult male wolverine can have a home range of more than 920 square kilometers/355 square miles!

Wolverines are constantly on the move; mountain ranges, rivers, and other geographic features are no barrier to them. \n"}, {"text": "The wolverine is listed as an endangered species in the United States.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe wolverine is unprotected by the Endangered Species Act, despite its extreme scarcity and limited range.
