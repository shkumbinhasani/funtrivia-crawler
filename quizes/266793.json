He no longer felt suitable to wear his brown costume, as it was similar to Tara's. His teammates on the Outsiders gave him a new green and gold costume, which has become his regular uniform. Green and gold are not only the colors on Markovia's flag, the green represents the Earth, from which he derives his power, and gold reminds Markov that his gifts are truly special. \n"}, {"text": "Who framed Geo-Force for the murder of Iona?", "correct": "Roderick", "options": ["Wylde", "Technocrat", "Faust"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoderick.\n\n\tRoderick was an evil vampire who had his very own vampire army.
