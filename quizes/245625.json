{"id": "245625", "name": "Top Movies of 2002 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "2000s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Starring Adrien Brody in his Oscar-winning performance, 'The Pianist' was a very difficult film to watch, but one of exquisite beauty from both a visual and aural perspective.  What controversial director won an Academy Award for this marvelous film adaptation of Wladyslaw Szpilman's autobiography?", "correct": "Roman Polanski", "options": ["Terry Gilliam", "Oliver Stone", "Darren Aronofsky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoman Polanski.\n\n\tRoman Polanski, who fled the U.S. in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, was not at the Oscar ceremony to collect the award for Best Director, his first.  He also directed such classics as 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'Chinatown'.  \r The true motor that makes 'The Pianist' work is the subtle acting of Adrien Brody.  He became the youngest winner of a Best Actor Oscar for his excellent work. \n"}, {"text": "Another great film of 2002, 'Adaptation' is a psychological adventure into the mind of a very neurotic screenwriter.  What is the name of this screenwriter, who both wrote the story and is portrayed as the main character in the film?", "correct": "Charlie Kaufman", "options": ["Nick Castle", "Richard Linklater", "Judd Apatow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlie Kaufman.\n\n\tNicolas Cage, Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper star in 'Adaptation', a film directed by Spike Jonze.  Cooper won his first Academy Award, a Supporting Actor Oscar, for his portrayal of John Laroche, a character within the book 'The Orchid Thief' by Susan Orlean.  Like Kaufman's other collaboration with Jonze, 'Being John Malkovich', this story is a clever, often amusing psychodrama. \n"}, {"text": "'City of God', or 'Cidade de Deus', is, simply put, an amazing visual experience.  Directed by K\u00e1tia Lund and Fernando Meirelles, it stars a group of kids who, for the most part, had never acted prior to the film.  In what country does the action in this breathtaking film take place?", "correct": "Brazil", "options": ["Mexico", "Italy", "Colombia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrazil.\n\n\tMore specifically, the 'Cidade de Deus' is a nickname for a very poor quarter of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro.  There, children virtually raise themselves in a seemingly anarchic environment.  The performances of the child actors in this film are stunningly realistic, and the quality of the film-making, superb.  Please see it if you have not already! \n"}, {"text": "Directed by Martin Scorsese, and featuring the acting of Daniel Day-Lewis, Leo Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz, this film tells the story of the battles between Irish immigrants and native-born elements of the New York City population in the mid-19th century.  What is the name of this gritty and beautifully filmed drama?", "correct": "Gangs of New York", "options": ["Bringing Out the Dead", "New York, New York", "New York Stories"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGangs of New York.\n\n\tThough nominated for 10 Oscars, 'Gangs of New York' did not win a single award from the Academy.  This is a shame, because at the very least Daniel Day-Lewis should have received some recognition for his superb performance as nativist leader Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting.  Day-Lewis even fought through a broken nose to complete the filming! \n"}, {"text": "Running away from a cruel residential school in Western Australia, two young mixed-race Aboriginal girls walk 1,500 miles to reach their former home at Jigalong.  What is the name of this stunning movie from Australian director Phillip Noyce?", "correct": "Rabbit-Proof Fence", "options": ["The Bone Collector", "Catch a Fire", "Echoes of Paradise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRabbit-Proof Fence.\n\n\tPhillip Noyce, the director who brought 'The Quiet American', 'Patriot Games' and 'The Bone Collector' to the big screen, delivered perhaps his greatest triumph with 'Rabbit-Proof Fence' in 2002.  Along with Everlyn Sampi and Tianna Sansbury, who played the young girls, the movie also featured Kenneth Branagh as A.O. Neville, the man responsible for carrying out Aboriginal policy in the early 20th century. \n"}, {"text": "A truly incredible film with a wonderfully uplifting story, 'Whale Rider' is not just for kids.  Directed by Nick Caro and starring Oscar-nominated then 12-year old actress Keisha Castle-Hughes, in what country does the action of the film take place?", "correct": "New Zealand", "options": ["Sri Lanka", "The Philippines", "South Africa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Zealand.\n\n\tKeisha Castle-Hughes became the youngest actress ever to receive a Best Actress nomination for her role in 'Whale Rider', but she did not win the trophy.  Despite that, her performance as Paikea Apirana, a young girl who secretly aspires to become leader of her Maori tribe, despite sexual taboos, is charming and inspiring. \n"}, {"text": "Fascinating and disturbing, the 2002 Spanish-language film 'Talk to Her' is perhaps the greatest film to date from this Spanish film director who has become a national icon.  What is his name?", "correct": "Pedro Almod\u00f3var", "options": ["Nacho Cerd\u00e0", "Julio M\u00e9dem", "Bruno L\u00e1zaro Pacheco"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPedro Almod\u00f3var.\n\n\tPedro Almod\u00f3var has brought many entertaining and witty films to the big screen, including 'Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!', 'High Heels' and 'Bad Education', but my favorite has to be 'Talk to Her' (aka 'Hable con Ella').  This unusual story involves two men, both of whom are in love with women who are comatose patients.  You must see it to believe it. \n"}, {"text": "Not for the emotionally faint of heart, 'The Magdalene Sisters' is a pointed look at the lives of four Irish girls who were each raised in a strictly Roman Catholic manner.  In what particular setting does the story unfold?", "correct": "An asylum", "options": ["A rural area", "A Catholic school", "A fishing village"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn asylum.\n\n\tThe four girls, Margaret, Rose, Bernadette and Crispina, have each been admitted to Magdalene Asylum, a place for 'fallen' young women.  The film depicts the cruel treatment these young women are forced to endure, the friendships they are able to achieve and the means of their eventual departures from the asylum.  This is a stark but important film document! \n"}, {"text": "What do you get when you throw a bitter, broken man who claims to be Elvis Presley and a black man who claims to have been implanted with John F. Kennedy's brain together into an old folks home that is haunted by an ancient Egyptian mummy?  Great fun, that's what!  What entertaining and cheesy 2002 film is described here?", "correct": "Bubba Ho-tep", "options": ["The Killer Mummy", "Taking Care of Business", "King of the Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBubba Ho-tep.\n\n\tDon Coscarelli, creator of the 'Phantasm' movie series, directs this instant cult classic.  Bruce Campbell, a favorite of horror film aficionados, is absolutely perfect as the King (and/or Sebastian Haff), and Ossie Davis brings dignity and flair to his role as JFK.  Sounds too cheesy?  Well, it really is, but that's the fun and genius of the film.  Give it a try, I think you'll enjoy it! \n"}, {"text": "'About Schmidt' is the story of a man Warren Schmidt who, suddenly thrust into retirement, has no idea what to do with himself.  What actor is brilliant in his portrayal of Schmidt, a man who is neurotic, frequently disoriented, socially disoriented and sometimes very vulnerable?", "correct": "Jack Nicholson", "options": ["Al Pacino", "Dustin Hoffman", "Robert De Niro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Nicholson.\n\n\tJack Nicholson submits his usual A-level acting performance as Schmidt, a role for which he was Oscar nominated.  Hope Davis and Kathy Bates are both excellent in their supporting roles in this film that was directed by Alexander Payne (who also brought us 'Election' and 'Sideways').\r Thank you for trying this quiz.  Please let me know what your top choices are for the year 2002, I'm interested to know! \n"}]}
