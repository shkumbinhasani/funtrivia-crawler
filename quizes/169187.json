{"id": "169187", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Novocaine Mutiny' Quiz / Test | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "Hawkeye has finally pushed Frank Burns over the edge.  The many pranks, wisecracks and practical jokes Hawkeye has committed against Frank have finally plunged the Major over the abyss.  In a preliminary hearing, a military tribunal is now determining whether Frank has a case in charging Hawkeye with mutiny.  The tribunal puts Frank on the stand first, and he goes right to work impugning Hawkeye's character.  What 'caption' does Frank claim has written under his framed picture of Senator McCarthy?", "correct": "Know your enema", "options": ["Slug thy neighbor", "Do unto others, before they do unto you", "An accusation a day keeps the commies away"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKnow your enema.\n\n\tFrank goes on to insist that Hawkeye is a menace to the American way of life.  'Unless we each conform, unless we obey orders, unless we follow our leaders blindly, there is no possible way we can remain free,' Frank claims.  As I see it, Frank has an open and shut case! \n"}, {"text": "Pierce is allowed to testify next in this case.  Hawkeye denies having been involved in the 'alleged' mutiny while at the same time making his own case that Frank is a poor commander and an even less-skilled doctor.  Which of these is not an insult that flies during Hawkeye's testimony?", "correct": "This hearing should be to determine if Frank's scalpel should be officially labeled a deadly weapon", "options": ["It's Frank's medical skills that are 'alleged'", "Frank has enough mold on his brain to produce a quart of penicillin", "Frank has created more widows and pallbearers than salmonella"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThis hearing should be to determine if Frank's scalpel should be officially labeled a deadly weapon.\n\n\tThen Hawkeye goes even further under the belt (as Colonel Potter suggests), with this zinger, 'If the politicians of the world hadn't failed to keep the peace, he'd be back in Indiana right now with his cozy little malpractice and meeting his receptionist two afternoons a week at the Golden Goose Motel.'  'That's a lie!', claims Frank.  Hawkeye responds, 'Don't leave your unopened mail around.' \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter is next to occupy the witness chair.  Potter's involvement in the case is brief, as he was ordered back to the United States for a two-week conference, leaving Frank Burns in charge.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, Potter has decided to take six days of rest and relaxation in Tokyo, and hence has reluctantly left Frank in command of the unit.  This is, of course, a decision that he has come to regret now that he finds himself in a courtroom defending Hawkeye. \n"}, {"text": "BJ takes the stand after Potter is dismissed.  He describes some of the insanity that occurs at the 4077th once Frank takes command.  Which of these specific activities does BJ mention that Frank outlawed during his command?", "correct": "Gambling", "options": ["Commingling between the sexes", "Drinking", "Telling jokes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGambling.\n\n\tFrank also orders the camp to 'bug-out' to a position 'across the street' from its current position.  To make matters worse, he has outlawed gambling.  Drinking has likely also been outlawed, but that bit was already done during a season three episode! \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the M*A*S*H 4077th has lost $300 during a poker game, prompting Frank to carry out an formal investigation?", "correct": "Zale", "options": ["Radar", "Mulcahy", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZale.\n\n\tThe boys are able to get away with playing an illicit poker game, but during an inspection of the kitchen and meat freezer Zale opens his big trap and announces he has 'lost' $300.  He implicates Hawkeye, BJ, Klinger, Radar and Father Mulcahy as having potentially taken his money.  What he fails to mention is that he lost the money fair and square during the card game! \n"}, {"text": "Frank forces Radar to do a camp search with him in the hopes that the missing $300 might appear.  Which of these tents do we not see searched during this amusing ransacking of the 4077th?", "correct": "Colonel Potter's tent", "options": ["Klinger's tent", "The Swamp", "Father Mulcahy's tent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColonel Potter's tent.\n\n\tFirst, Frank and Radar search through Father Mulcahy's belongings.  Radar feels uncomfortable, suggesting that it's like searching a church.  Second, they appear in Klinger's tent.  Frank seems especially curious about the drawer full of undergarments...ahem!  Finally, we see Frank and Radar inspecting the Swamp under the close scrutiny of Hawkeye and BJ.  Frank makes the suggestion that officers don't steal...which is rather odd since he earlier had essentially accused his fellow doctors of taking the money. \n"}, {"text": "Frank leaves no stone unturned, even searching Radar's quarters while the young Corporal looks on.  There is an anachronistic error in this scene, as Frank unearths items that weren't produced until after the Korean War.  What sort of items are these?", "correct": "Comic books", "options": ["8-track tapes", "Pet rocks", "T.V. Guides"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComic books.\n\n\tFrank pulls several comic books out of Radar's drawer, including a copy of 'The Amazing Spiderman' and 'The Avengers'.  Both of these comic books did not have their first issue published until the 1960s.  This is not the first time such a temporal error is made vis-\u00e0-vis comic books during the 'M*A*S*H' series.  It's okay though; only nerds such as myself notice such grievous problems! \n"}, {"text": "It turns out that a certain member of the 4077th indeed had the 'missing' $300, having won it in the poker game.  In the courtroom we discover that which of these individuals was the big winner in the poker game?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Klinger", "B.J."], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tIf you watch the poker game, you see that Radar wins the only hand shown with a straight (over Zale's three queens).  Frank never finds the money, however, because Radar has hidden it in his teddy bear.  When Frank discovers this, he announces, 'I knew I should have ripped the stuffings out of the dirty little bugger when I had the opportunity.'  Colonel Carmichael, the officer in charge of the hearing responds, 'Wouldn't you have felt a little silly if the money hadn't been inside?'  Frank retorts, 'I wasn't talking about the bear!'  Poor little Radar! \n"}, {"text": "Frank is now requested to tell his version of the events that led to Hawkeye's supposed mutiny.  Needless to say, he embellishes rather lavishly on the truth with his recounting of events.  Which of these acts of heroism does Frank perform during the terrible O.R. session described in his tale?", "correct": "He draws blood directly from his arm into a patient", "options": ["He performs open heart surgery on two patients at once", "He reopens a patient Hawkeye has worked on, discovering an elusive shrapnel fragment", "He transplants a kidney directly from one patient to another, while saving both"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe draws blood directly from his arm into a patient.\n\n\tFrank's superhuman performance does not end there.  He also performs triage with no assistance, acts as anesthesiologist when the regular gas-passer has passed out, and performs the last rights (in Latin!) for a patient when Father Mulcahy is unable to go on.  Hawkeye is so jealous and resentful of Frank's otherworldly abilities that he sedates Frank, committing mutiny. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye sets the record straight with his own testimony, which is quite different from the version Frank presented.  Following this, the tribunal deliberates, and finds Hawkeye not-guilty.  When assessing Frank's abilities as a surgeon, the tribunal finds that, had Frank not been assigned medical duty, what other position would have been suitable for him?", "correct": "Pastry chef", "options": ["Latrine digger", "Dry cleaner", "Dish washer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPastry chef.\n\n\tColonel Carmichael was, of course, being generous with Frank by suggesting that he might work as a pastry chef.  The M*A*S*H-ites return to camp where the boys once again play a rousing game of poker.  Frank informs Colonel Potter of this illicit activity, and the old fella responds by joining the game!  Thanks for having played this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
