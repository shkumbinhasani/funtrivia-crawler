It was published in 1937. \r Each day after school, Marco's dad asks him to report on what he has seen on the way home. Hoping to invent \"a story that no one can beat,\" the boy begins with a \"broken-down horse and wagon\" clip-clopping down Mulberry Street, changes the horse into a zebra, morphs the driver into a Roman charioteer, substitutes for the zebra a reindeer, than an elephant, then an elephant plus two giraffes. Marco's imaginings proliferate faster and faster until he pictures an extravaganza of creatures, riders, musicians, marchers, and spectators (all showered in bushel baskets of confetti poured from a plane) the likes of which Mulberry Street has never seen--and is never likely to see. Unfortunately, Marco cannot quite bring himself to repeat such an over-the-top fib to his stern father. Instead he admits to seeing \"nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street.\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins\", what does King Derwin's nephew offer to do?", "correct": "push Bartholomew from a turret atop the castle", "options": ["buy one of Bartholomew's hats for 500 gold pieces", "chop off Bartholomew's head with a gigantic ax", "give Bartholomew a job in the castle as a page boy"], "explanation": "\n\n\npush Bartholomew from a turret atop the castle.\n\n\tThis book was published in 1938.\r Amid blaring trumpets, proud King Derwin and his royal entourage come galloping into town. All the townspeople bow low and doff their hats--all, that is, except poor little Bartholomew Cubbins. Of course, the boy respectfully removes his hat along with everyone else. But another hat appears upon his head--and another, and another, and another. Furious, King Derwin orders a mounted guard to scoop up Bartholomew and gallop the boy uphill to the palace (as hat after hat after hat flies from the prisoner's head). Various royal experts try in vain to get rid of the boy's bewitched headgear. When Bartholomew finally receives a death sentence, the friendly executioner explains that it's unlawful to behead people with their hats on. The King's nasty young nephew offers to push Bartholomew from the highest turret, and on the way upstairs, the hats--which Bartholomew keeps removing--grow fancier and fancier. King Derwin is so entranced by Hat Number 500, a plumed, bejeweled dazzler, that he pardons Bartholomew, spanks his nephew, and buys the hat for 500 gold pieces. Once the King lifts his purchase from Bartholomew's head, the boy is relieved to feel breezes ruffling his hair. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Horton Hatches the Egg\", what is the neglectful mother bird's name?", "correct": "Mayzie", "options": ["Elly May", "Mrs. Bird", "Daisy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMayzie.\n\n\tThis book was published in 1940.\r Mayzie bird was apparently absent the day they taught parenting.

Faithful Horton crouches manfully over his fragile little charge, enduring harsh weather, loneliness, and the cruel sneers of jungle wiseguys. When he and his egg are captured and sold to a circus, poor, steadfast Horton is laughed at by gawkers as he hunches over his nest atop his potted tree. Finally the circus comes to Palm Beach, where who should float by but lazy Mayzie, the perpetual vacationer. When the egg begins to hatch, Horton is thrilled, but Mayzie screeches that it's HERS! She gets her comeuppance when the hatchling emerges, a mini-Horton with wings!

The grump tells Sam--repeatedly--that he does not like the strange green fare, but insistent Sam follows his victim around, brightly proffering the dish (which he carries aloft, waiter-style). Perhaps Mr. Picky Eater would like this tasty treat if it were presented in a house with a mouse? No? How about in a box with a fox? Soon, Sam has scooped poor Black Hat onto the hood of his speeding car. Collecting various animals, they motor up a tree, onto a train, through a tunnel (\"Say!... Would you, could you, in the dark?\"), and onto a boat, which sinks, spilling everyone into the drink.

At least, very few.\" Among other disasters, he braves a hurricane-force Midwinter Jicker and a pack of hungry, grinning Perilous Poozers. He dives into a tunnel to escape the Poozers, but it's crammed with an endless line of marching birds who are apparently moving all their earthly possessions from one place to another. Finally our hero nears Solla Sollew! But the utopia turns out to have one major drawback: a Key-Slapping Slippard inhabits the keyhole to the town gate, preventing anyone from entering. Solla Sollew's gatekeeper asks him along to Boola Boo Ball, but our hero chooses to return home instead. This time, however, he carries a baseball bat to show his former tormentors who's boss. \n"}]}
