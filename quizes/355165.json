That span also included the group's four number one albums: \"Hello! in 1973, \"On the Level\" in 1975, \"Blue for You\" in 1976 and \"1+9+8+2\" in 1982. Remarkably, the 1977 album \"Rockin' All Over the World\" made it only to number five in the UK album chart. \n"}, {"text": "A handful of early Quo releases failed to make the UK singles chart, but they then had a string of consecutive releases that easily gave them the record for the most UK chart singles by any artist.

Indeed, the group has been remarkably stable for a band with more than forty years under their belts. There has been only one change in this line-up in the last twenty-five years -- Matt Letley replaced Jeff Rich on drums in 2000. Bass player Alan Lancaster (along with Rossi and drummer John Coghlan) was an original member of the 1962 \"Spectres\" and Parfitt joined in 1967. That foursome remained as the 'original line-up' until Pete Kircher replaced Coghlan in 1982.

The song was a revamped version of Quo's 1988 release, \"Burning Bridges\" with new lyrics to fit the football theme.\r\"Come on You Reds\" spent fifteen weeks in the chart and two weeks at number one. Although the England football team have released a handful of songs that have topped the UK chart over the years, this was the first song released by an individual club to do so. (Chelsea's 1972 hit \"Blue is the Colour\" made it only to number five.) \n"}]}
