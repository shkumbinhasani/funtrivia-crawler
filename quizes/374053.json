What is the name of the island?", "correct": "Samothrace", "options": ["Salamis", "Rhodes", "Crete"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSamothrace.\n\n\tThe island of Samothrace belongs to the Northern Greek prefecture of Thrace and is found at a distance of 24 nautical miles from its shores. The name of the island means \"Tall Thrace\" because of mountain Saos, the tallest mountain on an Aegean island outside Crete and Euboia. \r The Temple complex is situated at the southern side of the island, between the coast and Mount Saos. Excavations at the nearby settlement of Mikro Vouni (small mountain) revealed the social structure of a 2nd millennium BC settlement and a number of findings which supported some of the theories about the Mysteries of the Great Gods. The dating of the buildings and artifacts extend from the 7th century BC well into the 3rd century AD. \n"}, {"text": "To speak the names of the deities was taboo and they were usually refered to as Great Gods (Megaloi Theoi). In later antiquity, they were sometimes refered to  collectively as the deities from Asia Minor, possibly Phrygian. What was that name?", "correct": "Cabeiri", "options": ["Corybantes", "Cyclopes", "Bacchae"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCabeiri.\n\n\tThe Cabeiri were worshipped in Asia Minor and the nearby islands like Lemnos and, also, in Boeotia. They are often identified with the Great Gods of Samothrace but the historical evidence is not concrete. The Mysteries of the Great Gods was a cult which was based, in the Pre-Hellenic era, on a central female figure, a Great Mother, whose secret name was Axieros.Her spouse was Kadmylos, a fertility god. Chthonic deities Axiokersos and Axiokersa were associated with Hades and Persephone as deities more familiar to the Greeks. At an even later historical period, part of the initiation ceremony was to witness the marriage of Harmonia and Kadmos.Harmonia was a daughter of Zeus and Electra and Kadmos was the legendary first king of Thebes. \n"}, {"text": "The word \"mystery\" comes from \"mystes\" which comes from the verb \"myein-myo\", \"to initiate someone into a cult by revealing its inner meaning through rituals\".\nHowever, during the time of the Mysteries of the Great Gods the verb had a different meaning. What was it?", "correct": "To close the eyes and/or lips", "options": ["To dance", "To teach", "To hide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo close the eyes and/or lips.\n\n\tIt is well known that all mystery cults of antiquity, like the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Orphic Mysteries, etc, had strict rules against anyone revealing the secrets of the cult. \rIn the Mysteries of the Great Gods, the initiates (mystes) were blindfolded, were forbidden to speak and were guided along the way by established members of the cult (epoptai), as their sponsors. No one could become an initiate without a sponsor. Those who wished to become initiates in the cult, seeked protection during sea travels and an opportunity to become more pious people. Famous initiates included the historian Herodotus, the Spartan Lysander and several Roman emperors such as Hadrian. \n"}, {"text": "The findings at Mikro Vouni have led the archaeologists to establishing a succession of events taking place during the initiation ceremony which was called the Sacred Way. One of the events was for the initiate to wear a sash around the waist. What color was the sash?", "correct": "Purple", "options": ["Orange ", "Green", "Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPurple.\n\n\tThe purple sash which was tied in a knot around the initiate's waist was a talisman, intended to protect and signify the initiate's commitment to the cult. We know from these findings that the ritual ceremonies were most probably held in mid-summer, at night. The sanctuary was illuminated by torches and the initiates participated in a purification ceremony, confessed their sins, attended the narrative of mythological stories, wore the purple sash and witnessed the unveiling of the sacred symbols.After that, the initiate was given a document which proved his initiation and could have his name engraved on a plaque. \n"}, {"text": "An initial stop in the Sacred Way was to enter the Theatral Circle which had rows for standing spectators, alternating with pedestals for statues, around a central altar. Knowing that all that was found of the statues were eyelashes, can you guess the material they were made out of?", "correct": "Bronze", "options": ["Cedar wood", "Marble", "Limestone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBronze.\n\n\tThe statues were made out of bronze, based on the large number of bronze eyelashes that were found during the excavations. At the same site, offerings from faraway places were found, a gold lion with lapis lazuli of Persian origin and small Minoan seals with the double ax and the fish, a fact that supports the theory that the Mysteries of the Great Gods had a universal appeal at the time, especially among seafaring peoples.No written record of the use of the building exists but it is believed to have been a place of performing and witnessing, probably, theater, dance, narrations or sacrifices. \n"}, {"text": "The Hall of the Choral Dancers was built at the center of the temple complex, atop a pre-existing building of lesser importance.

It is the first building of the site to have been built entirely out of Thasian marble. Its most impressive feature is the continuous frieze of hundreds of dancing women and female musicians, a citharist, a tympanum player and a flute player. The procession of dancing women has been thought to represent the festivities at the wedding of Kadmos and Harmonia. \n"}, {"text": "The Rotunda of Arsinoe stands between the Hall of the Choral Dancers and the Anaktoron, at the end of the Sacred Way. It was built c. 288-270 BC as an offering by Queen Arsinoe II of which country?", "correct": "Egypt", "options": ["Syria", "Persia", "Caria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEgypt.\n\n\tThe Rotunda of Arsinoe was one of the buildings which were built during the prime of the Sanctuary, by the descendants of the Macedonian dynasty. It was a marble building on limestone foundations with an impressive conical roof, the largest, closed, round building of Greek architecture. Its role in the rituals is not clear, it might have been a place for sacrifices or secret, important gatherings. \rArsinoe II was a Ptolemaic Greek princess of Ancient Egypt whose first husband was Lysimachus, king of Thrace.

In the inside, rows of marble benches run along the walls, an indication that spectators attended a performance of some sort. Evidence also exists for some type of burning sacrifices and poured libations, because of the existence of an \"eschara\" and \"bothros\", namely, a sacred hearth and a pit. \n"}, {"text": "A 104 m stoa (colonnaded covered walkway) was found on the west side of the temple complex.
