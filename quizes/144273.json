{"id": "144273", "name": "Have you seen 'Repo Man'? Trivia Game | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Repo Man"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of the film we see a lovely 1964 Chevy Malibu being driven along a deserted desert road by a very unbalanced individual.  The Malibu is pulled over for speeding, during which time the police officer insists on looking into the trunk.  After opening the trunk, the officer is 'zapped', and all that remains are his boots!  Including the police officer, how many people are 'zapped' in this way during the film?", "correct": "2", "options": ["3", "4", "1"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tThe only other victim of the glowing trunk is a mohawk-wearing punk rock pal of Otto.  The special effects, if one may call them that, are rather primitive...a big light, the outline of a skeleton and a puff of steam.  Apparently, this was not a big-budget film... \n"}, {"text": "We are soon introduced to the main character, a young punk rocker named Otto who is drifting through life while working in menial jobs.  The actor who plays Otto also starred in which of these sets of three films?", "correct": "'The Outsiders', 'The Breakfast Club', 'Young Guns'", "options": ["'Risky Business', 'Top Gun', 'Legend'", "'Platoon', 'Major League', 'Hot Shots'", "'Stand by Me', 'The Lost Boys', 'Flatliners'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Outsiders', 'The Breakfast Club', 'Young Guns'.\n\n\tNope, it wasn't Kiefer Sutherland, Tom Cruise or Charlie Sheen, but rather Sheen's brother Emilio Estevez who took the role of Otto in this fun 1984 film.  It's interesting that Estevez went so quickly from punk to jock from 'Repo Man' to 'The Breakfast Club'.  What acting range! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these items appears in every car featured in the film 'Repo Man'?", "correct": "Christmas tree air freshener", "options": ["Nerf football", "Rosarie beads", "A copy of 'Car and Driver' magazine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristmas tree air freshener.\n\n\tIt seems that one of the only corporate sponsors of this film were the creators of those little Christmas tree-shaped air fresheners, and the producers wanted that company to get their money's worth.  Even the police motorcycle at the beginning of the film is furnished with one of the air fresheners. \n"}, {"text": "Lite, one of Otto's fellow repo men, gives Otto a book at one point.  The book's title is a play on which very similar book title by which of these authors?  (Author and book)", "correct": "'Dianetics' by L. Ron Hubbard", "options": ["'I, Robot' by Isaac Asimov", "'The Andromeda Strain' by Michael Crichton", "'The Call of Cthulhu' by HP Lovecraft"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Dianetics' by L. Ron Hubbard\n\n\tThe book Lite provides to Otto is called 'Diuretics', a play on the famous 'bible' of the Church of Scientology by L. Ron Hubbard called 'Dianetics'.  Eventually we see Otto toss the book into a fire...guess he doesn't read much. \n"}, {"text": "Otto visits his parents out in 'Edge City' during the film.  Upon entering the home he finds both his mother and father glued to the television, watching their favorite television preacher.  What is this reverend's name?", "correct": "Reverend Larry", "options": ["Reverend Barry", "Reverend Jerry", "Reverend Perry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReverend Larry.\n\n\tReverend Larry is commanding his 'flock' to send money.  One of the best lines of the film comes from Larry, who states unequivocally, 'I do want your money, because God wants your money.'  Finally an honest televangelist! \n"}, {"text": "Otto's mentor during the film is a repo man named Bud, a man who imparts a rather interesting and very cynical philosophy to the young Otto.  At one point, Bud announces that he doesn't allow two types of people in his car.  Which two groups does Bud shun?", "correct": "Commies and Christians", "options": ["Socialists and Jews", "Terrorists and Buddhists", "Capitalists and Muslims"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommies and Christians.\n\n\tBud announces the importance of 'credit' in American society, and criticizes the Russian 'commie' system because they don't have credit.  When Otto question's Bud's words, Bud asks, 'What are you, some kind of commie?'  Otto replies, 'No, I ain't no commie.'  Bud responds, 'Good!  I don't want no commies in my car. No Christians either!'  Bud is generally a misanthrope, he also claims to hate 'ordinary people'. \n"}, {"text": "Otto gets to talking with one of the repo men, a very odd sort named Miller.  Miller talks metaphysics with Otto in what has to be one of the most disjointed speeches of the film.  What food dish does he mention in his odd monologue?", "correct": "Plate o' shrimp", "options": ["Buffalo wings", "Surf and turf", "Chicken 'n corn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlate o' shrimp.\n\n\tMiller's longest monologue is as follows: 'A lot o' people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch o' unconnected incidents 'n things. They don't realize that there's this, like, lattice o' coincidence that lays on top o' everything. Give you an example; show you what I mean: suppose you're thinkin' about a plate o' shrimp. Suddenly someone'll say, like, plate, or shrimp, or plate o' shrimp out of the blue, no explanation. No point in lookin' for one, either. It's all part of a cosmic unconciousness.'  Otto responds by asking Miller if he 'ate a lot of acid...back in the hippie days'. \n"}, {"text": "Otto meets a girl during the film named Leila that he takes a liking to.  Aside from her work at the 'United Fruitcake Outlet' (notice the initials) and her bizarre theories about alien beings, what other odd activity does she clearly relish?", "correct": "Torture", "options": ["Stealing cars", "Skydiving", "Deep-sea diving"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTorture.\n\n\tLeila shows a clear relish for torture when she appears in the control room of a torture chamber, with Otto as the 'test subject'.  She happily delivers an electric shock to her erstwhile boyfriend.  She also announces, 'I'd torture someone in a second if it was up to me.'  Later in the film when she sees Otto again she is quoted, 'I'm glad I tortured you!'  All in fun, of course... \n"}, {"text": "Late in the film, Otto finally manages to catch up with the Chevy Malibu, which is being driven by the same very odd man, a certain J. Frank Parnell.  Parnell delivers a monologue that is perhaps more bizarre than Millers.  He talks of lobotomies, chest X-rays and what type of military weapon?", "correct": "Neutron bomb", "options": ["Death ray", "Space lasers", "Ultimate nullifier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeutron bomb.\n\n\tAccording to Parnell, it was his friend who designed the neutron bomb, a weapon so deadly it can kill all people but leave buildings and other objects standing.  Fortunately, Parnell says, his friend had a lobotomy and 'now he's well again'. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the film, which two characters take off in the glowing Chevy Malibu?", "correct": "Otto and Miller", "options": ["Otto and Leila", "Otto and Parnell", "Otto and Bud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOtto and Miller.\n\n\tMiller, who doesn't drive throughout the film, and in fact criticizes the act of driving, sits in the driver's seat of the Malibu.  He then invites Otto in and the glowing car takes off in flight over Los Angeles.  A crazy end to a crazy movie!  Thanks for taking the time to play this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it.
