However, Balaam was too concerned with what he wanted to notice the angel. What always strikes me as funny is that he also failed to notice that a donkey was talking. When the donkey questioned why he treated him so cruelly, the man replied as if donkeys talked all the time. \n"}, {"text": "According to Jude 1:14, how far from Adam is Enoch?", "correct": "seventh", "options": ["fourth", "sixth", "third"], "explanation": "\n\n\nseventh.\n\n\tIt says in Jude 1:14, \"And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints.\"\r The tree line from Adam to Enoch is as follows: Adam and Eve begat Seth who begat Enos who begat Cainan who begat Mahalaleel who begat Jared who begat Enoch. \r There is another Enoch who is the son of Cain, another son of Adam's, but this verse refers to the Enoch that came from Seth's line. \n"}, {"text": "What do the end of verse 14 and the beginning of verse 15 say the Lord is coming to do?", "correct": "execute judgement on all", "options": ["free everyone from Satan", "decide if Pluto is a planet or not", "give everyone a hug"], "explanation": "\n\n\nexecute judgement on all.\n\n\tIt says in Jude 1:14-15, \"And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\" \n"}, {"text": "What does verse 18 (KJV) say there will be in the \"last time\"?", "correct": "mockers", "options": ["beaters", "stealers", "liars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmockers.\n\n\tIt says in Jude 1:18, \"How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.\"\r Mockers refers to people who mock other people for their beliefs in Jesus.
