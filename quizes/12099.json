But the next number, 1000000000000000, is 'wrapped around' by the computer to represent -32,768. -1 is then represented by 1111111111111111. \n"}, {"text": "Convert from binary to hexadecimal: 1000100010001000.", "correct": "8888", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n8888.\n\n\tThere's an easy shortcut converting binary to other bases that are powers of two (4, 8 - octal, 16 - hexadecimal): group the binary digits (bits) from the right in sets of 4 for hexadecimal, 3 for octal, or 2 for base 4. Convert each set, then concatinate them. E.g., 1000100010001000 grouped is 1000 1000 1000 1000. 1000 binary is 8 hex. So the hexadecimal conversion is 8888. \n"}, {"text": "Now for some weird base conversions: 54321 base 6 is _____ base 10?", "correct": "7465 & 7,465", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n7465 & 7,465.\n\n"}, {"text": "99 base 11 = ____ base 10?", "correct": "108", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n108.\n\n"}, {"text": "1212 base 3 = ____ base 10?", "correct": "50", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n50.\n\n"}, {"text": "1234 base 5 = ____ base 10?", "correct": "194", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n194.\n\n"}, {"text": "5555 decimal = ____ base 10?", "correct": "5,555 & 5555", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n5,555 & 5555.\n\n\tTrick question: base 10 and decimal are the same thing. \n"}, {"text": "80 base 10 = ____ base 3?", "correct": "2222", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n2222.\n\n"}, {"text": "32 base 10 = ___ base 16?", "correct": "twenty&20", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwenty&20.\n\n"}, {"text": "7776 base 10 = ____ base 6?", "correct": "100000", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n100000.\n\n"}, {"text": "30 base 7 = ___ base 3?", "correct": "210", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n210.\n\n"}, {"text": "AA base 16 = ___ base 8?", "correct": "252", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n252.\n\n"}, {"text": "48,813 base 10 = ____ base 16?", "correct": "BEAD", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBEAD.\n\n"}, {"text": "1110111011101110 base 2 = ____ base 16?", "correct": "EEEE", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEEEE.\n\n\tDon't be scared.... 8-) \n"}, {"text": "999 base 16 = ___ base 3", "correct": "10101000", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n10101000.\n\n"}, {"text": "3 base 10 = ___ base 12?", "correct": "3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n"}, {"text": "22 base 5 = ___ base 2", "correct": "1100", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n1100.\n\n"}, {"text": "FFFF base 16 = ____ base 10", "correct": "65535 & 65,535", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n65535 & 65,535.\n\n"}, {"text": "777 base 8 = ___ base 10?", "correct": "511", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n511.\n\n"}, {"text": "432432 base 5 = ____ base 10?", "correct": "14742 & 14,742", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n14742 & 14,742.\n\n"}, {"text": "8888 hexadecimal = ____ decimal?", "correct": "34952 & 34,952", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n34952 & 34,952.\n\n"}]}
