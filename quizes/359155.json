They wore only plain white togas and laurel wreaths.\n\nIn which Vegas hotel might I have seen these showgirls?", "correct": "Caesar's Palace", "options": ["Luxor", "Excalibur", "Tropicana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaesar's Palace.\n\n\tCaesar's Palace (a hotel with an ancient Roman theme) opened in August 1966, and is famous for its Forum Shops and Colosseum venue. It is also known for a fountain which Evel Knievel failed to leap over in 1967 (his son, Robbie, successfully jumped the fountain in 1989). \n"}, {"text": "As I watched the next show, I paid special attention to the showgirls. These ladies wore long, basic dresses down to their ankles. These particular kalasiris had feathers and beads all over.\n\nIn which Vegas hotels would showgirls possibly wear this garb?", "correct": "Luxor", "options": ["Tropicana", "The Venetian", "Harrah's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuxor.\n\n\tThe Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas first opened in October 1993, which contained the then largest open atrium in the world; at over 29 million cubic feet.  The hotel is noted for its shape that mimics the pyramids in ancient Thebes (the city now called Luxor, namesake of the hotel).  There is also a scale-model of the Great Sphinx outside the hotel.\r Interestingly, the pyramid-shaped hotel became the sixth largest pyramid in the world upon completion. \n"}, {"text": "I sat down to enjoy my meal of whole chicken and dragon's blood (it was tomato soup) and anxiously awaited to the start of the \"Tournament of Kings\". I looked at the showgirls, who seemed to be wearing old dresses, reminiscent of what Guinevere would wear.\n\nWhich hotel is described above?", "correct": "Excalibur", "options": ["Caesar's Palace", "The Venetian", "Casino Royale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExcalibur.\n\n\tExcalibur opened in June of 1990, and carries the theme of \"Camelot\". One popular show that takes place at Excalibur is the \"Tournament of Kings\". The show is based on Arthurian legend, and it is somewhat interactive with the audience as well (my favorite part was shouting out \"Huzzah\" when asked). \n"}, {"text": "While watching \"Sirens of TI\", I decided to pay close attention to the apparel of the showgirls. At this hotel, they all wore wooden legs and eye patches.\n\nWhich hotel's showgirls would possibly wear such outfits?", "correct": "Treasure Island", "options": ["Casino Royale", "Luxor", "Bellagio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTreasure Island.\n\n\tTreasure Island opened in October of 1993. They are perhaps most known for their nightly show called \"Sirens of TI (TI stands for Treasure Island)\". The show is free, so it is quite a popular attraction of Las Vegas. The show began in 2003 when it replaced the \"Battle of Buccaneer Bay\" show. \n"}, {"text": "Watching the shows at this next hotel, I couldn't help but notice the showgirls were much more scantily-clad. Some wore bikinis, others wore shorts and tank tops. The garb of these showgirls seemed rather beach-like, almost Floridian in nature.\n\nWhich Florida-themed hotel would these showgirls possibly be found?", "correct": "Tropicana", "options": ["Bellagio", "Luxor", "Harrah's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTropicana.\n\n\tTropicana opened in October of 1957, and has a \"South Beach Miami\" theme. It may be interesting to know that the casino scenes of \"The Godfather\" (1972) was filmed in the Tropicana's casinos. \n"}, {"text": "The next few showgirls I saw were at the Blue Man Group's show. They dressed appropriately to the hotel's theme, which is a casino in Monaco. The gowns were beautiful.\n\nThe hotel themed after a casino in Monaco is which of these options?", "correct": "Monte Carlo", "options": ["Caesar's Palace", "Tropicana", "Treasure Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonte Carlo.\n\n\tMonte Carlo Resort opened in June of 1996. The theme of this Vegas hotel is of a very famous casino in the Monte Carlo region of Monaco. Place du Casino (the casino in Monaco) is a beautiful building, if you've ever seen pictures or had a chance to visit. \n"}, {"text": "At this hotel, I couldn't help but notice the pure elegance of the showgirls' outfits. The dresses were flowing, laced, and beaded, but not too overdone. The hotel did a good job keeping with the elegant Italian theme.\n\nWhich hotel, with an Italian theme, could these showgirls be from?", "correct": "Bellagio", "options": ["Harrah's", "Excalibur", "Casino Royale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBellagio.\n\n\tThe Bellagio opened in October of 1998, and is famous for its elegant theme. The hotel is based on the Lake Como region of Bellagio, Italy. In the Bellagio, there is a beautiful dancing water fountain as well as a gorgeous glass-blown flower ceiling. \n"}, {"text": "Finding showgirls at a small hotel famed more for casinos than shows is difficult. In fact, there really weren't any at all. So, taking a break from Vegas hotel shows, I decided to play some craps at this hotel with a European Villa theme. As I said, there were no showgirls, but the staff was appropriately dressed for a villa in Europe.\n\nWhich of these hotels is it?", "correct": "Casino Royale", "options": ["Caesar's Palace", "The Venetian", "Monte Carlo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCasino Royale.\n\n\tThe Casino Royale opened in January 1992 after purchasing the Nob Hill Casino, as well as the Travelodge for rooms. The European themed hotel and casino may not be famed for its shows, but it is well known for its slots. \n"}, {"text": "The next show I saw had showgirls that were dressed more like I had pictured that any previous show. There were tons of feathers, elaborate masks, and vibrantly colored outfits. These showgirl outfits really made me feel I was at a true Carnaval.\n\nWhich hotel would have showgirls dressed as such?", "correct": "Harrah's", "options": ["Treasure Island", "Monte Carlo", "Bellagio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarrah's.\n\n\tHarrah's opened in 1973, though it was not called Harrah's until 1992 (it was Holiday Casino before). The Carnaval and Mardis Gras themes did not appear either until renovations in 1997. \n"}, {"text": "While watching my final show I saw a bunch of showgirls wearing outfits as if they were in an opera. One, named Christine, was given special attention. I was confused by the masked man who kept popping in to interrupt the opera-themed showgirls. It wasn't until the chandelier fell that I knew I had been mistaken as to what show I was really watching.\n\nAt which hotel did I mix up a famous musical show for one with showgirls?", "correct": "The Venetian", "options": ["Monte Carlo", "Excalibur", "Treasure Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Venetian.\n\n\tThe Venetian (with a theme of Venice) was opened in May 1999, only a few short years after the previous Sands Hotel had been removed from that location. Of course, I'd confused the musical \"Phantom of the Opera\" (for which the Venetian is somewhat well known) for a show with showgirls. \n"}]}
