{"id": "198282", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Bananas, Crackers and Nuts' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "A long session in the operating room has Hawkeye and Trapper on edge.  What they need, or so they believe, is a good martini.  After entering the Swamp, the two of them get into a little spat because...?", "correct": "The still is dry", "options": ["They are out of olives", "Their martini glasses are dirty", "Their swizzle stick is broken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe still is dry.\n\n\tAfter emerging from the O.R., Trapper insists that they need a meal, but Hawkeye trumps him with the suggestion of an aperitif.  Unfortunately, they have had such a long operating session that the still has been neglected.  This causes what Trapper terms 'our first fight...us against them', to which Hawkey responds, 'Whoever the them we were always us!' \n"}, {"text": "Driven to distraction as a result of the endless drudgery at the 4077th, Trapper and Hawkeye claim to need a certain remedy.  What is it that they insist will break the current duldrums?", "correct": "A trip to the R&R Center in Tokyo", "options": ["Three days at the Pagoda Palace in Seoul", "A camp toga party", "A double date with two nurses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA trip to the R&R Center in Tokyo.\n\n\tHawkeye talks of two days in Tokyo, and Trapper makes it three.  Unfortunately, Henry is having none of it and reduces their Tokyo trip to a pipedream, even despite Hawkeye's mad pleadings.  Henry then leaves camp on a trip of his own, at which time Trapper asks Hawkeye if he was acting.  Hawkeye claims, 'You ain't seen nothing yet.' \n"}, {"text": "Wacky antics ensue at the 4077th after Hawkeye and Trapper are unable to achieve their goal.  For one thing, a dog is found in a hospital bed.  For another, Hawkeye turns down a date with Nurse Cutler.  What are his parting words after rejecting Cutler's suggestion of a night out?", "correct": "I'm not that kind of a boy.", "options": ["I'm already taken, I have a date with Klinger.", "I've forgotten how to kiss.", "My father has grounded me for two weeks."], "explanation": "\n\n\nI'm not that kind of a boy.\n\n\tNurse Cutler innocently suggests that she and Hawkeye might enjoy some time together, but Hawkeye is not playing along.  Rather, in his attempt to convince the camp that he is losing his marbles, he makes a scene at Cutler's expense.  \r 'I know what you want, what they all want.  You think just because a guy smiles at you and lets you get in front of him in chow line, he's a pushover.  Well let me tell you something, Lieutenant.  Forget it!  I'm not that kind of a boy.' \n"}, {"text": "In his craziest stunt yet, Hawkeye appears in the mess tent in full surgical garb carrying a plate.  What anatomical item does Hawkeye claim to have on the plate?", "correct": "Liver", "options": ["Brain", "Kidney", "Heart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiver.\n\n\tNot only does he claim it to be a liver, he claims it to be a human liver from a North Korean who apparently did not make it.  Naturally, the very people he is trying to impress with this stunt, Hot Lips and Frank, are appalled at the very notion of Hawkeye's emerging cannabalistic tendencies. \n"}, {"text": "Frank Burns makes the mistake of questioning Hawkeye's behavior, and even more egregious, touching Hawkeye's sterile plate.  This results in a confrontation between the two that ends with which of these events?", "correct": "Trapper slaps Hawkeye and sends him to the Swamp", "options": ["Hawkeye accosts Hot Lips and kisses her", "Hawkeye punches Frank in the nose", "Hawkeye removes his clothes and runs across the camp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrapper slaps Hawkeye and sends him to the Swamp.\n\n\tAfter slapping Hawkeye in this mock demonstation of Hawkeye's madness, Trapper sends his bunkmate to the Swamp under Radar's supervision.  Trapper instructs Radar to give Hawkeye the 'blue pill', whatever that may be.  Meanwhile, Frank cowers in the arms of Hot Lips...it appears that their little ruse has had the desired effect. \n"}, {"text": "Unfortunately for Hawkeye and Trapper, Frank and Hot Lips are too paranoid and untrusting to fall for their delicately formulated strategem.  Rather than sympathetically opening up to the two Swamp rats, Hot Lips suggests that her old psychiatrist friend be summoned.  What is the name of this friend of hers from the 423rd evac hospital?", "correct": "Phil Sherman", "options": ["Mark Wallace", "Bill Flaherty", "Parry Schilling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhil Sherman.\n\n\tPhil Sherman is marvelously played by Stuart Margolin, who makes his first of two 'M*A*S*H' appearances in this episode (his second being in the season two episode 'Operation Noselift').  In both episodes, Sherman goes after Hot Lips in rib-tickling fashion. \n"}, {"text": "The psychiatrist begins his examination of Hawkeye in the Swamp.  Rather than being a cooperative patient, Hawkeye continues to promote the idea that he is not sane.  Hawkeye annoys the head doctor by participating in an unsolicited session of free association.  How does Hawkeye respond when the psychiatrist says 'Pierce'?", "correct": "Arrow", "options": ["Franklin", "Mildred", "Brosnan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArrow.\n\n\tWhile Dr. Sherman wants in good faith to do a regular psychiatric evaluation on Hawkeye, the latter has other ideas in mind.  Hawkeye wants to convince the shrink that he is not all there, and refuses to cooperate with Sherman at every turn.  The psychiatrist is convinced that Hawkeye is certifiable only after Hawkeye professes his love for Frank Burns, even suggesting that he sleeps with Frank's shaving brush under his pillow.  Not politically correct humor, especially in this day and age, but convincing enough for Sherman! \n"}, {"text": "After a thorough psychiatric evaluation, Hawkeye is found to be mentally unstable and is requested to be decommissioned and sent back to the states where he will be committed to an institution.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNot quite so drastic.  Dr. Sherman requests that Hawkeye be sent to Tokyo for a couple of weeks of 'observation'.  Indeed, Hawkeye and Trapper want to go to Tokyo, but not quite in the manner that Sherman has suggested.  \r Henry, who has returned to camp, objects to his best doctor being taken to Tokyo for an extended period of time, and asks when Hawkeye will be returned.  Dr. Sherman's response is that he will 'do the best he can'.  Henry answers, 'This is the army.  Nobody can do the best they can!' \n"}, {"text": "Sitting in the mess tent smoking a cigarette, the psychiatrist enjoys a nice hot cup of coffee in solitude.  Which member of the 4077th comes to join the doctor, and convinces the poor fellow that Hot Lips is 'motioning' to him?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Trapper", "Klinger", "Father Mulcahy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tWhen Sherman looks forward, Radar acts as if Hot Lips is motioning to him.  Of course, Hot Lips is doing nothing of the sort, and naturally Sherman sees no signs of Margaret's secret signals when he turns toward her.  Radar does his best to convince Sherman that Margaret is in love with him, suggesting that he overheard her talking fondly of her old friend.  Of course, Sherman is being set up for the kill here... \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the episode, Hawkeye is able to escape from the clutches of the psychiatrist.  What has happened that allows Hawkeye to remain at the 4077th?", "correct": "The psychiatrist has come on to Margaret in her tent", "options": ["The psychiatrist is caught wearing a dress", "The psychiatrist has physically attacked Frank Burns", "The psychiatrist takes a shower in the nurses' shower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe psychiatrist has come on to Margaret in her tent.\n\n\tRadar mischievously switches the sign on Hot Lip's tent, making it appear to be the visiting officer's tent.  In addition, the light in Margaret's tent has been switched off.  Sherman falls asleep in Margaret's bed, and later Hot Lips enters her tent and begins to undress.  Sherman believes that Hot Lips is in love with him, and when he attempts to return the love she screams.  The flabbergasted Sherman leaves the camp in disgrace, and Hawkeye is allowed to remain.\r I hope you have enjoyed this quiz and will try some of my other 'M*A*S*H' quizzes in the future...thank you. \n"}]}
