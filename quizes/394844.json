After having gone through all the legal paperwork with a realtor and having heard the spiel about the house's lack of occupancy due to its less-than-savoury history, Madison Montgomery and Behold Chablis arrived to take their first steps on their new property. To search deeper into Michael Langdon's past, they needed to pose as a couple and purchase the house, site of the deaths of at least thirty-six people.  Upon entering, they found that the house still looked lived-in despite being seemingly abandoned; Chablis noted its strong, malevolent psychic energy. Nevertheless, they had to make themselves at home. \n"}, {"text": "Behold realized that the murder house was able to suppress his magical abilities.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tBehold and Madison got to work quickly, setting up a ritual so that they could work unhindered by the strong magical energies of the house.  As Behold realized, his powers weren't working since they entered the building.  When the ritual was completed, they emerged into the spirit side of the house, then able to see the ghosts as they walked on the other side.\rIn one room of the house, Ben Harmon had a session with Tate Langdon, both of them discussing their separations from the people they love-- Vivien wouldn't talk to Ben and Violet still chose to ignore Tate for what he did.  When Madison and Behold interrupted their session though, they didn't get very far.  Neither of the ghosts feared the witches' power and, in fact, Tate warned them that they may have underestimated the house. \n"}, {"text": "Who, of the ghosts, still claimed to be the rightful owner of the house?", "correct": "Constance", "options": ["Ben", "Patrick", "Charles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConstance.\n\n\tAs Behold and Madison wandered the house's halls musing about the tragedy that befell its inhabitants, Madison was tackled to the ground by Beauregard, the youngest Langdon sibling, but saved by none other than Billie Dean Howard, the famous psychic and 'medium to the stars'.  Still alive, she claimed to recognize Madison Montgomery (having known a few Montgomeries) and she warned the witches of their predicament, but all of them were interrupted by Constance Langdon who, descending the stairs, suggested that they had trespassed in her house-- not theirs. Nevertheless, Constance brought everyone upstairs and poured a drink...just before heading back out to berate Moira, the maid, for her poor cleaning job in the living room. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Moira wish for her bones to be laid to rest?", "correct": "In a cemetery", "options": ["At sea", "In Florida", "At the murder house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a cemetery.\n\n\tThe witches and Billie Dean headed down to the Living Room to speak to Constance but as soon as Madison brought up Michael Langdon, Billie Dean spoke on the ghost's behalf, refusing to answer questions.  Constance allowed it though, and said she would speak if they helped her get rid of Moira once and for all, purging her from the house to give her the peace and quiet she deserved. And so began the hunt for her body with Behold digging up the backyard in search of her remains.  They found her bones, fortunately, and brought them to Moira who, immensely pleased with the recovery, asked to be buried with her mother. Her wishes were granted and her soul put to rest; she and her mother walked, hand-in-hand, into the afterlife at long last. \n"}, {"text": "Every time Constance had to clean up after Michael, she did which of the following?", "correct": "Planted a rose bush", "options": ["Cooked a big meal", "Said a prayer", "Wept for him"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlanted a rose bush.\n\n\tAfter removing Moira from the house, the witches returned to Constance for answers.  The story began with Vivien and Ben.  After Vivien died in childbirth, Constance took up the burden of raising the newborn Michael because, after all, Tate, the father, was her son.  The baby was charming but over time Michael began to kill small animals and then, when he was older, he had bigger aspirations. Constance saw the writing on the wall but acted dutifully to bury his gifts to her, placing them underground in the garden and planting rose bushes atop them.  Before long, she got sick of the smell of roses and began to run out of room in the yard. And then one day he aged a decade overnight. \n"}, {"text": "In an attempt to free herself from Michael, Constance took her own life by which means?", "correct": "Pills and alcohol", "options": ["Gun", "Noose", "Self-immolation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPills and alcohol.\n\n\tOne day, Constance awoke to hands around her neck as Michael tried to choke her to death, claiming that she no longer told him what to do.  When he realized what he was doing, he snapped out of it and regretted his actions.  Constance realized that sacred intervention would be necessary, but that too proved to be a foiled plan (and another corpse).  Realizing that she was no longer able to be a mother was a shattering truth for her. She was no longer necessary to Michael and, to act on her own terms, she brought herself back to the murder house to end it all.  After enough booze and pills, it all ended in the company of people she knew-- her children-- and they awaited her. As for Michael, she never wanted to see him again. \n"}, {"text": "Ben, in an attempt to sway Michael to be good, took him under his wing and found which of these to be true?", "correct": "Michael was brilliant", "options": ["Michael could change his own appearance", "Michael had a great sense of humour", "Michael was beyond his years in knowledge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael was brilliant.\n\n\tBehold and Madison returned to Ben up in the bedroom seeking more answers and offering a cure for his darkest impulses.  He obliged their request, stating that the first time he saw his son was when Constance died and searched the house to find her body there.  Ben appeared to Michael and offered to help because he couldn't help but pretend he was his father, even though he technically wasn't, and they spoke at length that very day in a psych session in the living room. Michael desperately wanted to be good and he was brilliant.  But one day, after Tate confronted him in his room, it appeared he was shifting back to the dark side. Soon after, he began to enact evil deeds on the spirits of the house, performing surgery on Elizabeth Short and then killing future buyers of the house shortly after their arrival dressed in the rubberman outfit.  After killing two people, he immolated their souls in front of Ben. \n"}, {"text": "Vivien claimed that who of the following visited the murder house searching for Michael?", "correct": "Anton LaVey", "options": ["L. Ron Hubbard", "Billie Dean Howard", "Richard Ramirez"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnton LaVey.\n\n\tAfter Ben's story, Madison and Behold realized that their new Supreme was, essentially, pure evil.  Before the witches could leave though, Vivien appeared.  Their baby cried from the other room and Vivien asked Ben to take care of their child while she talked to the others.  She warned the witches that they would need much more than their current capabilities to defeat Michael since his power was immeasurable; she quoted the Book of Revelations after she said this. He was an unnatural being and she was afraid to be around him.  Strange things started to happen though.  It was always sweltering in the house, and there was always a murder of crows outside. And then a group of people came.  Satanists. \n"}, {"text": "Vivien claimed that neither Tate nor Ben was Michael's true father.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThree Satanists arrived-- Anton LaVey himself, Miriam Mead, and a second Cardinal of the Church of Satan.  LaVey claimed to have faked his death to prepare for the day he would meet the Chosen One.  It was like they opened a door for Michael that day.  It seemed like a big con to Vivien until the night that they had the Black Mass. Miriam kidnapped a girl from a bus stop, drugged her, and brought her to the house to be sacrificed before Michael.  The others removed the girl's heart for the boy to eat, and when he did, a winged shadow appeared behind him-- Satan.  That night a hailstorm pervaded and the rain was blood. Vivien tried to kill Michael that night, but he nearly got the upper hand and set her ablaze instead.  The only reason she survived was because Tate saved her.  Vivien realized that neither Ben nor Tate was Michael's father.  In this house, built on a portal to Hell, he was Satan's son-- the Antichrist. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the last ghost Madison encountered in the murder house?", "correct": "Violet", "options": ["Nora", "Chad", "Travis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViolet.\n\n\tMadison made a swift attempt at leaving the murder house with Behold following close behind.  Behold agreed with Madison that they needed to do something, but the two of them didn't know what quite to do other than tell Cordelia what they discovered.   Before they left, crying from a nearby hallway caught Madison's attention and it's there that she found Violet Harmon.  Choosing to talk to the girl alone, she found out that Violet was unable to help her with Michael.  That said, Madison was able to help Violet instead, suggesting that Tate was forced to act because of the evil of the house and Satan's influence, and perhaps the evil left with Michael.  Tate apologized to Violet and the two reunited shortly after.\rOn the way out, Violet and Behold hopped into their car and Madison magically shut the gate behind them. \n"}]}
