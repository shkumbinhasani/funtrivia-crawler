{"id": "365416", "name": "BioShock Infinite Trivia Quiz | BioShock | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games A-C", "BioShock"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of the floating city found in the game?", "correct": "Columbia", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nColumbia.\n\n\tThe game begins with private investigator Booker DeWitt approaching a lighthouse which is also the secret launching point sending him high into the sky to Columbia, a floating city built on the foundations of elitist American exceptionalism.  His mission?  It's to collect a girl imprisoned in the city and return her to the surface to wipe clean his extensive gambling debts. What he finds is that Columbia, while festive and ideal on the surface, is much darker underneath as it reveals a racist, overtly-religious, and insanely extremist side which can only lead to its own civil war and destruction. \n"}, {"text": "Booker can power himself up with superpowered liquids known as Vigors.  Which is not one of them?", "correct": "Telekinesis", "options": ["Shock Jockey", "Murder of Crows", "Possession"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelekinesis.\n\n\tWhile Telekinesis appears as an EVE-fueled Plasmid in the original \"BioShock\" and \"BioShock 2\", it does not make an appearance in \"Infinite's\" Columbia, instead being replaced by a new array of Salt-driven Vigors, each one more interesting than the last.  There are eight in the game, some of which are completely required for progress (eg. Shock Jockey's electrical powers).  Some, like Murder of Crows, allow you to attack enemies while others, like Possession, allow others to attack their allies (and themselves).  In the \"Burial at Sea\" DLC, the Old Man Winter Vigor became the ninth in the set. \n"}, {"text": "The setting of the game is dotted with tears in the space-time continuum.  Who can open them?", "correct": "Elizabeth", "options": ["Comstock", "Booker", "Daisy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElizabeth.\n\n\tOnce Booker finds Elizabeth in her celled-off residence in the giant statue of Monument Island, he discovers that she has the impossible ability to open tears in space and time, creating windows into parallel universes, some of which are in the future, some of which are in the past, and some of which are in the present though in alternate timelines.  The ability becomes of some use to the duo later in the game as they make their way through a crumbling Columbia.  Some of these tears lead to irreversible actions on their part, and some of these actions lead to casualties beyond their control. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these types of weapons is not found in the game?", "correct": "Flamethrower", "options": ["Pistol", "Sniper Rifle", "Shotgun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlamethrower.\n\n\tWhile the weapons of Columbia are varied, none are as exotic as the Flamethrower, a device which does not make an appearance in the game.  In fact, the Firemen-- enemies which wield powerful fire attacks-- use Vigors to accomplish their strategies in battle.  Nonetheless there are many different options for weapons (though you can only hold two, plus your melee weapon).  These can range from Pistols to Shotguns to Crank Guns to Carbines to Burst Guns...and all of them can be upgraded with the right amount of Silver Eagles. Even if you aren't carrying specific guns at any given time, you carry the ammo, so if you need to switch them out on the fly, you're loaded. \n"}, {"text": "During the course of the game, you will likely encounter a number of Motorized Patriots, enemies which appear in the likeness of all but which of these famous figures?", "correct": "Thomas Edison", "options": ["Abraham Lincoln", "George Washington", "Zachary Comstock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThomas Edison.\n\n\tMotorized Patriots are amongst the heaviest-hitting enemy forces in the game, literally built as giant, clockwork representations of the Founding Fathers.  George Washington typically appears carrying a pepper mill (a Gatling Gun) while Honest Abe will do the same, only fighting for the resisting forces of Columbia, the Vox Populi.  Late in the game, similar versions modeled after Columbia's founder, Zachary Comstock, also appear.  While they can be taken down in a matter of shots, all Motorized Patriots have a weak point on their back. \n"}, {"text": "Booker can use Lockpicks found throughout the game to open locked doors.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhile Booker can find Lockpicks dropped throughout Columbia (or purchased from the Dollar Bill machines) he can not actually use them.  That task is left to the multi-talented Elizabeth who, while residing in her prison on Monument Island, learned how to pick locks with finesse.  While many of the simpler locks in the game which bar off points of vital importance to the progression of the story only require a hairpin to open, hidden parts of the game can require one, three, or even five Lockpicks to advance. Most of the doors with higher Lockpick ratings have important upgrades within; the highest value is assigned to safes, most of which will only contain Silver Eagles (though quite a few). \n"}, {"text": "Infusions can level up all but which of these in the game?", "correct": "Ammo capacity", "options": ["Shield capacity", "Salt capacity", "Health"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmmo capacity.\n\n\tInfusions are essentially potions/vigors designed to boost Booker's personal capacities, usually involving the bars in the top and bottom left of the screen.  Each one gives a choice between health (red), shields (yellow) and salts (blue) and each can be upgraded a total of ten times to the player's liking.  In most cases, these can be found behind locked doors.  It's apparent which bottle contains an Infusion-- they tend to phase in and out.  It's impossible to get all of your bars full by the game's end, nor is it imperative. \n"}, {"text": "Elizabeth and Booker discover that the Songbird will only respond favorably to which notes?", "correct": "C-A-G-E", "options": ["F-A-D-E", "A-D-A-G-E", "D-E-A-F"], "explanation": "\n\n\nC-A-G-E.\n\n\tThe Songbird, responsible for both protecting and imprisoning Elizabeth on Monument Island, menaces the duo throughout Columbia, often appearing at the sound of a distinct whistle-- four notes designed to call the trained bird to Comstock if need-be.  At the end of the game, Elizabeth will discover (via a note from a future iteration of herself from a different reality) that the Songbird will respond to the notes C-A-G-E, which is ironic considering the choices made between birds and cages early in the game. At this point, Songbird becomes an ally to protect Booker and Elizabeth on Comstock's airship...before Elizabeth has to destroy him, drowning him underwater in an all-too-familiar undersea city from the \"BioShock\" series. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only melee weapon found in the game?", "correct": "Skyhook", "options": ["Brass knuckles ", "Magnet fist", "Freedom glove"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkyhook.\n\n\tThe Skyhook is obtained by Booker early in the game when he wins the raffle upon arriving at the fair in Columbia.  When the guards discover that his hand bears the symbol of the prophesized 'Shepherd' who would mark the downfall of Columbia, they try to detain him and he ends up getting a hold of their own Skyhooks.  At this point, it can be used for the remainder of the game.  It's particularly useful in battle (and can be upgraded with gear found throughout) but it's also necessary to travel along the sky-lines, the long, metallic rail systems linking parts of the city together. \n"}, {"text": "Do Booker and Elizabeth make it to Paris?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhen Booker and Elizabeth destroy the siphon hidden in the Monument of Columbia, Elizabeth's mind immediately awakens and she is able to take Booker through the doorways leading through other realities.  It is by doing this that she is able to force Booker to come to terms with his past-- he is Zachary Comstock, but from another reality, and Elizabeth is actually his daughter, Anna. It's because of his choices that she is able to open tears through the worlds and the only way he can stop Comstock from destroying everything is by killing him at birth.  This, it is determined, is during his baptism, the point at which he found religion and subsequently founded Columbia. Several versions of Elizabeth/Anna drown him in the baptismal pool before disappearing one by one, perhaps ending the cycle once and for all. \n"}]}
