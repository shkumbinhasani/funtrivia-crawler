{"id": "367453", "name": "The FunTrivia Setlist [7] Quiz | Music Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", " Music Mixture", "Name the Song"], "questions": [{"text": "\"You get a shiver in the dark, it's a raining in the park but meantime...\"\nSo starts the first major single of Dire Straits, released in 1978, which went by what name?", "correct": "Sultans of Swing", "options": ["Walk of Life", "Money For Nothing", "Brothers in Arms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSultans of Swing.\n\n\tWhen the Knopflers created Dire Straits in the late 1970s, it wasn't quite apparent that they would end up bringing forth several 'firsts' in the music industry.  While \"Sultans of Swing\" became their first major U.S. single (off their self-titled album), later releases like \"Brothers in Arms\" would go on to win Grammy and BRIT Awards.  From that, their track \"Money For Nothing\" became the first music video to air on MTV Europe.  Their eponymous debut reached number two on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Australian Albums Chart.\r We can thank Dcpddc478 for this recommendation. \n"}, {"text": "The Newsboys consisted of six members when they released which of these songs, also the name of their sixth album (and their first to hit number one on the Billboard Christian Rock chart)?", "correct": "Take Me To Your Leader", "options": ["Shine", "I'm Not Ashamed", "Joy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTake Me To Your Leader.\n\n\tWhile the Newsboys, known for their Christian Rock offerings, has had numerous line-up changes over their several decades in the industry, \"Take Me To Your Leader\", released in 1996, was the only one to contain six members instead of the usual four.  That said, despite consistent line-up changes, the band has had number one hits in both the Christian Rock and Rock charts in the U.S. all the way up to their eighteenth album.  \"Take Me To Your Leader\" also appeared on three of their official Greatest Hits albums.\r J-Zilch recommended this Christian rock selection. \n"}, {"text": "The biggest hit for Italian band Corona, which of these 1993 Eurodance songs was a club hit, but never appeared in \"A Night at the Roxbury\"?", "correct": "The Rhythm of the Night", "options": ["What is Love?", "Beautiful Life", "Rhythm is a Dancer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Rhythm of the Night.\n\n\tCorona struck with this one-hit wonder back in 1993, hopping onboard the Eurodance popularity bandwagon early on to help define the sounds of the decade.  Unlike Ace of Base and other groups from the era, they never really kept the momentum.  While \"The Rhythm of the Night\" reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 (and number one on the Italian charts), none of their later singles (save for one) charted in the U.S. despite releases all the way into the 2010s.\r Dg_dave pulled this one from the jukebox for us. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Metallica singles was the latest to be released?", "correct": "Sad but True", "options": ["Master of Puppets", "Enter Sandman", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSad but True.\n\n\t\"Sad but True\" was released on Metallica's fifth album, (an eponymous release, in 1992), becoming a single in the following year and narrowly cracking onto the Billboard Hot 100.  All of the other choices were major releases on earlier albums, specifically \"Master of Puppets\" and \"...And Justice For All\".  Metallica's next album, \"Load\", would be the top-selling album of 1996.\r It'd be wise to look to Zonko for this recommendation. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these songs by hip-hop artist Nicki Minaj featured guest vocals from Eminem?", "correct": "Roman's Revenge", "options": ["Super Bass", "Pound the Alarm", "Anaconda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoman's Revenge.\n\n\tRoman refers to Roman Zolanski, an alter ego persona that Nicki Minaj takes on through the \"Pink Friday\" album to represent an evil twin.  \"Roman's Revenge\" appeared early on Minaj's first album, \"Pink Friday\" (in 2010) and returned in \"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded\" in (2012) on the songs \"Roman Holiday\" and \"Roman Reloaded\".  The name Roman didn't reappear in a song title for \"The Pinkprint\", Minaj's third album, in 2014.\r Salami_Swami brings in a dash of the contemporary with this one. \n"}, {"text": "What country song, released in 1994, was a single for the American country band The Mavericks?", "correct": "O What a Thrill", "options": ["Ain't That Lonely Yet", "Stones in the Road", "Hard Workin' Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nO What a Thrill.\n\n\t\"O What a Thrill\" was more of a success on the Canadian charts than in the U.S. though it helped bring The Mavericks' third album, \"What a Crying Shame\", to the top of the Billboard Heatseekers chart (and number fifty-four on the Hot 100) in 1994.  The other choices available were major songs by Dwight Yoakam, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Brooks and Dunn, all country artists who released singles during the same period in the 1990s.\r This one's a song choice from Rossian. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these ABBA songs, released in 1977, was part of a 'mini-musical' on their \"ABBA: The Album\" record?", "correct": "Thank You For the Music", "options": ["Dancing Queen", "The Winner Takes It All", "Waterloo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThank You For the Music.\n\n\tAlong with \"I Wonder (Departure)\" and \"I'm a Marionette\", \"Thank You For the Music\" was part of a trilogy of songs in the 'The Girl with the Golden Hair' mini-musical formed on ABBA's fifth release, \"ABBA: The Album\".  The song \"Get On the Carousel\" rounded out the series.  \"Thank You For the Music\" ended up being only moderately popular, charting in Europe and the UK before becoming the name of an ABBA Greatest Hits compilation in 1983.  \"The Name of the Game\" was their big hit from the same album.\r And the real thanks goes to Malik24 for this recommendation. \n"}, {"text": "Pete Seeger covered what Phil Ochs song about American patriotism, also the name of a 1940 Graham Greene novel?", "correct": "The Power and Glory", "options": ["Where Have All the Flowers Gone?", "If I Had a Hammer", "Turn! Turn! Turn!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Power and Glory.\n\n\tWhile the song made Phil Ochs famous in 1964, Pete Seeger covered it in later years.  The song, full of similes and metaphors about America's greatness, was a suitable song to add to Seeger's folk sets.  He would go on to release dozens of albums, many featuring similarly patriotic songs spanning seven consecutive decades before his death in 2014 (at the age of 94).\r Looney_Tunes, one of our Australian authors, brought this one to the setlist. \n"}, {"text": "Released on their third LP, \"Eureka!\", what song by Canadian indie band Mother Mother sees consistent reinvention in melody throughout its verses?", "correct": "Original Spin", "options": ["Let's Fall in Love", "Get Out the Way", "Body of Years"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOriginal Spin.\n\n\tWhile \"Original Spin\" was never released as an official single by Mother Mother, the \"Eureka!\" album (their third full album) gave the band, newly-reformed, a chance to break out in the charts, and they did (in Canada) with \"The Stand\" and \"Baby Don't Dance\".  Since that album, they've consistently reappeared on the Canadian Alternative Rock chart with follow-ups like \"The Sticks\" and \"Very Good Bad Thing\".  Nonetheless, \"Original Spin\" epitomizes what their music is-- original, harmonious, and infectious.\r Kyleisalive unearthed this hidden indie gem for the FunTrivia Setlist. \n"}, {"text": "Panamanian ska band Los Rabanes debuted in 2000 with what cover of a reggae song, one which would lead to a Grammy nomination?", "correct": "My Commanding Wife", "options": ["Girl I Wanna Make You Sweat", "Jammin'", "Red Red Wine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Commanding Wife.\n\n\tReleasing \"My Commanding Wife\" on their debut album in both Spanish and English, Los Rabanes ended up receiving the inaugural nomination for the Latin Grammy Awards' Best Rock Album by a Duo or Group with Vocal (they lost to Aterciopelados).  Since their first album, however, they maintained popularity into the 2010s by continuing to release ska-infused rock music.  They would win several Latin Grammys in later years.  The original version of \"My Commanding Wife\" was a reggae tune by Boris Gardiner.\r This eclectic song choice comes courtesy of DaBomb619. \n"}]}
