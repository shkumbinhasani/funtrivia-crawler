His father advised him not to be nervous.  With steady hands they wouldn't miss; they've been hunters for generations.  Heading through the dense brush, the two of them inevitably needed to split up to flush their prey out. It worked.  Their prey, a witch, emerged from the trees begging for mercy.  Hank's father urged him to shoot her but he hesitated, giving her the chance to try and set him on fire.  She hit his father, who killed her with a shot to the head, and he learned that day never to forget what they were up against. \n"}, {"text": "What does Marie Laveau demand be done with Delphine's head?", "correct": "It be burned", "options": ["It be crushed under her boot", "It be reattached", "It be buried"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt be burned.\n\n\tFiona drops by Cornrow City with her recently-acquired cardboard box (containing Delphine LaLaurie's still-animated head) and demands a chat.  Fiona spots the rest of the body in a cage, still missing a hand as well.  Marie is amused by the idea that Fiona wants to talk about an alliance and refuses outright, mainly because the witch hunters they're all so worried about were hired by her to kill the coven.  She calls Queenie in to take Delphine's head and burn it in the back yard while she sends Fiona away. \n"}, {"text": "Did Cordelia believe that Myrtle was responsible for blinding her?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tBack at Miss Robichaux's Academy, Cordelia tries to make breakfast, blind, while Myrtle watches.  This proves utterly difficult and she frustrates easily over the situation.  Myrtle decides to ask Cordelia if she believes that she blinded her, even after, for all these years, she's tried to act as the mother she never had.  Cordelia tells her that she would never believe Myrtle would do such a thing-- Fiona set her up.  Her blindness gave her a real vision.  Myrtle says that if she could pluck the eyes from her head and give them to her, she would. \n"}, {"text": "Where are the Delphi Trust headquarters?", "correct": "Atlanta, Georgia", "options": ["New Orleans, Louisiana", "Baton Rouge, Louisana", "Nashville, Tennessee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtlanta, Georgia.\n\n\tHank heads to Atlanta to Delphi Trust to speak to his father, the head of the witch hunters at the corporation.  His father is not thrilled with the progress, or lack thereof, in New Orleans and he claims that Hank, their inside man, isn't even on the inside anymore since he's not living at the academy and he's siding with the voodoos.  He also complains that he killed Kaylee, but made a huge mess in doing so, putting the company at risk.  They admit to blinding Cordelia, but Hank is furious that they did this; his father is angry that he has feelings for her.  Something must be done. \n"}, {"text": "With what does Myrtle poison the other members of the council?", "correct": "Monkshood", "options": ["Strychnine", "Arsenic", "Curare"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonkshood.\n\n\tMyrtle invites the others in the council, Cecily Pembroke and Quentin, to the academy for a meal and serves them their palette cleansers before taking a seat.

In the middle of her conversation, however, the others show signs of stuttering and, in moments, they're fully paralyzed, unable to move whatsoever. Myrtle tells them that their melon balls have been dosed with monkshood; it causes human statue syndrome and their muscles are probably cemented solid.  She criticizes both of them and then says that she must help the coven and Cordelia thrive. Taking the melon baller from the bowl, she scoops out one of each of their eyes.

As the two fight, Fiona tells her to call the council to which Myrtle says that they're not seeing anyone right now.  What they all have to agree upon is that there are bigger threats outside.
