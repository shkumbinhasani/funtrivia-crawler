It's Dartmoor Online Trivia | Geography | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "England", " Southwest England"], "questions": [{"text": "If a walker was to cover one square mile of Dartmoor each day, approximately how long would it take him or her to cover Dartmoor's entire area?", "correct": "One year", "options": ["One month", "One decade", "One millennium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne year.\n\n\tThe Dartmoor National Park covers an area of 368 square miles or 954 square kilometres.  The highest point on Dartmoor is High Willhayes at just over 2,000 feet above sea level and its lowest point, Doghole Bridge, is at a mere 98 feet above sea level.  Over 50% of Dartmoor's total area lies at just under 1000 feet above sea level. \n"}, {"text": "Of the fourteen major named rivers that rise on Dartmoor, what is different about the rivers Taw and Okement? ", "correct": "They both flow in a northerly direction.", "options": ["They are the deepest and second deepest rivers in England.", "Strangely, they are both composed of salt water.", "They are navigable along their entire lengths."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey both flow in a northerly direction.\n\n\tBecause of the way that Dartmoor is positioned geologically, all but two of its major rivers flow to the south and east, discharging into the English Channel.  The River Taw flows northward and meets with the River Torridge before emptying into Bideford Bay, an area within the Bristol Channel near the town of Barnstaple. The River Okement, from which the town of Okehampton takes its name, is a tributary of the River Torridge and has its confluence with this river at the village of Meeth. \n"}, {"text": "Approximately 1% of Dartmoor's total area is occupied by eight of these crucial installations.  What are these features? ", "correct": "Reservoirs", "options": ["First aid stations", "Open cast copper mines", "Mountain rescue huts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReservoirs.\n\n\tThere are a total of eight reservoirs to be found within the Dartmoor National Park, many of which were built to provide fresh water supplies for the rapidly expanding city of Plymouth in the south and the tourist centre of Torbay and its environs in the east.  The reservoir at Meldon was the most recent to be completed with work finishing during 1972.  This reservoir is located in the northern part of the moor lying within a few miles of the town of Okehampton.Burrator Reservoir, further to the south and to the east of the town of Yelverton, came into service in 1898 and had its capacity expanded during 1929.  Today all eight reservoirs on Dartmoor provide increasingly vital habitats for numerous species of animals, birds and insects in addition to excellent facilities for leisure activities such as sailing, canoeing and fishing. \n"}, {"text": "The towns of Tavistock, Plympton, Ashburton and Chagford are still known today as the Devon Stannaries or the Stannary Towns.  From what natural commodity do these towns take this name?", "correct": "Tin", "options": ["Timber", "Coal", "Silica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTin.\n\n\tThe stannary towns take their name from 'stannum', the Latin word for tin.  Tin was discovered on Dartmoor during the 12th century and proved to be one of the richest sources in Europe this most useful of metals.  The stannary towns of Tavistock, Ashburton and Chagford were granted a number of unique privileges under a charter granted by England's King Edward I in 1305 which included the right to representation in the Stannary Parliament and a monopoly over all tin mining in Devon. The town of Plympton followed in 1328 after a representation made by the Sheriff of Devon which called for a port from which the stannaries' tin could be transported. \n"}, {"text": "Whilst driving over Dartmoor, we need to be aware that livestock and wildlife are not confined by fencing.  Of the following, which animal would you be most likely to encounter while on the moor?", "correct": "Pony", "options": ["Alpaca", "Beaver", "Lynx"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPony.\n\n\tThe Dartmoor Pony is indigenous to the area and is a particularly hardy breed; on Dartmoor's elevation to National Park status in 1951, the pony was adopted as the new National Park logo.  Dartmoor ponies can be categorised as 'native' or 'pure bred/registered'.  The native pony is the variety that will most often be encountered running freely across the moor and, although they might appear to be wild animals, they all have a legal owner. The pure bred ponies are those animals that have been bred from selected stallions and mares for showing and for riding.  This variety will rarely, if ever, be encountered running freely on the moors as they are considered more valuable. Each year during September and October, the ponies are moved from one area of moorland to another for grazing purposes in round-ups known locally as drifts.   \n"}, {"text": "Whilst out walking on Dartmoor, what might you expect to see if you were to encounter a field of 'clitters'?", "correct": "Granite boulders of varying size.", "options": ["A particularly hardy species of root vegetable.", "Elongated plantations of stunted trees.", "A hybrid species of sheep and goats."], "explanation": "\n\n\nGranite boulders of varying size.\n\n\tA clitter field could be considered to be a form of scree slope.  As the granite tors are eroded, large pieces of granite are broken off and accumulate at the bases of the cliffs and the gentle slopes that surround these rocky pinnacles.  \r Of particular interest to those who enjoy open air activities is the form of many of the exposed trees that can be found on desolate Dartmoor.  Because the prevailing winds meet little resistance on the high moor, many of the trees spend their entire existence exposed to strong south-westerlies which cause them to grow with a distinctive silhouette; the trees grow at an angle that makes it look as if they are all moving in the same direction.  On a dull and misty day this can look quite eerie. \n"}, {"text": "Each year since 1960, many thousands of young people have been attracted to Dartmoor for the purposes of participating in 'The Ten Tors'.  What is, or are, the Ten Tors?", "correct": "A hiking challenge.", "options": ["A music festival.", "A local version of the Olympic Games.", "A sitting of the national youth parliament."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA hiking challenge.\n\n\tThe Ten Tors Challenge is the only event of its nature in Britain that is aimed solely at young people. It was first held in its current format during September 1960; prior to this it had been an exercise restricted to members of the armed services.  The event usually takes place annually over the second weekend in May and is organised and administered by the British Army ably assisted by the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and the voluntary Dartmoor Rescue Group.  Entry is open to teams of up to six young people, boys and girls, aged between 14 and 19 from any school, youth group or service cadet unit located within the seven counties that form the south-west of England. Total numbers however, are limited to just 2,400 individuals.  Three hiking distances, 35, 45 or 55 miles, are available for teams to cover during which they are expected to visit ten different tors nominated by the organisers.  The event always attracts a lot of interest from the press, especially during those years when the Dartmoor weather deteriorates and becomes hostile, often resulting in many of the young hikers being evacuated for their own safety. \n"}, {"text": "Approximately thirty-two thousand acres of Dartmoor's total land area has been set aside for a specific purpose.  Which department of the UK government holds stewardship over this land?", "correct": "Ministry of Defence", "options": ["Department of Energy and Climate Change", "Department for Transport", "Department for International Development"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinistry of Defence.\n\n\tThe extent of Dartmoor that falls under the stewardship of the Ministry of Defence (the MoD) comprises one of the United Kingdom's largest military training areas.  Whenever any form of training or live firing is in progress the range boundaries will be clearly marked by red flags; those considering walking on Dartmoor should always consult the local press in which the dates and times that the ranges will be in use are clearly published.  There have been occasions in recent years where foolish walkers have been found wandering dangerously close to range impact areas. \n"}, {"text": "For many years Dartmoor Prison was renowned for housing some highly dangerous convicts due to its remote location.  However, the prison was originally built during the early 19th century to accommodate survivors from the ill-fated Spanish Armada.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tPrincetown (home of Dartmoor Prison) is located at the bleakest and most barren area of the moor.  The village was founded by Thomas Tyrwhitt, the Lord Warden of the Stannaries in around 1806 with the intention of attracting people to this desolate area of the moor.  The site for the prison on Dartmoor was selected specifically for its remote and forbidding location and was originally intended to house French and allied prisoners of the Napoleonic Wars. \n"}, {"text": "During the Great Thunderstorm of 1638, the Dartmoor village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor was  reputedly visited by whom?", "correct": "The Devil", "options": ["Saint Francis of Assisi", "King Charles I", "The Archangel Gabriel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Devil.\n\n\tLegend has it that it was the Devil who visited the church at Widecombe-in-the-Moor, although modern interpretations of eye-witness accounts believe that the church may have been struck by ball lightning; a natural phenomenon believed to be so rare that a visit from Satan himself would be more likely!  Sadly, a number of villagers at prayer were killed or injured by whatever it was that struck the church on that fateful night.\r A devil of one form or another appears in a great number of myths and legends from this area of England.  In a tale reminiscent of that of Doctor Faustus, the devil called in at Widecombe to claim the soul of a gambler.  Finding his victim plying his trade in a back room of the church, the demon snatched him and fled.  However, the Devil had tied his horse to the church tower and as he rode away the horse pulled the church tower over.  On the way to hell the gambler dropped four playing cards, four aces, and these cards can still be seen today in the form of four fields one each in the shape of a heart, a club, a diamond and a spade near the Warren House Inn on the road between Princetown and Moretonhampstead. \n"}]}
