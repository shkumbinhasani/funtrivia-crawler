{"id": "78477", "name": "Modern Thai History Quiz | Asian | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "       Asian", " Thailand"], "questions": [{"text": "This, perhaps, will be an easy one to start. Which European country officially annexed Thailand?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["France", "England", "Holland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tThe Thai people are rather proud of the fact that they avoided annexation in the colonial era, and in fact throughout their history have never been officially occupied, although the Burmese did once reduce their capital at Ayudhya. \n"}, {"text": "Influenced by the Meiji restoration in Japan, and following in his father King Mongkut's footsteps in continuing economic and political reforms in Thailand, which Thai king abolished slavery and established a modern civil service in Thailand?", "correct": "Chulalongkorn", "options": ["Moulmein", "Taksin", "Naungdawgyi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChulalongkorn.\n\n\tKing Chulalongkorn (Rama V), the 5th king of the Chakri dynasty, also attempted to modernize Thailand's legal and administrative structures. In order to allieve the ethnic Chinese 'problem', he forced ethnic Chinese to take Thai family names. His reign, which lasted from 1868 to 1910, saw Thailand become an entirely different, and modern, country. \n"}, {"text": "King Vajiravudh (Rama VI), who ascended the Thai throne in 1910, along with being a modern reformer who continued the changes that were started by Mongkut, also was a figure of great controversy. Which of the following was not an item of controversy that emerged from his relatively short reign?", "correct": "The placing of all kingly responsibility into the hands of a young general named Heshen", "options": ["Implied homosexual activities", "The essay 'The Jews of the East' about Chinese", "A private army called the 'Wild Tiger Corps'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe placing of all kingly responsibility into the hands of a young general named Heshen.\n\n\tVajiravudh reigned from 1910-1925. He presided over a court of controversy, yes, but also a court of intellectual activity spurred by his education at Oxford. His work called 'The Jews of the East' brought the issue of the overseas Chinese in Thailand to the fore and the existence of his Wild Tiger Corps, a private army, antagonized the regular Thai army. Government debt, as a result of his greatly inflated royal expenditure, also characterized his reign. \n"}, {"text": "Following Vajiravudh's 15 year reign, his half-brother Prajadhipok (Rama VII) came to power. Prajadhipok proved unable to deal effectively with economic and political problems that plagued Thailand as a result of its budget deficit and the world depression that hit Thailand in the early 1930s. While on vacation in June of 1932, a military junta launched a coup which put Prajadhipok out of power and ended the 150 year reign of the royal dynasty of the Rama Kings. What was this dynasty called?", "correct": "Chakri", "options": ["Toungoo", "Lan Xang", "Ayudhya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChakri.\n\n\tAlthough the dynasty fell, the line of Rama kings actually continues (with a different bloodline) with Rama IX in power in the year 2000. \n"}, {"text": "The key politician of the next two decades (1932-1957) was a lieutenant colonel who ended an attempted rebellion of the former royal family in 1933 and first involved the military as a key force of politics in Thailand, who was he?", "correct": "Phibun", "options": ["Sarit", "Taksin", "Nakhon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhibun.\n\n\tPhibun's career was quite interesting. Not only did he initiate military involvement in Thai politics (a major influence up to the present) but he also allied himself to Japan during WWII, flirted with fascism, followed the American political model post-WWII, was rescued after a coup attempt in Bangkok by the American navy (he was on the Thai naval flagship the Sri Ayudhya when it was attacked and capsized, he swam to safety on board an American naval vessel) and was finally ejected from Thai politics by his self-selected successor Sarit. \n"}, {"text": "Which country was responsible for bringing Thailand into World War II?", "correct": "Japan", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\tJapan invaded Thailand in December of 1941, but instead of occupying the country, General Phibun signed a military pact with the Japanese in which Japan was allowed to station troops for attacks on Indochina and Burma. This would very much hurt Phibun's post WWII reputation. \n"}, {"text": "In the late 1960s, Thailand held a major position in global politics due to its close geographic proximity to Vietnam and the conflict occurring in Indochina. On which side did Thailand fall during this conflict, American (South Vietnamese) or Soviet (North Vietnamese)?", "correct": "American & South Vietnamese & America", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican & South Vietnamese & America.\n\n\tThailand was a major recipient of American military assistance during the 1960s and involved itself in the conflict most particularly in Laos and later, Cambodia. \n"}, {"text": "The 1970s were a time of political instability in Thailand with political protests and peaceful demonstations on the streets and college campuses. All of this culminated in a massacre of students that occurred at which major university in Bangkok in 1976?", "correct": "Thammasat", "options": ["Burapha", "Mahidol", "Nonthaburi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThammasat.\n\n\tThammasat is the Berkeley of Thailand, and on October 6, 1976 the Berkeley of Thailand became a place of pain when 300 protesting students were killed by the military. \n"}, {"text": "In 1992, the era of military rule in Thailand came to an end as this General stepped down, allowing new elections to take place.", "correct": "General Suchinda Kraprayoon", "options": ["General Prem Tinsulanonda", "General Boonyoung Bucha", "General Sarit Thanarat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneral Suchinda Kraprayoon.\n\n\tMore political protests characterized the era of the early 1990s, and King Bhumibol stepped in to support these protests, legitimizing them to a degree. General Suchinda decided to step down in that year and a new Constitution was promulgated. The new government of Chuan Leekpai was put into government following relatively free elections...an era of free government could now begin. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: The Asian financial crisis that plagued a number of countries throughout east Asia never heavily effected the Thai economy.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe financial crisis actually began in Thailand, as currency speculators succeeded in devaluing the Thai Baht. Unfortunately, the heretofor booming Thai economy quickly crumbled as it was found that economic corruption, bad debt and crony-capitalism was rampant throughout the country. Fortunately, with the new era of good government in existence, the country has been able to weather the storm, but not after the suffering of many Thai people. Only time will tell if the government can reform fully the economic system. \n"}]}
