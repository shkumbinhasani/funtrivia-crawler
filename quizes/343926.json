{"id": "343926", "name": "Dungeons of \"Skyward Sword\" Online Trivia | Zelda Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Skyward Sword"], "questions": [{"text": "The very first mini-dungeon of the game is in Skyloft.  Why do you enter the Waterfall Cavern?", "correct": "To search for your Loftwing", "options": ["To locate Zelda's missing pet", "To find bugs", "To complete the Wing Ceremony ritual"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo search for your Loftwing.\n\n\tSomewhat of a starter dungeon, Link must visit the one-room Waterfall Cavern in Skyloft in order to locate his Crimson Loftwing.  In order to access this area in Skyloft, Link must first obtain the Practice Sword, a blade found at the Knight Academy's Sparring Hall (in the back room).  On the other side of the Waterfall Cavern you'll find your Loftwing and you can free him from a makeshift prison.  The only enemies in the cave are Keese and Chuchus, so it shouldn't be too strenuous, even for a newer player. \n"}, {"text": "Skyview Temple is the first major dungeon and it's located in Faron Woods.  This is the first location at which you battle The Imprisoned.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSkyview Temple is a spot located on the far end of Faron Woods and you'll need to get past several enemy Bokoblin forces (and help the Kikwis) to get there.  Inside you'll come face to face with Skulltulas for the first time and snag the Beetle, an item which can be piloted and flown around a room using the Wii Remote to grab items, flick switches, etc. At the end of Skyview Temple, Link will need to fight one of the game's main antagonists for the first time.  The Demon Lord Ghirahim will be a tough battle for the first-timer; he'll actually take your sword out of your hands if you don't have battle techniques up to par. If you can weaken this enemy enough, you'll be able to emerge into Skyview Spring and claim the second Ancient Tablet piece. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these features can be found in the Earth Temple?", "correct": "Lava pits", "options": ["Falling stalactites", "Movable stone golems", "Clawshot targets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLava pits.\n\n\tThe Earth Temple is the second major temple of the game.  Found high up in Eldin Volcano, Link will need to brave fierce heats and lava pits to progress.  By this point, of course, Link will have the Beetle and the Digging Mitts from the friendly, local Mogmas and he'll have found the five pieces of the Temple Key to open the front door. Inside the Earth Temple, Link will gain possession of a Bomb Bag (courtesy of a treasure-seeking Mogma), he'll fight Lizalfos for the first time, and he'll come face-to-face with Scaldera, the final boss who has a tendency to roll uphill as a large, molten ball of painful rocks and lava. Completion of this temple will bring you one step closer to Zelda and will result in the third and final piece of the Ancient Tablet. \n"}, {"text": "The dungeon containing the Gust Bellows is in the Lanayru Desert.  Which of the following structures contains this dungeon?", "correct": "A mining facility", "options": ["A fort", "A church", "A reservoir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA mining facility.\n\n\tThe Lanayru Mining Facility was used by a race of productive robots at one point but has since sunk under the sands after many years.  Using Timeshift Stones you can return small portions of the barren desert back into its verdant self (for a short time) and restore the Mining Facility's power by accessing three generator switches. When it rises from the sands, the Mining Facility becomes the third dungeon, a sprawling, expansive building containing electrical creatures such as Beamos and Sentrobes.  This dungeon will introduce Link to the Gust Bellows, a jar which can create gusts of wind.  The final boss will be a 'Thousand-Year Arachnid' known as Moldarach and after defeating it in battle you'll visit the Temple of Time to confront Ghirahim and receive the Goddess' Harp from Zelda before she is whisked away to another realm. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the dungeon found behind the waterfall at Lake Floria?", "correct": "Ancient Cistern & The Ancient Cistern", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAncient Cistern & The Ancient Cistern.\n\n\tAfter Link returns to Faron Woods and claims the Water Dragon's Scale from the Silent Realm he'll be able to explore a whole new area of the forest-- Lake Floria, where he'll meet an underwater species known as the Parellas and the Water Dragon herself.  After a brief stop at the shrine behind Skyview Temple you'll be granted access to the Ancient Cistern, a water-themed temple which requires that Link swim and search for a new weapon, the Whip, before ascending to the top of the temple to fight Koloktos, a gold statue with six arms, six swords, and the tendency to swing all of these at you. Completing this dungeon, Link will imbue his sword with the power of Farore's Flame, upgrading his weapon to the Goddess' Longsword. \n"}, {"text": "What boss is fought near the end of Link's trip aboard the Sandship?", "correct": "Tentalus", "options": ["Scervo", "Gyorg", "Morpha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTentalus.\n\n\tThe Sandship is an invisible vessel floating upon the Lanayru Sand Sea and after a lengthy search for this massive watercraft, Link will stumble upon it with a few well-placed cannon shots, revealing it and allowing him to climb aboard.  After obtaining the Bow from Scervo, the mini-boss of the stage, he'll be able to flip back and forth in time using a Timeshift Stone on the mast.  At the end of the dungeon, he'll fight Tentalus, a large, tentacled creature from the depths, and ultimately he'll upgrade his sword using Naryu's Flame. \n"}, {"text": "In the Fire Sanctuary, Link receives which of the following items?", "correct": "Mogma Mitts", "options": ["Fireshield Earrings", "Clawshots", "Bow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMogma Mitts.\n\n\tThe Fire Sanctuary, the game's sixth major dungeon, is found in Eldin Volcano and can only be accessed if Link wears the Fireshield Earrings obtained after completion of the third Silent Realm trial.  Making his way into this dungeon, Link will need to use water seeds to create platforms over molten lava, fight off armies of Bokoblins, and save some helpless Mogmas tied up against their will. One of these Mogmas will give Link the Mogma Mitts, an upgrade for the Digging Mitts from earlier in the game, and these will allow him to dig into holes underground.  These mitts are not used for the boss fight, a battle against Ghirahim (once again).  After the dungeon, Link will imbue his sword with Din's Fire and finally be in possession of the Master Sword. \n"}, {"text": "Although this isn't a dungeon per se, this offshoot of Faron Woods contains boss battles and a large open pit.  Where does Link fight The Imprisoned?", "correct": "Sealed Grounds", "options": ["The Thunderhead", "Lake Floria", "The Lumpy Pumpkin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSealed Grounds.\n\n\tThe Sealed Grounds, though the first place Link reaches on his visits to the surface, is a large, open area descending deep into the ground.  Containing an Imprisoned gargantuan creature, Link returns here on several occasions to battle evil incarnate before it can reach the nearby temple.  After finishing the Fire Sanctuary, a second battle is held when Link tries to open the Gate of Time with his new Master Sword.  It is then that he learns that Princess Zelda has been sealed away inside for centuries, waiting for the Hero of Time to save her and prevent evil from taking over. \n"}, {"text": "The final Silent Realm Trial Gate is found in which part of the game?", "correct": "Skyloft", "options": ["Isle of Songs", "The Sealed Grounds", "Lanayru Desert"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkyloft.\n\n\tWhen Link has all three parts of the Song of Heroes he can return to Skyloft and begin the hunt for a final Silent Realm trial near the tallest tower.  This will be a difficult task in which Link will need to claim several tears from precarious places all over the town.  At the end of the trial, Link will receive an emblem which must be used to access the final dungeon: the Sky Keep.  This dungeon is also in Skyloft, but it's hidden from view.  When you place the emblem onto a statue near the waterfall, all the pieces will fall into place. \n"}, {"text": "In the Sky Keep, Link can shift the rooms of the dungeon around from control panels.  If he is in any of the rooms, how many of the other ones can be moved?", "correct": "Seven", "options": ["Ten", "Eight", "Nine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven.\n\n\tThe Sky Keep contains eight large rooms and if you're in one of them, the seven remaining rooms can be shifted.  Some of these, however, may not move around too well-- in order to go into the rooms you'll need to line up the doors.  Three of eight rooms will contain access to a piece of the Triforce and one will contain a Small Key.  You will likely need to go through every room at least once. As soon as the third Triforce piece is claimed, Link will be transported onto the statue of the Goddess outside and the entire temple section of Skyloft will descend into the clouds, landing into the pit in the Sealed Grounds. There are no more dungeons after this; it all comes downs to battles with some of the most difficult bosses. \n"}]}
