In modern times, the festival is garish, loud, and celebratory, with much of its aesthetic being known the world over.  The ceremony is usually held during the first two days of November to worship friends and family who have passed.  The event has since been placed on the UNESCO list for Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. \n"}, {"text": "What Christian holiday allegedly originating in the sixth century is meant to reflect upon those trapped in Purgatory?", "correct": "All Souls' Day", "options": ["All Saints' Day", "All Hallows Eve", "Arbor Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll Souls' Day.\n\n\tCelebrated mostly during the same time span as D\u00eda de los Muertos, All Souls Day is meant to follow All Saints Day on November the 1st in Christian nations.  In most religions, this day is held aside for prayer or cemetery visits, though many modern observers are unlikely to make the funereal pilgrimage.  Records show that although the day has been around for longer, it was popularized in the eleventh century in the French Middle Ages.  As with many similar holidays commemorating the dead, this one comes after Halloween and typically, harvest season. \n"}, {"text": "Tomb-Sweeping Day, or Qingming, is celebrated in mid-April in what Asian nation?", "correct": "China", "options": ["Japan", "Thailand", "The Philippines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChina.\n\n\tA memorial day to respect Chinese ancestry, Tomb-Sweeping Day couldn't be a better distillation of the activities expected on this day every year, usually at the start of April (varying based on the Spring Equinox).  In addition to visiting the graves of their ancestors, observers also bring respectful offerings.  This holiday has been observed for two and a half millennia and, for most of that, it's also been preceded by the Cold Food Festival, a three day observance that also has ties to the dead. \n"}, {"text": "To Buddhists, the seventh month of the Chinese calendar is often referred to by which of these names?", "correct": "Ghost Month", "options": ["Death Month", "The Final Month", "Devil's Month"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGhost Month.\n\n\tGhost Month is celebrated by both Buddhist and Taoists observers in China and though the entire seventh lunar month on the Chinese calendar is set aside as a time when the realms of Heaven and Hell both open to let the dead return to the mortal plane.  The 15th, in particular, is a date of great importance because it's the day of the Ghost Festival, during which citizens perform small rituals and celebrate their deceased friends, relatives, and countrymen. This day on the calendar is also always a full moon.  The Ghost Festival is so old that no official date of origination is known; it was likely started before written records. Bring food; these ghosts are hungry! \n"}, {"text": "The Bon Festival would likely be celebrated in which city?", "correct": "Osaka", "options": ["Paris", "Lima", "Berlin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOsaka.\n\n\tSimilar to the Ghost Festival and also celebrated by Buddhists, the Bon (or Obon) Festival is a Japanese variant of its Chinese counterpart, also typically celebrated on the seventh lunar month (though this varies depending on region).  The Bon Festival is often a joyous celebration despite the risk of hungry ghosts and in some cities, large festivals (complete with rides) are held to allow all to join in.  This time of year is also the perfect occasion to watch the Bon Odori, a regional dance designed to appeal to the spirits. \n"}, {"text": "The name Pitru Paksha, a Hindu celebration, translates to 'fortnight of the ancestors'.

Celebrated in India and Nepal, this is yet another ceremony devoted to ancestor worship and offerings, especially food, to be given to those between realms.

Pitru Paksha always follows Ganesha Day. \n"}, {"text": "Radonitsa is the custom of dining with the departed often, in history, by their graves in which country?", "correct": "Russia", "options": ["Nepal", "Greece", "Turkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRussia.\n\n\tRadonitsa is a custom held by the Russian Orthodox Church and although much of it surrounds dining with those who have died and commemorating their departure, modern observers take a much more casual approach to the day.  Tied to the holy week in April, Radonitsa is derived from Christian customs meant to reflect on Jesus' resurrection and it's because of this that Easter eggs also tend to factor into the traditions held for this occasion.  The name 'Radonitsa' translates to 'day of rejoicing'. \n"}, {"text": "The Korean custom of Chuseok is meant to worship the dead and celebrate which of these?", "correct": "Harvest", "options": ["Springtime", "Solar eclipses", "The sea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarvest.\n\n\tThe name 'Chuseok' translates to 'autumn eve', which makes sense since the event is, essentially, a harvest festival held in either September or October based on the lunar calendar.  While many stay at home to observe this event on their own, it's not uncommon for citizens to travel to the graves of their ancestors to gather and pay tribute.

Similarly, the February festival of Feralia was part of another event used to honour the dead in Ancient Rome, Parentalia. \n"}, {"text": "In Madagascar, Famadihana is a tradition known by what other name?", "correct": "The Turning of the Bones", "options": ["The Dredging of the Bodies", "The Sealing of the Tombs", "The Remembrance of the Fallen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Turning of the Bones.\n\n\tFor centuries, the Malagasy people of Madagascar have engaged in a ritual which, although it doesn't have a set date, is observed consistently to respect those who had recently died.

Families gather once every five to seven years to perform this rite, unsealing and resealing tombs to redress the body, until it's fully decomposed and, thus, moved on to its rightful place on the other side. \n"}]}
