What does the 'C' in 'SCMODS' stand for?", "correct": "County", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCounty.\n\n\tElwood: 'They probably got SCMODS.' Jake: 'SCMODS?' Elwood: 'State County Municipal Offender Data System.' \n"}, {"text": "The Blues brothers lead a number of police cars through a merry chase in a shopping mall. Which of the following establishments does the Bluesmobile NOT damage during this chase?", "correct": "Pier 1 Imports", "options": ["JC Penney", "an Oldsmobile dealership", "Gingiss Formalwear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPier 1 Imports.\n\n\tThe boys plow through a number of storefronts, but Pier 1 Imports is not one of them: Elwood points out the store to Jake in passing, but they never do any damage to it. \n"}, {"text": "The first time Camille (Carrie Fisher) tries to kill Jake, what song is playing in the background?", "correct": "'Theme From Peter Gunn'", "options": ["'She Caught the Katy'", "'Think'", "'Sweet Home Chicago'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Theme From Peter Gunn'.\n\n\tThe 'Peter Gunn' theme plays as Camille fires a rocket at Jake and Elwood.

What was it?", "correct": "Cheez Whiz", "options": ["beef jerky", "Twinkies", "Oreos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheez Whiz.\n\n\tHe asks, 'You get me my Cheez Whiz, boy?' Elwood wordlessly produces a can of Cheez Whiz from his jacket and tosses it to the old man. Weird. \n"}, {"text": "When Elwood informs Lloyd (the hotel manager, it would seem) that Jake will be staying with him for a couple of weeks, Lloyd is rather distracted by a sporting event that he's watching on a small television. What sport is Lloyd watching?", "correct": "wrestling", "options": ["hockey", "basketball", "football"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwrestling.\n\n\tIt's too small an image for me to tell which fighters he's watching.

We never see her using a hand grenade in the film. \n"}, {"text": "After Jake comes up with the idea to reunite the band, which band member or members do the boys try to find first?", "correct": "Tommy 'Bones' Malone and 'Blue' Lou Marini", "options": ["Mr. Fabulous", "Matt 'Guitar' Murphy'", "Murphy Dunne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTommy 'Bones' Malone and 'Blue' Lou Marini.\n\n\tThe first stop the boys make is the former residence of Tommy 'Bones' Malone and 'Blue' Lou Marini. \n"}, {"text": "At one point, Jake and Elwood question a woman who was once the landlady of one or more members of the old Blues Brothers Band.

What's the song?", "correct": "'Cuando, Cuando, Cuando'", "options": ["'Tequila'", "'La Bamba'", "'Guantanamera'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Cuando, Cuando, Cuando'.\n\n\tGotta love that Holiday Inn lounge music. \n"}, {"text": "It's revealed during a conversation with the Magic Tones that Jake went to prison for armed robbery. In his defense, though, he only performed that crime to make up for money lost when the Blues Brothers Band played a 'Kiwanis gig.'
