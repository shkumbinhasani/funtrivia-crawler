{"id": "169203", "name": "'Dances with Wolves', Part 4 Trivia Game | Dances with Wolves . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Dances with Wolves"], "questions": [{"text": "Lieutenant Dunbar is given a buffalo hide by Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair, a gift for which he is very appreciative.  He is also invited once again to visit the Sioux encampment.  Dunbar is surprised to discover that a member of the tribe speaks English, the young Caucasian woman that he had earlier saved.  What are the first words spoken by this woman, called 'Stands With a Fist'?", "correct": "Hello, you here good.", "options": ["He is Kick Bird.", "What your name is?", "The soldier fort..."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHello, you here good.\n\n\tStands With a Fist struggles with her first English words; she hasn't spoken the language in over twenty years, after all.  She is able to speak at a rudimentary level with Dunbar, stuttering her words but pronouncing them well.  Mary McDonnell does a wonderful job in her role as Stands With a Fist, I must say. \n"}, {"text": "Dunbar acknowledges that having an interpreter is a breakthrough in relations with 'these wild people of the Plains', but he still hasn't received the trust of the entire community.  What event makes the Lieutenant a 'celebrity' in the village?", "correct": "He announces that the buffalo have come", "options": ["He provides the village with guns", "He gives the villagers access to his entire supply of food", "He helps fend off an attack by the nearby Pawnee tribe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe announces that the buffalo have come.\n\n\tIn his cabin at Ft. Sedgwick, Dunbar suddenly feels the ground shaking.  He immediately ascertains that this earthquake is occurring thanks to a massive buffalo herd passing nearby.  He feels obliged to immediately inform his new friends while they are engaged in a ceremony.  Screaming madly that the buffalo (tatanka) have arrived, he is accosted by several Sioux warriors in full face paint.  After being roughed up a bit, Kicking Bird elicits Dunbar's message and the entire crowd erupts in a celebratory ruckus. \n"}, {"text": "Dunbar joins the tribe on a genuine buffalo hunt.  Before they encounter the main herd, the Lieutenant, along with the Sioux tribe members, witnesses a field of carcasses left behind by some fur traders.  According to Dunbar, along with the hides, what is the only other body part taken by the fur traders?", "correct": "Tongues", "options": ["Hearts", "Horns", "Hooves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTongues.\n\n\t'Who would do such a thing?' asks Dunbar.  He answers, 'The field was proof enough that it was a people without value and without soul; with no regard for Sioux rights.  The wagon tracks leading away left little doubt, and my heart sank as I knew it could only be white hunters.'  Dunbar later suggests that the buffalo were 'killed only for their tongues and the price of their hides.' \n"}, {"text": "Later, the main buffalo herd is located by a group of Sioux warriors and Lieutenant Dunbar is invited to come along to view this massive herd.  What device does Dunbar produce that fascinates his friend Kicking Bird?", "correct": "Telescope", "options": ["Camera", "Theodolite", "Binoculars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelescope.\n\n\tAfter taking a peek through the telescope, Kicking Bird has to move it away, checking the distance between himself and the buffalo herd.  Dunbar then allows him to continue viewing the buffalo through the telescope, much to his friend's delight. \n"}, {"text": "The following day, the actual hunting begins.  Do the Sioux allow Dunbar to use his gun during the hunt?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed they do, and a good thing too.  Dunbar takes down no fewer than four buffalo with his gun during the hunt, including one shown charging at the youthful Smiles a Lot.  Incidentally, according to the trivia section of 'Dances with Wolves' at IMDB.com regarding that charging scene...apparently the buffalo was charging at a plate of Oreo Cookies, its favorite meal! \n"}, {"text": "Following the buffalo hunt, the tribe celebrates with a feast.  Dunbar notices during the festivities that a member of the tribe is wearing an item from his wardrobe that he had previously lost.  What item of Dunbar's clothing has this man claimed as his own?", "correct": "Hat", "options": ["Boot", "Jacket", "Vest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHat.\n\n\tDunbar trades his jacket with Wind In His Hair, who provides the Lieutenant with a ceremonial item of chestwear.  This 'good trade' signifies that they have become good friends.  The Lieutenant apparently does not feel the same closeness to the gentleman who has claimed his hat, and insists that it be returned to him.  Eventually, through Wind In His Hair's moderation, Dunbar accepts another trade, this time for a knife. \n"}, {"text": "Following the buffalo hunt, Dunbar decides to make permanent lodgings with the Sioux tribe that he has befriended.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDespite his newfound relationship with his neighbors, Dunbar still insists on maintaining his post at Fort Sedgwick.  His comments as the Sioux drop him off at the fort include the following: 'Many times I've felt alone, but until this afternoon, I'd never felt completely lonely.' \n"}, {"text": "Dunbar feels that he has become very close with his Sioux tribal neighbors, but there are still some limitations in the relationship between the Lieutenant and his new friends.  The Lieutenant wants to prove his loyalty to the Sioux by joining their war party against the Pawnee.  Does Kicking Bird allow Dunbar to join the war party that will ride against the Pawnee enemy?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tKicking Bird insists that only Sioux warriors may fight in battle against the enemy.  Further, Kicking Bird feels concerned about the women and children that will be left behind and he requests that Dunbar remain behind to watch over his family, to which Dunbar finally acquiesces.  In this exchange, Dunbar first learns that he is being called 'Dances With Wolves' among the tribe members. \n"}, {"text": "How does the oft-heard (at least in this film) Sioux name 'Shumani Tutonka Ob Wachi' translate into English?", "correct": "Dances with Wolves", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDances with Wolves.\n\n\tThis will be Dunbar's Lakota Sioux name throughout the rest of the film.  He attains his name when Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair witness the Lieutenant frolicking on the plain with Two Socks (the wolf). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these members of the tribe actually goes along with the war party against the Pawnee?", "correct": "Kicking Bird", "options": ["Stone Calf", "Ten Bears", "Smiles a Lot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKicking Bird.\n\n\tTen Bears and Stone Calf are considered too old to fight in a war party, while Smiles a Lot is far too young yet.  Kicking Bird is an able-bodied male of middling age, and hence, despite his position as a holy man, is required to join in the battle.  To see how the battle turns out, you'll have to check out quiz number five in this series!  Thank you for playing this quiz.
