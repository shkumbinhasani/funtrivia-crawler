Hunter formerly played for eleven seasons on what team?", "correct": "Minnesota Twins", "options": ["Toronto Blue Jays", "New York Yankees", "Chicago White Sox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinnesota Twins.\n\n\tTorii Hunter was an 11-season Minnesota Twin before joining the Angels for the 2008 season; he was in Minnesota from 1997 through 2007 (and he would rejoin the roster in 2015 for one final season). He won many Gold Gloves for his outfield presence.\r The Angels were the first team in 2008 to clinch a playoff berth.  Mike Scioscia took over the Angels in 2000, then won the franchise's first World Series in 2002.  Along with Torii Hunter, their 2008 success was aided by Vladimir Guerrero and Francisco Rodriguez, who pitched his way to more than 60 saves in the season.  Scioscia was, then, in his eighth season at the helm of the Angels. \n"}, {"text": "Hitting 500 home runs in a career is a major milestone that few reach.  The first player in history to hit 500 was the immortal Babe Ruth.  Who of these did not reach this milestone?", "correct": "Lou Gehrig", "options": ["Jimmie Foxx", "Mel Ott", "Hank Aaron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLou Gehrig.\n\n\tJimmie Foxx was next (after Babe Ruth), following suit in 1940.  Other greats to hit 500+ included Mel Ott, Ted Williams, Ernie Banks, Eddie Mathews, and Hank Aaron.\r Lou Gehrig, despite not reaching this number, was well-documented for his consecutive game-playing streak until Cal Ripken Jr. broke it.  Lou hit 493 home runs, just shy of the milestone given, and only because his career was shortened by disease.  He was still strong in his 15th season in 1937, then slowly began to deteriorate; he played in only eight games in 1939 before stepping down.  He died two years later at the age of 37 of ALS, an affliction that would later be known, informally, as Lou Gehrig's Disease. \n"}, {"text": "Walter Alston managed the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers from 1954-1976, helming the Dodgers to seven World Series appearances (and winning several).  What was his nickname, one he shared with famous pitcher Joe Williams?", "correct": "Smokey", "options": ["Cyclone", "King", "Three-Finger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmokey.\n\n\tAlston was replaced by Tom Lasorda with four games left in the 1976 season due to illness and Lasorda took the Dodgers to two further World Series in 1977 and 1978... but lost them both.\r The Dodgers won their first World Series title in 1955.  They won again in 1959 against the White Sox, in 1963 against the Yankees, and in 1965 over the Minnesota Twins. As a player, Alston saw only one game in his career in 1936 with the Cardinals.  He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1983, then died a year later. \n"}, {"text": "Steve Carlton played most of his career with the Cardinals and Phillies and won four Cy Young awards for Philadelphia.  What position did he play?", "correct": "Pitcher", "options": ["Catcher", "First Baseman", "Shortstop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPitcher.\n\n\tThe Cy Young Award is given, annually, to the pitcher in each MLB league as voted upon by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.  Carlton won in 1972, 1977, 1980, and 1982 and became the first player to receive three in his career (let alone four).\r His career was fairly illustrious.  After seven seasons in St. Louis, he was traded to the Phillies in 1972 and went 27-10.  He also threw a Triple Crown in 1972.  1973 saw him go 13-20.  Carlton retired as a Twin in 1988 after twenty-four seasons and the Hall of Fame inducted him in 1994.\r Steve's career record was 329-244 along with 4136 strikeouts.  He retired as number two for career strikeouts behind the great Nolan Ryan.  He had since been surpassed in that department. \n"}, {"text": "Rafael Palmeiro played for 20 seasons, mostly with the Texas Rangers and Baltimore Orioles.

In 1989, Rafael found himself playing for the Rangers until 1994 when he became an Oriole.  His season high for home runs was 47, which he hit twice in 1999 and 2001, but still never led the league.  He ended up being the runner-up for highest RBI in 1999 (to Manny Ramirez).\r Although hitting over 500 home runs in his career, he never hit 50 in a season or led the league in home runs.  Near the end of his career, he was investigated for illegal substance usage in baseball.  He retired in 2005. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Giants win the pennant!  The Giants win the pennant!\"  Those sounds still echo for true-blue Dodger fans from the 1951 playoff for the National League title.  Who hit \"shot heard round the world\" to clinch the game?", "correct": "Bobby Thomson", "options": ["Henry Aaron", "Sandy Koufax", "Don Larsen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBobby Thomson.\n\n\tRuss Hodges' words announcing the winners of the pennant came immediately after a Bobby Thomson home run to end the game, the NL playoffs, and the Dodgers' hopes.  The Giants went on to the World Series right after, but lost to the Yankees four games to two.\r Thomson hit his season high of 32 home runs in 1951, but none bigger than that three-run shot off Dodger pitcher Ralph Branca.  Bobby played with the Giants until February 1954 when they traded him to the Milwaukee Braves.  Thomson was injured in the early part of the season with the Braves, and he was replaced by some rookie named Henry Aaron. \n"}, {"text": "The first Major League World Series was held in 1903.

Of those four, how many times did they win?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tIn the early days of the Cubs, they were managed by Frank Chance from 1905-1912 who took the team to four World Series while winning two (in 1907 and 1908, both times against the Detroit Tigers).  By 1945, the team would make six more appearances but could not walk away with the crown.  After that, for the next 55 years watching the close of the century, the team would not see the promised land again, and would only go to three NLCS postseasons.  In the 21st century, they would go on to win the World Series again in 2016.\r The first World Series in 1903 pitted the Boston Americans against the NL Pittsburgh Pirates.  The Americans won it five games to three. \n"}, {"text": "Stan Musial played for 22 seasons, winning three MVP awards and ending up in the top-ten MVP voting an amazing 14 times.

What team did he play on for his entire career?", "correct": "St. Louis Cardinals", "options": ["Atlanta Braves", "Boston Red Sox", "New York Mets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n\n\tThe Most Valuable Player Award is one of those personal materialistic items that nobody can take away.  It shows the world that you were indeed the most valuable player in baseball for a season.  Winning it multiple times is a true indication of one's greatness.\r From 1941-1963, 'Stan the Man's' number 6 was a landmark in St. Louis.  His three MVPs came in 1943, 1946, and 1948.  From 1943-1952, Stan was in the top-five for the MVP eight times.  He won seven batting titles, led the league in hits another six times, and runs five times.

The Rockies stepped all over the Phillies and Diamondbacks in the playoffs, only to be dominated by the Red Sox in the promised land.  It was Boston's second World Series crown in four seasons, and both their titles came by a skunking, four games to none. \n"}, {"text": "Some leagues have tried, some leagues have failed.  When the American League combined with the National League in 1901, it seemed to be a marriage that would last for decades.  In 1914, a third league tried to emerge as the third Major League of baseball.  What was its name?", "correct": "Federal League", "options": ["Peoples League", "Players League", "Diamond League"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFederal League.\n\n\tIt was all about money when some greedy ones attempted to begin a third league in 1914.  Huge contracts were being dished up for players to defect.  One pivotal player that came so close to going to the Federal League was Washington Senators' pitcher, Walter Johnson.  The American League and team owners gave Johnson many unheard of incentives of their own for him to stay.\r The Federal League lasted only two seasons even though offering some heavy contracts to players of the American and National League to defect.  The Indianapolis Hoosiers won the first league title in 1914, then the St. Louis Terriers won it in 1915. \n"}]}
