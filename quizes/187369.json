{"id": "187369", "name": "Basics of Political Science II Online Quiz | World | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", "Government", "Political Science & History"], "questions": [{"text": "Political legitimacy is an important aspect of every regime's rule.  Legitimacy refers to a particular regime's need to justify the propriety of its rule vis-\u00e0-vis its subjects.  Max Weber described three basic forms of legitimacy.  Which of the following was not a pattern by which a regime may attain legitimacy for its authority according to Weber?  ", "correct": "International norms", "options": ["Charismatic", "Traditional", "Rational-legal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInternational norms.\n\n\tIn Weber's view, there were three manners by which a regime may obtain its legitimacy.  The first, traditional legitimacy, rests on the notion that a regime rules because it has always ruled.  Monarchical dynasties (e.g. the Tudors or the Ptolemy Dynasty) acquire their legitimacy through the traditional form.  Charismatic legitimacy derives from the special attributes of an individual who is especially eloquent, imposing and persuasive in personality (or sometimes, even physical looks).  In this category falls Charles De Gaulle and Gandhi (and, unfortunately, some of history's worst dictators, for example Hitler or Mao Zedong).  The basis of rational-legal legitimacy lies in a highly institutionalized system of laws, wherein a leader is selected by a specific set of codified criteria.  Most leaders in today's various liberal democracies obtain their legitimacy through rational-legal means. \n"}, {"text": "A confederal system involves a great deal of autonomy for member states, including the right of secession.  Which of these nation-states claims to be a confederation? ", "correct": "Switzerland", "options": ["United States", "New Zealand", "Australia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwitzerland.\n\n\tSwitzerland calls itself the 'Swiss Confederation', as it is comprised of small states called cantons that are endowed with a certain level of sovereignty, and enjoy a high degree of autonomy in regards to decision making.  However, over time the power of the central government in Switzerland has grown, and it might be better to use the term 'federal' when describing the country.  The newly formed country of Serbia and Montenegro has chosen the confederal form of union, making it perhaps the only truly confederal system in the world as of 2004. \n"}, {"text": "Conflict can occur in many different forms within nation-states and societies across the globe.  One such example is conflict based on ethnicity.  In the mid-1990s an ethnic conflict between the Hutus and Tutsis occurred in which of these countries?  ", "correct": "Rwanda", "options": ["Bangladesh", "Indonesia", "Sierra Leone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRwanda.\n\n\tEthnicity refers to a special set of attributes, whether they be linguistic, religious or otherwise, that culturally differentiates a certain group of people from another.  In Rwanda, the Hutu and Tutsi groupings were initially categorized on the basis of occupational lifestyle, but eventually they developed into what could be considered ethnicities.  In 1994, tensions between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus led to a genocide that took half a million Tutsi lives in a rather brief period of time. \n"}, {"text": "Conflicts that are nationalist involve minority groups within nation-states that seek a sovereign nation separate from the nation-state within which they currently reside.  Which of these minority groups has sought an autonomous state within the boundaries of Spain?  ", "correct": "Basques", "options": ["Eritreans", "Tamils", "Chechens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBasques.\n\n\tCertain members of the Basque minority have long struggled for a sovereign state in the northeast region of Spain.  Like the Basques, the Eritreans also sought independence, and engaged in civil war against the Ethiopian government until achieving sovereignty in 1993.  The Chechens are a nationalist group within Russia, while the Tamils operate as a separatist group on Sri Lanka.  All of these groups use (or have used) ethnicity as a category by which they rationalize their independence movements. \n"}, {"text": "Typically, ethnic conflict only occurs in countries where there are substantial ethnic minority groups.  Which of these countries is not considered to be largely ethnically homogeneous?  ", "correct": "Fiji", "options": ["Somalia", "Iceland", "Japan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFiji.\n\n\tWhile Somalia, Japan and Iceland contain largely homogeneous populations, Fiji is almost evenly divided between native Polynesians and Indians (Asian).  Fiji's government has been fractured by the struggle between the native Fijians and the relatively late-coming Indians; the former have been trying to exclude the latter politically through various constitutional measures.  Japan and Iceland have largely avoided internecine conflict, while Somalia has suffered from a great deal of internal strife, largely clan-based in nature. \n"}, {"text": "One of the leading political ideologies of the past several centuries has been that of liberalism.  In short, liberalism promotes the ideas of maximum freedom of choice and minimal government involvement in the lives of citizens.  Which of these famous political theorists was a proponent of the liberal philosophy?  ", "correct": "Adam Smith", "options": ["Karl Marx", "Friedrich Nietzsche", "Mikhail Bakunin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdam Smith.\n\n\tAdam Smith was a famed Scottish philosopher and economic theoretician from the 18th century who promoted a brand of liberalism that included the concepts of the free market, individual gain and 'the invisible hand'.  Lesser known is Smith's concept of 'fellow feeling', which, in short, insisted that men who are active in the market must also make consideration for the well-being of their fellow human beings.  Smith considered the marketplace to be the milieu in which societal values were developed; the incubator of civil society, so to speak.  Thus, the traditional neo-classical economic view that Smith wholeheartedly would endorse the phrase 'greed is good', should be taken with a grain of salt. \n"}, {"text": "Social Democracy is another popular political ideology, one largely developed in the 20th century.  Which of these countries adopted social democracy as its chief political ideology in the latter part of the 20th century?  ", "correct": "Sweden", "options": ["Mexico", "Japan", "South Korea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSweden.\n\n\tThe term social democracy may be likened to socialism.  Within a social democracy the traditional liberal concepts of private property and markets are accepted, but with limits imposed by an active government.  Government regulations and high taxes in a social democratic system are meant to ensure that wealth is more evenly distributed within society.  Though some social democratic states such as Sweden and Denmark have achieved a high degree of economic and social progress, problems have arisen as a result of the cumbersome governmental presence in those countries, especially within the realm of taxation (which has risen to 50% or more of one's annual income in some of the social democratic countries). \n"}, {"text": "Communism was another of several popular ideologies that has been employed by governments in the 20th century.  In the late 1980s, early 1990s communism largely collapsed around the world.  Following the shedding of the communist ideology in the Soviet Union in 1991, which subsequently broke apart into its constituent republics, the government of which one of these countries continued to adhere to communist ideology?  \n", "correct": "North Korea", "options": ["Hungary", "Russia", "Poland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorth Korea.\n\n\tFollowing the dismemberment of the Soviet Union in 1991 only a few countries around the world continued to adhere to communist ideology, among them North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and China.  Even in the cases of China and Vietnam, economic reforms have rather enervated the essence of the brand of communist ideology practiced in those regimes, though a strict governmental authoritarianism has been maintained in both places. \n"}, {"text": "Theories abound regarding how the modern concept of the nation-state was developed (complete with the development of modern nationalism).  Which of these political theorists developed the concept of 'imagined communities' to explain the rise of modern nationalism?  ", "correct": "Benedict Anderson", "options": ["Robert Putnam", "Alexander Gerschenkron", "Jurgen Habermas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBenedict Anderson.\n\n\tBenedict Anderson's most famous book, a seminal work of modern political science written in 1983, is called 'Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism'.  In his work, Anderson describes how modern nation-states were established through the use of mass media to establish nationalistic fervor and an expansion of capitalist production, the two of which worked in tandem to create a sense of togetherness and belonging among otherwise rather disparate groups of people. \n"}, {"text": "Another theoretician who has taken part in the debate about the development of nationalism throughout the world is E. J. Hobsbawm.  Which of these phrases is associated with Hobsbawm's work?  ", "correct": "Invention of Tradition", "options": ["Melting Pot", "Multicultural Values", "Social Capital"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInvention of Tradition.\n\n\tHobsbawm co-wrote a book in 1983 (a very productive year, apparently!) with T. Ranger that was entitled 'The Invention of Tradition'.  Hobsbawm and Ranger take a very dark view of the development of nationalism, suggesting that it is an invention of the elites within each emerging nation-state.  National mythologies are developed to deceive the masses into working for the betterment of society, when in reality only the elites benefit from the painstaking labor of the masses.  Marx would approve!  Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and learned a thing or two. \n"}]}
