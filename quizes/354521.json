This Interstate number appears twice. There is this one which heads towards Salt Lake City, and another Interstate that goes from Scranton, Pennsylvania to Connecticut. Which double-identity highway is this one?", "correct": "Interstate 84", "options": ["Interstate 29", "Interstate 44", "Interstate 90"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInterstate 84.\n\n\tJust to confuse things more for tourists, there are two I-84s. There is this one, running from Portland to Echo, Utah (which is just outside Salt Lake City), and the Eastern I-84, which stretches from Scranton, Pennsylvania to Sturbridge, Massachusetts. The western highway is over 500 miles longer, and passes through cities like Boise, Idaho, and  Ogden, Utah. There is one auxiliary road, I-184, which is a 3.5 mile spur of the main road in Boise. \n"}, {"text": "We finally work our way into Salt Lake City after our first disaster. But after another argument over which ways are north and south, we find ourselves south on I-15. Which \"city of sin\" are we off to, if we keep going?", "correct": "Las Vegas", "options": ["Denver", "Phoenix", "San Francisco"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLas Vegas.\n\n\tI-15 is almost 1,500 miles (2,300 km) from the quiet Canada/US border in Sweetgrass, Montana, to the hustle-and-bustle of Southern California, as I-15 terminates in San Diego. South of Salt Lake City, I-15 runs through Provo, Utah, and intersects with Interstate 70 before entering Las Vegas. Past Vegas, the interstates passes through the Mojave Desert, and the outskirts of metropolitan Los Angeles before arriving in San Diego. \n"}, {"text": "After a couple of turns, we are now on Interstate 40 eastbound towards Albuquerque, New Mexico. If we to duplicate Bugs Bunny, and make a left turn at Albuquerque, which \"square\" highway would we merge on to?", "correct": "Interstate 25", "options": ["Interstate 68", "Interstate 18", "Interstate 36"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInterstate 25.\n\n\tHeading north-south from New Mexico to Wyoming, Interstate 25 passes through the state capitals of the three states it stretches across, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Denver, Colorado, and Cheyenne, Wyoming. Measuring in at just over 1,000 miles, the Interstate also passes through Colorado Springs, Pueblo, and (everyone's favourite trivia question) Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. \n"}, {"text": "With everyone trying to impersonate Bugs, of course, we miss the turn, and, after a few more turns, we're heading south on Interstate.... what?!?!

The I-35 series of exit numbers continue along 35E, as 35W has its own set of exit numbers, starting at 1. \r As for I-35 itself, the highway starts at the US-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, and continues 1,600 miles (2,500 km)north to Duluth, Minnesota. \n"}, {"text": "\"Are we there yet?\"\n\nThe kids have finally started to complain, as we travel east on Interstate 20 out of Dallas.

The Intestate travels through large Southern cities like Dallas, Fort Worth, Birmingham, and Atlanta, but does not travel to Florida. The highway goes through northern Louisiana and central Mississippi,before turning northeast towards Atlanta through Alabama and into Georgia. Interstate 20 intersects seven of the primary north-south Interstates (like I-95, I-75, and I-35). \n"}, {"text": "As we are leaving The Lone Star State, we all laugh when George Strait's \"All My Ex's Live in Texas\" plays on the radio. Ignoring the kids' request for Disney, which north-south Interstate will take me from I-20 to Nashville", "correct": "Interstate 65", "options": ["Interstate 43", "Interstate 85", "Interstate 29"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInterstate 65.\n\n\tInterstate 65 would take me from the 190 miles from I-20 in Birmingham, Alabama up to Nashville, and then beyond all the way to Chicago. At nearly 900 miles, the highway also would take me to Indianapolis, Louisville, or south to Mobile, the southern terminus of I-65. \n"}, {"text": "From Nashville, we head east on I-40 to Knoxville, and then head northeast on this Interstate into Virginia, and beyond.

Each auxiliary interstate`s last two numbers are the name of its primary highway. In New York City, just to confuse things further, some auxiliary highways do not intersect with their primary Interstate.I-78 was originally planned to be extended on to Long Island, but that never came to fruition. But, the plans for I-278, I-478, I-678, and I-878 had already started when the cancellation was made. They still exist today. Interstate 495 also does not intersect I-95 directly, but does make contact through I-295. \n"}, {"text": "Finally.

Which military general-turned president was it?", "correct": "Dwight D. Eisenhower", "options": ["Herbert Hoover", "Richard Nixon", "Lyndon B. Johnson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower\n\n\tRepublican president Dwight Eisenhower's plan to connect US cities by a Interstate system was published in 1955. Eisenhower got the idea while travelling across the country in 1919 on an Army convoy. The Federal Aid Highway Act, passed in 1956 \"paved the way\" for the Interstate creation. The title of first Interstate is debated, as the first contracts for the highways were signed in Missouri, but Kansas claims that they started paving first. Nebraska was the first to complete its requirements. Eisenhower's original plan was completed in 1992, as I-70 was finished in Colorado. \n"}]}
