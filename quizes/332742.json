", "correct": "Thomas Magnum", "options": ["MIke Hammer", "Joe Mannix", "Jim Rockford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThomas Magnum.\n\n\tThe only factoid I will include here is that his first film appearance was with Mae West, who rightly forecast his coming fame. If you know that you are a Selleck fan. \n"}, {"text": "In 'Miami Vice', a show that was the soundtrack for the mid to late 1980's, who did Don Johnson portray?", "correct": "Sonny Crockett", "options": ["Patrick Jane", "Jack Killian", "Stewart McMillan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSonny Crockett.\n\n\tFrom Ted Nugent to Phil Collins and acts diverse as Sheena Easton and Glen Frey, it became the thing to get on the show for musicians who usually contributed a song as well as sometime dubious acting skills. And lest we forget most of America and the world first saw a young Bruce Willis here, with hair, in 1984. \n"}, {"text": "Fred Gwynne, of later Herman Munster fame, appeared in \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" as which character?", "correct": "Francis Muldoon", "options": ["Frank Cannon", "Francis Furillo", "Charlie Wild"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancis Muldoon.\n\n\tThis comedy show ran from 1961 to 1963 and is notable for recurring roles for three black actors, Ossie Davis, Nipsey Russell and Frederick O'Neal. They all portrayed fellow police officers in the Bronx. Shot in black and white the cars were painted red and white but came out the proper shades of black and white on film. This was done so they would not be mistaken for real black, green and white NYPD cars of the time. \n"}, {"text": "Edd Byrnes' wannabe sleuth in '77 Sunset Strip' is memorable for his comb and what repetitive name?", "correct": "Kookie Kookson III", "options": ["Sloopy Sluman Jr.", "Terry Taylor IV", "Mikey Minsky II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKookie Kookson III.\n\n\tThis show utilized Efrem Zimbalist Jr. playing \"Stu\" Bailey a character from the novel 'The Double Take' written by Roy Huggins one of the creators. This book was later made into the movie 'I Love Trouble' in 1948. This series featured new talent like William Shatner and Gena Rowlands as well as established stars like Fay Wray and Peter Lorre. It was so cool it even had contemporary sports figures like Sandy Koufax appearing. Sounds like a blue print for 'Miami Vice' which followed years later. \n"}, {"text": "Hollywood son Michael Douglas portrayed which character in 'Streets Of San Francisco'?", "correct": "Steve Keller", "options": ["Elvis Ford", "Bert Jameson", "Pete Ryan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve Keller.\n\n\tThe show ran from 1972 to 1977 and suffered an early demise when Douglas left the show mid-season of its final year. He did so after producing 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. \n"}, {"text": "Burt Reynolds had a run as a short lived series lead portraying which police lieutenant in 1970-1971?", "correct": "Dan August", "options": ["Tod Stiles", "Richard Kimball", "Buz Murdock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDan August.\n\n\tAlthough the show lasted just the two seasons it was lucky in its timing to be a popular rerun when Burt's big screen career took off. The series took life from a TV movie 'House on Green Apple Road' starring Janet Leigh and Christopher George. \n"}, {"text": "'The Saint' starred Roger Moore as a quasi-detective early in the series and later a semi-spy role as this character named what?", "correct": "Simon Templar", "options": ["Michael Shayne", "Beau Maverick", "Owen Marshall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSimon Templar.\n\n\tBased on the novels by Leslie Charteris this show moved from black and white to color during its run. I once saw a scholarly reviewer refer to the Templar character as a cambrioleur and had to look that up. Turns out to be fancy verbiage for cat burglar. \n"}, {"text": "Pierce Brosnan portrayed which character in a show of the same name that lifted the name from a typewriter and a football team?", "correct": "Remington Steele", "options": ["Shotgun Slade", "A. J. Simon", "Marcel Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRemington Steele.\n\n\tRemington Steele(ers) was the fictitious character dreamed up by Stephanie Zimbalist as Laura Holt in the show. Its extension before its demise cost Brosnan a couple of appearances as James Bond as well as costing Zimbalist the role of Anne Lewis in 'Robocop'. \n"}, {"text": "Broderick Crawford in 'Highway Patrol' is likely the prototype of the tough, gruff no-nonsense cop in his role as who?", "correct": "Dan Mathews", "options": ["Paul Drake", "Rick Simon", "Marcel Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDan Mathews.\n\n\tThis show has too many trivia worthy items related to it to do it justice here. Notably, it did have Gene Roddenberry writing episodes under the pen name of Robert Wesley. It also did many shoots on location, a break from studio bound production. \n"}, {"text": "Mike Connors was the title character in a 1967-1975 show that featured early computer usage. The show also provided an early recurring role for an African-American woman when from the second season on Gail Fisher was secretary to whom?", "correct": "Joe Mannix", "options": ["Lawrence Preston", "Kenneth Preston", "Perry Mason"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe Mannix.\n\n\tMike was of Armenian heritage who like his character was a Korean War vet.
