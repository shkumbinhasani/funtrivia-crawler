{"id": "405244", "name": "Protect the Healers! Online Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these is typically seen as a healer or support class in \"World of Warcraft\"?", "correct": "Priest", "options": ["Rogue", "Death Knight", "Hunter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPriest.\n\n\tThere are many classes in \"World of Warcraft\" that are suitable for the healer role, but some do this better than others (and some classes are very ill-suited, instead focusing on being DPS (damage per second, or offensive) or a 'tank' (which soaks up damage, defensively).  Priests are particularly powerful healers since they specialize in Holy and Discipline Spells. Druids and Shamans, likewise, have Restoration specializations.  In a larger dungeon or raid, these roles are very valuable and highly sought after as no amount of damage is likely to overcome certain foes.  Party balance (and support) is integral. \n"}, {"text": "In the original \"Final Fantasy\" (NES), Cura is a spell used by mages of what particular colour?", "correct": "White", "options": ["Yellow", "Red", "Blue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite.\n\n\tWhite Magic was famously known for its supportive capabilities in the early \"Final Fantasy\" games, and while it shifted from being explicitly used by White Mages (especially when the series took a turn into sci-fi/fantasy realms), it always remained a mainstay magic type that would recur in the RPG genre-- especially turn-based RPGs.  Spells like Cure, Cura, and Curaja would restore varying amounts of player HP (Hit Points) while other white spells could cast status ailments or do extra damage to undead foes (the opposite of health would death, after all). \n"}, {"text": "In \"Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars\", which one of these characters, the last to be added to the party, specialized in healing and support abilities?", "correct": "Princess Toadstool", "options": ["Bowser", "Geno", "Mario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincess Toadstool.\n\n\tThough Mallow was also capable of using weather-related techniques to heal other party members (HP Rain comes to mind), it's the often-helpless Princess Toadstool who joins the party with the strongest healing/support abilities.  The last to join, only appearing in the party after she's saved from her faux wedding in Marrymore, Princess Toadstool's Therapy, Group Hug, and Come Back Special Abilities all restore the party (either in HP or by resurrecting them).  Her other Special Abilities all deal status effects to foes. All other party members (Mario, Mallow, Geno, and Bowser) have at least one damaging Special Ability. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Dead By Daylight\" (PC), survivors can heal each other using which of these consumable items?", "correct": "Medkit", "options": ["Potion", "Toolbox", "Flashlight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMedkit.\n\n\tThough Survivors have the ability (typically) to heal one another in a trial, resourceful players will bring or locate Medkits, items that they can use to expedite the process by increasing healing speed, affecting Skill Checks, or outright full-healing themselves or a teammate.  Some Survivors are also capable of using a Self-Care Perk that allows them to heal themselves without the use of a Medkit, though this is done at a much slower rate; you're typically going to get healed faster by one (or more) of your party members. \n"}, {"text": "What Pokemon, known for its healing techniques, became a frequent sight at Pokemon Centers?", "correct": "Chansey", "options": ["Pikachu", "Clefable", "Jigglypuff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChansey.\n\n\tThere are a number of different Pokemon types that have healing techniques though Chansey epitomized the ability.  Not only was this helpful normal-type Pokemon chock full of self-supporting techniques, ensuring its heartiness in battle, but it started appearing as a fixture in Pokemon Centers, healing locations found in major towns of every reason.  The characterization continued in the \"Pokemon\" TV show wherein Chanseys would typically be amongst the nursing staff of any given medical centre-- Pokemon or otherwise. \n"}, {"text": "Although many characters in \"Dota 2\" are capable of healing, all players can eat which of these to restore health?", "correct": "Tango", "options": ["Mango", "Creeps", "Aegis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTango.\n\n\tTangos are early-game items often purchased by players who need a quick pick-me-up to refill health during their laning stage.  Due to the layout of the map, there will always be lanes that are not occupied by more than one player, so while support is often included in any good team composition, it's likely that some will need to rely on Tangos to help keep HP ticking in the right direction (and to avoid needing to retreat altogether).  But as noted, support roles are key in \"Dota 2\" if not simply for healing, buffs, and protective abilities, then for vision and presence. Some support heroes do this better than others. While each hero is different some, like Omniknight, Dazzle, Io, and Oracle, are particularly known to heal. \n"}, {"text": "Phoenix Down is a critical restorative item found in what game series?", "correct": "Final Fantasy", "options": ["Shin Megami Tensei: Persona", "The Legend of Zelda", "Tales of Symphonia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinal Fantasy.\n\n\tLet's face it-- sometimes in games, it's easy to die.  Difficult games often require clutch items, and the Phoenix Down is one of the most famous of such items to be at the RPG gamer's disposal.  The name explains its use-- due to the Phoenix's powers to come back from the ashes, the Phoenix Down, when used on a fallen party member, can return them from the dead (often with a set amount of health) so that they may resume their battle. The Phoenix Down would be used on a recurring basis in the \"Final Fantasy\" series (often by any character if purchased) and would appear in other forms in similar games (like the Pick Me Up in \"Super Mario RPG\" or the Revive in \"Chrono Trigger\"). \n"}, {"text": "Hailing from Stuttgart, Germany, what \"Team Fortress 2\" character is the leading player support class?", "correct": "The Medic", "options": ["The Healer", "The Bandager", "The Doctor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Medic.\n\n\tAnother game with critically-defined roles, \"Team Fortress 2\" is unlike most of the others to feature dedicated healers because it's a shooter game.  \"Team Fortress 2\" features a handful of classes including The Engineer, The Pyro, The Spy, and The Scout.  Where The Medic differs is that his weapons and items revolve around explicit support for fellow players. This includes using Medi Guns, buffs for players with the Kritzkrieg, empowered resistances with the Vaccinator, and speed boosts with the Overdose.  It's not to say The Medic doesn't have offensive weapons (you should see the Bone Saw), but they're less powerful than those used by other players. \n"}, {"text": "In many \"Mario\" platforming games, the titular plumber is healed when he obtains which of these (often in number)?", "correct": "Coins", "options": ["Bananas", "Hearts", "Stars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoins.\n\n\tWhile mushrooms are an obvious go-to and certainly do affect Mario in early platformers (where his health was directly determined by how big he'd grown), later games (starting with \"Super Mario 64\") created a system in which Mario recovered health, often on a meter, using generic coins found throughout the maps visited. Regular golden coins granted one health, red ones would grant two, blue would be five.  The trope continued through other games in the series (including \"Super Mario Sunshine\", \"Super Mario Galaxy\", and \"Super Mario Odyssey\") though mushrooms would return to help restore HP in RPG games like \"Paper Mario\". \n"}, {"text": "Although an advisory member of S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team, what medic (and occasional playable character) from the \"Resident Evil\" series is a biochemist?", "correct": "Rebecca Chambers", "options": ["Jill Valentine", "Claire Redfield", "Sherry Birkin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRebecca Chambers.\n\n\tOne of the most important medics in horror gaming, Rebecca Chambers is the protagonist of \"Resident Evil Zero\" and she makes a critical appearance in Chris Redfield's story in the original \"Resident Evil\", having been trapped in the Spencer Mansion during the outbreak there.  Rebecca is immensely resourceful with antibiotics. Though many games in the series use a healing system that involves crushing up found herbs or using an aerosol First Aid Spray, Rebecca comes in clutch in creating a needed antidote in the first \"Resident Evil\", saving Chris' life after a particularly poisonous encounter. \n"}]}
