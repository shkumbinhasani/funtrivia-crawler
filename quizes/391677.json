{"id": "391677", "name": "Which Witch? Quiz | Language Use | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Language Use", "Homonyms and Homophones"], "questions": [{"text": "Old Madge wants to cast a new incantation that she found in a spellbook. What kind of spell would she find in a witch's spellbook?\n\n", "correct": "A series of words that will make something magical happen when said together", "options": ["A word with all of the letters in the right order", "A splinter of wood", "A short period of time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA series of words that will make something magical happen when said together.\n\n\tThe kind of spell that Old Madge is looking for is the 'words' kind. Not the 'how do you spell this word?' kind of spell, though it would make it easier if everything was spelled correctly! She's looking for a sentence or phrase that's going to make something magical happen. She can't remember what exactly IS supposed to happen, but something WILL happen, she's sure of it.\r All four options are definitions of 'spell', but Old Madge won't find a short period of time in her spellbook (unless that Chronos incantation has read itself again). And the splinters of wood aren't supposed to be in there: they're what was left of the desk after that explosion... \n"}, {"text": "Old Madge has looked but she can't find the incantation in her spellbook. She turns to the index to find the word 'charm'. What kind of charm is she looking for?", "correct": "A magical saying", "options": ["A flavour of quark", "Charisma", "A bead for a necklace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA magical saying.\n\n\tWhen 'incantation' isn't doing the trick, use 'charm' instead. Both mean a phrase that has magical power. It would be nice if Old Madge found some charisma in a spellbook, but unfortunately no one's discovered a spell THAT powerful. Poor old dear. There are so many lucky charms on her necklace that it's almost certainly the reason she's got a hunchback. She definitely doesn't need any more of those. Old Madge is certainly not looking for a particular type of quark. She didn't even know a quark was a thing. \n"}, {"text": "The old witch knows she needs an animal for the magic to work properly. What should she search for on magicshopper.com?", "correct": "Toad", "options": ["Told", "Towed", "Toed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToad.\n\n\tMake sure it's a live one Madge! The toad isn't part of the recipe, Madge just wants a bit of company. It could be a three-toed toad or a four-toed toad, she isn't fussy. The toad will probably be towed in a container on the back of the courier's broom.\r 'Told' isn't actually a homophone of 'toad', but they do sound similar. \n"}, {"text": "It isn't actually in the recipe, but Old Madge thinks it will give the incantation a little extra kick. It's a small thing with pink petals and a stem. What is it?", "correct": "Flower", "options": ["Flour", "Neither flower nor flour", "Both flour and flower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlower.\n\n\tNow let's get this straight. A flower is the part of certain plants that is responsible for reproduction. They can be used in alchemy. Flour is ground up wheat used in cooking and baking. That's a whole different kind of recipe. It should (here, Old Madge has underlined the rest of the sentence in thick red pen) never, never be used for spellcasting. It took weeks to get all of the white powder out of the cat. \n"}, {"text": "This incantation is oddly specific. It says, 'Put the shoelace in a bow.' Which of these bows is most commonly associated with a shoelace?", "correct": "A knot made of two loops", "options": ["A rod used to play a violin", "A weapon used to fire arrows", "The front part of a ship"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA knot made of two loops.\n\n\tNo, Madge! Put that bow and arrow down! And no, I don't think you need to be at sea to cast a fire spell. Setting fire to a boat won't end well for you or your spellcasting opponent. Now find your glasses so you can see how to tie that knot.\r A knot made of two loops, a weapon that shoots arrows, and a rod used to play a violin are all pronounced in the same way. They rhyme with 'slow' and 'know'. The front part of a ship is also spelled 'bow', but it rhymes with 'how' and 'cow' instead. \n"}, {"text": "Old Madge wants to make a potion. The instructions state that it will only work under a king's reign. She needs to wait until the king bursts into water droplets, true?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOld Madge doesn't need to find a spell that will turn the king into a cloud. That word is spelled with 'ai', not 'eig'. She doesn't need to put a bit in his mouth to control him like a horse either. That's a different kind of rein. In this case, the potion will only work if there is a male monarch on the throne. \n"}, {"text": "The witch needs a feather from a crane. Where should she go for the best chance of finding one?", "correct": "A nest in a wetland area", "options": ["A large shipping port in Antarctica", "A construction site", "On someone's neck while they are leaning out of a window"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA nest in a wetland area.\n\n\tA crane is a type of bird that usually lives in wetland areas. They can be found on all continents except Antarctica and South America. (Old Madge would have a fair distance to travel for a crane feather if she lived in either of those places. Well, there's always magicshopper.com.) When the spell asked for a feather, that's the kind of crane it was referring to.\r Cranes are also used to lift heavy items on construction sites and shipping ports, but those kinds of crane don't come with a healthy coat of feathers. People can also crane their neck to look at something, but I've never seen them sprout feathers while doing so. \n"}, {"text": "It's been cloudy for five days straight and it's making Old Madge miserable. She decides to perform a weather incantation to replace the clouds with something more pleasant. She turns to the index of her spellbook and looks up the word 'son'. Which word should she actually look for?", "correct": "Sun", "options": ["Son", "Sunn", "Sonnet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSun.\n\n\tOld Madge is going to get quite a shock if she performs a spell to produce a son! She's a bit past her child-rearing years, and the house of a scatterbrained witch is no place for a baby. Madge is looking for 'sun', the big ball of gas in the sky. 'Sunn' is a south Asian shrub and a 'sonnet' is a type of poem. Neither of those things is what Madge is looking for. \n"}, {"text": "Old Madge has had enough of copying other witch's spells and recipes. She thinks she's got what it takes to write her own spellbook. She starts with:\n\n'To make a love potion, first pick a rows.'\n\nWhich word should she use instead of 'rows'?", "correct": "Rose", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRose.\n\n\tA 'rose' is a plant with fragrant flowers, often red, white, or pink. Old Madge knows they're traditionally a romantic flower, so they've got to go into a love potion. Obviously.\r 'Rows' is the plural of 'row', as in the three rows of teeth on that monster Madge has just accidentally summoned while experimenting with her 'love potion'. 'Rose' is also a female name, and the past tense of the verb 'rise'. It can be used in a sentence like, 'Rose is the name of the monster with three rows of teeth that, with a bit of accidental assistance from Madge, just rose from the dead.' \n"}, {"text": "The old witch finishes off the alchemy recipe with:\n\n'Throw in the I of a dear.'\n\nWhat should Madge have written?", "correct": "Throw in the eye of a deer", "options": ["Throe in the I of a deer", "Throw in the I of a deer", "Throe in the eye of a dear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThrow in the eye of a deer.\n\n\tPoor Old Madge. Writing this spellbook is going to take some time. 'Throw' was the correct spelling of the verb meaning to hurl or toss something. 'Throe' is actually a noun meaning severe pain or struggle, much like the feeling Madge is now experiencing while writing her spellbook. A 'deer' is a grazing mammal and an 'eye' is an organ used for sight.\r A 'poor old dear' is what people call Madge. A 'poor old deer' is an animal that's about to have its eyes removed. \n"}]}
