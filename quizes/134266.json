{"id": "134266", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Abyssinia, Henry' Trivia Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Typically, 'Abyssinia, Henry' opens with an operating scene.  As usual, Hawkeye and Trapper are mouthing off, Frank is complaining and Henry is ready to boil over.  All normalcy flies out the window, however, when Radar notifies Henry that he is going home!  What reason does Radar give for Henry's imminent return to the states?", "correct": "Henry has received all his 'points' and is being discharged", "options": ["Henry is being transferred to central M*A*S*H headquarters in Washington", "Henry will finish his tour of duty at the University of Illinois training medical personnel", "Henry's wife is sick and he has received a 'hardship' discharge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry has received all his 'points' and is being discharged.\n\n\tRadar claims that Henry has received all his 'points' and is therefore being discharged from the army.  The interesting thing about this is that, according to several 'M*A*S*H'-related websites, the army did away with the rotation points system after World War II, the only war in which they were used.  Hence, this is a small error on the part of the researchers on the show.  No matter though, it is still true that draftees would serve regular tours of duty, so the inaccuracy does not detract from the reality... \n"}, {"text": "The scene shifts to Henry's office where the ecstatic Colonel has a celebratory drink (or two, or three...) Meanwhile, Radar and Henry discuss calling Henry's wife Lorraine to deliver the good news.  When Henry finally makes the call, he not only talks with his wife, but with which other person?", "correct": "His daughter Janie", "options": ["His son Andrew", "His mother", "His mother-in-law"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis daughter Janie.\n\n\tDuring his conversation with his wife he requests that his brown double-breasted suit be taken to the cleaners so that the two of them can have a night on the town when he gets back.  It is here that Henry learns that his mother-in-law has worn this suit (for a dress up party...she was Conrad Nagel.)  When Henry talks with his daughter Janie, he 'eats her up', saying, 'Num-num-num-num-num.'  The fastidious Radar chimes in, 'Sir, there isn't much time!', to which Hawkeye responds, 'Leave him alone, he's eating!' \n"}, {"text": "Still in the office, Radar and Henry are sorting through the desk and filing cabinet drawers in preparation for Henry's departure.  In a sentimental, and hilarious, moment Radar reveals to Henry the ultimate fate of his father.  Finish the following Radar O'Reilly quote:  'My father didn't have me 'til he was sixty-three. First time we played _________ he had a stroke.'", "correct": "Peek-a-boo", "options": ["Paddy cake", "Hopscotch", "Hide and seek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeek-a-boo.\n\n\tThe purpose of this line is to suggest that Radar looks at Henry as a father figure, but the absurdity of it prompts Henry to respond, 'Look, Radar, don't get gushy, okay? You know how I am.'  Radar then gives Henry a gift, a keychain that he made using an empty Winchester cartridge...how sweet! \n"}, {"text": "During this same office scene, Henry gives Radar a gift...something he got from his father.  What item does Radar receive from the Colonel?", "correct": "Thermometer", "options": ["Pen", "Fish hook", "Coffee mug"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThermometer.\n\n\tIn return for Radar's homemade gift, Henry gives Radar his father's thermometer, which we discover is not oral.  About the thermometer, Henry quotes his father, 'If you want accuracy, go right to the horse's mouth.'  I don't think he meant 'mouth', though...if you know what I mean...ahem. \n"}, {"text": "Next we see the drunken Henry dining with Radar, Trapper and Hawkeye in Rosey's Bar.  After indulging in wonderful food, a few drinks and some terrible jokes, Henry adjourns to the restroom.  When he returns, Hawkeye and Trapper disrupt Henry of all military rank while three Korean women hum what patriotic tune in the background?", "correct": "America the Beautiful", "options": ["God Bless America", "Star Spangled Banner", "Yankee Doodle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerica the Beautiful.\n\n\tHawkeye, on behalf of those who have 'served under Henry's barely distinguishable command', disrupts the Colonel of all military rank.  Trapper then declares that from henceforth Henry will be known as 'Mister Dr. Henry Blake', while tearing off several insignias on Henry's shirt. \n"}, {"text": "After booting Henry out of the Army, Trapper and Hawkeye offer a gift to their departing commander.  What item have the doctors provided for Henry's safe return to the states?", "correct": "A suit and tie", "options": ["A pair of wingtips", "A gold-plated bedpan", "An engraved fishing reel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA suit and tie.\n\n\tAccording to Hawkeye, 'the tie is silk, handmade by a worm.'  When Henry wonders aloud how they knew his size Radar responds, 'I traced you when you were asleep!' \n"}, {"text": "The next morning, Frank whistles for the entire camp to assemble; it's time to see Henry off.  After telling Frank to 'stuff his whistle', Henry reviews his troops for the last time.  Who has Klinger chosen to dress up as for the occasion?", "correct": "Carmen Miranda", "options": ["Norma Desmond", "Scarlett O'Hara", "The Statue of Liberty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarmen Miranda.\n\n\tKlinger appears at Henry's send-off fully decked out, with the trademark Carmen Miranda fruit headware.  In a classic moment, Henry offers to zip the back of Klinger's dress.  Just as Henry goes to zip the dress, Klinger says, 'Up, sir!'  Klinger then gives Henry a photo of himself, wearing a pink evening gown, and requests that Henry 'carry it in his wallet.'  A Section 8 to the end! \n"}, {"text": "On the chopper pad, just before takeoff, Henry says goodbye one last time, and particularly addresses Radar.  What is the last word we hear Henry say?", "correct": "Butt", "options": ["Monkey", "Latrine", "Crazy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nButt.\n\n\tHenry's final words to Radar: 'You behave yourself, or I'm going to come back and kick your butt!'  Radar's response is barely audible, but I believe he says, 'I will.'  It's obvious that Gary Burghoff was having difficulties with that scene... \n"}, {"text": "The final, heart-wrenching scene of the episode sees the crew of the 4077th hard at work in the operating room.  Radar, white as a ghost, walks into the operating room and announces Henry Blake's death.  Over which body of water was Henry's plane shot down?", "correct": "Sea of Japan", "options": ["South China Sea", "Gulf of Korea", "Yellow Sea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSea of Japan.\n\n\tRadar walks into the OR with the following message: 'Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan.  It spun in.  There were no survivors.'  Apparently, the cast was not told about the final outcome of the episode until the very last moment, so the shock and sadness seen on the faces of the actors and actresses is quite genuine. \n"}, {"text": "This episode not only marks the final appearance of Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), but also of Trapper John (Wayne Rogers).", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, the final episode of the third season of 'M*A*S*H' saw the departure of two beloved characters, Henry Blake and Trapper John McEntyre.  In perhaps the worst career move in TV history, McLean Stevenson decided to explore other options, including a potential starring role in his own series.  It did not pan out for him. Wayne Rogers left the show as a result of a contract dispute, and in part because he felt he wasn't using his time wisely.  According to Rogers, he didn't like seeing the Trapper John character be manipulated and utilized without purpose.  Enter B.J. (Mike Farrell) and Sherman T. Potter (Harry Morgan)...and the beat goes on!  Thanks for trying this quiz. If you enjoyed it, I invite you to try my other 'M*A*S*H' episode quizzes. \n"}]}
