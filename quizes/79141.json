{"id": "79141", "name": "Hardest Devastating Pitchers Trivia Quiz | MLB Records | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "       MLB Records", " Pitching Records"], "questions": [{"text": "Closer Mariano Rivera has a very devastating pitch that comes at the hitters at 95-mph. What is the pitch?", "correct": "Cut Fastball", "options": ["Split-Finger", "Slider", "Sinker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCut Fastball.\n\n\tRivera's cutter comes to the plate as a 95-mph four-seam fastball. Once in a while, it WILL be a four-seam fastball. However, it probably would be a cutter, which will explode away from right-handed batters or into the thumbs of a left-handed batter. Since it comes at you at 95-mph, batters have don't have time to guess if it is a four-seam fastball or cutter. \n"}, {"text": "Closer Trevor Hoffman also possesses a very devastating pitch. Which pitch is it?", "correct": "Changeup", "options": ["Split -Finger", "Curveball", "Fork-Ball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChangeup.\n\n\tHoffman once hit the radar-gun in the mid-1990s. Today, his fastball peaks at 87 or 88 mph. However, when Hoffman throws his changeup, his arm action is the same as his fastball. So, if a hitter is expecting a fastball and a 60-mph changeup floats to the plate, a batter could swing three times before the ball lands in the catcher's glove. \n"}, {"text": "The Big-Unit Randy Johnson has an overpowering two-pitch combo. What are the two pitches?", "correct": "Fastball, Slider", "options": ["Fastball, Sinker", "Fastball, Changeup", "Fastball, Split-Finger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFastball, Slider.\n\n\tJohnson is a 6ft 10in power-pitcher who throws his slider faster than most pitchers throw their fastballs. With Johnson's reach, this release-point comes at the hitters from the first base side of the field and practically crosses the plate sideways. Hitters have to commit to his pitches before he releases the ball. If they try to guess which pitch he's going to throw and they guess wrong, even the leagues best hitters end-up looking foolish, badly missing his sliders or watching a fastball fire across the plate. \n"}, {"text": "Power-pitcher Pedro Martinez's main arsenal consists of a fastball and curveball?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAs great as Martinez's repertoire is, he also has a triple threat of three pitches, which includes a changeup. This is why Martinez is so successful. He has an awesome fastball, an overmatching curveball on left-handed batters, and a great changeup, which keeps batters on their toes. \n"}, {"text": "John Smoltz, former starting pitcher and then a closer, has a trifecta for a pitch arsenal. What are the three pitches?", "correct": "Fastball, Slider, Split-Finger", "options": ["Cut Fastball, Curveball, Slider", "Screwball, Forkball, Curveball", "Fastball, Changeup, Split-Finger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFastball, Slider, Split-Finger.\n\n\tSmoltz is very tough on right-handed batters, with his fastball and slider and his splitter on left-handed batters. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these pitchers is a relief pitcher who has an unorthodox delivery with a fastball that rises up at 90-mph and a nasty slider, which bends, away from right-handed batters?", "correct": "Byung-Hyun Kim", "options": ["Hideo Nomo", "Satoru Komiyama", "Sun-Woo Kim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nByung-Hyun Kim.\n\n\tDespite what happened to Kim in games 4 and 5 between the Arizona Diamondbacks and New York Yankees in 2001, Kim can be more unhittable than Randy Johnson. Up to the 2001 World Series, opponents were hitting .186 against Kim (143 hits, 293 strikeouts) in his career. Right-handed hitters were a ridiculous 72-for-434 (.166), with 185 whiffs. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these pitchers throws a really nasty knuckle-curve?", "correct": "Mike Mussina", "options": ["Tim Hudson", "Kerry Wood", "Armando Benitez"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike Mussina.\n\n\tWhen his knuckle-curve is on, it is virtually unhittable. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these right-handed pitchers has a two-pitch repertoire, an average-speed fastball and changeup yet has precision placement with his pitches?", "correct": "Greg Maddux", "options": ["Felix Rodriguez", "Andy Pettitte", "Jamie Moyer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreg Maddux.\n\n\tAccording to an AL executive, Maddux has 'incredible combination of movement, command and change in velocity.'
