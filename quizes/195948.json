Trivia Game | Fargo | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Fargo"], "questions": [{"text": "The title of the film is proven relevant in its very first scene, in which Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) meets up with two criminals in Fargo, North Dakota.  In what state, though, does almost all of the rest of this film's plot take place?", "correct": "Minnesota", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinnesota.\n\n\tAlmost all of the events in the film take place in either Brainerd or Minneapolis, both of which are cities in Minnesota. \n"}, {"text": "The small town of Brainerd sports an impressive statue at its border.  What mythological figure's image is captured by this statue?", "correct": "Paul Bunyan", "options": ["Babe the Blue Ox", "Bigfoot", "John Henry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul Bunyan.\n\n\tThere's a place in town called the Blue Ox Inn, but the statue at Brainerd's border depicts a giant Paul Bunyan, complete with his axe resting on his shoulder. \n"}, {"text": "Jerry Lundegaard and his wife Jean have a son.  What is his name?", "correct": "Scotty", "options": ["Ronny", "Johnny", "Bobby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScotty.\n\n\tScotty seems to be completely disrespectful of his parents until his mother's kidnapping.  (One has to wonder what happens to him after the end of the film -- his mother and grandfather are dead, and his father is on his way to prison!) \n"}, {"text": "A very pregnant Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is shown eating quite a few hearty meals in this film.  Which fast food chain's cuisine do we NOT see her sampling?", "correct": "McDonald's", "options": ["Arby's", "We see her eat food from all of these chains", "Hardee's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMcDonald's.\n\n\tScotty Lundegaard runs off to McDonald's at one point, but we never see Marge eat anything from the Golden Arches.  Her husband Norm brings her an Arby's lunch early on, and later in the film, we see her ordering food at the Hardee's drive-through. \n"}, {"text": "At one point in the film, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) brings a hired escort to see a live concert.  Who is the featured performer?", "correct": "Jose Feliciano", "options": ["Tommy Tutone", "Jerry Reed", "Art Garfunkel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJose Feliciano.\n\n\tCarl seems to be a fan of Feliciano, who appears as himself in this scene.  The hired escort doesn't look too impressed. \n"}, {"text": "At which hotel chain does Marge Gunderson stay during the bulk of her investigation?", "correct": "Radisson", "options": ["Country Inn", "Marriott", "Motel 6"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadisson.\n\n\tMarge seems pleased with the Radisson, as does her creepy friend Mike from high school, who praises the hotel bar by saying, \"Well, it's a Radisson, so you know it's gonna be good.\" \n"}, {"text": "Jerry originally tells Carl Showalter that he and his partner will receive $40,000 for their part in the kidnapping.  How much money is Carl actually handed at the pick-up that results in his being shot in the face?", "correct": "$1,000,000", "options": ["$80,000", "$800,000", "$100,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$1,000,000.\n\n\tWade Gustafson, Jerry's father-in-law, brings one million dollars to the drop-off.  After killing Wade and grabbing the bag of money, Carl extracts $80,000 to show his partner, but buries the rest in the snow along a desolate highway, ostensibly so he can go back later and grab the remaining $920,000 for himself.  \r I think it's pretty clear that no one will ever find that money...and not just because the guy who buried it is dead by the end of the film. \n"}, {"text": "One of the paintings submitted by Marge's husband Norm wins a contest.  Norm's painting of what animal will be appearing on the three-cent stamp in the near future, according to Norm's own dialogue?", "correct": "a duck", "options": ["a bear", "a goose", "a moose"], "explanation": "\n\n\na duck.\n\n\tSpecifically, it's Norm's painting of a mallard duck that wins the honor. \n"}, {"text": "All told, how many people are killed in this film?", "correct": "7 & seven", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n7 & seven.\n\n\tCarl's partner, Gaeor Grimsrud, kills the state trooper, and then the two innocent spectators in Brainerd.  That's three.  Carl kills Wade, and then the parking lot attendant on his way out.  That makes five.  When Carl gets back to the hideout, he learns that Grimsrud has killed Jeanie Lundegaard.  That's six.  Finally, Grimsrud kills Carl, dismembers him, and grinds up as much of him as he can in the wood chipper.  That's a total of seven murders. \n"}, {"text": "According to the film's final lines of dialogue, how much longer will it be before Marge Gunderson gives birth?", "correct": "two months", "options": ["three weeks", "six weeks", "one month"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwo months.\n\n\tBoth Marge and her husband Norm wistfully say \"Two more months\" at the very end of the film. \n"}]}
