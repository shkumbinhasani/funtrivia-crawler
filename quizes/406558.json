{"id": "406558", "name": "\"Feral\" Quiz | American Horror Story | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "American Horror Stories"], "questions": [{"text": "Where do Jay and his family head camping?", "correct": "Protected wilderness", "options": ["His family's property", "A roadside rest stop", "Appalachia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProtected wilderness.\n\n\tDriving his family out into the woods, Jay is excited to experience nature with his wife, Addy, and his young son, Jacob.  Neither Addy nor Jacob is all too interested in going back to basics, but as they drive into Kern Canyon National Park, they're at the very least prepared to tough it out camping under the stars.  They pull into a formal campground and pass deep through the woods to a formal site on a marshy lake.  It's more remote than anticipated, but they have plenty of space all to themselves.  They finally start to relax when night falls. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these items does Jay give to his son before the disappearance?", "correct": "A compass", "options": ["A flashlight", "A map", "A four-leaf clover"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA compass.\n\n\tWhen it finally gets dark, Addy and Jay send Jacob to bed, tucking him in before sitting out with cups of wine.  None of them notice the figure standing in the dark along the treeline.  They head to the tent in due time and ignore the rustling sounds out in the woods, even as shadows creep past where they're sleeping.\r The next morning, Jay and Jacob prepare to go fishing.  Jay hands his son his old Boy Scouts compass before they head out to the water's edge.  They go without telling Addy who, leaving the tent a little later, finds odd footprints leading from their campsite. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Addy find next to the campsite?", "correct": "A dead animal", "options": ["A human skull", "A totem", "Cigar butts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA dead animal.\n\n\tAddy follows the trail beyond the campsite and into the woods to find the bloody remains of a deer, its neck chewed open, hanging from a fallen tree, but the horror of this is next to the terror awaiting Jay.  As Jacob hides behind trees, jumping out to scare his father on the way to the lake, he goes missing close to the water's edge.  No sound precedes his disappearance, and before Jay realizes, his son is gone without a trace.  He and Addy search high and low, but ultimately, they come up with no answers. \n"}, {"text": "How many years after Jacob's disappearance does Bob visit Jay with information?", "correct": "Ten & 10", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTen & 10.\n\n\tTen years after their son's traumatic disappearance, Jay and Addy struggle on the day-to-day.  Though Jacob would be 13 years old, if alive, Jay doesn't give up hope that the unsolved case can be closed.  He receives a knock at his door from a hunter by the name of Bob who, to his surprise, has information about Jacob.  Bob leads hunting tours up in the woods, often for rich men looking to shoot bears.  But there's something different about Bob's information compared to all the reporters who stop by Jay's place.  Bob is an eyewitness. \n"}, {"text": "How does Bob claim he was able to get footage of Jacob?", "correct": "With a trap camera", "options": ["With a drone", "With satellite telemetry", "Photoshop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith a trap camera.\n\n\tBob explains that for years her's set up camera traps in the woods to locate wild animals, and just last week, he caught a glimpse of a child in the forest.  Deep in the woods-- miles deep-- a photo was snapped of who Bob believes to be Jay's young boy.  In fact, when he checked the trap, he found Jay's old Boy Scout compass.  It's the proof that Jay needs to believe the man.\r There's more, however.  As Bob explains, that side of the National Park has been overrun with illegal pot farms for fifteen years.  It may be that Jacob was snagged by members of the local cartels; they're tied to trafficking.  Bob is willing to bring Jay there to help find the boy, but he's not completely forthcoming about his reasons for helping.\r When Jay tells Abby she's barely able to hear out the possibility.  She believes it's a scam...until she sees the compass. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these structures do Jay and Addy come across in their hike?", "correct": "Ranger station", "options": ["Coal mine", "Fire tower", "Longhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRanger station.\n\n\tWith the evidence that they need, Jay and Abby head back to Kern Canyon National Park.  Parking bob's truck, they start their ten mile trek through the untracked wilderness to the spot the camera trap was set up.  Bob lets them know that if they don't make it to the farm encampment by sundown, they'll be sorry.  It's the perfect opportunity for Jay and Addy to look back angrily at their relationship; they both blame each other for the divorce and their inability to move past the disappearance.  Bob has to keep their minds on the plan to get them trudging onward.  As they walk, none of them recognize the creatures hiding in plain sight.\r Bob brings the pair up to a ranger's station in the hills and they come across the man caring for the area-- Stan-- who knows Bob well enough to know they're not there on a pleasant hike.  They're forced to come clean quickly.  He can only warn the group that there are things in the canyons they don't want to get involved with. \n"}, {"text": "When Bob, Jay, and Addy come across the cartel, there are no survivors.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tStan explains that ten years ago, he was in the very ranger station they've come across.  He'd only been in the country a couple months, but after that night he could never leave.  That night he saw massive footprints on the ground.  He was knocked out by a large rock, but when he came to he saw their son being carried into the trees.  It doesn't help that moments after the group's departure, Stan spies something in the trees and goes to collect a shotgun.\r When Bob takes Jay and Addy further on their way, he claims to the couple that there's never been anything in the woods he hasn't been able to explain.  He's unable to reason with the sight they come across though.  When they come upon the cartel further along...or at least what remains of them...he's forced to admit he lied the whole time. \n"}, {"text": "Bob reveals that he lied to Jay and Addy, intending to do what once he brought them to the woods?", "correct": "Trade them to the cartel", "options": ["Shoot them and steal their identities", "Offer them as sacrifices to a Pagan deity", "Lose them and leave them without water or food"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrade them to the cartel.\n\n\tThe discovery of the cartel, all of the bodies flayed and left to rot, forces Bob to admit that he never had a trap camera in the woods.  In fact, the image of Jacob he claimed to have was none other than his own nephew, and that image was captured in his backyard.  The compass was something he bought at the Salvation Army.  He only did it to get their reward money, and in return he would hand the couple off to the cartel.\r Bob aims a gun at Jay and Addy and plans to fire, but he's surprised by one of the corpses-- not actually a cartel member at all, but a cannibalistic creature playing dead.  Bob shoots wild, hitting Jay, but the couple is able to escape back the way they came as night falls.  Bob is left to die as more of the creatures surround him. \n"}, {"text": "Stan explains that the National Park Service was created for which of these reasons?", "correct": "To protect people from what's in them", "options": ["To hide illicit operations", "To close off nexuses of paranormal energy", "To protect endangered wildlife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo protect people from what's in them.\n\n\tJay and Addy make it back to the ranger's station to find Stan there awaiting their return.  He lets them in to tend to their wounds but feels as though he has no other option but to explain the problem with Kern Canyon.  The truth is that it's nothing quite like Bigfoot out there.  There is, however, a secret hidden in the National Park System.  It was never created to protect the country's natural beauty; it was made to protect humans from the things that would kill and eat them.  As they flip through confidential folders of information, Stan claims they're 'ferals'.  Genetic mutations over decades...maybe hundreds of years...may have created these inhuman, inbred beings.  As to what they really are, no one really knows.  Stan's seen them and he can barely explain them.  Their son, he says, was likely taken by them.\r Stan says he'll head to the radio and call a ride in for them.  At the very least he'll need to call in an army sweep to cull the feral population.  When he heads to the other room, however, something has already gotten in.  He's killed as Jay and Addy are surrounded. \n"}, {"text": "Do Jay and Addy ever find their missing son?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tJay and Addy run out of ammo quickly and are forced to watch as Stan is disembowelled by the ferals.  It's during this time that they're able to crawl out the broken windows and rush out into the forest.  The ferals, however, pursue them until they can go no further, and before they know it, they're boxed in by the creatures with nowhere to run.  It's only when they end up at their final destination, a clearing, that they realize they've arrived at the throne of the ferals' leader-- their missing son.\r One of the creatures from the circle steps forth to ask Jacob who kneels before them.  In another language, Jacob responds with only one word: \"Dinner.\"  And the ferals converge. \n"}]}
