Medusa has also been seen in art, video games, and architecture because of her prominence in Greek myth. \n"}, {"text": "In this TV show, celebrities and famous people of yesteryear have their heads preserved in glass jars.  What show would this be?", "correct": "Futurama", "options": ["Fringe", "The Jetsons", "Family Guy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFuturama.\n\n\tApparently invented by the creator of Mr. Microphone, Ron Popeil, this technology allows people from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries to remain alive (at least their heads) in the thirty-first century.  Notable heads in jars include Al Gore, Richard Nixon (as President of the Earth), Pamela Anderson, and the Beastie Boys.

The practice of shrinking heads was undertaken by tribespeople in the Amazon, specifically different groups in western Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru.  The severed head is shrunken after being boiled and left to dry under ash.  More often than not, the head is separated from the body before shrinking, usually by headhunters.  A head taken from any old dead body may not be authentic, though. \n"}, {"text": "In what story by Washington Irving can one find a headless horseman?", "correct": "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", "options": ["The Devil and Tom Walker", "Rip Van Winkle", "The Spectre Bridegroom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\n\n\tWritten in 1820 as part of the \"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\" short story collection, this classic American short story is perhaps Irving's most famous.

Nick first appears in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", but plays a more active role as one of the petrified characters who saw the basilisk in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\".

This character is meant to represent Queen Victoria in Carroll's story (which is rife with parody and satire).  The Queen tends to have a knack for shouting her trademark line as if on a whim, and while very few people ever seem to be beheaded, she is one of the largest dangers Alice encounters on her trip through the topsy-turvy world of Wonderland. In Tim Burton's version (released in 2010), the Queen of Hearts was portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter. \n"}]}
