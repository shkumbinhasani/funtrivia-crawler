Online Quiz | Video Games Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture", "Food & Drink in Video Games"], "questions": [{"text": "This game may not improve your culinary skills in a real kitchen, but never has it been so easy to chop an onion with a DS stylus.  What handheld 'perfectionist' game released in 2006 contains dozens of recipes?", "correct": "Cooking Mama", "options": ["Chef Training", "The Hunger Games DS", "DS Kitchen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCooking Mama.\n\n\t\"Cooking Mama\", released in 2006, was created by Office Create and published by Majesco and Taito as a minigame collection...only all of the minigames involve correctly making unique dishes in order to win medals.  While many of the dishes aren't typical 'at home' fare, you'll be able to create, combine, and cook upwards of fifty different dishes to achieve perfect scores. \"Cooking Mama\" won 'Best of E3' from IGN during its demonstration and its popularity spawned several DS and Wii sequels including \"Dinner With Friends\" and \"World Kitchen\".  Unsurprisingly, 'Mama', as she is known, also enriches her life with other interesting hobbies such as gardening, crafts, and babysitting; all of these appear in other \"Mama\" series titles. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Donkey Kong 64\", Troff 'n' Scoff guard boss doors, not allowing the playable simians to progress unless they receive which of these foods?", "correct": "Bananas", "options": ["Coconuts", "Apples", "Pineapples"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBananas.\n\n\tThese Kongs literally have a pile of bananas in their hideout, and when it gets stolen by the evil King K. Rool they go on an epic 3D platforming journey around Kong Island to collect them.  Not only are giant bananas the reward for certain tasks in the game, but smaller bananas are used to feed Troff 'n' Scoff, two overweight animals (a hippo and a pig) who demand bananas for access to evil monsters.  Heck, these guys even use their weight in order to turn a key and unlock a door.  If these guys aren't overeating...\rFood is also used as projectiles in the game; the Kongs shoot coconuts, peanuts, pineapples, and grapes as ammo; oranges are grenades.  It's hard to tell what the developers at Rare really though about food with this award-winning 1999 release for the Nintendo 64. \n"}, {"text": "Game designer Keita Takahashi claimed that this 2004 PlayStation 2 game was an allegory for consumption and consumer culture.  All we felt were the cosmos.  What video came was he talking about?", "correct": "Katamari Damacy", "options": ["Red Faction", "Final Fantasy X-2", "Fatal Frame"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKatamari Damacy.\n\n\t\"Katamari Damacy\" was an interesting game.  The goal: roll a giant orb known as a katamari around an area to roll up all of the objects in your way.  Larger objects could only be rolled into the ball if it was big enough, so working your way through sizes would be a crucial task.  Towards later levels of the game, entire towns from people, to ants, to houses and larger could be rolled up.  Ultimately, according to an E3 interview, the designer wanted to express his frustration with consumerism.\r\"Katamari Damacy\" was the first in the \"Katamari\" series which would continue on the PlayStation 2 and 3 as well as the Xbox 360 and handhelds.  A sleeper hit, it garnered a cult following because of its stylized graphics and quaintly odd premise. \n"}, {"text": "Inhaling pretty much every enemy in his way, what pink puffball is not only named after a vacuum cleaner, but refills his health with tomatoes?", "correct": "Kirby", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKirby.\n\n\tKnown for his romps through Dreamland, a TV show subtitled \"Right Back at 'Ya\", and his one tenure as a piece of yarn, Kirby has traveled through many of Nintendo's consoles and handheld with one major thing: an appetite.  His tendency towards inhaling and swallowing enemies to gain their powers is kind of unnerving. In the Nintendo 64 game \"Kirby and the Crystal Shards\", one of his combined powers (ice and electricity) actually creates a refrigerator to create even more food!  Many of Kirby's quests involve picking up trinkets (eg. crystals, stars, pieces of spaceships, yarn, etc.) but his health is always refilled by food and almost every game contains tons of slices of cake. Firstly, where do they come from?  Secondly, how do they not go stale?  Kirby's lust for food also seems apparent in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" (Wii); his Final Smash attack involves cooking his enemies in a giant vat. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Banjo-Kazooie\" (N64), Boggy, a character on Freezeezy Peak, swallows one of the many Jiggies needed by the bird and bear protagonists.  In the sequel, Boggy and his family are noticeably larger.  What type of animal is Boggy?", "correct": "Polar bear", "options": ["Walrus", "Termite", "None of these; he's a washing machine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPolar bear.\n\n\tOkay-- first off, Boggy eats a giant, golden puzzle piece.  That's a clear sign right there.  Although his lust for shiny, metal foods doesn't really reappear in this first game, his return appearance in \"Banjo-Tooie\" poses more problems.  Firstly, his kids are huge-- so is his wife-- and on a trip to Witchy World, one important mission involves feeding some of the kids with greasy amusement park food.  Another involves carrying the largest of the children in Banjo's backpack, a task which requires that Kazooie vacate to make room.  Boggy and his family live in the colder side of Hailfire Peak, almost never leaving the warm glow of their big-screen TV it seems.\rCommentary from Rare again?  I think so. \n"}, {"text": "Oh so hungry, this character from the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series waits in a storybook trying to regain his lost memories but always finds himself occupied by a particular sweet treat.  Who is it?", "correct": "Winnie the Pooh", "options": ["Jiminy Cricket", "Sora", "Flounder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinnie the Pooh.\n\n\tWinnie the Pooh, of course, lives in the Hundred Acre Wood.  In the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, this world is explored in the form of a storybook which can be accessed by Sora during the main adventure.  If you hop into the storybook and solve the different problems faced by Pooh and his friends, you can help him regain his memories and reunite all of the creatures created by Christopher Robin. Pooh tends to be a very forgetful bear, but one thing that's always on his mind is 'hunny'.  His dialogue, and even his description in Jiminy Cricket's journal, outlines his preoccupation with the sweet food. Funnily enough, 'hunny' is spelled in a similar way to the series' currency, 'munny'. \n"}, {"text": "One of the largest Pokemon, this particular creature is known for his sleeping habits and large, rotund form.  He evolves from a rather ravenous little creature as well.  What Pokemon can be awakened with the PokeFlute if found outside of battle?", "correct": "Snorlax", "options": ["Ursaring", "Piloswine", "Nidoran"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnorlax.\n\n\tSnorlax originally appeared in \"Pokemon Blue\" and \"Pokemon Red\" as Pokemon #142.  The Sleeping Pokemon, as he is known, Snorlax is huge; two can be found blocking paths in Kanto in these original games and they can't be found elsewhere.  To awaken them, they either need to be really hungry (Snorlaxes only awaken to feed) or they need to be roused by the sound of a PokeFlute, obtainable in Lavender Town.\rIn later games, Snorlax received a lower evolution, Munchlax, which, although smaller, is somewhat of a glutton.  Known as the Big Eater Pokemon, Munchlax can only be found in trees containing honey, almost like Winnie the Pooh.  They'll eat anything they can get their hands on though. \n"}, {"text": "Tired of looking at thin damsels in distress?  Well, in 2009 Titan Studios developed a PSN game designed to break down the stereotype (or at least eat it up).  What aptly-titled game would this be?", "correct": "Fat Princess", "options": ["Princess Plump", "The Princess and the Pound", "King-Size Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFat Princess.\n\n\tEat your heart out!  This game was relatively well-received for a PSN title from a first-time development studio.  Although designed as a multiplayer game, \"Fat Princess\" was better known for its straight-forward premise as a 'capture-the-flag' style tournament for up to thirty-two players.  Each side (of sixteen) claims their princess from captivity, returning her hefty highness and feeding her more food en route.  This is where things get difficult; the more cake she eats, the more weight she gains.\rFunnily enough, an expansion pack was released in the same year.  Its name: \"Fat Roles\". \n"}, {"text": "When your diet is dots, how many are too many?  What arcade staple released in 1980 is known for simply eating and eating (you know...dots, fruits, ghosts)?", "correct": "Pac-Man", "options": ["Pong", "Centipede", "Dig-Dug"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPac-Man.\n\n\t\"Pac-Man\" was originally an arcade release but due to its ubiquity in the video game world, it's appeared in collections on nearly every home console since home consoles began.   In the game you control a yellow figure shaped, as many say, like a pizza with a missing slice.  You go around the board with your primary goal to eat all of the dots onscreen (as well as any bonus fruits).  Eating power pills you can even eat the ghostly enemies who chase you around, sending them back to their home in the center of the stage.\r\"Pac-Man\" was originally developed by Namco. \n"}, {"text": "Poking fun at overeating, Doughnut Drake is an unlockable character skin in what PlayStation-based video game series?", "correct": "Uncharted", "options": ["Metal Gear Solid", "Crash Bandicoot", "Twisted Metal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUncharted.\n\n\t\"Uncharted\", beginning with \"Drake's Fortune\" in 2007 and continuing with \"Among Thieves\" and \"Drake's Deception\", featured fit and nimble Nathan Drake as the protagonist.  At one point in the dialogue, Drake notes cutting back on doughnuts.  Someone at Naughty Dog Development thought that was a launch pad I guess.\rIf the player completes either of the first two games in the series they have a chance of unlocking 'Doughnut Drake', a skin for the player character which makes him obese.  Both require a certain amount of medals or money to purchase and it really doesn't change anything but the outward appearance of a character whose claim to fame is treasure hunting and narrow wall-scaling.  But hey, some people like to raid doughnut boxes instead of ancient ruins... \n"}]}
