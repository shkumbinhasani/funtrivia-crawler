Mankiewicz", "options": ["Orson Welles", "Lewis Milestone", "William Wellman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoseph L. Mankiewicz\n\n\tMankiewicz won two Oscars for his work on this film, one for Best Director and one for Best Writing.

He actually intended to only cut one, and Anne Baxter was to be featured as the fourth wive, but ultimately this section of the film was sacrificed.  Too bad, Anne Baxter would have been great! \n"}, {"text": "The villain in 'A Letter to Three Wives' is a woman with the last name Ross who seems to be the most enticing bachelorette in town.  What is her first name?", "correct": "Addie", "options": ["Pattie", "Ruthie", "Sylvie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAddie.\n\n\tAddie Ross is never seen in the film.  She is the author of the letter that is read towards the beginning of the film in which she claims to have run off with one of the three wives' husbands.\r In one scene, the Linda Darnell character is looking at a picture of Addie (that the audience can't see).  It turns out that the actual picture is of Otto Preminger, a director with whom Darnell had a difficult time in another film.  Mankiewicz placed Preminger's picture there in order to get the desired emotional effect. \n"}, {"text": "Which actress provides the voice for the mysterious Ms. Ross, who never appears in person during the film?", "correct": "Celeste Holm", "options": ["Katherine Hepburn", "Vera Miles", "Janet Leigh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCeleste Holm.\n\n\tCeleste Holm's lilting voice can be overheard as a quasi-narration for the film.  Apparently, the studio ran a number of 'Who is Addie?' contests across the country to see if audience members could recognize Holm's beautiful voice. \n"}, {"text": "Now to the performers.  Contestant #1: She is Deborah Bishop, a girl from the country who has married Brad, a handsome, charming and cosmopolitan fellow who seems to be the most popular man in town.

This is largely due to her unhappy marriage to whom?", "correct": "Porter Hollingsway", "options": ["Darryl Stansbury", "Philip Hendrickson", "Thomas Newton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPorter Hollingsway.\n\n\tThe cynical Porter Hollingsway is played marvellously by Paul Douglas.  Linda Darnell is also excellent as Lora Mae Hollingsway.

However, this seems to affect Rita more than George, who takes it in stride.  Douglas is charming as George in this film, especially when he rants about the insipid nature of radio programming. \n"}, {"text": "Which actress makes an uncredited appearance as Sadie Dugan, a housekeeper for one of the families in the film?", "correct": "Thelma Ritter", "options": ["Ruth Gordon", "Agnes Moorehead", "Irene Ryan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThelma Ritter.\n\n\tThis was only six-time Academy Award nominee Thelma Ritter's second big screen appearance, her first also uncredited in 'Miracle on 34th Street'.
