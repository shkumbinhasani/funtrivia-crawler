It was here that he used inmates as test subjects in his \"research\" on heredity. He had a special interest in identical twins, dwarfs, giants, and anyone who displayed a genetic anomaly. \n"}, {"text": "Mengele was also known by which second nickname, given to him by long-time inmates at the camp?", "correct": "The White Angel", "options": ["Hell's Angel", "The Devil of D\u00fcsseldorf", "Demon of Dresden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe White Angel.\n\n\tMengele was often referred to as \"The White Angel\" because of his behavior when there were new arrivals. He would stand on an elevated platform clothed in a long sleeved white coat with his arms outstretched, evoking to some the image of a white angel. He directed most people to the left, where the gas chambers were located, for immediate extermination. Occasionally, though, he would point to the right for inmates whom he considered 'fit for work' or who interested him and appeared to be quality subjects for his experimentation. \n"}, {"text": "What item was Mengele known to carry with him whenever he walked through the camp?", "correct": "A riding crop", "options": ["A nightstick", "A notebook", "A clipboard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA riding crop.\n\n\tMengele was known to always be perfectly groomed. His uniform was always ironed and starched, his boots highly polished. And he always carried a riding crop. It was not used to beat the prisoner, rather he used it to indicate which direction a prisoner was to go. To many new prisoners he appeared impeccably dressed, often whistling operas by Wagner, and was often smiling with expectation as to what the latest shipment would bring him. \n"}, {"text": "Although not as well known, what was the name of Mengele's mentor and direct supervisor?", "correct": "Dr. Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer", "options": ["Dr. Rudolf Virchow", "Dr. Paul Erlich", "Dr. Carl Warburg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer\n\n\tDr. Otmar Freiherr von Verchuer was Mengele's mentor and they both had similar interests.

He remained a memember of the American Eugenics Society till his death in 1969. The Chief Medical Officer of Auschwitz was Dr. Eduard Wirths, the 'garrison physician'. He also was aware of Mengele's experiments and conducted his own.His experiments dealt with gynecological experiments and with typhus. He committed suicide while waiting to be tried for his war crimes.These men are mentioned so that it is known that what Mengele did was not done alone nor secret. And also that there were many who were just as guilty, just not as infamous. \n"}, {"text": "Mengele's best known experiments were done on which group of people? ", "correct": "Identical twins", "options": ["Men who had two different color eyes", "Catholic nuns", "The left handed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIdentical twins.\n\n\tMengele was fascinated by identical twins.

His pseudo-scientific experiments were done for no valid scientific reason and have led to his reputation as the epitome of the megalomaniacal mad scientist. \n"}, {"text": "The Ovitz family, a family of circus performers sparked the interest of Mengele for what reason?", "correct": "Most of them were dwarfs", "options": ["The family consisted of two sets of triplets", "They had hypertrichosis and looked like werewolves", "Most of them were albinos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMost of them were dwarfs.\n\n\tIt is possible than any of these things would have attracted the interest of Mengele, but the Ovitz family suffered from Pseudoachondriplasia dwarfism. Because of their condition and it's relative rarity Mengele treated them better than most prisoners. He built a special building for them and other dwarfs who all claimed to be related to the Ovitz family whether or not they were. They were experimented on and forced to have daily contact with Mengele. They did whatever he told them to do and thus they survived. The last member of the family died in 2001. \n"}, {"text": "Josef Mengele took meticulous notes on all his procedures.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMengele was meticulous in all aspects of his life. In 2011, over 31 of his personal notebooks, journals and manuscripts were put up for sale. These writings cover over 3,000 pages of his daily experiments and their outcomes.

The number is mind boggling. Most figures estimate he only chose about 5% of the inmates for his experiments. The others were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Of those he chose to save for his experiments only about 1/5 survived to the end of the war. This is just one reason that he was considered one of World War II's most wanted war criminals. After the end of the war, the search for Mengele lasted over 30 years. \n"}, {"text": "While trying to avoid capture Josef Mengele lived in multiple locations on which continent?", "correct": "South America", "options": ["Australia", "Africa", "North America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSouth America.\n\n\tAt the end of the war, Mengele was taken prisoner of war by the Allies, as were many Germans, but had provided the name Dr. Fritz Hollman.
