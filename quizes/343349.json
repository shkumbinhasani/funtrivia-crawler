He seems to love the new thing though, so it keeps running, even when they're asleep, to track any activity at night.  Suffice to say, bad things happen.  As it's soon discovered, any means of facilitating interest in or contact with the spirit in the house will only make it stronger.  Micah's berating of what he thinks isn't a real spirit only makes things worse.  Things escalate when he purchases a Ouija board, sets it up in the house, and leaves with an angry Katie.  The board sets on fire.\rIn other words, don't try to contact the ghosts.\r \"Paranormal Activity\" was an extremely popular release earning almost $200,000,000 on a $15,000 budget.  It was given the sequel treatment in following years due to its success. \n"}, {"text": "If you really start spending too much time with ghosts you'll end up looking back on your haunted past and spending some time in a pricey hotel.

The hotel owner (played by Samuel L. Jackson) urges him to leave, but Enslin insists and comes face to face with the ghosts and supernatural occurrences of the room, unable to escape.  Sure, he gets locked into a rather cozy hotel room, but when the spirits start playing tricks on his mind and reminding him of his dead daughter, things get a bit tense.\r \"1408\" was directed by Mikael Hafstrom (who later directed \"The Rite\" in 2011).  Upon appearing in the box office in summer 2007, it earned over $130,000,000. \n"}, {"text": "What you may consider doing is playing some games -- are the ghosts children?  Sometimes you just need to humor them a bit.\n\nIn which 2007 Spanish film does Laura reconstruct her childhood home in order to convince the local spirits, all children, to help her find her missing son?", "correct": "El Orfanato (The Orphanage)", "options": ["Cronos", "Los Ojos de Julia (Julia's Eyes)", "The Children"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEl Orfanato (The Orphanage).\n\n\tLaura's son, Simon, goes missing about halfway into the movie and certain signs seem to show that the new house, once her old orphanage, seems to contain the spirits of several of her old friends.  In order to get some answers, Laura reconstructs the children's bedroom, dresses as a matron, and cooks a complete feast for the children to bring the house to the state it once was.  The kids don't appear until she finally decides to play a game of \"Uno, Dos, Tres, Toca la Pared\" with them... and that's when they help her.\r \"El Orfanato\", also known as \"The Orphanage\", first appeared at Cannes in 2007 and won many Goya Awards in the same year.  While it was directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, the film was partially financed and produced by Mexican-Spanish director Guillermo Del Toro who, in 2001, filmed another movie about child ghosts called \"The Devil's Backbone\". \n"}, {"text": "One thing's for sure -- hurting the ghosts is a bad idea.

In the movie, Marie heads to Russia to claim her inheritance, an old cabin in the remote Russian forests, and she runs into her long-lost brother, Nikolai.  The two soon discover that they're not alone in the woods; two ghostly spirits (of themselves!) are haunting the property and when they try to fight them off, the wounds they inflict on the ghosts are inflicted upon themselves as well!\r \"The Abandoned\" received very limited release despite its originality though it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.  While the movie was set in Russia, director Nacho Cerda is from Spain, it was filmed in Bulgaria, and it premiered in Canada. \n"}, {"text": "You certainly wouldn't want to listen in on them.

When he begins investigating EVPs, communications through white noise, and he uses modern technology to isolate the sounds, he becomes obsessed with the possibility of contacting his wife once again.  What he doesn't know is that three dark figures know that he's listening in and will stop at nothing to ensure he stops.\r \"White Noise\", while critically panned, made almost $100,000,000 in the box office, justifying a sequel starring Nathan Fillion called \"White Noise 2: The Light\".  This sequel, directed by horror mainstay Patrick Lussier, was actually popular with critics. \n"}, {"text": "If you do believe you've contacted a ghost, you may want to alert somebody (if only to save trouble in the long run).\n\nIn the Australian mockumentary horror film \"Lake Mungo\" (2008), is the ghost of Alice Palmer real?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\t\"Lake Mungo\", named for the lake in Australia, is so named because it features Alice Palmer, a girl who dies shortly after visiting the titular lake on a school trip.  Much of this film is in a documentary style following her family's reaction to her death and the subsequent investigation into whether or not she's really dead.  Is Alice's ghost appearing on film footage and in photographs?  What the family finds at Luke Mungo is that yes, the ghost is real; the ghost is Alice... and she saw it too.\r \"Lake Mungo\" was from the third wave of After Dark Horrorfest films receiving a limited release thanks to Lionsgate and After Dark Films.  Directed by Joel Anderson, parts of the film capitalize on the handy-cam style while others are much more formal in presentation, creating a realistic documentary-like movie with unnerving qualities. \n"}, {"text": "Don't let them near your records!

That's when she calls a priest.  The song reappears later on in a magical realm known as The Further being played by a much-more frightening creature from beyond this plane of existence.\r \"Insidious\" was released in 2011 to positive critical response and great box office returns.  Earning almost $100,000,000, \"Insidious\" was one of the most profitable original films in the genre in its year of release.  Directed by James Wan (of \"Saw\" fame) it starred Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. \n"}, {"text": "Planning on building a house?  You may simply wish to consult the ghosts rather than move the headstones of their graves and build on top of them.\n\nThis happened in what 1982 Tobe Hooper film?", "correct": "Poltergeist", "options": ["The Haunting", "Lifeforce", "The House on Haunted Hill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoltergeist.\n\n\t\"You moved the headstones, but you didn't move the bodies!\"\rThe Freelings are pretty worried upon discovering the truth behind their house in the end of \"Poltergeist\", especially considering they'd just retrieved their daughter from another dimension located in her bedroom closet.  In the climax of the film, Steven (played by Craig T. Nelson) discovers that the housing company built the subdivision (and, subsequently, their house) on top of an old cemetery.  If you don't think that'll cause a haunting, you're deluded.  The same sort of thing happened to that hotel in Colorado -- it didn't turn out well for them either!\r \"Poltergeist\" was quite the popular movie.  Tobe Hooper had previously made \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and Steven Spielberg wrote and produced.  Making over $120,000,000 in the box office, \"Poltergeist\" became a horror staple (complete with famous quotes) and spawned two sequels. \n"}, {"text": "My suggestion: Don't even go near the ghosts.

In the original (and by original, I mean 2004 American remake) of \"The Grudge\", Karen (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) comes across the curse while working as a caretaker for an American family in Japan.  She and many others who come into contact with that particular house also meet horrible ends at the hands of Kayako and her son, Toshio (who meows like a cat).\r \"The Grudge\" was extremely successful, bouncing off the success of \"The Ring\" only a few years prior.  Based on the \"Ju-On\" series from Japan, several sequels were made (though only the second was successful).  The original made almost $200,000,000 in the box office. \n"}, {"text": "You know what?

As his mind starts to unravel, he tries to solve the mystery before it's too late.\r \"Stir of Echoes\" was David Koepp's second film, earning over $25,000,000 in the box office.  A sequel starring Rob Lowe (subtitled \"The Homecoming\") went straight to DVD about a decade later.
