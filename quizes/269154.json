{"id": "269154", "name": "\"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\" 3 Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "With the Fused Shadow Pieces complete, the completion of the Arbiter's Grounds marks the starting point of your quest for which objects?", "correct": "Shards of the Mirror of Twilight", "options": ["Yet more Fused Shadow Pieces", "Fragments of the Master Sword", "The three pieces of the Hero's Triforce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShards of the Mirror of Twilight.\n\n\tWhen the Stallord of the Arbiter's Grounds is defeated, you will be able to ascend the dungeon and reach the Mirror Chamber at the top (where you will be prompted to fight for a new Warp Point).  In this location, you will begin the final steps of the journey involving the Mirror of Twilight and its shards which can be found at the end (are they ever at the beginning) of the proceeding dungeons.  To find the first shard, already in its frame, you need to use the spinner and reach the large mechanism in the chamber to begin a cutscene. \n"}, {"text": "Who gives Link the sketch that ultimately leads him to discover the Reekfish Scent?", "correct": "Ashei", "options": ["Ralis", "Auru", "Ooccoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAshei.\n\n\tHead to Telma's Bar and get the word that one of the men assisting the princess is outside Zora's Domain in the Snowpeak Region.  You can find him there, and you can receive a sketch from him depicting a red fish.  If you ask Ralis about this, he will give you the Coral Earring which can be used to capture said fish, which is known as the Reekfish for its potent aroma.  Catch the fish in Zora's Domain, learn the scent as a wolf, and follow it through Peak Province to reach your next destination. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the fifth dungeon in the game?", "correct": "Snowpeak Ruins", "options": ["Snowstorm Ruins", "Shiverpeak Ruins", "Snowfall Ruins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnowpeak Ruins.\n\n\tWhen you reach the top of the mountain, you'll be able to follow the Reekfish Scent trail to Yeto, the friendly yeti who lives within the fifth dungeon.  He will force you to follow him down the slippery slope on a large, frozen leaf all the way to his house and he'll invite you inside.  The place is pretty much dilapidated, but unfortunately, Yeto can't deal with the repairs at the moment as his wife has fallen ill and he needs to help her get better. \n"}, {"text": "What type of food will Yeto give to you in the fifth dungeon in order for you to refill your health?", "correct": "Soup", "options": ["Biscuits", "Ice cream", "Sno-cones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSoup.\n\n\tSince Yeto's wife, Yeta, is ill in front of the fireplace in the room just behind the lobby, Yeto is preparing homemade soup to make her feel better (aw).  With the Reekfish he had earlier, he made a Simple Soup to refill two hearts per bottle.  As you progress through the dungeon, you can obtain an Ordon Pumpkin and Ordon Goat Cheese to make Good and Superb Soup, which will refill four and eight hearts respectively.  Don't have a bottle for any of it?  Make room!  This temple is sneaky in the way that you will not find a single heart throughout its corridors and courtyard at all! \n"}, {"text": "During the boss battle, what is the name of the creature that Yeta will transform into?", "correct": "Blizzeta", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlizzeta.\n\n\tAfter you make your way around the temple, obtaining the Ball and Chain (a neat new weapon to the series) and the Bedroom Key along the way, Yeta will leave her fire and show you to the boudoir where the shard of the Mirror is kept.  Unfortunately, things take a turn for the worse (and they usually do around such objects) and Yeta transforms into Twilit Ice Mass Blizzeta. Simply smash at the icy being with the Ball and Chain and avoid any shards and falling icicles that threaten your existence and you'll prevail.  You can collect the Heart Container and the Mirror Shard, and the Yetis will get back together and host snowboard races on the mountaintop. \n"}, {"text": "Who gives you the Golden Cucco in the Faron Woods?", "correct": "Rusl", "options": ["A monkey", "Coro", "Skull Kid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRusl.\n\n\tThe next step after departing from the Peak Province is returning to the Faron Woods and the Sacred Meadow.  To do this, return to the outside of the Forest Temple and meet with Rusl who will give you his prized Golden Cucco to flutter to the entrance of the Woods.  Once you arrive back in this area, you will need to have a second encounter with the Skull Kid in the clearing in the woods.  Not much has changed from the first battle, so you don't need to worry about any hidden tricks.  Make your way to the Sacred Grove after this battle. \n"}, {"text": "Who will follow you into the Temple of Time?", "correct": "Ooccoo", "options": ["The Golden Cucco", "Skull Kid", "Trill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOoccoo.\n\n\tWhen you arrive at the Sacred Meadow, you will be able to place the Master Sword back into the Pedestal of Time.  This, fortunately, will create a rip in time through the doorway just outside the chamber.  Take back the sword and head inside to go back in time to the Temple of Time.  Make your way up the stairs into the dungeon and Ooccoo will follow behind, searching for a way home.  Unfortunately, Ooccoo will be the only friendly face you encounter in the dungeon here, as the rest of itis inhabited by ancient machinery built by ancient creatures known as the Oocca. \n"}, {"text": "What item is obtained by defeating Darknut in the Temple of Time?", "correct": "Dominion Rod", "options": ["Ball and Chain", "Clawshot", "Giant Quiver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDominion Rod.\n\n\tOnce you ascend to the tallest height of the temple, you will find the master swordsman, Darknut, waiting for a duel.  This warrior won't let up during the battle, and you'll see within the first few slashes that he means business.  Find a way to utilize your heroic moves (learned throughout the land of Hyrule) and slice away at the mini-boss' armor until he finally succumbs. After the battle, the Dominion Rod will be yours to take.  You can use this object to bring certain statues to life; especially one in the very room you claimed the item, which will be useful for reaching the final boss of the dungeon. \n"}, {"text": "Which classification best describes the boss of the Temple of Time?", "correct": "Twilit Arachnid", "options": ["Twilit Dragon", "Twilit Bloat", "Twilit Igniter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwilit Arachnid.\n\n\tAfter opening the way to the boss room, you will come across a large chamber with statues in the corners of the room.  The boss inside is found on the ceiling.  It's Armogohma!  The creature is possibly a relative of the Queen Gohma found in the Great Deku Tree of \"Ocarina of Time\", but alas!  We shall never know!  This boss is kind of easy to get a hold of.  Use the Hero's Bow to shoot the creature's eye between attacks and take control of the corner statues when the beast is on the ground. Using these, simply smash the spider to a pulp.  After it's destroyed, the Gohma's eye (actually a smaller Gohma) will run around the arena. Destroy this and the battle ends.  You may now claim the third piece of the Mirror of Twilight. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Link go to get the Horse Call needed to recover Ilia's memories?", "correct": "Hidden Village", "options": ["Hyrule Castle", "Kakariko Village", "Ordon Village"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHidden Village.\n\n\tSince the Dominion Rod was powered back in the Temple of Time, it will not be powered in the present time.  Ooccoo wil alert you to the fact and you'll need to go to Hyrule Castle Town for directions on where to find Shad.  This takes you to Kakariko Village where Ilia will mention the village where she was kept and Renado will give you a letter to give to Telma. This will lead you to Doctor Borville, who led Ilia to the bar before Twilight fell.  He notes a Wooden Statue possessed by Ilia before she was found, but unfortunately, it was taken by a group of wild hounds who broke into his office.  Check the back for some spilled medicine, learn the scent, and follow it to Hyrule Field where you can fight the Stalhounds and get the statue back. Bring this to Ilia and she'll tell you about the Hidden Village and its location, which will be accessed with help from Darbus.  The bad news: the Hidden Village is filled with Bulblins. \n"}]}
