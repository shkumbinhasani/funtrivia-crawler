The courtyard side of the building was completed in 1442. Parts of the building were destroyed by fires in 1483, 1547 and again in 1577, but the rebuilding work mostly stayed true to the original design.The most significant addition was the famous Bridge of Sighs over the Rio di Palazzo: added in 1602, it connects the Palace with the 'New Prison'. The name was not actually given to the bridge until the 19th Century, when Lord Byron suggested that prisoners would sigh as they took their last view of the beautiful city as they were led away. \n"}, {"text": "Located on Bennelong Point in Sydney Harbor, close to the famous bridge, Sydney Opera House opened in 1973.

Copper is naturally an orangey-red that goes deeper red when exposed to air. \rBy 1900, the statue's copper had begun to oxidize and within six years the entire statue was the green color it appears today. \rThe statue has been closed to the public on  numerous occasions either for renovation (in 1984, the torch the statue holds was replaced) or for safety reasons (for a while after the September 11 attacks). \n"}, {"text": "Which famous statue has been vandalized numerous times?
