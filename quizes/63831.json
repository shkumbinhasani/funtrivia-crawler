An interesting tidbit I learned from Coppola's commentary on the DVD: he did not really want to direct 'The Godfather Part II,' and suggested to the studio that a young colleague of his take the reins instead. The studio executives absolutely refused Coppola's suggestion, since this 'Martin Scorsese' kid Coppola recommended was a nobody.

Tom Hagen was Consigliere to Vito Corleone throughout most of 'The Godfather,' and when Michael left Lake Tahoe for Cuba, he made Tom acting Don of the family while he was out of the country. Michael is the Don for the last third of 'The Godfather' and almost all of 'The Godfather Part II,' but he has never acted as Consigliere for anyone. \n"}, {"text": "During the meeting of contributors and politicos in Cuba, a token of friendship made of solid gold is passed around the table.
