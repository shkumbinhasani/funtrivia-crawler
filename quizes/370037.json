Quiz / Test | Environment | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " Environment", "Weather"], "questions": [{"text": "After a volcanic eruption, a colored ring of dust particles can sometimes be seen around the sun. The ring is named for which of these?", "correct": "Bishop", "options": ["Pawn", "Knight", "Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBishop.\n\n\tA bishop's ring is a ring of dust particles in the air that surrounds the sun and gives off a colored hue, variously described as bluish, reddish-brown and edged with yellow. A bishop's ring is normally seen after a strong volcanic eruption on earth. \n"}, {"text": "In the USA the measure of what hot weather feels like to an average person in different temperatures and humidities is known as what? ", "correct": "Heat Index", "options": ["Corona Envelope", "Heat Cone", "St. Elmo's Fire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeat Index.\n\n\tThe heat index uses the day's temperature and adds in the humidity for that day. Using both numbers, the heat index calculates what the temperature actually feels like for that day. For instance, if the temperature is 100 degrees outside and humidity is at 70%, the temperature outside would actually feel like it was 144 degrees. \n"}, {"text": "From 1967 to 1969, a city in which American state held the record for the most consecutive days of sunshine, at 768 days?", "correct": "Florida", "options": ["California", "Texas", "Louisiana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlorida.\n\n\tSt. Petersburg, Florida held the record of most consecutive days of sunshine with 768 days from February 9, 1967 to March 17, 1969. Yuma, Arizona has an average of 90% sunny days or 4,000 sunny hours per year. For the maximum amount of days in darkness, the South Pole has had 182 days of darkness and the North Pole has had 176 days of darkness. \n"}, {"text": "A period of extremely hot weather that happens in the Northern Hemisphere during the months of July and August goes by what nickname? ", "correct": "Dog days of summer", "options": ["Horse days of summer", "Cat days of summer", "Bird days of summer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDog days of summer.\n\n\tThe dog days of summer are normally between early July and mid August. The name of this weather phenomenon came about in Ancient Egypt when the Egyptians believed that the dog star, Sirius, which came up with the sun during the middle of the year added to the heat of the sun. \n"}, {"text": "Lightning will not strike the same person, or the same place, a second time.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLightning can and will strike the same person or the same place that it had struck previously. In one particular New York storm, lightning was recorded hitting the Empire State Building twelve times. \n"}, {"text": "A fulgurite is a piece of petrified hot lightning created when lightning hits dry sand. In what language does fulgur mean lightning? ", "correct": "Latin", "options": ["Arabic", "Spanish", "French"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLatin.\n\n\tWhen lightning hits dry sand, the heat is intense enough that it melts the sand into a glassy tube. The tubes have been recorded to be anywhere from two inches across to one-hundred feet long. Inside, the tubes are glassy while outside the tubes are rough from sand adhesion. White tubes of fulgurite are uncommon. Most fulgurites found are black or tan in color. \n"}, {"text": "A lightning bolt is six times hotter than the sun.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tA lightning bolt's temperature can be close to 54,000 degrees F (30,000 degrees C). A human can survive a lightning strike as long as the lightning does not pass through their heart or spinal column. \n"}, {"text": "In relation to lightning, what is the corona envelope? ", "correct": "Glowing discharge that surrounds lightning", "options": ["The size of the lightning stroke", "A pocket of hot air that proceeds a lightning stroke", "The size of the sun after a lightning storm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlowing discharge that surrounds lightning.\n\n\tA corona envelope is the glowing discharge of lightning that can be as wide as 10 to 20 feet. The speed of lightning can be from 100 to 1000 miles per second. The length of a stroke of lightning can be as much as twenty miles long. \n"}, {"text": "Due to what natural disaster was 1816 known around the world as the year without a summer?", "correct": "Volcanic eruption", "options": ["Worldwide hurricanes", "Record amount of tsunamis ", "Unprecedented flooding over the world "], "explanation": "\n\n\nVolcanic eruption.\n\n\tA volcano in Indonesia, named Mount Tambora, erupted spewing billions of dust particles into the stratosphere. Because the dust entered the stratosphere, heavy winds carried the particles around the world. Unseasonal temperatures were found in Europe while snow and frost plagued the New England states of the USA. \n"}, {"text": "There are several different types of lightning strokes. Which of these is a real lightning stroke?", "correct": "Forked lightning", "options": ["Spiral lightning", "Knife lightning", "Midnight lightning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForked lightning.\n\n\tThere are several different types of lightning: \r Ball lightning is lightning shaped in a white or colored sphere that is only seen for a few seconds. Streak lightning is the most common form of lightning with just a streak of white passing from the sky to the ground. \rForked lightning is two lightning branches in the sky. \rSheet lightning is a sheet of lightning flashing in the sky. \rRibbon lightning is a swirl of lightning being blown by the wind.\rHeat lightning is a flash of lightning seen on the horizon during hot weather. \n"}]}
