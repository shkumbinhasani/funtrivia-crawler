What type of object has caused Hawkeye's injury?", "correct": "A hunk of wood", "options": ["A shell fragment", "A small stone", "A shard of glass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA hunk of wood.\n\n\tMargaret literally says, 'You've got a hunk of wood in there, do you want me to take it out?'  Hawkeye responds, 'Of course I do!  If I want a souvenir I'll go to the gift shop.'  When Margaret actually does extract the wood (after some extreme and very convincing histrionics by Alan Alda) we get a look at it.  Looks very painful! \n"}, {"text": "Back at the 4077th, a call comes through to Colonel Potter's office in regards to Margaret and Hawkeye's whereabouts.  Klinger and Charles are the only people in the Colonel's office, and Klinger takes the call, which is from General Roberts.  While the hirsute Lebanese corporal hunts for Potter, Winchester takes the phone and attempts to convince the General that he has been wrongly assigned to the M*A*S*H 4077th.  The General, in turn, accuses Charles of wearing which item?", "correct": "Nylons", "options": ["A corset", "A bonnet", "High heels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNylons.\n\n\tCharles sneakily grabs the phone and connives with General Roberts about his mistaken assignment to the 4077th.  The General isn't buying Charles' story, however, and instead accuses Charles of wearing women's clothing to escape the service.  Obviously, he has Charles confused with Klinger.  He also tells Charles that he can 'take [his] application for transfer and tuck it in [his] bra until the war is over'. \n"}, {"text": "Back at the straw hut, Hawkeye and Margaret start warming the air with some friendly conversation and a touch of liquor.  Specifically, Hawkeye has brought a bottle of Scotch along with him.  From whence comes this friendly elixir?", "correct": "Japan", "options": ["Hawaii", "China", "Korea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\tI have never heard of Japanese Scotch, but apparently it exists.  Margaret, who has never been much of a teetotaller, welcomes the drink and Hawkeye's conversation.  The two of them use some small clay cups they find in the hut, one of which Hawkeye describes thusly: 'It can't be too dirty, whatever is in the bottom is still alive.' \n"}, {"text": "During their quiet conversation, Hawkeye is finally able to understand why Margaret has been so distraught.  Donald has sent her a letter that was intended for another woman.  What is this woman's name?", "correct": "Darlene", "options": ["Glenda", "Esther", "Alice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarlene.\n\n\tJust before Hawkeye and Margaret left the 4077th, Klinger delivered a letter to Margaret that made her very upset.  During the entire trip to the 8063rd and on the way back Margaret behaves in a very antagonistic manner, but refuses to reveal the source of her unhappiness until that evening.  The letter she begins reading is obviously intended for another woman, as it begins, 'My dear Darlene'. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret goes on to read the very upsetting letter to Hawkeye.  In the letter, Margaret is described in a number of unflattering ways.  What descriptive word especially bothers her?", "correct": "Sturdy", "options": ["Dependable", "Industrious", "Versatile"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSturdy.\n\n\t'My Dear Darlene', it begins, 'How long it's been since we walked together on the beach at Oahu.  I can still see the moonlight splashing on your shoulders, and hear the gentle 'woosh-woosh-woosh' of the waves.  I know you've heard I'm married.  I'm sure you'd like her.  She's competent and a hard worker.  She'll make an excellent hostess when we return to the states.  All in all, a sturdy woman.'  Hawkeye tries to look on the bright side, 'Sturdy is nice.  Sturdy can be quite, uh...'  'I mean nothing to him!' Margaret retorts.  'If I were a half-ton truck he'd be more lyrical about me.' \n"}, {"text": "Minutes after Margaret reads Hawkeye the letter from Donald, the two of them embrace and begin kissing.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, Margaret has another drink of the Scotch and then the two of them go to sleep at opposite sides of the hut.  What brings them together is a new round of bombing.  Hawkeye is forced to comfort Margaret as she has a panic attack.  As the shelling continues, both Margaret and Hawkeye shout for the bombing to stop, when suddenly they find themselves kissing each other madly.  The first episode ends at this point. \n"}, {"text": "The second episode of 'Comrades in Arms' opens in the operating room.  BJ, Colonel Potter and Father Mulcahy discuss their efforts thus far in locating the missing duo from the 4077th.  What, specifically, does Charles do to annoy BJ?", "correct": "He talks of Margaret and Hawkeye in the past tense", "options": ["He insults Hawkeye by mocking his demeanor", "He insists that the discussion of the missing Hawkeye and Margaret be terminated", "He puts his interests in getting out of the 4077th above finding Hawkeye and Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe talks of Margaret and Hawkeye in the past tense.\n\n\t'You know, his abrasive personality to one side, Pierce was a skilled surgeon.' Charles says.  BJ responds, 'Charles, it's a bit premature to be talking well of the dead.'  Charles continues, 'The truth be known, Margaret was a superior nurse.'  BJ boils over at this, 'Charles, will you quit talking about them in the past tense!?'  Charles responds stridently, 'Well how would you like me to talk about them, in the future tense?' \n"}, {"text": "Back in the shack, Hawkeye and Margaret are shown sleeping in each other's arms.  Hawkeye is the first to wake.  Upon seeing Margaret, what are the first words out of his lips?", "correct": "In mild surprise: 'Oh yeah'", "options": ["In shock and desperation: 'Oh God!'", "With great pleasure: 'Oh Good!'", "With consternation: 'Uh oh'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn mild surprise: 'Oh yeah'.\n\n\tWhile from the beginning Hawkeye acts with some hesitance about the awkward situation he now finds himself in with Margaret, she wakes up with a smile on her lips.  Margaret insists on making 'a nice big breakfast' for the two of them, and she emphasizes her new-found affection for Hawkeye with a kiss of her finger to his lips.  Clearly, Hawkeye's fear of intimacy and Margaret's passion are ruling the moment. \n"}, {"text": "As Margaret and Hawkeye share a 'continental breakfast' of crackers and jam, they let their 'true feelings' be known.  What is the only adjective that Hawkeye can find at the moment to describe his beloved Hot Lips?", "correct": "Attractive", "options": ["Pleasant", "Voluptuous", "Appealing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttractive.\n\n\tMargaret admits to Hawkeye that, in the past, when he would make jokes in the O.R., even those directed at Frank Burns, she would secretly be smiling under her mask.  When it's Hawkeye's turn to return the compliment, he suggests that he has always found Margaret to be a very 'attractive...uh, attractive person'.  'And there we were, hiding behind our masks all the time,' Margaret responds. \n"}, {"text": "Back at the 4077th we find BJ negotiating with a chopper pilot to help him search for Hawkeye and Margaret.  What is the name of the willing but reluctant flyboy?", "correct": "Doug Aylesworth", "options": ["Leonard Smollett", "Donald Levine", "Richard Isaacs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoug Aylesworth.\n\n\tBJ calls him 'Doug' at the beginning, which is interesting because Aylesworth is played by an actor called Doug Rowe.  Aylesworth agrees to work with BJ in finding the two missing M*A*S*H-ites, despite the trouble he might find with I-corps.  The search is now on!\r Join me in the third quiz of this episode series to find out what happens in the exciting conclusion of 'Comrades in Arms'.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try more of my 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
