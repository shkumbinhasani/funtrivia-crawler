Sure, conserving ammo and Green Herbs can be difficult in \"Resident Evil\" (GCN, PS1) but none of it matters if you can't defend yourself from a shark attack.  What is the name of the T-Virus-infected shark from this game?", "correct": "Neptune", "options": ["Pluto", "Uranus", "Saturn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeptune.\n\n\tNeptune can be located in the basement labs of the Spenser Mansion guest house-- you know, the best place to keep a shark-- and it's clear that this creature was experimented on.  A test subject for the T-Virus in the early days of Umbrella Corporation's trials with the compound, Neptune became a deadly creature recognized as a B.O.W., a Bio Organic Weapon.  Only two are found in the first game in the series though more show later on.\rUmbrella Corp.'s researchers knew no bounds it seems.  You can find mutant bats, fish, gorillas, dogs, and snakes (amongst others) in many of the games-- you know, to break up the zombies.  Coincidentally, they're all after you.  Nothing like a zombie apocalypse to spur a shark attack. \n"}, {"text": "That Batman, let me tell you, has it rough.  Heading into the sewers of \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" (Xbox 360, PS3), Batman needs to knock down which of these animal villains?", "correct": "Killer Croc", "options": ["Catwoman", "Firefly", "Penguin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKiller Croc.\n\n\tKiller Croc isn't an actual crocodile, but according to stories from the \"Batman\" comic strips, he was born with a horrible skin-to-scale disorder, as some villains are apt to have.  In the \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" game, Killer Croc is sent down to his 'cell' consisting of the Arkham sewers...and the place is a virtual labyrinth.  The Killer Croc is the third-to-last boss Batman will face off against in the game but to beat him you just need to hit him with the Batarang a few times, tread slowly, and preset an explosive charge.\rPenguin and Catwoman both appear in the sequel, \"Batman: Arkham City\". \n"}, {"text": "After facing off against a Masked Jungle Warrior and a Masked Machine Beast, Link visits the Great Bay Temple in \"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask\" to go head-to-head against a giant fish.  What is this boss' name?", "correct": "Gyorg", "options": ["Twinmold", "Morpha", "Jabu-Jabu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGyorg.\n\n\tLabelled as a Gargantuan Masked Fish, Gyorg is the third major boss of \"Majora's Mask\", guarding the final chamber of the Great Bay Temple (essentially a Water Temple for people who like getting more frustrated with water shifts than usual).  Off to the east of Clock Tower, the Great Bay area is seen to by Zoras and Gerudo pirates; Link must deal with both before reaching the temple using the New Wave Bossa Nova.\rGyorg is in the water surrounding a single central platform.  Avoiding falling into the water is key to your survival in this battle.  Why would you go into the water with a giant fish creature anyways?\r\"The Legend of Zelda\", as a series, has used fish bosses before.  There's a giant anglerfish in \"Link's Awakening (DX)'s\" fourth dungeon. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" (Wii), the animals of this assist trophy can cause enough distraction to send you plummeting to an early grave.  Which of these appears as an in-your-face assist?", "correct": "Nintendogs", "options": ["Nintencats", "Nintenbees", "Nintenfrogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNintendogs.\n\n\tThe Nintendogs are based on the virtual creatures of the same name from the popular series for the DS and the 3DS.  \"Nintendogs\" features lovable animals controlled entirely from your handheld giving a complete virtual pet owning experience.  It was one of the best-selling DS titles ever made.\rIn \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" (Wii), however, Nintendogs cause unnecessary hassle, sometimes even leading to death against more feisty opponents.  If the Nintendog is unleashed, a puppy will appear with his paws on your screen, blocking your view while vying for your love and affection.  Fortunately, you'll have all the time in the world to take him for a walk, play ball, or calmly pet him when you've lost your last stock life, been eliminated from battle, and thrown your controller elsewhere in anger.  By then, of course, he'll have disappeared. \n"}, {"text": "\"Moo.  Moo-moo.  Moo.\"\nIn \"Diablo 2\" (PC), a secret level harbours an udder-ly disturbing herd of animals led by which of these fictional figures wielding a polearm?", "correct": "The Cow King", "options": ["The Duke of Sows", "The Bull Lord", "Diablo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Cow King.\n\n\tThe Cow King was fought in the Secret Cow Level, a so-aptly-named location mimicking the appearance of Act I and accessed by combining Wirt's Leg (an item from Tristram) and a Tome of Town Portal in the Horadric Cube (from Act II).  You would only be able to access the level if you'd beaten the final boss of the game, clearing the difficulty, and it could be used to fight off herds and herds of angry livestock for the sake of power leveling.\rThe Cow King was known for harnessing the powers of several resistances in battle (in higher difficulties).  He would most likely be found with his envoy with a personal group of guarding cattle.  Herd mentality, you know? \n"}, {"text": "Some carry weapons and some simply push you off the towers.  In \"Catherine\" (Xbox 360, PS3), what animals prove to be a dangerous hassle, often leading to your own fatal falls, even though many of them are simply trying to survive their worst nightmares?", "correct": "Sheep", "options": ["Cows", "Goats", "Giraffes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheep.\n\n\tThe sheep of \"Catherine\" are unique in that they are actually men.  \"What?\" you may ask.  It's true.  Men are sheep-- at least in this game.  Developers at Atlus spare no details in forcing the player to encounter angry and nervous sheep while taking the role of Vincent Brooks, a man who falls asleep and enters dreams plagued by large block towers and men (resembling locals and friends) who appear as sheep (while Vincent appears as a sheep to them).\rSome sheep are angrier than others; some are more nervous than others.  It's hard to tell which are less dangerous to be around.  One thing is for certain: you'll want to reach the top, sheep or no sheep, and you'll want to avoid others at all costs. \n"}, {"text": "In earlier \"Mario\" games, these animals caused problems when they burst up from underground and started to waddle across the land.  Which of these creatures would do this?", "correct": "Monty Mole", "options": ["Bombfish", "Buzzy Beetles", "PatrolMeow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonty Mole.\n\n\tMonty Moles were introduced in \"Super Mario World\" (SNES) as a straightforward enemy.  Larger, less easy-to-kill moles known as Mega Moles were also found in later levels.  Although these enemies were more prominent in this early game, their appearances in later titles were usually restricted to niche levels and roles (eg. \"Super Mario 64's\" Hazy Maze Cave, cannons in \"Super Mario Sunshine\", etc.).\rSurprisingly, many of the enemies of the \"Mario\" series, while animal-like, are explicitly referred to as animals.  Koopas, for example, seem to appear as turtles but they have so many different versions, including some with wings, that it would be foolish to generalize. \n"}, {"text": "Stopping off at Jolly Roger's Lagoon in \"Banjo-Tooie\" (N64), you'll need to take on an angry anglerfish underwater.  What is this boil-covered creature's name?", "correct": "Lord Woo Fak Fak", "options": ["Clanker", "Targitzan", "Captain Blubber"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLord Woo Fak Fak.\n\n\tDescribed as a Self-Important Anglerfish, Lord Woo Fak Fak is the boss found inside Davy Jones' locker in Jolly Roger's Lagoon.  During battle against this large fish, Banjo and Kazooie need to use the newly-found Talon Torpedo attack or launch grenade eggs at the boils glowing on the Lord's body.  When these are destroyed, the fish will open his eyes, making them the new target.  After these are attended to, the battle will end.\rSurprisingly, this is the only animal boss in \"Banjo-Tooie\", a game in which a bear and a bird play the main characters.  They also battle dragons, a robot witch doctor, Old King Coal, and an inflatable dragon.  You know-- the usual. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Donkey Kong 64\", Donkey Kong faces off against which armored boss (twice!) in battle?", "correct": "Armydillo", "options": ["Mole Train", "Master Necky", "Krow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArmydillo.\n\n\tIn the first and sixth stages of this N64 platformer title, Jungle Japes and Crystal Caves, Donkey Kong is selected from the five available Kongs to face off, head-to-head, against a giant, armored armadillo aptly-named Armydillo.  And, you know, he has armor and missile cannons.  The usual.\rSmaller armadillo enemies in the series are known as Armies.  They were originally seen in \"Donkey Kong Country\" (SNES) before they were replaced in subsequent games by newer creatures (eg. Snakes, Spiders, Tiki creatures).  Most of the creatures in the \"Donkey Kong\" platformers are animals; many are actually friends. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Ocarina of Time\" (N64, DS) from the \"Legend of Zelda\" series, one unorthodox evil animal is spurned into action when you attack it with a sword.  What otherwise harmless (and often helpful) creature will swarm when provoked?", "correct": "Chicken", "options": ["Cat", "Dog", "Pig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChicken.\n\n\tWhether you slash it with your sword or smash it with a Megaton Hammer swing, the humble chicken (known as a Cucco) will certainly show you who's boss in this classic N64 game.  Although these tame fowl are normally quite useful, allowing Link to glide from high perches and reach otherwise inaccessible secrets...say in Kakariko Village...provoking them with the fear of battle will cause them to emit a shrill cock-a-doodle-doo of death.  This will, in turn create a swarm of angry chickens which won't let up until you flee the area.  These can kill you.\rThere's no way to kill the chickens of this game-- even flinging them into waterways will only result in their...somehow...ability to fly.  You've been warned. \n"}]}
