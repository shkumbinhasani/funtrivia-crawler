Woody said he's confused. Norm takes one of Cliff's dollars (who's not in the room at the time) and rips it up showing how as years go by the dollar becomes smaller and smaller. Carla then takes a twenty dollar bill out of Cliff's wallet to show the same principal (but in her case it was mainly to rid Cliff of a greater sum of money). \n"}, {"text": "What kind of insurance did Sam have?", "correct": "Hair", "options": ["Foot", "Facial ", "Arm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHair.\n\n\tSam loved his hair so much he even had it insured.

The game Norm had was a mixture of other game pieces because he lost the original pieces throughout the years. The funniest part (in my opinion) was the giant fuzzy dice used to replace the original dice. \n"}, {"text": "Who went to Robin's apartment to tell Rebecca that Robin would be 3 hours late?", "correct": "Sam", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tCarla was going to call Rebecca.
