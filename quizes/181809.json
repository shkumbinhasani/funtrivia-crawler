{"id": "181809", "name": "My Favorite Westerns Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Westerns and Gangster Films"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of my favorite westerns features the following characters in a love/revenge quadrangle that ends in an epic gunfight: Cheyenne, Frank, Jill McBain and Harmonica?", "correct": "Once Upon a Time in the West", "options": ["For a Few Dollars More", "Fistful of Dollars", "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West.\n\n\tAll of the films listed were 'spaghetti westerns', directed by the Italian master Sergio Leone.  'Once Upon a Time in the West' (or 'C'era una volta il West') was released in 1968, and featured the acting talents of Jason Robards (as Cheyenne), Henry Fonda (as Frank), Claudia Cardinale (as Jill McBain) and Charles Bronson (as Harmonica).  This is truly a western film classic, a must-see for all fans of the genre! \n"}, {"text": "Much of the 1956 film 'The Searchers', directed by John Ford, was filmed in which of these wonderful locations?", "correct": "Monument Valley, Utah", "options": ["Zion Canyon, Utah", "Valley of Fire, Nevada", "Grand Canyon, Arizona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonument Valley, Utah.\n\n\tJohn Ford made Monument Valley famous in various westerns with his sweeping landscape shots.  Perhaps the most magnificent of his films, in terms of the cinematography, is 'The Searchers', which features the acting talents of John Wayne, Jeffrey Hunter, Vera Miles, Ward Bond and Natalie Wood. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1943 film 'The Ox-bow Incident', starring Henry Fonda as Gil Carter, three men are accused of killing a local cattle rancher.  Which of these actors was NOT involved in the project?", "correct": "Burt Lancaster", "options": ["Dana Andrews", "Harry Morgan", "Anthony Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurt Lancaster.\n\n\tHarry Morgan plays Fonda's pal Art Croft, while Anthony Quinn and Dana Andrews play two of the three accused men, Juan Martinez and Donald Martin, respectively.  I won't give away any spoilers, but will suggest that this is a good film for those interested in mob mentality. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1952 movie 'High Noon', Gary Cooper plays a marshall who must stand alone against several adversaries.  What is the name of the town that Will Kane (the Cooper character) must defend in this excellent drama?", "correct": "Hadleyville", "options": ["Council Bluff", "Coaltown", "Brownsburg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHadleyville.\n\n\t'High Noon' features a number of interesting performances from an all-star cast.  Appearing alongside Cooper are Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges, Harry Morgan (again!), Lon Chaney Jr., Katy Jurado, Lee van Cleef, Otto Kruger and Jack Elam.  Interestingly, this film was created in reaction to Hollywood blacklisting efforts, allegorizing those brave enough to stand up against the activities of the HUAC. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1962 John Ford classic 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', who plays the title character, Liberty Valance?", "correct": "Lee Marvin", "options": ["Charles Bronson", "Yul Brynner", "Steve McQueen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLee Marvin.\n\n\tLee Marvin really hams it up in this John Ford masterpiece, also featuring Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne, along with Vera Miles, Lee van Cleef and Woody Strode.  Notice that the other choices I gave you were all actors featured in 'The Magnificent Seven'?  Of course you did! \n"}, {"text": "A wicked fellow named Little Bill Daggett is the chief villain in which of my favorite westerns that features a corrupt sheriff facing off against an aging hired gun?", "correct": "Unforgiven", "options": ["Nevada Smith", "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", "Rio Grande"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnforgiven.\n\n\tAny fan of western films must at least be familiar with the 1992 Clint Eastwood-directed film 'Unforgiven'.  One of the rare western films that received an Oscar for Best Picture ('Cimmaron' and 'Dances with Wolves' are two others), 'Unforgiven' pits Gene Hackman (as Little Bill) against Clint Eastwood (as William Munny).  We all benefit from their performances, along with those of Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite westerns is the 2003 film 'Open Range', which was directed by and starred which Hollywood icon?", "correct": "Kevin Costner & Costner", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin Costner & Costner.\n\n\tCostner, who won a Best Director Oscar for the 1990 film 'Dances with Wolves', created yet another excellent western in 2003 with his 'Open Range'.  The film also includes Robert Duvall as Boss Spearman and Annette Bening as Sue Barlow (both top-notch performances).  Even Kevin Costner himself puts in a great acting performance as the gunman Charley Waite.  If you haven't seen it, now is the time to have a look! \n"}, {"text": "One of the all-time classic westerns, this John Ford film also happens to be the favorite of 'M*A*S*H' character Colonel Potter.  Which film, featuring Henry Fonda, fits this bill?", "correct": "My Darling Clementine", "options": ["How the West Was Won", "The Grapes of Wrath", "The Ox-Bow Incident"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Darling Clementine.\n\n\tJohn Ford and Henry Fonda collaborated in a number of great films, including the 1946 classic 'My Darling Clementine', which tells the tale of the run-up to the gunfight at the OK Corral.  Fonda plays Wyatt Earp in the film, while Victor Mature portrays Doc Holliday.  The film also features the usual John Ford gang...Ward Bond, Walter Brennan and Jane Darwell, among others.  Wouldn't it have been funny if Colonel Potter's favorite film was 'The Ox-Bow Incident', considering that Harry Morgan co-starred? \n"}, {"text": "Which of these actors, commonly featured in films of the western genre, won not one, but three Best Actor in a Supporting Role Oscars?", "correct": "Walter Brennan", "options": ["Jack Elam", "Ward Bond", "Eli Wallach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalter Brennan.\n\n\tWalter Brennan was the only actor to win three such awards in the 20th century.  Ironically, only one of his three Oscars were awarded for a role in a western, that being the 1941 film 'The Westerner' (as Judge Roy Bean).  His other two awards were for the 1936 drama 'Come and Get It' and the 1938 drama 'Kentucky'. \n"}, {"text": "John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and Walter Brennan were all featured in the 1959 film 'Rio Bravo', directed by Howard Hawks.  In one scene, all but one of these actors participates in a singalong.  Which actor is the exception?", "correct": "John Wayne", "options": ["Ricky Nelson", "Dean Martin", "Walter  Brennan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Wayne.\n\n\tCan you just imagine the Duke singing alongside Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson?  Neither can I!  Walter Brennan does sing with the two stars of the music world as they punch out the songs 'My Rifle, My Pony and Me' and 'Cindy'.  Dean Martin also sings the title song for the film.  Thank you for playing, I hope you enjoyed the quiz and will try more of my stuff in the future. \n"}]}
