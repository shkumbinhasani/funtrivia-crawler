Between 1989-1992 he made 89 appearances for The Hornets. He has since played for Liverpool (making his england debut in 1997 while he was at Anfield), Aston Villa, West Ham, Manchester City and Portsmouth.\rChesterfield produced Gordon Banks, England's greatest ever goalkeeper (voted the 2nd-greatest of all-time behind Russia's Lev Yashin). Banks also played for both Leicester City and Stoke City, as did another great England #1, Peter Shilton. \n"}, {"text": "Representing great England full-backs is 'Psycho', Stuart Pearce. Which of the clubs listed did he NOT play for?", "correct": "Fulham", "options": ["West Ham United", "Newcastle United", "Coventry City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFulham.\n\n\tMost people will remember Pearce with Nottingham Forest, where he made over 400 appearances between 1985 and 1997. (He was also player-manager for his last year at the City Ground.) Stuart's time at Forest was after the club's real glory days but still mostly during the Clough era. Pearce played in three Wembley finals for Forest, losing 2-1 in the 1991 FA Cup Final against Spurs, but winning two League Cup Finals (3-1 over Luton in 1989 and 1-0 against Oldham 1990).\rStuart began his career in relative obscurity, playing for semi-pro Wealdstone for six years before joining Coventry City in 1983. After leaving Forest in 1997, he played for Newcastle United (37 games), West Ham United (42) and Manchester City (38). He also returned later to manage Manchester City (2005-2007). \n"}, {"text": "With which Scottish club did England centre-back Terry Butcher finish his playing career?", "correct": "Clydebank", "options": ["Glasgow Rangers", "Partick Thistle", "Motherwell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClydebank.\n\n\tAlthough born in Singapore, the image of Terry Butcher playing with his head strapped in a blood-soaked bandage is one of the most enduring in England's international footballing history (September 1989, in a World Cup qualifier in Sweden). An uncompromising defender, he spent ten years with Ipswich Town and four with Glasgow Rangers before going into semi-retirement as player-manager with Coventry City. He then spent two years as player-manager at Sunderland before finishing his illustrious playing career with Clydebank.\rAfter almost a decade out of the game, Butcher returned in 2002 as the manager of Motherwell, where he stayed for four years. Stints as manager of Sydney FC in Australia, as assistant-manager at Patrick Thistle, as manager of Brentford and as assistant manager of the Scottish national team have followed. \n"}, {"text": "Another uncompromising defender, another England legend at centre-back, 'The Giraffe', Jack Charlton. A one-club man as a player, which Yorkshire club did he manage?", "correct": "Sheffield Wednesday", "options": ["Sheffield United", "Leeds United", "Barnsley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday.\n\n\tBorn into a footballing family in Ashington, Northumberland in 1935, Jack was doing National Service and then working down the mines while his younger brother, Bobby, was establishing himself at Manchester United. In a 21-year career as a player from 1952-1973, Charlton played 774 games for Leeds United, contributing 96 goals (not bad for a defender). Although Charlton played only 35 times for England, he was a key member of the most significant England team ever, the 1966 World Cup Final winners.\rIn 1973, he became manager of second division Middlesborough. He earned promotion by such a margin that he won the Manager of the Year award, the first time ever for a manager outside the top division. In 1977, he took over at third division Sheffield Wednesday and promptly led them to promotion. He stayed at Hillsborough for six years before returning briefly to Middlesborough and then spending a year in charge at Newcastle United. \rIn 1986, Charlton began a 10-year stint as an honorary Irishman, managing the Republic's national team. His tenure included a famous victory over England at the 1988 European Championships and, two years later, qualification for the World Cup Finals for the first time in Ireland's history. \n"}, {"text": "England midfield: What is Steven Gerrard's middle name?", "correct": "George", "options": ["Edward", "William", "James"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge.\n\n\tMerseyside native Steven George Gerrard was born in 1980 in Whiston, less than 10 miles from Liverpool city centre. He played his first match for Liverpool in 1998, and two years later made his England debut against Ukraine. Gerrard and fashion journalist Alex Curren share their wedding anniversary with two other England internationals, Michael Carrick and Gary Neville. \n"}, {"text": "Legendary England midfielder Bryan Robson retired as the longest-serving captain in Manchester United history, but from which club did United sign him?", "correct": "West Bromwich Albion", "options": ["Sheffield United", "Middlesborough", "Bradford City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWest Bromwich Albion.\n\n\tBorn in Chester-le-Street, County Durham in 1957, Robson joined West Bromwich Albion's youth program as a 15-year old and made hist first-team debut in 1975. He played 198 games, scoring 40 goals, for the Baggies before leaving for Old Trafford in 1981. He earned 90 England caps scoring 26 times. After 13 years, 345 appearances and 74 goals with United, Robson left in 1994 to become player-manager at Middlesborough. Managerial spells with West Brom, Bradford City and Sheffield United followed. \n"}, {"text": "This midfield player is another of the \"Heroes of '66\", Alan Ball. The little red-haired dynamo changed clubs 10 times during his career, but for which club was he playing when he won his World Cup winner's medal? ", "correct": "Blackpool", "options": ["Everton", "Arsenal", "Southampton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlackpool.\n\n\tBorn Alan James Ball jr in 1945 in Farnworth, Lancashire, Ballie was turned down by Bolton Wanderers because he was too small. He subsequently signed for Blackpool and made his debut in 1962. It was only after his performance at the 1966 World Cup Finals that the bigger clubs took an interest, and Ball signed for Everton in August 1966. In 208 appearances for the Toffees, Ball scored a remarkable (for a midfielder) 66 times and was instrumental in the Championship win in 1970. In 1971, Arsenal paid a then-record \u00a3220,000 for Ball. Injuries restricted him to 177 games in his five years at Highbury. Then came a 3-year spell at Southampton, where he played 132 matches. The last five years of Ball's playing career saw him continuously on the move -- The Philadelphia Fury and the Vancouver Whitecaps in North America, returns to both Blackpool and Southampton, Eastern AA in Hong Kong and, finally, Bristol Rovers. \rBall also tried his hand at management starting out, fittingly, at Blackpool once again. Spells in charge at Portsmouth, Stoke City, Exeter City, Southampton and Manchester City followed before he completed the circle with a return to Portsmouth.  \rIn 2005, Ball auctioned his World Cup winners' medal and commemorative cap to raise money for his family -- they raised a staggering \u00a3140,000. At the age of just 61, Ball died of a heart attack at his home in Hampshire in April 2007. He was the second of the 1966 team to die, following captain Bobby Moore (he died in February 1993). \n"}, {"text": "Just to prove that this quiz is not just about England's greatest players, I've picked out \"a donkey\" to represent the forward line -- Emile Heskey. For which of the listed clubs has Heskey NOT played?", "correct": "Derby County", "options": ["Wigan Athletic", "Liverpool", "Birmingham City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDerby County.\n\n\tBorn Emile William Ivanhoe Heskey in Leicester in 1978, Heskey reached the notable landmark collection of 50 international caps in the World Cup qualifier against Belarus in October 2008. What is perhaps more remarkable is that a striker could reach such a landmark with only five international goals to his name.\rIn his earlier days with Leicester City, Heskey was one of the most feared strikers in the game. In 154 appearances for the Foxes, he scored 40 goals. His \u00a311 million move to Liverpool never really lived up to the hype, although in truth his record at Anfield was not much different from that with Leicester (39 goals in 150 appearances). Heskey moved to Birmingham City in 2004 and them to Wigan Athletic in 2006, and although big clubs seemed to have lost interest in him, repeated England managers had not. \n"}, {"text": "From the ridiculous to the truly sublime, and one of the greatest players ever to wear an England shirt, Jimmy Greaves. For which Italian giant did he briefly play in 1961?", "correct": "A.C. Milan", "options": ["Juventus", "Inter Milan", "Lazio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA.C. Milan\n\n\tBorn James Peter Greaves in East Ham, London in 1940, Jimmy Greaves was little short of a goalscoring machine. He scored on his Chelsea debut in 1957, became the youngest player ever to score 100 League goals in England, scored a club-record 41 times in the 1960-61 season, and left with 124 goals in 157 games for The Blues. Although he scored nine times in 14 games for AC Milan, the experiment did not work out and Greavesie was soon back in London, Spurs signing him for \u00a399,999 so that he would not have the pressure of being the first \u00a3100,000 player. \rIn nine years at White Hart Lane, Greaves scored a club record 266 goals in only 379 matches. During his career, he topped the goal scorers list in the top English division a record six times. That he only played 57 matches for England is a mystery. That he scored a remarkable 44 goals in 57 matches is phenomenal. Note that Bobby Charlton retired as England's all-time record goalscorer with 49, and it took him 106 matches to amass that total. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most popular players ever to wear the Three Lions -- sort of the footballing equivalent to David Gower -- Gary Lineker. For which club did he play between leaving Leicester City and joining Barcelona?", "correct": "Everton", "options": ["Nottingham Forest", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Manchester United"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEverton.\n\n\tGary Winston Lineker was born in Leicester in 1960. Younger football fans may only know him as the face of BBC's 'Match of the Day', but the man was a born goalscorer. His scoring record for England is second only to Charlton in number of goals (48 to Charlton's 49) and to Greaves in terms of strike rate (Lineker scored 48 times in 80 international matches, Greaves scored 44 in 57 matches). He was the first England player ever to win the World Cup 'Golden Shoe' (in 1986) as top scorer in the Finals. Lineker is also one of the 'nice guys' -- ie a career spanning more than 450 matches, he received a grand total of ZERO yellow cards. \rLineker spent the first seven years of his career with his hometown Leicester City, scoring 95 times in 197 games. A brief spell at Everton (41 games, 30 goals) was followed by a high-profile move to Barcelona following the 1986 World Cup. He scored 21 times in his first season in Spain, including a hat-trick against Real Madrid, but returned to England after two three years, where he rounded out his domestic playing career with Spurs. \n"}]}
