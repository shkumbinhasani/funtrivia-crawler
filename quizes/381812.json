{"id": "381812", "name": "All the Stories Are Real Quiz / Test | Mixed Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Mixed Literature", "Literary Titles"], "questions": [{"text": "What 1996 novel by Jon Krakauer chronicled the final days of Christopher McCandless, who died in Alaska?", "correct": "Into the Wild", "options": ["One Man's Wilderness", "On the Road Again", "The Milepost"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInto the Wild.\n\n\t\"Into the Wild\" actually discusses many adventurous travellers heading off into the wilderness for whatever reasons, but it focuses most of its story on Christopher McCandless, who actually did head to Alaska, living in an abandoned bus for nearly four months before dying, likely due to the consumption of poisonous seeds.  Although based on a true story, Krakauer's account (and his retracing of McCandless' steps) can only be considered speculative due to the second-hand narrative.  The story was adapted for film by Sean Penn in 2007; it was nominated for two Academy Awards. \n"}, {"text": "What 2010 Emma Donoghue book was based on the case of Elisabeth Fritzl, who was imprisoned for two and half decades in a concealed chamber?", "correct": "Room", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoom.\n\n\tIn a horrifying true case, Elisabeth Fritzl was held captive for a significant period of time in the basement of an Austrian house, ultimately mothering seven children to her own father and raising several of them on her own (others were raised by her father and his wife).  She was finally able to escape in 2008 when one of her daughters needed to be rushed to the hospital. Author Emma Donoghue used this story as the basis for her award-winning novel \"Room\", which follows a mother and son as they try to escape captivity.  The adaptation of \"Room\" resulted in an Academy Award win for Brie Larson (for Best Actress). \n"}, {"text": "What 1997 book attempts to recreate the final voyage of the Andrea Gail off the coast of Massachusetts?", "correct": "The Perfect Storm", "options": ["Day Four", "Island of the Lost", "Life of Pi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Perfect Storm.\n\n\tOccurring during a 1991 storm created when a nor'easter merged with Hurricane Grace in the North Atlantic, 'The Perfect Storm' claimed the lives of the entire crew of the fishing vessel Andrea Gail.  Written by journalist Sebastian Junger, \"The Perfect Storm\" outlined the lives of its crew before and during the tragedy, speculating on the possibilities as to what occurred while at sea.  The film adaptation, released in 2000, starred George Clooney.  While the book was based on true events, there was controversy as to the the validity of Junger's research soon after the book's release. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these novels released in the 1950s mirrored the serial killings of Ed Gein?", "correct": "Psycho", "options": ["Helter Skelter", "The Hypnotist", "In Cold Blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPsycho.\n\n\tWhile not so much a story based on true events, Robert Bloch, the author of \"Psycho\", ended up writing his book around the same time (and only a short distance away from) Ed Gein's serial killings.  In fact, Gein was arrested shortly before the book was published, leading to influences late on in the novel.  In both the novel and real life, a schizophrenic killer murders women.  \"Psycho\" is best known in its cinematic form; Alfred Hitchcock released it as a popular horror movie in 1960. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Cheryl Strayed's memoir, released in 2012, about traveling the Pacific Crest Trail?", "correct": "Wild", "options": ["Live", "Brave", "Walk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWild.\n\n\t\"Wild\" was a major success for Strayed, who, in 1995, walked more than a thousand miles along the Pacific Crest Trail and recounted her story in her non-fiction book.  After its release in 2012, the book was quickly picked up by Oprah's Book Club (2.0) building not one, but two lengthy stints on the New York Times Bestseller List.  Reese Witherspoon produced and starred in the film adaptation of the story; she was subsequently nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars, losing out to Julianne Moore in \"Still Alice\" (another adapted work). \n"}, {"text": "What non-fiction book, written as a narrative by Erik Larson, followed both the Chicago World's Fair and the murder spree of H. H. Holmes?", "correct": "Devil in the White City", "options": ["In The Garden of Beasts", "Dead Wake", "Thunderstruck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDevil in the White City.\n\n\t\"The Devil in the White City\" was cleverly written, taking on a number of different actual events during and around 1893 as the World's Fair, in Chicago that year, made America the host of the world.  While much of the story followed the true events that occurred during the troubled construction and execution of the innovative fair, it was also interspersed with the goings-on of H. H. Holmes who, during the same time period, murdered hundreds of people in his elaborately-constructed hotel. \n"}, {"text": "What 1993 novel followed Susanna Kaysen's experiences while in a mental hospital?", "correct": "Girl, Interrupted", "options": ["Kiss the Girls", "The Girl With the Pearl Earring", "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGirl, Interrupted.\n\n\t\"Girl, Interrupted\", written by Kaysen about her voluntary eighteen months in an institution for borderline personality disorder, became a popular book quite soon after its release because of its approach to mental issues and psychiatric treatment.  The book got the Hollywood treatment in 1999, garnering Angelina Jolie the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  That said, Kaysen ardently opposed the screenplay because of the liberties it took in changing her memoir. \n"}, {"text": "What 2013 book recounts the tsunami that occurred in Sri Lanka and the devastating psychological aftermath?", "correct": "Wave", "options": ["Lost", "Water", "Coast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWave.\n\n\t\"Wave: Life and Memories after the Tsunami\", was written as a first hand account of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean which killed hundreds of thousands in Sri Lanka and other coastal locales.  Written by Sonali Deraniyagala, the memoir began with the tsunami and followed the author back home to London where, haunted by grief and loss, she contemplated suicide.  The novel won numerous awards for its psychological insight and powerful narrative. \n"}, {"text": "What 1991 graphic novel by Art Spiegelman (featuring anthropomorphic characters) depicts his father's tales of the Holocaust?", "correct": "Maus", "options": ["Berlin", "Breakdowns", "Seconds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaus.\n\n\tAlthough the characters of \"Maus\" are all animals, the emotional resonance isn't lessened; Spiegelman draws out the events of the Holocaust in volumes, framing his narrative using his present self (as a mouse) and following his father and his family through World War II, specifically through the concentration camps.  While, on the surface, the books may seem unassuming, they recount the true tales of horrific tragedy in the 1940s.  Spiegelman won the Pulitzer for his work. \n"}, {"text": "What Dan Simmons horror novel released in 2007 fictionalizes the otherwise true voyage of Sir John Franklin's final attempt to find the Northwest Passage in the 1840s?", "correct": "The Terror", "options": ["Carrion Comfort", "The Abominable", "Black Hills"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Terror.\n\n\tFollowing the HMS Erebus and the HMS Terror through the arctic, the story takes place over a few years as sailors plot their way through the Northwest Passage and get trapped in the ice, eventually leading them all to perish.  This is all true, but where Simmons' story deviates is in the specific events of the narrative.  A mysterious Inuit demon stalks the crew and thoughts of mutiny abound.  Simmons has also written horror novels themed around World War II, George Mallory's ascent of Everest, and Charles Dickens' last book. \n"}]}
