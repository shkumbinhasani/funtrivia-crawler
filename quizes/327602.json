{"id": "327602", "name": "Ten Mysteries of \"The Diabolical Box\" Quiz / Test  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games L-P", "Professor Layton Games"], "questions": [{"text": "According to legend, the Elysian Box kills whoever opens it.  Do Professor Layton and Luke locate and open the box?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tProfessor Layton and Luke do, in fact, locate the box when it is dropped in their hotel by a certain masked assailant.  Said culprit was, however, not responsible for killing Dr. Schrader in his apartment so it is assumed that the mystery behind the box and its curse still hold true.  When they return to their hotel room and open it, they find that both nothing is inside and that they are still alive.  Professor Layton has his suspicions though.\rIt turns out that traces of hallucinogenic gases in the ore used to make the box were responsible for Dr. Schrader's death and that it was, in fact, just a box.  No curse.\rWhen Layton gives the box back to its rightful owner, Anton, they realize that there is another way to open it (outlined by puzzle #138).  Inside, as it turns out, there is a letter.  After the game is complete, it turns out that Dr. Schrader made a full recovery through a miracle cure. \n"}, {"text": "Professor Layton and Luke both discover a ticket in the hands of Dr. Schrader.  For what destination is the ticket?", "correct": "Folsense", "options": ["Dropstone", "Luxenbelle", "St. Mystere"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFolsense.\n\n\tWhen Layton and Luke find Dr. Schrader dead in his apartment, they discover that he is in possession of a weird ticket for a ride on the Molentary Express.  Although the cryptic ticket doesn't really explain their destination, the two of them crack the puzzle behind it in a long tunnel.  As it turns out, the ticket itself was another riddle and their destination was the so-called phantom town of Folsense. They deduce that the doctor must've visited this location, only accessible by riding in the deluxe car of the Molentary Express as you cross through the tunnel.  Coincidentally, Luke, Layton, and Flora all fell asleep in the deluxe car at this point in time. \n"}, {"text": "The third mystery of the game is a Torn Photo found in Dr. Schrader's apartment.  Inspector Chemley takes the photo before Professor Layton and Luke can look at it.  When Chemley's pocket rips open, how many pieces of the photograph must be obtained?", "correct": "Sixteen", "options": ["Ten", "Twelve", "Twenty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSixteen.\n\n\tInspector Chemley, investigating the northeast corner of Folsense, has his jacket pocket ripped open by a hungry dog.  Unfortunately, this causes him to lose pieces of a torn and confiscated photo from Dr. Schrader's apartment.  He gives Professor Layton and Luke the first piece, but they need to find the other fifteen around town (for a total of sixteen).  The last of these pieces is found at the forest gate in the northwest end of town and the duo must solve Puzzle #116 in order to construct the image: The Elysian Box itself. Unfortunately, the middle piece of the photo, distinguishing the animal on the top of the box, blows away in the wind. This, inadvertently, ends up helping Professor Layton discover the culprit behind the box's theft. \n"}, {"text": "One mystery is that of the Elysian Box's location.  Who was in possession of it this whole time?", "correct": "Don Paolo", "options": ["Flora", "Mr. Beluga", "Inspector Chemley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon Paolo.\n\n\tAfter Professor Layton and Luke determine the image in the torn photograph, they are called to the hotel in Folsense to witness Inspector's Chemley's unveiling of the culprit.  Although Chemley claims that Sammy Thunder, the conductor of the Molentary Express and Mr. Beluga's nephew, is the culprit, Professor Layton uses the photograph (minus the missing piece) to determine that Flora is, in fact, the one behind it all. Flora reveals herself to be Don Paolo in disguise.  The real Flora had been kidnapped back in Dropstone and placed in a barn for the duration.  Don Paolo escapes, but drops the Elysian Box in the hotel in his hasty exit revealing that he had it the whole time. \n"}, {"text": "The fifth mystery of the game revolves around Tom, who has gone missing on the train.  Who or what is Tom?", "correct": "Babette's dog", "options": ["Babette's son", "Flora, in disguise", "Chemley's assistant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBabette's dog.\n\n\tIn the first chapter of the game, Tom goes missing and rich socialite Babette commissions Inspector Chemley to find him.  Professor Layton and Luke decide to make finding Tom on the train a priority.  Along the way, they find a tiny shoe in one of the car hallways, a small hat in a narrow compartment of the dining car's kitchen, and scraps on the floor in Babette's room.  When Luke and Layton deduce that Tom is, in fact, a dog, they find Tom in Flora's arms on the observation deck at the rear of the train.  If you give Tom back to Babette, she gives you a pet house for your hamster. \n"}, {"text": "Another mystery of the game regards Katia, a girl from Dropstone who appears to have a connection to the Elysian Box.  How is she related to Anton?", "correct": "She is his granddaughter", "options": ["She is his daughter", "She is his niece", "She is his wife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe is his granddaughter.\n\n\tKatia is Mr. Andrerson's daughter and Professor Layton and Luke first hear about her in Dropstone.  When they board the Molentary Express on their way to Luxenbelle, she also boards and (apparently) reaches the phantom town in the deluxe car.  Many of the people in Dropstone see her off.  Katia appears many times in Folsense; she's even one of Inspector Chemley's suspects. She claims that she needs the box when it's found, but she is interrupted.  Layton and Luke find her in Herzen Castle when they attempt to make their escape and she reveals everything, including the fact that she is Anton's granddaughter as opposed to what everyone was led to believe. She explains that Sophia, her grandmother, left Folsense \n"}, {"text": "Mystery #7 is unveiled when Professor Layton and Luke arrive in the so-called phantom town.  What structure does this mystery involve?", "correct": "Train station", "options": ["Bank", "Hotel", "Museum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrain station.\n\n\tThough the train station is the only structure outlined by this mystery, much of Folsense applies.  After discovering the truth behind this phantom town, Professor Layton and Luke discover that their image of Folsense, a town fifty years old, is actually caused by the effects of the hallucinogenic gases emerging from the mines under the city. Viewing pictures throughout the town (including within the train station) has allowed them to form the image in their own minds of what the town looks like.  This is why the city is both covered in a dense fog and why certain parts of the city are much worse-off than others. When the Castle is destroyed, both Anton and the phantom town return to normal. \n"}, {"text": "At one point, Professor Layton and Luke discover that the Molentary Express' owner, Mr. Beluga, is searching for something.  What do they discover he is looking for?", "correct": "The Elysian Box", "options": ["A rare book", "His daughter", "The phantom town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Elysian Box.\n\n\tAlthough somewhat obvious as per his and Sammy Thunder's actions throughout the game, Mr. Beluga detached the second (deluxe) car of the Molentary Express and rode the train to Folsense to determine the location of the Elysian Box.  A member of the Herzen family, he felt entitled to the vast fortunes left behind in the city although many of its citizens feel that he is not.  He reveals his true motives when the Elysian Box makes an appearance in the Folsense hotel. \n"}, {"text": "Did Herzen Castle actually contain vampires?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tSpeaking to people around town, Professor Layton and Luke fall under the impression that vampires reside in Herzen Castle.  Many of the other citizens of Folsense recognize this as well and one man, Geoff, actually sells garlic in one of the shops.  When the duo find themselves staying the night in the castle, Anton (and others) pretend to be vampires to scare them away.  After escaping from the basement of the castle, Luke and Layton later realize that Anton is not actually a vampire- the whole scheme was made up to protect the Herzen Fortune and keep people out. \n"}, {"text": "The final mystery of the game involves the emblem of which animal?", "correct": "Goat", "options": ["Frog", "Cat", "Bat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoat.\n\n\tUpon recovering and analyzing the torn photo confiscated by Inspector Chelmy, Professor Layton and Luke both discover that they've seen the emblem on the top of the Elysian Box elsewhere: in front of the fountain at the Herzen Museum.  According to the man who owns the photography shop in Folsense, the emblem is that of the Herzen Family who resided in the castle north of town.  Both the Herzen Family and the Elysian Box are inherently tied. \n"}]}
