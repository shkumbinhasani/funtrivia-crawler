{"id": "376726", "name": "\"DotA 2\" Basics Trivia Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games D-F", "Defense of the Ancients (DotA)"], "questions": [{"text": "In a typical game of \"DotA 2\", players will be placed into the Radiant side or which opposing team?", "correct": "Dire", "options": ["Darkside", "Evil", "Fallen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDire.\n\n\tThe light-vs-dark dichotomy is pretty evident between the Radiant and Dire teams, and regardless of hero you can end up on one side of the river or the other simply based on random seeding (though some heroes are obviously evil and some would clearly side with good).  The Radiant side always begins in the bottom left corner of the map and the Dire side commences in the top right.  While the Radiant side of the map is often lush and green, the Dire side has withered away; both are split by a river running through the center of the map, crossed by paths or cut off at the ends. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these core attributes is not one by which heroes are classified?", "correct": "Stamina", "options": ["Intelligence", "Agility", "Strength"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStamina.\n\n\tAlthough all heroes in the game have different values of Strength, Agility, and Intelligence, they will most often lean to one of the three.  Strength heroes are often the tankiest and hardest-hitting with physical attacks, Agility heroes are the most dexterous and will either have high attack speed or ranged strikes, and Intelligence-based heroes will most likely be casters who use mana to a greater extent.  There are many heroes within each category and each can be built to suit the needs of the game. \n"}, {"text": "Each team has a side of the map containing how many 'lanes'?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Five", "Six", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThe lanes of the \"DotA 2\" map are called the Middle Lane, the Safe Lane, and the Offlane, and each one typically sees the same heroes based on the needs of each team, but can vary from patch to patch.  The Middle Lane, often containing one fighter from each team, will usually get the most experience and, thus, results in the strongest early-game core players. The Safe Lane is often taken by a core and a support player and, regardless of side, will be faced off against by the enemy team's Offlane, which has less opportunity for movement based on map layout.  Strong Offlane characters are often those who can gain experience without needing to get too involved in what will likely be an unfair fight (simply based on numbers).  Fortunately, a solo offlaner will often get more experience than a safe-laning duo. \n"}, {"text": "How many locations on the map spawn non-Bounty runes?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["None", "One", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tIn the fairness of even map layout, there are two non-Bounty rune locations, each placed in the river, both equidistant from each team's base and lanes.  Games often start with claiming control of the first runes on the map (always Bounty Runes, resulting in gold for the players), but runes will regenerate every few minutes.  Bounty Runes give gold, Haste Runes increase speed, Double Damage Runes affect damage output, Invisibility Runes allow for one player to disappear, Regeneration Runes refill health and mana, and Arcane Runes reduce mana costs for spells. \n"}, {"text": "Wards are purchased to give vision in an otherwise darkened map location.  One ward is the Observer Ward.  What is another?", "correct": "Sentry Ward", "options": ["Target Ward", "Magic Ward", "Flying Ward"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSentry Ward.\n\n\tObserver Wards, which grant vision within a certain radius around a location, and Sentry Wards, which allow players to see invisible items (like other wards) or heroes in a certain radius, can be bought at the base shop though the former is free to obtain and the latter, while selling in multiples of two, disappears faster and costs more. There are several spots on the map that are prescribed for wards, usually out of convenience, but there are many clever and effective ward spots that can be found either way, mainly for tactical purposes.  Once a ward is placed, the enemy team can not see it unless they have another ward or another way to see invisible items/people. Wards take up one slot in a player's inventory, regardless of quantity or type. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the creature who holds the Aegis of the Immortal?", "correct": "Roshan", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoshan.\n\n\tRoshan waits in a rocky arena hidden from plain sight in the bottom half of the map, embedded in the dire side, but accessible from a common point for both teams, directly in front of the bottom rune.  Fightable from the start of the game, players who are strong enough can fight and defeat Roshan for the Aegis of the Immortal, which returns the player holding it to life if killed. The Aegis does expire after a short time, but Roshan will also reappear after a predetermined amount of time as well.  Roshan will increase in difficulty the further along the game goes, and after his third kill he'll also drop Cheese, which instantly refills health and mana to a great degree. Games can be won or lost on Roshan. \n"}, {"text": "Lanes and bases are lined with towers.  How many towers appear between the river and the edge of the team's base in a single lane, regardless of side?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Three", "One", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tNo matter which lane, teams will push objectives in the game by breaking down enemy towers (which will fight back!).  The tier one tower stands near the river, the tier two tower makes it halfway back to base, and the tier three and tier four towers are found within each team base (along with the barracks and ancient, the ultimate objective).  Each tower grants true-sight, and any invisible character in its vision radius can be seen, regardless of what they may be doing. If the enemy team knocks down a tower, that vision is gone and their forces can forge onward.  Towers do get a bit of backdoor protection to refill health and teams can protect them with temporary Glyphs of Fortification, but these should be used tactically. \n"}, {"text": "Between lanes on the map is an area commonly known by what name?", "correct": "Jungle", "options": ["Forest", "Woodland", "Meadow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJungle.\n\n\tThe Jungle is a valuable resource since a number of nooks and crannies therein will contain enemies of all shapes and sizes which respawn, provided no one (or no ward) is in their vicinity, and those can grant gold and experience or, alternately, affect the traffic of creeps in any given lane if pulled out of their homes.  Some heroes lend themselves strongly to jungling instead of laning while others are much stronger using the jungle to support their teammates in-lane by affecting creep equilibrium between towers.  Of course, it's also the perfect spot to gank an enemy teammate. \n"}, {"text": "Items can be bought from the base shop or which alternate location?", "correct": "The Secret Shop", "options": ["The Magic Shop", "The Travelling Shop", "The Super Shop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Secret Shop.\n\n\tShopping in the game can be done in many ways, even if nowhere near a shop.  While the base shop is a great spot to fill up on items, players in lanes can find their Secret Shops in their respective jungles with a limited selection of stock that can quickly upgrade late-game items.  The Secret Shop can be found in the upper Radiant jungle or the lower Dire jungle, and both contain some of the rarer items in the game which can only be bought if visited by the player or a courier, which can transport items anywhere on the map. \n"}, {"text": "Typically, heroes will have how many spells/abilities at their disposal?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Six", "Five", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tMost heroes have four spells or abilities, whether they be active or passive, that can be leveled up at each level; the last of these abilities is always referred to as an Ultimate, and can (almost always) only be upgraded after Level 6, 11, or 16.  Some heroes buck the trend though, and it only adds to the complex playstyles of different figures in the game. Invoker, for instance, changes spells using three different elements; Doom's spells vary based on consumed foes; Keeper of the Light alters spells using a particular item.  Regardless, three spells and one Ultimate is the norm, and if you don't want to upgrade those (which you likely will), you can always opt to boost your stats instead. \n"}]}
