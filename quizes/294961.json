He speaks fluent Yiddish and is active in the Jewish community.\rIt was Nimoy who invented both the Vulcan nerve pinch and the Vulcan salute and it's familiar intonation to 'live long and prosper'. He wrote two books about his 3-year stint as television's green-blooded alien, 'I am Not Spock', published in 1977, and 'I am Spock' in 1995. During the years between the two, Nimoy came to realize the significance of those three years on the rest of his life.\rOf the alternatives, Nimoy and Shatner are almost exactly the same age -- William Alan Shatner was born just four days before Nimoy, but he is a Canadian from Montreal. Grace Nichols is the youngest of the four, born in 1932 in Robbins IL. The late Jackson DeForest Kelley was significantly older, born in Toccoa GA in 1920. \n"}, {"text": "Which President nominated Sandra Day O'Connor as the first female member of the U.S Supreme Court?", "correct": "Ronald Reagan", "options": ["Bill Clinton", "Jimmy Carter", "George H.W.

He moved to New Orleans in his late 20s and changed his name to Tennessee, the state where his father was born. His most famous works were all written in period of less than 20 years ... 'The Glass Menagerie' was his first major play, in 1944. Three years later came 'A Streetcar Named Desire' for which he won the 1948 Pulitzer. 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' repeated this success in 1955. 'The Night of the Iguana' in 1961 was his last great success, although he continued writing right up until his death. Indeed, his last play, 'A House Not Meant to Stand' was written in 1982 although it was not published until 2008. \rOf the alternatives, all four were winners of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.  Faulkner was another Mississippian, born in New Albany MS, but earlier, in 1897. Wilder was also born in 1897, in Madison WI. Miller was the youngest of the four, born in New York NY in 1915. \n"}, {"text": "Which prominent member of the British Conservative Party was born in Rotherham, South Yorkshire on March 26, 1961?", "correct": "William Hague", "options": ["Boris Johnson", "David Cameron", "Liam Fox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Hague.\n\n\tThe (then) 28-year old William Jefferson Hague was first elected to Parliament in a 1989 by-election, and he has been the member for the rural North Yorkshire constituency of Richmond (the Conservative Party's safest seat) ever since. He became a member of John Major's cabinet as the Secretary of State for Wales in 1995 and two years later took over from Major as party leader following the disastrous 1997 General Election result. Hague was, in turn, replaced after the unsuccessful 2001 election, by Iain Duncan Smith, and he returned to the backbenches. In 2005, David Cameron appointed him as Shadow Foreign Secretary.\rOf the alternatives, all are younger than Hague. Cameron is a Londoner born in 1966. Johnson was born 1964 in New York City. Liam Fox is close to Hague in age, born just six months later, but he is a Scot from East Kilbride. \n"}, {"text": "Which singer, born in 1944, was nominated for a 'Best Actress' Oscar in 1972?", "correct": "Diana Ross", "options": ["Liza Minnelli", "Barbra Streisand", "Bette Middler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiana Ross.\n\n\tDiana Ross, born in Detroit MI on March 26, 1944, was nominated for the 1972 Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Billie Holliday in 'Lady Sings the Blues'. She made her name as leader of The Supremes in the 1960s before launching her solo career in 1970. She was the first female solo artist to record six US #1 singles. Those added to the 12 #1 singles with The Supremes prompted the 'Guinness Book of Records' to name her as the 20th Century's most successful female recording artist.\rOf the alternatives, all were singers who have been nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Bette Middler, born just a year after Ross in 1945, was nominated for 'The Rose' in 1979. Liza Minnelli, born two years after Ross in 1946, was nominated for 'The Sterile Cuckoo' in 1969.

Clue: it is the national flower of a country whose saint's day is also in March.", "correct": "Daffodil", "options": ["Chrysanthemum", "Violet", "Shamrock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaffodil.\n\n\tThe daffodil is the national flower of Wales, and it is traditional to wear a daffodil or a leek on the day of their national patron saint -- St Davids Day (March 1). \rThe daffodil is also widely used as decoration during Chinese New Year which falls in January or February. Also known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring festival, it is a major holiday in many Asian countries.\rThe daffodil is the symbol of many cancer charities around the world.\rThe famous 1804 poem by William Wordsworth, 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud', is also known as 'The Daffodils'. \rOf the alternatives, the violet is the birth flower for those born in February and the chrysanthemum is for November. The shamrock isn't anyone's birth flower, but is the national emblem of Ireland, whose patron saint, Patrick, is March 17. Sorry to anyone who fell for that red herring. \n"}, {"text": "Raiders and Chiefs running back Marcus Allen played his college football at which university?", "correct": "U.S.C.", "options": ["Notre Dame", "U.C.L.A.", "Stanford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nU.S.C.\n\n\tMarcus LeMarr Allen was born on March 26, 1960 in San Diego CA. He played his college football at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. In 1981, he became the first NCAA player ever to rush for more than 2,000 yards and he won the Heisman Trophy. USC retired his number (33) and he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000.\rAs a die-hard member of 'The Great Raider Nation', I was a huge fan (partly because he was born on exactly the same day as I was) and it was a sad day in Raiders history when he left to join the evil Kansas City Chiefs. \rAllen broke Walter Paytons's record of 110 rushing touchdowns and ended his career in 1997 with 123, although that mark was later eclipsed by Emmitt Smith (who retired with a remarkable 164). His 17,654 total yards (rushing and receiving) trailed only Payton when he retired, but again has been overtaken since. He was also the first player ever to rush for 10,000 yards and make 5,000 yards receiving.\rAllen was the MVP of Superbowl XVIII in 1984, leading the Raiders to a 38-9 demolition of the Washington Redskins. In 1985, he was the League MVP.

Her film career took off with her portrayal of Jules Paxton in 'Bend it Like Beckham' and then as Elizabeth Swann in 'Pirates of the Caribbean', a role she reprized for both sequels. Her first feature film appearance, though, was as Sab\u00e9, one of Natalie Portman's handmaidens in 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'. That was in 1999 and by 2008 she was the only non-American in the list of Hollywood's highest paid actors -- the second-highest female on the list, after Cameron Diaz.\rOf the alternatives, Weisz, who won the 'Best Supporting Actress' award for 'The Constant Gardener' in 2005, is a Londoner, but older than Knightley by 15 years.
