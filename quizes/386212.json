{"id": "386212", "name": "Packing a Punch Quiz | Entertainment | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Entertainment by Themes"], "questions": [{"text": "In what movie does Rocky Balboa become heavyweight champion of the world by defeating Apollo Creed?", "correct": "Rocky II", "options": ["Rocky IV", "Rocky I", "Rocky III"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRocky II.\n\n\tWhile Rocky and Creed (played by Sylvester Stallone and Carl Weathers respectively) fought to a draw in the first \"Rocky\" movie in 1976, it took three years of waiting before fans saw them again in \"Rocky II\" when Rocky won the championship and took the title.  In subsequent movies, Rocky and Creed became friends as the former went on to fights against other prize fighters (Lang and Drago, being noteworthy).  Weathers would continue to appear in \"Rocky\" films before leaving between \"Rocky IV\" and \"Rocky V\". \n"}, {"text": "'BOOM!  BAP!  POW!'  Punches in what classic superhero TV show starring Adam West were often accompanied by onomatopoeic words, onscreen, depicting them?", "correct": "Batman", "options": ["Superman", "Daredevil", "The Incredible Hulk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatman.\n\n\tBefore all the hubbub about movies and dark, dangerous Batman, Adam West starred in a \"Batman\" TV show in the 1960s and it certainly went out of its way to depict the comic book influences of its progenitor.  Fight scenes (done to music, quite often) were accompanied by highlighted strikes against foes, often with unique words appearing onscreen to emphasize the strikes.  Some classics: 'Clange!', 'Kapow!', 'Zlopp!', 'Kayo!'.  Tim Burton did away with these when making his films in the late 1980s/early 1990s. \n"}, {"text": "Anime/Manga protagonist Saitama is a normal guy who aspires to be a superhero.  How many punches does he need to make to defeat his foes?", "correct": "One", "options": ["None", "Five", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tThe star of \"One-Punch Man\", Saitama is almost too normal in appearance and manner, and he strongly juxtaposes the goings-on of the cities in the manga and anime he's featured in.  While the monsters he fights are horrible beasts and, often, unbeatable by most of the heroes he's aligned with, he only needs to make one punch to destroy them...or anything, really.  He claims it's a result of his intense training regiment of one hundred push-ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats, a ten kilometer run, three square meals, and no air conditioning, daily. \n"}, {"text": "What 2011 Zack Snyder film, actually about a girl in a mental asylum, features fantasy martial arts and heavy use of CGI?", "correct": "Sucker Punch", "options": ["Punch-Out", "One-Two Punch", "Welcome to the Punch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSucker Punch.\n\n\tDirector Snyder's follow-up to popular graphic-novel adaptations \"300\" and \"Watchmen\", \"Sucker Punch' was an original story criticized by filmgoers for being too convoluted.  While, visually, \"Sucker Punch\" packed its own punch with complex settings and stylized fight sequences, the film packed too much in.  Set in a mental asylum, the story in the film mostly plays out in the protagonist's (named Babydoll) head, so she's in an institution, but imagines herself as a dancer in a brothel.  At one point she fights samurais.  Yeah. \n"}, {"text": "First appearing in the \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\" video games, what Pok\u00e9mon had unique Ice Punch, Fire Punch, and ThunderPunch attacks?", "correct": "Hitmonchan", "options": ["Mankey", "Hitmonlee", "Machamp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHitmonchan.\n\n\tHitmonchan (named after Jackie Chan, much like Hitmonlee was named after Bruce Lee) was one of two Pok\u00e9mon available to players if they could defeat the leader of the optional Fighting Dojo in Saffron City, adjacent to the Psychic Gym run by Sabrina.  Hitmonchan, armed with boxing gloves, would use his ice, fire, electric, and normal type punch attacks to subdue enemies.  In later games, his attacks list would expand.  Through many generations, he never had an evolution. \n"}, {"text": "Hitting up a bar in the first season of \"Jersey Shore\", which guido/guidette housemate was famously punched in the face, leading to a ratings bump for the MTV show?", "correct": "Snooki", "options": ["Pauly D", "Jwoww", "The Situation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnooki.\n\n\tWhile I don't bring this up to glorify or condone the violence depicted on (and later edited out of) \"Jersey Shore\", to say that it didn't have a positive effect on the MTV smash hit would be lying.  Visiting a bar together in the first season of the show, the eight housemates of \"Jersey Shore\" got into a fight when Snooki fought another bar patron over drinks that he was stealing from their group.  What resulted was Snooki getting punched in the face.  The show nearly quadrupled in ratings by the end of its first season, doubling from the fourth episode and the fight scene. \n"}, {"text": "New Zealand indie-alternative band The Naked and Famous sang about punching in which of these during a popular 2010 song?", "correct": "A dream", "options": ["Australia", "The dark", "The club"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA dream.\n\n\t\"Punching in a Dream\" was one of the major singles for The Naked and Famous during their debut album, \"Passive Me, Aggressive You\", which released in 2010.  While the album cracked onto the U.S. Billboard 200 (peaking at ninety-one), they fared much better elsewhere, topping the charts in their native New Zealand.  \"Punching in a Dream\", their third single, was used in several TV commercials, the movie \"Pitch Perfect\", and a \"Forza\" racing video game.  Their second album, \"In Rolling Waves\", had more success in the U.S.. \n"}, {"text": "First appearing in 1978, the Punch-a-Bunch board was a fixture on what U.S. game show?", "correct": "The Price is Right", "options": ["Password", "Wheel of Fortune", "Press Your Luck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Price is Right.\n\n\tThe first cash-only game to appear on \"The Price is Right\", the game was won by players who punched holes in the punch board and retrieved dollar values from inside.  Fifty holes appeared on the board ranging in value from fifty dollars onward to, at later dates, tens of thousands of dollars.  If the player didn't like the dollar amount they punched, they could continue on aiming for a higher value depending on how many punches they attained in a pricing game. \n"}, {"text": "Whose punch, only seen in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" video game series, is considered one of the strongest across all Nintendo games?", "correct": "Captain Falcon", "options": ["Ganondorf", "Pikachu", "Super Mario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Falcon.\n\n\tMost video gamers and online memers know it simply as \"FALCON PUNCH!\" but there's a lot behind the attack which was introduced in the original \"Super Smash Bros.\" game for the Nintendo 64 in 1999.  Particularly interesting is the fact that Captain Falcon is from the \"F-Zero\" video game series, known for high-speed racing in outer space; Captain Falcon never stepped foot outside of his vehicle until \"Smash Bros.\".  Nonetheless, the attack, when it hits, does a great deal of damage and subsequently followed Falcon to the \"F-Zero\" anime. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the partner of famous puppet Pulcinella, better known as 'Punch'?", "correct": "Judy", "options": ["Mork", "Sooty", "Kermit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJudy.\n\n\tDating back several centuries to puppet shows in Italy and France, 'Punch and Judy' became better known as a British tradition in which two puppets would appear (the titular Punch, or Pulcinella, or Punchinello and Judy) and the male puppet would be brutally attacked.  Somewhat of an instance of shock comedy, the format evolved over years and years of use, so much so that most Punch and Judy shows don't really feature characters by those names; they're a style unto themselves.  Despite the violence, it's meant as comedic entertainment. \n"}]}
