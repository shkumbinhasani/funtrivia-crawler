He offered sanctuary, however, saying that he would give mercy and pass over any house playing jazz music in full swing by 10:15pm.  If he found a house in the city that did not he would kill anyone inside.\rAt Miss Robichaux's the girls had a plan in mind.

Amongst the belongings is a small bottle of booze and it rolls on the floor into the closet.  Moving some clothes aside Zoe finds a secret panel in the wall, opening into a crawlspace filled with old items left behind by past witches.  Among the belongings here, some put away by the witches who resided in the academy in the 1910s, is a Ouija board. \n"}, {"text": "According to Zoe, what is 'the drink of the divine'?", "correct": "Absinthe", "options": ["Sambuca", "Tia Maria", "Vodka"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbsinthe.\n\n\tZoe tells the other girls that their numbers have been going down for years and now it's down to the three of them to rebuild the coven.  They need to find Madison.  All three of them take a shot of absinthe and decide to watch each others' backs before placing a shotglass down as a planchette.  Sitting in front of the fire, they begin asking questions.  As it turns out they're not alone; they speak with someone who was murdered in the house...by witches.

Zoe turns out to be the only one who has the spine to do it, so she sets the table up again and asks away, claiming she'll give him what he wants if he says.  When she uses the board, he spells out 'ATTIC'.  This takes her up into Spalding's room of dolls where, sure enough, Madison's decaying corpse is hiding in a large chest along the wall.  That's when Spalding comes up from behind and grabs her. \n"}, {"text": "According to Cordelia, she needs which flower in her presence for strength?", "correct": "Chrysanthemum", "options": ["Daisy", "Rose", "Tulip"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChrysanthemum.\n\n\tFiona returns to the Academy before Cordelia makes her arrival with Hank.

Nan reveals, based on his thoughts, that he killed her because he wanted her to be his first love.  When he alleges that they can't do anything about it, Queenie burns her face, knocking him out in pain.  Zoe says that she doesn't believe him and he's probably keeping the secret in his mind with a trick or two. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Misty Day bring Madison back from the dead?", "correct": "The greenhouse", "options": ["The morgue", "The bayou", "The hospital"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe greenhouse.\n\n\tOut in the bayou, Misty Day tends to her plants, specifically a mound of earth containing Myrtle Snow's regenerating body.

She bathes him but, in a rage spurned by memories of his abusive mother, he destroys her furniture and smashes her Stevie Nicks tapes, prompting her, in utter distress and sadness, to send him home with Zoe.

She visited Miss Robichaux's on Cordelia's invitation but didn't stay.  Marie says that he's in love with Cordelia, something he disagrees with.  She tells him that she wants all of their heads-- every witch in the academy-- or he will die.\r Back at the Academy, the girls decide to hide Madison until the right moment.  Misty, meanwhile, says that she needs to go back to her cabin.  She also refuses to take Kyle with her.\r Madison, meanwhile, starts to regain complexion and finds that she can't stomach any food or drink.

She heads to the spellbooks downstairs and senses the right incantation, pulling the tome out and turning to the right page.  She, Nan, and Queenie gather their powers and are successfully able to send the Axeman on his way.  He strolls down the front steps and out the gate to freedom.\rHis first stop is the local jazz bar where Fiona, stressed, discovers that she's losing her hair.  While she contemplates her mortality at the bar, a man sits next to her-- the Axeman-- and he asks what she's drinking. \n"}]}
