{"id": "372394", "name": "\"Doctor Who\" - Series 4 Online Quiz | Doctor Who - Series 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "The Series (2005-)", "Doctor Who - Series 4"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Partners in Crime\" - The Doctor reunites with Donna Noble as both investigate the appearance of what unique alien lifeform?", "correct": "Adipose", "options": ["The Heavenly Host", "Carrionite", "The Family"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdipose.\n\n\tDonna and the Doctor reunite one year after their adventure together on her wedding day, but they only do so after running into each other at Adipose Industries in London, a short time before the Adipose pills are set to launch worldwide.  The pills, as it turns out, promise fat loss, but the users don't realize this is literal; Donna witnesses this first-hand when a lead literally melts into little Adipose. The two of them discover that the perpetrator is none other than the C.E.O. of Adipose Industries, Miss Foster, who is actually a nanny for a race of alien beings asked to nurture their young and return them to their home planet. To do so, of course, means harvesting them.  In the end, Miss Foster is left to die by her employers while Donna decides to bring her things and head off with the Doctor, leaving her life behind. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Fires of Pompeii\" - During the events of this episode, it becomes apparent that the Doctor himself was the cause of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tFor their first trip together, Donna and the Doctor head back to Ancient Roman times though they end up in Pompeii the day before the devastating eruption.  The TARDIS is sold off to a collector when their backs are turned and they end up stumbling on an odd mystery involving seers and prophets connected to the Sibylline Sisterhood, actually working for creatures known as Pyroviles. Donna and the Doctor are forced into the crater of the volcano and into the Pyrovile ship where the Doctor has no choice but to cause the eruption, killing many innocent people, but enabling the fixed point in history to avoid a paradox. Donna, in an attempt to save anyone from what is, surely, death, convinces the Doctor to save one family.  Both depart. \n"}, {"text": "\"Planet of the Ood\" - The Ood imprisoned on the Ood-Sphere begin to exhibit what odd symptom?", "correct": "Red eyes", "options": ["Sharp claws", "Pallid colouring", "Deeper voice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed eyes.\n\n\tDonna and the Doctor head into the future for their next adventure, this time ending up two thousand years ahead of Donna's present day to randomly visit the Ood-Sphere in a time when Ood Operations tries to sell their servant units to humankind.  Although the Ood seem happy to serve, it becomes apparent that the unprocessed Ood in the factories are simply enslaved, and Donna and the Doctor need to save themselves at the same time they try to save the Ood who, mysteriously, begin to go rabid and exhibit red eyes as a symptom. Both find the Ood Brain and, ultimately, stop the head of the racket when he too is transformed into an Ood.  The duo leaves as heroes of the Ood race, immortalized in song. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Sontaran Stratagem\"/\"The Poison Sky\" - What is the name of the vehicle add-on responsible for poisoning the Earth?", "correct": "Atmos", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtmos.\n\n\tThe Doctor gets a call on his phone while he and Donna hurtle through space and time; it's Martha.  Returning to Earth they discover that dozens of people all died at the same second, and an elite task force known as U.N.I.T. is on the case, taking over the Atmos factory on a lead and finding that the units, attached to many cars throughout the world, cut carbon emissions 100%.  Unfortunately, the units are also responsible for being the instruments of a more nefarious plan brought about by the Sontaran forces in an attempt to use Earth as a breeding ground for their race of soldiers. Martha is kidnapped and cloned while Donna and the Doctor set out to stop the war-driven race, ultimately saving the day as a team and setting fire to the atmosphere to rid it of poison gases. When they hop back into the TARDIS for a quick rendezvous, the three (the Doctor, Donna, and Martha) are all taken, against their will, somewhere in the future. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Doctor's Daughter\" - What is the name of the Doctor's daughter, created using a portion of his DNA?", "correct": "Jenny", "options": ["Sylvia", "She is left unnamed", "Rose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJenny.\n\n\tThe Doctor, Donna, and Martha end up traveling, against their intent, to Messaline well in the future and smack-dab into the middle of a war between human and Hath forces who've evidently been in battle for generations.  Martha is taken hostage by the Hath only to prove her worth (and their generosity) when she helps a wounded Hath in the field. Meanwhile, the Doctor is made to put his hand into a progenitor machine, cloning him without his consent, and leading to who can only be defined as his daughter (who Donna names Jenny).  They discover the war in progress and fight to stop it, ultimately reuniting with Martha in time to find that everyone has been fighting for a mere seven days (only dying and being cloned over and over), and over a lost terraforming device. The Doctor releases the device, setting the planet off on its fresh start and ending the war, but not before Jenny is shot and killed.  The Doctor and Donna return Martha to Earth and set off once more while, back on Messaline, Jenny awakens, having been revived by the terraformer, before jetting off into space. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Unicorn and the Wasp\" - Donna and the Doctor travel back in time to meet with what famous author?", "correct": "Agatha Christie", "options": ["William Shakespeare", "Charles Dickens", "Edgar Allen Poe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAgatha Christie.\n\n\tHeading back to the 1920s, the Doctor and Donna make it to a British estate house the day before Agatha Christie's notable disappearance and, of course, they end up stumbling upon a mystery.  The catch is that the mystery involves both a jewel thief and an unrelated alien wasp known as a Vespiform.  What they and Agatha discover is that the jewel thief, known as The Unicorn, is a London girl who arrived for the party; the Wasp is an alien wasp, actually the hostess' estranged son, conceived in India but also from another world. Agatha is able to lure the creature to a nearby lake where she, the Doctor, and Donna subdue and destroy it.  Unfortunately, Agatha's memory of the events must be wiped and she appears at Harrogate House a few days later...only to have a long career in mystery writing. \n"}, {"text": "\"Silence in the Library\"/\"Forest of the Dead\" - The Doctor meets a woman from his future who just happens to know his name.  What is her own name?", "correct": "River & River Song", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiver & River Song.\n\n\tThe Doctor takes Donna to a planet built to be the universe's largest library only to find that the place is deserted.  After an information device tells them to 'count the shadows', they find themselves trapped in a room until a party of archaeologists led by the enigmatic River Song makes an entrance.  There, they all determine that the planet is empty because of the Vashta Nerada, microscopic piranhas who inhabit the shadows.  As some of their numbers begin to dwindle, the Doctor makes an attempt to teleport Donna to the TARDIS for safety, accidentally getting her caught elsewhere.\rThe others attempt to make their escape and it becomes clear that River Song knows much more about the Doctor's future than should be possible.  It isn't until they reach the core of the planet, prevent self-destruction, and release the literal people housed in the CAL hard drive that River reveals she traveled with the Doctor and was told his name.  River sacrifices her life to save Donna and the thousands of others saved in the library. \n"}, {"text": "\"Midnight\" - The Doctor decides to ride a public transport vehicle to the Sapphire Waterfall on the planet Midnight.  Does Donna join him?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tDonna stays at the spa in the Leisure Palace on Midnight while the Doctor takes a four hour shuttle out to the Sapphire Waterfall with several other tourists.  When the shuttle is forced to take a detour it, somehow, ends up attracting an unknown creature that inhabits a woman named Sky.  The shuttle, broken down and anticipating help, is forced to remain in place with the creature in its midst, first repeating everything everyone says, and then anticipating their words before they're even said. Soon, the creature is able to turn everyone against the Doctor...and themselves.  They're saved at the last minute by their shuttle attendant who notices a shift in speech patterns and blasts herself and the alien out of the airlock. \n"}, {"text": "\"Turn Left\" - When Donna slips into a parallel universe and makes a single different choice, the Doctor dies.  Who saves her with their guidance?", "correct": "Rose", "options": ["Martha", "Jack", "Sarah Jane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRose.\n\n\tVisiting the marketplace of an alien planet with the Doctor, Donna ends up getting a palm reading on her own and she stumbles into an alternate timeline in which she never met the Doctor, turning right at an intersection instead of left.  The decision ultimately unravels everything on Earth; the Doctor dies on Christmas Day when he was supposed to be stopping the Racnoss. Martha is killed on the moon when the Judoon take her hospital into space; Sarah Jane, taking the Doctor's role to save everyone, also dies there.  The spaceship Titanic crashes into London, forcing Donna and her family to take refugee status and, soon after, England descends into anarchy; the Adipose virtually destroy the U.S. population, ending a chance of foreign aid, and Torchwood is dismantled after the bulk of its staff are killed protecting the Earth from ATMOS and the Sontaran. Fortunately, Rose Tyler is able to cross over from her universe to help Donna realize that she's important.  Rose convinces her that she has the power to revert things to the way they need to be and sends her back in time to help her make the right decision-- turning left-- but to do this, Donna discovers she needs to die.  She's hit by a car, forcing her to turn right at the intersection and take the correct course of action.  When Donna returns to herself in the fortune teller's tent, she tells the Doctor that a message has been sent: 'Bad Wolf'. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\" - Who is responsible for moving the Earth across the universe?", "correct": "The Daleks", "options": ["The Cybermen", "The Master", "The Ood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Daleks.\n\n\tDonna and the Doctor return to Earth on Rose's warning, but it seems to be stolen right from under them and they're forced to try and chase it through the universe.  They end up chasing a lead at the Shadow Proclamation headquarters, but they don't find their way to it until they delve into the Medusa Cascade, finding it in a pocket of time by following a phone signal charged by what the Daleks call 'The Children of Time', a group containing Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Jack Harkness and Torchwood, Sarah Jane Smith (later joined by Mickey and Rose's mother, Jackie), and Harriet Jones (who sacrifices herself for the greater good).  When the Doctor and Donna arrive and find Rose and Jack at their rendezvous point, the Doctor is shot by the Daleks and the TARDIS is captured with them inside.  Fortunately, the Doctor, beginning his regeneration, is able to filter his energy into his severed hand.  The four are brought before the real perpetrators-- Prophet Dalek Caan and Davros-- but Donna is left in the TARDIS against her will and dropped into the core of the Crucible to be used as energy.  Unknown to the rest, she's able to use the Doctor's regeneration energy to create a new Doctor (half-human-half-Time-Lord) and imbue herself with the same abilities; they work together to create something to stop the Daleks.  The others, meanwhile, are brought to the ship via teleportation where Martha is unable to use UNIT's Osterhagen Key to destroy Earth and the Daleks' infernal machine and Jack and Sarah Jane are unable to destroy the Crucible with a Warp Star.  Fortunately, Donna and the Doctor Clone are able to step in and Donna nearly single-handedly takes control of the Dalek forces to save everyone.  While the Doctor protects the Children of Time by ushering them into the TARDIS, the clone, against the Doctor's wishes, destroys the entire Dalek fleet in an act of mass genocide.  Everyone tethers the Earth to the TARDIS and returns it to its rightful coordinates in space.\r In the end, Jack, Martha, and Mickey remain on Earth, as does Sarah Jane.  Rose and Jackie are returned to their version of Bad Wolf Bay and the Doctor leaves his clone, a more human version of himself, to be cared for by Rose.  Donna returns to the TARDIS with the Doctor, but it becomes apparent that she can not continue because her mind is overwhelmed with the mind of a Time Lord.  Against her wishes, the Doctor has to wipe her memory clean and return her home where she's never to remember the Doctor or her adventures.  She was, however, the most important person in the universe.  The Doctor returns to the TARDIS alone. \n"}]}
