In the NLCS against the Marlins, an un-named fan was involved in controversy on whether he interfered with a fly ball down the left field line.  This was the blame given to the Cubs losing the series.  Seen time and time again in replays, who was the left fielder who didn't come up with the ball?", "correct": "Moises Alou", "options": ["Rocky Colavito", "Dick Tracewski", "Sammy Ellis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoises Alou.\n\n\tThe others never played for the Cubs, and all were retired before 1970.

Even though other fans were there in the midst, and many other plays led up to the demise of the Cubs, including manager Dusty Baker making some very poor pitching decisions, the fan was unfairly tried in Chicago's own court of public opinion. If it was known by fans then (as it was stated by Alou himself) that Moises urinates on his hands prior to a game to make them tough, they may have cleared the entire seating area when he came charging near. The outcome of the play may have been different. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following were not brothers that played in Major League baseball?", "correct": "Frank and Brooks Robinson", "options": ["Dizzy and Daffy Dean", "Ozzie and Jose Canseco", "Lloyd and Paul Waner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank and Brooks Robinson.\n\n\tThe Waner's were Pirates, the Dean's were Cardinals, and the Canseco's were Athletics.
