He's worked on both sides of the law with X-Factor and Alpha Flight, as well as with Gamma Flight and Weapon X. He's been called Weapon Omega and Wildheart, but by what name is he most connected?", "correct": "Wild Child", "options": ["Tazz", "Bigfoot", "Snidely"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWild Child.\n\n\tLike Sabertooth, Wild Child has claws and fangs and knows how to use them. His healing powers, though, apparently are not on the same level as Wolverine. He had his throat slashed by Sabertooth in a fight and, while he was healed, was also rendered mute. \n"}, {"text": "Brazilian native Roberto da Costa was playing soccer when his powers first manifested during a fight. The extent of his powers came to the attention of Donald Pierce of the Hellfire Club, who tried to kidnap him but was rescued by Charles Xavier. He was recruited by Xavier to become part of a new team of mutants-in-training. By what name is he known?", "correct": "Sunspot", "options": ["El Sol", "Corona", "Caliente"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSunspot.\n\n\tRoberto has the power to harness the sun to use it as propulsion for flight or for super-human strength. In the process, his power covers him in a black mass of crackling energy. His power weakens somewhat when he is in the shade or at night. Unknown to Roberto, his father was a member of the inner circle of the Hellfire Club, who sought to kidnap him and make him join the club as well. He fought them off at first, but years later would take over the organization from its leader, Sebastian Shaw. \n"}, {"text": "It may be that an Egyptian named En Sabah Nur was among the first mutants to walk the earth. Born in the days of the Pharaohs, he was abandoned because of his grey skin and facial features. He was rescued by a tribe of nomads, later captured and forced into slavery, and even killed, only to be revived by his mutant power. Since that time, he has appeared time and time again up to the present day, testing to see who among humans and mutants are truly 'the fittest' to survive. Who is he?", "correct": "Apocalypse", "options": ["Omega", "Rapture", "Ragnarok"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApocalypse.\n\n\tThe true extent of Apocalypse's powers may never be known. He first augmented his powers from the machinery of Pharaoh Rama-Tut, who turned out to be a time-traveller from the 30th Century. He later found a spaceship left behind by an alien race called Celestials and added even more to his arsenal. He was infected by a virus that turns flesh and blood to circuitry, but has been able to harness it to his means.While he must periodically sleep for years at a time to regenerate his energy, he is forever guarded by Rama-Tut's former vizier, Ozymandias, now rendered an immortal by Apocalypse. He has been held responsible for the creation of the Alliance of Evil, the Horsemen of Apocalypse and the Dark Riders among selected mutants, some of which were kidnapped X-Men like Angel and Wolverine.\n"}, {"text": "Irish-born Theresa Rourke is the daughter of a former X-Man and the first cousin of a mutant villain. It was the latter who raised her to follow in his footsteps, so it wasn't until her late teens that she learned who her father was. Theresa's powers all come from her voice, like her real father. Who is she?", "correct": "Siryn", "options": ["Screamer", "Diva", "Sonic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSiryn.\n\n\tTheresa's parents are Maeve Roark and Sean Cassidy (the X-Man Banshee). As an infant, an explosion during a terrorist attack killed Maeve and, supposedly, Theresa. But her cousin, the infamous Black Tom Cassidy, rescued her and raised her as his own. As mentioned, her mutant power parallels her father, in that she can fly using the sound of her voice, but Siryn is also able to influence and control others or put them into a trance. \n"}, {"text": "Born on Wundagore Mountain in the fictitious land of Transia, little Wanda and her twin brother was adopted by traveling gypsies Django and Marya Maximoff. After her mutant powers manifested, local villagers attacked the camp and killed their foster mother. The twins moved through the countryside until rescued by their real father, the mutant Magneto (of course, Wanda and her brother would not know this for many years) and joined him in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Later Wanda reformed and joined the Avengers, eventually marrying the android superhero the Vision. By what name is she better known?   ", "correct": "The Scarlet Witch", "options": ["Saber", "Sorceress", "Ms. Magnet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Scarlet Witch.\n\n\tThe Scarlet Witch has the mutant ability to change the probability factor of any person or object with 'hex spheres' (i.e. she can make a gun misfire or a hurling rock break up in mid-air). Her brother, Pietro, is also a mutant, the super-fast Quicksilver. She also became the mother of twins with the Vision (her mutant ability improved her chance of having babies with an android). \rA real witch named Agatha Harkness gave Wanda some lessons in actual sorcery, but not a lot. Sadly, Wanda had a nervous breakdown and lashed out at her fellow Avengers until rescued again by Magneto. She managed to use her power to create a mutant Utopian world with Magneto as the leader, but then used it again to return the world to normal, with one exception...all but 198 of the uncounted mutants on Earth permanently lost their powers. \n"}, {"text": "There is no way of knowing exactly how old the mutant named Raven Darkholme is, because her mutant ability to alter her physical appearance erases all signs of aging and weakness. There is also no way of knowing her true appearance, although she seems to appear in a relaxed state with red hair, blue skin and yellow eyes. She has used this to claim herself as the mother of the mutant Nightcrawler, but that's not known for sure. Who is she? ", "correct": "Mystique", "options": ["Masque", "Chameleon", "Mysterio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMystique.\n\n\tMystique has been a rogue spy for many years, as her mutant power makes it nearly impossible to track her down. She had been able to make her way through the U.S. government to a high-level position before her identity was revealed. For reasons known only to her, she raised a runaway mutant girl named Rogue as if she were her daughter (Rogue would later join the X-Men against Mystique's wishes). \n"}, {"text": "One mutant who has changed quite a bit through his life is British subject Mortimer Toynbee. Bullied as a child for his appearance, he originally had only the mutant ability to leap great distances, but alterations from aliens have added an enormous prehensile tongue...ick. Who is he?", "correct": "Toad", "options": ["Punisher", "Persuader", "Beast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToad.\n\n\tAn original member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Toad was literally a 'toady' to the group's leader, Magneto, but his indifference led Toynbee to eventually turn on his master. Toad also developed an unrequited crush on Magneto's daughter, Wanda (also known as the Scarlet Witch). Run-ins with the alien called the Stranger and genetics guru Herbert Wyndham (a.k.a. the High Evolutionary) added more power to the Toad's arsenal, including his tongue, mental control of frogs and the ability to secrete a substance from his skin that brings anyone who comes in contact with it under his will. \n"}, {"text": "Jason Wyngarde scrounged for many years as a carnival mentalist before realizing his ability was actually a mutant power. He went from the Brotherhood of Mutants to nearly taking over the infamous Hellfire Club. However, his fatal flaw was messing with the mind of the wrong X-Man. Who is this brain?", "correct": "Mastermind", "options": ["Purple Man", "Mentallo", "Ringmaster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMastermind.\n\n\tThe real Mastermind was a thin, sallow, seedy-looking man, but Wyngarde was able to make himself appear decidedly more handsome. He had actually started playing with Jean Grey's mind months in advance of his bid to take over the Hellfire Club from 'White King' Sebastian Shaw. What Mastermind didn't know was it wasn't Jean Grey he was controlling, but the more powerful 'Phoenix entity' disguised as Grey.When Wyngarde supposedly 'killed' Cyclops in a battle in front of Grey, his hold on her was broken. Enraged, she actually gave him what he wanted...unlimited power. However, Wyngarde's mind couldn't take in all the power at once, so he fell into a catatonic coma and stayed there until his death.He left behind two daughters, Regan and Martinique, both of them mutants with their father's powers. \n"}, {"text": "Although Japanese native Shiro Yoshida has assisted the X-Men from time to time, he has never been a full-fledged member. Shiro's mother was one of the thousands of victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and died after he was born. His mutant ability can harness the sun's rays and create temperatures of over a million degrees Farenheit. Who is he?", "correct": "Sunfire", "options": ["Solarr", "Heatwave", "Hothead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSunfire.\n\n\tFor many years, Yoshida harbored a hatred for Americans because of his mother's death, but in recent years has cooled down, so to speak. He is the cousin of the late Mariko Yashida, who was engaged to Wolverine before her death. He has pledged himself as the protector of Japan and has maintained his base of operations in that area. \n"}, {"text": "Not all mutants have abilities that make them tougher in a fight. Take for instance the late Douglas Ramsey. As a student at the Xavier Institute, he witnessed an alien robot invade the grounds, which sent the New Mutants into action. But it was Doug's mutant ability to translate any alien language that led to the discovery that the robot was in fact a techno-organic teenager who ran away from his planet. This led to both Doug and the robot becoming members of the New Mutants. What was Doug's code name?", "correct": "Cypher", "options": ["Rosetta", "Almanac", "Translator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCypher.\n\n\tCypher and the 'robot', later named Warlock, would have a special working relationship. Because Doug couldn't fight like the others, he and Warlock would periodically merge into a single unit they called Douglock. This allowed Doug to see what Warlock saw and help his teammates further, but exposed him to possible infection of a techno-organic virus.\rTragically, in one battle with a mad scientist called the Ani-Mator, Doug was shot and killed when he jumped in front of a bullet meant for one of his teammates, the Scottish mutant Wolfsbane. \n"}]}
