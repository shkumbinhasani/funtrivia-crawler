{"id": "407646", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 30\" [2] Online Trivia | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 30"], "questions": [{"text": "The third leg of the race took place entirely in what Moroccan city?", "correct": "Tangier", "options": ["Fez", "Marrakesh", "Casablanca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTangier.\n\n\tStarting leg three in the early morning, the nine competing teams had to fly from the Belgian border city of Antwerp to the northern coastal city of Tangier, Morocco.  Upon landing, teams could take a taxi to the Medina Fish Port by the water's edge where they could find one of three marked bins on the docks and begin sorting through a fisherman's catch of the day.  If they could organize the fish provided per the expectations of the fishermen and have them be ready for market, they could receive their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "The race's third leg (in Morocco), featured the reappearance of which race staple?", "correct": "The Travelocity Roaming Gnome", "options": ["The Express Pass", "The Blind Double U-Turn", "The Fast Forward"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Travelocity Roaming Gnome.\n\n\tAfter preparing their fish for market, teams were given a clue sending them into the marketplace on foot to find the Kisariate Jbala Souk.  There, they could find a local merchant with race colours sitting with the Travelocity Roaming Gnome and their morning tea.  If the team members greeting him with 'As-salam Alaykum', they would be given both the clue and the gnome, who would need to accompany them for the remainder of the leg (and join them during challenges). \n"}, {"text": "Team members completing the Leg 3 Road Block in Morocco needed to utilize which of these to receive a secret password?", "correct": "Payphone", "options": ["Telegraph", "Microsoft Surface tablet", "Ford Fusion GPS"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPayphone.\n\n\tCollecting their gnomes, teams received a Road Block clue asking for 'who was ready to rock the kasbah', and for this challenge, the selected team members needed to perform some Hollywood puzzling a la \"The Bourne Ultimatum\".  For this, the chosen racer brought their Roaming Gnome to a zipline atop the American Legation Museum and sent it over the rooftops. They then needed to navigate to the proper roof to collect their gnome and send it on another mystery zipline from the Kasbah Museum.  If they could get their gnome from atop the final building, they could collect it and a coin to use on a payphone, receive a secret message, and relay it to a local shopkeeper to get their next clue. Henry, Jessica, Eric, Chris, Jen, Brittany, Cedric, Conor, and Tim completed this task before returning to their partners. \n"}, {"text": "Which team did not complete the 'Drop It Off' Detour task in Morocco in Leg 3?", "correct": "Alex and Conor", "options": ["Cedric and Shawn", "Eric and Daniel", "Lucas and Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlex and Conor.\n\n\tWhen teammates reunited following the Detour, they had a choice to make, a Detour splitting them between 'Drop It Off' and 'Shake It Off'.  In 'Drop It Off', teams located a delivery truck at the Grand Socco and dragged crates of food through the nearby streets to different local restaurants.  They could trade the fruits for stamps that would spell their next destination. In 'Shake It Off', teams instead headed to the Restaurant Mamounia Palace and joined the local belly dancers to search for the same key words spelling out their next destination.  Cedric and Shawn, Eric and Daniel, and Lucas and Brittany were the only teams to complete the former task; everyone else went belly dancing. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was last to arrive at the Pit Stop in Leg 3 (in Morocco)?", "correct": "Cedric and Shawn", "options": ["Joey and Tim", "Lucas and Brittany", "Eric and Daniel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCedric and Shawn.\n\n\tFinishing their Detours, teams were led to their Pit Stop by their found key words, and it meant checking in on the mat with Phil at the courtyard in Moulay Hafid Palace.  Henry and Evan managed to lead as early as the Road Block and sustained that first place position all the way to the mat, claiming a trip for two to Zurich, Switzerland courtesy of Travelocity.  The leg's last place team, this time, was Cedric and Shawn, the former of whom dropped from first to last in the Road Block.  Fortunately, they avoided elimination but would be forced to complete a Speed Bump in Leg 4. \n"}, {"text": "The Speed Bump found in Leg 4 was completed in which country?", "correct": "France", "options": ["Morocco"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrance.\n\n\tLeading teams out of Morocco to start Leg 4, their clues instructed them to travel by plane over the Mediterranean to Nice, France where they could hop into their own vehicles and drive along the French Riviera to Saint-Tropez.  There, teams would find their next clue box at the Base Nautique Sailing School Water Company De Saint-Tropez.  Before nabbing that clue, however, Cedric and Shawn had to complete a Speed Bump on the shoreline, stacking boats in a proper order to continue racing. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 4, team members needed to learn how to sail on the French Riviera.  How many buoys did they need to reach?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "None", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tReaching their Road Block, one member of each team had to learn how to sail.  Grabbing a provided Optimist dinghy, Kristi, Alex, Cody, Evan, Trevor, Joey, Cedric, Lucas, and Daniel needed to properly attach a sail then hit the sea, navigating themselves with a rudder to reach two marked buoys, each with half a clue waiting for them.  If they could grab both and return to shore, they could keep on racing with their Detour in-hand. \n"}, {"text": "In Saint-Tropez in Leg 4, teams could either make bread for their Detour challenge, or which of these local items?", "correct": "Sandals", "options": ["Guitar", "Rug", "Umbrella"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSandals.\n\n\tTeams headed into Saint-Tropez proper for their Detour task in Leg 4.  In 'Bread', teams made baguettes at a local bakery, rolling out fifty of them with thirty pounds-worth of dough.  Alternatively, in 'Tread', teams could make a pair of Tropezienne sandals (one foot per team member), to the approval of a professional sandal-maker.  Only Alex and Conor and Cody and Jessica made the bread while the seven other teams took the more intricate sandal-making task. \n"}, {"text": "The Head-to-Head featured at the end of Leg 4 involved what French pastime?", "correct": "P\u00e9tanque", "options": ["Croquet", "Fencing", "Bagatelle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nP\u00e9tanque.\n\n\tBefore teams could call an end to the fourth leg of the race, they had to face another Head-to-Head, visiting the public square known as Place des Lices and engaging with another team in a game of p\u00e9tanque, attempting to get as close as possible to the jack taking turns throwing boules based on the order they select and who comes closer.  The team with the closest at the end would be able to check into the next Pit Stop in the plaza. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated from the race at the end of Leg 4 (in Saint-Tropez)?", "correct": "Cedric and Shawn", "options": ["Henry and Evan", "Lucas and Brittany", "Eric and Daniel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCedric and Shawn.\n\n\tOnce teams finished the Head-to-Head, they could check in with Phil immediately to find their placement at the end of Leg 4.  Alex and Conor overtook Kristi and Jen (who ultimately placed third) to take the win for this leg, their first of the race.  The race car drivers took the prize as well-- $5,000 USD each.  The end of the leg ended up being a face-off against Lucas and Brittany and Cedric and Shawn during which the ocean rescue couple managed to eke out the last-chance win and send the former NBA players home. \n"}]}
