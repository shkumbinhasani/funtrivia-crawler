{"id": "339871", "name": "Oh No! The Window's Smashed! Trivia Quiz | Thematic Fun | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun", "Thematic Story Time"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Really?  The window?  Come on!\"\n\nAs soon as I sat down to watch Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\", I heard a horrid shattering sound from the front room.  Sure enough, the window was destroyed.  Surveying the damage I noticed the culprit, a small, dimpled, plastic ball.  It was likely from which location?", "correct": "A driving range", "options": ["A volleyball court", "A baseball diamond", "A ping-pong table"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA driving range.\n\n\tThe modern golf ball is a lightweight orb consisting of a synthetic rubber on the inside and a hard, plastic shell on the outside.  These two factors are calibrated differently for different types of balls and brands.  Nonetheless, the golf ball is traditionally white and some can be quite expensive.  These small balls are designed with accuracy and aerodynamics in mind; the dimples found on these orbs are purposely there to enhance the speed, distance, and flight of a ball.\r Of course, that's when I remembered that there were no driving ranges in this part of the city.  Where the heck did that ball come from?  And who shot it at my window?! \n"}, {"text": "I headed to the kitchen for a dustpan in order to clean up the shattered remnants of my window.  Oh the pane of it all!\n\nWhen I finally grabbed the utensil out from under the sink, I heard something flutter into the front room.  Investigating, I found that a Cyanocitta cristata had entered in through the front window.  What bird, the official bird of Prince Edward Island and a Toronto sports team, was it?", "correct": "Blue Jay", "options": ["Oriole", "Cardinal", "Canada Goose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue Jay.\n\n\tThe Blue Jay is, indeed, a bird with blue feathers.  Found in North America, it appears in many of the eastern provinces and States all year long.  Toronto's major league baseball team happens to be known as the Blue Jays as well; they won the world series in 1992 and 1993.  Surprisingly, the birds don't actually have blue feathers; the blue is seen only because light passes through the feather and creates that colour.\r Using the dustpan, I moved the bird out the front door and into a proper bird-flying environment.  This window needed to get fixed ASAP. \n"}, {"text": "I looked out the window and saw clouds in the distance.  Really?  Rain?  I looked for something with which to cover the broken pane.\n\nWhich of these clouds is likely to produce rain?", "correct": "Cumulonimbus", "options": ["Cirrus", "Cirrostratus", "Cirrocumulus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCumulonimbus.\n\n\tNimbus clouds or any variation containing the prefix or suffix would indicate that rain is on the way.  The nimbus cloud could potentially be in the form of a stratus cloud or a cumulus cloud, but they would be regarded as nimbostratus and cumulonimbus in these instances.  Cumulonimbus clouds are high-reaching storm clouds often associated with large stormfronts.  Cirrus clouds are the highest in altitude and often look wispy.\r The rain in Spain falls mainly through my shattered pane; turns out the clouds were passing through without a drop.  Good. \n"}, {"text": "I decided that nothing could be done until the window repairman could stop by and I sat back down to watch my film.  I got about five minutes into it before a rather loud musical instrument was played outside my window; it was a rather large sax.\n\nWhich of these saxophones is larger than a bass saxophone?", "correct": "Contrabass saxophone", "options": ["Baritone saxophone", "Mezzo-soprano saxophone", "Alto saxophone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nContrabass saxophone.\n\n\tThe contrabass saxophone is one of the largest instruments in this woodwind family.  It, in turn, is smaller than the subcontrabass saxophone, which, hypothetically, would be huge.  The contrabass is usually played standing up from the floor; it reaches a height of almost two meters tall!  Heading from largest to smallest, you'd also have the bass sax, the tenor sax, alto, mezzo-soprano, soprano, and the sopranino.\r Who practices their contrabass sax outside right after what could have been a rainstorm?  Why did I not know my neighbours played instruments before this?  Ah well, at least they're not bagpipes. \n"}, {"text": "When I sit back down on the couch, I start noticing some peculiar creatures coming into the room...and biting me.  Blackflies abound!  It must be that time of year.\n\nFrom which of these places are the blackflies likely to have hatched?", "correct": "The nearby river", "options": ["My basement", "The city dump", "A bat cave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe nearby river.\n\n\tBlackfly eggs are laid upon rocks in running water and fly away from their spawning ground as full adults.  If you happen to get bit by a blackfly, it'll cause the same reaction as you'd get if you were bitten by a mosquito, likely an itchy, raised welt.  Female blackflies tend to feed on blood.  Blackflies are quite common along the Canada/U.S. border, especially in forested areas but several hundred different breeds can be found worldwide.  They are particularly proficient at carrying diseases that affect both humans and livestock.\r Looks like I need DEET.  Taking out a trusty flyswatter, I started the conquest to reclaim my house from these horrible bugs. \n"}, {"text": "I got goosebumps when I heard another shatter in the front room.  This time it wasn't a window; the wind knocked over a Chinese ornamental vase.  Of course.\n\nWhich of these dynasties would it have been made in if it were from China?", "correct": "Ming", "options": ["Saadi", "Nair", "Yamato"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMing.\n\n\tOf the dynasties listed, only one was ever in China; the Ming Dynasty occurred between the mid-fourteenth and the mid-seventeenth centuries and involved a great deal of building onto the Great Wall.  It was followed by the Qing Dynasty and what would become the Republic of China.  The Saadi Dynasty occurred in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Morocco, the Nair Dynasty was in India, and the Yamato Dynasty started in 660 BCE in Japan.  The Yamato Dynasty is ongoing- it's a term used to refer to Japan and its people as a whole.\r Yeah...that vase was kind of priceless.  Now I can't appraise it on \"Antique Roadshow\", like all other priceless heirlooms. \n"}, {"text": "Night fell and I realized I'd need to head to bed and leave the broken window behind.  As soon as I headed to bed, I passed the front room to find a nocturnal creature from the Procyonid family rooting around.  There was no masking the truth- I needed to get this window fixed.\n\nWhat animal was in my house?", "correct": "Raccoon", "options": ["Skunk", "Ring-tailed lemur", "Aardvark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaccoon.\n\n\tRaccoons are excellent scavengers and tend to eat almost anything they can get their little paws on.  Found in almost all of North America and Japan (and parts of Europe), raccoons are one of only a few types of creatures in the Procyonid family along with the Kinkajou, the Coati, and the Olingo.  Raccoons are nocturnal creatures for the most part.  As many know, raccoon tails have rings while their faces have dark markings resembling masks.\r That was it- I needed to stay up.  Nothing would come in my window anymore.  I shooed the raccoon back out the window with a broom, brought a chair in, and decided to sit through the night. \n"}, {"text": "I started to nod off when something odd happened at my window- not one, but three individual balloons floated in through the window.  I woke up and realized I was not dreaming.\n\nIf a certain song by Nena were to be believed, how many more should I expect?", "correct": "Ninety-six", "options": ["Seven", "Forty-two", "Seventy-one"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNinety-six.\n\n\t\"99 Luftballons\" was recorded back in 1982 and became a one-hit wonder for Nena.  Often regarded as an exemplar of eighties Europop, the song has been remade a number of times since by punk bands, pop singers, and others.  The song itself is about two kids who buy a bag of red balloons, let them fly, and accidentally trigger a nuclear war.  It hit number one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in 1984.\r It was amazing the balloons didn't pop on the way in through the broken window.  I popped them myself, threw them out, and put on a pot of coffee.  No more sleeping.  Couldn't afford to sleep. \n"}, {"text": "Expecting the worst, I stayed up the rest of the night.  When the moon rose in the sky, a woman came to the window and I immediately turned her away.  The person whose house she was looking for was down the street.\n\nWhose house was she supposed to be crawling into?", "correct": "Melissa Etheridge's", "options": ["Alanis Morissette's", "Justin Timberlake's", "Paul McCartney's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMelissa Etheridge's.\n\n\t\"Come to my window\rCrawl inside, wait by the light\rof the moon\rCome to my window\rI'll be home soon\"\r Melissa Etheridge's \"Come to My Window\" was a hit for the singer back in 1994 reaching number twenty-five on the Billboard Hot 100, but also charting on five other Billboard charts.  Etheridge won a Grammy for her song (her second).  In later years she'd win an Academy Award for Best Original Song (for \"I Need to Wake Up\" in \"An Inconvenient Truth\").  \"Yes I Am\", Etheridge's fourth album, contained both \"Come to My Window\" and \"I'm the Only One\", both of which are some of her most famous songs and her highest-charting.\r The only reason I could tell that this girl wasn't going to McCartney's place was because she didn't attempt to go in through the bathroom window.  It would only be a few more hours before sunrise. \n"}, {"text": "The morning came and after several geese, a milkman, and a frisbee made their way through the window when my back was turned, I was finally greeting the repairman at the door.  I told him I needed a square window; he said he only installed rose windows.\n\nWhat was the shape of the window he brought with him?", "correct": "Circle", "options": ["Rectangle", "Triangle", "Square"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCircle.\n\n\tA rose window is circular and, like a wheel window, consists of radiating spokes.  Unfortunately, my house never has been a Gothic cathedral and this repairman's only window is stained glass.  Rose windows of elaborate detail are commonly seen around the world, especially in some of the most famous churches and cathedrals of Europe.  That doesn't mean the circular window is exclusive to this period though; rose windows and wheel windows are common in Baroque architecture as well as in modern construction.  They just don't happen to fit my front room frame.\r I thanked the repairman and sent him on his way.  I called another and hoped for the best.  He's on his way now, but until he arrives I have no choice but to stand here, armed and ready, to protect my front room. \n"}]}
