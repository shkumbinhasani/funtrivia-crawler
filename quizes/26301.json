{"id": "26301", "name": "Macintosh Troubleshooting for OS 9 Online Trivia | Sci / Tech | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Computers", "Macintosh"], "questions": [{"text": "A not-too-computer-literate user comes up to you and complains that he can no longer open the application Microsoft Word. What's the first question you should ask him?", "correct": "Are you trying to run the program from the Apple Menu?", "options": ["Did you throw Microsoft Word in the trash?", "Why the heck do you want to give Bill Gates any money anyway?", "Could you take a number please and I'll get back to you next year?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAre you trying to run the program from the Apple Menu?.\n\n\tIn my experience, most users don't understand that Apple Menu items are just aliases to their programs, and that if the program is moved somewhere new on the hard drive, the alias will no longer work. Fixing the alias usually makes 'em happy. \n"}, {"text": "You keep getting Type 2 system errors when you try to open Diablo II. What should you do?", "correct": "Allocate more memory to the application", "options": ["Defragment your hard drive", "Quit playing games and get back to work!", "Accept the fact that your computer is now possessed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAllocate more memory to the application.\n\n\tType 2 errors are typically produced when not enough memory is allotted to an application. Memory allotment procedures are different depending on what system software you are running, but all are done from the Get Info dialog box for the application. \n"}, {"text": "Someone played a practical joke, and now your monitor is displaying a set of graphics comparing George W Bush and a chimpanzee. You are appalled at the insult to the poor chimp and wish to switch your desktop picture back to the Budweiser frogs. Under system 9.1, what control panel could you use?", "correct": "Appearance", "options": ["General Controls", "Monitors", "Wazzup???"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAppearance.\n\n\tClick on the Desktop tab and just drag over the picture that you want! \n"}, {"text": "While working on your Mac, you notice a little eyeball on your menu bar. What the heck is going on?", "correct": "Your Network Administrator is watching you", "options": ["Big Brother is watching you", "It's a reflection of your own bleary eyes", "It's a little too much o' the hooch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYour Network Administrator is watching you.\n\n\tIt's a neat little feature of Network Security, so the admin can track down things like how many people are using a Filemaker Pro database, typing data into Excel...or downloading the latest hits from Napster! \n"}, {"text": "Oh oh! Your monitor is dead! Before you pull out your hair, what should you do?", "correct": "Check the brightness and contrast controls", "options": ["Pull out your Uzi", "Start CPR", "Buy a Windows computer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheck the brightness and contrast controls.\n\n\tI can't think of how many times I have seen this one...some kiddo turns the brightness control all the way off and panic ensues... \n"}, {"text": "You want to print a few pages from that -special- site. Your printer is currently set to the boring ol' black-and-white LaserJet, and you want to use the snazzy new color printer your boss just put on the network. What do you open?", "correct": "The Chooser", "options": ["Your last paycheck ever", "A copy of Playboy- no way I know how to do this stuff!", "The Control Panel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Chooser.\n\n\tYou use the Chooser under the Apple menu to choose printers, servers, etc. \n"}, {"text": "Someone sends you an important attachment that you need right away. It's called something like Hassenpfeffer.sit.hqx. What should you do?", "correct": "Open it with Aladdin Expander or a similar program", "options": ["Untie your tongue after trying to pronounce it", "Run it through the AltaVista Babelfish translator to see what the heck it means", "Nothing- it isn't a Mac file"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOpen it with Aladdin Expander or a similar program.\n\n\tThis file has been compressed so it takes up less disk space. It needs to be uncompressed before you can use it. \n"}, {"text": "You want to rebuild your desktop on a Mac. What do you do?", "correct": "Restart and hold down the Command-Option keys", "options": ["Choose 'Rebuild Desktop' from the Control Panel", "Take a trip to Ikea", "Call a good carpenter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRestart and hold down the Command-Option keys.\n\n\tThe desktop file is the invisible file in which the Mac stores icons, folder locations and comments associated with files. Rebuilding the Desktop reestablishes lost links. A common sign that it needs to be done is when your program icons start showing up as generic application icons. \n"}, {"text": "Your ever-helpful technogeek tells you that you need to zap your PRAM. What do you do?", "correct": "After the startup chime, hold down Command-Option-P-R", "options": ["Stick your finger in an electric socket", "Get the Uzi back out and start looking for a baby carriage", "Unplug the computer and plug it in again"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAfter the startup chime, hold down Command-Option-P-R.\n\n\tA lot of vague, nonspecific and otherwise troublesome problems seem to somehow be connected to the parameter RAM, or PRAM. PRAM holds various setting such as the clock time, date, startup drive, etc. Resetting- zapping- this PRAM often fixes these problems. \n"}, {"text": "Are computer memory and computer hard drive space the same thing?", "correct": "No, no, a thousand times no!", "options": ["Only on Tuesdays", "Sure!", "Yeah, about $99.98 at Radio Shack"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo, no, a thousand times no!.\n\n\tYou guessed it- they are different entities! \rComputer memory can be RAM (Random Access Memory - used as working storage) or ROM (Read Only Memory - stores some fixed data that always needs to be available). Hard disks are considered storage, not memory. The difference is that a processor can directly access data in memory but data on storage media must first be copied into memory. \n"}]}
