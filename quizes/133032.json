The Captain is rewarded for suggesting that there is a chance he has survived. \n"}, {"text": "According to the Captain he knows Illyria well because of which of the following reasons?", "correct": "He was born and bred just three hours away from the spot they stand on.", "options": ["He had been held prisoner in Illyria for many years.", "He was a traveller to this country when he first went to sea.", "His relations all moved there when he was very young."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was born and bred just three hours away from the spot they stand on.\n\n\tThe Captain speaks of Orsino, the Duke of Illyria, with the authority of someone who knows him and the country very well. He declares that he only left Illyria a month before. \n"}, {"text": "As well as her brother which other relation of Olivia's has died within the last few years?", "correct": "her father", "options": ["her sister", "her mother", "her cousin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nher father.\n\n\tOlivia's father died about a year before the opening of the play and her brother has died more recently. She has been plunged into mourning by this double tragedy, though it is specifically the death of her brother that has made her swear to avoid the company of men. \n"}, {"text": "In what way does Viola hope to make her living at the court of Orsino?", "correct": "by singing", "options": ["by becoming his secretary", "by becoming his messenger", "by telling him stories"], "explanation": "\n\n\nby singing.\n\n\tViola does become Orsino's messenger but her original intention was to pretend to be a eunuch and to sing to him. It is to be noticed that Viola is a woman of some spirit and makes her own plans for the future that are bold and daring. She is not lacking in confidence even though she has just been part of quite a traumatic experience. \n"}, {"text": "To what does Sir Toby Belch say he drinks every night?", "correct": "the health of his niece Olivia", "options": ["the good fortune of his friend Sir Andrew Aguecheek", "the confounding of his enemy Malvolio", "the beauty of the servant maid Maria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe health of his niece Olivia.\n\n\tMaria is trying to get Sir Toby to restrain his behaviour and to avoid late nights and drunkenness. Sir Andrew is more Sir Toby's dupe than his friend. \n"}, {"text": "What does Sir Andrew blame for his \"dull wits\"?", "correct": "the fact that he eats too much beef", "options": ["the fact that he stays up too late with Sir Toby", "the fact that he drinks too much Canary wine", "the fact that the climate is too hot and sultry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe fact that he eats too much beef.\n\n\tIt was once a superstition that beef was supposed to make a man dull and slow-witted. Thus the English \"rosbif\" was a term of abuse used by the French about the English. The English, of course, referred to the French as \"frogs\". \n"}, {"text": "Why does Orsino believe that Viola (in her disguise as Cesario) will have some success in pushing forward his love suit with Olivia?", "correct": "because Viola is young and not like a man", "options": ["because Olivia has started to sing again", "because Viola is a persistent person", "because Olivia is now open to messengers again"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbecause Viola is young and not like a man.\n\n\tOrsino believes that Olivia is more likely to listen to someone young and not like a man. Viola's voice is like a young girl's and she even looks like a girl. (Hardly surprising but we must remember that Shakespeare wrote this part for a boy to act as a girl.) \n"}, {"text": "How does Feste manage to prove that Olivia is the one who should be identified as the fool?", "correct": "He points out she is mourning for her brother who has gone to heaven.", "options": ["He points out that she could marry Orsino and be happy.", "He says she is rich, young and beautiful but remains unhappy.", "He says that she has sent him away when he could cheer her."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe points out she is mourning for her brother who has gone to heaven.\n\n\tThe logic is that Olivia appears to be weeping for her dead brother. However, her brother stood so high in her estimation that she is sure that he has gone to heaven. Heaven is the place of promised happiness. Thus Olivia is a fool for weeping at her brother's happiness. Feste has given a good demonstration of his wits. \n"}, {"text": "How does Olivia prepare for Viola's entry on the first occasion that she comes as Cesario?", "correct": "by getting Maria to put a veil over her face", "options": ["by getting Maria to give her a fan to hide behind", "by getting Maria to prepare a private seat to hide in", "by getting Maria to have Malvolio ready to intervene"], "explanation": "\n\n\nby getting Maria to put a veil over her face.\n\n\tOlivia is covered with a veil. Later, upon being requested by Viola, she pulls back the veil and says she is showing the picture. Viola cheekily says that she looks well - \"if God did all\". This mixture of flattery and impudence is the means of charming Olivia that Viola employs. \n"}, {"text": "After Viola has gone Olivia knows that she has fallen in love with him (Cesario). To what does she compare this quick falling into love?", "correct": "catching the plague", "options": ["tumbling over a cliff", "being dangerously drunk", "being struck by an arrow"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncatching the plague.\n\n\tLove is compared with a dangerous illness.

Malvolio is probably correct in his observations but his manner of telling them off is too pompous to get the audience's sympathy. \n"}, {"text": "What is the theme of the song sung by Feste to the Duke? ", "correct": "It is about death and being killed by a cruel fair maid.", "options": ["It is about the happiness of love returned by a fair maid.", "It is about the trials and tribulations of a clown.", "It is about the joy of a life on the ocean wave."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is about death and being killed by a cruel fair maid.\n\n\tThe Duke wants sad songs and Feste sings, \"Come away, come away death, And in sad cypress let me be laid.\"\r    This is possibly a joke by Feste at the expense of the love-sick Duke who seems to be over-indulging in melancholy. \n"}, {"text": "To whom is Viola referring when she says, \"She sat like Patience on a monument, Smiling at grief..\"", "correct": "an imaginary vision of herself", "options": ["Viola's mother", "an imaginary vision of Maria thinking of Sir Toby", "an imaginary vision of Olivia thinking of her dead brother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nan imaginary vision of herself.\n\n\tIt is Viola, now deeply in love with Orsino but unable to tell him, who thinks of what is going to happen to her because she is unable to declare her love. \n"}, {"text": "To which fish does Maria compare Malvolio when she sets the letter down for him to find?", "correct": "a trout", "options": ["a perch", "a pike", "a minnow"], "explanation": "\n\n\na trout.\n\n\tShe compares Malvolio with a trout that can be taught with tickling.
