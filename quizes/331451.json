Romero flick cornered a small group of people in an old farmhouse.  As the night wore on, things never really relented and boarding up the doors and windows proved ineffective when people started running out of the house.  What movie was it?", "correct": "Night of the Living Dead", "options": ["Night of Ghouls", "Creep Night", "A Night in the Cemetery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight of the Living Dead.\n\n\tOne of the earliest zombie films ever released, \"Night of the Living Dead\" was the first in a series of films by George A. Romero (released over several decades) to deal with mindless undead creatures wreaking havoc on society.  In this first film, a group of survivors boarded themselves up in a farmhouse as zombies closed in on their location.  As day turned to night, things seemed to get worse.  By sunrise, no one would be left standing.\r\"Night of the Living Dead\" is, perhaps, one of the most profitable horror films ever released.  With inflation, the original in the series has earned over $650,000,000 in over forty years.  Since the film has been released in the public domain, unofficial remakes and rereleases have appeared as well.  Zombies have since infected the horror scene with innovative stories and releases. \n"}, {"text": "Some kids in this 1988 movie decided to hold a seance ritual in a crematorium.  It wasn't a good idea.  Quite the gory cult movie, it was remade in 2009 with Shannon Elizabeth.  What was this film?", "correct": "Night of the Demons", "options": ["Seance Night", "Nightfire", "Night at the Morgue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight of the Demons.\n\n\tOriginally a gory cult classic in which teens decided to perform ancient rituals inside a crematorium (bad idea), \"Night of the Demons\" was released in 1988 to a slight unexpected success.  Despite a small limited release, the movie earned over $3,000,000 and two sequels were made (in 1994 and 1997, the latter of which went straight-to-DVD).\rThe remake, released in 2009 (on DVD after a brief stint in horror film festivals) was originally slated to appear in limited theaters but distributors opted for this Shannon Elizabeth-starring movie to hit shelves quicker.  The film followed the plot of the original, but was set in a mansion rather than a crematorium.  1980s Scream Queen Linnea Quigley also made a cameo (and surprisingly kept her clothes on). \n"}, {"text": "Tina Fey and Steve Carell certainly had an interesting night in this 2010 film.  What movie, also starring Mark Wahlberg, did they star in?", "correct": "Date Night", "options": ["Fight Night", "Ladies Night", "The Night After"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDate Night.\n\n\tA box office hit, \"Date Night\" placed second in the box office in its debut week and earned over $150,000,000 over the course of its time in theaters.  Both Tina Fey and Steve Carell, prime-time comedy mainstays, starred in a relatively large cast of known stars including Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, James Franco, and Ray Liotta (amongst others).  What happened on this particular night?  Well...after stealing a table reservation at an upscale restaurant to break free of their typical date night ritual, they found themselves in a horrible predicament involving prison and mobsters. \n"}, {"text": "In what 1984 film did a man dressed as Santa Claus kill his victims, claiming that they were \"Naughty\"?", "correct": "Silent Night, Deadly Night", "options": ["Winter Night", "Christmas Night", "The Nightmare Before Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilent Night, Deadly Night.\n\n\tCertainly the odd cult classic horror film, \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\" was kind of weird.  The film opened with Billy going to visit his grandfather on Christmas Eve and receiving a less-than-stellar piece of advice about Santa punishing naughty children.  Shortly thereafter, on the drive home, his parents were killed by a man in a Santa outfit.  It didn't bode well for Billy who decided to take this mind-numbingly bad example to heart.  For the rest of the movie, Billy decided to take out revenge on 'naughty' (which he deemed was every character to be fair).\r\"Silent Night, Deadly Night\" was banned in the UK and highly-criticized by critics.  It didn't stop people- four more were made over the years.  The fifth one also contained Mickey Rooney- don't worry; I don't know why either. \n"}, {"text": "The second film in this Ben Stiller franchise took place at the Smithsonian.  What movie in which otherwise inanimate things came to life at night was this?", "correct": "Night at the Museum", "options": ["It Happened at Night", "Nightlife", "The Dark of Night"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight at the Museum.\n\n\tDirected by the same man who directed \"Date Night\" (Shawn Levy), \"Night at the Museum\" was one of 2006's most profitable films (ranking fifth for the year).  In the first movie, Ben Stiller played a night watchman at a museum.  When the doors were locked and the lights went out, the museum would come to life as if by magic. The sequel, \"Night at the Museum: Battle at the Smithsonian\", brought Stiller back to a different museum in 2009.  Combined, the two films brought in over $1,000,000,000 in the box office.  Other stars appearing in both films included Owen Wilson, Amy Adams, Hank Azaria, Robin Williams, Ricky Gervais, Brad Garrett, and Carla Gugino. \n"}, {"text": "Christian Bale starred as Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan's 2008 film, \"The Dark Night\".", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tClose, but not quite.  This night was actually \"The Dark Knight\" in which Batman was the title character.  Christopher Nolan followed up on his major Batman overhaul, \"Batman Begins\", with this renowned film starring Christian Bale (as Batman), Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine. This movie followed Batman, the vigilante superhero of Gotham City, as he took on the Joker and Two-Face.  The film was an immediate blockbuster and it took in over $1,000,000,000 in box office gross sales breaking records for its box office opening weekend.  It also became the top-grossing non-James Cameron film then made (\"Titanic\" still beat it by $800,000 and \"Avatar\", released the following year, would beat it as well).  Heath Ledger, who passed away shortly after filming, posthumously won the 'Best Supporting Actor' Oscar for his role in the film. \n"}, {"text": "In 2008, this horror film was remade.  While the original movie starred Jamie Lee Curtis, the remake starred Brittany Snow.  What movie was it?", "correct": "Prom Night", "options": ["Night Lies", "Graduation Night", "Homecoming Night"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProm Night.\n\n\tOn what may erroneously have been regarded as the best night of her teenage life, one girl (played by Brittany Snow) found out that prom night was the perfect night for the man who killed her parents to come back and claim her (and her friends).  The film was universally panned by critics, but it sold enough in the box office (almost $60,000,000) to negate that fact. The original film starred scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and was released in 1980.  It was followed by three sequels before the remake showed up in theaters.  The only real connection between the original and the remake was the fact that they took place on the same night...and had the same title. It wasn't really a good night for anybody. \n"}, {"text": "In this Adam Sandler animated film, a character who looked distinctly like Adam Sandler celebrated Hanukkah.  What was the name of this 2002 movie?", "correct": "Eight Crazy Nights & 8 Crazy Nights", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight Crazy Nights & 8 Crazy Nights.\n\n\t\"Eight Crazy Nights\", Sandler's first animated film, followed an Adam Sandler doppelganger named Davey who, after nearly heading to prison, was forced to coach basketball.  Over the course of the film, several characters with Sandler as their voice actor showed up and the true meaning of Hanukkah was revealed.  Critics never really enjoyed it and, judging by its box office totals, the viewers didn't either.  It did, however, result in Adam Sandler's third iteration of the \"Chanukah Song\". \n"}, {"text": "Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan vowed to get into a popular Los Angeles nightclub in which 1998 movie based on a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch?", "correct": "A Night at the Roxbury", "options": ["Talladega Nights", "Nights of Glory", "Los Angeles Nights"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Night at the Roxbury.\n\n\tStarring as the Butabi brothers, Kattan and Ferrell made their way through the Los Angeles club scene with their synthetic suits, spray-on sideburns, and horrible pick-up lines in this \"Saturday Night Live\"-based movie.  Also starring Molly Shannon, Jennifer Coolidge, and Lochlyn Munro, the film followed the guys- and they actually made it into the Roxbury at one point!  On one fateful night when Richard Grieco hit their car, they gained entry to their prospective goal, met the owner, and vowed to make their own club.  It wasn't that easy though...\rThe movie made over $30,000,000 in the box office despite critical panning.  It's particularly known for its inclusion of specific 1990s dance songs (including \"What is Love?\" and several Ace of Base hits). \n"}, {"text": "Starring Josh Hartnett, what comic book-based vampire film set in Alaska was released in 2007?", "correct": "30 Days of Night", "options": ["Night of the Vampire", "Nightwatch", "Blood of the Night"], "explanation": "\n\n\n30 Days of Night.\n\n\tBased on a comic series by Steve Niles, \"30 Days of Night\" was a rather original take on vampire fare.  When the town of Barrow, Alaska, one of the northernmost inhabited towns in North America, reached a certain point in the year, many people would leave the area for its consistent thirty days of night (created by the globe's tilted axis).  Unfortunately, when some people got stuck in the town during this time with no way out, they realized that vampires emerged to make the town their home. Josh Hartnett and Melissa George starred in this stylized take on the series which was followed in 2010 by a straight-to-DVD sequel, \"30 Days of Night: Dark Days\".  The original film earned over $75,000,000 upon its 2007 release and obtained fairly positive reviews. Director David Slade followed the film up with more vampire fare; he directed \"Eclipse\" (of the \"Twilight\" saga) in 2010. \n"}]}
