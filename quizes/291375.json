{"id": "291375", "name": "\"COTT\" - \"The Blizzard of Oz\" Quiz | Crash Bandicoot Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Crash Bandicoot Games", "Crash of the Titans"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the shape of the entrance?", "correct": "Magmadon's entire body", "options": ["Magmadon's fist", "Magmadon's shell", "Magmadon's face"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagmadon's entire body.\n\n\tThe beginning of the level looks like the entire Magmadon's body.  You can get the best view of this in the concept art of the level.  You begin the level by sliding down the giant Magmadon's arm, and you fight Magmadon's for the first time on the giant Magmadon's face.  Three pools of lava act as the Magmadon's teeth.  The actual cave you enter is the shell of the Magmadon. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following insects drills into the lava?", "correct": "Mosquito", "options": ["Spider", "Bee", "Butterfly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMosquito.\n\n\tThe giant mechanical mosquito is a creation of Cortex.  You must destroy each of the giant mosquitoes by destroying its power source. \n"}, {"text": "Where is the first Spy Toilet?", "correct": "In the lava", "options": ["Near the drilling insect", "Around the first corner", "On a ledge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the lava.\n\n\tThe only way to get to this Spy Toilet is to jack a Magmadon.  Lava does not phase a Magmadon, and it actually rather likes it  Make sure you have jacked a Magmadon before jumping into the lava instead of a Spike!  They can sometimes look pretty similar if you aren't careful.  Falling in lava will cause you to die instantly. \n"}, {"text": "How many blue things must you destroy to defeat each of the giant insects?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Three", "Four", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tFor every giant mosquito, there are two blue electromagnetic things.  Destroying these will in turn destroy the giant mosquito, as they draw their energy from these. \n"}, {"text": "After defeating the insects, what must you crawl across to get to the next part?", "correct": "Giant insect parts", "options": ["Nothing", "Magmadon shells", "The pathway that opens up"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGiant insect parts.\n\n\tWhen a giant mosquito is destroyed, he falls into the lava.  When he hits the lava, a bunch of metal parts of the mosquito rise to the surface.  You must climb across these to access the next section of the level. \n"}, {"text": "Does the path you use to get to the other side of the area sink into the lava?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tMost of the mosquito parts you use to get to the next part fall into the lava if you stand on them too long.  The giant gears do not fall into the lava, but all the others parts do.  If you stand there for too long, you will die in the lava. \n"}, {"text": "What do you do in the mojo room?", "correct": "Collect green mojo", "options": ["Destroy bombs", "Jack the mother enemy", "Destroy all enemies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCollect green mojo.\n\n\tIn this mojo room, you collect a total of 5,000 green mojo.  The mojo room is called \"Hazardous Habits\".  Once you collect 5,000 green mojo, you get the voodoo doll. \n"}, {"text": "What animal wants to eat your face?", "correct": "Tiger", "options": ["Cheetah", "Lion", "Leopard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTiger.\n\n\tThis tiger is upset with you, so he wants to eat your face.

He has a high pitched voice. \n"}, {"text": "What is behind the door of this level?", "correct": "Shellephant", "options": ["Rhinoroller", "Magmadon", "Scorporilla"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShellephant.\n\n\tWhen you get close enough to the door, a Shellephant will burst through and try to attack you.  If you have already jacked a Magmadon, you can attack the Shellephant until you can jack him.  If you haven't already jacked a Magmadon, the fight will get tougher, because you have a Shellephant attacking you while you are trying to jack a Magmadon.  You can't jack a Shellephant without a Magmadon. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only word spoken in this level by Crash?", "correct": "Nina", "options": ["Neo", "Cortex", "Cocoa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNina.\n\n\tThe only word ever spoken by Crash Bandicoot in this game is \"Nina\".  He says this when the tiger tells him that Nina is behind all of the madness, not Neo.  Crash and Aku Aku are used to Neo being in charge, so learning it was Nina caught them off guard. \n"}]}
