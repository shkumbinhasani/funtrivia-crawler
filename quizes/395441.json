{"id": "395441", "name": "Maybe You're the Super Star! Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games L-P", "Mario Games"], "questions": [{"text": "There are one hundred twenty stars in what 3D platformer featuring Yoshi in a rooftop hiding place?", "correct": "Super Mario 64", "options": ["Super Mario Run", "Super Mario 3D World", "Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Mario 64.\n\n\tAlthough collecting all 120 stars across the fifteen worlds and main hub world (Princess Peach's Castle) in \"Super Mario 64\" may be a tall order, it's the only way to access the cannon in the courtyard and shoot yourself to the roof to visit Yoshi.  \"Super Mario 64\" was one of the earliest games on the Nintendo 64 console and set the stage for a series of 3D platformers as gamers emerged from the largely 2D sidescrolling era that featured the SNES.  Players could find six stars per level in \"Super Mario 64\" plus one for collecting Red Coins in addition to locating several throughout secret levels and the main castle. \n"}, {"text": "In what game are Mario's stars replaced by Shine Sprites?", "correct": "Super Mario Sunshine & Sunshine", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Mario Sunshine & Sunshine.\n\n\tWhile Shine Sprites are technically stars (since they're shiny suns!), they replace the typical five-pointed Starman that can be found in many of the earlier games, going full-force into the general aesthetic of Gamecube's \"Super Mario Sunshine\".  Set in a tropical island paradise (Delfino Isle), the game is all about the luxe vacation destination and Mario's subsequent criminal life as he's sentenced to a community service clean-up job for a crime he never committed.  Collecting enough Shine Sprites allows him to battle Bowser on Corona Mountain in the end of the game. \n"}, {"text": "The person who collects the most stars in which game is deemed 'the Super Star'?", "correct": "Mario Party", "options": ["Mario Golf", "Mario Tennis", "Mario Kart: Double Dash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMario Party.\n\n\tWhile much of the point behind this board game-themed party series involves purchasing, finding, or stealing stars, the whole premise is built around accumulating enough of them to become a Super Star yourself, and at the end of the game, the person with the most regular stars will win despite any additional items or coins obtained or games won.  In early games in the series, Stars could be purchased for 20 coins or stolen from other players (by Boo) for 50, but with so many games in the series, the formula has definitely shaken up several times over. \n"}, {"text": "In what SNES RPG does Mario fight alongside Geno, an animated wooden doll with the power of the stars?", "correct": "The Legend of the Seven Stars", "options": ["Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga", "Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle", "Super Mario Maker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Legend of the Seven Stars.\n\n\t\"The Legend of the Seven Stars\", made in a partnership between Nintendo and Square, was one of the more solidly-constructed RPGs of the SNES era, combining the turn-based RPG style of \"Final Fantasy\" and \"Chrono Trigger\" with the aesthetic and general enjoyment of a \"Mario\" game.  Mario needs to cross through the lands collecting seven star fragments to stop an evil foe, and along the way he and his party (including Mallow, Geno, Toadstool, and Bowser) must use their skills to topple evil. Geno, in particular, is interesting because he harnesses star power for the majority of his attacks, striking with shimmering magic at every turn despite being made of wood. \n"}, {"text": "The Star Spirits need to be saved once the Star Rod falls into Bowser's claws in which of these games?", "correct": "Paper Mario", "options": ["Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins", "New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe", "New Super Mario Bros. Wii"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaper Mario.\n\n\tThe first \"Paper Mario\" title, a turn-based RPG featuring 2D characters in an otherwise 3D world, sent Mario around a new Mushroom Kingdom in an attempt to locate the Star Spirits, the power of whom, combined, would allow him to defeat Bowser, the new possessor of the Star Rod.  In the beginning of the game saw Bowser invade a swanky party in Peach's Castle at which point he lifted the building into outer space in an attempt to get some alone-time with Peach, herself.  In \"The Thousand Year Door\" (the sequel to this game, on Gamecube), Mario collected seven Crystal Stars instead. \n"}, {"text": "If you can gauge the gravity of each situation in this 2007 Wii game, you can collect the Power Stars to save Princess Peach.  What's the game's title?", "correct": "Super Mario Galaxy & Galaxy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Mario Galaxy & Galaxy.\n\n\tThe first of the Wii platformers in the \"Mario\" series, \"Super Mario Galaxy\" takes the typical fun of navigating unique worlds and collecting stars and coins and blasts it into outer space, sending Mario on a trip to numerous planets, stars, and satellites to collect Power Stars and save Princess Peach once again, this time with the help of Rosalina and the creatures of the Comet Observatory.  The game was so popular and well-received that it ended up getting a direct sequel three years later in 2010, which also came out on the Wii. \n"}, {"text": "In which game would use of a star would give you temporary invincibility?", "correct": "Super Mario World", "options": ["Hotel Mario", "Mario is Missing!", "Dr. Mario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Mario World.\n\n\tIn early \"Mario\" platformers, the goal of the star (or Starman) was to grant Mario temporary invincibility to hits taken from all enemies throughout the game though it would never be able to save Mario from environmental woes (like pitfalls) and would run out after a short amount of time.  Perhaps the most powerful item in the NES games, the star would later feature heavily throughout the \"Mario\" franchise and take on the status as an elevated motif along with coins, mushrooms, and fire flowers. \n"}, {"text": "In what game would three Star Cards result in five extra lives if collected at the end of three successive levels?", "correct": "Super Mario Bros. 3", "options": ["Super Mario Odyssey", "Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island", "New Super Mario Bros."], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 3\n\n\tAlthough stars still play the invincibility role in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", they also make a couple of other interesting appearances in the NES title \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", considered by many to be the pinnacle of early \"Mario\" platformers.  In addition to being able to start levels with a star if found outside of the main stages (ie. in chests or in match games), Mario can also collect stars via cards at the end of each regular stage. While these star cards won't give Mario a star, collecting any three cards (mushroom, fire flower, or star) will give an automatic one-up.  Three mushrooms in a row gives two lives, three flowers gives three lives, and three stars gives five. \n"}, {"text": "Rosalina appears with the Lumas in \"Super Mario Galaxy\", but they both also appear as playable characters (as a duo) in what other game featuring Mario?", "correct": "Super Smash Bros. 3DS/Wii U", "options": ["NBA Street V3", "Soul Calibur 4", "Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. 3DS/Wii U\n\n\tIn \"Super Mario Galaxy\", a Luma is actually responsible for picking up most of the Star Chips that can be found in both \"Galaxy\" games on the Wii, and if you play with a second player on another Wii Remote, they can be the ones to collect the items.  This game was also the first to feature Rosalina though she returned for \"Mario Kart Wii\" and later games, usually alongside a Luma of her own.  In \"Super Smash Bros. 3DS/Wii U\", Rosalina and Luma appeared as playable characters.  They would return for \"Ultimate\" in 2018. \n"}, {"text": "Although the stars were green in one game, they turned to gold stars in what \"Mario\" spin-off title featuring someone other than Mario as the main character?", "correct": "Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker", "options": ["Luigi's Mansion", "Yoshi's Story", "Super Princess Peach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Toad: Treasure Tracker.\n\n\tCaptain Toad, as a character, first appeared in some of the more simplistic levels of \"Super Mario 3D World\" on the Wii U, and while his appearances were brief, he made enough of an impact to lead Nintendo to create a spin-off game called \"Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker\" to bridge the gap between the earlier title and the later-to-arrive \"Super Mario Odyssey\" on the Switch. Like Mario, Captain Toad is preoccupied with collecting stars, and while these were green during his early appearances on the Wii U, they shifted in colour to the typical gold star seen in other \"Mario\" games.  There was one gold star hidden in every level. \n"}]}
