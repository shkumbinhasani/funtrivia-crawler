No one is thrilled.  Everyone is disappointed with Will's song selection this week because they can't relate to, as Kurt puts it, \"silk-smooth adult contemporary\".  Instead, as per a growing Facebook campaign, they want to perform a song by Britney Spears for the fall homecoming assembly. Will is against this and, surprisingly, so is Brittany, who reveals that her full name is Brittany S. Pierce for the first time and claims that she has always been in the shadow of Britney Spears. She asks her fellows club members to allow her to escape the torment of Britney Spears and Will figures that this is a good reason.  Onward with easy listening. \n"}, {"text": "Which student turns out to have tons of plaque on their teeth during Carl's demonstration in the choir room?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Santana", "Finn", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tDiscussing the Britney Spears issue with Emma in the guidance office, the topic of conversation soon switches to her relationship with Carl, her dentist, and the fact that she's been loosening up because of him.  That's when Carl stops in for a surprise visit.  He introduces himself to Will and gets a page about a dentistry issue claiming that none of the kids at McKinley will have their teeth when they're thirty.  Will decides to ask Carl to come to the choir room to give a talk about dental hygiene to the kids.\rIn the halls, the football bullies steal Finn's McKinley jacket and tear it in half because of his ousting from the team.  Before a fight can start, Artie intervenes and apologizes for getting him kicked out.  The bullies decide not to fight, but Beiste sees the truth from down the hall.\rIn the choir room, Carl gives each of the kids a small capsule which, when chewed, will dye plaque blue if there is any on their teeth.  Brittany is the worst offender claiming that she drinks Dr. Pepper all the time because she thinks he's a dentist, Artie also comes up blue, and surprisingly, Rachel has a bad case of plaque, a fact she is in shock over. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the Glee Club does Carl state has sixty-eight cavities?", "correct": "Brittany", "options": ["Tina", "Mercedes", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrittany.\n\n\tBrittany is the first to get an appointment (which is probably a good thing- Carl informs her that she has cavities in every tooth).  When Carl puts her under with anesthesia, he also turns on the radio to a Britney Spears song, something Brittany doesn't realize until it's too late.  When she goes under, she finds herself in the music video for Britney Spears' \"I'm a Slave 4 U\".  Upon awakening, she's happy she got to pet a snake in her dream.  Carl informs her that she'll need to come back the next day for more work on her sixty-eight cavities.\rAt school, Finn is still worried about not being on the football team.  Rachel is glad.  She as always worried he'd run off with some cheerleader or fall into a coma.  She claims that she wants to be the only thing that makes him feel good.  When Santana makes fun of Rachel for the way she dresses, Finn doesn't stand up for her.  Like Rachel, he decides to be 'honest'. \n"}, {"text": "After an outburst regarding Britney Spears in the choir room, Will sends which student to the principal's office?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Brittany", "Mike", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tThe next day, Brittany heads back to Carl's office, this time with Santana (who has perfect teeth).  Santana claims that her's dad's a 'real doctor' and that she has a killer health care plan.  Because of this, she wants to get anesthetized alongside Britney.  When the two of them go under, they both find themselves in the music video for Britney Spears and Madonna's \"Me Against the Music\".  At the end of the song, Britney Spears appears in Brittany's mind and compliments her on her breath.\rThe next day in Glee Club, Will continues to talk about Christopher Cross and Brittany interrupts stating that her fantasy has made her realize that she is more talented and stronger than everyone else in the room and she demand to have every solo from that point forward.  Kurt takes this time to tell Will that everyone actually wants to do the Britney song for the fall homecoming and that he isn't listening because his own personal problems are getting in the way.  When Kurt says that Will needs to be less uptight and to knock it off, Kurt is told to go to the principal's office. \n"}, {"text": "Rachel finds herself in which Britney Spears music video when she goes under with the anesthesia?", "correct": "Baby One More Time", "options": ["Sometimes", "Hold It Against Me", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaby One More Time.\n\n\tWill is the next to go to Carl's dentistry office and it turns out that Carl's a pretty nice guy.  Both of them admit to having strong feelings about Emma, but Carl says that she chose him, so Will should back off- after all, Will would want him to do the same.  It turns out that Will's teeth are grinding.  Carl, coincidentally, blames this on Will's being uptight.  Citing his own experiences, Carl was tired of his own uptight, mundane life and decided to get crazy one day and buy a new Corvette.  It fixed everything.\rWhen Will leaves the office he finds Rachel in the waiting room reading an unauthorized biography of Britney Spears.

Finn is kind of worried that her look is too risque.  Since Finn now feels worried about Rachel leaving him for another guy, Rachel decides that the only way the two of them will work is if they loosen the reins a bit.  She gives her blessing for him to rejoin the football team.\rWill buys a Corvette and brings Emma to the parking lot for a ride with the top down.  She's disappointed with the approach he's taken but doesn't protest to a ride.  They don't get out of the parking lot before Will's ex-wife, Terri, stands in front of the car and tells him to bring it back.

Sue is shocked and decides to try and make Will feel bad by cluing him in to the fact that he's flailing in his struggle to maintain himself after his failed relationships.  She states that Britney Spears is only a bad thing; she's a gateway drug to impulses.  This is when Will decides to use Britney for the fall homecoming, even despite Sue's urgings not to.\rArtie is the final member of New Directions to have a dental appointment and he has a dream about the \"Stronger\" music video in which Tina apologizes for breaking up with him, he gets a spot on the football team, and Britney Spears makes another appearance.

Rachel wants him to quit football, but he says he can't do that.  She decides that he has to choose between her and football.\rIn the auditorium, Will and the kids prepare for their performance.  Will ends up telling Emma that he'll be helping with the performance while Becky alerts Sue to the fact that Britney will be performed.  When New Directions takes to the stage to perform a sexualized, jazzier version of \"Toxic\", the crowd actually enjoys it.  Sue, however, soon pulls the fire alarm fearing a Britney Spears-induced sex riot.  This, of course, causes more panic than necessary. \n"}, {"text": "Does Will win Emma over after the fall homecoming performance?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tSue has a short talk about the previous day and her plan to exact revenge on Will in the staff room because of what happened at the assembly.

Kurt is disappointed that they only got to perform one Britney number, but everyone concedes. Rachel decides to do a performance dedicated to Finn and says that she can't she needs to let him be free because she's being too constricting and it's hurting their relationship.
