{"id": "338932", "name": "\"A Very Glee Christmas\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "Whose name does Will receive from the school staff's 'Secret Santa'?", "correct": "Sue", "options": ["Principal Figgins", "Emma", "Coach Beiste"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSue.\n\n\tEmma goes out of her way to speak to Will because she assumes he's avoiding her.  When he reveals that he's spending Christmas alone this year, she invites him to her and Carl's place for their Christmas Eve party.  Will politely declines as he would rather keep things separate.  When Coach Beiste comes by to hand out names for the staff's Secret Santa, Will is displeased to find that he's pulled Sue's name.\rIn the halls, Brittany and Artie decorate Artie's locker and Brittany reveals that she still believes in Santa.  Artie is surprised, but decides to preserve Brittany's joy about Kris Kringle.  She recommends that he send his list to Santa as soon as possible because the roads to the North Pole are likely getting treacherous. \n"}, {"text": "According to Finn, where did they find the Christmas tree they set up in the choir room?", "correct": "The side of the road", "options": ["In the closet", "Some empty lot", "It was already there to begin with"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe side of the road.\n\n\tIn the choir room, New Directions decorates a tree while singing \"The Most Wonderful Day of the Year\" from the \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" TV special.  Of course, the Island of Misfit Toys theme fits the club members perfectly.  When Mr. Schuester arrives and finds the kids decorating the tree, he asks where everything came from. Finn found the tree at the side of the road and thought it would be best to get into the Christmas spirit, Santana explains that they stole the ornaments from a deceased Christmas hoarder, and Puck snagged the gifts (empty boxes) from a mall display.  Will reasons that it isn't really what Glee Club is about, but Mercedes explains that despite their second annual Sectionals win, they're still not popular at school. Will reiterates that Christmas is about being thankful for the things that they do have and that they'll all be volunteering for a homeless children's program in town by singing carols in the school for donations.  The kids are worried about this, but Finn steps up and says they need to try it. \n"}, {"text": "Who sings \"We Need a Little Christmas\" while caroling in the classrooms?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Rachel", "Tina", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tThe caroling session in the classrooms doesn't go very well.  The kids in the classes don't care for the songs (one says they'd rather be learning, another claims that they're making him hate Christmas).  While Mercedes leads the club in singing \"We Need a Little Christmas\", the classroom teacher throws her shoe at one band member's drum before they leave.\rIn the choir room, the kids worry that they may never become popular or even accepted in the school.  Brittany speaks up and says that this year, she asked Santa for the New Directions to stop being picked on and that if anyone can do it, Santa can.  Everyone is kind of taken aback by this comment and Artie asks them all in private if they can keep up the illusion that Santa is real, at least for Brittany's sake, to preserve the magical feeling.  Meanwhile, Rachel asks Finn if he'll meet her in the auditorium the next day. \n"}, {"text": "Who does not sit on Santa's lap at the mall?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Sam", "Santana", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tTo maintain the illusion that Santa is real for Brittany, Artie and some of the others head to the mall to meet Santa.  The kids are worried that sitting on the lap of a black Santa won't really work, especially for people over the age of six, but Artie assures them that Brittany won't see past the suit.  Mercedes asks for a pony and a doll that laughs and cries, Lauren asks for Puckerman to love her since he's a fox (also, sweet potato fries), Santana asks for bling, Quinn asks for anything for stretch marks, Sam asks for chap stick, Mike asks for Channing Tatum to stop being in stuff, and Tina asks for Asian Santa instead.  When Brittany's turn comes, she says that she wants Artie to be able to walk.\rIn the auditorium, Rachel makes a romantic winter wonderland to try to wow Finn.  Hoping that he'll take her back, she gives him a gift and hopes that he'll accept her apology, but he doesn't feel ready.  When he leaves, she continues to sing anyways and chooses \"Merry Christmas Darling\" by The Carpenters as her song. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Will ask for gift suggestions for his Secret Santa pick?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Emma", "Rachel", "Terri"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tAt Dalton Academy, Blaine visits Kurt with a small radio and asks if he can help out.  Blaine needs to rehearse \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" for a performance he's doing at an amusement park and he needs someone to run through it with him.  After their duet, Will comes in needing a favour.  He asks Kurt how everything is before asking if he'll head to the mall with him to find something to give to Sue for Secret Santa.\rWill inevitably does get a great present for Sue with Kurt's help and when he heads to her office to deliver it, he...and Emma...and Coach Beiste all discover that everyone drew Sue's name after she and Becky created a diversion and switched the names.  All three of them are disgusted that Sue has 'stolen Christmas'. \n"}, {"text": "Sue recruits Becky to steal presents with her.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe tables soon turn on Sue.  After the horrible trick she played on the staff, Will and Beiste look into the legality of Sue's situation and discover that she has no legal rights to the gifts they gave her.  Each and every last present is taken away from her and donated to the homeless youth shelter in town.  On his way out, Will calls Sue a 'grinch'.\rIn the locker room, Artie and the guys approach Coach Beiste with a plan to keep Brittany believing in Santa.  They've rented a suit and they want Beiste to play Santa, break into her house (with her parents' permission), and tell Brittany that Santa will be unable to make Artie walk again.  Although it's unrealistic for Santa, it's the only possibility.  Beiste agrees.\rThat night, Sue and Becky fulfill Will's comment that Sue is a grinch by dressing up as The Grinch and his reindog, Max, and stealing the presents that she believes are rightfully hers from the choir room (while destroying everything Christmas-related...and Glee Club related.  While she does this, \"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\" plays. \n"}, {"text": "What does Brittany bring as a gift for the homeless kids?", "correct": "A dollhouse", "options": ["A golf club", "A blender", "Handmade scarves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA dollhouse.\n\n\tWhile Sue destroys the choir room and steals the presents, Brittany (a la Cindy Lou Who) appears to drop off a gift she brought for the homeless youths (a dollhouse, so their dolls won't be homeless).  When she comments on the tree, Sue claims (as Santa) that she'll fix the broken tree and bring it back.\rThe next day, the kids and Will find that everything is ruined.  Will immediately recognizes this as Sue's doing, but Brittany affirms that it was definitely Santa.  Finn says that despite everything being missing, it could be much worse.  His determination to have a good Christmas allows everyone to put the issue behind them and clean up.  Rachel suggests to Finn that as leaders they need to save Christmas. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Rachel and Finn sing \"Last Christmas\"?", "correct": "At a Christmas tree lot", "options": ["In the auditorium", "In the choir room", "They don't"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt a Christmas tree lot.\n\n\tHeading to buy a Christmas tree, Rachel tries to win over Finn once more but he feels too awkward to let her get close again.  While they both look in different parts of the tree yard, they sing Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\".  When they finish singing, Rachel tries to kiss Finn and suggest that it's time to forgive her, but Finn can't do it.  After two of his girlfriends cheated on him with Puck, he's just stuck, confused, and emotionally broken.  He officially breaks up with her.\rThe next day, in the choir room, the kids decide to follow the concept of \"Gift of the Magi\" and donate items they find valuable that they can part with.  The guys give their watches (some of which are very sentimental) while the girls decide to give their hair.  Will stops them.  Rather than sell off that which is valuable to them, they're going to set out to do what they originally wanted to: sing for people who want to hear them sing. \n"}, {"text": "Who ends up contributing money during the club's caroling session?", "correct": "The McKinley High staff", "options": ["Dalton Academy", "Their parents", "Sandy Ryerson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe McKinley High staff.\n\n\tThat night, Brittany, after tucking in her dolls, goes downstairs to find Beiste (dressed as Santa) placing presents under the tree.  Beiste claims that she's doing a test run and Brittany believes that she actually is Santa.  'Santa' explains to Brittany that he's trying his best, but unfortunately, sometimes magic can only go so far.  Brittany is very disappointed by this and makes the decision to clear out her locker of all Christmas decorations.  She's lost the Christmas spirit.  When Artie talks to her, she says that if Santa isn't magic, she doesn't want to believe in Christmas magic anymore.  Will, passing by in the hall, asks the two of them to come along but Artie says that he'd like to take Brittany home and make her feel a bit better first.\rIn the teacher's lounge, the kids gather to sing for their educators.  Their song selection, \"Welcome Christmas\" (from \"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas\"), urges Sue and Becky to emerge from the pile of presents in Sue's office and investigate.  Sue arrives to find the staff donating their money to the homeless youth home.  Despite the petty theft, Sue's heart is warmed by the kids' Christmas spirit. \n"}, {"text": "What Christmas gift does Sue buy for Will?", "correct": "An electric razor", "options": ["A track suit", "A piano", "Hair gel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn electric razor.\n\n\tReturning to the choir room after their caroling session, the kids are stunned to find Artie and Brittany already waiting. Artie is using a gift found under Brittany's tree, a ReWalk, a prototypical device that allows handicapped people to walk.  When they ask who bought it, Artie and Brittany have no other explanation other than 'Santa'.  While the kids revel in a Christmas miracle, Coach Beiste watches from the other room, smiling.\rWill heads home that night to celebrate the Christmas holidays alone.  When he arrives, the fire is already burning.  He finds Sue nonchalantly walking around the apartment.  She apologizes for stealing the presents and reveals that she brought them over.  She calls it a Christmas miracle and gives him a gift she bought specifically for him: an electric razor to shave his hair.  She also reveals that she brought the Glee kids to the apartment to celebrate Christmas Eve with them.  Will and Sue wish each other a Merry Christmas while the kids decorate the tree. \n"}]}
