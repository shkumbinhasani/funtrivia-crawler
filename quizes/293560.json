He broke Babe Ruth's career record of 714 home runs.  Hank won only one MVP in his career, although winning four season home run titles.  He played for 21 seasons with the Braves, then was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for his final two.  The Hall of Fame inducted him in 1982. \n Where's the error?", "correct": "Aaron broke the record in 1974", "options": ["Hank won 8 MVPs in his career", "Aaron broke the home run record of Stan Musial", "Hank played his final two seasons as a Yankee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAaron broke the record in 1974.\n\n\tAaron played his career from 1954-1976, with his final two as a Brewer.  There he hit his final 22 home runs of his 755 total in his career.  His MVP came in the 1957 season, over Stan Musial and Red Schoendienst.  In 1957, he helped the Braves win their first World Series crown since 1914 with a four games to three win over the Yankees. \n"}, {"text": "In 2004, the Boston Red Sox finally won a World Series.  It had been 19 seasons since the Red Sox won a World Series crown.  Manny Ramirez was the series MVP, and they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals four games to none.  Where's the error?", "correct": "It had been 86 seasons since the Red Sox had won a World Series", "options": ["The Red Sox played the Yankees in the 2004 World Series", "The Red Sox defeated the Cardinals five games to three", "Ted Williams was the series MVP"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt had been 86 seasons since the Red Sox had won a World Series.\n\n\tPrior to the this World Series, the Red Sox had huge a dry-spell and had waited since their last World Series crown in 1918.  The Yankees were also in the American League so a World Series against them was not possible, and Ted Williams retired decades earlier.  Manny Ramirez batted .412 in the series to win the MVP.  On July 31, 2008, Manny was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. \n"}, {"text": "Joe Torre had a great career, both as a player and manager.  He played with the Braves, Cardinals, and Mets, and won the NL MVP in 1971. He was mostly a catcher.  As a manager, he managed the Mets, Braves, Cardinals, and Yankees.  As a Yankee manager, he took the team to 10 division championships in 12 seasons, and helmed the Yankees to six World Series appearances.  This apparently was not good enough for the head office of the Yankees, and they let him go after the 2007 season.  He became the manager of the Cincinnati Reds in 2008.\n Where's the error?", "correct": "Torre managed the Dodgers in 2008", "options": ["Joe won the NL MVP in 2001", "Torre never managed the Yankees", "Joe was a pitcher as a player"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTorre managed the Dodgers in 2008.\n\n\tHe won the NL MVP in 1971 as a member of the Cardinals.  Joe retired as a player in 1977 when he was player-manager of the Mets.  He continued with the Mets as a manager until 1981, then found himself at the helm of the Braves in 1982.  In 1990, he was managing the Cardinals, and went to the Yankees in 1996.  Torre replaced Grady Little at the helm of the Dodgers in 2008. \n"}, {"text": "The Major Leagues began in 1911 with the National League and the new American League combining as one.  The first World Series was won by the Cleveland Indians against the St. Louis Perfectos, four games to none.  The MVP of the series was Indian pitcher Bob Feller, who struck out 22 St. Louis Perfecto batters in the series.\n Where's the error?", "correct": "All this information is incorrect", "options": ["The first World Series was won by the Pittsburgh Pirates", "Feller was a first baseman and hit two grand slams in the series", "The Perfectos won the series against the Baltimore Orioles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll this information is incorrect.\n\n\tThe American League combined with the National League to become the Major Leagues in the 1901 season.  The first World Series against the National and American League took place in 1903, with the Boston Americans against the Pittsburgh Pirates.  The Americans won the first World Series five games to three.  Bob Feller wasn't born until 1918.  The St. Louis Perfectos existed only in the 1899 season. \n"}, {"text": "The New York Yankees ran an amazing streak from 1936-1939, winning four consecutive World Series.  This was in part due to the greatness of Bill Dickey, Lou Gehrig, and Joe DiMaggio.  If that weren't enough, the franchise did another amazing run by winning five consecutive World Series from 1966-1970.  A lot of the Yankees rostered were inducted into the Hall of Fame.  The team that won five consecutive World Series was managed by the great Casey Stengel.\n Where's the error?", "correct": "Their five consecutive World Series victories were from 1949-1953", "options": ["The Yankee franchise never won even four consecutive World Series", "Their manager was Leo Durocher", "DiMaggio was not a Yankee until the 1969 season"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir five consecutive World Series victories were from 1949-1953.\n\n\tFrom 1936-1943, manager Joe McCarthy took the Yankees to seven World Series, winning all but one.  Who or what team would out-do this?  The Yankees did, and from 1949-1953 under the helm of Casey Stengel, would win all five World Series.  If that weren't enough, after finishing second to the Cleveland Indians in 1954, Casey and the Yankees would run off another four World Series appearances in the next four seasons, beginning in 1955. \n"}, {"text": "The great Nolan Ryan pitched for four teams in his career.  They were the Mets, Angels, Astros, and Rangers throughout his 27 seasons.  He led the league 11 times in a season with the most strikeouts.  This led to his two MVPs and one Cy Young award.  He retired with 5714 strikeouts.  He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1999.\n Where's the error?", "correct": "Ryan never won a MVP or Cy Young award", "options": ["Ryan pitched only for the Angels in his 27 seasons", "Nolan was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1956", "All this information is incorrect"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRyan never won a MVP or Cy Young award.\n\n\tRyan's career spanned from 1966-1993.  The closest that he came to a Cy Young award was finishing second in 1973 to Jim Palmer of the Orioles.  The closest that he ever came to a MVP was 14th place in 1974.  Nolan threw seven no-hitters in his career, and went to only one World Series.  That was with the \"Amazin Mets\" in 1969 with his only series crown over the Orioles. \n"}, {"text": "Like the NFL Tampa Bay team, the Rays began their franchise in pretty dismal fashion.  The Rays began their endeavors in 1998, and in all but one of their first 10 seasons, they finished in last place.  They lost 100+ games three times in that span.  In the season that they did not finish last, they went to the World Series under the management of Lou Piniella.  They lost to the Cardinals.\n Where's the error?", "correct": "The Rays did not go to a World Series in their first 10 seasons", "options": ["Lou Piniella never managed the Rays", "The Rays' franchise began in 1969", "In 10 seasons, the Rays never finished last"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Rays did not go to a World Series in their first 10 seasons.\n\n\tIn their first season in 1998, it was under the management of Larry Rothschild.  The team went 63-99.  Piniella took the team to a next-to-last place finish in 2004, but still 30.5 games back.  2008 seemingly was an unexplained turnaround, as the team had the best record in the Majors at the all-star break. \n"}, {"text": "Miller Huggins was the player-manager for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1913-1916, then retired as a player and just managed the team in 1917.  He took over the helm of the New York Yankees in 1918 until 1929.  Everything was fine with him and the team until Babe Ruth joined the Yankees in 1928.  After that, nothing was normal.  Miller died before the end of the 1929 season.  Huggins took the Yankees to six World Series, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1964.\n Where's the error?", "correct": "Ruth joined the Yankees in the 1920 season", "options": ["Huggins took the Yankees to only one World Series", "Huggins was the player-manager of the Yankees from 1907-1926", "Huggins was never inducted into the Hall of Fame"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRuth joined the Yankees in the 1920 season.\n\n\tThe Babe began his career with the Red Sox in 1914.  Due to some financial failures, the Red Sox owner Howard Frazee sold Ruth's contract to the Yankees.  After hitting a record 29 home runs for Boston in 1919, the Babe hit another 54 with the Yankees in 1920.  With much frustration and aggravation between Huggins and Ruth, it seemed too much stress for Huggins as he became ill and could not fight it off.  Ruth hit 50+ home runs in a season four times in his career, and retired as a Boston Brave of the National League in 1935. \n"}, {"text": "Slugger Barry Bonds won seven NL MVP awards in his career, although winning only two home run titles.  He began his career with the Cardinals in 1986, then signed as a free-agent with the Giants in 1992.  In 2001, he set a single season home run record by hitting 73, which broke the record of Mark McGwire.  It was the only time that Bonds hit 50+ in a season.\nWhere's the error?", "correct": "Bonds was a Pirate before becoming a Giant", "options": ["Barry broke the season record of Babe Ruth in 2001", "Bonds hit 50+ home runs in a season, six times", "Barry won eight home run titles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonds was a Pirate before becoming a Giant.\n\n\tBarry began his career as a Pittsburgh Pirate.

Barry ended his career amongst steroid controversies. \n"}, {"text": "2007 was very balanced as no team won 100 games in the season.  Every team won at least 65 games also.  Josh Beckett, Tim Wakefield, and Brandon Webb were the only 20-game winners.  Only two players batted over .350 in the season.  In the postseason it was the Red Sox against the Rockies, with Boston skunking Colorado four games to none.\n Where's the error?", "correct": "Beckett was the only 20-game winner", "options": ["Boston lost the World Series", "Boston played the Cardinals in the World Series", "The Diamondbacks, Indians, and Red Sox all won over 100 games in the season"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeckett was the only 20-game winner.\n\n\tWakefield went 17-12 and had never been a 20-game winner, and Webb went 18-10 in the season.

Magglio Ordonez of the Tigers and Ichiro Suzuki of the Mariners were the only batters to hit .350 in the season. \n"}]}
