He fit perfectly in a time traveling game in \"Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped\".  He appeared in several of the games afterwards, including \"Crash Twinsanity,\" in which he and Doctor Nitrus Brio fight Crash on an iceberg.  Dr. N-Brio, who \"gets changed\" in \"Crash Twinsanity\" was the original bad guy, second only to Cortex himself, in the original game entitled \"Crash Bandicoot\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of these words best describes N-Gin?", "correct": "Inventor", "options": ["Tall", "Stupid", "Protagonist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInventor.\n\n\tN-Gin is neither a good guy, a stupid guy, or a tall guy, therefore, inventor fits him best.  He once worked in a factory, and something went haywire, which caused a missile to stick in his head.  He used it as life support, instead of removing it.  He gets a splitting headache every time he gets mad, though, because the missile is still live. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is an alien that claims to be the fastest racer in the galaxy who is the main antagonist in \"Crash Team Racing\"?", "correct": "Nitros Oxide", "options": ["Uka Uka", "Rilla Roo", "Tiny Tiger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNitros Oxide.\n\n\tNitros Oxide claims to be the best, although he isn't really.  He is a bad guy in \"Crash Team Racing\".  He tries to make Earth a giant concrete parking lot in \"Crash Team Racing\", but, of course, fails.

Relics are collected when you complete the level in a certain amount of time.  Colored gems are collected when you complete a certain task in a level, and clear gems are collected if every box was destroyed in a level. \n"}, {"text": "What color is Crash Bandicoot's fur?", "correct": "Orange", "options": ["Red", "White", "Pink"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrange.\n\n\tCrash Bandicoot is an orange bandicoot created by Doctor Neo Cortex.  However, Cortex begins to hate Crash, which is why he is out to destroy him.  Crash's sister is Coco, and his guardian is Aku Aku.  Crunch was introduced as a bad guy, but became a good guy, and brother to Crash Bandicoot, later on.  He is a very macho and tough guy when he is a bad guy, but when he turned good, he became a bit more feminine. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not an animal Crash or Coco Bandicoot rides in any game?", "correct": "Dragon", "options": ["Bat", "Polar Bear", "Tiger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDragon.\n\n\tWhile Crash may be friends with a dragon (that is Spyro), he never rides one.

He is a good guy, not evil!  He cannot speak much, and only says three or four words throughout the games, so he is not talkative.  He is not very smart.  He tends to not pay attention a lot, so he is, therefore, inattentive. \n"}, {"text": "What animal does Tiny the Tiger use in \"Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped\" to try to defeat Crash and steal back the crystals?", "correct": "Lions", "options": ["Oh My!  All of the above", "Tigers", "Bears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLions.\n\n\tAlthough Tiny is a tiger, he uses lions to defeat Crash.  He fights Crash in the Colosseum, so it fits that he would use tigers.  He appears in a boatload of other Crash games as well, either as a playable character, an antagonist, or simply a road block. \n"}, {"text": "What are Rok-Ko, Wa-Wa, Py-Ro, and Lo-Lo?", "correct": "Elementals", "options": ["Henchmen of Cortex", "Pharaohs", "Bandicoots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElementals.\n\n\tThe Elementals are a group of four evil masks that Uka Uka unearthed to get rid of Crash Bandicoot.  Uka Uka was tired of Cortex failing in the destruction of Crash, so he took it upon himself to get rid of him using these masks.  They are found in \"Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex.\"  Crunch is created in this game, and the Elementals pair up with Crunch for each boss level to make Crunch more powerful.  For instance, for the earth elemental, Rok-Ko, he becomes a giant ball, and you must attack him as a ball as well. \n"}, {"text": "What main antagonist of many Crash games appears in the DS and Gameboy Advance version of \"Crash of the Titans,\" but not the Wii or PS2 version?", "correct": "Dingodile", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDingodile.\n\n\tDingodile is a cross between a dingo and a crocodile.  He is Australian in nature.  He first appears in \"Crash Bandicoot: Warped\" as a bad guy.  He appears in several other games, either as a boss, a playable character, or just as a side character throughout the story.  For instance, in \"Crash Twinsanity\", Dingodile is invited to a \"birthday party\" thrown by Neo Cortex, although it is just a trick to kill Crash. He then talks to Ripper Roo about getting some lunch, and then is later seen in a cabin reading a newspaper.  When a snowball falls on him, containing Crash and Cortex, he overhears that there is a treasure, and he goes and looks for it.  He then becomes a bad guy later in that game. \n"}]}
