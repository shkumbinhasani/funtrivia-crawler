The AHL has been used as both a prospect breeding ground, and a test session for the NHL to try out new rules and regulations. The AHL runs an 80-game schedule followed by a four-round playoff system that ends with the victors hoisting the Calder Cup, named after the NHL's first president Frank Calder. \n"}, {"text": "Two levels below the NHL lies this league, with teams like the Wheeling Nailers, South Carolina Stingrays, and the Florida Everblades.
