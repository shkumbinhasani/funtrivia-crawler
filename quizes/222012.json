What made this perfect different was that the Cubs' pitcher threw a one-hitter in the game also.  Which Dodger pitcher threw this perfecto?", "correct": "Sandy Koufax", "options": ["Bob Gibson", "Jim Kaat", "Steve Carlton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSandy Koufax.\n\n\tThe others never played for the Dodgers.  Koufax was in his third of four tremendous seasons in which he won three Cy Young awards, three Triple Crowns, and an MVP.  This game saw both Koufax and Cubs' pitcher Bob Hendley go into the seventh inning with perfect games going on both sides.  Hendley gave up a double to the Dodgers' Lou Johnson, while Koufax continued in stride.  Sandy struck out 14 in the 1-0 victory.  Frank Chance, Frankie Frisch, and Waite Hoyt were also born on September 9th. \n"}, {"text": "September 21, 1934: In this twin bill, these two Cardinal brothers doused the Brooklyn Dodgers.  In the first game, one threw a three-hitter in the win.  In the nightcap, his brother threw a no-hitter against them.  Who were these famous 'goofy' brothers?", "correct": "Dean", "options": ["Perry", "Martinez", "Niekro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDean.\n\n\tThe other pitching brothers had not started their careers yet.  Dizzy, the Hall of Famer, threw the first game but brother Paul (Daffy) had to top him.  The Dean's threw together on the Cardinals from 1934-1937.  The Cardinals went all the way to the World Series and won against the Tigers in 1934.  Dizzy and Daffy had a combined record of 49-18 in the season. \n"}, {"text": "September 27, 1930:  This Cub hit two home runs in the final game of the season to set a National League record of 56 season home runs.  Who was this slugger?", "correct": "Hack Wilson", "options": ["Joe DiMaggio", "Mickey Mantle", "Reggie Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHack Wilson.\n\n\tThe others were all American Leaguers but still had not begun their careers yet in 1930.  Wilson played for 12 seasons mostly with Chicago.  His 56 home runs, 208 hits, and .356 batting average was more than worthy of the MVP, but no MVP was awarded in 1930.  His hall induction was in 1979. \n"}, {"text": "September 29, 1988:  This Dodger pitcher threw 10 shutout innings before giving in via a relief pitcher.  These 10 innings broke the Major League record of Dodger Don Drysdale's 58 scoreless innings.  Who was this new era Dodger pitcher?", "correct": "Orel Hershiser", "options": ["Dick Nen", "Gene Larkin", "Greg Gagne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrel Hershiser.\n\n\tThe others listed were not pitchers.  The 18-season pitcher nicknamed 'Bulldog', went 23-8 in the season, earning him the NL Cy Young award.  It was the only season that Hershiser won 20+ games.  He helped take this 1988 team to a World Series crown against the Athletics.  Orel retired in 2000, hopefully awaiting a Hall of Fame induction. \n"}, {"text": "September 27, 1928:  For the second time in the season, this Hall of Fame pitcher struck out the side on nine pitches.  Who was this left-handed Philadelphia Athletic?", "correct": "Lefty Grove", "options": ["Don Drysdale", "Nolan Ryan", "Jim Palmer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLefty Grove.\n\n\tThe other pitchers were right-handed and did not play in 1928.  One of many amazing seasons for Grove in 1928, he went 24-8 in the season, and it was the second of seven consecutive seasons that he would win 20+ games.  In 1930, Grove would win the Triple Crown, but like the Cubs' Hack Wilson who had a stellar season in the National League, would not receive a MVP award because none was awarded.  Not to be deterred, Grove would win another Triple Crown in 1931, and also receive the MVP award finally.  After retiring in 1941, Robert Moses Grove was inducted into the hall in 1947. \n"}, {"text": "September 28, 1941/1960.  This player closed out the 1941 season by going 6-for-8 in the game and finishing with a .406 average.

Who was this Hall of Famer?", "correct": "Ted Williams", "options": ["Willie Mays", "Mickey Mantle", "Bob Turley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTed Williams.\n\n\tThe others would not begin their Major League careers until 1951, and none ever hit .400 in a season.  Over 19 seasons, the career Boston Red Sox Williams had a batting average of .344 and hit 521 home runs.  Oddly enough unlike 1941, Williams won the Triple Crown in 1942 and 1947, then two MVPs in 1946 and 1949.  In 17 of his 19 seasons he was voted an all-star, and those two in which he was not, he was providing military service.  He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1966.  He died in 2002. \n"}, {"text": "September 17, 1984, saw this California Angel hit his 500th career home run off Kansas City Royal, Bud Black.
