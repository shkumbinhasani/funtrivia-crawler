The high temperature is believed to be the result of a 'greenhouse effect' caused by the layered structure of the planet's clouds and the large proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. \n"}, {"text": "The Finnish stargazers used to call the shooting stars and the comets that they saw \"fire foxes.\"", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe Scots used to call it 'merry dancers', what they were seeing was actually the aurora borealis, or northern lights. \n"}, {"text": "Which planet's moons are named for characters created by William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope?", "correct": "Uranus", "options": ["Venus", "Saturn", "Pluto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUranus.\n\n\tFifteen have been known about for some time.

Some exoplanets have been observed directly -- when an exoplanet passes between us and their sun, we can see the silhouette of the exoplanet backlit by their sun. In other words, it is a planet that has not been observed directly, but has been detected by analysis of light from the star it orbits. \n"}, {"text": "To an astronaut, 'light the candle' means starting up the shuttle right before they take off.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tReally it means to blast off into space. \n"}]}
