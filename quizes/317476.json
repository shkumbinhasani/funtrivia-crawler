{"id": "317476", "name": "An Introduction to Omaha Poker Trivia Quiz | Entertainment | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "     Casinos & Gambling ", "Poker"], "questions": [{"text": "In Omaha, each player is dealt four cards. The dealer then turns over the flop, the turn, and the river, very similarly to Texas Hold'em. The player must then form his best five-card hand how?", "correct": "The best combination of exactly two cards from his/her hand and three from the board", "options": ["The best combination of exactly no more than three cards from either his/her hand or the board.", "The best combination of exactly three cards from his/her hand and two from the board", "The best five out of nine cards."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe best combination of exactly two cards from his/her hand and three from the board.\n\n\tNewcomers to this game find this rule to be very annoying. The very first Omaha hand I played, I was dealt three Aces and a King. It took me four pots to realize that you can only use exactly two cards from your hand and three from the board. In Hold'em you can \"play the board\" sometimes if your hand is weak, or use the Ace of clubs alone to make a club flush. This slight difference in game play alters pots considerably. \n"}, {"text": "Omaha Hold'em is often referred to as a \"game of the nuts\". What does this mean? ", "correct": "If quite a few people are playing, you must have the best hand possible or \"the nuts\" in order to be comfortable about winning.", "options": ["The hands can get so long and boring that players usually buy a lot of nuts to eat.", "The pots get so huge that plays may not have enough chips. Instead, they use special types of \"nuts\" as high stakes chips.", "Neither of these answers are correct."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIf quite a few people are playing, you must have the best hand possible or \"the nuts\" in order to be comfortable about winning.\n\n\tIn poker slang, \"the nuts\" is the best possible hand in any given situation. For example, if the board shows Ah Kh 2h, the \"nuts\" would be any the Qh and any other heart. Because there are so many cards in play in Omaha when the table is full, it's safe to assume that the winning player has a considerably powerful hand. Sometimes, folding a full house can be a great move. This is why Texas Hold'em players have a hard time adjusting to Omaha, as very powerful hands are rare in Hold'em. \n"}, {"text": "A popular variation of Omaha Poker is played in Casinos, and is well known for it's gigantic pots. What is it known as?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Omaha Eight", "Omaha Hi/Lo", "Omaha Eight  or Better"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tOmaha Eight or better, also known by the other two names, is a popular variation of the game where the pot is split in half. The player with the best \"high\" hand, or regular five-card poker hand, takes half of the pot. A \"low\" hand is a any hand with five distinct cards that are 8 or lower, thus the name \"Eight or better\". The player with the lowest qualifying five cards \"Eight or better\" takes the other half of the pot.Sometimes, pots are \"quartered\" if half the pot is split in half. Sometimes, there are no qualifying \"low\" hands, because the nature of Omaha demands that two cards only be used from the player's hand and three from the board.In these cases, the best \"hi\" hand takes the whole pot. Because a vast majority of hands are relatively playable pre-flop in Omaha Hi/Lo, the pots tend to get huge, which attracts manic gamblers. However, mastering the game will show that not all pots can be played. Despite its complicated nature, Omaha Eight is, in my opinion, the most exciting flop poker variant. \n"}, {"text": "Some poker slang terms refer to both Texas Hold'em and Omaha. Which of these refers exclusively to Omaha? ", "correct": "Double suited", "options": ["Big Blind", "River", "Button"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDouble suited.\n\n\tThe \"river\" is a nickname given to the last community card dealt on the board, and because both Texas Hold'em and Omaha are flop games, the \"river\" is a term used in both games. The \"big blind\" is posted by a player before the cards are dealt, as a \"blind bet\" in order to get money in the pot and incite other players to play their cards.The \"button\" is a chip-like white disk, used to determine who the last player to act is in each pot. The player on the \"button\" is usually the most powerful on the table as he/she gets to see what everyone else does before they have to act. \"Double suited\", however, refers to two suited pairs of hole cards, and as there are only two hole cards in Texas Hold'em, this is a term that only refers to the four-card Omaha game.\n"}, {"text": "Although Omaha Hold'em is played on all limits, it is most commonly played as \"Pot Limit\". What does this mean?", "correct": "The largest bet a player may make is the size of the pot.", "options": ["The smallest bet a player may make is the size of the pot.", "The smallest bet a player may make is half the size of the pot.", "The largest bet a player may make is half the size of the pot."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe largest bet a player may make is the size of the pot.\n\n\tOmaha is played Pot Limit, and abbreviated PLO on online poker software, due to its aggressive nature. Limit poker seems too dull for the card sharks that enjoy Omaha for its craziness and the gambling factor, and No-Limit poker seems too dangerous for such a lottery-type game, especially on the big full tables. As a result, Pot Limit, the perfect blend between the two, is the most common betting structure used. \n"}, {"text": "In the World Series of Poker (WSOP), there are no Omaha events. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAbsolutely false! Although Omaha is not nearly as popular as Texas Hold'em is it still one of the most well-known poker games. The WSOP features many types of Omaha games, including regular PLO, Omaha/Eight, Omaha/Seven Card Stud, and Hold'em/Omaha. The game also has several roles in the mixed games, such as H.O.R.S.E and H.O.S.E. \n"}, {"text": "In Omaha, if your hand is Jh, Js, Jc, and Ac, and the board reads Jd 3h 3s 4h 9s what is your final hand at showdown?", "correct": "A full house, jacks full of threes", "options": ["Three of a kind, jacks", "Four of a kind, jacks", "A full house, jacks full of aces"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA full house, jacks full of threes.\n\n\tBecause you can only use two cards from your hand and three from the board, the third Jack in your hand is, unfortunately, completely irrelevant and it cannot be used to give you four of a kind. As a result, you have flopped a full house, jacks full of threes. Although this is not as great as four Jacks, it is still a very powerful hand in this situation, beaten only by four threes. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following professional poker players has won two WSOP bracelets in Omaha events as of 2009?", "correct": "Sam Farha", "options": ["Tom Dwan", "Peter Eastgate", "Phil Hellmuth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam Farha.\n\n\tSam Farha is perhaps best known for playing on \"High Stakes Poker\" a popular cash game show that airs on GSN. He is an eccentric poker player, which is perfect for his Omaha career. To date, his only two WSOP bracelets have come in Omaha events. Phil Hellmuth has won all 11 bracelets to date in Texas Hold'em Events. Peter Eastgate was the 2008 WSOP Main Event Champion, at the age of 22, making him the youngest Main Event winner to date. Tom Dwan is also a young player primarily known for playing high-stakes cash games, both Omaha and Texas Hold'em, online and in casinos. \n"}, {"text": "Who is often credited to have introduced the game of Omaha into Las Vegas casinos?

This is referred to as the \"nut low\". What other name is it known as?", "correct": "The Wheel", "options": ["The Saucer", "The Pin", "Broadway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wheel.\n\n\tA Wheel is the best possible low hand in Omaha Hi/Lo or Omaha Eight. Because a straight, ace to five, incorporates the lowest five cards in the deck. A player is guaranteed a portion of the pot if he/she has this game while playing Omaha 8 or better. However, if there are many others in the pot, the player runs the risk of being quartered, or making less money than expected, due to the fact that many others may have wheels. \n"}]}
