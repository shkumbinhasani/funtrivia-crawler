{"id": "319560", "name": "\"Dollhouse\": \"Belle Chose\" Quiz | Dollhouse | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Dollhouse"], "questions": [{"text": "The episode begins with attention to detail: a man making fine adjustments to the way that some preppy clothing fits the mannequins. But wait -- now that the camera's moved closer, we can see these aren't mannequins but real women, uncannily still and poseable. What lawn game are they all equipped to play?", "correct": "Croquet", "options": ["Bocce", "Miniature golf", "Horseshoes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCroquet.\n\n\t\"Goodness gracious, but it is good to be outdoors,\" the man (played by Joe Sikora) declares, though we can see that the croquet game is set up on a narrow strip of artificial turf, in a large, industrial room lit by a skylight. He's talking to the four women posed as mannequins, calling them names like \"Aunt Sheila\" and \"Little Sister,\" and pretending that they're holding up their end of the conversation. \"Aunt Sheila\" tries to crawl away, and he jabs a syringe into her leg -- a heavy tranquilizer, no doubt. When she fights back, he kills her with a croquet mallet as the others look on.\r \"I guess we'll have to find a new Aunt Sheila,\" he says. \n"}, {"text": "The disturbed young man is in the real outdoors now, hoping to kidnap a young woman to complete his set. He spots a likely one and heads toward her. What happens next, just before the credits roll?", "correct": "He is hit by a car.", "options": ["He falls down an open manhole.", "The woman turns. She's Echo, and she hits him.", "He is struck by lightning."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is hit by a car.\n\n\tAnd it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy! (Well, yes, so maybe it could have.) The woman, whom we haven't seen before on this show, never realizes how close she came to evil, and we can all hope that this is curtains for her would-be kidnapper. Except -- what about the women trapped in the warehouse? \n"}, {"text": "After the credits, we find ourselves in the Dollhouse, where our disturbed young man -- who, we now know, is named Terry Karrens -- is hooked up to an impressive number of tubes and wires. Why is the Dollhouse interested in his fate?", "correct": "His uncle is a client and shareholder.", "options": ["He has kidnapped a Doll.", "He is Adelle's brother.", "He is a former Doll."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis uncle is a client and shareholder.\n\n\t\"Bradley Karrens is not only a valued client,\" Adelle tells Boyd, \"he happens to be a major shareholder in our parent organization. If we can apply our resources to resolving his nephew's slight medical condition, we do it.\" Boyd observes that young Terry is a troublemaker who skipped a bail hearing (after which his loving family bought off the judge), but they don't realize the extent of his crimes just yet. \n"}, {"text": "Meanwhile, Echo has picked up her latest personality imprint: Kiki, a bubbly, ditzy student who \"just feel[s] like dancin'.\" What role is Echo/Kiki supposed to play?", "correct": "A college professor's romantic fantasy", "options": ["A ringer on a Frisbee team", "A ballroom dance partner for a fraternity boy", "A tutor for a high-school girl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA college professor's romantic fantasy.\n\n\tIvy explains the engagement to Ballard: the client is one Professor Gossen (Arye Gross), and the encounter is coded R, for romance. Ballard is not thrilled, either with the nature of the engagement or with Kiki's company. He perseveres, however, and their first stop is the Dollhouse's wardrobe establishment, where she gets a new outfit and a new hairdo. Sitting with another handler, waiting for their Dolls to finish, Ballard radiates boredom.\r \"I won't even do this for my wife,\" the other handler says.\r \"I was trained at Quantico,\" Ballard sighs. \n"}, {"text": "Back upstairs, the Dollhouse staff are faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, they want to wake Terry in time to find out where his surviving victims are. On the other hand, he's a psychopath whose connections have let him get away with terrible crimes; a coma may be the best justice available. What do they decide to do?", "correct": "They imprint a Doll with Terry's personality.", "options": ["They try to trace Terry's moves to find his hideout.", "They wake Terry.", "They load Terry's personality onto a computer."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey imprint a Doll with Terry's personality.\n\n\tTopher is the one who realizes that something is deeply wrong with Terry, after scanning his brain and finding its empathy centers completely inactive. \"I have serious ethical problems trying to wake him up,\" he tells Adelle. Boyd is incredulous: \"Topher has ethical problems. Topher!\"\r Meanwhile, Terry's uncle (Michael Hogan, who bears a striking resemblance to U.S. politician John McCain) is anxious to wake his nephew. As he oh-so-delicately puts it, you can bribe survivors to stay quiet, but you can't bribe bodies. That's his interest in saving these women.\r Adelle's compromise is to leave the real Terry in a coma, but to give a Doll his personality so he can be interrogated. Victor draws the short straw and gets to be psychopath-for-a-day. \n"}, {"text": "After no small amount of effort, the Dollhouse staff are ready to dig deep into Terry's psyche. Whom do they ask to scope him out?", "correct": "Ballard, a former FBI man", "options": ["Boyd, a former cop", "Claire, a doctor Doll", "Topher, a personality craftsman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBallard, a former FBI man.\n\n\tBallard, as Echo/Kiki's handler, has been watching his charge prepare for her engagement -- and has perhaps become a little too intrigued by this extremely flirty process. Boyd interrupts him, saying that he'll cover any handler duties while Ballard uses his FBI profiling skills on the suspected serial killer in Victor's body. Ballard seems relieved by the change in plan. \n"}, {"text": "To no one's surprise, Terry turns out to be acting out some old family issues with the women he's kidnapped -- and then, to everyone's surprise, some new family issues rear their ugly heads as a relative of Terry's interferes in the Dollhouse investigation. What happens?", "correct": "His uncle helps him escape.", "options": ["Adelle turns him into a Doll.", "Topher tries to kill him.", "Boyd tells the police where he is."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis uncle helps him escape.\n\n\tWhile visiting his comatose nephew in the Dollhouse clinic, Bradley Karrens \"tamper[s] with the main lead\" to his medical monitors. The resulting disturbance allows him to flee the Dollhouse with Victor, the healthy Doll who's imprinted with his nephew's personality. It's unclear how Uncle Bradley is planning to explain this body swap to the rest of the family, but he does seem to hope that he can persuade Terry to divulge his victims' whereabouts. Of course, Victor/Terry has other ideas, and soon turns the tables on his uncle ... \n"}, {"text": "The Dollhouse's carefully laid plans have gone awry, and Terry's psychopathic personality is loose on the streets. Topher hits on a plan to save the city by remotely wiping his personality blank -- but this goes wrong, too. What happens?", "correct": "Echo's and Victor's personalities are swapped.", "options": ["Sierra's and Whiskey's personalities are swapped.", "Topher's personality is wiped.", "Adelle is killed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEcho's and Victor's personalities are swapped.\n\n\tPlan A is to use Victor/Terry's GPS strip to track him down -- but it turns out that the strip was never re-implanted after Victor's facial reconstruction surgeries. Plan B is to take a page from Alpha's Season 1 book by wiping his personality remotely -- but Victor/Terry isn't carrying a cell phone. So Topher decides to wipe him by tapping into the link for his vital signs -- and, in the process, the whole system goes down and Kiki's and Terry's personae are swapped.\r Victor/Kiki finds herself in a club, and breaks out some hilarious dance moves. Echo/Terry is in an office with a sketchy professor, whom he promptly stabs in the neck. Time for the final act! \n"}, {"text": "\"Terry\" is still at large, and he soon returns to the building where he's imprisoned his victims. What are they doing when he comes back?", "correct": "Trying to escape", "options": ["Making weapons", "Forming a prayer circle", "Talking to the police"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrying to escape.\n\n\tTerry's three surviving victims -- the women he calls Mother, Big Sister, and Little Sister -- have been trying to escape their cage for much of the episode, ever since the paralyzing agent wore off. Echo/Terry comes back just as they've all made it to the other side of the fence, and dashes their hopes of rescue by hitting \"Little Sister\" in the head with a croquet mallet.As he prepares to strike down the other two, however, he pauses: Echo's own evolving personality is trying to take over. She drops her mallet and urges the survivors to kill him -- by killing her. And just as she's talked them into it, the S.W.A.T. team arrives. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the episode, the Dollhouse staff still have a problem: the real body of Terry, the serial killer, lies comatose in their clinic and is soon to be transferred to a hospital.

He asks what will happen if Terry ever wakes up; Adelle muses, \"Wouldn't it be nice if he didn't?\"\r Just afterward, Echo wanders into the room. \"I think he dreams,\" she tells Ballard, nodding toward the body.\r \"Not anymore,\" he says. \n"}]}
