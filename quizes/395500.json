Jesus catches him and says, \"You of little faith, why did you doubt?\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Mary, did you know that your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?\" \n\nWhere does Jesus say, \"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.\"? (NIV)", "correct": "John 3:17", "options": ["Matthew 3:17", "Luke 3:17", "Mark 3:17"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn 3:17.\n\n\tJohn 3:16, the verse before it in the NIV, states, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\"\r All this was spoken as a result of Nicodemus asking Jesus, \"How can someone be born when they are old?\" (John 3:4) after Jesus told him to enter the Kingdom of Heaven a person must be born again. Nicodemus was a Pharisee. Many of the Pharisees practiced the Jewish law more meticulously and studied it more closely than anyone else, but they did not necessarily understand it for all that. \n"}, {"text": "\"Did you know / That your baby boy has come to make you new? / This child that you've delivered / Will soon deliver you?\" \n\nHow did Jesus deliver Mary?", "correct": "Died on the cross and rose again on the third day, conquering death", "options": ["Paid 30 shekels for her", "Gave doves and pigeons for her in the temple", "Traded some lambs and bulls for her"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDied on the cross and rose again on the third day, conquering death.\n\n\t1 Corinthians 15:3b-4 in the NIV says, \"Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.\"\r According to this and the Gospels, Jesus died to deliver us from our sins. To be delivered from sins, according to the understanding of many Christians, is to have Jesus' blood cover your sins by accepting Him as your Lord and Savior. \n"}, {"text": "\"Mary, did you know / That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?\" \n\nWhere was the blind man who some people brought to Jesus, at which time Jesus spit in the man's eyes and touched them, giving the man his sight?", "correct": "Bethsaida", "options": ["Bethlehem", "Tarsus", "Damascus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBethsaida.\n\n\tBethsaida was a village, possibly located on the Northern part of the Sea of Galilee. According to Mark 8:22-25 NIV the first time Jesus touched the man's eyes the man \"saw trees walking around\".

Then men wondered who Jesus was that even the seas listened to him. \n"}, {"text": "\"Did you know / That your baby boy has walked where angels trod? / When you kiss your little baby / You've kissed the face of God.\n\nMary, did you know / Mary, did you know? / The blind will see / The deaf will hear And the dead will live again.\" \n\nWho was the first dead person Jesus brought back to life?", "correct": "The widow's son from Nain", "options": ["Jairus' daughter", "Lazarus", "Everyone who has ever died that was a believer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe widow's son from Nain.\n\n\tIt says in Luke 7:11-16 that when Jesus was told that the widow's only son had died and was being carried out, \"his heart went out to her and he said, \"Don't cry.\" Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying the son on, and the bearers stood still. He said, \"Young man, I say to you, get up!\" The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.\"\r Lazarus was the brother of Mary and Martha whom Jesus brought back from the dead four days after he had died.\r Jairus' daughter's story can be found in Mark 5:21-53, mixed also with Jesus healing the women who had been bleeding for 12 years.\r Lastly, Jesus raising from the dead all the believers who have ever died has not happened yet. This will happen, according to 1 Thessalonians 4:16 (NIV) in Jesus' second coming. This verse says, \"For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"The lame will leap\" \n\nJesus gave his Apostles the power to perform miracles as well.
