Quiz | Literature | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Shakespeare", "Merchant of Venice"], "questions": [{"text": "Which two men are trying to find out the reason for Antonio's sadness in the first scene of the play?", "correct": "Solanio and Salerio", "options": ["Bassanio and Shylock", "Lorenzo and Tubal", "Solanio and Lancelot Gobbo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSolanio and Salerio.\n\n\tSolanio and Salerio (some editions \"Salanio\" and \"Salerino\") are quite often used by Shakespeare to comment on the events of the play and to inform the audience what is going on. \n"}, {"text": "Which \"part\" in the world does Gratiano say he wants to play?", "correct": "the fool", "options": ["a brave one", "a sad one", "the generous one"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe fool.\n\n\tGratiano offers this idea as a contrast to Antonio's declaration that he is suited to play a sad part in the world. Very early on we are give an indication of Gratiano's outward-going and light-hearted character. It is interesting that Bassanio has such contrasting friends. \n"}, {"text": "Which childhood activity does Bassanio talk about when justifying how he wants to spend more money in pursuit of Portia's wealth?", "correct": "Shooting one arrow after another and following the second more carefully.", "options": ["Learning how to build sandcastles that won't crumble.", "Learning by practice how to keep a top spinning.", "Learning how to make a dog come to heel."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShooting one arrow after another and following the second more carefully.\n\n\tBassanio does not really have to explain to Antonio for his friend will do all he can for him anyway. \n"}, {"text": "To what does Bassanio compare the Golden Fleece found by Jason?", "correct": "Portia's hair", "options": ["the sun's rays on the water of the Grand Canal", "the golden chest of coins he has seen at Belmont", "the carvings on the golden casket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortia's hair.\n\n\tBassanio clearly indicates that there is a lot to admire about Portia as well as her wealth. He compares her also to the Portia who was the wife of Brutus, probably referring to her loyalty, courage and high moral character. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not mentioned amongst the list of suitors who have considered and then rejected trying the choice of the caskets to win Portia in marriage?", "correct": "an Irishman who is devoted to his horses", "options": ["a Scotsman who fights with the Englishman", "the County Palatine who is sad all the time", "an Englishman who understands no foreign languages"], "explanation": "\n\n\nan Irishman who is devoted to his horses.\n\n\tIn fact it is the Neapolitan Prince who is devoted to his horses. Also on the list are a German who is always drunk and a Frenchman who is fond of boasting. Though Shakespeare makes Portia mock the Englishman's lack of languages and his odd clothes, we note that \"he is a proper man's picture.\" \n"}, {"text": "Why won't Shylock accept Bassanio's invitation to dine with him?", "correct": "He suspects he might be given pork which is against his religion", "options": ["He doesn't want to meet Antonio.", "He will be asked to talk business.", "He wants to get home to see his daughter."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe suspects he might be given pork which is against his religion.\n\n\tShylock is a very cautious man who seems to trust nobody. He also believes strongly in his Jewish faith and tries to uphold its principles and practices at all times. \n"}, {"text": "Complete Antonio's saying : \"A goodly ... rotten at the heart\".", "correct": "apple", "options": ["tree", "man", "orange"], "explanation": "\n\n\napple.\n\n\tJust as Shylock does not trust him so Antonio does not trust Shylock. This comparison is a warning to Bassanio. Ironically Antonio is the one who places his trust in Shylock's bond and Bassanio is the one that becomes reluctant when he hears about the pound of flesh. \n"}, {"text": "Which of Portia's suitors asks not to be disliked for his colouring?", "correct": "The Prince of Morocco", "options": ["The Prince of Arragon", "Bassanio", "The Neapolitan Prince"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Prince of Morocco.\n\n\tIt is difficult to evaluate Portia's exact reaction to Morocco other than to be sure that she is glad he has not been successful. She says that he looks as fair as any of her other suitors. However, we remember she has not liked any of her other official suitors. \n"}, {"text": "Old Gobbo has come with a present for Shylock. To whom does Lancelot ask him to give it ?", "correct": "Bassanio", "options": ["Antonio", "Shylock as originally intended", "Gratiano"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBassanio.\n\n\tLancelot wants his father to win favour for him with Bassanio. He now wants to be Bassanio's servant. We learn that Bassanio is indeed using the ducats to set himself and his retainers up in splendid clothing before they go to Belmont. \n"}, {"text": "Which person does Lorenzo use to carry a message to Jessica?", "correct": "Lancelot Gobbo", "options": ["Shylock", "Bassanio", "Old Gobbo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLancelot Gobbo.\n\n\tThis is the beginning of the elopement. Lancelot is the one that is trusted with the message and he does deliver it safely. He may play the fool in some matters but he is wise enough to keep on the right side of Bassanio and his friends. \n"}, {"text": "What does Shylock dream of that makes him suspicious of going out to dinner ?", "correct": "money-bags", "options": ["Lancelot Gobbo", "his daughter Jessica", "Antonio's ships"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmoney-bags.\n\n\tIt was believed to be the sign of a miser to dream of money-bags. Of course on this occasion Shylock is right to be suspicious. What happens whilst he is at the Masque will concern his personal wealth as well as his daughter. \n"}, {"text": "Where exactly is the scroll that Morocco finds when he opens the casket?", "correct": "in the eye-socket of a skull", "options": ["inside another smaller casket", "inside a letter with a golden seal", "wrapped up in a golden cloth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nin the eye-socket of a skull.\n\n\tMorocco at least accepts his fate and departs quickly. He has been deceived by outside appearances. \"All that glisters is not gold.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which inscription convinces Arragon that he should choose the silver casket?", "correct": "Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.", "options": ["Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.", "Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.", "Who chooseth me must be of noble and pure esteem."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWho chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\n\n\tArragon decides that he will assume that he deserves Portia. He rejects gold because he does not want to be ranked with \"many men\". We are not surprised that he fails. Does Shakespeare play with the idea of his \"arrogance\"? \n"}, {"text": "What does Shylock say he will use Antonio's flesh for when he is talking to Solanio and Salerio?", "correct": "to use as bait for fish", "options": ["no use at - he just wants to have it", "to use as a lure in a rat trap", "to feed the dogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nto use as bait for fish.\n\n\tThe extent of Shylock's hatred is shown by the way the idea of money is less important to him than the idea of revenge on Antonio. He can't think of a cold, logical reason why he should want Antonio's flesh. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Shylock get the ring that his daughter exchanged for a monkey?", "correct": "from Leah his wife who is now dead", "options": ["from Antonio", "from his mother", "from his only sister"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfrom Leah his wife who is now dead.\n\n\tShylock's fellow Jew, Tubal, seems to alternate giving him good news and bad news. No sooner has Shylock learned that Antonio is deeper in trouble, than Tubal tells him of some new extravagance involving Jessica and the stolen money and jewels. \n"}, {"text": "What does Bassanio find in the leaden casket that tells him he has been successful in the lottery for Portia?", "correct": "Portia's portrait and a scroll", "options": ["Just a scroll which tells him he has won.", "A ring to put on Portia's finger and a scroll", "A copy of the will of Portia's father."], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortia's portrait and a scroll.\n\n\tBassanio's affection for Portia comes through in his description of Portia's portrait. He wonders how the artist could manage to continue after painting one of Portia's eyes - surely the one beautiful eye would have the power to steal both those of the artist. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the following said by Antonio to Salerio: \"The Duke cannot ... \"", "correct": "deny the course of law", "options": ["cause the Jew to change his mind", "deny the bond is forfeit", "bring Bassanio home to me"], "explanation": "\n\n\ndeny the course of law.\n\n\tNo matter how much the Duke of Venice may want to resist Shylock's claim for a pound of Antonio's flesh he cannot afford to interfere with the law. Venice is a trading nation and everything depends upon merchants keeping to the letter of their contracts. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Portia pretend she is going to stay when in reality she and Nerissa are going to Venice?", "correct": "a nearby monastery", "options": ["retired in her room in Belmont", "the city of Padua", "the city of Milan"], "explanation": "\n\n\na nearby monastery.\n\n\tLorenzo is the one that she tries to convince. Later a variation on this story will be used for both Bassanio and Gratiano. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the lawyer that the Duke of Venice has sent for to help him consider the case?", "correct": "Bellario", "options": ["Balthasar", "Falconbridge", "Portia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBellario.\n\n\tBalthasar is the name that Portia adopts when she appears in court. The Duke behaves like a judge and yet he needs the advice of lawyers in order to settle a case. \n"}, {"text": "What name from the Bible does Shylock use about the disguised Portia when he thinks she is advising judgement in his favour?", "correct": "Daniel", "options": ["Moses", "Solomon", "David"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaniel.\n\n\tFor Shylock Portia is a \"Daniel come to judgement\". However, when he hears the full explanation that she gives it is Gratiano who picks up the same name and uses the word \"Daniel\" to torture Shylock. \n"}, {"text": "Both Shylock and Gratiano use the same expression about having someone \"on the hip\" in this play. From which sport did Shakespeare borrow the term?", "correct": "wrestling", "options": ["archery", "bowls", "tennis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwrestling.\n\n\tIt means to have someone at a disadvantage for the hip is a pivot that you can use to create a fall in a wrestling match. \n"}, {"text": "Identify one of the pair of famous lovers that Lorenzo and Jessica talk about whilst waiting in the garden.", "correct": "Troilus and Cressida", "options": ["Antony and Cleopatra", "Romeo and Juliet", "Hero and Leander"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTroilus and Cressida.\n\n\tThe other pairs of lovers suggested in the same speech are Pyramus and Thisbe, Dido and Aeneas, Jason and Medea. The romantic scene serves the other very practical purpose of allowing the audience time to imagine the journey of the principal characters back from Venice to Belmont. \n"}, {"text": "By what does Gratiano swear by in order to convince Nerissa that he gave his ring to a lawyer's clerk rather than to a woman?", "correct": "by the moon", "options": ["by his immortal soul", "by his mother's life", "by his honour as a gentleman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nby the moon.\n\n\tWithout knowing it, of course, he did give his ring to a woman (Nerissa in disguise). Bassanio is about to get into the same sort of trouble with Portia. \n"}, {"text": "What does Gratiano fear he has become when he listens to Nerissa's story?", "correct": "a cuckold", "options": ["a coxcomb", "a bankrupt", "a fool", " a cuckold"], "explanation": "\n\n\na cuckold.\n\n\tA cuckold is a man whose wife has betrayed him with another man. It is probably Gratiano's use of this rather coarse word in polite company that makes Portia bring an end to the squabble by telling the truth. \n"}, {"text": "To whom does Portia say, \"You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letter\" ?", "correct": "Antonio", "options": ["Bassanio", "Gratiano", "Lorenzo and Jessica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAntonio.\n\n\tPerhaps the least successful part of Shakespeare's ending is this sudden miraculous arrival of three of his ships and then the equally unexplained route by which Portia got a letter about it. \n"}]}
