Besides being a talented actress, January Jones is an accomplished model as well (she ranked 82nd on \"Maxim's\" Hot 100 Women of 2002). \n"}, {"text": "As Bailey moves through the family crowd, she spots her uncle in the distance. She doesn't like talking to him; he think's he is so cool wearing his black suit and sunglasses... But we're inside a building!\n\nSporting dark sunglasses is useful when Agent K erases memories of alien encounters, but Bailey thinks it's silly when her uncle wears them to try to act like the actor with the same name as him.

He appears in many other wonderful films, including \"Hope Springs\" alongside Meryl Streep. \n"}, {"text": "Bailey has a great uncle who works as an impersonator, which is convenient given his name is the same as the one he impersonates. Though it annoys Bailey when he calls her \"Delilah\", she does enjoy it when her great uncle sings \"What's New, Pussycat\".\n\n\"It's Not Unusual\" for Bailey's relative to brag about his impersonating skills, but since \"She's a Lady\", Bailey gives him a \"Kiss\" on the cheek after he performs \"Green, Green Grass of Home\". What is the first name of the singer that Bailey's great uncle impersonates?", "correct": "Tom", "options": ["Harry", "Dick", "Johnny"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom.\n\n\tSir Thomas Woodward is an accomplished Welsh singer better known as Tom Jones.

His 1968 album, \"Delilah\", was the first album of his to reach number one on UK charts.\r Tom Jones became one of the coaches on \"The Voice UK\" in 2012. \n"}, {"text": "Since Bailey's cousin shares the same name as one of the members of the Monkees, it wasn't uncommon for the music to play during family reunions. Bailey wasn't overly fond of her cousin always bragging about being a famous Monkee - which of course he wasn't - he simply shared the name!\n\nBailey's cousin shared the first name of which of the Monkees, who sadly died in 2012 due to a severe heart attack?", "correct": "Davy", "options": ["Micky", "Mike", "Peter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavy.\n\n\tDavy Jones was an Englishman of many talents; he was an actor, singer, songwriter, guitarist, and businessman. He was perhaps most known for his time with the Monkees, as well as the television show of the same name. He was a member of the Monkees from 1966 to their disbanding in 1971. This wasn't the end, however. The Monkees were reunited, and again disbanded, several times throughout Jones' life. Tragically, however, in 2012, while tending to his horses, Davy Jones suffered a heart attack and passed away. \n"}, {"text": "Bailey never liked talking to her uncle's brother-in-law because he was always picking his nose. They call him \"The Possum\" because he shares the same name as a famous singer who also was known to pick his nose.\n\nThe singer, known for hits such as \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" and \"I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool\" has the same first name as Bailey's relative. What is the name?", "correct": "George", "options": ["Barney", "Elroy", "Fred"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge.\n\n\tGeorge Jones was an internationally successful country music singer and songwriter. He was often called the greatest living country music singer, until his death in 2013 (due to hypoxic respiratory failure). One week after his death, his 1980 #1 hit \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" found its way back onto country music charts, reaching #21 in 2013. He was known as \"The Possum\" due to his nose and facial features; he also admitted in one interview that he loved to pick his nose. \n"}, {"text": "Bailey's brother-in-law works at the local radio station, and his over-the-top radio personality had begun to find its way into his regular speech. For this reason, Bailey hated talking to him - his peppy attitude seemed to suck all the happiness right out of her.\n\nHis name is the same as a Welsh BBC Radio 2 presenter who also presents the television program \"Songs of Praise\"; he also sang a cover of \"Walking in the Air\".

Bashful Bailey was asked to introduce her cousin on stage to sing for the family. Bailey always hated doing this; she was jealous that she didn't get to sing along with her.\n\nBecause her cousin shared the same name as the singer of \"Come Away With Me\" and \"Don't Know Why\", it only seemed fitting that she would sing those first.

My personal favorite song of hers is \"Chasing Pirates\" on the 2009 album \"The Fall\".\r She also starred as Elizabeth in \"My Blueberry Nights\" in 2007. \n"}, {"text": "With beautiful music comes slow dancing. Bailey loves to dance, but when her cousin shows up, Bailey no longer enjoys herself. Her cousin always outshines her. Bailey isn't a bad dancer, but she never has quite the skill of her cousin.

She reached the top four of \"So You Think You Can Dance\", along with her partner (and eventual winner) Benji Schwimmer, without ever having entered the bottom three. \n"}, {"text": "Bailey doesn't hate her entire family, though. After her limelight is stolen by her cousin, she goes over to talk to her favorite family member; her grandfather. He is fun for Bailey to talk to, because what other 80-year-old man would say \"totes magotes\" (her grandfather began saying this after seeing a man on TV say it on a commercial)?\n\nWhich of these is the first name of an actor who voiced Mufasa and Darth Vader, who happens to share his name with Bailey's grandfather?", "correct": "James", "options": ["Luke", "Andrew", "Matthew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames.\n\n\tJames Earl Jones, known by many as \"one of the greatest actors in American History\", is known for many wonderful roles, including his role as the voice of Darth Vader from the \"Star Wars\" trilogy (1977, 1980, and 1983). He also voiced Simba's father, Mufasa, in Disney's \"The Lion King\" (1994). In 2013, he appeared in several commercials for Sprint alongside Malcolm McDowell, where both had conversations you'd expect to see as texts between teenage girls; \"totes magotes\", an awkward phrase meaning \"totally\", became quite a bit more popular after these commercials. \n"}, {"text": "After a long day, it is time for Bailey to go home, which she is quite happy about. She never likes going to her reunions, anyway. But she always likes the t-shirts she gets, which sported her family surname in big letters on the front, and all the names of the family on the back.\n\nIf you answered the first nine questions correctly, you may have noticed that each of the famous people share the same last name. Bailey's family share the same last name as well.
