One day, after ordering a glass of champagne, he turned around to find The Countess on his bed. She realized who he really was almost immediately and decided that he should commit and become the goddess he needed to.  She christened him 'Liz Taylor' and urged him to go to the Roxy with her but he decided that was a bit much. Instead, she sent him to get some ice, inadvertently causing him to run into his coworkers returning from a strip club.  When they turned around, they ran into The Countess and met their end.
