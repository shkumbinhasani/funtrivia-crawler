{"id": "380", "name": "The Fahrenheit Scale Multiple Choice Quiz | Miscellaneous Science | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Miscellaneous Science", " Time and Distance Measurements"], "questions": [{"text": "At what temperature, at sea level, does water boil?", "correct": "212 F", "options": ["180 F", "100 F", "170 F"], "explanation": "\n\n\n212 F.\n\n\tBut of course the higher you go and thus the lower the atmospheric pressure, the lower the temperature has to be. \n"}, {"text": "In 1983, what low temperature was recorded at Vostok, Antarctica?", "correct": "-129 F", "options": ["-197 F", "-103 F", "-53 F"], "explanation": "\n\n\n-129 F.\n\n\tA human being, or any other creature for that matter, could not survive for long at such a temperature. \n"}, {"text": "Most people die once their fever reaches which temperature?", "correct": "107 F", "options": ["130 F", "100 F", "194 F"], "explanation": "\n\n\n107 F.\n\n\tA person would be long dead before a fever reached 130 F or 194 F. \n"}, {"text": "On the Fahrenheit scale, what temperature is given as the freezing point of water?", "correct": "32 F", "options": ["47 F", "0 F", "19 F"], "explanation": "\n\n\n32 F.\n\n\tThat is, given normal atmospheric pressure at sea level and 'normal' water, not salt water. However, it is not quite as straightforward as that as experiments with pure water have shown it can stay liquid at much lower temperatures. \n"}, {"text": "In 1999, a woman survived despite her body temperature dropping to 56.7 F.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Swedish woman had an accident while skiing and became trapped in ice. In hospital, she was warmed up gradually until her heart started beating again nearly a day after the accident. She went on to make a virtually full recovery. \n"}, {"text": "What was the typical daytime temperature on the surface of Mars, as recorded by Viking 1?", "correct": "-22 F", "options": ["67 F", "33 F", "-1 F"], "explanation": "\n\n\n-22 F.\n\n\tIn the evening it gets much, much colder. \n"}, {"text": "What temperature does butter melt at, approximately?", "correct": "88 F", "options": ["73 F", "80 F", "62 F"], "explanation": "\n\n\n88 F.\n\n\tButter gets soft very quickly after it's removed from the refrigerator, especially when the temperature is approaching the melting point. \n"}, {"text": "What is the ideal temperature for a baby's bottle, and the normal body temperature for a human being?", "correct": "98.6 F (37 C)", "options": ["101.2 F (38.4 C)", "88.7 F (31.5 C)", "94.2 F (34.6 C)"], "explanation": "\n\n\n98.6 F (37 C)\n\n\tOf course the 98.6 degree figure is only an average figure for a human body.  If you are slightly higher or lower than that, you're just fine. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is closest to room temperature (scientifically speaking)?", "correct": "70 F (21 C)", "options": ["55 F (13 C)", "60 F (16 C)", "86 F (30 C)"], "explanation": "\n\n\n70 F (21 C).\n\n\t'Room temperature' is an arbitrary measure used in laboratory experiments and taken roughly as about 70 degrees Fahrenheit (and, in some cases, up to 75 degrees F or 24 degrees Celsius). \n"}, {"text": "What was the hottest outdoor shade temperature recorded on Earth in the twentieth century (at Furnace Creek Ranch, CA, USA, July 10, 1913)?", "correct": "134.0 F (56.7 Celsius)", "options": ["122.1 F (50.05 Celsius)", "194 F (90 Celsius)", "173.2 F (78.4 Celsius)"], "explanation": "\n\n\n134.0 F (56.7 Celsius)\n\n\tGet a rock and you could fry an egg there...even in the shade. For a long time the record was considered to have been just over 136\u00b0F (57.8 Celsius) in Libya, but this measurement has been found to have been unreliable and most likely faulty. \n"}]}
