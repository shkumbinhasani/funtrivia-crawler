{"id": "347422", "name": "Take Me To Your Leader Quiz | Christian People / Saints | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "Christian People / Saints", "Patron Saints"], "questions": [{"text": "Apiarists!  Take me to your leader!\nThe buzz around this patron saint is clear; which saint is the patron of bees?", "correct": "St. Ambrose", "options": ["St. Gregory", "St. Augustine", "St. Jerome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Ambrose\n\n\tBorn in Germany, Ambrose lived most of his life in Milan, Italy as an original doctor of the church.  Living his life in the fourth century, he has been venerated as a saint multiple times.  He happens to be a busy man-- he was a patron saint not only of bees and beekeepers, but also candles, wax, and the city of Milan.\rAccording to stories of his life, bees featured prominently in his infancy.  He later became Bishop of Milan, building the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio.  This structure took a great deal of damage during bombings in World War II.\rSaint Valentine is also a patron saint for beekeepers and so is St. Bernard of Clairvaux. \n"}, {"text": "Soldiers!  Take me to your leader!\nSaint Sebastian happens to be the saint I'm looking for here.  He also happens to be the patron saint of which of these?", "correct": "Plagues", "options": ["Stiff necks", "Fever", "Dental work"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlagues.\n\n\tHailing from Milan, Italy, Saint Sebastian was said to have lived in the third century.  He converted several non-believers and worked miracles in his time despite being in prison for a great deal of time.  In addition, Saint Sebastian was said to have have cured people of the plague and protected them from infection. In addition to being the patron saint of plagues and soldiers, he became the patron saint of arrows.  Why?  At one point it was said that he was killed by arrows; this story is contested as others believed he was beaten to death.  His remains were supposedly placed into the Basilica Apostolorum. \n"}, {"text": "Bomb squads!  Take me to your leader!\nSaint Barbara is the patron saint of explosives and fireworks.  This is partly because of her unorthodox association with what natural occurrence?", "correct": "Lightning", "options": ["Forest fires", "Static cling", "Spontaneous combustion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLightning.\n\n\tSaint Barbara was beheaded by her father in the fourth century after converting from Paganism to Christianity, but not before a series of miracles including (and not limited to) turning a betrayer to stone, turning his sheep into locusts, and her own teleportation.  In a proto-feminist move, Barbara refused the marriage offer set forth by her father and fled to pray to her new savior.  This set forth a chain of evens leading to her inevitable canonization.  After her father beheaded her, he was allegedly struck by lightning and she's been associated with it ever since.\rYou may know her better as 'Santa Barbara'; the California city is named after her.  She's also the patron saint of the U.S. Navy, miners, artillerymen, and fireworks makers.  Presumably, her canonization sparked debate, but that would only help, right? \n"}, {"text": "Couch potatoes!  Take me to your leader!\nThis patron saint isn't attributed to couch potatoes particularly, but they are attributed to television...and telephones...and eye diseases.  Which of these saints is it?", "correct": "St. Clare of Assisi", "options": ["St. Gabriel", "St. Frances of Rome", "St. Lawrence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Clare of Assisi\n\n\tLiving her entire life in Assisi, Italy, St. Clare of Assisi was canonized two years after her death in the mid-1250s.  A fervent supporter of St. Francis of Assisi, Clare remained faithful to religion despite poverty and declining health.  Oddly, she became the patron saint of TV in the twentieth century.  Why?  According to stories, she attended mass by seeing and hearing it through the walls of her house when she became too sick to attend.  She is also the patron saint of laundry, telegraphs, and gilders.\rSt. Frances of Rome is the patron saint of drivers, St. Gabriel is the patron saint of police dispatchers (amongst several other things), and St. Lawrence is the patron saint of comedians. \n"}, {"text": "Northeast Asians!  Take me to your leader!\nSaint Andrew Kim Taegon was canonized in the 1980s as the patron saint of which Asian nation?", "correct": "Korea", "options": ["Japan", "Russia", "China"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKorea.\n\n\tAndrew Kim Taegon, who lived in the nineteenth century, was canonized because he was the first Catholic priest in Korea during a time dominated by the Chinese-based Confucian belief system.  He's not the only patron saint of Korea though-- Saint Joseph, the husband of the Virgin Mary, also oversees this part of the world (in addition to Canada, Mexico, Croatia, Peru, and a slew of other countries).\rSaint Peter Baptist and Saint Francis Xavier are patron saints for Japan, China shares Saint Joseph and Saint Francis Xavier, and Russia has a series of saints including Basil the Great, Nicholas of Myra, and Vladimir I of Kiev. \n"}, {"text": "Astronauts!  Take me to your leader!\nJoseph of Cupertino became the patron saint of astronauts and aviation because of which of these abnormal events?", "correct": "He was said to have levitated uncontrollably", "options": ["He allegedly teleported himself into the heavens", "He supposedly became a constellation after death", "His ashes were shot into space"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was said to have levitated uncontrollably.\n\n\tJoseph of Cupertino was canonized a century after his death in the mid-to-late seventeenth century.  Despite learning disabilities (for which he is also a patron saint), Joseph was allegedly able to levitate uncontrollably which, I guess, is a benefit.  The funny thing is that he ended up flying when filled with reverence.  Aside from the ability to fly, he was also well-known for healing miracles.\rThe city of Cupertino was named after this saint.  Joseph's hometown, Copertino, is in Italy (in the heel of the boot).  Unsurprisingly, the two locations are twin cities. \n"}, {"text": "Citizens of Paris!  Take me to your leader!\nWhile more than one patron saint graces the Parisians in France, only one of them was beheaded in the third century (AD).  Who was it?", "correct": "Saint Denis", "options": ["St. Joan of Arc", "Saint Genevieve", "Saint Cecilia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaint Denis.\n\n\tSaint Denis, along with Saint Rusticus and Saint Elutherius, resided on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in Paris, France and performed conversions near the Seine until they were beheaded on what is now regarded as Montmartre; this region was allegedly named because of their decapitations and subsequent burials.  Many statues made in the likeness of Saint Denis depict him holding his head.  He also happens to be the patron saint of headaches.  Go figure.\rSaint Genevieve is also a Parisian patron saint; she is claimed to have defended Paris from Attila the Hun though her prayers.\rSt. Joan of Arc, while from France, is a patron saint in Quebec while Saint Cecilia, a blind patron saint, watched over Albi, France. \n"}, {"text": "Internet users!  Take me to your leader!\nSure enough, there's a patron saint of the Internet.  Was Saint Isidore of Seville alive during the inception of the Internet?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNot by a long-shot!  Saint Isidore of Seville died in the year 636, thirteen and a half centuries before the Internet became available to most users.  That makes this patronage all the more perplexing, doesn't it?\rThis particular saint was well-known for his scholarly pursuits and his contributions to the written word; since he hand-wrote many Spanish historical texts and a full dictionary, he became known as the patron saint of schoolchildren and, despite having never used one, the patron saint of computers.  In 2000, he was officially canonized as the patron saint of the Internet.  By sheer coincidence, this announcement was made just over 1337 years after his death, making him shockingly relevant to most immature Internet users. \n"}, {"text": "Alcoholics!  Take me to your leader!\nThe patron saint of vintners and, unsurprisingly (considering the wine), faintness, is which of these religious figures?", "correct": "St. Urban of Langres", "options": ["St. Vitus", "St. Drogo", "St. B\u00e9n\u00e9zet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Urban of Langres\n\n\tSt. Urban of Langres lived during the fourth century AD in France (in a vineyard, no less).  As thanks for protection in the vineyard, he converted the owners to Christianity and spread through the French wine country.  He also happens to be the patron saint of both Langres in northeastern France and Dijon, slightly south.\rTheobald of Provins is a patron saint of winegrowers as well, but he's also the patron saint of panic attacks.  Urp!\rSt. Vitus became the patron saint of comedians and actors, St. B\u00e9n\u00e9zet is the patron saint of bridge-building and the city of Avignon, France, and Saint Drogo is the patron saint of...uh...unattractive people (due to horrible physical deformities he received during a pilgrimage). \n"}, {"text": "Can anyone take me to their leader... later on?\nSt. Expeditus, a figure who was allegedly responsible for spreading Christianity in South America, was actually known for being the patron saint of which of these?", "correct": "Procrastination", "options": ["Amnesia", "Tardiness", "Uncertainty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProcrastination.\n\n\tLittle is known about the early life of St. Expeditus though it is said that he had influences in the Indian Ocean, the Chilean coast, and Haiti.  Regardless of the vast ground he seemed to have covered, he passed away in Turkey in the fourth century... at least according to tales from that time period.  Nothing has ever confirmed that he was a real person.\rThe name 'Expeditus' seems to evoke a feeling of speed though, doesn't it?  For this reason he's often associated with occupations requiring a bit of extra speed (eg. sailors).  He is also the patron saint of Molossia, a micronation established in 1999 by a man in Nevada.  Lucky, eh? \n"}]}
