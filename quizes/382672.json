Lucas is shouting on the other end, biking as fast as he can to relay the message that Eleven's bad men are coming. Sure enough, when Mike looks out the window, a power company van is parked outside.  Mike runs off to tell his mother before Dustin watches three more vans pull up.  The kids grab their bikes and flee out the back, but not before they're spotted.  Soon, a chase commences through the suburban streets. \n"}, {"text": "To prevent the boys from getting hit by a van, Eleven does which of these?", "correct": "Sends it flying in the air over them", "options": ["Sets it on fire", "Drains the battery", "Shoots the driver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSends it flying in the air over them.\n\n\tRiding through local yards and down streets, the boys end up nearly colliding with Lucas, still riding to help them out.  Their rendezvous brings the vans closer to their destination and the kids get flanked with vehicles pushing them from both the front and back.  Before the van in front of them can collide with them though, Eleven uses her powers to flip it into the air, sending it careening over them and blocking off the other three, allowing for their getaway. They all make it out to the auto wrecks and Lucas formally apologizes for calling Eleven a traitor.  He and Mike finally shake hands. \n"}, {"text": "What do the police find in Jonathan's trunk?", "correct": "Hunting supplies", "options": ["A body", "A gun", "Nothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHunting supplies.\n\n\tJoyce and Hopper make it to the police station to find Jonathan in cuffs for assaulting a police officer.  The cops ask Hopper to check his trunk and they find the hunting equipment in a box, waiting for them.  Jonathan claims that no one would believe why he bought them, but they head into Hopper's office anyways.\rKaren heads into the basement to find the boys missing, but pieces of Eleven's wig on the floor.  Soon, the agents arrive and begin pulling evidence from the house.  Mike's parents assure the agents that their son hasn't been harbouring a girl in the basement as they would've known.  Dr. Brenner asks for their trust and cooperation, and there's really not much of a choice. \n"}, {"text": "The boys are forced to hide in a bus when which of these appears?", "correct": "Helicopter", "options": ["Parents", "Monster", "Hunting dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHelicopter.\n\n\tThe boys discuss a plan of attack.  They can't go home, so they need to do something.  While they contemplate storming the fortress, they hear a helicopter in the distance and act fast to hide their bikes and themselves, stowing the former under an abandoned bus and themselves inside.\rJonathan and Nancy show Hopper and Joyce the photo taken at Steve's house and it's clear all of them believe something big is happening.  Hopper has to head to the main office to field a complaint.  The bully's mother has arrived to make a statement about her boy's arm being broken by, as it would seem, a freak.  Hopper immediately perks up at the report, especially since she could make you fly.  He says that she always hangs out with Mike, Dustin, and Lucas. \n"}, {"text": "How do Nancy and Hopper contact the boys while they're in hiding?", "correct": "Via walkie-talkie", "options": ["Via morse code", "Via phone", "Through Will"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVia walkie-talkie.\n\n\tSteve and his friends head to a local convenience mart after having escaped the cops and they all think about their past hours.  Soon, they're all fighting about Nancy, the fight with Jonathan, and everything else.  Steve decides to leave and heads back to the theatre to make amends by removing the offensive graffiti from their marquee sign.\rTons of the Wheelers' personal belongings are boxed up and taken away while Nancy, Joyce, Jonathan, and Hopper watch from a hill.  Hopper has to restrain Nancy to prevent her from going home and, as they spy the helicopter in the distance, they try to think about where they all might have gone.  They head home on Jonathan's request and locate Will's walkie-talkie, having Nancy contact her brother.  The boys think it may be a trick until Hopper speaks...and they respond. \n"}, {"text": "Does Hopper locate the boys before the government agents can grab them?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tMike's parents are worried about the government agents who, finally, leave and allow the Wheelers to remain in their house (albeit with less things).  Karen is extremely concerned though; Brenner gives her the creeps.\rThe boys, trapped in the bus, finally hear cars coming up in the distance.  It's not Hopper though-- it's the agents...and they have guns.  The agents find their bikes and in no time they head in to search the bus, but they're quickly disarmed and knocked out by Hopper who yells at them to get out.\rThey all return to the Byers household to meet up with Joyce, Nancy, and Jonathan. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin calls Mr. Clarke late at night asking about which of the following topics?", "correct": "Sensory deprivation", "options": ["The human genome", "Parallel universes", "Mind control"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSensory deprivation.\n\n\tIt doesn't take long for the boys to bring the others up to speed on their flea and acrobat analogy, and after telling everyone that the gate can be tracked to the Hawkins labs, they try to figure out a way to get in.  Fortunately, Hopper's been inside and seen the gate.  They ask Eleven if she can contact the other side to locate Barb as well as Will, but when she does, with a picture of Barb and the walkie-talkie, she can't find either of them.\rHeading to the bathroom to wash her face off, Eleven looks in the mirror and finds the bathtub.  She says she can find them if she uses it.\rTo do so, however, Dustin needs to call Mr. Clarke...at 10pm on a Saturday night, during a date...to ask how to build a sensory deprivation tank in one's own home. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Hopper find 1,500lbs of de-icing salt?", "correct": "The middle school", "options": ["The police station", "The quarry", "The hardware store"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe middle school.\n\n\tTo accomplish everything they need to, Hopper brings a team to the middle school to collect some supplies, one such thing being 1,500lbs of salt.  Dustin brings a large wading pool to the gymnasium with Lucas and they quickly set it up (though with a bit of hassle.  Jonathan and Nancy head out to find a hose and talk about honesty, both of them refusing to acknowledge that they like new people after the recent events.\rJoyce helps Eleven get ready for her trip into the new bathtub and thanks her, promising to be with her the whole time she goes to the upside down.  They get the temperature correct and the salt levels just right, they set up the walkie-talkie, and Eleven puts on a blindfold before stepping in. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Eleven find Will in the upside down?", "correct": "In his fort", "options": ["In a tree", "In his house", "In a classroom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn his fort.\n\n\tIt doesn't take long before the lights go out, and Eleven opens her eyes in the pitch black of the upside down.  She asks for Barb and sees something in the distance, slowly making her way over to find her body, webbed to the ground, long-dead.\rEleven hears Joyce whispering to her that everything is okay; she's safe with her.\rLooking around, Eleven spies Castle Byers, Will's fort in the woods, and when she goes through the door she finds Will there, hiding alone, barely hanging in.  The others hear him on the walkie-talkie as she speaks to him, but soon the fort disappears as though a vision and Eleven has to be pulled out of the pool. \n"}, {"text": "After Eleven's trip to the upside down, who remains with her as protection?", "correct": "The boys", "options": ["Nancy", "Joyce", "Jonathan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe boys.\n\n\tHopper heads out to go to Castle Byers and is unable to convince Joyce out of following along, knowing he can't prevent her from joining.  Jonathan is asked to stay behind with the others to make sure they're all safe.  Nancy, however, feels differently, knowing they need to go out and do something; she suggests going to the station and grabbing their supplies.  They need to finish what they started.  They collect their claimed things (and a fire extinguisher) and escape without being seen.\rHopper isn't heading to the woods though; he instead makes his way out to the Hawkins labs and cuts through the fence only for him and Joyce to get caught.\rIn the upside down, Will shivers as the monster stalks by the door.  It finally finds him, breaking through the wall \n"}]}
