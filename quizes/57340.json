{"id": "57340", "name": "The Word Play of Xu Bing Quiz | Individual Artists | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Individual Artists", "Artists N-Z"], "questions": [{"text": "Born in China in 1955, Xu Bing was forced to move to the United States in the face of criticism from government officials. Which of his works in particular did they single out as 'elitist' and 'incomprehensible'?", "correct": "'Book from the Sky'", "options": ["'Landscript'", "'The Living Word'", "'ABC . . .'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Book from the Sky'.\n\n\tFor 'Book from the Sky,' Xu Bing spent years developing characters that followed all the rules for Chinese ideograms, yet meant nothing. He then created a book using only these meaningless characters, binding several copies using traditional Chinese methods and putting another copy into scroll form. The result is a room filled with what looks like a collection of profound and scholarly tomes, signifying nothing. \n"}, {"text": "In what year did Xu Bing come to the American Midwest?", "correct": "1990", "options": ["1992", "1989", "1991"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1990.\n\n\tUnpopular with the Communist government of China, he began his time in America in Wisconsin, but moved to New York in 1993. In 1999, he received a MacArthur Genius Grant. \n"}, {"text": "Xu Bing had some trouble adjusting to America, and particularly to the English language. Which of these works is a set of ceramic blocks of type, each one representing an English letter with one or more Chinese characters?", "correct": "'ABC'", "options": ["'Monkeys Grasp for the Moon'", "'The Living Word'", "'Book from the Sky'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'ABC'.\n\n\tReversing the typical order of transliteration, 'ABC' begins with evocative homophones for each letter - the character representing 'A' means 'sadness,' while the character for 'B' means 'the other shore' - but degenerates into a statement of the ultimate randomness of alphabets and language. \n"}, {"text": "The sculpture 'Monkeys Grasp for the Moon' involves several interlocking primate shapes, joined in a chain to reach for a reflecting pool just below their reach. What is special about these 'monkeys'?", "correct": "Each 'monkey' is actually text meaning 'monkey'", "options": ["Each 'monkey' is dressed in a spacesuit.", "Each monkey is actually a political caricature.", "Each 'monkey' is actually a ceramic block of type."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEach 'monkey' is actually text meaning 'monkey'.\n\n\tMore than a dozen languages are represented, each word stylized so as to resemble a monkey. Xu Bing has written that the inspiration for this work came from an old folktale in which a group of monkeys feared that the moon had fallen into a still pond, and formed a long chain to reach down and save it. When the lowest monkey touched the water and the 'moon' disappeared, they realized it had been an illusion. \n"}, {"text": "Intrigued as always by the relationship between word and meaning, Xu Bing completed in 2001 a project in which he paints landscapes composed of descriptive ideograms. What is the name of this project?", "correct": "'Landscript'", "options": ["'ABC . . .'", "'The Living Word'", "'Book from the Sky'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Landscript'.\n\n\tFor example, a stone wall in one of the landscapes is composed of stylized renderings of the ideogram for 'rock', piled atop one another. It was at this point in the exhibition that I really began to wish I could read Chinese! \n"}, {"text": "In 'The Living Word,' a stream of characters lifts off the page, evolving in flight from modern ideogram to ancient pictogram. What does the original ideogram mean?", "correct": "bird", "options": ["imagination", "bat", "sun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbird.\n\n\tThe starting text, each ideogram an plexiglass shape instead of an inked figure, is the dictionary definition of the word 'niao' (bird). Breaking free of language, though, the words begin to soar - and even before the characters themselves begin to look like birds, the shadows they cast are those of birds in flight. The piece is really something to see: dozens of colorful shapes, suspended from fishing line, in full flight towards the exit. \n"}, {"text": "In each of his exhibitions from the late 1990s onward, Xu Bing has taken an old landscape painting from the museum's collection and adapted it how?", "correct": "By extending it beyond its frame with evocative ideograms.", "options": ["By repainting it in a more Chinese style.", "By extending it beyond its frame with a mural.", "By adding a detailed description in Square Word Calligraphy."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy extending it beyond its frame with evocative ideograms.\n\n\tAs in 'Landscript,' this extension of the original painting represents features of the landscape with descriptive ideograms (a stylized form of the word for 'water' flows between the banks of a river, for example). As in 'The Living Word,' the ideograms are acrylic and three-dimensional. Their arrangement is also often three-dimensional, extending onto the walls and floor. \n"}, {"text": "Exploring the link between writing, meaning, and culture, Xu Bing developed an innovative way of writing English: New English, or Square Word, Calligraphy. What is special about this writing style?", "correct": "The writing is English but looks Chinese.", "options": ["Rounded letters are squared off, and even 'M' has only right angles.", "The writing looks English but is nonsense.", "It resembles Carolingian miniscule, even though it was developed independently."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe writing is English but looks Chinese.\n\n\tIn Square Word Calligraphy, the letters of each word are arranged around each other in such a way that the ensemble resembles a Chinese ideogram. With some practice, however, an English speaker can learn to read Square Word. \n"}, {"text": "Xu Bing's showpiece for Square Word Calligraphy is a translation of the words of what leader?", "correct": "Mao Zedong", "options": ["Karl Marx", "Deng Xiaoping", "Jiang Zemin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMao Zedong.\n\n\tThe quotation selected insists that 'art is for the people.' \n"}, {"text": "Beginning in 2000, Xu Bing's exhibitions now include a classroom setting, complete with workbooks and instructional video, in which visitors can try their hand at what art?", "correct": "Square Word Calligraphy", "options": ["Chinese calligraphy", "Chinese bookmaking", "printing with moveable type"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSquare Word Calligraphy.\n\n\tThere's also a prototype computer program which will translate your name into Square Word Calligraphy. I hope you run across the work of Xu Bing in the future - it's stunning stuff! \n"}]}
