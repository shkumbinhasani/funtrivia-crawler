Leonard, the 1936 film 'The Great Ziegfeld' traces the fascinating life of famed stage producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.  William Powell plays the title role in the film, while Myrna Loy plays Billie Burke, and Louise Rainer is Anna Held.

E. Lawrence", "options": ["Richard Burton", "Francis Drake", "James Cook"], "explanation": "\n\n\nT. E. Lawrence\n\n\t'Lawrence of Arabia' has to rank among the greatest biopics ever produced.  Thanks to the brilliant precision directing of David Lean and the magnetic performance by Peter O'Toole, this film won a Best Picture Oscar in early 1963.  It also helps that the film included such actors as Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Omar Sharif, Jos\u00e9 Ferrer, Anthony Quayle and Claude Rains in supporting roles! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the 2004 film starring Kevin Kline that follows the life and times of the eminent American songwriter Cole Porter?", "correct": "De-Lovely", "options": ["Let's Misbehave", "Night and Day", "Anything Goes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDe-Lovely.\n\n\tAlong with Kline's Porter, Ashley Judd appears as Porter's very supportive wife Linda.

Despite the criticism Spacey received for his insistence on performing these songs (and for playing the part of a man a number of years his younger), the film is worth a watch. \n"}, {"text": "'The Insider' is a film about a man whose name is not generally known to the public, Dr. Jeffrey Wigand.  Which Oscar-winner portrays the brave whistle-blower in this 1999 film?", "correct": "Russell Crowe", "options": ["Gene Hackman", "Tom Hanks", "Robert De Niro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRussell Crowe.\n\n\t'The Insider' is a harrowing tale about a tobacco industry insider who helped make known to the world some important behind-the-scenes information on industry malpractices.  Russell Crowe is supported in the cast by Al Pacino as CBS producer Lowell Bergman and Christopher Plummer as '60 Minutes' reporter Mike Wallace.  This is a must-see. \n"}, {"text": "'The Motorcycle Diaries' is a beautiful film about the early life of South American-born revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.

Gibson also garnered a Best Director Oscar for his work on this film.  The battle scenes in the movie alone are worth watching, and the story is quite charming and inspirational as well (though the ending is a tad bit overdramatized). \n"}, {"text": "Mel Gibson returns to the directing chair for the 2004 film 'The Passion of the Christ'.  Is it true that Mr. Gibson also plays the lead role of Christ in the film?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\t'The Passion of the Christ' presents the final days of Jesus Christ, painstakingly played by James Caviezel on the screen.  As controversial as the film is, the visuals are absolutely mesmerizing (if not painful to watch).  Just for its filmmaking quality alone, this is a must watch (though I would not allow young children to view it). \n"}, {"text": "'Sergeant York' is a 1941 film about America's greatest war hero from World War I.
