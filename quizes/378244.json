{"id": "378244", "name": "\"Room 33\" Online Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Hotel"], "questions": [{"text": "The Countess had a child in which decade?", "correct": "The 1920s", "options": ["The 1960s", "The 1940s", "The 1980s"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe 1920s.\n\n\tIn 1926, The Countess steps out of her cab and walks up to the front door of what would later be known as the Los Angeles Murder House.  Dr. Montgomery is still the owner at this time.  Elizabeth is there because she's pregnant, sporting a large baby bump...but it's only been three weeks.  The doctor brings her downstairs to the basement, into his chambers, and while his nurse is initially worried due to her low body temperature, the procedure continues on.  The baby is removed, but it's still alive; it kills the nurse immediately. When Elizabeth awakens, she comes face to face with her baby boy. \n"}, {"text": "Who, as it turns out, has been sleeping with Tristan?", "correct": "Liz Taylor", "options": ["Will Drake", "Iris", "Ramona Royale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiz Taylor.\n\n\tDet. Lowe wakes up to find Holden in his bed and soon races through the hallways of the Hotel Cortez to search for him, quickly stumbling on the pool and the coffins therein.  To his shock, his wife sleeps in one of them.\rElsewhere, Liz Taylor spends the night with Tristan, the two enjoying each others' company in bed.  Liz hands over a stack of classic literature and insists that he read them; he never read either until he moved out to the Hotel Cortez.  Tristan claims that he genuinely loves Liz, and she reciprocates.  Liz, however, knows that it won't end well since she pulled him away from The Countess. \n"}, {"text": "When John brings Alex to the pool to confirm his suspicions, does he find the glass coffins inside?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe Countess happens to be sleeping with Will Drake who, despite loving women for his career, is gay.  Elizabeth decides to take this as a challenge since, unbeknownst to the man who now owns the hotel, she wants his money.  She texts Tristan to come up to the penthouse, which he does, and forces him to spend an hour in bed with the two of them.\rAlex heads to the lobby to speak with Liz.  When John found the sleeping chamber and fainted, she gave him drugs to knock him out and bring him back to his room.  They decide to remove the coffins for a little bit...and Alex finds some old clothes and heads to her husband's room.  She lies, says that he called her, and claims that he was out in the hallway.  His alleged dream is similar to Scarlett's claim's that the coffins were in the pool room, so he must be making it up.  When they head to the pool room and find it empty, he has no choice but to believe her.  Liz and Alex smashed the coffins only hours before. \n"}, {"text": "What is contained in Room 33?", "correct": "A nursery", "options": ["A storage closet", "A bar", "A records room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA nursery.\n\n\tThe Countess takes a key and walks through the halls to Room 33, a room set aside as a darkened nursery.  She says she's leaving to Paris to come into a lot of money and promises never to leave again.\rRamona Royale and Donovan enter the Hotel Cortez, walking past Iris at the front desk and taking the elevator, knowing full well that Elizabeth is out for the time being.  Ramona demands they head to the basement to kill the children, but they aren't aware that they've been relocated.  Ramona heads off alone to discover this (alongside Iris) while Donovan heads to the penthouse.  Discovering that The Countess' only raison d'etre is her children, she insists that Iris grab the key for Room 33. \n"}, {"text": "Who appears to Donovan when he breaks into The Countess' penthouse?", "correct": "Two Swedish tenants", "options": ["Mr. March", "Tristan", "Sally"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo Swedish tenants.\n\n\tDonovan heads to the penthouse while Ramona heads to the basement and he finds he can't shake off his obsession with The Countess but while there he runs into the two Swedish girls who were killed in the hotel.  They're searching for a way out, but he informs them that they're stuck there, in limbo, until they can find some sort of purpose. The hotel has the power to prevent them from leaving.  Some break free, but most don't.  One elementary school teacher came to the Cortez to end her life...and she did, slitting her wrists in the tub...but she found a purpose in the afterlife: she terrorized some of the guests. They'll never leave, by any means, but they can probably break free of the monotony.  When they ask if he ever had a purpose, he claims he lost it when he lost The Countess. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of The Countess' child?", "correct": "Bartholemew", "options": ["Thaddeus", "Beauregard", "Hugo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBartholemew.\n\n\tWhen the door to Room 33 unlocks, Ramona is the one to do it, ultimately uncovering Bartholomew, hiding under a chest of drawers; he quickly shifts across the room to avoid the attacker.  He fights back though, in an inhuman manner.  Liz, coming across the open door to Room 33, finds Ramona inside, relatively fine, and leaves her at the bar to tend to her wounds while Alex is sent off to look for the escaped child.  Liz, of course, has to ask Ramona to leave but he lets her know, like an old friend, that she's in love with Tristan.  Ramona suggests they flee.\rAlex, meanwhile, finds the Swedish girls in their room; they've killed a man in search of their purpose, seducing him and stabbing him with an ice pick.  Alex suggests that they not kill anyone else; they can break peoples' minds instead. \n"}, {"text": "Another Ten Commandments murder happens, and this time at a church, but to whom?", "correct": "A televangelist", "options": ["An organist", "A suspected murderer", "A choir ensemble"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA televangelist.\n\n\tDet. Lowe heads to a crime scene despite his being fired to find what appears to be yet another murder by the Ten Commandments Killer; a televangelist, his entrails stuffed with silver coins, is likely dead for having taken the Lord's name in vain.  Someone is in custody, however.\rThat night, John tries to call Scarlett but can't get through.  Liz Taylor walks by and strikes up a conversation, but it's clear John wants to wallow in his alcohol a little bit, so she tries to take him to his room.  Liz leaves him to himself, but that's when the Swedish girls take the opportunity to ambush him, seduce him, and bring him back to his room. \n"}, {"text": "After his one-night stand with two of the hotel's ghosts, John encounters who of these people in his room?", "correct": "Mr. March", "options": ["Alex", "Holden", "The Countess"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. March\n\n\tJohn, drunk, spends a short time in bed with the Swedes before things get weird; the two girls start killing each other, spilling their blood and frightening John out of his suite, forcing him to run naked to Liz in the lobby.  All signs point to his own mental breakdown, of course, and when they both return to the suite they find Miss Evers gathering the linens for the wash (and complaining the whole way) and the Swedes just leaving, fully clothed and clean, excited to have found a purpose.\rMr. March is there too, and he states that he's glad he's checking into the Hotel Cortez, finally.  When John lunges at him, he disappears.\rJohn gathers his clothes and prepares to leave, but realizes he's covered in blood, instead opting to take a shower.  That's when Bartholomew appears, hiding in his suitcase.\rJohn finally checks out. \n"}, {"text": "John checks out of the Hotel Cortez and returns home.  Does he go home alone?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tJohn returns to his empty home having picked Scarlett up on the way; neither of them know where Alex is.  Scarlett is angry and wonders when her dad will be leaving next since the divorce is pending, but he insists he won't go until they sort things out.  When she runs to her room, he opens his suitcase before following her.  He doesn't see the movement in amongst his clothes.\rWhen John returns to his room, his clothes aren't quite the way he left them.  He pulls the gun out of his closet and begins to wash his bloody laundry.  Heading downstairs he sees a shadow in the distance and follows it into the kitchen to find something truly frightening.  He fires his gun several times, hitting it once, while Scarlett runs in fear. \n"}, {"text": "Does The Countess allow Liz to 'have' Tristan, in the end?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe Countess returns to Los Angeles with Will Drake and his son and while the two men go to bed, Liz takes the opportunity to sit down with her to have a chat.

When he leaves, Alex find Bartholomew outside, hiding in the bushes.\rTristan heads to Liz's room to find The Countess already there.  They're served drinks and it doesn't take long before Tristan, angrily, stands up to Elizabeth.

She tells Liz to bury him; he's all hers.\rThat night, The Countess heads to Room 33 to find Alex tending to Bartholomew.  She admits that the baby got out, but he'll be just fine.  When Alex passes him over to his mother, she's thanked for saving him before she leaves.  The Countess is left to admire her baby...who's not entirely human. \n"}]}
