{"id": "340772", "name": "  Video Games Quiz: Plants Vs. Zombies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games L-P", "Plants vs Zombies"], "questions": [{"text": "In the game, obviously, there are both plants and zombies.  Which of them can shoot peas in the extended GOTY (Game of the Year) version?", "correct": "Both", "options": ["Zombies", "Plants", "Neither"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoth.\n\n\tThis was perhaps a little tricky, because on the PC only the plants shoot peas.  However, in the extended home console version of the game, more bonus levels are added, and special levels are added throughout.  One of the new levels added had a special challenge; the zombie heads were replaced with peashooter heads and even wall-nut heads.  This made defeating the zombies a little more difficult.  They were harder to destroy and they also destroyed plants before actually reaching them. \n"}, {"text": "If a zombie can successfully get through your plants, what final item is used to stop him before he reaches your home?", "correct": "Lawnmower", "options": ["Nothing; that's it, game over", "Bomb", "A special plant that will destroy all zombies on screen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLawnmower.\n\n\tIf a zombie in a row manages to eat through all your plants, there is one final line of defense.  A lawnmower sits in each row, and will activate and mow over any zombie in that particular row.  That can save the day for you once; but after it is used in a level that row is completely unguarded, and more zombies may arrive.  If the lawnmower is missing and the zombies get through again, it's game over.\r NOTE: Lawnmowers do not work on water or roofs without purchasing special abilities. \n"}, {"text": "A special console version of the game was created after the tremendous success of \"Plants Vs. Zombies\".  On some versions, two games were added in addition to \"Plants Vs. Zombies\".  Which of these games has a unicorn character in it?", "correct": "\"Peggle\"", "options": ["\"Zuma\"", "Both of these have a unicorn character", "Neither of these have a unicorn, but one has a quadricorn"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Peggle\".\n\n\t\"Peggle\" and \"Zuma\" were both games released on the same disk in special versions of \"Plants Vs. Zombies\".  \"Peggle\" is similar to \"Plinko\" from \"Price is Right\" and the old Atari block game.  The object is to hit all the orange pegs in a level before losing your ten balls (which act as \"lives\").  \"Zuma\" is like a bubble popper game, but instead of all the bubbles at the top, they circle you in crazy patterns.  You have to keep them away from the end of the line for long enough or the game is over. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these pea-shooting plants can you place an upgrade on it to transform it into a Gatling Pea?", "correct": "Repeater", "options": ["Threepeater", "Split pea", "Peashooter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRepeater.\n\n\tThe peashooter is a plant that shoots one pea at a time.  The repeater shoots two peas at a time.  The threepeater shoots three peas; in three different lanes.  The split pea shoots forward and back, which is great if a zombie has made it a bit too far and cannot be attacked anymore.\r The Gatling Pea cannot be added to a regular peashooter or even a threepeater.  It is added to a repeater and transforms it into the Gatling Pea, which shoots four peas at once, in the same lane, instead of the usual two of the repeater. \n"}, {"text": "There is a zombie that has a pole vault.  What does he do with the pole?", "correct": "Uses it to leap over the first plant he encounters", "options": ["He uses it as a sort-of lightsaber-like thing, deflecting shots until the pole takes enough damage", "Stabs plants with it for an instant kill", "He throws it at the furthest plant, destroying it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUses it to leap over the first plant he encounters.\n\n\tThe pole vaulting zombie jumps over the first plant he encounters.  There are exceptions to this, however.  For instance, he cannot leap over a tall-nut, as it is simply too high off the ground.  He can leap over the regular wall-nut, though.  This can make things tricky; he can jump over the wall-nut and attack plants behind it.  There is also a water-vaulting zombie that rides a dolphin that also jumps over the first plant he encounters.  He's also extremely fast.\r My advice: when you see or hear a vaulting zombie approaching, plant a cheap plant IN FRONT of a wall-nut or other defense-type plant.  That way the zombie jumps over the plant but gets stuck at the wall-nut. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these plants is strictly a nighttime plant?", "correct": "Sun-shroom", "options": ["Flowerpot", "Sunflower", "Snow pea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSun-shroom.\n\n\tSun-shrooms, as well as all other mushroom-type plants, sleep during the day.  This means they will not be of any use to you during the day, but don't worry; before starting a level it will black out the plants you cannot use so you do not accidentally get stuck with unusable plants!\r Sunflowers do grow during the night, but they will produce sun extremely slowly.  Sun-shrooms are extremely important in night levels, because sunflowers alone will not produce enough sun for you to use to fend off the zombies.\r Flowerpots only work on rooftops, and the snow pea works in both the daytime and the nighttime. \n"}, {"text": "There is a special dancing zombie that \"resurrects\" back-up dancers and they all dance their way to your house.  Who did this zombie originally resemble?", "correct": "Michael Jackson", "options": ["Usher", "Elvis Presley", "Shakira"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Jackson.\n\n\tThe original dancing zombie closely resembled Michael Jackson; he did the dance from \"Thriller\" and even grabbed himself every now and then.  He moonwalked to get closer to the house as well.  However, upon Michael Jackson's death, it was decided that it would be unbecoming to have a zombie version of Jackson.  So it was replaced with a simple disco zombie. \n"}, {"text": "Who can you purchase plant upgrades and other cool stuff from?", "correct": "Crazy Dave", "options": ["P. Daz", "Lucky Liza", "Deputy Gary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrazy Dave.\n\n\tCrazy Dave sells things because he's crazy!  You can buy things such as a rake, extra seed slots, and upgrades for some plants.  If you were to purchase all of his plant upgrades, you would spend around 100,000 dollars, so save up for Crazy Dave's shop! \n"}, {"text": "Oh no!  The zombies have gotten through all of your defenses in a column and enter your house.  What happens now?", "correct": "They eat your brains; game over", "options": ["Nothing", "They steal all your food; game over", "You win the game!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey eat your brains; game over.\n\n\tIf a zombie (or more than one zombie, for that matter) gets past all your plants and through the lawnmowers, they eat your brains.  The game is over, but you can start back up from that level.  When they enter the house, you can even hear a sound of them munching on your brains (who knew brains were so crunchy?) \n"}, {"text": "Who is the final boss of the game?", "correct": "Dr. Zomboss", "options": ["Zombie King", "Bossbie", "Zomb-bomb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Zomboss\n\n\tZomboss is a tough boss, because he has much higher hit points than any other zombie.  A regular zombie, for instance, has 15 hit points.  Zomboss has over 20,000.  However, if you play it right, and use the correct plants, he can be fairly easy (well, not EASY, but easier than without the right plants).\r Good luck fighting him. \n"}]}
