{"id": "234458", "name": "Test yourself! Take this Superman Returns Quiz | Superman", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Superman", "Superman Returns"], "questions": [{"text": "We are informed by a title card - after the opening credits conclude - that Superman (Brandon Routh) has been away from Earth for five years. Where on Earth did he make his titular return?", "correct": "His mother's farm", "options": ["None of these", "The Fortress of Solitude", "Downtown Metropolis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis mother's farm.\n\n\tKal-El's ship lands right outside the Kent farm in Smallville, Kansas. His adoptive mother, Martha (Eva Marie Saint), drives her truck to the crash site and brings her son back to the farmhouse where he grew up. \n"}, {"text": "Just before Superman officially returns to Earth, his adopted mother Martha Kent (Eva Marie Saint) bids good-night to a neighborhood friend. The two are apparently playing a board game. Which one?", "correct": "Scrabble", "options": ["Chess", "Checkers", "Parchessi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScrabble.\n\n\tAs Superman's ship approaches his mother's farm, everything in her home rattles and shakes, including a Scrabble board that has not been cleared off. \n"}, {"text": "The morning after his return to Earth, Clark Kent awakens in his childhood bedroom. His ceiling is decorated with stars. All of the stars are white, except for one. What color is this anomalous star?", "correct": "red", "options": ["green", "blue", "black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nred.\n\n\tThis is apparently a bit of an in-joke for the comic book fans who know that Krypton, Superman's home world, orbited a red star.  One has to wonder, though, how and why a single star on that ceiling would have been colored red when Clark was a child -- he didn't learn that he came from a world in a red star system until he was in his late teens.  Oh, well. \n"}, {"text": "Superman returns to Earth in a spacecraft made of the same kind of crystals that make up his Fortress of Solitude. It crash-lands near the Kent farm. Clark later assures his mother that the spacecraft has been disposed of. What happens to it?", "correct": "He buries it.", "options": ["He returns it to the Fortress of Solitude.", "He vaporizes it with his heat vision.", "He sends it into the sun."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe buries it.\n\n\tI can't for the life of me imagine why Clark would bury the spacecraft, rather than disposing of it in any of the other manners I've suggested. If you bury something, someone can discover it someday. I'm just saying. \n"}, {"text": "How is Lois Lane's fianc\u00e9 Richard (James Marsden) related to Perry White (Frank Langella), editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet?", "correct": "He is Perry's nephew.", "options": ["He is Perry's cousin.", "He isn't.", "He is Perry's son."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is Perry's nephew.\n\n\tRichard certainly seemed like a nice guy, but I saw no reason why it was important for him to be Perry's nephew. \n"}, {"text": "Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) takes Clark Kent to a bar, where Clark (surprisingly) imbibes alcohol. What does he drink?", "correct": "beer", "options": ["whiskey", "tequila", "wine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbeer.\n\n\tJack Larson, who plays the bartender in this scene, played Jimmy Olsen in \"The Adventures of Superman\" in the 1950s.  There's a mildly touching moment when, after Superman saves Metropolis, Larson's character and Huntington's character share a celebratory embrace. Jimmy, meet Jimmy! \n"}, {"text": "Certain characters from the Superman mythos are known for speaking \"signature\" lines of dialogue. Which one do we hear in \"Superman Returns\"?", "correct": "\"Great Caesar's ghost!\" [Perry White]", "options": ["\"Jeepers, Mister Kent!\" [Jimmy Olsen]", "\"Land sakes, Clark!\" [Martha Kent]", "\"Great Rao!\" [Superman]"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Great Caesar's ghost!\" [Perry White].\n\n\tPerry (Frank Langella), Clark's boss at the \"Daily Planet\", finally gets to say the line for which his character, in the comic books, has always been famous. Neither Jackie Cooper (from the first four Superman films) nor Lane Smith (from the \"Lois and Clark\" TV show) ever got the chance to throw out that particular exclamation. \n"}, {"text": "Superman saves a space shuttle crew just before saving the life of Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). What is the name of the shuttle?", "correct": "Genesis", "options": ["Peregrine", "Victory", "Apogee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenesis.\n\n\tThe out-of-control shuttle is attached to the 747 carrying Lois Lane, until Superman separates the two craft with his heat vision. \n"}, {"text": "Diabolical genius Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), Superman's arch-nemesis, spends much of the film aboard a magnificent yacht. What is its name?", "correct": "Gertrude", "options": ["Agatha", "Millicent", "Hildegarde"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGertrude.\n\n\tThe yacht is presumably named for Gertrude Vanderworth, the elderly multi-millionaire whom Lex married, and from whom he inherited great wealth after her death. Gertrude is played by Noel Neill, who also played Lois Lane in the \"Adventures of Superman\" television series. \n"}, {"text": "After she has been kidnapped, Lois Lane sends an SOS in the form of a fax from Luthor's boat. Who, at the \"Daily Planet\", recognizes the handwriting as Lois'?", "correct": "Jimmy", "options": ["Richard", "Clark", "Perry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJimmy.\n\n\tJimmy brings the fax over to Clark and Richard, saying that he would recognize Lois' handwriting anywhere. The message contains the coordinates of Lois' present position. \n"}, {"text": "Luthor's main henchman Brutus (Dave Fabrizio) is killed by use of an unusual object. An encounter with which object causes his death?", "correct": "a piano", "options": ["a fax machine", "a pen", "a sculpture"], "explanation": "\n\n\na piano.\n\n\tLois' son Jason shoves a piano across the room and fatally crushes Brutus. This is the moment in the film where the audience is given positive proof -- by way of the utilization of superhuman strength -- that Superman is Jason's father, so the less said about that, the better. \n"}, {"text": "Superman never punches a single person in this film.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tGiven Superman's phenomenal strength, he would likely kill an ordinary human with a single swing. Even when he's \"de-powered\" on Luthor's island, he never gets a chance to strike back at any of the men beating him.  Poor guy. \n"}, {"text": "Who kisses Superman while he is in a coma at the hospital?", "correct": "both", "options": ["Lois' son, Jason", "Lois", "neither"], "explanation": "\n\n\nboth.\n\n\tLois whispers the truth about Jason's parentage in Superman's ear, then kisses him. Jason, before leaving with his mother, trots back to the hospital bed and kisses his father (though it's doubtful he knows that's who he is!) on the forehead. \n"}, {"text": "According to the closing credits, what is the last name of Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu), Lois Lane's son?", "correct": "White", "options": ["Lane", "Mann", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite.\n\n\tOkay, let's see if I have this right. Jason is the result of the brief love affair that Lois had with (a de-powered) Superman in the film \"Superman II\". Just after the end of that film, Superman leaves to look for Krypton. (I say \"just after\" since Clark Kent seems shocked that Lois is a mother; hence, he must never have seen her pregnant.) \r Five years later, Lois has a son who looks more like a six-year-old than a four-year-old, but...okay. Lois is engaged to marry Richard White, but she's clearly been pushing off the actual wedding. The boy calls Richard \"Daddy\", and the three live together.\r How in the world is Jason's last name \"White\" if Lois and Richard aren't married yet? Did Richard adopt the boy?\r This is all very confusing. \n"}, {"text": "According to the closing credits, to whom is this film dedicated?", "correct": "both", "options": ["Dana Reeve", "Christopher Reeve", "neither"], "explanation": "\n\n\nboth.\n\n\tChristopher Reeve played Superman in the 1978 Richard Donner film, as well as its three (inferior) sequels. He died on 12 October 2004. His wife, Dana, died of lung cancer on 6 March 2006. \n"}]}
