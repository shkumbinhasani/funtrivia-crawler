{"id": "130399", "name": "Double sound words are fun. Come \"can-can\" with me Online Quiz | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "English", "Vocabulary"], "questions": [{"text": "What is \"beriberi\"?", "correct": "A tropical disease caused by vitamin B deficiency", "options": ["A dialect of the Bantu language", "A member of an African tribe.", "A shrub with bright red berries"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA tropical disease caused by vitamin B deficiency.\n\n\tNot a very pleasant word to start us off. A shrub with bright red berries might be \"berberis\" which doesn't come too far away in the dictionary. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is a meaning of the word \"willy-nilly\"?", "correct": "whether we want to or not", "options": ["as slowly as possible", "nobody objects to the decision that is taken", "the last person to arrive makes the decision"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwhether we want to or not.\n\n\tThis is believed to have derived from the words in the phrase \"will he\" or \"not will he\". So in one way it cuts the phrase down whilst making use of the double sound. (\"Willy-nilly\" can also mean haphazard or arbitrary.) \n"}, {"text": "Give one meaning of the expression \"mumbo jumbo\"", "correct": "meaningless or unnecessarily complicated language", "options": ["the noise made by a large aircraft", "the noise made by an elephant's hoofs", "background noise heard in lifts and elevators"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmeaningless or unnecessarily complicated language.\n\n\tAnother meaning that dictionaries often give alongside the correct one above is \"foolish religious reverence or incantation\". It backs up the point of this quiz - a lot of us are in love with the sound of words even when we give them a contemptuous meaning. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is actually the name of a musical instrument?", "correct": "tom tom", "options": ["bill bill", "john john", "ron ron"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntom tom.\n\n\tThe dictionary tells us that a \"tom tom\" or \"tam tam\" is a drum associated with Native Americans or with the peoples of Asia. \n"}, {"text": "A \"pompom\" has many meanings. One is a tuft of ribbon, wool or feather decorating a hat. What is another?", "correct": "A rapid fire gun fitted to naval vessels of World War Two.", "options": ["A special barrel used to keep apples.", "One of the leather sections of a saddle.", "A special type of liquorice."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA rapid fire gun fitted to naval vessels of World War Two.\n\n\tThe name of the gun probably came from the sound it made when fired. The French for apple is \"pomme\" but this has nothing to do with that. The \"pommel\" is part of a saddle and a \"Pomfret\" cake is a special sort of liquorice sweet. Pom Pom guns, however, did not usually fire \"Ack-ack\". \n"}, {"text": "From the Greek we have the word \"hoi polloi\" but what does it mean?", "correct": "The common people or the masses", "options": ["The very top people in society", "The religious leaders of the community", "The foreigners who live in one's country"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe common people or the masses.\n\n\tThe Greek words mean \"the many\" or \"the majority\".  This is always used as a term of contempt and shows the versatility of \"double sound\" words which can have their origins in Classical languages or the language of remote tribes. They can be as old as the Greek civilization or as modern as a \"poop scoop\" or \"pooper scooper\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following means \"arrogant and haughty\"?", "correct": "hoity toity", "options": ["lardy dardy", "hushy pushy", "uppy puppy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhoity toity.\n\n\tThere also the version \"hoi-ti-toi\", rather like \"la-di-da\" or \"lah-di-dah\" (but not \"lar-di-dar\") which means affecting exaggeratedly genteel manners or speech. People who are \"hoity-toity\" tend to think of themselves as the \"bees-knees\". \n"}, {"text": "Can you find the double sound word which means \"trickery or mystifying jargon\"?", "correct": "hocus pocus", "options": ["hector-lector", "heeby-jeeby", "hodge-podge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhocus pocus.\n\n\tYou can see how someone using \"hocus-pocus\" might spout \"mumbo-jumbo\" and end up giving you the \"heeby-jeebies\" (upsetting and frightening feelings). A \"hodge-podge\", on the other hand, is just a mixture of things. A \"hector-lector\" does not exist. \n"}, {"text": "Another name for a lot of \"trickery and nonsense\" is which of the following?", "correct": "jiggery-pokery", "options": ["hennery-pennery", "higgledy-piggledy", "huggery-muggery"], "explanation": "\n\n\njiggery-pokery.\n\n\tTo leave things \"higgledy-piggledy\" means to leave them in total disorder. There is an expression \"hugger-mugger\" which is used in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" but the expression \"huggery-muggery\"does not really exist. \"Hennery-penny\" certainly doesn't. \n"}, {"text": "What is the meaning of \"willy-willy\"?", "correct": "A stormy wind in Australia.", "options": ["A flowering shrub of the acacia family.", "A waterhole in Australia.", "The ocean current off New Zealand."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA stormy wind in Australia.\n\n\tIt also is sometimes spelled \"willie-willie\". I wonder if they ever get \"willy-willies\" in Wagga Wagga. They certainly wouldn't have them in Baden-Baden. \n"}]}
