Trivia Game | Geography | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Names, Maps and Borders", "Borders"], "questions": [{"text": "The Republic of Ireland is divided into four provinces and twenty-six counties.  Which is the southernmost of the counties?", "correct": "Cork", "options": ["Galway", "Tipperary", "Wexford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCork.\n\n\tCounty Cork lies in Munster Province at the southermost tip of Ireland.  To see the southernmost point of land in Ireland, you must go to Mizen Head, where the cliffs reach 700 feet in height.  Just south of Mizen Head is Fastnet Rock, upon which lies a lighthouse that the Irish call the 'Teardrop of Ireland' because it was the last thing many Irish emigrants saw as they made their long journey west to America. \n"}, {"text": "Khorasan is the largest province in area of which Middle Eastern country?  ", "correct": "Iran", "options": ["Iraq", "Saudi Arabia", "Turkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIran.\n\n\tKhorasan province lies in the eastern region of Iran, and borders on both Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.  Its area in square miles is 116,976, and in square kilometers 302,966.  It's nearly twice the size of the second largest province, namely Sistan & Baluchestan.  Khorasan is also the second most highly populated province in Iran, just behind Tehran (one of the smallest provinces.) \n"}, {"text": "One of the provinces of this country is Formosa, the former name of Taiwan.  Others include Chaco, Rio Negro and La Pampa.  To which South American country am I referring?", "correct": "Argentina", "options": ["Brazil", "Chile", "Peru"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArgentina.\n\n\tChaco and La Pampa are both named for great plains in the nothern portion of Argentina.  Rio Negro is, of course, named for the Negro (Black) River that flows just north of Patagonia.  Formosa is a word derived from Latin that means 'beautiful'. \n"}, {"text": "Which country is divided into 43 'ken' (prefectures), 2 'fu', 1 'do' and 1 'to'?", "correct": "Japan", "options": ["China", "Korea", "Vietnam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\tDuring the imperial era, Japan was divided into regions called 'Daimyo'.  After the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century, the country was divided into subsections, most of which are called 'ken' (or 'prefectures' in English).  The two 'fu' are Osaka and Kyoto, while Tokyo is the only 'to'.  The largest sub-section of Japan is Hokkaido, the 'do' meaning 'island'. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a question for my friends up north.  Which province (key word: province!) of Canada is the northernmost?", "correct": "Quebec", "options": ["Northwest Territories", "Newfoundland", "Yukon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuebec.\n\n\tI hope you paid attention to my hint!  Yukon and the Northwest Territories are not designated as provinces, but rather are territories.  Of the ten provinces, Quebec contains by far the most northerly point, at Cape Wolstenholme.  The southernmost point in Canada is at Pt. Pelee in Ontario. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: Australia has no landlocked states or territories.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAs a matter of fact, Australia contains one very small territory, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), that is completely surrounded by New South Wales.  The ACT contains Canberra, the Australian capital, and was founded in 1913 by an act of parliament.  It seems that the good people of Melbourne and Sydney couldn't decide between them which town should be capital, so they agreed to meet in the middle.  Note: Jervis Bay, which is administered from the ACT, is considered to be an autonomous territory, despite control from the capital...much like a naval base in the United States. \n"}, {"text": "Which country has provinces whose names translate as 'north of the river', 'south of the river', 'north of the lake' and 'south of the lake'?", "correct": "China", "options": ["Brazil", "India", "Russia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChina.\n\n\tThe provinces referred to are: Hebei (north of the river), Henan (south of the river), Hubei (north of the lake) and Hunan (south of the lake).  The 'river' in question is the Huang He (Yellow River), while the lake is called Dongting Hu ('hu' meaning 'lake').  Hunan is best known for its very spicy food, and as the birthplace of a certain guy named Mao... \n"}, {"text": "One European country is divided into regions called cantons.  Examples of these cantons are Neuch\u00e2tel, Graub\u00fcnden and Zug.  Which country am I describing?", "correct": "Switzerland", "options": ["Hungary", "Germany", "Austria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwitzerland.\n\n\tSwitzerland is divided into 23 cantons, and 3 half-cantons.  Graub\u00fcnden is the largest of the cantons, while Zug is the second smallest, only exceeding Baselstadt in size.  Each Canton has a local name, based on the primary language of the region, but also has names derived from each of the four major languages of Switzerland.  I recommend having a look at the war flags of each Canton, quite interesting! \n"}, {"text": "Here's one for the U.S. residents taking this quiz.  The United States is obviously divided up into states, and most states are sub-divided into counties.  However, one state is divided up into 'parishes', but which? ", "correct": "Louisiana", "options": ["Maine", "Utah", "Alaska"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLouisiana.\n\n\tLouisiana is made up of 64 parishes, some with wonderful names like Laeourche, Terrebonne, Plaquemines and Natchitoches.

Violent insurgencies in these areas have occurred in the past decade as members of the Muslim populations have attempted to 'break away' from Russian control.  Speaking of 'breaking away', we have come to the end of the quiz.  Thank you for playing...I hope you enjoyed it and learned a bit. \n"}]}
