{"id": "317560", "name": "\"Glee\" - Pilot Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "What class does Mr. Schuester teach?", "correct": "Spanish", "options": ["French", "German", "English"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpanish.\n\n\tWilliam McKinley High School opens with the standards; the cheerleading squad (a national leader) practices a new routine as their coach, Sue Sylvester, harasses the performers from the sidelines, one of the more flamboyant students, Kurt, is thrown into a dumpster by the football team, and the school's Spanish teacher, Mr. Schuester, thinks about restarting the high school's glee club having been a part of the national championship team during his senior year.\rIn the teacher's lounge, Will and the phys ed teacher, Ken Tanaka, talk about the budget cut-backs resulting in their loss of a coffee machine before Sue arrives with lattes for everyone.  She explains that she felt bad about the budget cut though in reality the money saved from the loss of the coffee machine went to her cheerleading squad, the Cheerios, and their nutritionist. \n"}, {"text": "When Will puts up the sign-up sheet for 'New Directions', some kids sign up immediately.  What song does Mercedes sing for her audition?", "correct": "\"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\" by Aretha Franklin", "options": ["\"I Kissed a Girl\" by Katy Perry", "\"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\"", "\"Mr. Cellophane\" from \"Chicago\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\" by Aretha Franklin.\n\n\tAs Sue departs, Will and Ken sit down with the school's guidance counselor, Emma Pillsbury, who lets them know that Sandy Ryerson, the Glee Club teacher, was fired.  Will decides to talk to Principal Figgins who, hesitant to let Glee Club survive due to budget cut-backs, says that he needs $60/month to keep the club alive and they need to use the costumes they already have.\rWill puts up a sign-up sheet the next day and some of the kids already decide to sign up.  Mercedes Jones is first to join and sings \"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\" by Aretha Franklin for her audition.  She is soon followed by Kurt Hummel, singing the \"Chicago\" Broadway song \"Mr. Cellophane\", the stuttering Tina Cohen-Chang who sings Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\", and wheelchair-bound Artie Abrams.  Then comes Rachel Berry... \n"}, {"text": "Rachel was the one responsible for getting Sandy Ryerson fired from the school.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tRachel signs her name on the 'New Directions' sign-up sheet and places a gold star sticker next to her name as a metaphor, and as she says, \"metaphors are important.\"  Although Rachel pictures herself as a star, she finds herself as the brunt of humiliation for the 'popular kids' in school.  Rachel was responsible for getting Sandy fired as she went to the principal to inform him that he had been inappropriately touching a student during his vocal practice. Many believe she actually did it because she wasn't given a particular solo, but she claims otherwise.  As she says, both of her dads are gay, so she was born out of love. She still doesn't know the real father as her mother was a surrogate selected from a rigorous screening process.  Her family trained her from a young age to be super-competitive.  Furthermore, her MySpace page has daily music videos.  Rachel sings her rendition of the song \"On My Own\" from \"Les Miserables\" for the 'New Directions' audition.  When she finishes, she immediately asks when the rehearsals are. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Will's wife (Terri) work?", "correct": "Sheets 'N Things", "options": ["Z-Mart", "Babys 'R We", "Young Drivers Training School"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheets 'N Things.\n\n\tAfter a rather uninspired version of \"Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat\" which Rachel claims is ironic because the kid in the wheelchair is singling the chorus, the group realizes that Glee Club may not quite be success.  Rachel storms out, frustrated with the circumstances.  Mr. Schuester finds her in the bleachers of the football field watching Sue Sylvester yell at her students with a megaphone.  Rachel says that she can't continue wasting her time if she doesn't have a proper male lead.  First though, Principal Figgins needs to speak with him about the club.  Since Alcoholics Anonymous is paying him $10 ahead for the gym, he's prepared to get rid of Glee.  Will offers to run detention to make it up and he guarantees that his club show as regionals.\rWill decides to go to Sheets 'N' Things to talk to his wife, Terri, about Glee Club.  She's less than thrilled that he's not getting paid for detention and thinks she can't pick up the slack since she already spends four hours a day, three days a week at work on her feet...especially since she's trying to get pregnant.  And after this, she has to go home and cook dinner for herself.  It's hard. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these people says that \"high school is a caste system\" and that \"Glee Club is the sub-basement\"?", "correct": "Sue", "options": ["Ken", "Emma", "Sandy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSue.\n\n\tAs Will begins to leave Sheets 'N' Things, he accidentally runs into Sandy Ryerson who says that he's glad to have left the tone-deaf kids behind at McKinley High.  Furthermore, his doctors put him on medical marijuana to relax due to the stress he took from leaving the job.  As a result, he now has too much of it and sells some for pocket change on the side (though it's later revealed that he's been selling it to Ken Tanaka at the school).  Sandy slides a packet (labeled 'Chronic Lady') into Will's breast pocket and returns to arguing with the store clerk.\rWill decides to speak to Sue Sylvester who, at the time, is busy cleaning her trophies.  He asks if he can ask her Cheerios to join in Glee Club on the side since they're performers.  Sue, outright, says no since Glee Club goes below everything else on the food chain.  They're the sub-basement level of high school society.  When he asks Emma, Will discovers that he simply needs to ask a couple of the popular kids to sign up and more will emerge.  He decides to ask Ken Tanaka's phys ed class. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the grass-painting service that Finn and his mother used to hire (inadvertently giving Finn a taste for rock music)?", "correct": "Emerald Dreams", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmerald Dreams.\n\n\tWill goes back to find that his plan to get football guys into Glee has failed.  As he decides to leave, he hears the team quarterback, Finn Hudson, singing REO Speedwagon's \"Can't Fight This Feeling Anymore\" in the shower.  He decides to act upon this and calls him into his office.  Despite his morals, Will tells Finn that he found the 'Chronic Lady' marijuana package in his locker in a random, biweekly locker check.  He threatens that Finn will lose any football scholarship he has (which he didn't know about) and he'll be forced to leave the school.\rFinn is worried about this.  He knows he didn't do any drugs, but his mother can't know about the situation anyways.  His father died in Iraq (when they were after Bin Laden the first time) and his mother raised him.  He remembers he got passionate about music when he and his mother splurged and ordered 'Emerald Dreams'.  Of course, this didn't last long; his mother caught the greasy Emerald Dreams guy driving by with another woman.\rWill offers an option to Finn, and that's what sends him to Glee Club. \n"}, {"text": "Finn makes an excuse to his friend, Puck, as to why he can't be at football often enough.  What does he say?", "correct": "He's helping his mother since she had surgery", "options": ["He's getting a job to pay for college", "He's moving down the street", "He's tutoring a kid in math after school"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's helping his mother since she had surgery.\n\n\tFinn's first rehearsal with Glee Club sees him and Rachel singing \"You're the One That I Want\" from \"Grease\" with the other four on background vocals.  As Rachel gets into the song with Finn, Mercedes breaks them up telling Mr. Schuester that she's more of a Beyonce and not a Kelly Rowland.  When they realize it was the first time that they were actually good, they take it from the top.\rAt home, Will and Terri finish a puzzle and talk about Glee.  Terri is angry with Will because he wants to bring Glee Club to a rival school's performance but she says she had to pick up an extra shift on Saturday since they're living paycheck-to-paycheck.  Will blames her Pottery Barn credit card but she refuses to hear it.  She thinks Will should become an accountant though he knows his dream is to teach.  Terri says that their high school days are over and he can't go back.  Will plans his field trip anyways.\rFinn, meanwhile, has to make up excuses to his friends about Glee Club.  He tells Puck that his mother had her prostate removed, so he's been at football less to help her out.  Puck doesn't question this. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Carmel High's Glee Club?", "correct": "Vocal Adrenaline", "options": ["Major Scales", "Tune Twisters", "The Sound of Fury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVocal Adrenaline.\n\n\tWill takes the six kids in Glee to Carmel High School with Emma to show them their competition for regionals.  Before heading in, Rachel and Finn have a conversation where they both commend each other for their talent.  Rachel says that everyone on the team must expect them to become an item, but Finn says that he's already in a relationship with Quinn Fabray, head cheerleader and leader of the celibacy club.  Meanwhile, Emma and Will talk about Will's dreams and the fact that he hates to be unable to accommodate for Terri.  They're soon ushered into the theater where Will tells them that Vocal Adrenaline will be the team for them to beat.  After the group's astounding rendition of Amy Winehouse's \"Rehab\", they're a bit stunned.\rFinn returns to the school and gets pelted on by paintballs.  Puck looked up prostate surgery on the internet and found out that women don't have them.  They punish him for 'breaking the rules'. \n"}, {"text": "Who does the football team lock into a porta-potty for Finn?", "correct": "Artie", "options": ["Kurt", "Tina", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArtie.\n\n\tWill heads home to find Terri inside with two glasses of champagne and a congratulations banner.  Will asks her what's to be celebrated and she reveals that she's pregnant.  He gives the news to Glee Club and tells them that he's leaving- he's giving his two weeks and taking the accounting job.  The group begs him to stay saying that they can work harder and beat the Carmel High group, but he says he has to do it for his family.  Emma, disappointed that he's leaving, books him in for guidance the following day.  He says that he'll come.\rRachel tells Finn that she's taking over Glee Club as Interim Director and that he shouldn't leave because he's better than the rest of the people in the school and shouldn't have to maintain his 'popular guy' reputation.  Later, Finn comes to the realization that he can't leave when he finds that the football team has locked Artie and his wheelchair into a porta-potty.  He helps Artie out and leaves the football guys behind to rejoin Glee, though he stays on the team to do both. \n"}, {"text": "What song do the six members of 'New Directions' sing together in the end of the episode?", "correct": "Don't Stop Believin'", "options": ["Somebody to Love", "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", "Any Way You Want It"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon't Stop Believin'.\n\n\tAs Finn brings Artie back to the auditorium, they pass by the football field to see the Emerald Dreams truck belting out a tune by Journey and the greasy guy spraying the grass green.  He gets an idea from this and rushes back to the others.  He tells Artie to bring out his guitar and talk to the jazz band, Mercedes to make up some costumes, and Rachel to do some choreography.  He'll bring the music.\rWill and Emma have one final chat before he's about to leave.  She shows him a video of his Glee Club team performing at nationals and he remembers it as the happiest moment of his life.  He heads out, but on his way he passes by the auditorium to find Glee Club rehearsing Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" inside.  As he watches on, Sue and her Cheerios watch from the catwalk above and Puck waits inside the doors.  After their performance, Will realizes that he can't leave- he needs to make sure that they go to nationals.  He tells them to do it one more time...from the top. \n"}]}
