{"id": "134007", "name": "Rhythm and 'Blues Brothers' Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", " The Blues Brothers"], "questions": [{"text": "During the opening scene of the film we see Joliet Jake Blues, played by John Belushi, leaving Joliet Prison after a three-year stay.  His brother Elwood, played by Dan Ackroyd, meets him at the prison gate.  After their warm embrace, we are greeted with the first song of the film.  Who performs this first song, called 'She Caught the Katy'?", "correct": "The Blues Brothers", "options": ["Muddy Waters", "Elmore James", "Fats Domino"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blues Brothers.\n\n\tNaturally, this is a film featuring the Blues Brothers, a band originally assembled by Belushi and Ackroyd for performances on 'Saturday Night Live', and it stands to reason that a song performed by 'the band' would open up the film!  Incidentally, the song 'She Caught the Katy' was composed by Memphis bluesman Yank Rachell.  What is the 'Katy', you ask?  It's the nickname of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad, abbreviated 'MKT' (Katy is the sounding out of the last two letters 'K-T'.) \n"}, {"text": "'The Blues Brothers' is filled with guest appearances from a number of the greatest performers of the 20th century.  Which of the following guests performs the first 'live' number in the film?", "correct": "James Brown", "options": ["Ray Charles", "Aretha Franklin", "Cab Calloway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Brown.\n\n\tOf course, we see Cab Calloway (who plays the character Curtis) first, just after the Blues Brothers come to visit the 'penguin', but he doesn't perform the first live tune (his song, 'Minnie the Moocher', comes just before the Blues Brothers big concert.)  They discover from Curtis and the penguin that the orphanage that they grew up in is going to be closed unless five thousand dollars can miraculously be acquired. Before undertaking their mission, they follow Curtis' advice and visit a church where Reverend Cleophus (played by James Brown) performs a rousing sermon.  You may not have noticed, but the female solo during the James Brown number was performed by none other than Chaka Khan! \n"}, {"text": "Which two songs from the 60s/70s blues performers Sam and Dave do we hear during the early part of the film? ", "correct": "'Soothe Me' and 'Hold On, I'm Comin'", "options": ["'Soul Man' and 'I Thank You'", "'Let it be Me' and 'When Something is Wrong with My Baby '", "'Rap it Up' and 'Love is After Me'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Soothe Me' and 'Hold On, I'm Comin'.\n\n\tPerhaps the best known song by Sam and Dave associated with the Blues Brothers was their hit 'Soul Man', which wasn't performed in the film, but was covered during an episode of 'Saturday Night Live'.  Incidentally, 'Soothe Me' was a cover by Sam and Dave of an original Sam Cooke song. \n"}, {"text": "How many television theme songs are included in the film 'The Blues Brothers'?", "correct": "2", "options": ["1", "4", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tThe two television theme songs are: the theme from 'Peter Gunn', an insrumental tune written by Henry Mancini (who won a grammy for his work) and the theme from the television show 'Rawhide', originally performed by Frankie Laine (who also performed the theme song to 'Blazing Saddles'!)  In the film, the Blues Brothers perform the second of the two theme songs. \n"}, {"text": "The Blues Brothers begin their search for their band members at a Holiday Inn, where they encounter five of the guys in a virtually empty lounge performing a rousing version of 'Cuando, Cuando, Cuando'.  After finishing up this tune, 'Murph' switches on a tape that features which song by Billy Joel?", "correct": "Just the Way You Are", "options": ["The Stranger", "Piano Man", "It's Still Rock N Roll to Me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJust the Way You Are.\n\n\tI realize that this is a rather obscure question, but I couldn't resist a mention of a) Murph and the Magic Tones, b) Murph's line 'Don't you go changin'' and c) 'Cuando, Cuando, Cuando'.  I think the Billy Joel tune is also a good reminder of the current state of music during the late 70s, early 80s when the film was created. (Note: I happen to like Billy Joel, but let's face it...the soulful music of rhythm and blues was pretty much dead during the late 70s disco/light rock ballad era!) \n"}, {"text": "Continuing on their mission to reassemble the band, the Blues Brothers head down to a ribs joint where they hope to find Matt 'Guitar' Murphy and Blue Lou.  On their way into the restaurant, the brothers stop to enjoy Street Slim (played by blues legend John Lee Hooker), who performs which of these songs live?", "correct": "Boom Boom", "options": ["Boogie Chillun'", "Shake Your Moneymaker", "I'm Walkin'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoom Boom.\n\n\tJohn Lee Hooker, who passed away in 2001, performs his song 'Boom Boom' for a crowd on Maxwell Street.  Another Hooker tune, 'Boogie Chillun', does appear on the soundtrack, but it is not performed live.  This song can be heard while the band is on the road to 'Bob's Country Bunker'. \n"}, {"text": "Aretha Franklin performs her song 'Respect' in 'The Blues Brothers'.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAretha Franklin plays the wife of Matt 'Guitar' Murphy, and owner of the 'Soul Food Cafe' on Maxwell Street.  She gives Murphy something to consider when she performs the song 'Think' in the cafe.  After a very short amount of consideration, Murphy decides to leave his wife for the band...and Blue Lou comes with him! \n"}, {"text": "The Blues Brothers next must acquire some new instruments for their band, and do so at Ray's Music Exchange.  Skeptical about Ray's instruments, the Blues Brothers question whether or not to make a purchase.  Ray (played by Ray Charles) convinces the band to make a purchase after magnificently performing which song?", "correct": "Shake Your Tailfeather", "options": ["Let the Good Times Roll", "I Got News For You", "What'd I Say"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShake Your Tailfeather.\n\n\tThe song 'Let the Good Times Roll' is actually featured on the soundtrack, but earlier on when the Blues Brothers prepare to sleep in Elwood's apartment.  Oh yes, and it's performed by Louis Jordan, not Ray Charles (though Charles did once cover the song!) By the way, John Belushi did a fantastic rendition of the Ray Charles song 'What'd I Say' dressed as a cross between Ray Charles and Beethoven on 'Saturday Night Live'. \n"}, {"text": "During the over-the-top car chase scene that leads the Blues Brothers into the heart of Chicago, they are chased by 'Illinois Nazis'.  Which classical music song is featured during the hilarious chase?", "correct": "Ride of the Valkyries", "options": ["'Mars' (of Holst's 'The Planets')", "Night on Bald Mountain", "In the Hall of the Mountain King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRide of the Valkyries.\n\n\tWagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries' is of course, the natural selection for such a scene, I would imagine.  As actor Henry Gibson, who played the leader of the Illinois Nazis, pointed out, the car chase scenes are accompanied by music because 'those cars were dancing'. \n"}, {"text": "In total, how many *complete* songs (with lyrics) are performed by the Blues Brothers live on stage during the film? (Be careful with this one...)", "correct": "5", "options": ["9", "7", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n5.\n\n\tThe complete songs include: the main theme from 'Rawhide', 'Stand By Your Man' (both in Bob's Country Bunker), 'Everybody Needs Somebody to Love', 'Sweet Home Chicago' (both at the Palace Hotel ballroom) and 'Jailhouse Rock' (in prison at the end of the film.)  The Blues Brothers attempt to perform 'Gimme Some Lovin'' at Bob's Country Bunker, but the plug is pulled before they complete the song.  Sorry about the tricky question...but it had to be done!  I hope you enjoyed the quiz...please give some of my other quizzes a try if you happened to like it. \n"}]}
