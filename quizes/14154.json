In many areas, it's illegal to sell puppies before they are eight weeks old. \n"}, {"text": "Dogs who are just household pets don't need obedience training.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tObedience-trained dogs can really be your companions! My dogs have gone on airplanes, in stores, to schools and hospitals, and on vacation. Untrained dogs can't share these experiences. \n"}, {"text": "The best way to get your dog trained is to have someone else do it.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNope.
