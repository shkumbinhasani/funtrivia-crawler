Female water striders have developed spikes on their backs to dislodge males attempting to mate with them.  If you were a male water strider, what would you have to overcome this?", "correct": "Claspers to hold onto the female", "options": ["Good aim", "The ability to mate within 0.25 seconds", "A hole in your chest to accommodate the spike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClaspers to hold onto the female.\n\n\tDifferent species of water strider females have different sized spikes, basically the larger the male's \"claspers\", the larger the female's spikes. \n"}, {"text": "In many species males who mate with a female will block her genital opening with a hard plug, therefore preventing her from mating with another male.  If you were a bed bug this would not be a problem.  How does the male bed bug ensure he passes on his genes?", "correct": "Stabbing the female's body and injecting sperm", "options": ["Mating before the plug is set", "Secreting enzymes to dissolve the plug", "Special pinchers to remove the plug"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStabbing the female's body and injecting sperm.\n\n\tBeing stabbed by the male does not endanger the female's life, she has adapted so the sperm will work its way through her body to be stored and then used to fertilise her eggs.  In some species, the male will actually inject other males who then pass on their genes for them. \n"}, {"text": "It can be tiring chasing the girls around, sometimes you just want them to come to you.  The red velvet mite male releases his sperm onto twigs.  He then needs to entice a female to lay her eggs.  If you were a red velvet mite how would you tempt a female to do this?", "correct": "Lay a silk trail for her to follow", "options": ["Dance", "Sing", "Place pungent food at the end of the twig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLay a silk trail for her to follow.\n\n\tThis is easier said than done, a poorly made trail will not attract any mates as the female will only leave her eggs for a male that she finds artistically pleasing.  Also, if another male finds this trail, he will destroy the original's sperm and leave his own. \n"}, {"text": "Incest is not unheard of in the insect world.  If you were a straw itch mite male, who would you mate with?", "correct": "Your sister", "options": ["Your father", "Your mother", "Yourself"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYour sister.\n\n\tThe straw itch mite gives birth to up to 300 young at a time, and the males will immediately mate with their sisters after birth.  When your life span is only 1 week, there is little time to waste with courting! \n"}, {"text": "Females can be fussy when it comes to choosing who to share their genes with.  The female of many insects have a storage organ to keep sperm to be used as needed.  If you were a male Drosophila bifurca (a species of fruit fly) you would want to take up as much of this space as possible.  How would you accomplish this?", "correct": "By producing extra long sperm", "options": ["By mating for days at a time", "By producing a vast number of sperm", "By secreting fluid to fill the space"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy producing extra long sperm.\n\n\tMale fruit flies produce the longest sperm known to man, being up to 6cm in length, this is over 1000 times longer than a human sperm.  In order to accomplish this, his testes make up 11% of his body mass. \n"}, {"text": "There is no doubt about it, passing on your genes can be a risky business.

In about 65% of red back spider matings the male is consumed by the female.  Males that are not eaten die shortly afterwards anyway, so this is not much of a deterrent. \n"}, {"text": "Females like to be courted, and providing your chosen lady with a meal could give you an advantage.  The female sagebrush cricket has unusual cravings.  If you were a male sagebrush cricket which of these attributes would give you the best chance of meeting her desires?", "correct": "Being a virgin", "options": ["Being older", "Being larger", "Being smaller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeing a virgin.\n\n\tMale sagebrush crickets have evolved an extra pair of wings for females to \"nibble\" on whilst mating.  The females then proceed to drink the blood from these wounds.  This does not kill the males, but they do lose a portion of their wings with each mating, making them less attractive to other females. \n"}, {"text": "In the insect world, females are not always just looking for a good personality.  If you were a male stalk-eyed fly, what attribute would attract the largest number of females to you?", "correct": "Having eyes set further apart than your body is long", "options": ["Being able to perform intricate dances", "Being able to sing the loudest", "Being the largest male"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHaving eyes set further apart than your body is long.\n\n\tThere really is no accounting for taste.

If you were a male dragonfly, how would you protect your partner from other males?", "correct": "Hold onto her until she deposits her eggs", "options": ["Seal her in a tree until she deposits her eggs", "Kill any other males that come near her", "Mate frequently"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHold onto her until she deposits her eggs.\n\n\tThe last male dragonfly to mate with a female before she lays her eggs has the greatest chance of fathering her offspring.
