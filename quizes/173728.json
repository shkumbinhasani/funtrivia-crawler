{"id": "173728", "name": "Fractured American Idol 2004 Quiz | Fractured TV | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "TV Wordplay", "Fractured TV"], "questions": [{"text": "Jumpier lieu us?", "correct": "Jon Peter Lewis & John Peter Lewis & Jon Peter Louis & John Peter Louis", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJon Peter Lewis & John Peter Lewis & Jon Peter Louis & John Peter Louis.\n\n\tJon Peter's a cute Idaho \"pen salesman\"--Simon's name for him. He was America's choice among the wild card contestants and the fifth to be voted out of the competition. \n"}, {"text": "Fun daisy upper Reno?", "correct": "Fantasia Barrino & Fantasia", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFantasia Barrino & Fantasia.\n\n\tFantasia's from North Carolina. She has big lips and a big, beautiful, soulful voice. In my opinion, she's definitely one of the two best singers (with La Toya London). \"America\" chose her for their American Idol 2004! Congratulations, Fantasia! \n"}, {"text": "Juniper huts sin?", "correct": "Jennifer Hudson", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJennifer Hudson.\n\n\tA former cruise line singer from Chicago, Jennifer was Randy Jackson's pick in the wild card competition. In my opinion, she is one of the better singers. When she was voted off the show--the sixth to go--I was shocked and dismayed. LaToya and Fantasia joined Jennifer in the bottom three--and these, in my opinion, are among the 4 best singers in the competition! I think this happened because young teens vote for their peers (John, Jasmine, and Diana) and press redial a million times. Jennifer's later success in \"Dream Girls\" vindicates my opinion. \n"}, {"text": "Gorge hoof?", "correct": "George Huff", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Huff.\n\n\tGeorge Huff of Louisiana is a tall, soulful singer who reminded judge Randy Jackson of a deacon at his church in the South. Simon picked him from among the wild card competitors. Sadly, he was the eighth to go. He was in my top three, but in the end I decided he wasn't as talented as La Toya or Fantasia. He sure seems like a lovely guy, though. \n"}, {"text": "Myth you raw jurors?", "correct": "Matthew Rogers & Matthew Rodgers", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatthew Rogers & Matthew Rodgers.\n\n\tA former football star from the University of Washington Huskies, Matt is from Southern California. He sings like a rocker rather than a crooner. He was the second to go. His farewell song was very funny and classy: he addressed his country lovesong to Simon! \n"}, {"text": "Jazzmen triage?", "correct": "Jasmine Trias & Jasmin Trias", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJasmine Trias & Jasmin Trias.\n\n\tPretty Jasmine is one of two top-12 contestants from Hawaii. She's the one who always wore a tropical flower in her hair. She was the tenth to go. In my opinion, she is not as good a singer as George, Jennifer, or La Toya. \n"}, {"text": "Runty Jacques sun?", "correct": "Randy Jackson", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRandy Jackson.\n\n\tActually, he's not runty at all, though he lost a lot of weight between AI 2003 and 2004. He's the cool judge. His favorite words: \"ight\" and \"dog,\" as in \"I was feelin' you, dog.\" \n"}, {"text": "Laud oy yeah lawn dawn?", "correct": "LaToya London & La Toya London", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaToya London & La Toya London.\n\n\tCool, calm, and collected La Toya hails from Oakland, California--hurray for the Bay Area! She's got a quiet grace (but her voice is POWERFUL). When she was voted into the bottom three with Amy and Jennifer, and then again with Fantasia and Jennifer, I was absolutely furious! In my opinion, she is the one of the top 2 best singers in the competition.Towards the end of the competition, I was convinced that she should win the American Idol title. When she was the ninth to go, I was SO amazed and angry. To me, this meant that the voting rules need revamping somehow. She should have been the winner, or at least the first runner-up. \n"}, {"text": "Pole lob dual?", "correct": "Paula Abdul", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaula Abdul.\n\n\tThe lovely Paula is the kind, motherly judge. She makes insightful comments about choreography, clothing, and performance style (as well as singing, of course). \n"}, {"text": "Hey me autumns?", "correct": "Amy Adams & Amy Addams", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmy Adams & Amy Addams.\n\n\tThe fushia-haired Amy is a make-up artist from Bakersfield, California. She's friendly and witty. Classy Amy was the third to be dropped from the competition (in my opinion, it should have been John Stevens, who did a terrible job on \"Mo-Town Night\"). \n"}, {"text": "Leigh awe law bill?", "correct": "Leah LaBelle & Leah La Belle & Leah Labell & Leah La Bell", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeah LaBelle & Leah La Belle & Leah Labell & Leah La Bell.\n\n\tPretty, sassy Leah comes from Seattle. Her heritage is Bulgarian and her parents were singing stars who defected to the U.S. She was Paula's pick in the wild card competition. Leah was the first to be voted off the top 12. \n"}, {"text": "Dye yam Audi car mow?", "correct": "Diana Degarmo & Diana Digarmo & Diana De Garmo & Diana Di Garmo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiana Degarmo & Diana Digarmo & Diana De Garmo & Diana Di Garmo.\n\n\tDiana is a Georgia peach. Among the teens in the competition, she's the best performer, in my opinion. And she made it to the top two. I think La Toya should have had her spot, but she does seem like a very nice girl. A player informs me that Simon Cowell predicted that Diana DeGarmo would win AI. However, she came in second. I think Diana was the most improved singer in the competition. \n"}, {"text": "Come meal vole lasso?", "correct": "Camile Velasco & Camille Velasco", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCamile Velasco & Camille Velasco.\n\n\tShe's the other Hawaiian--just as lovely as Jasmine. She was the fourth to go. I love Camile's voice, and she's very pretty. She's shy, though, and had some trouble with her performances. \n"}, {"text": "Sigh moan growl?", "correct": "Simon Cowell & Simon Cowel", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSimon Cowell & Simon Cowel.\n\n\tI wouldn't recognize him if he weren't wearing a black T-shirt. His favorite words: \"ghastly,\" \"dreadful,\" and \"horrible.\" But I have to admit that much of the time he's correct (though unnecessarily mean). \n"}, {"text": "Yawn steep fans?", "correct": "John Stevens & John Stephens", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Stevens & John Stephens.\n\n\tYoung redheaded John from New York does an impeccable Frank Sinatra imitation. By the time Jennifer Hudson was bumped, though, some viewers (I was among them) felt that John no longer deserved to remain--not that he doesn't seem sweet and talented, of course. And I loved the way he sang \"King of the Road\" and \"Mandy.\" It turned out that he was the seventh to be voted off the show, right after Jennifer Hudson. During that week, though, he apparently received death threats! Some people, it seems, take this show WAY too seriously!\r By the way, I'm willing to add other players' opinions to the \"interesting info\" boxes, if you'd like to send some in. \n"}]}
