{"id": "320423", "name": "\"The Rhodes Not Taken\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "In the opening of the episode, the Glee Club sings \"Don't Stop Believin'\" without Rachel.  Who sings her lines?", "correct": "Quinn", "options": ["Mercedes", "Tina", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn.\n\n\tThe episode opens with the club struggling to make ends meet after having lost Rachel to Sandy and Sue's production of \"Cabaret\".  During their rehearsal, Quinn rushes out of the room to throw up and Finn covers for her.  As soon as she leaves, Kurt brings up Rachel and everyone agrees that they'd need a miracle to win without her.\rLater that day, Will and Terri go out for a meal and Will mentions the morning sickness, stating that he's never seen Terri get sick.  She claims that she throws up plenty at work when he's not around and orders another slice of Grasshopper Pie from their waiter.  Will recognizes the waiter from his Spanish class five years earlier though and discovers that he's actually been going to Carmel High School as a six year senior.  They keep failing him to be a consistent member of Vocal Adrenaline, a rival Glee Club. \n"}, {"text": "According to her file, how many credits did April Rhodes need to graduate?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Seven", "Eleven", "Twenty-six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tEmma sits Finn down for a talk in her office to reassure him that everything is okay (without letting it slip that Will told her about the baby).  She lets him know that sticking with Glee Club may result in a scholarship and that life can throw a lot at one person in an instant.  In addition, he is reassured that New Directions can still win without Rachel (something she told Will otherwise the previous day).  She suggests Finn give Rachel a talk.\rRachel, meanwhile, is being interviewed by the school newspaper for her role in \"Cabaret\".  Shortly into the questions, the reporter asks her to show her bra to him in order to prevent a scathing online review, thus ending her career on high school stage.  He's stopped quickly by Sandy who comes in for his own interview.  Finn talks to Rachel soon after saying that he isn't trying to stop her from being in \"Cabaret\", but if she needs to talk, he's there.\rWill gets an idea from his lunch: he'll take on a former Glee Club member who never graduated to fill Rachel's spot.  He looks up April Rhodes, who was three credits shy of graduation, telling Emma that she was his first crush. \n"}, {"text": "What class does April join when she begins her short tenure at McKinley High?", "correct": "Spanish", "options": ["Chemistry", "Math", "Geography"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpanish.\n\n\tWill finds April's MySpace page and talks to her online about meeting up.  She tells him to go to 35 Bontempo Road between 2 and 3 in the afternoon (and to bring buffalo wings) and Will obliges despite Emma's protest.  April greets him at the door and invites him in for a box of wine but Will soon realizes that she's not as successful as she seems. It turns out she's been squatting in bank-owned properties.  The two of them drink on the curb outside the house instead and April talks about what went wrong after she dropped out of high school.  Will thinks her story is moving and he plans to sober her up, buy her some underwear, let her get her diploma, and have her join Glee Club. \n"}, {"text": "What song does April sing to persuade New Directions to allow her into the Glee Club?", "correct": "Maybe This Time", "options": ["Cabaret", "Perfectly Marvelous", "Tomorrow Belongs to Me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaybe This Time.\n\n\tAlthough Glee Club is hesitant to bring April on instead of Rachel, she proves them all wrong by performing \"Cabaret's\" \"Maybe This Time\" for them in B flat.  In the meantime, Rachel practices the exact same song for Sandy and Sue's production of the same musical.  The kids are blown away by her rendition of the song (Kurt is moved to tears) and she's let in for rehearsals. In Spanish class however, April finds it difficult to concentrate on the work given to her.  She blames the upholstery cleaner she sniffed in the nineties.  Will reminds her that she can't embarrass the kids as they're already nervous about her coming into the group and they have their own problems to deal with. She decides to take it upon herself to make friends with them- teaching Mercedes and Tina to steal, giving Kurt confidence through alcoholism, and showering with the football guys. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Finn take Rachel in order to relax?", "correct": "Bowling alley", "options": ["Fancy restaurant", "Mini golf course", "Beach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowling alley.\n\n\tRachel finds the \"Cabaret\" rehearsals frustrating.  She practices her songs, but Sandy makes it too difficult for her to actually make her performance shine.  She confides in Finn to rehearse lines but their conversation soon turns to Rachel returning to Glee.  She decides she can't and Finn notes that she's under a lot of stress.  They decide to go bowling, something Finn does before big football games to put himself at ease.  As Finn proposes this, Will and April enter the room to practice the parts of \"Don't Stop Believin'\" for her vocals.\rThe following day, Emma runs into Kurt in the school hallways.  Walking past him, she realizes that he's drunk.  He promptly throws up on her shoes and she goes to the ER for four decontamination showers.  She blames April. \n"}, {"text": "For their duet, April and Will sing a rendition of a song by \"Heart\".  What song is it?", "correct": "Alone", "options": ["Barracuda", "Crazy On You", "Dreamboat Annie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlone.\n\n\tRachel has another bad run-in with Sandy and finds herself crying in the bathroom.  Here, she runs into April who claims that now that she has the fame she once lost, she's never letting go of it, even if it brings other people down.\rLater that day, Rachel and Finn go bowling and while she has a hard time getting the hang of it, the two of them bond.  Down the alley at a different lane, Will and April play another game.  Will decides to tell April (who says she's on horse tranquilizers) that she needs to be a better influence on the kids as she's encouraging them to make bad choices.  She vows to be back on the wagon.  Will also admits that he regrets never singing with her in high school and they amend this with a karaoke rendition of Heart's \"Alone\".  He also claims that she was what brought him to Glee Club in the first place. \n"}, {"text": "The Glee Club theorizes over Quinn's recent problems.  What is their first assumption?", "correct": "She's lactose intolerant", "options": ["She's contracted swine flu", "She's been having money issues", "She's nervous about her first solo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe's lactose intolerant.\n\n\tFinn and Rachel talk about Glee Club over a pizza and the fact that he would like to see her back.  When Rachel steps up to bowl her final ball, she strikes out and gives Finn a kiss.  She makes the decision to quit the play to rejoin Glee and Finn states that he doesn't know what the future will hold; he just wants to spend more time with her now.\rMeanwhile, at Glee Club, the kids try to figure out what has been wrong with Quinn lately.  Although one of the kids comments that she may be lactose intolerant, another reasons that it doesn't explain the crying.  Rachel makes her triumphant return at this point and discovers 'the scandal' that Puck has perpetuated: that Quinn is pregnant with Finn's child.  After Finn drops off scholarship forms with Emma, he walks down the hallway only to receive a slap from Rachel who says that he ruined her chances of coming back to Glee by lying to her, and that her dreams are bigger than his will ever be. \n"}, {"text": "When Rachel talks to Sue about the play, which of these is she granted?", "correct": "Complete artistic control", "options": ["Access to the Cheerios' wardrobe", "Her own dressing room", "All of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComplete artistic control.\n\n\tRachel, in anger, finds Mrs. Sylvester as she's taking down Glee Club posters around the school.  Rachel says that she's full-time for the play but changes need to be made.  After Sandy's recent attempt to play the role of 'Queen Cleopatra' in the production, she is willing to let Rachel take over the artistic direction of \"Cabaret\", giving her everything she wants in control aspects.\rMeanwhile, Glee Club gets ready for their performance at Invitationals.  While the kids practice their work in the choir room, April waltzes in at the last moment, drunk.

After their number, the crowd gives the group a standing ovation while Rachel watches from the back of the room.\rDuring the intermission, Will stops April as she exits the restroom saying that he can't let her go back on stage as she broke her promise to him.  April agrees saying that she couldn't go on anymore.  When she received her standing ovation, she was in the spotlight but she felt that the kids deserved their moment more.  She tells Will that she plans to straighten up and try for a new dream.  She leaves the Glee Club with a vacancy. \n"}, {"text": "For their final song at Invitationals, New Directions chooses a song by which band?", "correct": "Queen", "options": ["The Rolling Stones", "Aerosmith", "Journey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen.\n\n\tWith one spot open for the Glee Club, the kids wait in the choir room unsure of what to do.  Although satisfied with the success of their performance, Will informs them that April is no longer in Glee.  Rachel steps in with a solution- she can act as April's understudy as she has announced her departure from \"Cabaret\".  She tells the others that she realized that being a star comes second place to being their friends and that she knows all the words to their song. Finn is the first to welcome her back saying that they'll all need to help her out with the choreography.  Will returns to his seat in the audience as the kids hit the stage for their final performance, a rendition of Queen's \"Somebody to Love\". \n"}]}
