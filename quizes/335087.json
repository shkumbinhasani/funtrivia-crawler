Average [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "It all started when my alarm clock went off.  I tried to turn it off, but I was closer to the edge of the bed than I thought.  On my way down to the floor, I hit my sphenoid bone on the table beside my bed.  It hurt pretty badly.  What contains part of the sphenoid bone?", "correct": "Temple", "options": ["Chin", "Nose", "Forehead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTemple.\n\n\tThe sphenoid bone is located on the side of the head, between the ear and the eye, as well as part of the cheek.  The temple is usually associated with more of the cheek area, but it does include part of the sphenoid bone. \n"}, {"text": "I got up, and decided to head downstairs for breakfast.  I rushed down but I slipped on the second stair and went tumbling down them like an acrobat.  I only fell down halfway, though, because there was a platform in the middle of the stairs, almost like another floor, though it was only a few feet in size.  What is this platform often known as?", "correct": "Landing", "options": ["Rest Zone", "Midway", "Stair Break"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLanding.\n\n\tSome flights of stairs often have a landing, which allows stairs to turn and go in a different direction, instead of continuing down straight (though some stairs still go straight down, even with a landing).  The landing is like a giant step in the staircase or a very small level in between two stories. \n"}, {"text": "I brushed myself off and decided to eat a bagel.  I wanted to toast it, so I stuck it in, and set it for two minutes.  Well, it came out black, so I threw it away.  That was my last bagel, too!\n\nSome toasters have a \"bagel\" setting.  What does this setting do?", "correct": "Toasts ones side of the bagel and warms the other", "options": ["Toasts it for the perfect amount of time; 1 minute and 22 seconds", "Automatically spritzes butter on the bagel", "Expands the slots to fit a bagel inside"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToasts ones side of the bagel and warms the other.\n\n\tIf only I had known about the bagel setting, I would not have ended with mine burnt to a crisp.  The bagel setting on a toaster, either as a button or as a setting on a dial, will heat your bagel perfectly.  With this setting on, the inside part of the toaster will toast, while the outside heaters of the toaster will simply warm.  When you put the bagel inside, place the inside of the bagel towards the middle of the toaster.  It will toast the bagel's inside while only warming the outside, for the perfectly toasted bagel. \n"}, {"text": "I scrapped the bagel idea and went for cereal instead.  As I tasted my cereal, the milk tasted a bit odd.  It turns out that I had bought the wrong kind of milk at the supermarket.\n\nRegular milk comes from cows, but there are some milks you can buy that come from completely different sources.  Which of these is NOT a type of milk you could put on cereal to replace regular milk, if you're lactose intolerant?", "correct": "Buttermilk", "options": ["Rice Milk", "Soy Milk", "Almond Milk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nButtermilk.\n\n\tButtermilk is usually used for baking, and is much thicker than regular milk.  It is commonly used to make buttermilk biscuits, but not to eat with cereal.  Soy milk, almond milk, and rice milk are all good alternatives to regular milk if one is lactose intolerant. \n"}, {"text": "I decided to skip breakfast altogether, so I went back upstairs to brush my teeth.  But I realized that it was not toothpaste I had used.  It tasted horrible!\n\nWhich of these does NOT come in a tube similar to that of toothpaste?", "correct": "Cough Syrup", "options": ["Paint", "Tomato Paste", "Neosporin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCough Syrup.\n\n\tMany things come in a tube similar to that of toothpaste, but cough syrup is not one of them.  Cough syrup often comes in a bottle, and the lid sometimes acts as a built-in measuring device.\r Tomato paste comes in many different forms, but the tube can be used when you don't need an entire 8 oz. can.  Neosporin comes in a tube, and is used on cuts and scrapes to help speed the healing process.  Paint comes in all sorts of containers, and some paints used can be bought in little toothpaste-like tubes. \n"}, {"text": "Disgusted by what I just attempted to use for toothpaste, I decided to use some mouthwash to gargle out the horrible taste.  But, unfortunately, I grabbed window cleaner instead!  It tasted worse than the non-toothpaste!\n\nWhich of these is a brand of window cleaner?", "correct": "Windex", "options": ["Windar", "Winday", "Windzy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWindex.\n\n\tWindex is a window and hard-surface cleaner.  It has been made since 1933, and it was bought by SC Johnson in 1993.  Most people recognize Windex to be in a clear bottle with the cleaner being a blue liquid; very similar to the color of mouthwash if you aren't paying attention!\r But seriously, if you ingest ANY cleaner of ANY sort, contact your poison control center right away. \n"}, {"text": "I rinsed out my mouth of the cleaner, but I still had a funny after-taste all over my tongue.  I decided to go back downstairs (much more carefully this time) to get a drink of something tasty.  I reached into the fridge and grabbed some apple cider.  I poured a small glass and drank, but spat it out immediately; it was apple cider vinegar!  \"What's this doing in the FRIDGE?\" I thought to myself.\n\nApple cider vinegar is known to help with what ailment?", "correct": "Stomach ache", "options": ["Earache", "Headache", "Toothache"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStomach ache.\n\n\tApple cider vinegar is often used for stomach aches, whether in vinegar form or in pill form.  However, this vinegar is very acidic, and one must be careful not to drink it straight.  It is best combined with water or juice or something, just to get rid of some of the acidity.  One person even got acid burns in her throat from taking the ACV pill! \n"}, {"text": "I thought it'd be best to stop putting things in my mouth, and traveled back upstairs to get dressed.  On my way up, I stubbed my hallux quite hard.\n\nWhich toe is the hallux?", "correct": "Big Toe", "options": ["Middle Toe", "Pinky Toe", "Second Toe From the Left"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig Toe.\n\n\tThe hallux is often called the big toe, or the great toe.  This toe is the innermost of the toes on each foot.  It is generally bigger than all the other toes.  Sometimes, though, the toe right next to the hallux is longer, which is known as Morton's Toe or Greek Foot. \n"}, {"text": "When I got to my closet, I realized I only had one pair of pants that were clean, and only one polo shirt I'd never worn before.  I put on the jeans, and they were huge, so I grabbed a belt in the hope they at least stayed on.  They looked funny, but they fit.  Then I grabbed the shirt.  When I put it on, I realized it was actually a woman's shirt, but I hoped nobody would notice.\n\nHow can you tell whether a polo shirt is a men's shirt or a women's shirt?", "correct": "The direction of the buttons are different.", "options": ["There are never any pockets on a women's shirt.", "There will be shoulder pads in the women's shirt.", "The bottom of the shirt is frilly."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe direction of the buttons are different.\n\n\tOn a men's shirt, the buttons are on the right side, with the holes on the left.  On a women's shirt, however, the buttons are on the left side, with the holes on the right side.\r It still looked like a regular shirt to me, so I struggled to button the buttons the way I'm not used to, and hoped no one would notice. \n"}, {"text": "I realized I had not yet made my bed, so I decided to do so.  A spider was lurking in the sheets, though, and it bit my hand.  I didn't know what kind it was, but I didn't care.  I rushed to the emergency room where they told me the spider wasn't poisonous.\n\nWhile on the subject of spiders, tell me; about how strong is spider silk?", "correct": "As strong as steel", "options": ["As strong as bamboo", "As strong as diamond", "As strong as glass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs strong as steel.\n\n\tSpider silk is about six times lighter than steel, but with the same weight's worth of steel and spider silk, the silk is stronger.  In fact, if you were to blow up the spider silk to a large enough size, it is strong enough to stop a jet engine in flight!\r According to tensile strength, some steel has around 850 ultimate strength (MPa), while that of spider silk is 1,000MPa!  Bamboo is only around 350-500MPa, glass is only 33MPa, and diamond is a whopping 2,800MPa.  Even stronger, though, is graphene, at 130,000MPa. \n"}]}
