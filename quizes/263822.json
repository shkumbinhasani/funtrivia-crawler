{"id": "263822", "name": "1.8 \"I Robot ... You Jane\" Quiz / Test | 'Buffy' By the Season | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "'Buffy' By the Season", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "The episode begins in Italy, in 1418, with a horned green demon casually killing one of his followers. In a nearby church, a monk announces that Moloch the Corruptor has returned, and initiates a ceremony to banish him to the pages of a book. How is this accomplished?", "correct": "As his fellow monks surround him in a circle, he chants commands for the demon to come.", "options": ["The monks storm Moloch's stronghold, demonstrating previously unknown martial-arts skills.", "He and his fellow monks perform a Riverdance-style routine while shouting Moloch's name.", "Carrying the book, he climbs to the top of a high mountain and appeals directly to God."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs his fellow monks surround him in a circle, he chants commands for the demon to come.\n\n\tMoloch (whose name recalls the Hebrew description of an ancient Phoenician god, who demanded children burned alive in sacrifice) seems aware that something is wrong, but can do nothing to stop \"the power of the Circle of Kayless.\" Finally, his body vanishes in a cloud of cheesy special effects, and words in a strange language fill the pages of the previously empty book.\"Pray this accursed book shall never again be read, lest the demon Moloch be loosed upon the world,\" says the monk as he seals the tome in a large box. It is unclear why the book is not burned, cast into the sea, or otherwise destroyed. \n"}, {"text": "We fast forward 579 years to the library at Sunnydale High in 1997, where Buffy is removing Moloch's book from its box. A teacher is leading Willow and other computer club members in an effort to scan and inventory the library's new arrivals. Who is this computer science teacher, a recurring character in the first two seasons?", "correct": "Jenny Calendar", "options": ["Natalie French", "Amy Madison", "Marcie Ross"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJenny Calendar.\n\n\tJenny Calendar is Sunnydale High's computer science teacher, a \"technopagan\" who finds traces of the divine in the Internet. Giles is dubious, but intrigued. In this episode, she flirts shamelessly with Giles, deftly rebutting his assertions that books are better than computers. She also displays a startling familiarity with the supernatural. \n"}, {"text": "One computer club member stays late to make more progress. As Moloch's book is scanned into the computer, we see the words leave their pages as his essence enters the machine. Who accidentally releases the demon?", "correct": "Willow", "options": ["Xander", "Fritz", "Dave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWillow.\n\n\tXander departs the library at his first opportunity; Fritz leaves early after denouncing people who are not \"jacked in\"; and Dave leaves on time with Ms. Calendar. Willow remains, scanning the demonic pages of the book (with a scanner that's far too narrow for it) and using a rather adorably dated Apple interface to store the information. The scene closes with Moloch asking, via prompt, \"Where am I?\" \n"}, {"text": "The next week, Willow giddily tells Buffy that -- wonder of wonders! -- she has a boyfriend. Buffy wants details: \"Does he go here? What's his name? Have you kissed him? What's he like?\" Where does Willow reveal that she met her sweetheart?", "correct": "Online", "options": ["At a masquerade ball", "On a conference call", "In a dark club, where all she could hear was his voice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnline.\n\n\tIt turns out that Willow and Malcolm/Moloch have been chatting online for a week, and that he's so sweet, and so kind, and so understanding ... but Buffy can't help being suspicious. After all, he could be anyone -- and \"what if ... he has a hairy back?\" Willow is not impressed with Buffy's worries, especially when she keeps bringing it up in scene after scene. \"I don't understand why you don't want me to have this,\" she says, heartbreakingly, in the girls' locker room the next day. \"I mean, boys don't chase me around all the time. I thought you'd be happy for me.\" \n"}, {"text": "Having been firmly told by both Fritz and Dave that Willow's new relationship is none of her business, Buffy begins to suspect that something is up with the boys in the computer club. On Giles's advice, she tails Dave to CRD, where she notices a lot of activity. What is CRD?", "correct": "Calax R and D", "options": ["Center for Ridiculous Devices", "Chimpanzee R and D", "Center for the Rehabilitation of Demons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalax R and D.\n\n\tSurprisingly enough, it's Xander who comes up with this crucial item: \"It's Calax R & D,\" he tells a stunned Buffy and Giles in the library. \"Used to be the third largest employer in Sunnydale, until it closed last year.\" They stare at him blankly. \"What, I can't have information sometimes?\"\r Giles finally manages a shocked, \"Well, it's just somewhat unprecedented.\" \n"}, {"text": "As Willow continues her giddy relationship with Malcolm, signs increase that something is awry in Sunnydale's computers. A nurse is heard to remark that the computer file didn't say anything about a student's allergy! But what is the first sign of trouble?", "correct": "A student realizes his report on Nazi Germany has been altered.", "options": ["Giles notices that the library computer system thinks that he has checked out all the books.", "The principal realizes that his salary has been reduced.", "To her delight, Buffy notices that her schedule no longer includes math."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA student realizes his report on Nazi Germany has been altered.\n\n\tThe student is sitting on one of Sunnydale High's numerous outdoor stairways, staring in disbelief at the screen of his clunky mid-1990s laptop as Buffy walks by. \"This isn't my report!\" he gapes. \"'Nazi Germany was a model of a well-ordered society?' I didn't write that! Who's been in my files?\"\r Malcolm/Moloch has certainly wasted no time learning what's happened in the world since his banishment -- and he apparently has a strong taste for pranks. \n"}, {"text": "Giles and Buffy are having no luck solving the mystery -- or even persuading themselves that there is one! -- until a chance discovery in the library. How does Giles discover Moloch's book?", "correct": "After he assures the computer teacher that books are more information-rich than computers, she shows him a blank one.", "options": ["The computer teacher hits him over the head with it in a fight; after she leaves, he opens it and realizes its identity.", "As he searches for the latest \"Internet for Dummies\" so he can begin his research, he finds the book in the shelves.", "He literally trips over the book as he goes to make tea."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAfter he assures the computer teacher that books are more information-rich than computers, she shows him a blank one.\n\n\tMs. Calendar comes into the library to check on the databases, remarks with surprise that Buffy and Xander seem to spend an awful lot of time there (\"To read, makes our speaking English good,\" Xander explains, lamely), and proceeds to get into an argument with Giles about whether computers are useful tools.In response to his argument that books contain much more information than websites, she holds up a blank one and asks him if that's a diary. He takes the book, recognizes Moloch's face on the cover, and, with an ashen face, lies that it is indeed a diary. He wanders into his office for further research. \n"}, {"text": "Things get serious, fast. Dave lures Buffy into a locker-room trap; her life is saved only when he has sudden regrets. He storms into the computer lab to confront Moloch/Malcolm and resign from the club. Sadly, that isn't allowed (at least not for a single-episode character). How does poor Dave die?", "correct": "Fritz hangs him, making it look like a suicide.", "options": ["Moloch sends a power surge to the lab, electrocuting him.", "Moloch's vampire allies do the deed.", "Fritz hits him over the head."], "explanation": "\n\n\nFritz hangs him, making it look like a suicide.\n\n\tThe trap for Buffy consists of bare electrical wires in a shower stall; when Buffy goes to turn off the water, she narrowly misses a fatal electrocution. (She avoids it only by starting to jump when Dave warns her to get out; when she lands, her boots are smoking.) An angry Dave storms to the computer lab to tell Moloch/Malcolm that he's had it. \"Buffy isn't a threat to you! It's not worth it!\" The demon, not impressed, writes a suicide note on the computer and prints it out, as the camera pans to a lethal-looking Fritz in the corner. \n"}, {"text": "Having belatedly realized that Willow's new boyfriend is the ancient demon Moloch, Buffy and Xander race to find her as Giles and the computer teacher research ways of banishing the Corruptor. They locate her at CRD; suspense, tension, and fight scenes ensue. How does Buffy destroy Moloch's robot body?", "correct": "She tricks him into punching a high-voltage electrical conduit.", "options": ["She makes the ceiling collapse on him.", "She kills him in the usual way, with high kicks and hard punches.", "She lures him onto a catwalk, and pushes him over the edge when he momentarily loses his balance."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe tricks him into punching a high-voltage electrical conduit.\n\n\tWillow has been kidnapped from her home by Fritz; Malcolm/Moloch has decided that it's time for them to meet face to face. In CRD's labs, we see that Moloch has had a robot body made for himself, and he's just as sweet-tempered as ever when he casually breaks Fritz's neck. \"Welcome, my love,\" he coos in a metallic voice. \"I can't tell you how good it is to see you with my own two eyes.\" Willow is having none of it, and the demon loses his temper -- when Giles and Jenny, having set up an Internet Circle of Kayless, manage to banish the demon from the Internet to his own robot body.\r Robbed of his newfound power and knowledge, Moloch is extremely upset and still very, very strong. Buffy tries to fight him, but finds her kicks and punches useless against his metal body. At long last, she manages to goad him into punching an high-voltage conduit, electrocuting himself. The light-and-sparks show is truly impressive. \n"}, {"text": "In the final scene of the episode, a despondent Willow sits by a fountain on a beautiful day. Buffy and Xander soon arrive to cheer her up. What reason does Willow give for being so upset?", "correct": "She wonders what it says about her that her only boyfriend turned out to be a robot demon.", "options": ["She feels terribly guilty about her role in the whole mess.", "She misses her computer club friends.", "She doesn't feel safe on the Internet anymore."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe wonders what it says about her that her only boyfriend turned out to be a robot demon.\n\n\t\"It doesn't say anything about you,\" Buffy says quickly. \"Hey, did you forget? The one boy I've had the hots for since I moved here turned out to be a vampire.\" Xander follows suit: \"Right, and the teacher I had a crush on? Giant praying mantis!\"\r Willow smiles faintly. \"That's true.\"\r Xander agrees that \"That's life on the Hellmouth.\" Buffy expands on the theme: \"Let's face it! None of us are ever gonna have a happy, normal relationship!\" Xander seals it: \"We're doomed!\"\r The three friends laugh uproariously -- then, realizing what they've just said, their faces slowly fall. \n"}]}
