The game stars Banjo the bear and Kazooie the breegull as they travel through the evil witch Gruntilda's lair in order to save Banjo's sister Tooty.  Along the way, Bottles the groundhog appears at his many holes in order to teach the duo different techniques that will help them throughout the game.  Throughout the game, you collect Jiggies (large puzzle pieces) to complete puzzles that access new worlds.\n\nWhere is my error in this paragraph?", "correct": "Bottles is a mole; not a groundhog.", "options": ["Bottles does not teach new techniques.", "\"Banjo-Kazooie\" was created by Konami; not Rare.", "Jiggies are not used to access new worlds."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBottles is a mole; not a groundhog.\n\n\tBottles the mole appears in both \"Banjo-Kazooie\" and \"Banjo-Tooie\" as a major character.  In the first game, he teaches skills and records Note scores, but in the sequel he is killed by Grunty and her sisters when they rip through Spiral Mountain on their giant digging machine.  Although Konami is a major video game company, they did not make \"Banjo-Tooie\".  At the same time that this game was released, \"Konami\" was adding titles to its \"Dance Dance Revolution\" series and releasing \"Nagano Winter Olympics '98\" on the Nintendo 64. \n"}, {"text": "The characters throughout the game are extremely important in your quest to reach Grunty and save Tooty.  Throughout the game, you'll encounter other animals and even inanimate objects.  Nabnut and Gnawty (a squirrel and beaver respectively) are both found in Click Clock Wood along with Gobi and Eyrie.  Loggo the toilet is found on the top floor of Mad Monster Mansion and he contains a Jiggy that can be reached with the help of Mumbo Jumbo the shaman.  Gloop the fish will also give you a Jiggy in Clanker's Cavern.  Characters in the first few levels include Captain Blubber, Chimpy, and Clanker.\n\nWhich part of this summary is incorrect?", "correct": "Gloop will not give you a Jiggy.", "options": ["Chimpy is only found on Freezeezy Peak, the fifth level of the game.", "Gobi is only found in Gobi's Valley.", "Loggo is in Rusty Bucket Bay."], "explanation": "\n\n\nGloop will not give you a Jiggy.\n\n\tGloop is a small fish in the bottom of Clanker's Cavern who will give you bubbles of air while you're collecting Notes and a Jinjo, and turning the key in the deepest area of the level.  Gobi may be found in Gobi's Valley, but if you collect the Empty Honeycomb from him in that stage, he'll later appear in Click Clock Wood to help you get a Jiggy as well.  He later appears in \"Banjo-Tooie\" as well (so look for him in Witchyworld).  To get into Loggo's pipes, Mumbo Jumbo must transform you into a pumpkin for twenty Mumbo Tokens.  Chimpy is in Mumbo's Mountain. \n"}, {"text": "The worlds of the game are large and filled with interesting goodies.  To begin, Mumbo's Mountain requires one Jiggy to enter and it can be found easily on Spiral Mountain.  In this stage, you explore to find three new techniques and the first of five Mumbo huts.  The second stage, Treasure Trove Cove has you swimming around an island while learning how to fly.  Clanker's Cavern helps you perfect your swimming skills as you raise a garbage disposal and enter its stomach to find Jiggies.  Bubblegloop Swamp is the fourth stage.  Here, you can learn how to use Wading Boots while avoiding piranha-infested waters.\n\nI know I've messed up something in this paragraph, but what exactly?", "correct": "The first Jiggy is not found on Spiral Mountain.", "options": ["The Wading Boots are first used in Clanker's Cavern.", "You learn to fly in Mumbo's Mountain, not Treasure Trove Cove.", "There are only two techniques to learn in Mumbo's Mountain."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe first Jiggy is not found on Spiral Mountain.\n\n\tThe first Jiggy is actually found on a small pile of rocks in Gruntilda's Lair just to the left of the Lair's entrance.  This can be used on the first picture which is found just outside the entrance to Mumbo's Mountain.  One of the two techniques taught to you in Treasure Trove Cove is how to use the Flight Pad.  This can be found once in Clanker's Cavern, but the Wading Boots can't.  You don't learn how to use those items until the fourth stage in the swamp.  Wading boots are used to help you cross swamp, sand, bramble and cold water. \n"}, {"text": "The second half of the game features five worlds.  Freezeezy Peak is the first of these and it gives you a chance to hone your flying skills with a new move performed in flight.  After traveling to the desert world of Gobi's Valley, you'll head to Mad Monster Mansion where Mumbo will transform you into a pumpkin for twenty Mumbo Tokens.  In Rusty Bucket Bay, you'll have to find Jiggies in a deadly harbor, and in the final stage, Click Clock Wood, you'll need to become a bee- the only transformation in the game that can attack enemies.  After this, you can head to Grunty's Furnace Fun.\n\nOkay, okay.  I lied.  One of these facts is incorrect.  What's wrong?", "correct": "As a bee, you can't attack enemies.", "options": ["Click Clock Wood appears before Rusty Bucket Bay, chronologically.", "The pumpkin transformation costs only fifteen Mumbo Tokens.", "Freezeezy Peak does not contain any new techniques."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs a bee, you can't attack enemies.\n\n\tThe only Mumbo transformation that can possibly attack enemies is the alligator of Bubblegloop Swamp.  The bee on the other hand can fly to great heights without the use of valuable Red Feathers.  Then again, the bee will only be able to be used during the springtime for a few Jinjos and to enter the Zubba hive.  Freezeezy Peak contains the Beak Bomb aerial technique and although Click Clock Wood is the ninth stage chronologically, Rusty Bucket Bay is the eighth, so it appears first. \n"}, {"text": "Without the techniques taught to you during the game, Banjo and Kazooie wouldn't make it to the second stage.  In the first stage alone, Banjo and Kazooie learn how to use eggs and how to perform the ever-useful Talon Trot.  Throughout Grunty's Lair, you'll learn how to fly and how to cross large areas using Wading Boots and Turbo Shoes.  The final technique is learned in Gobi's Valley.  Although many techniques can be found in the lair, many are taught on Spiral Mountain such as the Beak Buster, Rat-A-Tat Rap, and Double Jump.\n\nWhich fact should be changed here?", "correct": "The Beak Buster is not learned on Spiral Mountain.", "options": ["The Talon Trot technique is learned in Treasure Trove Cove.", "Kazooie doesn't use Eggs until \"Banjo-Tooie\".", "The final technique is learned in Mad Monster Mansion."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Beak Buster is not learned on Spiral Mountain.\n\n\tThe Beak Buster is the third technique learned on Mumbo's Mountain and it is used to smash switches and enemies.  The Talon Trot is also on Mumbo's Mountain and it's used to climb the steep hill to Treasure Trove Cove.  Eggs can be found for the first time in Mumbo's Mountain and they're used throughout the game.  They're also in \"Banjo-Tooie\" as well and they can be aimed on the ground, in the air, or underwater with new techniques from Jamjars.  The final technique, found in Gobi's Valley, involves the Turbo Shoes. \n"}, {"text": "Although there are few items in the game, they're extremely important.  The Red Feathers, for example, are used to let Kazooie fly while the Gold Feathers will let Kazooie use the Wonderwing.  Notes are used to open Note doors throughout the Lair while Jiggies will allow you to access new stages from Mumbo's Mountain to Grunty's Furnace Fun.  Health in the game is measured in Honeycombs.\n\nThere's clearly an error in here, eh?  What's wrong with this one?", "correct": "Grunty's Furnace Fun doesn't need to be opened using Jiggies.", "options": ["Red Feathers and Gold Feathers are the other way around.  Red is for the Wonderwing while Gold is for flight.", "Health is not measured in Honeycombs.", "The Wonderwing isn't a technique learned in this game."], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrunty's Furnace Fun doesn't need to be opened using Jiggies.\n\n\tAlthough this paragraph seems shorter than the others, there's a lot of information.  You need to learn how to use Eggs, Red Feathers, and Gold Feathers.  Also, there are timed items like the Wading Boots and Turbo Shoes that allow you to reach places easier or faster.  Also, important items like Notes and Jiggies must be collected in order for you to progress through the game.  In the sequel, \"Banjo-Tooie\", the amount of collectible items increases drastically as players can collect Cheato pages, Glowbos, and more. \n"}, {"text": "As well as the regular items, there's also some important stuff scattered throughout the game.  One is the well-known Ice Key in Freezeezy Peak although it really serves no purpose in this game.  Then again, a more common, yet important item is the Jinjo.  Jinjos come in five different colours and they appear in every stage to give you a total of ten Jiggies!  Jinjos also play an important role in the final battle against Gruntilda.  Empty Honeycombs can also be found in the game (there's two in every stage).  These will increase the amount of health you can have if you collect six.\n\nDid you spot the error here?  What's the problem in this one?", "correct": "Jinjos throughout the game only account for nine Jiggies.", "options": ["There's only one Empty Honeycomb per stage.", "There's three Empty Honeycombs per stage.", "The Ice Key is not found in Freezeezy Peak."], "explanation": "\n\n\nJinjos throughout the game only account for nine Jiggies.\n\n\tThere are only nine stages from Mumbo's Mountain through to Click Clock Wood and neither Gruntilda's Lair nor Spiral Mountain will hold a Jinjo.  Therefore, only nine of your hundred Jiggies will be earned if you collect each Jinjo in each world.  Jinjos come in blue, orange, yellow, green, and pink in every world. There are only two Empty Honeycombs in each stage, but there are six on Spiral Mountain (which is not regarded as a stage in Gruntilda's Lair).  There are no Empty Honeycombs in the actual lair.  Using cheats you can reach the Ice Key, but it can't be used in this game.  In \"Banjo-Tooie\", it's used to unlock the Mega-Glowbo's safe. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the game it might be wise to cheat a bit whether you have trouble or not.  You can find Cheato the spellbook in three different locations in Grunty's Lair.  The first involves using the alligator to climb through a pipe.  The second involves increasing the amount of Gold Feathers you can hold.  The third involves raising the water surrounding Rusty Bucket Bay's entrance.  All of these cheats can be input on the sandcastle floor in Treasure Trove Cove.\n\nCheat if you must- I'll let you if it helps my quiz get online.  What's the error in here", "correct": "The second spellbook involves Red Feathers.", "options": ["The first spellbook is accessed with the termite transformation.", "The codes are input on Spiral Mountain.", "The third spellbook is near Click Clock Wood, not Rusty Bucket Bay."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe second spellbook involves Red Feathers.\n\n\tThe first Cheato Book is near the Freezeezy Peak picture though you must break it open as bear and bird before using the alligator transformation.  This code will increase your Blue Egg capacity.  The second cheat is for Red Feathers and you must be in pumpkin form to reach it outside of Mad Monster Mansion (near the Gobi's Valley picture).  The third code is for Gold Feathers and it's found outside Rusty Bucket Bay (the water must be raised all three times.  More cheats can be found on Spiral Mountain following completion of the game. \n"}, {"text": "Banjo hasn't been restricted solely to this game.  Banjo first appeared in the game \"Diddy Kong Racing\" as a default, playable character (without Kazooie though).  Banjo and Kazooie later appeared in the sequel to \"Banjo-Kazooie\" known as \"Banjo-Tooie\" (also for N64).  They later reappeared in a third game called \"Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge\" for the Game Boy Advance.  Following this was a new racing game, \"Banjo-Pilot\" for the Nintendo DS.\n\nDo you know your games well enough here?  What's the problem with this paragraph?", "correct": "\"Banjo-Pilot\" was released on the Game Boy Advance.", "options": ["\"Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge\" was released before \"Banjo-Tooie\".", "\"Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge\" was released on the Nintendo DS.", "Banjo was not a default character in \"Diddy Kong Racing\"."], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Banjo-Pilot\" was released on the Game Boy Advance.\n\n\tAlthough popular, \"Diddy Kong Racing\" was shadowed by the popular \"Mario Kart 64\", but the game still sold enough units to become a Player's Choice game for the system.  Following the release of this, Rare created \"Banjo-Kazooie\" and \"Banjo-Tooie\", both of which also added to the Player's Choice list (along with Rare's \"Goldeneye 007\" and \"Perfect Dark\").  Shortly after \"Grunty's Revenge\" was made, Rare was bought by Microsoft. Despite this, Rare still produced the popular \"Starfox Adventures\" for the Gamecube before it could make its sole (and relatively unknown) Xbox game, \"Grabbed by the Ghoulies\".  Rare continued to make games for Nintendo's handheld systems as well as the Xbox 360 in the later years at the don of the new gaming generation. \n"}, {"text": "The end of the game is quite fun.  Following Grunty's Furnace Fun, you'll hit a new note door and a puzzle requiring sixteen Jiggies.  Beyond this is Grunty's cauldron and four Note Doors.  These contain items that will refill all of the important items needed for the boss as well as a final puzzle consisting of four Jiggies.  This puzzle will double your health.  While fighting Gruntilda, she'll be on her broom most of the time.  After a few rounds, you'll use the Jinjos to help you win the games.  During the credits, the main characters will be on a tropical island.\n\nLast one, and of course, there's something wrong about it.  Can you put your finger on the incorrect fact?", "correct": "The puzzle beyond Grunty's Furnace Fun requires twenty-five Jiggies.", "options": ["The puzzle that doubles your health requires six Jiggies.", "The final credits roll at Spiral Mountain, not a tropical island.", "Jinjos are nowhere to be found during the final battle."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe puzzle beyond Grunty's Furnace Fun requires twenty-five Jiggies.\n\n\tBy the end of the game, you'll either end up with six Jiggies or two Jiggies if you've obtained all one hundred.  The double health puzzle can be found behind the 882-Note Door.  This door has the highest value in the game.  In the fourth stage of the battle, you must use Eggs to create Jinjo Missiles.  In the final portion of the battle, you must charge up a large Jinjo statue called the Jinjonator to defeat the witch.  In the end, you'll end up on a deserted island with Mumbo, Bottles, and Tooty.  They'll talk about \"Banjo-Tooie\" and reveal some of the hidden eggs through the game.\r Well, thanks for fixing up my quiz!  It's always better to have someone look over it first.  You saw how many errors I had! :)\rOff to the queues with this one! \n"}]}
