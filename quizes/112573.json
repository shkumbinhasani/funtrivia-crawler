VI Quiz | Mixed 10 Questions | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Mixed 10 Questions", "  Mixed 10 Q. Difficult [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "Astronomy: What is the single largest star in size (but not necessarily brightness) that human beings can see with their naked eye?  \n", "correct": "Betelgeuse", "options": ["Canopus", "Sirius", "Rigel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBetelgeuse.\n\n\tBetelgeuse, found within the constellation Orion, is the largest star that human beings can see unaided.  A red supergiant, Betelgeuse fluctuates in size, sometimes expanding, sometimes deflating.  At its most expansive point, Betelgeuse would swallow the planet Jupiter if centered at the sun's position.  Let's be thankful that we don't call Betelgeuse our sun!  (Note: In brightness, the sun would be the #1, obviously...and then Sirius!) \n"}, {"text": "Language: What English word can be spelled with the following sequence of Greek letters: phi, iota, lambda, omicron, sigma, omicron, phi, iota, alpha? \n", "correct": "philosophy & philosophia", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nphilosophy & philosophia.\n\n\tAs is obvious to many of you, the term 'philosophy' is from the ancient Greek and means 'lover of wisdom'.  Only a true philosopher could have spelled the answer correctly... \n"}, {"text": "Writers: Which famous playwright hung a picture of his 'mortal enemy', August Strindberg, above his writing desk?  \n", "correct": "Henrik Ibsen", "options": ["Johann Wolfgang von Goethe", "Hans Christian Andersen", "Leo Tolstoy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenrik Ibsen.\n\n\tIbsen was a famed playwright from Norway, perhaps best known for his play called 'A Doll's House'.  August Strindberg, a playwright from Sweden, wrote 'Miss Julie', among other works.  Said Ibsen about Strindberg, \"He is my mortal enemy and shall hang there and watch while I write.\"  Now that's either pure hate or secret admiration...or maybe a bit of both! \n"}, {"text": "Archaeological finds: The famous archaeologist Henrich Schliemann, who discovered the ruins of Troy, located a gold 'death-mask' during his excavation of the Mycenaean civilization.  Which ancient Greek hero did he assign as the wearer of this mask? \n", "correct": "Agamemnon", "options": ["Odysseus", "Achilles", "Ajax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAgamemnon.\n\n\tSchliemann, a German explorer and archaeologist, led expeditions which located Troy and rediscovered the ancient Mycenaean culture in Greece, so he could afford to be eccentric.  Of course his claim that the death-mask of Agamemnon, an ancient Greek king, had been located, proved to be false...but lets allow for some frivolity here. \n"}, {"text": "Chemical elements: Which chemical element was once called Columbium, and still alternatively so by some diehards?  \n", "correct": "Niobium", "options": ["Actinium", "Fermium", "Molybdenum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNiobium.\n\n\tNiobium was discovered in 1801 by Charles Hatchett, who named it Columbium, after the European 'discoverer' of the New World.  The element was alternatively named Niobium, after the daughter of Tantalus of Greek myth, when it was thought to be a different element from the one Hatchett had identified.  After some 100 years of controversy, the name Niobium was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, though grudgingly by many chemists.  There are still some holdouts for the name Columbium, I am told. \n"}, {"text": "Fun with language: Using some rudimentary knowledge of Latin and ancient Greek I have cobbled together the name of an imaginary beast, namely: Rubernaris Sophoselaphus.  How would this beast's name translate into English?  \n", "correct": "Red-nostriled wise deer", "options": ["Narrow-brained happy ant", "Gigantic-toed messy elephant", "Hairy-knuckled jumping hippo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed-nostriled wise deer.\n\n\tOf course we know that no such creature exists...or do we?  To review:  ruber = red, naris = nostril, sophos = wise, elaphus = deer.  I got the idea for this via the San Diego Zoo website, you can try creating your own crazy beasts by going here: http://www.sandiegozoo.org/wildideas/kids/readaboutit_scinames_proj.html...try it with your kids (or try it, if you're a kid...even at heart). \n"}, {"text": "Cities: Floating along a canal in a boat built for two is certainly the fantasy of many a romantic.  Which of these cities is not one in which a canal cruise would be feasible? \n", "correct": "Barcelona", "options": ["St. Petersburg", "Amsterdam", "Venice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarcelona.\n\n\tAmsterdam, Venice and St. Petersburg are all well known for the numerous canals that cut their way through those gorgeous cities.  Don't plan for a canal cruise if you travel to Barcelona, unless it's a cruise from Barcelona to Panama. \n"}, {"text": "Islands: Canada has a number of very large islands off its northern coast.  Of these rather large islands, which is the northernmost? \n", "correct": "Ellesmere", "options": ["Banks", "Baffin", "Victoria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEllesmere.\n\n\tEllesmere Island is known as Quttinirpaaq in the Inuit language, and contains the northernmost point of land in Canada.  Aside from being Canada's third largest island, Ellesmere is also the world's tenth largest island (75,800 sq mi/196,000 sq km). \n"}, {"text": "Strange place names: Assenisipia, Metropotamia and Miochigania were all names proposed for which of the following?  \n", "correct": "New U.S. states", "options": ["Newly formed South American countries", "Caribbean islands", "Cities in Canada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew U.S. states\n\n\tIn 1784 Thomas Jefferson became part of a committee responsible for subdividing and naming the newly acquired western territories of the nascent United States.  Combining Greek words with Native American place names, his committee came up with these crazy gems.  'Washington' was also proposed as one of the states, but all of the names were rejected by Congress...they were too weird (guess 'Washington' wasn't so weird though, it's now the name for the 42nd U.S. state.) \n"}, {"text": "Organizations: Turkey is the only member of NATO that is not fully located on the European continent, true or false?  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tI thought I'd try to trick some of you...hope not too many!  Of course, fellow NATO countries the United States and Canada are both located in North America, which has certainly never been accused of being part of Europe.  Turkey is located in Asia, for the most part, though a small portion of the country lies in southeastern Europe.
