But which composer of film music was responsible for the majority of this film's marvellous soundtrack?", "correct": "Ennio Morricone", "options": ["Jerome Kern", "Danny Elfman", "Leonard Bernstein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEnnio Morricone.\n\n\tWith over 500 soundtrack credits to his name, Ennio Morricone is one of the most prolific providers of film music of all time. This was the last soundtrack that Morricone provided for a Sergio Leone film and it was, ironically, Leone's last film.  Morricone can also be credited with providing the soundtracks to such epics as 'Once Upon a Time in the West', all three of the soundtracks to the 'Dollars Trilogy' and 'The Mission' amongst many, many others. \n"}, {"text": "Within which ethnic community does this story predominately take place?", "correct": "Jewish", "options": ["Italian", "Japanese", "German"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJewish.\n\n\tUnusually for a gangster movie, the story is set within and around the Jewish community of Manhattan's Lower East Side.

The scene ends with Aaronson passing through a door in the wall, symbolically leaving his old life behind as he embarks on a new life away from his home.

In an adjoining restroom a small section of wall had been removed which allowed him to do this but Aaronson didn't know that Deborah was aware of his voyeurism. On one occasion she strips to change and almost causes Aaronson to fall from the toilet on which he is standing!  Many years later, after returning to New York, Aaronson revisits the restroom in Moe's bar only to find that the opening is still there.

Unfortunately, this meant that the consignment was lost but Max and Noodles have an idea that will prevent this.  The contraband is attached to a large bag of salt and a buoy. After the cases are jettisoned over the side of a boat and had sunk, the salt dissolves and the cases of contraband, now much lighter, rise to the surface with the buoy.  This prevents the loss of the consignment.  After the gang retrieves the contraband, they secrete their share of the proceeds in a locker at the railway station inside a brown leather suitcase. \n"}, {"text": "Aaronson receives a twelve year jail term for setting the fire which destroys the newspaper stand in which the owner dies.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis is false.
