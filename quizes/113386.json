{"id": "113386", "name": "The Peter Pan of Dogs Trivia Quiz | Dog Breeds | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "Dog Breeds", "Retrievers"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the following best describes the physical appearance of the flat-coated retriever? ", "correct": "The most lightly-built of all retrievers, the flat-coat has a medium length coat of black or liver.", "options": ["The flatcoat has a stocky build and a black coat with a dense undercoat.", "The flatcoat has a medium build and a short coat in black, chocolate or yellow.", "The smallest of the retrievers, the flatcoat has a dense, silky black coat."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe most lightly-built of all retrievers, the flat-coat has a medium length coat of black or liver.\n\n\tThe flat-coated retriever is typically 22-24\" tall, weighing 55-80 pounds, or about 10 pounds less than a Labrador or golden retriever of similar height. While most flat-coats are black, some are liver (brown) in color. Their coat is of medium length, shorter that a golden but longer than a Lab. As their name implies, the coat is ideally flat without any wave or curl. \n"}, {"text": "What is the temperament of the flat-coated retriever like? ", "correct": "Extremely active and intelligent, friendly to all people and animals", "options": ["A real couch potato, loves everybody, highly trainable", "Likes nothing more than to please his master, standoffish to others", "Not too bright, but very devoted and loyal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExtremely active and intelligent, friendly to all people and animals.\n\n\tFlat-coats are the most energetic and active of all the retriever breeds, and require far more exercise than most people can provide. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a feat that flat-coats have accomplished?", "correct": "More field championships earned per registered dog than any other retriever breed", "options": ["More agility  titles earned per registered dog than any other retriever breed", "More obedience titles earned per registered dog than any other retriever breed", "More working test titles earned per registered dog than any other retriever breed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMore field championships earned per registered dog than any other retriever breed.\n\n\tThe flat-coated retriever is the undiscovered versatile breed! Not only does it earn more titles per dog than any other retriever, it's in the top three breeds for obedience and performance titles over *all* breeds! In addition, the flat-coated retriever was one of only 3 AKC breeds in 2001 (the other two being the golden and Labrador retriever) for which every offered AKC performance title was earned by at least one dog- CH, CD, CDX, UD, UDX, OTCH, TD, TDX, VST and CT. However, the flat-coat does not dominate in the world of retriever field trialling, which is almost exclusively a Labrador Retriever sport. \n"}, {"text": "The flat-coated retriever is an ideal pet for most families.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe flat-coat needs a job to do. Without work, a bored flatcoat will tear your house to pieces, bother you incessantly to throw a ball, or otherwise be a pest. Although this breed is easily trainable and friendly to everyone, this high exercise need makes the flat-coat such a high-maintenance dog that it's an unsuitable breed for most families. \n"}, {"text": "Unlike most retriever breeds, there is no \"field line\"/\"show line\" split in the flat-coated retriever.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMost retrievers, especially the Labrador and golden retrievers, have an extreme difference between field lines, bred to hunt, and show lines, bred to look good. It has been many years since there was a dual champion (field and show) Lab or Golden. \n"}, {"text": "What is the single greatest health concern of the flat-coated retriever?", "correct": "Cancer", "options": ["Epilepsy", "Hip dysplasia", "Subvalvular aortic stenosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCancer.\n\n\tUnfortunately, cancer plagues this wonderful breed. The median survival age for flat-coats is only 8. Almost all deaths in the breed are due to cancer. Several studies have been done on cancer in the breed, and it's very likely that a genetic mutation is responsible for the high cancer rate. \n"}, {"text": "Which breed was not used in the development of the flat-coated retriever?", "correct": "Golden retriever", "options": ["Border collie", "St. John's water dog", "Water spaniel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolden retriever.\n\n\tThe St. John's water dog was from Newfoundland and is the forerunner of the Newfoundland breed of today. The golden retriever was actually bred from a cross between the flat-coated retriever and a water spaniel. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following health tests do breeders not typically do when planning a litter of flat-coats?", "correct": "Heart check by a cardiologist", "options": ["OFA x-rays to detect hip dysplasia", "OFA x-rays to detect patellar luxation", "CERF eye check"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeart check by a cardiologist.\n\n\tFlat-coats luckily do not share the heart defects that plague Labradors and goldens. They have a low rate of hip dysplasia and eye defects, but responsible breeders check for them anyway. Patellar luxation (slipping kneecaps) is found in some dogs. \n"}, {"text": "In which way does the flat-coated retriever's coat differ from other retrievers?", "correct": "It lacks a thick undercoat", "options": ["It is longer", "It has more oil", "It sheds less"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt lacks a thick undercoat.\n\n\tThe undercoat is the thick woolly hair between the topcoat and the skin. Other breeds, especially the golden and Chesapeake Bay retrievers, have a thick undercoat. The flat-coat does not, which makes it a poor choice for a hunting dog in very cold, icy water. The breed was originally developed for hunting upland birds, where a thick undercoat was not a necessity. \n"}, {"text": "Why is the flat-coated retriever called \"the Peter Pan of dogs\"?", "correct": "Because they never really act their age", "options": ["Because it's a magical breed", "Because they seem to fly over the ground", "Because they like small children"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause they never really act their age.\n\n\tThis term was coined by English breeder Paddy Petch. Flat-coats remain playful and funloving throughout their lives, always delighting you with silly antics. They are not a dignified breed! \n"}]}
