{"id": "303723", "name": "Han Solo in History Trivia Game | Asian | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "       Asian", " China"], "questions": [{"text": "What Dynasty was the predecessor of the Han Dynasty?", "correct": "Qin Dynasty", "options": ["Shang Dynasty", "Qing Dynasty", "Zhou Dynasty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQin Dynasty.\n\n\tThe oldest Chinese dynasty is the Xia Dynasty, which ruled from about 2100 BC to 1650 BC.  The dates are unknown, and are disputed.  In fact, it is often said to be a myth and that the Xia Dynasty never even existed!  The next Dynasty was the Shang Dynasty, which ruled between 1766 BC and 1122 BC.  Next in the list of dynasties was the Zhou Dynasty, which lasted from 1045 BC to 256 BC.  The Zhou Dynasty was followed by the Qin Dynasty, which lasted only a very short time - from 221 BC to 206 BC.  After the Qin Dynasty is the theme of the quiz, the Han Dynasty. This dynasty lasted from 206 BC to 220 AD.  Finally, the Qing Dynasty, often confused with the Qin Dynasty, is the most recent of the list of dynasties. The Qing Dynasty lasted from 1644 to 1912.  It was briefly restored in 1917, but did not last long.  Interestingly, my great grandmother was born a few months before the Qing Dynasty ended in 1912! \n"}, {"text": "There were two capitals of the Han Dynasty during its reign.  What was the capital of from 206 BC to 9 AD?", "correct": "Chang'an", "options": ["Xianyang", "Luoyang", "Haojing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChang'an.\n\n\tXianyang was the capital of the Qin Dynasty.  Haojing was one of two capitals of the Zhou Dynasty, the other being Luoyang.  Chang'an was the capital of the Han Dynasty from 206 BC to 9 AD.  But in 25 AD, Luoyang was adopted as the capital once more, nearly 450 years later! \n"}, {"text": "During the Han Dynasty, many trade routes were established.  Travelling merchants used these routes to sell their merchandise to other parts of the world.  What were these great paths called?", "correct": "Silk Roads", "options": ["Satin Roads", "Spice Routes", "Porcelain Routes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilk Roads.\n\n\tThe reason for being called the \"Silk Road\" is simple.  The roads were used to export Chinese silk westwards.  It became a major trade route in Ancient China, and some elements survive. \n"}, {"text": "Something happened in Chinese history that would end one dynasty and start the next.  What caused the rise of the Han Dynasty (and destroyed its immediate predecessor)?", "correct": "The previous Emperor died, and many revolted against the dynasty", "options": ["Taxes were too high, and a new dynasty rose to lower taxes", "The dynasty was conquered by Koreans, who named the new dynasty the Han", "It was a simple renaming of a previously existing dynasty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe previous Emperor died, and many revolted against the dynasty.\n\n\tEmperor Qin Shi Huang had died, and revolts began right across the social spectrum, from peasants to nobles.  The revolts led to war, which led to the fall of the Qin Dynasty.  The Han Dynasty quickly rose to power. \n"}, {"text": "During the Han Dynasty, there was a period of time that was called a period of stability.  What was this period of stability called during the Han Dynasty?", "correct": "Rule of Wen and Jing", "options": ["Rule of Yin and Yang", "Rule of Ming and Zhang", "Rule of Cheech and Chong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRule of Wen and Jing.\n\n\tThe \"Rule of Wen and Jing\" was named after two rulers, Wen and Jing.  They were great Han rulers.  They reduced taxes, and encouraged Taoist influences in governmental issues.  The rule was known as a 'golden age.'  The next 'golden age' would not come onto the scene until the rule of Ming and Zhang in the first century CE. \n"}, {"text": "Under which ruler was a governmental school system established?  (When you first look at these answers, you may want to note that this ruler was NOT Mulan in a disguise).", "correct": "Ping", "options": ["Shan Yu", "Mushu", "Tawn Wi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPing.\n\n\tPing is the name Mulan took as her own so nobody would know she was a woman.  Mushu was the dragon guardian of Mulan, AKA Ping, and Shan Yu was the evil Hun!  Note that he was a Hun, not a Han.  There was a difference!  Tawn Wi is a character from \"Star Wars II: Clone Wars,\" the tall woman from Kamino.  Ping of the Han Dynasty reigned from 1 BCE to 5 CE, a mere 6 years.  In 3 CE, the governmental school system was formed. \n"}, {"text": "Of course, we wouldn't know much about the Han Dynasty or any other time period of Chinese history if it weren't for historians.  Who was known as China's most famous historian during the Han Dynasty?", "correct": "Sima Qian", "options": ["Fa Zhou", "Wu Liu", "Jackie Chan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSima Qian.\n\n\tAlthough Jackie Chan is Chinese, he was not born when the years were counted down BCE ...  Fa Zhou is the father of Mulan in \"Mulan.\"  Wu Liu is a combination of Emperor Wu and Emperor Ping Liu of the Han Dynasty, so he does not really exist.  Sima Qian was born in 145 BCE and died in 86 BCE... approximately, anyways.  Sima Qian was most noted for his work \"Records of the Grand Historian.\"  It covered 2,000 years of rich, Chinese culture and history, from the Yellow Emperor to Emperor Han Wudi. \n"}, {"text": "Cai Lun invented something extraordinary that changed - first China and later the world - forever.  What was that invention?", "correct": "Paper", "options": ["None of these", "Silk", "Gunpowder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaper.\n\n\tCai Lun was a eunuch who lived from 50 CE to 121 CE.  He invented paper, or at least was the most recognized inventor of paper.  Who would have thought, that something we take for granted was something invented nearly 2,000 years ago, and was something new and became a great technological advancement!  Nowadays, we consider a great technological advance something sophisticated like  putting miniature keyboards without buttons on cell phones. Now, we are trying to REDUCE the amount of paper made!  It was a great idea for 2,000 years, but do you think Cai Lun thought in 2,000 years it would be much worse on the environment?  :-D \n"}, {"text": "A very interesting man lived during the Han Dynasty.  This man \"interrupted\" the Han Dynasty from 9 CE to 24 CE.  Who was he?", "correct": "Wang Mang", "options": ["Fang Lang", "Lang Bang", "Tang Xang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWang Mang.\n\n\tNote that Wang is pronounced with the \"ah\" sound, and Mang is pronounced with the \"ay\" sound.  Wang Mang was a reformer and believed the Liu family had lost what was known as the \"Mandate of Heaven.\"  Therefore, he overthrew the Lius and founded the Xin Dynasty, which lasted only from 9-23 CE.  The Han Dynasty was restored to power when Wang Mang was overthrown as Emperor.  The Xin Dynasty was one of the shorter dynasties of China. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout Chinese history, hundreds of Emperors ruled.  Some ruled for days, some ruled for many years.  But tell me, which of these Emperors do you think actually lived during the Han Dynasty?", "correct": "Wen Di", "options": ["Gao Lu", "Shio Di", "Hun Di"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWen Di.\n\n\tGao Lu, Shio Di, and Hun Di never existed.  However, Gao Zu, Shao Di, and Hui Di were rulers of the Han Dynasty.  Wen Di, although the name may be deceiving, was NOT a woman named Wendy.  In fact, that name hadn't even been invented until Peter Pan came to be!  He ruled from 179 to 157 BC.\r Thank you for travelling with the Han throughout history!  I hope you enjoyed the journey.  If you would like any additional information about the Han Dynasty and other facts mentioned in this quiz, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty.  Note: the period is not part of the URL, that is simply to end my sentence!  ;-)\r I should probably mention that Han Solo was used simply as a clever name for the quiz.  He has nothing to do with the Han Dynasty, besides having the same name.  I apologize if you thought you were playing a quiz about Han Solo.  I hope you enjoyed it, anyway!  :-D \n"}]}
