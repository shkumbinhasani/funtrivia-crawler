{"id": "274339", "name": "Planet Terror Online Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Grindhouse"], "questions": [{"text": "What faux trailer attached to this film was also made by Robert Rodriguez?", "correct": "Machete", "options": ["Werewolf Women of the SS", "Don't", "Thanksgiving"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMachete.\n\n\t\"Machete\" is the story of a Mexican federale who vows revenge against the American hit men who wronged him.  Alongside Father Benicio Del Toro (Cheech Marin), he destroys all those who get in his way, while getting a chance with the ladies.  \"Machete\" plays during the actual \"Grindhouse\" film, but after the opening credits.  Since it was made by \"Robert Rodriguez\", it is somewhat packaged with the film.  Danny Trejo plays Machete.\rThe other three mock trailers are played between \"Planet Terror\" and \"Death Proof\" and are made by Eli Roth, Rob Zombie, and Edgar Wright.  Each of them explores different genres of horror, but each one is no less than what you'd see in an actual grindhouse. \n"}, {"text": "What profession did Cherry Darling quit at the beginning of the film?", "correct": "Go-go dancer", "options": ["Waitress", "Comedienne", "Nurse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGo-go dancer.\n\n\tIn the opening scenes of the movie, Cherry is doing her go-go dance routine on stage, but she ends up crying by the end.  When she's in the dressing room, her boss tells her that she can't keep crying during the dance because the go-go is supposed to be a happy dance (as he puts it, it's 'go-go', not 'cry-cry').  She decides to get rid of that useless talent to find a use for her others, so she flips him the bird, takes her money, and leaves to club.\rWhile she walks down the road, three trucks nearly hit her on their way to the military base.  One of these contains scientist, Abby, as he goes to meet some people for his 'specimens'. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the restaurant owned by JT?", "correct": "The Bone Shack & Bone Shack", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bone Shack & Bone Shack.\n\n\tDuring their meeting, Lt. Muldoon realizes that Abby has been holding extra canisters of the dangerous chemical DC2, so he decides to take it all.  Abby tries to retaliate, so he shoots the canisters, releasing the gas into the air.  This inadvertently saves the army men, but all of the people killed in the battle around them have turned into zombie-like creatures.  Abby makes it out alive, but a sicko is attacking him from on the roof of the car.\rAbby passes by a gas station and The Bone Shack on his way down the road. It is here where Cherry reunites with her former lover, El Wray.  She discusses her future with him and the fact that she no longer wants to be a go-go dancer, but a comedienne instead (a fact made even more ironic when she loses her leg). \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Dr. Block's lover?", "correct": "Tammy", "options": ["Julia", "Judy", "Pam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTammy.\n\n\tTammy stops at The Bone Shack before Cherry does, in order to fix her car which is overheating (due to a stripped radiator cap).  She tells JT that she needs to get to the town urgently.  He asks if it's to save lives, and she says yes.\rMeanwhile, Doctors William and Dakota Block are waking up for their night shift at the local hospital.  Dakota mysteriously talks with Tammy over a palm pilot while her son eats his 'breakfast' to say that she'll be taking her son with her.  Evidently, she's planning an escape.\rThey make their way to the hospital where William's first patient is a local fisher with an odd bite on his arm.  He and another doctor investigate the wound, find that the man has a fever of 105, and that he has tons of abscesses on his tongue.  He tries to pop one, but it bursts. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Dakota Block has three anesthetic needles that she uses.  What colours are they?", "correct": "Yellow, Red, and Blue", "options": ["Green, Brown, and Black", "Orange, Red, and Black", "All white"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYellow, Red, and Blue.\n\n\tWhen Dr. Block sends for his wife to help Joe, she brings what she calls her three friends.  When she arrives, Joe's arm is nearly completely covered by the sores and William fears they may need to cut his arm off immediately to prevent further spreading of the infection.  This is where Dakota comes in.  Her first 'friend', the yellow needle, is used to take the sting off of it.  The second, blue needle, doesn't have any feel to it, and after the third, she says, they'll never see her again.\rMeanwhile, Tammy's car dies on the road to town, two miles outside the military base.  As she tries to flag down a car for help, she is promptly attacked by sickos and killed.  El Wray and Cherry watch to see her dragged off the road.  They naturally assume it's roadkill. \n"}, {"text": "When Cherry's leg is eaten by sickos, they leave her leg behind.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAfter watching Tammy get dragged away, El Wray and Cherry end up accidentally crashing El Wray's car.  They are soon attacked by the sickos and Cherry is dragged off into the forest where Wray shoots them with his gun.  Cherry's leg is taken away and he takes her to the hospital where Sheriff Hague promptly arrests him and takes him to the station to talk.\rMeanwhile, more dead/infected patients come to the hospital and William asks to see his wife.  When she comes to see what he's talking about, he shows her Tammy on the stretcher, her brain having been completely scooped out of her skull.  She runs to another room where he confronts her about seeing her again (with her palm pilot as proof).  William ends up using Dakota's needles to numb her completely and he stores her in a closet, while dealing with the other patients coming in (and some of the dead ones walking out).\rThe cops leave Wray at the police station while they deal with some of the sickos attacking them outside.  He decides to make his escape. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Dr. Block's son?", "correct": "Tony", "options": ["Jimmy", "Billy", "Corey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTony.\n\n\tWilliam and his colleague decide that self-preservation is the most important thing to think about with more infected sickos coming into the hospital, so William decides to 'get his wife'.  Along the way, he looks into a bloody room and finds one of the infected killing a surgeon with a bone saw.  He is soon attacked himself, but the power cord for the saw is pulled from the wall just in time (though it cuts his glasses in two).  The sicko bursts an abscess on his face and smears it on Dr. Block.  Meanwhile, Earl McGraw, the old Sheriff, is feeding his catatonic wife when he gets a call from Sheriff Hague about the incident.  His wife soon turns into a sicko, so he is forced to kill her.\rDakota escapes from her closet and jumps out a window to free herself from the hospital.  When she gets to her car, she accidentally breaks her numb hand trying to open the door.  Nonetheless, she gets home to find her son with the babysitter twins who are watching him and she sends them off.  She gathers her son while he tries to gather his pets (a turtle, a tarantula, and a scorpion...in the same tank) and his pocket bike (which they place into the trunk) and they head to her father's place.  When they get there though, she tells her son to stay in the car with the gun, and if any strangers come by, he's to shoot them.  As soon as she walks to the door though, Tony shoots himself by accident.  She rushes to the car to save him while the sickos ambush her, but her father, Earl McGraw, comes to her rescue and takes her and her dead son inside. \n"}, {"text": "What is the inscription on the ring that Wray bought for Cherry?", "correct": "Two against the world", "options": ["To my darling", "My love, my wife", "Wray's one and only"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo against the world.\n\n\tWray gets to the hospital and begins fighting off the infected to save Cherry who, losing her hopes of becoming a stand-up comedienne, is not happy that Wray finds jokes about cripples somewhat funnier.  He attaches a table leg to her stump and they make their way to his truck.  They both head off to The Bone Shack with the cops.  Inside, they find JT unharmed having killed some of the infected in his restaurant.  JT shows the group to a custom car and motorcycle that they can use to make an escape.  In the meantime, they can rest in the safety of the restaurant.  Cherry and Wray take the time to rekindle their relationship, and Wray shows Cherry the ring that he left for her in his jacket pocket, so they make love in the bedroom.  The inscription gives Cherry a renewed sense of pride in her useless talents.\rAt this point in the movie, the film cuts out.  The next scene has the restaurant on fire.  Dakota Block, Earl McGraw, the babysitter twins, and Cherry's old boss and go-go dancer colleagues have arrived, and Sheriff Hague has been attacked, however, he has new trust in El Wray, who tells him a convincing story and is now able to take all the guns.  They decide to clear the way, make an escape route, and leave.  Cherry decides to start up Wray's 'kill-dozer' and they take the car and motorcycle (while Ray takes Tony's pocket-bike) and they head to the Mexican border...but they're stopped by Lt. Muldoon and his troops. \n"}, {"text": "Does JT ever tell his barbecue recipe to his brother, Sheriff Hague?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe remaining survivors are quarantined underneath the military base, and Abby tells them all that the troops are using the DC2 (codename 'Project Terror') to continually keep them all from becoming sickos.  At this point, two of the troops take Dakota and Cherry with them to another locations with intentions of raping them.  The others make a plan and defeat the two remaining guards, but JT is shot in the process.  Wray and Abby take a nearby elevator down to defeat Lt. Muldoon.\rWhen they encounter him, he says that he and his troops found Osama Bin Laden and killed him, but during their celebration, they were infected with DC2.  During their conversation, he slowly mutates into a rather large sicko before he is destroyed by Abby and Wray.  Just before they're about to be raped, Cherry and Dakota are saved by Wray, and he replaces her table leg with a machine gun/grenade launcher.  They take the survivors and leave the building while JT and Sheriff Hague stay back and talk about the barbecue sauce. \n"}, {"text": "Where do the survivors flee to in the of the film?", "correct": "Mexico", "options": ["An underground cave system", "Canada", "Cuba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMexico.\n\n\tWhile the survivors head to the top of the complex, Cherry uses her new leg to defeat the soldiers in their way.  Abby tells them that they are all the antidote to the infection before attempting to lead the group through the troops.  He is shot in the head on the way.  Everyone else goes in the other direction.\rUnderground, JT and Sheriff Hague set off the detonator that Wray gave to them, and they blow up the complex.  They take that as their cue topside and Cherry is called into action.  She single-handedly avoids catastrophe and destroys many of the containers of DC2 and fights off the troops.  However, she is nearly shot, and Wray sacrifices himself to save her, getting shot in the process.\rWhile everyone boards the helicopter, Dakota investigates a second copter, finding her husband inside.  She tells William she was seeing Tammy to hurt him, and before he attacks her with the red needle, her father saves her, shooting William multiple times.  They board the copter, which begins to fly.  Cherry's boss uses the copter's blades to decapitate the rest of the troops.\rCherry says her final goodbyes to Wray, who she is forced to leave behind.  He tells her that his child is inside of her, so she has to carry on and be strong.  Dakota lets down a rope from the chopper and Cherry is pulled into the sky.\rThe survivors make their way to Mexico, where there are more infected humans, but they hold their own inside the temples at Tulum.  Here, with their back to the ocean, they are able to get by and repopulate the Earth.  Cherry has Wray's child, and they survive day by day as 'two against the world'. \n"}]}
