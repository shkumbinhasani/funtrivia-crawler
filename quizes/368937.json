Who doesn't she call before her father?", "correct": "Principal Skinner", "options": ["Marge", "Aunt Patty", "Aunt Selma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincipal Skinner.\n\n\tLisa awakens Homer from a dream before she gets through to him; he was sleeping on the job.  The reason is because she has a talent show that evening and she broke her last saxophone reed.  She needs a new one, but she has already called Marge, Ned Flanders, Aunt Patty and Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy, and the guy who got the snake out of their basement.  Homer, happy that she chose him after all them, says he'll get her a 4 1/2 reed after work, just in time for the show. \n"}, {"text": "Who convinces the owner of King Toot's Music Store to reopen for Homer?", "correct": "Moe", "options": ["Barney", "Lisa", "Ned"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoe.\n\n\tHomer arrives at King Toot's Music Store five minutes before it's supposed to close, but discovers that Moe's Tavern is right next door.  Instead of accomplishing what he set out to do, he decides that a quick beer is necessary.  Of course, this means that he misses the closing of the store.

As such, Homer needs to be run through a list of possible instruments.  Ultimately, he figures out that he's looking for a saxophone reed, but doesn't know what kind.

This fails miserably as nothing seems to make her feel better.  He ends up watching old home videos of Lisa and realizes he was never really a figure in her life.  Marge suggests he spend time with her, but this doesn't really work out either since he can't see the love in her eyes.

There, he's informed that some of the ponies on-site come with the hefty price tag of half a million dollars due to their lineages. All said and done, for a basic pony without the names behind it, he's looking at a starting price of $5,000 in cash.

Lisa, meanwhile, spends her time at the stable grooming and riding her horse.\rHomer, heading to the Kwik-E-Mart to buy a lottery ticket, lets it slip to Apu that he's looking for money.

The next day she ends up giving it back to the owner of the stable and tells Homer that he can quit the Kwik-E-Mart.  Regardless of the pony, she still loves a big, dumb animal more than Princess-- her father. \n"}]}
