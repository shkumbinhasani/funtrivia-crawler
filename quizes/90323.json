{"id": "90323", "name": "Renaissance Masters III Quiz | Renaissance Art | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Renaissance Art"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these facts is actually true of Domenico Veneziano?  \n", "correct": "Only two signed works of his exist today", "options": ["He was active mainly in Venice during his art career", "He was murdered by fellow artist Andrea del Castagno", "He introduced the medium of oil paints to Florence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly two signed works of his exist today.\n\n\tThe two tall tales regarding Castagno and oil paints were rumors propagated by the great art historian Vasari.  And strangely enough, though his name is Veneziano (he was born in Venice) he spent most of his art career (from 1439 until his death in 1461) in Florence.  It is true that only two signed works survive from Domenico, his 'Carnesecchi Tabernacle' (in London) and the 'St. Lucy Altarpiece' to be found in the Uffizi in Florence, although there are others assigned to him. \n"}, {"text": "One of the greatest of the early Renaissance artists was Piero della Francesca.  However, Piero was remembered in the years after he died not as a master painter but rather in what capacity?  \n", "correct": "Mathematician", "options": ["Statesman", "Clergyman", "Explorer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMathematician.\n\n\tPiero seems to have given up painting in his last years and dedicated his time to creating scholarly works in geometry and perspective.  In fact, Piero's status as one of the supreme Renaissance masters was not restored until the 20th century when it was noted that he was an important figure in carrying on the trend of employing scientific perspective in painting, begun by Masaccio. Piero also learned superb painterly skills from his master Domenico Veneziano, and helped propagate them among his pupils Signorelli and Perugino.  His work is best observed in the choir room at S. Francesco in Arezzo, Italia...a wonderful set of his frescos can be found there! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these painters was closely associated with the great master Masaccio during his career, even mistakenly having been considered the former's master for many years?  \n", "correct": "Masolino", "options": ["Il Guercino", "Perugino", "Rustichiello"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMasolino.\n\n\tMasolino was not Masaccio's master, only having entered the painters' guild in Florence a year before Masaccio, but the two of them did work together on a number of pieces until Masaccio's early death in 1428. \n"}, {"text": "Paolo Uccello was an obsessive painter, and would often work deep into the night on his art, much to his wife's consternation.  According to Vasari, when Uccello's wife would call him to bed he would respond, 'Oh, what a lovely thing this _______ is!' (Fill in the blank)  \n", "correct": "Perspective", "options": ["Paintbrush", "Canvas", "Easel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPerspective.\n\n\tUccello fell in love with the Renaissance revival of perspective and according to Ruskin, he was the first to apply it.  Ruskin was incorrect, however...twas Masaccio that first employed it in the modern era. \n"}, {"text": "Donatello and Michelangelo clearly created the most famous sculptures of David, but who was the Renaissance master that created the most famous David painting, now to be found on a leather shield located in the National Gallery of Art at Washington D.C.?  \n", "correct": "Castagno", "options": ["Raphael", "Leonardo", "Botticelli"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCastagno.\n\n\tAndrea del Castagno's David stands defiant, sling in hand and prepared to strike, looming over the head of Goliath whom he has already struck with a stone's blow. \n"}, {"text": "He is considered by many to be the most important art theorist of the Renaissance, having written works such as 'On Painting' (1439) and 'On Architecture' (1452).  What was his name?  \n", "correct": "Alberti", "options": ["Vitruvius", "Bruno", "Manfredi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlberti.\n\n\tLeon Battista Alberti was also an accomplished painter and sculptor, along with being an architect (he designed the palazzo Rucellai in Florence, and S. Francesco in Rimini), but he was most well known for his writings. \n"}, {"text": "The tomb of leading Renaissance humanist and chancellor of Florence Leonardo Bruni was designed by which leading sculptor of the mid-15th century?  \n", "correct": "Bernardo Rossellino", "options": ["Niccolo Dell'arca", "Michelozzo", "Ghiberti"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBernardo Rossellino.\n\n\tBernardo Rossellino and his brother Antonio were active in Florence around the mid-15th century, but the elder brother Bernardo achieved greater fame largely because of the tomb he designed for Bruni.  Bruni was one of the pupils of Coluccio Salutati, one of the greatest Renaissance humanists and statesmen. \n"}, {"text": "Another early Renaissance sculptor, also remembered as a painter and engraver, he preceded Leonardo da Vinci in dissecting corpses in order to study human anatomy.  His most famous works include a bronze of 'Hercules and Antaeus' wrestling and his engraving 'Battle of the 10 Naked Men' in which his anatomical studies are clearly illustrated.  What was this fascinating artist's name? ", "correct": "Pollaiuolo", "options": ["Lippi", "Giorgione", "Angelico"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPollaiuolo.\n\n\tAntonio del Pollaiuolo also had a less famous brother, Piero, who jointly ran a workshop for artists in Florence with Antonio.  Antonio's engraving of the nude men almost reminds me of modern comic book art; each muscle is exaggerated in appearance! \n"}, {"text": "Verrocchio was one of the greatest sculptors of the Renaissance era.  Unfortunately, however, his career has been overshadowed by the great masters that worked before and after him.  He is considered the greatest sculptor of the period between Donatello and Michelangelo, and his 'David' sculpture is overshadowed by the other two sculptors famed works.  Verrocchio also created a wonderful equestrian sculpture, a monument to Bartolommeo Colleoni, to be found in Venice.  However, this sculpture is again overshadowed by Donatello's Gattamelata monument.  Further, Verrocchio's notoriety as a sculptor has been overshadowed by his having been the master of what later Renaissance great?  ", "correct": "Leonardo & Leonardo da Vinci & da Vinci", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonardo & Leonardo da Vinci & da Vinci.\n\n\tFortunately, old Mr. True-eye is well-represented in books on Renaissance art and art fans can enjoy his great works during their tours of Italia. \n"}, {"text": "Andrea Mantegna was a pupil and adopted son to which famous but troubled master of Padua?  \n", "correct": "Squarcione", "options": ["Pacheco", "Ghirlandaio", "Luca della Robbia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSquarcione.\n\n\tSquarcione is considered to be the father of Paduan style by some, while others consider such a style mythical.  One thing that cannot be denied is that he was the teacher of Mantegna, who later sued his master for having exploited his work (several other pupils sued as well, it was a big scandal!)  Mantegna was the early master of foreshortening...I really love his work!  (Check out his several versions of St. Sebastian.)
