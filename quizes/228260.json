{"id": "228260", "name": "Top Movies of 1987 Multiple Choice Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1980s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Filmed in three acts, this Vietnam war epic by Stanley Kubrick follows the exploits of one Private Joker, soldier and jester.  What is the name of this film, featuring the most intense boot camp scenes in cinema history?", "correct": "Full Metal Jacket", "options": ["Prisoners of War", "Hamburger Hill", "Platoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFull Metal Jacket.\n\n\tAn actual drill sergeant in his former life, R. Lee Ermey provides the authenticity to the boot camp scenes that make up the first third of the film.  Matthew Modine portrays Joker, a small-town smart alec who meanders through boot camp right into the *bleep* in Vietnam.  Vincent D'Onofrio submits an unforgettable performance in this film as the hapless Private Gomer Pyle. \n"}, {"text": "Set around 1900, this film depicts the difficult times of a Swedish man and his young son who have arrived in Denmark desperate for work.  They find it and other adventures despite the hostile attitude of the locals.  Complete the title of this beautifully filmed masterpiece: '_______ the Conqueror'.\n", "correct": "Pelle", "options": ["Swen", "Jan", "Lars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPelle.\n\n\tI insist that if you have not seen 'Pelle the Conqueror', you must as soon as possible!  Bille August directs this long film, rich in dialogue and replete with unforgettable scenes.  Veteran Swedish actor Max von Sydow plays Lasse, father to young Pelle, who is portrayed by a real child actor named Pelle (Hvenegaard). \n"}, {"text": "You want cynicism, treachery and otherwise ill behavior, look no further than 'Wall Street', a film that delves into the sinister side of the American corporate world just as the 'Me Generation' is reaching its apex.  Featuring an Oscar-winning performance by Michael Douglas, who directs this little bit of movie charm?", "correct": "Oliver Stone", "options": ["Barry Levinson", "Ivan Reitman", "Milos Forman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOliver Stone.\n\n\tBe careful not to watch 'Wall Street' on a full stomach, it's liable to make you feel queasy.  Supporting the excellent performance by Michael Douglas in this film we have Charlie Sheen, Hal Holbrook, Martin Sheen, Terence Stamp, Sean Young, James Spader and, last but certainly not least, Daryl Hannah. \n"}, {"text": "Call it a guilty pleasure, or just call it a magnificent comic adventure, 'Raising Arizona' is certainly among the best films created by the Coen Brothers.  Starring Nicholas Cage as hayseed ex-con H.I. McDunnough, who appears alongside him as his wife Edwina?", "correct": "Holly Hunter", "options": ["Susan Sarandon", "Glenn Close", "Geena Davis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHolly Hunter.\n\n\t'Raising Arizona' is a magnificent comic send-up of modern, rural Western culture, complete with cheesy furniture salesman, white bread picnics in the desert, motorcycle madmen and offers of wife swapping.  Holly Hunter is downright funny as Edwina McDunnough, and Nick Cage draws on something deep inside he probably never knew existed to create H.I.  An unbelievable supporting cast that includes John Goodman, William Forsythe, Trey Wilson, Frances McDormand, Randall 'Tex' Cobb, Sam McMurray, among others, makes this not only a must see, but a must have DVD (or VHS, if you're still living in the 90s). \n"}, {"text": "One of my personal favorite films of all time, this one out of China.  It involves a woman who has inherited the winemaking facility of her recently passed husband, and the group of men who help assist her in said winemaking.  Brilliantly filmed by China's greatest director Zhang Yimou, what is the title of this cinematic masterwork?", "correct": "Red Sorghum", "options": ["The Wedding Banquet", "Life on a String", "Xiu Xiu, The Sent Down Girl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed Sorghum.\n\n\tZhang Yimou has provided a great deal of entertainment with his films, from 'Judou' to 'Raise the Red Lantern, and from 'The Road Home' to 'Hero', but I still love his first full-length film, 'Red Sorghum', above the rest.  Gong Li stars in this film alongside Jiang Wen. \n"}, {"text": "'Babette's Feast' provides a gorgeous visual feast for the viewer.  In which European country is this celebration of culinary delights and human relationships set?", "correct": "Denmark", "options": ["Italy", "Greece", "Ireland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDenmark.\n\n\t'Babette's Feast' is based on the writing of Karen Blixen, aka Isak Dinesen, perhaps Denmark's greatest writer.  In this film, two Danish sisters, isolated from the world and suppressed by their father, are treated to a luxurious feast by their French servant.  This one feast changes their entire lives.  Treat yourself and see it. \n"}, {"text": "'The Princess Bride' proves that a film can be both cinematically pleasing and iconic in pop culture.  Starring Cary Elwes as Westley, a young man with an impossible mission to gain back his lost love, this comically entertaining film is directed by whom?", "correct": "Rob Reiner", "options": ["Penny Marshall", "John Landis", "Christopher Guest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRob Reiner.\n\n\t'The Princess Bride' benefits greatly from its stellar cast, with Cary Elwes joined by Billy Crystal, Andre the Giant, Robin Wright Penn, Mandy Patinkin, Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon, among many others.  \r Rumor has it that director Rob Reiner was so amused while directing Billy Crystal that he was forced to leave the set due to fits of laughter. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the semi-autobiographical film by John Boorman features the story of a young London boy and his experiences during the difficult years of World War II?", "correct": "Hope and Glory", "options": ["Less Than Zero", "Near Dark", "Over the Top"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHope and Glory.\n\n\tWhile World War II rages, young Bill Rowan passes through his personal age of discovery.  Despite the violent and chaotic atmosphere, Bill is still able to discover the beauties of living.  The movie is written and directed by Boorman, who previously brought films such as 'Deliverance' and 'Excalibur' to the big screen. \n"}, {"text": "Which magnificent epic film about the life and times of China's final emperor Pu Yi won the Best Picture Oscar for the year 1987?", "correct": "The Last Emperor", "options": ["Empire of the Sun", "The Boy Who Would Be King", "Twilight in the Forbidden City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Last Emperor.\n\n\tSources for director Bernardo Bertolucci's masterpiece included Reginald Johnston's 'Twilight in the Forbidden City' and Henry Pu Yi's 'From Emperor to Citizen: The Autobiography of Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi', among others.  In the film, the adult Pu Yi was potrayed by John Lone, while Peter O'Toole provided a superb performance as Reginald Johnston, Pu Yi's English tutor.  The movie won nine Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, but sadly, O'Toole was not even nominated for Supporting Actor. \n"}, {"text": "From the sublime to the ridiculous, the final movie to make this list comes from the demented mind of Sam Raimi, and stars B-movie icon Bruce Campbell.  It features the story of a man, trapped in an isolated cabin, who sees one companion after another either disappear or die horribly, with the main culprit being some mischievous (but amusing) demons.  Which film sequel fits this description?", "correct": "Evil Dead II", "options": ["Friday the 13th II", "Halloween II", "Nightmare on Elm Street II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvil Dead II.\n\n\tA rare horror film to make my top ten lists, this low budget laughfest deserves much attention.  Superior to the original 'The Evil Dead' (1981) in its quality, this sequel goes where horror films have rarely gone before, into the realm of comedy.  Bruce Campbell deftly plays his now iconic role of 'Ash' with a corny nobility that nearly transcends the film itself.  I know what you are thinking, 'He's exaggerating'.  Perhaps so, but you should give the film a chance before imagining such things!\r Thanks for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it.  Please feel free to let me know your thoughts...what are your favorite movies from 1987? \n"}]}
