{"id": "378474", "name": "Strange Things Are Happening IV Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "In which movie did a woman pretend to be a man to inherit money?", "correct": "Homicidal", "options": ["The Talented Mr. Ripley", "Psycho", "Mrs. Doubtfire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHomicidal.\n\n\tIn the first 20 or so minutes of the movie \"Homicidal\", a woman staying at a hotel hired the bellboy to pose as her groom and go with her to get married.  After waking a judge from his sleep at his house so he could perform the ceremony and after saying \"I do\", she pulled a knife from her purse and stabbed the judge to death.  She drove away in the bellboy's car.  Later, it was revealed that in a few days a man would turn 21 and inherit a bunch of money, but the \"man\" was really the woman who killed the judge, and the judge was one of the few people who knew. \n"}, {"text": "Who got stabbed by a spaceship in \"Flash Gordon\" (1980)?", "correct": "Ming the Merciless", "options": ["Flash Gordon", "Zorlock", "Zarkoff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMing the Merciless.\n\n\tWhen Flash Gordon used a stolen spaceship to crash (literally) the wedding between Dale and Ming the Merciless, the spike sticking from the front of the spaceship stabbed Ming.  Ming pulled himself away while bleeding black blood.  Flash threatened him with a sword, but Ming disappeared in a flash, although his magic ring remained and fell to the pavement.  A floating machine told Flash he had saved the Earth.  Later, a gloved hand picked up the ring. \n"}, {"text": "In what movie did Michael Caine wear a dress to kill someone?", "correct": "Dressed To Kill", "options": ["Blood and Wine", "California Suite", "Sleuth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDressed To Kill.\n\n\tIn the movie \"Dressed To Kill\", director Brian De Palma decided to do an homage of \"Psycho\" in a completely different setting.  Somewhere in a big city, probably in Canada, a prostitute (Nancy Allen) saw someone in a dress slashing a woman to death in an elevator.  She became friends with the dead woman's son and found out the killer was really a man, a crazy psychologist (Michael Caine) who dressed like a woman and killed whatever woman turned him on. \n"}, {"text": "In what movie did Anthony Perkins wear a dress to kill someone?", "correct": "Psycho", "options": ["Tootsie", "Murder on the Orient Express", "Tin Star"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPsycho.\n\n\tIs there anyone that doesn't know this?  For those who don't know, when Norman Bates was young (according to the sequel \"Psycho IV: The Beginning\"), his widowed mother had a boyfriend he didn't like, so he poisoned him, but his mother drank some of the poison, too.  Of course, anyone watching the movie \"Psycho\" in 1960 followed the story about a woman who stole some money to give to her boyfriend. She ended up at a motel and got murdered.  The rest of the movie involved people trying to find out why she was killed and what happened to the money.  It was discovered that Norman Bates pretended to be his dead mother when he killed people. \n"}, {"text": "In what movie did Rod Steiger wear a dress, and other disguises, to kill women?", "correct": "No Way to Treat a Lady", "options": ["In the Heat of the Night", "Oklahoma", "Illustrated Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo Way to Treat a Lady.\n\n\tIn \"No Way to Treat a Lady\", Rod Steiger played a man who thought he was such an expert actor that he could fool any woman into letting him into her house so he could kill her.  I listed other Rod Steiger movies because it's fun to think about mixing this movie with one of his other ones.  What if the police chief from \"In the Heat of the Night\" dressed like a woman and killed people on his day off?  What if he did this in \"Oklahoma\", where the wind comes sweeping down the plain? \n"}, {"text": "In what movie did Rod Steiger play a priest who got sick while trying to bless a house where people had previously been murdered?", "correct": "The Amityville Horror", "options": ["Poltergeist", "Red Dragon", "The Rosary Murders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Amityville Horror.\n\n\tHas anyone not heard about the haunted house in Amityville?  After having dressed as a priest in \"No Way to Treat a Lady\", he played a priest in \"The Amityville Horror\" and tried to warn the Catholics that Satan lived in that house.  His boss told him to stay away from the house and take a vacation.  His brakes went out on his car.  Meanwhile, the walls of the house bled, and James Brolin felt cold all the time.  A babysitter couldn't open a closet door.  The children spoke to someone invisible. \n"}, {"text": "In what movie did a boy kill his father so he could have his mother to himself?", "correct": "Scream Bloody Murder", "options": ["Scream Blacula Scream", "Scream and Scream Again", "Scream"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScream Bloody Murder.\n\n\tHere's what happened in the first 18 minutes of \"Scream Bloody Murder\":  A boy in a field saw his father standing in front of a tractor, so he climbed in the driver seat and ran over his father.  He jumped out while the tractor was still going, and the tractor ran over the boy's left hand.  He got sent to a mental institution. Years later, the grown boy went home with a hook in place of his left hand, but his mother had remarried.  That night he killed his stepfather and pushed his mother down.  She hit her head on a rock and died.  He rode with a man and woman who just got married.  They stopped at a stream and splashed in the water and invited the killer to play with them. When the killer saw the man kiss the woman, he imagined it was his stepfather kissing his mother.  He hit the man in the head with the rock until he died and held the woman under the water until she drowned.  That's just the first 18 minutes. \n"}, {"text": "What movie began with a man telling the story about how he killed his mother when he was a boy because he saw her \"cheating\" on his father?", "correct": "Sling Blade", "options": ["Scream  Bloody Murder", "Psycho", "Blade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSling Blade.\n\n\tHow many movies have been made about men killing their mothers?  I guess it's that Freudian stuff.  This was Billy Bob's movie based on the short film about a \"Gomer Pyle\" type of goon who killed people when he was a child but got released from the mental institution and didn't know where to go or what to do.  It's funny, because I think Billy Bob Thornton looks like a combination of Andy Griffith and Don Knotts, but in this movie he was imitating Jim Nabors. \n"}, {"text": "In what movie did Christopher Walken kill his own workers just to make money?", "correct": "A View To a Kill", "options": ["The Dead Zone", "Antz", "Batman Returns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA View To a Kill.\n\n\t\"A View To a Kill\" was a James Bond movie based on a couple of short stories written by Ian Fleming.  In this movie, Walken played a result of genetic engineering, a genius who knew how to make money but didn't care about whom he killed along the way.  He flooded silicon valley, resulting in the drowning of hundreds of his own workers, but he also used an automatic weapon to kill anyone trying to escape.  The animated movie \"Antz\" had almost the same story, with ants almost drowning so the ant in charge could create a new colony, with Walken doing the voice of one of the characters. \n"}, {"text": "In what movie did a boy kill his sister after her boyfriend left?", "correct": "Halloween (1978)", "options": ["The Toolbox Murders (1978)", "When a Stranger Calls (1979)", "Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalloween (1978).\n\n\tHas anyone not heard about this by now?  I had to specify \"Halloween\" (1978) because the remake was a little bit different.  In the first movie, we saw things through the eyes of the killer, which was revealed to be a little boy in a clown suit.  Years later he escaped, and the movie followed teenage babysitters on Halloween night.  In the remake, most of the movie followed the boy as he beat a bunch of people to death, including a bully from school, his sister's boyfriend, his sister, and his stepfather. \n"}]}
