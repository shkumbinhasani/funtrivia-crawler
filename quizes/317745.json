{"id": "317745", "name": "Video Games Change-A-Letter Quiz | Video Games Wordplay | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Video Games Wordplay"], "questions": [{"text": "For example, if you have the word \"drink\", and you needed to change a letter to get a word meaning to grate, you would change the \"k\" to a \"g\" and scramble the word to make \"grind\".  All questions will relate to video games in some way, shape, or form.  Have fun and good luck.\n\nTo begin, who is the main dragon in a series of games with bosses such as the Sorceress, Gnasty Gnorc, and Red, among others?", "correct": "Spyro", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpyro.\n\n\tThe first \"Spyro\" game came out in 1998.  This purple, fire-breathing dragon needed to find all of the dragon elders and release them from their stone tombs, which were placed by Gnasty Gnorc.  Several games followed this, with several different series of games, like the \"Legend of Spyro\" series. \n"}, {"text": "Now change a letter, scramble, and give me a game that involves five different \"stages\".  These stages are the cell stage, the creature stage, the tribal stage, the civilization stage, and the space stage.  A lot of monsters are in this game, and you make them grow from a tiny little organism to a giant beast.  What game might this be?", "correct": "Spore", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpore.\n\n\t\"Spore\" was released for the Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS X in 2008.  It was developed by the creators of the \"Sims\" games.  During the cell stage, you can move your organism through the 2-D screen to defeat enemies and grow larger.  During the creature stage, you can eat plants and hunt other animals. During the tribal stage, you are given more than one creature, and a new, fully developed tribe exists.  Once you get 5 pieces of a totem pole, your tribe then becomes an entire civilization.  The tribe has grown, after all!  Now the civilization has become advanced enough to colonize other planets in the space stage!  So throughout the process of five stages, a single-celled organism is born, grows, and conquers other planets. \n"}, {"text": "This can relate to video games in many ways.  First, it can be the abilities a character has.  Second, it can be the strength of an attack from a character.  Third, it can mean some form of magic.  Finally, it can mean the button that turns the game on.  What word could this be?", "correct": "Power", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPower.\n\n\tVideo game characters usually have certain powers, or abilities, which allow them to do things throughout a level.  Sometimes this can be the power to form a shield around themselves, or the ability to jump.  It can also be the strength of an attack.  If an enemy has three hit points, and you have the power to deal one point of damage, it will take three hits to defeat them. If your power level is ten, though, it will take one hit to destroy an enemy.  Sometimes power can mean magic.  Sometimes you can harness the power of the wind, or some sort of magical power.  Finally, to turn the game on, you usually hit a power button to turn the game one. \n"}, {"text": "Many video game characters are sneaky.  Some of them are spies, some are thieves, and some just don't want to get caught.  What word, meaning \"creeping about\" do many a video game character do around their location?", "correct": "Prowl", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nProwl.\n\n\tProwling comes in handy to many.  For instance, Sly Cooper prowls around all the time to stay hidden from guards.  He sneaks around quietly, in the shadows.  He is a thief.  Countless numbers of spy games, such as \"Stolen\" or the \"James Bond\" series, involve prowling around.  One must stay hidden or they will be in sure danger. Other games, such as \"Beyond Good and Evil\", involve characters simply prowling so they don't die!  Jade, from \"Beyond Good and Evil\", is not a thief nor a spy, but she does prowl, because she does not want to be killed by the bad guys.  In some instances, if you get caught, it is an automatic lose...  You don't even get a chance to run and escape! \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes characters travel to different places, which each have several different levels.  Usually, these locations have a theme, such a desert, or winter.  Many video game characters also have a homeland.  What might one of these places be called?", "correct": "World", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld.\n\n\tWorlds usually hold several levels within them.  For instance, Mario travels through different worlds to save Princess Peach, and each of those worlds has several levels within them, including the boss level of the world.  Usually the world has a theme to it.  Another example is that of Spyro.  His home world is in the Dragon Realms, and he has traveled to many worlds, such as Avalar to help the Professor (this is where he first meets him) collect orbs. Usually, each of these worlds has many levels you must complete to move on.  The levels are found in different portals.  Once you finish all the levels, you can move on to a new world. \n"}, {"text": "This King is the archnemesis of \"Bonk the Caveman\".  Who might this character be?", "correct": "Drool", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrool.\n\n\tKing Drool is a \"tyrannical-saurus rex\", as GiantBomb.com calls it.  He is the main enemy of \"Bonk the Caveman\", but Bonk was not originally a caveman.  Something turned him into one!  The first Bonk game, \"Bonk's Adventure\", was released in 1990 on the TurboGrafx-16, and was re-released for the NES. \n"}, {"text": "Many many many games have this graphically gross feature.  Of course, it is usually red, but some monsters can have several different colors of this.  Usually, if a game is rated M, it will have this.  If it is gory, it definitely has this.  What is \"this\"?", "correct": "Blood", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlood.\n\n\tBlood is prevalent in many games.  Even some cartoonish games have animated blood.  For instance, in \"RuneScape\", when you attack something, a little red animated blotch will appear.  In other games, realistic blood pours from a body, and you can even dismember bodies in some games.  Ewww!  :-) \n"}, {"text": "In the game \"LEGO Star Wars\", you can play a whole plethora of characters.  You can even play Lando Calrissian's \"sidekick\".  He has a partly mechanical head, and his only weapon is his fists.  What character might this be?", "correct": "Lobot", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLobot.\n\n\tLobot is a part robot, part human character, known as a cyborg.  He can first be obtained in the \"Empire Strikes Back\" level of the game.  \"LEGO Star Wars\" has three different games.  These are \"LEGO Star Wars 1\", \"LEGO Star Wars 2: The Original Series\", and \"LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\", which features all six movies, a combination of both games. \n"}, {"text": "What would you call the video game characters of Clank, IG-88, Bumblebee, and Metalhead?", "correct": "Robot", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobot.\n\n\tAll of the characters mentioned are robot characters.  Clank is the sidekick of Ratchet from \"Ratchet and Clank\".  IG-88 is a droid (robot) bounty hunter from \"LEGO Star Wars\", Bumblebee, also known as Hotshot, is an Autobot from the \"Transformers\" video games, and \"Metalhead\" is the level title and the boss of the level in \"Spyro the Dragon\". \n"}, {"text": "This word can be used in many different racing video games.  Often times, you need a little bit more speed to win the race, so you need a specific item.  Sometimes these are collectible items, and sometimes they are on the the road that you can run over.  What might this be called?  (A speed ______.)", "correct": "Boost", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoost.\n\n\tSpeed boosts are common in many racing video games, and sometimes in games that simply have a vehicle in them, but are not necessarily racing games.  Speed boosts can be called many things, but they are all essentially speed boosts, no matter what they are called.  For instance, in the SNES game \"Super Off Road\", these speed boosts are called nitros. \n"}]}
