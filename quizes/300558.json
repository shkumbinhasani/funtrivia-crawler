When the storm ended, he turned east, expecting to hit land, not having realized that he had sailed beyond the tip of the continent. He eventually turned north and made landfall at Mossell Bay, between modern-day Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, on March 12, 1488. \rIt was on the return voyage, in May 1488, that Diaz finally found the Cape of Good Hope, naming it 'The Cape of Storms'. \n"}]}
