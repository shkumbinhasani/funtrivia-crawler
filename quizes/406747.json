{"id": "406747", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 28\" [4] Quiz | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 28"], "questions": [{"text": "At the start of Leg 7, teams travelled from Armenia to Georgia by which means?", "correct": "Train", "options": ["Ferry", "On foot", "Plane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrain.\n\n\tTeams left the sixth Pit Stop virtually as soon as they arrived, being handed a clue and told to commence the seventh leg without formal rest.  This meant that teams needed to hitch a ride back into Yerevan, Armenia's capital, and head to the train station to catch a midnight train to the nation of Georgia.  When teams disembarked they could make their way to the statue of St. George in Freedom Square in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.  From here, teams needed to head up through the city to Narikala Fortress and then take a gondola down to the riverside. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was the only one to initially try for the 'Clean' Detour task in Leg 7 (Georgia)?", "correct": "Sheri and Cole", "options": ["Scott and Blair", "Brodie and Kurt", "Burnie and Ashley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheri and Cole.\n\n\tOnce teams took the gondola ride down to Rike Park and the Mtkvari River, they could hop into another cab and visit the Jvari Monastery in Mtskheta to find their next cluebox waiting for them, this one containing the leg's Detour challenge.  If teams opted to take the 'Clean' Detour option, they would find themselves engrossed in Georgia's winemaking industry. For this, they needed to visit Iago's Wine in Chardakhi, Georgia and hop into a clay pot known as a kvevri, known for holding and fermenting wine, and clean it out.  Sheri and Cole alone went for this one though Dana and Matt and Tyler and Korey headed to this one later on. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 7, teams completing the 'String' Detour made traditional Georgian candy with which of these?", "correct": "Nuts", "options": ["Eggs", "Fish", "Crickets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNuts.\n\n\tIf teams chose the 'String' Detour task they stayed in the town of Mtskheta to make churchkhela, a traditional Georgian treat made by stringing twenty hazelnuts on a line and dipping it in a mixture of wine, flour, and sugar to make a sticky, sweet treat.  Once teams threaded the nuts, dipped five strings of churchkhela, and hung them out to dry, they could receive their next clue. Tyler and Korey, Brodie and Kurt, Zach and Rachel, Burnie and Ashley, Dana and Matt, and Scott and Blair all went for this task, but due to there only being four stations active at any given time and the difficulty of the task, Dana and Matt and Tyler and Korey swapped to 'Clean'. \n"}, {"text": "At the Rustaveli National Theater, racers completing the Road Block did which of the following?", "correct": "Dance", "options": ["Clean", "Act", "Sing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDance.\n\n\tCompleting their respective Detour tasks, teams raced back into the Georgian capital and to the Rustaveli National Theater for their Road Block task, perhaps the most intricate thus far on the race course.  For this, the selected team members (Zach, Ashley, Kurt, Sheri, Dana, Korey, and Scott) had to join the Georgian National Ballet and learn a complicated, intricate dance to the approval of the National Theater's choreographer. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated in Georgia at the end of Leg 7?", "correct": "Scott and Blair", "options": ["Tyler and Korey", "Dana and Matt", "Sheri and Cole"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScott and Blair.\n\n\tCompleting their Road Block task, teams could hop into a cab and head to the seventh Pit Stop of the race in Rike Park, waiting at a spot overlooking the Bridge of Peace on the Mtkvari River.  Though they left the Road Block second, Zach and Rachel were able to beat Burnie and Ashley to the Pit Stop and claim their first win of the race.  The couple won themselves a trip to Turks and Caicos courtesy of Travelocity.  Scott and Blair, who trailed for the entirety of Leg 7, stayed at back of the pack all the way to the Pit Stop and were eliminated here. \n"}, {"text": "Leg 8 saw the return of what featured item typically seen on previous seasons of the race?", "correct": "Travelocity Roaming Gnome", "options": ["Ford F1 Fusion", "Nokia cell phone", "Windows Surface tablet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTravelocity Roaming Gnome.\n\n\tStarting Leg 8, teams opened their clues and were told to head out of the chilly climes (finally) and make their way to the sweltering heat of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.  Upon landing in the Middle East they could hop into a Mitsubishi Pajero SUV and drive themselves into the Margham Sand Dunes.  Following directions through the highways of Dubai they would need to reach a marked Bedouin camp to pick up their Travelocity Roaming Gnome, their travel companion for this leg of the race, and their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Teams completing the 'Races' Detour task in Dubai needed to do so with which of these?", "correct": "Bikes", "options": ["Skis", "Rocket skis", "F1 racers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBikes.\n\n\tTeams arrived at the Bedouin camp to receive their Detour clue.  In 'Races', teams drove themselves to the town of Al Lisaili to find the Dubai Camel Race Track.  There, with their Travelocity Roaming Gnome, both team members needed to cross a finish line on a 1.2 mile course (in the searing heat) before a racing camel.  If and when they failed (and they did), they would be able to try again with a significant advantage.  Tyler and Korey, Brodie and Kurt, and Sheri and Cole took to the races. \n"}, {"text": "Teams completing the 'Oasis' Detour task in Dubai had to transport how many camels through the desert?", "correct": "Four & 4", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour & 4.\n\n\tIf teams didn't want to go to the races they could instead wander the desert in the 'Oasis' Detour option.  For this, teams drove to the Al Maha Desert where, at a marked camp, they could grab four camels and bring them through the sands on a one mile trek to another local Bedouin camp.  Once all four were delivered they could enjoy local bread and camel milk before collecting their next clue.  Dana and Matt, Burnie and Ashley, and Zach and Rachel completed this task before driving themselves to Palm Jumeirah for their next challenges. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 8, the Dubai Road Block involved completing a puzzle that spelled out what word?", "correct": "RACE", "options": ["DUBAI", "SAND", "OASIS"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRACE.\n\n\tReaching Palm Jumeirah, teams had to head to Aquaventure, the site of a classic \"Amazing Race\" moment wherein a team was eliminated (in season 15) for not going down a water slide.  This time, teams found their Road Block clue and had to change into bathing suits before embarking on a couple of tasks.  For the first, the selected team member needed to dive into a shark tank and collect a cylindrical puzzle which they would be able to bring to the surface and complete (by fitting four puzzle pieces, spelling RACE, into their slots).  After this, both team members could plummet down the Poseidon's Revenge water slide to continue racing. Brodie, Burnie, Dana, Korey, Zach, and Cole completed this task though Brodie used the Express Pass. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was last to arrive at the Pit Stop in Dubai in Leg 8?", "correct": "Sheri and Cole", "options": ["Dana and Matt", "Tyler and Korey", "Zach and Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheri and Cole.\n\n\tFinishing up at Aquaventure, teams needed to drive themselves to Dubai, parking at a specific spot and then taking an abra across the river to the Deira Old Souq Station.  Brodie and Kurt were barely able to stay ahead of Burnie and Ashley, holding onto the lead brought on by their Express Pass, and because of this they won a trip for two to Helsinki, Finland courtesy of Travelocity. Sheri and Cole, who got lost during this self-driving leg, arrived on the mat last but, once again, they were spared by a non-elimination Pit Stop.  This did mean, however, that they would face a Speed Bump in Leg 9. \n"}]}
