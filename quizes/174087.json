{"id": "174087", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Bus' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "In the opening scene we see a surgical bus driving along a dirt road across the Korean countryside.  On board the bus are several members of the M*A*S*H 4077th.  Who of the following is not among the passengers on the bus?  ", "correct": "Klinger", "options": ["Radar", "BJ", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger.\n\n\tOn board the bus are Hawkeye and his sidekick BJ, Frank Burns (who provides the entertainment), Radar and Colonel Potter.  This makes one wonder, who is in command back at the 4077th?  It surely must be Margaret, though she is never visually given command of the outfit during the series...so much for women's lib!  The doctors are returning from a conference of the '38th Parellel Medical Society', whatever that may be. \n"}, {"text": "Our friends soon discover that they have become lost, prompting Colonel Potter to command that the bus be stopped.  Which of our friends from the 4077th is driving the bus at the time it is stopped?  ", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Klinger", "Zale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tThis should have been easy for those of you who have seen the episode, especially since Klinger and Zale don't even appear!  Radar has been the designated driver, and to no one's surprise has nonchalantly navigated the gang into no man's land.  Potter orders the bus stopped and for each of the doctors, including himself, to search 100 yards from the bus in every direction.  Unfortunately, after the search they discover that they're even more lost than when they had begun! \n"}, {"text": "Potter decides that the best way to deal with a situation such as this is for the crew to retrace their steps.  Several of the crew board the bus, but Hawkeye remains outside where he spots BJ with his nose and fingers sticking out just above a dirty window.  What word(s) does Hawkeye write with his finger in the dirt caked on the window?  ", "correct": "Kilroy", "options": ["Peace", "Hi, mom", "Eat at Joe's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKilroy.\n\n\tHawkeye makes a reference to the famous phrase 'Kilroy was here', commonly written by soldiers during World War II.  In some cartoons, the phrase is written under a man whose nose and fingers are hanging just above a window or wall, just as BJ's are.  The 'M*A*S*H' writers are very good with these cultural references. \n"}, {"text": "The gang is unable to depart as the Colonel has suggested because the bus won't start.  Which member of the crew claims to know a lot about engines, having taken shop in high school?  ", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Mulcahy", "BJ", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tFrank suggests that he's something of a gearhead, but he ends up getting quite a shock when he sticks his head under the hood of the trunk.  Commanding Radar to 'turn 'er over', Frank is tossed about five feet from the bus from a nasty electric shock.  The only thing Frank hurts is his pride, however, and his nasty temper remains intact. \n"}, {"text": "Failing to get the bus restarted, a walkie-talkie is located on the bus.  Frank becomes extremely excited with this new find and immediately goes to work making calls to 'any allied personnel'.   How does Frank absurdly provide his location in his walkie-talkie message?  ", "correct": "He identifies a fighter jet flying directly over his head", "options": ["He announces that he is standing directly under the sun", "He locates a very large tree 100 feet to his north", "He suggests that he is somewhere in the center of the Korean peninsula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe identifies a fighter jet flying directly over his head.\n\n\tFrank's use of the walkie-talkie is silly to begin with because its partner is back at the 4077th, at least 20 miles away, and it's broken.  Undeterred, Frank announces his location 'directly under a fighter jet' by shouting 'Now!'  BJ responds, 'Frank, that thing is a thousand feet up and going 500 miles an hour.'  Hawkeye adds, 'By the time you said 'now', the plane was in its hangar and the pilot was in his jammies.'  Later, Frank locates himself directly under the brightest star in the sky, further accenting his idiocy. \n"}, {"text": "In the bus that evening before they go to sleep our friends share stories about their first loves.  What was the name of the French woman that Potter fell in love with when he was stricken blind during World War I?  ", "correct": "Colette", "options": ["Corinne", "Camille", "Celeste"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColette.\n\n\tWow, now that was a tough one, my apologies!  Potter claims to have been struck blind temporarily after the battle at Chateau-Thierry, and spent a month in convalescence under the care of a nurse named Colette.  He fell in love with her voice, suggesting that it helped him through the darkness of his month-long blindness.  When his bandages came off after the long month he claims to have pretended he was still blind, suggesting that Colette's physical appearance did not match her voice. \n"}, {"text": "Frank's 'love story' comes after Colonel Potter's.  He claims to have become stranded with a young woman named Helen Rappaport while still in high school (and prior to meeting his future wife).  Did Frank 'oblige' (Potter's word) Helen at that time?  ", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tFrank claims that Helen was 'really warm for [his] form', one of my favorite lines from him.  He could not 'oblige' Helen, however, because, to put it in Frank's term, he did not 'approve of that sort of happiness before marriage'.  Under his breath Potter calls Frank a 'creep' at this point.  Poor Frank; even in a bonding moment he manages to turn people off with his stumbling and bumbling. \n"}, {"text": "Radar goes missing after having left the bus momentarily to relieve himself.  What does Frank do vis-a-vis this situation that particularly irritates Hawkeye and BJ?  ", "correct": "He talks of Radar in the past tense", "options": ["He refuses to participate in the search for Radar", "He suggests they abandon Radar and return to camp", "He concludes that Radar is not an altogether very useful soldier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe talks of Radar in the past tense.\n\n\tRadar disappears for quite a spell after leaving the bus, but returns later while Frank is guarding a Korean soldier who has been captured (actually, Frank has been sleeping on the job).  Radar claims to have left the bus to search for 'help', but in reality his disappearance is related to the idea of creating suspense for the viewer (at least, that's my cynical assessment). \n"}, {"text": "That evening in the bus the doctors 'capture' a Korean soldier who has been wounded.  They spend the evening taking turns watching over the enemy soldier.  The next morning their vigilance pays off when the Korean soldier performs what task?  ", "correct": "He gets the bus started again", "options": ["He guides them back to the 4077th", "He provides them with a meal at his nearby home", "He negotiates with some North Korean soldiers who wish to take the doctors captive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe gets the bus started again.\n\n\tApparently, this Korean fellow is not only a soldier, but also a mechanic.  He is played by the very familiar actor (for fans of 'M*A*S*H', at least) Soon Teck Oh.  Soon Teck Oh plays about six different characters during the run of the show.  Oddly enough, the final scene in the show depicts Frank continuing to attempt to contact someone with the walkie-talkie, but this time the other walkie-talkie is on board the bus, working and in the hands of the Korean soldier.  So much for continuity! \n"}, {"text": "The following morning the doctors are very hungry, but they haven't packed a thing to eat.  Much to the delight of all, it is revealed that Frank has a stash of what type of treat in his backpack?  ", "correct": "Chocolate bars", "options": ["Raisin cookies", "Fudge", "Brownies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate bars.\n\n\tFrank has been munching away at his chocolate bars while the rest of the gang is not looking.  Radar happens to notice Frank's stash and, in an underhanded fashion, convinces Frank to provide a bar for each member of the outfit, including the captured Korean soldier.  I hope you have enjoyed this quiz and will try more of my 'M*A*S*H'-related quizzes in the future...thank you for playing. \n"}]}
