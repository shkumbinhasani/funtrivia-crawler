{"id": "188891", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'The Winchester Tapes' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "As we fade into 'The Winchester Tapes', who else do we see but Major Winchester dictating a taped message to his family back in Boston.  Naturally, Charles is expressing his misery at being in Korea, and has suggested desperate measures to extricate himself from his current predicament.  Which of these does Charles express that he has contemplated?", "correct": "Shooting himself in the foot", "options": ["Appealing to Harry Truman (a Democrat!) himself", "Feigning insanity", "Switching identities and going AWOL"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShooting himself in the foot.\n\n\tThe only thing that apparently has stopped Charles from shooting himself in the foot is his desire to attend future annual debs cotillions (that's short for 'debutante', in case you were curious).  Charles did mention that his father knew Harry Truman in the episode 'Fade In, Fade Out', and already used the threat of contacting him in that episode. \n"}, {"text": "As Charles is dictating his tapes Klinger arrives with the mail.  Hawkeye and BJ also appear at this point, perhaps having smelled whiff of mail call.  Hawkeye receives a letter from a certain Nurse Gilmore, who has invited him to Seoul for a not-so-secret rendezvous.  According to Charles, why will Hawkeye be unable to make this engagement?", "correct": "He has Officer of the Day duties", "options": ["He has to pull double shifts in the O.R.", "He already has an appointment at the M*A*S*H 8063rd", "He owes Charles the rest of his next paycheck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has Officer of the Day duties.\n\n\tMuch to Hawkeye's glee, Nurse Gilmore was engaged, but has broken it off.  According to Hawkeye, Nurse Gilmore has 'grace, wit, sensibility, intelligence and charm', which makes it all the more surprising to Charles that she would be interested in Hawkeye.  Charles generously decides to acquire Hawkeye's O.D. duty for the weekend, but only because it will provide him with a three-day vacation from Hawkeye. \n"}, {"text": "After Hawkeye and BJ depart, Charles continues with his message home.  His monologue turns to Colonel Potter, who Charles grudgingly admires for which of the following traits?", "correct": "His painting skills", "options": ["His way with words", "His love of horses", "His taste in food and drink"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis painting skills.\n\n\tThough Colonel Potter is 'responsible for [Charles'] presence in this cesspool (aka, the 4077th)', Charles has chosen to endear himself to the good Colonel.  He describes Potter as a 'tough, bandy-legged little mustang' who paints serviceably, for a primitive.  Charles has agreed to sit for one of Colonel Potter's paintings, and the final result is rather amusing.  Charles complains so much that Potter portrays him angry-faced, mouth agape. \n"}, {"text": "Charles' soliloquy nexts turns to Radar, who we find providing some supplies to a wounded soldier in the post-op ward.  Radar is well-known for his celebrity impressions.  Which of these actors, famous for his roles in 'High Sierra' and 'Sabrina', does Radar imitate in this episode?", "correct": "Humphrey Bogart", "options": ["William Holden", "James Cagney", "Montgomery Clift"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHumphrey Bogart.\n\n\tRadar provides a few extra t-shirts to a young soldier that he has swiped from the officer's supply room.  He requests that the soldier keep quiet about it, as he does not want to miss Saturday's movie as punishment.  It seems that the movie that weekend will star Bogart, though no title is given.  Radar then does his impression of Bogart: 'Waiter, if me and the boys wanted to eat mucilage, we would have ordered mucilage.'  \r I certainly wouldn't want to eat mucilage, would you? \n"}, {"text": "In another scene, this one involving both Charles and Radar, Charles attempts to make amends for mistreating the diminutive company clerk.  What gift does Charles bring in order to mollify/bribe Radar?", "correct": "A case of Grape Nehi", "options": ["A stack of Captain Marvel comic books", "A second teddy bear", "A rabbit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA case of Grape Nehi.\n\n\tCharles claims that the case of Grape Nehi is meant as a peace offering in conjunction with his apology for mistreating the poor little lad.  In reality, Charles simply wants to bribe Radar into making a call to Colonel Baldwin in Tokyo.  When Radar refuses to break Colonel Potter's orders not to call Baldwin, Charles cruelly takes the Grape Nehi away. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye, now freed of his previous obligation, prepares himself for three days of bliss in Seoul.  What item does he ask to borrow from both BJ and Charles?", "correct": "Pajamas", "options": ["Dinner jacket", "Cologne", "Nail clippers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPajamas.\n\n\tBJ hasn't got any pajamas to loan Hawkeye, he lost his only pair along with his 'faith, hope, sanity' and 'a liver'.  Charles has a pair, but refuses to loan them to Hawkeye.  In a tussle over the pajama pants, they are damaged (torn in half, really).  Once the damage is done, Charles, with utter generosity, gives them to Hawkeye. \n"}, {"text": "Next on Charles' discussion list is Margaret, whom Charles describes as 'part seductress, part ______________'.  (Choose the proper name for the blank.)", "correct": "Attila the Hun", "options": ["Jack the Ripper", "Adolf Hitler", "Genghis Khan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttila the Hun.\n\n\tThe scene shifts to the O.R. where Charles has just completed some difficult surgery on a patient's liver.  Margaret has served as his nurse in the operation, and cannot stop complimenting Charles for both his surgical skill and his wit.  While in conversation, Margaret suddenly has something caught in her eye and asks Charles to 'investigate'.  As he looks into her eye, their faces nearly meet.  It's at this point that Father Mulcahy walks into the room and finds the two majors in this compromising position. \n"}, {"text": "Of his two tentmates, Charles appears to find a certain preference for BJ, a 'relatively inoffensive chap', as he calls him.  Little does Charles know that BJ is a compulsive practical joker who has been switching different sizes of which of Charles' clothing items?", "correct": "Pants", "options": ["Shoes", "Shirts", "Hats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPants.\n\n\tOf late, BJ has been showing concern for Charles' weight, or so he has led on.  In reality, BJ simply has been manipulating Charles in order to better cajole him into his mischievous little ruse.  You see, BJ has been switching Charles' pants, giving him a larger waist size one week, followed by a smaller waist size the next.  To add insult to injury, BJ bemusedly announces to Hawkeye that, 'Starting tomorrow, he gets taller.' \n"}, {"text": "The 4077th seems to be inundated with wounded soldiers during this episode.  Is Hawkeye ever able to make it to Seoul for his date with Nurse Gilmore during the episode?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAs with previous episodes, when time is of the essence, time (and exhaustion) usually win out.  Hawkeye is stuck at the 4077th after a fresh shipment of wounded interrupts his plans to head for Seoul.  Hawkeye plasters a soldier's foot, and before BJ is able to take over, he has to report once again for surgery.  When the O.R. session is finally over Hawkeye is so exhausted that he falls asleep in the Swamp.  Klinger brings Hawkeye's jeep but is unable to revive the good Captain. \n"}, {"text": "Charles ends his taped message as the episode closes out.  What final annoyance does Charles endure, causing him to raise his voice in desperation to close out his note home?", "correct": "A rubber chicken in his teapot", "options": ["A mustache painted on his mother's photo", "Nudist pictures inserted into his copy of 'David Copperfield'", "Oatmeal in his bedroom slippers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA rubber chicken in his teapot.\n\n\tEarlier, BJ had been shining up this rubber chicken in a foreshadowing scene.  BJ's jocular coup de gr\u00e2ce is the placement of this chicken comfortably within Charles' delicate little teapot.  Charles is rather calm as he begins his final sentence, 'Now, mother and dad, I will put this as eloquently and succinctly as possible...'  He then discovers the rubber chicken, prompting him to finish his message, 'Get me the hell out of here!'\r I hope you enjoyed this quiz and will try more of my 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff.  Thanks you. \n"}]}
