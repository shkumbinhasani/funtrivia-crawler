B. Franke, wife of the Secretary of the Navy, and commissioned 25 November 1961, Captain V. P. de Poix in command. \r The previous Enterprise (CV-6) was involved at Pearl Harbor, but not as a potential target. It was headed back to Hawaii from Wake Island during the attack. Enterprise scout planes arrived over Pearl Harbor during the attack and, though surprised, immediately went into action in defense of the naval base. The carrier, meanwhile, assembled her remaining aircraft in a fruitless search for the Japanese striking force. The first Enterprise, a British supply sloop commandeered by Revolutionaries, was commanded by Benedict Arnold. (Quite valiantly, too. This was years before his treachery.)\r USS Enterprise (CVN-65) was inactivated on December 1, 2012.  After the inactivation process, she was officially decommissioned on February 3, 2017.  She served the US Navy for over 55 years.\r As of January 2018, a new Gerald Ford-class aircraft carrier will be given the name \"Enterprise\".
