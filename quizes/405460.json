{"id": "405460", "name": "\"Loki\" - Season 1 Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "L"], "questions": [{"text": "Loki created a branched timeline when he stole the Tesseract at what point in time?", "correct": "The Battle of New York", "options": ["The Battle of Wakanda", "The Battle of Sokovia", "The Battle of Titan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Battle of New York.\n\n\tThough the Avengers stopped Loki from securing the Tesseract during the Battle of New York (as depicted in \"The Avengers\"), the events of \"Avengers: Endgame\" complicated matters.  In an effort to reclaim the Tesseract from their moment in time, a contingent of time-travelling Avengers made an effort to nab the Space Stone only to be foiled by the trickster who, in the chaos, absconded with the case containing the Infinity Stone and created a divergent timeline.\r Loki emerges in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia and within moments he's set upon by armed members of the Time Variance Authority who, emerging from portals to another time and place, take Loki into custody for being a Variant responsible for creating his branching timeline-- a violation of the Sacred Timeline.  They reset the timeline on their way out, taking the Tesseract as evidence, before taking Loki to their offices. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is the mascot of the Time Variance Authority?", "correct": "Miss Minutes", "options": ["Miss Taken", "Miss Manage", "Miss Placed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiss Minutes.\n\n\tAfter accounting for all of the formalities of his imprisonment (including confirming his status as a real being and verifying the entire history of his speech), Loki is asked to take a number and get in line before judgment.  It's during this time that a recorded video-- hosted by a clock mascot by the name of Miss Minutes-- explains the situation.\r In the Time Variance Authority, he'll stand trial for his crimes.  The Time-Keepers, who oversee all timelines, emerged in the Multiverse to make sense of the chaos of space and time.  To do this, they reorganized all into a sacred, singular timeline.  Sometimes, however, Variants diverge from this timeline (sometimes by accident) to create a Nexus-- a point at which the multiverse can spiral into madness and, eventually, a multiversal war.  The TVA is there to step in and fix time for everyone's sake.\r Meanwhile, in Aix-en-Provence, France in the year 1549, TVA agent Mobius M. Mobius investigates the deaths of a group of Variant Hunters.  It appears, to him, that the Variant got the jump on them; it's the sixth such attack of the week.  His investigation comes up with few clues-- only the notion of a devil and a bit of evidence, a pack of blue Kablooie brand gum.\r This is why when Loki is brought before judge Ravonna Renslayer, Mobius steps in to stop the trickster god from digging himself in too deep with the blame game.  Though Renslayer deems him guilty and sentences him to be reset, Mobius presents the evidence of his case and decides to make use of the unexpected help that's fallen into the TVA's hands.  With that, they head to the Time Theater. \n"}, {"text": "Loki discovers that the TVA is hunting a rogue Variant through multiple timelines.  This Variant is responsible for which of these?", "correct": "Killing TVA forces", "options": ["Killing the Avengers", "Killing other versions of Loki", "Collecting the Infinity Stones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKilling TVA forces.\n\n\tMobias seats Loki in the Time Theater and asks some questions before showing the extent of the TVA's powers.  Loki admits to wanting to claim the throne and assume control of Midgard...and then Asgard and the Nine Realms.  If he rules, Loki claims, he can free people from shame, uncertainty, and regret.  There's a problem with this, however, and as Mobius shows Loki a sampling of his 'greatest hits', he comes to realize the issues that result from Loki getting his way.  Because Loki diverged from the timeline, he never had the chance to attempt to side with Thor and defeat Malekith, an event that would have happened after his mother Frigga's death on Asgard.  He never would have died at Thanos' hand either, as would have been intended as per the Sacred Timeline.  As a Variant he can't be left to create a divergent timeline otherwise the multiverse would spiral out of control and the great people of the Sacred Timeline would not reach their full potential.  On top of this, as Loki realizes, there's no going back; his actual self remains in the Sacred Timeline operating normally.\r What he can do, however, is find a way to make good while he can, at least by helping Mobius.  And as Mobius explains, something is amiss-- someone, a fugitive Variant, is killing the TVA's minutemen and he can help.  Interestingly, the Variant they're hunting is...him.\r In Salina, Oklahoma in the year 1858, a group of TVA agents encounter a figure from the third millennium; they're unable to prune the divergent timeline in time and the Variant escapes with their technology.\r In Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 1985, the Variant strikes again, this time kidnapping one of the TVA agents (C-20) and killing the others before leaving out a Timedoor.  When Loki arrives on the scene with Mobius, the action is done.  He assists in what ways he can, but his chief aim is to gain audience with the Time-Keepers to plead his case and prevent being reset.  Mobius has this timeline reset as they depart it. \n"}, {"text": "Loki deduces that his hunted Variant is hiding in which of these moments in the Sacred Timeline?", "correct": "Apocalyptic events", "options": ["Large, public events", "Key moments of peace", "The aftermath of great wars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApocalyptic events.\n\n\tMobius spends a bit of time with Judge Ravonna Renslayer who, as he knows, is not a fan of Loki.  This being said, Ravonna is aware that the Time-Keepers have great interest in the case due to the implications surrounding it.  They want this unique Variant caught at all costs, but Mobius only gets one more chance with this Loki.  This is why Mobius leaves Loki with old case files; maybe he can unearth something the TVA missed.\r Although most files are classified for Loki's sake, he does come to some notable conclusions, especially after he locates information about the destruction of Asgard due to Ragnarok (in the Sacred Timeline).  He informs Mobius that the answer isn't in the files, but the timeline, specifically in apocalyptic events.  Nexus events happen when someone creates a split timeline, ultimately cascading into a multiverse.  The Variant could do anyone that they want in that scenario because, regardless, the apocalypse would still need to happen; no one would go looking in those moments.\r When the duo head back in time to key apocalypses, they find that the theory holds water.  In doomsday moments, there's no variance in the timeline, even if someone tries to instigate those moments.  Mobius remembers the gum he received from sixteenth-century France-- Kablooie-- and they're able to cross-check the date of its sale (the 2050s) with apocalyptic events.\r This leads them to a hurricane in Haven Hills, Alabama in the year 2050, where Mobius believes the Variant might be hiding out.  Though Ravonna is resistant to the idea due to Loki's involvement, she lets the duo take a task force to the scene-- a Roxxcart Superstore.  Their suspicions are confirmed when the Variant attacks upon the squad's arrival, controlling the minds of hiding locals and TVA squad leader Hunter B-15 to get the upper hand.\r Loki tries to be diplomatic with his Variant, suggesting that if they work together, they can overthrow the Time-Keepers.  They're not interested, however.\r Mobius locates the kidnapped agent, C-20, in the surveillance room, but it's a bit too late.  The Variant stalls for enough time to hook up all of their stolen reset charges, detonate them at multiple newly-created nexus points on the Sacred Timeline, and trigger what will become an unfathomable multiverse.  While Variant Loki escapes out a Time Door, Loki follows behind as it closes, sending the pair to the TVA. \n"}, {"text": "In order to recharge the stolen TemPad, Loki and Sylvie plan to utilize the power of which of these?", "correct": "Spaceship", "options": ["Kinetic force", "Reset charges", "Nuclear bomb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpaceship.\n\n\tThe Variant Loki, actually named Sylvie, having kidnapped TVA agent C-20, brought her to Haven Hills, Alabama solely for information.  By creating a false front in her mind, she strived to extract the information about where and how the Time-Keepers were guarded.  And she did so with minimal effort too, simply prodding with grace and calmness.  That was moments before Loki and Mobius arrived at Roxxcart.\r When she passes through the Time Door, she doesn't notice Loki following behind.  He catches up quick enough for them to start fighting, but not quick enough to prevent being intercepted by Ravonna Renslayer, who gives him no choice but to use the stolen TVA device to send himself and the Variant through another Time Door, this time to the moon of Lamentis-1 in the year 2077, just as it's being rained-down upon by a just-destroyed, adjacent planet.  And there's no way back either-- the device runs out of battery when they arrive.\r The pair are forced to work together to survive, even if they don't admit to it.  As they take shelter, they come to a truce, at the very least, to recharge the TemPad.  They find a solution in the form of a spaceship expected to leave Lamentis-1 known as 'the ark', but the trip there is a long one that only causes more problems.  Not only do they have run-ins with the locals, fighting for their lives, but a ride on a last-minute train results in the TemPad being broken outright.\r The alternative, they decide, is leaving on the Ark itself, and they try to do that...before it's struck by a meteor.  Naturally, this leaves the pair stranded on a planetary body anticipating complete annihilation.  Their time together on the moon, however, doesn't come without an effect.  In sharing the day together, the two form a unique bond and, as they are both Variants, they create a new, severe Nexus event.  It means the TVA can find them and recapture them.  At least it gets them off of Lamentis-1, and not a moment too soon. \n"}, {"text": "Sylvie informs Loki that all workers at the TVA are actually which of these?", "correct": "Variants", "options": ["Androids", "Lokis", "Interdimensional beings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVariants.\n\n\tWhen Sylvie was young she was captured by none other than Ravonna Renslayer for what would become a crime against the Sacred Timeline.  Ripped straight from Asgard, she would be kept at the TVA until she stole Renslayer's TemPad during her trial.  She spent years on the run; everywhere she went set off a Nexus event.  Sylvie also determined, through encountering and enchanting TVA forces, that most grunt workers of the TVA are actually also Variants (running counter to what Mobius told Loki about the workers being created by the Time-Keepers).  \r Renslayer, seeking guidance from the Time-Keepers, struggles with having let Sylvie get away again.  Mobius begs to speak to hunter C-20, who the squad retrieved from Haven Hills, but Renslayer claims it's impossible; she died due to Sylvie's enchantment powers.  The truth is that this wasn't the case, and Mobius, through interrogating Loki in the Time Theater, comes to doubt the TVA's motives.  When he sneaks a look at Renslayer's TemPad, he gets the truth that Loki warned him of.  C-20 had to die, but only because she knew the truth about the Variants under the TVA's employ.\r At the same time, B-15, guarding Sylvie's room, lets the pieces fall into place.  Having been enchanted like C-20 in Haven Hills, she too came to discover her true nature.  She brings Sylvie back to Alabama in the year 2050 to use her powers and learn more about her life before the TVA.\r Mobius, learning about C-20, frees Loki from the Time Theater but Renslayer is aware of their plan to escape; she immediately has Mobius pruned from the timeline before hauling Loki to the Time-Keepers' chamber for final judgement.  Their verdict: he should be pruned to save the Sacred Timeline. \n"}, {"text": "Where do people go when they are pruned?", "correct": "The Void", "options": ["The Multiverse", "Home", "The TVA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Void.\n\n\tThe only one who can save Loki (and Sylvie) from the Time-Keepers is B-15 who, as the Time-Keepers announce their verdict and sic the minutemen on the duo, frees them from their bindings to let them fight.  Though B-15 is knocked out, the Lokis manage to get the upper hand; Sylvie is even able to behead one of the Time-Keepers who's revealed to be nothing but an android.  Though Sylvie pulls back the curtain ever so slightly, the action gives Renslayer the chance to prune Loki herself.  He vanishes in front of Sylvie without his getting the chance to tell her how he feels about her.\r But it leaves the two women in each others' company, and Sylvie demands answers.  Renslayer admits to not knowing who's truly behind the TVA, but she does know that something doesn't add up.  When the TVA destroys a branch timeline, it's not actually destroyed.  Instead, it's transferred to the Void at the end of time where all the timelines converge.  Whatever the reason, nothing comes back from the Void.\r Renslayer utilizes Miss Minutes to help dredge up information about the beginning of time and the TVA, at least to start understanding, but Sylvie picks up on her plan quickly; it's all an attempt to delay until the minutemen arrive.  Sylvie, fortunately, is able to snag Renslayer's TemPad before pruning herself and travelling to the Void.  It's certainly the only lead she has.  After all, the creator of the TVA could only be hiding on the other side of the end of time, blocked by whatever is beyond the Void.\r All Renslayer can do at this point is hunt for answers, and for that, she asks Miss Minutes to help her reach the being behind the TVA. \n"}, {"text": "Which Variant of Loki sacrifices themselves to distract the Alioth?", "correct": "Classic Loki", "options": ["Alligator Loki", "Kid Loki", "President Loki"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClassic Loki.\n\n\tLoki is perfectly fine, despite being pruned.  He awakens somewhere completely different, surrounded by other Lokis of all sorts, and that somewhere different turns out to be the Void, where people go when they've been pruned from the Sacred Timeline.  Loki's Variants give him the information and help he needs, but they have very little time due to the pursuit of a being known only as Alioth, a living tempest that consumes matter and energy.  Truly, the Lokis have very little plan besides avoiding certain death.\r At least that's how it seems from the start.  When they descend into their bunker, it's clear that the Lokis have it out for one another.  While Boastful Loki defects from the group for another set of Lokis, the remainder leave, but not before a fight breaks out.\r At the same time, Sylvie, having pruned herself, awakens somewhere else in the Void.  The Alioth is quick to locate her out in the open and she finds that she can enchant it, but not with her existing strength.  She's only saved at the last moment by Mobius who, having survived this long, drives by in a pizza delivery vehicle.\r As all parties converge on the Alioth, they unexpectedly reunite and decide upon a plan of attack.  This starts with Sylvie handing over the TemPad and sending Mobius back to the TVA to compel the minutemen into action.\r As for the Alioth, Sylvie plans to enchant it, much to the other Lokis' surprise.  She knows, however, that she needs help.  And that's why while Loki and Sylvie combine their powers to overcome the beast, Classic Loki uses his enhanced abilities to create a masterful illusion of Asgard to distract it at the cost of his own life.  It's enough though, and Loki and Sylvie bring down the barrier that can presumably bring them to the creator of the TVA.  As soon as the Alioth is diffused into nothingness, all that remains is a distant fortress. \n"}, {"text": "What do Sylvie and Loki reach when they vanquish the Alioth?", "correct": "The Citadel at the End of Time", "options": ["The Quantum Realm", "The Dark Dimension", "The Astral Dimension"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Citadel at the End of Time.\n\n\tLoki and Sylvie advance through the portal in the Void and onward to the building inside-- the Citadel at the End of Time-- and when they reach the front door it opens as though someone inside has been awaiting their arrival.  Sure enough, they're met by none other than...Miss Minutes, who lets them know that He Who Remains is impressed.  In fact, He Who Remains believes there's a way to reinsert the pair, together, into the Sacred Timeline without destroying it, and the TVA can keep doing their invaluable work.  Neither of the pair are too enthralled with the idea as they wish to create their own future.\r He Who Remains appears before the duo when they reach his chambers and he casually shows a small extent of his powers before welcoming them to his office for a drink.  They can't kill him, he says, because he already knows what's going to happen.  He's seen it all; everything about their lives and scheming.  They're only there because he allowed it.  He has everything that's going to happen ready for them as well.  There's only one thing that can happen.\r In the TVA, Renslayer is also met by Miss Minutes who hands over some pertinent info from He Who Remains before departing.  It's shortly after this that Mobius returns to her office, having spread the word about the TVA's agents being Variants.  Ravonna, packing her things, uses the TemPad to leave the TVA in search of free will.\r In Fremont, Ohio, a set-free Hunter B-15 searches the halls of a 2018 high school with agents on her tail.  It's there, in the office, that she reveals a Variant of Renslayer by the name of Rebecca Tourminet. \n"}, {"text": "He Who Remains is killed by who of the following?", "correct": "Sylvie", "options": ["Loki", "Renslayer", "Mobius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSylvie.\n\n\tHe Who Remains is honest with Loki and Sylvie, claiming that what he's most afraid of, especially if the TVA is brought down, is himself, as he has been a ruler, a conquerer, and more.  Eons ago, before the TVA, a Variant of himself lived on Earth in the 31st century.  He theorized the multiverse while other versions of himself did the same in their versions of the universe.  They connected and for a while there was peace, but not every version of him was quite pure of heart.  It meant that the peace between realities would lead to all-out war.  The first Variant-- himself-- encountered the Alioth and weaponized it to end the multiversal war, and when he did that he secured the Sacred Timeline and used the TVA to ensure that no branching timelines were formed, ensuring cosmic harmony.  If they think he's the devil, he says, then they won't want to meet his Variants.\r There's two options, according to He Who Remains.  The first option is that they kill him, but if that happens, they have an infinite number of him out in the multiverse.  The other option is that Loki and Sylvie run the TVA from his seat.  But as he lays these options out he realizes that they've crossed the threshold.  He lied a slight bit when he said he knew everything; in reality he knew everything up until about seven seconds prior, at which point, the Sacred Timeline started to branch on its own.\r Sylvie refuses to believe He Who Remains, believing instead that all of the lies are just a game.  She relentlessly tries to kill him, but Loki stops her, believing the man to be telling the truth.  There's clearly a gambit, but they can't risk unleashing something worse.  She doesn't trust Loki though, assuming that he wants the throne.  The two fight, but Sylvie gets the upper hand when Loki tries to convince her she needs to stop; she sends him back to the TVA with her TemPad, leaving her alone in the Citadel to do what she will.\r Sylvie kills a thrilled He Who Remains, who warns her that he'll see her soon.  Outside the window, the Sacred Timeline fractures to an irreparable extent.\r In the TVA, Mobius and Hunter B-15 watch as their machines indicate the worst.  When Loki reunites with them in the headquarters, the building is already in red alert.  There's a problem though-- neither of them recognize Loki...because he's not in his original universe.  A statue in the library indicates that He Who Remains has already made his mark. \n"}]}
