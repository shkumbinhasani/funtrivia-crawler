{"id": "98057", "name": "More 'M'agical Art Terms Quiz / Test | Art | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Art Terms"], "questions": [{"text": "This is the term used to describe the style of later Renaissance artists such as Parmigianino, Pontormo and El Greco.  What is this 'ism' that begins with 'M'?  \n", "correct": "Mannerism", "options": ["Modernism", "Mysticism", "Muralism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMannerism.\n\n\tThe term 'Mannerism' derives from the Italian 'Maniera', meaning 'style'.  Vasari was the first to widely employ the term in reference to the decline from the period of the High Renaissance in which artists, reacting against the High Renaissance art, showed signs of exaggeration and artificiality in their works.  Parmigianino's 'Madonna with the Long Neck' is an excellent example, as we can see the Virgin's extended neck and a disproportionate Child in her arms. \n"}, {"text": "Employed by artists such as Oldenburg and Calder, this 'M' describes art works which are planned to be produced in unlimited numbers, making them available to any collector who wished have them.  What is this commonly used term?  \n", "correct": "Multiples", "options": ["Modals", "Modules", "Montypes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMultiples.\n\n\tThe process involved the production of a work that can be reproduced by industrial processes an unlimited number of times.  Some in the arts community have disparaged this phenomenon, claiming that craftsmanship is discarded in favor of mass-production.  My goodness, though...wouldn't you love to have a Calder mobile hanging from your ceiling...or an Oldenberg lipstick sculpture to lean against in your bathroom? \n"}, {"text": "During the process of producing this artform, glass pieces called 'tesserae' might be used.  To which art form am I referring?  \n", "correct": "Mosaic", "options": ["Majolica", "Millefiori", "Maquetry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMosaic.\n\n\tMosaics have been in existence for thousands of years, but the most well-known mosaics were created during Roman imperial times, when many families had great mosaics created on the floors of their homes. \n"}, {"text": "Something like a 'collage', this 'M' refers to a collection of ready-made images that are fragmented, arranged and assembled in order to form a coherent message to the viewer.  What is such a work called?  \n", "correct": "Montage", "options": ["Molding", "Muntin", "Monochromaty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMontage.\n\n\tIn popular culture, photomontages are probably the most common form...sometimes tastefully done, I might add...sometimes... \n"}, {"text": "Which term describes the architectural style of Moslems who remained in Spain during the period of the Reconquest?  \n", "correct": "Mud\u00e9jar", "options": ["Moz\u00e1rabe", "Muezzin", "Mihrab"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMud\u00e9jar.\n\n\tMud\u00e9jar was a term which was used for the Moslems themselves, and the style developed from a combination of traditional Arab styles and the popular Gothic architecture of the day.  As you might have guessed, Moz\u00e1rabe is the opposite phenomenon (arts of the Christians in Spain under Muslim rule). \n"}, {"text": "This term was coined by Marcel Duchamp in 1932 to describe the Kinetic sculptures of Alexander Calder.  What term did the very creative Duchamp use to describe Calder's fun works?  \n", "correct": "Mobile", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMobile.\n\n\tAnd if 'mobile' isn't fun enough, how about 'stabile'...the term used to describe Calder's stationary, ground or floor-based works.  Mobiles have now become a part of our housing decor, just look in any baby's crib if you don't believe that! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these terms is used to describe ancient tombs of Egypt which existed prior to the Great Pyramids?  \n", "correct": "Mastabas", "options": ["Minarets", "Madrasahs", "Muddeqats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMastabas.\n\n\tMastabas were single step architectural forms used to house the bodies of the Pharaohs.  The first step pyramid was developed by stacking mastabas, ever diminishing in size, one on top of the other...for example the pyramid of Djoser, designed by his royal architect Imhotep. \n"}, {"text": "One of these architectural terms refers to the central hall or main area of an ancient Mycenean house...but which one?  \n", "correct": "Megaron", "options": ["Megalith", "Megaman", "Megafor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMegaron.\n\n\tThe Megaron is characterized by containing the central hearth of an ancient Mycenean home, and also frequently has a pillared porch.  Some excellent examples of these ancient architectural constructs still remain for us today. \n"}, {"text": "A trend in modern art, artists within this genre attempt to reduce their subject matter to simple geometric forms and reduce their own personal expression to the point of unrecognizability.  What is this 'M' movement called?  \n", "correct": "Minimal art", "options": ["Metaphysical art", "Mind over matter art", "Minute art"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinimal art.\n\n\tMinimalists existed in the early decades of the 20th century, for example Kasimir Malevich, but the Minimal art movement really came to fruition in the 60s and 70s with artists like Flavin, Judd and Kelly.  Many have rejected the Minimalist trend, claiming that art must include some form of self-expression...but I find some of the Minimalist works fascinating. \n"}, {"text": "Within the ancient Doric Order, this 'M' is a space between two triglyphs along the frieze.  Which of these words would meet this description?  \n", "correct": "Metope", "options": ["Maculature", "Median", "Module"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMetope.\n\n\tThe word 'metope' means 'opening between' in Greek, which makes sense!  The metopes were frequently decorated with relief sculptures, and some spectacular examples can be found in any of the great museums with some of the spoils of Ancient Greece.
