{"id": "406056", "name": "Seemingly Useless \"Resident Evil 3\" Items Online Trivia  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis"], "questions": [{"text": "The first major item needed to secure a passage through Raccoon City is the Fire Hose which can be found in which Uptown location?", "correct": "Kite Bros. Railway Building", "options": ["Donut Shop", "Uncle Toy Store", "Subway Entrance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKite Bros. Railway Building\n\n\tYour very first destination (upon escaping Jill Valentine's Downtown apartment) will be the Uptown streets, and this means navigating waves of zombies as they emerge from the rubble of Raccoon City.  Though there will be many locations you can explore (some which need tools to access), your aim will be to get into an alleyway to gain access to a Repair Shop. The catch is that this way is blocked by a raging fire, and the only way to put it out is a Fire Hose that you can attach to a nearby hydrant.  The hose is in the Kite Bros Railway Building.  Once you use it, you won't need it again-- you have bigger fires to put out. \n"}, {"text": "How many Fuses does Jill need to collect from sub-generators in the hospital's Underground Storage?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Five", "Two", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tWhen Jill arrives in the office of this late-stage area, she'll find out that the elevator in the Underground Warehouse often blows its fuses, and it shouldn't take long for this foreshadowing to become a reality as her time here will be spent collecting three labelled fuses from the room's sub-generators to clear her path.  This area is fraught with enemies found from almost all areas of the game (and a new one!) so she'll have to use all weapons at her disposal to get what she needs and and return to where she saw Nicholai waiting for her. \n"}, {"text": "What do you combine with the Electronic Gadget in the RPD Building?", "correct": "Battery", "options": ["Clock", "USB Dongle", "Red Wire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBattery.\n\n\tYou'll get the opportunity, in this game, to visit the Raccoon City Police Department-- one of the main locations featured in \"Resident Evil 2\", and because of that you'll encounter a handful of items, locations, and foes as Carlos which may seem familiar if you've played through that game.  Some of these items you need to find include the Battery and Electronic Gadget, both of which combine to create the Detonator that you use to blow up the wall in the Shower Room.  By the time Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield visit the building later in the night, that wall is already broken open. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these can be made with Explosive A and Explosive B?", "correct": "Flame Rounds", "options": ["Acid Rounds", "Mine Rounds", "Explosive Rounds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlame Rounds.\n\n\tAn invoice from the Gun Shop Kendo found in a Sewer Office will lay the facts out for you.  Explosives can be hard to come by in Raccoon City if you're not resourceful, but a mix of A and B (no, seriously) can help you out of a jam.  Two of Explosive A will create Explosive Rounds; two of Explosive B will create Acid Rounds; one of each will make Flame Rounds.  Fortunately for you, the MGL Grenade Launcher is found in the same room as this helpful document, so you can start calling those shots as soon as you get it. \n"}, {"text": "How many Mr. Charlie Bobbleheads can be found throughout the game?", "correct": "Twenty & 20", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwenty & 20.\n\n\tIf you're the type who enjoys obscure collectibles and general completionism, you're going to love finding Mr. Charlie in the game since he appears in nearly every open section, hidden away into the nooks and crannies of Raccoon City waiting to be destroyed.  There are twenty of these little bobbleheads found throughout the game, and all of them make a distinctive quiet buzzing noise that you may or may not have a hard time keeping an ear out for, especially in the thick of things. Destroying all twenty (by any means) will award you an achievement, but little else; he doesn't unlock an upgrade or a weapon. \n"}, {"text": "You only need to use the Bolt Cutters to gain access to locations in which area?", "correct": "Uptown", "options": ["Sewers", "Downtown", "Hospital"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUptown.\n\n\tThe Bolt Cutters are found in the Repair Shop, and if you're utilizing them to their full potential then you're likely able to discard them by the time you leave the Uptown area.  Jill needs this important item to chop open chained-up stores and passageways, so while it's essential for her to access the Power Substation, it's also a relevant tool to access items hidden away, locked behind the alley behind the Donut Shop, within the Supermarket, and in the Rail Building (it's how you access the Shotgun!).  By the time you grab your Lockpick in the Power Substation, you could theoretically be done with this rudimentary option. \n"}, {"text": "In the Hospital, you'll need a Tape Player and an Audiocassette Tape containing whose voice to access the Vaccine Lab?", "correct": "Dr. Bard", "options": ["Police Chief Irons", "Mikahil", "Leon S. Kennedy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Bard\n\n\tThe Tape Player is the easy part of this item hunt since you can find it at the Nurse's Station in front of Dr. Bard's office.  Unfortunately, the lab is sealed off by a voice-activated security system, so Carlos, in an effort to save Jill's life, will need to find a tape of Dr. Bard's voice to get access. That tape, fortunately, is in the second-floor Treatment Room.  The catch is that you'll need to collect keys and ID Cards to eventually get access, and when you do, Dr. B's Recording for HR will be waiting out on a table...in a room full of Beta Hunters.  Combining the items is all you need to do to be able to use them on the necessary door. \n"}, {"text": "How many colours of Herbs can be found in this game?", "correct": "Two & 2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo & 2.\n\n\tAs with earlier games in the series, characters can heal themselves with these otherwise innocuous plants found throughout Raccoon City-- and I don't mean naturally; someone's growing these in flowerpots.  Green Herbs heal, Red Herbs enhance other Herbs, and Blue Herbs cure poison effects in these games, but interestingly Blue Herbs were omitted from this game. Combining Herbs is also critical since you can make stronger healing consumables with multiple or compounded effects.  You could, if you had the resources, make a G+R+B Herb mixture; it would be your strongest option.  In this game your largest combined herb will likely be G+G+G. \n"}, {"text": "The Flash Drive is the only thing that will allow you to access locked rooms in which location?", "correct": "NEST 2 Lab", "options": ["Spencer Memorial Hospital", "Raccoon City Police Department", "Sewer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNEST 2 Lab.\n\n\tOne of the last (of many) key-themed items of the game is the Flash Drive which Jill can obtain from the security terminal in the synthesizer room of the NEST 2 Lab.  When investigated, this item will transform into the Override Key and be usable on the doors with red, locked panels in the lab's corridors. You'll only need to use it once or twice, but it's a necessary item if you want to collect both ingredients of the Vaccine.  It's not the only Flash Drive in Raccoon City either-- Leon/Claire used one, hidden in the back of a police badge, in the Raccoon Police Department in \"Resident Evil 2\". \n"}, {"text": "There are three Fancy Cases in the Uptown area, all of which contain jewels that can be placed in a monument to what throwback \"Resident Evil\" destination?", "correct": "Clock Tower", "options": ["Spencer Mansion", "NEST Laboratory", "RPD Building"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClock Tower.\n\n\t\"Resident Evil\" games are known for their almost-arbitrary collectibles, so when you have the opportunity to pick up Fancy Cases in the Uptown shops and apartments you can find red, blue, and green jewels inside and use them for your benefit.  Popping these into the Clock Tower Monument in the Subway Station (before you leave the area for good) is very beneficial since each one will net you a different reward (a Grenade, Shotgun Shells, and a Hip Pouch).  The Clock Tower, while a destination visitable in the original \"Resident Evil 3: Nemesis\" game, does not appear in the same form in this remake. \n"}]}
