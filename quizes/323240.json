What movie is this?", "correct": "The Matrix", "options": ["The Day the Earth Stood Still", "Speed", "Constantine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Matrix.\n\n\tHeavy on the technology allusions, \"The Matrix\" made use of numerous phones in its filming whether for communication or travel between 'the matrix' itself or the real world of Zion.  With an operator on the Zion end, Neo, Trinity, and others could jack in and jack out at appropriate times to enter the computerized world we live in.  Killing someone in the matrix, unfortunately, kills them in Zion though, and while the characters are essentially avatars of their real selves, they can come to harm in both planes.  This motif of the movie is seen in all three \"Matrix\" films and the original movie ends with Neo speaking on the phone.\r\"The Matrix\", starring Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Laurence Fishburne, was directed by the Wachowski Brothers, earning over $450,000,000 after its 1999 release.  The series has since grossed over $1.6 billion and become immersed into popular culture. \n"}, {"text": "In 1954, Alfred Hitchcock released a thriller based on a stageplay of the same name.

Ellis (also known for \"Final Destination 2 and 4\" and \"Snakes on a Plane\"), \"Cellular\" placed Kim Basinger in a sticky situation (and saved her with her extensive knowledge of phone reconstruction) and forced Chris Evans to help out, and boy was he a trooper.  Basinger's character got through to Chris Evans' cell phone by chance after her kidnappers destroyed the only phone nearby and after convincing him that she needed help, persuaded him to save her life.  The film, despite so-so ratings, earned over $50,000,000 in the box office and propelled Chris Evans' career further than \"Not Another Teen Movie\" ever could.  Good call!\rWe can only imagine that bill he received after... \n"}, {"text": "Colin Farrell is pretty much trapped in this 2003 film about a man kept at a phone by a sniper (played by Kiefer Sutherland).

Katie Holmes and Forest Whitaker both showed up along the way.\rReleased one year before \"Cellular\", both had eerily contrasting premises.  Coincidentally, they were written by the same guy!  \"Phone Booth\" earned nearly $100,000,000 in the box office and received modestly-positive reviews from critics. \n"}, {"text": "A babysitter is caught in her own urban legend when she gets herself isolated in her employers' house and the killer is waiting upstairs.

Initially ignoring pre-screenings for reviewers, it took on a 0% review score from \"RottenTomatoes\" but nevertheless went on to earn $45,000,000, becoming a success financially.  Starring lesser-known Shannyn Sossamon, the film featured phones in some obscure ways. While many scenes showed characters receiving calls as a result of some offshoot curse and dying (unnecessarily) because of its reach, some scenes (such as a severed hand dialing a phone) just made no sense.  This film actually scored lower on review sites than \"Gigli\", \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\", and \"Meet the Spartans\".  It's THAT bad. I'd have blocked the number. \n"}, {"text": "It's hard to enjoy the holidays when someone's calling your sorority house's phone and squealing into the receiver.

As the film progressed, the main character received word that (as usual) the killer was in the house with her.

What is the name of the Oscar-winning film?", "correct": "Juno", "options": ["Jennifer's Body", "Thank You For Smoking", "Ghost World"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJuno.\n\n\tSince the release of \"Juno\" at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2007, the hamburger phone received a fair bit of notoriety, becoming a popular novelty item after the film's release and becoming inherently tied to the film's marketing campaign.

All of the original eleven from the first two films returned for the third (as they did with the second). \n"}]}
