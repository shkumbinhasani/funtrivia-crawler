{"id": "224580", "name": "Star Wars: A New Hope I Quiz | Star Wars | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Star Wars", "SW: Episode IV - A New Hope"], "questions": [{"text": "Before every Star Wars movie begins, George Lucas generously provides a short prologue to update viewers of events in the 'Star Wars' galaxy.  Who is the only main character mentioned in the rolling prologue that precedes the events of the original 'Star Wars' film?", "correct": "Princess Leia", "options": ["Darth Vader", "Luke Skywalker", "Obi-Wan Kenobi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincess Leia.\n\n\tMention of Princess Leia occurs in the third paragraph of the prologue.  Specifically, it reads:\r 'Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy....' \n"}, {"text": "The opening sequence of the original 'Star Wars' film features a riveting battle between an imperial star destroyer and a small freighter carrying Princess Leia.  Aboard this freighter are R2-D2 and C-3PO. When we first see these two droids, who else do we see with them?", "correct": "Another droid that looks similar to C-3PO", "options": ["Princess Leia", "No one", "Another droid that looks similar to R2-D2"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnother droid that looks similar to C-3PO.\n\n\tThe other droid, similar in appearance to C-3PO, walks with R2-D2 and C-3PO for a time, but then vanishes into an opening after a short while.  Though fans of 'Star Wars' have desperately attempted to understand the fate of this misguided droid, its whereabouts are unknown. (Note: Since sarcasm doesn't 'appear' in written speech, note that the last comment was fraught with it.) \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first character to utter any kind of speech in the original 'Star Wars'?", "correct": "C-3PO", "options": ["Princess Leia", "R2-D2", "Darth Vader"], "explanation": "\n\n\nC-3PO.\n\n\tFigures, doesn't it?  C-3PO has a reputation for being a loudmouth.  The transcript from his initial conversation is as follows:\r C-3PO: 'Did you hear that?'\rR2-D2: 'Bleep, Blip, Bloop, Blip, Blip' (Rough translation: 'Yes')\rC-3PO: 'They shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  (Throws hands in the air in utter despair.)  This is madness!'\rR2-D2: 'Bleep, Bleep, Bleep!' (Rough translation: 'Oh, pipe down you pessimistic pile of nuts and bolts!')\r (Note: Yes, I do speak R2-D2ish, in case you were wondering.) \n"}, {"text": "In a last attempt to save stolen rebel plans to the Death Star, Princess Leia downloads them into R2-D2's memory banks.  R2 and C-3PO are then able to depart the freighter they are on using an escape pod.  Why isn't their escape pod destroyed?", "correct": "Imperial troops hold their fire, as there are no life forms aboard", "options": ["The escape pod goes completely undetected", "R2-D2 activates the 'stealth mode' on the escape pod", "The escape pod miraculously avoids being hit, despite a shower of laser fire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nImperial troops hold their fire, as there are no life forms aboard.\n\n\tWhile C-3PO is having weird fantasies about being sent to the 'spice mines of Kessel' and being 'smashed into who knows what', the crafty R2-D2 formulates a plan to escape the clutches of the Empire.  R2 locates an escape pod upon which the two droids make a safe descent to the planet Tatooine. \n"}, {"text": "The lovely Princess Leia is unfortunately captured very early on in the film by the tyrranical Darth Vader, who claims her correctly to be a spy.  Princess Leia denies this accusation, suggesting that she is a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to which planet?", "correct": "Alderaan", "options": ["Dagobah", "Tatooine", "Hoth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlderaan.\n\n\tInteresting factoid: Did you know that Cindy Williams (of TV's 'Laverne and Shirley') was among those who auditioned for the part of Princess Leia? \n"}, {"text": "R2-D2 and C-3PO land on the planet Tatooine.  Which of these would be the best way to describe the climate of this planet, so far as the viewer can make out by observation?", "correct": "Dry desert", "options": ["Tropical jungle", "Cold and icy", "Arctic tundra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDry desert.\n\n\tTatooine is a dry, desert planet that circles around not one, but two suns (named Tatoo I and Tatoo II).  It is populated by hutts, humans, jawas, sand people and a number of other interesting life forms. \n"}, {"text": "C-3PO has a penchant for namecalling when it comes to conversations with his little buddy R2-D2.  During an argument, just preceding their break-up after landing on Tatooine, C-3PO refers to R2-D2 by which of the following cruel phrases?", "correct": "Nearsighted scrap pile", "options": ["Round-headed galactic trash heap", "Undersized rust bucket", "Pile of completely uncouth nuts and bolts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNearsighted scrap pile.\n\n\tR2-D2 is on a mission to find Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he (assuming that R2 is a 'he') has a hunch as to which direction he should travel.  C-3PO, on the other hand, just wants to be a fussypants.  Just after C-3PO insults R2, he (again, assuming maleness) gives his diminutive friend a swift kick and walks off. \n"}, {"text": "As far as the viewer is able to observe, which of the two droids is forcibly taken by the jawas?", "correct": "R2-D2", "options": ["C-3PO", "Neither is forcibly taken", "Both are forcibly taken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nR2-D2.\n\n\tC-3PO locates the jawas first.  So far as the viewer is aware, he volunteers to come into their custody.  R2-D2's story is a bit different.  He makes his way down a frightening ravine where he is suddenly demobilized by the ruthless, monstrous jawas (okay, that language may be a bit exaggerated).  The two droids are reunited in the jawas' giant sandcrawler transport. \n"}, {"text": "The jawas make their way to the humble abode of Owen Lars and Beru Whitesun, aunt and uncle of one Luke Skywalker.  The intention of the jawas is to sell several droids to this humble little family.  Most importantly, it seems, is that they purchase a translator who speaks which language?", "correct": "Bocce", "options": ["Huttese", "Ryl", "Bothan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBocce.\n\n\tAunt Beru makes it clear to Luke that they must have a translator droid who speaks Bocce.  Uncle Owen adds that he needs a droid who understands the 'binary language of moisture vaporators', must have items for any desert family. \n"}, {"text": "R2-D2 is among the initial two choices made by Owen Lars for purchase.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tUncle Owen chooses two droids initially, C3-PO for his translating prowess, and R5-D4, a droid similar in appearance to R2-D2 but with red markings and a cylinder-shaped 'head'.  Just as it seems that the dynamic duo of R2-D2 and C-3PO will be broken up for good, the R5-D4 unit selflessly (or, more likely, by happenstance) blows a motivator, allowing R2-D2 to take its place.\r Thank you for playing this quiz.
