Quiz | Scientists & Inventors | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "Scientists & Inventors", " Scientists"], "questions": [{"text": "Often historians look back at the Greek scientist Democritus as the first individual to propound on 'atomic theory'.  At least one person prior to Democritus was talking about atoms, namely his teacher.  Who was this pedagogue that is considered by some to be the true father of the atomic theory?  ", "correct": "Leucippus", "options": ["Thales", "Aristarchus", "Anaxagoras"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeucippus.\n\n\tLittle is known of Leucippus, his existence is shrouded by mystery, but several Greek scientists and philosophers cite him in their works as the instructor of Democritus and the originator of the idea that all matter is made up of tiny, indivisible, indestructible particles that he called 'atoms'.  In the modern era, atomic theory was revived by early 19th-century English scientist John Dalton, but true theoretical progress was not made on the nature of atoms until Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr came along in the early 20th century. \n"}, {"text": "We've all heard of James Watt and Robert Fulton, innovators of steam power.  Perhaps fewer of us have heard of inventors Thomas Newcomen and Thomas Savory,  who both developed steam engines around 1700.  But who among us has heard of the true inventor of steam power, an ancient Alexandrian scientist working in the first century A.D.  What was the name of this miraculous inventor and author of the 'Pneumatica'?  ", "correct": "Hero", "options": ["Strabo", "Dioscorides", "Eudoxus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHero.\n\n\tHero is another ancient genius lost in obscurity, and perhaps rightly so since his steam-powered turbine, which he called his 'aeolipile', never caught on with the public.  The era of steam power would have to wait another 1700 years! \n"}, {"text": "The comet we now refer to as Halley's comet has a rather storied history that extends back long before observations were made of it by the famed English astronomer for whom it is named.  Though sightings of the comet have been recorded all the way back to 240 B.C. (by the Chinese), the first sighting for which we have a name attached occurred in 1472.  Name the German astronomer associated with these 1472 recordings.  ", "correct": "Regiomontanus", "options": ["Theodoric of Freiberg", "Witelo", "Jacob Fust"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRegiomontanus.\n\n\tRegiomontanus, aka Johannes Muller, made careful observations of the famed comet over two centuries before the man for whom it is named.  Halley's name is attached for the simple fact that he was the first to discover the period of the comet, 76 years.   The comet was so well known in historic times that it made an appearance on the Bayeux Tapestry, a work of art commemorating the Norman conquest of England. \n"}, {"text": "Typically, when we think about the origins of the heliocentric theory of our solar system, the name Copernicus comes up.  Though Copernicus' work does deserve the notoriety that it has gotten (thanks to some publishing friends), he was certainly not the originator of said theory.  The heliocentric theory originated with the ancient Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos sometime in the 3rd century B.C.  Closer to Copernicus' time, in the early 15th century, a German philosopher made similar speculations in his work entitled 'De Docta Ignorantia'.  Who was this learned fellow?  ", "correct": "Nicholas of Cusa", "options": ["Gerardus Mercator", "Tycho Brahe", "David Fabricius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNicholas of Cusa.\n\n\tNicholas of Cusa was not only a Renaissance scholar, but also a cardinal of the Roman Catholic church!  His work entitled 'De Docta Ignorantia' (Of Learned Ignorance, 1440) was clearly his greatest achievement.  Therein, well before Copernicus who published in 1543 on his deathbed, Nicholas expounds on the nature of our solar system; that the Earth rotates on its axis and that the planets revolve around the sun in an infinite universe.   Because of his high church ranking, Nicholas received no censor and no excommunication despite the subversive nature of his ideas. \n"}, {"text": "Of the two identified founders of the calculus, one is much more well known than the other.  The most well-known of the two, Isaac Newton, is considered to be one of the greatest scientific minds of all time.  Who is the lesser known originator of the calculus?  ", "correct": "Leibniz", "options": ["Harriot", "Benedetti", "Jansson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeibniz.\n\n\tThe story behind the invention of the calculus is one of the most fascinating and controversial in the history of science.  According to gathered evidence, two men independently developed the basic ideas behind differential calculus within a decade of each other, they being the German Gottfreid Leibniz and the Englishman Isaac Newton.   Apparently, Newton came up with his theory first, some time in the 1660s, while Leibniz developed his ideas early in the next decade.  Newton, who was notorious for jealously hiding his ideas from the public, failed to publish his theory before Leibniz, who published his ideas first in 1684.  Publishing three years later, Newton attempted to stake claim to the discovery of calculus, and the heated rivalry was on!  Both had a number of allies on their side during the debate, which became vicious when accusations of plagiarism flew.  In the end, during his lifetime, Leibniz was largely discredited, with the English Royal Society deciding for Newton as the originator of the ideas behind calculus.  However, today, both men are given credit for independently originating this all-important branch of mathematics. \n"}, {"text": "Galileo, the greatest Italian genius of the 16th and 17th centuries, is usually given credit as the first to make experiments with falling bodies, typically atop the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or so the story goes.  However, he was not the first to make such experiments.  Several years before Galileo in the 1580s, which Flemish man made the same experiments, and recorded the same results?  ", "correct": "Simon Stevin", "options": ["Hans Lippershey", "Willebrod Snell", "Ignace Pardies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSimon Stevin.\n\n\tStevin overthrew the Aristotlean law of falling bodies several years before Galileo made his famous experiments.  Both discovered that different weighted objects fall at the same velocity, proving that weight is not a factor in determining how fast objects fall when subject to gravity.  However, both acknowledged that objects such as feathers are subject to wind resistance and therefore will appear to fall more slowly than a ton of bricks, or something else of greater mass. \n"}, {"text": "Joseph Lister is typically given credit for spreading the good word on the importance of antiseptic measures in surgery.  However, he was not the first to realize the importance of such procedures.  Which of the following individuals, working approximately twenty years before Lister, established the need for antiseptic procedures in the areas of obstetrics and surgery in his written work?  ", "correct": "Ignaz Semmelweiss", "options": ["Julius Sachs", "Friedrich Hoffmann", "Etienne Malus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIgnaz Semmelweiss.\n\n\tSemmelweiss was an Hungarian obstetrician (1818-1865) working in Vienna.  He discovered that puerperal fever, caused by uterine infection, resulted from a lack of antiseptic procedures in the birthing process.  He wrote about his discovery, but his writings did not take hold among members of the health care public.  It took the highly publicized work of British surgeon Joseph Lister (1827-1912), who developed clean sterilization techniques using carbolic acid, to spread the good work about asepsis. \n"}, {"text": "When we think of evolution and its origins as a theory, we typically think of Charles Darwin.  But Darwin was not the only British naturalist developing this theory during his time.  Which of these contemporaries of Darwin also came up with a very cogent set of ideas about evolution, including the concept of natural selection?  ", "correct": "Alfred Russel Wallace", "options": ["Charles Lyell", "Herbert Spencer", "Jacques Boucher de Perthes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace.\n\n\tDarwin's most important book, fully entitled 'The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life', was issued contemporaneously with Wallace's in 1858 before the Linnean Society.  While Darwin's chief investigations had occurred in South America, and most famously the Galapagos Islands, Wallace had done most of his work in the East Indies. \n"}, {"text": "Traditionally, Joseph Priestly was given the credit for the discovery of the element oxygen.  Priestly was not the first to identify oxygen though.  Which of these scientists first identified that magical element essential for life?  ", "correct": "Carl Scheele", "options": ["Henry Cavendish", "Joseph Black", "Hermann Boerhaave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarl Scheele.\n\n\tWhile Priestly first isolated oxygen in his laboratory in 1774, the Swedish apothecary Carl Wilhelm Scheele had done so at least the year before, if not prior.  Scheele failed to publish anything about his discovery until 1777, when he produced his 'Treatise on Air and Fire'.  Scheele also discovered the elements chlorine and manganese, along with the compounds silicon tetrafluoride, hydrofluoric acid, and a number of others. If full realization of the implications of oxygen's discovery is taken into account, it was French chemist Antoine Lavoisier who truly may be labeled the 'discoverer' of oxygen. It was he who crashed the theory of 'phlogiston', and established that oxygen was the necessary element for combustion. \n"}, {"text": "Louis Pasteur is given credit for smashing the idea of 'spontaneous generation', that is that living matter can be formed from non-living matter.  But he was not the first to take on this subject in a scientific manner, nor was he the first to have established its falsehood.  Which of these men was the first to make a significant scientific effort in toppling the myth of 'spontaneous generation'?  ", "correct": "Francesco Redi", "options": ["William Harvey", "Robert Hooke", "Georg Stahl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancesco Redi.\n\n\tThough William Harvey asserted that 'all living things come from an egg', which in essence is a condemnation of the theory of spontaneous generation, he never made any effort to prove this idea in the laboratory.  Francesco Redi (1621-97), a Florentine physician, made very specific experiments using meat and flies.  He showed that fly larvae (which he called 'worms') did not form on meat that was sealed in containers, while non-sealed meat, to which flies had access, developed fly larvae.   Another Italian physician, Antonio Vallisnieri, came to the same conclusions as Redi following his own experiments -- insects come from eggs and are not spontaneously generated.  Pasteur, working several centuries later, was the first to prove that bacteria also could not be spontaneously generated (he had the good fortune of superior microscopic equipment), thus finally destroying the spontaneous generation myth.
