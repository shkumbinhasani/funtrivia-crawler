{"id": "357665", "name": "Dead Space Multiple Choice Quiz | Dead Space | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games D-F", "Dead Space"], "questions": [{"text": "Arriving on the USG Ishimura in Chapter 1, Isaac's first order of business ends up being to fix which of these?", "correct": "Tram system", "options": ["Communications array", "Broken door hinge", "Air supply"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTram system.\n\n\tIsaac Clarke, Kendra Daniels, and Zach Hammond, all arriving on the Kellion shuttle, head to the planetcracker craft known as the USG Ishimura to investigate a communications blackout and restore any faulty items.  Upon their arrival, however, they discover something is amiss; creatures are aboard the craft, and they're eager to kill.  The first chapter of the game forces Isaac to repair the ship's tram system, switching tram cars onto the track and gaining access to deeper portions of the ship.  It only gets more dangerous from there.\rThe tram system is frequented quite a bit by Isaac.  Any time a chapter ends, he returns to the tram. \n"}, {"text": "What exactly is the USG Ishimura?", "correct": "A mining vessel", "options": ["An interspace city", "A planet habilitator", "An asteroid blaster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA mining vessel.\n\n\tThe USG Ishimura is a planet-cracker, a mining ship orbiting Aegis VII searching for useful minerals.  Although it is typically successful, Isaac and the rescue crew on the USG Kellion are called into action when the communication link is downed.  The ship holds tons of people and has enough departments and essentials to sustain not only miners but scientists and flight crew.  Unfortunately, this only ups the amount of Necromorphs Isaac will need to face throughout the game...and they can get anywhere. \n"}, {"text": "The second chapter of the game (entitled 'Intensive Care') is aptly set in which part of the ship?", "correct": "Medical Deck", "options": ["Hydroponics Deck", "The Bridge", "Engineering Deck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMedical Deck.\n\n\tShortly after repairing the tram system, Isaac is told to head onward to the Medical Deck to locate the Captain's codes-- Kendra discovers that the Captain is dead (I mean, who isn't at this point?) and they need his RIG to unlock the secrets of the Ishimura.  When it's found, however, Isaac needs to go to the Engineering Deck to fuel the ship and realign the gravitational centrifuge, otherwise it will crash down on the planet below. This doesn't end the madness though-- as if Necromorphs weren't enough to worry about, the ship is set to get caught in a meteor shower.  Heading to the bridge in chapter four will allow Isaac to take the reins and protect the Ishimura from total destruction...at least until the next big problem. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these weapons is the only one you begin the game with?", "correct": "Plasma Cutter", "options": ["Flamethrower", "Line Gun", "Ripper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlasma Cutter.\n\n\tThe Plasma Cutter is the most basic weapon of the game and its primary function, for Isaac at least, is to point and shoot.  The shots are made in a straight line with the crosshair being three dots in a row; Isaac can turn the gun to shoot vertically or horizontally.  Although it's pretty poor for crowd control, it is possible to complete the game only using the Plasma Cutter. Other weapons are unveiled as you locate schematics throughout the ship; the Line Gun shoots a wider beam, the Ripper utilizes spinning blades, and the Flamethrower is what it is.  Virtually all of the weapons in the game are improvised to an extent. Although they all shoot and they all hurt, they were all originally designed as mining apparatuses; both the Plasma Cutter and the Line Gun were used to shave ore off a specified target. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following are used to upgrade your armor, weapons, and accessories?", "correct": "Power Nodes", "options": ["Air Canisters", "Rivets", "Stasis Packs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPower Nodes.\n\n\tAs if fighting space creatures from Hell weren't bad enough, how much worse would it be without an opportunity to upgrade?  This can be done by locating a Power Bench on any of the USG Ishimura's many decks and popping Power Nodes into their appropriate places.  With the Plasma Cutter for instance, you need to place Power Nodes into the slots to upgrade Reload Time, Capacity, Damage, and Rate of Fire. All weapons, armor, and accessories are upgradable in this way.  Power Nodes are also used to access extra doors which would otherwise be inaccessible.  Of course you have to balance out whether or not you want to take the possible pot luck inside. Power Nodes cost 10,000 credits at a store. \n"}, {"text": "During the sixth chapter of the game, Isaac must face off against the Leviathan, a gigantic creature inhabiting what part of the USG Ishimura?", "correct": "Food Storage", "options": ["Medical Deck", "Crew Quarters", "The Bridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFood Storage.\n\n\tAfter engaging in combat on the bridge in chapter four, Isaac discovers that the ship's oxygen levels, as supplied by the Hydroponics Deck, are in trouble-- something is sucking up the oxygen and poisoning the air.  The only plan?  Make a counter-poison on the Medical Deck and head over there to take out whatever's causing the problem. Well...when you get there there's a big problem.  After taking out the poison pods found throughout the Grow Chambers, Isaac can attend to the matter in the food storage room: a giant Necromorph create with gigantic tentacles.  When the poison only serves to make it angrier, it's down to you, a gun, and moxie to down the thing and hop back on the tram. \n"}, {"text": "What three-letter term is used to describe Isaac's suit and inventory?", "correct": "RIG & R I G", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRIG & R I G.\n\n\tRIG is short for Resource Integration Gear and that's the gist of it.  The gear is the only thing keeping Isaac alive most of the time (save for ammo and quick wits).  Not only does it provide defense and maintain his health, but it provides all holographic imaging presented to him in the form of menus, maps, and logs.  Without the RIG, Isaac would not be able to maintain or carry items, speak to other people around the ship, or get little updates noting when his current objectives are in progress/complete.  Handy suit, that RIG. \n"}, {"text": "Chapters 7 and 8 of the game are framed around needing to send a distress signal out to what passing craft?", "correct": "USM Valor", "options": ["USM Halcyon", "USG Aphrodite", "USG Titan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUSM Valor.\n\n\tIn Chapter 7, Isaac descends into the Mining Bay of the USG Ishimura, the largest section of the ship, where he needs to locate and place an SOS beacon onto an asteroid.  When he launches this into space it does manage to catch the attention of a passing ship, the USM Valor, which attempts to send a response. Unfortunately, Isaac and the others can't receive it until he goes to the bridge and fixes the communications array.  This does little to help the issue-- he needs to head up to ADS Cannon 48 and destroy a large, organic creature resting on the side of the ship.  Once this is done, the Ishimura will receive the message they need from the Valor...and discover that they've been invaded by Necromorphs from an earlier escape pod. It crashes into the ship, right into the Cargo Hold.  Ugh. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters is revealed to be a government agent?", "correct": "Kendra", "options": ["Dr. Kyne", "Hammond", "Mercer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKendra.\n\n\tAs it turns out, the problems aboard the USG Ishimura may be more insidious than originally envisioned.  Isaac discovers, when he heads to the USM Valor, that the ship was actually sent to receive the alien marker stored in the Ishimura.  By sheer coincidence they ended up stumbling upon the beacon and the ship. Of course it was too late.  On the ship he is contacted by Dr. Kyne, a man who tells him to return the marker to the mined planet, Aegis VII.  While escaping the Valor, Hammond is killed and Isaac must head to the Crew Deck with the Singularity Core to repair the shuttle, head to the flight deck, and load the marker inside to, at the very least, temporarily prevent its being shipped to Earth. Kendra inevitably reveals herself to be a government agent and kills Dr. Kyne on the Flight Deck before departing in an escape pod.  This is when Nicole reappears and, along with Isaac, heads down to Aegis VII. \n"}, {"text": "What is the final boss of \"Dead Space\"?", "correct": "The Hivemind", "options": ["The Displacer Beast", "The Marker", "Aegis VII"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hivemind.\n\n\tWhen Isaac and Nicole land on Aegis VII, they end up working to shift the marker to its proper spot and stop the Necromorphs from being created.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work.  It actually makes things worse.  The tethers holding the Ishimura to Aegis start to break when the Hivemind reacts to the marker. Kendra informs Isaac that Nicole isn't actually real-- she killed herself before their arrival and he's been seeing her as a manifestation of the marker ever since; she's been working against him.  When Isaac tries to make his escape, the Hivemind awakens and kills Kendra before engaging in battle. By shooting the weak spots of the creature, Isaac can escape just in time, lifting off from Aegis as it begins to destroy itself.  As he floats in space, he figures that he has finally gotten free of the madness but, as he turns around, he sees a frightening vision of Nicole and the screen turns to black. \n"}]}
