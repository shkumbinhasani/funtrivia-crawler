{"id": "328916", "name": "\"The Power of Madonna\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "What is Sue's suggestion to Principal Figgins in the opening of this episode?", "correct": "To play Madonna over the PA", "options": ["To make every Friday Madonna Day in the school", "To have a class dedicated to Madonna", "To make the Glee Kids perform nothing but Madonna songs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo play Madonna over the PA.\n\n\tSue begins this episode by harnessing her immense obsession with Madonna, a woman who she feels exudes power like no other.  Finishing up a journal entry about the musician she heads to Figgins' office to inform him that he will be playing Madonna's \"Greatest Hits\" album over the school PA system at ear-splitting volumes all day, every day.  Figgins disagrees saying it would be insanity, but Sue recalls her plan to blackmail him with pictures she took in the previous episode, \"Hell-O\".  She also suggests that they round up certain students and send them to New York with nothing but $35, just like Madonna did when she was starting out.\rSue speaks with the Cheerios and suggests the question \"What would Madonna do?\"  Sue informs them that the answer would be to date a younger man, and that is their assignment: find arm candy.  She also states that she will no longer be calling them by last name, only by their first. \n"}, {"text": "What is the first Madonna number performed in the episode?", "correct": "Ray of Light", "options": ["Frozen", "Music", "Celebration"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRay of Light.\n\n\tIn the choir room, the girls of New Directions have a talk, at Rachel's request, about dating.  Though she claims that she and Finn are no longer together and that she could not stay with Jesse and compromise the team (a lie, since she just kept their relationship secret), she states that she and 'a guy' spend the night over the weekend and he tried to be intimate with her but she turned him down.  She asks what she should do to prevent him from getting mad.  Brittany and Santana simply say not to say no.  Tina echoes the concern saying that Artie has been treating her badly, saying she needs to change her looks if they're going to be together.  Mr. Schuester overhears their talk and suggests they speak to another woman about it, like Emma.  Rachel states that she did speak with Emma but got no help in the matter (as Emma has also never been intimate with a man before).  Will and Emma decide together that they'll find a way to help the girls.\rAs Will heads out of the school, he finds the Cheerios practicing in the gym.  Sue has them perform a routine, on stilts, to Madonna's \"Ray of Light\". \n"}, {"text": "According to Finn, what is the male version of Madonna?", "correct": "Pantera", "options": ["Prince", "Metallica", "Aerosmith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPantera.\n\n\tWill compliments Sue on the routine although she calls her kids sloppy in their performance.  When Will asks her about Madonna, she states that the material girl has many lessons to offer.  This is why Will introduces Madonna to the Glee kids as their assignment for the week; they are to create a number based on a Madonna song. While Kurt and the girls are thrilled, the rest of the guys are uncomfortable with the idea.  Kurt goes so far as to announce that he will create a multimedia project about Madonna with Mercedes.  Will states that his reasoning behind the assignment is to show a message of equality and strength as they guys have been treating the girls of the group unfairly lately. When puck says that Madonna really doesn't translate to show choir, the girls set out to prove him wrong by performing \"Express Yourself\" on stage. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only place in the school where Madonna's music does not play?", "correct": "Emma's office", "options": ["The choir room", "The cafeteria", "The auditorium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmma's office.\n\n\tSantana and Brittany discuss their spots on the Cheerios squad and Brittany (now wearing accessories that Madonna would sport) notes that she found a boyfriend named Wes Brody (who's 7).  Santana is frustrated as she can't find a younger guy and Brittany suggests dating Finn again (as he's three days younger) and taking his virginity.  Santana figures this is a good idea and suggests it to him so that he can make Rachel jealous for continuing to date Jesse.  Santana describes it as a win-win situation for herself.  All the while, Madonna music is playing in the school halls.\rEmma invites Sue into her office and calmly asks why Madonna isn't playing in her office.  Sue responds saying that she doesn't deserve it.  She lacks Madonna's self-confidence, power, and sexual magnetism.  As a result, Sue disconnected Emma's intercom. \n"}, {"text": "Which two students perform a mash-up of \"Borderline\" and \"Open Your Heart\"?", "correct": "Finn and Rachel", "options": ["Kurt and Mercedes", "Puck and Quinn", "Rachel and Jesse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn and Rachel.\n\n\tConcerned about the boys' involvement in the Madonna assignment, Rachel asks Finn if he'll perform a mash-up with her to get the guys in the mood.  Finn also asks Rachel to tell him the truth about her and Jesse's relationship.  She finally gives in and says she's still seeing him, but she wants to stay friends with Finn.  Finn agrees, but only if it doesn't lead to something bad.  Finn, hopping on drums, leads them into their mash-up of \"Borderline\" and \"Open Your Heart\".  They take their song into the school hallways to find several students dressed up in Madonna outfits from the past (from her earlier looks to later styles from \"Music\").\rWill finds Kurt and Mercedes in the halls and asks about their project to which both reply that they have students from the AV club helping produce a video about Madonna.  This is when Sue finds Will in the halls and says that New Directions should not be paying homage to Madonna because she's her artist.  Will says that Madonna's public domain AND he calls her out on the hair jokes, making fun of her hair-do in the process.\rFinn speaks with Santana between classes and says that he's in on her offer, much to her delight. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Rachel and Jesse meet in the shadows?", "correct": "In the library", "options": ["At her house", "In the choir room", "Near her locker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the library.\n\n\tKurt and Mercedes visit Sue in her office and ask if she'd like to talk about the issue in the hallway with Mr. Schuester.  She sits them down and tells her story.  She grew up with her handicapable sister while her parents weren't around too much (as they were Nazi hunters).  On Sue's sixth birthday, she and her sister bleached her hair with whatever they could find, and since then her hair has been so damaged that it has been worn short ever since.  Mercedes interrupts the story in regards to Sue's actual age (29) before Sue continues saying that she picks on Will's hair because she's jealous.  Mercedes and Kurt have a plan though.  They wish to use her for their project; using their talents, they decide to give her a makeover as long as they can use the Cheerios.\rRachel heads to the school library to meet up with Jesse.  Jesse apologizes for what he did the other night and says that she deserves epic romance.  He says that they will only spend an intimate night when she's ready to.  She responds that she's ready. \n"}, {"text": "What song in this episode is the first in the series to be performed by Sue?", "correct": "Vogue", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVogue.\n\n\tEmma speaks with Will at school and decides that Madonna had control over her life, so she should do the same.  She informs him that she will be over at his place on that very night to (as she puts it) do the nasty and she casually walks off.\rMeanwhile, the AV Club shoots Kurt and Mercedes' video, a remake of Madonna's \"Vogue\" video starring Sue Sylvester as Madonna herself.  Throughout, all of the scenes are reenacted and Sue sports a completely new hairdo.  Kurt and Mercedes also appear in the video alongside the Cheerios.  While this is Sue's first song of the series, it is certainly not the last. \n"}, {"text": "The first song in which Santana has distinctive vocals over the course of the series is \"Like a Virgin\".  Who is not involved in the performance of this song?", "correct": "Artie", "options": ["Rachel", "Emma", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArtie.\n\n\tAs everyone prepares for their nights of intimacy, they worry about whether they're making the right decision.  As Rachel emerges from her bathroom to find Jesse, Emma prepares for her night with Will, and Finn ends up in a hotel to spend his evening with Santana, the six of them sing Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" and give in (though occasionally with hesitation).  When the song ends, it turns out that all three of them have not yet made their decision, having daydreamed the entire thing.  They all face their issues immediately after in their own ways.\rMercedes and Kurt are eager to see which new look Sue will wear to school but both are shocked to find that she looks the same as before.  She was evidently persuaded by Figgins.  When handing in a list of students (all from Glee Club) who should be shipped to New York with $35, he stated that she doesn't need to reinvent herself because she's already a powerful woman.  Instead, she needs to revinvent everyone else, starting with Mercedes and Kurt.\rFinn and Rachel speak to one another in the choir room about the previous night.  While both claim that they lost their virginity, Rachel did not, having felt that she wasn't ready.  She explained to Jesse that she couldn't do it for the sake of the team and for her own sake.  Finn, on the other hand, did.  He claimed to himself that it didn't mean anything.  Emma speaks to Will too though she never went through with it.  Will claims that he never followed the plan he set for the boys in New Directions; he's been treating her with disrespect.  He also states that he filed the divorce papers for his marriage with Terri.  After Emma departs, Jesse shows up. \n"}, {"text": "What Madonna song do Mercedes and Kurt perform as new members of the Cheerios?", "correct": "4 Minutes", "options": ["Die Another Day", "Sorry", "Beautiful Stranger"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4 Minutes.\n\n\tJesse has a talk with Will before Glee Club assembles and when they both step in front of the kids, the group is furious.  Kurt and Mercedes, both of whom want to get leading roles in some of the numbers, are disappointed that their chances are squashed if Jesse is onboard while Santana states that he's probably a spy.  Finn is disappointed because of Rachel's relationship with him.  Brittany thinks that Jesse is Will's son.  It's official though- no one has ever been turned away from Glee Club before and Jesse, who now officially lives with his uncle within the school district, is able to join the team legally.  When Rachel asks why he did it, he claims that he left Vocal Adrenaline to be with her.\rAlmost immediately after, Sue adds Kurt and Mercedes to the Cheerios' roster and they perform a duet of Madonna and Justin Timberlake's \"4 Minutes\" in front of the school (with the Cheerios backing them).  They tell Will that they're doing both cheerleading and Glee Club to have more opportunities to sing the lead, and Sue has just added vocals to her performances. \n"}, {"text": "When the students perform \"Like a Prayer\" at the end of the episode, Jesse is a member of New Directions.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe guys, learning their lesson, gather with Mr. Schuester in the choir room to perform a rendition of \"What it Feels Like for a Girl\" together.  Artie, having been shown up by Tina, realized his mistakes.  Kurt states that they all have to respect each other as individuals as well as for their talents to take things to the next level as a group.  Artie personally apologizes to Tina for his actions and Finn speaks to Rachel as well.  He claims that he didn't want her to be with Jesse because he likes her too.  He and Jesse make amends fairly quickly and Finn says he'll do his best to stay away from his girl.  They all head to the auditorium for their final Madonna number and Rachel, surprised at this situation doesn't know what to think.\rTo close the episode, the club gathers in the auditorium and performs Madonna's \"Like a Prayer\".  After Rachel and Finn sing portions of the song, Mercedes and Kurt, who complained about their lack of inclusion in the club's numbers, also sing respective lines.  As a choir backs the kids for the last portion of the song, they end the episode by celebrating and Jesse takes Rachel in his arms and spins her around. \n"}]}
