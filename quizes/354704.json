He apologizes for the confidential meeting at his residence but it is the nature of his job.  Sister Jude says that she's worried because the Monsignor told her not to concern herself with Dr. Arden, but she has to trust her instincts.  Mr. Goodman says that it is his true calling to identify Nazi war criminals because he lost everyone in the Holocaust.  Handing the folder over, Jude says that Dr. Arden may have been an SS doctor by the name of Hans Gruper.  Goodman says that everything in the folder, including the home address, is probably a lie.  He also tells her about Operation Paperclip, which created forced biographies for high-ranking SS officials; one way to know if he was involved is if he has a blood-type tattoo on his left side.\rBack in the asylum, Dr. Arden is brought into Sister Jude's office by gunpoint; 'Anne' has him held hostage.  As Sister Mary Eunice runs off to find Sister Jude, the guard holds her at the end of his gun as well, ending the stand-off. \n"}, {"text": "According to her supposed husband, what is 'Anne's' real name?", "correct": "Charlotte", "options": ["Grace", "Franka", "Jude"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlotte.\n\n\t'Anne' wakes up strapped to the bed and Sister Jude is in her room.  Anne insists that Dr. Arden is Dr. Gruber and that they should investigate his lab while he's in the hospital for the gunshot wound to his leg.  Jude says that she needs to fess up since he'll be back soon, maybe with the police.  She could end up on his operating table.  Anne tells Jude to look, but she already did; she didn't find anything, even in the closet where she allegedly found Shelley.  Sister Mary Eunice comes by to inform Jude that a man is in her office looking for his wife.\rThe man turns out to be the husband of the woman claiming to be Anne Frank.  He produces a picture; it turns out her name is Charlotte and she has a son, David.  He blames her possible psychotic break on her high-strung personality and the stress of her new baby. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Thredson diagnoses 'Anne' with which of the following?", "correct": "Post-partum psychosis", "options": ["Paranoid schizophrenia", "Insanity", "Munchausen by proxy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPost-partum psychosis.\n\n\tAccording to Charlotte's husband, she read \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" when she was eight months pregnant and they went to see the play.  The problem is that it seemed to hit her in the worst way.  The tattoo on her arm was something she made herself.  It started after she had the baby and couldn't sleep.  She started reading about Auschwitz and she flew off the handle, researching Nazism excessively.  Dr. Thredson, standing in the door, says it's post-partum psychosis.  Charlotte's husband says that she simply can't be psychotic and that she's going home with him.  Thredson says this is a bad idea.\rWhen Charlotte is reunited with her husband she can't seem to recognize him until he shows her the picture of their family.  As they depart, Thredson says she's making a mistake and concerns himself with Sister Jude's decision to sterilize both Kit Walker and Grace.  Despite his mention that she can't legally do so without their consent, she seems to think she can. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Sister Jude spare from her sterilization decision?", "correct": "Kit", "options": ["Grace", "Neither of them", "Both of them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKit.\n\n\tIn their respective solitary confinement cells, Kit and Grace discuss their fates; both seem afraid and long for each other's touch.  Kit says that he and Alma always wanted kids and now it seems that they won't be getting any.  Kit apologizes for getting them into their mess, but Grace doesn't regret it.  She says that Sister Jude must be the Devil.  Sister Mary Eunice stops by and open Kit's door.  She allows him to head to the cafeteria-- it's time for supper-- Sister Jude is releasing him from solitary because he showed signs of true redemption.  As he departs, Mary Eunice tells Grace that she needs to get her rest; she's going under the knife in the morning and needs her strength.\rAs Grace tries to sleep in her bed that evening, she's awakened by a bright light and a shaking at her cell door.  Backed against the wall she's approached by something otherworldly. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Thredson tells Lana to meet him where to facilitate her escape?", "correct": "The front stairs", "options": ["The common room", "The death chute", "The hydrotherapy room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe front stairs.\n\n\tIn the common room, Dr. Thredson approaches Lana at the window and reminds her of their plan to help her escape the facility.  He tells her to meet him under the front staircase at 6:00pm before he heads off to meet Kit in his temporary office.  Sitting down with him, he opens a case containing recording devices.  He says that before he leaves, he needs to help him believe that what he did is true; he says that he'll record Kit saying what he thinks sincerely happened and he'll play it back so that he can realize what he's done.\rGrace awakens in the light to meet a now-pregnant Alma.  As Alma recedes into the light, she's cut along the stomach by something she can't see.\rDr. Jude calls Dr. Goodman about her investigation and tells him to call it off.  As she puts the phone down, Dr. Arden steps in having returned from the hospital.  He says that he's pressing charges...against her.  On her watch, 'Anne' got a loaded gun and then she sent her home.  He calls her inept and although Sister Jude apologizes and says that they should start fresh, he refuses it.  He wants her to grovel.  He decides to call the Monsignor and demand her dismissal. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Sister Mary Eunice leave Shelley's body?", "correct": "In a schoolyard", "options": ["In a dumpster", "In the forest", "In the suburbs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a schoolyard.\n\n\tDr. Arden returns to his office and begins to redress the wound on his leg before Sister Mary Eunice comes in to dress it for him.  She apologizes for her behavior on the night of the storm and he says never to speak of it again.  He thanks her for hiding Shelley before Sister Jude could find what was left of her and she says it was easy (considering how light she was now) and it was to protect both of them.  With Sister Jude spouting accusations, they'll be able to send her away and the Monsignor will put Dr. Arden in charge.  Then, she can be his strong right-hand.  He says he trusts her and is surprised she could get her into the woods without arousing suspicion.\rWell, it turns out that Sister Mary Eunice never took her to the woods; she left her at the bottom of a stairwell outside a public school...where the students found her. \n"}, {"text": "Is Dr. Thredson able to help Lana escape Briarcliff?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tSister Jude watches as 'Anne'/Charlotte is returned to the asylum while her husband looks on in disappointment.  From above, Dr. Arden observes.  The doctor heads to her cell and welcomes her personally.  Her husband tells Sister Jude that she got worse.  When she returned home she lashed out and then tried to kill David.  He demands that she remain at the asylum to get help, perhaps from Dr. Thredson since he seemed to know what she needed.  Sister Jude sends for him.\rDownstairs, Dr. Thredson, with his things in tow, meets with Lana and says that they walk straight through the front door, past the guards.  His distraction manages to work and she gets directly into his car.  Frank, the guard, follows behind and speaks to Thredson about the new patient before he can see Lana in the passenger seat.  Thredson says that he isn't going to comply with Sister Jude's request; he never really worked at Briarcliff.  He and Lana depart.\rDr. Thredson gone, Charlotte's husband finds Dr. Arden leaving her cell and thanks him for not pressing charges.  Arden says that there's no reason for punitive action when he could do something more humane overnight-- something that will make her a new woman. \n"}, {"text": "When speaking to the guard, Frank, Sister Jude relates a story about which of these?", "correct": "A squirrel she once found", "options": ["Her first job as a nun", "An accident she once had in town", "Her first day at Briarcliff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA squirrel she once found.\n\n\tDown in Dr. Arden's lab, Charlotte is placed on the slab and prepared for her trans-orbital lobotomy, a procedure Arden compares to a routine cavity-filling.   Upstairs, Sister Jude prays as Frank enters the room.  He informs her that Lana has gone missing and it can only be assumed that she's off-grounds.  Sister Jude tells him a story about a squirrel she once kept and forgotten to feed.  Her mother, upon discovering it dying, threw it in the garbage while her daughter was praying.  When Jude later asked her drunk mother why God didn't answer her prayers, she replied that \"God always answers our prayers, Judy.  It's just rarely the answer we're looking for.\"  Jude knows her time is coming.\rWhile Jude prepares her things, dresses up for a night on the town, and heads to the bar, Dr. Arden bandages one side of Charlotte's face and makes the first hit through her eye and into her brain. \n"}, {"text": "What piece of furniture causes Lana to become concerned about Dr. Thredson's intentions?", "correct": "Lamp", "options": ["Couch", "Bed", "Chair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLamp.\n\n\tDr. Thredson brings Lana to his house to keep her safe and, upon their arrival, he says that she can't leave quite yet; the police will be looking for her and she needs to stay in hiding until the coast is clear.  If they found out that she was in his care, he would lose everything.  He says they'll go to the police in the morning and he prescribes a glass of wine for her.  While Lana looks around she decides to pick up a phone to call her friend about Wendy.  Thredson stops her before the call gets through; it's for both of their safety.  When he sits her down he says she'll write about it all and win a Pulitzer Prize.  She's the one to write her story.\rThey toast to this and take a drink before Thredson turns on a nearby lamp.  Lana turns to see that its shade is made from the torso of a human being.  As he sits down, he passes a bowl of mints to her; it's actually in a cracked piece of a skull.  Lana asks to use the restroom and, when she searches the hall for it, she opens the only unlocked door to find a room containing several tools and hanging pieces of skin.  Thredson turns on the light and says she's found his hobby.  She asks him if the hobby is making furniture and asks what material he uses.  As he tells her it's skin, he presses a button and drops her through a trap door into the basement. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Lana find in Dr. Thredson's basement?", "correct": "Wendy", "options": ["Alma", "Pepper", "Shelley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWendy.\n\n\tKit finds Grace in the common room, bleeding.

At the same time, the police walk in to arrest Kit for murder; Dr. Thredson sent the tape he recorded, including Kit's confession, to the police.  As he's dragged out, Grace yells to him that Alma's still alive; everything about the aliens is true!\rLana awakens to find herself chained by her ankle to the tiled basement floor.  Next to her is a cold body wrapped in a housecoat.  She turns it over to find a frozen Wendy.  Thredson emerges and says that he kept her fresh.  Normally he'd have skinned the body and decapitated it.  He says that they'll be continuing their therapy by having her kiss her girlfriend's lips.  When he puts on his Bloody Face mask, he says that he took Wendy's teeth.\rJude wakes up in a man's bed in town, gathers her things, and leaves.\rCharlotte's husband returns to their home to find her cleaning the room she once used for her research.  She spent the day tending to the house, the baby, and making dinner.  He asks if she's happy and she says she's never been happier.  As they leave the room, she leaves behind the last of her photos and clippings; one of them includes an image of Hans Gruber, Dr. Arden in an SS uniform. \n"}]}
