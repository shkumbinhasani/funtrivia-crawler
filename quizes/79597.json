It's like a morph of the two! Those two monsters appeared together in a number of films, including 'Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.' Karloff played the scientist in 'House of Frankenstein'. \n"}, {"text": "In a shameless display of Hollywood exploitation, Rondo Hatton was a man with a disfiguring affliction whose elongated face was featured in horror films such as 'The Brute Man' and 'House of Horrors'.

'Waxworks' is a great German expressionist film. There is no 'Horrors of the Wax Museum', but in the 60s Hammer made a terrific 'Horrors of the Black Museum' which is a must see! \n"}, {"text": "In Mel Brooks' 'Young Frankenstein', there is a nutty police inspector with one wooden arm.
