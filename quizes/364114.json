When the show finally ended, most of the six friends were paired with each other, but I was disappointed with one couple who never got together.  Which of these pairs were never married to each other by the final season of \"Friends?\"", "correct": "Joey and Phoebe", "options": ["Ross and Rachel", "These were all married pairs", "Chandler and Monica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoey and Phoebe.\n\n\t\"Friends\" first aired in 1994, and lasted ten seasons.  Several years into the show, I thought it seemed only fair that the six friends ended up marrying between them.  Throughout the many dating misadventures they all had, a few of the friends realized they were meant for each other.  Ross and Rachel dated off and on throughout the series, and did marry before the end of the series, though they divorced (and got back together at the very end).  Chandler and Monica had also been married by the end of the ten seasons. Joey and Phoebe never married each other but they did share some tender moments, including five kisses throughout the 236 episodes of \"Friends\". In \"The One With the Proposal\", Joey did propose to Phoebe, thinking she was pregnant and not wanting her to be alone, and she accepted, but after discovering Phoebe was not actually pregnant, the two never married each other. \n"}, {"text": "As I watch \"Pretty Little Liars\", I find myself quoting Alison DiLaurentis often.  In a video found from the night of her murder, she said, \"Go on, you know you want to kiss me.\" One character in particular was one who was interested in Hanna Marin, and I thought they would end up together.  However, by the end of season 3, he moved away in fear of \"A\"; after all, he had been blackmailed into helping Mona destroy the Liars.  Which of these characters am I referring to?", "correct": "Lucas Gottesman", "options": ["Wren Kingston", "Caleb Rivers", "Toby Cavanaugh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLucas Gottesman.\n\n\tLucas appeared in the first three seasons of \"Pretty Little Liars\", which first aired in 2010.  Early on in his 23 appearances, Lucas expressed his love for Hanna.  Though it seemed that she was also in love with him, she rejected him.  Even though he was heartbroken, Lucas befriended Hanna, even coming to her for dating advice later on.  Lucas was never \"A\", and was never part of the \"A-Team\", but he was blackmailed into helping the \"A-Team\" destroy Hanna, Spencer, Aria, and Emily.  Out of fear \"A\" would harm him again, Lucas moved away at the end of season 3 of the show. \n"}, {"text": "In the U.S. version of \"The Office\", there were so many characters falling in love with each other, it was hard to keep track.  As I watched the series' nine seasons, I found myself rooting for certain people to get together.  Fortunately for me, most of my wishes came true, and several marriages took place between the characters throughout the show's run.  In fact, by the final episode of the ninth season, which of these was not a couple who were married?", "correct": "Ryan and Kelly", "options": ["Dwight and Angela", "Jim and Pam", "Michael and Holly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRyan and Kelly.\n\n\t\"The Office\" (U.S.) was an adaptation from the U.K. series of the same name starring Ricky Gervais.  It aired for nine seasons from 2005 to 2013.  Throughout the series, multiple characters fell in love, and many of the relationships proved why office romances are usually bad ideas.  However, some did get married. Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly were married in the sixth season, after dating since the fourth season (though Jim had a crush on Pam since season one, even while she was engaged to Roy). They had two children by the final season.  Dwight and Angela began dating secretly in season two, and their relationship was off and on throughout, until season nine when the two finally married. Michael Scott and Holly Flax moved to Colorado in season seven, and it wasn't revealed until later that the two actually married.  Ryan Howard and Kelly Kapoor dated throughout the series, and ran away together in the final episode of the series.  However, we never saw them marry. \n"}, {"text": "From the beginning of the series until the end, I felt that Jack Donaghy and Liz Lemon should end up together.  Unfortunately, though the series hinted at a love between the two throughout all seven seasons, they never actually got together.  They were accidentally married once, but it was annulled shortly after.  Which television comedy is described?", "correct": "30 Rock", "options": ["The Big Bang Theory", "How I Met Your Mother", "Portlandia"], "explanation": "\n\n\n30 Rock.\n\n\t\"30 Rock\" ran for seven seasons (though the seventh was abbreviated), ran from 2006 to 2013.  It was created by Tina Fey, who also starred as Liz Lemon.  In the show, Liz Lemon was the head writer of a television show (\"The Girly Show\"), and the series followed her struggles behind the scenes as the writer.  It was loosely based on Tina Fey's experiences as a writer of \"Saturday Night Live\".\r Throughout the series, it seemed obvious that Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy would eventually end up together.  In one episode, they were even married, but it was an accidental marriage when a Spanish-speaking man in the Caribbean mistook Liz as Jack's bride when he was intending to marry Avery... The marriage was, however, annulled, and by the finale of the show, Jack and Liz were not together (Tina Fey said it would be \"too icky\"). \n"}, {"text": "Fry openly admitted to loving Leela throughout most of this animated series, and I just knew they would end up together.  It wasn't until the fourth and final direct-to-video film based on the series that Leela revealed her love for Fry in return.  By the end of the series, the two had finally gotten together for good, living their lives happily together (twice, interestingly enough).  Which show is it?", "correct": "Futurama", "options": ["Family Guy", "The Simpsons", "American Dad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFuturama.\n\n\t\"Futurama\" first aired in 1999, and lasted four seasons until 2003 (these episodes aired on FOX).  The show was renewed in 2008, and four direct-to-video films were released.  In 2010, the show was picked up by Comedy Central, where three more seasons were created, with the seventh season's finale in 2013.  Throughout the entire series, Fry, a pizza delivery boy from 1999 thawed out in 3000, admitted his love for Leela, a one-eyed alien who worked with him in 3000.  In one episode in season 3, Fry and Leela married because Fry wrote her name in the stars. However, time was going quickly, and no one remembered what happened, and when time was fixed to move at its normal speed, it also went back to before they were married. In the final episode of the seventh season, however, Fry and Leela finally ended up together, living their life together as the only two moving people left in the world.  However, the Professor had a time machine that brought them back to the time just before they spent their lives together, with no knowledge of their time together.  They traveled back in time to live their lives together again, making this couple unique.  They got to fall in love and live happily ever after... twice! \n"}, {"text": "Sarah Braverman seems very unlucky in love. When she met Hank Rizzoli, I thought it would be cool if they got together. They did, but it didn't seem to last long.

When Hank and Sarah first met, Hank was photographing the family, and Sarah was able to get a job as Hank's assistant.She was dating Mark Cyr at the time, who became insanely jealous of Hank, but Sarah promised nothing was going on. Of course, throughout the season, it was revealed that Hank had fallen for Sarah. After an impossible decision between Mark and Hank, Sarah ended up with Hank. Things didn't last long, though, and in season five, they were no longer together (though it did seem they still had feelings for each other throughout that season, as well). \n"}, {"text": "While Leslie Knope ran for city council, it was unwise to have a secret office romance. Of course, this did not stop her from loving Ben Wyatt. Throughout the times they were dating, I desperately wanted them to expose their secret love and get married. Partway through season five, this is exactly what happened, and they were married. What show are these characters from?", "correct": "Parks and Recreation", "options": ["Community", "Scrubs", "My Name is Earl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParks and Recreation.\n\n\t\"Parks and Recreation\" began in 2009.

As it turned out, the mystery was a second story of Craig's apartment, but to avoid spoilers, I will only mention the second floor was bad news.The story of Craig and Sophie was far more interesting anyway. During the episode, Sophie was going to move away to study monkeys, but when the Doctor asked what was keeping her from going, it became clear she loved Craig (who, by this time, we had learned loved Sophie a great deal). Near the end of the episode, they finally kissed.They reappeared in the sixth season, where we learned they were living together while raising their child, Alfie. \n"}, {"text": "In this show's five season run, Beast Boy never had more than a hug from Raven, though it seemed he may have felt something for her.
