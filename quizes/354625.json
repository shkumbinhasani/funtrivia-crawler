The girl was brought in based on an anti-Semitic remark; someone made the remark and she stabbed them with a broken bottle.  When Sister Jude asks if she lost someone in the war, the girl doesn't respond; instead she just whistles.\rIn his lab, Dr. Arden performs more experiments on Shelley.  When she asks if he plans to kill her, he responds that what he's doing might make her live forever.\rIn the bakery the next day, Kit asks Grace for a cigarette and she notices that Dr. Arden hit him during another dangerous session before giving him x-rays to find the thing in his neck. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Thredson believes that Lana deserves to leave Briarcliff.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tKit is surprised that Grace still believes him despite the craziness of his story.  When he asks her to tell her story, she finally relents.  One night, she heard noises outside her and her step-sister's bedroom.  Walking down the hallway, she found her father getting murdered by a crazed man with an axe.  Running downstairs and hiding in a closet, she evaded escape as he ran by but discovered the pieces of her stepmother's body on a high shelf.  Grace's step-sister later pointed her finger at her and no one believed otherwise.  Kit believes her story and she says she misses the horses the most.\rDr. Thredson speaks to Lana in his temporary office and asks her where she went during the movie the previous week.  The three vowed not to discuss their escape, but Dr. Thredson is okay with the escape plan since she doesn't deserve to be there.  He decides to help her, but to do that he has to cure her of her homosexuality. \n"}, {"text": "The new girl at Briarcliff claims that who was once a Nazi?", "correct": "Dr. Arden", "options": ["Sister Jude", "Monsignor Howard", "Dr. Thredson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Arden\n\n\tIn the common room of the ward, the new girl writes on a piece of paper.  Lana sees this and recommends not writing; if the guards catch her she'll head to solitary.  When Dr. Arden walks in, the girl is shocked.  She claims that he was there, in Auschwitz, as a Nazi.  She asks if he remembers her and says that her name is Anne Frank. When Sister Jude questions the girl in her office, Jude says that the consensus is that Anne Frank died in a concentration camp.  'Anne' says that this is a lie; she survived the extermination and survived as a pickpocket in Germany.  She met an American soldier, married him, and headed to New Jersey. When he died, her journal was published and she decided never to reveal herself to the public as they needed the face of a deceased Anne Frank to make meaning.  Jude says the story is indecent, but Anne says that's hypocritical since she has a Nazi war criminal working at Briarcliff. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Thredson believes which of these theories?", "correct": "Kit killed Alma out of shame", "options": ["Kit didn't kill the victims of the bloody-faced killer but he knows their identity", "Kit was actually abducted by aliens", "Kit has been able to escape the asylum to kill more victims"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKit killed Alma out of shame.\n\n\tDr. Thredson speaks to Kit in his office.  If he deems him sane, he'll be executed but if he's declared insane he'll end up staying at Briarcliff.  Thredson doesn't think he's insane, but society seems to be against him.  He does, however, feel as though he was forced to concoct a theory about alien abduction to mask his true guilt.  Thredson says he'll be willing to lie to the courts to protect him, but he needs to admit the truth so that he can leave feeling he's done some good.\r'Anne' tells Sister Jude that Arden was known as Hans Gruber of the SS in Auschwitz.  Although he seemed kind and gentle to the children on the trains, he never saved a soul.  Children would be taken and returned to the dormitories somehow different.\rThredson looks through the files and tells Kit of the crimes he committed, removing the skin and the heads of his victims.  When Alma confronted him about his true shame, Kit killed her on the night of the so-called abduction.\rSister Jude tells 'Anne' that she must be lying about it all.  'Anne' says she was definitely there and shows the prisoner number on her arm. \n"}, {"text": "According to Grace, what's a sign of sanity?", "correct": "Self-doubt", "options": ["Memory", "A smile", "Ambition"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSelf-doubt.\n\n\tIn the common room, Lana steps up to get her medication and has a daydream.  A man calls her up to receive her prize and she sees herself standing at the podium, rising to thank those who inspired her to prevail through the nightmares of Briarcliff, despite Sister Jude's plan to rid her of her memory through shock therapy.  As she takes her meds, she realizes she needs to do anything to get out.  She heads to Dr. Thredson's office and says yes to his therapy.\rGrace finds Kit alone in the bakery, pounding a wad of dough with his fists.  Kit wonders if, perhaps, he is crazy.  Maybe he made it all up since he can't remember what actually happened.  Grace tells him that self-doubt is a sure sign of sanity.  Grace tells him that she doesn't care if he's a killer and they start to kiss (until a guard shows up). \n"}, {"text": "The police were tipped off about Dr. Arden's mysterious belongings by one of his former patients.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSister Jude heads to her office to find Sister Mary Eunice picking out a cane to beat Kit and Grace; she comments on the noticeable difference in her demeanor and says it's a decided improvement.  Jude asks the duo if they're intentionally making a 'murder baby' and suggests sterilization for the both of them, but she's called away when the police arrive.  Sister Mary Eunice has Grace taken to solitary but keeps Kit in the room to show him Grace's file.  As she leaves, she says that Grace isn't the innocent girl she appears to be.\rSister Jude finds the police, two detectives, in Dr. Arden's lab and turns on the charm to get information.  The men say that there are allegations against the doctor in regards to \"roughing up a lady of the evening\".  Arden denies meeting her, but the girl says she found obscene photos and Nazi memorabilia in his home.  Jude is concerned by this last fact. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Thredson uses which of these to induce vomiting during Lana's aversion therapy session?", "correct": "Apomorphine", "options": ["Copper sulfate", "Ipecac", "Saltwater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApomorphine.\n\n\tIn his office, Dr. Thredson starts Lana on her aversion therapy by showing her pictures of women in erotic poses and hooking her up to a bag of apomorphine to induce vomiting.  The theory is that they're training her body to be repelled by certain triggers.  When he flips the slide he shows a slide of Wendy, her girlfriend, and claims he got it from her house when he stopped by.  He decides to try the conversion part of her therapy and brings another patient, Daniel, into the room before taking off his robes. Lana says she wants to do whatever works so Thredson asks her to regard his physique before stimulating herself. This doesn't work; she vomits into the bucket and cries because she desperately wants to cure herself and leave the asylum.  Thredson says that he thinks aversion/conversion therapy may not work for her. \n"}, {"text": "When the Monsignor feels that Sister Jude may feeling the pressure of her role at Briarcliff, he reminds her of which of these issues?", "correct": "Her drunken rant the previous week", "options": ["Her willingness to assist in performing Lana's shock therapy", "Her sordid past as a lounge singer", "Her previous transgressions with the law"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer drunken rant the previous week.\n\n\tSister Jude speaks to the Monsignor about the issues surrounding Dr. Arden (the prostitute, the Nazism, etc.).  He responds that her obsession needs to stop and when he asks her to reveal where she's getting her information, Jude brings up their inmate, 'Anne', and Monsignor doesn't believe her.  In fact, he brings up the fact that she imbibed the previous week, drinking the decanter of wine.  Perhaps, he thinks, the job is too much for her.  He asks her to go and pray on her issues and sends her off before calling Dr. Arden in his lab.  He recommends that he start cleaning up because people are onto what he's doing.\rSister Jude speaks with her Mother Superior and is convinced that she can right her wrongs and prevail because God loves to test his subjects and see them triumph. \n"}, {"text": "Who actually killed Grace's family?", "correct": "Grace", "options": ["Kit", "Grace's step-sister", "An unknown madman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrace.\n\n\tWhen Kit is brought to solitary he's placed in an adjacent cell to Grace and the two of them talk through the wall.  Kit says that he knows the truth-- she killed her step-mother and father.  She admits to it.  Her father sexually abused her when she was young.  When she told her step-mother, the woman never helped her.  Further, her one escape, her horses, were sold off by her father.  Grace killed both of them with an axe and was seen doing so by her step-sister.  Kit says that he admires her.\rIn the common room, Dr. Thredson apologizes to Lana for the aversion therapy issues.  He offers her the picture of Wendy and she worries that she'll have to hide it.  Thredson says it'll only be for a week; after the week, when he's done his evaluation he promises he's taking her with him. \n"}, {"text": "What does 'Anne' find locked away in the laboratory closet?", "correct": "Shelley", "options": ["Bloody Face", "Photographs", "A secret passage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShelley.\n\n\tKit heads to Sister Jude's office to confess about his crimes.  Jude is surprised by this, but he says that God sees everything anyways.  Even if he doesn't know if he actually did it, God will know all and he'll see the truth.  When Jude asks if he killed Alma, Kit says he must have.  When he says aliens can't exist, Jude flinches.  Kit asks her to help him find God.\rDr. Arden brings 'Anne' into the basement lab and he tries to keep her quiet.  When he knocks her back, she withdraws a gun from her pocket and aims it at him.  When the detectives were leaving the building she sneaked the gun from one of their jackets.  She hears a noise in a locked room and asks what it is.  When Arden advances on her, she shoots him in the leg and yells at him for the keys.  He finally passes them over and, unlocking the door, she finds Shelley's disfigured body inside, begging for someone to kill her. \n"}]}
