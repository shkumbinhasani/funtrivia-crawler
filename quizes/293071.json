About 98% of those who arrived were granted entry to the U.S., but reasons such as criminal backgrounds, insanity and contagious diseases were common reasons for refusal. \n"}, {"text": "Novelist E.M.

In December 1941, 'The New Yorker' magazine accepted a story called 'Slight Rebellion off Madison', about a disaffected schoolboy with pre-war jitters: the boy's name was Holden Caulfield. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the story was deemed unpublishable -- it would eventually appear in 1946. Meanwhile, Salinger was drafted and he served as an infantryman at Utah Beach on D-Day and in the Battle of the Bulge.\rIn 1951, Salinger resurrected Holden Caulfield as the narrator of his first (and only) novel, 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Reactions were varied... the NY Times review described it as \"... unusually brilliant ...\" while many countries actually banned it. The reclusive Salinger, by then a practising Zen Buddhist, withdrew completely from the publicity. Although he published some collections of short stories, he never wrote anything after 1965 and his last interview was in 1980. \n"}, {"text": "Which country joined the European Common Market alongside Ireland and Great Britain on New Year's Day in 1973?", "correct": "Denmark", "options": ["Portugal", "Greece", "Sweden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDenmark.\n\n\tThe European Economic Community, later European Community' morphed into the European Union with thw signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.\rThe expansion on January 1, 1973 was the first of many, with Ireland, Great Britain and Denmark joining the original six members (Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg and Italy). \rGreece joined in 1981, Portugal in 1986 (along with Spain), and Sweden in 1995 (with Austria and Finland).\rTen more countries joined on May 1, 2004, and a further two on January 1, 2007, bringing the total to 27. \n"}, {"text": "The singer/actor Maurice Chevalier, who died on January 1, 1972, was born in which country?", "correct": "France", "options": ["Canada", "U.S.A.", "Belgium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrance.\n\n\tMaurice Auguste Chevalier was born to a French father and Belgian mother on September 12, 1888 in Paris, France. \rHis trademark was a straw hat worn with a tuxedo.
