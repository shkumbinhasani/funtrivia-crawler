I know what a \"duck\" is. \"Retriever\"- I can figure that out. But what the heck does \"tolling\" refer to?", "correct": "These retrievers lured ducks closer to the hunter, which is known as \"tolling.\"", "options": ["These retrievers were so successful that they really \"took a toll on ducks.\"", "These retrievers bark when they are hunting, sounding like a bell- thus \"tolling.\"", "No one really knows, but it's a cool name, isn't it?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThese retrievers lured ducks closer to the hunter, which is known as \"tolling.\"\n\n\tHave you ever seen small songbirds mob a hawk or an owl? Ducks do much the same. When they spot a predator, they swim towards it, quacking and calling attention to the fact that the predator has been spotted. Hunters take advantage of this by having the Toller play the part of a predator. They throw something for the dog to retrieve, and the retrieving dog attracts the ducks. The hunter then rises up and shoots a duck, which the Toller then retrieves. \n"}, {"text": "Tollers were bred to look like what other animal?", "correct": "The red fox", "options": ["The dingo", "The coyote", "The wolf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe red fox.\n\n\tLegend has it that the red fox was the first toller. It is certain that ducks react more to dogs that at least somewhat resemble a fox. \n"}, {"text": "What unusual feature do Tollers have that other breeds of retriever do not have?", "correct": "A shrill, loud, whining bark", "options": ["Doubly-webbed feet", "A waterproof coat", "An extra dewclaw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA shrill, loud, whining bark.\n\n\tKnown as \"the Toller scream,\" this racket is produced by many of the breed when confronted with anything that they find exciting. \n"}, {"text": "What does a Toller look like?", "correct": "Coat is light to dark red and medium-length, usually has at least some white markings on feet, chest, tip of tail and/or face", "options": ["Coat is light to dark red and medium-length with randomly-distributed white patches all over the body", "Coat is light to dark blond and long, with black markings on face, ears and legs", "Coat is light to dark red and long, with no white allowed anywhere on the dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoat is light to dark red and medium-length, usually has at least some white markings on feet, chest, tip of tail and/or face.\n\n\tThe Toller is supposed to resemble a fox, and the white tail-tip is certainly foxlike,. The other white spots may not be foxlike, but are desirable. However, white anywhere but the feet, chest, tip of tail or face are not allowed on dogs in the show ring. \n"}, {"text": "What Dutch breed is similar to the Toller in looks and function, and may possibly be an ancestor?", "correct": "Kooikerhondje", "options": ["Dutch Smoushound", "Schipperke", "Danish Broholmer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKooikerhondje.\n\n\tAll of these are Dutch breeds. The Kooikerhondje (Kooiker for short) resembles a Toller but is smaller and has much more white. It tolls ducks into complicated traps, and is still used today to lure ducks into traps for banding. The Schipperke is a small, tailless black barge dog, the Smoushound is a shaggy breed used solely as a companion, and the Broholmer is a type of mastiff. \n"}, {"text": "Unfortunately, due to their small gene pool, Tollers are prone to several genetic diseases. Which of the following is NOT a Toller health concern?", "correct": "Sebaceous adenitis", "options": ["Addison's disease", "Megaesophagus", "Pulmonic stenosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSebaceous adenitis.\n\n\tSebaceous adenitis is a skin disease that is a problem in poodles, but isn't known in Tollers. Addison's disease is caused by malfunctioning adrenal glands. Megaesophagus is an inability of the esophagus to move food properly, resulting in difficulty eating and vomiting. Pulmonic stenosis is a heart defect. \n"}, {"text": "Many Tollers carry the gene for progressive retinal atrophy, an eye disorder that causes blindness. A test has been developed by Optigen to identify carriers of the disorder. According to Optigen test results, which of the following is a breeding that could produce puppies that will go blind?", "correct": "Optigen B to Optigen C", "options": ["All of these could produce blind puppies", "Optigen A to Optigen C", "Optigen A to Optigen B"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOptigen B to Optigen C.\n\n\tAn Optigen A dog does not carry the PRA gene. As PRA is an autosomal recessive, he can be bred to any dog of any test status and no affected puppies will be produced.\r An Optigen B dog carries one copy of the defective gene (and is thus called a \"carrier\") and can only produce blind puppies if bred to another dog that carries the gene. Thus, breeding an Optigen A dog to an Optigen B dog will not produce any blind puppies.\r An Optigen C dog carries two copies of the defective gene and will, eventually, go blind. Bred to an Optigen A dog, all puppies will be carriers but will not go blind. Bred to an Optigen B dog, half of the puppies will be carriers, and half will go blind. \n"}, {"text": "What is the temperament of most Tollers like with unfamiliar people?", "correct": "Reserved, but not aggressive or unfriendly", "options": ["Aggressive", "Very friendly, love everyone", "Shy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReserved, but not aggressive or unfriendly.\n\n\tUnlike Goldens or Labs, Tollers do not always instantly love everyone that they meet. However, a well-bred Toller should be neither shy nor aggressive with strangers. \n"}, {"text": "Many breeders require that anyone interested in a Toller puppy read the list \"Top 10 Reasons Not to Get a Toller.\" According to this list, what is the number 1 reason not to get a Toller?", "correct": "Vroom!", "options": ["Watch your cat", "Shedding and mess", "Smart, smart, smart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVroom!.\n\n\t\"Vroom!\" refers to the breed's high energy level and need for exercise. One version of this well-publicized list can be found at http://www.odetofarley.com/topten.html. \n"}, {"text": "As if \"Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever\" isn't enough of a name, Tollers have another name as well. What were they sometimes called?", "correct": "Little River Duck Dogs", "options": ["Red Decoy Dogs", "The Fox in Dog's Clothing", "The Duck Hunter's Companion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLittle River Duck Dogs.\n\n\tNamed after a river in southwestern Nova Scotia, \"Little River Duck Dogs\" was the popular name of this breed in the early 1900s. \n"}]}
