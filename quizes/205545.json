Where are we?", "correct": "Valley of Bowser", "options": ["Donut Plains", "Forest of Illusion", "Star Road"], "explanation": "\n\n\nValley of Bowser.\n\n\tIn \"Valley of Bowser\", we are basically right on Bowser's doorstep.  We can take a long route to his front door by passing through Larry's Castle, or we can take the back door route by defeating Reznor in the \"Valley Fortress\".  We could visit the \"Chocolate Secret\" and \"Donut Secret 2\" levels, but we'd need to take pipes located around the world to reach them. \n"}, {"text": "We are now in a level which mostly takes place within a giant cave.  Where are we?", "correct": "Vanilla Dome", "options": ["Special World", "Valley of Bowser", "Cheese Bridge Area"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVanilla Dome.\n\n\tVanilla Dome is home to the \"Red Switch Palace\".

At the top of the cave, there is another fortress with another Reznor boss. \n"}, {"text": "There are more warp points in this area than levels.  Where are we?", "correct": "Star Road & Star World", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Road & Star World.\n\n\tTo get to Star Road, we have to visit the Star Road warp points around the island.  These are located in Donut Plains, Vanilla Dome, Cheese Bridge Area, Forest of Illusion, and Valley of Bowser.  The only way we can navigate to different levels within Star Road is if we find the secret exits to the levels. \n"}, {"text": "In this area, Ludwig Von Koopa reigns supreme until we blast his castle into a mountain.  Which area are we in?", "correct": "Cheese Bridge Area", "options": ["Forest of Illusion", "Vanilla Dome", "Chocolate Land"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheese Bridge Area.\n\n\tCheese Bridge Area doesn't only include Cheese Bridge, but it also includes the Butter Bridge which is just overtop of it.

For example, the island changes seasons from summer to fall. \n"}, {"text": "This area is accessed after we beat Roy Koopa in the fifth castle.  Which area are we in?", "correct": "Chocolate Island & Chocolate Land", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate Island & Chocolate Land.\n\n\tIn Chocolate Land, we beat many rocky, barren levels to reach Wendy Koopa in the sixth castle.

Which area are we in now?", "correct": "Forest of Illusion", "options": ["Vanilla Dome", "Donut Plains", "Chocolate Land"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForest of Illusion.\n\n\tIn Forest of Illusion, we need to find many secret exits to find our way around.  There are many different paths which lead in useless directions, and we could end up finding new paths to levels we've already beaten.
