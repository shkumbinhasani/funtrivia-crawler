{"id": "238286", "name": "\"Ocarina of Time\" In Other Words Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Video Games Wordplay", "Video Games In Other Words"], "questions": [{"text": "Steel shoes", "correct": "Iron Boots", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nIron Boots.\n\n\tThe Iron Boots are found by Link in the cold Ice Cavern when he's an adult.  Link requires these heavy boots in order to access the entrance to the Water Temple in Lake Hylia.  They also allow Link to walk through large windy areas because they keep him weighted to the ground.  The Iron Boots also make an appearance in \"Wind Waker\" and \"Twilight Princess\", both for future systems (the Gamecube and the Wii respectively).  In \"Ocarina of Time\", the Hover Shoes are the opposite. They'll make Link lose friction and struggle to stand still.  They may also save you from falling over an edge for a second. \n"}, {"text": "Misplaced Forest", "correct": "Lost Woods", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLost Woods.\n\n\tThe Lost Woods are next to Kokiri Village and the Sacred Forest Meadow.  This area is home to many Deku Scrubs and winding paths that will be sure to mix up a novice player.  Here, tunnels link the forest to Goron Village and Zora's Domain.  Also, players can upgrade their slingshot seed satchels and complete parts of the trading game in this area.  Link needs to pass through the woods to reach the Forest Temple as an adult, and to get Saria's Song as a child. \n"}, {"text": "Blade of its owner", "correct": "Master Sword", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaster Sword.\n\n\tThe Master Sword is Link's primary weapon as an adult and it is not possible to use as child Link due to the fact that it sits in the Pedestal of Time until it is pulled out.  To reach the Master Sword, Link must gather the three Spiritual Stones and use them to open the large door in the Temple of Time.  This weapon is also the only weapon that can defeat the evil Ganon in the end of the game on the site of Hyrule Castle. \n"}, {"text": "Shrine of the Soul", "correct": "Spirit Temple", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpirit Temple.\n\n\tThis temple is either the fourth or the fifth that you will visit as an adult depending on how you choose to complete the game.  In this temple, you'll need to use your skills as both child Link and adult Link in order to complete tasks in two halves of the temple.  As a child, the sage of the temple, Nabooru, will ask you to obtain the Silver Gauntlets, but as an adult, you'll be on a quest for the Mirror Shield.  The boss of this temple is the fearsome duo, Koume and Kotake, who make up Twinrova.  This temple is in the Desert Colossus. \n"}, {"text": "Drum Drum", "correct": "Bongo Bongo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBongo Bongo.\n\n\tBongo Bongo, the boss of the Shadow Temple, is named so because he attacks you by smashing the ground, which in this case is a giant bongo drum.  Bongo Bongo can be attacked on his hands and his eye, but to do this you will often be found using your Lens of Truth and Fairy Bow.  After the battle, you will be given the Shadow Medallion by the sage of the temple and leader of the Sheikahs, Impa, who is also the guardian of Princess Zelda. \n"}, {"text": "(Pressure*Area)(Pressure*Area)(Pressure*Area)", "correct": "Triforce", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTriforce.\n\n\tComposed of the Triforces of Power, Wisdom, and Courage, the Triforce is a major item in the storyline of this game.  One piece is held by Link while the other two are held by Princess Zelda and Ganondorf.  This device, which can grant a possessor's wishes (if all three pieces are held) was created by the three godesses, Din, Nayru, and Farore, who also created Hyrule (according to legends). \n"}, {"text": "Fatal Peak", "correct": "Death Mountain", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeath Mountain.\n\n\tDeath Mountain, which looms over Kakariko Village, is home to Goron City, Dodongo's Cavern, and the Fire Temple.  As a child, Link can meet the Gorons and obtain a Spiritual Stone, the Goron Ruby, in this area.  As an adult, Link will need to venture into the Death Mountain Crater to visit the Fire Temple and battle the evil Volvagia, who plans to eat the Goron race.  Using the Megaton Hammer (and a Fire Tunic) Link can defeat this beast. \n"}, {"text": "Fragments of a blood-pumping organ", "correct": "Heart Pieces & Pieces of Heart", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeart Pieces & Pieces of Heart.\n\n\tThroughout the game, Link can collect Heart Pieces in order to extend his maximum life bar.  These Heart Pieces are scattered all over Hyrule and each one ranges in difficulty to collect.  To add a Heart to the bar, Link must accumulate four Heart Pieces.  A Heart Container, on the other hand, which is only obtained after a boss battle, will immediately give Link a full Heart for the bar.  There are only eight of these in the game. \n"}, {"text": "Optical glass of certainty", "correct": "Lens of Truth", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLens of Truth.\n\n\tThe Lens of Truth is found in the Bottom of the Well, and using this magical device, you can journey into the Shadow Temple and the Spirit Temple with more ease.  The item allows Link to see beyond what is really in front of him and it also allows him to see through chests (perfect for the Treasure Chest Game in Hyrule Market).  The object has one downside though: it uses Link's Magic Power while it is being used. \n"}, {"text": "Metallic finger joints", "correct": "Iron Knuckle & Iron Knuckles", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nIron Knuckle & Iron Knuckles.\n\n\tThe Iron Knuckle is a powerful enemy most-found in the Spirit Temple in the Desert Colossus.  Although the armor of this creature will not be dented by many of Link's weapons, Link can use his sword or bombs to harm it.  If Link is able to slice off the Iron Knuckle's armor, its speed will vastly improve and Link will need to run and swipe. The mighty axe of the Iron Knuckle is great for knocking down pillars, which may contain health, magic, or items in the Spirit Temple.  Nabooru, the Sage of Spirit, is brainwashed to become an Iron Knuckle after she is captured by Koume and Kotake when Link visits the temple as a child. \n"}]}
