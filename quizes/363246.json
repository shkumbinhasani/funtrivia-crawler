{"id": "363246", "name": "Chopping Mall Online Trivia | C | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "C", "Cg - Cl Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Three security robots are purchased by what mall?", "correct": "Park Plaza Mall", "options": ["Twin Pines Mall", "Chopping Mall", "Mall of America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPark Plaza Mall.\n\n\tAs if criminals are bad enough to warrant this important acquisition, the Park Plaza Mall decides that three security robots are required to roam the building at night, one per floor, to ensure that stores are not broken into.  At the same time, the exits are outfitted with locking metal doors designed to shut anyone and everyone in fifteen minutes after the mall's closing time, opening the next morning (which seems horribly inconvenient).  How do the robots differentiate between mall worker and nasty bad guy?  All employees are given an identification card to scan. This couldn't possibly go wrong. \n"}, {"text": "Where is the power supply/circuit system for the security box located?", "correct": "On the roof", "options": ["Off in Texas somewhere", "In the basement", "In a janitor closet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn the roof.\n\n\tThe Protector-101 series robots are installed a week after their demo for mall personnel, and, after their control panel on the roof (which enables the robots to patch into the mall's phone system to call the police) is installed, they're pretty much ready to go.  In fact, their demonstrator goes so far as to call the system 'foolproof'.  \"Absolutely nothing can go wrong,\" he claims.  On the fateful night, a couple of lightning strikes to the roof sends them haywire, killing their operators and sending them on a rampage. \n"}, {"text": "In which store does the main group of friends try to party?", "correct": "Furniture store", "options": ["Pet store", "Diner", "Clothing store"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFurniture store.\n\n\tThe nightmare begins as the day comes to an end.  Suzie convinces the new girl, Allison, to come to a party in the mall -- some of the guys working at the furniture store are hosting a shindig with some friends and they're all planning on getting drunk and fooling around before the place locks down at midnight, trapping them until dawn. The guys in the furniture store have married couple Rick and Linda coming with the beer and they convince relative nerd, Ferdy, to hang around.  He's inevitably introduced to Allison and, while they watch sci-fi movies for a few hours, it becomes apparent that they're a perfect match. \n"}, {"text": "One of the girls, Leslie, is shot multiple times by a security bot (at this point, a 'kill-bot').  What happens?", "correct": "Her head explodes.", "options": ["She's nudged off a balcony.", "She gets electrocuted.", "She's crushed by an elevator."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer head explodes.\n\n\tAlthough the night is going great, Leslie needs her smokes and Mike has to go out into the mall to use the machine to get them.  When he rounds the corner and tries the machine, one of the security robots, now a full-fledged 'kill-bot', refuses his ID, cornering him, tranquilizing him, and ripping out his throat with its clamps. Unfortunately, Leslie can't wait any longer.  She goes out to find him and trips over her boyfriend's corpse, screaming.  This, of course, alerts the kill-bot hiding behind some maintenance doors (though how it opens them is left to the imagination) and it chases her through the mall. Although its lasers strike her in the back multiple times, it isn't until a shot to the skull, taken when everyone is watching, makes the most important direct hit of her life; her head explodes. \n"}, {"text": "In an attempt to save the girls, the surviving men tell them to escape the mall through the vents.  Does this escape actually happen?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe robots take it upon themselves to break into the furniture store for further carnage, blasting through the windows and chasing the now-frightened teens into the storage room.  They soon realize that the security doors, locked until dawn, have shut for the night.  To save their lives, the men boost the women into the heated air ducts to get them out to the parking garage while they fight to put an end to the kill-bot threat inside (since they run out of time).  It's naive to think that the girls don't have some ill-fated reasoning; they end up going back into the mall because Suzie is too worried about Greg. It's what gets her killed.  The girls head into the mall loaded with molotov cocktails, but a kill-bot shoots the gas canister in her hand, setting her ablaze. \n"}, {"text": "One of the 'kill-bots' is destroyed using which of these typical mall amenities?", "correct": "Elevator", "options": ["Bathroom hand-dryer", "Fountain", "Escalator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElevator.\n\n\tWhile the girls are busy throwing themselves into the fray once again, making the guys' sacrifices for naught, the guys are busy harnessing propane tanks to the top of an elevator; when the kill-bot gets inside, BOOM!  They also happen to have guns, but these prove relatively ineffective against the metal shells of their enemies. The kill-bots resume their pursuit and Rick lures one into the elevator, but the teens are unable to hit the propane tanks...that is until Allison takes a gun and brings it down in a single shot.  The group decides to head up to the top floor of the mall to take out the robots from their computer and Greg, ascending an escalator, comes face-to-face with a kill-bot. It throws him off a third-story balcony to his death. \n"}, {"text": "While hiding in a two-story department store, the 'kill-bots' reveal which hidden talent, allowing them to gain entry?", "correct": "The ability to solder through metal", "options": ["Persuasive power to goad them out", "Instant keycard access to any store", "The ability to shrink and enlarge at any time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe ability to solder through metal.\n\n\tAfter Greg is killed, the remaining four find sanctuary in a department store, locking themselves in to wait out the remaining time in the night.  But where's the fun in that?  They prepare for an inevitable break-in by setting up a series of mirrors and mannequins, fooling the last two kill-bots once their lasers have cut through the metal doors, literally melting through the metal.  During their daring escape, Linda gets shot and killed by a kill-bot (though her head never explodes). \n"}, {"text": "Rick, in a daring attempt to seek vengeance for his murdered wife, ends up getting himself electrocuted by what means?", "correct": "He drives a trolley into a kill-bot.", "options": ["He puts an axe through a fuse box.", "He intentionally grabs a taser line.", "He tries to rig a booby trap and fails."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe drives a trolley into a kill-bot.\n\n\tRick, distraught over losing his wife, decides to take drastic actions, performing a kamikaze maneuver on a mall maintenance trolley by driving it into an already electrified kill-bot.  It destroys the second of the three security drones, but kills him in the process, zapping him to death (which is a shame because it's not like you can't get off it before it crashes).  Unfortunately, there's one kill-bot left, so Ferdy and Allison get no time to mourn two more casualties. They split up to search for the computers upstairs, but the kill-bot finds Allison first.  Ferdy arrives to save her and manages to shoot out its lasers (finally someone shoots the thing in its only vulnerable spot) but he's incapacitated. \n"}, {"text": "At one point in the film, the otherwise meek Allison reveals which of these facts?", "correct": "Her father was a marine.", "options": ["Her mother previously fought kill-bots.", "She's been controlling the kill-bots the whole time.", "She knows how to limbo."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer father was a marine.\n\n\tAllison's father being a marine is a big help -- she's able to shoot down the propane tanks on the elevator and, when push comes to shove, she proves to be a tenacious runner.  After Ferdy is knocked out by a heavy fire extinguisher to the gut, there's a frantic sprint through the mall corridors and Allison takes refuge in a pet shop, hiding in the most inconvenient spots (ie. the floor, right where rampant snakes and tarantulas are able to crawl all over her).  When she's finally able to make an escape, it turns out it didn't matter anyways -- the kill-bot finds her soon after when she screams at something insignificant. And so recommences the running. \n"}, {"text": "Does anyone survive the massacre in the mall?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAfter constant fleeing, falling several stories to the ground floor, and hiding away in a paint store, Allison gets the idea to use a previously-hidden flare and trap the kill-bot in a pool of paint and thinner; she opens several cans and drops them on the ground.  When the time comes she lures the kill-bot into the store and, while it skids out on the wet floor, she lets out the ironic line \"have a nice day\" (a kill-bot classic by this point) and tosses the flare inside, causing a respectable explosion.\r Fortunately, that's all three kill-bots.  Allison wanders the mall until the sun rises at which point Ferdy wakes up, having only been knocked unconscious by the injury he sustained.  He looks at her as if to say \"well, thankfully you dealt with this problem.\"  Just goes to show that a father in the marines can go a long way; the rest of us would probably spend the time passed out somewhere until the issue passed.  She doesn't seem to care that his snarky \"nice shot\" comment is actually borderline rude considering the circumstances, so they hug it out. \n"}]}
