Cutting between actual documentary footage from sessions with Dr. Abigail Tyler's patients, sessions between herself and the director, Olatunde Osunsanmi, and between actual narrative (in which the doctor is played by Jovovich), the film investigated 'The Fourth Kind' of alien encounter: abduction. The film doubled its budget bringing in $20,000,000 overall.  Regardless, it didn't do too well with the critics.  \"The Box\", on the other hand, was more successful with critics but couldn't recoup half its budget, only taking in $15,000,000. \n"}, {"text": "Which 2009 film was remade from a movie originally released in 1972 and directed by Wes Craven?", "correct": "The Last House on the Left", "options": ["The Stepfather", "The Hills Have Eyes", "A Nightmare on Elm Street"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Last House on the Left.\n\n\tAfter almost forty years, \"The Last House on the Left\" was remade by director Dennis Illadis and starred Monica Potter and Tony Goldwyn.
