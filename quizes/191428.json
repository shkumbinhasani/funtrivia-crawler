{"id": "191428", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'The Merchant of Korea' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "Radar appears in the Swamp with good news for BJ.  A telegram from Peg has come, informing BJ that they are now eligible to purchase an acre of land at what location near the San Francisco bay area?", "correct": "Stinson Beach", "options": ["Berkeley", "Half Moon Bay", "Redwood City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStinson Beach.\n\n\tBJ is tickled pink, and he should be.  Stinson Beach is a lovely stretch of northern California coast along the Pacific Ocean.  It's not far from Mill Valley, where BJ and Peg call home.  All BJ needs to do is send Peg money for a down payment, and the acre of land is theirs.  That's the tricky part. \n"}, {"text": "BJ is in a bind.  He merely needs to provide Peg with enough cash for a down payment and the acre of land is theirs.  Unfortunately, payday is not until the following day, and BJ hasn't got any money to wire home.  He is forced to turn to Charles, the moneybags of the 4077th.  Charles is uncharacteristically glad to loan BJ the neat and tidy sum of $___.  (Fill in the blank) ", "correct": "200", "options": ["1000", "500", "10000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n200.\n\n\tFor what seems like a pittance in the modern era, $200, BJ and Peg can make a down payment for their lovely beach property.  As BJ hasn't got the cash, and he certainly cannot count on Hawkeye or Radar for that large a sum, he must turn to Charles in what will become a Faustian bargain. \n"}, {"text": "Not long after BJ has received the funds he needs from Charles, he begins to learn the true meaning of the phrase 'neither a borrower nor a lender be'.  Charles begins asking small favors of BJ in return for the debt of gratitude he feels he is owed.  What is the first favor that Charles asks of BJ?", "correct": "To assist in closing a patient of Charles' in the O.R.", "options": ["To fetch Charles some dinner", "To take Charles' turn at post-op duty", "To provide Charles with breakfast in bed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo assist in closing a patient of Charles' in the O.R.\n\n\tChoppers arrive at camp seconds after the loan is made from Charles to BJ.  At the end of a long O.R. session, Charles asks BJ to assist him with a patient.  This assistance includes sewing the closing stitches.  BJ suggests that this is highly irregular, but Charles convinces him by means of a reminder of their earlier 'business transaction'. \n"}, {"text": "The second favor Charles asks of BJ is for his Swampmate to fetch him a cup of coffee.  BJ is very reluctant to submit to this request, but Charles feigns pain in which part of his body in order to emphasize his needs?", "correct": "Back", "options": ["Head", "Foot", "Leg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBack.\n\n\tThe following morning, BJ and Hawkeye are off to the mess tent for some breakfast.  Charles remains in bed and, just before BJ exits the tent, requests a small favor.  He asks BJ to pour him a cup of coffee.  BJ refuses.  Charles then feigns back pain while rising from his cot and BJ succombs with annoyance to his tentmates machinations. \n"}, {"text": "That morning while everyone enjoys their wonderful breakfasts in the mess tent, Radar arrives with bad news.  The 4077th has not receive adequate funds to pay all of the personnel.  Most unfortunately, none of the officers is able to receive their paychecks.  Colonel Potter's solution is to have his wife Mildred send him $50 for what particular purpose, according to the Colonel?", "correct": "Sophie's blanket", "options": ["Donation to Father Mulcahy's orphans", "A tab at Rosie's", "Poker funds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSophie's blanket.\n\n\tThe officers are especially annoyed at their lack of funds, and in particular Margaret seems irked.  She becomes doubly so when she finds out that Donald has tied up all of her cash in savings bonds and is unwilling to forward her some emergency cash.  Colonel Potter calls her a 'live grenade'.  His only concern seems to be for a blanket he is purchasing for his horse Sophie.  Why would a horse need a blanket, by the way? \n"}, {"text": "The failure of the 4077th to receive ample money for officer's pay hits home not only for BJ, but also for Hawkeye.  We already know why BJ becomes indebted to Charles, but why is it that Hawkeye needs to borrow funds from Major Winchester?", "correct": "To pay off his bar tab at the officer's club", "options": ["To pay off a local businessman for some tailoring work", "To purchase a new subscription to his favorite nudist magazine", "To pay Radar for a loan he made the month before"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo pay off his bar tab at the officer's club.\n\n\tWhile at the bar at the officer's club, Hawkeye offers a round of drinks to his two Swamp-mates.  It is here that Zale informs Hawkeye of his outstanding debt of $50 dollars, $30 dollars over the usual maximum bar tab allowance.  Charles is happy to pay off Hawkeye's tab, and in return he asks only for Hawkeye to have a beer ready for him at the Swamp when he returns from post-op duty at 10 PM.  'I have the uneasy feeling that I've just been had,' says a suddenly piqued Hawkeye.  'Perhaps that's because you've just been had,' says BJ, suddenly filled with a gleeful Schadenfreude. \n"}, {"text": "Back at the Swamp, Hawkeye stews over his newfound master-and-servant relationship with Charles.  Meanwhile, BJ conjures up an incredibly clever idea on how to break even with the unwitting Charles.  He recommends a 'friendly' game of poker with the Charles, a neophyte to the game.  Charles suggests instead that they play what game if wagering is to be involved?", "correct": "Cribbage", "options": ["Chess", "Bridge", "Backgammon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCribbage.\n\n\tAs most fans of 'M*A*S*H' know very well, Charles is a cribbage shark.  In fact, it is his skill at the game that landed him at the 4077th in the first place.  However, his skills with poker are unknown, and BJ and Hawkeye attempt to exploit this by enticing Charles into a dollar ante game.  Charles, a self-proclaimed 'very lucky person', accepts. \n"}, {"text": "Word gets around that a poker game will commence, and Charles will be the big dupe.  Everyone from Colonel Potter to Klinger joins the game, all hoping to take a chunk of Charles' change.  What they all don't realize is that Charles is 'awfully lucky'.  He wins the first hand played with which of the following poker hands?", "correct": "Straight", "options": ["Four of a kind", "Full house", "Flush"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStraight.\n\n\tThe participants of the game include: Hawkeye, BJ, Margaret, Colonel Potter, Father Mulcahy, Radar, Klinger and Charles.  All believe they will come away winners, but Charles soon makes it clear that he has no intention of being their stooge.  He wins the first hand with a straight from a four-card draw.  Charles comes away with a tidy sum of his opponents' collective money during the first half of the game. \n"}, {"text": "After an unspecified amount of playing time, Charles is well ahead in the game, having won an ample amount from each of the other players.  While he gets a breath of fresh air, the losing players talk amongst themselves.  They discover that Charles is giving away his hands by whistling louder when he is bluffing.  By the way, Charles whistles a piece from which of the following operas?", "correct": "La Traviata", "options": ["Fidelio", "Carmen", "The Marriage of Figaro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLa Traviata.\n\n\tSpecifically, he whistles a portion of the drinking song from the first act of Verdi's 'La Traviata'.  When the other players discover Charles' whistling style, the game becomes mere child's play to them. \n"}, {"text": "By the end of the episode, Charles has been cleaned out of his entire fortune (at least, the one on hand), and all the other people who played with Charles are big winners.  Perhaps the biggest winner is BJ, who talks with his wife Peg as the episode closes.  What has Peg sent him from home to make him feel optimistic about his new land purchase?", "correct": "A jar of dirt", "options": ["Some pine cones", "Some water from the San Francisco Bay", "A stone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA jar of dirt.\n\n\tBJ handles a small jar of dirt while he talks with Peg.  The dirt comes from the land they have just purchased at Stinson Beach.  In this day and age, that land would be worth millions, quite a happy outcome indeed for the Hunnicuts!\r Thank you for having tried this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my other M*A*S*H-related quizzes here at Quizzyland. \n"}]}
