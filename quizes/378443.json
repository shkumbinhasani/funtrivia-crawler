{"id": "378443", "name": "Strange Things Are Happening II Quiz | Movies | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "What happened at the end of the movie \"Escape From the Planet of the Apes\"?", "correct": "A chimpanzee said, \"Mama!\"", "options": ["The apes got the right to vote.", "The apes blew up the Earth again.", "Taylor finally returned."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA chimpanzee said, \"Mama!\".\n\n\tThe answer that probably sounds the most silly is the correct answer.  The man who was trying to kill the apes from the future shot Zira and the baby chimpanzee.  However, the chimpanzees had been switched, so Zira's child was still at the carnival, and being intelligent it said, \"Mama!\"  This set the stage for the talking chimpanzee to grow up to become Caesar in \"Conquest for the Planet of the Apes\", and lead a revolt of ape slaves. Of course, the plot of \"Escape From the Planet of the Apes\" was that three talking chimpanzees went back in time to the 1970s United States after the Earth was said to have blown up in \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\". \n"}, {"text": "In which movie did \"Puberty Love\" get rid of a bunch of monsters?", "correct": "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "options": ["Gremlins", "Return of the Living Dead", "Ghoulies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttack of the Killer Tomatoes.\n\n\tTo show that anything could be a movie monster, a bunch of mutated tomatoes killed people in \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\".  The hero, Mason Dixon, discovered that an awful song called \"Puberty Love\" turned the mutants back into regular tomatoes. \n"}, {"text": "In what movie did Tom Arnold sing \"I'm My Own Grandpa\"?", "correct": "The Stupids", "options": ["Fast Times At Ridgemont High", "True Lies", "Big Bully"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Stupids.\n\n\t\"The Stupids\" involved a day in the life of an odd family, beginning with Tom Arnold, as Mr. Stupid, investigating where the garbage truck took his trash.  He happened to see a military man illegally selling weapons, and the chase was on.  He eventually ended up on a daytime talk show in which people talked about their strange relationships, and Tom replied that he was his own grandpa. Then he sang \"I'm My Own Grandpa\", an old country song. \n"}, {"text": "In which movie did a man begin to develop a split personality after he interrupted a woman breast feeding?", "correct": "Me, Myself, and Irene", "options": ["Jekyll and Hyde: Together Again", "Hide and Seek", "Amos and Andrew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMe, Myself, and Irene.\n\n\tJim Carrey played one of the strangest heroes in the history of movies.  At the beginning of the movie, he became a policeman in Rhode Island and got married, but his wife had an affair with a black midget, and she gave birth to black triplets and moved away, leaving Jim to raise them.  Later in the movie, he saw a woman breast-feeding a baby and did what he felt like doing, which resulted in a \"Clint Eastwood\" personality taking him over. He was assigned to protect a woman named Irene on the way to testify against someone, but people were trying to kill them along the way, and sometimes he didn't know what he was doing because his other personality would take over, and he wouldn't remember what he did when he became the other person. \n"}, {"text": "Who played the evil robot in \"Inspector Gadget\"?", "correct": "Matthew Broderick", "options": ["Dabney Coleman", "Glenn Strange", "Shorty MacGuffin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatthew Broderick.\n\n\tOf course, the plot of \"Inspector Gadget\" was that a security guard was injured and had most of his parts replaced with machinery.  The corporation wanted to prove that it could create a robot policeman, so the man was renamed \"Inspector Gadget\" and assigned to the police department.  However, most of the time he was clumsy, a combination of Maxwell Smart and Dynomutt.  The bad guy, who called himself \"The Claw\", stole the plans to the robot and built his own evil version of Inspector Gadget, so Matthew Broderick played both the good Gadget and the evil robot. \n"}, {"text": "In which movie did Bob Newhart play Major Major Major?", "correct": "Catch 22", "options": ["First Family", "Cold Turkey", "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatch 22.\n\n\tIn the movie \"Catch 22\", based on the book, he played a character whose last name was Major.  In the Army Air Corps he had gotten promoted to Captain, but when the General saw \"Capt. Major\" listed in the roll call book, he said that didn't look right, so he promoted him to Major.  Major's father had given him the first name of Major, so the roll call book listed him as \"Maj. Major Major\".  The main plot of the book and the movie was that if someone was crazy, they didn't have to fly any more dangerous missions, but if someone didn't want to fly any more dangerous missions, that proved they were not crazy. Maj. Major also had a strange rule:  If he was in his office, anyone wanting to see him had to wait outside the office until office hours were over, but if Maj. Major was not in his office, anyone wanting to see him could go right in, but Major wouldn't be there. \n"}, {"text": "In which movie did a car run over a woman when she was in her house talking on the telephone?", "correct": "The Car", "options": ["Car Wash", "Christine", "The Omen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Car.\n\n\tIn the movie \"The Car\", a car drove around without a driver and ran over people whenever it felt like it.  This movie was made after some of the comedy movies were made about Herbie, the Love Bug but before the movie \"Christine\", about another car which was alive and ran over people.  The wife of a policeman had yelled at the car, and thought she was safe in her house, but the car crashed into her house anyway and killed her. After some nice people had gotten run over, including the police chief, an explosives expert who beat his wife was persuaded to blow up the car, so the \"bad guy\" ended up saving people. \n"}, {"text": "In which movie did people watch a woman dream about a robot cowboy?", "correct": "Future World", "options": ["A Nightmare On Elm Street", "Westworld", "Dreamscape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFuture World.\n\n\t\"Future World\" was the continuation of the movie \"Westworld\" in which people went to amusement parks populated with life-like robots to let them play out their fantasies.  At the Westworld park, a robot cowboy got tired of letting people shoot it \"to death\", so after the technicians brought it back again it started shooting people to death. In \"Future World\" reporters were investigating the new robot amusement park.  A woman reporter let herself get hooked up to a machine which let people watch her dream as if it were a movie.  She had a romantic dream about the killer cowboy robot from the first movie. (I can't believe how stupid this sounds.) \n"}, {"text": "In which movie did a computer kill people when they turned 30 years old?", "correct": "Logan's Run", "options": ["Soylent Green", "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", "The Omega Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLogan's Run.\n\n\tIn \"Logan's Run\" everyone lived in a city controlled by a computer which provided entertainment and food and everyone's needs.  However, when the spot on someone's hand changed color, they had to do a ceremony in which they got zapped, and supposedly went to a place similar to heaven.  The computer itself had only been programmed with partial information, so it ordered Logan to find out where \"sanctuary\" was. It turned Logan's spot a different color, which showed people that he was 30 years old, and the police chased him.  He escaped the city with his girlfriend and eventually found a man with a white beard, which proved that people could live past 30.  \n"}, {"text": "In which movie did Bob Newhart try to get Tom Poston to smoke?", "correct": "Cold Turkey", "options": ["Light It Up", "First Family", "Catch 22"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCold Turkey.\n\n\tIn the movie \"Cold Turkey\", Bob Newhart convinced a cigarette company to offer a cash prize to any town which could stop its citizens from smoking for one month.  He said that the publicity would make people want to smoke even more, and no town full of people could possibly stop smoking for a whole month.However, a small town decided to stop smoking, going \"cold turkey\", and some of the people went crazy.  On the final night of the contest, Bob Newhart arrived in town to try to convince someone to smoke.  Newhart's real life friend, Tom Poston, was there with a lighter that looked like a gun.  Poston picked up a real gun which looked like his lighter, and accidentally shot Newhart. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these movies starring singer/actress Andrea Marcovicci concerned a strange kind of monster that comes from under the ground?", "correct": "The Stuff", "options": ["The Front", "The Hand", "The Concorde"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Stuff.\n\n\tIn \"The Stuff\" someone drilling for oil accidentally found a white goo which people could eat.  It looked like plain yogurt, but in this movie when people ate it, they became addicted to it, and did everything they could to get other people to eat it, too.  Eventually, the people eating too much of the stuff turned into blobs of goo. Two reporters, one of them Andrea, found out what was going on, and a law was passed against selling The Stuff, but two men who ran the company decided to use small amounts of it in a new product called \"The Taste\".  The reporters forced the company men to eat the product until they became addicted, and a character asked, \"Are you eating it or is it eating you?\" \n"}, {"text": "In which of these movies did Andrea Marcovicci co-star with Michael Caine?", "correct": "The Hand", "options": ["The Concorde", "The Front", "The Stuff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hand.\n\n\tIt seems funny to me that she did so many movies with short titles.  On television she had been in a daytime soap opera, but then she popped up in the movies \"The Hand\", with Michael Caine, \"The Front\", with Woody Allen, \"The Stuff\", with Michael Moriarty, and \"The Concorde\" (also known as \"Airport '79\"), with John Davidson.  Of course, \"The Hand\" involved Michael Caine's dismembered hand supposedly running around murdering people, or maybe he imagined it.  Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay. \n"}, {"text": "In which Woody Allen movie did a giant breast roll around squirting milk on people?", "correct": "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask", "options": ["Bananas", "Sleeper", "Annie Hall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEverything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask.\n\n\tThe movie \"Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask\" took questions from a sex guide and turned them into short comedy films.  Tony Randall, Burt Reynolds, and Regis Philbin played small parts.  In one of the little stories, John Carradine was a mad scientist who tried to enlarge a woman's breasts, but it went out of control, and one breast grew to gigantic proportions and rolled around squirting milk, which made the people who were running away from it slip and fall. \n"}, {"text": "What made the monsters grow in \"Monolith Monsters\"?", "correct": "Water", "options": ["Rock", "Sand", "Diamonds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWater.\n\n\tOne movie which gave a good example of alien life which was completely different than people or animals was \"The Monolith Monsters\".  Years before \"The Blob\" or \"2001\", a meteorite crashed from space, and a strange form of black rock would reach water and grow very tall and fall over, breaking into smaller pieces. If the pieces got to a water source, each piece would grow incredibly tall and fall over and break, and the process would keep repeating itself until they used up all the water on Earth.  Anyone touching a monolith would get a piece of it inside his body, and it would absorb all the water inside his body until he turned to stone. The monolith creature was a form of alien life that had to be gotten rid of, because people had no use for it at all, which makes me think it's silly for people to want to travel to another planet just to find a strange form of life which could possibly do nothing but harm. \n"}, {"text": "What planet did Abbott and Costello land on in \"Abbott and Costello Go To Mars\"?", "correct": "Venus", "options": ["Mars", "Pluto", "Jupiter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVenus.\n\n\tThis seems like it would be easy, but it's not.  Scientists spent the movie talking about sending people to Mars while Abbott and Costello accidentally flew away with the rocket, landed at the Mardi Gras, and took off with two escaped criminals.  Someone said he didn't want to go to Mars, so Costello flipped a switch, and they ended up landing on Venus, which was inhabited by beautiful women (real life beauty contestants).  After finding out Lou Costello lied to her, the queen placed a curse on any woman kissing a man. When Lou kissed a woman, she showed her real age, and turned into an old woman. \n"}]}
