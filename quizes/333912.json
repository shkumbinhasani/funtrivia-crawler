{"id": "333912", "name": "Celebrity Doggelgangers Quiz | Celebrity Grab Bag | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Celebrity Trivia", "Celebrities Mixture", "Celebrity Grab Bag"], "questions": [{"text": "This comedienne resembles a puli, but only because of her dreadlocks.  Pulis also have fur that resembles dreads.  This sister acts, she sings, has a talk show, and is a comedienne!  Who is the actress?", "correct": "Whoopi Goldberg", "options": ["Oprah Winfrey", "Aretha Franklin", "Margaret Avery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhoopi Goldberg.\n\n\tWhoopi Goldberg was born in 1955 as Caryn Elaine Johnson.  She first starred in \"The Color Purple\" in 1985.  As an added clue, I said \"this sister acts...\"  \"Sister Act\" was another movie Whoopi Goldberg starred in, in 1992.\r The puli is a medium-sized herding dog with tight curls as its coat, and they are very similar to dreadlocks.  It makes the dog almost perfectly waterproof.  You don't have to look very hard to see that Whoopi's hair and the fur of a puli look nearly identical. \n"}, {"text": "This singer tends to go from straight to curly hair, to straight, to curly again.  Back and forth she goes, but when it's really curly, she resembles a poodle with its curly hair.  She often sang with Fleetwood Mac.  Say you will get this right; who is the singer?", "correct": "Stevie Nicks", "options": ["Cher", "Pat Benatar", "Barbra Streisand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStevie Nicks.\n\n\tStevie Nicks was born in 1948.  She often sang with Fleetwood Mac, making several albums with him.  These include \"Rumours\" (1977), \"Tango in the Night\" (1987), and \"Behind the Mask\" (1990).  However, I added an extra clue, which was \"say you will\".  \"Say You Will\" was also a Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks album, released in 2003.\r A poodle is known for its curls, making the dog look very poofy.  Since the poodle was originally bred as a water dog, the curls act to waterproof the poodle.  Of course, Stevie Nicks doesn't have puffs of hair around her ankles... \n"}, {"text": "In his earlier years, not so much, but as he got older, this singer began to resemble a basset hound with his long face; his long hair acting as the ears of the dog.  This guy sang with The Stooges, and also made several solo albums, including \"Blah Blah Blah\" and \"Brick By Brick\".  He was no idiot, though.  His lust for life kept him singing.  What singer is this?", "correct": "Iggy Pop", "options": ["Barry Manilow", "Paul McCartney", "Ray Stevens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIggy Pop.\n\n\tIggy Pop was born as Jim Osterberg, Jr. in 1947.  With the Stooges, he had three albums from 1969 to 1973, with another in 2007.  His solo career has produced many albums, including \"Blah Blah Blah\" (1986) and \"Brick By Brick\" (1990).  As a few extra added clues, I said \"he was no idiot\" and \"his lust for life\".  \"The Idiot\" and \"Lust for Life\" were both released in 1977.\r A basset hound is known for its long, droopy looking face with its even longer, droopier ears.  Please know that I am not saying Iggy Pop is droopy; he just has a long face with long hair to match!  At least Iggy isn't short, long and stocky like a basset hound, though. \n"}, {"text": "When this singer has long, straight hair, I believe her to look much like a graceful Afghan hound.  The dog has a very slender face, with long, silky hair on its ears.  This singer, in 1999, earned a record for the longest hit-making career, with number one songs in 1965 and 1999.  Who is this singer?", "correct": "Cher", "options": ["Pat Benatar", "Stevie Nicks", "Barbra Streisand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCher.\n\n\tCher was born as Cherilyn Sarkisian in 1946.  She is known to be paired with Sonny Bono, and had a 1965 hit with him called \"I Got You Babe\".  In 1999, she had a hit with \"Believe\" (also an added clue in the question).\r Afghan hounds have long, slender snouts, and long, silky hair on their ears.  Cher has a long, thin face as well, and with her long, flowing hair, she can look like an Afghan hound at the right angle.  And when she's on all fours.  And when she's barking.  And covered in fur.  But when all of that is put into place; identical! \n"}, {"text": "I pity the fool who gets this question wrong.  Because of his hair, this actor looks a lot like a Chinese crested.  This A-Team actor has hair only on the top of his head, like a mohawk, similar to where the only hair of a Chinese crested dog is.  Who is he?", "correct": "Mr. T", "options": ["Mr. Ed", "Mr. Rogers", "Mr. Mister"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. T\n\n\tMr. T was born as Laurence Tureaud in 1952.  He is known for playing B. A. Baracus on \"The A-Team\" (1983-1986) and Clubber Lang on \"Rocky III\" (1982).  As an additional clue, I said \"I pity the fool\", a well-known catchphrase of Mr. T, as well as a 2006 reality show of his.\r A Chinese crested is a mostly hairless dog, with only tufts of hair on the top of its head, similar to Mr. T's mostly bald head with only a mohawk down the middle.  But the difference is; Mr. T isn't a scrawny little dog. \n"}, {"text": "Oh, it's you again.  Try this question out for size.  A Bichon Frise is a cute little dog with curly white hair.  This actress, known for her role in \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and \"Hot in Cleveland\", also has curly white hair.  Who is this golden girl?", "correct": "Betty White", "options": ["Estelle Getty", "Bea Arthur", "Rue McClanahan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBetty White.\n\n\tBetty White was born in 1922.  She starred in \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" from 1973-1977, and she starred in \"Hot in Cleveland\" in 2010.  As an added clue, I said \"oh, it's you again.\"  Betty White played Grandma Bunny in the 2010 movie \"You Again\".  Also, I called her a \"golden girl\".  From 1985-1992, she starred in the TV show \"Golden Girls\".  The other three actresses were all in \"Golden Girls\" as well.  Getty passed away in 2008, Bea Arthur passed away in 2009 and Rue McClanahan passed in 2010.  This gave Betty White the distinction of being the longest surviving \"Golden Girl\".\r Bichon Frise's have white curly hair, usually, but it can darken to a light tan color.  Betty White's hair is not as white as snow as most Bichon Frise's fur is, but the dog can have color very similar to her hair.  If you didn't know better, you'd think Betty White WAS a Bichon Frise; in the right lighting... And with both eyes closed. \n"}, {"text": "This singer and actress has many similarities to a borzoi.  A borzoi's face is very sleek, long, and slender, and looks much like this singer, who starred in \"Yentl\" and \"Hello, Dolly\", and has albums such as \"ButterFly\" and \"Funny Girl\".  The third album she had was in 1964, and by 2009, she was on album number 33.  Many people love the emotion of this singer.  Who is she?", "correct": "Barbra Streisand", "options": ["Cher", "Pat Benatar", "Stevie Nicks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarbra Streisand.\n\n\tBarbra Streisand was born as Barbara (but later dropped the second \"a\" to be unique) in 1942.  She has starred in many movies and made many albums.  She was in \"Hello, Dolly\" in 1969, and \"Yentl\" in 1983.  She also starred as Roz Focker in \"Meet the Fockers\" (2004) and \"Little Fockers\" (2010).  Her album \"ButterFly\" was released in 1974, and \"Funny Girl\" was released in 1964.  As a few added clues, I mentioned her third album, which was called \"The Third Album\" (1964), and said \"many people love the emotion\".  \"People\" was another album released in 1964, and \"Emotion\" was released in 1984.\r Borzois have long, sleek faces, much like Barbra.  Barbra doesn't run agility courses and sniff out game, however.  She sings and acts instead. \n"}, {"text": "This actor was extremely talented.  Not only did he act, but he was an author of some children's books and even some cookbooks.  He was also a director and producer.  In his later years, he resembled an English bulldog.  This is because of his slightly rotund face, but also because of his mustache and beard, which looked a lot like the folds of a bulldog's mouth.  He also fathered three sons who would also become actors.  Sadly, this hot stuff met his end in 2009, when he died at 75.  Of the DeLuise family, who was the father?", "correct": "Dom DeLuise", "options": ["David DeLuise", "Michael DeLuise", "Peter DeLuise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDom DeLuise.\n\n\tDom DeLuise was born as Dominick in 1933.  He starred in many movies, directed and produced quite a few, and wrote cookbooks and children's books.  The added clue of \"this hot stuff met the end\" hinted at two of his many movies, \"Hot Stuff\" (1979, and he also directed) and \"The End\" (1978).\r Peter DeLuise is known for his acting in \"StarGate\", Michael DeLuise starred in \"Wayne's World\", and David DeLuise is from \"Third Rock From the Sun\" and \"Wizards of Waverly Place\".\r An English bulldog has a characteristic face, where the folds of his mouth look a lot like Dom DeLuise's mustache and beard combo, if you squint really hard, close one eye, tilt your head, cross your eyes, blink as fast as you can, and spin around in circles.  The resemblance at that point is uncanny! \n"}, {"text": "This actor has been in many movies, including \"Ocean's Eleven\", \"Interview With a Vampire\", and \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\".  One day, he was spotted sporting a full mustache and beard, and his graying facial hair made him resemble a Schnauzer, a dog with a mustache-like appearance.  If you want to snatch a few extra points, you need to use your mega mind to figure this one out.  Who is he?", "correct": "Brad Pitt", "options": ["Sylvester Stallone", "George Clooney", "Bill Murray"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrad Pitt.\n\n\tBrad Pitt was born as William Bradley Pitt in 1963.  In 1994, he starred in \"Interview With a Vampire\", in 2001 he was in \"Ocean's Eleven\", and in 2009 he starred as Benjamin Button in \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\".  He has also produced movies such as \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" (2009) and \"Eat. Pray. Love.\" (2010)  As bonus clues for this question, I said you can \"snatch\" a few extra points, and you need to use your \"mega mind\".  Brad Pitt was in \"Snatch\" in 2000 and voiced Metro-man in \"Megamind\" in 2010.\r A schnauzer is known for having a grayish muzzle that looks like it has a mustache and beard.  If you only look at Brad Pitt's chin and mouth, he looks just like a schnauzer.  But when you look at his full face, not so much. \n"}, {"text": "Oh my goodness, a Brittany looks a bit like a red-headed girl with some freckles!  Though this child star might not have had many freckles, she did have red hair.  She starred in \"Heidi\" and \"Curly Top\".  Who could this little princess be?", "correct": "Shirley Temple", "options": ["Drew Barrymore", "Judy Garland", "Jessica Biel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShirley Temple.\n\n\tShirley Temple was born in 1928.  As a child, Temple starred in many movies, including \"Heidi\" (1937) and \"Curly Top\" (1935).  In later years, she became an ambassador for the United States.  As an added clue, I said \"who could this little princess be\"?  \"The Little Princess\" starred Temple in 1939.  Also, I started with \"oh my goodness\", a famous Shirley Temple quote.\r A Brittany is a gun dog that is usually a greyish white color with brown or reddish brown spots.  In the face, it looks like a little redheaded girl with a few freckles.  Shirley Temple wasn't entirely freckle-faced, perhaps more like Lindsay Lohan, but she still is a redhead, and looks like a Brittany if you cross your eyes long enough (and maybe after a few beers). \n"}]}
