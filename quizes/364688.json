{"id": "364688", "name": "Rush - \"Packaged Like A Rebel Or A Hero\" Quiz | Music | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music Q-S", "Rush"], "questions": [{"text": "With which album did the band enter the 1980s, from which the single release 'The Spirit of Radio', became one their greatest commercial successes?\n", "correct": "Permanent Waves", "options": ["A Farewell to Kings", "Moving Pictures", "Roll The Bones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPermanent Waves.\n\n\tThe album 'Permanent Waves' was released on New Year's Day in 1980.  After suffering with something of a burn-out with recording their previous album 'Hemispheres', this work pointed toward a new direction for the band featuring shorter, more accessible radio friendly songs.  As the album's opening song 'Spirit of Radio', at a surprisingly brief three minutes for the single and just under five minutes for the album version, was the band's first major commercial success with a single release. \n"}, {"text": "Well known for his humorous use of stage props, bass player Geddy Lee used which of the following catering appliances as a backdrop for his performances during the band's 2007 'Snakes and Arrows' tour?", "correct": "Rotisseries", "options": ["Vacuum cleaners", "Photocopiers", "Pizza ovens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRotisseries.\n\n\tSince the 1996 'Test for Echo' tour, Geddy Lee has used a technique that amplifies his instruments by sending the signal straight into the mixing desk and out through his P.A. system.  As a result of this, there is no requirement for the banks of amplifiers and cabinets that are usually seen on stage at live performances; this empty space on the stage he has been filling with everyday appliances. Some of these that have featured in these backdrops include vending machines, tumble dryers and refrigerators.  At the performances in which the rotisseries were used, not only did they contain succulent roasting chickens, but at regular intervals a chef would appear on stage and tend to the cooking food! \n"}, {"text": "Neil Peart joined Rush after the departure of John Rutsey and just prior to their first major US tour in 1974.  By what nickname, given to him by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, is he still referred to today?", "correct": "New Guy", "options": ["Starman", "Pootie", "Cowbell Kid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Guy.\n\n\tEven today, after playing together for over forty years, Peart is still referred to by Lee and Lifeson as 'the new guy'.\r With their first major US tour in a supporting role due to start shortly after Rutsey's departure, Lee and Lifeson were left with a major problem.  Peart who, at the time was performing with a local Jazz/Rock fusion band called J.R. Flood, was approached by the band's management to audition.  On first impression both Lee and Lifeson thought that Peart wasn't cool enough to be in their band but, after his audition, Peart was invited to join Rush and the rest, as they say, is history! \n"}, {"text": "The lyrics of this song revolve around two major world cities; it's a track which features on the band's hugely successful 1981 album 'Moving Pictures'.  This song is called 'The ________ Eye'.", "correct": "Camera", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCamera.\n\n\tAt a running time of 10:56, 'The Camera Eye' is by far the longest track on this album which is regarded by many fans to be the pinnacle of their artistic output.  The lyrics to 'The Camera Eye' take snapshots of the cities of New York and London, the former in the first verse and the latter in the second in which the band highlight a number of perceived differences between the two; New York being a city that never sleeps, young and vibrant whilst London is seen as being more historical, calmer, more mature.\r 'Moving Pictures' proved to be something of a watershed for Rush.  In the words of Neil Peart, \"As I define it, that's when we became us;  I think Rush was born with 'Moving Pictures', it represents so much that we had learned up until that time\".  Well known as being the most private member of the band, Peart wrote the lyrics to the song 'Limelight' in reaction to the stresses that the success of 'Moving Pictures' had placed upon the band. \n"}, {"text": "Equipment provided to the band by this sound processing company allowed Rush to reproduce their studio sound in live performance.  What was the name of this company?", "correct": "Saved by Technology", "options": ["Amstrad", "Digitech", "Marshall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaved by Technology.\n\n\tCanadian company, Saved by Technology, were first credited, on the band's 1987 album 'Hold Your Fire'; however owner Jim Burgess did receive credit on their earlier album 'Power Windows'.  Originally founded to provide sound processing equipment and software to the music industry, it rapidly became clear that many artistes required software written specifically for them and Jim Burgess, as a leading software engineer, was well qualified to provide it.  \r Other acts which have also made use of services provided by Saved by Technology include Barenaked Ladies, Def Leppard and AC/DC. \n"}, {"text": "Which name, with an almost identical spelling, links Rush drummer Neil Peart with one of the two leading characters in the hugely successful 1980 musical movie and cult classic, 'The Blues Brothers'? ", "correct": "Ellwood", "options": ["Roger", "Nicholas", "Aloysius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEllwood.\n\n\tNeil Peart's middle name is Ellwood - Elwood Blues was the name of the crazy character played by the late John Belushi in the 1980s hit musical film 'The Blues Brothers'. \n"}, {"text": "The band's original drummer, John Rutsey, left Rush shortly after the release of the eponymous album 'Rush!' in 1974.  What was given as the reason for his departure?", "correct": "Diabetes", "options": ["Personality clash", "Alcoholism", "Fear of flying"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiabetes.\n\n\tThere had been concerns over John Rutsey's health for some time and the band's management were worried about the effect that the rigours and lifestyle of a breaking band on the road would have on the drummer's health.  Surprisingly, Rutsey had also realised this and agreed that for the sake of his health, he should, reluctantly, leave the band.\r Sadly, John Rutsey succumbed to his diabetes on the 11th of May 2008, dying in his sleep from a diabetes-induced heart attack. \n"}, {"text": "Which British rock band, sharing their name with a villainous literary figure, did Rush support in their first concert with Neil Peart as their newest member, on the 14th of August 1974?", "correct": "Uriah Heep", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nUriah Heep.\n\n\tAfter Neil Peart's appointment as John Rutsey's replacement, the band had only two weeks in which to rehearse and for Peart to learn new songs.  The first gig with Peart on the drummer's stool took place at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena where they supported British rockers Uriah Heep and their special guests, Manfred Mann.\r Uriah Heep, who take their name from a character in the novel 'David Copperfield' by Charles Dickens, were founded in London in 1969 and enjoyed considerable success around the world during the 1970s.  By the 1980s however, they had essentially become little more than a cult band but they are still able to draw crowds of loyal fans to their performances today. \n"}, {"text": "One of the band's first gigs took place during September 1968 at a church drop-in centre in Willowdale, Ontario.  Buried in rooms underneath the church, from which of the following did the venue take its somewhat appropriate name; the ____?", "correct": "Coff-in", "options": ["Snug", "Pillbox", "Milky Bar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoff-in.\n\n\tWell?  Was the word 'buried' enough of a clue?  Playing to an audience of around just thirty-five people, the band with a line-up consisting of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and a neighbour John Rutsey, were paid just ten dollars between them for the show.\r I'd perish to think how much they each earn, per show, today! \n"}, {"text": "The band are known to have more than a fleeting interest in space travel, having been invited in the past to observe the launch of the Space Shuttle.  With this in mind, what is the name of the restaurant and bar in Toronto of which Alex Lifeson is part owner: The ____ Room?", "correct": "Orbit", "options": ["Rest", "White", "Panic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrbit.\n\n\tIn addition to his part ownership of The Orbit Room, Lifeson also owns a small consumer products design and engineering company called 'The Omega Concern' a title influenced by his role within Rush; this phrase appears in the sleeve notes of the band's albums 'Hold Your Fire', 'Roll The Bones' and 'Presto'.  \rLifeson is also a qualified and licensed pilot. \n"}, {"text": "Although enormously popular with their fans, during their early career Rush were never given a great deal of credit by the critics and were lambasted by some elements within the North American music press for being what?", "correct": "Terminally unhip", "options": ["Absolutely fabulous", "Bloody marvellous", "Well above average"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerminally unhip.\n\n\tTo be fair, a quick look at the band photograph on the album '2112' gives this statement some credence!  \r Over the years Rush have been described as repetitious, humourless and depressing.  Geddy Lee, by his own admission has stated in an interview for the film 'Beyond the Lighted Stage' that Rush had been pigeon-holed by the music press as being 'terminally unhip'.  This, at the time, was preventing the band from gaining their fair share of publicity in the mainstream music press. Critics were even less complimentary towards Lee himself describing him as singing like 'a hamster in overdrive', 'a rat caught in a wringer' and like 'Mickey Mouse on helium'.  As much as I disagree with the latter description, it certainly makes me smile.\r Critics eh?  They know how to get somewhere, but they can't drive the car! \n"}, {"text": "Seen on the inner sleeve of the band's 1984 offering, where do we find Grace in relation to Pressure?", "correct": "Under&under", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnder&under.\n\n\t'Grace Under Pressure' has proved to be one of the band's least popular albums; mainly due to Lee's insistence on the use of synthesizers and keyboards in many of its tracks; an issue that the band had to contend with up until the release of their 1987 album 'Hold Your Fire' when the band began to return to a more guitar driven style.  \r 'Grace Under Pressure' is an album influenced by the role and effect of technology on society with both Lee and Lifeson drawing from their parent's experiences during WW2 and the Holocaust, as demonstrated by the song 'Red Sector A'. This album features a number of this author's personal favourite songs from this band, these including the tracks 'Kid Gloves' and 'Afterimage'. \n"}, {"text": "\"There is unrest in the forest, \nAnd the creatures all have fled, \nFor the maples scream oppression! \nWhile the ____ just shake their heads\"\n\nWho, or what, were shaking their heads?", "correct": "Oaks", "options": ["Redwoods", "Hazels", "Elms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOaks.\n\n\tWhen asked about the meaning behind his lyrics for 'The Trees', Peart says that they came to him after he had seen a cartoon.  Far be it for me to question his reasons for saying this but, from a personal viewpoint, I believe that this song is about the relationship between Canada and Great Britain; at around the time of this song being written Canada was in the final stages of becoming a fully independent nation, no longer wishing to be overshadowed by Great Britain, its former colonial master. \n"}, {"text": "Which primary colour features in the title of a song on the 1981 album 'Moving Pictures', the subject of which was inspired by a short story published in a motoring magazine?", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Green", "Pink", "Blue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tWith a running time of 6:06, 'Red Barchetta' is the second longest track on the album 'Moving Pictures' and features, to my mind at least, one of the most exciting and most exhilarating guitar solos ever recorded by any band anywhere!  \r The story upon which the song is based, 'A Nice Morning Drive' was published in the November 1973 issue of 'Road and Track' magazine. \n"}, {"text": "If all of your answers are correct, and the quiz title is something of a lyrical clue, once the first letters to the answers to questions one through fourteen have been rearranged, they will spell the title of a track from the band's 1989 album 'Presto' and complete this quiz!", "correct": "Superconductor", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuperconductor.\n\n\tThe band's 1989 studio offering 'Presto' has proved to be another of their least popular recordings which this author thinks is a little unfair.  Both musically and lyrically I believe that it should be up there with the likes of 'Moving Pictures'.  The lyrics to the track 'Superconductor' examine the superficiality of the music and entertainment businesses.  \r It's quite funny to think that a band with such longevity would give transience so much as a passing thought... \n"}]}
