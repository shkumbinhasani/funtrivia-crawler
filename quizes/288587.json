Reggie was known for striking out.  When he retired in 1987, he was still the only batter to strike out 2000 times.  He didn't blow the field away, the pitchers blew him away.  Jackson was known as \"Mr. October\" for his 18 postseason home runs during his career.  He still retired with 563 home runs over 21 seasons, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1993. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1990s, three World Series ended up with a team being skunked four games to none.  The Cincinnati Reds did it to the Oakland Athletics in 1990.  The other two times were by which American League team that provided the skunking?", "correct": "New York Yankees", "options": ["San Diego Padres", "Atlanta Braves", "Los Angeles Dodgers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York Yankees.\n\n\tThe others were all National League teams.  The Yankees first blanked the Padres in 1998, then turned around and did it to the Braves in 1999 also.  In 2000, the Yankees took on the Mets in the series and won four games to one.  With 12 World Series game wins against one loss in three consecutive seasons, the Yankees duplicated this amazing record from 1937-1939 against the Giants, Cubs, and Reds. \n"}, {"text": "The Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers went through an amazing 43 seasons with only two managers from 1954-1996.  One manager was Walter Alston.  Who was the other manager?", "correct": "Tom Lasorda", "options": ["Don Newcombe", "Jim Gilliam", "Duke Snider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Lasorda.\n\n\tThe others never managed in baseball.  Lasorda 'relieved' Alston in 1976 with only four games left in the season, due to Alston being very sick.  Tom took over the team the following season after being a third base coach for many seasons.  Ironically, both Alston and Lasorda didn't work out as players.  Alston played in one game in his career with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1936, and Lasorda tried to be a pitcher for three seasons, but went 0-4 in his career. \n"}, {"text": "Which Hall of Fame player named Johnson was nicknamed, \"Big Train\"?", "correct": "Walter Johnson", "options": ["Earvin Johnson", "Randy Johnson", "Lou Johnson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalter Johnson.\n\n\tWalter played his entire career with the Washington Senators from 1907-1927.  One of the greatest pitchers of all-time, Johnson won two American League MVP awards, and also threw an amazing three Triple Crowns.  Six times in his career, he led the league in wins and 12 times in strikeouts.  He retired with 417 wins, the second pitcher ever to reach that 400-plateau, behind Cy Young.  He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1936 along with four other greats to receive the induction in the hall's first year. \n"}, {"text": "Baltimore Maryland fans found a new Major League team in 1954 in the American League in their city.  What was that team's name before moving to Baltimore?", "correct": "St. Louis Browns", "options": ["Philadelphia Athletics", "Seattle Pilots", "New York Highlanders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Louis Browns\n\n\tThe franchise began with the new American League in 1901 as the Milwaukee Brewers.  In 1902, they moved to St. Louis to become the Browns, although St. Louis already had a National League team in the Cardinals.  The Browns didn't fare nearly as well as their crosstown rivals, as they appeared in only one World Series in 1944 in a loss, and to rub salt into the wound, it would be against those Cardinals, four games to two.  The Brewers/Browns/Orioles franchise won their first World Series ever in Baltimore in 1966. \n"}, {"text": "In the entire 1990s, only four National League teams won 100+ games in a season.  The Giants did it in 1993, the Astros in 1998, and the Diamondbacks in 1999.  The fourth and final team won 100+ games in a season, did it four times in the decade.  Which team was it?", "correct": "Atlanta Braves", "options": ["Boston Red Sox", "San Diego Padres", "Chicago Cubs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtlanta Braves.\n\n\tThe Giants, Astros, Diamondbacks, and Braves, strangely enough, were the only NL teams to reach the 100-win mark in the 1990s.  The Braves did it in 1993, 1997, 1998, and 1999.  The Braves went to five World Series in the 1990s, but came home with only one title in 1995 against the Indians.  In 1995, the Braves won only 90 games in the season.  Even more strange, only three American League teams reached the 100-win mark in the decade.  They were the Athletics, Indians, and Yankees all one time each. \n"}, {"text": "Some members of baseball's Hall of Fame include Whitey Ford, Bill Dickey, Joe DiMaggio, Phil Rizzuto, and Mickey Mantle.  All these players provided their services for the same team in their careers.  Which team was it?        ", "correct": "New York Yankees", "options": ["Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers", "New York/San Francisco Giants", "St. Louis Cardinals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York Yankees.\n\n\tThe Yankees by far had the most players inducted into the coveted hall, and is doubtful that any other team will ever match their numbers.  The first career Yankee to be inducted was the great Lou Gehrig in 1939.  The 1927 Yankees alone had seven future Hall of Famers on the roster. \n"}, {"text": "Since the Major Leagues began in 1901, consisting of the National and American Leagues, only a few franchises kept their same team name throughout the entire 20th century.

The Phillies began 1901 with their trademark Phillies name, but changed it for two seasons in 1943 and 1944 to the Blue Jays, then changed back to the Phillies for 1945.  The Red Sox franchise did not start the Red Sox name until 1908.  The Tigers went to three consecutive World Series from 1907-1909, but lost them all to the Cubs in the first two, then the Pirates. \n"}, {"text": "The Major Leagues began in 1901, and it would be 60 seasons before a new expansion team would be added.
