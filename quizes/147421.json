{"id": "147421", "name": "'Dances With Wolves', Part 3 Trivia Quiz | Dances with Wolves . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Dances with Wolves"], "questions": [{"text": "After some brief encounters with the neighboring Sioux, a small war party comes to pay a visit to Dunbar at Fort Sedgwick.  Unlike the three boys the night previous, this group of men is able to properly steal Dunbar's horse.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMuch like what happened to the young boys, the adult warriors successfully make off with Cisco, only to have the recalcitrant horse exercise its loyalty and return to Dunbar.  During this encounter, Dunbar and Wind In His Hair see each other for the first time.  The confrontation is not a friendly one. \n"}, {"text": "Lt. Dunbar, identifying the futile nature of these confrontations with his Sioux neighbors, decides to pay an official visit to the nearby Indian tribe, for better or for worse.  Before he is able to reach the tribal encampment, however, he discovers a woman, Stands With a Fist, apparently attempting suicide.  Name the actress who portrays Stands With a Fist.", "correct": "Mary McDonnell", "options": ["Annette Bening", "Lorraine Bracco", "Mary Matlin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMary McDonnell.\n\n\tMary McDonnell was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work in this film.  She failed to win the award.  Since her performance in 'Dances with Wolves', McDonnell has acted in such films as 'Grand Canyon', 'Sneakers', 'Blue Chips' and 'Independence Day'.  Though she played the adopted daughter of Kicking Bird in the film, she was actually born in the same year as the actor Graham Greene (both born in 1952!). \n"}, {"text": "In Dunbar's struggle to help the resistant Stands With a Fist, he notices that she is not Indian, but rather Caucasian.  What English word does she surprise him with while attempting to release herself from Dunbar's grip?", "correct": "Don't!", "options": ["Bad!", "Stop!", "No!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon't!.\n\n\tStands With a Fist has slit her wrist in what appears to be a suicide attempt.  She is mourning the recent loss of her husband, a warrior killed in battle with nearby Utes (the scene where she discovers her husband's death is added in the extended version.)  Dunbar is able to get Stands With a Fist to release her knife, and in the struggle she says 'Don't!', much to his surprise. \n"}, {"text": "When Dunbar enters the area occupied by the Sioux tribe, he is first noticed by a woman with two small children.  The startled woman screams out a word repeatedly that indicates a white man has arrived...What is this word?", "correct": "Wasichu", "options": ["Iktomi", "Tawiton", "Shakaru"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWasichu.\n\n\tApparently, the word 'wasichu' breaks down into the Sioux words for 'fat' and 'thief', the rather unflattering name chosen for a people (Caucasians) with whom relations were obviously very troubled. \n"}, {"text": "During Dunbar's visit to the Sioux encampment, he returns Stands with a Fist but receives an unwelcome reception from the tribe.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tConfronted by nearly the entire tribe, Dunbar bravely returns the injured woman he located out on the plain.  The only person to speak with Dunbar is Wind In His Hair, who essentially tells the lieutenant to 'take a hike'.  Kicking Bird wisely stops a group of warriors from going after Dunbar, allowing him to leave in peace. \n"}, {"text": "It is decided during another tribal council that Dunbar will be greeted in an amicable manner.  Does the chief, Ten Bears, accompany the party that ventures to Fort Sedgwick to make this first friendly contact?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tTen Bears selects Kicking Bird and Wind In his Hair to be the tribal representatives in this first diplomatic contact.  It seems that the wizened old chief likes the idea of the opposite extremes that this selection presents. \n"}, {"text": "During this first diplomatic visit, Dunbar is able to learn his first Sioux word, 'tatanka'.  What does this word mean in the Lakota language?", "correct": "Buffalo & Bull", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuffalo & Bull.\n\n\tAfter a brief bout of play acting, during which Wind In His Hair comments that Dunbar's 'mind is gone', he is able to elicit the word 'tatanka' from Kicking Bird.  In turn, Dunbar teaches Kicking Bird that the English word for 'tatanka' is buffalo.  Both men are much pleased with their linguistic accomplishment! \n"}, {"text": "After the first, breakthrough visit the Sioux return to Fort Sedgwick for more interaction.  On this visit, Dunbar dazzles the Indians with his coffee grinder.  Which of these items is not a gift from the lieutenant to the Indians following his coffee making magic?", "correct": "Cream", "options": ["Coffee", "Sugar", "Tin cups"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCream.\n\n\tDunbar provides his visitors with coffee and allows them to try some sugar, which even puts a smile on Wind In His Hair's face.  In his diary entry he announces that he has made gifts of the coffee and most of the sugar.  The tin cups are hanging on the Indians' spears as they ride away. \n"}, {"text": "Kicking Bird desperately wants to make verbal contact with Lt. Dunbar, so he recruits Stands With a Fist to act as interpreter.  Stands With a Fist reacts negatively to Kicking Bird's demands, and runs off crying.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tStands With a Fist is afraid, not of Dunbar himself, but of the possibility that her existence with the tribe will be reported.  Her memories of the White Man's world are vague, and her desire to return to her childhood lifestyle is non-existent. \n"}, {"text": "Stands With a Fist is reminded of her childhood and her birth family after Kicking Bird's request.  What was her given name at birth?", "correct": "Christine", "options": ["Annie", "Tammy", "Emily"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristine.\n\n\tStands With a Fist has vague memories of her childhood with her frontier family.  Her flashback involves a confrontation with some Pawnee warriors and her parents.  The Pawnees apparently kill young Christine's entire family, leaving her to run off to the prairie.  We are left to assume that she is discovered and adopted by the Sioux.  Incidentally, the child who plays Christine is none other than Annie Costner, Kevin's daughter.
