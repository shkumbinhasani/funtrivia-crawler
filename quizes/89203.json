Terribly hung over they share the typical humorous banter until they discover a guy sleeping under a mattress on the floor, Dr. Kline.  Between the mattress and Dr. Kline we find what item, also in his grasp?", "correct": "A guitar", "options": ["An army boot", "A nurse's uniform", "A dictionary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA guitar.\n\n\tDr. Kline's appearance sets up the following exchange.  'Who's that, I don't know him, do I?' asks Hawkeye.  'That's Dr. Kline, eye, ears, nose and guitar,' replies Trapper, and then he adds, 'Is he alive?'  Hawkeye responds, 'Yes, but his guts (implying the guitar) are in terrible shape.'  Well hell, I thought it was funny! \n"}, {"text": "Radar arrives with coffee for the fellows, saving the day once again.  In the exchange with Radar and the doctors we discover that Hawkeye and Trapper woke Radar for some strange reason at 3:30 in the morning while in their drunken stupor.  What for?", "correct": "To 'sacrifice a virgin'", "options": ["To make obscene phone calls to Hollywood", "To have Radar propose to nurse Yamato", "To make him king of the winter carnaval"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo 'sacrifice a virgin'.\n\n\tWhen asked why he wasn't sacrificed, Radar responds, \"I was too sleepy!\"  And just like that, he escapes the Swamp! \n"}, {"text": "Somehow Hawkeye and Trapper make it to post-op where they discover a Sergeant Rizzo, suffering from high fever.  Rizzo doesn't respond to antibiotics so they want to take a blood culture to 'see what kind of germ factory' the kid has going.  Unfortunately, the sample has to be shipped off to Tokyo and will take 72 hours.  Next stop, Henry's office to demand a new incubator.  When they arrive at Henry's office they find him playing with what new item?", "correct": "A barbecue", "options": ["Record player", "Film projector", "Golf clubs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA barbecue.\n\n\tHenry is enthralled with his new barbecue grill, and orders up a couple of steaks with Radar.  When the doctors come storming in, Henry is more concerned with keeping his grill than acquiring a new incubator.  This prompts Trapper to ask Radar about requisitioning an incubator, to which Henry responds, 'Now just hold it!  I'm sick and tired of you guys going over my head down to Radar!'  Radar's response?  'I don't mind sir.'  Classic Henry and Radar! \n"}, {"text": "Blake finally agrees to work on getting a new incubator for the camp and summons a very strange Captain Sloan to camp.  Sloan is a 'by the book' kind of guy, devoid of any sort of a sense of humor.  According to Sloan, the M*A*S*H 4077th is not 'entitled' to an incubator as it has everything it's supposed to have.  But what two items, facetiously mentioned by Hawkeye, does Sloan claim are available to the M*A*S*H?", "correct": "Jukebox and a pizza oven", "options": ["Television and motorcycle", "Dune buggy and blender", "Tandem bicycle and microwave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJukebox and a pizza oven.\n\n\tThe actor Elden Quick (who appears in another episode demanding unlawfully acquired money back from Hawkeye) plays Sloan to perfection.  When Henry asks if Sloan has any 'pizza requisition forms' Sloan answers, 'Oh just use the standard S1798 and write in 'pizza' where it says 'machine gun'.'  Ha! \n"}, {"text": "Radar finally locates three incubators at the 728th Evac. in Pusan.  They are closely guarded by a certain good ol' boy named Arnold Morris who doesn't want to let any of them go.  What rank does Morris hold?", "correct": "Major", "options": ["Colonel", "Lieutenant", "Sergeant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor.\n\n\tMorris holds on to the incubators like they are his lifeblood...a rather strange fetish I would say! \n"}, {"text": "The next step up is to a certain creepy Colonel, commander of the base with the incubators, who seems to be selling Korea piece by piece for his own profit.  What is this Colonel's name?", "correct": "Lambert", "options": ["Colbert", "McKenzie", "Davidson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLambert.\n\n\tLambert lives in luxury on the base, complete with silk robes, Japanese screen doors and a Geisha of his very own.  Lambert offers the doctors an incubator for 1000 dollars, but then reduces the price to 627 'cost', plus 10% for tolerance.  It seems that he likes Hawkeye's lack of morality. \n"}, {"text": "This Colonel claims that he likes Hawkeye but doesn't like Trapper, who has a 'nasty streak of _______.'  What word goes in the blank?", "correct": "Morality", "options": ["Virtue", "Honesty", "Righteousness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorality.\n\n\tMorality?  Trapper?  Ha! \n"}, {"text": "After the Colonel their final stop is to a press conference led by a certain General who is prominently featured in the second season of M*A*S*H.  What is his name?", "correct": "Mitchell", "options": ["Barker", "Clayton", "Hammond"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMitchell.\n\n\tGeneral Maynard R. Mitchell is portrayed by Robert Simon, one of my favorite Generals from the entire series.  Despite being deadly serious and self-righteously honest, he is completely clueless, and the press conference proves it! \n"}, {"text": "The press conference with the General doesn't yield any more positive results than their previous endeavors, but they do get off some fun jokes and quips.  One line that you don't hear, but that is reiterated by an exasperated Henry following the return of the doctors, goes something like this:  \"Did you really yell _________________?\"  (fill in the blank)  ", "correct": "Give me an incubator or give me death!", "options": ["I came, I saw, I incubated!", "Every American has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of an incubator!", "Damn the incubators men, full speed ahead!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGive me an incubator or give me death!.\n\n\tHenry also asks, 'Did you really call a one-star General a nincompack?'  Man oh man...wish we had more than 3 years worth of Henry Blake! \n"}, {"text": "Yes or no:  Does the M*A*S*H 4077th finally get an incubator?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tRadar finally acquires an incubator, trading in Henry's beloved barbeque grill.  Why didn't the doctors just ask Radar in the first place...after all, he is the master of conniving.  Maybe this was his very first connivance and they didn't know.  Or maybe, just maybe, the writers wanted to have the doctors go though some hilarious escapades before getting their incubator.  I'll take the latter...thanks for playing this quiz! \n"}]}
