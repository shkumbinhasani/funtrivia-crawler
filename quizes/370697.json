{"id": "370697", "name": "\"Doctor Who\" - Series 1 Quiz / Test | Doctor Who - Series 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "The Series (2005-)", "Doctor Who - Series 1"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Rose\" - The Doctor meets Rose Tyler.  This, of course, is which incarnation of The Doctor?", "correct": "Ninth", "options": ["Eleventh", "Tenth", "Twelfth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNinth.\n\n\tAlthough this is never explicitly stated in the episode, this incarnation was preceded by eight other versions of The Doctor.  This time, he meets Rose Tyler when he saves her from the Autons (also not named in the episode), controlled by the Nestene Consciousness underneath the streets below the London Eye.  Of course, intrigued by the possible adventures through space and time, Rose decides to leave her life behind and hops into the TARDIS.  The Autons, in this episode, took the form of plastic mannequins which came to life upon awakening.  Certainly a bit unnerving and uncanny. \n"}, {"text": "\"The End of the World\" - The Doctor brings Rose five billion years into the future to see the destruction of the Earth.  The party held on a nearby space platform is crashed when who of the following plots to kill everyone onboard?", "correct": "Lady Cassandra", "options": ["Jabe", "The Face of Boe", "Moxx of Balhoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLady Cassandra.\n\n\tOpting to bring Rose somewhere completely different from 2005 London, he jets her five billion years into the future where the National Trust is no longer funding the Earth's upkeep, letting it die naturally during the expansion of the sun.  An elite party is held on a floating platform to witness the destruction of the planet but the worst happens-- one of the people onboard, the skin-thin Lady Cassandra, plans to murder the others and teleport away, making money in their opposing company's stocks. Fortunately, The Doctor foils her plans and brings her back to the ship by reversing the teleportation. She ends up drying out and exploding before their eyes. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Unquiet Dead\" - The Doctor and Rose go back in time to 1869, inevitably meeting with what literary great?", "correct": "Charles Dickens & Dickens", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles Dickens & Dickens.\n\n\tHaving headed far into the future, The Doctor decides to bring Rose back into the past, specifically Naples on Christmas Eve in 1860.  He undershoots and they end up in Cardiff in 1869 where Charles Dickens has somehow made an appearance at the same time as what appears to be ghosts.  The Doctor investigates and discovers that the ghosts are actually an alien race, The Gelth, seeking new bodies to rebuild their kind. When they use a local girl with psychic powers, Gwyneth, as a conduit, they inadvertently let loose an evil force and she's forced to blow them up, killing herself but saving the others. Dickens, of course, goes on and continues to be a literary figure as Rose and The Doctor depart in the TARDIS. \n"}, {"text": "\"Aliens of London\"/\"World War Three\" - In this two-part story, The Doctor and Rose return to London and battle the Slitheen, a race which invades and takes over which location during their stay?", "correct": "10 Downing Street", "options": ["Buckingham Palace", "The London Eye", "Big Ben"], "explanation": "\n\n\n10 Downing Street.\n\n\tThe Doctor and Rose return to London one year after their original departure to find that Rose has been declared missing by her mother.  Of course, this goes a bit by the wayside when a UFO crash-lands, flying through Big Ben and landing in the Thames.  As it turns out later on, the crash was orchestrated by the Slitheen in an attempt to invade 10 Downing Street, get access codes to nuclear weapons, kill off mankind, and sell the world's resources to the highest bidders. The Doctor manages to determine that they can be killed with vinegar before allowing a missile to crash into the Downing Street Residence. The Slitheen are defeated while the heroes survive in a safe shelter.  Of course, they can't stay for long; Rose wishes her mother and boyfriend goodbye before they fly off again. \n"}, {"text": "\"Dalek\" - In Utah in 2012, The Doctor discovers a museum of odd, alien artifacts.  Who accidentally regenerates a Dalek, unleashing it on the people in the facility?", "correct": "Rose Tyler", "options": ["Adam Mitchell", "The Doctor", "Mickey Smith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRose Tyler.\n\n\tThe Doctor, upon arriving in this facility (run by a collector of alien artifacts, Henry van Statten), is taken captive and forced to come face to face with one of his mortal enemies, a Dalek, the last of its kind.  While The Doctor is taken off to be examined (and tortured), Rose is let in to the Dalek and she unknowingly touches it, regenerating its powers and allowing it to escape its chains, going on a rampage through the museum. Fortunately, Rose also imbued the alien soldier with the power to feel, causing it to destroy itself before it could escape the compound.  Upon leaving, The Doctor allowed techie Adam Mitchell to join them in the TARDIS.  After all, he was kind of out of a job... \n"}, {"text": "\"The Long Game\" - On Satellite 5, it is rumoured that Floor 500 is covered in gold.  Is it actually?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe Doctor, Rose, and their new companion Adam head into the year 200,000 to visit a satellite orbiting Earth.  The Satellite, Satellite 5, holds many of the planet's journalists as they use their futuristic brain powers to report the news from all outlets.  While much of their visit takes place on Floor 139, there's a lot of talk of being promoted to Floor 500, the upper-most floor, as it's rumoured to be lavish enough to have gold walls. In reality, Floor 500 is freezing cold and contains the Mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe, a creature controlling Earth from orbit.  Fortunately the day is saved, but not before Adam gets in trouble, forcing the Doctor to bring him home, to his own time, and ban him from the TARDIS. \n"}, {"text": "\"Father's Day\" - Visiting London in 1987, Rose causes an issue in time by doing which of the following?", "correct": "Saving her father from death", "options": ["Preventing her own birth", "Warning the Prime Minister of crisis", "Breaking the TARDIS"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaving her father from death.\n\n\tRose, having never met her father, asks the Doctor to bring her back to the day of his death so that she can be with him and ensure that he doesn't die alone.  Sure enough, when they reach November 7, 1987, they're there to witness his death; he's hit by a hit-and-run driver.  She is unable, however, to stay around and she asks the Doctor to try it again. Unfortunately, this runs the risk of a paradox and, when she decides to act, it's too early and she ends up saving her dad instead of just being by him.  What results is horrific; Time Reapers arrive to claim all the people they can and take advantage of the time issues. The Doctor and Rose are able to gather a wedding party (including her mother and father) into the oldest building around and think of a plan.  Unfortunately, the Doctor is taken by one of the Reapers.  In the end, Rose's father ends up being the hero she always knew he could be by righting the errors of history and getting hit by the car he was meant to.  Rose is able to stay by her father's side before they return tot he TARDIS. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Empty Child\"/\"The Doctor Dances\" - The Doctor and Rose pursue a Chula ship all the way to Earth, but the object crash lands during what historical era?", "correct": "World War II", "options": ["The Victorian Era", "Ancient Roman times", "Medieval Times"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld War II.\n\n\tIn this two-part story, the Doctor and Rose end up following a Chula ship to Earth but, due to a miscalculation, end up following it to World War II London.  As it turns out, the space wreckage, a medical ship, is only there because Jack Harkness, a con man, has tried to get them to pay top dollar for the cylinder. Rose becomes slightly enamoured with the man, but as it turns out, he accidentally ended up unleashing alien nanogenes on the city, transforming the nearest human, a deceased child, into a template for other humans.  The group needed to stop the alien 'cure' from spreading and, luckily, they had the person to do just that. In the end of the story, Rose and the Doctor brought Harkness with them in the TARDIS, sparing him from almost certain death, and taking him on their next adventure. \n"}, {"text": "\"Boom Town\" - In this episode, Rose, the Doctor, and Captain Jack Harkness make a stop in what UK city and end up encountering an escaped Slitheen?", "correct": "Cardiff", "options": ["Oxford", "London", "Glasgow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCardiff.\n\n\tStopping to refuel the TARDIS in the Cardiff Rift, the trio ends up accidentally stumbling upon news of the new mayor in Cardiff-- Margaret Blaine, who actually escaped the explosion at 10 Downing Street during an earlier visit to the present day.  They are easily able to capture her and the Doctor plans to return her to her homeworld to face execution, but she gains the upper hand when a stolen device wreaks havoc when attached to the TARDIS' controls, complicating the rift's energy. Margaret holds Rose hostage, but ends up being subdued by a light from inside the TARDIS' controls-- something the Doctor refers to as the Heart of the TARDIS, which can grant wishes. Ultimately, Margaret wishes to have a second chance and she transforms into an egg.  The Doctor, Rose, and Jack decide to return it to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius. \n"}, {"text": "\"Bad Wolf\"/\"The Parting of Ways\" - Rose needs to lock into the power of the TARDIS to save the Doctor.  Unfortunately, the subsequent removal of power forces the Doctor to do which of the following?", "correct": "Regenerate", "options": ["Destroy the TARDIS", "Leave Rose behind", "Destroy the Earth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRegenerate.\n\n\tOn their way from Raxacoricofallapatorius, the Doctor, Rose, and Jack are taken off the TARDIS by a powerful transmat in the year 200,100-- one hundred years after their adventure on Satellite Five.  A force has placed them into futuristic game shows to fight for their lives.  The Doctor is able to break free of his \"Big Brother\" game while Jack leaves his \"What Not to Wear\" knock-off. When they reach Rose in her \"Weakest Link\" game (against an evil Ann-Droid) she sacrifices herself, taking a disintegrator beam to protect the others.  When the Doctor realizes they're back on Satellite Five, he and the others head to Floor 500 to determine the truth (and find his TARDIS).  Luckily, Rose is still alive, albeit transmatted to the Dalek mothership; they've spent years amassing a new army and controlling the Earth through their televisions. The Doctor fools Rose into taking the TARDIS back to her time while the others prepare for all-out war.  In the end, only the Doctor remains, but Rose, having discovered that she has placed the 'Bad Wolf' messages throughout time to save the Doctor, takes in the Heart of the TARDIS, wipes out the Daleks, gives Jack new life, and helps the Doctor out of the battle.  To save Rose, the Doctor has to extract the TARDIS from her and, in doing so, he destroys all of his body's cells.  When Rose awakens on the TARDIS, it's the last time she sees the Doctor in his ninth form; he transforms into an tenth form shortly after and, after returning her home in time for Christmas, needs the time to recover from the regeneration process. \n"}]}
