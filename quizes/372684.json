Unfortunately, they've been seen; Dandy sneaks up behind them and knocks them both out.\rIn Brandenburg, Germany, also in 1932, Elsa, at that point a top-selling underground 'performer', was cuffed to a bed and made an unwilling performer in a snuff film.  It was the first time she'd been asked to perform alone.  Little did she know, they'd planned to make her a star in a different way.  Revving up a chainsaw, they hastily cut off both of her legs and left her to die.  She was only saved when one of her former clients had stalked her and called the police.

Able to free himself from his ropes, Jimmy jumps on stage and knocks Dandy out, allowing everyone else to escape, but not before he's choked out and brought back to the bus.  Just before he can be killed, a green mist rolls in and Mordrake interrupts Twisty from carrying out the deed. \n"}, {"text": "What's under Twisty the Clown's mask?", "correct": "A gaping disfiguration", "options": ["A birthmark", "A normal face", "A sealed mouth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA gaping disfiguration.\n\n\tDandy, incensed that his show can't be finished, chases the others down but Maggie sends the kids off to the road and to escape.

He's asked to tell his story.\rIt was 1943 and Twisty was a special carnival clown who loved children.  The freaks, however, hated him.  The freaks made him believe that the police were after him for taking advantage of the children and because of this he ran away.  Word traveled around the carny circuit and he wasn't able to find work so he traveled back home to Jupiter. \n"}, {"text": "Mordrake takes who of the following into his troupe?", "correct": "Twisty the Clown", "options": ["Ma Petite", "Elsa", "Ethel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwisty the Clown.\n\n\tTwisty, feeling as though he wouldn't be able to escape the police, even at home, found no other resort.  Returning to his bus, he decided to stick a shotgun into his mouth and end it all but it didn't kill him.  Instead it simply disfigured him.  Shortly after his accident he tried to find work at the local freak show but didn't find acceptance with the others. Recently he tried to save his 'captives'-- he needed to prove to the children that he was better than the freaks, so he made shows for them, got them a babysitter, and proved better than their parents.

When the detectives compliment Jimmy on his humility, Jimmy instead decides to turn things around and speak out for Meep.  They make it back to the freak show grounds a short time later. \n"}, {"text": "Richard Spencer, as he calls himself, allegedly hails from which city?", "correct": "Hollywood", "options": ["Orlando", "Portland", "Paris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHollywood.\n\n\tJimmy returns to the freak show to inform Elsa that the curfew has been lifted.  The killer was found and stopped by none other than Jimmy.  When Maggie gives him a kiss, Elsa comments that perhaps she's enchanted him.  Both Elsa and Jimmy note that Mordrake made appearances before them in some way and it becomes apparent that he claimed the victim he sought out, leaving Elsa and her coterie behind.\rCars pull up at the freak show soon after Jimmy's return to express their gratitude.  With Jimmy a hero, and on rare occasion, there seems to be acceptance.  Elsa takes the opportunity to invite the community to a grand performance in the big top that evening.\rAs the big top tent is put back in order, Elsa informs Bette and Dot that they're warming up for the pinheads.  A man named Richard Spencer makes his appearance to pick up some tickets, but Elsa doesn't know he's actually Maggie's partner in crime, Stanley.  Dropping the name Hollywood, California, he's given a seat.\rReturning to his estate, Dandy, wearing Twisty's mask, walks into the dining room to find Dora cleaning the table.  Finally, he's able to commit to what he's always wanted to do; he slices her throat with the scissors from Twisty's bus and laughs gleefully to himself. \n"}]}
