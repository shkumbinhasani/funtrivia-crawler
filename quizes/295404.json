As in all good stories, they live happily ever after and even produce two children, Metharme and Paphos.\rOf the alternatives, Daedalus was the father of Icarus (he who flew too close to the Sun), and was also a gifted sculptor -- he used quicksilver to allow his statues to speak. Hephaestus was the sculptor who created the first woman, Pandora, from clay at the behest of Zeus.

If you want to attend, though, you'll need to book years in advance. And don't forget to take your autograph book along too -- it is one of Germany's society events of the year. \n"}, {"text": "Who wrote the novella on which the 1994 film 'The Shawshank Redemption' was based?", "correct": "Stephen King", "options": ["Thomas Harris", "Tom Clancy", "Robert Ludlum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStephen King.\n\n\tStephen Edwin King was born in 1947 in Portland, Maine.

The film's two main protagonists are Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, and Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman, who also narrates the film). The screenplay was written by the film's Director, Frank Darabont, who also filled both roles on another King adaptation, 'The Green Mile'.
