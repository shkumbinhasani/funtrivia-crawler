{"id": "366310", "name": "\"The Seven Wonders\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Coven"], "questions": [{"text": "What 'white witch' makes a reappearance in the opening of the episode to wish the girls of Miss Robicheaux good luck?", "correct": "Stevie Nicks & Nicks & Stevie", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStevie Nicks & Nicks & Stevie.\n\n\tShortly before the remaining students of the coven are expected to perform the Seven Wonders to determine who is the Supreme, Stevie Nicks arrives to sing the song \"Seven Wonders\".  All the while, the girls partake in a few final moments: Misty twirls in the greenhouse while bringing plants to life, Zoe speaks an incantation to raise her bed off the floor, Madison takes a candlelit bath, sparking the candles herself, and Queenie tries to speak to Nan in the afterlife.  As the four descend the stairs they don shawls (a la Stevie) and she wishes them luck before heading out the front door. \n"}, {"text": "What does Myrtle serve to the girls on the eve of their trials?", "correct": "Caviar", "options": ["Lamb", "Bread", "Mulligatawny"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaviar.\n\n\tMyrtle likens the girls' last supper to the Da Vinci piece of the same name and, oddly, seats herself in Jesus' position at the table (which is coincidental, as she rose from the ashes).  Serving the girls caviar and champagne, she says that one of the girls will assume the supremacy by that time the next day. For some it could be their actual last meal.  For the first time in their history as a coven, they will give all four the chance to achieve supremacy.  Cordelia gives a small speech and tells them that their childhood at the coven is over; the Seven Wonders begins the following morning. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the Seven Wonders do the witches begin their trials with?", "correct": "Telekinesis", "options": ["Vitalum Vitalis", "Pyrokinesis", "Transmutation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelekinesis.\n\n\tLining the girls up in the main parlor, Myrtle informs them that since they are breaking the tradition by allowing them all to participate, they will start with the wonder of her choice (instead of working from easiest to hardest).  As such, they begin with Telekinesis and, in their case, they are required to use their minds to move candlesticks across a tabletop to blow out the flame.  Misty shocks herself by performing the feat while the trick is Madison's bailiwick.  She, Queenie, and Zoe all complete the challenge with ease.\r What follows is Concilium, during which the girls are forced to control each others' minds.  Queenie and Misty face off against each other while Zoe and Madison do the same, bringing Kyle into the mix to get at each other's nerves.  All four succeed in this Wonder though Cordelia has to put a stop to their fighting. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these best describes Madison's personal Hell?", "correct": "Being cast in a Broadway production of \"The Sound of Music\" as Liesl", "options": ["Being forced to clean up litter on the side of a highway", "Being forced to watch as Kyle and Zoe kiss each other", "Working bit parts at a local theater without getting noticed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeing cast in a Broadway production of \"The Sound of Music\" as Liesl.\n\n\tThe third Wonder the girls are asked to perform is Descensum, which entails a trip into Hell for all four of them.  The requirement is that each girl must break free of their personal Hells to return to the material plane, but if they do not do so before sunrise, they will be trapped there forever.  Queenie is the first to return to her body having been to her Hell before to find Papa Legba; her Hell is working at the chicken restaurant in Detroit. Madison is second to return; she claims she was cast in Broadway's \"The Sound of Music\" as Liesl.  Zoe returns third and says that her Hell involved herself and Kyle breaking up over and over. Unfortunately, Misty does not return.  In her personal Hell, she's in a school science class, forced to dissect a frog.  The teacher forces her to kill the frog, which she brought back to life with her powers, over and over again.  Unable to cope with this due to the goodness in her heart, she finds herself trapped in Hell as sun rises.  Cordelia weeps over the body as it crumbles to ash in her arms. \n"}, {"text": "Who demonstrates that she has the power of Vitalum Vitalis during the Seven Wonders?", "correct": "Madison", "options": ["Zoe", "Queenie", "Myrtle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadison.\n\n\tThe girls, not dissuaded from the task at hand, continue to work at their Wonders with four still remaining.  Their next one is Transmutation, the ability to teleport at will.  The girls make this into a game, teleporting their way around the academy grounds playing tag.  Cordelia urges them to play safe while they have their fun but Zoe, unable to control her power, teleports herself to the top of the academy's iron gate, impaling herself to the shock of the others. Kyle removes her and carries her to the greenhouse, prompting the girls to complete the Vitalum Vitalis Wonder by bringing her back to life. Queenie finds that she is unable to perform this one, indicating that she is not the Supreme.  Madison decides not to perform the Wonder on Zoe, instead killing a fly and bringing it back to life (and despite the fact that Misty and Zoe brought her back to life).  They realize that Madison will likely be the Supreme while she asserts that maybe Fiona had the right idea about leaving the coven behind. \n"}, {"text": "Who convinces Cordelia to participate in the Seven Wonders ritual?", "correct": "Myrtle", "options": ["Kyle", "Queenie", "Fiona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMyrtle.\n\n\tCordelia worries that she has failed the coven as she has not raised a worthy Supreme; if Madison passes the last two tests, she says, they deserve to die out.  Myrtle mourns Misty and Zoe while Kyle returns to his loved one's body.  Cordelia says that Fiona was always right in that Madison was the Supreme but Myrtle stops her, claiming that she, Cordelia, is the one who has been suppressing her powers for so long and that she could be the next Supreme. She is convinced to perform the Seven Wonders, and Madison is convinced to continue as well.  Doing so, she demonstrates five of the seven without fuss, even returning from Hell, just in time, where she was ridiculed by her mother repeatedly. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the Seven Wonders can Madison not perform?", "correct": "Divination", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDivination.\n\n\tThe girls reach one of the latest challenges of the Seven Wonders-- Divination-- and Cordelia is asked to find an item belonging to a previous Supreme hidden somewhere in the house, specifically an item belonging to Mimi DeLongpre, using pebbles to guide her.  Being gifted in the second sight, she does this with relative ease, finding the witch's belonging, an antique brooch, elsewhere in the house. Madison is asked to find the item belonging to Anna-Leigh Leighton and finds herself frustrated when she can't (even, ironically, taking a cigarette from what may be the very item found on the sidetable).  Myrtle announces that she is not the Supreme; Madison has failed. As a result she says that she's leaving, bound to reveal the coven's true nature to TMZ in Hollywood. \n"}, {"text": "Who murders Madison before she can leave?", "correct": "Kyle", "options": ["Fiona", "Spalding", "Cordelia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKyle.\n\n\tMadison, saddened by her obvious failure to rise to supremacy, heads up to her room to pack all of her belongings.  At this moment, Kyle arrives angry that Madison let Zoe die as they both knew what awaited her (or didn't) on the other side.  To make her pay for her actions, he strangles her to death.  After she draws her last breath, the ghost of Spalding appears to Kyle and says that they'll have to dispose of the body, virtually passing the torch to the coven's new keeper.\r In the greenhouse, Cordelia performs the final of the Seven Wonders, Vitalum Vitalis, to resurrect Zoe.  When this is done, Cordelia falls to the ground and rises in full, vibrant health, unblinded, as the new Supreme of the coven. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is Myrtle Snow's last word?", "correct": "Balenciaga", "options": ["Gucci", "Furstenberg", "Prada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalenciaga.\n\n\tIn the month after her rise as Supreme, Cordelia outs the coven to the world, revealing that witches are, indeed, in everyone's midst.  News outlets arrive for interviews as she lays the truth on the line.  In the report, Cordelia urges any girls who believe they may be witches to call, email, or come to the coven. Soon, they receive tons of applications.  That day, Myrtle tells Cordelia that she will be the ones making the big decision, and entering a new era she is able to give Zoe and Queenie elevated roles as the new council.  At the same time however, she must clear the rot of the past by burning her. Myrtle grievously harmed another witch and for that she must be burned at the stake again.  She refuses to take no for an answer.  The next day they march out to the pits where Myrtle, dressed in red, is tied to the pyre, wishes Cordelia the best as her proper motherly figure, and screams her last word: BALENCIAGA!  She is then set ablaze. \n"}, {"text": "Fiona, in Hell, is forced to spend eternity with whom?", "correct": "The Axeman", "options": ["Absolutely no one", "Delphine and Marie", "Joan Ramsey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Axeman.\n\n\tAs girls line up at the gates outside, Cordelia gives the new roles to Queenie and Zoe before heading downstairs for one final loose end...her mother.  She heads to the parlor to find Fiona, withered and diseased, sitting in a seat by the window.  Cordelia saw her die in The Axeman's mind, but Fiona planted that memory there, dooming him and biding her time to find out who the Supreme would be.  Now that Fiona sees that her own daughter is the Supreme however, and she is too weak to follow through on her plan, she is doomed to die while Cordelia saps her vitality.  Fiona urges her daughter to kill her and admits that the girl took her power the moment she gave birth to her, spurning her to think of Cordelia as a constant reminder of her own death.  When Fiona finally gives her daughter a hug, perhaps the first they ever had, she lets go and dies.\r Fiona awakens in a wood cabin as The Axeman comes in the front door, having gone fishing-- his own idea of paradise-- though she's horribly worried.  She pours herself a shot of gin as she complains about the rustic charm, fish smell, and knotty pine of the decor.  He hits her, but urges her to dance.  Fiona watches on as Papa Legba laughs from the other room, as she's stuck there for eternity, waking up in her own personal Hell, ironically The Axeman's paradise, every single day.\r Miss Robicheaux's Academy opens its doors to the masses and new, young witches gather inside as Cordelia gets ready to address them from the stairs.  When she asks if they have any questions, one asks what a Supreme is.  Queenie tells them that they're looking at her, standing before them, as Cordelia smiles on. \n"}]}
