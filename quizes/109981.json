Who was this interesting fellow?  \n", "correct": "John Dalton", "options": ["Alphonse Daudet", "William Dampier", "Stuart Davis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Dalton.\n\n\tActive during the early nineteenth century, John Dalton is one of the most influential chemists of the modern era.  The concept of 'atoms' was first suggested in ancient times (by the scientists Leucippus, to be exact) it was Dalton whose experimentation with the comparative weights of different substances who first theorized atomic theory with the support of experimental research. His work influenced dozens of scientists from future generations, including Mendeleev who developed his periodic table later in the century.  Also, if you're curious, yes...this is the same Dalton who identified the condition we call Daltonism (aka color blindness).  He suffered from this problem himself! \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes great people come into the world in twos.
