In order to do this, two sets of two flags are used, placed into different distinct positions to denote certain letters and numbers to form messages.  The method is one of many which can be used to achieve the same purpose.  Heliography, for example, is a method of using light to produce morse code messages across a distance without being connected via cables. \n"}, {"text": "What kind of flag signals the winner of a NASCAR race?", "correct": "Checkered flag", "options": ["Green flag", "Striped flag", "Red flag"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheckered flag.\n\n\tThe Checkered Flag is synonymous with completion of a race, regardless of type.  In this case, the flag is an alternation of black and white squares in a checkerboard pattern.  In the case of NASCAR, the Green Flag is primarily used to denote the start of a race or the fact that a pit is open.  Adversely, Red Flags are used to denote a stop or a closing.  Striped Flags, for example a Red and Yellow Striped Flag, is used to denote debris on the track and is mainly used in case of warning.  The White Flag, in auto racing, is used to denote the final lap. \n"}, {"text": "The American flag has always only had thirteen stripes.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tKnown patriotically as 'The Stars and Stripes', the American Flag's stars represent the number of states in the country while the horizontal stripes of red and white are used to denote the original thirteen colonies in the union.  The first American flag debuted in 1777 with only thirteen stars in a circular pattern.  When Vermont and Kentucky were added to the American Union in 1795, the amount of stripes increased temporarily (for a length of twenty-four years) until it was set back to thirteen in 1818.  The flag is also known as 'Old Glory'. \n"}, {"text": "Which flag does not consist of three striped colours?", "correct": "Greece", "options": ["The Netherlands", "France", "Italy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreece.\n\n\tWhat's a flag quiz without a 'which country' question?\rWhile Denmark's 'Dannebrog' is regarded as the world's oldest national flag, The Netherlands' Red-White-Blue horizontally-striped flag is the oldest to feature three striped colours.  France's, on the other hand, is Blue-White-Red, though it's striped vertically.  Similarly, Italy's national flag is vertically-striped, though it's Green-White-Red in nature.\rGreece's flag is the odd one out.  Similarly to the American flag, it contains a box in the top left corner containing a blue and white cross.  Its stripes (nine in total) alternated between blue and white as well.  The stripes are meant to symbolize sky and sea. \n"}, {"text": "Which country's Flag Day does not fall in June?", "correct": "Canada", "options": ["United States", "Sweden", "Peru"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanada.\n\n\tCanada's Flag Day is February 15th, commemorating the day on which the national flag of two red stripes and a maple leaf was inducted as the national flag in 1965 replacing the Red Ensign (which still featured the Union Jack).

While \"Thank You\" was about her relationship with her boyfriend, \"White Flag\", a song about her symbolic surrendering, chronicled their break-up.  \"White Flag\" reached #1 on four different Billboard charts and became one of Dido's most popular singles to date.  Aside from this, her song \"Don't Leave Home\" from the same album became popular.\rWhite flags, in a technical sense, typically denote truces or surrendering.

Typically used as a warning, the flag is flown at the top of the mast of a pirate ship.  The skull and crossbones, notorious as a symbolic representation of death, was used to prove the status of a pirate and somehow force other ships into early surrender.\rAlthough piracy has been on the downslope for about three centuries, the skull and crossbones/Jolly Roger are also found on some American military aircraft. \n"}, {"text": "Joe Rosenthal photographed the raising of a flag in which location?", "correct": "Iwo Jima", "options": ["Hiroshima", "Passchendaele", "Vimy Ridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIwo Jima.\n\n\t\"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\", photographed in 1945, chronicles the historic event of the American flag being raised by Marines during the Battle of Iwo Jima on February 23.  The photo, taken by Joe Rosenthal, won the Pulitzer Prize for Photography in the same year.  While the Clint Eastwood film \"Letters of Iwo Jima\" (2006) showed the Japanese side of the battle, his other film, from the American standpoint, ended up following the story of those who raised this particular flag and the photographer. This film was \"Flags of our Fathers\".  \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" was later nominated for 'Best Picture' and 'Best Director' at the 2007 Academy Awards though it only took home the award for 'Sound Editing'. \n"}, {"text": "A rainbow flag is often used to denote which social group/belief?", "correct": "Gay and Lesbianism", "options": ["Anarchism", "Paganism", "Communism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGay and Lesbianism.\n\n\tThe LGBT Movement (representing Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, and Transgenders) use the rainbow flag to symbolize diversity between people.  Although the original flag contained eight colours, pink and turquoise were removed from the roster to be made more cost-effectively and to be easily usable.  Each of the six colours on the rainbow flag represent a certain trait (life, healing, sunlight, nature, harmony, and spirit) when viewed in the proper order, from red to purple like a regular rainbow.  The original rainbow flag attributed to this movement was made in 1974. \n"}, {"text": "Which amusement park company contained sites known as 'Magic Mountain', 'Hurricane Harbor', and 'Great Adventure'?", "correct": "Six Flags & 6 Flags", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix Flags & 6 Flags.\n\n\tSix Flags Amusement Parks, which featured many different amusement parks across the entire continental United States, was acquired by Premier Parks in 1998 and while the name was still retained for the majority of their parks, some switched over.
