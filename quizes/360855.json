{"id": "360855", "name": "The Republic of Burundi Quiz | Africa | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Africa", "Burundi"], "questions": [{"text": "Burundi has land borders with three other countries. Which of these is NOT one of those three?", "correct": "Kenya", "options": ["Rwanda", "Tanzania", "Democratic Republic of Congo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKenya.\n\n\tLocated in the Great Lakes region of East Africa, Burundi has land borders with Tanzania to the east and south, Rwanda to the north, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west. Burundi's longest land border, stretching 609 miles, is with the DRC. The border with Rwanda is 182 miles long, and with Tanzania 282 miles. \n"}, {"text": "Although Burundi is technically a landlocked country, it does have a considerable coastline on which body of water?", "correct": "Lake Tanganyika", "options": ["Lake Malawi ", "Lake Victoria", "Mozambique Channel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLake Tanganyika.\n\n\tExtending 420 miles from its northern to its southern end, Lake Tanganyika is the world's longest freshwater lake. It is also the second largest by volume and the second deepest, (in both cases only following Siberia's Lake Baikal). The lake has coastlines in four countries, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Zambia. \r Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake by area, is further north, between Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Lake Malawi is the southernmost of the African Great Lakes, bordering Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. The Mozambique Channel is actually part of the Indian Ocean, separating Mozambique from the island nation of Madagascar. \n"}, {"text": "The Ruvyironza River, which rises in southern Burundi, is the southernmost source of which river?", "correct": "Nile", "options": ["Limpopo", "Congo", "Niger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNile.\n\n\tThe Nile is sometimes deemed to start at Lake Victoria, but the lake is also fed by some sizeable rivers. The Kagera River is the longest of these and the Ruvyironza River, which has its source in Bururi Province in southern Burundi, is the longest tributary of the Kagera. The Ruvyironza joins the Nyabarongo as it comes from Rwanda at the Rusumo Falls and together they form the Kagera, which feeds Lake Victoria. If you consider the true source of the Nile as southern Burundi, this would give the world's longest river a total length of 4199 miles. \n"}, {"text": "What are the two principal colors on the Burundi flag?", "correct": "Red and Green", "options": ["Red and Blue", "Blue and Yellow", "Green and Yellow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed and Green.\n\n\tThe Burundi flag which was adopted in 1967 was the fifth design since independence in 1961, although the basic design of the last four have all been similar. They all feature a white saltire dividing the field into alternating areas of red and green, with the centre of the saltire forming a circular disc. It is the design in the centre of the disk that changed with the different designs. The flag adopted in 1967 has three six-pointed red stars outlined in green on the central white disc. Two of the previous designs had different flowers in the centre and the third had an empty white disc. \n"}, {"text": "What is Burundi's largest city and major port?", "correct": "Bujumbura", "options": ["Niamey", "Douala", "Luanda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBujumbura.\n\n\tLocated on the northeastern shore of Lake Tanganyika in the northwest of the country, Bujumbura is Burundi's largest city, most important port. It is home to around 800,000 people, which is about 9% of all Burundians.\r The alternatives are all the largest city in an African country: Douala is the largest city in Cameroon, although the national capital is Yaound\u00e9; Luanda is both the capital and the largest city in Angola; and Niamey also fulfills both roles in Niger. \n"}, {"text": "Small by African standards, Burundi has an area of 10,700 square miles which is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Hawaii. Which European country is of comparable size?", "correct": "Albania", "options": ["Croatia", "Slovenia", "Montenegro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlbania.\n\n\tWith an area of 11,000 square miles, Albania is a little smaller than Lesotho and slightly larger than three similar-sized African countries, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea and Rwanda.\r Of the alternatives: Slovenia is significantly smaller, with an area of 7,800 square miles; Montenegro is smaller still and with an area of 5,300 square miles would just fit twice into Burundi. Croatia, on the other hand, has an area of 21,800, so would just about hold Burundi twice. \n"}, {"text": "What is the major religion in Burundi?", "correct": "Christianity", "options": ["Islam", "Indigenous", "Buddhism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristianity.\n\n\tAround three in every four Burundians consider themselves Christians. Of those, 80% are Roman Catholics with Protestants and Anglicans making up the remainder. Most of the remaining 25% of the population follow traditional indigenous religious beliefs. There is a small Muslim population of around 5% of the population, most of whom live in the cities and are mainly Sunni. There is no significant Buddhist population in Burundi. \n"}, {"text": "If you are given impeke when visiting Burundi, what should you do with it?", "correct": "Drink it", "options": ["Play it", "Wear it", "Sit on it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrink it.\n\n\tI guess you could try doing any of the four options, but since impeke is a traditional beer, drinking it would be most advisable. Impeke is usually served in a large container that is passed around a group of people, with each person taking a turn to drink in order to symbolize unity. \n"}, {"text": "In 2009, the Burundi government changed the law on homosexuality. What did they do?", "correct": "Made same-sex acts a criminal offense", "options": ["Made homosexuality a capital offense", "Reduced the age of consent for same-sex couples", "Legalized same-sex marriages"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMade same-sex acts a criminal offense.\n\n\tThe Burundi government chose to go in the opposite direction to that being taken in recent years by many governments around the world. They did not go as far as making homosexuality a capital offense, but the 2009 Act did make acts between same-sex partners a criminal offense punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine of 100,000 Burundi Francs (about \u00a340 or US$65). \n"}, {"text": "Virtually all wildlife in Burundi is threatened. Which of these is NOT a cause of this sad state of affairs?", "correct": "Influx of Tourists", "options": ["Non-existent Government Conservation Programs", "Deforestation", "Poaching"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInflux of Tourists.\n\n\tThe deforestation of Burundi is now almost complete thanks to the clearing of land for agriculture and the cutting of trees for fuel. Civil wars over the past three decades have meant that government conservation programs have collapsed and are virtually non-existent. Lack of government control has also led to a significant increase in poaching. \r All wildlife in Burundi is seriously threatened and many major species such as elephants and gorillas are already extinct in the country. \n"}]}
