Note, however, I will not ask about any questions with fruits actually in the title, like \"Strawberry Wine.\"  All will be a pun!\n\nThis berry punny song was performed by Patti Page in 1952.

The real song is a song by Blake Shelton, and was his third number one song of all time.  Of course, once you've changed a word to a fruit related to the nectarine, what berry punny song do you get?", "correct": "Some Peach", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSome Peach.\n\n\t\"Some Beach\" was a song performed by Blake Shelton in 2004.  His third number one song, \"Some Beach\" lasted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs at number one for four weeks!  The song was Blake's second single on his album entitled \"Blake Shelton's Barn and Grill.\"\r The peach is related to the nectarine and the almond.  It technically is not a fruit.  The peach, along with the nectarine and almond, is a drupe.  The peach is most noted for its fuzzy skin and yellow and red skin.  The reason only part of the fruit is red is because it changes red when exposed to the sunlight.  The parts that do not get any sunlight remain yellow. \n"}, {"text": "This song was sung by Stevie Wonder in 1969.

It reached number one in 1982 on the Billboard Top 100, and was second only to \"Eye of the Tiger\" by Survivor on the Hot 100.  Note that \"Abracadabra\" is one word, not two.\r Apricots look like nectarines, but are related to plums.  The apricot, unlike a nectarine, is actually a fruit, not a drupe.  It does have a drupe-like pit, however, similar to that of a plum.\r Abracadabra is also the most common term used by a magician.

It was included on the 1964 album \"Beatles for Sale.\"  More specifically, it was recorded on October 6th, 1964.  Did that help?  Now, when you change the last word of the song, you get the national vegetable of Wales.  Aah, maybe that will help.  What is this berry punny song called?", "correct": "Eight Days a Leek & 8 Days a Leek", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight Days a Leek & 8 Days a Leek.\n\n\t\"Eight Days a Week\" was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney of the Beatles.  The song was recorded in, you guessed it, Abbey Road.  The song lasts 2:43.\r Leeks are types of onions similar to scallions, which are also called green onions.  Leeks are much larger and fatter than the scallion, however.  Leeks are used in several different ways.  My favorite way to prepare them is to fry them, just like onions.  They are very similar to onion rings but much softer and they pack less of a punch.  Plus, they don't make your eyes water near as much as the vidalia onion, scallions, or shallots. \n"}, {"text": "This song was written in 1968 by Mars Bonfire.  It was performed by Steppenwolf, a Canadian band.  Of course, I won't stop there.  I am going to \"vegetable-ify\" the question.  If you add maize to it, you get a berry punny song.  What is this song now called?", "correct": "Corn to Be Wild", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorn to Be Wild.\n\n\t\"Born to Be Wild\" was said to have been the first heavy metal song ever written.  Of course, modern heavy metal is much louder and more obnoxious than it was then.  The vinyl record by Steppenwolf had two sides, A and B.  The A-side was called \"Born to Be Wild,\" and the B-side was called \"Everybody's Next One.\"\r Corn, or maize, is technically not a vegetable.  It is a food grain, so falls in the category of breads, rices, and pastas.  Therefore, although corn, especially sweet corn, is treated as a vegetable, it is a starch, and too much of it will have the same effect as too much bread and pasta!  The only difference is...  You can't get whole grain corn. \n"}]}
