{"id": "158595", "name": "\"Twelve Angry Men\" (1957) Quiz | Twelve Angry Men | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Twelve Angry Men"], "questions": [{"text": "Which one of the following is true about the apartment where the murder was committed? ", "correct": "It is situated very close to the elevated railway system.", "options": ["It is situated next to the city centre bus depot.", "It is situated very close to a big airport.", "It is situated very close to the Brooklyn Bridge."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is situated very close to the elevated railway system.\n\n\tThe noise that was created by a carriage passing the apartment window becomes an important feature in the details of the jury's discussion. The juror played by Edward Binns remarks that he has recently painted an apartment close to the elevated railway tracks, and most of the jurors agree that you can hardly hear yourself think when the carriages pass. \n"}, {"text": "What physical disability did the old man who lived in the apartment underneath the murder rooms suffer from?", "correct": "He had a bad leg and dragged his foot as he walked.", "options": ["He stuttered and did not make a clear witness in court.", "He was partially sighted in his left eye.", "He was partially deaf."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe had a bad leg and dragged his foot as he walked.\n\n\tThe old man claimed to have got to the door of his apartment in time to see the accused boy running away down the flight of stairs. Juror number 8 calls this into question and simulates walking around the jury room with a limp, whilst Juror number 2 times his journey with his watch. \n"}, {"text": "What sort of knife was used to kill the murdered man?", "correct": "A switch-blade knife.", "options": ["A stainless steel kitchen knife.", "A small penknife.", "A hunting knife."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA switch-blade knife.\n\n\tThe prosecuting attorney had made much of the fact that the knife used for the murder was one of a kind. Juror Number 8, Henry Fonda, had gone to the same district and bought a similar looking knife from a pawnshop. It was cheap and easily available. At one point Lee J.Cobb's character mistakenly picks it up and says that this is what he did it with. His mistake proves the point that the murder weapon was not so distinctively unique. \n"}, {"text": "In what way had the knife been stabbed into the body?", "correct": "It had been stabbed downwards and into the chest.", "options": ["It had been jabbed upwards into the man's stomach.", "It had been slashed across the dead man's throat.", "It had been rammed into the centre of the man's back."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt had been stabbed downwards and into the chest.\n\n\tThe downward wound was unusual, for the accused was a good deal shorter than the man he was supposed to have stabbed. Another juror, played by Jack Klugman, points out that people who fight with switch-blade knives never hold them overhanded and stab downwards when they are fighting. The point of the switchblade is that you can change it rapidly from hand to hand to get an advantage. If the accused had committed the murder you would expect him to have stabbed upwards into the lower chest and stomach. \n"}, {"text": "How did the accused account for the fact that his knife was missing?", "correct": "He said he had probably lost it through a hole in his pocket.", "options": ["He said that he had given it to one of his friends.", "He said that his father (the murder victim) had confiscated it earlier in the day.", "He said that he dropped it down into the sewers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe said he had probably lost it through a hole in his pocket.\n\n\tThe accused's statement is very weak. He had actually shown a knife very like the murder weapon to some of his friends earlier in the day. Henry Fonda, Juror Number 8, had earlier demonstrated that there were likely to be many knives like it in the neighbourhood. However, this \"hole in the pocket\" story still counts against the accused throughout the discussion. It is the balance of the other evidence that creates the reasonable doubt. \n"}, {"text": "What motive did some of the jury consider that the accused had for the murder of his father?", "correct": "He had been hit too many times and finally snapped.", "options": ["He wanted to steal some of his father's money.", "He was high on drugs and didn't know what he was doing.", "He wanted to gain revenge for the treatment of his mother."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe had been hit too many times and finally snapped.\n\n\tAgain this point about the accused's motive remains in the balance. Some jurors argue that the boy was used to violence and therefore would not respond to being hit one more time. Others suggest that everyone has a breaking point. Two or three jurors point out that the prosecuting attorney did not spend very much time trying to build evidence about the accused's motive. \n"}, {"text": "What is the accused's alibi for the crucial time when the murder took place?", "correct": "He says he was at a late night double bill at the cinema.", "options": ["He says he was dancing in a large dance hall.", "He says he was at a late running basketball game.", "He says he was down at the waterfront watching the ships come in."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe says he was at a late night double bill at the cinema.\n\n\tMuch is made of the fact that the accused couldn't remember the names of the movies nor the people who starred in them, when he was first questioned by the police. Juror number 8 points out that the questions were put to him in the apartment with his father's body lying dead in the next room. He would be in shock and probably unable to remember any details. He demonstrates this idea by cross questioning the juror played by E.G. Marshall about movies he had seen quite recently. The juror falters over names and identities even though not under any emotional pressure. \n"}, {"text": "What does the old man in the apartment underneath the murder apartment claim to have heard at the time of the murder?", "correct": "The accused say, \"I'm going to kill you\", and the body hitting the floor.", "options": ["The sounds of breaking glass, and then a shout of \"No !\"", "The sound of a scream from the dying man.", "The accused say, \"This is for my mother\", and the body hitting the floor."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe accused say, \"I'm going to kill you\", and the body hitting the floor.\n\n\tHenry Fonda tries to demonstrate that, if all the witnesses are telling the truth, it would be impossible for the old man to have heard anything but the sound of the passing elevated railway. The female eye-witness claims to have seen the murder through the last carriage as it passed the window of the apartment. It had already been roaring past for several seconds thus obliterating all other sound. \n"}, {"text": "What was the female eye-witness doing when she witnessed the murder in the apartment across the street?", "correct": "She was lying in bed trying to get to sleep.", "options": ["She was just closing the blinds before going to bed.", "She was lying in bed reading a book.", "She was washing dishes at the kitchen sink."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe was lying in bed trying to get to sleep.\n\n\tIt is a key feature of the argument that the female eye-witness was actually \"tossing and turning\" in her efforts to get to sleep. Under those circumstances it is highly unlikely that she would be wearing eye-glasses. If proved to need them her evidence would thus become unreliable. \n"}, {"text": "How is the evidence of the female eye-witness called into question during the discussion in the jury room?", "correct": "The old man on the jury noticed marks on the side of her nose.", "options": ["Henry Fonda points out that she had contradicted herself on the witness stand.", "They realise she already had a grudge against the accused.", "The racist on the jury declared that you can't trust people from that background."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe old man on the jury noticed marks on the side of her nose.\n\n\tThe old man on the jury, played by Joseph Sweeney, comments that the marks on the side of her nose could only have been caused by eye-glasses. She was a vain woman who did not wear them in court. She would also not have worn them if she was tossing and turning trying to get to sleep. For the juror played by E.G. Marshall this allows him to declare that he has a reasonable doubt, and to change his vote to \"Not Guilty\". It is perfectly possible that the woman got the marks from wearing sunglasses, or that she was long-sighted.However, the woman's eyesight has been called into question, and this shifts the balance of possibilities in the accused's favour.\n"}]}
