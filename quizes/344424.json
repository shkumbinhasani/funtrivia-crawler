{"id": "344424", "name": "\"Extraordinary Merry Christmas\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Who tells Rachel that Finn is having trouble buying her a gift?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Blaine", "Puck", "Tina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tIn the choir room, Mercedes decorates a Christmas tree while singing Mariah Carey's \"All I Want For Christmas\".  Of course, she's joined by the rest of New Directions, filled with Christmas cheer.  During the song, Mercedes pays a bit of attention to Sam and ends the number by holding mistletoe over Rachel and Finn.  After a kiss, Rachel dubs this year the best Christmas ever.\rAfter rehearsal, Rachel stops by Finn's locker to give him her Christmas wish list since he's been having trouble.  In the locker room, Finn tries to get gift ideas from the other guys (including socks and a wok).  Kurt overhears and immediately tells Rachel.  Rachel says that he just needs to get her five of the fifteen things on her list. \n"}, {"text": "Who was supposed to visit Rory over the holidays?", "correct": "His mother", "options": ["His siblings", "His father", "Santa Claus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis mother.\n\n\tSue invites Artie, Kurt, and Blaine into her office because Christmas is upon them.  Since Christmas is a time for forgiveness, she forgives the fact that they have no talent and that they're ruining the 'Great American Songbook' one mash-up at a time.  She also says that she's volunteering at the Lima Homeless Shelter (which, as Kurt says, is odd for her.  In her campaign she said she didn't believe in homelessness). Sue says that this is the first Christmas without her sister and that she'd appreciate it if the Glee Club joined her to sing and spread Christmas cheer.  The trio agrees.\rIn the choir room, Rory tells the kids that his mother was planning on flying to Ohio for the holidays, but she had to cancel due to plane costs.  He decides to sing Elvis Presley's \"Blue Christmas\" to cheer himself up.  Santana says that it's a depressing number.  Everyone agrees that this year is their year to have a good holiday. \n"}, {"text": "Who appeared to Artie in a dream?", "correct": "Chewbacca", "options": ["Jaws", "E.T.", "Indiana Jones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChewbacca.\n\n\tWill confirms that this year they will have a great Christmas.  In fact, he just got off the phone with the local PBS affiliate.  The yule log burning footage cost too much this year, so they want to have the New Directions perform in a Christmas special.  Will also nominated Artie as the program director because of his stellar job working on \"West Side Story\".  He decides he needs to think about the offer.\rSam talks to Rory about being far away from his family for Christmas and, because he's far away from his own family, he invites him over for the week to celebrate the holidays.\rThe owner of the PBS station speaks to Artie about the Christmas special and Artie makes his demands-- the first is Chewbacca, who came to him in a dream; the second is that it be shot in black and white.  The owner says he doesn't care as long as it costs less that $800. \n"}, {"text": "What is Rory's role in Artie's Christmas special?", "correct": "Itchy, the Christmas Elf", "options": ["Irish Santa", "Frosty the Snowman", "Rudolph"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItchy, the Christmas Elf.\n\n\tIn the auditorium, Rachel sings Joni Mitchell's \"River\" solo for the New Directions in the hope that Artie will include it in his Christmas special.  He decides not to because he thinks it's too depressing, and Christmas is a merry, jovial holiday.  His special will star Blaine and Kurt as they host an exciting spectacle of a party at their chic Swiss chalet instead. At the end, Rory will play Itchy, the Christmas Elf, and he'll recite a rebooted version of 'Frosty the Snowman' where Frosty doesn't melt.  Rachel and Sam both think that Artie's production is too happy and that part of Christmas is recognizing the sad and knowing that much better things are on the way. Sam decides to visit the Salvation Army and not involve himself. \n"}, {"text": "What does Finn buy Rachel for Christmas?", "correct": "An African sow-pig", "options": ["A songbook", "A mirror", "A membership to the Jelly of the Month Club"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn African sow-pig.\n\n\tRachel thinks that Artie wouldn't be in the giving spirit if he didn't give her talents to the non-cable viewers of Western Ohio; she's confident it'll work out.  She also makes a less-than-veiled suggestion that Finn give one of her presents early.  He gives her a card, much to her disappointment, and he says that her list was out of his price range.  He did, however, find a commercial for this African pigs you can pay $2 to fatten up every month so that it can feed a hungry family.  Finn says that it's a season of giving.  Rachel says she gave the list so that he wouldn't embarrass himself.\rIn the choir room, Blaine and Rachel sing an original, upbeat Christmas song, \"Extraordinary Merry Christmas\".  Artie is thrilled by this new number until Sue comes in asking about their numbers for the homeless shelter.  It turns out both events are on the same night.  Artie makes the decision to perform for PBS. \n"}, {"text": "During the Christmas special, Mercedes and Rachel arrive bearing gifts.  Which of these is not one of them?", "correct": "Rachel's famous Hanukkah cookies", "options": ["An Elizabeth Taylor diamond necklace and pendant (knockoff)", "A Christmas tree bowtie", "Candy cane-striped capri pants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel's famous Hanukkah cookies.\n\n\tThe PBS special begins its run with a number by Blaine and Kurt-- both sing and dance to the classic carol \"Let It Snow\".  When the song ends, Kurt and Blaine break the fourth wall with their hosting, speaking to the Western Ohio audience and inviting them into their magnificent black and white chalet.  The doorbell rings and Mercedes and Rachel join the party. Mercedes presents Kurt with a gift, an Elizabeth Taylor diamond necklace and pendant he recently lost in an online auction.  Rachel gives Blaine a Christmas tree bowtie and candy cane-striped capri pants-- surprisingly he already owns neither. \n"}, {"text": "Which two New Directions members are dressed as fictional characters during the Christmas special?", "correct": "Finn and Puck", "options": ["Quinn and Rachel", "Mike and Tina", "Brittany and Santana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn and Puck.\n\n\tFilled with excitement and Christmas spirit, the party of four heads to the piano where they sing \"My Favourite Things\" from \"The Sound of Music\" and pass each other gifts to place under the tree.  The song is followed by applause and Kurt's announcement that Christmas dinner hasn't been made.  What with all of the presents and singing, he forgot to start the oven.  Blaine announces a word from their sponsors.\rWhen their program returns from the break, everyone is joking and hanging stockings at the fireplace.  Blaine notes how the snow is really coming down outside and Kurt says a message about climate change.  Mercedes jokingly talks about 'the end times'.  At the sound of Jingle Bells, Finn and Puck arrive dressed as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo.  Any resemblance to these \"Star Wars\" characters, they claim, is purely coincidental. \n"}, {"text": "Does Rory read \"Frosty the Snowman\" during the Christmas special?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe group worries that Santa won't make it to their Swiss chalet in the poor weather but Puck and Finn hop onto a nearby guitar and drum kit to reassure them that all is well with a rendition of \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\" (with Blaine on impromptu harmonica).\rThe doorbell rings and it's Mike, Tina, and the Cheerios dressed in Santa dresses.  Brittany takes the lead on a version of The Waitresses' \"Christmas Wrapping\" while spinning ribbons in the air.  Kurt comments on how everything has turned out so well at their party and they introduce Rory as Itchy, the Christmas Elf.\rRory says that he was originally asked to read \"Frosty the Snowman\", but he's decided on a more fitting story that comes from the heart.  He reads from the Gospel according to Luke, the story from the first Christmas. \n"}, {"text": "Who joins Sam working at the homeless shelter (rather than joining in Artie's TV special)?", "correct": "Quinn", "options": ["Mercedes", "Tina", "Rory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn.\n\n\tAt the homeless shelter, Quinn and Sam work together to hand out food and celebrate the holidays.  Sam talks to Quinn about her recent changes of attitude and she says that she's trying.  He says she deserves good things.  Quinn worries that they don't have enough food, but all turns out well-- the rest of the Glee Club arrives with a turkey and their Christmas spirit.  They say that Rory's Christmas story showed them what really matters.  He claims that it was thanks to the inspiration of Sam, his Christmas sponsor, that he did it.  At the same time, the last ten minutes of their special were cut off; the PBS station resigned a deal with the yule log producers.\rJoining together, New Directions sings \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" by Band-Aid with those less fortunate. \n"}, {"text": "What did Rachel buy Finn for Christmas?", "correct": "An iPod", "options": ["A jacket", "A signed picture of herself", "A football"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn iPod.\n\n\tAt school, Rachel finds Finn to tell him that she's named her African sow-pig Barbra, after Streisand.  The important thing is that she's realized she was being selfish.  She loves him and the pig and that's all that matters.  He got her something else though-- a star.  He named it 'Finn Hudson', he explains, because that way if she feels lonely she can know he's always looking down on her...at night.  Besides, there's already a bright enough star named Rachel Berry on Earth.  He also shows her that he bought the earrings.  She says that it's too much; she says it's time to start giving back.\rSam and Rory ring bells for the Salvation Army and Rory asks if he'll be his Valentine's Day sponsor as well-- that way he can find a girl by February.  Sam agrees on the condition that he help with his Sean Connery impression.  Finn and Rachel stop by to donate some money.  They returned the earrings and an iPod that Rachel bought for Finn so that they could give back this year.  When they join in on the bells, Sam says it's the best Christmas ever. \n"}]}
