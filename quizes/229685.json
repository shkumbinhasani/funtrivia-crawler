{"id": "229685", "name": "Name the Card Game Multiple Choice Quiz | Card Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "  Card Games", "Card Games Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "The ultimate goal of this card game is to avoid taking tricks that contain either the queen of spades or any hearts, unless, of course, you are planning to 'shoot the moon'.  What is the name of this charming game?", "correct": "Hearts", "options": ["Spades", "Moonshot", "Dirty Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHearts.\n\n\tIf you love to play hearts, you are not alone, it is the favorite card game of President Bill Clinton.  The object of the game of Hearts is pretty basic, avoid taking any tricks that contain hearts, which are worth one point each, and to strenuously avoid taking a trick containing the queen of spades, which is worth 13 lousy points.  In Hearts, points are bad.\r 'Shooting the moon' involves taking *all* the hearts *and* the queen of spades.  If you are skillful enough to do so, it is worth your while.  A successful shooting of the moon takes 26 points off your score, or alternatively adds 26 points to everyone else's scores. \n"}, {"text": "What is the specific object of the entertaining and easy-to-learn card game most commonly referred to as Oh Hell?", "correct": "Take the number of tricks bid", "options": ["Avoid the face cards", "Accumulate all the cards", "Take exactly 50 points"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTake the number of tricks bid.\n\n\tIn Oh Hell, also known as Oh Jerusalem, Screw Your Neighbor and Mormon Bridge, each player is dealt the maximum number of cards (for example 12 with four players and a regular 52-card deck).  Players then proceed to estimate how many tricks they will take with their hand, and each player must take that exact number of tricks to maximize their score.  Each subsequent hand sees one less card dealt per player, until each is dealt only one card.  The game can then be reversed, with each player dealt an additional card per hand back up to the maximum.  Dealing can proceed in an opposite fashion as well, with one card dealt to each player at first, up to the maximum number of cards.\r Lots of fun! \n"}, {"text": "In which card game is each player dealt five cards from a deck that only includes the aces, face cards, tens and nines, with the object being that the bidder (or 'maker') must win at least three tricks?", "correct": "Euchre", "options": ["Baccarat", "Pinochle", "Canasta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEuchre.\n\n\tIn the 19th century, Euchre was hugely popular in the United States, essentially being considered the national card game.  Since that time, Bridge has eclipsed Euchre in popularity, but it still remains a widely played game, especially in the Midwest and Northeast (and in Ontario, Canada). \n"}, {"text": "The object of the children's game 'Crazy Eights' is to win all the cards in the deck.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tQuite the opposite, actually.  Using a standard 52-card deck, each player is dealt seven or eight cards.  The top card from the discard pile is then laid face up.  The player who goes first must then lay a card down that either matches the suit or number of the card face up.  Play proceeds this way until one person sheds all his/her cards.  The eights are considered wild cards that can be laid down at any time, with the card-layer announcing the suit of their choice.  If on a player's turn they are unable to match the face up card, they must draw until they are able to do so. \n"}, {"text": "'Upcard', 'knock' and 'deadwood' are all terms commonly heard in which very popular card game?", "correct": "Gin Rummy", "options": ["Red Dog", "Spades", "Go Fish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGin Rummy.\n\n\tIn Gin Rummy, the 'upcard' is simply the top card in the discard pile.  To 'knock' is to end the round, announcing the runs and sets in one's hand.  The 'deadwood' in each player's hand are the cards that are not matched in sets or runs.  The points for each deadwood card are added to the score of the knocking player *if* that player has gone gin. \n"}, {"text": "The standard version of this game features a 48-card deck, with two each of the face cards, aces, tens and nines.  Players bid for the right to call trump based on how much meld they have in their hands.  Which card game fits this description?", "correct": "Pinochle", "options": ["Bridge", "Wizard", "Whist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPinochle.\n\n\tThe term 'pinochle' refers to the combination of a queen of spades and a jack of diamonds, a point-scoring combination during the meld round.  Other examples of meld include a round of aces in each suit, marriages of kings and queens in the same suit and a run of every card in a single suit.  After presenting meld, play proceeds in tricks, with the trump suit having been declared by the winning bidder. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not a type of Solitaire (single player) card game?", "correct": "Primero", "options": ["FreeCell", "Klondike", "Canfield"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrimero.\n\n\tSolitaire is referred to as 'Patience' in British English.  There are literally dozens of different forms of Solitaire, including both Klondike and FreeCell that frequently come with Microsoft Windows.  Primero was a gambling game from the 16th century that has essentially become extinct. \n"}, {"text": "In this simple game, each player takes turns laying down the divided up cards from a 52-card deck face-up.  When a jack is laid down, the first person to cover the pile with their hand acquires the pile.  If a person gathers up the whole pile for themself, they win.  What is this potentially finger-damaging game called?", "correct": "Slapjack", "options": ["Jack's Up", "Jack Be Nimble", "Jacksprat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlapjack.\n\n\tSlapjack is a very simple variation of the game Egyptian War (or Egyptian Rat Race).  To make the game more interesting, other signals may be used to signify the laying down of different face cards.  For example, when a queen is laid down, the first person to clap their hands wins the discard pile. \n"}, {"text": "In this 'pegging' card game, the highest possible score for a single hand is an almost unattainable 29, with a more realistic 28 being the second best score to be had.  Which game, typically played by two players, is referred to here?", "correct": "Cribbage", "options": ["Haihowak", "Blitz", "Sueca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCribbage.\n\n\tWhile a rare 29 is possibly attainable, several lesser point scores are not possible, including a 19, 25, 26 or 27.  In jest, when players make a zero score for a hand, they may claim a score of '19'.\rThe peg reference in the question refers to the small peg pieces used on a cribbage board to calculate the score for each player.  Usually, play is to 121. \n"}, {"text": "Blackjack is not the only game where the object is to score a '21'.  Which of these other card games are typically played to a '21' score?", "correct": "Cassino", "options": ["500", "Donkey", "Durak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCassino.\n\n\tThe winner in a game of Cassino is the first person to reach the score of 21.  Cards are taken in tricks, with value placed the following: high number of cards, higher number of spades, aces, big cassino (namely, the 10 of diamonds) and little cassino (aka the two of spades).  This game is great fun, especially for two players, I highly recommend it.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
