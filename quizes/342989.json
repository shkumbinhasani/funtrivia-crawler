{"id": "342989", "name": "The World Through Jade's Lens Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games A-C", "Beyond Good and Evil"], "questions": [{"text": "Typically, Jade gets more units based on the difficulty of the picture being taken.  Therefore, when she takes pictures in the lighthouse with me, she doesn't get much.  Which of these will give her the least amount of units?", "correct": "Canis Canis", "options": ["Homo Sapien", "Sus Sapien", "Lutra Electra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanis Canis.\n\n\tOh, I'm terribly sorry for using the scientific terms in the answers; but you see, that is how I categorize them for Jade.\r The Canis canis is simply a dog; and more specifically, the pet Jade has at home in her lighthouse.  Since Woof (her dog) hardly ever moves, he is very easy to get a photo of.  He gives Jade only 100 units. \n"}, {"text": "Of course, some creatures I find even more difficult to take pictures of.  Sometimes it's all in how you get your angle.  For instance, Jade sometimes has trouble taking a picture of Lutra electra.  Why is that?", "correct": "He is on top of the lighthouse", "options": ["He only comes out at night", "He only appears once; as the final boss", "He stays in his hole most of the time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is on top of the lighthouse.\n\n\tThe Lutra electra is the otter that walks around on top of the lighthouse.  For just starting the game, this is a particularly difficult animal to capture with me (the camera).  To capture him in a photo, Jade has to walk to the very edge of the lighthouse's top story and angle me upwards towards the small platform that the otter can be found.  Then, patience and precision timing is needed.  When Jade finally gets me in the perfect position, she has to wait for the otter to appear, and she only has a few seconds to snap the picture before he disappears on the other side of the platform once again.\r However, this difficult task is rewarded in the end, for the science center will give Jade 1,000 units for her work taking the photo with me. \n"}, {"text": "For a big payday, Jade can take pictures of boss creatures with me, too!  It scares me, though, as that giant DomZ worm is barreling towards me as I take a snapshot.  What is the DomZ worm boss called, which you fight outside of Mammago Garage?", "correct": "Teratosaurus Imperator", "options": ["Helix Rupestris", "Rascax Caeruleus", "Cyanea Urtica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeratosaurus Imperator.\n\n\tThe Teratosaurus Imperator is a very scary animal to have to take a picture of, believe me.  Since he moves very quickly above the surface of the water, and he is attacking you, it takes a good angle as well as speed to take a picture of him.  It is even more difficult when you fight Teratosaurus Imperator later on when he is more difficult, so I recommend that you take a picture of him the first time you see him!  Since he is a boss creature, and enemies tend to give more units (since they're attacking as you photograph them), this guy gives a nice 2,000 units. \n"}, {"text": "As Jade was exploring through the world, I couldn't help but notice the abundance of whales for me to take pictures of.  Okay, so there were 3 of them; but one of them was a space whale!  My zoom lens tingles just at the thought of taking pictures of such majestic creatures.  But, tell me, which of the whales gives the most units?", "correct": "Megaptera Purpurea (the purple one)", "options": ["Megaptera Borealis (the red one)", "Megaptera Anaerobia (the space one)", "They all reward the same amount of credits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMegaptera Purpurea (the purple one).\n\n\tDon't worry, I would have thought Jade would have gotten more out of a space whale encased in ice, too.  Alas, it only gives 800 units, whereas the red whale gives 2,000 units!  However, the purple whale must be the most difficult of the three to take photos of, because it rewarded Jade and I with 2,200 units. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite creatures to take a picture of is Pey'J, Jade's uncle.  What kind of creature is he, though?", "correct": "Sus Sapien", "options": ["Rhinocerous Sapien", "Homo Sapien", "Capra Sapien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSus Sapien.\n\n\tOddly enough, Jade's uncle is a pig man, or a Sus sapien!  Pey'j is very easy to take a picture of, provided you do it before he is taken by the slaughterhouse.  Taking a picture of Pey'j will give Jade 600 units. \n"}, {"text": "One of the very first, and most deadly, DomZ creatures that Jade faces in her journey I also find difficult to capture in a photo.  The best photo taken is when it is about to knock her down and you can see it opening its deadly mouth.  What creature is this?", "correct": "Crochax Velox", "options": ["Astacus Erectus", "Dipneustes Trilineatus", "Lycoperdon Fugiferus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrochax Velox.\n\n\tThe Crochax velox, which is more commonly referred to as just the crochax, is an enemy that can be very deadly.  Don't worry if you don't get a chance to take a picture of him when you first see one; they're common enemies and are found in nearly every level!  They are difficult to take a picture of, however, because just as you are close enough to snap the photo, they are flying towards you to pin you to the ground.\r Though they're common, they're also difficult to capture, thus giving you 1,000 units should you take a picture of it! \n"}, {"text": "The Akuda bar is full of all sorts of animals you can take photos of.  One of them is apparently a friend of Jade's from the past, and he plays a Disk game with her for pearls.  What kind of Akuda bar creature can you photograph before playing the Disk game with him?", "correct": "Carcharodon Sapien", "options": ["Aquilus Sapien", "Taurus Sapien", "Walrus Sapien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarcharodon Sapien.\n\n\tThe Carcharodon sapien is the shark man in the Akuda bar.  There are a few of them around, so you don't HAVE to take a picture of the guy you play the Disk game with.  The Taurus sapien is the bull bartender in the bar.  The Aquilus sapien is the bird man who sells newspapers, and the Walrus sapien is Ming-Tzu in Ming-Tzu's shop.  The shark man will give you 400 units. \n"}, {"text": "One of the first few bosses was fought in the Vorax's Lair.  It at first seemed harmless, but as Jade got closer to take a picture of it, I got frightened!  What creature became a massive boss instead of the little worm it first appeared to be?", "correct": "Pterolimax Gigantea", "options": ["Rattus Giganteus", "Vorax Nocturnus", "Polypody Amoeba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPterolimax Gigantea.\n\n\tThe Pterolimax gigantea seemed harmless when you first took a picture of it.  It was only a little worm with a giant globe as a head.  However, as you walked over a platform to approach the worm-like creature, it burst out of the ground as a giant creature and the original \"head\" became just a single eye of the creature; and the platform you crossed was its body.  Boy was I frightened!  But it all worked out in the head.  3,000 units is nothing to sneeze at! \n"}, {"text": "The creature that gives you the most units is also one of the most difficult to snapshot.  However, if you defeat him first, he won't disappear like most others do when defeated.  Instead, he falls into the water below and a pearl lays on top of him.  Then is the perfect time to use me to take a picture of him!  What is it?", "correct": "Cyclopeus Palustris", "options": ["Manta Magnificens", "Aedes Raymanis", "Anguilla Bifida"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCyclopeus Palustris.\n\n\tThe Cyclopeus palustris is more easily known as the \"Reaper\".  He can be found in the Nutripils Factory.  Just before leaving the factory, he comes out and attacks.  It can be a fairly easy battle once you figure out the pattern of attack.  It's easiest to take the picture, however, after he is dead.  He will reward you with 3,500 units!\r There is something special about the Aedes Raymanis.  It is a mosquito found on a dead cow, but notice the name; Raymanis.  It is so named because this mosquito is actually the exact same creature as the first boss Rayman comes across in \"Rayman 1\" for the Gameboy Advance.  Both \"Beyond Good and Evil\" and the \"Rayman\" series were created by the same game company. \n"}, {"text": "There are a total of 56 animals for you to take a picture of in this entire game.  Some are easy, and some are very tricky.  However, it required that you use me to take a picture of ALL of them if you want the final reward.  What is this reward?", "correct": "Bonus MDisk", "options": ["The 10 Final Pearls", "Exploding GyroDisk", "Dai-Jo becomes a lightsaber"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonus MDisk.\n\n\tEvery time you complete a film reel, the science center will reward you with something special.  The first reward is a zoom camera lens.  The next 5 rewards are pearls, but the final reward, if you manage to photograph every animal, is a special MDisk.  I won't tell you what's in it, because that ruins the surprise! \n"}]}
