She heads to the theater where Lloyd Braun comments on it and takes Jerry to pick up some gum.  Jerry can't see how much he is paying Lloyd and he ends up spending $100 on gum.

Kramer returns the glasses to their rightful owner, who preserves movie costumes.  The current one is King Henry VIII, who is the topic of the theater's latest screening, so Kramer asks to borrow it.\rIn the end, George has to wear the costume, since he's the only one who can fit into it.  He ends up realizing that he had the $20 all along and Deena finds him walking around in the costume.  He runs after her claiming it's from 'The Institute'.  At the theater, the man who took Elaine's button returns for the premiere and Elaine gets it back. \n"}]}
