{"id": "60241", "name": "Hardest Philosophical Treatises With Long Titles! Trivia Quiz | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Philosophy"], "questions": [{"text": "Which Pope came in with the real whizzer of a title, 'On the Misery of the Human Condition'?", "correct": "Innocent III", "options": ["Leo VI", "Pius X", "Gregory VII"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInnocent III.\n\n\tYou'd think the Pope's job would be to uplift and exalt, but not old Innocent. He was probably the most powerful Pope of all-time. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these fellows thought he had a best-seller with 'Oration on the Dignity of Man'?", "correct": "Pico della Mirandola", "options": ["Saint Augustine", "Coluccio Salutati", "Michael Servetus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPico della Mirandola.\n\n\tOld Pico, he was full of confidence but managed not to sell widely, but he did get the attention of Pope Alexander VI. Unfortunately, this attention was negative! \n"}, {"text": "Whose 'Declamation Concerning the False Decretals of Constantine' managed to get the attention of church authorities, but did not make the New York Times list?", "correct": "Lorenzo Valla", "options": ["Francois Rebelais", "Saint Vincent", "Martin Luther"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLorenzo Valla.\n\n\tThis work by Valla may not have made headlines, but it did prove the famous 'Donation of Constantine', a document supporting papal claims to temporal authority, to be a major forgery! \n"}, {"text": "Which fellow came up with the Michener-esque title 'Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'?", "correct": "Galileo", "options": ["Copernicus", "Newton", "Kepler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGalileo.\n\n\tOkay, so maybe it wasn't Michener-esque, per se...but I think it would make an interesting name for a novel. Galileo thought it a snappy title in his defense of the Copernican heliocentric theory, but the Church fathers didn't, they made him recant. \n"}, {"text": "'Discourses on the First Decade of Titus Livius' was most likely one of the lesser known titles from which 'prince'ly fellow?", "correct": "Machiavelli", "options": ["Petrarch", "Dante", "Boccaccio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMachiavelli.\n\n\tAh...I hope you noticed my not-so-Machiavellian hint in the question. Over time, Machiavelli has received a bad name as a result of his realist political perspective, but his writings really are fantastic! \n"}, {"text": "Whose 'Philosophical Commentary on the Words of Jesus 'Constrain them to Come in'' knocked them out in the aisles of late 17th century bookstores?", "correct": "Pierre Bayle", "options": ["Matthew Tindal", "John Toland", "Thomas Paine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPierre Bayle.\n\n\tIn this work, Bayle pleaded for religious tolerance in an age when not much was to be found. Maybe if he had shortened the title a bit more folks would have read it and we'd have a better world today? \n"}, {"text": "Which early American colonist was the author of the tome with the catchy title 'The Bloody Tenet of Persecution for Causes of Conscience'?", "correct": "Roger Williams", "options": ["William Penn", "Miles Standish", "Peter Minuet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoger Williams.\n\n\tAnother anti-intolerance (pro-tolerance?) pusher, Roger Williams fled persecution in Massachusetts before founding the Rhode Island colony. \n"}, {"text": "Just when you think the titles couldn't get any longer, along came whom with his 'Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind'?", "correct": "Marquis de Condorcet", "options": ["Cesare Beccaria", "Denis Diderot", "Pierre Turgot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarquis de Condorcet.\n\n\tCondorcet wrote 'Sketch' in 1793-4 while in hiding from those wacky Jacobins of French Revolutionary fame. Condorcet believed in toleration and the improvement of the human condition while in the midst of the horrors of his times...unfortunately, his detractors did not read his book! \n"}, {"text": "Following Olympe de Gouges' 'Declaration of the Rights of Women' in 1791, who followed up with 'Vindication of the Rights of Women' in 1792?", "correct": "Mary Wollstonecraft", "options": ["Elizabeth Browning", "Mary Shelley", "George Eliot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMary Wollstonecraft.\n\n\tMary Wollstonecraft was the mother of Mary Shelley, who prefered the less cumbersome title of 'Frankenstein' for her masterpiece. \n"}, {"text": "Whose 'Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism', published at the beginning of the 20th century, ends our tremulous trek through these treacherous titles?", "correct": "Max Weber", "options": ["Sigmund Freud", "Friedrich Engels", "John Keynes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMax Weber.\n\n\tMax Weber, still revered today as one of history's greatest sociologists. So ends our quiz...I hope you enjoyed. Despite my making light of the titles of these works, all are tremendous gifts bestowed upon posterity by the above authors...I celebrate them! \n"}]}
