{"id": "368724", "name": "Dragon Ball - Tournament Saga Quiz | Dragonball Z | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Dragonball Z"], "questions": [{"text": "When Krillin arrives, he is asked to head out with Goku to accomplish which task?", "correct": "Find a girl for Master Roshi", "options": ["Fight a harmful opponent", "Locate turtle shells", "Move the hermit house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFind a girl for Master Roshi.\n\n\tWhile Goku's request to be trained by Master Roshi on his isolated island is accepted, Krillin heads over from his monk village in the east to request the very same position under the turtle hermit.  Both of them are, inevitably, allowed to train, but only after they head back to land to find Master Roshi a girlfriend to live with them.\r While Goku looks for Roshi's girl, his friends (Bulma, Yamcha, Oolong, and Puar) crash in the jungle on their way to the city. \n"}, {"text": "What happen whenever Launch sneezes?", "correct": "She transforms into another person", "options": ["She shoots lasers", "She lays an egg", "She shrinks in size"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe transforms into another person.\n\n\tThe girl that Goku and Krillin eventually come across is none other than Launch who, half the time, is a mild-mannered, bubbly girl with purple hair who seems pleased to do her domestic duties.  Whenever she sneezes, however, she transforms into a blonde bombshell with a rough attitude (and weapons), causing her to be more trouble than she's worth when she goes off.  Unfortunately the boys don't notice that she's on the run from the police when they find her.  It isn't until they reach the island that they discover her secret. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not one of the tests set forth by Master Roshi?", "correct": "Delivering honey to locals", "options": ["Plowing a field with bare hands", "Finding a marked stone thrown into the forest", "Swimming with sharks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDelivering honey to locals.\n\n\tTo train the boys, Master Roshi forces Goku and Krillin to complete a daily regime, most of which involves repetitive, heavily-laborious tasks.  Finding a stone is the first preliminary task completed by the boys (for dinner) while the rest appeared as daily ones.  These including delivering milk to locals (up mountains, through deserts, etc.), plowing fields with bare hands, swimming with sharks, evading bees, and doing construction work.  All of this needed to be done with fifty pound turtle shells on their backs (and, later, one hundred pound shells). \n"}, {"text": "For how long do Goku and Krillin train for the World Martial Arts Tournament?", "correct": "Eight months", "options": ["They don't", "Two weeks", "Five years"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight months.\n\n\tMaster Roshi informs Goku and Krillin that their training will inevitably lead up to their competing in the World Martial Arts Tournament, the most prestigious fighting event out there, occurring once every five years.  The boys train for eight months, though not on Master Roshi's original island-- they move the house via Dyna-Cap.  At the end of the eight months, without having learned any moves from Master Roshi, the boys discover that their training was based on strength in menial tasks; the fighting would simply be an expression of their power. \n"}, {"text": "Do Yamcha, Krillin, and Goku all make it through the Elimination Round of the World Martial Arts Tournament?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tBefore any audience members can watch, the competitors are sent into the arena to battle their way into the World Martial Arts Tournament.  With one hundred and thirty-seven fighters out there, the participants need to whittle their numbers down to just eight to be able to get into the quarterfinals.  Krillin, Goku, and Yamcha all get split into different ends of different blocks, so none of them actually need to fight each other, if at all, until the finals. \n"}, {"text": "During battle against Bacterian, Goku has to remind Krillin that he lacks which of the following?", "correct": "A nose", "options": ["A backbone", "Hair", "Elbows"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA nose.\n\n\tBacterian is one of the final eight competitors appearing in the World Martial Arts Tournament and he's particularly famous for never having taken a bath, forcing other opponents to fight with only one arm.  Krillin ends up being the one to draw the slot against Bacterian while Yamcha is pitted against Jackie Chun and Goku is placed against Giran (while the final bracket includes Nam and Ranfan).  Ultimately, Krillin moves into the semi-finals when he beats Bacterian, though Goku has to remind him that he has no nose and can, thus, avoid the horrible smell in the arena. \n"}, {"text": "As the tournament wears on, Bulma, Yamcha, and the others begin to think that Jackie Chun is actually who of the following?", "correct": "Master Roshi", "options": ["Launch", "Emperor Pilaf", "The Ox-King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaster Roshi.\n\n\tWhen the group discovers that Master Roshi has been disappearing during the main battles, they start to believe that he is actually competing under the pseudonym Jackie Chun (who happens to be facing off against Yamcha in the quarterfinals and Krillin, his own pupil, in the semifinals).  When Yamcha goes out of his way to try and remove the man's wig, it won't come off.  The truth is, Master Roshi actually is Jackie Chun, and later on he's able to convince another competitor (Nam) to pose as him in the audience to throw off suspicion. \n"}, {"text": "During the final round of the World Martial Arts Tournament, which of these techniques is not used?", "correct": "Wolf Fang Fist", "options": ["Kamehameha", "Lightning Flash Surprise", "Drunken Boxing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWolf Fang Fist.\n\n\tWolf Fang Fist is Yamcha's signature move and, as such, would not appear in the final battle between Goku and Jackie Chun (actually his mentor, Master Roshi, who already beat Krillin by this point).  Over the course of the intense battle between them, both Goku and 'Jackie' use the Kamehameha Wave attack, equaling each other in strength. 'Jackie' uses the Drunken Boxing technique (followed by Goku's Crazy Monkey technique, performed with his re-acquired, regrown tail).  Towards the latter end of the battle, 'Jackie' also shoots Goku with the rare Lightning Flash Surprise attack, nearly knocking him out of the battle. \n"}, {"text": "What unfortunate incident happens during the final battle of the tournament?", "correct": "Goku transforms into a giant ape", "options": ["Goku regrows his tail", "Jackie Chun concedes", "Krillin disqualifies Goku"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoku transforms into a giant ape.\n\n\tWhen the sun sets and Goku gets hit by 'Jackie's' powerful Lightning Flash Surprise attack, all seems lost.  The full moon, however, gives Goku a chance and, when he looks at it again (and with his tail) he once more transforms into the dangerous, giant ape.  Considering the destruction the ape could make, Jackie Chun uses his remaining power to perform his strongest Kamehameha attack, destroying the ape by blowing up the moon forever.  Fortunately, Goku survives, and the battle continues. \n"}, {"text": "Does Goku win the final match of the tournament?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAfter transforming back from ape form (after 'Jackie' destroys the moon), the fight resumes, bringing Goku and 'Jackie' back to the regular rules.  Although exhausted, the two are able to keep fighting, using Kamehameha and the like until, finally, they both knock each other out.  As per the rules, the first to stand, of the two of them, would win.  Although Goku nearly follows through, it was Jackie who takes the victory, revealing himself to be Master Roshi.  To celebrate, everyone heads out for dinner, blowing the prize money on the single meal (mainly due to Goku's immense appetite). \n"}]}
