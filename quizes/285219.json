{"id": "285219", "name": "Ten Mysteries of \"The Curious Village\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games L-P", "Professor Layton Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Do Professor Layton and Luke ever find the treasure of the Golden Apple?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhen Layton and Luke reach the top of the tower in the north end of town (by solving the puzzles in St. Mystere), they find a quaint cottage filled with expensive luxuries.  Amongst these is a small girl they encountered earlier in the journey who Layton reveals to be Flora, Baron Reinhold's daughter, also known as The Golden Apple. Reinhold set up St. Mystere partially to determine a guardian for his young daughter in the event of his early death, making the townspeople fascinated with riddles and brain teasers.  When the tower is destroyed, Luke and Layton discover endless treasures and wealth behind a portrait of Flora in Reinhold Manor. Although the choice is given to Flora, the words of Baron Reinhold explain that once the treasure is removed, the town will cease to function.  Flora decides to leave it all behind and leave St. Mystere with Layton and Luke. \n"}, {"text": "Professor Layton and Luke first come to notice a horrible rumbling noise in St. Mystere.  The shockwave of this scares off Lady Dahlia's cat.  What is the cat's name?", "correct": "Claudia", "options": ["Louise", "Marie", "Dutchess"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClaudia.\n\n\tWhen this noise first hits, Claudia is frightened away, and Lady Dahlia's butler, Matthew, is unable to catch the cat before it escapes into the streets of St. Mystere.  Before Layton and Luke can go on the hunt for the Golden Apple, they must find Claudia in town.  This quest takes them back across the river and into the streets before Claudia is finally captured. However, in order to get the cat back, Layton and Luke need to complete a puzzle given to them by Agnes, 'Pigpen Partitions', so that they can get some Fish Bones to give to Claudia.  This will, in turn, end Chapter 2, and Claudia will be returned to Lady Dahlia in the manor. However, this won't solve the mystery behind the noise, which citizens of St. Mystere assume are coming from the creepy tower in the north end of town.  The incident with Claudia also introduces the fact that Luke has affection for animals. \n"}, {"text": "Shortly after taking a room in St. Mystere, Professor Layton and Luke discover that the crank for the town's only drawbridge has been stolen.  Was this crank the topic of the very first puzzle of the game?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe crank was actually used in the second puzzle, 'The Crank and Slot', which required completion in order for Professor Layton and Luke to gain entry into town.  Franco, the town's gatekeeper, requires assistance in selecting the correct slot for the crank to lower the drawbridge.  The first puzzle, 'Where's the Town', is used as an introduction for the game, and occurs before Layton and Luke actually reach St. Mystere. You will learn of the vanishing crank during your search for Claudia, but the mystery will go unsolved until much later in the game when Layton and Luke finally enter the tower in town. They discover that it was actually Bruno, who lives in the tower, who was responsible for taking the crank as a way to judge whether or not the duo was in town to claim the Golden Apple, and whether or not they were fair enough to look after Flora during their time in St. Mystere.  Taking into account the time the crank was stolen, Layton was able to solve other mysteries with the knowledge he had. \n"}, {"text": "One mystery involves Tiny Cogs, many of which are found throughout St. Mystere.  How many of these do Layton and Luke find?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Three", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tOne of these cogs will be dropped from Ramon while the other will be dropped from Simon when he is declared 'murdered' in Reinhold Manor.  Neither of these hold much importance save the fact that Layton deduces the meaning behind the citizens in town.  The fact of the matter is that they're robots, and have been dropping cogs when they've been abducted. Of course, in the case of Ramon specifically, the citizens feel sick before they're abducted.  This ties in with the reason they're abducted in the first place, and why they're dropping cogs all over the place.  This mystery is solved when Layton and Luke enter the tower in the north end of town. \n"}, {"text": "The fifth mystery is regarding Lady Dahlia.  Lady Dahlia bears an uncanny resemblance to which woman?", "correct": "Violet", "options": ["Ophelia", "Granny R", "Flora"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViolet.\n\n\tViolet happens to be Baron Reinhold's late wife, and during the course of Layton's investigations, her grave is visited on the grounds of Reinhold Manor.  This mystery is spawned after Layton and Luke view a picture on Violet on the desk in Lady Dahlia's study, and they happen to notice the resemblance between Dahlia and Violet.\rAs it turns out, there's a reason behind this as well.  Baron Reinhold had Dahlia created to that Flora would have a motherly figure growing up after Violet passed away.  Unfortunately, in her youth, Flora never took to Lady Dahlia, and the Baron's plan did not go through as well.  Despite her father's intentions, Flora resigned to the cottage on the top of the tower in the center of town, waiting for a rightful guardian to rescue her.  After passing the town's trials, Layton turns out to be that person. \n"}, {"text": "Who was responsible for abducting the citizens of St. Mystere?", "correct": "Bruno", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBruno.\n\n\tThe abductions in town had everyone concerned.  The most specific incident involving abductions was that of Ramon, the rower outside Reinhold Manor.  When Layton and Luke enter the tower in St. Mystere, they discover the secret behind this.  It turns out that Bruno had been servicing the townspeople, who are revealed to be robots, in his workshop in the basement of the tower.  Ramon just happened to need a tune-up after signs of becoming 'ill'.  It is revealed that the robots of town had no idea of their nature, and had never known that the man abducting them was actually their creator.\rAfter every abduction, mysterious cogs are left behind.  These later lead to another mystery to be solved by Layton and Luke, though after the robot revelation, it seems to be case closed on the tiny cogs. \n"}, {"text": "How are Professor Layton and Luke able to enter the rumbling tower in the center of town?", "correct": "With a key", "options": ["Through the sewers", "By following the abductor in town", "By hot air balloon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith a key.\n\n\tThe rumbling tower, the seventh mystery of the game, is introduced early on.  The rumbling is what initially sent Claudia, Lady Dahlia's cat, scurrying out of Reinhold Manor in the first few chapters, and caused the chase through town.  It is later revealed, when Layton and Luke finally enter the tower, that the rumbling is associated with the machines used by Bruno to work on the robots living in St. Mystere, hence the reason why the tower only makes noise when a citizen is abducted.  Because the town grows older, the robots do as well, and increased maintenance attributes to the fact that these noises are becoming more and more frequent.\rLayton and Luke find the key to the tower in the shed on the park's grounds. \n"}, {"text": "Did Ramon return after his abduction?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tBefore Layton and Luke reach Reinhold Manor, they come across Ramon at the river separating the house from the rest of St. Mystere.  This man acts as the crossing guard, asking a riddle in order to allow access to his rowboat and the Manor.  Eventually, Ramon will feel ill and then go missing entirely.  After a search around the village, Luke and Layton will spot Ramon getting abducted in the northern streets.  After the abductor's departure, Layton and Luke will find one of the tiny cogs in a connecting mystery.\rAlthough Bruno was clearly responsible for Ramon's abduction, Ramon is later returned to St. Mystere, feeling much better, but forgetting the entire ordeal.  This throws Layton and Luke for a loop until they realize that all of the citizens of St. Mystere are actually robots.  Ramon was simply taken in by Bruno for servicing; the illness signified wear-and-tear since Ramon was an older robot. \n"}, {"text": "Who is Inspector Chelmey revealed to be?", "correct": "Don Paolo", "options": ["Bruno", "Matthew", "Ramon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon Paolo.\n\n\tDon Paolo is evidently the arch-nemesis of Professor Layton, having attempted to foil his plans in earlier investigations.  Layton is able to unmask the faux detective during a heated encounter at Reinhold Manor when Layton is able to use the things that he says against him.  After Layton makes it clear to everyone that Chelmey isn't who he says he is (including making Chelmey mis-pronounce his own wife's name), Don Paolo takes off his mask, revealing himself as the one preventing Layton from advancing on his quest.  After the revelation, Don Paolo jumps out the window.\rAs it turns out, the real Inspector Chelmey is probably in London.  Layton discovers certain facts about him from one of the newspapers found around town, many of which are used in order to unmask the impostor. \n"}, {"text": "What destroys the shed in St. Mystere's park?", "correct": "The ferris wheel", "options": ["A bomb", "Nothing does this", "A flood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe ferris wheel.\n\n\tWhen Layton and Luke finally gain access to the park in the northwest end of town, they find a locked shed overlooking the water.  When they make their way to the ferris wheel in the northern-most section of the park, it unhinges from its base and actually follows the duo around the park grounds before crashing into the shed. When Luke and Layton follow the path inside, they find a small, furnished room containing a secret compartment which holds the Tower Key.  This, along with a cryptic page found in Baron Reinhold's old desk allow Layton to deduce where the entrance to the northern tower is located. After the key is used, that mystery is solved, and the final chapter of Professor Layton and Luke's story can begin as they ascend the tower. \n"}]}
