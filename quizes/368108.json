In that first season, they were referred to as the Toronto Arenas, which later became the Toronto St. Patricks. When Conn Smythe purchased the team in 1927, he renamed the team the Maple Leafs, and built Maple Leaf Gardens where the Leafs would play until 1999. \r In a 2013 Forbes report, the Leafs were estimated at being worth US $1.15 billion, the most in the league. But in the game it only costs $400 of Monopoly money. What a steal! \n"}, {"text": "Beside the Boardwalk, what other legendary NHL team occupies the Park Place spot in NHL Monopoly?", "correct": "Montreal Canadiens", "options": ["Toronto Maple Leafs", "Detroit Red Wings", "Boston Bruins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMontreal Canadiens.\n\n\tAlong with the Leafs, the Montreal Canadiens were also one of the four founding teams of the National Hockey League.

Nicknamed the \"Habs\", the team set a record with five consecutive Stanley Cups from 1956-60. Some of the greatest players of all-time, such as Maurice Richard, Ken Dryden, Georges Vezina and Toe Blake all spent their entire careers with the \"bleu, blanc et rouge\".\r In 2013, the Canadiens were valued at $775 million, the third highest in the league.
