Brian didn't deny this, and when they went to go visit his girlfriend, Jillian, Stewie realized that Brian was embarrassed by her because of her stupidity and only stayed with her because of her looks.  For example, she claims to have watched a documentary on a man named 'Sitler', who she thinks should be stopped for killing so many people. \n"}, {"text": "At work, Peter asked Lois to type a letter to which cereal company?", "correct": "Life", "options": ["Cheerios", "Total", "Corn Flakes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLife.\n\n\tAfter the accident involving the firecrackers, Peter returned to work at the Pawtucket Brewery only to find that he was unable to type out his reports for Angie, his boss.
