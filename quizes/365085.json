The war ended a little more than six months later, with the decisive Battle of San Jacinto, fought on the outskirts of what is now Houston TX. The 900-strong Texian Army, led by General Sam Houston, defeated General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna's Mexican Army even though they were outnumbered by almost 3:2. Some 630 Mexicans were killed whilst only nine of the Texians died. Houston himself was shot in the ankle and badly injured. Santa Anna, who was captured the next day, signed the Treaties of Velasco on May 14, 1836. The first of these two treaties dealt with prisoner exchange and the second, and more significant, promised that Mexico would never fight the Texans again. \rMexico, though, never did ratify the treaties, hence the Mexican-American War (1846-48) a decade later. By that time, though, (on December 29, 1845) Texas had been admitted to the Union as the 28th state. \n"}, {"text": "Fought on February 2, 1461, the Battle of Mortimer's Cross was a major conflict in the Wars of the Roses.
