{"id": "106705", "name": "The Most Important 'C' People Quiz | Mixed People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", " Mixed People", " People by Surname"], "questions": [{"text": "This 'C' person was originally known as 'Kurush' in his native language, and was born in about 590 B.C.  Name that person!  \n", "correct": "Cyrus", "options": ["Cambyses", "Crassus", "Croesus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCyrus.\n\n\tCyrus the Great (or Kurush, in Persian) was the founder of the Persian Empire after having succeeded his father, Cambyses I, in 558 B.C.  Upon succeeding his father, Cyrus proceeded to overthrow the Medes, Lydians and Babylonians over the following decades.  His empire was one of the greatest land empires in world history and the first large scale empire of the ancient world. \n"}, {"text": "Another 'C' person of note, he did not see the culmination of his work until the day he lay on his deathbed, when his extremely influential and most famous written work was published.  To whom am I referring?  \n", "correct": "Copernicus", "options": ["Constantine", "Comte", "Cervantes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCopernicus.\n\n\tNicolaus Copernicus (aka Mikolaj Kopernik, in Polish) was perhaps the most influential figure of modern Astronomy (though Galileo may have been equally, if not more important).  His major work \"De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium: On the Revolution of the Celestial Spheres\" was first published very late in his life, and only first presented to him on his deathbed. He was afraid that his ideas would be too controversial, and that he would suffer the wrath of the church once his ideas were disseminated widely.  It was only through the urging of his friend Georg Joachim Rheticus that Copernicus' work was ever published. \n"}, {"text": "Which 'C' person was mistaken for the god Quetzalcoatl, and responsible for the capture and sack of a city called Tenochtitl\u00e1n?     \n", "correct": "Cort\u00e9s", "options": ["Col\u00f3n", "Coronado", "Cabral"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCort\u00e9s.\n\n\tHern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s laid siege to the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n in 1520, a city that was soon renamed Mexico City.  It seems that the Aztecs, led by their emperor Montecuhzoma (Montezuma II) believed Cort\u00e9s could potentially be the god Quetzalcoatl, which weakened his response to the Spanish invasion led by Cort\u00e9s.  Cort\u00e9s can arguably be considered the greatest of the Spanish conquistadors, though one could argue that Pizarro's conquest of the Incas was of greater importance and a more impressive achievement given the odds against his success. \n"}, {"text": "Possibly the greatest monument of the ancient world was built as a tomb for this Egyptian.  What is the Greek form of his name?  \n", "correct": "Cheops", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheops.\n\n\tThe greatest achievement of Cheops (or Khufu, as he was known to the ancient Egyptians) was the building of the Great Pyramid at Giza, the tallest manmade construct for nearly 4,000 years (until the erecting of the Eiffel Tower in the 19th century).  For this simple fact alone, his name belongs in this quiz. \n"}, {"text": "This name was shared by several very successful individuals, but none greater than a certain Polish woman, born with the surname 'Sklodovska'.  What 'C' name is shared within her highly successful family?  \n", "correct": "Curie", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCurie.\n\n\tMarie Curie was born Maria Sklodowska, but emigrated from Poland to France where she married Pierre Curie.  Marie was one of only two individuals to receive Nobel Prizes in two different fields (physics and chemistry; Linus Pauling being the other).  With her husband Pierre, Marie did very important work in the study of radioactivity. The Curies had two successful daughters as well.  The eldest, named Ir\u00e8ne, carried on the family work in the study of radioactivity and won a Nobel Prize jointly with her husband Jean Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot in 1935.  The younger daughter \u00c8ve was an accomplished author and musician. \n"}, {"text": "The names Carnot and Clausius are associated with the founding of which of these sciences? \n", "correct": "Thermodynamics", "options": ["Ballistics", "Physiology", "Genetics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThermodynamics.\n\n\tThese two names may not be of the household variety, but in consideration of their major contributions to the science of thermodynamics, they deserve a mention in this quiz.  Nicolas Carnot could rightly be considered the founder of the science, with the publication of his seminal work \"On the Motive Power of Fire\" in 1824.  If you're looking for another candidate for 'father of thermodynamics', how about Rudolf Clausius who, in 1850, enunciated the 2nd law of thermodynamics in his initial paper on the mechanical theory of heat (heat cannot pass from a colder to a hotter body). \n"}, {"text": "Not primarily known as a writer, he nonetheless published numerous interesting works, including De Bello Gallico and De Bello Civili.

Caesar is also known for his famous quotes and numerous writings, including the two mentioned above.  The two selections mentioned are descriptions of the wars in Gaul and the civil wars within which he participated.  Certainly they are worthy reads! \n"}, {"text": "Who is the earliest known English poet?  \n", "correct": "Caedmon", "options": ["Chaucer", "Clarence", "Caradon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaedmon.\n\n\tCaedmon lived during the 7th century A.D. and was a monk.  Only a single, very short poem survives that can be attributed to him.  He receives mention in the history of England created by Adam Bede, in which a divine dream inspired the one poem which we can for certain attribute to this mysterious figure. \n"}, {"text": "Certainly, Confucius should get a mention here.  Confucius is the Latinized form of this great Chinese philosopher's name.

For more on his story see my quiz entitled \"Everything was Invented in China!\"  Thank you for taking the time to try this quiz, please feel free to give me any comments regarding who I've missed on my list.
