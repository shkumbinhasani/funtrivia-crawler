{"id": "343765", "name": "\"I Kissed a Girl\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Who prevents Santana from getting suspended from school?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Will", "Shelby", "Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tIn Principal Figgins' office, Santana has a conversation overseen by Shelby, Will, and Finn in which she tries to avoid getting a two week suspension for slapping Finn in the face the previous week.  She claims that a second personality was responsible but none of the teachers take kindly to this idea.  Finn, however, steps up and says she didn't hit him; it was a stage slap.  Will wonders what Finn's angle is, but he gets away with it.  Santana is off the hook.\rFinn apologizes to Santana for everything that's gone on, but he really thinks she's a good person.  She unearths the truth though-- he did it to get her and the other Trouble Tones back into the New Directions. \n"}, {"text": "What theme does Finn drum up for the Glee Clubs' weekly assignment?", "correct": "'Lady Music Week'", "options": ["'Bisexual Music Week'", "'Lesbian Music Week'", "'Curious Music Week'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Lady Music Week'.\n\n\tRachel is worried about Kurt's election prospects and the votes seem to be in Brittany's favour.  Jacob Ben Israel, planning for his blog, asks if he can upload an early concession speech but Kurt won't back down.  When Jacob leaves, he tells Rachel that he could always stuff the ballot box like JFK did in Illinois.  Rachel says he shouldn't cheat, but Kurt wonders what choice he has.  He needs to get into NYADA and this is how.\rIn the choir room, New Directions and the Trouble Tones discuss this week's assignment, as decided by Finn: 'Lady Music Week'.  It's a week of music created by ladies for ladies.  He directs this toward Santana and she puts up a defensive wall, but he makes it clear that they're there to support her.  Blaine and Kurt sing P!nk's \"Perfect\" to kick the festivities off.  It doesn't go well; Santana tears them down after. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these men is not listed in Sue's 'Booty Calls' book?", "correct": "Mike Tyson", "options": ["Matt Lauer", "Stephen Baldwin", "Dan Quayle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike Tyson.\n\n\tSue is worried that her own election prospects are sliding downhill; polls have her tied with one of her lesser competitors and her image has been depreciated by an advertisement (about Santana's lesbianism) that hasn't even aired.  She reiterates that she likes men and realizes that she needs a man around her shoulder during the election to boost her image.  She makes a decision after reviewing a book of past booty calls.\rIn the teacher's lounge, Beiste eats a turducken (chicken stuffed in duck, stuffed in turkey) while Emma watches on in disgust.  When Will comes in, she mentions that she's been tired lately because of her relationship with Cooter Menkins, the talent scout, and she says that he's really the man for her.  Will and Emma are both thrilled to see she's interested in someone. \n"}, {"text": "When Puck sings \"I'm the Only One\", he seems to be directing it at which of these people?", "correct": "Shelby", "options": ["Himself", "Quinn", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShelby.\n\n\tPuck is next to perform a song this week.  He decides upon Melissa Etheridge's \"I'm the Only One\" and it's hard to tell who he's directing the song toward.  Shelby is far from pleased though.  At the end of the song he says it was for Santana but turns to face Shelby.  Quinn approaches him after the session and questions him about his motives.  Quinn invites him over for Friday night and makes explicit suggestions as to what they should do but he rejects her offer saying that she's extremely high maintenance, a bit crazy, and quite selfish.\rSantana is still angry with Finn for the decision to make it 'Lady Music Week' but he says he's just concerned about her and he doesn't want her to hurt herself when she's forced to come out of the closet by the political video.  He sings a low-key version of Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" for the assignment with the guys backing him.  She genuinely thanks him for the song. \n"}, {"text": "Sue and Cooter go on a date to which location?", "correct": "Breadstix", "options": ["Olive Garden", "The McKinley High auditorium", "Denny's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBreadstix.\n\n\tOrdering a lot of chicken from Breadstix, Coach Beiste witnesses Sue on a date with Cooter Menkins.

When Sue takes a call from \"USA Today\", Cooter tells Beiste that he's not sure what to do.  He's been trying to make the moves around Shannon but she won't reciprocate the feelings.  He's looking for a girlfriend, not a buddy.\rAt school, the school election (and real election) are underway.

Mercedes says Brittany's crazy and if Santana's girlfriend got voted in, they'd never hear the end of it; Kurt gets her vote.  Mike and Finn vote for Kurt as well while Brittany and Santana vote for Britt (obviously).  Kurt is worried about the possibilities.  His NYADA acceptance depends entirely on checkmarks on a ballot.  He lets fate decide.\rWill and Emma speak to Beiste who, considering Cooter and Sue are in the same room together, is anxious.  Sue actually has Becky deliver a Polaroid of the two of them kissing to rub it in but Will assures her it's nothing more than a campaign strategy.

Santana says that she told her parents the truth and they were okay with it; she just needs to tell her Abuela.\rKurt, meanwhile, is called into Principal Figgins' office for a very pressing matter.

When he goes to find Blaine, Rachel admits to Finn that she was responsible; she wanted to help so badly and she wasn't thinking at the time.\rIn math class, Puck receives an emergency call which turns out to be from Shelby at the hospital.  Beth bit her lip when she fell and needed stitches.  Shelby and Puck end up in bed together because of Puck's consoling and she says that it was a big mistake.

She says that it should've stayed secret and she asks Santana to leave and never come back.\rPuck decides to go to Quinn's anyways and she makes it clear that she wants another baby.

Cooter makes it clear that he has feelings for both of them and Sue says that he's important to her now.  Beiste finally finds in in herself to say she loves Cooter and she says she won't lose him without a fight because she'd do anything to be with him.\rIn the choir room, Will and Shelby congratulate the kids for a great week and anticipate each others' rivalry in the following week at Sectionals.
