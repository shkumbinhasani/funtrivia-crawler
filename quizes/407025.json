{"id": "407025", "name": "\"The Future Perfect\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Double Feature"], "questions": [{"text": "When, according to Valiant Thor, is the alien-human hybrid likely to be perfected?", "correct": "2021", "options": ["1985", "2050", "2000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2021.\n\n\tIn 1972, Richard Nixon laments the ongoing struggles of the human-alien agreement while protestors storm the White House gates.  Valiant Thor reminds him that the war is performing an important function; while the American people are distracted by a war, they don't notice all the people going missing.  They knew the experimentation would take a while, but the first successful hybrid, per their estimates, wouldn't be ready until 2021.  Valiant Thor suggests that they have a fifty-year plan of distractions, and those can come in many forms. As Henry Kissinger leaves the Oval Office, he checks the mirror and readjusts his skin suit. \n"}, {"text": "Did Dwight D. Eisenhower take Valiant Thor's offer of immortality?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThree years before Nixon faced the crowds protesting the Vietnam War, Dwight D. Eisenhower rested in his deathbed and pondered his choices while watching the news.  On one hand, he allowed Americans to be experimented on, but on the other he paved the way for the Nixon presidency.  Mamie assured him that it wasn't quite so bad.  Dwight, however, knew that something was much worse than it seemed; he'd started seeing the aliens everywhere.\r Valiant Thor stopped by Dwight's room in his final days to offer a trip to Area 51 where he would be able to live on, immortal, with the help of the aliens.  Dwight, however, refused the offer, claiming he died the day he signed the treaty.  When he finally passed, Mamie gave him a farewell kiss and took Valiant Thor's offer for herself. \n"}, {"text": "Who, unbeknownst to the public, is Deep Throat?", "correct": "Mamie Eisenhower", "options": ["Henry Kissinger", "Valiant Thor", "Richard Nixon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMamie Eisenhower.\n\n\tIn 1972, Gordon Liddy arrives at the White House to hear out Nixon.  The President claims that the 'powers that be' want him dead.  It isn't because the aliens wanted him to have the lead, but because he could be a scapegoat.  He asks that that Valiant Thor's room in the Watergate Hotel be bugged.  They'll get the proof they need.\r As the plans are set into motion, Mamie Eisenhower ends up in a parking garage in Washington D.C., ready to relinquish the necessary information.  She says that she shall only be known as 'Deep Throat'.  Mamie later reveals her recent goings-on to Valiant Thor and he is delighted with her interference as it allows the aliens to avoid killing Nixon; too many politicians have died lately. \n"}, {"text": "Radio stations report that Mamie Eisenhower died where?", "correct": "In a hospital", "options": ["On a vacation", "In the White House", "At home, in bed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a hospital.\n\n\tNixon confides in Kissinger in the Oval Office that he doesn't know what to do and the only suggestion he receives is to resign from the Presidency.  History, Kissinger asserts, will remember Nixon much more kindly.  Nixon nearly changes his mind after Kissinger leaves the room.  Instead, he's abducted by the aliens and compelled via other means.\r Mamie and Valiant Thor watch the resignation from the Eisenhower house and Mamie admits that she is ready for a quiet death.  She's accomplished enough, and with Valiant Thor's help, she can live forever.  Radios report that she died peacefully in her sleep at Walter Reed Hospital. \n"}, {"text": "In 1979, Mamie Eisenhower heads to Area 51.  Does she ever leave?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn 1979, Mamie is brought via a car to Area 51 and when she arrives she takes Valiant Thor's arm in her's and walks across the threshold, never to come out again.  With the world believing her dead, she can only walk the white halls of the facility for the rest of her endless days.  Heading to the cafeteria in the end of the decade, she meets Calico for the first time, hitting it off almost immediately.  Calico, recognizing the former First Lady, admits to liking the 'old school' Presidents' wives more.  They start to get to know each other.\r In the present day, the alarms begin to sound as the military navigates the halls.  An event has occurred. \n"}, {"text": "Cal's baby takes how many victims before it's killed?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Two", "Four", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThe military, searching the rooms as the alarms sound, pass through not only Kendall and Jamie's room, but Mamie Eisenhower's.  Mamie is able to get information out of one of the men, discovering that there's been an unauthorized death in the facility, something that never happens.  She's asked to stay in her room.\r The men find the death having already taken place in the moon landing set.  There, both Cal and Troy lay dead.  The alien baby attacks, killing one of the men before it can be killed itself.  When Theta finds the remains, she has the squadron killed for their insolence.  It's a real shame, she says, as the regression in the child's form hasn't happened in two cycles. \n"}, {"text": "Calico likens the abducted humans to which of these?", "correct": "Rats in a maze", "options": ["Cats in a box", "Butterflies in a jar", "Fish in a tank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRats in a maze.\n\n\tAll subjects in Area 51 are asked to make their way to the cafeteria for evaluation and when Kendall and Jamie arrive there to find all the remaining humans, they realize that Cal and Troy are missing.  They ask Calico where they could be, but they're reminded that they might as well consider themselves trapped like rats in a maze.  There's no way out.  Jamie says there might be one place they could be, and when they check the moon landing set, they confirm their suspicions-- all of the bodies are still there.  Theta finds the girls just in time for both of them to go into labour. \n"}, {"text": "Whose baby is considered to be the perfect hybrid specimen?", "correct": "Kendall's", "options": ["Mamie's", "Jamie's", "Cal's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKendall's.\n\n\tKendall and Jamie awaken in labour, both strapped down in an operation room.  As Theta calms the two and speaks to the girls telepathically, Kendall reminds her friend to let the baby be removed from her.  Once it's out, they can think about what to do next.  Jamie's baby is born first, and when they take it from her, they quickly take it across the room, analyze it, and kill it, noting it to be closer than ever before to the ideal specimen.  Theta, not taking chances, has Jamie killed to prevent her escape.\r Kendall is next.  As the attendants perform the operation, this newest specimen is considered perfect.  The experiment is over.  The aliens have done what they set out to do. \n"}, {"text": "Valiant Thor admits that the aliens' goal is to do which of the following?", "correct": "Populate the Earth", "options": ["Take their technology and leave", "Move on to the next project", "Remain hidden, affecting Earth's history"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPopulate the Earth.\n\n\tThough Kendall gives birth to the perfect hybrid and Theta is pleased with the results of the operation, the strife isn't quite over.  Kendall insists that it's only a matter of time before the Earth understands the aliens' conquest.  Theta wastes no time here either.  Taking a cutting device, she has Kendall beheaded.  Her body is still the perfect breeding machine; the head is replaced with a silver orb.\r In the cafeteria, Mamie celebrates another year while Calico sings 'Happy Birthday'.  She has the blues, however, since the never-ending life locked away in Area 51 is far from a life worth living.  The festivities, despite Calico's best intentions, come to an end when the room is informed of the first successful hybrid.  When Mamie asks Valiant Thor for the truth, he admits it's the case.  They will clone the breeder and populate the Earth with their hybrids.  Certain people will be spared; the rest will not. \n"}, {"text": "Is Mamie able to kill the perfect specimen?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhen Valiant Thor admits the truth behind the human genocide and confirms Eisenhower's suspicions of other alien races to be true, Mamie realizes that she must act.  She speaks to Theta in the lab for the very first time, asking to see the hybrid if only because her husband never lived to see the day when his efforts could be validated.  Sure enough, she sees the baby and its mother for the first time, coming to realize that the aliens' plans to wipe out humanity must be true, and it's because of this that she asks Calico to help her save the planet.\r Mamie and Calico return to the lab with Mamie believing she has Theta on her side.  Calico tries to talk the former First Lady out of her decision, but Mamie is unflappable.  She picks up a scalpel and approaches the newborn and Theta, using her powers, stops her, revealing that she never intended to help.  The aliens and the hybrids will restore the balance to Earth and save it; humans had their chance.  As Theta gives Calico the opportunity to be the mother to the future beings of Earth, she kills Mamie, blowing up her head.\r The aliens intensify the birthing process, allowing Kendall's body to give birth once an hour.  As Calico delivers the next child, it proves to be another perfect specimen. \n"}]}
