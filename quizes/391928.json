{"id": "391928", "name": "10 Average Questions about 30 Days of Night", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "T", "Tg - Tm Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "The movie takes place in which Alaskan town?", "correct": "Barrow", "options": ["Juneau", "Anchorage", "Whittier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarrow.\n\n\tAs the prologue of the film states, Barrow, Alaska is the northernmost town in the United States and it's isolated in eighty miles of roadless wilderness, cut off every winter for thirty days of night.\r The film begins as Sheriff Eben Olemaun finds a pile of burned cell phones; someone seems to have stolen the town's devices and destroyed them for some purpose, and on the last day of sun before the town's thirty days of night.  As people prepare to leave Barrow, the population drops from around 600 to 150, just enough to keep the town running during the dark month.  Little do they know, someone is working against them, stranding them by killing their dogs and cutting all forms of communication. \n"}, {"text": "Stella doesn't make her flight because of which of these?", "correct": "Auto accident", "options": ["Inclement weather", "A birthday party", "Missed her alarm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAuto accident.\n\n\tEben's ex-wife, Stella, is in town for work.  As a fire marshal, she's required to inspect equipment and structures throughout Alaska, and her trip to Barrow lands on the final day of sun.  As she heads to the airport, her vehicle is run off the road and she needs to get another ride.  She calls Eben, but she doesn't make it in time, so she's stranded.\r Eben, meanwhile, is called out to the utilidor to investigate some vandalism.  Someone seems to have pulled the throttle and communications equipment from a local pilot's helicopter, tossing it into a mechanical shredder.\r Out at the TekCom building, a local is killed and fed on by a group of humanoid creatures when he leaves to check the power lines.  A group of pipeline workers also ends up getting ambushed on their way home. \n"}, {"text": "A mysterious stranger arrives at the town diner asking for which of these to eat?", "correct": "Raw meat", "options": ["Blood", "A sandwich", "A salad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaw meat.\n\n\tA strange man stops in at Barrow's local diner looking for some raw hamburger meat as Eben arrives.  He seems to be ready to fight, but Stella is able to subdue the man with her firearm.  She tags along, heading with Eben to the station with their vandalism suspect.  Eben speaks to the mysterious stranger who, as it seems, isn't from Barrow at all.  He speaks cryptically about what's to come and they aren't able to get anything substantial from him before the power goes out in town, kicking the generators into gear.\r While the others stay at the station, Eben heads to the telecom building to check on things only to find the place destroyed and the operator dead.  Only his head remains, placed on a pike.  He informs the townspeople to hide in their homes.  It doesn't help.  Some are ambushed in their own homes. \n"}, {"text": "The vampires are shown to have superhuman strength.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tEben returns to the station to ask for answers from the mysterious man, but he doesn't let anything out about what's happening.  Eben and Stella head out into town, but things get even more concerning as the creatures make themselves known.  Whatever's out there is able to chase down their truck and climb on top.  Barrow is already in a state of chaos though.  Returning to the station, the stranger is the only one remaining, and he laments not being taken by the creatures and made a part of their group.  Eben decides to leave him there, cuffed to a prison cell.\r Elsewhere in town, the vampires gather. \n"}, {"text": "The survivors manage to hide in which of these locations for eighteen days?", "correct": "An attic", "options": ["A cellar", "An ice fishing hut", "An igloo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn attic.\n\n\tWhen the vampires attack, they do so mercilessly, breaking into homes and feeding indiscriminately.  Although locals use guns and fire to battle their enemies, they don't seem to ward off the creatures.  Eben and Stella are able to make it to the diner where a small group of survivors have managed to hide out.  They decide to move to a local house, already boarded up for the winter, and take refuge inside a hidden attic space in an attempt to wait out the nightmare outside.  From there, they listen as guns are fired and locals scream in the night.  They decide to ration their food and sleep in shifts in the meantime.\r At the police station, the vampires find the stranger cuffed to his prison cell and kill him.  They were only using him anyways. \n"}, {"text": "Eben loses which of these, much to his detriment?", "correct": "Inhaler", "options": ["Gun", "Keys", "Flashlight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInhaler.\n\n\tThe vampires begin ransacking the town, checking every house in their feeding frenzy, and after seven days, the vampires try to use a local as bait to lure out any survivors.  The survivors decide that they shall leave the attic when they have proper cover to do so, so there's no choice but to wait out for the next blizzard. But on that seventh day, Eben tries to get outside to help only to come across a local man, now transformed into one of the vampires.  He has no choice but to fight back, and manages to get the upper hand when he grabs an axe and swings.  He makes it back, but loses his asthma inhaler and has to be helped back to the attic. \n"}, {"text": "During a blizzard, the survivors are able to make it to which of these locations?", "correct": "General store", "options": ["Diner", "Police station", "Airport"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneral store.\n\n\tOn Day 18, the attic survivors are able to make their way, under the cover of the stormy weather, to the general store to restock their supplies for the coming days.  While there, they encounter a young girl, now transformed into a vampire, and are forced to kill her in gruesome fashion.  While this happens though, the whiteout ends, and they find themselves trapped in the store with no outside cover.\r The survivors decide that they need to aim to hide out in the utilidor, but there's no way to get there without some sort of diversion.  Eben volunteers to do it. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Eben use to burn one of the vampires?", "correct": "Ultraviolet light", "options": ["Flare gun", "Lighter fluid", "Pure sodium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUltraviolet light.\n\n\tTo help the others, Eben runs through Barrow making noise and leading the vampires out towards his grandmother's house.  He fires up the generator and waits for them to approach, and when he does he manages to detach one of her marijuana-growing UV lights and use it to blind one of the vampires.  It works instantly, burning one of the vampires horribly-- enough so that they need to put her out of her misery.  Eben is able to reunite with the others at the police station when another distraction is made, but the survivors lose several of their own in the process. \n"}, {"text": "Who never makes it to the utilidor?", "correct": "Stella", "options": ["Billy", "Eben", "Jake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStella.\n\n\tAfter Day 18, only five living people remain amongst the survivor group in Barrow.  They remain in the police station until Day 27 at which point, Eben and Stella catch a signal from Eben's deputy, Billy, in a nearby house.  They rush over to get him, but on returning to the station they find that the others have left for the utilidor.  It's on their way there that they catch the attention of the vampires and Eben and Billy need to create another distraction to protect the others.\r Eben and Billy both make it to the utilidor and find the others (except for Stella, who never made it to the rendezvous), but they've been followed as well.  Billy is able to toss the pursuing vampire into the mechanical shredder, but not before he's bitten in the neck.  Eben, who can see that Billy is starting to transform, decapitates him before anything more can happen. \n"}, {"text": "Does anyone make it to sunrise on the thirtieth day?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWith the sun coming up the next day and Stella hiding under a vehicle in the Barrow streets, the survivors watch as the vampires break the oil pipeline and set the town ablaze.  To protect Stella and any other towns in the vampires' sights, Eben decides to take an extreme stance by taking a syringe of Billy's blood and injecting it into himself, inevitably transforming himself into a vampire.  While the others hide away, Eben heads off to town and Jake walkie-talkie's Stella to get her to flee.  Eben gets into a fist-fight with the lead vampire, losing for most of their battle, but inevitably getting the upper hand, punching a hole directly through his head.  The other vampires, seeing this show of strength, disperse without their leader and leave Barrow.\r As the clouds begin to clear, Stella approaches Eben and thanks him for what he's done.  As dawn approaches, the two of them head off to the water's edge to watch the sunrise.  The sun rises and Eben burns away to ash in Stella's arms. \n"}]}
