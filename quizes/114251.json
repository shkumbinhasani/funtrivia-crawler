{"id": "114251", "name": "'R'esplendent Art Terms Quiz | Art | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Art Terms"], "questions": [{"text": "The term 'ready-made' is most often associated with French Dada artist Marcel Duchamp, who developed this sometimes bizarre and hilarious new artform.  Which of the following items did not become one of Duchamp's famous ready-mades?  \n", "correct": "A box spring", "options": ["A snow shovel", "A bicycle wheel", "A urinal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA box spring.\n\n\tDuchamp shocked the art world with his new 'designs', including: a bicycle wheel mounted atop a kitchen stool, a bottle rack (imaginatively entitled 'Bottle Rack'), a snow shovel (playfully called 'In Advance of the Broken Arm') and a urinal, signed by 'R. Mutt' and called 'Fountain'.  He made several replica copies of these various works and they can be seen in modern art museums around the world.  An aside...One time, I entered an art museum and noticed a fire extinguisher in the corner...my first thought was...is that a Duchamp ready-made?  I was disappointed to find out that it was not! \n"}, {"text": "Which 'R' art term is used, in a broad sense, to imply artwork which faithfully strives to depict things as they naturally appear, and in a specific sense to a mid-19th century French art movement led by Gustave Courbet?  \n", "correct": "Realism & Realisme & Realist & Realist Movement & Realism Movement & Realistic & Realists & The Realists & R\u00e9alisme", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRealism & Realisme & Realist & Realist Movement & Realism Movement & Realistic & Realists & The Realists & R\u00e9alisme.\n\n\tThough the broader term 'realism' is quite vague, implying that a sense of 'reality' has been accurately in a particular work of art, the French movement in the mid-1800s was quite specific.  Courbet and his cohorts specifically rejected traditional subjects, whether they be historical, religious or mythological, in favor of unadulterated scenes of modern life. This trend towards realism was not unique to the visual arts, in literature it was taken up by Flaubert, Balzac, Dickens and many others.  The French realists, especially Courbet (and Manet), had a profound influence on the Impressionists. \n"}, {"text": "This was an art movement that flourished in the United States in the 1930s, and had its advocates in Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood and John Curry.  What was it called?  \n", "correct": "Regionalism", "options": ["Renewalism", "Revivalism", "Regalism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRegionalism.\n\n\tAlso known as 'American Scene' painting, Regionalism was a reaction to the European avante-garde styles that were becoming popular in art circles among major American cities.  Painters in the small-town American midwest, viewing the strange new European art trends as a threat, sought to create a uniquely American art style using rural themes and inspired by patriotic ideas. The works of the Regionalist painters became quite popular during the depression era of the 1930s, but unfortunately World War II brought a virtual end to their designs.  Strangely enough, the most famous artist of the next U.S. generation of painters, Jackson Pollock of the New York School, was a student of Benton during his early years. Pollock certainly did not continue with the Regionalist style of Benton. \n"}, {"text": "'Relief' (or 'rilevare', in Italian) refers to sculpture that projects out from a flat surface, such as a wall or door.  Which of these terms refers to the lowest form of relief'?  \n", "correct": "Schiacciato", "options": ["Mezzo-relief", "Bas-relief", "Alto-relief"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSchiacciato.\n\n\tThe levels of relief listed are, in order of degree of projection: 'alto-relievo' (high or 'haut' relief), 'mezzo-relievo' (medium or half relief), 'basso rilievo' (low or bas-relief) and 'rilievo stiacciato' (squashed relief or 'schiacciato').  Hollow or concave relief refers to a relief in which the sculpture is carved into the plane, rather than projecting out.  'Schiacciato' was a style invented by the great Renaissance sculptor Donatello, and typically only extends off the surface at only a paper's width! \n"}, {"text": "Now I will provide you with some 'relief', namely an easier question.  The word 'Renaissance' can be best translated into English as which of these?  \n", "correct": "Rebirth", "options": ["Recent", "Rebound", "Recollection"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRebirth.\n\n\tThe Renaissance, which arguably began in the 14th century with Dante in authorship and Giotto in painting, was a hearkening back to an earlier time when the Greeks and Romans were at their artistic heights.  It was a period where rediscovery of classical painting and sculptural techniques went hand in hand with innovative new developments in architecture, perspective, etc. \n"}, {"text": "What is the French language term that describes something, perhaps a tree, that is placed in the foreground and to the side of a painting for the purpose of giving depth to the work?  \n", "correct": "Repoussoir", "options": ["Retardataire", "Recrudescence", "Remonstrant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRepoussoir.\n\n\tThe word 'repoussoir' literally means 'to push back or set off'.  The arrangement of shrubs, buildings or other elements, called 'coulisse' (Fr., wing), is an example of this technique used very commonly during the Baroque period. \n"}, {"text": "The 'R' terms 'retable' and 'reredos' relate to which church-related item?  \n", "correct": "Altar", "options": ["Choir", "Nave", "Atrium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAltar.\n\n\tOn the back or behind the altar stands a raised shelf or screen.  If the shelf is at the back of the altar slab, it is called a 'retable'.  If it is an ornamental screen mounted on the wall behind the altar it is called a 'reredos'.  Both items may contain items like the altar cross, and both might contain paintings or statuettes.  There's quite a variety in these items, so it's difficult to describe them with great accuracy...it's a mix and match affair! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is a drinking vessel shaped like a horn and used during ancient times, the end of which frequently took on zoomorphic forms?  \n", "correct": "Rhyton", "options": ["Rylix", "Raku", "Rekexis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRhyton.\n\n\tIts name coming from the Greek 'rhuton', meaning 'fluid', a 'rhyton' was largely a ceremonial item which was fashioned in the shape of an animal horn and decorated with the head of a bull, the shape of a horse, among other zoomorphic configurations.  I think it's high time we return to drinking out of rhytons, by golly! \n"}, {"text": "Watteau, Boucher and Fragonard were three key French practioners of the Rococo style.  Which of the following is an Italian artist also associated with the Rococo movement?  \n", "correct": "Tiepolo", "options": ["Reni", "Tintoretto", "Giorgione"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTiepolo.\n\n\tThe Rococo movement of the 18th century was characterized by the almost excessive use of ornamentation, a final culmination of the Baroque.  Though Rococo art could become overly decorative, some practioners such as Watteau and Tiepolo created works of great and unforgettable beauty.  The word 'rococo' is used in modern English to describe anything with elaborate decoration or fanciful ornamentation, and has a slightly negative connotation. \n"}, {"text": "This 'R' architectural term is used to describe either a round building, typically covered by a dome, or a large round room.  To which 'R' art term do I refer?  \n", "correct": "Rotunda", "options": ["Rinceau", "Rondo", "Refectory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRotunda.\n\n\tYou may have heard of the 'capital rotunda'.  That's the large, circular room within the United States capital...and in fact can refer to any large, usually circular room, in a building of significant size.  It's name relates to the Latin word 'rota', which means wheel.  Thank you once again for attempting this quiz.
