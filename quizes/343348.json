{"id": "343348", "name": "Don't Stop Succeeding Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Which video game ends when you retrieve the Super Happy Tree?", "correct": "Yoshi's Story", "options": ["LittleBigPlanet", "Kirby: Return to Dreamland", "Patapon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoshi's Story.\n\n\t\"Yoshi's Story\", released in 1998, featured several differently coloured Yoshis on a quest to return their land back to normal after the evil Baby Bowser steals the Super Happy Tree.  While most of the game really involves eating a bunch of fruit to proceed to new levels, you can also play the game for completion's sake and find hearts to unlock new levels, locate the Black and White Yoshis, and fight for high scores.  The game ends and the story is complete when Baby Bowser is felled in the sixth and final stage, a castle level.\r\"Yoshi's Story\" was popular enough as an early Nintendo 64 title, earning a Player's Choice designation.  Nonetheless it was panned by many critics for being way too simplistic in difficulty, style, and story. \n"}, {"text": "You know you're succeeding when you're rewarded, right?  In what Xbox 360 game can you receive the 'Traditional' achievement?", "correct": "Castle Crashers", "options": ["Halo: Reach", "Assassin's Creed 2", "God of War 3"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCastle Crashers.\n\n\t\"Castle Crashers\", the only XBLA option listed, rewards the 'Traditional' achievement when you beat the game once as any character.  There is no greater success than beating a game, right?  Oh wait, there's prestige.\rWe've got that covered too-- \"Castle Crashers\" contains achievements for kissing all four of the game's princesses ('K.I.S.S.'), one for defeating a boss without magic ('Melee is Best'), and more.  And you know what?  You'll get GamerPoints!  There's prestige for you!\r\"Castle Crashers\" was relatively popular being a cheerful yet occasionally challenging (and possibly four-player co-op) title for the XBLA.  Released in 2008 and developed by The Behemoth (who, earlier, made \"Alien Hominid\"), the game made its way to the Playstation 3 PSN service in 2010.  You can get trophies there instead of achievements, of course. \n"}, {"text": "Success!  You've won on the slots at the Game Corner in a \"Pokemon\" video game!  What does this mean you can do?", "correct": "Purchase a Pokemon", "options": ["Purchase a Bicycle", "Complete the game", "Ride the SS Anne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPurchase a Pokemon.\n\n\tSuccess doesn't need to be measured in a game's main objective.  \"Pokemon\" is a large series spread over dozens of games and containing hundreds of distracting tidbits.  Dating all the way back to \"Pokemon Blue and Red\" you can find the Game Corner (in those games, in Celadon City) where you can try your luck at the slot machines to earn coins which can be traded in for exclusive prizes.  In later games, slots aren't the only options either; there are card games as well.  If you're rich, you can always buy your coins instead-- no one's stopping you.  Sometimes success is measured in other aspects of gameplay.\rGame Corners appear in later games in Goldenrod City and Veilstone City (among others).  In all of the games, the option to buy rare Pokemon is available; in \"Blue\" and \"Red\", it's one of the only ways to obtain a Porygon. \n"}, {"text": "Maybe shiny things are your goal; success comes in the form of stars in \"Rock Band\" and \"Dance Central\", but what colour star is better than the rest?", "correct": "Gold", "options": ["Silver", "White", "Rainbow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGold.\n\n\tWhenever you play a song or perform a dance in one of these two games, your score ultimately decides how successful you were.  While you will be given a percentage of notes or steps hit after completion of the song, one of the more rewarding indicators is the star system, which ranks you in real time during the song for streaks of notes/moves correctly hit. Five stars is the highest amount one can receive, but you can also receive gold stars if you're playing on the highest difficulty available.  The typical gold star score in \"Rock Band\" equates to approximately 1.4x the five star score.  You need to be nearly perfect to get it. \n"}, {"text": "In the \"Professor Layton\" series, successful completion of a puzzle results in a certain amount of which of these?", "correct": "Picarats", "options": ["Hint coins", "Gold feathers", "Fish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPicarats.\n\n\tPicarats have no use in the story proper in \"Professor Layton\" games, but they do unlock various add-ons, puzzles, and hidden features if you receive a certain amount.  If you complete a puzzle on the first try without an incorrect answer you will receive the maximum amount as determined by the puzzle's difficulty.  If you get the answer wrong the maximum you can receive will diminish by a certain percent.  If you get stuck, Hint Coins are hidden around the world and can aid you in times of confusion.\rSuccess is completely reliant on your ability to solve lateral thinking puzzles-- you'll know you've got it right by an exclamation of success from one of the games' principal characters (Professor Layton, Luke, Viola, Emmy, etc.) and a screen stating that you're correct. \n"}, {"text": "In what Xbox 360/PS3 video game do you succeed by ringing a bell to exit a nightmarish dream world?", "correct": "Catherine", "options": ["Bayonetta", "Brink", "Darksiders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatherine.\n\n\tIn \"Catherine\", your success depends entirely on whether or not you can adequately climb complicated mountains of moveable blocks in order to escape a horribly tragic fate in your dreams (including plummeting to your death, getting eaten or sliced in half, getting impaled on spikes, etc.).  As Vincent Brooks, the point of the game is to finally find satisfaction in your life by choosing to be with either Katherine, your current girlfriend, or let yourself be seduced by Catherine, a younger girl.  This clearly has an affect on your sleep patterns, especially when the supernatural is involved.\r\"Catherine\" was a big hit for the Japanese developers at Atlas resulting in great review scores and a large amount of sales despite being somewhat of a niche puzzle game. \n"}, {"text": "In the PC versions of \"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?\", how do you succeed in your cases?", "correct": "By capturing criminals", "options": ["By finding your way back to HQ", "By defeating clones of Carmen", "By flying to different locations as cheaply as possible"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy capturing criminals.\n\n\tA classic series for Broderbund Software in the 1990s, \"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego\" was a series of geography-based games in which players needed to travel around the world stopping master thief Carmen Sandiego and her V.I.L.E. henchmen.  You worked as an ACME field agent traveling from country to country, receiving tips from locals, and ultimately catching her cronies. The case could only be closed if you had a full warrant for the suspect and you caught them.  This would often return a famous landmark back to its rightful country (eg. The Great Wall of China).  Later games in the series took players on history-infused journeys through time and into a vocabulary builder around the world in \"Word Detective\".  All of these involve solving cases. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" for the Wii, let's say you're playing a stock battle.  If you're the only winner, how much stock are you likely to have?", "correct": "Any of these amounts", "options": ["Ten", "Five", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAny of these amounts.\n\n\tIn a stock battle, players receive a certain stock of lives with which they must fight.  Let's say the battle has ten stock.  As the battle progresses, players will be defeated and stock will diminish, just like in a typical platform game, until you run dry.  The only player left standing in this type of battle will be the only player with stock remaining.  As such, any number higher than zero will mean that you've succeeded at defeating your foes.\r\"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", the third game in the series, was released for the Wii in 2008 to critical acclaim and high sales.  Other than stock battles you can also have timed and coin matches in mutliplayer.  This doesn't scratch the surface on the many other facets of gameplay including a sprawling adventure mode and mini-games. \n"}, {"text": "In some video games, success is measured by how high your score can be.  In which \"Wii Sports\" game is the lowest score the winner?", "correct": "Golf", "options": ["Baseball", "Bowling", "Tennis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolf.\n\n\tJust like in real life, golf is played with the fewest shots denoting the winner.  While some of the holes in \"Wii Sports\" golf are near impossible to find on a regular golf course, the game is played the same; you try and shoot as close to par or as far under as you can.  Multiple players can take turn to step up to the tee and take their shot.  In fact, the only sports on the \"Wii Sports\" disc to involve more than one player at a time are Tennis and Boxing.\r\"Wii Sports\" was originally bundled with the Wii Console making it one of the most widely-distributed video games ever created.  As a result of its inherent success (keyword, see!) a sequel called \"Wii Sports Resort\" was released in 2009, almost three years after the launch of the Wii, to showcase the precise movements of Wii Motion Plus.  It also saw success from a sales and critical standpoint. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes success is everybody celebrating your victory.  If you successfully complete a scenario in \"Roller Coaster Tycoon\" (PC), what happens?", "correct": "Your visitors will release balloons", "options": ["Fireworks will be shot off", "You'll unlock an ampitheater", "Your park will receive an influx of rich visitors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYour visitors will release balloons.\n\n\tSometimes a simple 'Hurrah!' does it, right?  Some scenarios in \"Roller Coaster Tycoon\" can take up to four years (in-game) and after creating an elaborate park with so-and-so many visitors and a high park rating, it's nice to see some appreciation.  When the season rolls over from October to March, your reward will be given-- everyone in the park will release their balloons provided you have a Balloon Stall set up in the park; they'll also applaud.  After completing the scenario you can also write your name in and you can see your record (including park and company values) from the main menu.\r\"Roller Coaster Tycoon\" released two sequels in later years and is often regarded as one of the more comprehensive and popular games of the 'Tycoon' wave popularized with 'SimCity' and 'The Sims' in the early 2000s. \n"}]}
