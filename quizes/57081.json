{"id": "57081", "name": "Sumo Terminology Online Trivia | Sports Other | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", " Sports Other", "Wrestling - Sumo"], "questions": [{"text": "A Sumo wrestler's waist-belt is adorned by stiffened silk cords which serve merely as ornamentation. What are these dangling adornments called?", "correct": "Sagari", "options": ["Dohyo", "Banzuke", "Sekitori"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSagari.\n\n\tIt is legal for a wrestler to grasp the sagari, but they fall off easily so it's of virtually no use for them to do so. Grabbing the silk waste-belt, called a 'mawashi', is another matter entirely! It's my sincerest hope that we never have to see a mawashi somehow cleanly removed from a wrestler's body during a match! \n"}, {"text": "What is the backless skirt called that Sumo wrestlers wear while not in the ring?", "correct": "Kesho-mawashi", "options": ["Kakusage", "Mono-ii", "Nihon-sumo-kyokai"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKesho-mawashi.\n\n\tThe mawashi portion remains on as the waste-belt worn during the match. \n"}, {"text": "Sumo wrestlers of the Yokozuna rank (the highest ranking) wear their hair in a style resembling the leaf of what plant?", "correct": "Ginko", "options": ["Perilla", "Cherry", "Lotus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGinko.\n\n\tIt's hard to describe the shape of the hair...it seems to resemble a small clam. Only two wrestlers currently enjoy this hairstyle...Musashimaru and Takanohana...due to their Yokozuna rankings. The famed Hawaiian wrestler Akebono also wore this hairstyle, but he has sadly retired from the Sumo ranks. \n"}, {"text": "The referee in a Sumo match wears a hat of very distinctive style. What is this hat called?", "correct": "Eboshi", "options": ["Jungyo", "Hatsu", "Matta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEboshi.\n\n\tThis headgear is something to behold, very elaborate...and difficult to explain. The cap is of Chinese style and translates as 'Raven-cap' in English. \n"}, {"text": "Performing a mostly ceremonial function, constantly encouraging the Sumo wrestlers to grapple, the referee of a Sumo wrestling match still plays an integral part in the spectacle. What is the Japanese term for this referee?", "correct": "Gyoji", "options": ["Ozeki", "Natsu", "Shiko"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGyoji.\n\n"}, {"text": "The referee holds a ceremonial war fan or paddle which he wields along with his dagger! By what name is the fan referred?", "correct": "Gunbai", "options": ["Haru", "Kakusage", "Tachiai"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGunbai.\n\n\tThe gunbei once held a more specific function...used to lead troops into battle...but today its use is benign. Aesthetics are of extreme concern in Sumo wrestling, but the action is very real...no WWF action here! \n"}, {"text": "The Yobidashi also performs an important ceremonial function in a sumo tournament. Yobidashis are responsible for which of the following?", "correct": "Announcing the contestants", "options": ["Judging the fitness of the wrestlers", "Caring for the wrestlers' diets", "Cleaning the wrestling ring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnnouncing the contestants.\n\n\tThe Yobidashi's stentorian shouts are critical for audience arousal, as the waits between bouts traditionally could last for an hour or more! Now the wait is normally much shorter, perhaps 15 minutes or so...in the modern world we don't like to wait! \n"}, {"text": "While preparing for a match in the ring, or Dohyo, you will notice Sumo wrestlers tossing a white substance around the ring. What is this substance?", "correct": "Salt", "options": ["Rice", "Chalk", "Flour"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalt.\n\n\tThe salt is tossed for luck...it's a ring purification ceremony. Salt was once a much more expensive commodity, so it was considered a sacrifice to toss the substance into the ring, giving us an idea of how important Sumo is to the Japanese. One source suggests that during an average Sumo Basho 90-100 pounds of salt may be tossed per day! \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is the term for a Sumo wrestling tournament?", "correct": "Basho", "options": ["Bento", "Dogan", "Eisai"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBasho.\n\n\tIt may be a tough go if you wish to purchase tickets for a Basho involving the top ranks, or Makuuchi, as Sumo is the national sport of Japan! Incidentally, in a totally unrelated piece of trivia, the poet Basho is considered by many to have been the greatest writer of the traditional Japanese poetry form Haiku! \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a ranking in the top division (Makuuchi) of Sumo wrestling?", "correct": "Juryo", "options": ["Sekiwake", "Ozeki", "Maegashira"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJuryo.\n\n\tThe rankings of Makuuchi include: Yokozuna, Ozeki, Sekiwake, Komusubi and Maegashira. The Juryo division lies just below the Makuuchi. \n"}]}
