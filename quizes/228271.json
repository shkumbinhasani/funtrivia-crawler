{"id": "228271", "name": "Hardest \"Metroid Prime\" Bosses Trivia Quiz | Metroid Prime | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Metroid Games", "Metroid Prime"], "questions": [{"text": "The Parasite Queen is the only boss fought on the Space Pirate Frigate.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Parasite Queen is your first boss of the game and she's found inside the Reactor Core of the frigate.  She's not that hard despite the fact you'll only have 100 energy and five missiles, but during the battle, she'll often be protected by a large shield.  When you find the part of the shield opens up, shoot her with all you've got, and she should be dead before you can say 'Metroid'.  This boss will shoot acid at you, but it shouldn't damage you too much. \n"}, {"text": "The Hive Mecha will be your first boss on Tallon IV.  How many times will the Hive Mecha turn before the battle is over?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["One", "Four", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThe Hive Mecha won't actually attack you.  It will, however, send Ram War Wasps at you to knock you off of your platform and into the acidic water.  When you destroy all of the War Wasps, the machine will open and shine a red light at you.  Simply shoot at this light and it will turn.  Once this light has been destroyed four times, you'll beat the Hive Mecha and claim your Missile Launcher which was destroyed on the Space Pirate Frigate.  If you go into the room behind where the Hive Mecha used to be, you'll also find an Energy Tank. \n"}, {"text": "When you fight the Incinerator Drone, what type of War Wasps are also fought?", "correct": "Barbed War Wasps", "options": ["Normal War Wasps", "Ram War Wasps", "Acid War Wasps"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarbed War Wasps.\n\n\tDuring this boss battle in the Burn Dome of the Chozo Ruins, you'll have to fight a large fire-shooting machine called the Incinerator Drone.  To destroy it, shoot it in its red 'eye' with your Power Beam.  It won't be that easy though.  When it's shot enough, it will often shoot its flames at the War Wasp Hives on the ceiling and some angry Barbed War Wasps will attack you.  Get rid of these and the Incinerator Drone, and you'll win your Morph Ball Bomb. \n"}, {"text": "How many mirrors surround Flaahgra in the Sunchamber?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Five", "Six", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tFlaahgra is your first *major* boss in the game.  To defeat it, you need to angle the mirrors surrounding the boss by shooting them (in the red spots) with your Missile Launcher or Power Beam, then by going into your Morph Ball and rolling into one of the tunnels at the base of the monster.  Then you need to bomb the monster until it's destroyed. Every time you bomb it, the monster will add another mirror to the mix.  When you've run out of mirrors and tunnels, the boss will be destroyed and you'll get the Varia Suit.  This boss' attacks include an unfriendly acid attack, a physical slash, and an attack that will create horrible plants to block your path. \n"}, {"text": "What is the adult Sheegoth's weak point?", "correct": "The face", "options": ["The back", "The legs", "The chest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe face.\n\n\tThe adult Sheegoth's attacks will be similar to the attacks of the young Sheegoths, but it has a different weak point.  Instead of shooting and destroying its back, you'll need to shoot it in the face enough.  If you shoot its back, it will simply absorb the shot.  After your first battle against one of these in the Chapel of Elders in Phendrana Drifts, you'll get the Wave Beam. \n"}, {"text": "Which weapon is needed for the battle against Thardus?", "correct": "Thermal Visor", "options": ["Super Missiles", "X-Ray Visor", "Ice Beam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThermal Visor.\n\n\tThe giant rock boss, Thardus, can be found in the Quarantine Cave of Phendrana Drifts after you get your Thermal Visor from the research labs.  During the battle, you'll need to wear the Thermal Visor and hit the weak points of Thardus' body until it can be visible without the visor, and then you must destroy it.  Keep doing this with the other weak points until he breaks into pieces and you can claim your Spider Ball.  During the battle, Thardus will often roll into a ball and roll around to attack you, and he'll shoot ice projectiles and energy that will encase you in ice. \n"}, {"text": "This boss will be quite similar to the Elite Pirate, but it's found in the Elite Research Lab, and it's infused with Phazon.  What is this boss' name?", "correct": "Phazon Elite", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhazon Elite.\n\n\tThe Phazon Elite is extremely similar to the Elite Pirate because it has many of the same attacks.  For example, its Wave Quake attack will be the same, and when its arm is outstretched and glowing, it will absorb all projectiles and attacks.  Just shoot it until its down and destroy the plasma gun in its back with the Thermal Visor.  After the battle, you can obtain a Chozo Artifact. \n"}, {"text": "What new technology do you receive after defeating the Omega Pirate?", "correct": "Phazon Suit", "options": ["Grapple Beam", "X-Ray Visor", "Power Bomb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhazon Suit.\n\n\tThe Omega Pirate's a complicated boss.  You'll need to make sure you attack it when it's attacking you or else you're unlikely to get a shot in.  During the battle, you'll be avoiding attacks like the Wave Quake, a shot from a Plasma Cannon, and a low-range physical attack.  He'll also use that attack that prevents you from getting shots in on him. How do you beat it?  Start by attacking the four Phazon plates on the Omega Pirate's limbs.  When these are destroyed, some specialized Pirates (which you've seen before) will attack you.  Dispose of these quickly, and switch to the X-Ray Visor.  Shoot him with Super Missiles as much as you can, because during this time, he'll be recharging the Phazon plates. You'll need to repeat this process until he's dead.  After the battle, he'll collapse onto you and you'll get the Phazon Suit. \n"}, {"text": "Which boss is fought in the Artifact Temple?", "correct": "Meta Ridley", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeta Ridley.\n\n\tMeta Ridley has shown up in a couple of different places, but he's not the final boss.  When you collect all of the Chozo Artifacts from around Tallon IV, you can return to the Artifact Temple and start this battle.  During the battle, Meta Ridley will fly around and you'll need to shoot him with either Super Missiles or (if you want to save those), the Plasma Beam.  When 1/5 of his health is left, his wings will burn away and you'll need to avoid his attacks on the ground.  At this point, continue using Missiles (or better yet, the Wavebuster) to get rid of the rest of his health. \n"}, {"text": "Where do you fight Metroid Prime?", "correct": "Impact Crater", "options": ["Tallon Overworld", "Phazon Mines", "Chozo Ruins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nImpact Crater.\n\n\tMetroid Prime is the final boss of the game, and to reach it, you'll need to make your way through Fission Metroids and Red Phazon.  During the battle, you'll need to fight its arachnid form through four subchambers.  You'll need to avoid beam attacks, missiles and projectiles (which can often be destroyed with a charged shot) and its ramming attack (by using the Morph Ball).  In this form, you can attack the monster by using the same coloured beam as the veins on its body (or Super Missile combos).  After this portion of the battle, you'll reach the final chamber. It will transform again (which would account for a second scan log) and you'll need to wait for it to create a puddle of Phazon. When this happens, it will occasionally release some Metroids, but they can be destroyed with a Power Bomb.  Switch to the Visor that you can see the boss with, stand in the Phazon, and shoot the creature.  Repeat this until it's dead.  In this form, all you'll need to worry about is a Wave Quake attack.  After this battle, the game is over. \n"}]}
