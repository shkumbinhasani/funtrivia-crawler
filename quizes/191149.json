{"id": "191149", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'Comrades In Arms' (Part III) Online Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "We return to episode two where we find Hawkeye and Margaret still holed-up in a shack in the Korean countryside.  After sharing breakfast they begin planning their next move, that is until another Korean soldier arrives.  This should be Hawkeye's biggest worry, but instead he seems more concerned with a term of endearment Margaret uses to address him.  What word does she use to express her newfound love for Hawkeye?\n", "correct": "Darling", "options": ["Sweetheart", "Dearest", "Honey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarling.\n\n\tAs Hawkeye limps toward the window to view the approaching soldier, Margaret suggests, 'It's all right.  Don't panic, darling.  We'll be alright.'  Hawkeye responds, 'It's a North Korean.  \"Darling\"?'  Hawkeye's tone changes from simple to extreme concern when he says 'darling'. \n"}, {"text": "When the North Korean soldier arrives in the shack, he is unable to locate Hawkeye and Margaret, but does find and take their remaining provisions.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNah, I've pulled a fast one on you again.  Margaret and Hawkeye attempt to hide under a floormat.  If that is not absurd enough, they were speaking rather loudly in the hut; loud enough that the soldier must easily have heard them.  Fortunately for the two of them (and unfortunately for the soldier), the armed North Korean passes out from a belly wound just seconds after spying them. \n"}, {"text": "While Hawkeye administers aid to the wounded Korean soldier, Margaret runs outside at the sound of a chopper.  Suddenly, we are aboard the chopper with BJ who is scanning the countryside in hopes of spotting the two missing 'M*A*S*H'ites.  BJ doesn't see Margaret directly, but he does spot the jeep that she and Hawkeye were riding in and the North Korean soldiers who have stolen it.  They fire upon the helicopter, hitting what?", "correct": "The antenna", "options": ["The pilot's leg", "The rumble seat", "The gas tank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe antenna.\n\n\tBJ spots the four North Korean soldiers rummaging through the boxes that Hawkeye and Margaret had prepared for their visit to the 8063rd.  The soldiers immediately fire upon the helicopter when it comes in range, and apparently hit the antenna, cutting off communications with an angry Colonel Potter.  Just before losing the antenna, BJ announces that they have 'found' Hawkeye and Margaret. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret and Hawkeye realize they are in danger when they hear the shots fired at the helicopter.  They must quickly leave their hut.  What is the fate of the North Korean soldier whose wounds Hawkeye has been treating?", "correct": "They leave him alive in the hut", "options": ["They take him with them on their way to the 4077th", "He dies", "He leads them out of the hut and goes his own way"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey leave him alive in the hut.\n\n\tHawkeye is able to treat the soldier's wounds superficially with some bandages, but that is all.  Margaret admires Hawkeye's bravery, but insists that they must go before they are captured by the nearby enemy soldiers.  She insists that the soldier will be located at the hut, which she terms 'Grand Central Station'. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret and Hawkeye have made their way from the hut to another location, and huddle together under a tree in the rain.  In the course of their conversation, Margaret continues to push the new relationship, while Hawkeye remains evasive.  How does Hawkeye respond when Margaret asks, 'What are we going to tell Donald?'?", "correct": "What do you usually tell him?", "options": ["We'll ask him if he thinks three's a crowd.", "We can tell him we were auditioning for the annual 4077th version of 'Romeo and Juliet', and things got carried away.", "Let's just say we were both struck with amnesia at the same moment."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhat do you usually tell him?.\n\n\tNeedless to say, Margaret is very unhappy with this response.  'What do I usually tell him?' she asks with extreme annoyance.  Margaret continues by insisting on an answer, even after Hawkeye hears someone step on a twig.  'I'm waiting for an explanation, mister!' she exclaims.  My goodness that Margaret is a fiery woman! \n"}, {"text": "After being rescued, do Margaret and Hawkeye ever reach the 8063rd, where they were intended to demonstrate an important surgical procedure?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed, they do, and the fireworks are magnificent.  Over the operating table, they perform an arterial transplant and fire off several verbal shots at each other in the process. \r 'Make sure the wound is well irrigated, nurses, or you're liable to have a doctor turn on you viciously,' says Margaret.  'Be sure to ask for the right instruments, doctors, or you're liable to get handed something you didn't expect,' Hawkeye retorts.  'Time is important here.  Whatever he asks for, give it to him immediately whether you think he can handle it or not.'  Hawkeye completes the surgery at this point and then requests that Margaret see him outside.  They trade more angry words behind the tent curtain before returning for questions.  Naturally, the staff at the 8063rd must have heard the whole thing, but that is not acknowledged. \n"}, {"text": "Back at the 4077th, Colonel Potter sits with BJ, Charles and Father Mulcahy as they have a chuckle over Margaret and Hawkeye's adventure.  Which of the four suggests that their little encounter together might have brought them into a more intimate relationship, so to speak?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Colonel Potter", "Charles", "BJ"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tWhile Potter and BJ imagine that Hawkeye and Margaret must have had a great deal of difficulty getting along together on their little adventure, Father Mulcahy suggests, 'Oh, I don't know.  Sometimes in adversity the coldest of enemies can close ranks together, joining hands, as it were, sustaining each other.'  Perhaps the good Father is just innocently speculating, but his words prompt BJ and the Colonel to change their tone.  'You think they, uh, joined hands?' Potter asks.  BJ responds, 'They may have even sustained each other.'  Charles happily adds, 'Not to mention, closing ranks.' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Margaret finally return with great fanfare to the 4077th.  After they are seated in the mess tent, they are provided with several cute gifts.  What does Klinger present to the wayward pair?", "correct": "A M*A*S*H compass", "options": ["A M*A*S*H divining rod", "A M*A*S*H clock", "A M*A*S*H flare gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA M*A*S*H compass.\n\n\tThe 'compass' is drawn on a piece of paper, with an arrow on the bottom pointing to the words 'M*A*S*H 4077th'.  Klinger recites a poem in connection to the compass. 'If from this camp you ever stray, this little compass will point the way.  Aim the arrow to where you ain't and you'll come home with no complaint.'  Cheesy, but cute. \n"}, {"text": "Father Mulcahy provides Margaret and Hawkeye with M*A*S*H 'passports'.  Inside each passport is a message which directs its finder to return the holder to the M*A*S*H 4077th where s/he will be given all but which of the following?", "correct": "A night-time story", "options": ["A kiss on the head", "Hot soup", "Clean Jammies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA night-time story.\n\n\tThe full passport note reads:\r 'This is a chief surgeon and a head nurse.  Do not give them candy or let them loose.  Please return to M*A*S*H 4077, where they will be given hot soup, clean jammies and a kiss on the head.'\r Again, cheesy but cute. \n"}, {"text": "After the festivities, during which time Hawkeye sustains a slap in the face from Margaret, the two finally level with each other about what happened the night before.  They agree that they can be friends and not to deny the intimacy of their encounter.  Finally, Margaret reads a 'very carefully worded' letter to Donald that she has composed.  What is the name of the man she has addressed the letter to?\n", "correct": "Hank", "options": ["Phil", "Stewart", "Ted"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHank.\n\n\tIn retaliation for Donald's letter to 'Darlene', Margaret cooks up this phony letter to her husband.  It reads:\r 'Dear Hank,\r I'll never forget that night we spent in that abandoned hut.  You gave me your warmth and your caring when I was afraid.  And now I think from time to time when I'm afraid again, I may have the courage to let another person know it.  You've helped me to grow a little. Thank you Hank.'\r Hawkeye responds, 'Thank you, Darlene'.\r And thank you for having tried this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
