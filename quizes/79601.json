{"id": "79601", "name": "Science and Paranoia Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Sci-Fi Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these was NOT a Universal 'Creature' film?", "correct": "Creature of Destruction", "options": ["Revenge of the Creature", "The Creature Walks Among Us", "Creature From the Black Lagoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreature of Destruction.\n\n\t'Creature of Destruction' is a godawful remake of Corman's 'The She Creature'. \n"}, {"text": "What is the sequel to 'The Amazing Colossal Man'?", "correct": "War of the Colossal Beast", "options": ["The Colossus of New York", "Return of the Colossal Man", "The Giant Behemoth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWar of the Colossal Beast.\n\n"}, {"text": "Which film does NOT involve people who aren't really people, but aliens (in other words, aliens take over the humans' bodies.)?", "correct": "Invasion of the Saucer Men", "options": ["Invasion of the Body Snatchers", "It Conquered the World", "Invaders From Mars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInvasion of the Saucer Men.\n\n"}, {"text": "Which film involves an underground research lab controlled by a computerized brain that gets taken over by an unseen force and slowly kills the analysts in macabre ways as they conduct their experiments?", "correct": "Gog", "options": ["Day of the Triffids", "The Brain from Planet Arous", "The Brain That Wouldn't Die"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGog.\n\n\tThis gets my award for the most underated film of the genre. The title refers to one of two robots, Gog and Magog, who go on a violent spree after scientists lose control of the central brain. Much better than it sounds. A true gem! \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is NOT a real film?", "correct": "Attack of the Spiders", "options": ["Attack of the Giant Leeches", "Attack of the Crab Monsters", "The Giant Gila Monster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttack of the Spiders.\n\n\tThere have been several films about giant arachnids, including 'Earth vs. The Spider' and 'Tarantula'. \n"}, {"text": "In the late fifties, Japan came out with a film called 'Gigantis, the Fire Monster'. Who was Gigantis really?", "correct": "Godzilla", "options": ["Ghidorah", "Gamerra", "Mothra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGodzilla.\n\n\tFor certain reasons, the distributors were not allowed to use the name Godzilla for this one. Apparently they did not want people to flock to any further Godzilla films which were being released by another distributor. \n"}, {"text": "In the early sixties, the Danes got involved in horror-scifi. What is the name of the giant Danish monster who goes on a killing rampage?", "correct": "Reptilicus", "options": ["Gorgo", "Gappa, the Triphibian Monster", "Manda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReptilicus.\n\n\tGorgo was a British monster. The other two are Japanese. \n"}, {"text": "The Danes also produced a space picture during this time. What was it?", "correct": "Journey to the Seventh Planet", "options": ["Destination Moon", "First Spaceship On Venus", "Rocketship SM"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJourney to the Seventh Planet.\n\n\tThis is again one of my favorites of the genre. Danish astronauts (I know, stop laughing) land on Uranus which is under control of a creature who reads their thoughts and creates images of their pasts. Again, better than it sounds. \n"}, {"text": "The British came up with three films based on the scientist Quatermaas who battles aliens.
