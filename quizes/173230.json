{"id": "173230", "name": "Christ in the Movies Quiz | Something in Common | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Spirituality in Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Claude Heater portrayed the Christ in the 1959 epic film 'Ben Hur'.  The interesting thing is that during the film we never see his face, he is only shown from behind.  Does he have any spoken lines?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIndeed, not.  In fact, though Heater appears at several different points in the film, he is not even credited with the role of Christ.  The subtitle of the film 'Ben Hur' was 'A Tale of the Christ'. \n"}, {"text": "Monty Python created a very controversial comedic look at the age of Christ in their 1979 film 'Life of Brian'.  Christ appears at a certain point in the film; portrayed by actor Kenneth Colley.  Does he have a speaking role in the film?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed, one of the early scenes depicts Christ speaking at the Sermon on the Mount.  Some of his words (for example 'peacemakers') are mistakenly misheard by various distant onlookers.  'Life of Brian', which was produced by ex-Beatle George Harrison, it was initially banned in several countries, including Norway and Ireland.  Perhaps those countries have something against cheesemakers? \n"}, {"text": "Cameron Mitchell portrayed the voice of Jesus Christ in which 1953 epic drama featuring Richard Burton as a Roman tribune named Marcellus Gallio and Jean Simmons as his love interest Diana?", "correct": "The Robe", "options": ["Barabbas", "New Testament", "Second Coming"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Robe.\n\n\tDonald C. Klune played the physical Christ role in the film (again, uncredited).  Mitchell was also uncredited as Christ's voice.  Other than being a relatively uninspiring epic film, 'The Robe' was the first film to be released using the new 'CinemaScope' technology. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1971 film 'Johnny Got His Gun', Christ is portrayed in a dream sequence by which actor who also appeared in the film 'M*A*S*H'?", "correct": "Donald Sutherland", "options": ["Robert Duvall", "Tom Skerritt", "Elliot Gould"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDonald Sutherland.\n\n\tSutherland played a train engineer cum Jesus in this 1971 film written and directed by Dalton Trumbo, a member of the Hollywood Ten.  This film was the basis for the music group Metallica's greatest hit 'One'. \n"}, {"text": "Nicholas Ray directed which 1961 film, starring the youthful Jeffrey Hunter as the Christ and Siobhan McKenna as Mary, one of the last of the Biblical epics of the golden age of Hollywood?", "correct": "King of Kings", "options": ["The Crowning Gift", "Jesus of Nazareth", "Mary Magdalene"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKing of Kings.\n\n\tThis film was interesting in that the dialogue was written by an uncredited Ray Bradbury, and the narration was done by Orson Welles.  Some film fans dubbed this film 'I Was a Teenage Jesus' (following titles such as 'I Was a Teenage Werewolf') because Hunter appeared to be so youthful in the Christ role. \n"}, {"text": "'Jesus Christ Superstar' has certainly been a stage favorite for theater lovers, and in 1973 the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice collaboration was translated to film by which director?", "correct": "Norman Jewison", "options": ["Sidney Lumet", "Bob Fosse", "Clint Eastwood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorman Jewison.\n\n\tThe film version of this rock-n-roll musical features Ted Neeley as Christ and Carl Anderson as Judas Iscariot.  Perhaps not the greatest film of all-time, at the very least, however, the music is good. \n"}, {"text": "In which film by comedic master Mel Brooks does a scene briefly include Jesus (played by John Hurt)?", "correct": "History of the World, Part I", "options": ["The Producers", "Life Stinks", "Blazing Saddles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHistory of the World, Part I.\n\n\tAgain, Orson Welles narrates a film featuring Jesus (albeit in a much less prominent role).  Jesus' role in this film is confined to responding to Comicus (played by Brooks) who shouts 'Jesus!'  This irregularly funny film also features Gregory Hines, Dom DeLuise and Madeline Kahn, among other all-stars.  This is probably not the most inspirational movie featuring Jesus...except in the inspiration of laughter. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most fascinating and controversial portrayals of Christ was in Martin Scorcese's 1988 epic 'The Last Temptation of Christ'.  Who marvelously portrays Jesus Christ in this provocative work?", "correct": "Willem Dafoe", "options": ["Aidan Quinn", "Harvey Keitel", "William Hurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWillem Dafoe.\n\n\tBased on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, this film provoked an incredibly excited response from filmgoers, including some who protested by slashing movie screens.  Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Christ is interesting to behold, as is Barbara Hershey's version of Mary Magdalene and Harvey Keitel's Judas.  The film is certainly worth a look. \n"}, {"text": "Which esteemed actor portrayed Christ in the 1965 drama 'The Greatest Story Ever Told'?", "correct": "Max von Sydow", "options": ["George Peppard", "Robert Redford", "Jos\u00e9 Ferrer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMax von Sydow.\n\n\tMax von Sydow has the special distinction of having portrayed both Christ and the Devil (aka Leland Guant in 'Needful Things').  'The Greatest Story Ever Told' probably had the most incredible all-star cast in film history.  The cast included: Jos\u00e9 Ferrer, Pat Boone, Charlton Heston, Angela Lansbury, Martin Landau, Sal Mineo, Roddy McDowell, Jamie Farr, Robert Blake, Shelly Winters, John Wayne, Sidney Poitier, Claude Rains, Donald Pleasence and Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate (he first shaved his head for this film.) \n"}, {"text": "Hmm...I can't resist the temptation to ask a question about 'The Passion', so here goes: In Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ', which of the following ancient languages is not employed by the actors involved?", "correct": "Greek", "options": ["Latin", "Hebrew", "Aramaic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreek.\n\n\tThis was perhaps one of Mel's mistakes, as the Roman soldiers manning the eastern realm during the time would have been speaking Greek amongst themselves.  He also has Christ, played by James Caviezel, utter Latin at one point.  There's no evidence that Christ spoke Latin.  Regardless, the film is so provocative that no filmgoer should resist for too long a chance to see it, whether a true believer or not.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other quizzes. \n"}]}
