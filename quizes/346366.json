{"id": "346366", "name": "\"I Can Burp My ABC's!\" Trivia Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies L-P", "Over the Hedge"], "questions": [{"text": "Who voices Hammy from \"Over the Hedge\"?", "correct": "Steve Carell", "options": ["Will Ferrell", "Jim Carrey", "William Shatner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve Carell.\n\n\tSteve Carell (born 1962) is an American comedic actor, known for his roles in \"The Office\", \"Get Smart\", \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\", and \"Evan Almighty\".  He also voices Hammy from the Dreamworks film \"Over the Hedge\". \n"}, {"text": "What kind of animal is Hammy?", "correct": "Squirrel", "options": ["Raccoon", "Hamster", "Turtle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSquirrel.\n\n\tHammy is the squirrel from \"Over the Hedge\".  The main animal character, RJ, is a raccoon, and Verne is a turtle.  Even though Hammy does not play as important of a role as other animals in the film, he is one of the most loved of them all. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Over the Hedge\", Hammy is constantly trying to find something.  What is it?", "correct": "His nuts", "options": ["His mother", "His shell", "His girlfriend"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis nuts.\n\n\tHammy always trying to find his nuts is a play on Scrat from the \"Ice Age\" films.  In \"Over the Hedge\", Hammy is always trying to find his nuts, just like Scrat; but Hammy is not as unfortunate as Scrat while searching. \n"}, {"text": "What does Hammy name the hedge?", "correct": "Steve", "options": ["Billy", "Sonic the Hedge", "Jim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve.\n\n\tWhen the animals first see the hedge, they are frightened by it.  They don't know what it is, or what might be on the other side.  Hammy blazes back and forth, unable to find where the hedge ends.  He decides to name the hedge Steve, so it would be less scary. \n"}, {"text": "To get Hammy to go somewhere, what is thrown for him to follow?\n\nHINT: This object gets him on the roof.", "correct": "Cookie", "options": ["Cake", "Pie", "Pistachios"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCookie.\n\n\t\"But I like the cookie.\"  Hammy is always wanting cookies, and whenever he does not get one, he gets very sad.  Cookies are used to lure him, though.  To get him to accomplish a mission, a cookie is thrown on the roof so he would go get it.  Poor Hammy, though, is used as a guinea pig to test for animal traps. \n"}, {"text": "Hammy likes to drink coffee, but he shouldn't drink it.  What does Verne do with the coffee before ever giving Hammy some?", "correct": "He serves him de-caf.", "options": ["He uses really old coffee grounds.", "He serves him tea instead.", "He sweetens it with Splenda instead of sugar."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe serves him de-caf.\n\n\tHorrible things happen when Hammy has caffeine.  To avoid any harmful side effects (for others, not for Hammy), Verne serves him de-caffeinated coffee without telling him. \n"}, {"text": "Near the end of the film, RJ gives Hammy a drink that is dangerous for Hammy to drink, but it ends up being the animals' saving grace.  What is the drink?", "correct": "Soda", "options": ["Rockstar Energy Drink", "Caramel Macchiato", "Pina Colada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSoda.\n\n\tHammy should never, ever, ever, ever have caffeine.  Hammy is a very hyper squirrel, which gets him into a lot of trouble.  If he were to drink a soda, he would become super-hyper, and who knows what terrible things would happen?  None of the animals ever dared to find out, until RJ decides it was their only hope. \n"}, {"text": "After finishing his beverage that RJ gives him, Hammy becomes more hyper than he had ever been before.  He becomes so hyper, in fact, that what happens?", "correct": "Time freezes", "options": ["His eyeballs pop out", "He passes out", "He never sleeps again"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTime freezes.\n\n\tAfter drinking an entire can of soda, Hammy becomes more hyper than he had ever been before.  He could already run and talk extremely fast.  However, upon finishing his soda, he becomes faster than time itself.  The movie shows us what happens in the scenes following his drinking of the soda from his point of view.  He becomes so incredibly fast that he is actually able to take a leisurely stroll through the now-stopped time.  He accomplishes his mission, and even grabs a cookie. \n"}, {"text": "According to Hammy, these animals are not vicious.  In fact, they are cute and cuddly.  What animal does Hammy describe because of mishearing another word spoken?", "correct": "Rabbit", "options": ["Cat", "Puppy", "Hedgehog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRabbit.\n\n\tRJ asks Hammy to pretend to be a vicious rabid squirrel during a scene in the movie.  Hammy, confused, explains to RJ that rabbits are not vicious, but cute and cuddly.  RJ tells him it was \"rabid\", not \"rabbit\", but poor little Hammy does not understand. \n"}, {"text": "When laying out a plan of attack for the animals, RJ uses Monopoly pieces.  Which piece does Hammy want to be?", "correct": "Car", "options": ["Dog", "Shoe", "Iron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCar.\n\n\tWhen RJ first pulls out the pieces, Hammy is the first to speak up to ask if he could be the car.  This creats quite an argument amongst the younger ones (and Hammy) about who would be the car.  RJ, growing frustrated, tells them that it doesn't matter who is the car.  Of course, RJ takes the car, because, as he said, he is ALWAYS the car. \n"}]}
