What number has Ben Hur been assigned?", "correct": "41", "options": ["9", "67", "23"], "explanation": "\n\n\n41.\n\n\tWe discover that Ben Hur has been on this particular ship for a month, and that he has served as a rower for three years on other ships, an extraordinarily long time it seems. \n"}, {"text": "According to Quintus Arrius, the new consul and Commander of the Roman fleet, what specific emotion keeps a man alive?", "correct": "Hate", "options": ["Fear", "Anger", "Revenge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHate.\n\n\tQuintus Arrius tests Ben Hur by whipping his back.  Ben Hur immediately turns toward Quintus Arrius, but does not attempt to fight back.  According to Quintus Arrius, Ben Hur's 'eyes are full of hate'.  This is good, according to the consul, as 'hate keeps a man alive'. \n"}, {"text": "Finish this key quote from Quintus Arrius: 'Now, listen to me, all of you.  You are all condemned men!  We keep you alive to serve this ship. So, _______________'", "correct": "Row well, and live!", "options": ["Serve the ship and strike your oars!", "Preserve your energy for the final battle!", "Concentrate on preserving your life, and row!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRow well, and live!.\n\n\tI think this could possibly be the most memorable line from the film, it's so simple and yet encapsulates Ben Hur's life for over three years in the Roman galley.  Quintus Arrius is a ruthless but reasonable cog in the Roman machine. \n"}, {"text": "Quintus Arrius tests the mettle of his rowers by putting them through a rigorous regimen of rowing speeds.  What is the top rowing speed for this ship?", "correct": "Ramming speed", "options": ["Attack speed", "Battle speed", "Torpedo speed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRamming speed.\n\n\tThe order of speeds that he commands are: battle speed, attack speed and ramming speed, respectively.  Torpedo speed is a figment of my imagination, but it sounds wonderful, doesn't it?  We later discover that the rowing sequence was all a test to see if Ben Hur is as resilient as he seems. \n"}, {"text": "Quintus Arrius summons Ben Hur from the lower decks in order to offer him his freedom.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, Quintus Arrius wants to see if Ben Hur has interest in becoming a gladiator in the Roman arena.  Naturally, this would not include Ben Hur's freedom; he would continue to be a slave, owned personally by the Roman consul.  Ben Hur turns down the offer. \n"}, {"text": "The galley in which Ben Hur rows enters into battle with pirates.  The ship is destroyed, but Ben Hur is able to escape.  How is Ben Hur able to evade the chains?", "correct": "Quintus Arrius orders his chain unlocked", "options": ["Ben Hur breaks his chain using his oar", "Ben Hur's chain is broken loose by a ramming ship", "Ben Hur steals the keys from a guard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuintus Arrius orders his chain unlocked.\n\n\tQuintus Arrius apparently admires Ben Hur's faith and steadfastness, and hence orders his chain to be released.  When the ship is rammed, he is easily able to escape, and in the meantime he helps several other prisoners escape their bonds by killing the guard and taking his keys. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur manages to escape the burning ship, and saves Quintus Arrius.  They float away on a tiny raft, and are later discovered by a Roman ship.  Quintus Arrius is informed that the Romans have won a smashing victory in the naval battle.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Roman fleet only lost five galleys...the battle was a complete victory for Quintus Arrius.  The consul turns to Ben Hur after receiving the news and states, 'In his eagerness to save you, your God has also saved the Roman fleet!' \n"}, {"text": "During his triumphant return to Rome, Quintus Arrius is honored by the emperor himself, played by George Relph.  Which Roman emperor does Relph portray in the film 'Ben Hur'?", "correct": "Tiberius", "options": ["Claudius", "Augustus", "Nero"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTiberius.\n\n\tTiberius honors Quintus Arrius with a baton of victory.  The Emperor then asks about Ben Hur, the savior of his victorious naval commander.  The following day Tiberius officially bestows Ben Hur as a slave to Quintus Arrius. \n"}, {"text": "Quintus Arrius keeps Ben Hur as a slave for some months.  Later, he adopts Ben Hur as his own son.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, Ben Hur becomes 'Young Arrius', the son and heir to the fortune of Quintus Arrius.  Prior to this, Ben Hur had victoriously rode the chariot of Quintus Arrius in the Roman circus five times. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur will soon return to Judaea to locate his mother and sister.  Who is to become the new Roman governor of Judaea, replacing Gratus?", "correct": "Pontius Pilate", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPontius Pilate.\n\n\tPontius Pilate is portrayed quite marvelously by Frank Thring in this film.  Of course, Pilate was the actual governor of Judaea during this time, and is said to have ordered the execution of Christ.  Thank you for playing this quiz.
