{"id": "244541", "name": "\"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\" 2 Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "After you complete ther Goron Mines, who owns the shop where you can purchase the Hawkeye?", "correct": "Malo", "options": ["Beth", "Luda", "Rusl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMalo.\n\n\tMalo, the youngest Ordonian, takes over the abandoned shop in the Village and sells you some useful items (even before you venture to the Goron Mines).  The Hawkeye is not necessary if you want to complete the game, but it's a handy tool that allows you to gain better sight when using your newly acquired Hero's Bow.  Put it to good use immediately and complete a mini-game in Kakariko Village for a Piece of Heart! \n"}, {"text": "After the Goron Mines, you continue north.  What is the name of the province containing Zora's Domain and Lake Hylia?", "correct": "Lanayru", "options": ["Ordon", "Eldin", "Peak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLanayru.\n\n\tThe Lanayru Province covers most of the northern areas of Hyrule and it contains the third dungeon of the game among other things.  After leaving Eldin Province via the Bridge of Eldin, you'll be trapped here as a wolf, forced to make your way around Hyrule following Ilia's Scent.  Lanayru Province includes Lake Hylia, the rivers around it, and Zora's Domain.  It's easily one of the larger provinces. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Ilia's Scent lead to?", "correct": "Telma's Bar", "options": ["Doctor Borville's Office", "Hyrule Castle's Tower", "Southern Hyrule Field"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelma's Bar.\n\n\tAs you continue to the eastern end of Hyrule Field, the scent will lead you to Telma's Bar in Hyrule Castle Town.  Here, you can find Ilia, but because of the twilight, she won't be able to see you.  After this, if you continue to the Great Hylian Bridge, you will be forced off of it.  By jumping off the side into Lake Hylia, you will survive a terrible fate. Of course, once you arrive at Lanayru's spring, you'll be forced to fill another Vessel of Light, but still, it'll get you one step closer to the third dungeon.  To find the Twilit Parasites involved, you'll need to scour Lake Hylia, a large cavern system, Zora's River, and Zora's Domain. \n"}, {"text": "To melt the ice in Zora's Domain, where must you collect a rather large, hot rock?", "correct": "Death Mountain", "options": ["Faron Woods", "Ordon Village", "Lake Hylia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeath Mountain.\n\n\tWhen you arrive at Zora's Domain, it'll be covered in ice.  Make your way to the Zora throne room and claim your teleportation rights, then warp to Death Mountain to pick up a flaming rock.  This will basically destroy the ice in Zora's Domain and it'll allow you to finish the quest for the Twilit Bloat, a large creature in Lake Hylia. This thing is a rather odd boss because it's larger than your normal Twilit Parasites.  Once it's defeated though, you'll be able to restore Lanyaru Province and Hyrule Castle Town to normality.  Of course, you still won't be able to reach the third dungeon just yet. \n"}, {"text": "Before accessing the Water Temple, you must escort Prince Ralis to which destination?", "correct": "Kakariko Village", "options": ["Ordon Village", "Hyrule Castle Town", "Zora's Domain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKakariko Village.\n\n\tThe next step on the quest for dungeon #3 is returning to Hyrule Castle Town to Ilia, Telma, and the sickened Prince Ralis and escorting them along the southern half of Hyrule Field to Kakariko Village.  This process is quite intense as you will need to fight the King Bulblin once again on the Great Hylian Bridge and through the southern portion of the field.  When the caravan reaches Kakariko Village, Prince Ralis will get better in the care of Renado, and Rutela will give you on the way to the Zora Armor within Kakariko Graveyard. \n"}, {"text": "What weapon is found within Lakebed Temple?", "correct": "Clawshot", "options": ["Water Bombs", "Hero's Bow", "Zora Armor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClawshot.\n\n\tOnce you claim the Water Bombs from Barnes in Kakariko Village, you'll be ready to enter the Lakebed Temple, so dive into Lake Hylia, blast away, and swim on in.  This temple is home to many waterlogged caverns as well as one large room with levers that will shift water throughout the temple.  Once two reservoir towers have been opened, you will be able to head into the boss room containing the Twilit Aquatic Morpheel. Use your Clawshot to the best of your ability and keep the Zora Armor nearby to secure a win.  After the battle, Midna will take you to Lanyaru's spring...where Zant is waiting. \n"}, {"text": "In order to reach Zelda in Hyrule Castle, you need to find a secret entranceway.  Who must you meet along the way to access it?", "correct": "Jovani", "options": ["Agatha", "Telma", "Renato"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJovani.\n\n\tAfter the third dungeon, you need to meet with Zelda, as you now have all three Fused Shadow pieces.  To do this, transform into a wolf and head to Hyrule Castle Town.  Once you reach Telma's Bar, Louise the cat will assist you in reaching the upper half of the bar and the rafters.  This path will take you into Jovani's house-turned-pile-of-treasure. Jovani will introduce himself and plea that you capture the souls of sixty Poes around Hyrule to free himself and his cat, Gengle.  After this, a secret entrance will let you into the castle and Zelda will give up her remaining powers to give strength to Midna and Link. \n"}, {"text": "Where is the Master Sword obtained?", "correct": "Sacred Grove", "options": ["Gerudo Mesa", "Hyrule Castle", "Ordon Village"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSacred Grove.\n\n\tAfter speaking with Zelda, you will need to proceed to the entrance of the Forest Temple where a monkey will lead the way to the entrance of the Sacred Woods.  Once there, you will need to chase the elusive Skull Kid around the winding paths of the forest, often retracing your steps along the way.  All the while, you'll be pursued by odd puppets that will drop from the trees to attack you. After a battle with the Skull Kid in a clearing, you'll continue to the Sacred Grove where you will need to complete a puzzle set by the guardians of the Master Sword in order to claim the ultimate prize amongst the ruins of the Temple of Time. \n"}, {"text": "Who will be able to send you to Gerudo Mesa?", "correct": "Fyer", "options": ["Rutela", "Darbus", "Telma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFyer.\n\n\tWhen you're ready to continue the quest (and why would you yet?  You have tons of Poes to defeat!) you can head to Telma's Bar and be directed to a man named Auru standing atop a pinnacle overlooking Lake Hylia.  This man will hear of your journey and give you a non-stop ticket for a flight to Gerudo Mesa to the east.  The only catch: your flight will be provided by Fyer and his cannon in the middle of Lake Hylia.  Once you make your landing, regain your composure and begin slicing your way through Moldorms to the Arbiter's Grounds. \n"}, {"text": "What object is acquired in the Arbiter's Grounds?", "correct": "Spinner", "options": ["Magic Armor", "Clawshot", "Gale Boomerang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpinner.\n\n\tWhen you reach the Death Sword in the Arbiter's Grounds, you will be able to duel the mini-boss for your newest item, the Spinner, which will allow you to float over large (possibly dangerous areas) and follow pre-made tracks along walls and rock faces.  This dungeon is rather large and spacious what with its uninhabited rooms and cathedral-like ceilings, but don't get too comfortable!  You'll need to make your way to the very end at the top of the dungeon where the evil Stallord awaits your arrival. Zant will bring power to the beast and you'll need to make use of your Spinner (and your new sword).  Simply disalign the creature's spine and you'll make short work of it.  For the second portion of the battle, Stallord's head will cause trouble. Once again jump on the Spinner, jump up the new tower that has formed in the arena, avoid obstacles, and leap at the creature when the time is right.  After the battle, you'll ascend once more and reach the Mirror Chamber, where the rest of your journey will unfold. \n"}]}
