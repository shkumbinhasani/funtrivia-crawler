{"id": "168085", "name": "Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman) in Film Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed L-R", "R - People Themed"], "questions": [{"text": "One of Paul Reuben's first film rolls was a bit part as a waiter in which of these wonderful comedies?", "correct": "The Blues Brothers", "options": ["Ghostbusters", "Animal House", "Stripes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blues Brothers.\n\n\tReuben's has a brief moment in the film 'The Blues Brothers' where he plays a waiter at the Chez Paul Restaurant.  He brings the Blues Brothers a bottle of the restaurants finest champagne, a Dom P\u00e9rignon.  Even in this tiny role, which was his first in a major film, I chuckled a bit! \n"}, {"text": "Paul Reubens makes his first appearance as Pee Wee Herman in which Cheech & Chong movie?", "correct": "Cheech & Chong's Next Movie", "options": ["Up in Smoke", "Nice Dreams", "Still Smokin'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheech & Chong's Next Movie.\n\n\tIn the 1980 film 'Cheech & Chong's Next Movie', we first see Paul Reuben's credited as Pee Wee Herman (a desk clerk).  This was not the first time he played Pee Wee, of course.  He had been doing the character in a night club act for years (alongside his writing partner and fellow 'Groundling', Phil Hartman). \n"}, {"text": "Paul Reubens appeared in the early 1980s classic comedy 'Meatballs'.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSadly, he didn't appear in the original 'Meatballs', which starred Bill Murray, but rather in the atrocious sequel 'Meatballs Part II' as Albert/Hara Krishna'.  Bill Murray did not reprise his roll in the second film, and hence it was not worth watching (unless you are a true Pee Wee Herman fan!) \n"}, {"text": "Paul Reubens hit the big time with his character Pee Wee Herman in the 1985 film 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure'.  This film marked the feature-length directing debut of Tim Burton.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, prior to 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure', Burton was making short, mostly animated films for Disney.  After seeing Burton's 27-minute 'Frankenweenie', he selected Burton to direct his coming out party for the character Pee Wee Herman.  It was a match made in heaven. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these famous 'Saturday Night Live' alumni co-wrote the movie 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' with Paul Reubens?", "correct": "Phil Hartman", "options": ["Adam Sandler", "Martin Short", "Dana Carvey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhil Hartman.\n\n\tPhil Hartman, who went on to a brilliant career on 'Saturday Night Live' that spanned from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, was, as I have mentioned, a co-writer of most of Reuben's Pee Wee character sketches.  Another 'Saturday Night Live' player, Jan Hooks, also makes an appearance in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Who wrote the wonderfully quirky musical score for the Paul Reuben's vehicle 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure'?", "correct": "Danny Elfman", "options": ["Howard Blake", "John Scott", "James Horner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDanny Elfman.\n\n\tCan you imagine anyone else working on this film than Danny Elfman?  He teamed with Tim Burton on every later film Burton produced.  Elfman's score fits well with Pee Wee's enigmatic behavior, very unpredictable, rhythmic and eccentric to the maximum degree! \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the 1987 Franky Avalon/Annette Funicello redux beach film in which Paul Reubens once again reprised his Pee Wee role?", "correct": "Back to the Beach", "options": ["Return of Beach Blanket Bingo", "1980s Muscle Beach Party", "Bikini Beach Rides Again"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBack to the Beach.\n\n\tPerhaps hoping to capitalize on the Pee Wee wave, or more likely an attempt by Paul Reubens to keep his character current, the film 'Back to the Beach' was pretty much a failure for all involved.  Sadly, Annette Funicello was diagnosed with MS just following filming. \n"}, {"text": "What was the ill-fated 1988 sequel to 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' called?", "correct": "Big-Top Pee Wee", "options": ["Pee Wee's Second Adventure", "Travels with Pee Wee", "Pee Wee in Europe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig-Top Pee Wee.\n\n\tIt's very likely that this film failed because it was not co-written by Paul Reuben's regular writing partner Phil Hartman.  It's also possible that the character simply became too pass\u00e9 for film.  It was produced right at the height of Reuben's television success with his 'Pee Wee's Playhouse', so no real damage was done to his career, despite the failure of the sequel. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite Paul Reuben's roles came in 1999, when he played which (body) part in the film 'Mystery Men'?", "correct": "The Spleen", "options": ["The Pancreas", "The Kidney", "The Bladder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Spleen.\n\n\tNot having been seen much in Hollywood since his arrest in 1991 for public indecency, Reubens began to make a comeback in the late 1990s with roles in films such as 'Mystery Men', 'Matilda' and 'Doctor Dolittle' (voice only).  The Pee Wee character was dead, but Reubens appeared to survive another day. \n"}, {"text": "Paul Reubens took a chance with a serious film role, co-starring alongside Johnny Depp and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz in which 2001 film?", "correct": "Blow", "options": ["From Hell", "Traffic", "Chocolat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlow.\n\n\tReubens portrayed Derek Foreal, a drug dealer and friend of the main character, George Jung, played by Johnny Depp.  From 2001 to 2004, Reubens had not been featured in any other films, once again finding himself in trouble with the law.  Fans of his acting have only the memories of his career to enjoy.  Thank you for trying this quiz, if you enjoyed it, please feel free to try some of my other quizzes. \n"}]}
