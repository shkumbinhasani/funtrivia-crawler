But who was he trying to help, and how did it go so bloodily wrong? Let's keep watching ... \n"}, {"text": "We cut to a flash back: \"one year ago\" on a beach. We're meeting the real Sierra, the person she was before she became a Doll; her name is Priya. What is Priya's vocation?", "correct": "Artist", "options": ["Body-builder", "Musician", "Marine biologist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArtist.\n\n\tShe's selling her wares on the boardwalk: \"I need the cash,\" she says, \"and I don't have a work visa.\" An admirer has been buying up a lot of her work; he seems to be fond of her, but isn't her type. He offers to commission a large painting from her, maybe even \"arrange a show\" -- but something about him makes Priya uneasy. \n"}, {"text": "Now we're in a flashback of Priya's big break, a fancy party that her admirer -- Nolan -- is throwing for her. He's more interested in her than in her work, and the Rossum Corporation, which apparently owes him a favor or two, is helping with his courtship. What does Rossum bring to the party?", "correct": "At least two Dolls -- Echo and Victor -- to make Nolan's story more plausible", "options": ["A magnificent venue overlooking the water", "A fancy pharmaceutical cocktail to lower Priya's inhibitions", "The body of a handsome Doll for Nolan's personality to use during the courtship"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt least two Dolls -- Echo and Victor -- to make Nolan's story more plausible.\n\n\t\"This is an elaborate, expensive seduction, Nolan,\" a Rossum exec (Matthew Harding, played by Keith Carradine) tells a besotted Nolan Kinnard (Vincent Ventresca) at the party, a show for Priya's art. \"It's the least Rossum can do after all your work with us, but can't you just buy her a necklace or a boat or something?\" But Nolan's tried that, and it doesn't seem to work on Priya -- at least, not from him.\r So now he's trying an elaborate con, luring her into his life with the promise of helping her find artistic success. Echo is there as a young woman singing Nolan's praises as a patron of art: \"You should stick with Nolan. He finds an artist, they thrive.\" Victor is there as a charming Italian art dealer for added verisimilitude. But will she take this carefully designed bait? \n"}, {"text": "The party ends badly: Nolan tries to keep Priya from leaving, and she slaps him and tells him she could never love him. But now it's the present day, Priya has been turned into a Doll code-named Sierra, and she's standing at Nolan's door and kissing him. What keepsake does he take to remind himself of this visit?", "correct": "An instant photograph of her", "options": ["A flower from her hair", "A lock of her hair", "A lipstick imprint on his cheek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn instant photograph of her.\n\n\tAt the beginning of the episode, we could think of Nolan as a decent but socially inept man -- but as the unusually long teaser unfolds, he becomes creepier and creepier. He tries to physically block her from leaving the party, making the ugly argument that, because he bought her painting, he is entitled to her affection. Priya, whom I'm liking more and more, tells him in no uncertain terms what she thinks of him.\r But now it's the present, and she's a Doll with affections programmed for him. As she leaves, he takes her picture and tosses it in a drawer with hundreds of similar ones -- presumably from other romantic encounters with Priya's body but not with Priya. She has different hairstyles, different expressions: he has literally erased the woman he claimed to love. \n"}, {"text": "In the Dollhouse, Sierra -- the former Priya -- smears black on her watercolor paintings, worrying the other Dolls. Topher starts investigating. Why does he say Priya came to the Dollhouse in the first place?", "correct": "She was a paranoid schizophrenic.", "options": ["She freely volunteered after hearing about it from a friend.", "She had attacked Nolan in his car.", "She was desperate with grief."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe was a paranoid schizophrenic.\n\n\tLater, in a flashback, we see Priya in her paranoid schizophrenic state. She had all the symptoms, right down to believing that it was the medications that were making her crazy -- but Topher now comes to realize that she was right all along. Nolan, a doctor and medical researcher specializing in \"molecular pharmacology,\" poisoned her and committed her to a mental institution, then let the Dollhouse believe they were doing her a service when they wiped her mind blank for his pleasure. Even the generally amoral Topher is sick at heart when he realizes how they've all been used. \n"}, {"text": "When Adelle learns of Nolan's crimes against Priya/Sierra, she summons him to tell him he's blacklisted. \"I would no sooner allow you near one of our ... Actives than I would a mad dog near a child,\" she says, \"given that you're a raping scumbag one tick shy of a murderer.\" But soon she's arranging one last engagement for him. Why?", "correct": "She is threatened by her superiors at the Rossum Corporation.", "options": ["He bribes her.", "He persuades her that his crimes weren't that bad.", "He threatens to have a Doll killed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe is threatened by her superiors at the Rossum Corporation.\n\n\tAdelle is horrified by Nolan's arrangement: she accuses him of having made her \"an accomplice in something vile.\" But he won't accept her refusal, and makes a counter-offer: \"You're going to imprint her, and you're going to send her to me. Forever... You do it by the end of business today, I'll see to it you keep your job.\"\r And, as it turns out, Nolan's right. Harding, the Rossum executive we saw at the art opening, tells Adelle that they'll do whatever it takes to keep Nolan happy. He reminds her of her own indiscretions as \"Miss Lonelyhearts,\" and explodes her comfortable fiction that the Dollhouse is \"decent and moral,\" a humanitarian organization. If she won't do as Rossum demands, she can be replaced -- and he promises she \"wouldn't like the early retirement plan.\" Backed into a corner, Adelle agrees. \n"}, {"text": "Ordered to imprint Sierra, permanently, and send her off to Nolan, Topher struggles with his new-found conscience. What does he end up doing?", "correct": "He imprints her as Priya -- her original personality.", "options": ["He resigns.", "He imprints her as the besotted woman Nolan wants.", "He imprints her as an assassin."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe imprints her as Priya -- her original personality.\n\n\tEveryone thinks of Topher as completely amoral, but deep down, there are lines he will not cross. Being an accessory to slavery this clear-cut? It turns out that's one of them. So he restores Sierra to her original personality, the one Nolan systematically stole from her. It's unclear what he expects Priya to do -- have some possibility of escape, perhaps -- but he feels it's his only choice. \n"}, {"text": "Sierra is at Nolan's apartment for an engagement that's supposed to last the rest of her life -- and she's on to him. She taunts him, telling him she's in love with someone else -- Victor. He hits her. They fight. What happens next?", "correct": "She kills him.", "options": ["They kiss, passionately.", "He kills her.", "The police arrive with Senator Perrin."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe kills him.\n\n\tSierra is Priya when she arrives at the apartment, and she knows what's happened to her. She doesn't remember her time as a Doll, but she does remember Victor, or at least her love for him. Nolan punches her in the face when she says so, and she hits him back, asking, \"You gonna fight fair this time?\"\r He isn't planning on it; he fights dirty, and seems to relish the idea of hurting her. But in the end, she gets his knife, and she stabs him to death. In related news, the world is a better place. \n"}, {"text": "At the Dollhouse, Topher realizes that something has gone wrong. He goes to Nolan's apartment to help -- but he isn't equipped for the situation he finds. Luckily, another Dollhouse employee soon arrives, having overheard Topher's call. Who is it?", "correct": "Boyd, the head of security", "options": ["Ballard, the former FBI man", "Ivy, Topher's assistant", "Adelle, the head of the Dollhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoyd, the head of security.\n\n\tConfronted with a weeping, shell-shocked Priya and a panicking Topher, Boyd immediately takes charge. He orders Topher to help him dispose of Nolan's body, while Priya packs a suitcase to make it look like Nolan's gone on a trip. Boyd seems to have a disturbing amount of expertise in this area ... which is especially troubling due to Adelle's earlier admission that the Dollhouse staff were all selected because they had already been \"morally compromised.\"\r Topher is still stunned by the turn of events. \"I was just trying to help her,\" he protests, echoing the teaser. \"Priya does not belong in the Dollhouse.\"\r \"She does now,\" Boyd says, and sure enough, Priya returns to life as a Doll. She resigns herself to it, with the help of one silver lining: the killing will literally be wiped from her memory. \n"}, {"text": "The episode ends with things mostly in order -- but Echo finds something extra. It's a gift from Boyd, who knows that she's evolving a personality. What is it?", "correct": "An all-access security pass to the Dollhouse", "options": ["A hundred-dollar bill", "Senator Perrin's phone number", "A threatening note"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn all-access security pass to the Dollhouse.\n\n\tEarlier in the episode, Boyd had confronted Echo about a book she was trying to read -- not a typical Doll hobby. Knowing the jig was up, she told her former handler her goal: \"Something bad is coming, like a storm. And I want everyone to survive it. They need to wake up.\"\r He warned her that her actions might bring the storm, but said he wouldn't stand in her way. And now, he's proved it: she finds the pass concealed in her book, tucked in a note that reads, \"For the storm.\" \n"}]}
