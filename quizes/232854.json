{"id": "232854", "name": "I Only Stunk a Little Quiz | Baseball | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "Baseball", "           MLB for Dummies"], "questions": [{"text": "Call me Mr. October, Mr. Limelight, or whatever you want.  I did hit over 500 home runs in my career though.  You can't remember me for being the first player to strike out over 2000 times in a career.  Who am I?", "correct": "Reggie Jackson", "options": ["Bill Buckner", "Steve Garvey", "Stan Musial"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReggie Jackson.\n\n\tNone of the others hit 500 home runs.  When Jackson retired in 1987, he was the only player to reach 2000 career strikeouts, and actually had 2597.  In his final season, he appeared in 115 games while striking out 97 times. \n"}, {"text": "Some fans thought that I stunk in my first six seasons, only having one winning season.  I showed them.  In the next six, I had all winning seasons, and in a four-year span, won a MVP, three Cy Young awards and three Triple Crowns.  I retired after that.  I guess it was better to stink up front, then overshadow it with greatness.  Who am I?", "correct": "Sandy Koufax", "options": ["Frank Howard", "John Roseboro", "Tommy Davis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSandy Koufax.\n\n\tThe others were all Dodgers but never pitched.

I hit 54 home runs in a season, then did an encore with 59 in the following season.  A few seasons later I hit 'only' 25, and for the first time in nine seasons, my batting average dropped below .300.  The fans were booing me and said that I was washed up.  I guess that I showed them.  Who am I?", "correct": "Babe Ruth", "options": ["Ty Cobb", "Ralph Kiner", "Jimmie Foxx"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBabe Ruth.\n\n\tRuth's booed season came in 1925 with the Yankees.

He retired with 714 home runs in 1935. \n"}, {"text": "In 1972, I was on top of the world by going 27-10 with 310 strikeouts on the season.  I won the Triple Crown and the Cy Young award also.  I don't know what I was thinking in 1973.  I went the opposite direction by going 13-20!  That was Ok because when I retired in 1988, I was the first left-hander to throw 4000 career strikeouts.  Who am I?", "correct": "Steve Carlton", "options": ["Roger Clemens", "Nolan Ryan", "Bob Gibson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve Carlton.\n\n\tThe others were all right-handers, and none were a member of the 20-loss club.  Carlton was in his first season with the Phillies when he went 27-10.  It was his first year in Philadelphia after spending seven in St. Louis.  Steve retired in 1988, then was inducted into the hall in 1994. \n"}, {"text": "In 11 of my 13 seasons, I hit over .300 including .382 in 1920.  In 1921 nobody liked me.  I didn't even hit .200.  As a matter of fact, I didn't play.  The league wouldn't let me.  My name is Joe Jackson.  What happened?", "correct": "Black Sox Scandal", "options": ["Insider stock trading", "Was charged with murder", "Was sent to prison for tax evasion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack Sox Scandal.\n\n\tThe infamous 1919 World Series, appropriately named the Black Sox Scandal for numerous Chicago White Sox players rigging the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds.  Numerous White Sox players were banned after the 1920 season. \n"}, {"text": "I think that I was the first pitcher to win 20 games for six consecutive seasons, but I did win 20 games 13 times in my career.  After all that and in my last two seasons, I went 6-13 and 7-16.  I think that was Ok considering my accomplishments.  Who am I?", "correct": "Warren Spahn", "options": ["Rico Petrocelli", "Ron Santo", "Phil Rizzuto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarren Spahn.\n\n\tThe others were all infielders.  Warren played for the Boston, then Milwaukee Braves for 20 of his 21 seasons.  He retired with 363 wins, and ironically, 363 hits of his own.  He retired as a San Francisco Giant, and was inducted into the hall in 1973. \n"}, {"text": "I went 31-6 and 24-9 in 1968 and 1969.  After that I pretty much stunk as my total record after that was 17-34 over three seasons.  Two Cy Young awards and the AL MVP in my career, but the Hall of Fame will not consider me.  Who am I?", "correct": "Denny McLain", "options": ["Julian Javier", "Mike Shannon", "Curt Flood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDenny McLain.\n\n\tMcLain shined with the Tigers in his two glorious seasons.

Who was this 1939 Hall of Famer?", "correct": "George Sisler", "options": ["Walter Johnson", "Randy Johnson", "Jim Maloney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Sisler.\n\n\tThe others were all pitchers.  Sisler spanked 257 hits in 1920 with the St. Louis Browns, which was pretty much the only team's highlight while in St. Louis.  They later became the Baltimore Orioles.  Sisler managed the Browns from 1924-1926, with his last season producing a 62-92 record.  Ichiro Suzuki broke George's record in 2004 with 262 hits. \n"}, {"text": "In my fourth season in baseball with the Cincinnati Reds in 2004, I finished second in the NL by hitting 46 home runs.

Who am I?", "correct": "Adam Dunn", "options": ["Don Baylor", "Graig Nettles", "Chris Chambliss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdam Dunn.\n\n\tThe others listed all retired in 1988.  One reason for Dunn's new strikeout record was an amazing 568 at-bats in the season. \n"}, {"text": "In 1968, I won the NL Cy Young and the season MVP with my amazing 1.12 ERA with the Cardinals.  In my final season in 1975, I had a ERA of 5.04, so I only stunk for a short time.  Who am I?", "correct": "Bob Gibson", "options": ["Pete Alexander", "Harry Covelski", "Cy Young"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob Gibson.\n\n\tThe others listed all died in the 1950s.

The immortal Bob Gibson was a 1981 Hall of Fame inductee. \n"}]}
