{"id": "312918", "name": "Your Quiz Has Been Placed Online!  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Quizmaker Tune-Ups"], "questions": [{"text": "A friend of yours sends you a congratulatory message about your first quiz, and mentions that they have been working a quiz for months, and it still isn't online.  What is the best response to give him/her?", "correct": "I know you can do it.  Just keep at it and it will be online in no time!", "options": ["They are tired of you correcting their corrections.", "That is because you are stupid, dummy!", "Ewe cant splel, yews a splelczecher!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI know you can do it.  Just keep at it and it will be online in no time!\n\n\tIf somebody is upset about not getting a quiz online, don't make them feel bad about it.  It is best to encourage your friend and tell them they can do it, and they will get it online.  A good friend is someone who doesn't brag about how much better their quiz-making skills are. \n"}, {"text": "Uh oh!  You just noticed that your quiz is in the wrong subcategory!  What is the best way to fix the error without having your quiz taken offline?", "correct": "Ask the editor who put it online to fix it", "options": ["Fix it yourself", "Don't worry about it; if someone doesn't like it, they will send a correction note", "Delete the quiz entirely"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsk the editor who put it online to fix it.\n\n\tNever delete a quiz just because there is a single error!  Do not just ignore errors, either.  That could cause problems in the future.  It would be best to ask an editor to fix it for you, however.  When you try changing the subcategory, the quiz will be taken offline, so you have to resubmit it.  An editor can fix the problem and get it back online in no time, so you don't have to wait through the queue again! \n"}, {"text": "Yes!  You just got your first compliment!  They told you it was wonderful, and they look forward to many more from you.  What is the best thing to do next?", "correct": "Respond to it", "options": ["Copy it and show it off to your friends", "Delete it", "Report it to the editors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRespond to it.\n\n\tThe most polite thing to do is respond to the message.  You can delete it afterward, but it is nice to thank somebody for a compliment they have given you.  There is no need to report a compliment to the editors!  A compliment is a good thing, after all.  Don't brag about it, either.  Some friends who don't have a quiz online may feel bad, especially your friend from question one who has tried for months to get one online! \n"}, {"text": "Oops!  You found yet another error in your new quiz.  This time, however, it is in the interesting information section of question four.  You accidentally wrote \"form\" instead of \"from!\"  What should you do?", "correct": "Fix it and save the quiz", "options": ["Take the quiz offline, fix it, and resubmit", "Change the entire wording of the interesting information to use the word \"form\"", "Ignore it; wait for a correction note"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFix it and save the quiz.\n\n\tYou don't need to take a quiz offline to correct an error.  When it is in the quiz itself, you can make the change and save your quiz.  If a quiz does not have any new errors found by the system, it will remain online.  If you deleted all the interesting information, and then saved, it would see there is no II and take the quiz offline.  It is pretty easy to make a single correction in a quiz if it hasn't been archived. \n"}, {"text": "Dang, your quiz is riddled with errors.  Now you have an actual correction notice.  However, this time, you're sure there is no error.  The player who sent the correction is wrong.  What is the best thing to do in a situation like this?", "correct": "Send a message saying why they are wrong, politely", "options": ["Click the \"corrected\" button, pretending you fixed it", "Send a message telling them they are stupid", "Change it anyway, to make the player happy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSend a message saying why they are wrong, politely.\n\n\tIt would be nice for a player to get a message back so they know they were wrong, and why.  If they play the quiz again, and see that it hasn't been changed, they might send another correction.  Sending a polite note as to why they were wrong will prevent mishaps later on. \n"}, {"text": "Yes!  It's been about a month, and you haven't had a correction in a long time.  You have finally reached twenty ratings, and your quiz is in the sunglasses club awards!  What should you do now?", "correct": "Give yourself a pat on the back for a job well done", "options": ["Delete the quiz", "Brag about it", "Complain that it isn't rated as highly as it should"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGive yourself a pat on the back for a job well done.\n\n\tGo ahead, give yourself a pat on the back!  Don't brag about it, though, as this may cause others to feel bad, especially if they have been struggling getting a quiz rated highly enough.  Don't complain, either!  The top 15,000 is nothing to feel bad about!  And of course, do not delete a quiz just because.  There is rarely, if ever, a reason to do so. \n"}, {"text": "Someone asks you to write a quiz for them so they can get one online.  They say your quiz was excellent, and they want an excellent quiz, too.  What is the best thing to say to them?", "correct": "I cannot write a quiz for you, but I can help you out with one.", "options": ["Oh, heck no!  Quiz writing is an art, and clearly, you have no skill!", "Sure, I'll do it!", "Sure, I'll do it! (then you sabotage them with a bad quiz)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI cannot write a quiz for you, but I can help you out with one.\n\n\tYou shouldn't write a quiz for somebody else to put online.  That isn't right.  You don't want to be rude to them when you decline, either.  And you most definitely do not want to sabotage them!  It is best to tell them you are not supposed to write a quiz for them, but it would be ok to tell them you can help them out.  For instance, you can spell check it for them. \n"}, {"text": "With your recent success of your new quiz, you decide to write another.  When you finish, however, you get a correction note from an editor saying \"Use a spellchecker in this quiz.  You will find that you have misspelled quite a number of words.\"  What is the best thing to do?", "correct": "Use a spellchecker or a word processor", "options": ["Report the editor to an administrator", "Delete the quiz", "Make no corrections, but resubmit the quiz, hoping another editor will edit the quiz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUse a spellchecker or a word processor.\n\n\tEditors are here to help us, not make our lives miserable!  If they tell you to use a spellchecker, you probably do have a lot of errors in your quiz.  Deleting a quiz is never a good idea.  Only report an editor if they say something in a very rude way, like \"Come on, dummy, your first quiz was golden.  You are better than this.  Check out this horrible quiz and resubmit it when you are done making all those stinkin' corrections!  Gaah!\"  That is rather rude, isn't it? \n"}, {"text": "Aah, this quiz is only ranked at 70,000.  What should you do?", "correct": "Leave it be", "options": ["Create as many accounts as you can and rate it excellent", "Complain on the chat boards", "Delete the quiz, clearly, it isn't liked"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeave it be.\n\n\tCreating numerous accounts to rate your quiz excellent will cause you to be banned.  It is not right to make accounts for your own gain.  Don't delete a quiz, either.  Just because it is rated poorly, does not mean it is a poor quiz!  That just means there are 69,999 quizzes rated better.  Sometimes a quiz just doesn't have enough popularity, even though it is an excellently written quiz, so it is rated poorly.  Don't complain, either.  Nobody likes a complainer.\r If your quiz is rated at 70,000, there is nothing you can really do. Just let it be, and don't worry about it. \n"}, {"text": "Congratulations on your recently accepted quizzes.  You are now able to use fill in the blank questions.  Which of these is an acceptable fill in the blank response?", "correct": "Food Network", "options": ["It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", "August 10, 1999", "There once was a man from Peru, who dreamt he was eating his shoe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFood Network.\n\n\tDates are generally not accepted as multiple choice quizzes, let alone fill in the blank.  Besides, a date can be written in far too many ways (e.g. Aug 10, 1999; Aug. 10, 1999; Aug 10 1999; 8-10-99; 10-8-99; etc.)  Answers that are too long are also not accepted.  Answers with commas are also not allowed, and something like \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" may be confusing to players.  An answer of \"Food Network\" works the best here, although you would also want to put \"FoodNetwork\" as an alternative answer, as sometimes it is written as one word. \n"}]}
