What they find is that the crack leads to another universe, and when they open it they find that a prison on the other side is missing an inmate-- 'Prisoner Zero'-- who they don't know yet, but has crossed to the other side. The Doctor has to return to the TARDIS as it begins to regenerate, promising he'll be back in five minutes, but he needs up leaving for twelve years, returning to solve the mystery when Amy, now a Kissogram dating local nurse Rory Williams, is older. They eventually do figure out that the prisoner is a malicious force and, after losing the use of the TARDIS and the Sonic Screwdriver, the Doctor is able to pull his wits together to stop the foe and send off his jailers, the Atraxi, using the rules of the Shadow Proclamation.  Hipping back into the newly-reformed TARDIS and taking it for a spin, the Doctor heads back to invite Amy along, learning that another two years have passed.  She accepts, but the Doctor doesn't know that her wedding is less than a day away. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Beast Below\" - The story takes place on a starship built on the back of which of these?", "correct": "Star Whale", "options": ["The TARDIS", "Asteroid", "The Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Whale.\n\n\tFor their first trip together, the Doctor takes Amy to the Starship UK, floating through space, where they're immediately thrust into a mystery sparked by a crying little girl.  As it seems, the ship isn't running, but still moves.  It doesn't take long for both the Doctor and Amy to get into trouble, plunging into the mouth of a gigantic creature later to be known as the last Star Whale, before they're saved by the reigning monarch, Liz 10, who seeks to uncover the plot before her. What they all discover is that Liz 10 and countless others have been choosing to forget why they're there, floating on the back of the Star Whale, for hundreds of years. It takes Amy's bold decision to break the ship's hold on the whale to save everyone, allowing them all to live on in harmony while they wait for Earth to become inhabitable once more. \n"}, {"text": "\"Victory of the Daleks\" - Which former UK Prime Minister calls the Doctor back in time?", "correct": "Winston Churchill", "options": ["Margaret Thatcher", "Neville Chamberlain", "Benjamin Disraeli"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinston Churchill.\n\n\tReceiving a call from Winston Churchill, the Doctor and Amy head through time, back to the London Blitz in World War II, to discover that the British are using a Dalek to win the battle.  Referred to as an Ironside, the Dalek proves to be a menace when the Doctor reveals his identity and alerts an orbiting Dalek ship to his presence. The Daleks make an attempt to unleash a bomb on the British forces and alert the Germans to their whereabouts, but the Doctor is able to stop both of these from being fatal.  What he can't stop, however, is a fleet of newer, stronger Daleks-- created from Davros' DNA-- from emerging from the Progenitor device, the only ship to survive the destruction of the Crucible. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Time of Angels\"/\"Flesh and Stone\" - Amy becomes infected when a Weeping Angel imprints on her mind.  How is she cured?", "correct": "The Weeping Angels are erased from time", "options": ["She's not cured", "The Weeping Angels release her as a hostage", "The Doctor uses his Sonic Screwdriver to clean-sweep her mind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Weeping Angels are erased from time.\n\n\tReceiving a message from River Song, the Doctor and Amy have to head to the planet Alfava Metraxis to find her and the recently-crashed Byzantium spacecraft.  As it turns out, a Weeping Angel has been stored in the cargo bay, and the leaking radiation will only make it stronger.  In fact, its strength is enough to allow the Weeping Angel to emerge from a video loop, without a physical form, and when Amy looks into its eyes it imprints on her brain. Things only worsen when the Doctor, River Song, and Amy head into a labyrinth to find it populated almost entirely by Weeping Angels; it takes inverting gravity and heading into the Byzantium through an exit hole to get any distance, and even then they find themselves trapped. In the control room, after opening a path into a forested oxygen factory, the Doctor finds that Amy is infected with the image of a Weeping Angel and must keep her eyes closed, and a crack in the wall-- identical to the one from Amy's bedroom-- is leaking time energy.  All of this proves troubling, and the Doctor can only save Amy and River using teleportation and shifts in gravity, forcing the Angels to fall into the time crack and get erased from time.  This, fortunately, seals the crack...for now.  After the adventure, Amy and the Doctor go back to Amy's present day and she reveals that she plans to get married in the morning.  The Doctor, however, finds that her wedding date is also the date of a major time explosion. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Vampires of Venice\" - The alleged 'vampires' reside in which of these institutions?", "correct": "A school", "options": ["An asylum", "A library", "A hospital"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA school.\n\n\tCollecting Amy's fiance, Rory, the Doctor brings the couple (to be married the next day in their time) back to sixteenth-century Venice but fall into trouble almost immediately, getting caught up in a plot involving what the trio initially discovers to be vampires when, really, it's a race of aliens from Saturnyne hoping to use the sealed-off city to reestablish their species. The Doctor discovers that the aliens only landed on Earth to escape what their leader refers to as 'The Silence' hidden in the cracks of time.  While Rory and Amy reconnect, destroying one of the leader's main henchmen in the process, the Doctor prevents Venice from sinking. He does not, however, stop the leader of the Saturnyne people from committing suicide. \n"}, {"text": "\"Amy's Choice\" - The Doctor, Amy, and Rory find themselves unable to determine the truth behind their reality when they meet 'The Dream Lord'.  Who does the Dream Lord turn out to be?", "correct": "A manifestation of the Doctor's darker side", "options": ["The Master", "An alien from a crack in time", "A former companion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA manifestation of the Doctor's darker side.\n\n\tThe Doctor, Amy, and Rory have trouble comprehending the truth when they all spend a short time in Upper Leadworth; Amy is pregnant, Rory has a ponytail, and the Doctor is stopping in for a visit.  While they believe this, they all fall asleep, waking up back on the TARDIS and recognizing their shared consciousness. Soon, they all drift between the two realities, unable to figure out which is which, and they're convinced by a figure known as the 'Dream Lord' that only one is real; if they kill themselves in the fake one, they'll wake up alive and free in the real one.  The choice seems to be made for them when Rory is killed in Upper Leadworth, leading Amy to kill herself and the Doctor. Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor discovers that they're still in a dream-- both realities were not actually real-- and he detonates the ship.  The three end up waking up in the real TARDIS, now safe, and the Doctor reveals that the Dream Lord was actually a part of himself brought out by the appearance of Psychic Pollen in the TARDIS' core. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Hungry Earth\"/\"Cold Blood\" - According to the Doctor, the Silurian race's residence on Earth predates humankind's.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Doctor, Amy, and Rory end up in Wales to find a mining operation with a small problem and, after Amy is pulled into the Earth, The Doctor discovers that the problem is a race of reptilian underground dwellers known as the Silurians.  He and Rory are able to capture and imprison one, and he decides to head underground to negotiate an exchange of hostages. What he finds there is a civilization, and it's not long before he's captured.  Though Amy breaks free of her own imprisonment underground and she reunites with The Doctor, the two of them are quickly tied up and prepared for execution.  Fortunately, the Silurian military is called off by their leader and talks are able to begin to unite both human and Silurian-kind. The discussion comes to an abrupt end when Rory arrives with the dead hostage, and the others are forced to escape through the ventilation shafts of the tunnels.  The Silurians go into cryo-sleep to protect themselves, but as The Doctor, Amy, and Rory reach the TARDIS they witness another large crack in space-time.  Rory is shot by the final militant Silurian and killed; the crack pulls him in as the other two depart, and when they leave, The Doctor is disappointed to find that Amy can't remember him at all.  He's been erased from time.  The Doctor, having pulled shrapnel from the crack in time-space, discovers that it's a piece of the TARDIS. \n"}, {"text": "\"Vincent and the Doctor\" - The Doctor and Amy head into the past to meet Vincent Van Gogh.  What's odd about the alien they have to face?", "correct": "It's invisible to most people", "options": ["It's made of plant matter", "It's actually a human", "It's from the distant future"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's invisible to most people.\n\n\tAmy wonders why The Doctor is taking her everywhere she wants to go on a whim and wonders if he's compensating for something.  Arriving at the Musee d'Orsay, the two spot something lurking in the window of a church in one of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings, and they decide to head back in time to find out what evil awaits. Unfortunately, Van Gogh is a bit kooky and while Amy is a bit starstruck, The Doctor keeps his focus...until Van Gogh begins fighting invisible assailants.  Fortunately for the artist, something's actually there-- the doctor only sees it when he uses a special device from the TARDIS.  The three head to the church from the painting and do battle with the creature and Vincent is forced to kill it with an easel when it charges the group. The moment sparks something in Van Gogh and the two take him to the future to see his exhibit.  Despite this, when he returns to the past, he commits suicide as history always intended, though it's clear that The Doctor and Amy made an impact. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Lodger\" - The Doctor ends up trapped in Colchester in the modern day.  Where is Amy at this time?", "correct": "In the TARDIS", "options": ["At a funeral", "On a space station in the future", "In India"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the TARDIS.\n\n\tArriving in Essex, The Doctor is ejected from the TARDIS, leaving Amy alone in the spaceship while he remains on Earth.  Somewhere in town, a flat owner, Craig, worries about the weird goings-on in their apartment above his.  Coincidentally, The Doctor is also looking for a place to stay, and it happens to be in that particular house since whatever's in the top floor of the flat is preventing the TARDIS from landing. Whatever's up there also seems to be attracting passers-by and tricking them upstairs, in turn causing a number of issues with time.  The Doctor remains in contact with Amy to fix things remotely, but spends time hanging out and matchmaking with his new flatmate. When his hand is forced, the Doctor reveals the truth to Craig and they head upstairs to discover...there is no upstairs.  Someone's built a TARDIS in the flat.  The ship's programming tries to take The Doctor, but Craig sacrifices himself instead, fighting to stay for the girl he loves, Sophie.  This rights The Doctor's TARDIS and forces the secondary ship to implode.  As he leaves, The Doctor doesn't notice the crack in time in Craig's wall.  The crack begins to glow just as Amy discovers Rory's ring in The Doctor's jacket pocket. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Pandorica Opens\"/\"The Big Bang\" - Who travels thousands of years into the future in the Pandorica?", "correct": "Amy", "options": ["River Song", "Rory", "The Doctor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmy.\n\n\tThe Doctor and Amy reunite with River Song at Stonehenge in 102 AD in an attempt to solve the mystery of the Pandorica and the cracks in the universe.  While there, they discover that Rory is amongst the Centurions in the Roman forces residing there, but something much more nefarious is at play-- he's actually an Auton and, along with several other alien races, a conspiracy has been put in place to store the Doctor away in the device, preventing the TARDIS from destroying everything in the universe.  They succeed while Rory, powerless to stop his Auton ways, shoots Amy and kills her.\rThough all seems lost, The Doctor appears to Rory using the Vortex Manipulator and gives him the tools he needs to free himself from the Pandorica.  The two of them place Amy into the device and send her into the future (only to be freed by a younger version of herself) where Rory, surviving all of time, protects her until the Doctor returns.  Reunited at last (also with River Song), the four are able to send the Doctor into space with his TARDIS to jumpstart the universe with a second Big Bang, saving everybody but removing himself from all of it.\rOn Amy and Rory's wedding day, the duo celebrate their union but Amy's memories allow her to summon The Doctor back into existence.  Instead of remaining at home, the newlyweds rejoin The Doctor for another adventure. \n"}]}
