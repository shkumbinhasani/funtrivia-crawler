{"id": "356851", "name": "\"Continuum\" Trivia Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Asylum"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of Kit's daughter with Alma?", "correct": "Julia", "options": ["Mary", "Judy", "Wendy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJulia.\n\n\tIn 1967, at the Walker household, it's nighttime.  Kit pulls a bloody axe from a body on the floor.  Sitting down, he hears his daughter calling from the next room.  He says he'll be there in a minute.\r Weeks earlier, Kit, Grace, and Alma lived as normal a life as they could get.  Kit decided to marry both of them and live in a polygamist relationship while raising both babies.  Grace, believing the aliens to be figures of good, spends her time drawing her abductors, at least what she can remember of them; Alma tries to forget.  When Kit gets home, Alma suggests that perhaps the pictures are a bit much for Thomas and Julie. \n"}, {"text": "According to Alma, why does Grace dwell on what happened to her?", "correct": "Because she's unhappy in the present time", "options": ["Because she regrets her choices", "Because she fears the future", "Because she wants to go back"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause she's unhappy in the present time.\n\n\tHeading to bed, Alma speaks to Kit about Grace, specifically her fascination with the aliens.  Alma thinks that she's dwelling on the past because she's unhappy in the presence, so she sends Kit to her to make her feel better.  While in bed with Kit, Grace says that she's making the pictures for their kids.  She's not afraid of the aliens; she's more afraid of the night she lost control of herself and killed her family.  Kit tells her she's a different person now.\rThat evening, a bright light illuminates the Walker household and fire is thrown through their window.  Alma is worried that it's the visitors, but it's actually unaccepting locals trying to force out their family unit. \n"}, {"text": "Does Kit murder Grace?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe Walkers have no choice but to live on day-by-day since the police won't do anything about the problem; polygamy is legal in Massachusetts and they won't get involved.  Over the next days, the situation gets worse in the house.  Alma starts getting short with Grace, culminating to an argument about the aliens.  When Grace says that perhaps Kit will be taken back by the aliens, Alma slaps her while Kit is out chopping firewood.\rThat night, Kit finds Grace in the living room drawing.  Grace says that she's excited for the future and she loves her family.  Her life with them has been precious, but something has changed; she can't live in fear and isolation again.  They have to embrace life.  Her admission is cut short, however, as Alma plunges an axe into Grace's back in an attempt to prevent the aliens from coming back.  Kit pulls the bloody axe from her body on the floor.  Sitting down, he hears Julia calling from the next room.  He says he'll be there in a minute. \n"}, {"text": "What game does Jude play with the other inmates in Briarcliff?", "correct": "Candy Land", "options": ["Monopoly", "Checkers", "Scrabble"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCandy Land.\n\n\tIn 1968, Jude plays Candy Land with Pepper and others in the common room.  When the Monsignor comes in, he asks for a word with her.  She says that she doesn't refer to herself as Jude; Jude is dead.  Her name is Betty Drake and she's the Queen of Candy Land.  The Monsignor is leaving Briarcliff since he's been appointed Cardinal of New York. The church has donated Briarcliff to the State, relinquishing all patients to their care.  It will be used as an overflow facility for troubled inmates.  He tells Jude that she will be released; he'll make sure of it.  He can't have her locked up there any more because it weighs too heavily on his conscience. She says that false hope is the cruelest thing of all.  This is the last time they speak. \n"}, {"text": "When the asylum receives new inmates, Jude is shocked to discover that one of them looks like whom?", "correct": "The Archangel of Death", "options": ["Lana", "Sister Mary Eunice", "Shelley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Archangel of Death.\n\n\tThe patients and inmates start to roll in once the state takes over.  While working in the bakery one day, Jude is shocked to see a new inmate arrive; she looks identical to the Archangel of Death, Shacnath, who had visited her many times before.  Jude believes she knows exactly who she is and is shocked to find that they're cellmates.  She says that they can rule the roost together or she'll rule it alone.  Later that day, Jude watches as Alma walks through the doors of the asylum, now an inmate.\rOver the coming days, Jude struggles to cope with the fear of the angel of death, or at least the representation of her, as she sleeps in the same quarters.  In the common room, she watches as the woman shivs another patient in the side when he refuses to give in to her requests.  Jude watches as she blows her a kiss. \n"}, {"text": "How much time has elapsed between Jude's last conversation with the Monsignor and her discussion with Dr. Crump?", "correct": "Two and a half years", "options": ["Three weeks", "Two months", "Less than a week"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo and a half years.\n\n\tWaking up in the middle of the night, Jude sees the Archangel standing over her, leaning in for her kiss of death, but Jude won't have it.  Instead, she fights back, pushing her dreaded foe away.  The orderlies head to her cell to find her attacking her roommate, a woman she's never seen before.\rJude finds herself in the office that was once her own, tied into a straight-jacket.  The shadow of where a cross once rested on the wall can be seen in the dim light.  The new administrator of the facility, Dr. Miranda Crump, decides to figure out the problem.  Dr. Crump says that she hasn't seemed to like any of her roommates over the past two months-- there's been five.  Jude is taken aback by this; she certainly hasn't remembered anyone except the angel woman.  Confused, she complies with the doctor's wishes.\rJude asks about speaking to the Monsignor.  The doctor is confused by this, even when she establishes that Timothy Howard is now Cardinal.  He hasn't been involved with Briarcliff since he left for New York two and a half years earlier.  Jude says to ask Pepper to validate this fact; she's been dead since 1966.  Dr. Crump says that they can up her medication and everything will be alright. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Lana's first book?", "correct": "Maniac", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nManiac.\n\n\tIn 1969, Lana arrives at a bookstore for a reading of her now-\"New York Times\" bestselling book, \"Maniac: One Woman's Story of Survival\", which had shown on the top of the chart for ten weeks.  She begins her session with a reading from a portion in which she was in Thredson's basement chamber.  Soon, it becomes evident that she used some creative liberties; the passage speaks of an instance in which Thredson brought a second woman into the basement.  As Lana speaks, she imagines Thredson standing in the audience and decrying the falsity of her text; Lana says that she's a writer-- she writes the essence of truth.  She also imagines Wendy in the audience, disappointed for calling her a 'roommate' and not a 'lover' to protect herself.\rLana is unable to finish the passage and the bookstore proprietor lets her stop, believing her to be affected by the story she once lived.  The crowd applauds her. \n"}, {"text": "Lana tells Kit her plans for a follow-up book.  Who does she say it'll be based on?", "correct": "Leigh Emerson", "options": ["Sister Mary Eunice", "Sister Jude", "Dr. Arden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeigh Emerson.\n\n\tWhile Lana signs books and sends away her personal assistant, she doesn't notice Kit stepping up to the table for a signing.  She gets up and embraces him before expressing her apologies for Grace's death.  At the same time it's clear that Lana hasn't tried to stay in contact.  She claims it's because she's been too busy-- she just sold the film rights to \"Maniac\" to Hollywood.  They go for a coffee.\rLana tries to avoid the topic of Briarcliff when she talks to Kit; she mentions the idea for a second book, this one about Leigh Emerson.  She jokes that the title should be Santa and the Seven Nuns (since he killed seven while he was there).  Lana says she found her voice, like Capote, by writing about stunted male psyches.  Kit is disappointed since she vows to bring down Briarcliff for Jude. \n"}, {"text": "Who finds Jude, in person, in Briarcliff after believing her long-dead?", "correct": "Kit", "options": ["Lana", "Johnny Thredson", "Monsignor Howard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKit.\n\n\tLana argues with Kit that she doesn't need to bring down Briarcliff anymore.  She spun straw into gold and made a substantial life for herself.  She says she could be back in there, drooling into bread dough, but she's not.  Kit takes offense to this-- his wife is still in there.  Kit realized that Alma was losing hope before her death; she passed away when her heart stopped without warning.  She was brought back to the house to be buried.\rLana says that they're the only two left, but Kit says that one person is still there-- Jude.  When visiting Alma, Kit found Jude watching the TV in the common room and claiming that \"The Flying Nun\" was about her life.  She vowed that one day she'd fly out of Briarcliff.  Lana is shocked and disappointed-- when she went back the Monsignor said she died.  Kit says that the world needs to know about Briarcliff and it needs to end. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of the episode, what does Johnny attempt to retrieve?", "correct": "A book", "options": ["A kiss", "An address", "A tape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA book.\n\n\tIn the present day, Johnny Thredson visits the same bookstore Lana was in back in the late-1960s.  A woman is selling the last of the stock to close the store.  He tells her that he's a connoisseur of first edition books and he's looking for only one in particular: \"Maniac\".  Unfortunately, it's not for sale since it holds sentimental value.  Johnny makes her name a price and says that the author is his mother.  She doesn't fall for this since her only child allegedly died at birth.\rWhen she shows him the autograph inside, he names his price.  She'll give him the book because it's his fate to have it, meet his mother, and shoot her in the face when he reveals who he is.  He will complete his father's work. \n"}]}
