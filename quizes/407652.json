Here, one member of each team took a ride through the riverbeds of the beautiful Icelandic landscape searching for eleven large, wooden letters, each marked with a number.  When they had all of this information, they could return to the starting point and spell out the word Ing\u00f3lfstorg to get their next clue.  Henry, Conor, Cody, Jen, Shawn, Trevor, Brittany, Dessie, Tim, Daniel, and Sarah were selected to participate in this first Road Block of the race. \n"}, {"text": "Ten racers completed the SkyClimb Road Block in Leg 2, doing so in what country?", "correct": "Belgium", "options": ["The Netherlands", "Denmark", "Germany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBelgium.\n\n\tHeading to the city of Antwerp, Belgium in Leg 2, teams started the day with a Road Block task that pushed racers to their physical limits, forcing them to climb a 100m ladder to the top of a crane over the edge of the Antwerp waterfront.  Shawn, Chris, Jessica, Joey, Evan, Sarah, Kristi, Lucas, Alex, and Eric completed this task and collected their clues at the top to keep on racing. \n"}, {"text": "Visiting Tangier, Morocco, teams sent the Travelocity Roaming Gnome on how many ziplines over the city markets?", "correct": "Two & 2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo & 2.\n\n\tVisiting the kasbah of Tangier, team members chosen for the Road Block had to navigate the rooftops and narrow medina alleys of the Old City, sending the Travelocity Roaming Gnome on a trip to different destinations with the aim of collecting him and a coin they could use on a marked payphone.  If they completed the course and used the payphone they could receive a password (Sabah al-khair) that they could say to a local shopkeeper to collect their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 4, which individual racer chipped their tooth during the Saint-Tropez sailing Road Block?", "correct": "Evan", "options": ["Jessica", "Brittany", "Kristi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvan.\n\n\tIn an unexpected injurious turn, Evan chipped one of her front teeth on the French Riviera, getting hit in the face by the boom of her Optimist dinghy during the Road Block in the race's fourth leg.  For this challenge, team members needed to head out to sea and collect two halves of a clue from marked buoys out on the water.  When they brought them both back to shore, they could continue racing.  Despite Evan's injury, she and Henry were able to keep racing; she would receive emergency dental work upon completing the leg and be in good enough shape to continue by the next Pit Start. \n"}, {"text": "While some racers constructed a trebuchet for the Road Block in Leg 5, what were their partners doing?", "correct": "Waiting in the stockades", "options": ["Enjoying French wine", "Waiting in a prison cell", "Feeding animals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWaiting in the stockades.\n\n\tContinuing through the south of France in Leg 5, teams travelled around Provence, retracing the steps not only of the medieval era greats, but of racers in the very first \"Amazing Race\".

In this challenge, team members had to enter a warehouse full of ringing phones, picking them up one by one searching for eight different phones that would give them specific words which, when rearranged, would give the phrase \"The meaning of life is that it stops.\"  They needed to fill out a bureaucratic form and write the phrase where needed to get their clue and head to the Pit Stop. \n"}, {"text": "Legs 7, 8, and 9 of the race featured zero Road Block tasks.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn a surprisingly long stretch, teams faced zero Road Blocks as they made their way through Zimbabwe and Bahrain between Legs 7 and 9.  Part of this is because teams faced the first-ever Partner Swap in Leg 7.  Interestingly, Leg 9 didn't feature a Detour either, making it the first leg of the series to omit both task types without being the final leg of the race. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 10, team members had to eat three scorpions and which other Thai delicacy when they visited Chiang Mai?", "correct": "Bullfrog", "options": ["Crocodile", "Crickets", "Snake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBullfrog.\n\n\tTeams ended the race's tenth leg with a stop-off at the Original Khum Khantoke Restaurant where one team member had to eat scorpions and bullfrog to get their last clue.  While they ate each dish, their partners needed to stand still across the restaurant as four scorpions crawled on their bodies for the duration of the task.  Alex, Cody, Jen, and Evan had to eat, which meant that Conor, Jessica, Kristi, and Henry had to spend time with the wildlife. \n"}, {"text": "During the penultimate leg of the race, the team member who was selected for the Road Block was handcuffed.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDuring this task, which involved making 'rage art' on a rooftop in Hong Kong, team member selected for the task needed to find two pieces of the clue trapped inside old furniture and electronics.  At the same time, their partner (not the one selected for the task) was required to stand by while they were handcuffed to a briefcase to be used in the final task of the leg.  In reality, they were traveling with all the information they needed to head to the Pit Stop. \n"}, {"text": "During the race's final leg (in San Francisco), did all racers complete a Road Block?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThis season, only one Road Block was featured in the final leg and it required that team members full themselves up through the inner structure of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.  While it may have seemed like a Road Block due to its nature, the final task onboard the USS Hornet, requiring that the person who did not complete the Road Block be the one to build a plane for the final puzzle, was not classed as such. \n"}]}
