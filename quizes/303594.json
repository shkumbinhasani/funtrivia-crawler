Originally, this unit had a colour screen.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe iPod Classic was unable to project colour images on its LCD screen until its fourth generation, released in 2005.  The fourth generation classic (also known as the iPod Photo), began the trend of using the iPod as an alternative media storage device.  Rather than just being an MP3 player, the iPod Photo was first to store and display colour photos transferred to the device.\rThe original first generation iPod was released in 2001 in 5GB and 10GB units.  It wasn't until the fourth generation that sales surged, bringing iPod (as a brand-name) to the public's eye and installing Apple as the leading MP3 manufacturer. \n"}, {"text": "The fifth generation iPod Classic was released in black and which other colour?", "correct": "White", "options": ["Silver", "Blue", "Grey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite.\n\n\tUp until the fifth generation (excluding a special edition U2-themed iPod Classic), the Classics had only been released in White.  The fifth generation introduced a sleek, Black iPod Classic while the sixth generation replaced the White units with a new Silver device.\rIt wasn't until the sixth generation that Apple deemed these larger, original models as their iPod Classic line.  This sixth generation model improved on pretty much all hardware-based errors from earlier models, and for the first time, released as a 160GB model, the largest yet. \n"}, {"text": "The Nano line was slated to replace which existing iPod product?", "correct": "iPod Mini", "options": ["iPod 2", "iPod Photo", "iPod Classic"], "explanation": "\n\n\niPod Mini.\n\n\tThe iPod Mini was only released for two generations, the first being a 4GB model and the second being released in 4GB and 6GB models.  This iteration in the iPod line was one of the first to have various different colours (silver, pink, green, gold, and blue).\rIn 2005, Apple replaced its Mini products with the iPod Nano.  The Nano, despite the fact that was initially smaller in terms of a hard drive, was also much thinner in size.  Nonetheless, the iPod Mini was a significant product line in the iPod family due to the fact that it introduced the traditional iPod click wheel.  This wheel has since been a staple in all iPod products due to its ease of use and functionality. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these was the last to be released?", "correct": "iPod Nano", "options": ["iPod Classic (10GB)", "iPod Shuffle", "iPod Mini (2nd Generation)"], "explanation": "\n\n\niPod Nano.\n\n\tThe first generation of iPod Nanos were released in September 2005 though the 1GB Nano was released a short time after.  Emphasizing the idea of a more portable MP3 device, the Nano was one of the thinnest units to hit the market in its time.  At less than 7 mm thick, the unit was much skinnier and slimmer than the original, bulky iPod Classic devices and the somewhat small iPod Minis they set out to replace (though iPod Minis were still 13 mm thick).\rOriginally, the iPod Nano was only released in black and white, though future generations capitalized off trendy, non-monochromatic colours for style and variation purposes.  By the fourth generation, iPod Nanos would be able to hold 16GB-worth of songs and files.  The 2GB Nano had been discontinued by the third generation.\riPod Shuffles were originally sent to the public in early 2005 while Minis halted production before the Nanos even began their sales.  The iPod Classic 10GB was only sold in the Classic's second and third generation, from 2002-2004, before it was replaced by larger units. \n"}, {"text": "The fourth generation iPod Nano was introduced in 2008.  If you don't want to shuffle songs automatically or by touching the click wheel, what can you do (with a new feature) to change and shuffle your music?", "correct": "Shake the device", "options": ["Turn the device upside-down", "Shuffling was not an optional feature in this generation", "Spin the iPod in a circle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShake the device.\n\n\tThe fourth generation of iPod Nanos was released in 2008 and quickly became the top-selling release for the company to that date.  With an ad campaign exhibiting the 'nano-chromatic', colourful unit line, consumers could choose from black, silver, purple, blue, green, red, orange, yellow, and pink units ranging from 4GB to 16GB.\rThe shuffle feature had been around for a long time before the Nano 4G, particularly in the iPod's 'Shuffle' line, but until this point in time, the 'shaker' feature had not been included in the device.  Additionally, if the option is set to 'on', buyers can turn their iPod horizontally to automatically switch to the Cover Flow view (first introduced in the third generation of Nano units).  Because of the 4G's longer screen, videos are viewed when the iPod is turned horizontally. \n"}, {"text": "Users of the first generation iPod Shuffle could not connect their unit to a PC without a firewire cable.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe original iPod Shuffle was released in early 2005.  These small units have no screens, so much of what's contained on them must be memorized.  Users do not need a firewire cable because the unit comes with a built-in USB connector, allowing them to connect to the computer without any of the extra hook-ups.  Songs will automatically fill the device at random if chosen to, otherwise organized playlists can be used.\rDue to the USB connectivity, the iPod Shuffle has the capability of storing documents and photos much like a flash device.  Of course, none of these can be accessed whatsoever until the device is plugged into a Mac or PC. \n"}, {"text": "Which significant design feature was introduced in the second generation iPod Shuffle?", "correct": "A clip-on apparatus", "options": ["Un-removable headphones attached to the unit", "A device lock", "A removable silicon case"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA clip-on apparatus.\n\n\tThe second iPod Shuffle unit was physically redesigned in 2006.  This time, rather than the slender unit seen in the first generation, the Shuffle was rebuilt to be a small, square unit with a clip on the back for clothing and belts.  In addition, rather than holding a mere 512MB of songs and files, the second generation could hold 1GB or 2GB worth of songs.  Since its inception, the second generation of iPods have had nine different colours (five original colours and four redesigned looks released in 2008).\rUnlike the first generation USB unit, the second generation Shuffle requires a dock and USB cable to connect to a PC or Mac.  Like its predecessor, the 2G device has no screen or click wheel. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these features was not available on the iPod Touch?", "correct": "Click wheel", "options": ["Cover flow", "Song shuffling", "Wi-Fi connectivity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClick wheel.\n\n\tThe iPod Touch was create with the iPhone in mind.  This unit features a single, physical button on its front face designed to navigate to and from the menu screen.  In addition, the iPod Touch is able to make use of numerous applications, all of which are designed to use the touch capabilities of the device.\rMuch like the original units in the iPod line, the device is primarily used to store music and movies.  Both the first and second generations of iPod Touch have been released in 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB, and only in one colour.\rDue to the fact that the iPod Touch has Wi-Fi capabilities, it can link up to the internet (as long as it receives a signal) and use the Safari browser.  Because of this, the Touch can stream videos as well as browse, so widescreen Youtube compatibility is included. \n"}, {"text": "Which Apple product was named 'Invention of the Year' by \"Time Magazine\" in 2007?", "correct": "iPhone", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\niPhone.\n\n\tPerhaps one of the most sought-after phones ever made at the time of its release, the Apple iPhone sold over thirteen million phones within its first year and a half on the market.  Sold in the United States exclusively through AT&T, the second generation of the iPhone runs of the 3G network, allowing for faster-speed service, less dropped calls, and better data transmission speeds.  In addition to the phone and texting aspect, the phone features a touch screen, a camera, and the ability to make use of applications downloaded online.\rCoincidentally, underneath all the phone, data, internet, and add-ons, this device also plays music.  Though the iPhone doesn't typically hold as many songs as the iPod Classic (despite being about the same size), it runs on par with the fourth-generation iPod Nanos in terms of capacity (of 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB models).\rIn North America, the phone is strictly GSM making use of the EDGE network, and because of this it requires the use of a SIM Card. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the computer application associated with iPod connectivity, music, and downloads?", "correct": "iTunes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\niTunes.\n\n\tAlthough originally made for use solely on Macs and Apple Products, \"iTunes\" can be downloaded to any Mac or Windows computer system as a media player and application.  When a user connects the iPods to \"iTunes\", they can sync their music, download podcasts, organize playlists and tracks, and visit the iTunes Store.\rSince its inception, the iTunes Store has been a rather large influence on the music world.  Because of its system used to purchase music legally over the internet, the downloaded files from this store are used to determine music trends and popular tracks.  Many singles and EPs will also be released exclusively through the iTunes Store for customers as opposed to being released in shops because of the technology and popularity.  Due to their swaying influence on music-listeners, iTunes will also tend to support independent artists as well as their own personal tastes.\rCoincidentally, iPod commercials tend to feature independent music which later fuels otherwise unknown bands into the spotlight.  Such bands include The Fratellis, The Ting Tings, and Feist, all of which sold numerous copies of their CD and single releases. \n"}]}
