{"id": "334703", "name": "\"Jersey Shore\" - Season 1 Quiz | Jersey Shore | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television H-K", "Jersey Shore"], "questions": [{"text": "In the first episode of the show, \"A New Family\", eight people moved into a house on the Jersey Shore.  What was the name of their landlord?", "correct": "Danny", "options": ["Mike", "Roger", "Emilio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDanny.\n\n\tThe first episode of the show introduced the four Guidos and four Guidettes who moved into a shore house in Seaside Heights, New Jersey.  Each one of the participants in this show had their own reasons for heading to Jersey...little would they know the viewers would flock to see their exploits.\r On the first day, all eight of the housemates moved into their new house for the summer and arrived one at a time to find their beds and settle in.  Unsurprisingly, they broke out the booze in record time to begin drinking.  Snooki ended up shocking everyone with her party-going attitude; quite the outgoing girl, she ended up drinking a bit too much and stripping down to her underwear to hop into the hot tub and make out with the guys.  To say the least, it wasn't her best first impression.\r Meanwhile, Mike ('The Situation') expressed his feelings toward dating Sammi while the landlord, Danny, laid down the rules and told them about their summer jobs at the t-shirt shop on the boardwalk.  Most of the housemates found themselves working at the shop within their first days on the shore.  Snooki was late for orientation, Angelina complained a fair bit, and Mike and Sammi missed the first club night because of work.\r ...and it was only beginning. \n"}, {"text": "The first episode of the show introduced a fairly popular motif on the show.  What was the shape of the shore house phone?", "correct": "Duck", "options": ["Hamburger", "Leaning Tower", "Pizza"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuck.\n\n\tThe premiere episode of the show was also the first to introduce the Duck Phone.  When Snooki passed out, the others went to the Boardwalk to take their first look at their surroundings.  Snooki ended up waking up when they went out and phoned her father on the house phone (which quacked like a duck when somebody called it!)  Snooki had her fair share of problems understanding how to work the device, accidentally placing it onto the table and putting it on hold, hanging it up involuntarily, etc.\r Meanwhile, the others watched as a small romance between The Situation and Sammi developed and the guys made fun of JWoww having a boyfriend.  Later, on the first club night, JWoww and Pauly D hooked up.\r The group also had their first 'family dinner' as Snooki went out of her way to apologize for the bad first impression.  On the second night, the guys called three girls off the boardwalk to spend time in the hot tub and Mike hooked up with a random girl inside.  Angelina was less-than-impressed and decided to start a conflict.  This process would repeat itself on subsequent nights. \n"}, {"text": "In episode two, \"The Tanned Triangle\", the housemates spent their first club night at which Jersey Shore hotspot?", "correct": "Karma", "options": ["Beachcombers", "Headliners", "Bamboo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKarma.\n\n\tSnooki decided to pack up her stuff to leave during this same night but she rescinded her decision at the last moment while the gang planned their first club night at Karma.\r Vinny got pink eye (don't ask), Pauly D and JWoww started dancing together (though JWoww left the club afraid of cheating on her boyfriend) and Ronnie showed his true feelings for Sammi at Bamboo, surprising Mike and causing drama.  This night started a fight in the streets between the housemates and some local club-goers...definitely not the last on the show.\r I think the most important thing to note was that Ronnie demolished his own mantra of \"you never fall in love at the Jersey Shore\" about three days in.  By the end of the first Bamboo night, Mike was fed up with Sammi, Angelina had continued to distance herself from Mike and others, and Ron and Sammi stayed up together to watch the sunrise. \n"}, {"text": "In episode three, \"Good Riddance\", which housemate decided to leave the house?", "correct": "Angelina", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAngelina.\n\n\tAs episode three rolled around, Ron and Sammi started moving into their relationship while JWoww dealt with hers.  After fooling around with Pauly, JWoww felt the obligation to inform Tommy, her boyfriend...but not quite yet.\r Angelina's girlfriends stopped in to party with the housemates at the club and Angelina let her boyfriend in on the plan so that he could meet her there.  At Headliners, Angelina and her boyfriend (Mike) broke up.  The next day, Angelina showed her apathy towards work at the t-shirt shop and her frustration at the shore house and she decided to pack her (trash) bags and leave.  Everyone seemed fine with that.\r Eventually, JWoww caved and called Tommy to tell him the truth.  He hung up the phone on her and that was it.  And then she was single.\r Snooki and her best friend, Ryder, decided to go out and drink at a bar on the boardwalk and they returned to the shore house to spend time in the hot tub.  The guys were thrilled.  Meanwhile, Sam and Ron went miniature golfing and go-karting on the boardwalk, the guys nearly blew up the barbecue, and there was more clubbing at Karma.\r ...and then there was drama.  Ronnie started dancing with a girl after Vinnie brought him to the dance floor, Sam gave a friend a number out of spite, and Ron saw this and went home in anger.  To console Ronnie, JWoww went back to talk to him.  When Sammi found out, she decided to prepare for a fight. \n"}, {"text": "In the show's fourth episode, \"Fade to Black\", which housemate was punched in the face?", "correct": "Snooki", "options": ["Ronnie", "JWoww", "Mike ('The Situation')"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnooki.\n\n\tSammi returned to shore house after the events at Karma to argue with Ronnie.  The two of them ended up making up in the end realizing how much they valued each others friendship.\r The next couple days led up to the guys' first haircut ritual, some gym-time, and work at the Shore Store.  Snooki showed her true party-loving self at Karma and impressed the others with her attitude and the guys \"beat dat beat\" on the dance floor.  The guys tried to get things heated up back home in the hot tub until a second set of girls (invited by Mike and Pauly) showed up at the house and they had to make a decision.  In the end, they forced the first girls out and Pauly played the wingman...until one of the girls (regarded as a 'grenade') started causing problems.  Meanwhile, Snooki spent her night laying on the beach with a guy whose name she couldn't remember.\r Perhaps the key moment of this fourth episode was the very end.  While enjoying drinks at a bar, a number of the housemates started arguing over drinks with another customer.  This inevitably led to Snooki being punched in the face over a couple of stolen shots. \n"}, {"text": "In episode five, \"Just Another Day at the Shore\", one housemate got into a fight because someone called Snooki fat.  Who was the one in the fight this time?", "correct": "JWoww", "options": ["Ronnie", "Vinny", "Sammi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJWoww.\n\n\tConsidering the punch to the face at the end of the previous episode, Snooki finally felt closer to her roommates as they came to her aid to protect her at Beachcombers after she tried to protect them (well...their shots).  Ronnie was angry with Mike's approach to the situation and Snooki received a call that her attacker had been released from prison on bail.\r The next day, Ronnie's family stopped in for lunch and Sammi was introduced to his parents and younger brother during an afternoon on the boardwalk.  In the meantime, Jenni took Snooki out for afternoon drinks (and Snooki needed a straw).\r Pauly decided to call in to Carmine, the owner of Karma, to ask if he could DJ on one occasion and the housemates enjoyed a lobster dinner (to which said it was \"disgusting; they're alive when you kill it\").  As a result of Mike's attitude after dinner, some of the housemates started to get the feeling he really didn't care about anyone else.\r At Bamboo, one of the girls in the club called Snooki fat and this provoked JWoww to fight to defend her girlfriend.  They decided to go to Karma the next night and Vinny inadvertently stole the boss' girl, Tonya.  It wasn't until they were walking back to the shore house that Vinny realized she was going out with Danny.  That didn't bode well... \n"}, {"text": "\"Boardwalk Blowups\" was the sixth episode of the show.  Who ended up participating in the altercation on the boardwalk?", "correct": "Ronnie", "options": ["JWoww", "Vinny", "Pauly D"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRonnie.\n\n\tVinny began worrying about his 'robbery' the previous night.  While the guys went out to perform their routine of gym, tanning, laundry (GTL), Vinny headed to work and spoke to Danny (who told him to pack up his stuff).  Everything turned out fine, though.  When he got home he started talking on the duck phone with Mike's sister, Melissa.  The minute she walked in the door for a night of clubbing, Vinny wasn't too thrilled- she looked like Mike.  Vinny eventually gave in, realizing that Melissa had a personality.\r On the way back home from the club, while playfully joking around in the taxi, Ron and Sam got into a rather major spat about her 'Flintstone big toe'...even though she started by calling him names.  The same night, after a series of rather uneventful smaller fights, Ronnie decided to be spiteful and to creep on the boardwalk\r The same night, Mike ran into a girl, Alex, who came back to the house a few weeks earlier (with her friend).  Unfortunately, when invited back, she brought the same angry friend and another, larger friend (a grenade who Snooki referred to as a \"charging hippo\") and they caused a fight on the balcony until the police showed up.\r The next day, Vinny cleaned up the house to prepare for a family visit, and being from a typical, close-knit Sicilian family, a horde of people arrived, mostly extended family, for a rather large meal.  Everyone felt at home.\r That night at Beachcombers, some of the guys ended up having issues with a guy at the bar who wanted to cause waves and, perhaps, start a fight.  When Ronnie and Sammi ended up walking home, he followed them along the boardwalk until he provoked a fight out of Ron.  The two battled along the boardwalk (and the house was notified) until the police were called and Ronnie headed home to avoid any more issues.  Although they were tense for a while after the fight, Ron and Sam eventually made up. \n"}, {"text": "In \"What Happens in AC\", the gang went to Atlantic City.  Snooki revealed that she used to have which of these?", "correct": "An eating problem", "options": ["A polyamorous relationship", "A fiance", "A restraining order"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn eating problem.\n\n\tAfter their making up, Sam and Ron realized that Snooki was complaining about their not spending time.  Sammi realized that she shouldn't be trusting Snooki anymore (even after apologies); Snooki and Jenny just wanted things to go back to normal; everyone else had no idea there was even an issue.\r After an argument with Mike, Vinny decided to bring Mike's sister home from the club.  Meanwhile, Sam got angry with Ron for talking to a girl at the club as a result of Mike's instigation.  Ronnie recommended that she shouldn't be trusting Mike either.  Pauly met a girl named Danielle at the club who turned out to be big on eating kosher and following the Jewish faith.  Suffice to say that didn't last long.\r The following night, everyone went out for an overnight trip to Atlantic City staying at the Tropicana.  Upon arriving, everyone took a nap while Snooki had a jacuzzi bubble bath.  Everyone went out for a luxurious dinner and it didn't take long before everyone started taking shots at one another.  It didn't take long before Snooki got angry at Mike and he retaliated with a joke about her weight.  In the washroom, while being consoled by Jenni, she confessed to weighing seventy pounds in high school.\r At the club in Atlantic City, Mike pulled a robbery on one of the girls spending time with Vinny and then refused to bring a heavily-intoxicated, sick JWoww back to the room (and got her kicked out).  When he got back to the room later on in the night, Jenny back-handed him in the face. \n"}, {"text": "In the penultimate episode of the season, \"One Shot\", who took the well-placed one shot at the end of the episode?", "correct": "Ronnie", "options": ["Snooki", "Mike ('The Situation')", "Sammi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRonnie.\n\n\tAfter an eventful night in Atlantic City, the housemates returned to the Jersey Shore.  Jenni tried to speak to her boyfriend about the previous night, but he criticized her for drinking too much.  Pauly and Vinny decided to head to the boardwalk to meet some girls, and Pauly's Jewish girlfriend, Danielle, ended up coming across them there.  When Danielle found him later on, she ended up 'stalking' him and giving him a shirt saying 'I (heart) Jewish Girls'.  Pauly decided to cut it off- he called her out for stalking and broke up over the phone.\r Mike and Pauly decided to prank Snooki by placing pickles under her bed and then Vinny by sneaking a disgusting, smelly concoction of food under his.  Snooki knew who it was immediately; she was just angry that they wasted the pickles.  It took Vinny a while longer to find the bowl under his bed.\r The housemates decided to go bowling and, while enjoying themselves, Jenny decided to apologize to Mike.  Everyone also decided to go to Karma for a fun night (and Danielle ran into Pauly, somehow).  Snooki had problems with guys and, when they all decided to leave, some girls decided to make fun of her.  Some guy ended up trying to fight with Ronnie and, before the night ended, he took one swing and knocked the guy out.  That's when the cops came along to take Ronnie away for aggravated assault. \n"}, {"text": "In the finale, \"That's How The Shore Goes\", what was the name of the cowboy Snooki wanted to date?", "correct": "Keith", "options": ["Roger", "Joey", "Tommy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeith.\n\n\tThe episode started with the housemates worried about Ronnie.  After he was taken to the Seaside Heights jail for aggravated assault, the housemates called in to find that he would be up for bail early that morning.  Everyone slept through his bail time (at 6:30) having been hungover from the events of the previous night.  Eventually, Sammi went to pick him up.\r As their last nights crept up on them, the guys had one more boy's night out, Snooki tried to have a date with Keith, and she and Jenny tried to hunt down some gorilla juiceheads.  Everyone spent an afternoon on the beach as a group (for the first time) and Ron and Sam had a fancy final dinner and toast to their relationship beyond the shore.\r Mike found Snooki crying on the balcony over her ex and he convinced her to enjoy herself instead.  The two of them ended up kissing in the jacuzzi on their second-last night.  On their last day at the shore, everyone settled down as a group to enjoy dinner and they discussed their memories from the last month.  Everyone vowed to do it again (of course).\r The next day, everyone packed up and said their goodbyes before leaving the house one by one. \n"}]}
