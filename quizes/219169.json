What is the name of the beautiful maid she portrays?", "correct": "Maid Jean", "options": ["Maid Susan", "Maid Eleanor", "Maid Patricia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaid Jean.\n\n\tLovely Glynis Johns, also appearing in 'The Seekers', 'The Sword and the Rose' and 'Mary Poppins', was known as 'The Girl with the Upside-Down Eyes', probably because her eyes were so gorgeous.
