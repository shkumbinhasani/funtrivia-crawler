'Blues Boy' King", "options": ["John Lee Hooker", "Stevie Ray Vaughan", "Gary Moore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiley B. 'Blues Boy' King\n\n\tBlues music is a rich source for songs with lyrics about hate, I suppose it must be the subject matter!\rIt was in 1949, whilst King was playing at a dance in a club in Arkansas when two men, fighting over a woman, knocked over a heater and started a fire.  The building was evacuated and King, who discovered that he had left his beloved guitar inside, dashed back into the burning building to rescue his instrument.  Having done so he realised how stupid he had been to put his life at risk for something that could be so easily replaced, especially after it was later revealed that two people had died in the fire.  After finding out that the woman that the two men had been fighting over was called 'Lucille', he swore that all his instruments would be named 'Lucille' so as to remind him of how foolish he had been to risk his life over a cheap guitar and that no woman was worth fighting over. \n"}, {"text": "This savoury spread, a by-product of the brewing industry, mounted a highly successful advertising campaign using the catchphrase, 'You either love it or you hate it'.  Under which name is this spread marketed?", "correct": "Marmite", "options": ["Angel Delight", "Branston Pickle", "Nutella"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarmite.\n\n\tMarmite, a yeast extract, is made from spent yeast from the brewing industry and was first made in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire in 1902.  It is rich in 'B' vitamins and, although it has a meat-like flavour, it is suitable for vegetarians.  Marmite is similar, but far, far tastier than the antipodean imposter, Vegemite (only kidding!)  I know what you're all thinking; does he love it or hate it himself?  I'm firmly in the 'love it' camp.  You just cannot beat a couple of hot toasted crumpets, smothered with unsalted butter and lightly smeared with Marmite... Bliss! \n"}, {"text": "President George H. W. Bush didn't say that he hated this, not in as many words anyway, but it's clear that he had an intense dislike for it. What was it that he disliked so much?", "correct": "Broccoli", "options": ["Brussels sprouts", "Toasted cheese", "Mashed potatoes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBroccoli.\n\n\tGeorge H. W. Bush, forty-first President of the United States, hates broccoli!  On April 9th 1990 during a speech at state dinner for the Polish leader Tadeusz Mazowiecki, he declared \"Just as Poland had a rebellion against totalitarianism, I am rebelling against broccoli, and I refuse to give ground,\" adding immediately afterwards that \"I do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it. And I'm President of the United States, and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli\".  His comments caused some furore amongst growers of broccoli in the United States, so much so, that an attempt to deliver a truckload of ten tons of the stuff was made.  \r Personally, I don't mind broccoli as long as it's not overcooked, but what is that smell about?! \n"}, {"text": "'No Fear, No Hate, No Pain (No Broken Hearts)', is a song featured on the album 'Touch' from which British electro-pop duo of the 1980s?", "correct": "Eurythmics", "options": ["Joy Division", "The Human League", "Tubeway Army"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEurythmics.\n\n\tEurythmics, consisting of band members Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox, have been stalwarts of the British pop music scene for over thirty years, either as individual performers or as members of various bands.  Formed from former members of 'The Catch' (Stewart) and 'The Tourists' (Lennox and Stewart), Eurythmics was formed in 1980 and disbanded a decade later.There have been reunions, usually short-lived, including one that took place in 1999 and lasted until 2005.  Their most successful hit single is 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' which was released in 1983 and was a hit all over the world.  Other gems recorded by Eurythmics include 1982's 'Love Is A Stranger', 'Here Comes The Rain Again' released in 1985 and which reached number eight on the UK chart and their only UK number one hit single, again from 1985, 'There Must Be An Angel (Playing With My Heart)'.    \n"}, {"text": "The character 'La Haine', the embodiment of hate, appears in 'Armide', a 'trag\u00e9die lyrique' penned by which composer to the court of King Louis XIV?", "correct": "Jean-Baptiste Lully", "options": ["Claudio Monteverdi", "Claude Debussy", "Georg-Phillip Telemann"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJean-Baptiste Lully.\n\n\tJean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687), a Florentine born composer, spent the majority of his career as court composer to 'The Sun King', Louis XIV of France.  The tale behind the opera 'Armide', written in collaboration with his librettist Philippe Quinault and first performed in 1686, is based on the poem 'Gerusalemme Liberata' which was very popular during the 17th century. Armide, or Armida, the beautiful niece of Hidraoth, King of Damascus, is a sorceress who becomes enraged by the indifference to her beauty of the Christian knight Rinaldo and she decides to kill him.  Unfortunately, she comes to realise that she has fallen in love with him and so, she casts a spell to force him to fall in love with her. Tormented by her love for Rinaldo and her realisation that he only loves her because of the spell she has cast, her hate for him grows and grows, an emotion which eventually results in her own self-destruction. \n"}, {"text": "Many have been carried out throughout history, often against religious or ethnic minorities. These periods of state-sanctioned hate crime are known as 'Diaspora'.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThese periods known as 'Pogroms', and which have historically been directed against the Jewish community, although not exclusively so, are named for a word taken from the Russian language that means to 'destroy', 'wreak havoc' or 'demolish'.  Perhaps the pogrom of modern times with which most will be familiar is 'Kristallnacht' - 'Night of Broken Glass' - which took place overnight on the 9th and 10th of November 1938. Around 90 Jews were killed, over a thousand synagogues were burned and Jewish businesses all over Germany were looted.  Pogroms have taken place since time immemorial and are usually characterised by brutality and murder.  Notable pogroms have also taken place against non-Jewish communities such as in Nigeria against the Igbo people during 1966, against the Armenians during the 1920s, and the Greek community in and around Istanbul, Turkey during 1955.\rThe word 'diaspora' can be defined as a 'scattering' of a nation or people who remain connected by a sense of nationhood and of homeland.  It was originally used to describe the exile of the Jews from Israel that began in around the 6th century BCE.  In more recent times it has become used to describe a migration of peoples; examples of this might include the migration of the Irish and the Scots during the 18th and 19th centuries to the United States. \n"}, {"text": "'Love is a word that is constantly heard, \nHate is a word that is not'\n\nThese are the first two lines of a humorous poem written by whom? \n", "correct": "Ogden Nash", "options": ["W B Yeats", "e.e. cummings", "Ezra Pound"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOgden Nash.\n\n\t'Love is a word that is constantly heard, \rHate is a word that is not. \rLove, I am told, is more precious than gold. \rLove, I have read, is hot. \rBut Hate is the verb that to me is superb, \rAnd Love but a drug on the mart. \rAny kiddie in school can Love like a fool, \rBut Hating, my boy, is an Art'.\r Frederic Ogden Nash, born in 1902, is renowned for being one of the United States' greatest writers of humorous poetry.  A wit in the same league, at least in this authors opinion, as Oscar Wilde, some of Nash's funniest quotes are 'Women would rather be right than reasonable' and 'Happiness is having a scratch for every itch'.  Nash spent the greater part of his life in Baltimore of which he once wrote 'I could have loved New York, but I loved Balti-more'.  He must have enjoyed 'Balti-more' as he died there on the 19th of May 1971 at 68 years of age, having lived there for thirty-seven years. \n"}, {"text": "In 2004, which far eastern vehicle manufacturer launched a highly successful advertising campaign with a short animated film accompanied by a song that began with the line; 'Here's a little song for anyone who's ever hated, in the key of Grrr'?", "correct": "Honda", "options": ["Lexus", "Audi", "Chevrolet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHonda.\n\n\t'Hate Something, Change Something'... This advertisement from the automobile manufacturing giant, Honda, was one in a series attempting to extol the virtues of their new i-CTDi diesel engine.  Filmed in a style reminiscent of films such as the Beatles 'Yellow Submarine', Honda set out to show the traditional, oily diesel engine, belching thick black smoke and polluting the environment, as something to hate and their new clean burning diesel as the way forward; almost as something that might protect the environment. Very colourful and beautifully animated, the films proved to be very popular. \n"}, {"text": "Which Englishman, of the late 17th century, so hated the Catholic Church that his perjury condemned thirty five innocent men to death, one of whom suffered his death by being hanged, drawn and quartered?", "correct": "Titus Oates", "options": ["Samuel Pepys", "Oliver Cromwell", "Richard Dawkins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTitus Oates.\n\n\tTitus Oates (1649-1705) of Oakham, not only hated the church himself, in particular the Jesuit Order, but was hated by everyone that knew him in turn.  A thoroughly despicable individual, Oates was responsible for instigating the 'Popish Plot', a threat against King Charles II during 1678.  The plot was a fantasy invented by Oates in order to ingratiate himself with the king. It was ignored at first as Oates had already gained a somewhat unsavoury reputation as a cheat, liar and blasphemer but after he was able to produce handwritten evidence by a known papist, his aim was achieved.  English society at the time fell for his fantasy plan, fearing the repercussions against the protestant population by a catholic king James should he ascend to the throne. After his perjury was proven Oates was sent to prison for life with an additional order that he be whipped at regular intervals.  In 1688 Oates was released from prison by the orders of King William III.  In time, Oates eventually fell into obscurity and died on July 12th 1705. \n"}, {"text": "Hated and loved by many in equal measure, which world leader passed away at the Ritz Hotel, London on the 8th of April 2013 after suffering a stroke?", "correct": "Margaret Thatcher", "options": ["Raisa Gorbachova", "Winnie Mandela", "Mary Robinson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret Thatcher.\n\n\tMargaret Hilda Roberts was born in the town of Grantham, Lincolnshire on the 13th of October 1925.  Prior to entering politics, Margaret was a research chemist and additionally had qualified as a barrister in 1953.  She was elected as MP for the constituency of Finchley on the 8th of October 1959, a post she held until her retirement in 1992.  As Secretary of State for education and Science between 1970 and 1974 under PM Edward Heath, she became reviled as 'Margaret Thatcher, milk snatcher' due to her withdrawal of free milk to all school children between the ages of seven and eleven.  \r In 1975 she became the leader of the Conservative Party after defeating Heath and his preferred choice of successor, Willie Whitelaw. She the post held until the end of November 1990.  During her tenure as Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher wrested the Falkland Islands from the Argentine invaders in 1982, greatly reduced the power of Britain's trade unions and broke the miners during their strike of 1984, two achievements that made her very popular in the southern half of the United Kingdom, but hated with a passion by those living and working in the industrial north.  Everything started to go wrong for Mrs Thatcher with her party's introduction of the hated 'Poll Tax' during 1990, so much so, that by the end of the year she had been replaced as leader of her party and had returned to what are known as the 'back benches'.  Few who saw them will forget the pictures, flashed around the world, of a tearful Margaret being driven away from Downing Street after her loss of her party's leadership.  It is difficult to give a brief account of the effect on British society and on the world in general that the 'Iron Lady' had, suffice to say that the effects of her policies will be felt for decades to come. \n"}]}
