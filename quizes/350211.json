{"id": "350211", "name": "I, Everdeen Online Trivia | Collins, Suzanne | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Collins, Suzanne", "The Hunger Games (1st book)"], "questions": [{"text": "From District 1 was a beautiful girl named Glimmer. What creature caused her demise, though I, Katniss Everdeen, survived the attack?", "correct": "Tracker Jacker", "options": ["Wolf Mutt", "Jabberjay", "Groosling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTracker Jacker.\n\n\tI recall dropping the tracker jacker nest on the Careers, but I also suffered from the attack. A nice girl nursed me back to health, but Glimmer and her friend were not so lucky. The tracker jackers caused two deaths during the battle. \n"}, {"text": "I, Katniss Everdeen, will never forget the boy from District 2: Cato. His death had to be the worst for me. His cries of pain lasted forever, and it was the most awful thing to witness.\n\nWhere, and how, did Cato die?", "correct": "In the Cornucopia, shot by an arrow", "options": ["In the lake, drowned", "At the Career's camp, due to an explosion", "In the forest, eaten by wolf muttations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the Cornucopia, shot by an arrow.\n\n\tWhen only three contestants remained (me [I'm Katniss, if you recall], Peeta, and Cato), wolf muttations where unleashed upon us. We scrambled to the Cornucopia, but Cato did not make it on top. He was being eaten slowly by the muttations. He was in pain, and begged me to shoot him with an arrow, so I did; his was the final death of the 74th Hunger Games. \n"}, {"text": "The male tribute from District 3 had a unique ability. He was not a Career, but was an ally due to this ability. What could he do that kept him from being killed by the Careers during the 74th Hunger Games?", "correct": "He was able to reactivate land mines", "options": ["He could hit any target with a knife", "He knew what kind of plants were edible", "He could smell enemies coming before they could be seen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was able to reactivate land mines.\n\n\tThe boy was from District 3; I never caught his name. He was allied with the careers because of his skills with mines. At the beginning of the Games, these mines were active to prevent anyone from starting early. They were deactivated, and the Games began. This tribute, however, had the ability to reactivate the mines, using them to the Careers' advantage. Once this ability literally backfired on the Careers, they no longer had a need for this boy, and Cato snapped his neck. \n"}, {"text": "I, Katniss Everdeen, didn't intend for her to die this way, but the girl from District 5 died from eating poisonous berries. Who was she?", "correct": "Foxface", "options": ["Rue", "Clove", "Glimmer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFoxface.\n\n\tI never learned her real name, but I gave the girl from District 5 the nickname \"Foxface\", as her face resembled a fox when I first saw her. The name also went well with her strategy. She was as sly as a fox stealing food from others, just enough to survive, but not enough to arouse suspicion. \n"}, {"text": "I wish Rue never had to die. I saw her stabbed with a spear right before my eyes. I saw the one who did it, and I shot him in the neck with an arrow for killing my friend.\n\nBy what name did I, Katniss Everdeen, learn that this malefactor was called?", "correct": "It was not revealed in this book", "options": ["Peets", "Thresh", "Cato"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was not revealed in this book.\n\n\tAlthough I did not learn his name until the second book in the series, \"Catching Fire\", I saw Marvel catch Rue with a net trap. I heard her crying for me, but I was too late. I watched as the spear went through her. I was so upset with Marvel that I shot him in the neck with an arrow. \n"}, {"text": "When Rue died, the male tribute from Distict 11 was quite upset. When I was about to be killed, he saved me, and let me go because of what I, Katniss Everdeen, did for Rue. He died two days later, but not by my hands. Who was he?", "correct": "Thresh", "options": ["Cato", "Peeta", "Marvel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThresh.\n\n\tThresh was a tall, muscular boy from District 11. He avenged Rue's death by killing Clove for me, and letting me escape. He also led Cato towards himself instead of me, and died just two days later, no doubt at the hands of Cato himself. \n"}, {"text": "Clove died very near me, practically on top of me, though I, Katniss Everdeen, had nothing to do with her death. By what means did she die?", "correct": "Skull crushed by a rock", "options": ["Shot in the eye with an arrow", "Stabbed in the heart with a sword", "Eaten by wolf muttations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkull crushed by a rock.\n\n\tClove was on top of me, about to cause a slow and painful death, when Thresh came to my aid. He was mad at Clove, believing it was her who had killed Rue. He smashed her head in with a rock, and let me escape. \n"}, {"text": "Usually, the Careers make it through the first day of the Hunger Games. Which one was unfortunate enough not to survive the initial bloodbath?", "correct": "Boy from District 4", "options": ["Boy from District 2", "Girl from District 2", "Girl from District 1"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoy from District 4.\n\n\tI was unable to learn many competitor's names, including that of the boy from District 4. All I know is that he was the only Career not to make it through the first day. \n"}, {"text": "On the first day, the boy from District 9 was killed because someone threw a knife in his back. Who did it?", "correct": "Clove", "options": ["I, Katniss Everdeen", "Foxface", "Glimmer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClove.\n\n\tClove knew how to handle a knife; she never missed her target. Shortly after the death of this boy, I took his backpack and ran. Clove chased me, and threw a knife at me as well. She was not able to kill me, though, since I used the backpack as a shield. The knife was lodged, so I got to keep it. It came in quite handy. \n"}, {"text": "The initial bloodbath was brutal, and both tributes of three different Districts died on the first day. Which of these Districts had a survivor of the bloodbath from the 74th Hunger Games?", "correct": "District 10", "options": ["District 6", "District 7", "District 9"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDistrict 10.\n\n\tDistricts 6, 7, and 9 were all out after the initial bloodbath. The girl from District 8 survived the bloodbath, but didn't make it through the night. The boy from District 10 did a lot better; he hid until he was finally killed many days later, as one of the last ten survivors. \n"}]}
