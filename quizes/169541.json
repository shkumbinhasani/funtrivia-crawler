{"id": "169541", "name": "The Film History of Dustin Hoffman Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed E-K", " Dustin Hoffman"], "questions": [{"text": "One of Hoffman's first starring roles was as Benjamin in the 1967 classic 'The Graduate'.  What was his surname in this film?", "correct": "Braddock", "options": ["McGuire", "Robinson", "Singleman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBraddock.\n\n\tAt a rather young age, Dustin had already established himself as a marketable star and a serious actor.  The 29-year old Hoffman was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role as Benjamin Braddock, a recent, directionless college graduate.  This was one of seven nominations for the film. \n"}, {"text": "In 1969, Hoffman hit paydirt again with an Oscar nomination for his role as Enrico Salvatore 'Ratso' Rizzo in the film 'Midnight Cowboy'.  Did he win the Academy Award for this role?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAs with his first in 'The Graduate', Hoffman missed out on the Oscar in his second nomination as the street-smart Rizzo, opposite the naive country boy Joe Buck, played by Jon Voight.  John Schlesinger did win the award for Best Director, which was accepted on his behalf by Voight.  This X-rated film also won for Best Picture!  (The rating system was different at the time...the X-rating meant no one under 16-years old could attend.) \n"}, {"text": "In which film directed by the legendary Sam Peckinpah did Dustin Hoffman play the lead role?", "correct": "Straw Dogs", "options": ["The Getaway", "Junior Bonner", "The Killer Elite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStraw Dogs.\n\n\tPeckinpah's other work included 'The Getaway' with Steve McQueen, and 'The Wild Bunch'.  His only collaboration with Hoffman was in the 1971 thriller 'Straw Dogs'.  This was probably Hoffman's most violent film role, though by today's standards it seems rather not so shocking. \n"}, {"text": "Who wrote the original novel upon which the film 'Papillon', starring Hoffman alongside Steve McQueen', was based?", "correct": "Henri Charri\u00e8re", "options": ["Ana\u00efs Nin", "Emile Zola", "Albert Camus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenri Charri\u00e8re.\n\n\tHenri Charri\u00e8re's autobiographical novel 'Papillon' (French for 'butterfly') tells the story of Charri\u00e8re's escape attempts from a Guyanese penal colony, and later from the notorious French prison called Devil's Island.  Hoffman plays Charri\u00e8re's companion Louis Dega, who shares in the escape attempts. \n"}, {"text": "Lenny Bruce himself chose Dustin Hoffman to portray him in the 1974 bio-pic 'Lenny', based on the life of the famed dissident comic.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSadly, Lenny Bruce died in 1966, several years prior to the production of this picture that took a close look at his struggles with the censorship standards in the United States during the 1950s.  It was directed by Bob Fosse and the title role was brilliantly portrayed by Hoffman; both were nominated for Oscars (but did not win).  It was Hoffman's third nomination. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1976 film 'All the President's Men', Dustin Hoffman played Carl Bernstein alongside which actor's Bob Woodward?", "correct": "Robert Redford", "options": ["Paul Newman", "Gene Hackman", "Harrison Ford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Redford.\n\n\tBased on the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the film also starred Jack Warden, Hal Holbrook and Jason Robards.  Alan Pakula directed the film, which won four Oscars, including a Best Actor in a Supporting Role award for Robards.  Hoffman was not nominated for this role. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin Hoffman finally won his first Best Actor Oscar for his role in the 1979 film 'Kramer vs. Kramer'. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAfter three nominations and no wins, Hoffman finally struck Oscar gold on his fourth try with his role as divorc\u00e9 Ted Kramer.  The film also garnered Oscars for Meryl Streep for Best Supporting Actress and Robert Benton for Best Director.  It also garnered the big award of the evening, the Best Picture Oscar. \n"}, {"text": "In 1982, Hoffman played the dual roles of Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels in the magnificent comedy 'Tootsie'.  Hoffman also portrayed a character within a character, starring on a cheezy soap opera as a hospital director.  What was the name of this soap opera character?", "correct": "Emily Kimberly", "options": ["Edna Langtree", "Edith Newberg", "Erma Michaelson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmily Kimberly.\n\n\tEmily Kimberly became Edward Kimberly in the final scene filmed for the soap opera by the Dorothy Michaels character just before she revealed that her real name was Michael Dorsey, all portrayed by Hoffman.  Confused?  Me too!  Hoffman was again nominated for an Oscar for this role but he failed to win when the Academy couldn't decide whether to place him in the Best Actor or Best Actress category.  Only kidding...he was beaten out by Ben Kingsley for his role as Gandhi. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin Hoffman received an Oscar for his performance as the autistic Raymond Babbitt in the 1988 film 'Rain Man'.  Who directed Hoffman through this landmark performance?", "correct": "Barry Levinson", "options": ["Sydney Pollack", "Ron Underwood", "Alan Parker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarry Levinson.\n\n\tHoffman based his character largely on his observations of Kim Peek, an autistic man living in Salt Lake City.  He also observed the behavior of other autistic savants in the process of developing his character Raymond.  This was Hoffman's second Best Acting Oscar. \n"}, {"text": "In which film did Hoffman co-star alongside Julia Roberts and Robin Williams?", "correct": "Hook", "options": ["Dick Tracy", "Wag the Dog", "Billy Bathgate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHook.\n\n\tBased on the 'Peter Pan' story by James Barrie, this was not my favorite Hoffman film.  However, his performance was typically excellent, despite the lesser quality of the movie.  In 2004 Hoffman plays Charles Frohman in the film 'J.M. Barrie's Neverland', a biopic about the author of 'Peter Pan'.  Thank you for having played this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other stuff. \n"}]}
