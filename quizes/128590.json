Johns"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of the commander of Squadron 169 which is Biggles' first aquadron in France?", "correct": "Major Paynter", "options": ["Major Williams", "Major Mullen", "Major MacLaren"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor Paynter.\n\n\tBiggles starts his first combat missions in F.E.'s and his exploits are described in \"Biggles Learns to Fly\"? Major Mullen is his commander in 266 squadron which he transfers to later in the war. \n"}, {"text": "Biggles' first observer and gunner is called Mark Way. From which country in the British Empire did he come?", "correct": "New Zealand", "options": ["Canada", "Australia", "India"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Zealand.\n\n\tMark has been in the R.F.C. for three months but he is already very experienced in air-fighting.

Dusk and darkness are no use for photographs. It is a perfect example of Biggles' original thinking about things which other pilots treat as routine. \n"}, {"text": "What does Biggles decide to do about his week's leave after he shoots down von Kraudil?", "correct": "He will take it and go and see the injured Mark Way.", "options": ["He will reject it and go on looking for more German planes.", "He will take it and go and see Marie.", "He will take it and go and visit his brother Charles."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe will take it and go and see the injured Mark Way.\n\n\tVon Kraudil is the man who deliberately shot up Mapleton's plane after he had landed.

Later he realises that in the heat of conflict you simply haven't got time to work things out. However he comes up with many ingenious schemes - some of which work well. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Biggles of the Camel Squadron\" how does Henry think they can distract the gunners protecting the three balloons at Duneville?", "correct": "By throwing empty bottles out of their aeroplanes.", "options": ["By launching a new balloon of their own.", "By painting their machines the same colour as the Germans'.", "By him drawing fire while the others attack."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy throwing empty bottles out of their aeroplanes.\n\n\tAccording to Captain W.E.
