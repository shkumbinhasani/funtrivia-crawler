{"id": "407648", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 30\" [4] Quiz | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 30"], "questions": [{"text": "Leg 7 started in which country?", "correct": "Czech Republic", "options": ["Bulgaria", "Zimbabwe", "France"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCzech Republic.\n\n\tLeg 7 sent teams hurtling due south from Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, more than five thousand miles across Europe and Africa to the Zimbabwean capital city of Harare.  Leaving Letenske Park in the order they arrived, teams had to go and pick up their plane tickets and then, landing in Harare, teams needed to go to Harare Station and take a diesel train into the savannah to Marondera.  Their next destination was the Imire Rhino & Wildlife Conservancy. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these teams did not exist after the Partner Swap in Leg 7?", "correct": "Lucas and Evan", "options": ["Brittany and Alex", "Cody and Jen", "Henry and Eric"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLucas and Evan.\n\n\tReaching the Imire Rhino & Wildlife Conservancy, teams were told that they would need to spend time constructing their safari camps for the evening.  How fast they completed their bush camp would be critical since their approval times would affect their early departure times.  At 4:00am, to their surprise, teams were awoken by Phil and told they would be performing the first-ever Partner Swap of \"The Amazing Race\".  In the order they arrived, teams could choose a fellow team to swap with, dividing and pairing themselves up with the individuals of another duo for a series of tasks.  The new teams were as follows:\rCody and Jen/Jessica and Kristi\rLucas and Connor/Brittany and Alex\rHenry and Eric/Daniel and Evan \n"}, {"text": "Once Partner Swapped, teams needed to navigate Imire Lake via which means?", "correct": "Raft", "options": ["Fan-boat", "Motorboat", "Dugout canoe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaft.\n\n\tWith the teams split and remade, Phil sent them off to grab their first clue from the local guide.  For this task, 'new teams' needed to grab a makeshift raft and paddle out onto Imire Lake, searching the islands to find two canteens hanging from the trees.  These canteens would come along with them and be packed with their next clue.  With this, they could continue paddling a quarter mile to the opposite shore.  They would be able to snag their next clue, visible from the lookout tower found there. \n"}, {"text": "Which Leg 7 Detour task involved operating a stick-shift vehicle?", "correct": "'Bush Whack'", "options": ["'Rhino Track'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Bush Whack'.\n\n\tTeams finished paddling their canoes in time to locate the Detour task for the seventh leg, and their choice was a pair of limited-station offerings-- 'Rhino Track' and 'Bush Whack'.\rIn 'Rhino Track', teams needed to travel on horseback and locate eight items scattered in the nearby savannah, all evidence of rhino poachers, and bring them back to the starting point to place on a tracking map.  If they got all of them correct, they would get their next clue.  Brittany and Alex, Daniel and Evan, and Jessica and Kristi completed this task.\rIn 'Bush Whack', teams instead followed an off-road trail in a manual 4-by-4 to replenish a ranger's supply camp with fresh water and hardware.  If they could travel through the bogs and haul their way through, they could finish the task.  Cody and Jen, Henry and Eric, and Lucas and Conor completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "The seventh Pit Stop of the race, found in the Imire Rhino & Wildlife Conservancy, was non-elimination.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tNot only was it a non-elimination Pit Stop, but it was a keep-on-racing Pit Stop since two teams would step on the mat last (due to the Partner Swap).  After completing their Detour tasks, teams were informed that they would need to wait for their original partners and reunite before heading to the next Pit Stop at the Savannah Plains Overlook in the Imire Rhino & Wildlife Conservancy. Both Lucas and Brittany and Alex and Conor landed on the mat in first place, both taking their second wins of the race.  On the other side of this, Cody and Jessica and Kristi and Jen arrived in last place.  There were no prizes or penalties for any team. Instead, teams were given their first clues of Leg 8 and told to keep going. \n"}, {"text": "Teams found a Double U-Turn at the start of Leg 8 (in Harare).  Which team did not see or place their face on it?", "correct": "Eric and Daniel", "options": ["Cody and Jessica", "Lucas and Brittany", "Henry and Evan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEric and Daniel.\n\n\tTeams left the seventh Pit Stop immediately, hopping into safari shuttles and returning to the entrance of the Imire Rhino & Wildlife Conservancy to catch a cab.  From here, teams needed to drive back to the city of Harare and find Khan Fabrics, Haberdashery and Sports.  This wouldn't simply be where teams found their next clue; they would also be surprised by the appearance of the race's second Double U-Turn.  Here, both front-running teams used the device; Lucas and Brittany U-Turned Cody and Jessica while Alex and Conor U-Turned Henry and Evan. \n"}, {"text": "Which team elected to complete the 'Handle With Care' Detour task, delivering mail in Harare in Leg 8?", "correct": "Eric and Daniel", "options": ["Lucas and Brittany", "Kristi and Jen", "Alex and Conor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEric and Daniel.\n\n\tOnly Cody and Jessica and Eric and Daniel went for the 'Handle With Care' task at Harare's Eastgate Mall.  For this, they had to enter the building's mail room and grab seven different packages to deliver throughout the building.  If they could trade the deliveries for outgoing mail and return them to the mail room, they could receive their next clue.  Because they were U-Turned, Henry and Evan also had to finish this task. \n"}, {"text": "Teams completing the 'Just Get it There' Detour option in Leg 8 had to handle which of these in Harare's Magaba Market?", "correct": "Tyres", "options": ["Snakes", "Goats", "Ice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTyres.\n\n\tInstead of delivering mail for their Leg 8 Detour, teams could instead handle tyres if they so chose.  Lucas and Brittany, Alex and Conor, Henry and Evan, and Kristi and Jen headed to Magaba Market for this task which involved grabbing one large tyre and one smaller one and then rolling them a half mile through the market to a marked delivery truck to get their next clue.  Just like Henry and Evan with the other task, Cody and Jessica, U-Turned, needed to complete this one as well to keep racing. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 8, teams has to learn a popular Zimbabwean song, but in what language?", "correct": "Shona", "options": ["Swahili", "English", "Afrikaans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShona.\n\n\tComing out of their Detour tasks, teams were directed to the city's largest park, Harare Gardens, for one final task of this extra-length double leg.  There, teams partnered with a vocal coach to learn the lyrics to the song \"Pasi Pano Pane Zviedzo\".  In addition to learning the song phonetically (based on lyrics in the Shona language), teams also had to dance in rhythm, onstage, with a live band accompanying their performance.  If both team members could complete the song together, they could receive their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated from the race at the end of Leg 8 (in Zimbabwe)?", "correct": "Eric and Daniel", "options": ["Henry and Evan", "Cody and Jessica", "Alex and Conor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEric and Daniel.\n\n\tTo end off the eighth leg of the race, teams needed to proceed on foot from Harare Gardens to the First Street Pedestrian Mall, a few blocks over in Harare.  There, Lucas and Brittany won their third leg of the race (and their second consecutive leg), this time taking a trip for two to Saint Lucia courtesy of Travelocity.  The final task of the leg proved to be the great decider as it dropped twin brothers Eric and Daniel to the back of the pack.  It meant that they were eliminated from the race in sixth place. \n"}]}
