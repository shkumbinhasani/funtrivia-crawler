Hall brought a hip-ness to television that was missing from the late night scene, drawing in a younger, more ethnic crowd more so than Johnny Carson or David Letterman did. With his 'Dog Pound', which was given such silly titles each night like, 'People Who Have Fallen Down And Can't Get Up', and cool guests (remember then-Governor Bill Clinton's saxophone performance?), Hall made tuning in to his show a real treat.\r Another Arsenio staple was his opening monologue in which he would share with the audience some of his quirky observations on his ride in to work from Cleveland entitled, 'Things That Make You Go, Hmmmmmm....'. They were always good for a chuckle or two. In my opinion, \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" was a truly underrated program that wasn't appreciated until it left the air. \n"}, {"text": "Former Los Angeles Laker, Earvin 'Magic' Johnson, hosted this short-lived nighttime talk show after his retirement called, \"The ________ Hour\".", "correct": "Magic & magic", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagic & magic.\n\n\tWhen \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" left the air after the 1994 season, there was a void of late night talk shows which appealed to African-Americans until June 8, 1998, when Earvin Johnson stepped in to fill it with \"The Magic Hour\". While Hall's show was funny and hip, Johnson's show was the complete opposite. Although Hall was never considered a great interviewer, per se, he always had his comic talents to fall back on when an interview fell apart; Johnson, on the other hand, did not have that option. He floundered miserably and it showed. Poorly hosted, poorly written, and poorly put together, \"The Magic Hour\" was mercifully cancelled a few months later on September 4, 1998, which, if you ask me, was still two months too long.\r On the bright side, though, Johnson soon found his niche by becoming a philanthropist and opening several businesses in rundown African-American communities which brought much needed jobs and income into those areas. \n"}, {"text": "\"Day Break\" was a series about a cop who was experiencing which of the following occurrences?", "correct": "He was caught in a time loop and thereby living the same day over and over again", "options": ["He had a 'second sight' which allowed him to peer into the supernatural world and see crimes before they happened", "He was brought back to life to solve his own murder", "He had been transported back in time ten years to solve the case of his missing brother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was caught in a time loop and thereby living the same day over and over again.\n\n\tTaye Diggs played Det.

Every viewer that tuned in weekly had a favorite character, whether it was Khadijiah for her strength and reasonable voice, Synclaire for her sweet, but ditzy personality, or Handyman Overton Wakefield Jones, who loved Synclaire and suffered from coulraphobia, which is a fear of clowns.
