{"id": "389003", "name": "Zombies of the Acid Rain Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", " The Return of the Living Dead"], "questions": [{"text": "In \"The Return of the Living Dead\" what movie did Frank claim was a true story, but they \"changed things all around\"?", "correct": "Night of the Living Dead", "options": ["Plan 9 From Outer Space", "Methuselah Martin", "White Zombie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight of the Living Dead.\n\n\tFrank told Freddy that \"Night of the Living Dead\" was loosely based on something that happened at a VA hospital when a chemical re-animated the dead.  To prove his story was true he showed Freddy a canister containing a previously re-animated corpse which had been accidentally sent where they worked. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Return of the Living Dead\" what happened when Frank slapped the canister?", "correct": "The chemical sprayed on Frank and Freddy.", "options": ["Nothing happened.", "The corpse shouted, \"Let me eat your brain!\"", "An earthquake shook the ground."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe chemical sprayed on Frank and Freddy.\n\n\tThe chemical gas sprayed Frank and Freddy and spread on the dead things at the medical supply place, re-animating half a dog, butterflies pinned to a board, and a corpse.  Frank and Freddy fell asleep for a while and woke up feeling sick. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Return of the Living Dead\" what did Frank tell Burt to do about the zombie?", "correct": "Stab its brain", "options": ["Drown it", "Bury it", "Mail it back to where it came from"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStab its brain.\n\n\tFrank called Burt after hearing a resurrected corpse banging on the door.  Burt had previously told Frank not to touch that canister, and now he tried to figure out how to kill something that was already supposed to be dead.  They tried stabbing its brain, because that's how the zombies were killed in \"Night of the Living Dead\", but it was still alive. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Return of the Living Dead\" what did Burt suggest Ernie do about the \"rabid weasels\"?", "correct": "Burn them", "options": ["Hang them", "Drown them", "Bury them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurn them.\n\n\tBurt brought wiggling bags to Ernie, claiming they were rabid weasels and wanting them burned in the crematory. Ernie said that would be cruel to burn living things, and wanted to shoot them instead. Burt said that wouldn't work, and then a dismembered hand came out of a bag and ripped Ernie's pants.  Eventually, Ernie cremated the zombie, but the smoke containing that strange chemical rose up into a cloud and rained onto the nearby cemetery, bringing those dead people back to life. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these things did the zombies do in \"The Return of the Living Dead\"?", "correct": "They spoke.", "options": ["They solved complex math problems.", "They flew.", "They spun their heads around."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey spoke.\n\n\tSometimes the zombies spoke to people in \"Return of the Living Dead\". One zombie without legs was captured and told Ernie that it wanted to eat brains because eating brains temporarily took away the pain of being dead. This movie was famous for zombies sometimes shouting \"Brains!\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Return of the Living Dead\" what did the paramedics tell Frank and Freddy?", "correct": "\"You're dead.\"", "options": ["\"We can't do anything until your insurance clears.\"", "\"There's a lot of that going around.\"", "\"Take two aspirin and call me in the morning.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"You're dead.\"\n\n\tBurt had sent for paramedics to examine Frank and Freddy, who were sick from that re-animating chemical from the canister. The paramedics examined Frank and Freddy, and thought their instruments were malfunctioning. Frank and Freddy appeared to be at room temperature. They had no heartbeats, and their bodies had bruises symptomatic of rigor mortis. One paramedic (paraphrasing) said, \"Our instruments say you're dead, but you're talking. Dead people don't talk, so we don't know what to think.\" \n"}, {"text": "What happened to the paramedics in \"The Return of the Living Dead\"?", "correct": "Their brains were eaten by zombies.", "options": ["They became congressmen.", "They drove away.", "They were given medals."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir brains were eaten by zombies.\n\n\tOne of the paramedics got on the radio at his vehicle and was attacked by zombies who ate his brain. The other paramedic looked to see what was wrong, and he also got attacked by zombies. \n"}, {"text": "Complete this statement: In \"The Return of the Living Dead\" the zombie said over the police radio, \"Send more _____.\"", "correct": "Cops", "options": ["Pizza", "Perfume", "Cheese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCops.\n\n\tAfter the zombies came out of the graves and attacked Trash, who had complained of \"acid rain\" burning her skin, the rain which had resurrected the dead, police drove by to find out what was going on. There were two ambulances sitting there, because the paramedics had been killed. The policeman shot the zombies running at him, but they held him down and ate his brain anyway. One of the talking zombies got on the police radio and said, \"Send more cops.\"  This was their way of getting more brains to eat until they could break into the buildings where the people were hiding. \n"}, {"text": "What did Frank do after he became a zombie in \"The Return of the Living Dead\"?", "correct": "Cremated himself", "options": ["Locked himself in a room", "Ran away", "Ate someone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCremated himself.\n\n\tAfter being sprayed with that strange chemical at the beginning of the movie, Freddy and Frank eventually became zombies. Freddy talked about his craving for brains, especially the brain of his girlfriend. However, Frank seemingly had enough intelligence to know when he was becoming a zombie, and didn't want to hurt anyone. He climbed into the crematory, turned it on, and burned himself away. Later, Freddy's girlfriend and Ernie were hiding in the attic while Freddy climbed a ladder and tried to break in. \n"}, {"text": "Whom did Burt call near the end of \"The Return of the Living Dead\"?", "correct": "The army", "options": ["The President", "His wife", "His mother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe army.\n\n\tThere was a number on the side of the canister to be called in the case of an emergency. Frank warned everyone not to call the army, because it would cause trouble. However, Burt decided to call the number anyway when the police couldn't help. He eventually spoke to a general. \n"}]}
