{"id": "237678", "name": "Test yourself! Take this Silent Hill Quiz |   Movies", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Silent Hill"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of Rose's daughter?", "correct": "Sharon", "options": ["Julie", "Dahlia", "Melanie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSharon.\n\n\tSharon has a huge problem with sleepwalking.  Occasionally, she'll actually leave the house.  In one occasion, Rose and Chris save Sharon at the last minute before she plunges off a waterfall near their house.  After this, Rose decides to take Sharon to Silent Hill, a place that Sharon mentioned in her sleep, in order to see if there's an answer there.  When Rose leaves, she doesn't tell Chris, and he finds that Silent Hill, West Virginia is haunted.  A large fire underneath the city destroyed the population. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the cop that pulls Rose over before she and her daughter reach Silent Hill?", "correct": "Cybill", "options": ["Laurie", "Kim", "Amanda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCybill.\n\n\tBefore they can reach Silent Hill, Rose learns that the road to Silent Hill has been blocked, but she proceeds anyways.  A cop, Cybil, pulls Rose over, but when she sees a nearby sign for Silent Hill, they speed up and Cybil chases her.  Rose is speeding so fast that she hits a young girl (who's actually a ghost), and she crashes the car.  When she wakes up, it's daytime, and Sharon is gone. \n"}, {"text": "After being placed in handcuffs by the cop who followed her into Silent Hill, where does Rose run to?", "correct": "The school", "options": ["The apartment building", "The church", "The pharmacy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe school.\n\n\tAfter Rose follows Sharon underground, she comes across a dead body strung onto a fence and she's attacked by fiery creatures.  However, she wakes up in a room playing Johnny Cash on the jukebox and she runs back to the car.  Here she tries to call Chris, but all he hears is static.  Cybil reappears at this time and handcuffs Rose, but when they're attacked by a creature that spits acid, Rose takes the opportunity and runs to the school- a location on one of Sharon's pictures. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the janitor who held the key to the Grand Hotel room?", "correct": "Colin", "options": ["Jake", "Douglas", "Daryl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColin.\n\n\tAt the school, Rose walks into a classroom and finds the journal of Alessa Gillespie in one of the desks.  Alessa is actually Dahlia's daughter (Dahlia is a woman that Rose ran into when she came into town).  Suddenly, a girl runs by the room and Rose chases her to a bathroom stall, but when she opens it, she finds a janitor strung up in the stall using barbed wire. On the wall, written in blood is \"Dare you, dare you, double dare you\" and an arrow pointing to 'Colin's' mouth.  Inside, Rose finds a clue leading to the Grand Hotel, and she runs into Cybil again after the air raid sirens go off.  After this they are attacked by Pyramidhead. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Rose find Room 111?", "correct": "Behind a large picture", "options": ["Underground", "There was no Room 111", "In a completely different location"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBehind a large picture.\n\n\tAfter everything turns to ash once again, Cybil and Rose go to the Grand Hotel where they meet Dahlia again and a woman named Anna.  They find another picture in the hotel mailboxes and head to Room 111.  They don't find it on the first floor, but Rose notices that it's behind a large picture of a witch burning.  Inside they have to jump across a large gap between buildings and they once again spot and chase Alessa/Sharon.  They finally catch up to her this time, but she bursts into flames.  Once again, the air sirens go off and this time they run for the church. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the woman that Rose meets in the Grand Hotel?", "correct": "Anna", "options": ["Mona", "Bella", "Rita"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnna.\n\n\tAnna is one of the residents of Silent Hill and she provides Rose and Cybil with information as they head through the town.  When they all head to the church to evade 'the darkness', and Dahlia claims that they all brought this upon themselves (possibly for the town's witch burnings).  Anna is killed by Pyramidhead before she can enter the church, but they close the doors to save the rest of them.  The residents think that Rose is a witch, but Cybil uses her gun to stop them from attacking her.  The leader of the group, Christabella is also introduced. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Chris get arrested by Detective Gucci?", "correct": "Toulca County Orphanage", "options": ["On the side of the road near Silent Hill", "The Braham Archives Building", "The Braham gas station"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToulca County Orphanage.\n\n\tAfter breaking into the Archives Building and finding a picture of Alessa (who looks identical to Sharon), Chris heads to the source, the Toulca County Orphanage, in order to find how Sharon came to them.  He speaks with a nun there and Detective Gucci tells him the truth about it.  After this, Chris is escorted back to Ohio and he returns home. \n"}, {"text": "At Brookhaven Hospital, Rose has to reach room B151.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tChristabella tells Rose that she must reach the source of the evil in the basement of the hospital, so she, Cybil, and three miners head to the hospital.  When Christabella discovers that Alessa looks exactly like Sharon, she has the miners attack the two.  Cybil stays back to fight off the miners while she shoves Rose into the elevator and lets her go.  Cybil is deemed a witch and is taken back to the church. \n"}, {"text": "Where was Rose's daughter hiding through the duration of the film?", "correct": "The Nathan Motel", "options": ["Brookhaven Hospital", "Under the church", "The Grand Hotel - Room 111"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Nathan Motel.\n\n\tAfter passing through some murderous nurses, Rose finally reaches room B151.  Here, the dark side of Alessa tells her the story of Alessa's past.  The residents deemed her a witch and they tried to burn her in Room 111 of Brookhaven Hospital.  Dahlia went for help and didn't reach her in time.  She was somewhat saved, but she was horribly burned.  In Room B151 of the hospital, she had the chance to get revenge, so she took it.  After the dark Alessa uses Rose's body, they head to the church to save the good Alessa (Sharon), who is being prepared to burn at the stake.\rMeanwhile, Cybil is burned overtop of the fire in the church because the townspeople fear that she may also be evil. \n"}, {"text": "Do Rose and her daughter live in Silent Hill the end of the film?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAfter Cybil is burned, Rose returns to the church where she is quickly stabbed by Christabella.  Her blood causes the darkness to enter the church and they are attacked by endless strands of barbed wire controlled by Alessa.  As Christabella is ripped in half by the barbed wire, Rose saves Sharon from her ladder (used to burn her).  In the end, everyone has been killed in the town except for Sharon, Rose, and Dahlia (because in the eyes of a child, a mother is God).  They get into the car and drive home leaving Silent Hill behind.  \r Although it may seem like they make it out of the town alive, they had been dead, or 'in limbo' either since they crashed their car at the town's entrance (as did Cybil), or since they were in the church.  Silent Hill is somewhat of a purgatory, and though the residents were really dead, they weren't quite in Hell yet.  In the end, Rose and Sharon are still stuck in the 'Silent Hill-like' fog and the purgatory, though it's left up to the viewer to decide what really happens to the two. \n"}]}
