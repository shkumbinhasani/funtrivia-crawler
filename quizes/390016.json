{"id": "390016", "name": "\"Madmax\" Trivia Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stranger Things"], "questions": [{"text": "On October 28, 1984, a group of thieves perform a heist in what city?", "correct": "Pittsburgh", "options": ["Baltimore", "St. Louis", "Cincinnati"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPittsburgh.\n\n\tIn Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in October 1984, a group of five bank robbers peel away from an alarmed building as the cops pursue down the city streets in their vehicle.  They manage to shake off the police after some clever maneuvering, but the getaway driver never really gets lucky until her passenger tells her to take a tunnel.  The tunnel caves in at what seems to be the passenger's whim.\rThe lead cop car swerves to avoid getting crushed by the falling debris, causing an accident and keeping the police from going any further.  When the drive gets out of his car though, the tunnel never seems to have caved in.\rThe thieves drive onwards, unaware that the passenger bears a tattoo on her wrist-- the number 008-- and her nose starts to bleed. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin claims to have the high score in which of these arcade games before he's overthrown by 'MADMAX'?", "correct": "Dig Dug", "options": ["Arkanoid", "Pac-Man", "Space Invaders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDig Dug.\n\n\tIn Hawkins, Indiana, Dustin searches the couch cushions in the living room and calls the other guys with a couple of quarters in-hand.  Lucas earned some coins from mowing a neighbour's lawn while Mike tears into his sister Nancy's piggy bank.  Will ends up meeting the guys at the arcade, where the fruits of their labours (or not) are spent on video games.\rDustin plays and loses \"Dragon's Lair\", but takes solace in knowing he has the high scores on \"Centipede\" and \"Dig Dug\" but he's surprised to find out that he's actually been beaten by someone with the name 'MADMAX', in some cases by a wide margin.  While Dustin argues with a teenager, Will seems to slip into the Upside-Down, emerging out in front of the arcade to see storm clouds brewing.  Mike brings him back to reality. \n"}, {"text": "Journalist Murray Bauman claims that all signs point to which of these being in Hawkins?", "correct": "Russian spies", "options": ["The Loch Ness Monster", "A cult", "Zombies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRussian spies.\n\n\tDetective Hopper heads to the station and ends up getting bothered by Murray Bauman, a journalist looking for news about Russian spies, though it's clear that no one is giving any info about the recent goings-on, especially in regards to 'aliens'.  Nonetheless, Hopper gives him five minutes of his time to discuss how someone could possibly shatter a door with their mind like someone at the local grocery store alleged happened not long ago. It all comes down to a young girl with a shaved head and the possibility that she's a Russian weapon.  Hopper seeks out a distraction and sends Bauman on his way, asking him politely to stop bleeding his townspeople dry over conspiracy theories. \n"}, {"text": "From which state does Max hail?", "correct": "California", "options": ["Iowa", "Florida", "New York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalifornia.\n\n\tAt school, Nancy goes over Steve's college application essay and wonders if his stories about the big basketball game relate to stories about his grandfather's experiences in the war.  Steve kind of regrets writing the paper and wonders if it's even worth it to send something in for early acceptance since he'll likely end up working for his dad anyways, but he tells her it wouldn't be bad since he could stay around for Nancy's senior year.  Both of them watch as a car with a California license plate pulls into the parking lot and a guy in all denim and a girl with red hair get out.\rIn his science class, Mr. Clarke introduces the girl with red hair as Maxine.  She corrects him; no one calls her Maxine; she prefers Max.  The guys instantly realize she's 'MADMAX'. \n"}, {"text": "Hopper is called to investigate an odd occurrence at which of these locations?", "correct": "Pumpkin patch", "options": ["Graveyard", "Haunted house", "Hospital"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPumpkin patch.\n\n\tAt the general store, Joyce sews a patch onto Will's Halloween costume until Bob, a former high school colleague, stops by and brings her into the back room for a make-out session.  He heads out on his way to work at the local electronics store.\rHopper, meanwhile, heads to a local pumpkin patch to investigate something weird; all of the prize-winning pumpkins in the patch have died and rotted overnight.  While looking around, he sees something moving in the crops of a nearby field and walks in alone to investigate.  All he finds is a scarecrow.\rAt high school, Nancy and Jonathan receive invites to a Halloween party.  Jonathan refuses to go though since he's planning to take Will out trick-or-treating.    She insists until Steve sneaks up on her in the hallway and he walks off.\rThe boys, meanwhile, spend their lunch spying on the new girl until she heads inside.  Soon though, Will is picked up by his mother and the two head out for an appointment. \n"}, {"text": "Will says that in his most recent vision of the Upside-Down, the evil entity waiting there wanted to be born.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tJoyce and Will end up driving out and meeting Hopper at the lab where he's subjected to a full physical examination.  A doctor speaks to him about the episode he had in the Upside-Down the previous night while, all the while, he's monitored on machines and cameras.  He talks about the coming storm in the Upside-Down and how he felt as though evil were watching him, petrifying him.  The evil, he says, wanted to kill everyone.\rThe doctor later tells Joyce and Hopper that it'll likely get worse before it gets better since it's the year anniversary of Will's trauma.  As they leave, Joyce and Hopper are both a bit concerned with trusting Will's psychiatrist, but it seems there's not much of a choice. \n"}, {"text": "The portal to the Upside-Down still exists in the basement of the U.S. Department of Energy lab.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAs Hopper, Joyce, and Will depart from the appointment, Will's psychiatrist watches them leave before receding into the building and taking an elevator down into its depths.  He's there in the labs as a technician suits up, grabs a flamethrower, and fires at the tentacled opening to the Upside-Down still on the wall from the previous year.\rDustin and Lucas, now with a pair of binoculars, watch as Max arrives at the arcade, flipping off her reckless driver and heading inside to beat her score at \"Dig Dug\".\rThat night, Mike argues with his parents about his behaviour over the past months.  For stealing from Nancy's piggy bank, he's being told to pack up two boxes of his toys to give away.  It seems excessive, he says, but his parents drew the line ages ago. \n"}, {"text": "Nancy and Steve have dinner with who of these people?", "correct": "Barb's parents", "options": ["Detective Hopper", "Will's family", "Dustin and Lucas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarb's parents.\n\n\tNancy and Steve, meanwhile, head to the dinner they'd promised to attend, especially since they had to bail on dinner the previous week, with Barb's parents.  They discuss the for sale sign on their lawn and tell the two that they've made the decision to hire investigative journalist Murray Bauman to investigate Barb's disappearance.  As such, they've decided to leave their money in his hands because it gives them the chance to do what the Hawkins Police Department never could: find Barb.  Nancy has to excuse herself when she hears this news.\rIn the bathroom, she cries over Barb's loss.  She knows the truth about where her friend ended up. \n"}, {"text": "Bob and the Byers Family end up watching which of these movies together?", "correct": "Mr. Mom", "options": ["Gremlins", "Ghostbusters", "Return of the Jedi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Mom\n\n\tWill, boxing up his things for a yard sale, looks over at his blanket fort and decides to try his walkie talkie again in another attempt at contacting Eleven, this time on Day 352.  He walks away after his transmission only to be interrupted by Dustin and Lucas, both on their way home after spying on Max all evening.  As Dustin heads up to his house, he parks his bike and hears something moving outside.  He doesn't notice whatever's in his trash can.\rJoyce, meanwhile, makes popcorn while Bob films her on a hulking video camera.  Jonathan and Will, meanwhile, chat about how weird they both are and acknowledge their mutual awkwardness with Bob in the picture.  They all end up watching Bob's film pick (\"Mr. Mom\") until the phone rings in the other room.  Bob convinces Joyce not to answer it, telling her it's probably a prank call. \n"}, {"text": "Eleven, as it would seem, has been living in the real world despite having vanished a year earlier.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAt the U.S. Department of Energy lab, the switchboards in the basement begin to flash wildly.\rIn the Byers household, Will awakens to use the washroom and realizes that something bad is happening.  He sees red lightning flash on the walls as his front door opens to the Upside-Down.  When he walks outside, the spiralling clouds near and a gargantuan, tentacled monster moves closer on the horizon.\rHopper drives out into the forest, crossing over a tripwire and knocking in a specific way on the front door of his cabin to unlock it.  He grabs a beer from the fridge and sits down at the table.  Dinner's already waiting for him and he's criticized for being late as Eleven emerges to meet him.  Both dig in. \n"}]}
