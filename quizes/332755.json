If a point is already established and you want to play a \"Pass Line\" bet, it is not advisable to do so. Instead you can put your chips in the area for the identical bet, marked as what?", "correct": "Come", "options": ["Field", "Roll", "Hit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCome.\n\n\tThe \"Come Bet\" is exactly the same as the \"Pass Line\". It wins when a 7 or 11 is rolled, and loses when a 2,3,or 12 is rolled, and plays out the point in other cases. You can take odds on a \"Come Bet\" exactly as you would on a Pass bet. Come bets are for players who enjoy the action of \"place bets\" without the higher house edge. \n"}, {"text": "\"Place bets\" are a bet that an individual number will be rolled before a 7. On which of the following numbers is it impossible to put a place bet?", "correct": "11", "options": ["10", "9", "5"], "explanation": "\n\n\n11.\n\n\tThe only numbers which can be placed are point numbers, or 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. However, you can make bets on the 11 by betting on the yo-eleven in the middle of the board, and this pays 15-1 as a one-roll bet. However, this is a very high house edge bet and should be avoided. \n"}, {"text": "You place a \"Pass Line\" bet on the come-out and the roll is 4. What is your reaction?", "correct": "Disappointment; it could've been worse, but a 4 is a 33% underdog now", "options": ["Elation; you just won even money on your bet", "Devastation; you just lost your money", "Excitement; you haven't won yet, but a 4 is a 66% favourite to win now"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDisappointment; it could've been worse, but a 4 is a 33% underdog now.\n\n\tThe only thing worse than a 4 or a 10 for the \"Pass Line\" bettor is craps, which automatically loses. Because a 4 can only be rolled 3 ways and a 7 can be rolled 6 ways, there is a 1/3 chance that you're going to lose your money now. However, the best strategy to counter this is to take maximum odds, which will decrease the house edge and pay more than even money on a win. \n"}, {"text": "Taking odds on a \"Pass Line\" bet reduces your expected money lost.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThere is a distinction between house edge and expected loss. Because the house edge in craps on a \"Pass Line\" bet is 1.41%, your expected loss on a 100$ bet is at $1.41. When taking odds, that have no house edge, your expected loss in units will not decrease. However, the house edge will go down because you are now betting more than 100$ for the same expected loss of $1.41. \n"}, {"text": "The \"Field Bet\" is a one roll bet that is popular among new players. Which of the following numbers would be the most likely to put a smile on a field bettor's face?", "correct": "12", "options": ["3", "11", "5"], "explanation": "\n\n\n12.\n\n\tThe \"Field Bet\" will lose if a 5,6,7,or 8 is rolled and win even money on 3, 4, 9, 10, and 11. Most casinos will pay double on both the 2 and the 12, and some will even pay triple on one or the other, since these are the rarest numbers to appear. The house edge for casinos that pay triple on both is nil. \n"}, {"text": "Although it is not recommended to \"hedge\" one's bets (play two opposite sides while mistakenly believing it will reduce the house edge), some players enjoy doing this. Which bet is ideal to hedge with a \"Pass Line\" bet on the come-out?", "correct": "Any Craps", "options": ["Yo-leven", "Any 7", "Hard Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAny Craps.\n\n\tThe only numbers that lose a \"Pass Line\" bet on a come-out roll are 2,3,or 12, which are referred to as craps. Betting \"Any Craps\" pays 7-1 and will therefore make up for the losses on the \"Pass Line\". There are various other forms of hedging bets which players mistakenly believe will beat the casino in the long run, but these actually just increase the house's income by combining the house edge of both bets. \n"}, {"text": "The fan favourites are the \"Hard Ways\". When making this bet, you wager that your number will be made the \"hard way (2-2)\" before a 7 or its \"easy way\" (3-1,1-3)\" is rolled. How many \"Hard Ways\" are available?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Six", "Seven", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\t\"Hard Way\" bets can only be even numbered points. Therefore, they are 4,6,8, and 10. The 2 and the 12 have no \"easy way\" equivalents and therefore are not included. The 4 and the 10 pay 7-1 or 8-1 (depending on the casino) when the bet is won, while the 6 and the 8 pay 9-1 or 10-1. This is because there are 4 easy ways to roll a 6 or 8, and only 2 to roll a 4 or 10. \n"}, {"text": "The Casino also offers a bet, which is the perfect opposite of the \"Pass Line\" bet, but for one modification. What is this bet called?", "correct": "Don't Pass", "options": ["Pass-less", "House Pass", "House Game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon't Pass.\n\n\tThe \"Don't Pass\" bet and its faithful friend \"Don't Come\" bet against the shooter; win when craps are rolled on the come out and lose with a 7 or 11. However, they push (tie) when a 12 is rolled (in some casinos, this is a 2). This push keeps the edge in the house's favour no matter which side you bet. The \"Don't Pass\" has a slightly lower house edge than the \"Pass Line\", but is played less frequently due to the craps \"taboo\" of being against the table. \n"}, {"text": "You place a 10$ bet on the \"Pass Line\" and then you place 40$ odds after the come-out for a total bet of 50$. You win, and are paid 90$. What was the point?", "correct": "a 4 or 10", "options": ["a 5 or 9", "a 6 or 8", "a 3 or 11"], "explanation": "\n\n\na 4 or 10.\n\n\tThe \"Pass Line Bet\" always pays even money, so you got 10$ from the casino for your original bet. This leaves 80$ that you got paid for the odds bet. Your original bet was 40$, meaning you got paid 2-1. Because, there is no house edge on odds, the casino will pay you 2-1 on a point that is half as likely to be rolled than a seven. A 4 or 10 can be rolled three ways (2-2,3-1,1-3 ; 5-5, 4-6,6-4), whereas a 7 can be rolled 6 ways (3-4,4-3,2-5,5-2,1-6,6-1). You were a 2-1 underdog, and you got paid 2-1 when you got lucky. \n"}, {"text": "You've played the field, bet the pass, played the hard-ways, bet the 12, cheered, cried, and you now have 1$ left. You have an overwhelming feeling that the next number rolled will be a 9. No, you're sure it will be 6-3. What bet can you place?", "correct": "Hop Bet", "options": ["Trick Bet", "Jump Bet", "Price Bet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHop Bet.\n\n\tThe \"hop\" is a one-roll bet handled by the box man, and it pays 15-1 for any combination of two dice you decide you want to bet on. If you bet on hard numbers, such as 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, and 6-6, the payout will be 30-1. This bet has a very high house edge but can sometimes be fun if you're feeling lucky. \n"}]}
