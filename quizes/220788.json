{"id": "220788", "name": "Working in a Post-Katrina Animal Shelter Trivia Game | Animals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", " Miscellaneous Animal Trivia", "Specific Topic Animal Trivia"], "questions": [{"text": "In what manner was the Katrina disaster different from most other U.S. disasters, as far as animal companions go?", "correct": "people were separated from lost pets for longer than usual", "options": ["most people were able to locate lost pets within days", "most pets sensed the hurricane coming and escaped before it hit", "almost everyone took their pets with them when they evacuated"], "explanation": "\n\n\npeople were separated from lost pets for longer than usual.\n\n\tBecause people were left homeless themselves or were forced to move far away from their old homes, and because many pet owners thought they'd be right back to get the pets they left behind, animals and their human companions were separated for weeks or months. Most stranded pets were not reunited with human companions at all. The moral: Take your pets with you when you evacuate.\r(plus, many government rescuers using helicopters, etc. did not allow pets to come along with their owners) \n"}, {"text": "Why can't out-of-state vets practice at animal shelters in Louisiana, even during a disaster?", "correct": "because they aren't licensed to practice in Louisiana", "options": ["because people in Louisiana do not care about animals", "because this would take business away from in-state vets", "because officials are afraid that out-of-state vets may spread animal diseases"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbecause they aren't licensed to practice in Louisiana.\n\n\tIn the shelter where I worked, we had one hardworking Louisiana vet for about 1000 animals. He also took very sick animals back to his office with him where they could be more efficiently treated. However, we also had vet students from Tufts University (and probably other vet schools) and vet technicians from all over. Hooray for these hardworking volunteers! They saved many lives. \n"}, {"text": "How does a dog get heartworm in Louisiana?", "correct": "from a mosquito bite", "options": ["from other infected dogs", "from rabid squirrels", "from infected cats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfrom a mosquito bite.\n\n\tI would estimate that 75 percent of the dogs at our shelter had this serious condition (but it is curable). \n"}, {"text": "When cleaning a cat's cage in a shelter, why might a volunteer place a sheet of white paper over a layer of newspaper?", "correct": "this makes it easier to spot diarrhea, vomit, and other indications of illness", "options": ["cats like the feeling of white paper better than the feeling of newspaper", "if visitors come to the shelter, white paper looks prettier and more elegant", "most cats are allergic to the ink in newspaper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthis makes it easier to spot diarrhea, vomit, and other indications of illness.\n\n\tSome cats, however, tend to shred their sheet of white paper and form it into a sort of nest. And kittens tend to snarl up white paper, newspaper, litter pan, and food/water dishes into a total shambles right after you clean their cages. Older cats who want attention or are simply stir crazy do so, too. \n"}, {"text": "Why might shelter workers place plastic bottles of frozen water in animal cages? ", "correct": "to cool the animals down during the hottest part of the day", "options": ["to cure animals' aches and pains", "this is a favorite toy among cats, especially", "to distract vicious animals while workers clean their cages"], "explanation": "\n\n\nto cool the animals down during the hottest part of the day.\n\n\tI was working in what can best be described as a M.A.S.H. tent for cats--it was the cat ICU--and it got so hot in there that we had to hose down the outside of it a couple of times a day. We had fans in there, luckily. And really sick animals were placed in an air conditioned mobile vet unit. I took care of one cat who used to nap while embracing his frozen water bottle with his two front legs. \n"}, {"text": "If some cats in a crowded shelter have upper respiratory problems, and isolating them is not possible, where should workers place them?", "correct": "in the lowest tier of cages", "options": ["in the middle tier of cages", "workers should let such cats run free", "in the top tier of cages"], "explanation": "\n\n\nin the lowest tier of cages.\n\n\tYou don't want a sick cat's sneezes to rain down on the cats below. However, the lowest tier of cages is not ideal for other reasons. Kittens don't get enough eye contact down there, and older volunteers have to get down on their tired old knees to clean the cages. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these names for kittens adopted from a Louisiana emergency shelter in the fall of 2005 bear a relation to the event which left many animals in shelters at the time?", "correct": "Katrina and Beausoleil", "options": ["Chandler and Monica", "Romeo and Juliet", "Ricky and Lucy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKatrina and Beausoleil.\n\n\tAt least, that's what we named the two little charmers that we adopted. Beau's name (pronounced \"Bo-so-lay\") is French for \"lovely sunshine.\" It's a Cajun name (or we think it is). Hurricane Katrina was the event which caused major disruption for all residents of Louisiana, human and animal, especially New Orleans.\rReport by jazzdog88:  The name Beausoleil is indeed French for \"lovely sunshine\" The term Cajun is a mispronunciation of Les Acadiens. The Acadians were a group of French speaking settlers that were deported from the East coast of Canada by the British authorities, circa 1753, to Louisiana (La Louisiane), which at the time was still under French control. People in that area couldn't get their tongues around les Acadiens so it morphed into Cajun. \n"}, {"text": "Why is paperwork (such as numbering each animal) so important in an emergency animal shelter?", "correct": "to keep track of each animal, give it the proper meds, and find it if it is claimed", "options": ["actually, it isn't important--only animal care is important", "volunteers receive \"brownie points\" for each animal they work with", "states require such paperwork, even though it is not actually very important"], "explanation": "\n\n\nto keep track of each animal, give it the proper meds, and find it if it is claimed.\n\n\tA few times, we mixed up animals because we forgot to check the numbers on their temporary collars when we moved them to other parts of the shelter. This may have caused grieving pet owners to be separated from their animals even longer than they already had been. \n"}, {"text": "Why might working in an emergency animal shelter be a happy, rewarding experience?", "correct": "all of these are true", "options": ["it can give you an adrenaline rush that makes you feel happy", "you meet some wonderful people--both locals and volunteers", "you can SEE the difference that you make to animals' comfort"], "explanation": "\n\n\nall of these are true.\n\n\tFor me, this was a life-changing experience. On the first day after my return, I even vowed to stop spending so much time on funtrivia.com so I could put my time to more constructive use. I've been lured back, though, little by little. \n"}, {"text": "If a cat scratches your finger and your finger swells up so that you can't bend it, what should you do?", "correct": "soak it in lemon juice and see a doctor for antibiotics", "options": ["never mind--it'll go away", "have the animal destroyed--it is rabid", "take Mylanta or a similar medication twice a day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsoak it in lemon juice and see a doctor for antibiotics.\n\n\tA vet told me that I was in danger of getting \"cat scratch fever.\" The lemon juice reduced the swelling and I assume that the antibiotics are killing the nasty little germs that got in there. The culprit was a gray male--not neutered--who absolutely HATED me. He scratched me twice on the same finger. Another cat (feral) bit me through a very thick suede glove. \r Thanks for taking the quiz, cher! By the way, Cafe du Monde in New Orleans is open again. You can get the best chickory-flavored coffee and beignets in the world there (but I didn't have time to go--I was given a cold beignet by someone who did go, though). \n"}]}
