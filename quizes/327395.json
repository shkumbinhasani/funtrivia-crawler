{"id": "327395", "name": "\"Mattress\" Multiple Choice Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "While the teachers talk about yearbook photos in the teacher's lounge, Sue comes in sporting new surgical modifications.  What does she claim to have done?", "correct": "Gotten an eye lift", "options": ["Stretched a wrinkle out", "Reshaped her forehead", "Received a row of new hair follicles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGotten an eye lift.\n\n\tWill sits down with Ken and Emma in the teacher's lounge and asks them about the wedding.  It turns out, the big day is on the same day as Sectionals and Emma, who wanted to go to support the kids (or so she says) is unable to switch the date.  Soon, the topic switches to school yearbook photos and Sue enters the room claiming she had minor surgery done in preparation (as she does every year).  This year, it's an eye lift...and she had her tear ducts removed since she wasn't using them.  She also says that her Cheerios are excited, a sentiment that Will echoes about the Glee kids.  Sue corrects him; the Glee Club doesn't get a picture.  She spoke to Principal Figgins about removing the kids from the yearbook as their picture is usually vandalized anyways.\rIn Glee Club, before both Rachel and Mr. Schuester arrive, Kurt talks with the others and brings proof that their omission may be a good thing in preventing more anti-Glee terror.  When Will arrives, he vows to get the kids' smiling faces into a Glee Club photo. \n"}, {"text": "Will speaks to Principal Figgins about the Glee Club yearbook photo.  Who also goes to Figgins' office to debate?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Emma", "Quinn", "Sue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tWill speaks to Figgins about the issue but Figgins stays true to his idea that Sue is actually right and he's doing a good thing by omitting the Glee kids.  Will finally talks him out of it...but for a price.  Figgins claims that the yearbook is prime advertising space and it'd cost $1,000 to have their page in the book.  For a quarter page, it costs $300, but it only fits two students.  Figgins tells Will to pick his two best-looking kids.  Rachel storms in at that moment to argue her side and get the picture back, but Will assures her that the photo is fine.\rIt turns out, Rachel is a member of every club she can possibly be in for the school.  Last year, she was in every club photo- she claims it's important to practice for her years of fame in front of the paparazzi. \n"}, {"text": "Does Terri approve of Will's idea to buy the ad space in the yearbook for the Glee Club photo?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tBrittany and Santana both spend time in the library drawing on Rachel's pictures in last year's yearbook.  Quinn watches on from across the table while they do this.  When they leave, she vows to get herself into the picture for the Cheerios, even though she was kicked off the team for her pregnancy, because she wants that image for herself when people look back through the yearbook.\rWill asks Terri what she thinks about him purchasing the advertising space for the Glee Club so that they can get their quarter-page photo.  Terri immediately says no as they need the money for the baby and because it always gets vandalized anyways.  He decides to give a cheque to Figgins anyways and asks that he cash it later in the week despite Terri's wishes.  When he tells Glee Club that they'll put who gets to be in the picture to a vote, Rachel seems to be the only excited candidate...and she's the only one the team votes for. \n"}, {"text": "Who accepts the co-captain position after it's offered by Rachel?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Mercedes", "Brittany", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tWill is concerned about New Directions' reaction to getting a photo for the yearbook.  When he asks Emma, he suggests that he just let Rachel take this one for the team...she does want to do it.  Will also asks Emma if she thinks that Ken purposely set the date of the wedding for the same day as Sectionals and she says that it doesn't matter.  She's marrying Ken because she wants to and none of the other stuff can really compare.\rWill speaks to Rachel in private and asks her to find a co-captain for the picture.  Rachel decides that this would be a good idea since she has too many proposals to handle herself.  When it comes down to it though, no one else really wants the job.  She does go around the school asking the others, but can't garner interest.  Finn is the only one to step up after Rachel tells him that it's important and they desperately need the morale boost. \n"}, {"text": "What happens when it comes time for Rachel and her co-captain to take their picture for the Glee Club photo?", "correct": "Her co-captain doesn't show", "options": ["Everything goes fine", "The picture is postponed", "She has a pimple on her face"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer co-captain doesn't show.\n\n\tTaking Finn aside, Rachel elaborates that he has a good external appearance of toughness (as shown by his football roots) but for Glee Club's photo he needs an air of positivity.  To teach him how to properly smile, she leads him through a rendition of Lily Allen's \"Smile\" while the band plays on in the choir room.\rAfter football practice, Finn is ambushed by some of the guys on the team who draw on his face with markers.  They claim to be practicing for the real thing.\rRachel ends up at the photo shoot alone.  While she waits for Finn to show up, the photographer says that he can't wait much longer.  Rachel, although upset, psychs herself up and takes the picture by herself.  While she has many poses planned, the photographer says he has to leave to cast for a commercial he's oing for his brother.  Rachel jumps at the opportunity. \n"}, {"text": "What song by Van Halen does the Glee Club perform for their mattress commercial?", "correct": "Jump", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJump.\n\n\tIt turns out, the photographer needs more than just Rachel.  She decides to get the entire Glee Club involved in the commercial taking different lines.  When she informs the club that they've been cast, they're all excited for it and they break out of their funk.\rUpon arriving at the mattress store, they're given the script and they do a quick read-through.  While impressed with their work, they decide to offer up something more energetic and in the vein of what they do best.  Their selection: a song and dance to Van Halen's \"Jump\" on a series of mattresses.  It turns out well- while the photographer is disappointed that his idea wasn't taken, the store owner is happy with the result. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Will find Terri's fake pregnancy belly?", "correct": "In a drawer", "options": ["In the car", "On a table", "On her stomach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a drawer.\n\n\tWill searches through the dressers in the apartment for a sweater he can't find.  Upon opening one of the drawers, he discovers one of Terri's fake pregnancy pads used to make her stomach look larger than it is.  When he confronts Terri about it, she lies about what it's used for.  He makes her lift her shirt to prove the truth to him. Shocked, he asks why she did it and she says that she was scared that he was pulling away from her.  She blames Glee Club for the most part, but she also says that she isn't the girl he wanted when he was 15 anymore.  She also reminds him that she was pregnant, but it turned out to be a hysterical pregnancy. When the time came, she would've taken Quinn Fabray's child and posited it as her own.  Terri reminds Will of the fake ultrasound and says that he should remember the feeling he had when they visited the doctor because they could have that back.  Will storms out and Terri is unable to stop him. \n"}, {"text": "Because the Glee Club performed in a commercial, they could technically be disqualified from performing at Sectionals.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWill heads to his office in the school and finds a stack of mattresses in the choir room with a note taped to the side.  It turns out they were a gift from the mattress store owner for their work in the commercial.  Will rips a mattress open and sleeps on it in his office for the night.\rSue, upon finishing another segment of 'Sue's Corner', watches the commercial for the mattresses for the first time.  The next day at school, Quinn approaches her in the hall asking for a spot back on the team so that she can appear in the photo.  She says that she won't let her and that Glee Club has dug its own grave.\rWhen Will meets Figgins and Sue in the principal's office, it turns out Sue is correct.  While Will had no idea that the kids performed in the commercial originally, they did it to unify themselves and feel good.  However, according to the Show Choir Rule Book, doing this professional work negates their amateur status as they got paid for their services. \n"}, {"text": "How many pages does Quinn say that the Cheerios have in the yearbook?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Twenty", "One", "About half the total"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tIt turns out, while the kids never actually got paid, they were given the free mattresses for their troubles.  Will says that they can give them back, but Figgins insists that one can not be returned as it had been opened.  Will openly admits to this as he had considered leaving Terri and slept on it the night before.  Figgins can't help the situation; Glee is over because the rule was broken.  Sue sees this as a victory.\rQuinn fits into her uniform and visits Sue in her office.  While she still fits, Sue refuses to include her in the photo.  Quinn insists that she will be in the photo as Sue is being a hypocrite.  The Cheerios get free handouts all the time and if Figgins found out, they'd be as dead as Glee Club.  Sue allows her to be in the picture, but gives her dry cleaning duty and refuses to let her perform.  Quinn also insists that Sue give Glee Club a full page in the yearbook as the Cheerios have a total of six.  When Quinn leaves, she says she doesn't care about the Cheerios picture anymore; she'd rather be part of a club that's happy to have her. \n"}, {"text": "How does Will allow the kids to perform at Sectionals?", "correct": "He steps down as the instructor for Glee Club", "options": ["He returns the mattresses", "He outs Sue for her previous issues with accepting swag and free stuff", "He quits teaching at McKinley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe steps down as the instructor for Glee Club.\n\n\tWill asks Emma for advice.  She says that the Glee Kids will be fine; he always finds a way to work things out with them.  On the other hand, he needs to get his personal life in line.  When he asks about Terri's actions, she says that her methods were wrong, but she sees how she could possibly do what she did.\rSpeaking to the kids in Glee Club, Will announces that he can no longer instruct them and take them to Sectionals because he accepted their mattresses and is responsible- thus, he is disqualified.  He reminds them that they can still win though.  They did, after all, do the \"Jump\" commercial without him.\rAs the Glee kids sing Charlie Chaplin's \"Smile\", the teachers get their photos taken for the yearbook before New Directions poses for their full-page group shot, each member smiling.  Will watches on before departing and letting the group go on.\rIn the library, the school's copy of the yearbook immediately has the Glee Club's page vandalized. \n"}]}
