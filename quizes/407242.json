{"id": "407242", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 29\" [2] Quiz | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 29"], "questions": [{"text": "Heading to Dar es Salaam in Leg 3, teams found a clue suggesting that they pick up ferry tickets, but where was that clue located?", "correct": "In a newspaper advertisement", "options": ["Under their plane seats", "In a locked briefcase", "In the middle of a block of ice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a newspaper advertisement.\n\n\tTo begin their third leg of the race, teams needed to depart from Trianon Park in S\u00e3o Paulo, head to the airport, and fly more than six thousand miles across the Atlantic and the bulk of Africa to the city of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.  Upon arriving, they would hop into their cabs and proceed to the Askari Monument, find a marked newspaper stall, and search through the papers there to find an ad marked with race colours.  This would tell them to head to a specific ticket booth to take a ferry to Zanzibar City. \n"}, {"text": "The Double U-Turn found in Leg 3 was which of the following?", "correct": "Blind", "options": ["After the Detour", "Removed", "Ignored by all teams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlind.\n\n\tAll nine teams reached Zanzibar City on the same ferry and headed to Mkokotoni Market by taxi.  There, they found the first U-Turn of the race-- a Blind Double U-Turn-- before the upcoming Detour.  Here, at the water's edge, Tara and Joey beat all other teams to U-Turn Seth and Olive while Vanck and Ashton, put off by broken deals with Matt and Redmond, also used theirs to turn the boys around.  It meant that when they opened their Detour clue immediately after, they would need to complete both 'Build It' and 'Weave It'. \n"}, {"text": "What did teams need to build during the 'Build It' Detour task in Leg 3?", "correct": "Desk", "options": ["Bed", "Hut", "Campfire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDesk.\n\n\tFor both Detour options, teams took a dhow across the bay from where they picked up their clues.  Teams choosing to 'Build It' were required to go to a local Zanzibar school where they would receive provided supplies to build a school seat/bench for local children.  Once completed, teams would need to carry their creation to the schoolhouse and receive a quick four-phrase Swahili lesson to get their next clue. Teams completing 'Weave It' instead joined local artisans in weaving two bags made from coconut leaves.  Tara and Joey, Vanck and Ashton, Liz and Michael, Brooke and Scott, Becca and Floyd, Seth and Olive, Shamir and Sara, and London and Logan completed this 'Build It' while only Matt and Redmond completed 'Weave It'.  Since they were U-Turned, Seth and Olive went back to complete 'Weave It' and Matt and Redmond flipped to 'Build It'. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 3, teams completed the market Road Block in Stone Town, purchasing items through which means?", "correct": "The use of their leg money", "options": ["By trading and bartering with lesser items", "Digitally", "Using defunct currency"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe use of their leg money.\n\n\tCompleting their Detour tasks, teams travelled by taxi to Stone Town to find their Road Block clue box waiting in front of Darajani Market.  Here, team members had to do some 'market research'.  Using a Swahili shopping list, they had to find eighteen items in the busy market and, using their team's own money, purchase them and deliver them to a local family waiting outside.  Joey, Michael, Vanck, Floyd, London, Brooke, Matt, Sara, and Olive completed this task to trade for their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated at the end of Leg 3 in Tanzania?", "correct": "Seth and Olive", "options": ["Shamir and Sara", "Becca and Floyd", "Brooke and Scott"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeth and Olive.\n\n\tAfter the Road Block, all that remained was for teams to head by taxi to their third Pit Stop, the Emerson on Hurumzi, a rooftop hotel and teahouse overlooking Stone Town.  Managing to push ahead of all other teams throughout the leg, Liz and Michael retained their number one position (for a second leg in a row), earning a trip for two to Amsterdam courtesy of Travelocity.  Although Becca and Floyd arrived fifth, a lost (and fortunately found) passport forced them back to eighth place, narrowly edging out U-Turned team Seth and Olive who were eliminated from the race. \n"}, {"text": "Teams started the fourth leg of the race looking for whose former home in Stone Town?", "correct": "Freddie Mercury", "options": ["David Bowie", "Michael Jackson", "Billy Idol"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreddie Mercury.\n\n\tTeams left the third Pit Stop in front of the Emerson on Hurumzi Rooftop Tea House to find that they would need to work out the location of their next clue in the city of Stone Town, specifically taking them to the childhood home of Farrokh Bulsara.  If they could work this out or use the song title in their clue, they would understand they would have to stop at Freddie Mercury's home from when he grew up in Zanzibar.  The clue box would be on the second floor. \n"}, {"text": "How many teams completed the 'Lock' Detour task in Stone Town (in Leg 4)?", "correct": "Five & 5", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive & 5.\n\n\tGetting their clue from the Mercury House, teams opened a Detour that required a choice between 'Lock' and 'Knock'.  In 'Lock', teams wandered to the Al-Tamimi Curio Shop to search through hundreds of trapdoor-laden Zanzibar wardrobes to find one that contained a key.  If their key fit in one of the ornate locks in the shop, they could unlock a chest to receive their next clue.  Liz and Michael, Matt and Redmond, Brooke and Scott, Becca and Floyd, and Shamir and Sara completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "Teams collected which of these from royal doors in Stone Town's 'Knock' Detour option (in Leg 4)?", "correct": "Wood carvings", "options": ["Keys", "Stamps", "Greetings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWood carvings.\n\n\tIn the 'Knock' Detour task, teams travelled through Stone Town on foot, looking for several one-of-a-kind doors that denoted royal status in the city (one at Soko Muhogo Street, one at the House of Wonders, and one at the Arab Fort).  If they could find the doors marked with a serpent, lion, and falcon crest, they could knock on each, retrieve wood carvings, and trade the three for their next clue at a local carving shop.  Vanck and Ashton, Tara and Joey, and London and Logan managed to seek out the proper spots. \n"}, {"text": "Teams engaged with metalworking during the Road Block task in Leg 4.  What did they need to make?", "correct": "Strainer", "options": ["Phone case", "Pinwheel", "Toy train"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrainer.\n\n\tOnce teams left the Detour they could get on a ferry and return to the city of Dar es Salaam whereupon they could find their Road Block at the metal shop at the DASICO Umasida Dispensary.  Here, one member of each team was selected to take an aluminum sheet and create a ladle strainer.  After crushing, punching holes, pounding metal, and attaching a handle, they could offer the utensil up to the secretary in charge, for their next clue.  Becca, Vanck, Joey, Michael, Redmond, Logan, Brooke, and Shamir completed this task, some with greater difficulty than others. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated in eighth place at the end of Leg 4?", "correct": "Shamir and Sara", "options": ["Vanck and Ashton", "Brooke and Scott", "London and Logan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShamir and Sara.\n\n\tWrapping up the fourth leg of the race, teams headed out from their Road Block and proceeded to Coco Beach where Phil would be waiting for them at the mat.  Despite initial hesitations with the Detour, Tara and Joey made it to the mat in first place and won themselves $5,000 USD each (taking the lead spot off Liz and Michael).  Shamir and Sara, who left the previous Pit Stop in last place, were unable to catch up due to their faltering at the Detour.  Phil came out to the Road Block to eliminate them before they could reach Coco Beach. \n"}]}
