One of its main tenets was the adoption of the vernacular style of writing for Chinese scholarly use. What was this movement called?", "correct": "May 4th Movement", "options": ["February 3rd Movement", "May 1st Movement", "June 1st Movement"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMay 4th Movement.\n\n\tUsually, the dates for the May 4th Movement are set at between 1915 and 1925.  The movement is named for an incident that took place in China in 1919.  Hundreds of Chinese students and intellectuals were protesting the Chinese government that had bowed to Japanese demands in 1916 for a number of concessions.  While China's very sovereignty was being challenged, the countries of the West, meeting at Versailles, turned a cold shoulder...ignoring China's plight.  The 'incident' involved some opression, and further spurred calls for radical changes. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following scholars was the main instigator of the move toward the use of 'bai hua', or the vernacular language?", "correct": "Hu Shi", "options": ["Lu Xun", "Lao She", "Zhu De"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHu Shi.\n\n\tPrior to Hu Shi's promotion of 'bai hua', most Chinese literature was written in the classical 'wen yan wen' style.  Hu Shi felt that the classical Chinese writing system was arcane, archaic and too difficult to master, so he promoted the use of a more colloquial style of Chinese in the written form.  Hu Shi also promoted the ideas of 'Mr. Science' and 'Mr. Democracy', as a way of importing 'Western' learning into China. \n"}, {"text": "During the late 1950s, another movement was instigated by Mao Zedong. He called for a blossoming of intellectual intercourse and suggested that people were free to criticize the government. What was this ill-fated movement called?", "correct": "Hundred Flowers Movement", "options": ["Intellectual Bloom Movement", "Great Leap Forward", "Free Thought Movement"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHundred Flowers Movement.\n\n\tThe so-called Hundred Flowers Movement soon came to an end as hundreds of intellectuals used the opportunity to freely malign Mao and his questionable policies. Afterwards, thousands of the intellectuals were rounded up and 're-educated'. \n"}, {"text": "What was the full name of the cultural movement that historians define as occurring in China from 1966-1976?", "correct": "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution & Cultural Revolution", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreat Proletarian Cultural Revolution & Cultural Revolution.\n\n\tIt is correctly referred to as the 'Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution' or 'Wen Hua Da Ge Ming', but I also have accepted the shortened form 'Cultural Revolution', just to be a nice guy! \n"}, {"text": "In 1979, a movement was started wherein intellectuals could write complaints and grievances on posters and place them on a wall in Beijing. What was this movement called?", "correct": "Democracy Wall Movement", "options": ["Post-Mao Moderation Movement", "Big Poster Movement", "Flowering Thought Movement"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDemocracy Wall Movement.\n\n\tThe Democracy Wall Movement also ended abruptly as the government once again became threatened by the level of open criticism displayed on the many 'big-character' posters placed on the wall.  Wei Jingsheng is probably the most famous dissident involved in this movement.  After a dozen or so years in prison, he was released and allowed to go to the United States.
