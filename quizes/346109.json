{"id": "346109", "name": "Those Amazing Amish Quiz | Christianity | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "Christianity", "Non-Conformist Denominations"], "questions": [{"text": "At around the age of 18 members of the Amish community may undergo trine immersion, which is a form of which of the following religious ceremonies?", "correct": "Baptism", "options": ["Rumspringa", "Confirmation", "Shunning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaptism.\n\n\tTo become an adult member of the Amish community a young adult undergoes baptism. While many other Christian churches baptize their members as babies, the Amish church waits until adulthood, believing that it is not until this age that a person can make an informed decision. Trine immersion refers to baptism by immersion three separate times, which symbolizes the belief in the concept of the Trinity. Baptism may also be performed by pouring rather than immersion. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the building in which religious services are held?", "correct": "They are held in the members' homes", "options": ["Cathedral", "Temple", "They are held in the community school"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are held in the members' homes.\n\n\tReligious services are held weekly or bi-weekly and rotate from home to home. Most Amish homes have one room with walls that can be moved to enlarge it. The Amish, as a rule, do not have any kind of separate church or temple. This is just one of the many practices designed to encourage the closeness and identity of each congregation. \n"}, {"text": "What is the Ordnung, which is a very important part of the Amish daily life?", "correct": "The set of rules that govern Amish life", "options": ["The breed of horses used by the Amish", "The skill of woodworking", "The Amish Bible"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe set of rules that govern Amish life.\n\n\tThe Ordnung is the set of rules followed by the Amish that rules all facets of their lives. Because each assembly is separate, each has its own set of rules. These rules are usually unwritten and are passed on verbally and by example. The word comes from German and loosely translates as discipline, rule, or order. The Ordnung creates boundaries, and helps to provide the powerful sense of group identity which governs all aspects of Amish life. \n"}, {"text": "If you were to witness an Amish religious service of any kind you might see an \"Ausbund\" being used. Just what is this important part of the Amish religious life?", "correct": "Songbook", "options": ["A small pillow for kneeling", "Prayer beads", "A beaker of communal wine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSongbook.\n\n\tThe Ausbund is credited as being one of the oldest songbooks in continual use. The hymns it contains are hundreds of years old and were all written by Amish forefathers. The book does not contain any musical notes and the melodies are passed down from one generation to the next. Most of these songs are about the singer's faith in God and the condition of human suffering. The use of an organ or of any musical instrument is not permitted and is looked at as worldly and irreverent. \n"}, {"text": "The Amish are often considered to be an off-shoot of which of the following denominations? ", "correct": "Mennonites", "options": ["Puritans", "Shakers", "Quakers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMennonites.\n\n\tThe Amish are an ethno-religious group that is often considered to be related to or descended from the Mennonite church. Both are considered to be Anabaptist denominations which are a group of Protestant Christian churches that came about in the 16th century. The term Anabaptist refers to the rebaptism of adults who had been baptized while they were babies, a practice seen in the Roman Catholic Church.While the Amish and the Mennonites are similar, the Amish follow much stricter rules and have not urbanized nor integrated themselves into mainstream culture in the same fashion as the Mennonites. \n"}, {"text": "In which one of these states would you be least likely to encounter a Amish community?", "correct": "Florida", "options": ["Pennsylvania", "Indiana", "Ohio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlorida.\n\n\tIndiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania have significant populations of Amish communities as does the state of New York. There are also populations in Ontario, Canada. While there are small populations in a dozen other states, the vast majority of Amish are found in the rural areas of these states. Each community is slightly different from the rest, but the differences are very minor. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Amish practice in which social contact is limited in an effort to shame a person into returning to the church?", "correct": "Shunning", "options": ["Avoiding", "Rejecting", "Ignoring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShunning.\n\n\tShunning is when the community deliberately avoids someone in an effort to get them to change a behavior which is not accepted. Because the Amish do not have much significant social contact with outsiders, being shunned by the community can be very painful. It is, usually, the last step before excommunication. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following best describes Amish beliefs about divorce?", "correct": "Divorce is forbidden and formal separation is very rare", "options": ["Divorce is only granted if the bride proves to be infertile", "Divorce is easy to obtain and no stigma is attached", "Divorce is only granted after a separation of 10 years"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDivorce is forbidden and formal separation is very rare.\n\n\tThe Amish believe that marriage is sacred and divorce is forbidden. Very rarely separation is allowed and only under the most dire circumstances. Infertility is looked at as \"the will of God\". Divorce will cause excommunication for both parties. It is common for someone whose spouse has died to remarry. \n"}, {"text": "The Amish do not use the Bible. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe Amish are a Christian denomination and do use the Bible. They usually use the German Martin Luther Bible. When using an English Bible they generally use the King James translation. Many of the Amish speak a dialect known as Pennsylvania German or Pennsylvania Dutch. Each community has its own dialect that is usually a mixture of old Dutch and German. Most Amish are also fluent in English and speak this language anytime outsiders are around. \n"}, {"text": "Since the turn of the 20th century, many Amish groups have allowed women to serve as bishops, ministers, and deacons.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhile the Amish religion does have bishops, ministers and deacons, they are all men. That rule did not change at all in the 20th century. Gender roles are very separate and strictly enforced. Unlike many other Christian denominations which have eased their rules on the involvement of females in religious matters, the Amish have not followed suit and are unlikely to do so anytime in the near future. \n"}]}
