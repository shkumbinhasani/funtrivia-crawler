That night, he enters his room through the window and two people are sleeping in the bed.  That's the point though.  He bashes the head of the male occupant in with a lamp and his wife awakens, screaming.  He tells her to swear on Satan that she'll stop, but she doesn't, so he goes for her neck.  She's able to escape into the hallway, but Mr. March holds her aside for his guest.\rDet. Lowe receives a call to his hotel room from his daughter, Scarlett, who's staying at her grandmother's for Halloween.  During the call, Lowe realizes that blood is leaking...in pretty large amounts...from the corner of his ceiling. \n"}, {"text": "On what day of the year was Miss Evers' son abducted?", "correct": "Halloween", "options": ["Christmas", "Thanksgiving", "Easter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalloween.\n\n\tMiss Hazel Evers, washing bedsheets in the bathtub of a room in the Hotel, fears that she can't remove the blood from it.  She thinks back to 1925 when she took her son out to trick or treat for Halloween...when her boy was abducted.  Det. Lowe knocks on the door to the room to find her distraught and, soon, they both discover that they have their disappearances in common.  She invites him in for sherry but, since he doesn't drink, he just pours her one and joins for a chat.\rShe explains that the killer took him to a ranch outside the city, locking him into a chicken coop until he was killed.  She never found out what really happened to him...but the bones were placed into a mass grave.  She tells John that the two of them are kindred spirits...but she can't speak too much more since her master's autumnal banquet is coming up. \n"}, {"text": "When Alex checks Holden's temperature, she discovers that he's running a high fever.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlex returns home...but not alone...she brings Holden with her.  Things are odd from the very beginning though; Holden hates the sunlight; the family dog seems distraught; his internal temperature seems too cold.  Holden says that he's thirsty, and Alex gets him some juice.  She doesn't know what he's actually thirsty for.  When she comes back to the living room, Holden's taken the dog out of the bathroom to drink his blood.  He demands his other mommy.\rAt the office, John discovers that the blood on Gabriel's body wasn't his own, so there's now a missing person out there.  He also takes the opportunity to find out about the murders in the Wineville chicken coop...only to find out they happened eighty-five years ago. \n"}, {"text": "Who abducted Holden in 2010?", "correct": "The Countess", "options": ["Donovan", "Iris", "Mr. March"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Countess.\n\n\tHolden brings his mother back to the Hotel Cortez and heads to the stairs while Alex follows to the empty pool.  She's surprised to find four glass coffins in the bottom of the pool, and Holden heads into his as it shuts him in.  She doesn't notice the Countess behind her until she speaks, claiming to have answers.\rThe discovery made, Elizabeth brings Alex up to her penthouse to talk.  The Countess says that she never kidnapped Holden; she saved him from a life of neglect.  In 2010, in Santa Monica, she was there to take Holden from the Merry-Go-Round, and she walked off with him down the beach.  She insists that she's keeping him safe though...he's inherited an ancient blood disorder.  Alex pulls out a gun and aims it as The Countess makes an offer: she can be with Holden for eternity and inherit the same disease, but she must remain loyal to her at all costs.  Instead, Alex flees. \n"}, {"text": "What's the first alcoholic drink Det. Lowe orders at the Hotel Cortez?", "correct": "Double martini", "options": ["Bloody Mary", "Rum and coke", "Screwdriver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDouble martini.\n\n\tJohn, walking to the bar of the Hotel Cortez, arrives to find Liz Taylor there, alone.  For the first time since his arrival, John asks for a double martini instead of a non-alcoholic drink.  While his back is turned John doesn't notice the new arrival to the hotel, Aileen.  Liz says that Aileen has been coming to the hotel for Devil's Night every year for a decade. That's when he recognizes her-- Aileen Wuornos-- but he believes that she's just dressed up for Halloween.  Sipping at his martini, John says that Aileen probably made a lot of mistakes, killing the men she did.  The two of them head up to John's room despite Liz's protest...and before they make it there, Aileen knocks him out and ties him to a chair. Fortunately, he's able to break free and handcuff her to the sink in his bathroom. \n"}, {"text": "Was Det. Lowe formally invited to the Devil's Night banquet?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tJohn rushes downstairs to the front desk to use the phone and call the cops but Liz Taylor tells him that there's no use; even if he gets through to the police, Mr. March is too protective of his special guests on Devil's Night for them to get caught out.  John asks for an explanation, and it turns out the Devil's Night is an opportunity for the worst criminals and murderers to gather together for an exclusive dinner party.  By odd coincidence, Det. Lowe has been invited.  Liz hands him the invite and sends him up to his room.\rReturning, John finds everything as it was...except Aileen is gone, and a suit has been placed on his bed, courtesy of Liz. \n"}, {"text": "Which infamous figure is not present at Mr. March's banquet?", "correct": "Charles Manson", "options": ["John Wayne Gacy", "Jeffrey Dahmer", "The Zodiac Killer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles Manson.\n\n\tDet. Lowe reaches the seventh floor to the sound of old-timey music; the party is already underway.  Heading inside, Aileen apologizes for her behaviour and tries to get John to sit next to her, but Mr. March emerges and insists that everyone take the seats assigned by their name cards.  John is shocked-- Mr. March died eight decades earlier-- but he's told that he's lived at the Hotel Cortez long enough to know that illusions are not all they appear to be within its walls. The killers sitting at the table all took Mr. March's advice once upon a time, and they insist that if he follows in his footsteps he can achieve any vision. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following comprises the amuse-bouche course of Mr. March's banquet?", "correct": "Human", "options": ["Beef", "Chicken", "Fish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHuman.\n\n\tGacy handcuffs John to his seat at the table and the other killers try to convince him to see the light while he falls victim to the absinthe running through him.  Miss Evers arrives with the first courses...the amuse-bouche is a young man.  Jeffrey Dahmer starts to dig into him while the Zodiac Killer keeps a gun pointed at John at the head of the table. With the last of his strength, John pulls a gun and shoots Jeffrey, but it doesn't matter...he's already dead, after all.  While Richard Ramirez and Aileen Wuornos dance in the other room, Dahmer drills into his victim's skull and John passes out. \n"}, {"text": "Who delivers Mr. March's dessert course?", "correct": "Sally", "options": ["Liz Taylor", "Iris", "The Countess"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSally.\n\n\tSally lights up a smoke in front of the Hotel Cortez and chats it up with a man dressed in a business suit.  He says that he doesn't need a costume to have fun and says that he'll be happy to enjoy whatever she's selling.\rAt the banquet, John awakens to find Jeffrey still toying with his now-braindead victim.  Mr. March is disappointed that John does not yet have the dark thoughts he seems destined to have.  Nonetheless, he has a toast.  Mr. March commends his guests for epitomizing the American dream, as he sees it, and for being equals to him.  Of course, that leads the banquet to dessert, and Sally walks the course in. \n"}, {"text": "Does Dr. Lowe agree to The Countess' suggestion to become immortal?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAs Sally gets her year of freedom from harassment for delivering the businessman from the street, Miss Evers brings out the knives they will be using to carve into dessert.  John, as it seems, is the only one not to raise a knife and join the others in their moment of bonding.  As the others take turns stabbing the victim, John falls out of his seat and turns to the door to see Sally...and nothing more.  He turns back to find the room empty.  Sally claims that he must have been drunk; the absinthe would've caused him to hallucinate and black out.  She says that she's there to protect him, and leads him out the door to his room.\rThe Countess, meanwhile, awaits Alex in her suite and, unsurprisingly, she arrives because she fears losing Holden again.  The two come to their agreement.  Seducing Dr. Lowe, she allows her to drink from her blood and inherit the disease to be with her son forever. \n"}]}
