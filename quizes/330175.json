{"id": "330175", "name": "\"Dream On\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "How does Will know Bryan Ryan?", "correct": "From school", "options": ["They were neighbours", "From parenting classes", "Terri is dating Sue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom school.\n\n\tPrincipal Figgins invites Will into his office in the beginning of the episode to meet the newest member of the school board: Bryan Ryan.  Will isn't thrilled.  The two of them were in Glee Club in high school and Bryan was two years older (and he got all the girls).  Bryan, as a member of the school board, now has control over the funding of the region's high school art programs. The plan is to cut the Glee Club.  As Bryan elaborates, he states that while glee Club was his life and he hit the big time after his show choir training, he came crashing down when his dreams were shattered years later. Now, he runs a used Hummer dealership and considers himself 'reformed'.  In fact, he also runs a show choir conversion clinic for those suffering from the negative effects of show choir backgrounds.  Figgins makes Will let Mr. Ryan speak to the kids. \n"}, {"text": "What, according to what he wrote down, is Artie's dream?", "correct": "To be a dancer", "options": ["To direct movies", "To leave the county", "To sing on Broadway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo be a dancer.\n\n\tIn the choir room, Will introduces Bryan Ryan to the kids and says that his opinion is just one of many.  Bryan gets all of the kids to write down their biggest dream on a piece of paper before telling them all that it will never come true.  He says that 91% of them will remain in the same county and that while most of them probably mentioned something about showbiz in their dreams, those are the most unrealistic.  He points out Will as a prime example of this and causes Tina to cry during his lecture.  Will asks him to leave and Bryan simply says that his job to find something to cut from the budget is that much easier.\rIn the library, Artie tells Tina that since his dream probably won't come true in front of the camera, he should find work behind the camera instead.  As Tina discovered after reading his dream (found crumpled up in the garbage can thanks to Bryan Ryan) he wanted to be a dancer instead.  Since Will never assigned the kids a song theme for the week, Tina asks Artie if he'd like to figure out a dance number with her. \n"}, {"text": "Upon searching through the school library, Rachel believes her mother is which of these?", "correct": "Patti LuPone", "options": ["Barbra Streisand", "Sarah Brightman", "Bernadette Peters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatti LuPone.\n\n\tJesse returns from spring break to find Rachel practicing ballet in a room at the school and she says that despite Bryan Ryan's speech, she's known her dream since she was four.  Jesse consoles her saying that her dreams are an inevitability and that she has no reason to be stressed.  When Jesse asks what she thinks her dream is, she says it's to know what her mom is like.  She doesn't need to meet her, she just wants to know something, but she's okay with it not happening.  Jesse vows to help her.  After searching the library, Rachel believes her mother to be Broadway legend Patti LuPone.  Jesse convinces her otherwise.\rArtie and Tina practice a tap routine in the choir room with Artie using tap wheels on his chair.  He figures that it doesn't sound too good and he tries to use crutches (borrowed from a student with cerebral palsy) instead.  When he tries to take a few steps, he falls over and asks Tina to leave. \n"}, {"text": "Bryan Ryan never dated Terri in high school.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWill finds Bryan in one of the Home Economics classrooms and decides to invite him out for a drink at a local bar, firstly for old-times sake and secondly to convince him not to destroy Glee Club.  They talk about high school and what happened after the fact.  Bryan mentions that Terri was the one that got away and Will is surprised to find that hes referring to his own ex-wife. Will mentions that Glee Club is what got him through the rough times, even now.  Bryan finally breaks down and says that he's been living a lie.  Since he stopped performing he hates what he has become.  Will decides to turn this around by turning on a nearby jukebox. He and Bryan duet to Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\", a song Bryan sang solo at Sectionals in 1992.  Will also convinces Bryan to try out for a local stage production with him. \n"}, {"text": "For what play do Will and Bryan audition?", "correct": "Les Miserables", "options": ["Hairspray", "Rent", "Wicked"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLes Miserables.\n\n\tTina and Artie apologize to each other about the issue in the choir room and Tina comments that she researched new treatments for spinal cord injuries.  Even though it's far-fetched, he shouldn't give up on his dreams.  Tina gives Artie a kiss before departing.\rRachel shows Jesse some of her boxes of baby stuff and they root through some of the (somewhat creepy) items from her infancy from singing awards to baby teeth.  Unbeknown to Rachel, Jesse takes a recorded tape from his pocket labeled 'From Mother to Daughter' and claims that it was in one of the boxes.  He urges her to play it but she decides that she can't as she's not ready.  Rachel asks Jesse to leave.\rWill and Bryan arrive at their \"Les Miserables\" audition and realize that they're both going for the same role...with the same song.  The director makes them perform a duet of their choice: \"Dream On\" by Aerosmith. \n"}, {"text": "What song does Artie daydream dancing to in the mall?", "correct": "The Safety Dance & Safety Dance", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Safety Dance & Safety Dance.\n\n\tArtie and Tina head to the mall and Artie buys a pair of tap shoes (as an investment in his future).  When Tina offers to go buy Artie a pretzel he surprises her by saying that he went to a doctor to start the therapies she researched.  He literally gets up out of his chair and begins walking.  Now that he can move around, all he wants to do is dance. He walks across to a stereo unit and pops in a disc to sing and dance to his own version of \"The Safety Dance\" by Men Without Hats.  As he goes through his dance, a flash mob slowly forms and expands through the mezzanine of the mall.  By the end of the song, however, Artie drops back into his chair and reality- it turns out that the entire thing was a daydream. Tina returns with his pretzel and affirms himself that one day he will dance. \n"}, {"text": "What does Shelby Corcoran claim is her only regret?", "correct": "Not being in her daughter's life", "options": ["Not dating Will", "Not auditioning for her Glee Club", "Not staying in New York when she had the chance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNot being in her daughter's life.\n\n\tBryan Ryan has a talk with Sue Sylvester in her office regarding cutbacks and both of them back up their reasoning with strong arguments about the values of arts vs. physical education.  Sue is able to hold her ground quite well though and says that while it may be a tad over the top to pay for skydiving lessons for her Cheerios so that they can land on the field before their cheer, what she does actually makes a difference.  The two of them realize their angry sexual attraction towards one another as a result.\rJesse has a talk with Mrs. Corcoran in her car about the tape.  It turns out that Shelby is Rachel's mom and she gave birth to Rachel in order to earn money to live in New York.  She regrets never being in her daughter's life, but she signed a contract with her fathers.  She tells Jesse that he only needs to keep up the act for one more week and then he can go back to Vocal Adrenaline.  By then, Rachel will need to find Shelby or else she won't sleep at night. \n"}, {"text": "Bryan Ryan buys New Directions different items from the \"Jazz Hands\" catalogue for their choir.  Which of these is not included in his package?", "correct": "Microphones", "options": ["Jean jackets", "Tearaway dancewear", "Sheet music for Broadway musicals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMicrophones.\n\n\tArtie decides to have a talk with Emma in her office about the treatments for spinal cord injuries and while he's eager to see if any of the treatments work, she says that unfortunately, tests like those he's looking into are still in their infancy and he may not be able to reverse the damages to his spinal cord for a long time.  She recommends weekly appointments for him to come in for talks.\rBryan surprises the kids in Glee.  After siphoning funds from the Cheerios, he went shopping for their arts program and bought custom jean jackets (which Kurt jumps at), tearaway dance clothing, and sheet music for them to work from.  Sue is less than thrilled and puts an end to their excitement by informing Mr. Ryan that Will got the leading part in the \"Les Miserables\" casting call.  To rub it in, she tells Bryan that he got the menial role of 'townsperson'.  Bryan, his dream crushed again, decides to cut the program. \n"}, {"text": "Does Rachel listen to the tape planted by Jesse?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWill speaks to Bryan one final time at the local theater to convince him that Glee should not be cut from the school.  He tells him that he can't let him do it because he'd be turning the kids from stars into black holes.  To prove to him the importance of feeling like a star and having the confidence, Will gives up the lead role for Bryan, a gesture that easily saves the Glee Club.\rRachel finds Jesse in her room the next day as he places the planted tape into her player.  She tries to stop him but he assures her that she's ready to hear it.  What plays amazes Rachel and she pictures herself in a duet with her mother singing \"I Dreamed a Dream\" from \"Les Miserables\".  Though the two still have yet to meet, Rachel cries over the tape. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Tina perform her tap dance routine with at the end of the episode?", "correct": "Mike", "options": ["Finn", "Artie", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike.\n\n\tTina tries to convince Artie to dance with her, but he tells her that any of the other guys could dance better than he can.  Not only that, but he never will dance, and that's okay.  He has to focus on dreams he can make come true instead.  Tina still wants him to do the dance, but they settle on having Artie sing instead. When the two of them head to Glee practice, Will begins by informing the kids that Glee isn't being cut because Bryan Ryan took the lead role in the play.  He then introduces Tina's dance and she introduces her partner for the dance: Mike Chang.  To close the episode, the two of them tap while the others sit on the stage in a half-circle. Artie sings the song solo- \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" by The Mamas and the Papas and watches on as the girl he loves dances with another guy. \n"}]}
