Who was SUPPOSED to be at the scene with Holly when she was attacked?", "correct": "Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan)", "options": ["Gil Grissom (William Petersen)", "Jim Brass", "Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarrick Brown (Gary Dourdan).\n\n\tWarrick was assigned to \"shadow\" the rookie, Holly.  However, he skipped out on the assignment to place a bet for a corrupt judge.  As a result, Warrick felt quite a bit of guilt regarding Holly's eventual death. \n"}, {"text": "Where was Sara Sidle working prior to joining the Las Vegas CSI team?", "correct": "San Francisco", "options": ["Los Angeles", "Sacramento", "San Diego"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Francisco.\n\n\tIn the second episode, \"Cool Change,\" Grissom notes that he has invited Sara Sidle, \"from San Francisco,\" to join the team. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Friends and Lovers,\" one CSI investigates a case revealing that a funeral director (Kelly Connell), in order to lower his overhead costs, has been dumping corpses and re-using coffins.  Which CSI cracks this case?", "correct": "Sara", "options": ["Catherine", "Warrick", "Nick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSara.\n\n\tSara forced Funeral Director Randy Gesek to change his ways almost immediately.  Gesek has appeared in several other episodes since then. \n"}, {"text": "It's interesting that Kelly Connell plays a funeral director in \"CSI,\" since he has also played a medical examiner on another television series.  It seems that the actor likes to play roles involving corpses.  On what show did Connell play an M.E.?", "correct": "Picket Fences", "options": ["ER", "Homicide", "Gideon's Crossing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPicket Fences.\n\n\tConnell played Dr. Carter Pike on David E. Kelley's first hit show, \"Picket Fences,\" and also played a coroner on \"Chicago Hope\"!  Talk about typecasting. \n"}, {"text": "In the sixth episode, \"Who Are You?\", one CSI begins to cry when held at gunpoint by a woman who has just been identified as a murderer.  Which CSI needed a hankie while facing down the barrel of a pistol?", "correct": "Nick", "options": ["Catherine", "Warrick", "Sara"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNick.\n\n\tI was impressed with this scene, and with George Eads' believable reaction to the realization that he was probably seconds away from death.  Only a last-minute save from Grissom allowed Nick to walk away unharmed... and wipe his face a little.  =) \n"}, {"text": "In several first season episodes, Pamela Gidley plays a consulting anthropologist who seems to be a potential love interest for Gil Grissom.  What is this character's first name?", "correct": "Teri", "options": ["Sherry", "Keri", "Mary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeri.\n\n\tDr. Terry Miller appeared in three episodes the first season, but she and Gil never really did get a relationship going -- she literally ducked out in the middle of their first and only dinner date. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Unfriendly Skies,\" we learn that a man who was killed aboard a commercial airplane had a disease that no one on board knew about.  What was it?", "correct": "encephalitis", "options": ["AIDS", "lupus", "epilepsy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nencephalitis.\n\n\tEncephalitis is a viral inflammation of brain tissue that causes high fever, headaches, and erratic behavior.  The man was running a temperature of 101.6 and behaving belligerently, so eventually, a mob of passengers beat him to death! \n"}, {"text": "We learn in \"Anonymous\" that serial killer Paul Millander is taking the lives of innocent citizens with the same birthday: August 17.  This is not, of course, a coincidence -- Millander is, in his own twisted way, avenging the death of someone close to him who died on August 17.  Who was it?", "correct": "Millander's father", "options": ["Millander's sister", "Millander's mother", "Millander's brother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMillander's father.\n\n\tMillander's father, possibly a murder victim, died on August 17, but the police wrote it off as a suicide.  Millander, furious and confused (for a number of reasons, as would be revealed in the second season), went on to kill several men, staging their deaths to look just like the \"suicide\" of his father. \n"}, {"text": "What's the first name of Catherine's ex-husband, who is the father of her daughter Lindsey?", "correct": "Eddie", "options": ["Billy", "Tommy", "Bobby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEddie.\n\n\tEddie, played by Timothy Carhart, isn't the nicest guy around.  (He would later meet a fairly gruesome end in the third season... right in front of Lindsey.  Yikes.) \n"}, {"text": "All of the CSI team get along quite well by the end of the season, but early on, one CSI clashed bitterly with Jim Brass, to the extent that the words \"I hate you\" were used.  Whose relationship with Brass had a VERY rocky start?", "correct": "Warrick", "options": ["Gil", "Nick", "Catherine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarrick.\n\n\tBrass (who was a lot more cranky before getting transferred out of CSI in the second episode!) originally had a major problem with Warrick Brown, and vice versa.  During a heated exchange in the pilot, Warrick cried out, \"I hate you, man!  People walk every DAY because of you!\"  Later in the season, though, the animosity between the two mellowed considerably.  In the second season, in fact, Jim  -- and only Jim -- even came to refer to Warrick by the more familiar nickname \"Rick.\"  All's well that ends well, I guess. \n"}, {"text": "Nick Stokes runs into flirtatious prostitute and troublemaker Kristy Hopkins several times in the first season, sparking a number of nasty rumors about the level of their involvement in the police department and CSI.  True or False: Nick DID, in fact, have sex with Kristy.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAll was perfectly innocent in Kristy's first two appearances, but the third time the two met, in \"Boom,\" Nick did indeed spend the night with her.  Unfortunately for both of them, Kristy was found murdered hours later. \n"}, {"text": "In the episode \"Boom,\" Nick comes VERY close to being arrested for murder.  Only the tireless efforts of one of Nick's colleagues saves his career, since even being ARRESTED for a capital crime would result in his instant dismissal, regardless of the eventual findings of a court.  Who saves Nick's career by finding evidence to clear him as a murder suspect?", "correct": "Catherine", "options": ["Warrick", "Gil", "Nick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatherine.\n\n\tCatherine finds the murder weapon that took the life of Nick's friend and (one-time) lover, Kristy Hopkins, and finds on it the DNA of another man.  Nick is cleared, and he gratefully embraces his pal Catherine with all he's got at the end of the episode. \n"}, {"text": "Another serial killer rears his ugly head in \"The I-15 Murders.\"  Where does the killer routinely nab the women he later kills?", "correct": "supermarkets", "options": ["truck stops", "health clubs", "hotels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsupermarkets.\n\n\tThe killer turns out to be a truck driver who delivers meat and other products to supermarkets all over the southwestern United States.  He and his girlfriend trick unsuspecting female grocery shoppers into easy abductions, and then leave written messages on the stall doors of the ladies' rooms inside the markets. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Too Tough to Die,\" Gil tells Sara that she needs to have a \"diversion\" in her life, something to take her mind off of work.

The mother was willing to confess to the crime and go to prison to cover up this fact... but the CSI gang saw through the ruse, thanks to the evidence. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Justice Is Served,\" it's revealed that a woman has been using a certain type of dog to attack and kill joggers in order to harvest their organs.  What breed of dog does this woman regularly employ as a \"murder weapon\"?", "correct": "Great Dane/Mastifff mix", "options": ["Doberman Pinscher", "Rottweiler", "German Shepherd"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreat Dane/Mastifff mix.\n\n\tGrissom identifies toothprints in a dead jogger as belonging to a Great Dane, or a Dane/Mastiff mix.  Sure enough, when he gets to the suspect's house, he is greeted by an enormous Great Dane/Mastiff. \n"}, {"text": "True or False: We learn, in the first season, that Jim Brass has a daughter.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWe don't SEE her until the second season, but in the first season episode \"Justice Is Served,\" Brass mentions to a convicted child molester that he (Brass) has \"a teenage daughter,\" as a means of warning the felon to watch his mouth when referring to young girls. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Strip Strangler,\" the season finale, Gil Grissom corners yet another(!) serial killer, but, as he's on suspension, Gil is unarmed when he confronts the killer in a basement laundry room.

Which character does NOT appear in this touching little scene?", "correct": "Jim Brass", "options": ["Sara Sidle", "Catherine Willows", "Warrick Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJim Brass.\n\n\tIt's a \"CSI only\" breakfast, apparently -- no sign of Homicide Captain Brass.
