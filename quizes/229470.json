{"id": "229470", "name": "Ten Quick Steps to Becoming a Neopian Millionaire Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Neopets"], "questions": [{"text": "Possibly the easiest way to earn money (and possibly prizes) is by playing the Fruit Machine.  Where is the Fruit Machine found?", "correct": "Lost Desert", "options": ["Terror Mountain", "Mystery Island", "Faerieland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLost Desert.\n\n\tThe Fruit Machine can be found in Sakhmet City in the northeast end of the Lost Desert.  This is possibly one of the easiest games in Neopia since all you need to do is click a button.  If the three Neopets playing the game pull up three of the same cards, you'll win a lot of money.  If they pull up two of the same cards, you're also likely to win something!  Occasionally, certain sets of cards will get you desert food and even Petpets.  This game has no cost, so it's a good way to earn and save those precious Neopoints.  You can only play it once every day. \n"}, {"text": "Tombola on Mystery Island is an easy way to get good items and a bit of extra cash.  Which ending number (on your ticket) will result in a booby prize (or possibly nothing at all)?", "correct": "7", "options": ["0", "2", "5"], "explanation": "\n\n\n7.\n\n\tIn order to win Tombola, you need to pull a ticket ending in 2, 5, or 0.  Some of the prizes of the game are better than others.  In fact, you could wind up getting a nice codestone for the dojo on the island, or even a Faerie.  These prizes are usually given along with a Neopoints prize.  If you don't get a ticket ending in one of these numbers, you'll get a booby prize. It's usually something from the Tiki Tack shop next door.  If the Tombola Owner feels sorry for you, he may still give you some Neopoints, but occasionally, you'll get no booby prize at all.  This game doesn't cost money, and you don't lose a thing, and occasionally, the owner will ask for donations, but these aren't required. \n"}, {"text": "The Money Tree in Neopia Central can give some goodies if you're quick enough.  What location, similar to the Money Tree, is located in Meridell?", "correct": "Meridell Rubbish Dump", "options": ["Meridell Compost Heap", "Meridell Junk Pile", "Meridell Barnyard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeridell Rubbish Dump.\n\n\tIf you want to become a Neopian Millionaire, don't go to the Meridell Rubbish Dump.  You'll literally find nothing but gravy and maybe a gross shoe.  If you're starting your plan to become a millionaire, head to the Money Tree, and if you're lucky, you can get one of the donations left there.  Occasionally, some ghosts will steal money from you and put it into the money tree as well. \n"}, {"text": "A quick way to make money is by the wheel-type games.  Which of these is not a real game?", "correct": "Wheel of Riches", "options": ["Wheel of Excitement", "Wheel of Misfortune", "Wheel of Mediocrity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWheel of Riches.\n\n\t\"Wheel of Excitement\" is probably the best choice for money, but there's a good chance you might also lose a bit of money (or get your pet sick).  It's found in Faerieland.  \"Wheel of Mediocrity\" and \"Wheel of Monotony\" are both found in Tyrannia.  The \"Wheel of Mediocrity\" is a much less interesting \"Wheel of Excitement\" while \"Wheel of Monotony\" may spin for hours. \"Wheel of Knowledge\" is the most expensive, but it's in Brightvale, and you can win numerous prizes.  \"Wheel of Misfortune\" is in the Deserted Fairgrounds of the Haunted Woods.  Regardless of where the wheel lands, you're probably not going to be happy with it.  All of the wheels cost a bit of Neopoints, but you could possibly win numerous riches. \n"}, {"text": "Scratchcards are a good way to earn large sums of money.  How many different panels can you scratch on a single scratchcard?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["One", "Three", "Nine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tScratchcard Kiosks are found on Terror Mountain, in the Haunted Fairgrounds, and in Sakhmet City in the Lost Desert.  Each of these costs a different amount of money, and each has different prizes.  When you get a scratchcard, you can scratch six panels, and if you get three matching panels, you win that prize.  All of the scratchcard kiosks have certain jackpots which can only be won through certain cards. \n"}, {"text": "Cheat! is a great game that gets you quite a bit of Neopoints if you can play it correctly.  How many different opponents are there in this game?", "correct": "Nine", "options": ["Seven", "Ten", "Twelve"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine.\n\n\tThese opponents range from the easy-to-beat Capara the Kyrii to the fiendish Spectre.  After beating all seven rounds of this game, you'll get a gold trophy for your cabinet, and you'll most likely earn plenty of Neopoints along the way.  If you manage to catch someone cheating, then you'll earn Neopoints.  These can accumulate to thousands of Neopoints over the rounds.  You also receive a bonus after beating different rounds.  Beating Capara the Kyrii will get you an avatar. \n"}, {"text": "You could probably hit it big by winning Keno.  Where can the Neopian version of Keno be found?", "correct": "Tyrannia", "options": ["Terror Mountain", "Lost Desert", "Maraqua"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTyrannia.\n\n\tIn Grarrl Keno, you need to choose up to ten numbers (on Grarrl eggs) and place your bet.  If you happen to hatch a certain amount of the correct eggs, you can win the amount of money listed in the chart below the game.  You can bet 50 Neopoints plus 2 more Neopoints for every day you've been playing Neopets.  Betting 1 Neopoint could possibly win you 30,000 Neopoints!  You can also win an avatar from this game. \n"}, {"text": "Coltzan's Shrine has been rumored to give great riches.  How often can you visit the shrine?", "correct": "Every 12 hours", "options": ["Every 7 hours", "Every 9 hours", "Every 5 hours"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvery 12 hours.\n\n\tColtzan is a very nice Lupe; after all, he can raise your strength, defense, speed, hit points, and level.  Rumor has it that Coltzan will give away a million Neopoints to lucky visitors at a certain time.  If none of these happen to you, you could always find a Serf Lens or some burnt desert food.  Sometimes you won't find anything.  This feature is free and it's in the Lost Desert. \n"}, {"text": "Some more advanced players may want to get rich playing the Stock Market.  What is the name of the Commodity Broker Chia?", "correct": "Nigel", "options": ["Thyassa", "Adee", "Lupert"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNigel.\n\n\tNigel the Chia frequently talks on his cell phone and drives around in his convertible.  When most people talk about Neopian Stocks, they think about Nigel because he's frequently associated with the feature.  If you're interested, you can find a list of companies selling stocks and pick a few that you're interested in.  Watch out though, companies have gone bankrupt in the past!  Remember to buy low sell high! \n"}, {"text": "If you're lucky, try the Neopian Lottery.  How many numbers can you have on one of these lottery tickets?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Eight", "Seven", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tIn order to win the 1,000,000+ Neopoint prize, you need to match the most numbers.  If more than one person matches the most amount of numbers, then the prize for that lottery is divided amongst the winners.  To make your own lottery ticket, you'll need to use 100 Neopoints, but if you can win more than a thousand times that amount, then why not?  You get to choose between the numbers 1 and 30, and you can often find tickets randomly throughout Neopia. \n"}]}
