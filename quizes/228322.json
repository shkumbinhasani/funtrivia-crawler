{"id": "228322", "name": "Top Movies of 1986 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1980s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Eight young men from a tiny Indiana town do the impossible in this film.  With the guidance of a tough-as-nails former college coach, they bring themselves together as a team and, against all odds, win the Indiana state championship.  What is the title of this inspirational film starring Gene Hackman?", "correct": "Hoosiers", "options": ["One on One", "Hoop Dreams", "Winner Takes All"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoosiers.\n\n\t'Hoosiers', directed by David Anspaugh, is often voted as the best sports movie of all-time.  The story is roughly based on the true events surrounding the 1954 team from Milan High School in Indiana.  Everything about Hoosiers is excellent, from Hackman's acting to the love story between him and Barbara Hershey, to the fine supporting performance by Dennis Hopper (among others) to the basketball action. \n"}, {"text": "From the straightforward to the bizarre, we present 'Blue Velvet'.  Which decidedly non-mainstream Hollywood film director presented to the world his strange vision of smalltown America with this wonderfully disturbing film?", "correct": "David Lynch", "options": ["Robert Altman", "Mike Leigh", "Werner Herzog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Lynch.\n\n\tDavid Lynch is known for presenting strange imagery and exaggerated characterizations, and 'Blue Velvet' is a prime example of his oeuvre.  Dennis Hopper is perfect as the psychotic Frank, a man obsessed with dominance.  Isabella Rossellini is wonderfully vulnerable, and Kyle MacLachlan plays the naive prat ever so well.  Dean Stockwell practically steals the show as Frank's friend Ben, a white-faced weirdo with a penchant for singing into utility lights. \n"}, {"text": "'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is widely considered a classic, if not *the* classic, from the teen comedy category.  One of John Hughes several 1980s masterpieces, it features which actor, immortalized in the title role?", "correct": "Matthew Broderick", "options": ["Judd Nelson", "Anthony Michael Hall", "Robert Downey Jr."], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatthew Broderick.\n\n\tCould anyone else have played Ferris Bueller?  I'd like to think not.  Oddly enough, Broderick and fellow cast members Alan Ruck and Jennifer Grey were well into their 20s (Ruck was 29!) when they portrayed high school kids in this film.  Ben Stein and Charlie Sheen make notable appearances in this film, and who can forget Jeffrey Jones and Edie McClurg as Principal Rooney and his secretary Grace?  All of these ingredients make this film a definite classic. \n"}, {"text": "Named for a 1961 song by Ben E. King, what is the title of the 1986 film that sees four boys, played by Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell, venture a great distance to see the body of another kid approximately their age?", "correct": "Stand By Me", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStand By Me.\n\n\tRob Reiner directs this film, his classic (this or 'The Princess Bride').  The movie is based on a novella by Stephen King entitled 'The Body', which is set in Maine, not in Oregon as is the movie.  This is one of those rare movies that actually surpasses the original written work. \n"}, {"text": "Jeremy Irons is a Jesuit priest, while Robert De Niro is a slave trader, both located in the South American wilderness.  Though pitted against each other at the beginning, Irons is able to oversee De Niro's conversion to the Jesuit fold, and both eventually make battle against the expanding interests of the Portuguese.  What is this magnificent film called?", "correct": "The Mission", "options": ["Blood and Iron", "Fitzcarraldo", "Black Robe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mission.\n\n\tRoland Joff\u00e9 directs this film, based on the writing work of Robert Bolt.  Aidan Quinn and Liam Neeson also appear in the movie.  Perhaps the greatest highlight of this remarkable film is the score of Ennio Morricone, one of his very best. \n"}, {"text": "Woody Allen makes the list of 1986's top films with one of his very best, namely 'Hannah and Her Sisters'.  Who plays the title role of Hannah in this well-casted film?", "correct": "Mia Farrow", "options": ["Diane Keaton", "Darryl Hannah", "Shirley MacLaine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMia Farrow.\n\n\tMia Farrow, who else!  'Hannah and Her Sisters' probably features Allen's best ensemble cast, with Farrow being joined by Barbara Hershey, Carrie Fisher, Michael Caine, Dianne Wiest, Maureen O'Sullivan, Max von Sydow, J.T. Walsh, John Turturro, Daniel Stern, Julie Kavner (you may know her as Marge Simpson), Lewis Black, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Allen himself, as usual.  Both Caine and Wiest won supporting Oscars for their performances in this film. \n"}, {"text": "Which controversial director created what many believe to be his masterpiece in 'Platoon', the winner of the Best Picture Oscar for 1986?", "correct": "Oliver Stone", "options": ["Stanley Kubrick", "Wim Wenders", "Michael Cimino"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOliver Stone.\n\n\tI guess 'controversial director' was a dead giveaway.\r 'Platoon' was a well-casted, marvelously filmed piece of cinema.  Oliver Stone wrote this story as a response to the Vietnam that was portrayed in the 1968 John Wayne movie 'The Green Berets'.  While Wayne was making his movie, Stone was living the experience of an American soldier in Vietnam. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most charming and low-key films of 1986 was a prison film by director Jim Jarmusch.  Featuring the acting of Tom Waits, John Lurie and a hilarious Roberto Benigni, it depicts a prison escape by the three leads, and the events that follow afterward.  What is the title of this unassuming tale?", "correct": "Down By Law", "options": ["Mystery Train", "Dead Man", "Coffee and Cigarettes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDown By Law.\n\n\tFilmed in Jarmusch's usual black and white by Robert Muller, this movie really encapsulates Jarmusch's free-flowing style.  Alongside the three male leads appear Ellen Barkin and Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife.  Benigni's performance alone makes this terrific film worth watching. \n"}, {"text": "In 1986, a lovely French film directed by Claude Berri and entitled 'Jean de Florette' arrived at theaters.  What was the name of the sequel, also directed by Berri and released the same year? ", "correct": "Manon of the Spring", "options": ["The Wages of Fear", "The House by the Sea", "Babette's Feast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nManon of the Spring.\n\n\tBoth films are based on the novel by Marcel Pagnol.  Gerard Depardieu appears in the original as the title character, a hunchbacked inheritor of a farm who attempts to reap the harvest of his property, despite the machinations of two malevolent neighbors.  In the sequel, 'Manon of the Spring', the grown-up daughter of Jean de Florette (she played by the beautiful Emmanuelle Beart) gets revenge against the men who plotted against her father in the first film.  The magnificent actor Yves Montand is among those that star in both films. \n"}, {"text": "In 1986, director Tim Hunter filmed his masterpiece, the story of a high school boy who murders his girlfriend and then shows off her body to his listless friends.  What is the name of this unsympathetic tale that displays teen apathy at its most disturbing?", "correct": "River's Edge", "options": ["Mean Creek", "Mysterious Skin", "Dazed and Confused"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiver's Edge.\n\n\tDennis Hopper hits the trifecta in this quiz, appearing in his third movie!  In this film, he plays Feck, a weird recluse who shelters the teen murderer Samson 'John' Tollet (played ominously by Daniel Roebuck).  Keanu Reeves, Ione Skye and Crispin Glover (in a typically bizarro performance) also star.  The movie was loosely based on the real life murder of Marcy Conrad in Milpitas, California in 1981.\r On that happy note, thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it.  Please send me a note detailing your top 10 from 1986, particularly in the case that our list differs! \n"}]}
