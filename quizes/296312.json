{"id": "296312", "name": "Hard Arts & Books Mixed Bag 5 Quiz / Test | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Miscellaneous"], "questions": [{"text": "Which American thriller writer created the character Jack Ryan?", "correct": "Tom Clancy", "options": ["James Patterson", "Dan Brown", "Michael Crichton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Clancy.\n\n\tPresident John Patrick Ryan, born in 1950, first appeared in Tom Clancy's 1984 novel 'The Hunt for Red October'. In all, he has appeared in around a dozen Clancy novels, sometimes as the main character (eg. 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger') and sometimes in a cameo role (eg. 'Without Remorse'). Clancy's 2003 novel, 'Teeth of the Tiger', starred Ryan's son, Jack jr. \n"}, {"text": "What is the first name of Mr. Filch, Hogwarts' caretaker in the 'Harry Potter' novels?", "correct": "Argus", "options": ["Donald", "Albus", "McEwan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArgus.\n\n\tIn the films, Filch is played by English character actor David Bradley, a classic Shakespearean actor for much of his career.\rFilch is one of the only non-magicians at Hogwarts, and Harry catches him taking a 'teach-yourself course' at one point. His cat, Mrs. Norris, acts as his spy around the school as he tries to catch students wandering around out of hours. Appropriately, he is named after a 100-eyed Greek mythological creature, the Argus. \n"}, {"text": "Which ancient Greek dramatist's surviving satires include 'The Clouds', 'The Knights', 'Peace' and 'The Frogs'?", "correct": "Aristophanes", "options": ["Plato", "Sophocles", "Euripides"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAristophanes.\n\n\tAristophanes was a Greek comic dramatist born somewhere around 456 B.C. He is sometimes referred to as 'The Father of Comedy'. Around a dozen of his plays have survived intact, although there are known to have been at least four times that number originally.\rOf the alternatives, Plato was a contemporary of Aristophanes, although none of his plays have survived. Sophocles and Euripides were two of the three great Greek tragedians (Aeschylus being the third). Both were prodigious authors -- Sophocles had more than 120 plays to his name, while Euripides penned close to 100. \n"}, {"text": "Which 1975 bestselling novel by Judith Rossner was adapted into a 1977 Richard Brooks film starring Diane Keaton, Richard Gere and Tuesday Weld?", "correct": "Looking for Mr Goodbar", "options": ["The Island of Dr Moreau", "The Goodbye Girl", "A Bridge Too Far"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLooking for Mr Goodbar.\n\n\tTheresa Dunn is a New York schoolteacher. She is also a nymphomaniac and she regularly visits bars late at night in search of the ideal man -- Mr Goodbar. Each night, she takes home a man, has sex with him and then tells him to leave. One night, one of them attacks and kills her. (In the film version he gets jealous and threatens her.) For a change, Richard Gere plays the bad guy.\rThe alternatives are three more 1977 films: 'The Island of Dr Moreau' is based on an H.G. Wells novel and starred Burt Lancaster; 'The Goodbye Girl' (my all-time favorite movie) was written by Neil Simon and starred Richard Dreyfus and Marsha Mason; and 'A Bridge Too Far' was based on Cornelius Ryan's book (and adapted by William Goldman) and featured an all-star cast including Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier, Robert Redford, Anthony Hopkins and Sean Connery. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the fictional farmer on whose land many of the Beatrix Potter 'Peter Rabbit' tales take place?", "correct": "Mr McGregor", "options": ["Mr McDonald", "Mr McMichael", "Mr McIntyre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr McGregor.\n\n\tPeter and his sisters, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail made their debut in the 1902 book 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit'. In later episodes, we meet Peter's cousin, Benjamin, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle the hedgehog, Mr Tod the fox and Tommy Brock the badger. Always on the periphery of the stories are Mr and Mrs McGregor, whose garden Peter and his Friends regularly plunder.\rIn the 100 years since they first appeared, the stories have sold more than 150 million copies worldwide. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these notable Poles was born in 1810 in Zelazowa Wola, 30 miles west of Warsaw?", "correct": "Frederic Chopin", "options": ["Marie Curie", "Nicolaus Copernicus", "Henryk Sienkiewicz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrederic Chopin.\n\n\tA virtuoso pianist, Frederic Chopin is widely acknowledged as Poland's greatest composer. At the age of 20, he moved west, to France, his father's homeland. Never in the best of health, he died in Paris in 1849 at the age of just 39. His grave can be seen today in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, final resting place of many famous people. Chopin's grave is a popular attraction and is constantly covered with fresh flowers.\rOf the alternatives, Marie Curie, the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different fields, was born in Warsaw but much later than Chopin, in 1867; Henryk Sienkiewicz, winner of the 1905 Nobel Prize for Literature was born in 1846 in Wola Okrzejska, a village in eastern Poland; astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus  was born in Torun, a city of the Vistula River north of Warsaw, and much earlier, in 1473. \n"}, {"text": "In 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', which planet do the characters travel to in order to find the answer to 'The Ultimate Question'?", "correct": "Magrathea", "options": ["Bethselamin", "Kria", "Damogran"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagrathea.\n\n\tHome of the Magratheans, who had originally created the Earth, the economy of Magrathea is based on the manufacture of planets for 'the alien who has everything'. Famous residents of the planet include Slartibartfast, who won an award for the design of the Norwegian coastline. \rThe alternatives are three other planets from the 'trilogy': Bethselamin is a popular destination for inter-planetary tourists; Damogran is a boring planet containing a particularly uninteresting island named 'France' -- it was from Damogran that the 'Heat of Gold' (the prototype ship containing infinite improbability drive) was stolen; Kria is the home planet of the Azgoths, whose poetry is only exceeded in its awfulness by a human from Essex, so that the Vogons' destruction of Earth moves the Azgoths up into first place in the Universe. \n"}, {"text": "What was the first name of the poet Lord Byron?", "correct": "George", "options": ["John", "Henry", "Francis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge.\n\n\tBorn George Gordon Byron in 1788 in Hollis Street in London, he was known by various names in his early life... For a while, he went by the name John Byron Gordon, using his father's first name and adopting his mother's maiden name in order to lay claim to her Scottish estate. He went to school in Aberdeen as George Byron Gordon. He inherited his uncle's title at the age of 10, becoming Lord Byron, thus obviating the need for the double surname. \n"}, {"text": "Which classic novel begins: \"You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.\" ?", "correct": "Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein'", "options": ["H.G. Wells's 'The Invisible Man'", "Anthony Burgess's 'A Clockwork Orange'", "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMary Shelley's 'Frankenstein'.\n\n\tRemarkably, Mary Shelley had completed 'Frankenstein' before her 20th birthday. Alternatively titled 'The Modern Prometheus', it was first published anonymously in 1818 -- her name finally appeared on the third edition in 1831. Many people believe that Frankenstein is the name of the monster, but it is really the name of the scientist who created him -- Victor Frankenstein. \n"}, {"text": "Which Spanish painter was born in 1746 in Fuendetodos, a small town about 30 miles from Zaragoza, and lived to the age of 82?", "correct": "Francisco Goya", "options": ["Diego Vel\u00e1zquez", "Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo", "Joan Mir\u00f3"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancisco Goya.\n\n\tGoya is considered the last of the Spanish 'Old Masters' and the first of the modern era that produced the likes of Miro and Dali. Indeed, Goya himself changed his style dramatically. In his early years, he was official court artist to numerous Spanish monarchs and many of his works from that era are portraits or group pictures of the royal family of the day. In his later life, though, Goya's style changed... In 1793-94 he painted the series known as 'Fantasy and Invention', and between 1819-23 he produced his most famous works, known as 'The Black Paintings' which include 'Witches Sabbath', 'Fight with Clubs' and the haunting 'Saturn Devouring His Son'.\rThe alternatives are also Spanish painters: Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was born in Seville, but much earlier than Goya, in 1599; Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo was also from Seville, born in 1612; Joan Mir\u00f3 was from Barcelona and much later than Goya, born in 1893. \n"}]}
