{"id": "362132", "name": "Zombies-- Not Plants Quiz / Test | Plants vs Zombies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games L-P", "Plants vs Zombies"], "questions": [{"text": "When a large wave of Zombies plans to attack, they will often be led by which of these?", "correct": "Flag Zombie", "options": ["Zombie on a Horse", "Marching Band Zombie", "Colonel Zombie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlag Zombie.\n\n\tThe Flag Zombie is no different from any regular Zombie save for the fact that he notably carries a red flag to lead his troops across the yard/roof.  Regular Zombies are susceptible to pretty much everything, and while they're not the weakest enemies in the game, they're pretty darn close.  Found as early as the game's second level, the Flag Zombie is signified on a timer on the bottom of the screen and can appear several times in a single level depending.  His flag is red and has the image of a brain on it. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Zombies does not protect its head?", "correct": "Newspaper Zombie", "options": ["Buckethead Zombie", "Conehead Zombie", "Football Zombie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNewspaper Zombie.\n\n\tThe further you get in the game, the more certain Zombies will grow wise to your tactics of 'shoot-now-shoot-more-shoot-even-more'.  The Conehead Zombie appears first.  This Zombie will take a number of hits, protected by a pylon, before falling.  A Buckethead Zombie is similar; it'll have a stronger helmet.  The Football Zombie is the most powerful of these; he'll rush and charge at plants and be protected by a football helmet.\rNewspaper Zombies have no head covering.  While they carry a newspaper in front of them and get mighty grumpy when you shoot through it, they aren't the strongest out there. \n"}, {"text": "One Zombie will use which of the following as a shield?", "correct": "Screen door", "options": ["Frying pan", "Surfboard", "Table"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScreen door.\n\n\tThe Screen Door Zombie starts appearing in Stage Two of the game when night begins to fall.  Why is this significant?  Well, the Screen Door Zombie is partially protected from your projectiles, even though the window of the door is a screen.  To combat this, setting up Fume-Shrooms is an easy answer; their long-range shroom blasts will sluice through unlike a pea shot.  If the screen door proves too much trouble, use a Magnet-Shroom and put an end to it; they'll become a regular Zombie all over again. \n"}, {"text": "If a Zomboni smooths some ice on the battleground, what may appear as a result?", "correct": "Zombie Bobsled Team", "options": ["Zombie Hockey Player", "Zombie Luge", "Zombie Figure Skater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZombie Bobsled Team.\n\n\tThe Zomboni is a zombie riding (go figure) a zamboni ice smoother.  While neither of your yards or your roof will begin with ice, you'd better believe that the Zomboni's magic will create some in whatever lane he happens to ride down.  If the ice streak gets too long it may result in a Zombie Bobsled Team consisting of four Zombies appearing, sliding the length of the ice.  You can remedy the entire situation either by destroying the Zomboni early enough or by scorching the area with fire (ie. using a Jalapeno).  Both first appear in the backyard in Stage Three. \n"}, {"text": "When the pool is introduced, so is the Dolphin Rider Zombie.  Is the dolphin also a zombie?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tYes!  And beware, because he's on a mission!  While most of the zombies in the pool will be floating around in inner tubes (or, worse, with snorkel gear), some will carry their dolphins to the pool and swim around on them.  The dolphin allows the zombie, like the Pole Vaulting Zombie, to leap over one obstacle before disappearing.  The best option is to dispose of them before they even reach your barricade.  You may wonder how they got a dolphin and made it a zombie.  You may also consider wondering how plants can attack things, so start suspending your disbelief now. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Zombies carries an explosive device?", "correct": "Jack-in-the-Box Zombie", "options": ["Grenade Zombie", "Zombie Time Bomb", "Balloon Zombie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack-in-the-Box Zombie.\n\n\tThe Jack-in-the-Box Zombie makes himself known as he waltzes onto the scene.  Carrying an explosive toy he'll shuffle over to the nearest plants and, with a couple cranks of the box, spark an explosion to take out any plants in a one block radius from the bomb.  On the bright side, the explosion will also kill the Zombie.  Using a Magnet-Shroom will effectively take the bomb/box out of the Zombie's hands and render it ineffective, which is probably the safest result. \n"}, {"text": "What type of Zombie will steal your Flowerpots?", "correct": "Bungee Zombie", "options": ["Ladder Zombie", "Digger Zombie", "Balloon Zombie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBungee Zombie.\n\n\tBungee Zombies begin appearing on the roof levels in Stage Five of the game and really only exist to make your life more difficult.  The first way they do this is by claiming a target (which you will see in the form of a bullseye dropped from above) and dropping down to pick up whatever plant or pot is in that square of the battlefield.  The second way occurs when the Zombie inadvertently places more Zombies onto the field, usually during a final wave, in an attempt to get an upper hand. \n"}, {"text": "What small Zombie can be found accompanying Gargantuar?", "correct": "Imp", "options": ["Gremlin", "Zomboy", "Itty-Bitty Zombie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nImp.\n\n\tGargantuar, one of the largest and most powerful Zombies of the game, will stomp his way down a lane of the battlefield (slowly, thankfully), smashing plants in his way with a large club.  This can have a devastating effect on your flora if not controlled either with Jalapenos or Ice-Shrooms and blasted to smithereens.  If he gets close enough, he'll launch a smaller Zombie known as an Imp off his back.  The Imp is the weakest foe in the game, but since it can be thrown so deep into your defenses there is the distinct possibility that he won't even get hit depending on your setup. \n"}, {"text": "The final boss of the game is which of the following?", "correct": "Dr. Zomboss", "options": ["Super Zombie", "Patient Zero", "Zombie King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Zomboss\n\n\tDr. Zomboss is fought during the conveyor belt-style level 5-10, the last level of the game, on the roof of your house.  Armed with a gigantic zombie mech device, the evil doctor will send waves of dangerous enemies down the course, almost relentlessly, until his health is depleted.  To accomplish the feat of winning the battle you not only need to defend yourself from the oncoming hordes, but attack him with anything else in your arsenal; you will have some of the most powerful shrooms and catapults available to do so. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these elusive Zombies isn't seen until you play through the game a second time?", "correct": "Zombie Yeti", "options": ["Zombie Bigfoot", "Zombie Baby", "Zombie Chupacabra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZombie Yeti.\n\n\tThe Zombie Yeti is the last Zombie you'll encounter in the game, mainly because he's elusive enough not to be seen until a second playthrough.  If you make your way back into the game he'll appear in the later stages for the first time, then appear randomly in any stage thereafter.  He can be quick, dangerous, or frightened quite easily, but defeating him will result in a windfall of a few thousand dollars to spend at Crazy Dave's shop (in the form of diamonds...as Yetis are wont to carry). \n"}]}
