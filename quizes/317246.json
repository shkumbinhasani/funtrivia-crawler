{"id": "317246", "name": "Painting by Numbers Quiz | Art | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Art By Subject"], "questions": [{"text": "One surprisingly small painting, showing one woman, in one innovative pose, with one mysterious and intriguing smile: our first work could only be the \"Mona Lisa.\" Who painted this masterpiece?", "correct": "Leonardo da Vinci", "options": ["Donatello", "Giotto di Bondone", "Titian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonardo da Vinci.\n\n\tDa Vinci (1452-1519) is admired today as the ideal Renaissance man: painter and sculptor, inventor and anatomist, dabbler in all the arts and sciences known in his day. The \"Mona Lisa\" is his best-known work. An unknown, dark-haired woman -- perhaps Milady, or Mona, Lisa, wife of the silk merchant Francesco Giocondo -- sits serenely on a balcony, her hands clasped on her lap.A faint smile plays about her eyes and lips. Behind her is a green and ochre landscape, in which we can see steep cliffs, a curved mountain road, and an arched bridge spanning a river. This groundbreaking work spawned countless imitators, but in the end, \"Mona Lisa\" sits alone. \n"}, {"text": "One of Michelangelo's most famous paintings tells the Biblical story of the creation of Man -- and it all comes down to two fingers. Adam, sculpted from clay, reclines on the ground; God, borne aloft by angels, extends a finger toward His creation; and their fingertips nearly meet in a moment that almost crackles with excitement. Where can this painting be found?", "correct": "The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel", "options": ["On a wall at Pompeii", "The Louvre, opposite the \"Mona Lisa\"", "The inside of the dome of Florence's cathedral"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.\n\n\tThe Sistine Chapel is an enormous room in the Pope's palace in the Vatican City. It was built in its current form by Pope Sixtus IV, for whom it was named, but it is best known for its artistic additions under Pope Julius II -- namely the magnificent ceiling painted by Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) between 1508 and 1512. He filled the nearly six thousand square feet with prophets, apostles, and Bible scenes, cunningly using the vaults of the ceiling to help him subdivide the \"canvas.\" The result of his long and uncomfortable labor is truly stunning, and leads to debilitating \"tourist's neck\" among visitors to Rome. \n"}, {"text": "Like many Renaissance artists, when Raphael wished to paint compositions of three people, he returned often to a certain theme: the Virgin Mary in full maternal splendor. In his \"Madonna of the Chair,\" painted in 1514, a serene Mary bows her head over the infant Jesus, held close on her lap; a second child, a toddler, gazes lovingly at her. Who was this second child, a regular in three-person \"Madonna\" paintings of the era?", "correct": "St. John the Baptist", "options": ["St. Peter", "St. Thomas, \"the Twin\"", "Judas Iscariot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. John the Baptist\n\n\tSt. John the Baptist, a cousin of Jesus, is famous in the Bible for his adult work -- performing baptisms in the Jordan River -- and for his gruesome martyrdom. But he is also known for a remarkably precocious act of faith: when the pregnant Virgin Mary visited his pregnant mother, St. John \"leapt for joy\" in the womb, so delighted was he by the presence of Christ (Luke 1:44).\r By the late fifteenth century, it had become fashionable to include him in depictions of holy maternal bliss -- perhaps in deference to the sweet tradition that, while Jesus and His family were in exile in Egypt, the young St. John was flown there by angels so that he could play with his divine cousin. He is often shown carrying a thin cross, made from river reeds, and that is how Raphael Sanzio (1483-1520) painted him in the bright, tender \"Madonna of the Chair.\" \n"}, {"text": "Hanging on a wall of the Louvre are four 1573 paintings by Giuseppe Arcimboldo: \"Spring,\" \"Summer,\" \"Autumn\" and \"Winter.\" Each canvas depicts the head of a man in profile -- but there is something very unusual about these portraits. What is it?", "correct": "Each \"head\" is really an arrangement of plants representing the season of the year.", "options": ["Each man holds sprigs of seasonal spices between his teeth.", "Each man is a different age, representing the seasons of life.", "Each man is painted in a different style, according to the seasons of art history."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEach \"head\" is really an arrangement of plants representing the season of the year.\n\n\tArcimboldo's (1527-1593) fantastic imagery continued to inspire artists centuries later: a 1987 exhibition in Venice, showcasing work by 20th-century Surrealist artists, was titled \"The Arcimboldo Effect.\" His famous series \"The Four Seasons\" makes it obvious why he has been so well remembered. For each season, Arcimboldo used cleverly arranged plants to pick out the shapes and colors of a man's face.\"Spring\"'s face is made of flowers, with cheeks that are literally roses; his neck is hidden by a ruff of daisies, and his doublet is made of dandelion and lettuce leaves. The face of \"Summer\" is one of cherries, squash, plums and corn; \"Autumn\" draws his features from apples, potatoes, grapes and gourds.Even \"Winter\" -- balding on top where the tree that forms his face has lost its leaves -- fastens his collar with a pair of citrus fruits. \n"}, {"text": "There are five people in the 1669 painting \"The Return of the Prodigal Son\": a  repentant young man kneels before his father, as three other men look on. This was not the artist's first depiction of this Bible story: 34 years earlier, he had produced a famous portrait of himself as the Prodigal Son in happier times, which was an excellent excuse to paint his wife Saskia on his lap. Who was the Dutch Grand Master who painted these works?", "correct": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "options": ["Jan van Eyck", "Hans Holbein", "Johannes Vermeer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRembrandt van Rijn.\n\n\tThe Parable of the Prodigal Son, recounted by Jesus in Luke 15:11-32, tells of a younger son who demands his inheritance in advance, squanders it on high living in a distant place, and becomes destitute. The penitent man returns to his father's household intending to beg a place as a servant, but his father welcomes him back with a feast of thanksgiving.\r Rembrandt (1606-1669) was one of many painters to mine this tale for artistic effect. The story lends itself to his expressive style, both in the riotous tavern scene and in the deep, scarcely-contained emotion of the Prodigal Son's return. \n"}, {"text": "In 1888 and 1889, a Dutch artist painted three versions of his bedroom in Arles, France. In each version, there are six paintings hanging on the room's blue walls; some of them recall other works by the same artist. Who painted this gentle tableau of a room with decidedly odd corners?", "correct": "Vincent Van Gogh", "options": ["Paul Gauguin", "Georges Seurat", "Jan van Eyck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVincent Van Gogh.\n\n\tVan Gogh (1853-1890) spent a little over a year in Arles, in the south of France, and produced a number of beautiful works there. Among the night caf\u00e9s and the sunflowers, he decided to paint his bedroom, a simple and colorful refuge from a turbulent mind. The room was not a rectangular shape, which gives the paintings an odd, off-balance quality.\r Although the three \"Bedroom in Arles\" pictures are very similar, there are differences -- especially in the six pictures on the wall. Most of these are not painted in enough detail to tell much about them, but a few are recognizable. For example, the bedroom in Version 1 (now at Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum) sports its creator's portraits of Eug\u00e8ne Boch (a poet) and Paul-Eug\u00e8ne Milliet (a soldier). The third-version bedroom, now at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, displays a painting that looks very like one of Van Gogh's known self-portraits. \n"}, {"text": "There's an old joke that runs like this: 6 is afraid of 7 because, well, 7 ate 9. Seven has always been a rather surreal number, so of course it turns up in one of Salvador Dal\u00ed's most famous works. Several distorted, melting clocks adorn a beach; the largest of these, a gold watch folded over a wooden block, shows a time of nearly seven o'clock. What is the title of the painting?", "correct": "The Persistence of Memory", "options": ["The Children's Hour", "This Is Not a Clock", "In Search of Lost Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Persistence of Memory.\n\n\tDal\u00ed (1904-1989) was a Spanish painter, from Catalonia, who publicized the Surrealist movement partly through his striking paintings and partly through his eccentric behavior. Several of his works feature \"soft\" objects, which bend and melt in ways the actual, solid forms could never do; the four soft watches in 1931's \"The Persistence of Memory,\" folded and flowing over the surfaces, are the most famous examples. \n"}, {"text": "There are eight pathetic figures in Pablo Picasso's 1937 canvas \"Guernica\": a horse, a bull, a dead soldier and a dead infant, and four living people, grieving and desperate. Picasso painted this piece as a response to what tragic event?", "correct": "The bombing of the town of Guernica by German and Italian planes", "options": ["The unprovoked sinking of the passenger liner \"Guernica\" by a torpedo", "The death of Picasso's daughter, Guernica", "The eruption of Mount Guernica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bombing of the town of Guernica by German and Italian planes.\n\n\tGuernica is a town in the northeast corner of Spain, in the Basque country. It was mostly isolated from the fighting of the Spanish Civil War until April 26, 1937, when it was bombed by fascist forces allied with Francisco Franco. The town had stood between Franco's armies and the great city of Bilbao; afterward, it lay in ruins, with hundreds dead.\r The atrocity prompted international outrage; many, like Picasso (1881-1973) were moved to speak out against the horrors of war. The immense \"Guernica,\" 3.5 meters by 7.8 meters, is a study of pain, fear, grief and desolation in stark blacks and grays. \n"}, {"text": "For the number nine, we turn to Panel 59 of an epic sixty-painting series depicting the northward \"Great Migration\" of African-Americans after World War I. In this panel, a white guard watches nine black voters on Election Day; the caption says, \"In the North, they had the freedom to vote.\" Which artist painted this scene in the early 1940s?", "correct": "Jacob Lawrence", "options": ["Bob Thompson", "Gwendolyn Knight", "Kara Walker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJacob Lawrence.\n\n\tJacob Lawrence (1917-2000) came of age during the Harlem Renaissance. He was still a young man in 1940 and 1941 when he painted his \"Migration of the Negro\" series, which poignantly tells the story of how, over the course of twenty years, over a million African-Americans left the farms and plantations of the American South for the cities of the North.The paintings trace this history: from famine and violence in the South, to the trials of the long journey, to isolation and violence in the North -- the migrants were often unwittingly brought in as strikebreakers. Lawrence, who called himself a \"dynamic cubist,\" used bright colors and simple shapes to convey astonishing depths of emotion. \n"}, {"text": "Andy Warhol and his Pop Art bring us to ten. In the early 1960s, he began a series of works, all depicting a certain everyday object. His 1969 addition to the series showed ten of the objects, neatly arranged in two rows of five. What are the ordinary items that Warhol made fascinating?", "correct": "Campbell's Soup cans", "options": ["History textbooks", "Bars of soap", "Television remote controls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCampbell's Soup cans.\n\n\tWarhol (1928-1987) owed his fifteen minutes of fame to the Pop Art movement, which sought to blur the boundaries between high art and everyday life. In a diverse assortment of works, Warhol took ordinary objects out of context, elevating their images to high art by painting or printing them in unexpected ways; repetition was a primary tool. His series of Campbell's Soup pictures exemplifies this ideal. Sometimes there were variations in the can's color or packaging or condition, but it was nearly always shown against a plain white background, in isolation.\r \"Campbell's Soup Cans II,\" made in 1969 and displayed at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art, presents ten cans with flavors ranging from \"Old Fashioned Vegetable Soup Made with Beef Broth\" (upper left) to \"Cheddar Cheese Soup\" (bottom right). \n"}]}
