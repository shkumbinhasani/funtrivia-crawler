{"id": "208629", "name": "Just the Facts- Animal Edition Quiz | Animals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", " Miscellaneous Animal Trivia", "Mixed Animal Trivia"], "questions": [{"text": "What do most bears in North America do in the winter?", "correct": "Become torpid", "options": ["Hibernate", "Migrate", "Stay awake all winter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecome torpid.\n\n\tBears do not really hibernate. Their metabolic rate is much higher than a true hibernator, and they can be woken up, unlike a true hibernator. They do become torpid- slow and unlikely to move. \n"}, {"text": "What kind of animal are jackrabbits and snowshoe rabbits?", "correct": "Hares", "options": ["Rabbits", "Weasels", "Rodents"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHares.\n\n\tJackrabbits and snowshoe rabbits are hares. Hares, unlike rabbits, bear young that are fully-furred. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following animals is venomous, compared to the other three which are poisonous?", "correct": "The diamondback rattlesnake", "options": ["The pitohui bird", "The poison arrow frog", "The fugu puffer fish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe diamondback rattlesnake.\n\n\tA very common vocabulary mistake is to confuse \"poisonous\" with \"venomous.\" \"Poisonous\" means \"toxic when ingested,\" \"venomous\" means \"toxic when it bites you.\"\r The pitohui is a strange little New Guinea bird whose feathers are coated with poison. The fugu is a Japanese delicacy that can kill if improperly prepared. Poison arrow frogs secrete toxins through glands in their skin.\r Rattlesnakes are not toxic if ingested- like most strange animals, they are said to taste like chicken! \n"}, {"text": "Polar bears are most likely to use which paw to manipulate objects?", "correct": "Either one- they are ambidextrous", "options": ["The right paw", "The left paw", "Neither- they don't use their paws, they use their noses."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEither one- they are ambidextrous.\n\n\tIt's a common myth that most polar bears are left-pawed, In reality, they are equally likely to use either paw. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following should never be thrown at weddings because it can kill birds who ingest it?", "correct": "None of these are harmful to birds", "options": ["Rice", "Bread crumbs", "Birdseed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these are harmful to birds.\n\n\tRice is a grain like any other grain, and it won't harm birds. In fact, several birds, such as the rice finch, are named for their rice-eating ability! \n"}, {"text": "What happens to lemmings when they overpopulate?", "correct": "They starve or are eaten by predators", "options": ["They throw themselves into the ocean and drown", "They move to Miami", "They never overpopulate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey starve or are eaten by predators.\n\n\tIt's a common misconception that lemmings commit suicide by throwing themselves into the sea. This myth was fostered by the Disney movie \"White Wilderness\", in which the filmmakers, to create a bit of drama, did indeed drive a horde of lemmings into the sea. \n"}, {"text": "What is a pregnant goldfish called?", "correct": "There is no special name- goldfish don't get pregnant", "options": ["A twit", "A twerp", "A twisp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThere is no special name- goldfish don't get pregnant.\n\n\tIt's a common myth that \"a pregnant goldfish is called a twit.\" For a very funny article on this spurious etymology, check out http://www.straightdope.com/columns/020329.html. Goldfish, like most fish, lay eggs that are fertilized outside of the female's body, so they cannot be pregnant, and there is no evidence that \"twit\" was ever used as a term for a fish in a family way. \n"}, {"text": "How many brains did a stegosaurus have?", "correct": "One", "options": ["Two", "None", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tThe rumor, of course, is that the stegosaurus, whose brain was roughly the size of a walnut, had a separate \"brain\" in its hindquarters to run its hind end. However, contemporary research has shown that the space supposedly occupied by the \"brain\" actually housed nerves running into the spinal cord. \n"}, {"text": "What do turkeys do when it rains?", "correct": "Get under shelter if they can", "options": ["Look up at the sky with their beaks open and drown", "Do a rain dance", "Go swimming"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGet under shelter if they can.\n\n\tIt's a common myth that \"turkeys are so stupid that when it rains, they look up at the sky with their beaks open and drown.\" In reality, exposure deaths on turkey farms are not due to the stupidity of the birds, but to lack of shelter. \n"}, {"text": "What do drunken ants do?", "correct": "No one has studied this earthshaking phenomenon", "options": ["Fall on their right sides", "Die", "Fall on their left sides"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo one has studied this earthshaking phenomenon.\n\n\tIt's a common myth that they fall on their right sides. This topic was discussed at some length on the The Ant Farm's and Myrmecology's Message Board. The entomologists who participated in this discussion were uniform in their skepticism of this \"fact\" and several suggested that the average ant is a teetotaler anyway. \n"}]}
