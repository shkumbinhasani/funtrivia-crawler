Though the first portion of the novel deals with the spread and fallout of the disease, the bulk of the book follows the survivors and the subsequent battle of good versus evil that emerges when a mysterious man in black, Randall Flagg, starts to reign in the Western United States. Flagg is none other than the 'Man in Black' from the \"Dark Tower\" series, but we don't know that yet. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these stories appeared in the \"Hearts in Atlantis\" collection in 1999?", "correct": "Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling", "options": ["Riding the Bullet", "The Mist", "The Langoliers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeavenly Shades of Night Are Falling.\n\n\tMore dramatic than a lot of King's earlier works, \"Hearts in Atlantis\" was later adapted into a film starring Anthony Hopkins.

Jacobs eventually became a faith healer, but upon investigation, it appeared that his efforts to heal his patrons resulted in something much more frightening from the other side. \n"}, {"text": "In Derry, Maine, Ed Deepneau suffered from which of the following?", "correct": "Insomnia", "options": ["Phantom limb syndrome", "A stutter", "Alzheimers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsomnia.\n\n\tEd Deepneau appeared in the 1994 novel \"Insomnia\".  As his horrible insomnia worsened to the point where he was only able to get an hour of sleep every night, he started to see figures (who he named after the musketeers) taking the life-force from people in his town.  This book has a strong tie-in to the last novel in \"The Dark Tower\", particularly because the 'bald doctors' in the book act in the stead of the Crimson King. \n"}, {"text": "Who leaves Mid-World though a door to 1980s New York City at the end of \"The Dark Tower\"?", "correct": "Susannah", "options": ["Jake", "Eddie", "Oy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSusannah.\n\n\t\"The Dark Tower\" does contain its fair share of tragic moments, but one of the brighter ends is given to Susannah Dean, the final surviving member of Roland's ka-tet, who departs when she realizes that Roland must end his journey alone.

The book was made into a film directed by John Carpenter and it was one of many novels that highlighted King's passion for old cars (\"From a Buick 8\" would be another).  Also released in 1983-- \"Pet Sematary\" and \"Cycle of the Werewolf\". \n"}]}
