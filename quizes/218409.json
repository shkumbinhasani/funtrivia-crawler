{"id": "218409", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Our Finest Hour' (Part 1) Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 7"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of 'Our Finest Hour', a newsreel is shown, presented by 20th Century Fox.  What was the title of this Fox newsreel?", "correct": "Movietone News", "options": ["U.S. Information Service", "News of the Day", "The March of Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMovietone News.\n\n\tThe 'Movietone News' newsreel features frontline fighting and medical personnel.  Newsreels were sometimes spliced into various 'M*A*S*H' episodes to get the effect of bringing the viewer back in time.  Newsreels were popular in movie theaters before television news programs became prevalent. \n"}, {"text": "The entire episode of 'Our Finest Hour' is presented in black and white.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe newsreels and interviews are presented in black and white, but the footage from past episodes are presented in their original (though sometimes poor quality) color. \n"}, {"text": "During both the first and second parts of 'Our Finest Hour', an interviewer sits down with the various cast members.  What is the name of this gentleman?", "correct": "Clete Roberts", "options": ["Phil Metcalf", "Stan Grady", "Nathan Birnbaum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClete Roberts.\n\n\tThis was not Clete Robert's first appearance on 'M*A*S*H'.  For that, you must go back to the last episode of season four, entitled 'The Interview'.  That also happened to be Larry Gelbart's last episode. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first member of the 4077th outfit to be interviewed during this episode?", "correct": "Hawkeye", "options": ["Radar", "Potter", "BJ"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye.\n\n\tHawkeye, of course!  Roberts' first question to Hawkeye: 'As a practicing surgeon, how do you cope with these unusual circumstances?'  Hawkeye responds, 'Well, usually I just turn my mind off and hope it will all go away.  That doesn't seem to work though so most times you just do your job and try to forget that there's a war going on outside the window.' \n"}, {"text": "A series of interviews with various members of the 4077th outfit occur, with different individuals giving different responses about the war.  According to Klinger, what is the most difficult problem in Korea?", "correct": "Getting used to doing things 'the army way'", "options": ["Avoiding being killed", "Finding a blouse that will match his favorite skirt", "Eating the food in the mess tent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGetting used to doing things 'the army way'.\n\n\t'Back home in Toledo,' Klinger explains, 'when we needed something we just stole it.  Borrowed it!'  Radar has a more innocent take.  In Iowa all you need to do is ask for something if you need it. \n"}, {"text": "Do Trapper, Colonel Blake and Frank Burns appear in the 'flashback' scenes during this season seven episode?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed they both do, several times each.  During the credits at the end of the episode both McLean Stevenson, Wayne Rogers and Larry Linville are among those who are given 'special thanks'. \n"}, {"text": "According to his response about what he misses from back home, which game does Colonel Potter like to play with his wife?", "correct": "Spoons", "options": ["Bridge", "Hide and Seek", "Tic Tac Toe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpoons.\n\n\tIn order to play 'Spoons', according to Potter, 'You cuddle up together like two spoons in a drawer.'  Potter has second thoughts after mentioning this 'game', commenting, 'Wait a minute.  That's a little personal.  Maybe you shouldn't use it.'  He then says, 'Ah, what the hell' and gives consent to use the footage. \n"}, {"text": "In another set of newsreels, several U.S. presidents are shown.  Which of these individuals is not among those who appear in the newsreels during this episode?", "correct": "John F. Kennedy", "options": ["Dwight D. Eisenhower", "Richard M. Nixon", "Harry S Truman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn F. Kennedy\n\n\tTruman is shown talking about U.S. foreign policy.  Nixon, not yet president in his footage, talks about some controversial campaign money.  Eisenhower, also not yet president, is shown announcing in famous fashion his intention to go to Korea.  The Nixon footage seems incongruous with the rest. \n"}, {"text": "Which person describes the people at the 4077th as 'a terribly unruly and undisciplined bunch'?", "correct": "Margaret", "options": ["Potter", "Charles", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret.\n\n\tMargaret goes on to say, 'And I thank God for each and every one of them when those casualties roll in.'  Earlier, Margaret suggests that the thing she misses the most in Korea is 'a sense of order and discipline'. \n"}, {"text": "What is the 'nice' thing that Father Mulcahy comes up with to say about Major Charles Emerson Winchester III?", "correct": "He's a very good doctor", "options": ["He's a humanitarian", "He is very skilled with the English language", "He's got very refined taste"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's a very good doctor.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy is all about charity.  He is considerate enough to make a kind comment about Charles, though he seems somewhat reluctant in the whole affair.  A series of clips featuring Charles are then shown.  Charles is interviewed next, and he particularly takes advantage of the opportunity to deride Hawkeye, calling him immature, self-righteous, arrogant and, finally, insufferable.\r Thanks for trying this quiz.  I hope you enjoyed it. \n"}]}
