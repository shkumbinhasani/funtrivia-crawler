{"id": "343864", "name": "\"Skyward Sword\" - Some Basics Online Quiz | Skyward Sword | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Skyward Sword"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of Link's hometown in this game?", "correct": "Skyloft", "options": ["Ordon Village", "Kokiri Village", "Outset Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkyloft.\n\n\tSkyloft is an island of land floating high above 'the surface'.  A haven in the clouds, this area was suspended in the air by the Goddess, a figure who fought off evils and saved the world from complete annihilation many years ago.  The game begins on the eve of the Wing Ceremony, a celebration which is dedicated in part to the performance of a ritual used to honour the Goddess.  Skyloft is home to a bazaar, Link's friends and enemies, and several townspeople in need of errands to be run.  Some of these people don't appear until you start unlocking some of the city's most interesting secrets. \n"}, {"text": "When does Link receive his green tunic?", "correct": "When he becomes a senior knight-in-training", "options": ["When he turns eighteen", "When he participates in the Goddess' ritual", "When he receives his fairy companion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen he becomes a senior knight-in-training.\n\n\tAlthough Link is just a junior knight-in-training in the outset of the game, the first tasks completed during gameplay revolve around his graduation from junior into senior at the Skyloft Knight Academy which (like the \"Legend of Zelda\" series) is celebrating its twenty-fifth year anniversary.  When Link comes in first during the Wing Ceremony and receives the Bird Statuette he'll receive his promotion and his standard green tunic.  He'll actually receive a Practice Sword before this; he receives it from the Knight Commander in the Sparring Hall next to the academy. \n"}, {"text": "At which of these monuments can you save your progress?", "correct": "Bird statue", "options": ["Goddess statue", "Knight statue", "None of these; you save from the inventory menu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBird statue.\n\n\tTo save the game, Link needs to approach a bird statue; these can be found all throughout the skies and surface, even in multiple spots in the dungeons.  The first of these encountered by Link is right outside the Academy doors in Skyloft but many can be found throughout the sky's floating islands.  If you're on the surface, you can also use these bird statues to return to the sky; if you're in a dungeon, they can take you to the entrance. Reaching these statues throughout the lands is critical because they'll allow you to return to them as checkpoints if you need to leave and return in the future. Bird statues previously appeared in \"Majora's Mask\" (N64) and served similar functions. \n"}, {"text": "From birth, Link and others establish special bonds with which of these mystical creatures?", "correct": "Loftwings", "options": ["Kikwis", "Chuchus", "Mogmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoftwings.\n\n\tA Loftwing is an avian creature which is larger than a human and which is able to fly great distances.  From birth, the citizens of Skyloft are linked to a Loftwing which can be called upon at any time of day.  Link's Loftwing in particular is special because he received a Crimson Loftwing, long thought to be extinct, and he has a very special bond with it.  In the beginning of the game, Link's Loftwing has gone missing and he needs to search for it.  To call upon a Loftwing you need to leap off a precipice and whistle by pressing down on the control pad. Without the Loftwing you'd lever leave Skyloft. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these real-life objects plays an intrinsic role in swordfighting in \"Skyward Sword\"?", "correct": "Wii Motion Plus", "options": ["Wii Vitality Sensor", "Wii Balance Board", "Wii Wheel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWii Motion Plus.\n\n\tMany versions of \"Skyward Sword\", upon the game's release, were sold with a special edition gold Wii Remote containing Wii Motion Plus (though both are sold separately and together as well).  Wii Motion Plus allows for a full range of motion in sword fights; every movement is tracked.  This also plays a major role in puzzle-solving throughout the game.  In fights, each hit must be strategically-placed-- long gone are the days of button-mashing!  In fact, one of the the first major bosses of the game will actually take the sword right out of your hands if you happen to be swinging wildly! \n"}, {"text": "Pressing the C-button will allow you to use your sword for which of these techniques used to locate people or objects?", "correct": "Dowsing", "options": ["Longsight", "Seeking", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDowsing.\n\n\tDowsing comes in handy at several points in the game.  Pressing the C-button allows Link to go into first-person view and to look around using the Wii Remote (though you can still move with the Nunchuck).  Holding the C-button when the dowsing option becomes available, however, allows you to use Fi's powers to locate objects you may require.  Zelda, for example, will always be at the top of the dowsing menu-- the cursor will show when you're pointing in the correct direction of her aura.  Later in the game you can use the dowsing technique to search for Hearts and other characters. \n"}, {"text": "Unlike many earlier \"Legend of Zelda\" games, \"Skyward Sword\" allows you to upgrade your items.  Which of these can not be upgraded?", "correct": "Boots", "options": ["Shields", "Potions", "Pouches"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoots.\n\n\tTo upgrade potions and equippable goods you need to visit the Bazaar in Skyloft.  The husband of the potions stall owner will add items into your potions to give them more potency.  There's also a weapons upgrade system in the Bazaar at which you can upgrade shields, containers, and weapons found throughout the game. Your Seed Satchels, for example, can be upgraded to medium and large sizes while your shields can have added bonuses to increase their durability.  Boots are never traded out in the game and thus have no need to be upgraded at any point.  All of these need special collectible items found throughout the world in order to be created. \n"}, {"text": "During the Wind Ceremony, Zelda will give Link which of these items that she handmade?", "correct": "Sailcloth", "options": ["Ocarina", "Tunic", "Bell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSailcloth.\n\n\tAs is custom during the Wind Ceremony, one girl plays the Goddess while the male who wins the Bird Statuette completes the other half of the ritual.  During this, the statuette is offered up as a sacrifice while the girl hands off a sail.  After receiving this, Link learns how to use it by leaping off the statue and floating to the ground.  While Link is falling, he can deploy the sail as a parachute by pressing the B button.  This comes in handy even on the surface as it will prevent Link from taking any fall damage from high altitude plummets. \n"}, {"text": "What colour is link's stamina gauge?", "correct": "Green", "options": ["Orange", "Red", "Blue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen.\n\n\tThe Stamina Gauge is another new addition to the \"Legend of Zelda\" series; it's a green circle found next to Link during gameplay.  Stamina will be removed from the meter every time Link is in battle, every time he dashes, or every time he does a strenuous activity.  Climbing, for example, will decrease the meter.  If he runs out he'll be winded and unable to fight, run, or climb-- sometimes this may cause a fatality.  Special fruits found in the sky and on the surface can refill stamina in an instant and Green Potions can do the same.  Make sure to keep an eye on this element of gameplay! \n"}, {"text": "Which character will sell Link the Bug Net?", "correct": "Beedle", "options": ["Tingle", "Zelda", "Gorko"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeedle.\n\n\tThe Bug Net is one in an interesting line-up of side-games in \"Skyward Sword\".  You can purchase the Bug Net from Beedle in his airship flying around Skyloft or at night from his island outpost.  When equipped (to the B button), the Bug Net can be used to catch any of the twelve different bug types (and certain other collectibles) on the surface or in the sky.  These bugs can, in turn, be used to create powerful potions at the Bazaar.  Many of the characters in the game have a great interest in bugs.  You can also upgrade the Bug Net into a Big Bug Net at the Bazaar. \n"}]}
