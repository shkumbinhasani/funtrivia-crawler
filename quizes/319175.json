What American river was this ship navigating when it went down?", "correct": "East River", "options": ["Colorado River", "Mississippi River", "Rhine River"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEast River.\n\n\tThe burning and subsequent sinking of the SS General Slocum in New York's East River was that state's greatest disaster until the 911 attacks on the World Trade Center. The Slocum was a side-wheeled paddleboat that was being used for excursion trips around New York City. When the fire started in a storage compartment it quickly became evident that safety precautions had been ignored.Fire hoses were rotted; life jackets were reported to fall apart when touched. All lifeboats were inaccessible and the crew had never even had a fire drill. The captain also refused to run the ship aground which would have saved many, but instead kept sailing into prevailing winds which caused the fire to strengthen.Only 321 people survived. The captain only served 4 years in prison. \n"}, {"text": "In 1982 the ARA General Belgrano, an Argentine Navy cruiser, sank during the Falklands war with a loss of life of over 300 people.

It was also only the second time a submarine of any kind had sank a ship since WWII. 20 minutes after being hit by 2 torpedos, the crew abandoned ship. In bad weather and semi-darkness they had been unable to send out an S.O.S. and so rescue was delayed. Over 700 men were plucked from the icy waters in the following days. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the passenger ship that disappeared with all aboard in 1909 and is referred to as \"Australia's Titanic\"?", "correct": "SS Waratah", "options": ["HMS Windstruck", "HHS  Athena", "SS Carmelo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSS Waratah.\n\n\tIn July of 1909 the SS Waratah disappeared with all aboard while on a trip from Durban to Cape Town.

The ship set off for the next leg of its journey with 211 passengers and crew and was never seen again.There was bad weather in the area and there were some reports of a ship that appeared to have been smoking. These reports were never verified. The ship was searched for diligently at the time and for another 80 years off and on. Sadly, it has never been found.An interesting piece of information I found is that there have been at least 4 other ships with this name that sank within 60 years. Two of these ships sank within a couple months of each other in Sydney Harbor! \n"}, {"text": "One of famed French Romantic painter Theodore Gericaults, most famous works is entitled \"Le Radeau de la Medusea\".

Of the 17 men who stayed with the ship only 3 were still alive 56 days later when the captain went back in an unsuccessful attempt to save the cargo.

When the line broke they were set adrift at sea and lost.
