The population of Rangoon was half Indian by 1930. \n"}, {"text": "The British were able to maintain a relatively stable colonial rule in Burma, allowing a large degree of autonomy through incremental granting of the ingredients of self-rule. By 1937, Burma had its own cabinet and was on the verge of achieving independence. Unfortunately, World War 2 came suddenly upon the Burmese in 1941 via a Japanese invasion.

The circumstances following U Thant's death were notable. He had died in New York in 1974 and his body was returned to Burma for burial. Thousands attended his funeral procession and he was buried at Rangoon University after several days of mourning.It seems that U Thant had become a symbol of sorts for democracy and human rights, something that made the Ne Win regime rather nervous.
