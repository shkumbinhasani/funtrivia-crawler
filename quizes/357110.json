{"id": "357110", "name": "The Maze Runner Multiple Choice Quiz | Authors | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors D-G", " James  Dashner"], "questions": [{"text": "What word is used to describe the newest addition to the population of The Glade?", "correct": "Greenbean", "options": ["Griever", "Shank", "Klunk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreenbean.\n\n\tWaking up with no memory inside a large, pitch black, metal box, Thomas is greeted by a large group of boys as he arrives in the Glade.  Referring to him as a Greenbean, they refuse to tell him anything about his surroundings until the following day but, of course, his curiosity leads him to explore the area.  The boys, led by Alby, attend to other matters and Thomas is asked to meet up with the previous newbie, Chuck, who shows him the ropes.\rThe Glade contains a significant, seemingly-unsafe wooden structure and it is here that Thomas meets Gally, an aggressive boy who thinks he should be running the show.  He tries to stop Thomas from going upstairs to investigate a loud scream, but Thomas goes anyway and finds someone in the midst of 'the Changing'.  This mortifying situation causes him to back out.\rOutside, before the day ends, Thomas discovers that the glade, a perfect square, features four large stone doors, one on each side, which close at night.  Before this happens, 'runners' return from an extensive maze beyond its walls.  That night, as Thomas goes to bed, he somehow begins to think that perhaps he'd been in the Glade before.  He seems to recall being a runner. \n"}, {"text": "When a girl arrives unexpectedly in The Glade, what does she say before falling into her coma?", "correct": "\"Everything is going to change.\"", "options": ["\"This is where it ends.\"", "\"Watch out for him!\"", "\"I know everything.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Everything is going to change.\"\n\n\tWaking Thomas early after his first night, Newt takes him to a hidden window in the wall of the Glade and gives him his first glimpse of a Griever, an inhuman creation patrolling the maze outside.  Following this, Alby gives his own tour of The Glade, showing him each section and talking about the dangers outside.  Their tour, however, is cut short when the box which once contained Thomas makes a return, this time with the first girl ever to enter The Glade.  Although she appears to be dead, the boys bring her out and discover that she is, in fact, alive; she yells \"Everything is going to change\" before passing out.  \rWhen Thomas investigates the area, he feels as though everything is just a bit too familiar and that it's almost as though he'd been there before.  When he follows a small creature known as a Beetle Blade into The Glade's cemetery, he's attacked by the boy who experienced The Changing, Ben, who appears crazed. \n"}, {"text": "When Thomas first meets Minho, the runner has returned from finding which of these in the maze?", "correct": "An allegedly dead Griever", "options": ["A body", "An exit", "Supplies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn allegedly dead Griever.\n\n\tTo protect Thomas at the last moment, Alby arrives and shoots an arrow at Ben, presumably killing him.  It is later determined that the show only wounded him; the Keepers of the Glade figure out what to do and it's ultimately decided that they will banish him into the maze at night-- a death sentence.\rDuring Thomas's first day of work he finds his temporary task, slaughtering animals for food, to be particularly uninteresting.  During a break he sees a runner return to The Glade early.  The runner, named Minho, asks for Alby and says that he saw a dead Griever out by the cliff in the maze.  To verify this, they go into the maze the next day to locate it.  Newt worries when they don't return, but at the last minute Thomas sees them running for the door, unable to make it.  To help them, Thomas makes the decision to go out before the door closes.  They all end up locked out. \n"}, {"text": "What word does Thomas find written on a Beetle Blade?", "correct": "Wicked", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWicked.\n\n\tAfter the doors close, Thomas finds that Alby is unable to move-- after being attacked by the supposedly dead Griever, he was pricked with one of its needles and needs to get the serum to initiate the Changing process.  Minho flees feeling that it would be safer to split up, so Thomas decides to take care of Alby by tying him to the ivy along the maze walls and ascending to where they can be safe; they get about thirty feet up.\rFrom up above, Thomas sees a Beetle Blade watching him with its red eye.  On its back is the word 'Wicked' in red.  As it flits away, Thomas sees his first Griever up close and it is a frightening sight.  When it reaches the floor beneath them it ascends the wall with its mechanical apparatuses and gains on him (leaving Alby alone).\rFleeing through the maze, Thomas comes across three more Grievers before Minho arrives and witnesses him attack one before escaping.  They get a plan to send them over a nearby cliff (and it works) before returning to The Glade by morning.  When they enter through the West Door, they become the first survivors to make it back from the maze at night.\rThat day, Alby gets his serum and the Keepers plan a meeting. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the girl who appears in The Glade?", "correct": "Teresa", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeresa.\n\n\tThe only item on the docket at the Keepers' meeting is Thomas, who some feel should be punished for his actions and others feel should be commended for his bravery and ideas.  Although Gally vows to destroy Thomas, Minho nominates him to become the leader of the maze runners-- this is met with a mixed reaction.  Ultimately, Thomas is voted in as a runner and he would need to spend one day in jail as punishment.  In the meantime, after Gally departs, Newt plans to stick him in jail for his threats.\rShortly after the meeting, Newt and Thomas visit Alby on his request and he admits to having some of his memories back.  He warns Newt to make sure the maps are safe and to beware the girl before they leave.\rWhen Thomas tells Newt that somehow, deep inside, he recognizes The Glade, they decide to visit the girl in the infirmary.  Here, while trying to recall his past, Thomas hears her name, Teresa, in his head.  Then he starts to hear her talking to him.  She says that she was sent as a trigger and that they're the last ones; they can overcome their trials.  Frightened by her telepathy, Thomas flees into the maze. \n"}, {"text": "Before Thomas's arrival, for approximately how long have the runners been making maps?", "correct": "Two years", "options": ["Three weeks", "Four months", "They can't recall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo years.\n\n\tSurprisingly, after running for a few hours, Thomas is able to find his way back to The Glade, almost as if it's second nature.  He falls asleep uninterrupted in the forest near the cemetery.  The next morning he discovers that Gally fled into the maze after the meeting the previous day-- he hasn't been seen since.  He's then taken to the prison for his punishment.  He's let out at the end of the day by Alby who, despite what he said during his Changing, feels that perhaps things outside the maze are worse off than they thought.  He has no reason not to trust Thomas.\rThe following day, Minho starts to train Thomas, showing him around their shed, equipping him, and laying out the maps for him.  Despite their methodical cartography, the eight runners have yet to determine a pattern after two years. \n"}, {"text": "Who becomes the first sacrifice to the Grievers when they enter The Glade?", "correct": "Gally", "options": ["Frypan", "Chuck", "Newt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGally.\n\n\tThomas and Minho head out the West Gate and through the eighth section of the maze to reach section one in the northwest corner.  Running through this area, Thomas learns the basics.  On one wall he finds metal writing reading 'World in Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department'.  Minho thinks little of it; several walls say the same.  After they return and make their map, they head to sleep.  In a dream, Thomas hears Teresa's voice again, this time saying that she triggered the Ending.\rWhen Thomas wakes up, he discovers that for the first time in two years, the sun hasn't risen over The Glade.  Despite the worry this causes, Minho and Thomas still have a job to do.  Setting out on their running for the day, they come across a Griever in the maze and opt to follow it.  When it reaches the cliff, it rolls right over and disappears.  It takes a while, but using rocks they find what seems to be a door through dimensions through which the Grievers must travel; Thomas calls it the Griever Hole.  When they return to tell Alby and Newt, they discover that the box has missed its first weekly shipment in two years-- the situation is direr than ever.  That's when Teresa wakes up.\rThomas hides in the forest but, oddly, Teresa escapes and finds him there.  The two of them realize that they must know each other and she says that 'Wicked is good', whatever it means.  When Alby and Newt find them, Alby demands answers, especially since the doors didn't close for the night.  They place Teresa into the slammer and barricade the doors before piling everyone else into the Homestead.\rMinho, Newt, and Thomas plan to head into the maze to analyze it for several days while Alby opts to study the maps back at the runners' base.  While he heads out to get a head-start, the Grievers come...and so does Gally.  Gally enters the Homestead, maddened, and begins tearing the boards off one of the windows and saying that none of them will want to remember and none of them will escape the maze.  Before he can be stopped, a Griever enters the window; Gally voluntarily jumps into its fleshy body and they make a retreat.  Thomas watches as Minho races behind, following the Grievers back into the maze. \n"}, {"text": "Which is not one of the words spelled out by the maze patterns?", "correct": "TRUST", "options": ["CATCH", "DEATH", "FLOAT"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTRUST.\n\n\tMinho returns to inform Thomas and Newt that the Grievers have gone to their hole but there are worse matters-- someone has burnt all of the map chests in the runner base.  When Thomas tells them that Teresa may have an answer and that the code may be right at their fingertips, they reveal that they hid the maps in their weapon shed just in case.  Taking the maps and some sheets of wax paper, the four of them start copying the patterns and placing them on top of one another until finally, letters begin to appear.  While Newt and Teresa stay back to figure out the code, Minho gathers the other runners and they decide to head into the maze overnight to explore.\rThe search turns up fruitless, especially with the walls not moving.  That night, another Glader is taken.  When Thomas and Minho return they find that the patterns have generated six words: CATCH, FLOAT, BLEED, DEATH, STIFF, and PUSH.  Soon after this, Thomas realizes that to get answers he may need memories, and to get those he needs to get stung by a Griever.  The next night, when the Grievers come, he does it.\rAfter a painful three days, Thomas awakens from his Changing and calls a Gathering for the remaining Keepers.  He tells them that they were all sent here for a test; the maze is not solvable and they're being trained to survive something much bigger.  Only the fittest will survive.  As for the code, he was there when the scientists responsible conceived it. \n"}, {"text": "Does Thomas ever admit that he and the girl can communicate telepathically?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThomas tells the truth-- he and Teresa had designed the maze with the Creators, but against their will.  In addition, they can speak telepathically to one another.  The Keepers trust him regardless and blame the Creators for their dilemma.  Thomas does say, however, that they can use a code to get out in a place they haven't looked; it's in the Griever Hole.  Alby immediately admits to burning the maps himself; he refuses to admit that life outside the Glade can be good considering what he saw during his Changing.  While some agree to Thomas' plan, others don't, even when he says he'd sacrifice himself to get them into the hole.\rThomas is left out of the rest of the Gathering but Newt is able to convince all of the other Keepers to go.  All in all, forty-one Gladers decide to take the trip.  Later that day, with supplies and improvised weapons, they run into the maze. \n"}, {"text": "Who sacrifices themselves to save Thomas?", "correct": "Chuck", "options": ["Minho", "Newt", "Frypan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChuck.\n\n\tWhen the Gladers enter the maze and race to the cliff they find the Grievers waiting for them.  Alby sacrifices himself, fearing what may lay ahead, but it proves useless; they have to fight.  Thomas and Teresa forge through with Chuck in town and jump through the hole, appearing in a large room.  While Teresa uses the computer, Thomas fights off and defeats a Griever on his own.  What they find, however, is that they're unable to punch in the last word, 'PUSH'.  Luckily, Chuck finds a button with the words 'Kill the Maze' written on top.  When this is pushed, the Grievers shut down and the remaining Gladers come in-- only half survived the attack.\rHeading down a nearby slide (which seems endless), the Gladers find themselves face to face with the Creators in an expansive room filled with machines.  As a woman enters to the side, they notice that she's not alone-- Gally is with her.  He takes a dagger and lunges at Thomas but, to everyone's shock, Chuck stands in the way, taking the hit to the chest.  Before most can react, a group of rescuers enter through the door, killing the woman and shooting their way through the building.  They rush the Gladers out and onto a bus in the rain before driving them far away.  Someone tells them that they were trained to save humanity from the Flare, a solar storm which has killed millions already.  How they might do that is still a mystery.  While they sleep in their new lodgings for the night, the Gladers are unaware that a second group has also shown extraordinary results in their own tests. \n"}]}
