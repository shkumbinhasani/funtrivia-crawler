{"id": "354550", "name": "Back to Black Multiple Choice Quiz | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "Something in Common", "Color Songs"], "questions": [{"text": "In 2007, Amy Winehouse had a new album and a new hit. Let's go to the tape:\n\n\"We only said goodbye with words.\nI died a hundred times.\nYou go back to her\nAnd I go ____________.\"\n\nWhich of these phrases finishes the chorus and names both the song and the album?", "correct": "Back to black", "options": ["To my black rhymes", "Blackly mad", "Blackening limes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBack to black.\n\n\tThe 2006 album \"Back to Black,\" Winehouse's second, was critically acclaimed and commercially successful. With songs like \"Rehab\" and \"Tears Dry on Their Own,\" it earned a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Like much of Winehouse's other work, the title song (which she wrote with Mark Ronson) evokes a dramatically dysfunctional romance, lifting the singer to heights of passion before plunging her \"back to black.\" Sadly, Winehouse's life was no less tumultuous, and she died at 27 in 2011. \"Back to Black\" was the final album released in her lifetime. \n"}, {"text": "\"Paint It, Black\" (1966) is one of the Rolling Stones' most memorable songs, with a relentless rhythm and a compelling sitar accompaniment. In the first line of the song, what is it that the singer wants \"painted black\"?", "correct": "A red door", "options": ["A white wedding", "A blue house with a blue little window", "An orange crush"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA red door.\n\n\t\"I see a red door and I want it painted black.\rNo colors anymore, I want them to turn black.\rI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes;\rI have to turn my head until my darkness goes.\"\r \"Paint It, Black\" did quite well for the Stones, rising to the top of both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1966; the album, \"Aftermath,\" did well too.  The somewhat nihilistic lyrics clearly struck a chord. It's been argued that the song describes the first and all-encompassing stage of a deep grief:\r \"Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts\rIt's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black\r...  If I look hard enough into the settin' sun,\rMy love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Blackbird singing in the dead of night,\nTake these broken wings and learn to fly.\nAll your life,\nYou were only ___________.\"\n\nIn the first verse of the Beatles song \"Blackbird,\" what has the blackbird been doing all its life?", "correct": "Waiting for this moment to arise", "options": ["Studying the laws of flight", "Enduring through strife", "Longing for yesterday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWaiting for this moment to arise.\n\n\tA similar waiting game is recounted in the second verse:\r \"Blackbird singing in the dead of night,\rTake these sunken eyes and learn to see.\rAll your life,\rYou were only waiting for this moment to be free.\"\r \"Blackbird,\" written by Paul McCartney (but credited to Lennon/McCartney as with all their compositions during the Beatles era), was released on \"The White Album\" in 1968. The song is a peaceful one; the gentle vocals are accompanied only by guitar, a tapping sound, and birdsong. Nonetheless, in its reference to perseverance and hope despite dreams delayed - and in its description of a blackbird rather than, say, a bluebird - the song is a clear allegory for the civil rights movement of the 1960s. \n"}, {"text": "Country songs are usually pretty good at setting a mood. Try this one, for example:\n\n\"She walks these hills in a long black ______.\nShe visits my grave when the night winds wail.\nNobody knows, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.\"\n\nIn what black thing does this mysterious woman walk?", "correct": "Veil", "options": ["Gown", "Ski", "Kimono"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVeil.\n\n\tThis is \"Long Black Veil,\" written in 1959 by Danny Dill and Marijohn Wilkin and memorably performed by a number of singers; my favorite is a duet between Joni Mitchell and Johnny Cash, but Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and many others have also done it very well. The first few verses tell a spare, hard story.The narrator is falsely accused of murder, but he can't prove his innocence without admitting where he was at the time: committing adultery with his best friend's wife. So he goes to the gallows, and she grieves in secret for the rest of her life. Who is more haunted: the ghostly narrator or his mourning lover? \n"}, {"text": "\"I got a black magic woman,\nGot me so blind I can't see\nThat she's a black magic woman\nShe's tryin' to make a devil out of me.\"\n\n\"Black Magic Woman\" (1970) was one of Santana's greatest hits, but it wasn't always a Santana song. What band released it first, in 1968?", "correct": "Fleetwood Mac", "options": ["Peter, Paul, and Mary", "The Jimi Hendrix Experience", "Simon and Garfunkel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFleetwood Mac.\n\n\tPeter Green, a member of Fleetwood Mac, wrote the song. After releasing it as a single in 1968, the band included it on two 1969 compilation albums: \"English Rose\" (for release in the US) and \"The Pious Bird of Good Omen\" (for release in the UK). But the song didn't really take off until Santana re-arranged it in 1970, mixing it with the music of \"Gypsy Queen\" for their album \"Abraxas.\" The Santana version reached as high as number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and it's that cover (or variations on it) that receives the most radio play by far. \n"}, {"text": "Will Smith wrote and performed the 1997 song \"Men in Black\" to accompany the blockbuster movie of the same name. \"Here come the Men in Black,\" featured singer Coko croons in the chorus. \"They won't let you remember.\" In the song and the movie, the Men in Black protect people from what kind of threat?", "correct": "Extra-terrestrials", "options": ["Global warming", "Nuclear bombs", "Mutants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExtra-terrestrials.\n\n\tIn the chorus, the MIBs are described as \"galaxy defenders\"; in the verses, Smith drops such subtle clues as \"Guard against extra-terrestrial violence\" and \"We're your first, last and only line of defence against the worst scum of the universe.\" Lines like \"They won't let you remember\" refer to a device that the MIBs use to wipe the short-term memory of human witnesses to the presence of aliens on planet Earth; this is one of the film's more charming running gags.\r The music video pulls extensively from the set and costuming of the movie, even using movie footage at times. The tie-in makes sense; after all, Will Smith starred in the film, portraying the secretive government agency's newest man in a \"black suit with the black Ray Bans on.\" \n"}, {"text": "Sitting in the audience, you can feel it: \"The color of the world is changing day by day.\" But what is it changing to? According to this musical, the two choices boil down to \"Red - the blood of angry men! Black - the dark of ages past!\" Name the show in which you'll hear \"Red and Black\" near the end of the first act.", "correct": "Les Mis\u00e9rables", "options": ["The Pirates of Penzance", "Oklahoma!", "Jesus Christ Superstar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLes Mis\u00e9rables.\n\n\tWith music by Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg and lyrics by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel, \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" has been a global phenomenon since its first performance in 1980. (The first English-language performance, with lyrics adapted by Herbert Kretzmer, came in 1985.) Based on Victor Hugo's 1862 novel, the musical tells the story of two generations of people who struggle to define goodness and find redemption in a world that's often casually cruel. \"Red and Black\" belongs to the younger generation's story. An idealistic student, Enjolras, sings to rally his friends toward a revolution - the ill-fated historical uprising of 1832. Then young Marius, who has just fallen in love, joins in and gives the colors a different meaning:\r \"Red ... I feel my soul on fire!\rBlack ... My world if she's not there.\rRed ... The color of desire!\rBlack ... The color of despair!\" \n"}, {"text": "Here's another trick for singers seeking inspiration: sing about another musician! Alannah Myles went this route with \"Black Velvet,\" tracing the life story of a tremendously successful singer from another generation. \"Up in Memphis, the music's like a heat wave / White lightning, bound to drive you wild,\" she explained. What singer \"leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle\" in \"Black Velvet\"?", "correct": "Elvis Presley", "options": ["Michael Jackson", "Buddy Holly", "Chuck Berry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElvis Presley.\n\n\tThe 1989 song starts with Elvis's birth, in \"Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell,\" and then continues through his peak as a popular singer: \"Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl/`Love Me Tender' leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle.\" (\"Love Me Tender,\" from 1956, is still one of Elvis's best-loved songs.) Elvis's sudden death in 1977 is treated too - \"In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon\" - but the bulk of the song is its memorable chorus, a hymn to Elvis's charisma and presence:\r \"Black velvet and that little boy smile!\rBlack velvet with that slow southern style!\rA new religion that'll bring you to your knees:\rBlack velvet, if you please.\"\r \"Black Velvet\" was written by David Tyson and Christopher Ward. After spending a few weeks at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, it earned Myles a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocalist. \n"}, {"text": "\"Young, gifted and black!\nWe must begin to tell our young:\nThere's a world waiting for you.\nThis is a quest that's just begun!\"\n\nInspiring in its message and radical in its focus, this song won Aretha Franklin a Grammy Award in 1973. Aretha wasn't the first to sing it, though. Who released this song in 1970?", "correct": "Nina Simone", "options": ["Thelma Houston", "The Supremes", "Peter, Paul, and Mary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNina Simone.\n\n\tSimone was a tremendously versatile and expressive singer; this song, which she wrote with Weldon Irvine, was one of the many civil-rights standards Simone sang in the 1960s and 1970s. \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\" is a paean to the tremendous potential of a generation of black youngsters:\r \"In the whole world you know\rThere are a billion boys and girls\rWho are young, gifted and black,\rAnd that's a fact!\"\r Shortening the title to \"Young, Gifted and Black,\" Aretha Franklin made the song the centerpiece of her album by the same name in 1972. Her stirring rendition earned her a sixth straight Grammy Award for Best Rhythm and Blues Female Vocal Performance. \n"}, {"text": "\"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black.\" \n\nThis is how the protest song \"Man in Black\" begins; as the song goes on, the singer explains the \"reason for the things that I have on.\" The man who wrote and sang this song was already known as \"The Man in Black\"; who was he?", "correct": "Johnny Cash", "options": ["Willie Nelson", "Merle Haggard", "Hank Williams, Sr."], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Cash.\n\n\tCash, a country-music star, soon acquired a reputation for wearing plain, dark clothing on stage, in contrast to the bright colors and sparkly rhinestones of many of his peers. Purportedly, the tradition began because a young Cash and his bandmates all happened to have black shirts, but this coincidence became a tradition and then a statement. As Cash explains it in \"Man in Black\":\r \"Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,\rIn our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,\rBut just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,\rUp front there oughta be a Man In Black.\"\r Much of the rest of the song is a listing of some \"of the ones who are held back,\" from \"the sick and lonely old\" to \"the prisoner who has long paid for his crime / But is there because he's a victim of the times.\" \"Man in Black\" was released in 1971, as part of an album with the same title. \n"}]}
