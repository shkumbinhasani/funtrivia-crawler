He also won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama four times, in 1920, 1922, 1928, and the final one four years after his death, in 1957.\rHe wrote 'The Iceman Cometh'  in 1939 although it was not performed until 1946. 'Long Day's Journey into Night' was one of his last full-length plays, written in 1941. It was first performed in 1956, and it was for this that he earned his posthumous Pulitzer.\rOf the alternatives, Edward Albee is best remembered for 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'. Neil Simon was responsible for such hits as 'The Sunshine Boys' and 'The Goodbye Girl'. Arthur Miller's most memorable works are 'Death of a Salesman' and 'The Crucible'. \n"}, {"text": "Robbie Burns is Scotland's national poet, and his mausoleum is a popular tourist attraction. Where can it be seen?  \n", "correct": "St Michael's Church, Dumfries", "options": ["Dunfermline Abbey", "Edinburgh Castle", "Auld Kirk, Alloway, Ayrshire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt Michael's Church, Dumfries.\n\n\tBorn in Alloway on January 25 1759, Burns is often referred to as 'The Bard of Ayrshire'. His birthplace and the adjacent museum attract many visitors to the village on the banks of the River Doon. His father, William, is buried in the Auld Kirk here. His birth date is widely celebrated in Scotland as 'Burns Night'.\rIn the late 1780s, Burns moved to Dumfries near to Scotland's southern border with England. It was here that he died aged just 37 on July 21 1796. His funeral was held four days later, on the same day that his son Maxwell was born. A statue to Burns dominates the town centre, and his Mausoleum is located in the churchyard of St Michael's.\rDunfermline Abbey, birthplace of the last British monarch born in Scotland, Charles I, is the burial site for many early Scottish kings.

One literary publication voted 'Waiting for Godot' \"the most significant English language play of the 20th century\", which is strange when you consider that it was originally written in French. Beckett's own translation of the play into English was first performed in 1953. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969. He died in Paris aged 83 in 1989.\rOf the alternatives, the principal characters in Edward Albee's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' are George and Martha. Jerome K Jerome's 'Three Men in a Boat' tells the reader in the opening line that there are, in fact, four main characters: George, Harris and J as well as Montmorency the dog. There are also four principle characters in Edward Lear's 'The Owl and the Pussycat'. They are the piggy-wig and the turkey in addition to the eponymous characters. Suffice it to say, though, that none of them is named Vladimir. \n"}, {"text": "For which British monarch did Handel compose 'Music for the Royal Fireworks'?\n\n", "correct": "George II", "options": ["George I", "George IV", "George III"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge II.\n\n\tGeorg Friedrich Handel was born in Halle, Germany in 1685.

His 1989 novel 'The Dark Half' features author and recovering alcoholic Thad Beaumont. Barton George Dawes is the protagonist in the 1981 novel 'Roadwork', which was first published under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman. \n"}, {"text": "A line from Rudyard Kipling's 'If' confronts players entering the playing area at which sporting arena?", "correct": "Wimbledon", "options": ["Wembley", "Lords", "Old Trafford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWimbledon.\n\n\tThe quote in questions is, perhaps, the most widely-known line from Kipling's classic poem -- \"If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two impostors just the same\". It is carved into the wall at the players' entrance to Centre Court at the home of tennis, Wimbledon.\rThe poem was written in 1895, at the height of Kipling's productive years. He had written his other great contributions to poetry, 'Mandalay' and 'Gunga Din', five years earlier.

In 1845, French dramatist and short-story writer Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e published a novella entitled 'Carmen' based on Pushkin's poem. It was from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's novella that Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy wrote the libretto that would eventually be set to music by Bizet in the form we know today.\rOne of the world's most popular operas for more than a century, 'Carmen' ranks as number four on the list of the most-performed operas in North America. \n"}, {"text": "Which E.M.

It is also his second-longest, after 'Hamlet'. Telling the story of the rise to power and subsequent brief reign of the title character, 'Richard III' is sometimes classed as one of the author's histories and sometimes as one of his tragedies.\rThe actual Battle of Bosworth Field took place in Leicestershire, England on August 22 1485. It effectively marked the end of the 'Wars of the Roses', with Lancashire's Henry Tudor defeating Yorkist King Richard III. Thus ended the 330-year the Plantagenet dynasty on the English throne, and ushered in the Tudor period which would last until 1603. This was the last significant Medieval battle in English history and effectively ended the period now known as 'The Middle Ages'. Richard III still remains the last English monarch to die in battle. \n"}, {"text": "By what name is the Italian artist Giovanni Antonio Canal better known?\n", "correct": "Canaletto", "options": ["Titian", "Caravaggio", "Tintoretto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanaletto.\n\n\tBorn in Venice in 1697, Canaletto lived most of his life in and around his home town apart from a ten-year visit to England in the middle of the 18th Century.
