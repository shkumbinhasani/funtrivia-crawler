{"id": "386672", "name": "Hard UK Motorways, but not the M1 Quiz / Test | British Roads & Motorways | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Roads & Highways", "British Roads & Motorways"], "questions": [{"text": "In the course of its 117-mile orbital trip around London, the M25 intersects with nine other motorways. Which of these does NOT meet the M25?", "correct": "M2", "options": ["M20", "M11", "M23"], "explanation": "\n\n\nM2.\n\n\tThe M25 has junctions with the M1, M3, M4, M11, M20, M23, M26, M40 and A1(M).\r It does not intersect with the M2, which runs 26 miles southeastwards through Kent from the outskirts of the town of Strood near Rochester. The motorway crosses the North Downs, bypassing Chatham, Maidstone and Gillingham, before ending shortly after passing Faversham. Opened in stretches between 1963 and 1965, there is one service area, Medway Services, located between junctions 4 and 5. \n"}, {"text": "One of the world's shortest motorways, the M275 carries traffic from the M27 into which southern city?", "correct": "Portsmouth", "options": ["Bournemouth", "Southampton", "Winchester"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortsmouth.\n\n\tOpened in 1976, the M275 begins at junction 12 of the M27 and runs just two miles southwards into the City of Portsmouth. The famous \"Sails of the South\" landmark stands between the \"In\" and \"Out\" carriageways and motorists entering the city enjoy scenic views of Portsmouth's historic harbour. \r Of the alternatives, the slightly longer (3 miles) M271 runs from the M27 into Southampton's dock area. Motorists travelling along the south coast on the M27 need to join the M3 heading towards London in order to reach Winchester. The M27 ends just a few miles west of Southampton, so those heading for Bournemouth will continue on the A31 across The New Forest. \n"}, {"text": "Another of the shorter UK motorways, the M45 also carries one of the lowest volumes of traffic. At one end it joins the M1 at junction 17, and at the other it exits to the southwest of which town?", "correct": "Rugby", "options": ["Bedford", "Milton Keynes", "Northampton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRugby.\n\n\tLocated just north of the Watford Gap Services, the M45 can be accessed only by traffic travelling northbound on the M1. It runs just eight miles before exiting onto the A45 near the village of Thurlaston to the southwest of Rugby.\r The M45 is one of the oldest UK motorways, dating back to 1959, when the M1 only went as far north as Junction 18. The intention was to funnel some of the London-Birmingham traffic off of the motorway onto an alternative route. The opening of the M6 in 1972 rendered the M45 redundant, hence its relatively low traffic volume compared to other motorways today. \n"}, {"text": "Part of the much longer European 05 route, at its northern end the A74(M) becomes the M74. As what does the road continue to the south?", "correct": "M6", "options": ["M8", "M1", "A1(M)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nM6.\n\n\tThe A74(M) is part of the European E05 route, which covers 1,900 miles from Glasgow, though England (via Birmingham and Southampton) and France (via Paris and Bordeaux) to Madrid in central Spain.\r The A74(M) runs from the Abington Services at the southern end of the M74 south of Glasgow to just south of the Gretna Green Services, where it crosses the border into England and becomes the M6. \n"}, {"text": "Strensham, Michaelwood, Sedgemoor and Cullompton are all services on which major UK motorway?", "correct": "M5", "options": ["M62", "M4", "M40"], "explanation": "\n\n\nM5.\n\n\tThe Cullompton Services are located just north of Exeter on the M5. Travelling further north along the 163-mile motorway, you will pass Sedgemoor Services just south of Bristol, the Michaelwood Services just before reaching Gloucester and the Strensham Services to the south of Worcester. \r With a total of ten service areas along its route (one just over every 16 miles), the M5 has one of the highest concentrations of services on UK motorways. Only the longer M1 (11 in 194 miles) and the M6 (12 in 232 miles) have more services areas. \n"}, {"text": "Climbing to 1,221 feet above sea-level, you will cross the highest point on any UK motorway whilst driving along which road?", "correct": "M62", "options": ["M90", "M8", "M6"], "explanation": "\n\n\nM62.\n\n\tRunning 107 miles from Hull on the east coast to the outskirts of Liverpool, the M62 is the major roadway across the Pennines. Relatively flat on the sections between Liverpool and Manchester, and between Leeds and Hull, the M62 across the Pennines is anything but: construction of this section was very slow, taking from 1963 until 1970. The road reaches its highest point at a cutting through Windy Hill near Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District National Park. \n"}, {"text": "Built in the late 1970s, the M180 links the M18 in Doncaster with Humberside Airport on the western outskirts of which East Coast fishing port?", "correct": "Grimsby", "options": ["Cleethorpes", "South Shields", "Boston"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrimsby.\n\n\tBeginning at Junction 5 of the M18 in Doncaster in South Yorkshire, the M180 runs 25 miles eastwards, via a junction with the M181 into Scunthorpe before finishing on the outskirts of Grimsby. The final junction is close to Humberside Airport, located in the village of Kirmington in North Lincolnshire. Hull is easily accessible from here via the Humber Bridge. \n"}, {"text": "The UK's shortest motorway, and its highest numbered, the M898 is a spur leading to the Erskine Bridge. Adjacent to which airport does it run?", "correct": "Glasgow International Airport", "options": ["Edinburgh Airport", "Newcastle International Airport", "Inverness Airport"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlasgow International Airport.\n\n\tFormerly known as Abbotsinch Airport, Glasgow International is located in Paisley, Renfrewshire, six miles west of Glasgow city centre. Road access from Glasgow or Edinburgh is via Junctions 28 and 29 from the M8.\r The M898 joins the M8 at Junction 30 and runs just a half mile to the multi-span, cable-stayed, box girder Erskine Bridge which crosses the River Clyde, the Forth & Clyde Canal and the North Clyde railway line. The bridge connects Renfrewshire with West Dunbartonshire. \n"}, {"text": "Another of the UK's shortest motorways, the A601(M) is unique in having the only single-lane road with motorway status. It runs in both directions from Junction 35 of the M6 and originally opened as part of the bypass around which town or city? ", "correct": "Lancaster", "options": ["Derby", "Blackpool", "Preston"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLancaster.\n\n\tJust 1.3 miles in length, the A601(M) opened in 1960 as part of the Lancaster Bypass. The short southbound section of the A601(M) is the only single-carriageway motorway in the UK. The northbound section terminates at the junction with the A6 for Kendal, Morecambe and Carnforth. \r The designation of the A601(M) is also unusual, as you might expect it to be the A601 operating as a motorway. The A601, though, is the Derby inner ring road, located off the A6 more than 100 miles further south. \n"}, {"text": "Which UK motorway might you use to get to High Wycombe, Oxford, Banbury or Stratford-upon-Avon?", "correct": "M40", "options": ["M42", "M3", "M4"], "explanation": "\n\n\nM40.\n\n\tConstruction of the M40 began in 1967, but its full 90 miles was not completed until 1991. It now began at Uxbridge in West London, intersects with Junction 15 of the M25 just northwest of Heathrow Airport, and then runs in a generally northwesterly direction until it becomes the M42 on the southeastern outskirts of Birmingham. \n"}]}
