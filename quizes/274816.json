The clerk explains that all of their invitations are in a binder with the most expensive being at the front and the least expensive in the back.  George immediately flips to the back page and chooses the last one. The clerk tries to talk him out of it, claiming that they haven't made that particular invite in a number of years, and the quality of the adhesive is lacking, usually requiring that a lot of moisture be used to seal each envelope.  George continues to support his idea that people won't care about the invitations and that they shouldn't worry about it since people simply read it and send it back. Susan finally gives in and notes the sacrifices she makes for him. \n"}, {"text": "What does Kramer accidentally call Susan?", "correct": "Lily", "options": ["Julie", "Wendy", "Martha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLily.\n\n\tAs George and Susan leave the invitation shop, they run into Kramer on the street and Kramer calls Susan Lily more than once.  Susan and Kramer argue about it a few times, as Susan claims she knows her own name.  Kramer fights back saying that she looks like a Lily.\rGeorge stops by at Jerry's place to complain about how close the wedding date is.  Since they just bought the invitations, nothing can stop the inevitable.  Jerry wonders why George just doesn't break it off with Susan if he's so unhappy about it, but George says that he wouldn't be able to deal with the scene that came afterwards, since it would be the worst scene ever.  He claims he'd rather be unhappy the rest of his life than to go through that.  He also thinks that fleeing to China would be a good idea. \n"}, {"text": "What does Elaine suggest is a good way to break up a relationship?", "correct": "Start smoking", "options": ["Sleep with someone else", "Go into hiding", "Buy a cat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStart smoking.\n\n\tElaine stops by Jerry's apartment as well and tells George that his wedding is less than a month away.  She also asks what her job will be int he wedding since Kramer's an usher and Jerry's the best man.  George replies that she won't have a job.  The two argue about it until Elaine forces George to tell Susan that she'll be an usher too.\rGeorge complains about the wedding a bit more until Elaine suggests that smoking is a good way to break up such a relationship.  George finds the idea intriguing and decides to implement it.\rWhen Jerry walks Elaine home, he talks about the fact that the wedding may be a bad idea since Susan'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester, and they'll never see each other again. \n"}, {"text": "What is Jerry thinking about when he's almost hit by a car?", "correct": "The future with Kramer", "options": ["The past with George", "George's wedding", "His own marriage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe future with Kramer.\n\n\tBefore Elaine leaves, she mentions that she may need to get out of the group too since she can't take the dating scene much longer.  Jerry notes that it would just be himself and Kramer and he begins thinking about the idea (involving Jerry yelling at Kramer about an idea to place a periscope within your car to see traffic).  While he's thinking about the stupid idea, he walks into the road and is nearly hit by a car, but luckily, a woman named Jeannie (who is remarkably similar to Jerry) pulls him to the side of the road, saving his life.\rGeorge asks Susan if Elaine can be an usher, but Susan is firmly against having a woman usher.  She also says that Kramer can't be an usher since he doesn't even know her name.  It is at that point when George begins smoking.  The plan backfires shortly after though. \n"}, {"text": "What do Jerry and Jeannie order during their first date to the coffee shop?", "correct": "Cheerios", "options": ["Coffee", "A big salad", "An egg white omelet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheerios.\n\n\tAfter Jerry's life is saved, he and Jeannie stop by the coffee shop for a bit and they both order a bowl of Cheerios.  Both of them note this and the fact that they have the same initials.  When Jerry gets home, Kramer stops by to tell him that the bank on the corner is giving $100 to any customer that they don't say 'Hello' to.  Jerry nearly ignores this though, since he's thinking about Jeannie.  He claims that he may be in love with the woman because they are so similar, even in the way that they speak.\rSoon after this, he realizes what has happened.  He figures that all these years, he's been looking for himself, and he's finally swept himself off his own feet.  Kramer says the idea is freaking him out. \n"}, {"text": "When Kramer stops by the corner bank, what does the teller greet him with?", "correct": "Hey!", "options": ["Hello!", "How ya doin'?", "What's up?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHey!.\n\n\tKramer instantly asks for his hundred dollars since their new policy states that they will say 'Hello' to every customer or they will give $100 to them.  The teller responds saying that 'Hey' is 'Hello', but Kramer fights back, taking the advertisements quite literally.\rLater, at the apartment, George tells Elaine and Kramer that both of them are not going to be ushers at his wedding.  Jerry also makes Elaine feel bad by saying that he has a date to bring to the wedding (Jeannie).  Elaine says that she doesn't want to sit at the singles table alone.\rWhen George is asked about his smoking experiment, he says that the cigarettes made him sick rather than Susan.  Kramer gives him more food for thought though.  He tells George to give Susan a prenuptial agreement.  Elaine also backs the idea, saying she wouldn't sign one. \n"}, {"text": "Is Susan angered by the idea to fill out a prenuptial agreement?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tGeorge goes to Susan with the idea of a pre-nup and she immediately laughs at him.  She mentions that the idea is useless to him since he makes very little money, and even though she has no job, she gets more than he does.  She says that she'll definitely sign the papers if he gets them.  he backs out of this idea too.  Later, Susan and George get the invitations at the apartment.\rMeanwhile, Jerry and Jeannie spend their day walking through the park, buying cereal, and reading comic books before returning to Jerry's place.  Kramer stops by to tell him about the bank greeting and both Jerry and Jeannie say that 'Hey' is the same as 'Hello'.  Kramer isn't surprised by this and decided to continue to pursue the money. \n"}, {"text": "What does Kramer get from the bank for his 'Hello' problem?", "correct": "$20", "options": ["$10", "$100", "$50"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$20.\n\n\tKramer ends up talking to Jerry about the fact that he doesn't like Jeannie, partially because she's so similar to Jerry in every way.  Jerry decides to go to the pier to think about his future.\rMeanwhile, Susan gets to work on the invitations, spending her entire afternoon licking the cheap adhesives and Kramer stops in at the corner bank to speak with the manager about the greeting he received the day before.  The manager supports the fact that 'Hey' is the same as 'Hello'.  Many other tellers stop by as well and give various other 'Hello-like' greetings to emphasize the fact that it isn't that big a deal.  Regardless, they all talk about the situation and decide that they'll give him something.  He gets $20, which hardly seems worth the trouble, but Kramer is happy with the decision. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Jeannie accept Jerry's marriage proposal?", "correct": "At his gig", "options": ["At the park", "In his apartment", "In the coffee shop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt his gig.\n\n\tJerry ultimately decides that he doesn't care what his friends think because he loves Jeannie (despite their striking similarities) and he asks her to marry him after the show.  She says yes.\rGeorge, meanwhile, is out walking and thinking about his dilemma.  He stops in at the comedy club to see Jerry and he finds him and Jeannie celebrating at the bar with the other customers.  They tell George that they too will be having a wedding (on the first day of Autumn) and they give a toast to their future wives.\rGeorge decides to head home after, and he finds Susan passed out on the sofa in front of all of their invitations.  He greets her, but when he realizes she isn't moving, he calls 911. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of the episode, who is the only group member who is still engaged?", "correct": "Jerry", "options": ["George", "Elaine", "None of them are"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJerry.\n\n\tSoon after Jerry gets engaged with Jeannie, he realizes he may have made a huge mistake, since he hates himself.  He tells this to Kramer in his apartment later that night.  If anything, he should be with his complete opposite.  After this, George calls Jerry to say that Susan is in the hospital.  The three get together and meet him there.\rAt the hospital, the doctor tells George that Susan had just passed away.  They narrow the cause of death down to the inexpensive adhesive on their wedding invitations, which George had somewhat urged her to pick.  After the doctor leaves, Kramer, Jerry, and Elaine express their condolences (Kramer once again calls her Lily).  Jerry is still angered at his idea to get engaged to Jeannie.  The four decide to get some coffee (at George's suggestion).\rIn the end, George tries to get a hold of Marissa Tomei.  She hangs up the phone when he mentions that Susan is dead. \n"}]}
