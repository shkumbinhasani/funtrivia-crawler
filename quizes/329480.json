{"id": "329480", "name": "The Music of \"Glee\" 6 Multiple Choice Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Glee"], "questions": [{"text": "Where does Sue Sylvester sing \"Physical\" in the episode \"Bad Reputation\"?", "correct": "In a music video", "options": ["In the school auditorium", "On stage", "In the school weight room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a music video.\n\n\tAfter the kids find a video of Sue performing this song in her office, they end up posting it on Youtube, making her the laughing stock of the nation.  It turns out that Olivia Newton-John caught wind of the homage and was looking to remake her early video of the single.  The two would perform the song together in a recreation of the original \"Physical\" video.  Newton-John wouldn't reappear until the season finale, \"Sectionals\".\r\"Physical\" was the second song in the show to be performed by Sue (the first being \"Vogue\" in \"The Power of Madonna\").  Appearing in \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 3 - Showstoppers\", the song cracked #89 on the 'Billboard' charts.  The original by Olivia Newton-John hit #1 on the same chart back in 1981.  It was regarded as 'Billboard's #1 Single of the Year' in 1982. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Bad Reputation\", which member of New Directions led the song \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Mercedes", "None of these- it was Will", "Jesse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tOriginally by Bonnie Tyler, the original \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" was a 'Billboard' #1 single in 1983 and perhaps her most popular song.  Coincidentally, the rendition found on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 3 - Showstoppers\" was the show's second-highest-ranking song of the season.  Only second to \"Don't Stop Believin'\" (from the pilot episode ranking at #4), \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" reached a peak of #16 in the US.\rIn the show, Rachel has tarnished her reputation for the worst with a deceptive video creation to the tune of David Geddes' \"Run Joey Run\".  As a result, she sings this song (with Jesse, Finn, and Puck backing her up) and finds herself alone when all she really wanted was to be popular at any cost. \n"}, {"text": "\"Jessie's Girl\" is performed in \"Laryngitis\" as part of the Glee Club's weekly assignment.  Is Finn the first student to perform for this assignment?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe truth is, Rachel was the first and the most adamant about performing her choice for the week: \"The Climb\" by Miley Cyrus.  Unfortunately, her attempt was in vain as she had gotten tonsillitis and her voice had been rough.  She spends the rest of the episode struggling to prevent a tonsillectomy.  As a result, Finn is the first to perform his song of the week, \"Jessie's Girl\" by Rick Springfield.  He chose the song based on how he was feeling about Rachel and Jesse's faulty relationship and his own feelings for Rachel.\r\"Jessie's Girl\" did not appear on any of the show's original soundtracks but became quite popular reaching #23 on the 'Billboard' charts and selling over 100,000 copies online...more than any other single in the episode.  The original by Rick Springfield hit #1 in 1981. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Boy is Mine\" is performed by Santana and which other Glee member in \"Laryngitis\"?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Kurt", "Quinn", "Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tWith Puck dating Mercedes, Santana is less than thrilled that her man is with someone else.  Mercedes receives a call from Santana in the halls and the two have a duet to Brandy and Monica's \"The Boy is Mine\" in the halls and in class.  This follows them into the rehearsal room and the two almost start fighting in their intensity before Will breaks them up.\rThe original song held the #1 spot on the 'Billboard' charts for thirteen weeks in 1998 and also reached #1 in Canada and #2 in the UK and France.  The \"Glee\" version of the song (which is the second song on the show to feature Santana prominently, the first being \"Like a Virgin\" in \"The Power of Madonna\") reached #76 on the 'Billboard' charts despite not appearing on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 3 - Showstoppers\". \n"}, {"text": "In \"Laryngitis\", one character performs the final song from the musical \"Gypsy\".  Who is this character?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Quinn", "Rachel", "Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tFrustrated that his plan to appeal to his father by changing his attitude and appearance (and by dating Brittany) has failed, Kurt breaks into \"Rose's Turn\", the final song from \"Gypsy\" and he finds himself in the school auditorium singing and dancing in front of giant illuminated letters spelling his name.  After the performance, Kurt's father comforts him and they work through their issues.\rThe \"Glee\" version of the song (which did appear on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 3 - Showstoppers\") reached #93 on the 'Billboard' charts and would be Kurt's final solo song of the season. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Laryngitis\", the episode ends with what U2 song?", "correct": "One", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tAs the episode comes to a close, Rachel visits a friend introduced to her by Finn and in return for giving her the confidence in herself, she offers singing lessons.  The two of them decide to sing U2's \"One\" from their \"Achtung Baby\" album.  The entire club ends up performing the song in the auditorium.\rAppearing on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 3 - Showstoppers\", \"One\" hit a peak of #60 on the 'Billboard Hot 100'.  While the original U2 track reached #1 on 'Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks' chart, it only managed #86 on the 'Hot 100' upon its release in 1991. \n"}, {"text": "Bryan Ryan and Will both perform Aerosmith's \"Dream On\" in the episode of the same name to audition for what musical?", "correct": "Les Miserables", "options": ["Rent", "Hairspray", "Chicago"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLes Miserables.\n\n\tIn an attempt to prevent Bryan Ryan from cutting the Glee Club/Show Choir program from the school board, Will urges him to try out for a local production of \"Les Miserables\" with him.  The two of them, as it turns out, are auditioning for the same role and because the director has too little time they end up performing their audition song, \"Dream On\", together.  The director has no real care after their performance though Will is later given the role.\r\"Dream On\" was a successful single for \"Glee\".  Appearing on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 3 - Showstoppers\", the single hit #26 on the 'Billboard' charts and sold over 80,000 copies.  It was the most popular song from the episode and Neil Patrick Harris would win an Emmy for his guest appearance on the show.  The original song by Aerosmith was their first single from their first album.  It was their first top ten as well (in 1973). \n"}, {"text": "Where does Artie perform his song and dance to \"The Safety Dance\" in \"Dream On\"?", "correct": "At the mall", "options": ["In the school", "In front of the mirror", "On TV"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt the mall.\n\n\tWhile in the mall with Tina, Artie has a daydream in which he rises from his wheelchair, pops a disc into a nearby player, and creates a flash mob routine for the Men Without Hats song, \"The Safety Dance\".  As the song progresses and the crowd grows, more and more kids from New Directions can be found amongst the dancers.  Artie soon snaps out of it when Tina returns to his chair.\r\"The Safety Dance\", a classic 1982 new wave tune, hit #1 on the 'Billboard Hot Dance Club Play' chart in its year of release and appeared on the album \"Rhythm of Youth\".

This also reveals that her mother is, in fact, Shelby Corcoran, the head coach for Vocal Adrenaline, and that Jesse is working for the opposition and not for New Directions as presumed.  It isn't until the next episode that Rachel discovers who her mother really is.\rThis performance of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" reached #31 on the 'Billboard' charts and appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 3 - Showstoppers\".  The song also shot Susan Boyle to fame after appearing on \"Britain's Got Talent\" the previous year. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Dream On\", the episode ends with a performance of \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\".

Tina convinces him to sing and she selects Mike Chang as her tap partner instead.  The kids sit in a circle around the stage of the auditorium while Artie sings \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" by the Mamas and the Papas and Mike and Tina do their number with one another.\r\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" originally appeared in the early 1930s though the version by the Mamas and the Papas reached #6 on the 'Billboard' charts in 1968.  The \"Glee\" version neither appeared on the \"Vol. 3\" soundtrack nor did it appear on the charts. \n"}]}
