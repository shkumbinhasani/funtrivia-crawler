{"id": "149170", "name": "The Most Important 'O' People Quiz | Mixed People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", " Mixed People", " People by Surname"], "questions": [{"text": "This early Christian exegete, who lived from 185 to 254 A.D., was the most influential of the early Christian church fathers who came before Augustine.  His works include 'The Hexapla' and 'De Principiis'.  To whom am I referring?  \n", "correct": "Origen", "options": ["Odenathus", "Ovid", "Orestes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrigen.\n\n\tOrigen was born in Alexandria, then a province of imperial Rome.  At a young age he saw his father, Leonides, killed during the persecution of Septimius Severus of 202.  Origen developed a very powerful desire to spread the faith using his mental faculties, and began to write commentaries and exegeses on religious writings. He was extremely prolific in his writings, and there are some claims that he wrote nearly 6,000 different works (probably exaggerated).  Upon Origen's death (also during a persecution), his ideas, which included an attempted marriage of Neo-Platonic philosophy with Christianity, had spread throughout the learned Christian community. \n"}, {"text": "J. Robert Oppenheimer was the head of the Manhattan Project, that topic secret research effort in the United States that led to the creation of the first atomic bomb.  What does the 'J' stand for in his name?  ", "correct": "Julius", "options": ["Jeffrey", "Jacob", "Jeremy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJulius.\n\n\tThrough the efforts of Oppenheimer and the other scientists employed in the Manhattan Project (such as Feynman, Teller and Fermi), the atomic bomb was developed at the latter stages of World War II.  Oppenheimer was against the use of atomic power for violent purposes, and regretted powerfully his contribution to the creation of the bomb in retrospect, encapsulating his feelings in a quote: 'I am become death: the destroyer of worlds'.  Later in his career he worked toward promoting the peaceful use of atomic power, but his connections with the communist party (of which he was once a member) disabled him from making progress in this regard.  Oppenheimer lived from 1904 to 1967. \n"}, {"text": "Rising in the ranks of the Roman army as a mercenary soldier, he finally led a revolt against the last Roman emperor Romulus Augustulus, thus putting an end to the western empire in 476 A.D.  Who was this former German chieftain?  ", "correct": "Odoacer", "options": ["Ortoma", "Ogoden", "Oronsay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOdoacer.\n\n\tThings did not change greatly under Odoacer when he took power over Italy in 476, but the symbolic power of his victory was greatly felt across the Mediterranean.  In fact, Odoacer's triumph prompted the emperor of Byzantium to send Theodoric to Ravenna to face off against the upstart King of Italy.   In 493, Odoacer was defeated by Theodoric, but was invited to share power.  At a banquet, at which Odoacer was the guest of honor, Theodoric murdered his erstwhile partner, taking power for himself in Ravenna. \n"}, {"text": "George Simon Ohm was one of the key early figures in the science of electromagnetics, and also did significant work in the area of acoustics.  From which European country did he hail?  ", "correct": "Germany", "options": ["Sweden", "Denmark", "Poland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGermany.\n\n\tOhm's most significant contribution to physics is his law, appropriately entitled Ohm's Law.   I will not bore you by making you read the entire law, suffice it to say that it describes the nature of electrical conductance and resistance.  His surname (Ohm) has been taken to symbolize electrical resistance, quite a significant honor for a very humble man (his work was not appreciated by the scientific community until he reached a rather old age.) \n"}, {"text": "Two years after the death of Genghis Khan, his second son was elected Great Khan, leader of the Mongols.  Who was this son that carried on his father's goal of conquering the known world?  ", "correct": "Ogedai", "options": ["Oradour", "Omri", "Orkhan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOgedai.\n\n\tUnder Ogedai's reign, which lasted from 1229 to 1241, the Mongols charged into eastern Europe, entered Tibet and China proper, began their siege of the Korean peninsula and invaded the Middle East.  Through the work of Ogedai's Mongol forces, Genghis' empire was indeed extended, nearly doubling within 30 years of the latter's death.  Ogedai's keen leadership abilities, received through the direct training of his father, were largely to thank for this Mongol success. \n"}, {"text": "Another towering figure in the history of electromagnetics was this Dane, who may well be the founder of the science.  What was the name of this chap whose key experiment in 1820 required only a wire and a magnetic needle?  ", "correct": "Oersted", "options": ["Olmsted", "Odets", "Oistrakh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOersted.\n\n\tHans Christian Oersted's most famous experiment was a simple one.  He ran a current through an electric wire, which he then used to deflect a magnetic needle.  His experiment led to similar experiments by Arago, Ampere and Faraday, all of whom acknowledged Oerstead's influence.  It is reasonable to suggest that he is the first to have recognized the connection between electricity and magnetism, thus the title of 'Father of Electromagnetism'. \n"}, {"text": "Though there is some dispute as to the time of its founding, many historians point to 962 as the birth year of the Holy Roman Empire.  Who established this birth through his claim as the defender of Rome?  ", "correct": "Otto I", "options": ["Orlando I", "Owen I", "Orson I"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOtto I.\n\n\tOtto I was the founder of the Holy Roman Empire in 962, but perhaps this was not the first Holy Roman Empire.  Many claim that Charlemagne was the first Holy Roman Empire when he was crowned by Pope Leo III on Christmas, 800 A.D.  Charlemagne's kingdom crumbled following his death, as he split it among his three sons.  At the very least, Otto was forced to reconstitute the empire, and his empire would last for many centuries longer than Charlemagne's! \n"}, {"text": "In 1293 A.D., a Turkish chieftain named Othman (Osman) established the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia.  Which of these is not true about the Ottoman Empire? ", "correct": "The Ottomans were able to capture Vienna in 1529", "options": ["It controlled territory extending from Egypt to Hungary at one time", "It was not ended until the 20th century", "It finally ended the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 1453"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ottomans were able to capture Vienna in 1529.\n\n\tOthman I was the first emperor of one of the longest surviving empires in human history (lasting from 1293 to 1922 A.D.).  The Ottomans enjoyed marvelous success during their first few centuries, controlling Egypt, much of the Middle East and a large section of southeastern Europe.  They ended the Byzantine Empire's reign in Constantinople in 1453, and were only stopped short of conquering much of western Europe in Vienna in 1529. \n"}, {"text": "Octavian, or Gaius Julius Caesar Octavius, is better known to us by what name as the first emperor of Rome?  ", "correct": "Augustus", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAugustus.\n\n\tOctavian was a great-nephew of Julius Caesar, and later became his adopted son.  He was a member of the Second Triumverate, following the death of Caesar, and eventually defeated the murderers of his adoptive father.  Later, he deposed his fellow triumvir Lepidus, and defeated the other triumvir, Marc Antony, at Actium in 31 B.C.  He became the first emperor of Rome, and reigned for over 40 years during the period of 'Pax Romana. \n"}, {"text": "The first practical automobile engine was built in 1876 by a German inventor with which of the following surnames?  ", "correct": "Otto", "options": ["Ochs", "Odo", "Orff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOtto.\n\n\tNikolaus Otto was born in 1832, and lived until 1891.  After being influenced by the inventions and ideas of Etienne Lenoir, who had already built a two-stroke internal combustion engine, he built a four-stroke engine with enough power to propel an entire automobile.  His engine was the prototype for millions and millions that would follow.  It was the motive force of the automobile revolution.
