In his first season in 1955, he went 2-2 while appearing in only 12 games.  Then he went 2-4 and 5-4.  In 1958, he went 11-11.  Koufax was a slow starter, but exploded in 1963 going 25-5.  The next three were just as tremendous, but then it was over.  He retired in 1966 due to elbow problems.  Which team did Sandy spend his career with?", "correct": "Dodgers", "options": ["Twins", "Giants", "Red Sox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDodgers.\n\n\tSandy began with the Brooklyn Dodgers, then made the move with the team to Los Angeles in 1958.  From 1963-1966, Koufax won more games than any other pitcher in history in a four-season span.  He won three Cy Young awards and three Triple Crowns, plus a MVP award.  Koufax was born Sanford Braun in Brooklyn, New York. In the 1966 World Series, Koufax refused to pitch in the opening day game due to his Jewish faith and wouldn't budge.  The Dodgers went with Don Drysdale and lost game one, then Koufax pitched in game two.  The Orioles won the series four games to none, and some think that Koufax's stance on not pitching in game one, set the stage for the series. \n"}, {"text": "I was a New York Yankee for all my 14 seasons in the Major Leagues.  I played most of my games at first base and won nine Gold Gloves for it.  I was also the 1985 American League MVP.  Who am I?", "correct": "Don Mattingly", "options": ["Wade Boggs", "Paul O'Neill", "Bo Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon Mattingly.\n\n\tO'Neill played eight of his 17 seasons as a Cincinnati Red, and Wade played 11 seasons in Boston.  Jackson never played for the Yankees.  Don Mattingly played from 1982-1995.  He was also a six-time all-star.  In 1985, his 23 first place MVP ballots, and George Brett of the Royals' five first place ballots, were the only players to receive them.  Don won the MVP by almost 100 votes. \n"}, {"text": "Al Kaline played for 22 seasons.  He began as a rookie of 18 years old.  10 outfield Gold Gloves, 15 all-star appearances, and twice being a runner-up MVP, he finally retired in 1974.  Which team did Kaline devote his entire MLB career with?", "correct": "Detroit Tigers", "options": ["Boston Red Sox", "Philadelphia Phillies", "Pittsburgh Pirates"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDetroit Tigers.\n\n\tKaline, wearing the familiar number six on his back, went to only one World Series in 1968, the year of pitchers Denny McLain and Mickey Lolich.  Al had two home runs to his credit in the Tigers' win against St. Louis.  His two runner-up MVPs came in 1955, losing to Yankee Yogi Berra, and then in 1963 to Yankee Elston Howard.

Which team did he play for?", "correct": "Cleveland Indians", "options": ["Toronto Blue Jays", "Minnesota Twins", "Milwaukee Braves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCleveland Indians.\n\n\tNone of the other teams existed in 1948.  Six times in Lemon's career he was in the top 10 for MVP voting, and may have won a Cy Young award had it not been awarded until 1956.   In 1948, Lemon was part of a world class pitching staff in the names of Bob Feller, Gene Bearden, and himself.  The three combined for a total of 59 wins in the Indians' 97-58 season record.  Their pitching staff and Larry Doby's .318 batting average, helped them to defeat the Boston Braves four games to two in the World Series. \n"}, {"text": "One segment of one of the greatest pitching rotations belonged to the Baltimore Orioles in 1971, when all their starters won 20+ games in a season.

The only one of the four greats to play their entire career as an Oriole was Palmer.  Jim won the AL Cy Young in 1973, 1975, and 1976, but the most famous was in 1973.
