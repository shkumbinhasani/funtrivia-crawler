{"id": "114052", "name": "The Wonderful Land of 'Os' Quiz | Alphabetical Words | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Alphabetical Words", "Words N - Z"], "questions": [{"text": "Truly, there aren't an incredible number of English language words in the land of 'os'.  One such word, though, is 'ossuary'.  Which of the following would you expect to find in such a place?  \n", "correct": "Bones", "options": ["Students", "Fish", "Trees"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBones.\n\n\tAny time you see a word that begins with the letters 'oss' you can be sure that it relates somehow to bones.  The Latin root prefix for bone is 'oss-', which explains why we have the word 'ossuary', a container or receptacle where bones of dead humans are deposited.  The term is especially useful for archaeologists and anthropologists who study ancient sites.  Similar words include ossify and ossification, both related to the creation of bones.  The Greek root for bone is 'ost-' and is used in words such as osteoblast (bone forming cells) and osteopathy (a type of healing, related to bones). \n"}, {"text": "In the land of 'os' there lives a bird, called a 'L\u00e4mmergeier'.  By what other name does this vulture-like bird of prey go?  \n", "correct": "Ossifrage", "options": ["Osteyer", "Oswalkor", "Oscrund"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOssifrage.\n\n\tThe Ossifrage (Gypaetus barbatus) is a rather large, black bird, sometimes called a bearded vulture.  This big bird is known as the L\u00e4mmergeier in German (the umlaut should have given that way!)  Its 'ossie' name suggests that it might be fond of breaking bones, or at least picking from them (ossifrage = bone-breaking in Latin!) \n"}, {"text": "The land of 'os' is meager indeed, definitely not known for its natural resources!  Yes or no: Are there any chemical elements native to this land?  \n", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tOsmium, atomic number 76, is the only chemical element beginning with 'os'.  It's hard, brittle, metallic stuff which makes it useful in industry.  Osmium has one of the highest melting point and boiling points of any element, and derives its name from the Greek 'osme', meaning 'smell'.  Oh yes...it's malodorous. \n"}, {"text": "'Os' is not only a wondrous land, but also an abbreviation.  It can stand for 'out of stock', 'old seaman', 'old style', 'operating system' and which of these body parts?  \n", "correct": "Left eye", "options": ["Big toe", "Right lung", "Ribs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeft eye.\n\n\tThe Latin term for your left eye is 'oculus sinister', or 'os' for short.  Interestingly enough, the word 'os' itself is an archaic noun meaning mouth or a mouth-like opening, related to the Latin ora or or- (an invasion of the word 'or' in the land of 'os'!) \n"}, {"text": "Not many scientific instruments exist in the land of 'os', but one is extremely popular.  We are talking about the oscilloscope.  Of course, to create the first functional oscilloscopes, which of the following non-'os' items was needed?  \n", "correct": "Cathode ray tube", "options": ["Centrifuge", "Tesla coil", "Leyden jar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCathode ray tube.\n\n\tThe cathode ray tube is employed to produce a graph upon which the voltage and frequency of an electric signal can be measured.  You may not realize it, but most homes used to have CRTs in them, whether they be in 'os' or not...they were used to make television sets, and when you stared at the screen, you were staring at a CRT.  Now most CRTs have been replaced by liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or other digital display mechanisms. \n"}, {"text": "This large creature is a fast running fellow with two huge legs.  Its scientific name is 'Struthio camelus'...but we know it as what?  \n", "correct": "Ostrich", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOstrich.\n\n\tBecause of its very powerful legs, the ostrich is one of the fastest running creatures on Earth, a very useful talent considering that the big fellow cannot fly!  Ostriches are native to Africa. \n"}, {"text": "In the land of 'os', showing off is particularly frowned upon.  In fact, a very specific word has been coined to describe pretentious or excessively showy behavior.  What is that 'ossie' word?", "correct": "Ostentation & Ostentatious & Ostentatiously", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOstentation & Ostentatious & Ostentatiously.\n\n\tTaken from the Latin 'ostentare', meaning 'to display', the word 'ostentation' is probably not the desired description most people would prefer.  A related and more neutral term is 'ostensible' which simply means 'apparent'. \n"}, {"text": "If a person is very fond of you in the land of 'os', they may choose to greet you with a brief 'osculation'.  If you have been osculated, what has happened to you?  \n", "correct": "You have been kissed", "options": ["You have been hugged", "You have had your hand shaken", "You have been noogied"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou have been kissed.\n\n\tThe term 'osculate' comes from the Latin 'osculum', which refers to a kiss, or literally 'little mouth'.  Those 'ossies' are indeed an affectionate bunch. \n"}, {"text": "There is one species of tree that grows particularly thick in the land of 'os'.  This tree is a member of the willow family of the genus Salix.  What is this 'ossie' tree called?  \n", "correct": "Osier", "options": ["Osprey", "Ostrova", "Ostend"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOsier.\n\n\tThe name 'osier' comes from the Latin word for willow 'osera'.  The twigs of this tree are particularly flexible, making them perfect for use in basket-weaving, the main trade of the land of 'os' (aside from staring into oscilloscopes and practicing osteopathy.) \n"}, {"text": "Let's say that someone just doesn't fit-in in the land of 'os'.  The other folks want this person to be excluded from the group, banished if you will.  What would the process of this very special 'os' banishment be called?  \n", "correct": "Ostracize & Ostracism & Ostracized & Ostracizing & Ostracised & Ostracise & Ostracising & Ostracization & Ostracisation", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOstracize & Ostracism & Ostracized & Ostracizing & Ostracised & Ostracise & Ostracising & Ostracization & Ostracisation.\n\n\tThe process of 'ostracism' dates back to ancient Greek times, when voting was done using shards of jars and jugs, called 'ostrakons' (from the word for 'shell'.)  I hope that you have enjoyed this journey through the land of 'os'.  If you have not, please vote using your 'ostrakon'. \n"}]}
