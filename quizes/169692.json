{"id": "169692", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "To begin with, a side question.  The title of this episode contains some Latin, namely the phrase 'quo vadis'.  'Quo vadis' could translate as which of the following?", "correct": "Where are you going?", "options": ["As per usual", "From the beginning", "Lamb of God"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhere are you going?.\n\n\tThis quote is apparently an allusion to the story of Jesus and Peter, who cross paths on the road to Rome.  Peter, who is leaving Rome to escape persecution, passes the reincarnated Jesus, and asks 'quo vadis, Domine' (Where are you going, oh lord?)  Jesus responds that he is returning to be crucified once again.  After Peter hears this, he returns to Rome with Jesus to finally be crucified himself.  In this episode, Captain Chandler imagines himself to be the returned Messiah. \n"}, {"text": "The M*A*S*H 4077th has once again received a fresh shipment of wounded young men.  Among these broken youth is a certain captain who claims himself to be Jesus Christ.  Which member of the 4077th first learns of this claim?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Frank", "Father Mulcahy", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tRadar, with clipboard in hand, walks through a bush of wounded men taking down information.  At the back of the bus he leans over a captain and notices there are no dog tags.  As a responce to Radar's request for his identity, the captain quietly replies 'Jesus Christ', but we don't actually hear him whisper the name.  I suppose the director wanted to leave us in suspense for a bit! \n"}, {"text": "After operating on the captain, Hawkeye and BJ question him about his claim of divinity.  They believe that his claim to be Jesus Christ might likely be a result of the headwound he has received.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn actuality, Captain Chandler's headwound is only superficial, as Hawkeye makes clear.  Hawkeye does initially believe that Chandler might be attempting to get a Section Eight, but after an interview with the doctors and Father Mulcahy, it appears that the problem might be psychological. \n"}, {"text": "Lacking dog tags, it is impossible for our friends to know exactly who this mystery captain who claims to be Christ is.  Who discovers Captain Chandler's true identity?", "correct": "Colonel Flagg", "options": ["Colonel Potter", "Radar", "Sidney Freedman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColonel Flagg.\n\n\tColonel Flagg is summoned by Margaret and Frank, who insist on getting to the bottom of the Captain Chandler controversy.  Flagg is his usual cryptic self, though he does make it clear that 'It's the duty of every American to be on the lookout for goldbricks, pinkos and fellow travelers'.   Flagg then pulls an envelope from under his pants with Chandler's true identity. \n"}, {"text": "After Chandler's dossier is reviewed, the doctors discover that he serves what function in the U.S. military?", "correct": "Bombardier", "options": ["Bombardier ", "Tank commander", "Intelligence agent", "Special operations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBombardier.\n\n\tCaptain Arnold T. Chandler is a bombadier with the 428th bomber squadron.  His plane was shot down four days prior to his injuries.  Chandler was on his 57th bombing mission when his plane was finally downed by enemy fire.  Potter and the other doctors insist that Chandler is suffering from fatigue, while Flagg insists that Chandler is 'chicken'. \n"}, {"text": "With Captain Chandler's sanity in question, the doctors think it prudent to summon Major Sidney Freedman for a psychiatric evaluation.  When Freedman arrives on camp, Colonel Flagg is there to greet him.  According to their conversation, have they met before?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tSitting in Radar's chair, Flagg is the first to greet Freedman.  He says, 'Major Freedman.  Colonel Flagg.  We played poker once.'  Sidney responds, 'Oh sure.  With intelligence, right?'  Flagg is referring to an episode during the second season called 'Deal Me Out' in which Freedman appeared, as did Edward Winter, who portrays Flagg.  However, in that episode, Winter's character was called Captain Halloran, not Flagg.  Halloran and Freedman did play cards together...so perhaps 'Halloran' was just one of Flagg's secret identities! \n"}, {"text": "After Sidney has a fascinating interview with Chandler, the scene shifts to the Swamp, where Hawkeye and BJ have a chat with Frank.  Apparently Frank 'tested' Chandler by saying a prayer which he claims was not answered.  What dessert treat did Frank pray for?", "correct": "Chocolate pudding", "options": ["Angel food cake", "Vanilla ice cream", "Applesauce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate pudding.\n\n\tIn response to Sidney Freedman's question of whether God answers all prayers, Chandler says, 'Yes.  But sometimes the answer is 'no''.  This could explain why Frank didn't get his chocolate pudding! \n"}, {"text": "Sidney's professional advice regarding Chandler is that he be taken out of the service and given professional help.  Colonel Flagg is angered by this diagnosis, and threatens Dr. Freedman.  What 'evidence' does Flagg have that Freedman might not be a loyal American?", "correct": "He never signed his loyalty oath", "options": ["He was a member of the socialist party", "He has a record of not wearing official uniform on duty", "He has given psychiatric evaluations to some Chinese soldiers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe never signed his loyalty oath.\n\n\tFlagg also accuses Freedman of being a member of a number of 'subversive' organizations during their earlier meeting.  These groups 'on the attorney general's list of subversive organizations' include: Young Americans for Lasting Peace, New York Alliance for Young Democrats and Doctor's Progressive Conference.  Freedman adds the Boy Scouts and the Psychiatrist's Bowling League to the list for kicks. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the 4077th personnel requests a special blessing from Captain Chandler?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Father Mulcahy", "Frank", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tIn a very sincere and poignant moment, Radar requests that Captain Chandler bless his teddy bear.  Chandler fulfills this request, and then blesses Radar as well. \n"}, {"text": "By the end of this episode, is Freedman able to elicit an acknowledgement from Chandler of his true identity?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tChandler steps on the bus at the end of the episode still believing he is Christ.  The final scene of the episode provides a chuckle.  Klinger shows up dressed as Moses hoping that Dr. Freedman will allow him to leave the army as well.  Hawkeye informs Klinger that Sidney is in Tokyo, and to get there he only needs to 'part the Sea of Japan'.
