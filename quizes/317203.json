What was its name?", "correct": "2 Become 1", "options": ["2 Little, 2 Late", "2 Much", "2 of Us"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2 Become 1.\n\n\tUnlike the pop-sounding, upbeat songs previously released by the ever-popular girl group (\"Wannabe\" and \"Say You'll Be There\"), \"2 Become 1\" was the girls' first single to be more laid-back and romantic.

The song, since its release, has gone platinum (sometimes double platinum) in certain countries.  Madonna's follow-up single, \"Give It 2 Me\" (also a numbered title...aren't I sneaky?), also achieved popularity but never reached the same amount of airplay (though it reached #1 on two dance-related Billboard charts. \n"}, {"text": "'Five' - In 2005 (look at that, another '5'), which band won the Grammy Award for 'Best New Artist' for their album \"Songs About Jane\"?", "correct": "Maroon 5 & Maroon Five", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaroon 5 & Maroon Five.\n\n\tPicking up a number of Grammy wins and nominations over the course of their first two CDs, Maroon 5 has become a pop group to keep an eye on.  With Adam Levine's uniquely noticeable voice, their singles have been known to get frequent airplay.  Their first CD, \"Songs About Jane\", was on five different Billboard charts (reaching #1 on two of them) and went six times platinum in the United States.

It was quite possibly the most famous song from the album which, in itself, knocked their previous record off the top of the Billboard charts.  Lennon and McCartney wrote the song in their recording studio, opting to experiment with it rather than pre-write the song. This method became prominent in many of the band's future works, especially in their later Abbey Road days.  According to some sources, the band rarely played it live as they thought it wasn't among their greater works. Nonetheless, the song remained popular in the US. \n"}, {"text": "'Nine' - Panic at the Disco released which single off their second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\"?", "correct": "Nine in the Afternoon", "options": ["Nine in the Evening", "Nine in the Morning", "Nine at Night"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine in the Afternoon.\n\n\t\"Nine in the Afternoon\" brought (questionably) rock band Panic (sans the exclamation mark) at the Disco back to the new music scene in 2008.  This single appeared in numerous different TV shows and commercials though their CD didn't need much hype after the success of their sleeper hit \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\" which slowly but surely emerged as a popular debut.  Their second CD, \"Pretty. Odd.\" departed from the band's earlier 'theatrical' release with a more laid back sound.  \"Nine in the Afternoon\" happens to be one of the more upbeat songs on the CD.  It appeared in the master track listing for \"Rock Band 2\".\rThe music video for the single took place in many nonsensical different places with the band wearing costumes a la 'Sgt. Peppers'.

In all fairness I copied and pasted it to save myself the time), \"Ten Speed (Of God's Blood and Burial)\" was the second of only two singles from the band's third album, the first being the well-known \"Welcome Home\".  Like many of Coheed and Cambria's songs, this one followed the complex storyline that made up the album.  All of the songs on each of Coheed's albums are written by the band to ensure a sense of continuity through the tracks.  These, in turn, tie in to the band's series of graphic novels.\rBoth singles for the album appeared on \"Rock Band\". \n"}]}
