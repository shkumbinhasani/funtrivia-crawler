The 'da zhuan' characters tend to be more rounded than the small seal, and as the name implies the small seal script consolidated the size of some of the more complex characters a bit. \n"}, {"text": "This creature can be found in traditional art representing the Chinese emperor.

One of the most fascinating depictions of devas I have seen is in a bas-relief found at Angkor Wat wherein the devas and the asuras (demons) are depicted in a holy tug-of-war with the Vasuki (cosmic serpent) serving as the 'rope'.  All of this is the process of churning the cosmic Sea of Milk, creating the 'butter' that is the universe!  By the way, if the term devas seems strangely similar to the words 'divine', 'deus' (Greek for God) and 'Devil' (a word for Satan, but also the word for God in the Gypsy language), that's no coincidence. All of these words have the same origin in the ancient Indo-European tongue. \n"}, {"text": "The 'Dong Son' is an ancient bronze-age culture of which modern Asian country?  \n", "correct": "Vietnam", "options": ["Thailand", "Korea", "Japan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVietnam.\n\n\tThe Dong Son was a bronze working culture that preceded the arrival of the Chinese (2nd century BC).
