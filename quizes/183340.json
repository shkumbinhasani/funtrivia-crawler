This is a play on the famous 'spaghetti westerns' produced in Italy.  'Tampopo' mixes comedy, eroticism and western movie themes with an insatiable lust for good noodles.  I highly recommend this film to any fan of good Japanese food! \n"}, {"text": "Another gorgeous film that features food as a theme is the wonderful 'Like Water for Chocolate'.  In which country is this romantic drama set?", "correct": "Mexico", "options": ["Philippines", "Morocco", "Spain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMexico.\n\n\tThe 1982 film 'Like Water for Chocolate' is called 'Como Agua Para Chocolate' in its native Spanish.  The film, directed by veteran Mexican actor Alfonso Arau, revolves around love and the magical attributes of fine Mexican cooking.  It's really a kick to watch! \n"}, {"text": "If you love Chinese food, perhaps the movie 'Eat Drink Man Woman' is for you.

In 'Eat Drink Man Woman' the father has spoiled his daughters with wonderful cooking, but feels empty since his wife's death.

This Mar\u00eda Ripoll-directed film is an okay copy of its predecessor, but I would strongly recommend watching the original! \n"}, {"text": "In the charming 1996 film 'Big Night', two brothers attempt to save their dying restaurant with a plan to have a famous jazz musician play there for one special evening.  What sort of restaurant do the brothers run?", "correct": "Italian", "options": ["Korean", "Arabic", "French"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItalian.\n\n\tThe film stars Marc Anthony, Tony Shalhoub, and Stanley Tucci, who also co-directs it along with Campbell Scott.

Interspersed between the comedy are scenes of pizza-making and spaghetti sauce stewing.  The most stunning thing about the film...it was based on a true story about a couple who lived in Allentown, Pennsylvania! \n"}, {"text": "If you enjoy good southern cooking, perhaps the film 'Fried Green Tomatoes' is for you?  Who wrote the novel upon which this 1991 film about relationships (and food) was based?", "correct": "Fannie Flagg", "options": ["Carson McCullers", "Flannery O'Connor", "Harper Lee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFannie Flagg.\n\n\tThe full title of Fannie Flagg's novel is actually 'Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe', but it was shorted for the purposes of fitting the title on movie marquees, posters and the like.  The film features the acting of Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louis Parker, among others.  It also features the secret behind good fried green tomatoes! \n"}, {"text": "In the 1982 film 'Diner', the lives of five twenty-something men revolve around a favorite local eatery.
