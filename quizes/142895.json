{"id": "142895", "name": "10 Famous Blind People Multiple Choice Quiz | Famous People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", " Mixed People", " Famous People"], "questions": [{"text": "Which French Impressionist artist, known as much for his ill-temper as his wonderful paintings and sculptures, spent the final twenty years of his life until his death 1917 as a blind recluse?  ", "correct": "Edgar Degas", "options": ["Pierre-Auguste Renoir", "Camille Pissarro", "Edouard Manet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdgar Degas.\n\n\tDegas is probably best known for his paintings and sculptures of ballet dancers, but his art career goes well beyond this narrow theme.  Degas once claimed that 'no art was ever less spontaneous than mine', he fully embraced his position as an 'Impressionist'.  However, he harbored many a resentment for his fellow artists, and developed a reputation as an anti-Semite and misogynist.  His colleagues admired him, despite his many flaws.  Renoir ranked him above Rodin as the greatest sculptor of the age, and Pissarro wrote once that he was the greatest artist of his era. \n"}, {"text": "Another French Impressionist, Claude Monet, also suffered from failing eyesight during his elderly years.  From what condition did he suffer that debilitated his eyesight?  ", "correct": "Cataracts", "options": ["Conjunctivitis", "Graves' disease", "Retinitis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCataracts.\n\n\tMonet's cataracts made seeing even the largest objects nearly impossible for the great painter, but nonetheless he continued to paint until his death in 1926, at 86 years of age.  He was the last living of the founding members of the French Impressionist movement.   Perhaps his most famous works are his various paintings of water-lilies, created at his water-garden in Giverny.  Along with Degas and Monet, Renoir also suffered from partial blindness from 1912 until his death in 1919. \n"}, {"text": "The ancient Greek classics called 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey' were purported to be first written down by a semi-mythical blind poet of the 8th century B.C.  Who was this blind man with great vision?  ", "correct": "Homer", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHomer.\n\n\tIt is not currently known for certain if Homer even existed, let alone if he was blind.  However, some top experts do believe that, based on writing style and vocabulary, both 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey' were penned by the same hand.  This would lend more credence to the tale of Homer, the blind poet from Chios.  Of course, Homer, or whomever penned the stories, was not the originator of the tales.  They originated as oral folk tales prior to springing forth from the pen of this ancient bard. \n"}, {"text": "Another epic author who suffered from blindness was the English poet, John Milton.  Is it true or false that 'Paradise Lost', his most famous work, was written after he became blind in 1660?  ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMilton became completely blind in 1652, at only 44 years of age.  He was able to complete a number of his greatest works following this disability through the use of dictation.  The whole of that massive poem 'Paradise Lost' was written in this fashion.  Milton also wrote a touching piece called 'On His Blindness', which can be viewed here:  http://www.englishverse.com/poems/on_his_blindness \n"}, {"text": "It's no secret that Helen Keller was blind (as well as deaf), she was became so at just 19 months of age following a bout with illness.   What many may not know about this heroic woman is her political persuasion later in life.  Which political party did she join in 1909?  ", "correct": "Socialist", "options": ["Democrat", "Libertarian", "Republican"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSocialist.\n\n\tHelen Keller was born in 1880 and lived until 1968.  At quite a young age she became acquainted with the writings of the early American socialist.  She became a Socialist in 1909 and penned a fair number of books and articles on the subject.  Many find this rather ironic considering that she was such a self-reliant individual, but her view was that people, especially those with disabilities, should recieve public assistance in order to advance their lives.  This part of the Helen Keller story is often deleted from the history books, despite its importance in her life! \n"}, {"text": "Louis Braille is perhaps the most important blind person to have lived, thanks to his extremely useful and ingenious writing system.

Some of his essays can be found in his 'Ficciones' (1944) and 'El Aleph' (1949).
