{"id": "216851", "name": "Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Quiz | Entertainment | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Comics", "Marvel Comics"], "questions": [{"text": "On page one of issue one (cover dated May 1984), one of the amassed heroes had the distinction of speaking the first line of the series.  Who expressed awe by saying \"Oh...my...stars\"?", "correct": "Captain Marvel II", "options": ["The Beast", "Tigra", "Spider-Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Marvel II.\n\n\tMonica Rambeau, the second person in the Marvel Universe to take the name \"Captain Marvel,\" spoke the line.  (Dr. Hank McCoy, the bombastic Beast, often says \"Oh, my stars and garters!\", but he was not one of the heroes whisked away by the Beyonder, so he wasn't even there...nor was Tigra.) \n"}, {"text": "An infinitely powerful other-dimensional being called The Beyonder took it upon himself to bring numerous heroes and villains to a \"patchwork\" planet on the far side of the galaxy to do battle.  Interestingly, grouped with the heroes upon their initial arrival was one person generally considered to be a villain back on Earth.  Who was it?", "correct": "Magneto", "options": ["The Lizard", "Dr. Doom", "Kang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagneto.\n\n\tBoth Magneto and the heroes were mildly confused as to why Mags had been grouped with the \"white hats\".  It can be argued that Magneto, as a character, is driven not by greed or pettiness, but rather a desire for peace, making him a better \"fit\" with the heroes than the villains.  In any case, Magneto broke off on his own only a few pages later. \n"}, {"text": "Approximately 20 heroes were dragged into the Secret Wars by the Beyonder, meaning that quite a few heroes were left behind back on Earth.  Which of the following people was NOT left behind on Earth, and participated in the Secret Wars?", "correct": "Hawkeye", "options": ["Kitty Pryde of the X-Men", "Doctor Strange", "Daredevil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye.\n\n\tKitty Pryde missed out on the Secret Wars due to being caught up in an adventure with the New Mutants and the Hellions, as shown in \"Uncanny X-Men\" no. 180.  Daredevil and Doctor Strange were left out of the fun, as well.  Hawkeye, though, was right there in the thick of it. \n"}, {"text": "When The Beyonder decided to drag people and resources to his \"Battleworld\" and engage in a \"secret war,\" he didn't limit himself to superhumans:  he also transported an entire Earth suburb, and all of its civilian inhabitants, across the galaxy.  Said suburb was yanked form the outskirts of which American city?", "correct": "Denver, CO", "options": ["Chicago, IL", "Atlanta, GA", "Dallas, TX"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDenver, CO.\n\n\tThe \"six square mile chunk of earth\" (as it's described in issue 12) is never named, but we're told several times that the town is a suburb of Denver. \n"}, {"text": "In issue no. 3, a battle occurred that annoyed X-Men fans everywhere:  the entire team of mutants was beaten by a single person in rather short order.  Who whupped the X-Men?", "correct": "Spider-Man", "options": ["The Hulk", "Iron Man", "Captain America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpider-Man.\n\n\tSpider-Man basically humiliated the X-Men in a brief battle, dodging their every attack, knocking them silly, and making them look like second-raters.  When fan-favorite Wolverine tried to use his claws on Spidey from behind, the wall-crawler literally back-handed Wolvie, saying, \"Dummy!  Nobody sneaks up on me -- !  Those pigstickers may scare the bar room bullies, but to me you're a joke!\"  Ooo.  Burn. \n"}, {"text": "Speaking of the X-Men, one character had the misfortune of losing an arm after a vicious swipe of Wolverine's claws in issue no. 7.  Who was it?", "correct": "Absorbing Man", "options": ["Dr. Doom", "Ultron", "The Lizard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbsorbing Man.\n\n\tCrusher Creel (The Absorbing Man), while his body was exhibiting the properties of some kind of rock, found himself minus most of his right arm after Wolverine came barrelling past him.  Later, though, Creel managed to re-attach his arm, experiencing only nausea as a side effect. \n"}, {"text": "The armored X-Man Colossus, during his stay on \"Battleworld,\" fell deeply in love with an alien woman named Zsaji.  Which of the following statements about Zsaji is NOT true?", "correct": "She loves Captain America, not Colossus.", "options": ["She is a healer.", "She speaks virtually no English.", "She is dead by the end of the mini-series."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe loves Captain America, not Colossus.\n\n\tThe heroes encounter Zsaji, a beautiful woman with amazing healing powers, in one of the alien cities that make up \"Battleworld.\"  The only English word she ever gets close to saying is \"Johnny,\" the first name of the Human Torch, the hero with whom she has fallen in love.  (She has almost no interaction with Captain America.)  \r Poor, heartbroken Colossus: not only does Zsaji choose Johnny Storm over him, but she dies in issue no. 12. \n"}, {"text": "Ten of the mini-series' twelve issues were pencilled by Mike Zeck, who had by then made a name for himself by drawing Captain America and The Punisher.  Who pencilled the two issues that Zeck did not?", "correct": "Bob Layton", "options": ["Mark Gruenwald", "John Romita, Jr.", "Al Milgrom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob Layton.\n\n\tBob Layton, whose artwork is quite familiar to fans of Iron Man, pencilled issues 4 and 5. \n"}, {"text": "A number of characters made their first appearances in the \"Secret Wars\" mini-series.

The second Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter), also from the Denver area, first appeared as a shadow in issue no. 7, and in full view in no. 8.\r Molecule Man first appeared in \"Fantastic Four\" #20, about 20 years before \"Secret Wars\" no. 1 hit the stands. \n"}, {"text": "A number of romances started up during the 12 issues of \"Secret Wars.\"  Which two characters did NOT \"hook up\" on Battleworld?", "correct": "Thor and Enchantress", "options": ["Magneto and Wasp", "Molecule Man and Volcana", "All of these couples began romances"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThor and Enchantress.\n\n\tMolecule Man and Volcana more or less fell in love at first sight.  Wasp and Magneto found themselves cuddling up for a while, although Wasp quickly threw him over the moment she saw an opportunity to escape his \"custody\" and rejoin her fellow heroes.\r Enchantress TRIED like crazy to seduce Thor, but he successfully resisted her advances.  Nothing ever happened between them on Battleworld. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Doom accomplished the impossible and vanquished The Beyonder, stealing his almost infinite power.  The Beyonder, however, was not dead, as Doom believed.  His \"essence\" moved about like a spirit, possessing several characters until he could surprise Doom and reclaim his full power.  \n\nWhich character was the Beyonder \"inhabiting\" when he finally reclaimed his power from Doom?", "correct": "Klaw", "options": ["Kang", "Spider-Woman II", "Hulk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlaw.\n\n\tBoth Spider-Woman and the Hulk were temporarily \"possessed,\" but when The Beyonder made his big move, he was \"hiding\" inside Klaw, Doom's closest confidant. \n"}, {"text": "Several characters came home from the Secret Wars in uniforms that were different from the ones they were accustomed to wearing.

She-Hulk came home wearing a Fantastic Four uniform, as The Thing had asked her to be his replacement on the team.  Spider-Man, of course, picked up the black-and-white \"alien costume\" on Battleworld that would one day become the incredibly lame villain Venom.\r Cyclops came home wearing his usual blue-and gold costume. \n"}, {"text": "After the Secret Wars ended, Spider-Man returned to Earth in Central Park alongside Doctor Octopus.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSpidey actually came home with a tight grip on Dr. Curt Connors, the one-armed scientist who occasionally turns into the villainous Lizard.  \r Dr. Octopus and most of the villains snatched by The Beyonder made their own way home thanks to the Molecule Man, who transformed that hijacked Denver suburb into a spacecraft of sorts and \"drove\" it back to Earth. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the Secret Wars, most of the heroes returned to Earth in Central Park in New York City.  The X-Men, however, did not.  When they found themselves back on Earth, where were they?", "correct": "Japan", "options": ["The Savage Land", "the \"Danger Room\" in their Westchester, NY headquarters", "Hollywood, California"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\tAs seen in \"Uncanny X-Men\" no. 181 (cover date May 1984), the X-Men wind up \"just south of Tokyo, about twenty klicks inland.\" \n"}, {"text": "Believe it or not, at the end of issue no. 11, all of the heroes died.  The Beyonder-powered Dr. Doom, however, resurrected all of them (somewhat against his will) in the very next issue.

Kang was disintegrated by Dr. Doom in issue no. 4, but Doom used his stolen Beyonder power to resurrect him in issue no. 11.\r She-Hulk was beaten severely in issue no. 8, but she never actually died. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Doom was a major player in this mini-series, but there was a slight continuity problem: Doom had been killed in \"Fantastic Four\" no. 260, which was released months before \"Secret Wars\" no. 1 hit the stands.  \n\n\"Secret Wars\" writer Jim Shooter included Doom in the mini-series anyway, leaving it to other writers to explain how he got there.  What wound up being the explanation for Doom's presence on Battleworld, after his ostensible death?", "correct": "The Beyonder had plucked a Dr. Doom from the past.", "options": ["The Dr. Doom on Battleworld was actually one of Doom's androids.", "The Beyonder had plucked a Dr. Doom from the future.", "The Dr. Doom on Battleworld was actually Doom's ward, Kristoff."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Beyonder had plucked a Dr. Doom from the past.\n\n\tIn \"Fantastic Four\" no. 288 (March 1986), writer-artist John Byrne explained that The Beyonder had reached into the past to get his hands on a living version of Dr. Doom. \n"}, {"text": "Many Marvel Comics characters went through major changes in the early 80's, and some of those changes to the status quo were in place during the Secret Wars.  Which of the following changes was NOT in evidence during the Secret Wars?", "correct": "Storm had no access to her weather manipulation powers.", "options": ["Someone other than Tony Stark was wearing the Iron Man armor.", "Professor X could walk.", "The Hulk possessed Bruce Banner's intellect."], "explanation": "\n\n\nStorm had no access to her weather manipulation powers.\n\n\tJim Rhodes was wearing the Iron Man armor; and Charles Xavier, thanks to a cloned, undamaged body (acquired in \"Uncanny X-Men\" no. 167), was out of the wheelchair.  The Hulk was lucid and intelligent, if a tad grouchy:  he was on the verge of losing Banner's intellect, but he was definitely capable of articulate, educated conversation during the Secret Wars.\r Storm wouldn't lose her mutant powers until \"Uncanny X-Men\" no. 185, several months after the X-Men returned from the Secret Wars. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following characters was a married man when the Secret Wars were taking place?", "correct": "Cyclops", "options": ["Spider-Man", "Human Torch", "The Hulk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCyclops.\n\n\tAll four of these men have been married at one point or another, but during the mini-series, only Cyclops was a husband, to Madelyne Pryor...a woman who kinda sorta never existed, really.  (Man, X-Men history is complicated sometimes.)  \r Long after the mini-series, Johnny Storm married Lyja; Peter Parker married Mary Jane Watson; and Bruce Banner married Betty Ross.  (Of all four of these marriages, by the way, only Parker's is still intact as of January 2006.) \n"}, {"text": "Exactly one character willingly stayed behind on Battleworld at the end of the Secret Wars.  Who was it?\n", "correct": "thing & the thing & ben grimm & grimm & benjamin grimm & benjamin j grimm", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nthing & the thing & ben grimm & grimm & benjamin grimm & benjamin j grimm.\n\n\tBenjamin J. Grimm, the ever-lovin' blue-eyed Thing, stayed on Battleworld, as he wanted to explore the possibilities of a planet on which he could revert back to his human form at will.  He asked She-Hulk to take his place in the Fantastic Four, and she served admirably in his stead. \n"}, {"text": "And finally, a bonus question of sorts.  In \"What If...?\" (Vol. 2) no. 114 (November 1998), writer Jay Faerber offered up a story in which the heroes and villains never made it back to Earth at the end of the Secret Wars.  Twenty-five years later, Battleworld looked rather different, especially since a number of surprising couples had gotten married and produced children.\n\nWhich of the following couples did NOT, in Faerber's \"What If...?\" story, wind up siring at least one child in the theoretical Battleworld of the future?", "correct": "Spider-Man and Spider-Woman II", "options": ["Wolverine and Storm", "Captain America and Rogue", "Wasp and the Human Torch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpider-Man and Spider-Woman II.\n\n\tIn this possible future, Cap and Rogue have a daughter named Sarah, who takes the super-heroic name \"Crusader.\"  Wolvie and Storm have a daughter, Kendall, who takes the name \"Torrent\".  Wasp and the Torch (a pretty odd pairing, and not just because of their age difference!) have a son named Matthew, a.k.a. \"Firefly\".\r Spider-Man, in Faerber's story, has been almost completely taken over by the alien costume, and may not in fact be human any more...and at any rate, Spider-Woman II has a gravestone dedicated to her in the heroes' cemetery, so no kids for the spider folk.\r And that's the quiz.  If anyone's interested, I can whip up a quiz on the even-cheesier \"Secret Wars II\", as well.  Throw me some feedback either way! \n"}]}
