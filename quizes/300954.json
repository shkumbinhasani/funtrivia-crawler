During the reign of which monarch did this occur?", "correct": "Henry VII", "options": ["Edward IV", "Richard II", "Henry VIII"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry VII.\n\n\tPerkin Warbeck first laid claims to the English throne in Burgundy in 1490, contending that he was Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, the youngest son of King Edward IV. Although Richard's death has never been conclusively proven, it is widely believed that he perished in 1483. In all probability, Warbeck was the son of minor French official, born in the small Belgian town of Tournai, near Brussels in 1474.\rWarbeck 'invaded' England in 1497, landing in Cornwall, where he attempted to stir up support from locals already resentful of the taxes imposed by Henry VII to pay for the war against Scotland. \rWarbeck was captured at Beaulieu Abbey in Hampshire and imprisoned in the Tower of London. In 1499, he escaped but he was recaptured on November 23, taken to the notorious Tyburn (near current-day Marble Arch) and hanged.

The capital of the territory is West Island.\rFirst annexed by the British Empire in 1857, control of the island group passed from Great Britain to Australia on November 23, 1955 and they remain an Australian territory to this day. \rCuriously, Cocos (Keeling) Islands are virtually antipodean to the other island with a similar name in the Pacific, Cocos Island, which is part of Costa Rica. \n"}, {"text": "The 14th US President, Democrat Franklin Pierce, remains so far the only President to date born in which state?", "correct": "New Hampshire", "options": ["Pennsylvania", "New Jersey", "Connecticut"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Hampshire.\n\n\tBorn in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, on November 23, 1804, Pierce was President from 1853-1857.

Fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt lowered the mark to 9.72 in May 2008 and then smashed his own record, setting a new Olympic record in the process in Beijing later in the year with a remarkable 9.69. \rBy the end of the 2008 Olympics, Powell had run a sub-10 second 100m 48 times, fast closing on Maurice Green's record of 51.
