{"id": "80436", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Ringbanger' Online Trivia | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "This episode of M*A*S*H begins in the operating room, with Trapper and Hawkeye operating on a well-known colonel in the U.S. army.  What is this colonel's name?", "correct": "Buzz Brighton", "options": ["Chip Calhoun", "Lance Thurston", "Chaz Marshall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuzz Brighton.\n\n\tColonel Buzz Brighton, played by Leslie Nielson of 'The Naked Gun' and 'Airplane' fame, is a swaggering, manly tough guy colonel who has been featured in 'Stars and Stripes' enough times to make Hot Lips drool.  In fact, her gawking at the colonel elicits the following line from Hawkeye, \"Careful major, somebody's liable to trip over your tongue!\" \n"}, {"text": "Where on his body had the colonel taken a slug?", "correct": "Buttocks", "options": ["Shoulder", "Abdomen", "Arm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nButtocks.\n\n\tAccording to the colonel, this wasn't the first slug he had taken...scary! \n"}, {"text": "While chatting with the colonel following surgery, Hawkeye and Trapper discover that he is quite callous towards his men, and that he means to improve his military career at their expense.  Hawkeye calls him a real 'ringbanger'.  How does he derive this moniker for the colonel?", "correct": "The colonel taps his ring on the end of a chair", "options": ["The colonel describes his exceptional boxing career", "The colonel discusses his love for the 'ring' of cannon fire on the battlefield", "The colonel claims that when he punches, he uses his ring finger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe colonel taps his ring on the end of a chair.\n\n\tHawkeye never exactly defines what a ringbanger is, but fortunately I have acquired the true definition.  The term refers to an academy trained officer, as in West Point, where the colonel claims to have attended school.  The term can also be applied to graduates of the Naval and Air Force academies as well. \n"}, {"text": "Trapper and Hawkeye enlist Radar to do a little research on the colonel, in an effort to find a way of removing him from command.  Radar discovers that he has perfect medical records but has racked up twice as many casualties as the next highest commander.  They decide that the best way to deal with him is to create 'battle fatigue' by playing with his psyche.  Which of these ploys do they try first with the colonel?", "correct": "Telling him that Henry is a 'boozer'", "options": ["Telling him that Margaret is after him", "Showing him phony medical files", "Switching tents on him"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelling him that Henry is a 'boozer'.\n\n\tNot only do they describe Henry as a 'boozer' but also imply that Frank is a homosexual...probably taboo in today's television world. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following items does the colonel see on the floor of the swamp when he comes to visit Frank for a 'second opinion'?", "correct": "High heel shoes", "options": ["Panty hose", "Strap-on bra", "Women's pajamas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHigh heel shoes.\n\n\tThis is all part of the game to make Frank appear as if he is gay, and thus a potential threat to the macho colonel.  After seeing the high heel shoes, Frank tries to 'feel' the colonel's leg, but Brighton has none of that.  Radar then walks in with some women's underclothes and hands them to Frank...the last straw for the colonel! \n"}, {"text": "One of my two favorite lines from this episode, 'Well you can't just come in here dripping and sniffing!' is uttered by whom?", "correct": "Hot Lips", "options": ["The colonel", "Frank", "Henry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHot Lips.\n\n\tFrank, distraught over the fact that Margaret may be attracted to the colonel, runs right over to Margaret's tent in order to discover the truth.  Margaret becomes angry at Frank, still dripping from his shower, after he sniffs her wonderfully smelling perfume...and shouts this line.  My other favorite quote comes while Hawkeye and Frank are in the shower.  Frank angrily soaps his face while chastising Hawkeye, who says, \"Easy Frank...you're getting yourself into a lather!\"  Clever stuff! \n"}, {"text": "What item suddenly appears in the colonel's tent twice during this episode?", "correct": "A glass of milk", "options": ["Hot Lip's bra", "Henry's gun", "A ham sandwich"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA glass of milk.\n\n\tThe first time he sees his milk, Brighton is confused, but the second time he sees the milk he is delighted.  He uses the milk as an excuse to avoid the advances of Hot Lips, who he believes is seeing Henry Blake.  Confusing, isn't it? \n"}, {"text": "Which character is dead drunk during the climactic moments of 'The Ringbanger' episode?", "correct": "Henry", "options": ["The colonel", "Trapper", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry.\n\n\tHawkeye gets Henry drunk so that he will fit his 'boozer' persona.  Henry 'confronts' the colonel wielding his gun.  Margaret angrily accuses Henry of being drunk.  Henry's response, 'Oh that's a dirty lie, and I intend to press charges...the minute I'm sober!' \n"}, {"text": "What is the ultimate fate of the colonel by the end of 'The Ringbanger' episode?", "correct": "He is sent back to the States to 'cool down'", "options": ["He is sent to Tokyo for psychiatric observation", "Henry sends him back to his command", "He gets into a jeep wreck and must stay at the 4077th for several more weeks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is sent back to the States to 'cool down'.\n\n\tHawkeye and Trapper are able to get the colonel off the front lines, and they didn't even have to remove his appendix! \n"}, {"text": "In the final sequence of 'The Ringbanger' what final trick do Hawkeye and Trapper play on Margaret and Frank?", "correct": "Hawkeye appears under the sheet on the operating table", "options": ["They lock Margaret and Frank up in an embrace using handcuffs", "They slip a PA microphone into Frank and Margaret's conversation", "Trapper chases Margaret around while Hawkeye tries to 'kiss' Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye appears under the sheet on the operating table.\n\n\tOf course all of those other things happened in different episodes, sometimes they got pretty desperate for laughs on M*A*S*H in those final sequences! \n"}]}
