{"id": "398895", "name": "\"Camp Redwood\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: 1984"], "questions": [{"text": "The killer responsible for the massacre in 1970 took which of these as trophies off of his victims?", "correct": "Ears", "options": ["Fingers", "Eyes", "Toes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEars.\n\n\tIn the year 1970, three camp counsellors sharing a bed in their cabin didn't even notice when someone entered through their front door.  While one of them heard the jingling as the mystery person made their entrance, none of them paid enough attention until the murderer reached their bed.  Two of the counsellors were stabbed through their heads while they made out while a third, trying to escape, was knifed in the eye and dragged out of the cabin. The killer kept an ear from each of them, adding them to a chain and leaving them piled in the cabin with the rest of their massacred campers.  That was fourteen years ago. \n"}, {"text": "Brooke meets Montana at which of these events?", "correct": "A dance aerobics class", "options": ["A TV commercial audition", "A \"Flashdance\" screening", "A new record store opening"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA dance aerobics class.\n\n\tAt a dance aerobics class headed by Xavier in Los Angeles, Montana introduces herself to Brooke in the showers and tries to make friends.  Over some refreshing fresh produce at the juice bar, some of the other regulars bring them into the conversation-- there was recently a brutal murder in the city and Xavier's cousin, a member of the LAPD, was giving him all the juicy details. The killer at large?  They've been calling him 'The Night Stalker'.  To get away from the obvious inevitable rampage, Xavier claims he's heading up to a camp they're reopening a few hours outside of town to work as a counsellor for the summer months. He encourages the others to join and they all agree-- they want to dodge the Olympics rush as well.  Montana tries to convince Brooke to join, but she's in college and doesn't want to miss classes. \n"}, {"text": "Brooke is assaulted by The Night Stalker who enters her apartment looking for which of these?", "correct": "Her jewelry", "options": ["Her cash", "Her body", "Her children"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer jewelry.\n\n\tBrooke returns home after her aerobics class and gets ready for bed, putting away her jewelry and falling asleep.  She only awakens when someone breaks into her apartment and asks for her valuables, stealing a diamond ring from her jewelry box and threatening to kill her in the name of Satan to make her yet another victim of the Night Stalker.  She fights back, smashing him in the face with a frying pan, and he flees into the night, vowing that he will find her.\rIt's because of this incident that she decides to join Montana and the aerobics guys; she hitches a ride out into the wilderness for a couple of weeks still unsure of how she could have survived the encounter. \n"}, {"text": "Passing through a gas station en route to Camp Redwood, the counsellors are warned that they will die while they're at the camp.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tTaking turns sipping from a flask and passing blow around in the back seats, the soon-to-be-counsellors stop in at a gas station on their way to the camp, arriving to fill the van up.  Xavier uses a payphone to call his answering machine, finding a message there from a threatening individual on the other side.  Montana urges him to hang up so that they can head along to Camp Redwood and that catches the gas station attendant's attention.  Camp Redwood, after all, is unsafe and they never should've opened it back up.  The counsellors are warned that they're all going to die out there, but they don't take the warning.\rAnd as they drive onward to Camp Redwood, Xavier is too distracted while he's driving; he hits someone while his eyes are off the road.  The man they hit, covered in old cuts and bruises, doesn't remember a thing and passes out.  Xavier demands they all get their stories straight-- they never hit the guy. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first person to join the staff of the newly-reopened Camp Redwood?", "correct": "Bertie", "options": ["Rita", "Trevor", "Xavier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBertie.\n\n\tThe counsellors arrive at Camp Redwood in short time, meeting the new owner, Margaret Booth and discovering that they are essentially the majority of the staff for the summer (due to the Olympics creating numerous temporary jobs).  The man from the road is rushed to the infirmary to be looked at by Nurse Rita; she insists that she works at Hawthorn Hospital's ER during the rest of the year and he'll make a recovery under her care.\rIn the meantime, the counsellors are given a tour of the camp and told the rules.  The lake, Margaret informs them, is allegedly bottomless, and drowning is the number one cause of death for campers in the United States.\rMargaret also introduces the counsellors to Bertie, their chef, who worked at the camp when Margaret was just a counsellor herself.\rThe tour ends with a trip through the girls' cabin and the boys' cabin where Margaret, a staunch advocate of purity, insists upon celibacy as one of her few rules for the summer. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Jingles is so-named because he carries which of these with him?", "correct": "Keys", "options": ["Bells", "Pipes", "Mice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeys.\n\n\tOn their first night around the campfire, while they aren't aware that they're being watched by someone from the treeline, the counsellors sit around as Rita tells them the story of what happened at Camp Redwood back in 1970.  Anybody who knows about Camp Redwood, she claims, didn't want to come back because Camp Redwood was the site of the worst summer camp massacre of all-time.  Benjamin Richter, known as Mr. Jingles, was drafted in the Vietnam War and there he learned how much he liked to kill people.  As trophies, he used to take ears and string them onto a necklace.  Upon returning to the United States, he worked as the groundkeeper at Camp Redwood, killing ten people when he snapped.\r...except that's wrong.  And when Margaret emerges from the trees she reveals that only nine died; she was the only survivor, and she reveals that she's missing an ear to prove it. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret was present at Camp Redwood during the massacre in 1970.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMargaret sets the story straight, if only because she believes her new staffers should know the history to help her get the camp back on its feet.  That night in 1970, she was asleep when she heard the sound of his keys jingling and woke up, but it was too late to stop him from attempting to kill her.  Somehow, she survived, and she believed that Jesus protected her. Mr. Jingles was arrested and put on trial; Margaret was the star witness.  Jingles was found guilty.  Margaret reopened the camp because she wanted to free herself from Mr. Jingles and the burden he placed on her mind and she intends to make Camp Redwood a happy place again. She tells her counsellors that they will not discuss it any further as the kids will arrive the next day. \n"}, {"text": "Montana instantly recognizes Trevor from which of these?", "correct": "Jane Fonda's Workout Video", "options": ["The background of a scene in \"The Outsiders\"", "The opening of \"Three's Company\"", "Her local sushi bar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJane Fonda's Workout Video.\n\n\tIn the infirmary, the man Xavier hit with his car awakens, finally, and removes his headband to find that his ear has been removed.  Brooke heads to the infirmary to find him awake, hiding in the shadows with a scalpel in-hand.  He warns Brooke that she shouldn't be there as she puts him to bed and he reveals that the phone lines are out.  When she lets him know that they're at Camp Redwood, he warns her to leave immediately.\rInstead, Brooke returns to the other counsellors to tell them about his wigging out.  The talk is derailed quickly when Trevor, the activities manager of the camp (and the counsellors' direct supervisor), arrives with beer.  Montana recognizes him immediately-- he was in the original version of Jane Fonda's Workout Video.  It turned out that he was drawing too much focus off Jane.\rTrevor heads outside later on to find Montana swimming out in the lake and he strips down to join her in the water.  While Trevor heads under, Montana notices as a car's headlights shine out over the lake. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Jingles escapes his asylum cell by faking his death by which means?", "correct": "Hanging", "options": ["Stabbing", "Electrocution", "Heart attack"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHanging.\n\n\tA storm forms over the camp and the nearby area, and out at the local insane asylum, Dr. Hopple arrives to discover that a prisoner has escaped and flipped the master switch-- it was Mr. Jingles, and he's still on the loose.  Three hours earlier, Benjamin Richter fooled one of the asylum orderlies, appearing to have hanged himself in order to get his cell door open.  He took the keys and jingled them on his way out, unlocking every door on his way.  Dr. Hopple, searching Mr. Jingles' cell, realizes that he was aware that Camp Redwood was reopening.\rOut at the gas station near Camp Redwood, the owner, Roy hears the sound of jingling keys while he's working underneath a vehicle.  Jingles simply lowers the jack holding the car up, crushing Roy and taking his keys so he can drive out to Redwood. \n"}, {"text": "The counsellors set up a TV to watch which of the following Olympic events?", "correct": "The opening ceremonies", "options": ["The 100m hurdles", "Synchronized diving", "The closing ceremonies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe opening ceremonies.\n\n\tThe counsellors set up their TV to watch the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in one of the cabins.  During this time, Ray's hand is accidentally cut and he heads to a sink to wash off the wound.  Brooke joins him to check up and heads to the infirmary herself for bandages, but when she arrives she finds the man they hit no longer in his bed.  Instead, she finds him dead, impaled on the hooks of the infirmary door, and Mr. Jingles standing behind the window outside.  She runs away with Jingles in pursuit, sliding through the rain to the cabin with the others and arriving to lock the door behind her. Trevor, Ray, and Xavier grab weapons and look outside, but they see no one there.  She warns them about the dead hiker in the infirmary and they all head over to look, but the place is empty.  The others make fun of Brooke for being so mistaken and she is forced to admit that she must've been wrong.\rThat night, in bed, Brooke hears the payphone ringing outside even though the hiker told her the phone lines were down.  She goes out alone to check it.\rFrom afar, the jingling of keys can be heard.\rNot so far away, the Night Stalker emerges from the woods. \n"}]}
