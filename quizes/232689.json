{"id": "232689", "name": "So You Know Your \"Pok\u00e9mon\" Status Effects... Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Pokemon Games", " Pokemon Red/ Blue/Yellow"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these is not a move that will make a Pok\u00e9mon sleep?", "correct": "Counter", "options": ["Lovely Kiss", "Hypnosis", "Sing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCounter.\n\n\tCounter is an attack that when used, it will double the damage given by your opponent and use it against it.  Sleep-effect moves can be quite beneficial because it give you a chance to attack an opponent without taking any physical damage yourself.  Hypnosis, a psychic-type move, is commonly used by Drowzee, while Sing is often used by Jigglypuff.  Lovely Kiss is one of Jynx' exclusive moves.  Counter (aka TM18) can be found in Celadon City's Department Store. \n"}, {"text": "How much does an Antidote cost at a Pok\u00e9mart?", "correct": "$100", "options": ["$500", "$200", "$250"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$100.\n\n\tAntidotes are probably the cheapest items in the Pok\u00e9mart, and they're probably the most used out of all of the status-effect cures.  When your Pok\u00e9mon is poisoned, it's damaged every turn in battle, and every few steps outside of battle, so a Pok\u00e9mon can faint anywhere.  You can use Antidotes or Full Heals to relieve your Pok\u00e9mon of this horrible fate or you can head to the nearest Pok\u00e9center.  Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon and (surprise, surprise) poison-type Pok\u00e9mon often have poisonous attacks. \n"}, {"text": "After which move are you possibly going to use a Burn Heal?", "correct": "Ember", "options": ["Water Gun", "Blizzard", "Confusion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmber.\n\n\tBurns, like poison effects, will gradually eat away at a Pok\u00e9mon's HP until it runs out and faints.  This status effect is only created through fire-type attacks, so it might be best to have one of these on hand (or a Full Heal).  Another item, Ice Heal, is used to treat freezing.  When a Pok\u00e9mon is frozen, it can't attack at all.  Both Ice Heal and Burn Heal cost $250 while a Full Heal costs $600. \n"}, {"text": "Which gym leader is likely to use poison-type attacks the most?", "correct": "Koga", "options": ["Giovanni", "Sabrina", "Blaine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKoga.\n\n\tKoga specializes in poison-type Pok\u00e9mon in his gym in Fuchsia City, so you'd better bring some Antidotes.  Pok\u00e9mon you're likely to see here include Venonat, Venomoth, Muk, Grimer, Koffing and Weezing- all of which use moves like Sludge, Smog, Poisonpowder, and more.  If you plan to use psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon in this gym, you will fare extremely well. \n"}, {"text": "If your Pok\u00e9mon is confused, it can still attack an opponent.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tPok\u00e9mon which use Confuse Ray, Supersonic or Confusion can often confuse your Pok\u00e9mon.  This status effect will leave your Pok\u00e9mon disoriented and can often lead to self-inflicted damage.  Although a Pok\u00e9mon can still attack while they're confused, it's totally random whether they'll attack themselves or their opponent.  This malady can't be cured with an item, but your Pok\u00e9mon can get back on its feet and get straightened out again.  Sometimes, you can become confused and not attack yourself at all! \n"}, {"text": "Which type of attack most commonly causes paralysis?", "correct": "Electric", "options": ["Fire", "Flying", "Water"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElectric.\n\n\tAside from giving a shocking jolt, many electric-type Pok\u00e9mon can paralyze your Pok\u00e9mon with a single attack.  While some attacks like Thunder, Thunderbolt, Thundershock, and Thunderpunch have a random chance of paralyzing, Thunder Wave will instantly paralyze.  Paralyze Heal can be found in Pok\u00e9marts for 200, but if you have a rock-type Pok\u00e9mon, don't worry.  None of the electric-type attacks will affect you.  Paralysis will decrease a Pok\u00e9mon's speed significantly in battle. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following will Leer decrease if used on an opponent?", "correct": "Defense", "options": ["Speed", "Attack", "Accuracy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDefense.\n\n\tLeer is a very simple Pok\u00e9mon attack that many Pok\u00e9mon will start out knowing.  The only thing it does is lower a Pok\u00e9mon's defense.  It won't lower as much defense as Screech will, but it will allow you to inflict more damage on your opponent regardless.  If you are a victim of a defense-lowering attack, try using X-Defend to temporarily raise your defense in battle. \n"}, {"text": "Which Pok\u00e9mon will usually learn the move Harden?", "correct": "Metapod", "options": ["Jynx", "Golem", "Pikachu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMetapod.\n\n\tBoth Kakuna and Metapod, the cocooned Pok\u00e9mon, will learn Harden in order to improve defense.  In fact, if you happen to battle wild Kakunas or Metapods, Harden will often be their only attacks.  Both are bug-type Pok\u00e9mon, so even if they use Harden, they shouldn't be able to stand up to a psychic attack. \n"}, {"text": "What will the technique Sharpen do if used by your Pok\u00e9mon?", "correct": "Raise attack strength", "options": ["Decrease enemy defense", "Raise accuracy", "Raise speed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaise attack strength.\n\n\tMuch like the grass-type technique Growth, Sharpen will increase your Pok\u00e9mon's attack power letting it attack a Pok\u00e9mon with the same strength that you would had you decreased your opponent's defense.  If you don't want to hang onto that move, then hang onto an item!  X-Attack can be used to raise your Pok\u00e9mon's attack power temporarily during battle while Protein can raise it permanently. \n"}, {"text": "What will the Double Team technique do?", "correct": "Make your Pok\u00e9mon more evasive", "options": ["Make your Pok\u00e9mon more accurate", "Make your opponent less defensive", "Make your Pok\u00e9mon more defensive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMake your Pok\u00e9mon more evasive.\n\n\tDouble Team is one of the few attacks that will allow your Pok\u00e9mon to actually increase your chance of having your opponent miss with their attack.  Another attack like this would be Minimize.  On the other side of the scale, you can also increase your accuracy.  Rather than them not hitting you, you could have increased chances of hitting them back.  There are items and techniques in Kanto that can help you do this such as the item X-Accuracy.  HM05 (Flash) will greatly decrease your opponent's accuracy in battle. \n"}]}
