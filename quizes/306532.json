{"id": "306532", "name": "\"Star Wars\" Drop or Add a Letter Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Movies Word Play"], "questions": [{"text": "To begin, you will write the first name of a \"Star Wars\" character.  You will drop or add a letter (I will tell you which) until you come up with the last name of that same \"Star Wars\" character!  For instance, I may start with Boba, and drop and add letters until I get to Fett!  Ready?  Go!\n\nWho is a smuggler who owes a lot of credits to Jabba?  I would like just his first name, please!", "correct": "Han", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHan.\n\n\tHan, yes, that lovable smuggler.  He is the flyer of the Millenium Falcon.  He is best friends to Chewbacca, and then becomes friends with Obi Wan, who he calls \"old man,\" and Luke Skywalker, who he calls \"kid.\" \n"}, {"text": "Drop a letter.\n\nTo Chewbacca, a Genosian is ___ alien.", "correct": "An", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn.\n\n\tOf course, to a Genosian, Chewbacca is the alien!  An alien is one who is not of your own race, or ethnicity, or any type of background.  Chewbacca is a Wookiee.  He is from Kashyyyk.  A Genosian is from Geonosis. \n"}, {"text": "Drop a letter!\n\nWhat is the first letter of the Gungan leader's last name?", "correct": "N", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nN.\n\n\tBoss Nass is his name, therefore, N is the first letter of his last name.  His full name is actually Rugar Nass.  Calling him Boss is like us calling someone president, or prime minister, or queen, or emperor.  \"Boss\" is \"leader\" to Gungans. \n"}, {"text": "Add a letter!\n\nWhen a lightsaber is shining, it is ___", "correct": "On", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn.\n\n\tWhen it is not shining, it is off.  A lightsaber is a Jedi's weapon of choice.  It activates by pressing a button.  The different colors are caused by crystals inside the lightsaber.  Light reflects off of the crystals, and the colors differ depending on the crystal.  The light through the crystal is also what causes the \"cutting edge\" power of the lightsaber. \n"}, {"text": "Add a letter!\n\nHow many rancors appear in the original trilogy of \"Star Wars?\"", "correct": "One", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tThe rancor is the beast that Jabba owns.  Oola is the first victim we see of the rancor.  At this point, however, we do not see the rancor.  Then a guard is eaten by the rancor.  Then Luke is the next target.  Of course, Luke survives.  This is from \"Return of the Jedi.\"  Of course, rancors are also mentioned in the \"Star Wars Expanded Universe,\" but only once in the original trilogy. \n"}, {"text": "Add a letter!\n\nWatto, perhaps, has the longest one, and Nute Gunray doesn't have one.", "correct": "Nose", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNose.\n\n\tWatto is the store owner that owns Anakin and Shmi Skywalker in \"The Phantom Menace.\"  Obi Wan and Qui Jon decide they would like to save Anakin from being a slave.  They felt a force about him no one could match.  Of course, freeing Anakin would turn out to be a huge mistake as he becomes Darth Vader later in the hexology. \n"}, {"text": "Add a letter!\n\nLeia Organa killed Jabba the Hutt by making a chain version of this.", "correct": "Noose", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNoose.\n\n\tA noose normally is made of rope, and hangs from the ceiling.  However, Leia \"copied\" this by choking him with chain.  She acted as the ceiling.  Instead of Jabba's weight forcing him down onto the chain choking him, she forced the chain deeper into his neck, choking him.  He, of course, died. \n"}, {"text": "Add a letter!\n\nOnce Jabba died, Leia could do this to the chain.", "correct": "Loosen", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoosen.\n\n\tOnce Jabba was dead, there was no need to keep pulling on the chain.  Therefore, she could loosen the chain that was around Jabba's neck.  Throughout that mini battle that occured with Jabba, one would have expected Luke or Han to kill Jabba, but Leia did! \n"}, {"text": "Drop a letter!\n\nNot all Gungans are as clumsy as Jar Jar, but some are just as stupid.  Therefore, a collection of these Gungans would be called a what, also a group of birds?", "correct": "Loons", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoons.\n\n\tLoons are water birds, and also goofs or \"not-too-smart\" ones.  Of course, Jar Jar fits this description, as do other Gungans.  Of course, Boss Nass and General Tarpals do not appreciate Jar Jar and the others, although Jar Jar was the only one who was banished for being such a klutz! \n"}, {"text": "Drop a letter!\n\nThis is the last name of the smuggler from question 1, which can also be a single singer.", "correct": "Solo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSolo.\n\n\tHan Solo, the full character's name.  This man helped Luke destroy the Death Star, although he wasn't going to originally.  He was in it, at first, for the money. \n"}]}
