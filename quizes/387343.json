{"id": "387343", "name": "Down the Rabbit Hole Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Fantasy"], "questions": [{"text": "Our first adventurer is a girl named Alice. Pursuing an intriguing white bunny, she literally goes down a rabbit hole in Lewis Carroll's novel. What does she find at the bottom?", "correct": "Wonderland", "options": ["Pern", "Discworld", "Middle Earth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWonderland.\n\n\tIn his 1865 novel \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", Lewis Carroll (pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) described a place by turns charming and terrifying. Alice literally cries a river in which talking animals swim; she learns about William the Conqueror from a talking mouse, receives advice from a caterpillar, contemplates riddles at a highly unusual tea party, and (barely) survives a very violent game of croquet with the Queen of Hearts. The work is a prototypical portal fantasy, and also a founding work of a genre fittingly known as \"literary nonsense.\" \n"}, {"text": "C.S. Lewis's \"Narnia\" series is one of the most famous portal fantasies ever written. Which of these is NOT a way that a character in the story enters the magical world of Narnia?", "correct": "By reciting an epic Narnian poem", "options": ["By using magical rings", "By walking through a wooden wardrobe", "By falling into a painting of a ship on the ocean"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy reciting an epic Narnian poem.\n\n\tThe wooden wardrobe is the portal in the first-written of the novels, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", published in 1950. The four Pevensie children -- Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy -- walk through a wardrobe in an English country mansion, and find themselves in a snow-covered land with talking animals and an oppressive White Witch. Their adventures there have captivated children for decades.\r After their return to England, and a subsequent adventure in \"Prince Caspian,\" Lucy and Edmund end up accompanying their cousin Eustace back to the other world via a painting of a ship in the third novel, \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\". In this case, they aren't truly in Narnia proper, but rather on a Narnian ship searching for missing Narnian lords. \r The magical rings turn up in the prequel, \"The Magician's Nephew\", in which a sorcerer creates magical rings to travel between worlds -- and then, in clear violation of all ethical rules of magic, tricks children into testing them out for him. It is a delight to follow the unfolding connection of these children, and these worlds, to Narnia. \n"}, {"text": "In Neil Gaiman's 2002 novel \"Coraline\", a young girl discovers a mysterious door in her home, leading to a strange and wondrous version of her own apartment. She has an Other Mother and Other Father there, who seem to be much nicer than her own; there are even fascinating Other Neighbors. The place seems perfect. What does Coraline have to do to stay there forever?", "correct": "Let the Other Mother sew buttons over her eyes", "options": ["Click her heels together three times", "Write a letter telling her real parents she's run away to Australia", "Kill her real parents"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLet the Other Mother sew buttons over her eyes.\n\n\tDisturbed by this request, Coraline flees back to her own home -- but her parents are gone, kidnapped by the Other Mother. The whole Other World is a trap for children from our world, but to save her family Coraline will have to return and outwit their enemy. \"Coraline\" is an eerie and unusual coming-of-age tale, dark and delicious. \n"}, {"text": "In Philip Pullman's trilogy \"His Dark Materials,\" characters can pass between one fantasy world and another. The first book takes place in a world that is similar to ours; subsequently, our heroes travel elsewhere by various means. Which of these tools, named in the title of one of the books, allows them to create portals between worlds?", "correct": "The Subtle Knife", "options": ["The Amber Spyglass", "The Sword in the Stone", "The Red Dress"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Subtle Knife.\n\n\tThe Subtle Knife, introduced in the eponymous second volume of the series (published in 1997), is an incredibly sharp and precise tool (or perhaps a weapon). It can cut through anything, even atoms or elementary particles; in cutting through the fabric of space, it can open a portal between one world and another. Our heroes, Lyra and Will, will make great use of it in their adventures. \n"}, {"text": "In this novel by Diana Gabaldon, a 1940s nurse named Claire walks into a circle of standing stones and finds herself in another world: 1700s Scotland. A time-travel fantasy and a historical romance, the book wound up beginning a tremendously popular series. What is it called?", "correct": "Outlander", "options": ["One Moment in Time", "The Visitor", "Kate and Leopold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOutlander.\n\n\t\"Outlander\", published in 1991, captured readers' imagination with the plucky 20th-century Claire Randall and the charming, heroic 18th-century Jamie Fraser. At first, torn between two worlds, Claire struggles to find acceptance with the Scots of the time -- and then, she finds love, all while struggling with her distressing foreknowledge of the clans' historical fate. \n"}, {"text": "Violent weather events can be a surprisingly effective means of magical transport! In L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", how does Dorothy Gale end up traveling from the state of Kansas to the land of Oz?", "correct": "In her farmhouse, carried by a tornado", "options": ["By following a magical road", "In a chicken coop, tossed on the ocean", "By falling through the earth in an earthquake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn her farmhouse, carried by a tornado.\n\n\tDorothy should have fled to the storm cellar when she saw the tornado coming, but she went back for her little dog, Toto. She's sure that her brief flight in the house will have an unhappy ending -- and is incredulous when she steps out into a magical realm. Even better, she's already a local hero, having squashed the local Wicked Witch when the house landed! Of course, the tale gets more complicated from there -- the Wicked Witch has a vengeful sister -- but Dorothy's pluck, and her loyal friends, carry readers smoothly through the story.\r After the incredible success of his 1900 novel, Baum returned to the land of Oz for thirteen additional books. Dorothy made several perilous return journeys there before finally settling in Oz permanently. The third book, \"Ozma of Oz\", is when Dorothy washes ashore in a chicken coop after falling overboard on a sea voyage. The fourth book, \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\", sees her slipping through a chasm created from an earthquake. She must be very grateful for the rather staid route provided in the fifth book, \"The Road to Oz\"! \n"}, {"text": "Most literary heroes who pass through portals have some hope of getting home again -- but not always. In the story \"He Walked Around the Horses\", part of the Paratime series, Benjamin Bathurst's fate is sealed when he accidentally steps into a parallel universe while walking through a stableyard in 1809. Who wrote this short story?", "correct": "H. Beam Piper", "options": ["C. S. Lewis", "Eric Flint", "Harry Turtledove"], "explanation": "\n\n\nH. Beam Piper\n\n\tPiper's Paratime universe is quite an interesting one: travelers can pass between an infinite number of parallel universes, each with its own timeline and its own distinctive history. Members of the resource-starved Home Timeline obtain critical goods from these other timelines. Poor Benjamin Bathurst knows none of this, of course, when he accidentally ends up outside his own time in a 1948 story. Though he's in a \"real\" timeline on Earth, it sounds like a fantasy to him. There's no Napoleon and no war-racked Europe. The American Revolution has failed, bloodily. His own British diplomatic papers make no sense to anyone, and he is imprisoned on suspicion of espionage. \r A poignant twist to this story is that Benjamin Bathurst is a real historical figure: a young British diplomat who disappeared in Prussia, while trying to return to the UK during the Napoleonic Wars. Supposedly, Bathurst disappeared when he passed out of his companion's sight, just for a moment. This unsolved historical mystery briefly captivated the newspapers, and gave Piper a perfect hook for his portal. \n"}, {"text": "In Christopher Stasheff's novel \"Her Majesty's Wizard\", hero Matthew Mantrell is unusually well prepared for his trip to a magical version of France. With what skill does Matthew quickly become known as a powerful wizard?", "correct": "Poetry", "options": ["Acrobatics", "Chemistry", "Weaving"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoetry.\n\n\tIn this fantasy world, spells are cast using poetry. Matthew, a graduate student in English, is summoned by a spell written on an ancient and intriguing piece of parchment. He quickly discovers that his literary knowledge has a very practical  application here: between his vast bank of poetry and his general scientific knowledge, he's essentially unstoppable in a medieval, magical world. Published in 1986, \"Her Majesty's Wizard\" is the first of eight books in the series \"A Wizard in Rhyme\". It's neither high poetry nor high literature, but it is high fun. \n"}, {"text": "The young boy Bastian loves reading books and escaping to other worlds. When he picks up one particular fantasy novel, however, he gets much more than he expected: HE seems to be the savior whom the characters have been searching for. What's the title of this 1979 novel by Michael Ende?", "correct": "The Neverending Story", "options": ["Six Characters in Search of an Author", "Spaceballs", "Stranger Than Fiction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Neverending Story.\n\n\tOriginally published in German as \"Die unendliche Geschichte\", this novel combines adventure and high fantasy with a soulful sense of the importance of books and imagination. Bastian follows the struggles of Atreyu and the Childlike Empress with his heart in his mouth; as we read about those struggles and Bastian's, our hearts are in our mouths, too. \n"}, {"text": "Portal fantasies usually end with the traveler returning home, perhaps with a newfound drive to reconcile with family and appreciate what they've almost lost. The novella \"Every Heart a Doorway\" begins after that seemingly happy ending, with children who are desperately homesick for the worlds beyond that portal. Who wrote this eerie reflection on the consequences of adventure? ", "correct": "Seanan McGuire", "options": ["Jules Verne", "Mary Shelley", "Robert Heinlein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeanan McGuire.\n\n\tPublished in 2016, \"Every Heart a Doorway\" takes us to a boarding school for children who can't quite give up on their fantasy worlds. How can you adjust to real life when the portal world was so much brighter and more exciting, and when your parents and friends think that you're making everything up? The school in this novella is a safe haven for strange children who can't stand to be normal -- until a horrific crime makes it clear that no place is ultimately safe for an adventurer. \n"}]}
