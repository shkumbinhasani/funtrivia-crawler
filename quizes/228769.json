{"id": "228769", "name": "From 'SNL' to the Movies Online Quiz | Something in Common | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Connected with Television"], "questions": [{"text": "What was the first movie to reach the big screen that was derived from a 'Saturday Night Live' skit/act?", "correct": "The Blues Brothers", "options": ["Dr. Detroit", "Neighbors", "The Coneheads"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blues Brothers.\n\n\t'The Blues Brothers' was released to theaters in 1980.  Starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, it documents the reassembling of the greatest rhythm and blues revue band in the history of Chicago.  John Landis directed this magical film, that features cameos by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, James Brown and Cab Calloway. \n"}, {"text": "'The Ladies Man' came to theaters in the year 2000.  Which 'Saturday Night Live' regular played the role of the lead character, aka Leon Phelps?", "correct": "Tim Meadows", "options": ["Jimmy Fallon", "Rob Schneider", "Chris Rock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTim Meadows.\n\n\tLeon Phelps, aka 'The Ladies Man', is probably the best known character portrayed by Meadows during his nine-year run on 'Saturday Night Live'.  Leon Phelps is a therapist with a few too many male hormones running through his body. \n"}, {"text": "Longtime 'SNL' regulars Mike Myers and Dana Carvey brought their 'Wayne's World' skit to the big screen in 1992.  Was this Dana Carvey's only 'SNL' skit to make it to the big screen?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tSadly, Dana Carvey never did a Church Lady film, nor did he and Kevin Nealon translate their Hans and Franz to the big screen.  Carvey did do his George Bush impression in the movie 'Opportunity Knocks', but that certainly doesn't constitute a skit to screen by any stretch of the imagination. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the sexually ambiguous character that Julia Sweeney brought to the silver screen in 1994?  ", "correct": "Pat", "options": ["Kim", "Chris", "Leslie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPat.\n\n\t'It's Pat' hit the theaters in 1994, much to the chagrin of audiences everywhere.  Sadly, this movie didn't quite reach the high levels of comedy attained by Sweeney's 'Pat' skits on 'SNL'.  'It's Pat' was nominated (but surprisingly did not win) a Golden Raspberry in 1994.  The movie is rated in the bottom 100 at IMDB.com. \n"}, {"text": "What is the last name of the brothers, played by Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, who are featured in the 'SNL' skit-to-film 'A Night at the Roxbury', from 1998?", "correct": "Butabi", "options": ["Kohlrabi", "Wasabi", "Monkabi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nButabi.\n\n\tSome may call it cheesy, but 'A Night at the Roxbury' is a guilty pleasure for me.  In the film, the Butabi brothers finally get into the Roxbury club, thanks to the help of television star Richard Grieco.  Fellow 'SNL' cast members Molly Shannon and Colin Quinn co-star. \n"}, {"text": "What is the full name of Molly Shannon's 'Superstar', the feature character of that 1999 comedy?", "correct": "Mary Katherine Gallagher", "options": ["Harmony Serenade Scaramouch", "Maria Conchita Alonso", "Sally Lionne O'Malley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMary Katherine Gallagher.\n\n\tMary Katherine Gallagher is a rather eccentric Catholic school girl played by Molly Shannon in both the television series and in the film 'Superstar'.  The film also features 'SNL's' Will Ferrell, and is directed by 'Kids in the Hall' veteran Bruce McCulloch.  Mark McKinney, also from 'Kids', makes an appearance here as well. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1995 Al Franken vehicle, who does his shockingly sensitive character Stuart Smalley save?", "correct": "His family", "options": ["His personified self esteem", "The President", "Michael Jordan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis family.\n\n\t'Stuart Saves his Family' features the Al Franken character Stuart Smalley of 'personal affirmation' fame.  With his entire family in crisis, Stuart must deal with the problems of each family member one by one.  Not the greatest 'SNL'-to-film moment, this Harold Ramis-directed film does supply a few good laughs.  Julia Sweeney and Phil Harman make appearances in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "You may not realize it, but what cult favorite 1999 film from the ingenious mind of Mike Judge was originally inspired by a series of short animated sketches on 'Saturday Night Live'?", "correct": "Office Space", "options": ["American Pie", "The Cable Guy", "Anger Management"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOffice Space.\n\n\t'Office Space' is the story of Peter Gibbons and friends, fed up office workers at a cookie cutter company who hatch a rebellious plot to cheat their place of employment of a lot of money.  The idea for this film came from a series of shorts entitled 'Office Space' that Mike Judge created for 'Saturday Night Live' in the early 1990s. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the original Coneheads did not reprise their 'Saturday Night Live' sketch role in the 1993 film version?", "correct": "Laraine Newman", "options": ["Dan Aykroyd", "Jane Curtin", "All of them reprised their roles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaraine Newman.\n\n\tDan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin played Beldar and Prymaat Conehead in both the sketch and film versions, but Laraine Newman did not return as daughter Connie (most likely because she was a bit too old to play a teenaged daughter).  However, Newman did appear in the film as Laarta, another Conehead from the planet Remulak.  Michelle Burke played Connie in the film.\r More 'SNL' performers appeared in this film than any other (a total of 16).  Aside from the 'Saturday Night Live' alums (and future performers), the film included an all-star cast with Jason Alexander, Sinbad, Eddie Griffin, Michael Richards, Drew Carey, Parker Posey, Dave Thomas, Ellen DeGeneres and Tom Arnold all making appearances.  Sadly, despite all the stars, the movie was not a great success. \n"}, {"text": "Besides 'Wayne's World', which other 'Saturday Night Live' sketch-to-film had a sequel?", "correct": "The Blues Brothers", "options": ["Coneheads", "A Night at the Roxbury", "Superstar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blues Brothers.\n\n\t'Blues Brothers 2000' emerged in theaters in 1998 (making one wonder why it was called 'Blues Brothers 2000').  It features Elwood Blues on another 'Mission from God' to reunite the band after being released from prison.  In place of John Belushi we have John Goodman, who plays Mighty Mack McTeer.  A slew of music performers also appear, including Erykah Badu and B.B. King.  Methinks they should have stayed home!\r Thanks for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it. \n"}]}
