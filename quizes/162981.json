{"id": "162981", "name": "JFK: The Suspects Online Trivia | U.S. Presidents | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", "     U.S. Presidents", " John F. Kennedy"], "questions": [{"text": "Oswald: In 2003, a woman has came forth and suggested that she was Oswald's mistress in Dallas at the time of the assassination. What is the name of this woman?", "correct": "Judyth Baker", "options": ["Ruth Paine", "Helen Markham", "Madeline Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJudyth Baker.\n\n\tOswald is a shadowy figure; it's hard to separate reality from mere appearance. Many writers have claimed that Oswald \"impersonators\" were involved in laying false trails to set him up as the fall guy that he claimed to be. Someone seems to have been using him as a pawn...but who? (And, of course, once captured, he would need to be \"taken out\". Enter Jack Ruby. Coinicidence? Unlikely.)\rBaker has recently written a book and been interviewed on tv, claiming that she was involved with Oswald at the time of the shooting of JFK. She claimed that he was reluctantly caught up in the conspiracy, but was not a participant in the shooting. \rHelen Markham was a (shaky) witness to the shooting of police officer J.D. Tippitt; she was walking when she stumbled on the scene. No one is quite certain how the shooting of Tippitt fits into the bigger picture. \rRuth Paine was \"landlady\" to Oswald's wife, Marina, at the time of the shooting. (Marina and Lee were living apart.) \rMadeline Brown says that she was LBJ's mistress at the time of the shooting  - and says that LBJ had advance knowledge of what was going to happen. \n"}, {"text": "Vietnam: A recent book suggests that the assassination was in retaliation for the Kennedy administration's involvement in the assassination of this Vietnamese leader. ", "correct": "Diem", "options": ["Ho Chi Minh", "Ky", "Thieu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiem.\n\n\t\"Triangle of Blood\" by Brad O'Leary (and a co-author) suggests that the involvement of the Kennedy administration in the assassination of Vietnamese leader Diem led to retaliation that resulted in JFK's death. Thieu and Ky were leaders of Vietnam during the Vietnamese war. Ho Chi Minh was also prominent at that time. \n"}, {"text": "LBJ: Still another book suggests that LBJ engineered the assassination. Who was in the vice-presidential car along with LBJ in Dallas?", "correct": "Ralph Yarborough", "options": ["Arlen Specter", "Ed Hoffman", "Mark Lane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRalph Yarborough.\n\n\tLBJ had plenty of problems at the time of the shooting: scandals with Bobby Baker and Billy Sol Estes, a rough relationship with the Kennedys, and the possibility of being dropped from the ticket in 1964. Suddenly, he's president and all those problems disappear. \rBarr McClellan writes in \"Blood, Money and Power\" that he worked as an attorney with a law firm that represented LBJ (and was run by LBJ's closest friend). McClellan claims that LBJ played a key role in the assassination. Yarborough was a U.S. senator at the time.\rArlen Specter is \"credited\" - and that is definitely not the right word - with the wildly fanciful \"magic bullet theory.\" Mark Lane was an early critic of the Warren Commission with his book \"Rush to Judgment.\" Hoffman is the deaf mute who claims to have witnessed the shooting: he has written a book about his observations (and his futile attempts to tell the authorities about what he saw) and has been interviewed on television. \n"}, {"text": "FBI/CIA Intelligence: This individual claims to have been involved with intelligence operations -- and also claims to have allowed himself to be arrested at the time of the assassination so that s)he would have an alibi.", "correct": "Richard Case Nagel", "options": ["Rose Cheramie", "Karyn Kupcinet", "David Ferrie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Case Nagel.\n\n\tCertain elements of the FBI and CIA were less than thrilled with JFK, his position on Cuba and communism, etc. Nagel claims to have intentionally gotten arrested (by discharging a firearm in a bank) in order to have an alibi. He went to prison. (See Dick Russell's book: \"The Man Who Knew Too Much.\")\rRose Cheramie is the woman who was injured and tossed from a car, then warned at the hospital that JFK was going to be killed. She died later in another traffic incident. \rKaryn Kupcinet, aspiring actress and daughter of Chicago TV personality Irv Kupcinet, allegedly claimed to have also warned in advance that the president was going to be killed. Her death also was somewhat mysterious. \rDavid Ferrie was the curious-looking fellow who turns up in a variety of places. He, too, died mysteriously. \n"}, {"text": "Cuba: It has been suggested that JFK was targeted by Cubans in part due to the Bay of Pigs affair. How did the plans to invade Cuba (that culminated in the failure at the Bay of Pigs) originate?", "correct": "It originated during the Eisenhower administration", "options": ["It originated with JFK", "It originated with rogue intelligence agents during the Kennedy administration", "It originated with RFK"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt originated during the Eisenhower administration.\n\n\tWas there an obsession with Cuba and Castro and Communism in the 60's?Castro and his followers may have been aware of attempts by the US during the Kennedy administration to kill the Cuban leader - and may have retaliated.\rAnti-Castro Cubans may have felt betrayed by JFK's failure to provide critical air support for the bay of pigs invasion and fiasco.\rThe plan originated with the Eisenhower administration and continued with the Kennedy administration - although \"who knew what\" is open to debate. \n"}, {"text": "Judith Exner has been identified as a woman who apparently had a relationship with both JFK and with which mob leader?", "correct": "Sam Giancana", "options": ["Johnny Roselli", "Santos Trafficante", "Carlos Marcello"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam Giancana.\n\n\tThe mob allegedly helped JFK get elected - and then felt the sting of RFK's war on crime. JFK was apparently involved with Exner - who was also involved with Giancana.\rMarcello and Trafficante were also mob leaders; Roselli was another key player in the mob at the time. \n"}, {"text": "Big Oil: Big Oil has been accused of complicity in the shooting.  Clint Murchison was one big oilman at that time; which of the following was another \"big oil\" man?", "correct": "H.L. Hunt", "options": ["Christian David", "E Howard Hunt", "Gordon Arnold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nH.L. Hunt\n\n\t\"Big Oil\" was not overly fond of JFK - nor, for that matter was Dallas (or Texas). HL Hunt was a huge oil tycoon at the time. \rE Howard Hunt was involved in intelligence activities; his name also pops up in Watergate. \rChristian David has claimed to have been offered a contract to shoot JFK; he turned it down - but claims to have knowledge of who did the shooting. He is presently in jail in Europe. \rGordon Arnold may have been present when the shooting occurred -- he claims that shots came from the grassy knoll. \n"}, {"text": "Right Wing: The radical right has also been accused of involvement in the assassination. Which of the following is NOT a member of the radical right?", "correct": "James Hosty", "options": ["Guy Bannister", "Edwin Walker", "Howard Milteer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Hosty.\n\n\tRabid anti-communist right wing advocates may have been involved. Hosty, however, was with the FBI at the time of the shooting; he irritated Oswald by paying a \"house call\" on him.\rMilteer, a right winger, was caught on tape in Miami talking (with an informant) about plans to kill JFK in a crossfire. \rBannister, an ex-fbi man who was in New orleans along with oswald, was known to be anti-communist and violent. \rWalker was a retired general who was forced out because of his radical ideas. Someone took a shot at him one night - Oswald is suspected. If Oswald did it, why did he do it? An independent assassination effort by Oswald that failed - or a test to see if Oswald could go through with an assassination? \n"}, {"text": "Soviet Union: This individual claims to have been involved in monitoring Oswald's activity on behalf of the Soviet Union.", "correct": "Yuri Nosenko", "options": ["Allen Dulles", "Silva Odio", "Earlene Roberts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYuri Nosenko.\n\n\t\"Cold War\" tactics? Revenge for the Cuban Missile Crisis?\rNosenko has a book out about his \"monitoring \" of Oswald. \rDulles, former CIA head during the Bay of Pigs, was appointed to the Warren Commission. \rRoberts was Oswald's landlady at the time; she tells of a police car  coming by to see Oswald after JFK had been shot. \rOdio tells an interesting story about encountering Oswald and Jack Ruby together prior to the shooting of JFK. \n"}, {"text": "The Shooters: Which of these has NOT been identified as one of the shooters?", "correct": "Lee Bowers", "options": ["Charles Harrelson", "L:ucien Sarti", "Charles Rogers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLee Bowers.\n\n\tSarti was named by Christian David (above) as the shooter, according to Stephen Rivele. Rivele's story has been told on tv; his book is apparently not available in English.\rCharles Harrelson, father of actor Woody Harrelson, has told different stories at different times. He was imprisoned subsequently for involvement in a separate shooting.\rCharles Rogers has been suggested in at least one book, \"The Man on the Grassy Knoll\", as a shooter. Rogers' parents died violently; the book identifies him as a suspect there, too. \rBoth Rogers and Harrelson have been suggested as being among the \"three tramps\" that were spotted in the railroad yard and detained. \rLee Bowers is the railroad man who spotted the tramps; he later died in a traffic accident.\r(Many witnesses died mysteriously. Dorothy Kilgallen is perhaps the most famous of these: she interviewed Jack Ruby in prison and claimed to have \"big stuff\" forthcoming before her curious death.)\rOther candidates for \"shooters\" include names that also appear in connection with Watergate. In that context, some have suggested possible involvement by Nixon.\rOther books of note include: \"Appointment in Dallas,\" \"Deep Politics,\" \"High Treason\", \"Coup d'etat in America\". \n"}]}
