In the United States, the song did not even place in the Hot 100, yet it was popular enough to be certified gold for selling half a million copies. The music video for this single is quite nifty as well; as a Norah Jones fan myself, I might suggest you watch it, especially to cheer you up when you're feeling down. \n"}, {"text": "\"Shiver on your roof and see your face lit by starlight.

The band originated in Boulder, Colorado in 2004. If you're curious, the incorrect options were also all bands who were formed in Colorado.\r Now, for fun, take your index fingers and thumbs and make a circle, extending the remaining six fingers in the air. This symbol represents the band 3OH!3, as there are 3 fingers, an O made from index fingers and thumbs, and then another 3 fingers. \n"}, {"text": "\"She believes life is made up of all that you're used to, and the clock on the wall has been stuck on three for days and days.\"\n\nThis song is called \"3 AM\".

Rob Thomas wrote the lyrics to the song based on his experience as a child with a mother battling cancer. \n"}, {"text": "\"in the daylight, we'll be on our own.
