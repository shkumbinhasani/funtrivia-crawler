Mr. Schuester arrives at school and Rachel immediately talks to him about sheet music heavily featuring her lead vocals.  As she leaves, Will passes by Kurt being thrown into the dumpster by the football team once again.  Emma purposely runs into Will and he thanks her for the advice saying he always knew his place was at the school.  Quinn, the cheerleading captain, informs Will that Sue Sylvester wants to see him in her office.\rSue welcomes Will into the room and she shows him a rule book she picked up at the library which states that Will needs twelve kids to even be considered contenders in Glee Club competitions, and since he only has five and a half, he needs to get to work.  Sue admits that she's looking for an opportunity for Will to compromise himself and ruin everything.  She claims that he can't steal the spotlight from her and suggests he euthanize the group.  Will decides he can't back down. \n"}, {"text": "What song does Will initially want the kids to sing at a pep assembly for the school?", "correct": "\"Le Freak\" by Chic", "options": ["\"Stop\" by Spice Girls", "\"All That She Wants\" by Ace of Base", "\"The Locomotion\" by Kylie Minogue"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Le Freak\" by Chic.\n\n\tIn the halls between class, Rachel puts on her makeup at her locker while Finn and his girlfriend, Quinn Fabray, argue in the background.  Quinn wants Finn to quit Glee Club since people are calling him gay and he doesn't need to 'express himself' because they're popular already.  When he leaves, she has a talk with Rachel saying that she can't have Finn as they're already an item.  Rachel says it doesn't matter- she already has suitors and Glee Club is getting popular.  As she turns to leave, she's splashed in the face with two slushies.\rIn auditions, Glee Club finds that they're singing and dancing to Chic's \"Le Freak\", a song that they stop halfway through when Rachel nearly high-kicks Mercedes' face.  They all comment that the song isn't modern enough for them; even Kurt admits that the song is 'gay'.  Will assures them though that since the song won the school nationals in the early '90s, it's more than fine to perform for the school at the end of the week during a pep assembly.  Everyone is less-than-thrilled. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Terri's sister?", "correct": "Kendra", "options": ["Brittany", "Romy", "Jennifer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKendra.\n\n\tAfter school, Will and his wife, Terri, decide to go out house hunting because they're starting a new family and they want to move.  While Terri speaks with the real estate agent about really trivial matters (the colours of the Christmas trees to anticipate in their backyard, for example), Will wonders what life would be like. Will recalls that it was Terri's sister, Kendra, who put it into Terri's head that they needed a new place over dinner.  While her kids ran around the dinner table destroying furniture, she mentioned that they needed a new place so that Terri could keep her craft room.  While looking at the new home, Terri says that they can't take a used house because their baby can't grow up in unsanitary conditions. When the real estate agent starts listing off prices, Will is a bit flustered and tells Terri they can't have it all or they'll lose everything.  Terri leads Will upstairs to the beautiful room where their \"daughter or gay son will sleep\" and she tries to persuade him that it's the best idea.  When he says they can't afford it, she claims that it's her own \"Sophie's Choice\" moment and she gives up the $24,000 sun nook to get the house.  He finally agrees since it's part of their dream and he'd take a part-time job if it meant they could be happy. \n"}, {"text": "Will allows the kids in Glee Club to sing \"Gold Digger\".  Which artist originally sang the song?", "correct": "Kanye West", "options": ["Jay-Z", "Eminem", "50 Cent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKanye West.\n\n\tIn response to the group's plea for modern music, Will, fresh off the house-hunting excitement, decides to let them sing Kanye West's \"Gold Digger\" (though they still have to do \"Le Freak\" for the pep assembly).  Although he gives Finn the lead vocals, Finn refuses saying that he's still learning to sing and walk at the same time.  Will takes lead vocals with the kids doing back-up lyrics.  Meanwhile, Terri and her sister plan the new house out, taking measurements in the baby's room.\rAfter practice, Emma finds Rachel trying to throw up in the washroom.  She takes her into her office and hands her a pamphlet called \"So You Like Throwing Up\" to talk her out of it.  Rachel claims that she won't ever try it again though since it made her feel bad and it didn't really work.  She tells Emma that she wants to be thin just like Quinn Fabray because she likes someone so much that she wants to lock herself into her room, listen to sad music, and cry.  Emma claims she's never done this (though we clearly see her singing Celine Dion's \"All By Myself\" thinking about Will in her car).  Rachel tells Emma that he doesn't even notice her, but she suggests that Rachel just find common interests with her crush to see if things fall into place. \n"}, {"text": "In regards to the new house that Will and Terri want to purchase, what component is Terri willing to part with?", "correct": "A grand foyer", "options": ["A breakfast nook", "A sunroom", "An in-ground pool"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA grand foyer.\n\n\tFinn and Rachel end up in Principal Figgins' office with Will and Sue Sylvester.  She explains that Finn was concerned about his solo in front of the pep assembly so she took him aside and they made some advertisements for Glee Club by creating a flyer and copying it.  Sue found them using the Cheerios' personal photocopier to do this, dropping her protein shake on the floor in the process.  Will simply suggests they pay for the seventeen copies they made and Figgins says it's a more-than-viable solution, but he requires that Sue clean up the mess she made on the floor.  When she claims that a janitor could do it, Figgins states that they have no janitorial staff because of the recession.  As they depart the office, Sue claims that Lady Justice has wept over the circumstances.  Rachel and Finn plea with Will over the \"Le Freak\" song choice, but he persists that everyone loves disco, so it'll be fine.  When Rachel suggests to Finn that they practice after school the next day, he says he can't- he has a celibacy club meeting with Quinn.\rAt home, Will tells Terri he can't find a job because of the recession and they may have to forgo the plans for a grand foyer in the new house.  She tells Will that she is too tired of compromising everything and that he has to find a way to make the money.  Terri blames the Glee Club since he spends too much time choreographing their dance numbers and no one gives back.\rThe next day, Will finds Principal Figgins cleaning Sue's congealed protein shake since she got a note from the school nurse claiming her Lupus is acting up.  Will offers to take a janitorial position for some extra money and Figgins agrees. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters is not seen as a member of the Celibacy Club during this episode?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Finn", "Rachel", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tRachel decides to join the Celibacy Club, hoping that she can get closer to Finn through her admission.  To do this, Rachel needs to sit with the girls of the group (who are forced by the school to let everyone join) with Finn's girlfriend, Quinn, as the head of the club.  When Rachel, sitting on the opposite side of the room, asks where the boys are, Quinn lets her know that the club spends half of the time apart to talk, then they come together.  Finn, with the guys, openly admits he just joined to sleep with Quinn, but the club itself makes it kind of difficult.  The guys simply talk about being repressed while the girls talk about teasing the guys with short skirts.  One of the guys asks how Finn restrains himself in pleasing situations, and while Finn claims it's not a problem, he actually admits to himself that he has to find a memory which which he hit somebody with his car during his driving test to block out any thoughts.\rWhen the guys and girls finally get together, they are forced to pair up with a balloon and practice keeping a safe enough distance in each other's arms so that it doesn't burst between them (or, as Quinn says, it makes the angels cry).  Rachel is the first to speak up saying that celibacy in high schools doesn't work and that girls want to sleep with guys as much as they do.  She storms out on the meeting. \n"}, {"text": "Whose idea is it to change the Glee Club's pep assembly routine for something featuring 'more sex'?", "correct": "Rachel's", "options": ["Mercedes'", "Finn's", "Kurt's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel's.\n\n\tOne night, Emma finds Will doing janitorial work in the school and he admits he's doing it to make ends meet for the new house.  Emma offers to help since she knows the ins and outs of the classroom.  Will, during their cleaning, decides to help her with her mess problem since she's too obsessive about dirt.  Emma admits that she doesn't like messes because her brother once pushed her into a lagoon of dairy farm run-off.  Will places a speck of chalkdust onto her nose for ten seconds before wiping it off.  Both of them stare into each others' eyes before she says she has to leave.  As she departs, Ken, the gym teacher, watches their conversation from another classroom.\rRachel calls an emergency meeting for Glee Club to suggest that they change \"Le Freak\" into a more appealing song.  Her reasoning, the students want more sexual content.  The others are intrigued by the idea and hear her out.\rAt the assembly begins, Mr. Schuester introduces the Glee Club and takes his seat in the audience for the performance, but he's shocked to see that they've changed their song to an overly-sexualized performance of Salt-N-Pepa's \"Push It\".  While the kids in the audience are wowed by the performance and give a standing ovation, Sue is shocked and immediately talks to Principal Figgins, and Will is disappointed that the kids went behind his back. \n"}, {"text": "After the pep assembly, Principal Figgins tells Will that he has made a list of pre-approved songs for Glee Club to perform.  When Will looks it over, he comments that all of the songs have either 'Jesus' or what other word in the title?", "correct": "Balloons", "options": ["Lord", "Praise", "Holy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalloons.\n\n\tSue brings Will in to see Principal Figgins and she says that it was simply too much for Glee Club.  Figgins too admits that he has received angry emails from parents regarding the performance.  Sue demands Will's resignation from his job and the disbanding of Glee Club but Figgins says that it has raised student moral and that everyone was entertained.  He gives Will a list of acceptable songs given to him by his church and demands that he pull from it for inspiration though Will finds them to be too religious or about balloons.  Figgins also decides to cut the Cheerios' dry cleaning budget to give the Glee Club some costumes.  Sue is outraged, but Figgins suggests that the dry cleaners in the US are just as good as the ones in Europe.\rOutside the office, Will has a chat with Rachel saying it was unfair to go behind his back and that they're now bound by a list of songs.  Rachel checks the list over and asks what a 'Luftballoon' is before Will departs.\rIn the staff room, Ken approaches Emma asking her out on a date to Tulip-Palooza.  She denies the invitation and he goes on a short rant about why he's a better candidate than Will, who's already in a healthy marriage.  He leaves her with the thought. \n"}, {"text": "In order to get into Glee Club, Quinn enlists the help of how many Cheerios to audition for Mr. Schuester?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Four", "Three", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tRachel and Finn finally get time alone to practice in the auditorium and Finn admits that he's getting hungry.  Luckily, Rachel has set up a picnic lunch, complete with pillows, on the stage.  Finn admits that he wanted to get lessons from Rachel because although he was scared that she may have been insane at first, he heard her sing and knew she was talented.  He tells her that she was cool for speaking out at the Celibacy Club meeting and they share a kiss.  The moment is cut short though when Finn is forced to recall his tragic car crash memory.  He rushes out of the auditorium and asks Rachel not to tell anybody.  Rachel assumes she did something wrong and feels guilty.\rTerri, meanwhile, goes to her appointment with her OB/GYN for an ultrasound and is told the shocking news that she's not actually pregnant.  Although she's worried that the baby may have 'fallen out', he tells her that she was experiencing symptoms of hysterical pregnancy.\rAt school, Mr. Schuester is shocked to find Quinn and her friends in his presence.  Quinn says that she and Finn are an item together, and she wouldn't be a good girlfriend if she didn't join.  She and fellow Cheerios, Santana and Brittany, perform the Dionne Warwick song \"I Say a Little Prayer\" for their audition, one of the songs listed on Principal Figgins' list, and they're let in.  They later admit to Sue, their coach, that they did it to both spy on Glee Club to bring them down on the inside and plant seeds to lead to its downfall, and for Quinn to make sure Finn is kept in line.  Sue is pleased with these actions. \n"}, {"text": "What song does Rachel sing to close out the episode?", "correct": "Take a Bow", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTake a Bow.\n\n\tWill invites Emma to join him in cleaning some of the science classrooms later that night and Emma denies the invitation stating that it would be foolish to spend the time since he's married with a baby on the way.  She then admits that she has a date with Ken Tanaka and leaves, visibly disappointed with herself.\rWill returns home to find Terri still awake, having cooked dinner for the two of them to talk about important matters.  Will says that sometimes he forgets what he's doing the janitorial work for and he always remembers it's for her and their family.  Terri finally tells Will she went to the OB/GYN, but she lies about the results and tells him that it's a boy.  Will is thrilled about the situation and Terri tells him that he needs to stop being a janitor; she decides to make the craft room into a nursery so that they don't need to move into the new house.\rAt school, Rachel discovers that her solo in \"Don't Stop Believin'\" has been given to Quinn because she went behind Will's back to promote sex during the assembly.  Although he admits his wrong-doings as well, both of them need to make the compromise.  While Rachel can't always be the star, he needs to make sure that she and everyone else are having fun.\rAs the episode ends, Rachel uses the auditorium to practice.  She sings Rihanna's \"Take a Bow\" with Tina and Mercedes on back-up vocals realizing that she needs to take a step back every once in a while to let others have the spotlight.  In the meantime, she watches Finn and Quinn together in the school's hallway. \n"}]}
