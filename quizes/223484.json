{"id": "223484", "name": "\"Star Trek III: The Search For Spock,\" Part 1 Quiz | Movies | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Star Trek"], "questions": [{"text": "This film opens with a sequence reminiscent of most of the \"Rocky\" sequels:  we're shown scenes from the previous film (in this case, 1982's \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\").  True or False: \"Star Trek III\" is the only one of the ten \"Star Trek\" movies to utilize this technique in the original, North American theatrical presentation.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tNone of the other nine \"Trek\" films opened in this way. \n"}, {"text": "In which category is Leonard Nimoy noted in the film's opening credits?", "correct": "director", "options": ["actor", "All of these", "co-writer"], "explanation": "\n\n\ndirector.\n\n\tIn the opening title sequence, Harve Bennett is given sole writing credit, and Nimoy is not listed as one of the producers.  And, even though he clearly appears in the film, Nimoy is not credited as an actor in the opening titles...probably to withhold the \"surprise\" that Spock would, by the end of the film, be fully resurrected.\r Nimoy is only named as the director of the film in the opening credits. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\" Kirk, Spock, and McCoy watched a presentation describing the Genesis Project.  The presentation was hosted by Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), an ex-lover of Kirk's.  In \"Star Trek III,\" Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) and members of his crew watch a very similar presentation.  Who hosts it?", "correct": "Kirk", "options": ["Dr. Carol Marcus", "an unnamed Federation scientist", "Dr. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKirk.\n\n\tKirk says exactly what Carol Marcus said in \"Star Trek II.\"  It's safe to assume that, since Bibi Besch wasn't in \"Star Trek III\", a decision was made to reshoot the Genesis lecture with a character who would actually be in the third film. \n"}, {"text": "When the battle-damaged ENTERPRISE pulls into Starbase 1 for repairs, we see Janice Rand, a character from the original \"Star Trek\" TV series, watching the starship ease into \"dock.\"  True or False: This is the first appearance of Janice Rand in a \"Trek\" movie.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tJanice Rand appeared briefly in \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture,\" the very first theatrical \"Trek\" film, released in 1979.  She would later appear in the fourth and sixth \"Trek\" movies, and in an episode of \"Star Trek: Voyager.\" \n"}, {"text": "As the ENTERPRISE crew eases through Starbase 1, they pass \"the great experiment,\" a new-fangled starship designated USS EXCELSIOR.  Most of the crew seems pretty impressed with the ship, but one character seems to hold it in comtempt.  Which character has a bad attitude about the EXCELSIOR?", "correct": "Montgomery Scott", "options": ["Nyota Uhura", "Hikaru Sulu", "Pavel Chekhov"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMontgomery Scott.\n\n\tScotty basically scoffs at the ship.  When Sulu mentions that the EXCELSIOR is supposed to have trans-warp drive, Scotty snips, \"Aye -- and if my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a wagon.\" \n"}, {"text": "What's the name of the admiral who informs Kirk and company that the ENTERPRISE will be retired from duty?", "correct": "Morrow", "options": ["Nogura", "Nechayev", "Cartwright"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorrow.\n\n\tRobert Hooks plays Admiral Morrow, who seems to be quite friendly with Jim Kirk in addition to being his superior officer.  (And before anyone gets jumpy to correct me here -- yes, they're both admirals, but it's pretty clear that Morrow is Kirk's supervisor.  In the bar where Kirk tries to get Morrow to let him go to the Genesis Planet, Morrow says, \"You're one of my best officers.\") \n"}, {"text": "What's the name of the science vessel to which Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis) and Dr. David Marcus have been reassigned sometime between the end of \"Star Trek II\" and the beginning of this film?", "correct": "USS GRISSOM", "options": ["USS ALDRIN", "USS ARMSTRONG", "USS SHEPARD"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUSS GRISSOM.\n\n\tPresumably named for Virgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom, one of the \"Mercury Seven\" astronauts. \n"}, {"text": "Kirk hosts a get-together for most of his command crew in his apartment in San Francisco.  What simple toast does he offer, once everyone has a beverage?", "correct": "\"Absent friends.\"", "options": ["\"To Spock.\"", "\"Smooth sailing.\"", "\"To the journey.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Absent friends.\"\n\n\tObviously a reference to Spock...and perhaps McCoy, who can't attend because he's in a psychiatric hospital! \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the crew never shows up at Kirk's little get-together?", "correct": "Montgomery Scott", "options": ["Pavel Chekhov", "Hikaru Sulu", "Nyota Uhura"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMontgomery Scott.\n\n\tSulu, Chekhov, and Uhura are present for the toast mentioned above.  Then, the doorbell rings, and Kirk says, \"Ah -- Mr. Scott.\"  He's wrong, though:  it's Ambassador Sarek at the door.  Sarek basically shoos the other guests out of Kirk's apartment, and he and Kirk have a private conversation.  Scotty never makes an appearance at all. \n"}, {"text": "Sarek (Mark Lenard) informs Kirk that Spock was trained to pass on his spiritual and intellectual \"spirit\" to another if he suspected that he was about to die.  What is the Vulcan word for this \"spirit\"?", "correct": "katra", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nkatra.\n\n\tSarek originally thought that Kirk was the keeper of Spock's \"katra,\" but it's McCoy who actually holds that dubious honor. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. McCoy (DeForrest Kelley) attends a moderately seedy bar in order to make a shady deal.  What can NOT be seen or heard in this bar?", "correct": "Orion dancing girls", "options": ["ancient video games", "synthesized \"elevator music\"", "Tribbles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrion dancing girls.\n\n\tWhen McCoy enters the bar, he sees two people playing what looks like a 3-D vector graphics video game depicting two 20th-century biplanes shooting at each other, as well as a couple playing with several Tribbles (the infamous \"fuzzballs\" from the original TV series) at their table.  Throughout the sequence, we're tortured with some truly awful cheesy synth music.\r No Orion girls in sight -- and they'd be easy to spot, given that they have green skin, wear very little, and generally sex up any scene they're in. \n"}, {"text": "When members of the command crew break Dr. McCoy out of the psych ward, Commander Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) acts as the muscle, subduing a security guard and throwing him across the room.  Finish his parting line to the semi-conscious guard:  \"Don't call me ___________.\"", "correct": "Tiny", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTiny.\n\n\tThe guard -- who stood a good 15 inches taller than Sulu! -- had called the diminutive Sulu \"Tiny\" a minute or two before.  Bad idea, I guess. \n"}, {"text": "Once McCoy has been liberated, Kirk informs Chekhov via communicator...but, since he doesn't want to mention the Genesis Planet over an open channel, he uses code to explain that the mission is proceeding as planned.  Finish Kirk's coded line to Chekhov:  \"The KOBAYASHI MARU has set sail for _________________________.\"", "correct": "the promised land", "options": ["El Dorado", "Never-Never Land", "Shangri-La"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe promised land.\n\n\tThe KOBAYASHI MARU bit is a reference to \"Star Trek II\" and the infamous no-win simulation that all Starfleet cadets must face before graduating. \n"}, {"text": "Commander Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) plays an integral part in Kirk's plan -- she has gotten herself assigned to a seemingly unimportant transporter post, from which she can provide Kirk and company a quick, quiet route aboard the ENTERPRISE.\n\nShe shares this post with an annoying, condescending lieutenant, on whom she pulls a phaser once Kirk's plan really gets rolling.  What nickname does Uhura give this young man?", "correct": "Mr. Adventure", "options": ["Mr. Perfect", "Mr. Excitement", "Mr. Wonderful"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Adventure\n\n\tWe never learn the real name of this young officer (played by Scott McGinnis) -- he is, in fact, called simply \"Mr. Adventure\" in the closing credits! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the commanding officer of the USS EXCELSIOR?", "correct": "Styles", "options": ["Terrell", "Esteban", "Foster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStyles.\n\n\tCaptain Styles is played by James B. Sikking, of \"Hill Street Blues\" and \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" fame.\r Captain Esteban was the C.O. of the ill-fated GRISSOM; Captain Terrell commanded the RELIANT until it was taken over by Khan in \"Star Trek II.\" \n"}]}
