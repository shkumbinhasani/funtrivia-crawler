The letter was to be taken to his uncle Ebenezer at the House of Shaws near Edinburgh. At the beginning of the book David lived in the Borders village of Essendean. \n"}, {"text": "On his way to the House of Shaws David comes across Jennet Clouston.

First he gives David a large sum of money and then asks him to climb the tower to get his \"old uncle\" a treasure chest.His clear meanness makes it plausible that he gives David no candle.

Friendship breaks the barriers between them. \n"}, {"text": "When David escapes from the shipwreck on to the islet of Earraid he lives a life of hunger, cold and damp for nearly five days.What fundamental mistake did he make?", "correct": "He didn't realise he could cross to the mainland when the tide was out.", "options": ["He didn't realise there was a boat on the island.", "He didn't know it was easy to find edible shellfish.", "He didn't attempt to make signals with his fire."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe didn't realise he could cross to the mainland when the tide was out.\n\n\tIf only he had started to think about it properly David would have realised that the channel between the islet and the mainland was passable when the tide was out.
