Which sport is it?", "correct": "Swimming", "options": ["Athletics", "Cycling", "Weightlifting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwimming.\n\n\tThe swimming events have changed and evolved from 1896 to the early 21st century. The 1896 agenda contained just a 100, 500, and 800 metre freestyle races (which were contested in the open Mediterranean Sea, and a 100 metre swim for sailors, the latter being only open to members of the Greek Royal Navy. The 1900, 1904, and 1912 swimming races were also held in open waters ( the 1904 St. Louis Olympics were the only Games to use yards instead of metres). The swimming programmes evolved from open-water to indoors, and from four events to seventeen by Beijing in 2008 and London four years later. \n"}, {"text": "This track race is considered to be the most-watched event of every Olympics, and it is one of the shortest!

Usain Bolt set a world record at those Olympics with a time of 9.69 seconds. \n"}, {"text": "This sport has been at every Summer Olympics (men), except 1896 and 1932; while women were added to the schedule in 1996.

The FA created a tournament for the 1908 Games in London, and the competition expanded from there. Large stadiums, sometimes hundreds of miles away from the host city, are used for the Olympic tournament, so they can seat 30-40,000 screaming fans. \n"}, {"text": "This sport, that was developed in Japan, entered the Olympic schedule in 1964 and uses terms such as ippon, shido, and yuko.

Women's races started out at 1000m, being upgraded to 2000m in 1988. The six-lane courses have only been standard since 1956; before that, races were run between as little as two to three boats. \n"}, {"text": "This sport was \"served\" up in Athens 1896, but was dropped in 1924, after the IOC feuded with this sport's governing body.

Since it was re-introduced in Los Angeles in 1984, it has been played on a clay court (Barcelona), a grass court (Wimbledon, London) and hard courts (the rest). The dispute between the IOC and International Tennis Federation over allowing amateurs to play in the Olympics led to the removal of tennis in 1924.

It didn't matter though, as Chinese athletes won gold and silver in both gender events, and gold in both team tournaments.It ran China's total to 24/28 gold medals after six Olympics.
