{"id": "1511", "name": "Who Killed Country Music? Quiz | Music Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", " Music Mixture", "Country Music"], "questions": [{"text": "First we need to figure out the setting of the murder. Which city is home to country music?", "correct": "Nashville", "options": ["Dallas", "Memphis", "New York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNashville.\n\n\tNow that you are in Nashville, Tennessee, let's get on with solving the crime. \n"}, {"text": "Now you will need some help in solving this murder, and who better then the two people who recorded the song 'Murder on Music Row'. Which two artists recorded this song?", "correct": "George Strait and Alan Jackson", "options": ["Clint Black and Garth Brooks", "George Jones and Dolly Parton", "Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Strait and Alan Jackson.\n\n\tOk, now you have your help. Let's get down to the suspects. If you have not heard this song, may I suggest that you get George Strait's newest greatest hits package and listen to it. 'Murder On Music Row' is a wonderful song and took a lot of nerve to record since it really puts down the people that are running Country Music these days. \n"}, {"text": "Suspect 1: Who sang the song 'Tonight The Heartache's On Me'?", "correct": "The Dixie Chicks", "options": ["Mary-Chapin Carpenter", "Garth Brooks", "Reba McEntire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dixie Chicks.\n\n\tAfter questioning the Dixie Chicks, we decided they were no longer a suspect in this crime, but they did become very nervous when we brought up the disappearance of 'Earl', but that is a different crime and we aren't on that case. The group is now called The Chicks. \n"}, {"text": "Suspect 2: Which artist performed a concert in New York's Central Park?", "correct": "Garth Brooks", "options": ["George Strait", "Steve Wariner", "Clint Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarth Brooks.\n\n\tGarth may have a big ego, but he's no killer. Therefore, he is off our suspect list. \n"}, {"text": "Suspect 3: Which artist recorded the song 'Breathe', which crossed over to the pop music chart?", "correct": "Faith Hill", "options": ["Lonestar", "Martina McBride", "Shania Twain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaith Hill.\n\n\tEven though Faith Hill has had some crossover success, she still has some roots in country and is not a suspect in the crime. She may however, be considered an accessory. \n"}, {"text": "Suspect 4: Which artist had their first country hit with 'Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under'?", "correct": "Shania Twain", "options": ["Martina McBride", "Faith Hill", "Terri Clark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShania Twain.\n\n\tYes, Shania is a suspect, does she really have talent or it is all production? As evidence of her talent being all production, I enter into evidence her first album, before Robert John Mutt Lange started producing her, this album is flat and shows she isn't as talented as her album sales have shown. \n"}, {"text": "Suspect 5: Who produced Shania Twain's albums up to 2007?", "correct": "Robert John Mutt Lange", "options": ["Tim Mcgraw", "Quincy Jones", "Tony Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert John Mutt Lange.\n\n\tHe remains a suspect because, he brought a 'rock' background into country music. Now that Shania is selling millions of records, everyone is trying to copy her style to sell records. \n"}, {"text": "Suspect 6: Why did country music radio not give a lot of air time to Vince Gill's song 'Kindly Keep it Country'?", "correct": "Too Country", "options": ["Too Loud", "Too Sugary", "Too Sexy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToo Country.\n\n\tLooks like we have a Prime Suspect!

Now instead of going by how good the song is, they go by how good you will look in a music video! \n"}, {"text": "So now that all the suspects have been questioned, which of the following will be charged with the crime?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Country Radio", "Robert John Mutt Lange", "Country Music Television"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tYes, all three of these suspects have something to do with the downfall of traditional country music. Remember this quiz is all in fun and I hope that no one takes it too personal if you don't agree with me, this quiz or the suspects. \n"}]}
