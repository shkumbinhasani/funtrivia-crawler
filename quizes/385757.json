Her first published novel, \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\", introduced one of her two enduring characters, the Belgian super-sleuth Hercule Poirot. Poirot would appear in 33 novels, one play and more than 50 short stories before his final case, \"Curtain\", which was written in the 1940s but not published until shortly before the author's death in January 1976.\r Also published in 1920 were the three alternatives, plus Colette's \"Ch\u00e9ri\", John Galsworthy's \"In Chancery\", Sinclair Lewis's classic novel \"Main Street\", Marcel Proust's \"The Guermantes Way\" and Edith Wharton's Pulitzer-winning \"The Age of Innocence\". \n"}, {"text": "1921: This adventure story brings together two of the most popular characters created by the author who pioneered the 'Lost World' literary genre.

Rider Haggard)\n\n\tSir Henry Rider Haggard KBE was born in 1856 in the village of Bradenham in central Norfolk. A novelist and fabulist, his works are mostly-situated at the lighter end of the spectrum of Victorian-era literature. \r \"She and Allan\" serves as a prequel to the author's 1887 novel \"She: A History of Adventure\", whilst the main protagonist is Allan Quatermain, the hero of his classic 1885 fable \"King Solomon's Mines\". The plot is driven by Quatermain's quest to communicate with deceased loved ones. A feared Zulu witch doctor tells him of \"a great white sorceress who rules a hidden kingdom far to the north\", and so begins the quest to find Ayesha. \r Also published in 1921 were the three alternatives, plus Edgar Rice Burroughs's \"Tarzan the Terrible\", John Galsworthy's \"To Let\" (the last book in the \"Forsyte Saga\" trilogy), Rafael Sabatini's \"Scaramouche\", Baroness Orczy's \"The First Sir Percy\" and Booth Tarkington's \"Alice Adams\". \n"}, {"text": "1922: Set 20 years into the future (so 1943), this debut novel by the author who coined the term 'robot' describes the transformational effect on society of virtually free energy.

The invention of a reactor that provides cheap and abundant energy also produces an unfortunate by-product, the 'absolute', a spiritual essence that is associated with human religious experience.
