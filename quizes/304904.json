He would be paid 17,000 of what?", "correct": "Credits", "options": ["Studs", "Billibotchkas", "Dollars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCredits.\n\n\tThere is no such thing as a billibotchka.  I made that up.  Ben Kenobi told Han that he would be pay thousands of credits to Han if he flew them where they needed to go.  After much arguing, Ben raised it to a total of 17,000 credits, which Han accepted.  After a while, however, Han Solo learned it wasn't about the money. \n"}, {"text": "According to the \"Star Wars\" official website, what is the name of the medal given to Han Solo at the end of \"Star Wars IV: A New Hope\"?", "correct": "Alderaanian Medal of Freedom", "options": ["Alderaanian Medal of Saviors", "Alderaanian Medal of Bravery", "Alderaanian Medal of Heroic and Noble Deeds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlderaanian Medal of Freedom.\n\n\tThe Alderaanian Medal of Freedom was given to both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, along with a hefty reward, for aiding in the destruction of the Death Star and sending Darth Vader spiraling out into space.  This was quite an honor for any man, but Han Solo deserved it for his bravery.  After all, he had to save Luke from sure death!  He grew to like that \"kid.\" \n"}, {"text": "For much of Han Solo's youth, who did he work for?  This is, again, according to the \"Star Wars\" offical website.", "correct": "Garris Shrike", "options": ["Anton LaVey", "Boris Anchovy", "Darth Revan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarris Shrike.\n\n\tGarris Shrike was a smuggler that Han spent much time with as a young boy.  Han grew up on the Trader's Luck, a smuggling ship Garris Shrike owned.  Han, being raised by a smuggler, was able to learn much about smuggling.  This affected his later life, and he became a smuggler himself.  This caused him to go into great debt.  Although he spent much time with Shrike, he was raised by a Wookiee named Dewlanna.  This is what caused him to become friends with Chewbacca.  He became close to Wookiees and became a close friend to many, including his best pal, who he rescued from death, Chewbacca. \n"}, {"text": "Jabba the Hutt sent out loads of bounty hunters throughout the galaxy to locate Han Solo.  Which of these was NOT a bounty hunter who was sent to find Han?", "correct": "8D8", "options": ["Bossk", "4-LOM", "IG-88"], "explanation": "\n\n\n8D8.\n\n\tThe bounty hunters sent to find Han Solo included Dengar, Bossk, IG-88, 4-LOM and, of course, Boba Fett.  Boba, in pursuit of Han Solo, was the son of Jango Fett, another bounty hunter.  Of course, this brings us a very well known quote by Boba in the \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" which is; \"He is no good to me dead.\"  Bounty hunters that did NOT chase Han, but did appear in other movies and books include Jango Fett, Zam Wessel, Greedo, Aurra Sing, and Zuckuss.  Of course, not all these bounty hunters are from the movies.  Bounty hunters were murderous creatures of all races, including human, like Boba and Jango Fett, droid, like IG-88, and all sorts of aliens, like Greedo.\r The list of all bounty hunters can be found at Wikipedia under Star Wars characters, and it will specifically tell you which ones were in pursuit of Han, and which ones were not.  You can also find this information in the \"Star Wars\" website list of characters under bounty hunters. \n"}, {"text": "When Han Solo was on the moon of Endor, with the Ewoks, which Ewok seemed to be quite fond of Han?", "correct": "Wicket", "options": ["Kalmyk", "Logray", "Burtt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWicket.\n\n\tWhile both Wicket and Logray were Ewoks, Wicket W. Warrick was the one who seemed to have a special bond with Han.  Wicket was the curious Ewok we first met when Leia fell off her speeder, in a chase with Luke to follow the troopers.  She fell off, and Wicket was there to investigate her.  When she took off her helmet, he was quite frightened, but he learned it was just a hat. He took Leia to the village, up in the trees, where she was kept safe until rescued by Luke and Han.  Wicket took a quick liking to Han.  Wicket W. Warrick was a play on the name of the man who played him.  His name was Warwick. Ben Burtt was the creator of the Ewok language, known as Ewokese.  He fashioned it out of an ancient Chinese language.  There are over 150,000 speakers of the language in China and Mongolia today.  This language is known as Kalmyk.  It can also be called Kalmuck, Calmouk, Qalmac, Kalmytskii Jalyk, or Western Mongol. \n"}, {"text": "Han Solo once went under a different name.  What was this name?  This is, once more, according to the \"Star Wars\" official website.", "correct": "Vyyk Drago", "options": ["Spin Dragon", "Bill Nye", "Garden Hose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVyyk Drago.\n\n\tSolo was only 19 at the time.  He began working for the Hutts, the species that Jabba was.  He helped in a spice operation.  When he fell in love and destroyed the operation, the only thing that kept him alive was the fact he was not found.  This is because he was no longer Vyyk Drago, but became Han Solo once more. \n"}, {"text": "Many know that Han Solo was able to receive the Millenium Falcon from Lando Calrissian.  Han reminded Lando in the movies how he was able to receive the Millenium Falcon from him.  But do you know exactly how Han Solo got the ship?  ", "correct": "Lando bet the Millenium Falcon on a game of sabacc, which Han won.", "options": ["Lando bet the Millenium Falcon on a game of parchisi, which Han won.", "Lando bet the Millenium Falcon that Han would win the Kessel Run, which he did.", "Lando bet the Millenium Falcoln on a game of barslak, which he won."], "explanation": "\n\n\nLando bet the Millenium Falcon on a game of sabacc, which Han won.\n\n\tHan Solo first won the ship after winning a game of sabacc.  He then went on to use the ship during the Kessel Run. Han Solo won the Kessel Run using the Millenium Falcon.  According to Han Solo, he was able to complete the Kessel Run in under twelve parsecs.  While Lando loved the ship, Han grew to love it even more.  It was his baby, and he refurbished it to become an even more beautiful ship.  He was very protective of it.  He had to let Lando borrow it, but told him not to get a scratch on her.  \rWe were told about this game of sabacc in \"Episode Six\" when Lando needed to borrow the ship.  When they were talking about not getting a scratch on the ship, Han reminded Lando that it was his now, that he won it fair and square in the game of sabacc.  After a brief argument, they were off once more to defeat the Death Star for good. \n"}, {"text": "George Lucas took several attempts to get Han Solo just right.  Several drafts were made before the decision was final.  What was Han Solo originally to look like?  This is according to the \"Star Wars\" official website.", "correct": "Big green alien with no nose and huge gills", "options": ["Corellian pirate with a heavy beard", "Han Solo was originally not part of the movies.", "He was always a smuggler and pilot."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig green alien with no nose and huge gills.\n\n\tGeorge Lucas first had him as a fat alien with no nose, and gills.  It resembled a chupacabra-fish-creature-thing.  He somehow transformed into a fat pirate with a huge beard.  He was then developed into what we see on screen.  George Lucas didn't want to use Harrison Ford at first, as he did not like using the same actors for any of his movies.  He finally settled on Harrison Ford when he realized he was the perfect match.  He sure didn't stay true to his word when he cast Harrison Ford AGAIN for Indiana Jones! \n"}, {"text": "When Han Solo was in charge of heading to Endor to destroy the shield, he still needed to find a crew.  Chewbacca joined in, since Han didn't speak for him right away, then Leia joined in.  Luke returned from Dagobah and joined him, too.  On their way to the moon of Endor, who complained to Han about the stolen spacecraft?", "correct": "Chewbacca", "options": ["C-3PO", "Leia Organa", "Luke Skywalker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChewbacca.\n\n\tChewbacca complained that he was too big for the Imperial Shuttle.  Han reasoned with him that the Evil Empire probably didn't have Wookiees in mind when they designed the spacecract.  Although C-3PO was quite the complainer, this was one time he didn't complain!  Han Solo and his crew successfully made it to Endor and completed their mission. \n"}, {"text": "Bounty hunters loved to kill.  They always carried thermal detonators with them.  It was a trademark of being a bounty hunter.  Was this fact true or false: \"Han Solo was a bounty hunter\"?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOf course this was false!  Although bounty hunters WERE killers, and they DID carry thermal detonators with them, this statement was false.  Why?  To put it quite simply, Han Solo was not a bounty hunter.  He was a smuggler.  Bounty hunters were evil, and Han was far from evil.  Although he did smuggle, which didn't necessarily make him a great guy, he still wasn't evil!  Han Solo even killed two bounty hunters throughout his journey.  He killed Greedo, intentionally, while talking to him about Jabba, and Boba Fett, accidentally, outside of Jabba's palace.\r Much of this information is speculation.  What I mean by that is that some of these parts did not appear in the movies, although George Lucas has agreed with many aspects of Han Solo's past life.  To him, it seems fitting that this would be what Han's past was like.  Therefore, although some facts did not appear in the movie, they are considered to be true facts.\r Information can be found at Wikipedia and the \"Star Wars\" official website. \n"}]}
