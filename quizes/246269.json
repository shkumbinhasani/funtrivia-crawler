What character did Henry dress up as for the festivities?", "correct": "King Neptune", "options": ["Attila the Hun", "Hercules", "Napoleon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKing Neptune.\n\n\tHenry's costume was perfectly acceptable, or so he explains in a letter to his superiors.  He was completely covered from the waist down, including the entire pelvic area.  Imagine the horror of Henry's 'nudidity' (a Radarism, if you didn't know) from the waist up! \n"}, {"text": "While constructing a letter to his superiors explaining the Mardi Gras activities, Henry uses what word(s) that Radar needs clarification on, spelling-wise?", "correct": "Belly button", "options": ["Bacchanalia", "Fuddy-duddy", "Dionysian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBelly button.\n\n\tApparently, Henry's costume also included a rhinestone in his belly button.  Radar wants clarification here as to whether 'belly button' is one word or two, to which Henry replies, 'Radar, the good lord gave us one belly, and one button for said belly.  Therefore, it's two words.' \n"}, {"text": "The next crisis, if it may be called that, arrives in the form of a certain Private Baker, who is accompanied into Henry's office by two M.P.'s.  It seems that Baker has gone AWOL once again, much to Henry's extreme annoyance.  Incidentally, what is Private Baker's first name?", "correct": "Daniel", "options": ["Bruce", "Cecil", "Herman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaniel.\n\n\tDanny Baker has made a habit of going AWOL over the past several weeks, and Henry has no idea why.  Obviously, Henry hasn't taken a look at Danny's enormous hooter! \n"}, {"text": "Henry has the brilliant idea (well, really Radar has the idea) of sending Private Baker to see Father Mulcahy.  The assumption is that Baker has some emotional or spiritual problem, and the good Father may be of assistance.  Not long after meeting Mulcahy, the truth comes out, it's Baker's enormous nose.  Mulcahy suggests that Baker is simply made in God's image.  Baker responds that God must have a nose the size of...?", "correct": "Texas", "options": ["The Moon", "A rhinoceros", "A watermelon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTexas.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy attempts to console Baker about his nose, telling him that 'We're all made in God's image.'  A skeptical Danny responds, 'Then God must have a schnozz the size of Texas!'  \r Father Mulcahy identifies the next step, talk to Hawkeye and Trapper.  While leaving his tent, Mulcahy marks his place in the Bible.  'The jawbone of an ass,' he quips. \n"}, {"text": "Mulcahy enlists the help of Trapper and Hawkeye in helping to solve Baker's nasal dilemma.

During that time, what did Hawkeye call Robbins?", "correct": "Stosh", "options": ["Buzz", "Ace", "Philo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStosh.\n\n\tMajor Stanley Robbins is played magnicently in this episode by Stuart Margolin, who you may recall from an earlier 'M*A*S*H' episode, namely 'Bananas, Crackers and Nuts' from season one, where he played a character named Captain Dr. Mandel Sherman. \n"}, {"text": "In order to entice Stanley Robbins to come to the 4077th, Hawkeye convinces his good friend that there is a very aggressive nurse waiting for him.  By what 'fishy' name does Hawkeye refer to this nurse?", "correct": "The Barracuda", "options": ["The Piranha", "The Tiger Shark", "The Moray Eel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Barracuda.\n\n\tStanley Robbins has no intention of coming to Korea until Hawkeye sweetens the deal by conjuring up this fictional 'Barracuda'.  Using this fabricated nurse as bait, he is able to reel Robbins in. \n"}, {"text": "When Major Robbins arrives at the 4077th, everyone is dually impressed, including Henry who attempts to pry information out of the Major.  Henry asks Robbins about his work on Hollywood stars, but the Major is hesistant to reveal any info.  When Henry asks Robbins to just give him initials, Robbins replies 'S.S.'.  Which of these is not one of Henry's futile guesses as to what the S.S. stands for?", "correct": "Sara Stokes", "options": ["Sylvia Sidney", "Slim Summerville", "Sid Caesar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSara Stokes.\n\n\tHenry is desperate to learn about the work done by this 'Surgeon to the Stars', and throws out these ridiculous and futile guesses, including 'Sid Caesar'.  For the record, Sylvia Sidney, Slim Summervilel and Sid Caesar are all real people. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret and Frank are just as impressed as Henry about Major Robbins, with Margaret a bit more impressed than her lunkhead lover.  Robbins seems even more excited about Margaret than she is about him.  What feature on Margaret's face gets the most attention from the Major?", "correct": "Jowls", "options": ["Ears", "Forehead", "Eyelids"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJowls.\n\n\tMajor Robbins insists that Margaret has the 'jowls of a goddess', and offers to work on her face.  Margaret seems rather taken aback, but flattered nonetheless.  As they part, Robbins insists she contact him.  'Just leave the message 'jowls', I'll know,' he says. \n"}, {"text": "In order to create a ruse so that Frank and Hot Lips won't know what is happening, Hawkeye and Trapper instruct Radar to fake an injury.  In what sport is Radar engaged when he suddenly 'hurts' his nose?", "correct": "Baseball", "options": ["Football", "Golf", "Basketball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaseball.\n\n\tNot really a baseball game, per se, but rather just a nice game of catch with a baseball does the trick.  With Frank and Margaret looking on, Radar takes a throw from Trapper that apparently impacts his face.  He is rushed into the O.R. and Major Robbins is summoned.  Despite this elaborate set-up, the brilliant Majors Burns and Houlihan are still suspicious. \n"}, {"text": "Do Frank and Margaret ever find out who has really been operated on?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tA happy ending for all.  Baker gets his nosejob, Stosh bags the Barracuda and Radar makes a miraculous recovery from his terrible baseball injury.  When Frank and Margaret storm out of Radar's office after seeing the lad fully recovered, they notice that practically everyone in the camp wears a piece of white tape over their nose.  Trapper and Hawkeye are simply too clever.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
