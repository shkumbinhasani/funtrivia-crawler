Based on a book by John Steakley, it ended up reaching the top of the box office, the first of Carpenter's films to do so in a decade (since \"They Live\" in 1988).  His subsequent releases were considered box office bombs and flops, but he would find renewed audiences on TV's \"Masters of Horror\"; his \"Pro-Life\" episode would tackle abortion specifically, and partly take into account the religious argument behind it. \n"}, {"text": "What 2001 movie starring and directed by actor Bill Paxton involved a man's alleged calling to murder people embodying sins and demons?", "correct": "Frailty", "options": ["End of Days", "Se7en", "The Reaping"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrailty.\n\n\tOddly underrated, \"Frailty\" didn't strike gold in the box office but ended up being a noteworthy horror-thriller in the early 2000s.

Over the course of the film, Marcus debunked his exorcism procedures but discovered that perhaps something was amiss out on the farm.  The movie was filmed with a handicam as though it were a documentary following his final exorcism.  The movie received a sequel in 2013; due to poor awareness of the movie, it only grossed $15,000,000.

Up until that point, the movie followed Isabella Rossi as she traveled to Rome to meet with her institutionalized mother who, possessed by many demons, sparked murders, additional possessions, and hi-jinx in Italy's capital. The movie was, like many of the time, shot in the found-footage style. \n"}]}
