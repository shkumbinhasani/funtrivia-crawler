Online Quiz | Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", " Sports Mixed"], "questions": [{"text": "I was flipping through TV channels when something caught my eye. Someone was standing on the grass, motionless. After a few moments, he slightly tapped a little ball, and in a few moments more, it up and disappeared! Turns out, it fell on a hole, which was apparently a good thing. Well, that's my view, anyway!\n\nWhile watching this sport, I kept hearing of a certain article of clothing around the \"green\".  Which article of clothing may be associated with this particular sport?", "correct": "Apron", "options": ["Fedora", "Skirt", "Dress"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApron.\n\n\tThe apron is the area of ground that separates the green with the rough; the apron is also called fringe.  This \"apron\" appears in the sport of golf, which was described in the question.\r Golf was invented in Scotland, and originally stood for \"Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden\". Of course, over time, ladies were allowed to play. What I saw on TV was someone using a putter to hit the golf ball into the hole. It takes a bit of time to get that perfect shot, which is perhaps why I thought he was just standing there! \n"}, {"text": "I was watching what seemed to be hundreds of people swimming, and I assumed I was watching some sort of swimming competition.  As they arrived on shore, as swimmers were exhausted, I thought for sure it was over, but no winner was declared.  Instead, everyone kept moving and hopped on their bikes.  After riding for what seemed like forever, I thought for sure that was it, but they left their bikes and ran the rest of the way.\n\nThe sport I am watching is an Ironman Triathlon.  The sport originated in which state of the USA, where a world competition is held every year?", "correct": "Hawaii", "options": ["Alaska", "Kentucky", "Rhode Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawaii.\n\n\tThe Ironman Triathlon World Championship is held once a year in Hawaii; the first of such races was in 1978.  The Ironman is a triathlon competition that takes up to 17 hours to complete (it cuts off at this time regardless, so if not completed in under this time, players do not get to finish).  It begins with a swim just shy of two and a half miles. When the swim is over, players move immediately on to a 112 mile long bicycle ride, and finally finish with a regular marathon (26.2 miles).  This physically draining triathlon begins at 7 in the morning, and does not end until midnight, with competitors moving virtually nonstop during that long time period! \n"}, {"text": "As I watched the two competitors in funny white outfits, I could not help but laugh.  Paired with their strange get up, they stood funny, too.  One hand was in the air and behind them, and their legs were far apart.  Both were holding what appeared to be little swords, and they were trying to jab each other with the tip.  I don't know what the sport is called, so that was my view, anyway!\n\nThe sport above uses three different swords.  Which sword is not used?", "correct": "Rapier", "options": ["Sabre", "Foil", "Epee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRapier.\n\n\tFencing involves two players, both wearing protective clothing (you don't want to stab someone with a sword without any gear, after all). The funny standing position turned out to be their \"stance\", and the \"jabbing\" was their parrying and blocking.  The goal of fencing is to get a clean stab to your opponent, and the first to a certain score wins (typically three).  The three weapons used in fencing are the sabre, epee, and foil. \n"}, {"text": "Two players, two little paddles, a small playing surface, a net, and a little ball.  My neck began to hurt as I watched the little ball go back and forth and incredible speeds across the wooden surface.  The net was small, so it couldn't possibly be tennis; it wasn't even on a full court.  Hey, I know, this reminds me of \"Forrest Gump\".  Oh, what was the sport called?\n\nThere are typically two different ways to hold the racket in the sport above.  One of these is the penhold, and the other is called what?", "correct": "Shakehold", "options": ["Tellerhold", "Paperhold", "Leftiehold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShakehold.\n\n\tPing pong, also known as table tennis, is played on a flat surface at about the height of the hip (so, like a table).  The little hollow ball is hit back and forth, using paddles; the goal is to hit it back to your opponent so they cannot return it.  If you succeed, this results in a point.  The first to a certain score wins (and this score is typically 21).  The two ways to hold the racket are penhold and shakehold. The penhold is so named because you hold the racket similar to the way you would hold a pen, and the shakehold is named this way because you hold the racket in the same way as you would if you were shaking someone's hand. \n"}, {"text": "This sport seems a little odd.  I see a person standing on a flexible plank high above a tiny little pool.  They bounce up and down, and suddenly fling themselves into the air and fall into the water.  This seems odd, because they seem to be afraid of the water; almost as soon as they hit they are seen at the ladder emerging from the depths of the pool and exiting the water.  Wait, there were two of them!  That's my view, anyway, of the sport.\n\nWhile watching those performers, I heard of three different \"moves\".  Which of these is the easiest of those moves?", "correct": "Tuck", "options": ["Butterfly", "Straight", "Pike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTuck.\n\n\tSynchronized diving is a sport where two people both dive into a pool as uniformly as they possibly can.  A perfect dive will look like a single person diving, and there will be a very little amount of splash as both the athletes hit the water.  Diving perfectly into the pool after performing a trick is difficult enough; but for both people to do the same routine as identical as possible just makes it that much more challenging. The three main dive positions, from easiest to hardest, are tuck, pike, and straight.  The straight dive is one where no bend occurs in the knees or hips.  The pike involves a bend in the hip, but straight legs. The tuck is when the diver is in a ball, holding onto their shins (so both the hip and the knees are bent. \n"}, {"text": "I've played the sport on the Wii before, but I had never seen it on TV.  I watched as the player took their time to step carefully towards the long roadway, stopped, posed, and thrust the ball forward to hit the ten bobble-heads at the other end of the roadway.  After doing this three times, three x's were awarded, and somehow poultry became involved.  I'm not sure what was going on, but that was my view, anyway.\n\nOf course, after getting another x, you get a hambone.  Five will get you a Yahtzee, and six (and up) will be called what?", "correct": "Bagger", "options": ["Bugger", "Beggar", "Bigger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBagger.\n\n\tBowling; the game of knocking down ten pins with a heavy ball.  The ball has three holes, typically; two for fingers and one for a thumb.  Players roll this ball down the lane (not a roadway) to hit as many of the pins over as possible.  If all ten fall down in the first ball of a frame, a strike is awarded. Three strikes in a row is called a \"turkey\" (thus the mysterious poultry).  A fourth strike in a row is called a hambone, and five in a row is called dropping a nickel, or a Yahtzee.  After that, each successive strike is called a pack or a bagger.  Thus, six strikes is a six-pack or six-bagger, seven strikes is a seven-pack or seven-bagger, etc. A perfect game, and a score of 300, will only be reached if a player gets 12 strikes in a row (a 12-pack or 12-bagger). \n"}, {"text": "Me, as the sports know-nothing that I am, cannot figure out what I am watching.  I thought I had just changed the channel to the tail end of some sport, and they were simply cleaning up with their brooms, but the chanting crowd had me thinking otherwise.  The large ball, I thought, was polishing the ice, and I thought the two just before the \"polisher\" were simply sweeping the dirt away before polishing.  That's my view, anyway!\n\nIn the sport mentioned above, what is the \"ball\" really called?", "correct": "Stone", "options": ["Sheet", "Ball", "Brick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStone.\n\n\tCurling is played with a large, polished granite stone (also called a rock) and a few brooms.  The object is to thrust this heavy stone towards a target (the house), getting as many points as possible.  A few additional players to the team use those brooms to brush the ice in front of the curling stone. They are not actually sweeping dirt; the broom melts the ice just enough to get the stone where it needs to be, and prevents it from curling too much.  An odd sport, perhaps, but pretty fun. \n"}, {"text": "There is one sport I know a bit about, and that is baseball.  I turned the TV on to watch a game, and was astounded by how many rules I did not realize there were!  Of course, upon closer inspection, I realized I was not watching baseball at all.  The \"stump\" really did just that; it stumped me.  I no longer knew what I was watching, because it certainly wasn't baseball!\n\nI kept hearing of what I thought was an Ewok...  Which of these words may be heard in a game as described above?", "correct": "Wicket", "options": ["Picket", "Licket", "Ticket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWicket.\n\n\tCricket is similar to baseball in that it is considered a bat-and-ball game.  In fact, some basic rules of both cricket and baseball are the same; one team, who is at bat, tries to score as many runs as possible, while the other team tries to prevent this from happening.  Both games are divided into innings (in baseball, the singular is \"inning\", but in cricket, the singular is \"innings\").\r The wicket is a little fence made of three stumps and two balls.  While at bat, it is the batsman's goal not to let the ball hit the wicket.\rP.S. Wicket is also the name of an Ewok from \"Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi\". \n"}, {"text": "I watched on TV someone perform what they called a \"900\".  I wasn't sure what that meant, but I kept watching them do all sorts of flips and tricks on that tiny wheeled board.  I couldn't figure out how they didn't fall off, or how that board remained on their feet, but perhaps that's just because I'm a sports newbie.\n\nWhich of these is a type of trick that the above sport uses?", "correct": "Nollie", "options": ["Floater", "Slalom", "Slurpee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNollie.\n\n\tSkateboarding is a sport that involves doing tricks on ramps and bars; including ollies and nosegrabs.  An ollie is jumping with the skateboard's front wheel's leaving the ground first; when the back two leave the ground first it is called a nollie.  The 900 is a special trick developed by Tony Hawk; the number represents the degrees turned in a single flip.  A 180, then, means the flip goes through a half circle.  A 360 is a full rotation of the board, and a 720 is two full rotations of the board.  A 900, then, is a very daring and difficult flip of two and a half complete rotations of the skateboard!  Certainly not an easy task.\r Slalom refers to skiing, a slurpee is a wakeboarding move, and floater is a surfing trick. \n"}, {"text": "I watched as four people whacked a ball back and forth over a net; one team got a point for slamming the ball over the net with great force.  Later in the game, I saw someone trip in the sand, or so I thought.  The ball went flying, and they got up.  It turns out they were \"diving\".  I don't know what sport this is.\n\nWhich of these athletes played the sport mentioned above?", "correct": "Misty May-Treanor", "options": ["Mia Hamm", "Steffi Graf", "Florence Joyner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMisty May-Treanor.\n\n\tThe sport was volleyball, and when the ball was slammed into the ground, that was a spike.  The player, then, did not trip, but instead was diving to hit the ball to keep it in the game.\r Misty May-Treanor, born in 1977, was a professional volleyball player.  She retired after the 2012 Olympics in London.  She won three gold medals for beach volleyball; the first in 2004, then 2008, and 2012.  Her and her partner, Kerri Walsh, were notorious for never losing a game, and hardly ever losing even a single set. \n"}]}
