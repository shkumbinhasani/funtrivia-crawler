{"id": "219191", "name": "\"Super Mario 64\" Stages 13-15 Quiz | Super Mario 64 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Mario Games", "Super Mario 64"], "questions": [{"text": "How many Piranha Plants are fought in the first task on \"Tiny-Huge Island\"?", "correct": "Five", "options": ["Four", "Six", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive.\n\n\tIn the task 'Pluck the Piranha Flower' in the \"Tiny Huge Island\" stage, you need to either cross to the piranha plant area of the level while you're big, then shrink using the pipe, or you must circle the entire island while you're small.  Once there, all you need to do is punch the five flowers while you're small, and you'll get the star.  Watch out though, the flowers can shoot fire and bite at you. \n"}, {"text": "How many stars in \"Tiny-Huge Island\" are claimed while Mario is small?", "correct": "Five & 5", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive & 5.\n\n\t'Pluck the Piranha Flower', 'The Tip Top of Tiny-Huge Island, 'Rematch with Koopa the Quick', 'Wiggler's Red Coins', and 'Make Wiggler Squirm' are all completed while Mario is small.  The only one where Mario is big, is the 'Five Itty Bitty Secrets' task.  In it, you must find five small holes in order for a star to appear on a floating platform. \n"}, {"text": "How many stars are obtained within the mountain in \"Tiny-Huge Island\"?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["None", "One", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\t'Wiggler's Red Coins', and 'Make Wiggler Squirm' are both within the mountain, and both have something to do with Wiggler.  In 'Wiggler's Red Coins', you must shoot yourself to a part of the island and walk a narrow bridge into the mountain where you can collect eight red coins.  In 'Make Wiggler Squirm', you must ground pound the top of the mountain when you are big, then go inside when you're small to fight Wiggler for a star. \n"}, {"text": "For everything inside of \"Tick Tock Clock\" to stop moving, what must the minute hand be pointed at in the picture entrance?", "correct": "12", "options": ["3", "10", "7"], "explanation": "\n\n\n12.\n\n\tBy landing on the 12, the clock will completely stop, and although you won't be able to reach the top half of the level, you can still get the red coin star and the first two stars much easier.  If you have the minute hand land on other times, the clock will slow down or speed up. \n"}, {"text": "How many stars in \"Tick Tock Clock\" are found within cages?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Five", "Three", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tStar #1, 'Roll into the Cage', and Star #5, 'Timed Jumps on Moving Bars', are both found within cages.  The first star is found in the lower half of the level, so even if time is stopped, it should be easy to reach.  The other star requires the clock to be moving since it's in the top half of the level. \n"}, {"text": "Can any Whomps be found in \"Tick Tock Clock\"?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhomps can't be found, but Thwomps can.  Only one Thwomp can be found, and it's near the top of the level.  In Star #4, 'Stomp on the Thwomp', you must let the clock move, and you have to reach the top of the clock.  Once there, you have to climb onto a Thwomp to reach the platform holding the star.  Watch out though; if you fall, it's a long way down. \n"}, {"text": "How many 'Tricky Triangles' are there in the 'Tricky Triangles!' task in \"Rainbow Ride\"?", "correct": "Nine & 9", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine & 9.\n\n\tThe 'Tricky Triangles' task will get you Star #5.  To get to the star, you have to flatten the big purple switch and race over top of the triangles.  Nearby, you can also get Star #4, 'Swingin' in the Breeze', which is somewhat quicker to get since it's closer to the start of the level. \n"}, {"text": "Where can you find the Pink Bob-omb's cannon in \"Rainbow Ride\"?", "correct": "On the ship", "options": ["In the house", "Near the starting point", "On the maze"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn the ship.\n\n\tThe Pink Bob-omb in this level can be found in the level below the top of the maze, so you have to wall jump plenty of times to reach him.  On the way, you also have the chance to pick up a bunch of blue coins.  To get to the cannon, you need to take a few magic carpets to the floating ship.  The cannon is crucial in obtaining star #6, 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'. \n"}, {"text": "How many magic carpets can be found in \"Rainbow Ride\" (excluding regenerated ones)?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Five", "Three", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tAll of these carpets will either take you to destinations containing a star or they will take you to more carpets.  One will take you to the large house, and one will take you to the ship.  In the house, be sure to avoid the fireplace as much as possible because it shoots a jet of fire.  Along the way, make sure to avoid the obstacles (why'd they put those there in the first place? :P). \n"}, {"text": "During the final battle with Bowser, the ground on the battlefield will break away.  What shape does it form after it does this?", "correct": "Star", "options": ["Mushroom", "Coin", "Fire Flower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar.\n\n\tTo defeat Bowser, you have to use the same tactics as before; catch him by the tail, and throw him into the mines.  After two throws, the ground will break away into a star, and you'll need to throw him a further distance to hit the mines.  After three throws, Princess Peach will be saved!  If you have all 120 stars, the cannon outside the castle will open, and you can find Yoshi on the roof. :) \n"}]}
