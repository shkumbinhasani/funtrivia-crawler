Alvin and the Chipmunks sang this classic holiday tune. The phrase \"We've been good, but we can't last...\" contains the conjunction \"but\". A conjunction is a word which connects two phrases or clauses. Examples of the most common conjunctions in the English language are \"and\", \"so\", and \"but\". \n"}, {"text": "In the song \"Let It Snow\", which one of these phrases is an example of the passive voice?", "correct": "\"The lights are turned way down low...\"", "options": ["\"But if you really hold me tight...\"", "\"When we finally say good-night...\"", "\"Oh, the weather outside is frightful...\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The lights are turned way down low...\"\n\n\t\"Let It Snow\" was written in 1945 by Sammy Cohn and Jule Styne. \"The lights are turned way down low...\" is an example of the passive voice. The passive voice is constructed by using a form of the verb \"be\", plus a past participle of the main verb. The passive form is used when the object of a sentence is more important than the person or thing that is doing the action. The other three phrases in this question are examples of the active voice. The song \"Let It Snow\" was featured in the 1988 film \"Die Hard.\" \n"}, {"text": "The song \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" ends with the line, \"Everyone dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way.\" Which part of speech is \"merrily\"?", "correct": "An adverb", "options": ["A verb", "An adjective", "A preposition"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn adverb.\n\n\tJohnny Marks composed \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" in 1958, and this song became a big U.S. hit for Brenda Lee in 1960.

Most adverbs in English end in \"-ly\" or \"-ily.\" An adjective is a word which describes a noun. \n"}, {"text": "In the song \"Deck the Halls\", which one of these phrases is not an example of the imperative mood?", "correct": "\"'Tis the season to be jolly...\"", "options": ["\"Deck the halls with boughs of holly...\"", "\"Strike the harp and join the chorus...\"", "\"Hail the new year, lads and lasses...\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"'Tis the season to be jolly...\"\n\n\tThe classic holiday song \"Deck the Halls\" is several hundred years old. Most of the lyrics in the English version of this tune are examples of the imperative mood: a form which gives a command or a request. The imperative form normally uses a simple (base) verb form; the subject word \"you\" is not used. \"'Tis the season to be jolly\" is a sentence in the indicative mood, as it translates to, \"It's the season to be jolly.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these Christmas song titles has an example of the superlative form of adjectives?", "correct": "\"It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year\"", "options": ["\"Blue Christmas\"", "\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\"", "\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year\".\n\n\t\"It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" was composed in 1963 by Eddie Pola and George Wyle.

The superlative form of adjectives normally consists of the words \"the most\" or the suffix \"-est / -iest\" in combination with an adjective. The superlative form is used when we are viewing the extreme of three or more people/things in a group. An example of the superlative form would be, \"Santa Claus is the nicest and the most generous man in the world.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling...\" Which verb tense is being used in this line from the song \"Sleigh Ride\"?", "correct": "The present continuous (progressive)", "options": ["The present perfect", "The past", "The future"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe present continuous (progressive).\n\n\tLeroy Anderson finished composing the song \"Sleigh Ride\" in the late 1940s, and Mitchell Parish added lyrics in 1950. In the U.S., Johnny Mathis' version of this song is probably the most popular. \"Sleigh Ride\" makes ample use of the present continuous/progressive tense. This verb tense is formed by using \"is/are/am\" plus a present participle (\"-ing\") of the main verb. The present progressive tense describes action which is taking place \"right now\" or \"at this moment.\" \n"}, {"text": "Please identify the modal or auxiliary verb in the following stanza from the song \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\":\n\n\"Oh, ho, the mistletoe hung where you can see\nSomebody waits for you; kiss her once for me...\"", "correct": "Can", "options": ["Waits", "Kiss", "Hung"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCan.\n\n\tThe classic song \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" was composed by Johnny Marks in 1962.

The verbs \"can and \"cannot\" are perhaps the most important modal forms in the English language. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these phrases from \"The Christmas Song\" contains a prepositional phrase?", "correct": "\"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire...\"", "options": ["\"Although it's been said many times, many ways...\"", "\"Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe...\"", "\"And every mother's child is gonna spy...\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire...\"\n\n\t\"The Christmas Song\" was composed in 1944 by Mel Torme and Bob Wells. Nat King Cole recorded his version of this classic holiday song in the early 1950s. The opening line of this tune contains an example of a prepositional phrase: \"on an open fire.\" Prepositions are words such as \"in\", \"on\", or \"at\" which give location to a noun. A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and a noun. \n"}, {"text": "In the song \"Jingle Bell Rock\", which one of these phrases contains an infinitive?", "correct": "\"It's the right time to rock the night away...\"", "options": ["\"Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun...\"", "\"Jingle around the clock...\"", "\"Now the jingle hop has begun...\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"It's the right time to rock the night away...\"\n\n\tThe classic song \"Jingle Bell Rock\" was composed by Joe Beal and Jim Boothe. The Bobby Helms' recording of this song is probably the most famous version in the U.S. In this song's lyrics, the phrase \"to rock\" is an example of an infinitive. An infinitive normally consists of the word \"to\" and a simple (base) verb form: \"to go.\" For example, Bobby Helms sang, \"Jingle bell time is a swell time TO GO gliding in a one-horse sleigh...\" \n"}, {"text": "Here's a straightforward one to finish this quiz. Which one of these phrases from the song \"Winter Wonderland\" contains an example of non-standard grammar?", "correct": "\"When it snows, ain't it thrilling?\"", "options": ["\"We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way...\"", "\"In the meadow, we can build a snowman...\"", "\"Later on, we'll conspire...\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"When it snows, ain't it thrilling?\".\n\n\tThe holiday song \"Winter Wonderland\" was composed by Felix Bernard and Richard B. Smith during the 1930s. In the song's final verse, the word \"ain't\" is used. Most grammarians would agree that this word is a substandard form of \"isn't.\" However, song lyrics must keep up with the rhythm of the music. The word \"isn't\" contains two syllables, but \"ain't\" only has one syllable; thus, \"ain't\" fits nicely into the melody. \n"}]}
