This group controlled Congress and overrode several of Johnson's vetoes in an effort to enforce their policy of \"Radical Reconstruction\". The feud between the President and Congress came to a head when Johnson, in defiance of the Tenure of Office Act, demanded the resignation of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton.The Tenure of Office Act was passed in 1867 over the veto of Johnson.
