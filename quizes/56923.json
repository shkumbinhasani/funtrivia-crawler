{"id": "56923", "name": "The Fisher King Quiz | F | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "F", "Fa - Fm Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Early in the film, Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) lists off a number of possible titles for his eventual biography with his girlfriend, Beth. Which of the following is NOT one of them?", "correct": "'It's No (expletive deleted) Picnic: The Jack Lucas Story'", "options": ["'Jack'", "'Jack Lucas: The Face and the Voice'", "'Jack Lucas: The Face Behind the Voice'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'It's No (expletive deleted) Picnic: The Jack Lucas Story'.\n\n\tJack, to Beth: \"I thought for a while that the title of my biography should be, 'Jack Lucas: The Face Behind the Voice.' But now I'm thinking it should be, 'Jack Lucas: The Face AND the Voice.' Or maybe just...'Jack.'\" It isn't until several years later that Jack mentions the 'No Picnic' title, and that's to a Pinocchio puppet, not Beth. \n"}, {"text": "Equally early in the film, Jack Lucas has been offered the lead in a TV sitcom. What is it called?", "correct": "'On the Radio'", "options": ["'Jack'", "'On the Air'", "'Shock Jock'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'On the Radio'.\n\n\tJack's agent mentions that the studio is trying to get the rights to the Donna Summer song of the same name for use as the show's theme song. \n"}, {"text": "Since the sitcom that Jack Lucas is offered is about a radio personality, there's a certain irony in the fact that the person playing Jack's agent would eventually become a member of the cast of the TV show 'Frasier,' whose title character is a radio personality. Who plays Jack's agent?", "correct": "David Hyde Pierce", "options": ["Dan Butler", "John Mahoney", "Peri Gilpin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Hyde Pierce.\n\n\tPierce -- credited as simply 'David Pierce' at this point -- played Lou Rosen in \"The Fisher King\" several years before making his claim to fame as Frasier Crane's fastidious brother, Niles. \n"}, {"text": "Due to the violent tragedy that effectively ruined Jack Lucas' career, the sitcom deal fell through. The actor who wound up taking the part that was originally offered to Jack is played by a man who appeared in the 1984 cult classic, 'This Is Spinal Tap.' What part did this man play?", "correct": "The bass player, Derek Smalls", "options": ["The documentarian, Marty DiBergi", "The lead guitarist, Nigel Tufnel", "The lead singer and rhythm guitarist, David St. Hubbins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bass player, Derek Smalls.\n\n\tHarry Shearer played Ben Starr, the eventual star of 'On the Radio,' as well as Derek Smalls in 'This Is Spinal Tap.' Shearer was a successful radio personality in California years before he became a TV and film actor, so his casting in 'The Fisher King' is probably a bit of an in-joke. \n"}, {"text": "After the tragic incident that destroys Jack Lucas' career, the story leaps forward a bit. According to a title card, how many years have passed since a crazed Jack Lucas fan opened fire on an upscale Manhattan bar?", "correct": "three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nthree & 3.\n\n\t'Three Years Later,' reads the title card when next we see Jack. \n"}, {"text": "Jack, in the present center of the film, is no longer a radio personality, but works at his girlfriend's video rental store. What is its name?", "correct": "Video Spot!", "options": ["Video Stash!", "Anne's Video!", "Anne's Video Center!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVideo Spot!.\n\n\tJack genuinely hates working there. \n"}, {"text": "Kathy Najimy has a notable cameo as an annoying customer at the video store. She fairly assails Jack with requests for help in picking out a 'zany' movie to rent. She seems to have no idea what to select, but lists a couple of comedy teams whose movies embody the mood she is looking for. Which comedy team does she NOT suggest?", "correct": "She mentions all of these teams", "options": ["Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase", "Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant", "Sally Field and Burt Reynolds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe mentions all of these teams.\n\n\tJack expresses his disdain for this customer by handing her a pornographic film. His stratagem apparently backfires, though -- Najimy looks quite interested once she takes a good look at the box. \n"}, {"text": "The video store owned by Anne Napolitano (Mercedes Ruehl) carries pornographic films as well as mainstream fare. Which of the following porn films is NOT mentioned by name in 'The Fisher King'?", "correct": "'Backside To the Future'", "options": ["'Creamer Vs. Creamer'", "'Ordinary Peepholes'", "All of these titles are mentioned"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Backside To the Future'.\n\n\tJack offers 'Ordinary Peepholes' to the Kathy Najimy character. Anne suggests 'Creamer Vs. Creamer' (adding, 'It won an award') to an intrusive customer later in the film. No mention is made of 'Backside To the Future' (a real film, I might add!). \n"}, {"text": "Several times during the film, Parry (Robin Williams) sings -- and leads others in singing -- a song from the 1941 film 'Babes On Broadway' called 'How About You?'. A more formal version of this song can be heard during the closing credits. Which artist, known mostly for his 70's work, performs it?", "correct": "Harry Nilsson", "options": ["Gary Wright", "Dan Fogelberg", "Harry Chapin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Nilsson.\n\n\tNilsson had a fatal heart attack just a few years after 'The Fisher King' was released. \n"}, {"text": "Parry, to Jack: 'I'm the _________ of God.'", "correct": "janitor", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\njanitor.\n\n\tI'm not sure this line works within the logic of the movie, but maybe that's just me. \n"}, {"text": "Parry -- named for the errant knight Parsifal (a.k.a. Parcival, Percival, and so forth)-- suffers from a number of psychological disorders throughout the course of the film. Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "options": ["schizophrenia", "psychogenic fugue", "catatonia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n\tAs defined by the DSM-IV, catatonia and auditory hallucinations (both experienced by Parry during the film) are textbook symptoms of schizophrenia. A psychogenic fugue is characterized by 'sudden, unexpected travel away from a person's usual environment, with an inability to recall the past, and often the adoption of a new identity' -- precisely what happened when Professor Henry Sagan 'became' Parry. There is no visible evidence of Parry engaging in obsessive-compulsive behavior, per se. \n"}, {"text": "Parry explains to Jack that, at some undetermined point in the past, a flock of overweight fairies suddenly appeared to him. What was Parry doing when this happened?", "correct": "Moving his bowels", "options": ["Contemplating suicide", "Eating a fruit pie", "Having sex"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoving his bowels.\n\n\tParry: 'I was having one of those really great bowel movements -- you know, the kind that just borders on the mystical?' \n"}, {"text": "Parry was instructed by the fairies to look for the Holy Grail on a certain page of a certain magazine. What was the magazine?", "correct": "'Progressive Architecture'", "options": ["'Architecture Monthly'", "'Architecture Magazine'", "'Better Homes and Gardens'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Progressive Architecture'.\n\n\tThe castle-like home of a man named Langdon Carmichael is featured in the issue in question. Amusingly enough, the building is actually Hunter College High School, which is closely affiliated with Hunter College, where Henry Sagan ('Parry,' before his tragic fall into insanity) was a teacher. \n"}, {"text": "Parry needs Jack's help in recovering the Holy Grail due to the interference of a figure whom apparently only Parry can see. Who is this adversary?", "correct": "The Red Knight", "options": ["The Black Knight", "The Green Knight", "The White Knight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Red Knight.\n\n\tThe Red Knight is an actual figure from the Grail mythos, but he exists on several symbolic levels in 'The Fisher King.' Perhaps most notably, the Knight repeatedly spews a plume of flame from the center of his forehead, which echoes the exit wound that took the life of Henry Sagan's wife. \n"}, {"text": "Robin Williams' character calls himself Parry, but this is not his real name. What is his real first name?", "correct": "Henry", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry.\n\n\tThe superintendent of the building where Parry stays tells Jack that 'Parry's' real name is Henry Sagan. \n"}, {"text": "Before he became 'Parry,' Robin Williams' character was a professor. Where did he teach?", "correct": "Hunter College", "options": ["Columbia University", "New York University", "Barnard College"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHunter College.\n\n\tAgain, the superintendent reveals this to Jack. We're never told exactly what Henry taught, but Medieval Studies or English Literature would seem to be safe bets. \n"}, {"text": "Several notable character actors make appearances as Parry's homeless friends. Which of the following does NOT appear in 'The Fisher King'?", "correct": "Nathan Lane", "options": ["Michael Jeter", "Tom Waits", "They all appear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNathan Lane.\n\n\tJeter plays the 'cabaret singer' who comes in handy during Jack's plan to get Lydia and Parry together. Waits plays a disabled veteran who 'works' Grand Central Station. Lane does not appear in the film. \n"}, {"text": "There is an elaborate fantasy sequence set in Grand Central Station during which the hundred-plus visible commuters pair off and waltz while Parry follows his true love, Lydia (Amanda Plummer). True or False: this scene was shot in the real Grand Central Station.", "correct": "true & t & yes & y", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ntrue & t & yes & y.\n\n\tGilliam has noted several times that they had to shoot this scene in the wee hours of a Sunday night -- and even then, they barely had an hour or two to get the footage they needed. \n"}, {"text": "While trying to convince Parry that he should pursue Lydia before making his try for the Holy Grail, he notes, 'Women are great! They kill the livestock so knights can go out and fulfill quests. Where would King Arthur have wound up without Guinivere?' What is Parry's response?", "correct": "'Happily married, probably.'", "options": ["'Better off, probably.'", "'A virgin, probably.'", "'Still alive, probably.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Happily married, probably.'\n\n\tHard to disagree with Parry on that one. \n"}, {"text": "When Jack finally introduces Lydia and Parry, there's an awkward moment when Jack realizes he doesn't know what to use as Parry's last name. Parry says, 'It's just Parry.' Lydia says, 'Oh -- like _______.' What word goes in the blank?", "correct": "Moses", "options": ["Madonna", "Cher", "Percival"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoses.\n\n\tMoses doesn't exactly fit with the medieval theme of the film...but hey, she's right. =) \n"}, {"text": "While at Anne's video store, Lydia hopes to rent one or more films featuring a particular performer. Who is it?", "correct": "Ethel Merman", "options": ["Doris Day", "Gene Kelly", "Fred Astaire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEthel Merman.\n\n\tLydia explains that she enjoys musicals, and goes on to request Ethel Merman films. Unfortunately, there's not one to be found in the store. \n"}, {"text": "Jack gets Parry cleaned and primped for his date with Lydia, and loans him a suit. Since Jack is much taller than Parry, though, the cuffs of both the pants and jacket are too long. How does Jack solve this problem?", "correct": "He uses a stapler to shorten the cuffs", "options": ["He uses safety pins to shorten the cuffs", "He uses paper clips to shorten the cuffs", "He doesn't solve this problem -- Parry goes out in the ill-fitting suit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe uses a stapler to shorten the cuffs.\n\n\tI'm thinking that this is bad for one's suit. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following characters from 'The Fisher King' is NOT played by a person with at least one parent who is also a famous actor?", "correct": "Anne Napolitano", "options": ["Lydia Sinclair", "They all have parents in show business", "Jack Lucas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnne Napolitano.\n\n\tAmanda Plummer (Lydia) is the daughter of veteran actor Christopher Plummer. Jeff Bridges (Jack) is the son of veteran (and late) actor Lloyd Bridges. Neither of Mercedes Ruehl's parents were actors. \n"}, {"text": "As Lydia and Anne are getting to know each other, Anne admits bemusedly that Lydia does not have the looks of a supermodel. She goes on to name one particular model as an example of what Lydia does NOT look like. Who is it?", "correct": "Jerry Hall", "options": ["Cheryl Tiegs", "Christie Brinkley", "Cindy Crawford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJerry Hall.\n\n\tAnne: 'Okay, so you're not Jerry Hall. Imagine how boring the world would be if we were all Jerry Hall!' (I agree.) \n"}, {"text": "And finally, an Oscar question. All four of the principal actors are well-respected in their field, but only one of them won an Oscar for his or her peformance in 'The Fisher King.' Who was it?", "correct": "Mercedes Ruehl", "options": ["Jeff Bridges", "Robin Williams", "Amanda Plummer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes Ruehl.\n\n\tRuehl took home the statue for Best Supporting Actress. Robin Williams was nominated as Best Actor, but lost to Anthony Hopkins for his performance in 'The Silence Of the Lambs.' \n"}]}
