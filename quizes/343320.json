It appears blue because it is reflecting the color of the oceans.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe blue color of the sky is due to an effect called Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through our atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths such as red, orange and yellow pass straight through. However, much of the shorter wavelength light such as blue, is absorbed by the molecules in the atmosphere. It is then radiated in different directions getting scattered all around the sky. No matter which direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches your eyes. Because you see blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. \n"}]}
