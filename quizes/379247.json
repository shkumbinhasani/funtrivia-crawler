While he was new to Supergirl, who had only revealed herself to the world a few weeks earlier, he was a longtime foe of Superman.\r It was mentioned in the episode that Superman had fought and lost to Reactron several times in the past.\r The odd thing was that Reactron wasn't an alien, just a simple human who built a suit to help him fight the Kryptonians. \n"}, {"text": "What big project was Maxwell Lord working on?", "correct": "A 'floating' train.", "options": ["A super fast jet.", "Building Kryptonite-laced bullets", "Fixing up buildings that had been destroyed by Supergirl."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA 'floating' train.\n\n\tMaxwell was not a nice person when not in the public eye, but when the media was around he was one of the best people in National City.\r This project was a low-cost, super fast train for people of the city to use as mass transit. The train was about to leave on its first journey early in the episode. \n"}, {"text": "Where was the current big bad's hideout?", "correct": "In a junkyard.", "options": ["In the sewer.", "Under the CatCo building.", "Inside Maxwell's lab."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a junkyard.\n\n\tIt was the perfect place to hide from a Kryptonian.

Alex is a government agent and also not a reporter. James is a photographer. Cat, who rarely writes anymore since she is the CEO of the company, conducted the interview. She did the interview shown in the opening scene of the episode and spent the next half of the episode writing the article. Because of her lack of regular writing, she was quite nervous about the reaction to the article. \n"}, {"text": "What happened at the magazine release party?", "correct": "Reactron attacked.", "options": ["The CatCo building lost power.", "Maxwell crashed and caused a big commotion.", "Supergirl showed up in full costume."], "explanation": "\n\n\nReactron attacked.\n\n\tReactron crashed the party, attempting to draw Supergirl out and possibly recapture Maxwell after he had been rescued earlier in the episode.\r Of course he succeeded in calling out Supergirl, but the fight didn't turn out like he'd have hoped.\r Reactron was played by Chris Browning in the episode. \n"}, {"text": "How did Supergirl win the fight? ", "correct": "Ripped out the core of the bad guy's suit.", "options": ["She lost the rematch and the episode ended.", "Dropped a car on the bad guy.", "Used her freeze breath to encase the bad guy in ice."], "explanation": "\n\n\nRipped out the core of the bad guy's suit.\n\n\tSupergirl used her heat vision to melt a lead statue and encased her hand in the lead.\r She then punched through Reactron's suit and ripped out the core, allowing it to then explode inside the lead, which stopped it from being harmful. \n"}, {"text": "James Olsen used a special watch to communicate with Supergirl in this episode.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe watch, tuned to a supersonic frequency, was actually used to call Superman all the way from Metropolis.\r This was how Superman knew Kara needed help the first time she met up with Reactron.\r It wasn't explained why Supergirl, who was thousands of miles closer to the watch didn't hear the sound when Superman did. \n"}, {"text": "Who is James Olsen's ex-girlfriend?", "correct": "Lucy Lane", "options": ["Kara Danvers", "Alex Danvers", "Lois Lane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLucy Lane.\n\n\tLucy and Lois are sisters.
