The people of the most geographically isolated capital city in the world turned on as many lights as possible as he passed overhead, causing him to dub it \"the city of lights\". What is the name of this city? ", "correct": "Perth", "options": ["Hobart", "Adelaide", "Darwin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPerth.\n\n\tWhen John Glenn saw the lights of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, he sent a message to mission control: \"The lights show up very well. Thank everybody for turning them on, will you?\" Thirty-six years later, in 1998, John Glenn took part in the Discovery space shuttle flight and Perth repeated the gesture, turning on the lights to welcome Glenn back. \rMy hometown of Perth has many other claims to fame. Did you know we also have the largest inner city park in the world, even bigger than New York's Central Park? Kings Park occupies about 400 hectares of land on Mount Eliza, which offers magnificent views over the city and the Swan River, and gives visitors the opportunity to experience our spectacular wildflowers and native bushlands. Come and see! \r MotherGoose contributed this bit of interesting Australian history. \n"}, {"text": "The nomadic aboriginal people of the Canadian prairies didn't leave much concrete evidence of their thousands of years here. A few rock paintings, some teepee rings and medicine wheels, and, not far from the little town of Viking, Alberta, the Ribstones. The two large rocks were carved, who knows how long ago, into the representation of the ribs of an animal that had great significance and meaning to the Cree and Blackfoot of this area, and to their ancestors. What animal was this?", "correct": "Bison", "options": ["Wolf", "Raven", "Orca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBison.\n\n\tThere are actually about twenty Ribstone sites scattered around Alberta and Saskatchewan, but the Viking ones are not too hard to get to. The two smallish boulders (the large one is about four feet by three, and two feet high, the smaller maybe two thirds that size) have been painstakingly carved into the shape of buffalo ribcages. They sit on top of a small hill, probably used as a lookout point. The stones themselves, quartzite, are from the Canadian Shield, far from here, and were probably deposited on the hill by glaciers. All the petroglyphs of this part of Western Canada were carved on such rocks, and all are on hilltops. \rThere is no big tourist attraction here, just a small fenced off area in a farmer's field. Although there are signs directing visitors to the site, it's not too easy to find. The local First Nations people still often leave offerings at the Ribstones, and I hope, if any of you ever find yourself in this part of the world, and visit them, you will treat them with respect.\r Agony crafted this monumental question. \n"}, {"text": "A plastic lawn chair by any other name would still spell a seat. During my recent stay in Greece, I discovered that plastic lawn chairs in Greece are virtually indistinguishable from the American plastic lawn chair. The name, however, is an exercise in ethnography, demography, 'insertgreekwordhere'graphy...What do the Greeks call plastic lawn chairs? ", "correct": "Gypsy chairs", "options": ["Plastic chairs", "Easily destructible chairs", "Athena chairs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGypsy chairs.\n\n\tThey're called \"Gypsy Chairs\" because gypsies are usually the ones who sell them. They make the circuit of various Greek villages, driving vans piled high with plastic lawn chairs and announcing themselves and their wares to the world with megaphones. These vans could put the Beverly Hillbillies to shame. So one evening in my small Greek village when I was trying to sleep, \"(GREEK GREEK GREEK GREEK GREEK.)\" I love Greece. \r Pu2-ke-qi-ri contributed this leisurely question. \n"}, {"text": "My hometown is Brighton in the county of East Sussex, located on England's south coast. At just over 50 miles distance from the capital, Brighton is often called \"London by the Sea\". Which of these facts about Brighton is NOT true? ", "correct": "Brighton is famed for its seafront tower and boasts the UK's tallest roller coaster (as of 2005) located at the city's  Pleasure Beach.", "options": ["Among its many attraction Brighton boasts the oldest operational electric railway in the world.", "In the 16th century Brighton, then a fishing village called Brighthelmstone, was burned to the ground by French invaders.", "In 1984 the IRA (Irish Republican Army) bombed Brighton's Grand hotel where leading members of the governing Conservative Party were staying."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrighton is famed for its seafront tower and boasts the UK's tallest roller coaster (as of 2005) located at the city's  Pleasure Beach.\n\n\tThe famous tower and Pepsi Max roller coaster are to be found at the seaside resort of Blackpool on the Lancashire coast. \rAmong those who escaped from the IRA bombing of Brighton's Grand Hotel in 1984 was the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She emerged from the building, in which five people were killed, shocked and covered with dust. The governing Conservative Party was in Brighton for its annual conference, which continued as scheduled, less than seven hours after the explosion. \rMagnus Volk built the Volk's Electric Railway in 1883. The narrow gauge railway runs one and a half miles along Brighton seafront. \rBrighton first became a fashionable resort when the Prince Regent, later to become King George IV, built the famous Royal Pavilion in the 1820s. He often escaped to Brighton to get away from the pressures of public life. Much of the original fishing village of Brighthelmstone, now called the Lanes, still exists and is a popular tourist attraction.\rToday Brighton is a bustling, cosmopolitan city regularly hosting political party conferences and holding England's biggest annual arts festival. Many rallies and races start in London and finish on Brighton's seafront, these include runners, cyclists, classic cars, vintage commercial vehicles and most famous of them all, the Veteran Car Run. The city has two universities and numerous restaurants, cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and bars. And most important of all, Brighton always extends a warm welcome for visitors. \r Musicmonkeyman penned this paean to his home city. \n"}, {"text": "Near the end of the 14th century, the citizens of a French city constructed a candle as long as the circumference of its walls, almost 4km long! It was stored on a spool, and was unrolled as it burned. Which city was this?", "correct": "Montpellier", "options": ["Marseilles", "Toulouse", "Lyons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMontpellier.\n\n\tAccording to the Michelin Guide, the city had been having a rough time, what with bandits, the plague, earthquakes and floods. They constructed the candle with the hopes that burning it in front of the cathedral would bring an end to their troubles. \r Ertrum brought this interesting information to light. \n"}, {"text": "Metallica released a recording of \"Whiskey In The Jar\" in 1999. Of course, this was a re-recording of the 1972 version of the song made well-known by Thin Lizzy. However, there is a lesser-known release of this song by an Australian group from the 60s that pre-dates the above renditions. Who performed it? ", "correct": "The Seekers", "options": ["Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs", "The Bee Gees", "The Easybeats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Seekers.\n\n\tOriginally released on The Seekers' self-titled album, \"Whisky\" (sans the E) was a folk standard that fell neatly into the genre of music that The Seekers made their name performing. Best known for such 60s hits as \"Georgy Girl\", \"A World Of Our Own\", \"I'll Never Find Another You\", \"Morningtown Ride\" and the beautiful \"The Carnival Is Over\", it must be said that their version of \"Whisky\" is far removed from the sound produced by Metallica! \r FussBudget provided this intoxicating bit of trivia. \n"}, {"text": "On Canada's Vancouver Island, one can enjoy a delightful stroll through the gardens that Jennie Butchart created in order to hide the scars that had resulted from her husband's obsession. To what was Robert Butchart introduced on his honeymoon that set in motion the events that led to the creation of Butchart Gardens? ", "correct": "Portland cement", "options": ["Cocaine", "Heroin", "Marijuana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortland cement.\n\n\tApparently an eminently curable romantic, Robert Butchart spent a portion of his honeymoon researching cement. Having learned the process for making Portland cement, he returned to Vancouver Island and built his house next to the limestone quarry that supplied him with this material requisite for manufacture of cement. In 1908 the limestone deposits were exhausted, and Jennie Butchart found herself living in a home flanked by an unsightly, gaping pit. Jennie extended her gardens into the hideously scarred landscape her husband's quarry had created. Butchart Gardens now utilize over 1,000,000 bed plants yearly to produce their extraordinary displays. \rIn an exhibit of the couple's books at Butchart Gardens, most of Robert Butchart's books dealt with Portland cement. Most of Jennie Butchart's books were on gardening - with one notable exception - a book her husband had given her on... the household uses of Portland cement! \rMr. Butchart too has made a lasting contribution to the Butchart legacy as well. His company was the first to supply cement in bags rather than barrels. \r Uglybird supplied this cautionary tale. \n"}, {"text": "Canberra is both the capital city and seat of Government of Australia. As such it is the butt of many jokes and is often damned (especially by non-residents and sullen local teenagers) as being 'soulless'. Perhaps this is why there is much speculation about the underlying symbolism employed by architect Walter Burley Griffin when he infamously won the international competition to design Canberra in 1912. Griffin and his draftsman wife Marion Mahony were known to be advocates of spiritual freedom, espousing ideas seen as the forerunners to 'new age' thinking. So it is somewhat ironic that the National Trust Listed municipal building that remains as an example of the great architect's work (not even located in Canberra but in Sydney!) is what type of structure? ", "correct": "Garbage Incinerator", "options": ["Public Toilet", "Social Security Office", "Tourist Information Centre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarbage Incinerator.\n\n\tWalter Burley Griffin (1876-1937) met Marion Mahony (1871-1961) in 1909 while they were both working in Frank Lloyd Wright's Chicago studio. Their marriage in 1911 and their subsequent move to Australia coincided with Wright's scandalous abandonment of his wife and children when he ran off to Europe with the wife of one of his clients. But it was apparently a pay dispute - whereby Wright tried to pay Griffin in Japanese prints rather than cold hard cash - that caused their falling out and led to Wright's later dismissal of Griffin as 'just a draftsman'. \rMarion - who was the first female licensed architect in America, if not the world - was responsible for rendering Walter's ideas for Canberra in a series of enormous and beautiful watercolours. This has led to speculation that it was she who was the true brains behind the operation, but it seems more likely it was a true collaborative effort. Again, there is speculation that the Griffins incorporated all sorts of esoteric symbolism into their design for Australia's capital - including elements of Feng Shui, long before this became the province of the hip and trendy. All this is, unfortunately, fairly academic in postulating the basis of a 'soul' for Canberra, as there is very little of the original Griffin design in the city; the couple were sacked from the project in 1920, partly as a result of Walter's outspoken condemnation of Australia's involvement in World War I. \rThe National Trust Listed Incinerator is in the Sydney suburb of Willoughby (swallow and substitute most of the vowels in the traditional Australian manner until it comes out like 'wallaby' but with an 'i' instead of the first 'a') and is, to be fair, an impressive piece of work and bears much more decoration than your average garbage disposal system. Its design, too, is somewhat revolutionary and it is apparently functional in the extreme.\rHowever, my favourite statement about Griffin's work comes from http://www.sydneyclimbing.com, which promises \"Sun, Surf and Sandstone - A Rockclimber's Guide to Sydney\": \r\"There's some good bouldering on the rear walls of the Walter Burley Griffin Incinerator, in Small St in Willoughby (near the Willoughby Leisure Centre). The building has recently been refurbished and fitted out as office space, so be discreet if you plan on bouldering here.\" \r Ing submitted this capital question. \n"}, {"text": "Alphonse Daudet wrote about this town in the Provence region of France along the Rhone in 'Tartarin de Tarascon'. How did the town get its name? ", "correct": "A legend of a dragon called the Tarasque who Sainte Marthe fought with in the first century AD.", "options": ["It was named after a wild bird common in that region called the 'Tarrasca' in Provencal.", "It was named after the little-known St Tarrascon for saving them from a flood.", "It was named for the Tarot cards practiced there by Tsigane populations."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA legend of a dragon called the Tarasque who Sainte Marthe fought with in the first century AD.\n\n\tThe Tarrasque is the name of the reptile beast that attacked the village and the legend had it that Lazarus, Mary Magdalene, and St Martha were in the area when this occurred and saved them. Her relics were built into a Romanesque church to protect them from Saracen attacks later on. The festival can be viewed each year and a replica of the beast runs through the streets causing great glee amongst the kids. The Tarasque was a bit like the first century Godzilla, if you will. Daudet's novels centered on a character who bragged about his exploits hunting and exploring, but it was all bragging. \r Bruyere provided this tidbit of Gallic legend. \n"}, {"text": "One thing I liked best about my former life in England was the undeniable and constant presence of ghostly activity. Seemed one couldn't swing a ferret without hitting one or more of the disembodied spirits standing around. So, here's a ghostly question for fellow fans of the paranormal. Of the countless \"haunted' places that pepper the British Isles, which of the following famous private residences was known throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s as the \"most haunted house in England\"? ", "correct": "Borley Rectory", "options": ["Windsor Castle", "Greyrigg Hall", "Raynham Hall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBorley Rectory.\n\n\tAlthough all four locations are known for their ghosts-in-residence, it is Borley Rectory that holds the honor of having been once declared \"the most haunted house in England.\" No less a personage than Harry Price, president of the British Society For Psychical Research, spent several weeks in the house in the early 1900s attempting to verify reports of objects being dropped from the ceiling, stones hurled through the air, and the appearance of strange writing on the walls. Borley Rectory's reputation as England's number one hotbed of ghostly fun and games continued until a fire destroyed the house in the 1920s. \r Gretas supplied this haunting question. \n"}]}
