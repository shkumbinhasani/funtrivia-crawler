{"id": "173332", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Movie Tonight' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 5 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "The entire camp seems cranky and no one is getting along, which means that the situation is essentially normal.  Exacerbating the irritability of the members of the 4077th is the fact that they are engaged in what activity at the beginning of this episode?", "correct": "Cleaning the operating room", "options": ["Eating an awful lunch in the mess tent", "Operating on a large influx of casualties", "Getting their annual physicals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCleaning the operating room.\n\n\tNothing can cheer up a crowd quicker than a good spring cleaning session...and that's just what the crew at the M*A*S*H 4077th is engaged in during the opening of this episode.  As usual, Frank is bickering with Hawkeye and BJ, who in turn parse his words for the usual stupidities.  Margaret engages herself in nitpicking everyone to death and Klinger complains about everyone tromping across his newly mopped floor.  Colonel Potter seeks something to break up this bitter monotony, and soon he will find it. \n"}, {"text": "After a long and grueling day, Hawkeye and BJ are seen in the swamp engaging themselves in their usual banter.  BJ offers Hawkeye some of his latest culinary gift from Peg, which Hawkeye finds to be awful.  Which of these pies is obviously not Peg's dessert specialty?", "correct": "Dutch apple crumb pie", "options": ["Lemon meringue pie", "Key lime pie", "Boston cream pie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDutch apple crumb pie.\n\n\tAfter Hawkeye tries the apple crumb pie he suggests that is 'really crummy'.  BJ responds, 'Yeah, I know.' Hawkeye answers back, 'No, I mean it's awful!'  He then asks Frank for some of his shoe polish so he can 'get this rotten taste out of [his] mouth.'  BJ is offended enough to complain about a shirt Hawkeye bought him from Seoul that clearly has one arm longer than the other.  The anomie continues! \n"}, {"text": "After a not-so-friendly conversation with his Swampmates, Hawkeye looks to find an amiable ear in the nurses' tent.  What he finds are four happy nurses preparing to leave for Seoul.  The nurses are excited because they have dates with men of what occupation down in South Korea's capital?", "correct": "Pilots", "options": ["Generals", "Journalists", "Marines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPilots.\n\n\tThe nurses allude to their dates during the 'Army Song' later in the episode: 'The surgeons in the Army, they're bright, they are profound, but we'll take chopper pilots they'll get you off the ground.'  Of course, they must not value the pilots that much, as they jilt their dates in favor of the movie that evening. \n"}, {"text": "In the mess tent that evening Colonel Potter announces to everyone's delight that the movie that evening will be 'My Darling Clementine', his all-time favorite.  In the following scene we see the beginning credits of the film.  Which of these actors plays the lead role of Wyatt Earp in the film?", "correct": "Henry Fonda", "options": ["Cary Grant", "Humphrey Bogart", "Jimmy Stewart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry Fonda.\n\n\tThe film stars Fonda, Linda Darnell and Victor Mature (the names featured before the title).  John Ford directs 'My Darling Clementine', and the film also includes Cathy Downs, Walter Brennan, Tim Holt, Ward Bond, Alan Mowbray and John Ireland.  Surprisingly, this classic film (from 1946) was nominated for no Academy Awards! \n"}, {"text": "The film cuts out several times, affording the dwellers of the 4077th a chance to show off some of their talents.  During the first interruption the entire camp engages in a singalong.  What song do they sing?", "correct": "The Tennessee Waltz", "options": ["My Old Kentucky Home", "Mississippi Mud", "On Wisconsin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Tennessee Waltz.\n\n\tThe first verse of the song goes: \r 'I was waltzing with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz, \rWhen an old Friend I happened to see, \rIntroduced him to my loved one and while they were waltzing, \rMy friend stole my sweetheart from me.'\r During the singing, some of the cast members get the lyrics wrong.  Potter replaces 'loved one' with 'true love' and Hawkeye sings 'dancing' instead of 'waltzing'. \n"}, {"text": "During the next involuntary intermission the camp members sing the 'Army Song', with the chorus 'Oh I don't want no more of Army life, Gee Ma, I wanna go home!'.  Which of these people sings the first verse of the song?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Radar", "Margaret", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy's verse goes: 'A chaplain in the Army has a collar on his neck, if you don't listen to him you'll all wind up in heck.'  He also plays piano for this very rousing and imaginative song.  He is followed by Hawkeye, BJ, Potter, the nurses, Radar, Klinger and Margaret.  After a break, Frank sings the final, hilarious verse. \n"}, {"text": "Following the 'Army Song', Klinger gets the film running again but without sound.  While he once again tries to fix the projector, Colonel Potter insists that Radar do some of his 'great movie star imitations'.  Aside from John Wayne, which other person does Radar imitate?", "correct": "Jack Benny", "options": ["James Cagney", "Mickey Rooney", "Bob Hope"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Benny.\n\n\tRadar's impersonation of John Wayne includes these lines:\r 'Well it looks like you've got some people around here pretty mad at ya son.  But I'm not gonna hit ya.  I'm not gonna hit ya.  Like hell I'm not!'\r After being teased for this imitation Radar follows up in his best Jack Benny voice:\r 'Now cut that out! (Klinger, impersonating Benny's sidekick Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson: 'Okay, Mr. Benny!') Rochester, now how many times have I told ya, ya see, never to interrupt me when I'm doing the show.  Oh, Don.  Oh, Mary.  Oh, Dennis.' \n"}, {"text": "Following Radar's impersonations the entire camp takes part in the 'Father Mulcahy Soundalike Contest'.  Which of these impersonator's lines are simply, 'Jocularity!  Jocularity!'?", "correct": "Potter", "options": ["Margaret", "Radar", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPotter.\n\n\tSeveral individuals take their turns imitating Father Mulcahy, including Hawkeye, Klinger, Frank, Margaret, Radar and Potter.  Radar's impression is the best, in my opinion, followed by Frank.  The worst is the Colonel's impression.  After all the impressions, Father Mulcahy takes back his cap and says, 'Now let me just say this about all these impersonations...'  The entire camp boos him for what they suggest is a terrible impression of himself. \n"}, {"text": "During another break in the film, Hawkeye announces a song performance from 'the toast of two continents and the Pink Pagoda in Seoul' Margaret Houlihan.  What song does Hot Lips sing solo in this episode?", "correct": "C'est Magnifique", "options": ["You're the Top", "Molly Malone", "My Blue Heaven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nC'est Magnifique.\n\n\tMargaret performs 'C'est Magnifique', a song written by Cole Porter.  Here are the lyrics:\r 'When love comes in and takes you for a spin, \rOo la la la, c'est magnifique. \rWhen every night, your loved one holds you tight, \rOo la la la, c'est magnifique. \rBut when one day, your loved one drifts away, \rOo la la la, it is so tragique. \rBut when once more she whispers \"Je t'adore\" \rC'est magnifique.' \n"}, {"text": "In the episode 'Movie Tonight', is the song 'Clementine' ever featured all or in part?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIn fact, the song is featured twice, once at the beginning of the movie and once at the end of the episode when the M*A*S*H-ites are in the operating room.  One only hears the chorus of the song in each instance.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other stuff. \n"}]}
