{"id": "353217", "name": "I Forgot to Remember to Forget Quiz | Sci / Tech | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Diseases", "Neurological Disorders"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the term used for any dementia that occurs before the age of 65?", "correct": "Early-onset dementia", "options": ["Middle-age dementia", "Beginning-stage dementia", "Parent-of-teenager dementia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarly-onset dementia.\n\n\tEarly-onset dementia is the term used for any kind of dementia that occurs before the age of 65. While dementia is usually a disorder of the elderly it can occur as young as the thirties. The earlier the disorder presents, the faster the progression. There is also believed to be a strong genetic predisposition to most forms of early-onset dementia. \n"}, {"text": "Pugilist Dementia is a disorder often seen in patients with which of the following in their medical history?", "correct": "Multiple concussions", "options": ["Infertility", "Drug addiction", "Chicken Pox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMultiple concussions.\n\n\tPugilist Dementia is also known as Punch Drunk Syndrome or Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy and is a type of dementia that comes from repeated concussions. Symptoms include tremors and poor coordination, along with declining mental abilities, memory loss, and explosive behavior. It is not known if this disorder is caused by plaques, scarring, neuron loss, or neurofibrillary tangles.Damage to the cerebral blood vessels is also a possibility. This disorder is seen in other sports other than boxing. Famous boxers who are believed to have suffered from this disorder when they got older include Floyd Patterson, Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Frazier and possibly Muhammad Ali. \n"}, {"text": "Multi-infarct dementia is caused by which of the following?", "correct": "Multiple strokes", "options": ["Alcoholism", "Low blood pressure", "Sleep apnea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMultiple strokes.\n\n\tMulti-infarct dementia is the second most common form of dementia in the geriatric population. It is caused by having a number of small strokes which cause multiple vascular lesions. It is usually considered to be irreversible but is believed to be partially preventable. Controlling high blood pressure and eating a healthy diet can definitely lower your chances of developing this disorder. \n"}, {"text": "What is usually the first symptom of Semantic Dementia?", "correct": "Inability to remember the meaning of words", "options": ["Intention tremors", "Severe bouts of anger", "Blindness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInability to remember the meaning of words.\n\n\tSemantic dementia is a progressive loss of the ability to remember the meaning of words. This is followed by the inability to understand facial expressions and other abstract ideas, such as happiness, clearness, slenderness etc. Memory is not usually affected the same way it is in other dementias. The patient will remember how to get to the store to buy milk, but will not be able to remember the name for milk, describe how to get to the store, or explain the concept of money.Complete aphasia follows, meaning a complete inability to understand or speak words in any meaningful way. This dementia tends to start in the 50's and progression varies.This disorder is not caused by environmental or lifestyle factors or head injury and genetics is not believed to be involved in most cases. \n"}, {"text": "Alcohol dementia differs from most types of dementia in which of the following ways?", "correct": "It is completely preventable", "options": ["It affects only males", "It causes loss of all bodily hair", "Drinking large amounts of wine causes complete remission"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is completely preventable.\n\n\tAlcohol dementia is caused by excessive use of alcohol over long periods of time. It is also completely preventable by limiting the amount of alcohol consumed, and eating a vitamin-rich diet. Most patients with this disorder have severe thiamine (B12) deficiencies caused by their alcoholism. The symptoms include memory loss, personality change, language problems, impaired judgment and problems performing the normal acts of daily living.This form of dementia can be partially reversed if caught early enough. Complete abstinence is a must and women have better rates of recovery than do men. Return of full cognitive abilities should not be expected, just a halt in the progress of the disorder and the recovery of some of the lost skills.\n"}, {"text": "What is the most common first sign of Alzheimer's Dementia?", "correct": "Difficulty in remembering recent events", "options": ["Loss of appetite", "Difficulty in remembering childhood events", "Violent temper tantrums"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDifficulty in remembering recent events.\n\n\tThe most common sign of Alzheimer's is difficulty in remembering recent events. Memories of childhood events are retained for quite a while, with the person sometimes reverting to childish behaviors. This progresses to depression, irritability, confusion, mood swings, and in some patients, aggression and sexual promiscuity.In later stages all sense of self disappears, control of body functions is lost, and round the clock care is necessary. Death usually occurs about seven years after diagnosis, but can be as long as 20 years later. At the turn of the 21st century, despite intensive scientific inquiry, there were no treatments that stopped, reversed, or slowed the progression of this devastating disease. \n"}, {"text": "What is 'sundowning', a behavior often seen in dementia patients?", "correct": "Increased confusion in the evening", "options": ["Fear of the dark", "Increase in the number of dreams while sleeping", "Eating lots of food at night"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIncreased confusion in the evening.\n\n\tSundowning is the term for the increase in confusion and restlessness that occurs in dementia patients as the day wears on. Many dementia patients' symptoms are barely noticeable in the mornings but become worse as the day goes on. Wandering away from the home at night can become a real problem. There is usually no fear of the dark, and loss of appetite usually lasts all day.Most violent behaviors, if and when they appear, occur in the evening and night hours. Disruption of the circadian rhythm is believed to be a factor, but for the most part, dementia is a poorly understood disorder despite its increasing prevalence. \n"}, {"text": "A person can have more than one type of dementia at the same time.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThis is true. A patient with Alzheimer's can also have Pugilist Dementia. Genetics, lifestyle, and medical history can all influence which of these disorders someone can get. Almost any two dementias can co-exist at the same time. The problem comes with diagnosis. Often it is impossible to tell for sure what was going on in the brain until an autopsy is performed after death. Even then, diagnosis can still be very tricky. \n"}, {"text": "What is the biggest problem that faces dementia patients who smoke?", "correct": "Accidentally starting a fire", "options": ["The eating of cigarettes", "Forgetting to buy cigarettes", "There is no problem, as patients forget that they smoke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAccidentally starting a fire.\n\n\tAccidental fires are the biggest danger for most dementia patients. Smokers with dementia may not know who they are, where they are, or what year it is, but most will remember that they smoke. Until later stages when complete loss of motor control sets in, most smokers with dementia will do whatever it takes to be able to smoke.In early and middle stages they may lose their cigarettes, start smoking in inappropriate places (like the doctor's office), or lay a burning cigarette down in a dangerous place (like the couch). For some patients, the offer of a cigarette can sometimes calm them down. The dangers of smoking to respiratory health becomes somewhat moot.Anyone with dementia who smokes must be monitored any time that they smoke and the cigarettes and lighters must be kept out of their reach. Some caretakers have had good success with getting the patient to use an electronic cigarette. This is just one more of the challenges faced by caregivers of smokers who have dementia. Addiction to any substance is even more difficult to treat once dementia sets in. \n"}, {"text": "Playing on Fun Trivia is generally a good idea for subjects in the early stages of dementia.", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tTrivia games provide mental stimulation for all ages. For the elderly and those in the beginning and middle stages of dementia, this type of stimulation might actually delay or slow the progression of the disorder. Trivia games require memory and they stimulate the pathways through the cerebral cortex which are important to language, memory, and abstract thinking. Every time you play on this site you are exercising your brain cells and thus, improving your brain health. This site is mentioned by name on at least two websites dedicated to dementia. \n"}]}
