{"id": "258227", "name": "\"House\" - \"Euphoria\" Quiz / Test | 'House' - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "House, M.D.", "Episodes"], "questions": [{"text": "The episode opens with a chase scene: police officer Joe Luria (Scott Michael Campbell) is pursuing a suspect named Baby Shoes (Chioke Dmachi). It quickly becomes apparent that things are not quite right with the cop. What is his strange symptom?", "correct": "He's very happy and can't stop laughing -- even after he's shot.", "options": ["He has short-term memory loss; for example, he reads Baby Shoes the Miranda warning twice.", "His left arm is twitching uncontrollably.", "He speaks more and more slowly as the scene unfolds, finally passing out."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's very happy and can't stop laughing -- even after he's shot.\n\n\tOne can sympathize with Baby Shoes in this situation. He's been caught fair and square (hiding in a dumpster), and he knows it. He holds his hands in the air as the cop starts reading him his rights. But as the cop starts laughing harder and harder, Baby Shoes grows understandably nervous. Officer Luria clearly isn't taking the Miranda rights very seriously -- and more importantly, he's waving his gun around to punctuate his jokes.\"Be careful with that,\" Baby Shoes pleads, but the cop isn't listening; when Baby Shoes shoots, he clearly believes that it's self-defense. The bullet shatters on Joe's bulletproof vest, and fragments embed themselves in his forehead -- and he still finds it funny! \n"}, {"text": "As the diagnostic medicine team starts brainstorming about the police officer's symptoms, it's clear that there's still some lingering tension between Cameron and Foreman over events a few episodes previously. What is their fight about?", "correct": "Foreman published an article about a case that Cameron had also written up for publication.", "options": ["They disagreed about how to advise a woman who wanted to donate part of her liver to her girlfriend.", "Foreman laughed when Chase joked that Cameron was only good for testing bacteria.", "Cameron is angry about the decisions Foreman made when Cuddy put him in charge of the department."], "explanation": "\n\n\nForeman published an article about a case that Cameron had also written up for publication.\n\n\tThe case was from the episode \"Autopsy,\" earlier in the second season: an adorable nine-year-old girl, a cancer patient, was cooled down for several minutes so that the team could locate the blood clot in her brain; she was essentially dead during the procedure. Cameron wrote an article about whether \"informed consent\" can ever really be informed when it comes to such complicated procedures; she submitted it to House for his review and it sat abandoned on his desk for months. Meanwhile, House signed Foreman's article -- which focused on the details of the procedure -- almost immediately, and the first Cameron heard of it was when she saw it in a medical journal.\r Cameron feels that Foreman stole an article he knew she was working on; Foreman insists that she doesn't own House's cases. The fight has been brewing for several episodes at this point, and shows no signs of abating (in part because of Foreman's clumsy explanation that he and Cameron are colleagues and not friends). Things will come to a head in this episode. \n"}, {"text": "Temporarily stumped as to the cause of Joe's condition (now causing involuntary muscle spasms in his arms) -- and unable to do an MRI due to the metallic bullet fragments still lodged in his brain -- House employs his usual fallback plan: he instructs Foreman to break into the patient's apartment and get samples of anything suspicious. What is unusual about the apartment?", "correct": "Not only is the apartment filthy, but it also contains an illicit greenhouse of marijuana plants.", "options": ["The apartment is exceptionally filthy, filled with rotting food and even a bucket of pigeon droppings. Nothing else is unusual.", "The apartment is spotless except for the kitchen, where Foreman counts 14 distinct genuses of mold and finds evidence of rats.", "Not only is the apartment filthy, but it also contains exotic pets not strictly legal under city law, including a caged tiger."], "explanation": "\n\n\nNot only is the apartment filthy, but it also contains an illicit greenhouse of marijuana plants.\n\n\tJoe Luria is not your standard-issue law-and-order cop, at least not when it comes to his personal life -- or his side business ventures. His apartment is filthy enough to be an obvious health hazard, but his greenhouse is surprisingly clean and well-organized, including an extended sprinkler system that waters the illegal plants on a timer. Foreman brings a garbage bag of samples back to the hospital, but none seems to yield the answers the team is looking for. \n"}, {"text": "The team attempts to show Joe his improving chest X-rays -- and in the process they realize he's developed a new and disturbing symptom. What is it?", "correct": "Anton's blindness", "options": ["Glaucoma", "Ocular bleeding", "Uncontrollable weeping"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnton's blindness.\n\n\tAnton's blindness is a rare condition whose sufferers do not realize that they're blind; in fact, even when confronted with evidence of their blindness, they continue to insist that they can see. (In Joe's case, pressed for answers, he guesses wrongly what Cameron is wearing.)\r As the team continues its fruitless search for answers, Foreman becomes more and more hostile towards the hapless Joe (who had accused him earlier of having a problem with cops) -- at one point accusing him of being \"one part bully and nine parts hypocrite.\" Cameron -- who, to be fair, has harangued plenty of patients herself -- begins to be bothered by this unprofessional behavior. \n"}, {"text": "More trouble arises when Foreman starts to display the police officer's earliest symptom. What is House's first clue that something isn't right?", "correct": "Foreman laughs inappropriately when House shoots a corpse in the head.", "options": ["Foreman's hand shakes so much that he has trouble performing simple procedures.", "Foreman repeats the patient's latest test results to House -- four times.", "Foreman collapses in front of the whiteboard."], "explanation": "\n\n\nForeman laughs inappropriately when House shoots a corpse in the head.\n\n\tHouse wants desperately to do an MRI on Joe, but can't because of the bullet fragments that remain in the officer's brain -- the bullets Baby Shoes used are ferromagnetic. To see whether this is really a problem, he uses the same bullets to shoot a corpse (the body had been donated to science) and then runs the body through an MRI (the results are rather gruesome for the body and damage the machine so badly it must be shut down for two weeks of repairs). In House's words: \"Oops.\"\r The team watches House do this in the morgue. Cameron and Chase are appropriately revolted, but Foreman seems to find it funny. When he starts laughing uncontrollably on seeing Joe start to bleed from his head wound (\"Am I the only one who finds this funny?\"), it's clear that his euphoria signals something sinister. Foreman is off the case. \n"}, {"text": "Joe's mystery illness has now infected two people: himself and Foreman. Everyone fears an epidemic. Joe and Foreman are confined to the same isolation ward; the apartment is sealed off as a biohazard area. Cameron wants to go back to the apartment to get more samples and perhaps to solve the mystery, but House won't let her -- so a desperate Foreman tries an unorthodox way of persuading her to do it anyway. What does he do?", "correct": "He stabs her with a contaminated needle.", "options": ["He lies that he saw a group of children near the apartment before it was sealed off.", "He tears a gash in her biohazard suit.", "He lies that he was infected by a needle stick, and not by his visit to the apartment."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe stabs her with a contaminated needle.\n\n\tCameron is tending to Foreman in the isolation ward -- checking vital signs, updating him on the case -- when he realizes that no one is going back to the apartment. He's sure there are some places he didn't check -- the cupboard above the sink, for example -- that could contain the key piece of evidence, and he's furious that the possibility isn't being investigated. So, in a rather shocking move for a character who is normally so ethical, Foreman stabs Cameron in the leg with a contaminated needle, punching right through her biohazard suit, and tells her that now she has to go to the apartment to save herself.\r She goes, donning full biohazard gear, but does not find much of use. Her continued health, however, is a clue: it means that the mystery infection is not transmitted through the blood. \n"}, {"text": "After a few heart-to-heart chats with Foreman and one heartrending new symptom -- uncontrollable pain that persists even in a coma -- the police officer finally dies. House is ecstatic: surely the autopsy will reveal the nature of the infection! It turns out, however, that the hospital can't perform an autopsy. Why not?", "correct": "To avert an epidemic, health regulations require that the CDC handle the autopsy.", "options": ["An accident in the morgue makes the autopsy equipment unusable.", "The body is mistakenly burned as an epidemic-prevention measure before the autopsy can be done.", "Joe's family arrives and insists that autopsies are against their religious beliefs."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo avert an epidemic, health regulations require that the CDC handle the autopsy.\n\n\tFollowing regulations to the letter, Cuddy has called the CDC -- and their autopsy results are a full three days away. (It takes them hours to come to collect the body.) House tries to get Foreman to do a quick brain biopsy on his roommate, but is foiled by the appearance of Anton's blindness: Foreman biopsies the mattress, thinking that it's Joe's head. House then brings Foreman's father to Cuddy's office to plead with her, but she is unmoved; she must also, she says, think of the families that would be affected if the disease were to spread.\r In an effort to find another brain to biopsy, House takes his prized pet rat -- the one and only Steve McQueen -- to the apartment, retracing Foreman's steps as exactly as he can. As soon as Steve shows signs of euphoria (and how does one detect that in a rat, exactly?), House can kill him and autopsy him. It's a move of desperation, but Steve doesn't seem to be getting giddy ... \n"}, {"text": "Comparing Foreman's charts to Joe's, House realizes that the mystery illness is progressing much faster in Foreman than it did in Joe. Why?", "correct": "Joe had Legionnaire's disease, and Foreman doesn't.", "options": ["Joe's drug use changed pathways in his brain, making him slightly less susceptible.", "Foreman's race makes him more susceptible to this particular illness.", "Joe's exposure was slow and happened over a long time, whereas Foreman's exposure was quick and acute."], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe had Legionnaire's disease, and Foreman doesn't.\n\n\tVisiting Joe's police station earlier in the episode, House realized that the rancid filters in the air conditioning system had led to Legionnaire's disease -- and Joe worsened very quickly once the Legionnaire's was cured. Foreman, of course, doesn't have it. House now develops the hypothesis that the mystery infection isn't recognized by the body, so there's no immune response -- but the presence of Legionnaire's DOES prompt an immune response, allowing the body to fight both diseases.To buy Foreman some time, House shatters a vial of Legionella bacteria on the floor of the isolation ward, exposing him to the new disease.Naturally, he doesn't bother to obtain consent. \n"}, {"text": "Eventually, House gives Foreman a cocktail of pills to treat every infection he can think of, and for a time this reverses the progress of the mystery illness. Unfortunately, the drugs start to threaten Foreman's pancreas, and he has to be taken off them -- and then his decline is swift. Soon he'll have to be put into a coma to help manage the pain, but someone will have to make his decisions. To whom does Foreman give medical power of attorney?", "correct": "Cameron", "options": ["Chase", "House", "His father"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCameron.\n\n\tHouse assumes that Foreman's father will get medical power of attorney -- and that Mr. Foreman, not knowing much about medical matters, will then defer to House. It's a reasonable assumption! Foreman, however, wants a procedure done that House disagrees with. A white-matter brain biopsy will definitively identify his mystery illness, but it may leave him with serious and irreversible brain damage, and it is to this that House objects.Foreman, who is no fool, knows that House won't honor his wishes and that his father won't stand up to House -- so he asks Cameron, at the same time offering an apology about the article he wrote. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the episode, the situation is desperate. House tours Joe's apartment one last time, hoping to find the answer while the dangerous brain biopsy can still be avoided. What turns out to be the cause of the mystery illness?", "correct": "Naegleria fowleri, an ameba that had contaminated the water in Joe's greenhouse sprinkler system", "options": ["A tapeworm -- contained in Joe's ham sandwiches -- that made its way to the brain", "Cryptococcus bacteria that had contaminated Joe's fertilizer", "Yersinia pestis, the plague bacterium, carried by the rats in Joe's filthy apartment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNaegleria fowleri, an ameba that had contaminated the water in Joe's greenhouse sprinkler system.\n\n\tNaegleria fowleri causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis, a rare illness that is almost invariably fatal (partly because it's diagnosed so late). In the show, however, Foreman gets an extremely lucky break. Despite undergoing the dangerous white-matter brain biopsy, he awakens from his coma pain-free and with his mind mostly intact -- though he does have some lingering confusion over left and right.\r Steve McQueen, the rat whom House tried to infect, also turns out okay. It seems that Foreman was simply unlucky enough to visit the greenhouse while the sprinklers were on -- the ameba passes into the body through the nose -- and Steve, visiting at a different time of day, was safe.\r Thanks for taking the quiz on what I consider a powerfully plotted and acted episode. I hope you've enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it! \n"}]}
