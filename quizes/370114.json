{"id": "370114", "name": "Stoner Dude Online Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "The stoner dude in this flick, played by James Franco, supplied Seth Rogan's process server with a particular strain before they embroiled themselves in the inner battles of a major drug ring.  What 2008 movie was this?", "correct": "Pineapple Express", "options": ["Schnazzleberry", "Strawberry Cough", "Lucky Charms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPineapple Express.\n\n\tThe film, which got James Franco a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor for his role as Saul the dealer, ended up grossing over $100,000,000 in the box office, making it one of the most successful stoner comedies of all time.  The movie followed Rogen and Franco getting into worse and worse predicaments, all because Saul got his hands on the rare strain of marijuana-- Pineapple Express-- making both of them witnesses in a murder involving some internal affairs.  The film was directed by David Gordon Green and released in 2008; it was produced by popular film-backer Judd Apatow. \n"}, {"text": "Marlon Wayans was the stoner dude in this parody film from 2001.  Trapped in a haunted house, 'Shorty', feeding his marijuana plant, was attacked by the possessed weed and smoked up.  What was the movie?", "correct": "Scary Movie 2", "options": ["Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th", "A Haunted House", "Club Dread"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScary Movie 2.\n\n\tIn this film, a follow-up (in a sense) to the original \"Scary Movie\", but set in a haunted house instead of poking fun directly at the slasher genre, put some of the old favourites into the haunted 'Hell House' and pitted them against the horrible evil that was Hugh Kane.  Marlon Wayans' Shorty ended up facing off against his marijuana plant (and was rolled up and smoked), but he was saved by Ray, Buddy, and Brenda who, in a moment of brilliance, ended up tossing some munchies into the room to distract the monster. The Wayans Brothers didn't return for the third film in the series despite the fact that they originally conceived the series. They ended up making \"A Haunted House\" in 2013 instead. \n"}, {"text": "Dave Chappelle played the stoner dude... and rapper Sir Smoke-a-Lot... in what 1998 stoner comedy about dealers getting in trouble with a rival grower (and subsequently evoking the spirit of Jerry Garcia)?", "correct": "Half Baked", "options": ["Friday", "The Big Lebowski", "Human Traffic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalf Baked.\n\n\t\"Half Baked\", one of the more popular stoner comedies of the late nineties, was written by Chappelle years before he hit it big with his comedy show.  In the movie, he and his buddy thought up a... erm... half-baked scheme to get their friend out of jail.  Unfortunately, their decision to get into the drug-dealing business was met with a bit of ire from some of the other dealers, specifically Samson Simpson.  The movie also featured cameos by Tommy Chong (of Cheech and Chong), Willie Nelson, and Snoop Dogg. \n"}, {"text": "Method Man and Redman played stoner dudes in what 2001 stoner film about two guys who got into college after smoking the ashes of their dead friend?", "correct": "How High", "options": ["Accepted", "High Scores", "Freddy Got Fingered"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHow High.\n\n\tSure enough, the movie began with the rap duo using the ashes of their dead friend to plant marijuana.  The subsequent strain ended up giving them the power to use their deceased buddy to answer exam questions, landing them spots in the coveted Harvard University class lists.  The rest of the movie was just as outlandish-- one ended up dating the daughter of the U.S. Vice President while the other invented a truth serum in the Harvard Botany class. Despite these events, they were virtually expelled by the end of the movie, but not before succeeding on all other counts.  The movie earned over $30,000,000 but was critically panned. \n"}, {"text": "Set in the fantasy kingdom of Mourne, what 2011 stoner fantasy comedy featured Danny McBride in the role of the stoner dude as he and his brother (played by James Franco) set out to destroy the evil sorcerer, Leezar?", "correct": "Your Highness", "options": ["Extract", "This is the End", "Super High Me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYour Highness.\n\n\tAlthough this movie (directed by \"Pineapple Express\" director David Gordon Green) was a financial flop (recouping only half of its $50,000,000 budget in the box office), it certainly fit the general theme of the stoner film.  In this one, Danny McBride and James Franco set out on mystical quests as young knights, taking with them the ranger, Isabel (played by Natalie Portman), and fighting to save princess Belladonna (played by Zooey Deschanel).  Despite the big names in the cast, the movie was critically panned for its vulgar, immature humour, even resulting in a Razzie nomination. \n"}, {"text": "Seann William Scott and Ashton Kutcher were both stoner dudes in a 2000 film about lost automobiles and Continuum Transfunctioners.  What was the name of the movie?", "correct": "Dude, Where's My Car?", "options": ["Trailer Park Boys: The Movie", "Super Troopers", "Next Friday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDude, Where's My Car?.\n\n\tTaking place on a day in which friends and roommates Jesse and Chester simply couldn't find their car (it was behind a mail truck), the movie spiralled out of control shortly thereafter, sending the duo on a long-winded journey through town discovering the odd results of their previous night, trying to woo their girlfriends, and getting embroiled in a plot between two rivalling groups of aliens (one a five-some of severe women and the other a duo of Nordic skiers).  The movie became a cult classic, unsurprisingly, earning $73,000,000 in the box office and becoming a pop culture meme for a short time. Dude!  SWEET! \n"}, {"text": "While much of the movie involved dealing instead of smoking, Josh Peck played the stoner dude in what 2008 drama about a teenager and his psychiatrist dealing with personal issues?", "correct": "The Wackness", "options": ["Grandma's Boy", "50/50", "Strange Wilderness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wackness.\n\n\tMore of an indie drama than a stoner comedy, \"The Wackness\" was about a teenager going through the rigors of life as his family faced eviction, his relationships developed, and his experiences proved to him that everyone was just as out of whack as he was.  Much of the film involved Josh Peck's main character dealing drugs to support his family and get closer to his psychiatrist (played by Ben Kingsley) but, as it turned out, he was maturing more than the people around him.  The movie made over $3,000,000 in the box office and screened at Sundance. \n"}, {"text": "John Cho and Kal Penn were both stoner dudes heading out for a bite to eat in what 2004 comedy also starring Neil Patrick Harris?", "correct": "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle", "options": ["A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas", "Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay", "Harold & Kumar Take Manhattan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarold & Kumar Go to White Castle.\n\n\t\"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\" was the first in a series of movies following the exploits and adventures of Cho's Harold ad Penn's Kumar as they found themselves in increasingly absurd scenarios; in this case, the duo simply wanted to go out for food at a New Jersey White Castle.  Later movies in the series saw the two escape from the maximum security prison in Cuba and burning down a very important Christmas tree (which, in retrospect, doesn't seem as risque).  All three movies also featured Neil Patrick Harris playing a more chauvinistic, hardcore version of himself. The original \"Harold & Kumar\" was a cult hit (resulting in the next two films) and it earned $23,000,000.  Director Danny Leiner also made \"Dude, Where's My Car?\". \n"}, {"text": "Both Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith were stoner dudes in what 2001 movie following the pair's decision to claim the royalties of their 'Bluntman and Chronic' superhero brand?", "correct": "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back", "options": ["Dogma", "Clerks II", "Mallrats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJay and Silent Bob Strike Back.\n\n\tWhile the Jay and Silent Bob characters appeared in several movies in Smith's View Askewniverse series (including the incorrect answers to this question), the fifth in the succession featured them explicitly as the stars.  In fact, \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" featured many characters from prior movies directed by Smith reaching as far back as \"Clerks\".  This movie followed Jay and Silent Bob's trip across the United States to Hollywood to infiltrate production of their 'Bluntman and Chronic' movie and claim the royalties they believed were theirs. Along the way they ended up becoming wanted men, met with a group of diamond thieves, stole an orangutan, and, of course, smoked up. \n"}, {"text": "In this 2006 musical comedy, Jack Black and Kyle Gass took on the stoner dude roles in an attempt to claim a prized musical device which would, of course, summon the devil.  What was the film's name?", "correct": "Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny", "options": ["Fast Times at Ridgemont High", "Detroit Rock City", "Dazed and Confused"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.\n\n\tBased on the duo's earlier \"Tenacious D\" TV show, \"The Pick of Destiny\" followed the origins of the comedy rock band known for their epic riffs and hardcore musical stylings.  In the movie, JB and KG united themselves upon meeting each other on a Los Angeles boardwalk and decided to set out to collect the Pick of Destiny, known for summoning Satan himself (played by Dave Grohl) and, possibly, instilling the user with supranatural (yes, that's the word) abilities to rock with, making them unparalleled hard rock stars. Different obstacles ended up in their way, forcing them to test their friendship time and time again, but a meeting with the Devil was ultimately had. The movie ended up flopping in theaters. \n"}]}
