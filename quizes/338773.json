{"id": "338773", "name": "\"Special Education\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "Will, having two tickets for Sectionals, decides to give one of them to whom?", "correct": "Emma", "options": ["Terri", "Sue", "Beiste"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmma.\n\n\tIn the staff room, Will asks Emma to come along for the Glee Club's trip to Sectionals because last year she seemed to be a good luck charm for them.  He rephrases that however, because they don't really need luck with the setlist he has planned.  Emma tries to guess his setlist plans saying that he'll start with Finn and Rachel singing a ballad, move into a group classic rock number, and end with Mercedes hitting a high note. She turns out to be right and says that Will's numbers are great...they're just predictable.  The problem is that so many of the kids are talented and he only highlights the brightest stars for competition. New Directions used to be underdogs, but now that they're favourites going into Sectionals, they need to step up their game and prove that they're not retreading old ground.  Will can't agree more when he thinks about it. \n"}, {"text": "As a change of pace, Will has which two club members open their Sectionals performance?", "correct": "Sam and Quinn", "options": ["Artie and Tina", "Puck and Mercedes", "Mike and Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam and Quinn.\n\n\tWhen Will goes to the choir room to inform the kids about the changes, Rachel says that she's chosen the perfect ballad for herself and Finn.  Will stops her there.  First, he announces that he will be bringing Mike and Brittany to the forefront to showcase their dance moves because their competition, typical high school choirs, don't tend to move at this stage of the game. In addition, neither Rachel nor Mercedes will be singing the typical opening number.  Instead, the winners of the duets competition, Sam and Quinn, will be opening the show.  Rachel is frustrated by this change and asks Finn to do something about it.  When he opens his mouth, he's called out for being hypocritical and Santana finally reveals that she and Finn slept together the year before, shocking Rachel. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Warblers' mascot?", "correct": "Pavarotti", "options": ["Buble", "Grobin", "Barbra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPavarotti.\n\n\tKurt walks through the halls of Dalton Academy and arrives at his first meeting for their glee club, the Dalton Academy Warblers.  Upon his arrival, the boys introduce Kurt to their mascot, a canary by the name of Pavarotti, who is handed off to the club's newest member.  It's the newest member's job to take care of it and preserve this symbol of their voice.  Kurt makes a joke about cats and a coal mine which doesn't go over well and they get to the business of their Sectionals performance.  Kurt is enthusiastic about the choices to be made, but he soon discovers that seniority plays a big role in the decisions that are put into motion.\rIn Emma's office, Finn tells the truth to Rachel and she remains hung up over who it was he slept with rather than the fact that he did it.  Unfortunately, Emma is hardly a therapist and the session doesn't really go too well.  It ends with Emma suggesting that Rachel storm out...and she does. \n"}, {"text": "Brittany finds herself afraid to dance at Sectionals.  What does Artie give to her to make her feel better?", "correct": "A 'magic' comb", "options": ["Flowers", "Ruby slippers", "A kiss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA 'magic' comb.\n\n\tArtie finds Brittany standing in a darkened classroom and when he approaches her, she says that she's been paralyzed with fear since second period.  It turns out that while she knows she's better than everyone else in Glee Club (thanks to Britney Spears) she still doesn't want the weight of the competition on her shoulders.  Artie suggests that he can give her his magic comb which, when used to comb one's hair, makes it so you can't lose.  She accepts and calls him the best boyfriend ever.\rMr. Schue brings Puck to his office for a quick talk.  Since Kurt is no longer at McKinley, New Directions is down one member it needs to reach the minimum for show choir competitions.  Since Puck is known by everyone in the school, he can use his power to sway at least one new member into joining in time for Sectionals.  Puck accepts his new ambassador role.\rAt Dalton, Blaine talks to Kurt about his ideas at Glee Club and says that they reward people with enthusiasm.  He suggests that he try out for a solo for Sectionals. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these was a condition for Lauren joining New Directions?", "correct": "A carton of Cadbury eggs", "options": ["A bag of gummi bears", "A box of cinnamon hearts", "A chocolate advent calendar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA carton of Cadbury eggs.\n\n\tPuck tries to recruit some of the kids from the football team and it doesn't go anywhere.  The guys insult him instead and 'make an example of him'.\rIn the choir room, the kids can't seem to find Puck.  Some start to assume that he's bailing since they're already down a member while others decide to get angry at the competition.  Rachel comes in with a piece of tape across her mouth in protest.  Will gets angry with all of them saying that Rachel is being a poor sport and they're all being selfish- there's too much 'me' talk and not enough teamwork.  Puck comes in soon after having been found by Lauren Zises in a port-a-potty.  It turns out he was trapped inside for twenty-four hours by the football team.  The next day, Lauren found him inside and saved him.  He decided to ask her to join New Directions and she said yes on the condition that he find a carton of Cadbury eggs (which aren't in season) and provide her with seven minutes in heaven on the school grounds.  He claims that she rocked his world (much to Santana's disgust and everyone's surprise).  Nevertheless, Puck pulled through and found the necessary twelfth member. \n"}, {"text": "Does Kurt get to sing a solo for Sectionals?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn the school halls, Santana pesters Rachel with more tidbits about her night with Finn and Puck comes across Rachel watching Finn from afar.  Noting that boyfriend troubles are abound, he offers to help because he prayed to God in the port-a-potty and said he'd help other Jewish people if he got out.  They decide to walk together.  Tina speaks with Artie about the possibility that Mike and Brittany might be having an affair but Artie seems confident that nothing's happening; they're just rehearsing together.  Later, Artie tries to talk to Brittany, but she seems oddly stand-offish.\rIn the auditorium, Kurt comes by to speak to Rachel about ballad suggestions.  While she's initially worried he might be spying, she realizes it might be one of her only chances to do a solo for a while.  Kurt originally wants to do do Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\", but she sways him into singing \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\" from \"Evita\", a song she wants for her funeral.  While Rachel performs it for Kurt in the auditorium, he sings it for the Warblers.  Unfortunately, he doesn't get the solo.  Kurt is initially chuffed by his loss, but Blaine assures him he'll fit in.  Being a part of the Warblers means being a part of the team. \n"}, {"text": "What is notable about the show choir known as The Hipsters?", "correct": "There are no high school students in the group.", "options": ["They all wear tie-dyed outfits.", "They're comprised of students from alternative 'hippie' learning communities.", "There are no women in their choir."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThere are no high school students in the group.\n\n\tSoon, New Directions starts boarding the bus to Sectionals and Will is disappointed with his recent plans for the kids as it's made them all feel horrible.  He tells Emma that he's never seem them this bad going into a performance.  When he asks if they're ready to go, Emma says that she isn't.  She didn't tell Carl about the invite and after speaking with Finn and Rachel, she decided that she couldn't hold the truth from him any longer.  Emma wishes them good luck, kisses Will gently on the cheek, and departs.\rAt Sectionals, Kurt finds Rachel demanding a snack bar vendor to find her some Raisinettes (for Lauren).  He lets her know he didn't get the solo and she says if they don't need Kurt's voice, then New Directions is most certainly doomed.  They take the time to chat together because both of them are on such an odd wavelength.  Kurt, for example, feels like the Warblers don't want to embrace his individuality.  It also turns out that Rachel may have been the only one not to know about the whole truth about sleeping with Santana.\rEveryone takes their seats in the auditorium for the first Glee Club performance by the Hipsters, a show choir comprised entirely of elderly people continuing their education.  While they sing Mike & The Mechanics' \"The Living Years\", New Directions witnesses a creepy mirror into the future (an elderly black woman even belts out the last note like Mercedes).  It's weird. \n"}, {"text": "What does Brittany admit to when she speaks with Artie in the greenroom?", "correct": "Adultery", "options": ["Poking her cat while it's eating", "Plagiarizing", "Not being afraid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdultery.\n\n\tAfter the Hipsters hit the stage, the Warblers perform their acapella version of Train's \"Hey, Soul Sister\" with Blaine leading the pack.  New Directions watches Kurt in his new group (although he seems a bit out of place).  Rachel makes the motion for him to smile from the crowd.  Although they originally said they wouldn't, New Directions begins a standing ovation for their competition.  As Will said earlier, it's just who they are.  In the greenroom before their performance, Puck approaches Lauren while she complains about her dress, Sam consoles Quinn who, last time she performed, went into labour, and Artie confronts Brittany about her adultery (which she admits to and apologizes for).  Rachel finds out that everyone knew about the night with Santana and Finn tells her that she has no right to be angry because she was with Jesse at the time.  He shouldn't have lied, but that's not why she's angry.\rWhen everyone starts refusing to go on stage, Will tells them that enough is enough.  This time last year, everyone seemed without hope, but they pulled together and won because they did it together.  Soon, it's showtime. \n"}, {"text": "Which New Directions member sings \"Valerie\" during Sectionals?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Quinn", "Mercedes", "Tina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\tBackstage, Brittany talks to Artie.  He asks why she cheated on him, but she claims that she didn't.  When he mentioned adultery, she said she committed it because she thought 'adultery' meant she acted stupid, like being adult.  She didn't cheat on him.  She lost his 'magic' comb.  She's been avoiding him because she felt so bad.  Artie tells her that he found the comb on the ground and was on his way to throwing it out- it was never 'magic'- she doesn't need magic.  He assures her that she'll win them first place because she is magic.  She says that when she's dancing on stage it won't be for the team or the crowd, it'll be for him.\rpuck finds Lauren doing push-ups behind the stage and asks what she's doing.  She explains that since she's a wrestler, it's how she gets pumped up for a tournament.  He explains that she doesn't need to be nervous, but she says she's not; show choir is stupid.\rSoon, the kids begin their performance.  Starting at the top of the theater, Sam and Quinn commence with a rendition of \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" from \"Dirty Dancing\".  When they reach the stage, the others come out and join their duet.  Immediately thereafter, they kick it into an up-tempo rendition of The Zutons' \"Valerie\" with Santana on lead vocals and Mike and Brittany performing their choreographed dance routine.  The number brings the crowd to their feet. \n"}, {"text": "Which team wins Sectionals?", "correct": "It's a tie", "options": ["New Directions", "The Hipsters", "The Warblers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's a tie.\n\n\tWhen results time comes around, the awards are presented.  Third place goes to the Hipsters but when it comes to first place and the runners-up, it turns out that the Warblers and New Directions are tied.  Both will be going to Regionals.\rWhen Will brings the trophy to Emma's office the next week, she reveals that she and Carl went to Vegas and got married, spur of the moment.  Will says that he's happy for her and leaves it at that.  Rachel and Finn talk before class- she says that somewhere along the way, she lost the mantra of 'being a part of something special makes you special'.  Finn asks if they're a part of something special and she says yes.  Before they can make up, she decides to tell him the truth to make things right.  When she was angry with him, she and Puck went to her place and made out.  Puck decided that he couldn't go through with it and left.  Finn decides that he can't be with her; what she did was mean, especially since they were together when it happened.\rKurt and Blaine a happy with their win at Sectionals, but Kurt is worried about Pavarotti (who seems to be molting).  Both he and Pavarotti will, hopefully, be singing again in no time.\rNew Directions is thrilled with their win although others are concerned with their own personal dramas.  New Directions is still together.  Will suggests they celebrate with a song the best way they know how and asks Rachel to lead them into a song, but she defers the role to two of the group's unsung (as of late) heroes, Mercedes and Tina.  When they head to the auditorium, they sing Florence + The Machine's \"Dog Days are Over\".  Kurt watches over Pavarotti at Dalton Academy and thinks optimistically, Emma thinks about her marriage with Carl, Rachel empties her locker of Finn, and New Directions freely on stage before a group hug. \n"}]}
