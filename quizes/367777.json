Who started this fad is hotly debated, as is where the fad started. There were even claims that this silly activity increased the levels of iron in the blood.\r Adults at the time attempted to stop this fad by claiming that the students could die from tapeworms contracted from the goldfish. In today's world, animal rights activists would be screaming about animal cruelty. I wonder if they are easier to swallow than a fish oil capsule? \n"}, {"text": "Which one of the following options was the \"pet\" of choice for many hardheaded folks in the 1970s?", "correct": "Rocks", "options": ["Pillows", "Apples", "Hoses", "Rocks "], "explanation": "\n\n\nRocks.\n\n\tIn early 1975, California advertising executive Gary Dahl came up with the idea of gluing little eyes and some hair on rocks and selling them as \"pet rocks\".

His hard-headedness and determination took a simple idea a turned it into a cultural icon for that decade. \n"}, {"text": "The ancient practice of Stylitism and the former sailor Alvin \"Shipwreck\" Kelly (1893-1952) are credited with contributing to which of the following activities which became a popular stunt in the early parts of the 20th century?", "correct": "Sitting atop a flagpole", "options": ["Going over Niagara Falls in a barrel", "Getting shot out of a cannon", "Skydiving from blimps"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSitting atop a flagpole.\n\n\tFlagpole sitting was very popular during the 1920s and is related to the ancient discipline of Stylitism, also known as column-sitting.

This style of dressing is definitely not one of her creations.\r Where this style came from is not really known, but some believe that it may have started as a prison style in the U.S. This term refers to the practice wearing pants that are too big and wearing them so low that your underwear is visible, or occasionally parts of a bare bottom.

But it does sound like something out of a \"James Bond\" movie...don't you think? \n"}]}
