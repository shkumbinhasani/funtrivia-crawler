{"id": "53514", "name": "How to Fly Old Glory Quiz | Flags and Symbols | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Flags and Symbols", " Flags of the USA"], "questions": [{"text": "You're flying the U.S. flag vertically, hanging it from your window down the side of your building. Where should the 'union' (the blue field of stars) be if you're standing in front of the flag admiring your handiwork?", "correct": "Upper left", "options": ["Upper right", "Lower right", "Lower left"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUpper left.\n\n\tThe union should always be in the upper left-hand corner, whether it's hanging vertically or horizontally. The flag is never flown upside-down (with the union at either bottom corner) except as a distress signal. \n"}, {"text": "You're planning a political function, and you want the speaker's podium to look suitably patriotic. What's a correct way to decorate the podium and the stage?", "correct": "With red, white and blue-striped bunting, blue stripe on top.", "options": ["With an American flag wrapped around the speaker.", "With an American flag covering the podium.", "With red, white and blue-striped bunting, white stripe on top."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith red, white and blue-striped bunting, blue stripe on top.\n\n\tThe flag isn't supposed to be used as decoration - only as a dignified symbol. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not an occasion for flying a U.S. flag at half staff?", "correct": "Your attractive next-door neighbor has moved away.", "options": ["A prominent government leader has died.", "It's the morning of Memorial Day.", "The President or Governor has ordered it."], "explanation": "\n\n\nYour attractive next-door neighbor has moved away.\n\n\tOn the morning of Memorial Day every year, the flag is flown at half staff in memory of fallen soldiers, and is then flown at full staff between noon and sundown. \n"}, {"text": "You're flying an American flag at half staff for a time of mourning. During this grieving period, does the flag ever rise to full staff?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tTo raise a flag to the half staff position, you must first raise it to the top of the flagpole, then lower it to the halfway mark. It should be raised again, for a moment, just before it is lowered. \n"}, {"text": "You're displaying the US flag on the same flagpole as the flag of your state. Where should the US flag be?", "correct": "At the top of the pole, just above the state flag", "options": ["Just below the state flag", "On a different flagpole - it can't be flown on the same pole as a state flag", "Above or below the state flag, depending on whether the state voted for the current President"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt the top of the pole, just above the state flag.\n\n\tWhen in doubt, place the US flag in the position of greatest honor - generally towards the right and as high as possible. \n"}, {"text": "You're displaying the US flag on the same flagpole as the flag of another country. Where should the US flag be?", "correct": "On a different flagpole - it can't be flown from the same pole as another national flag.", "options": ["Above or below the other flag, depending on whether the other nation belongs to NATO.", "At the top of the pole, just above the other flag.", "Just below the other flag."], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn a different flagpole - it can't be flown from the same pole as another national flag.\n\n\tBecause nations are supposed to be equally independent, no flag of one country can be in a greater position than another. When the flags of different countries are displayed together, they should be of the same size, and at the same height on different flagpoles. The flags must all be raised and lowered at the same time. \n"}, {"text": "It looks like there's about to be a rainstorm in your area, and the American flag flying outside your house is plain cotton instead of an all-weather version. What should you do?", "correct": "Lower it. An ordinary cotton flag should not be flown in the rain.", "options": ["Nothing. The flag should only be lowered at sunset.", "Nothing. The flag should fly proudly at all times.", "Make sure it's well-anchored, so that it won't fall and hit the ground."], "explanation": "\n\n\nLower it. An ordinary cotton flag should not be flown in the rain.\n\n\tAs a sign of respect, the flag should not be flown in the rain or at night (however, it may be flown at night if it is properly illuminated). This rule is much less strict than the others, and military installations will fly the flag all day (they may fly a special, smaller \"storm flag\" during inclement weather, or may take down the flag entirely during severe weather such as a hurricane). According to the U.S. Flag Code, non-all-weather flags are not to be flown outside during inclement weather. Thanks to bilig and to Jpstod for the corrections! \n"}, {"text": "You are at a baseball game as the national anthem is played. A large U.S. flag is flying to your left; to your right, the players are standing and the music is playing. Which way should you face?", "correct": "Towards the flag at the left.", "options": ["Towards the players at the right, since they're in the closest thing to military uniform.", "Towards the music at the right.", "Straight ahead."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTowards the flag at the left.\n\n\tWhen no flag is displayed, you should stand facing the music while the national anthem is played. \n"}, {"text": "When people are buried with military honors, the American flags draping their caskets are buried with them.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhile the flag is still on the lid of the casket, the union is placed over the left shoulder of the deceased, but the flag is not lowered into the grave with the casket. Instead, it is ritually folded into a triangle (with the union visible on top) by the military honor guard present at the funeral, and is presented to the chief mourner. It is a beautiful and moving ceremony. \n"}, {"text": "When the U.S. flag has become so worn and faded that it should no longer be displayed, what is the preferred method of destroying it?", "correct": "It should be burned in a dignified way.", "options": ["It should be ceremonially buried.", "It shouldn't be destroyed; take it to a military base for recycling.", "It doesn't matter; it can just be taken out with the trash."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt should be burned in a dignified way.\n\n\tOutposts of the American Legion hold regular flag-burning ceremonies, often on Flag Day (June 14th). You can usually contact them for disposal of worn flags. Thank you for playing! \n"}]}
