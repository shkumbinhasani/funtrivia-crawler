{"id": "350630", "name": "Oh My Kodkod! Multiple Choice Quiz | Carnivores | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "Carnivores", "Felidae-Cat Family"], "questions": [{"text": "Kodkod is not the only name this wild cat goes by.  What is another name for the kodkod?", "correct": "Guina", "options": ["Guinea", "Gonna", "Guyana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuina.\n\n\tThe kodkod is a small wild cat (many domestic cats are bigger) of the Americas.  It is often called the gui\u00f1a, which translates to 'witchcraft' or 'bad luck'. \n"}, {"text": "The habitat of a kodkod is very limited.  In which South American country is the majority of the kodkod's habitat range?", "correct": "Chile", "options": ["Guyana", "Ecuador", "Brazil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChile.\n\n\tBrazil might be huge, but the kodkod's habitat does not typically reach that far.  The majority of the kodkod's range is in southern Chile, which is why it is often called the \"Chilean cat\".  Its habitat also extends into Argentina a little ways, but for the most part the kodkod lives in Chile. \n"}, {"text": "Like most vulnerable animals, the kodkod is slowly becoming extinct due to habitat loss.  However, another interesting issue has caused the kodkod's decline.  What is another reason for the cat's decrease in population?", "correct": "Its natural food source is diminishing", "options": ["Hurricanes wiped out entire populations", "Trees are being cut down, destroying kodkod homes", "Puma populations increase, and kodkods are easy prey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIts natural food source is diminishing.\n\n\tThe kodkod actually is most prevalent in southern Chile because of the lack of larger predators that would compete with the kodkod for food, or otherwise eat the kodkod itself.  In fact, one of the biggest issues in the decline of the kodkod is the diminishing food source.  As a kodkod's prey decreases in population, the kodkod's food source is therefore reduced.  Without the main prey of the kodkod in the region, it has nothing to eat!\r Logging also has a great impact on the kodkod's declining rate, due to its habitat being destroyed. \n"}, {"text": "The kodkod is a special wild cat, as it has a record, so to speak, that belongs to it alone.  What is so special about the kodkod?", "correct": "It is the smallest wild cat in the Americas", "options": ["It is the largest wild cat in South America", "It is the only wild cat found on all seven continents", "It is the only wild cat not found in any zoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is the smallest wild cat in the Americas.\n\n\tThe kodkod is special because it is the smallest of any wild cat in the Americas (though there are smaller wild cats elsewhere in the world). It also has the smallest spread of any of the North or South American wild cats, ranging in only a small part of Chile and Argentina. \n"}, {"text": "Melanistic kodkods with black fur and blacker spots are extremely rare; but albino all white kodkods are actually quite common.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, albino white kodkods are very rare, and black kodkods are fairly common. Similar to jaguars and panthers, a melanistic kodkod is not actually all black; rather, it is a very dark gray with dark spots, so it appears solid black until you get close. \n"}, {"text": "The kodkod was once considered to be in the same genus as what other double-named feline of South America?", "correct": "Colocolo", "options": ["Dikdik", "Dodo", "Huet-huet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColocolo.\n\n\tThe colocolo is another small cat of South America that lives in the Andean mountains, though the distribution is a far more extensive than the kodkod.  Conservation status of the colocolo, however, is not known.\r The dikdik is actually a type of small deer, the huet-huet is a South American bird that the kodkod feeds on, and, of course, the dodo is an extinct flightless bird of Mauritius. \n"}, {"text": "Despite the name, the kodkod does not actually feed on cod.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe kodkod is not a fish-eating cat.  In fact, the kodkod feeds mostly on birds, though this source of prey is not very abundant in the kodkod's natural habitat.  The birds they feed on, however, are quite abundant elsewhere; but that doesn't help the kodkod any, since they don't tend to live where the kodkod does. \n"}, {"text": "The kodkod lives in a mountainous region, but will generally not travel above 6,200 feet (1,900 meters).  Why is that?", "correct": "This is the treeline, and the kodkod does not like to be exposed", "options": ["The mountains don't go any higher than 6,200 feet", "The air becomes extremely thin at this altitude", "Kodkods actually prefer not to go BELOW 6,200 feet."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThis is the treeline, and the kodkod does not like to be exposed.\n\n\tThe treeline of the Andean mountain range in southern Chile is approximately 6,200 feet, or 1,900 meters.  Trees refuse to grow beyond this point, and therefore, the kodkod refuses to travel any higher up the mountain.  The kodkod would prefer to stay sheltered by the forests than travel through the open, barren landscape. \n"}, {"text": "Kodkods are only able to give birth to one kitten at a time.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSome wild cats (such as tigers and jaguars) are only able to birth one kitten at a time, and twins are extremely rare.  However, the kodkod is different, because an average litter size is one to three, so twins and even triplets are common. \n"}, {"text": "There is an alternate spelling to \"kodkod\".  What is it?", "correct": "Codcod", "options": ["Kawdkawd", "Qodqod", "Kudkud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCodcod.\n\n\tThe kodkod is also often spelled as codcod, though it still has absolutely nothing to do with fish.  It is not spelled as \"qodqod\", however (though it may be deceiving since there is a cat, kat, and qat!).\r Hopefully, someday, conservation can bring the kodkod back to being a thriving population, and I hope that perhaps this quiz has opened the general population to such an interesting and unique cat. \n"}]}
