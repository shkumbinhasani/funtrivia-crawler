Which song did he perform?", "correct": "Razzle-Dazzle", "options": ["All That Jazz", "None of These", "Mr. Cellophane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRazzle-Dazzle.\n\n\t\"Jazz\" is the great opening number; it's performed by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zelwegger. \"Mr. Cellophane\" is a nice number, too -  but it's not by Gere. The movie doesn't have much of a plot, but it's fun to watch. \n"}, {"text": "Who co-starred with Gere in \"Sommersby\"?", "correct": "Jodie Foster", "options": ["Farrah Fawcett", "Kim Basinger", "Renee Zelwegger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJodie Foster.\n\n\tFawcett was with Gere in \"Dr. T. & the Women\". Basinger was with him in \"Final Analysis\"; Zelwegger was with him in \"Chicago\". It's a curious (and somewhat flat) movie. \n"}, {"text": "Gere starred in \"Mothman Prophecies\". Where did the mothman occurrences supposedly take place?", "correct": "West Virginia", "options": ["Nevada", "Idaho", "Maine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWest Virginia.\n\n\tThe story - which is said to be fact-based - deals with incidents that are said to have happened in West Virginia.

Where is the club located?", "correct": "New York City", "options": ["Miami", "Chicago", "Los Angeles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York City.\n\n\tBack in the Speakeasy days of the roaring 20's, there was \"The Cotton Club\" in New York City.
