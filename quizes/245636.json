{"id": "245636", "name": "Top Movies of 1980 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1980s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "One of the great films in American cinematic history, 'Raging Bull' garnered Robert De Niro a well deserved Best Actor Oscar.  What boxer did Mr. De Niro play in this excellent black and white film that helped usher in the 1980s?", "correct": "Jake LaMotta", "options": ["Jack Dempsey", "Rocky Marciano", "Chuck Wepner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJake LaMotta.\n\n\tThough De Niro won his acting Oscar, and Thelma Schoonmaker won for editing, 'Raging Bull' failed to win Oscars in any other category, including Best Picture and Best Director (a robbery, methinks).  De Niro's Oscar was well-deserved, if for no other reason than the actor put on 60 pounds at one point to play an older LaMotta. \n"}, {"text": "My personal favorite of the series, 'The Empire Strikes Back' was the second installment of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy.  Which of these popular 'Star Wars' characters was *not* newly introduced in this magnificent sequel of 1980?", "correct": "Jabba the Hut", "options": ["Yoda", "Boba Fett", "Lando"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJabba the Hut.\n\n\tWhile we get our first glimpses of the Jedi master Yoda, Han Solo's slick old pal Lando and the ruthless bounty hunter Boba Fett, Jabba the Hut would have to wait until 'The Return of the Jedi' to make his big (and I do mean big) debut.  Of course, George Lucas manipulated things with the revamped DVD releases, adding in a Jabba the Hut scene into the original 1977 'Star Wars', but that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this quiz. \n"}, {"text": "'Here's Johnny!'  Who can forget that immortal line uttered by the deranged Jack Nicholson character in the 1980 horror film 'The Shining'?  Certainly not me!  What legendary director impeccably brought this excellent film to the big screen?", "correct": "Stanley Kubrick", "options": ["David Lean", "Alfred Hitchcock", "Fred Zinneman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStanley Kubrick.\n\n\tSpeaking of Oscar snubs, let's talk about Stanley Kubrick.  Not only did he never win a Best Director or Best Screenplay Oscar, his films never won for Best Picture.  Take heart though, Kubrick fans, he did win a single Oscar for Best Visual Effects for 1968's '2001: A Space Odyssey'.\r Speaking of awards, 'The Shining' failed to gain a single Oscar nomination, and in fact it was nominated for two Razzie Awards for Worst Actress and Worst Director.  It's always heartening for layfolk to see such things, it lets us know how little the film industry really understands its own product. \n"}, {"text": "The late 70s and early 80s were a period of blossoming for the Australian film industry.  Take 'Breaker Morant', for example, a well-directed film that stands the test of time.  During what war does this interesting drama take place?", "correct": "Boer War", "options": ["Korean War", "World War I", "World War II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoer War.\n\n\t'Breaker Morant' is directed by Bruce Beresford, who went on to make such Hollywood films as 'Crimes of the Heart' and 'Driving Miss Daisy'.  It tells the story of a kangaroo court martial of three low-level Australian military officers, who are forced to take the blame for the murder of some Boer prisoners.  It really deserves to be watched! \n"}, {"text": "A deformed 19th-century British man goes from living miserably as a member of a circus freakshow to a life of measured respectability, though, because of his unbelievable disfigurement, he is never really able to fit into society.  What film of 1980 tells this stunning story?", "correct": "The Elephant Man", "options": ["The Doctor", "Mask", "The Man Without a Face"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Elephant Man.\n\n\t'The Elephant Man' is a truly remarkable achievement for director David Lynch and lead actor John Hurt.  Lynch, as per usual, delivers a beautifully filmed masterpiece that eschews subtlety, laying it all out for us to see.  For his part, John Hurt endured a tortuous make-up schedule in order to look the part of John Merrick (his real name was Joseph, incidentally), the famed 'Elephant Man' of 19th-century England.  Speaking of make-up, the Academy Award for Best Make-Up did not exist until the year after this film was made, a crying shame! \n"}, {"text": "One of the last films by Akira Kurosawa, this breathtaking epic tells the story of one of the great periods of Japanese history, when warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu takes control of the Japanese government, but in microcosm, focusing on a thief who replaces another warlord vying for power against Tokugawa.  Filled with intrigue, drama and big war scenes, what is this Oscar-nominated 1980 film?", "correct": "Kagemusha", "options": ["Insaaf Ka Tarazu", "Divine Madness", "Red Beard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKagemusha.\n\n\tThe Japanese word 'kagemusha' literally means 'shadow warrior', and has come to mean 'impersonator'.  Fittingly, the main character, the thief, impersonates the warlord Shingen, who has died.  He is generally successful in fooling those around him, including the warlord's concubines.  \r In the final battle scene, Kurosawa used 5,000 extras, making it one of the largest battle scenes in movie history. \n"}, {"text": "John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd teamed up cinematically for the first time in 1980, with expectedly spectacular results, appearing in the 1980 film 'The Blues Brothers'.  In what city and its metropolitan confines does this riotous action/comedy/musical take place?", "correct": "Chicago", "options": ["New York", "New Orleans", "Memphis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChicago.\n\n\tThe movie 'The Blues Brothers' is based on an act created by Aykroyd and Belushi on 'Saturday Night Live' a couple of years prior.  Directed by John Landis, it features a stellar cast, including the then-unknown Paul Reubens (aka Pee Wee Herman) in a bit part, and many famous rhythm and blues performers, such as Ray Charles, James Brown, Aretha Franklin and John Lee Hooker.  The music is excellent, the story hilarious and the action exhilerating.  If you haven't seen it, now's the time! \n"}, {"text": "What classic Hollywood star appears in the film 'Atlantic City' as an aging, low-level gangster, who has romantic visions of the past and exciting delusions about the future?", "correct": "Burt Lancaster", "options": ["William Holden", "Glenn Ford", "Kirk Douglas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurt Lancaster.\n\n\tBurt Lancaster is really charming in this 1980 film directed by Louis Malle.  Not his last film, but perhaps his last great film, Lancaster shows in 'Atlantic City' why he is considered one of the best.  Susan Sarandon also appears in this film, to predictably impactful effect.  Her character lives next door to the Lancaster character, and the two form a friendship that eventually blossoms into romance.  Take a look at this film if you haven't seen it yet. \n"}, {"text": "'The Long Good Friday' is an excellent, overlooked film about a big-time British gangster who is attempting to 'go legit' with the help of American mafia money.  What British actor plays the lead role of Harold Shand in this movie about the dying days of traditional organized crime?", "correct": "Bob Hoskins", "options": ["Gary Oldman", "Anthony Hopkins", "Peter Sellers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob Hoskins.\n\n\tIn a virtuoso performance by Bob Hoskins, the audience is swept into late 70s London, where the time for old-style mobsters is running out.  Helen Mirren also shows off her acting chops in her role as the gangster's moll.  This film now goes under the radar, but should not be overlooked.  Find it and see it if you have the means! \n"}, {"text": "A family, consisting of father Donald Sutherland, mother Mary Tyler Moore and son Timothy Hutton, are still coming to terms with the death of another son, with varying degrees of success.  Compounding the problem is a rift that has appeared between the Moore and Hutton characters, making life difficult for everyone.  What Robert Redford-directed film is described here? ", "correct": "Ordinary People", "options": ["On Golden Pond", "Terms of Endearment", "The Deer Hunter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrdinary People.\n\n\t'Ordinary People' won the Best Picture Oscar for 1980, and garnered Redford a Best Director Oscar to boot.  Amazingly, this was Redford's first film as a director!  Timothy Hutton also won for Best Supporting Actor (whatever happened to that guy?), and Mary Tyler Moore was nominated (Best Actress) along with Judd Hirsch (Best Supporting Actor).  Beware however, as good as this film is, it is also very depressing!\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it.  Please feel free to let me know what your top 10 list is from 1980. \n"}]}
