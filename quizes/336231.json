What play does he say he's seeing?", "correct": "The Sound of Music", "options": ["The Phantom of the Opera", "Chicago", "Cabaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sound of Music.\n\n\tThis episode begins with Finn at home making himself a grilled cheese sandwich on his George Foreman grill.  When he opens the appliance he finds that his meal has burnt to depict what looks like Jesus Christ and he dubs his meal 'Grilled Cheesus'.  Rather than eat the son of God he decides to pray to his food that they'll win their first football game for Artie's sake.  In return, he'll ask that God be honoured in Glee Club that week.  When they win, he has no choice but to follow up on his promise.\rAt Burt's auto shop, Kurt brings his dad his healthy breakfast and he is informed that Finn and Carol will be coming by for dinner.  Kurt says he can't attend, though; \"The Sound of Music\" is being performed at a local theater.  Burt is disappointed that Kurt doesn't want to spend time on Fridays with the family. \n"}, {"text": "Which New Directions member sings \"Only the Good Die Young\"?", "correct": "Puck", "options": ["Finn", "Mercedes", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuck.\n\n\tFinn follows through and suggests that everyone pay tribute to Jesus through music.  Quinn and Mercedes are both up for the idea (Mercedes being a church-goer and Quinn turning to God when she was pregnant) but Rachel and Puck, who are both Jewish, are hesitant and Kurt, outright, says no.  Mr. Schuester decides that people can sing about spirituality instead and Puck claims that he seeks his spirituality without turning to Jesus.  He decides to continue his Jewish artists streak by singing Billy Joel's \"Only the Good Die Young\" for everyone on his guitar.  Rather than join in, Kurt sits in the back of the class and plays with his phone.\rAt the auto shop, Burt serves a customer and soon finds himself in pain.  When he collapses to the floor, it turns out he's having a heart attack.  Will and Emma inform Kurt and bring him to the hospital. \n"}, {"text": "Mercedes sings Whitney Houston's \"I Look to You\" during this episode.  Who sings backing vocals?", "correct": "Quinn and Tina", "options": ["Santana and Rachel", "Rachel and Quinn", "Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn and Tina.\n\n\tFinn speaks to Grilled Cheesus again.  This time, he asks the sandwich if he can get to second base with Rachel.\rAt the hospital, the doctor informs Kurt that Burt is in a coma and that there is no other news to be received yet.  He spends time alone in his father's room but finds his dad unresponsive.  At school, everyone expresses their sympathies for Kurt while Finn is angry because he feels like he was the last to know.  Finn is also angry because he feels like Burt is as close as he has to a father.  Kurt doesn't want people to console him, though.\rMercedes says that she'd been trying to express how she feels to Kurt all day, but instead she decided to sing about it.  With Quinn and Tina backing her, she decides to perform Whitney Houston's \"I Look to You\", but again, Kurt is off-put by her gesture as he doesn't believe in God.  He thanks them for their thoughts, but not their prayers. \n"}, {"text": "Rachel doesn't want her kids to follow any organized religion.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSue is angry...as usual.  In Principal Figgins' office, she argues that Will should not teach about spirituality because there should be a separation between church and state.  Figgins is on Will's side, though; the kids should be able to follow whatever faith they want.  Will also says that it's a trying time for everyone because of the issues with Kurt's father.  Sue leaves her point on the table, though.\rRachel has a talk with Finn.  She says that when she's ready to have kids, they should have the right to follow the faith that she wants them to follow.  Finn is alright with this, though; he says that they can go to Jewish church if she wants.  This turns out to be the right move for him.  Shortly thereafter, Finn's prayers come true and Grilled Cheesus once more shows its awe-inspiring powers.\rMeanwhile, Sue speaks with Santana and Brittany about what's going on in Glee Club and decides to use their report to her advantage. \n"}, {"text": "Who asks Sue why she doesn't believe in God?", "correct": "Emma", "options": ["Will", "Kurt", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmma.\n\n\tSue's sights become set on Kurt and the two of them discuss his dad's conditions in her office.  She informs Kurt that she is less amused by Will's decisions than usual, but she can't go to the school board without a student's complaint.  Although Kurt recognizes that she's using him as a scapegoat, she gets through to him.\rEmma finds Sue and expresses her shock at what she's trying to do.  Although Kurt is going through rough times, everyone else is merely trying to help and no harm is being done.  When Emma demands an explanation, Sue explains that when she was growing up, her big sister was her only role model, and when she was younger, people were rude because of her illness.  When she prayed to God to solve the problem and nothing happened, she realized that there was no God.  She tells Emma not to make someone who doesn't believe feel guilty for their decisions and both of them decides to keep their feelings to themselves.\rIn Glee Club, Will informs the kids that they can sing about God and spirituality, but not on school time.  Kurt is finally satisfied with this. \n"}, {"text": "Finn prays to Grilled Cheesus to reclaim his role as quarterback from which student?", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Mike", "Puck", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tFinn and Rachel head to a pond and Rachel decides to sing a song a la Barbra Streisand in \"Yentl\".  To the stars, she sings \"Papa Can You Hear Me?\" by candlelight.  This performance makes its way to the hospital where she sings at Burt's bedside accompanied by Quinn, Mercedes. Finn, and Carol.  Kurt comes in when the song ends and asks everyone to leave as he claims that their prayers won't help and that he hired an acupuncturist to help his dad instead.\rIn the locker room at school, Finn brings out Grilled Cheesus and prays that he becomes the quarterback again during the next game.  While in the huddle, Finn takes an active role and overrides Coach Beiste's decision.  Sam's shoulder gets dislocated and Finn takes the quarterback role.  Praise Grilled Cheesus! \n"}, {"text": "To express his feelings about his father, Kurt sings a song by which band?", "correct": "The Beatles", "options": ["Fleetwood Mac", "The Rolling Stones", "N'Sync"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Beatles.\n\n\tIn the choir room, Will congratulates Finn on his return to the quarterback position before giving the floor to Kurt.  Kurt begins by telling about his mother's funeral and how his father stood by his side while he was crying and they held hands.  For his father, he decides to sing The Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" while remembering their days together.\rAfter the song, Mercedes and Kurt speak with one another in the halls.  Kurt realizes that he shouldn't be pushing his friends away and Mercedes invites him to her church service the following Sunday as it's dedicated to his dad.  He decides to go only if he can wear a fabulous hat.  She says that's fine. \n"}, {"text": "All of Finn's requests to Grilled Cheesus come true in some capacity.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tFinn speaks to Emma about his concerns; after wishing for three things from Grilled Cheesus and having them all come true, he's worried about its powers and that it's his fault that Sam is injured.  Emma reassures him that everything is fine.  God works in mysterious ways, but he's probably not in a sandwich. Finn is disappointed by this revelation, and he kind of feels slighted.  When he leaves Emma's office, he decides that he wants to sing R.E.M.'s \"Losing My Religion\" for Glee Club.  Mercedes, Tina, and Quinn are confused about the allowing of the song choice but Will defends it; at the beginning of the week Finn was inspired by religion and spirituality, but now he's not sure where he stands on the matter. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Mercedes sing \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\"?", "correct": "At her church", "options": ["She doesn't", "In the auditorium", "In the choir room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt her church.\n\n\tKurt (in his fabulous hat) and Mercedes show for church on Sunday and Kurt takes a seat in one of the front pews.  When Mercedes joins her choir at the front of the church, she asks everyone to pray for his dad and acknowledges that while Kurt doesn't believe in God, he does have hope.  Mercedes leads the church into an emotional rendition of Simon and Garfunkel's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" while Kurt feels the support of the congregation.\rAt her sister Jane's home, Sue talks about believing in God.

He apologizes for everything- the dinner, his reactions to everyone's prayers, and everything else.  While he doesn't believe in God, he believes in his dad and the two of them together.  While he holds his dad's hand at his bedside, Kurt feels his father squeeze his hand, a sign that he's regaining consciousness.\rIn the end of the episode, the kids gather in the auditorium to perform Joan Osbourne's \"One of Us\" together.
