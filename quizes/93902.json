High School.In some of the actual high school games, the team would score 30 runs but the producers of the movie did not want to include that fact and show the games as being close for dramatic effect.

Therefore, the error is that he ran out of the wrong bullpen.  They show him running out of the bullpen in right field but the visitor's bullpen at The Ballpark in Arlington is actually in left field. Also, the scenes in which they show him in the bullpen talking to his wife would have been the Ranger's bullpen also. Another error was when they show the cab driving up to bring him to The Ballpark in Arlington - it was driving on the wrong side of the road.  A couple of other errors are Gabe Kapler batting for the Rangers even though he wouldn't become a Ranger until the 2000 season and the Rangers wore blue uniforms instead of the red ones they wore in 1999. \n"}, {"text": "The first batter that faced Jim Morris in his first Major League game was Royce Clayton.
