Perhaps the frisky Henry had them specially ordered in? \n"}, {"text": "During the scene in the Officer's Club, Nancy Sue, an ex-cheerleader, does an entire cheerleading sequence to some college fight song music.  She claims to have been a cheerleader at what university?", "correct": "Ohio State", "options": ["Michigan", "Florida", "Texas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOhio State.\n\n\tNancy Sue is from Independence, Ohio, and she claims to have attended Ohio State.
