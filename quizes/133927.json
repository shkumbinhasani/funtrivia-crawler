{"id": "133927", "name": "\"Hamlet\" Do you know the text ? Quiz | Literature | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Shakespeare", "Hamlet"], "questions": [{"text": "Which two of the guards on the battlements at Elsinore were together when they saw the ghost that they tell Horatio about?", "correct": "Bernado and Marcellus", "options": ["Marcellus and Francisco", "Bernado and Francisco", "Bernado and Reynaldo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBernado and Marcellus.\n\n\tFrancisco has just gone off duty. It was during the hours when Bernardo and Marcellus kept watch that the ghost had started to appear. \n"}, {"text": "Apart from the careful watch that is now kept each night what other sign of impending war with Young Fortinbras of Norway has Marcellus noted?", "correct": "Men working on ships by both day and night.", "options": ["The purchase of large amounts of gunpowder.", "All of these signs.", "The hiring of a large number of foreign mercenaries."], "explanation": "\n\n\nMen working on ships by both day and night.\n\n\tMarcelleus talks about the \"impress of shipwrights\" - suggesting continuous forced labour. There is no mention of gunpowder, though we are told that new cannon are being cast. Generally there is a feeling that there is no difference between a week day and a Sunday and there is little difference between day and night - the war-work goes on. \n"}, {"text": "What job does Claudius allocate to Cornelius and Valtemand?", "correct": "The carrying of a letter to the uncle of warlike Young Fortinbras", "options": ["The carrying of a direct challenge to Young Fortinbras.", "The job of watching Hamlet's movements more closely.", "The job of ensuring that preparations for war are continued."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe carrying of a letter to the uncle of warlike Young Fortinbras.\n\n\tClaudius opens his part in the play with an impressive speech which works through a series of items as thought they were on an agenda. First he thanks his court for their approval of his marriage to Gertrude. Then there is the problem with Young Fortinbras. After that he deals with the leave-taking of Laertes.Finally he comes to Hamlet. \n"}, {"text": "When Hamlet is first left alone he comments with some strength on the length of time that elapsed after his father's death before Gertrude married Claudius. How long does he first say it was?", "correct": "Less than two months", "options": ["Less than six weeks", "Less than three months", "Less than four months"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLess than two months.\n\n\t\"That it should come to this -\r  But two months dead, nay not so much, not two -\"\rClaudius can claim that he acted quickly to ensure continuity of leadership in the face of a foreign enemy. Gertrude's motives are not so easily explained away.Hamlet later reduces it to \"within a month.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following reasons does Laertes put to his sister for treating Hamlet's love with caution?", "correct": "All of these reasons.", "options": ["If she yields to him her reputation will be open to slander.", "Hamlet's love was that of a young man and not lasting..", "Hamlet must follow the orders of his family about marriage."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these reasons.\n\n\tLaertes uses a combination of all these arguments to try to put his sister on her guard. It is notable that he considers carefully what Hamlet's family might require from the Prince. He is being cautious about Claudius's intentions. \n"}, {"text": "After Polonius has just imparted some lengthy advice to his son Laertes he gives some specific orders to his daughter Ophelia about her future behaviour towards Hamlet.What are these orders?", "correct": "Do not spend any time in future talking with Hamlet", "options": ["Make sure the King and Queen do not see you with Hamlet.", "Always have a chaperone with you when talking to Hamlet.", "Ignore what your brother has said about Hamlet."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDo not spend any time in future talking with Hamlet.\n\n\tAt this early stage of the play it is difficult to penetrate Polonius' true feelings. Is he cynical in his attitude towards Hamlet's so-called honourable advances? Is he dirty-minded in his \"understanding\" of young men's behaviour ? Later, it could be said that if it can advance him with the King, Polonius will use Ophelia as bait and countermand these orders. \n"}, {"text": "Exactly how, according to the Ghost, was the murder of Hamlet's father committed?", "correct": "Claudius poured poison in his ear whilst he slept.", "options": ["Claudius smothered him whilst he slept.", "Gertrude held him down whilst Cladius stabbed him.", "Claudius put poison in his cup before he drank from it."], "explanation": "\n\n\nClaudius poured poison in his ear whilst he slept.\n\n\tThe details of the death that the Ghost describes are highly upsetting. The poison's effects are compared in at least two ways to the way in which leprosy takes over the body. The idea of the defenceless man sleeping in his orchard is also particularly disturbing for we are all vulnerable when asleep. \n"}, {"text": "In what unusual way does Polonius ask Reynaldo to check up on Laertes whilst he is in Paris?", "correct": "By inventing false accusations of bad conduct to see if anyone agrees", "options": ["By paying one of Laertes' servants to check up on him", "By arranging for a local priest to hear his confession", "By bribing one of Laertes' friends to make reports on him"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy inventing false accusations of bad conduct to see if anyone agrees.\n\n\tAmongst the possible \"crimes\" that Polonius sees his son being involved in are gaming, drinking, fencing, swearing and drabbing (sexual relationships with paid women). He tells Reynaldo he can suggest that Laertes is guilty of these sins and see if the people he talks to confirm this.It's an example of Polonius' over devious mind. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a part of Hamlet's disordered clothing that Ophelia describes to her father?", "correct": "His cuffs were stained with ink.", "options": ["He was not wearing a hat.", "His stockings were hanging down to his ankles.", "The laces that normally tied his doublet were unfastened."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis cuffs were stained with ink.\n\n\tHis stockings were also \"fouled\" or muddy. The look on Hamlet's face was of one who has just got out of hell. He stares at Ophelia closely and keeps staring at her as he makes his way out of the room. Polonius interprets this as the \"ecstasy of love\". \n"}, {"text": "What reason does Claudius give for sending for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern?", "correct": "To help Hamlet cheer up and to find out what is wrong with him.", "options": ["To get Hamlet to renew his attentions to Ophelia.", "To talk Hamlet into helping him deal with Fortinbras.", "To receive reports on Hamlet's behaviour at Wittenberg."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo help Hamlet cheer up and to find out what is wrong with him.\n\n\tClaudius is asking for their help in a very plausible way and he asks in a public scene. Thus, to all eyes, he could be seen as a kindly uncle trying to help his nephew back to a better spirit. Naturally there could be other reasons for wanting to know exactly what Hamlet's feelings are. \n"}, {"text": "What request do \"Old Norway\" and young Fortinbras make of Claudius via the message that Valtemand brings?", "correct": "Free passage across Denmark for the army on the way to fight the Poles.", "options": ["The surrender of one Danish castle to settle their dispute.", " Free passage across Denmark for the army on the way to fight the Poles.", "That young Hamlet should be allowed to visit Norway.", "That Fortinbras be allowed to visit the Danish court."], "explanation": "\n\n\nFree passage across Denmark for the army on the way to fight the Poles.\n\n\tClaudius must be full of relief at the success of the mission of Valtemand and Cornelius. The old king of Norway has \"reined in\" his nephew so that Denmark is no longer the target. Instead Fortinbras is to use his recently gathered army against the Poles. \n"}, {"text": "What proposition does Polonius put to the King regarding Hamlet and Ophelia?", "correct": "To leave Ophelia with Hamlet and they will both hide and watch them.", "options": ["To arrange a marriage between Ophelia and Hamlet,", "To tell Hamlet Ophelia wishes to marry Fortinbras.", "To forbid Ophelia from ever seeing Hamlet again."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo leave Ophelia with Hamlet and they will both hide and watch them.\n\n\tBy now Polonius appears to have convinced himself that Hamlet's apparent madness and melancholy has been caused by his frustrated love for Ophelia. Without the slightest regard for Ophelia Polonius is prepared to use her in order to prove his point to the King. \n"}, {"text": "Whom had Rosencrantz and Guildenstern met on their way to see Hamlet?", "correct": "The players.", "options": ["Ophelia", "Fortinbras", "The Grave-digger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe players.\n\n\tWatching the players was previously one of the pleasures that Hamlet had apparently taken delight in. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are thus following Claudius' orders in trying to draw Hamlet on to pleasures. \n"}, {"text": "What is the theme of the speech that Hamlet encourages the First Player to repeat for them?", "correct": "The killing of King Priam by the brutal Pyrrhus.", "options": ["The killing of Hector by Achilles.", "The tale of Hercules and his labours.", "The tragic love story of Troilus and Cressida."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe killing of King Priam by the brutal Pyrrhus.\n\n\tHamlet seems fascinated by the tale of the ruthless killing of an old king by a man who is depicted as bloody and brutal. Is this meant to reflect the way he feels about his father and Claudius after he has heard the tale told by the Ghost? \n"}, {"text": "With what does Hamlet reproach himself in the soliloquy that he makes after the Players and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have left?", "correct": "Lack of passion over his father's death compared with the players' acting.", "options": ["His inability to act madness successfully.", "His abrasive and shocking treatment of Ophelia.", "His acceptance of his former friends though they are spies."], "explanation": "\n\n\nLack of passion over his father's death compared with the players' acting.\n\n\tThe player can get himself worked up over a fictional situation in which he is not really personally involved. Hamlet is angry at his own lack of feeling and incapacity for action. However, he has arranged for a play to be performed that should give him clinching evidence that the Ghost spoke the truth and Claudius is guilty. \n"}, {"text": "What does Hamlet mean when he talks about \"paintings\" to Ophelia?", "correct": "He refers to the art of make-up where true appearance is disguised.", "options": ["He refers to the portrait of Ophelia he used to wear in a locket.", "He refers to the portrait of his father he wears in a locket.", "He refers to the arras behind which Polonius is hiding."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe refers to the art of make-up where true appearance is disguised.\n\n\tHamlet feels betrayed by all woman-kind by the behaviour of his mother. His harsh treatment of Ophelia is probably general distrust and disgust rather than any specific faults in the woman he once loved. \n"}, {"text": "In what way does Hamlet confirm that he trusts Horatio?", "correct": "He asks him to observe his uncle's behaviour at the play.", "options": ["He tells him his true feelings about Ophelia.", "He tells him how much he hates Polonius.", "He asks him to watch closely Rosencranz and Guildenstern."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe asks him to observe his uncle's behaviour at the play.\n\n\tHamlet considers that he can \"wear\" Horatio in his \"heart of hearts\". He needs someone to help confirm his suspicions and to view objectively the behaviour of Claudius when the crucial part of the play is performed. \n"}, {"text": "Which part did Polonius once play in \"Julius Caesar\"?", "correct": "Julius Caesar", "options": ["Brutus", "Mark Antony", "Cassius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJulius Caesar.\n\n\tPolonius' own fate is even more ignominious than that of the Roman leader. However, the idea of being stabbed to death is repeated. Earlier Horatio had made an allusion to the portents seen before the death of Caesar whilst he was waiting on the battlements. \n"}, {"text": "At which point in the \"play within the play\" does Claudius call for lights?", "correct": "When the poison is poured into Gonzago's ears.", "options": ["When the Dumb Show has ended.", "When the character of Lucianus first appears.", "When the lady protests her undying love."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen the poison is poured into Gonzago's ears.\n\n\tWhether the King reacts to the action in front of him or to Hamlet's words as well is open to debate.His reaction would appear to confirm that what the Ghost said about Claudius and his chosen method of murder was true. \n"}, {"text": "What does Polonius agree is first of all in the shape of a camel, then the shape of a weasel and then the shape of a whale?", "correct": "A cloud", "options": ["A tree.", "One of the actors in disguise", "A wave on the sea."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cloud.\n\n\tHamlet feigning madness is trying to see how far Polonius will go in humouring him. He has just accused Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of trying to play on him like he was a pipe.His old friends have not managed to deceive him for he knows their loyalty has been given to the King and Queen. \n"}, {"text": "When Hamlet gets the opportunity to kill Claudius as he attempts to pray what reason does he give for not taking it?", "correct": "Claudius' soul may go to heaven if he is killed in prayer.", "options": ["He wants to kill Claudius in open court.", "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are too close by.", "He wants to talk to Gertrude first."], "explanation": "\n\n\nClaudius' soul may go to heaven if he is killed in prayer.\n\n\tScholars have argued over whether his given reason matches what they see as the \"real reason\" for his delay. Ironically Claudius admits to the audience that he cannot really pray because though his words fly up, his thoughts remain below. \n"}, {"text": "Which two pictures does Hamlet force his mother to look at?", "correct": "One of Hamlet's father and one of Claudius.", "options": ["One of Hamlet and one of Hamlet's father.", "One painted picture of Gertrude and also her face in a mirror.", "One of Gertrude herself and one of Ophelia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne of Hamlet's father and one of Claudius.\n\n\tSome suggest miniatures, the first of King Hamlet worn by Hamlet, the second of Claudius worn by Gertrude.Others suggest full length hanging portraits. \n"}, {"text": "What thoughts does the sight of Fortinbras' army cause Hamlet to have?", "correct": "They are ready to die for nothing - he hasn't the courage to kill Claudius..", "options": ["He wonders how to get the Norwegians on his side.", "He considers travelling to Norway instead of to England.", "He wonders whether Fortinbras will marry Ophelia."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are ready to die for nothing - he hasn't the courage to kill Claudius..\n\n\tThe Captain informs him that the Norwegian army is going to fight against a little section of Poland that isn't worth very much. The Poles are prepared to defend it with many men in spite of its lack of worth. Hamlet reflects that he has many good reasons for taking up arms against a real evil (Claudius, the murderer of his father) and yet he has constantly delayed doing so. \n"}, {"text": "For what skill has Laertes been praised by the Frenchman, Monsieur Lamord?", "correct": "fencing with the rapier", "options": ["acting", "riding difficult horses", "playing cards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfencing with the rapier.\n\n\tClaudius wants to make use of Laertes' skill with a rapier as part of his plot to dispose of Hamlet without drawing too much suspicion on himself. For his part Laertes does not seem entirely innocent for he is carrying a deadly poison he bought from a \"mountebank\". He suggests putting it on the end of his weapon. \n"}, {"text": "According to the grave-digger how long had Yorick's skull lain in the earth?", "correct": "twenty-three years", "options": ["sixteen years", "eight years", "eighteen years"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwenty-three years.\n\n\tIf we are to believe this statement then it gives us some information about Hamlet's age. Hamlet claims to have known Yorick and to have ridden on his back and to have kissed his lips. This places Hamlet's age at least in the mid or late twenties. It has often been the excuse for older actors to take on the role. \n"}]}
