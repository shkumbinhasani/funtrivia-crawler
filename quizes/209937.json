{"id": "209937", "name": "Writing a Fractured Word Quiz | Brain Teasers | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", "Creating a Brain Teasers Quiz"], "questions": [{"text": "Let's say you want to fracture \"FunTrivia.\" Which is the best way to fracture it?", "correct": "Fond trippy yaw", "options": ["Phone trivia", "Fawn trivet awe", "Fun trippy hah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFond trippy yaw.\n\n\tThe rules for fractured word quizzes dictate that your clue may not include correct spellings for any of the words that you are fracturing. So a fracture of FunTrivia may not include \"fun\" or \"trivia.\" In \"Fawn trivet awe\" the word part \"vet\" makes the clue sound too different from the answer. \n"}, {"text": "An acceptable fractured word quiz has ____.", "correct": "no punctuation and answers that \"roll off the tongue\"", "options": ["commas, periods, and questions marks only", "correct capitalization but no punctuation", "minimal punctuation and answers that \"roll off the tongue\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nno punctuation and answers that \"roll off the tongue\".\n\n\tFractured quizzes may NOT include punctuation. Punctuation is disallowed for technical reasons: to ensure that players with different keyboards don't receive false \"incorrect\" messages. Also, punctuation varies too much. For example, when typing a phrase such as \"red, white, and blue,\" some players will include no commas, some will include one, and others will include two. \r It is more fair to quiz takers to fracture a well-known idiomatic phrase such as \"easy does it\" than a lesser-known or vaguer one such as \"five easy steps.\" \r Capitalization/lowercasing doesn't count on FunTrivia.com. \n"}, {"text": "A fractured word quiz clue may include proper noun(s).", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tYou may include proper nouns in clues as long as the nouns are fairly well known. \n"}, {"text": "Katharine Hepburn spelled her first name in an atypical manner. Why would it be problematic to use this famous actress's name as a fill-in-the-blank answer?", "correct": "because her first name can be spelled in so many different ways", "options": ["because it is impossible to fracture this name \"legally\" ", "because Katharine Hepburn died so long ago that few players know who she is", "because her last name is too difficult for most people to spell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbecause her first name can be spelled in so many different ways.\n\n\tPlayers who have never seen \"Katharine Hepburn\" written might spell her first name \"Katherine,\" \"Catherine,\" \"Kathryn,\" or another way. When writing Fractured Word quizzes it is best to steer clear of such names. My name, for example, might be spelled Robyn, Robin, Robbin, Robbyn, or even Robbynne. \n"}, {"text": "Which is the best way to fracture the proper noun \"Maine\"?", "correct": "by using a longer fracture", "options": ["men", "mane", "main"], "explanation": "\n\n\nby using a longer fracture.\n\n\tThe guidelines ask writers not to use one-syllable homophones such as \"Maine/mane\" or \"rain/reign.\" You could lengthen your answer to \"the state of Maine\" and fracture it as \"thus Tay tough May yin\" or some such. \n"}, {"text": "It is best to read a fractured word clue quickly.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIf you read a clue such as \"Hand Jello cayuse stun\" too slowly, you may not be able to figure out that the answer is \"Anjelica Huston.\" \r By the way, a cayuse is a Western U.S. pony breed developed by a Native American group called the Cayuse. \n"}, {"text": "Which is the best way to fracture the word \"Senator\"?", "correct": "sin knit her", "options": ["scent turd", "sinner turd", "simper her"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsin knit her.\n\n\tA good fracture has the same number of syllables as the answer. Try to also  match all the consonant sounds in the answer. \n"}, {"text": "Which is the best theme for a fractured word quiz? ", "correct": "Fractured Dog Breeds", "options": ["Fractured Famous Buildings at UC Berkeley", "Fractured Famous Quotations", "Fractured Items in Our World"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFractured Dog Breeds.\n\n\tAs a topic, \"Items in Our World\" is far too broad. Maybe \"Fractured Kitchen Utensils\" would work better. The \"Famous Quotations\" quiz was one of mine (now defunct). It included clues such as \"Two bee oar naught tubby.\" But the answers were too long and included too many possibilities for varying punctuation.They also broke the \"no homophones for one-syllable words\" rule. As for the UC Berkeley building theme, I attended Berkeley and can remember the name of only one building, Wheeler Hall. How can one expect Australians or even Kansans to know the answers to a quiz such as this one? An author called JuniorTheJaws wrote the popular \"Fractured Dog Breeds\" quiz (which players can find in the Fractured Words subcategory under Brain Teasers). \n"}, {"text": "Fractured word clues must make sense.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNope. Does \"Jewelry or rabbits?\" (my fracture for Julia Roberts) make sense? The clues' nonsensical nature is one of the reasons that they are so much fun to write. \n"}, {"text": "Let's say I really want to fracture the movie title \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" How might I circumvent the punctuation problem?
