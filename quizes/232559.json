{"id": "232559", "name": "\"Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue/Yellow\" - Important Items Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Pokemon Games", " Pokemon Red/ Blue/Yellow"], "questions": [{"text": "Which is the only item that we receive directly from Professor Oak?", "correct": "Pokedex", "options": ["Master Ball", "HM05", "Item Finder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPokedex.\n\n\tIn order to obtain the Pok\u00e9dex, you need to go to Viridian City's Pok\u00e9mart and receive a package.  When you return this to Professor Oak in his lab in Pallet Town, you'll get your Pok\u00e9dex.  The Pok\u00e9dex can be accessed from the menu, and it will list all of the Pok\u00e9mon you've seen or caught throughout the game.  You'll also get statistics and a brief description of the Pok\u00e9mon, but only if it's actually caught.  In total, you can get one hundred and fifty-one Pok\u00e9mon in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, and Yellow\" (including Mew). \n"}, {"text": "One of the fossils obtained in Mt. Moon is the Helix Fossil.  What Pok\u00e9mon will be created from it on Cinnabar Island?", "correct": "Omanyte", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOmanyte.\n\n\tIn Mt. Moon, you'll have a choice after defeating a member of Team Rocket between whether you want the Helix Fossil or the Dome Fossil.  When you reach Cinnabar Island, you can visit the lab and turn the fossil you chose into a Pok\u00e9mon.  You can also use the Old Amber, found in Pewter City, to make an Aerodactyl.  The Dome Fossil creates a Kabuto while the Helix Fossil becomes Omanyte.  In order to get the one you didn't choose, you need to trade with another player or win one on \"Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\".  Omanyte will mainly use water-based attacks and will evolve into Omastar. \n"}, {"text": "Where can you obtain the Bike Voucher?", "correct": "Vermilion City", "options": ["Saffron City", "Cerulean City", "Celadon City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVermilion City.\n\n\tThe Bike Voucher can be given to you by the President of the Pok\u00e9mon Fan Club in Vermilion City if you listen to his long-winded stories.  The Pok\u00e9mon Fan Club can be found just north of Lt. Surge's gym.  When you bring the voucher to the Bike Shop in Cerulean City, you'll get a bike, free of charge.  Without the Bike Voucher, the bike would cost one million dollars, a total you're unlikely to get in the game.  The bike will allow you to move through Kanto much faster, but it doesn't work in most indoor locations. \n"}, {"text": "Who gives you the S. S. Ticket?", "correct": "Bill", "options": ["Mr. Fuji", "Misty", "None of these; you find it on the ground"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBill.\n\n\tIn order to obtain the S. S. Ticket, you need to visit Bill at his cottage on Route 25.  When you first visit him, he'll be a half-Pok\u00e9mon half-man creation, but using one of his machines, you can return him to his original form and get the reward.  All you need to do is show up at the S. S. Anne at the port in Vermilion City, and you'll be free to walk on.  Here, you can train with the different trainers, fight your rival, and get HM01 (Cut) so that you can obtain HM05 on Route 2 and enter Lt. Surge's gym.  To get this HM, you need to visit the captain of the ship. \n"}, {"text": "Where is the only location that you can use the Silph Scope?", "correct": "Lavender Town", "options": ["Celadon City", "Route 12", "Rock Tunnel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLavender Town.\n\n\tIn order to obtain the Silph Scope, you need to gain entry to the basement of the Game Corner in Celadon City and defeat Giovanni for the first time.  Then, you'll need to head east past Saffron City to Lavender Town and climb to the top level of the Pok\u00e9mon Tower.  At the top, you can use the device and fight the ghostly Marowak guarding Mr. Fuji. After the battle, you can return Fuji to his house at the base of the tower and get another important item, the Pok\u00e9flute.  This can be used in two locations around Kanto.  Once the Silph Scope has been used, it can't be used again because there are no other situations in the game that call for it. \n"}, {"text": "Which item is given to you in the Pok\u00e9mon House in Lavender Town?", "correct": "Pokeflute", "options": ["HM02", "Silph Scope", "TM19"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPokeflute.\n\n\tIn order for this to happen, you need to use the Silph Scope to see the Marowak in the Pok\u00e9mon Tower, and save Mr. Fuji from the Team Rocket Members on the top floor of the building.  When this is done, you can talk to Mr. Fuji in the Pok\u00e9mon House and get the flute.  This flute will wake up any Snorlax blocking your path in Kanto, and it also has a great use in battle.  If your Pok\u00e9mon is put to sleep, simply play the tune on the Pok\u00e9flute and it will awaken. \n"}, {"text": "If you return the Gold Teeth to the Safari Zone Warden, what do you get in return?", "correct": "HM04", "options": ["HM03", "Gold Ring", "Super Rod"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHM04.\n\n\tTo find the Gold Teeth, you literally need to cross the Safari Zone and pick them up near the Secret House containing HM03 (Surf).  Once they're found, return them to the warden at his house in Fuchsia City and obtain HM04 (Strength).  Strength can be taught to strong Pok\u00e9mon and it can be used to push large boulders.  This technique is needed to reach the Indigo Plateau and make your way through the Unknown Dungeon and Seafoam Island. \n"}, {"text": "Which item is not found in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red, Yellow, and Blue\"?", "correct": "Gym Key", "options": ["Lift Key", "Card Key", "Secret Key"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGym Key.\n\n\tThe Lift Key is the first you'll find and it's in the hands of one of the Team Rocket members in the basements of the Game Corner in Celadon City.  It's used to activate the lift to reach Giovanni.\rThe Card Key is next to be found, and it's in Silph Co.  Once again, it's used to reach Giovanni by taking the elevator to the top floor.  The Card Key can be found on the Fifth Floor of the building.\rThe final key, the Secret Key, is found in the charred remains of the Pok\u00e9mon Mansion on Cinnabar Island, and it's used differently from the other keys.  Instead, this key is used to open the door to the gym on Cinnabar Island. \n"}, {"text": "How many Master Balls can you get in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\"?", "correct": "One & 1", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne & 1.\n\n\tThe Master Ball is given to you by the President of Silph Co. in Saffron City.  In order to add it to your inventory, you must get Giovanni out of the Silph Co. building by fighting him on the eleventh floor.  This special Pok\u00e9ball can be used to instantly capture any Pok\u00e9mon, so it's probably best to use it on a rare Pok\u00e9mon.  In \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", some find it beneficial to use the Missing_No cheat in order to gain a near-infinite stock of these items, but in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", the cheat was removed.  Therefore, only one can be obtained and used in the entire game. \n"}, {"text": "Which fishing rod can be obtained in Fuchsia City?", "correct": "Good Rod", "options": ["Super Rod", "Mediocre Rod", "Old Rod"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGood Rod.\n\n\tIf you visit the Fishing Guru in Vermilion City, he'll bestow the Old Rod upon you.  It's not that great because after all, it only catches Magikarps.  If you happen to visit the Fishing Guru's older brother in Fuchsia City though, you'll be given the Good Rod which can catch Goldeens, Krabbies, and other better Pok\u00e9mon.  To obtain the final rod, the Super Rod, you need to make your way to Route 12 and talk to the final sibling.  The Super Rod is great for catching Poliwags, Horseas, and even Gyarados! \n"}]}
