When men came, five tribes settled at that spot and called it Wakanda.  They fought with each other until one shaman was led to a heart-shaped plant that gave him the power to be the first Black Panther and the first King of Wakanda.  Four tribes agreed to the rule; one went into isolation in the mountains.  Wakanda thrived as a result, but hid away from the rest of the world.\rIn 1992 in Oakland, California, the King of Wakanda, T'Chaka, stops by an apartment to speak to his brother, N'Jobu, who he believes betrayed the nation to give a the location of Wakanda's vibranium to a man named Ulysses Klaue.  N'Jobu lies about this, immediately getting caught out by his best friend, revealed to be a spy.  They all return to Wakanda together. \n"}, {"text": "A mis-identified weapon made of vibranium is stolen from a museum in which nation?", "correct": "The United Kingdom", "options": ["Austria", "France", "The United States"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe United Kingdom.\n\n\tKing T'Chaka, killed during the terror attacks in the United Nations Headquarters during the events of the Avengers' Civil War, is mourned in the present day while his son, T'Challa, takes up the Black Panther mantle.  Flying over the Sambisa Forest in Nigeria, he drops from his craft and flies in to intercept a caravan trafficking women under the cover of night.  T'Challa subdues many of the soldiers there while one of the women in the caravan, Nakia, supports him.  He reveals that he intercepted to extract her for his coronation ceremony the following day.  They free the captured people before flying off, returning to Wakanda the next day.\rIn London, a man by the name of Erik Stevens visits the West African exhibit of the British Museum, identifying a vibranium-made piece from Wakanda during his tour.  It's all part of his plan though; a curator for the exhibit is poisoned, and criminal Ulysses Klaue, posing as a paramedic, kills the other witnesses before they steal the weapon for its material and escape in an ambulance. \n"}, {"text": "A member of which tribe comes forward to face T'Challa for the throne?", "correct": "The Jabari Tribe", "options": ["The River Tribe", "The Border Tribe", "The Mining Tribe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Jabari Tribe.\n\n\tT'Challa reunites with his mother, Ramonda, and this sister, Shuri, upon returning to Wakanda and quick preparations are made in advance of his coronation.  During this ceremony, before his people, his powers are intentionally stripped away and he is asked to perform in trial by combat for his position. The leaders of four tribes refuse to put forth their best warriors to face him, but the fifth tribe, that of the isolated Jabari people, come forth with their leader, M'Baku, to battle the nation's potential leader.  Staunch believers in tradition and angered by the generally progressive choices of the nation, the Jabari believe that T'Challa should be overthrown. And so they fight, and in their fierce combat, T'Challa emerges victorious, bringing M'Baku to the edge of the waterfall and forcing him to yield.  His powers are returned to him shortly thereafter in a subsequent ceremony during which T'Challa has a vision of his father passing the mantle to him. \n"}, {"text": "Ulysses Klaue's vibranium deal sends T'Challa to which nation?", "correct": "South Korea", "options": ["Japan", "Singapore", "China"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSouth Korea.\n\n\tT'Challa, now officially the King of Wakanda, walks the streets with Nakia and both of them are very clear about their viess of their fine nation.  T'Challa, knowing of the outside world, fears that Wakanda would be lesser if the world knew about their advancements, but Nakia believes that they're strong enough to be able to help those in need without sacrificing their strength. T'Challa's friend, W'Kabi, sides with him on his views, and when the opportunity arises for T'Challa to intercept Ulysses Klaue during a vibranium deal in South Korea, they both agree to extract T'Chaka's former foe and bring him back to Wakanda to be dealt with appropriately instead of getting other nations involved. And with that, T'Challa brings Nakia and Okoye with him for a trip to Busan.  Shuri, while showing T'Challa his new technology, criticizes him for bringing his ex along for the trip, but that's his call.  After testing his new suit, they're on their way. \n"}, {"text": "Everett Ross works for which organization?", "correct": "CIA", "options": ["S.H.I.E.L.D.", "FBI", "World Health Organization"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCIA.\n\n\tNakia leads T'Challa and Okoye to a private casino in Busan and the three of them spread out to search for Klaue.  A handful of CIA agents also appear to be present in the casino, these men led by Everett Ross, who met T'Challa during the UN HQ incident and helped try to bring Bucky Barnes to justice.  Ross urges him to leave, but it's clear that both of them are there for the same reason-- to intercept Klaue-- though Ross is there to make a fake deal for the vibranium. When Klaue arrives, armed all the way through the casino's entrance, the deal commences but Okoye, believing herself to be found out, sparks a firefight between Klaue's men and everyone else.T'Challa nearly apprehends Klaue, but the mobster unleashes his unique weapon, an interesting piece of tech posing as a prosthetic arm. \n"}, {"text": "T'Challa's suit is able to store which of these?", "correct": "Kinetic energy", "options": ["Memories", "Lead", "Body heat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKinetic energy.\n\n\tKlaue and his entourage flee and split up into the streets and Okoye and Nakia pursue him together.  T'Challa, forced to pursue alone, gets Shuri to drive his vehicle remotely (from Wakanda) while he dons his Black Panther outfit and hops on.  The high-speed chase heads through the streets and onto the Diamond Bridge and, all the while, T'Challa's suit is powered by the kinetic energy of the bullets fired at him. It allows him to create a massive kinetic blast, destroying one of the remaining getaway vehicles.  Okoye and Nakia, meanwhile, are stopped when their car is obliterated by Klaue's arm blast. They survive and get picked up by Ross in his vehicle before resuming the chase.  T'Challa is finally able to remove one of the wheels from Klaue's car to bring him down and, once T'Challa literally disarms him, they're able to take him into custody.  T'Challa nearly kills Klaue for his actions, but Okoye reminds him that the world is watching his movements, and Wakanda needs to be strong. \n"}, {"text": "Klaue succumbs to wounds inflicted upon him by T'Challa.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tKlaue is brought into custody and his prosthetic is examined by scientists.  T'Challa insists that Klaue be brought back to stand trial in Wakanda, but Ross is hesitant to let this happen as his actions should force him to fall to the CIA for justice.  Klaue admits that the weapon on his arm is from Wakanda and proceeds to tell Ross about the nation, claiming its third-world status to be nothing more than a front for the richest deposit of the world's most valuable metal.  Before Ross can confirm this fact, Erik Stevens and his crew blow up the wall of the interrogation room and start firing in, killing a number of the CIA team in the building and severely wounding Ross.  As Stevens and Klaue escape, T'Challa insists on taking Ross back to Wakanda where they can stabilize and heal him using their technology; Shuri is only thrilled to use her skills.  The Wakandan trio admit that their mission was a failure and W'Kabi criticizes his friend's decisions.\rElsewhere, Stevens brings Klaue to an airfield and kills him and his own associates, revealing himself to be Wakandan and intending to fly back himself. \n"}, {"text": "How is T'Challa related to N'Jadaka?", "correct": "They're cousins.", "options": ["They're uncle and nephew.", "They're brothers.", "They're old friends."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey're cousins.\n\n\tT'Challa speaks to his high elder, Zuri, about a ring he saw on Erik Stevens' neck, and the story is revealed to him.  His uncle, N'Jobu, took a war dog assignment in America and saw the oppression placed upon all people of African descent.  Intending to help them, he hoped to give African nations the technology powered by vibranium to allow them to overthrow regimes, though he knew T'Chaka would never allow it.  T'Chaka had no choice but to kill N'Jobu in Oakland when he drew his weapon.  N'Jobu's son was left behind in Oakland, and that boy grew up with no father so that T'Chaka could maintain the lie about Wakanda, and that boy, N'Jadaka, grew up to be Erik Stevens.\rOut at the border, Stevens brings a gift, leaving Klaue's dead body for W'Kabi.\rIn the lab, Ross awakens feeling nearly fully healed.  Shuri assures him that his bullet wound has healed overnight thanks to her technologies, and she gives him the chance to gaze out at the Wakandan vibranium mines.  Both of them are alerted to Stevens' arrival, and Ross recognizes him as an American Black Ops soldier who was nicknamed 'Killmonger' due to his ability to rack up kills in the field. \n"}, {"text": "How many heart-shaped herbs are saved by Nakia?", "correct": "One", "options": ["Two", "None", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tStevens is brought before the council and it's there that he demands the throne, intending to use Wakandan weapons to help oppressed people rise up.  He also makes an effort to stake his claim, revealing himself to the council as N'Jadaka, the son of Prince N'Jobu, indicating that he is able to rightfully face off against T'Challa for the Black Panther mantle.  T'Challa accepts and, once again, prepares.\rThey head to the waterfall and T'Challa's powers are, once again, stripped away.  With no turning back, the two of them go head-to-head in a ferocious fight.  N'Jadaka is, to the surprise of all, the one to emerge victorious, stabbing T'Challa and preparing to end his life.  Zuri intervenes, however, admitting to be the one responsible for N'Jobu's death in Oakland.  N'Jadaka kills him in retaliation before casting T'Challa over the falls.  Wakanda has no choice but to respect their new king.\rNakia brings Shuri and Ramonda to a safe place before trying to convince Okoye to help.  Okoye, however, supports the throne.  Nakia, fighting to survive, frees Ross before absconding with a heart-shaped herb, the last one to be harvested before N'Jadaka ingests his own quantity and orders the remainder destroyed to prevent future kings.  And with that, they head into exile and come across the Jabari tribe...and T'Challa, saved from the river because he earlier spared M'Baku's life in combat.\rAnd as N'Jadaka takes the throne, he demands that vibranium weapons be sent to spies throughout the world so that all those in power can be brought to justice in death. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these allows T'Challa to defeat Killmonger?", "correct": "Sonic disruptors", "options": ["Hallucinogenic herbs", "Energy overload", "Vibranium bullets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSonic disruptors.\n\n\tRamonda crushes the heart-shaped herb and feeds it to the comatose T'Challa to heal him from what should be mortal wounds.  Shuri reveals a further stolen item; she took the Black Panther suit with her when they fled the city.  He returns to the mines as Shuri, Nakia, and Ross infiltrate the labs and soon begins a fight between T'Challa, backed by Okoye's warriors, and Killmonger and his supporters.  Ross, piloting a Wakandan aircraft remotely, manages to shoot down the ships transporting Wakandan weapons while Shuri and Nakia join the battle with weapons of their own.  They are, unfortunately, no match for N'Jadaka's brute strength, and he nearly kills Shuri before T'Challa throws him down into the vibranium mines.  Calling up to Shuri, T'Challa has her run the trains on the lower tracks of the mine, allowing the destabilizers to deactivate the Black Panther suits, and in doing so it allows the two fighters to fight hand-to-hand.  Topside, the Jabari people finally arrive to help in the fight while Ross pilots his aircraft and stops the transport ships in time.  Okoye is able to convince W'Kabi to stop the battle, emphasizing that she wouldn't stop if it cost her Wakanda.\rUnderground, T'Challa and N'Jadaka continue their battle on the tracks until T'Challa finally gets the upper hand, plunging a vibranium blade into his cousin's stomach.  T'Challa promises to heal N'Jadaka, but his cousin refuses the treatment as they ascend to the surface to watch the sunset; he refuses to be locked up, instead asking to be cast into the ocean since death would be better than bondage and before pulling the weapon from his body.\rT'Challa resumes his reign thereafter, opting to reveal Wakanda to the world.  He thanks Nakia for saving him and Wakanda both.  She leaves, despite her love for T'Challa, to work with Shuri helping youths in Oakland from Wakanda's first new outreach centre. \n"}]}
