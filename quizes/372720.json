Platoon commander Lt 'Spud' Wilson, played by James McKechnie, decides to pre-empt the exercise and capture the general when he is least expecting it.  Lieutenant Wilson orders his platoon to travel into London to the Piccadilly hotel in which Wynne-Candy and his fellow senior officers are relaxing before the exercise is due to begin. General Wynne-Candy, V.C., played by Roger Livesey, takes umbrage that a junior officer has used his initiative and struck before the exercise has started. Lt Wilson justifies this course of action by stating that he will defend his country and fight the enemy by using any means at his disposal.  A heated argument ensues and the general and the young officer come to blows, both eventually tumbling into the bath spa pool.  It is at this point that the film travels back in time to 1902 when the Major-General was a young officer, a Lieutenant, himself. \n"}, {"text": "Lieutenant Candy is shown a letter sent by a relative of his friend Lieutenant Hopwell, stating that the newspapers in a major northern European capital city are printing troubling reports about the behaviour of British troops fighting the Boers in South Africa.  Which capital city is this?", "correct": "Berlin", "options": ["Lisbon", "Rome", "Stockholm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBerlin.\n\n\tThe German agent, Kaunitz, is attempting to foment trouble between Great Britain and Germany by accusing the British of murdering Boer women and children rather than feeding them.  An indignant Candy is refused permission to travel to Germany by his superiors, but he ignores them and travels there where he meets governess Edith Hunter, the first role in the film played by Deborah Kerr.  Whilst confronting Kaunitz in a caf\u00e9-restaurant, Candy inadvertently insults the entire Imperial German Officer Corps! \n"}, {"text": "As two German officers enter the British Embassy, their snow covered boots march across a mosaic of the Tower of London that can be seen decorating the floor at the entrance to the building.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIt is a very colourful mosaic of the British royal coat of arms that can be seen as the two soldiers march into the British Embassy building.  The two officers of the Imperial German Officer Corps are visiting the British Embassy to demand satisfaction after Candy's insult.  Candy's insult was deemed so severe that every officer in the corps wishes to take part in the duel with Candy; however, the corps is forced to draw lots to pick the officer who will be given the honour of providing Candy's opposition. The officer chosen is Oberleutnant Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, played by Anton Walbrook.  It is agreed that the duel will take place in the gymnasium at the Berlin barracks of the 2nd Regiment of Uhlans, a regiment of lancers. \n"}, {"text": "What wounds, if any, are sustained by Candy as a result of his fighting the duel?", "correct": "He has a cut to his upper lip.", "options": ["He receives a wound to his abdomen.", "He has his left hand severed.", "He receives no wounds whatsoever."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has a cut to his upper lip.\n\n\tCandy sustains a cut to his upper lip that requires eight stitches.  Surprisingly, Candy's wounds are far more severe than they would appear but had not been inflicted during the combat; in fact after his duel he had slipped on some ice and had fallen face first through a window!  Theo, on the other hand, has received a cut across his forehead that requires twelve stitches.Despite their differences, Candy and Kretschmar-Schuldorff become great friends.  During their rehabilitation, Edith Hunter falls in love with Theo and they later marry having two sons; sons who will have a devastating effect on his life in later years. \n"}, {"text": "Fourteen years have passed and it is now 1918 and the end of the First World War is approaching.  How is the passage of these years represented in the film?", "correct": "A display of animal trophies", "options": ["The hands of a clock racing around the face", "A series of newspaper headlines", "Pages of a calendar blowing in the wind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA display of animal trophies.\n\n\tAs each year passes an animal trophy is mounted on a wall in the home of Candy's aunt in London.  As each trophy appears the camera closes in on a plaque underneath which carries the trophy's details; where in the world each was taken and the year of its shooting.  As the camera moves around the room we see the heads of lions, tigers, elephants and many small antelopes until eventually, the image settles on Candy's fireplace where we see a German military helmet, a Pickelhaube, with a plaque beneath it which reads, chillingly, 'Hun - Flanders - 1918'. \n"}, {"text": "Whilst travelling to England from the front line in Flanders, Candy, now a Brigadier-General encounters a sadistic South African officer and, later, a group of US soldiers.  Later he takes shelter in a large building, where he joins the occupants and takes a meal of macaroni in the refectory.   In which type of building does Candy find himself?", "correct": "A convent", "options": ["A railway station", "A boarding school", "A factory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA convent.\n\n\tThis is where we meet the second of three characters played by Deborah Kerr.

Candy is struck by the likeness that she bears to his earlier lost love, Edith.  Barbara is twenty years his junior but still they marry and it is after his marriage that the general adopts Barbara's surname, joining it with his own, becoming Clive Wynne-Candy. \n"}, {"text": "During the Second World War, the United States soldier was most often referred to as a G.I., but by what nickname were members of the United States Army known during the Great War?", "correct": "Doughboys", "options": ["Minutemen", "Zouaves", "Roughriders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoughboys.\n\n\tAlthough this term was still in use during the Second World War, it is most commonly used as the nickname for those United States soldiers that formed the US expeditionary force to Europe during the Great War.  It is not clear from exactly where the term originated but it is believed to have come from the coating of fine dust that those serving in Mexico during the Mexican-American war of the 1840s were often covered with or from the names of the type of bricks that were used to build in northern Mexico that were known as 'adobes'.  In the film Brigadier-General Candy runs into a small section of Doughboys with whom he successfully organises some transport to take him to a railway station, the first leg of his journey back to England. \n"}, {"text": "Erik and Spangle are two possessions of co-director Michael Powell that appear very briefly on a couple of occasions in this film.  Which possessions are they?", "correct": "His dogs", "options": ["His twin sons", "His shotguns", "His motor cars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis dogs.\n\n\tThis production is the pair's second appearance on celluloid; Erik and Spangle can be seen running across the drive at the Yorkshire home of Barbara Wynne and again being called from the rear seat of the Wynne-Candy's car as they begin unpacking after arriving home in London.  If you watch very closely you can see one of the dogs relieving itself on the staircase of the Wynne-Candy's home!  They also appear in the 1940 production 'Contraband', the 1943 offering, 'I Know Where I'm Going' which was released in 1945 and finally 'A Matter of Life and Death' from 1946; with a few notable exceptions, it could almost be said that his dogs had better employment prospects than many actors! \n"}, {"text": "Shortly after arriving at their London home after their wedding, Wynne-Candy receives a letter from the War Ministry regarding his friend Theo, now Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff, who is being held as a prisoner of war.

A year later as Kretschmar-Schuldorff is about to be repatriated he calls from the railway station to apologise for his behaviour in Derbyshire and is invited to dinner at Wynne-Candy's home. Unconvinced by the assurances given by the assembled ministers and senior military figures present at dinner that Germany will be helped to rebuild after the war, a scornful Kretschmar-Schuldorff returns to Germany. The years pass once again, this being represented by the turning of pages of mementoes and photographs saved in a scrapbook; this continues until Thursday 12th of August 1926 when we see the announcement in the Times newspaper that Barbara Wynne-Candy had passed away and, once again, the passing of the remaining inter-war years are marked by more trophies appearing in Clive Wynne-Candy's home. \n"}, {"text": "Which Shakespearean actor played the character of the General's driver during the First World War and later, his housekeeper Murdoch?", "correct": "John Laurie", "options": ["Kenneth Branagh", "Joan Sims", "Raymond Massey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Laurie.\n\n\tMurdoch was played by John Laurie who first appeared in the film as Candy's driver and batman during the First World War; Candy and Murdoch are standing together talking in a devastated area of battlefield when they receive the news that the war had finally ended.

In 1968 Laurie became a member of the cast of the hugely popular BBC television comedy 'Dad's Army' playing the role of dour funeral director James Fraser, a role that continued until the programme came to an end in 1977. \n"}, {"text": "The story moves onwards to November 1939 and we see Kretschmar-Schuldorff, now an anti-Nazi, being interviewed by a British official as an enemy alien despite having been living in England since June 1935.

When asked by the official why he hadn't left Germany earlier than he did, Theo retorted that \"It took you British five years to realise that something was wrong\" - a statement that the official and the police officer present found impossible to disagree with. Still unconvinced that Theo is a genuine refugee, the official asks if he knows any British person well enough that they can vouch for him. When asked whether or not he knows General Clive Wynne-Candy, Theo replies that he does and that he had sent him a letter but had not heard from him.  At that moment the General arrives and tells the official that he knows Theo, has done for forty years and will vouch for Theo's integrity and stand surety for him. \n"}, {"text": "It is only mentioned once in passing, but before Wynne-Candy's driver, Angela 'Johnny' Cannon, became a service-woman in what sphere of the arts did she earn her living?", "correct": "As a photographic model", "options": ["As a burlesque performer", "As a poet", "As a painter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs a photographic model.\n\n\tAngela Cannon's character is the third, and final, played by Deborah Kerr in this film.

Wynne-Candy is clearly frustrated by this and begins to lose his composure however he realises that the order to cancel has come down from a far higher authority so he resigns himself and apologises for his outburst.  There is even more bad news awaiting him on his return home where he receives a letter from the War Department informing him that he is being retired.\n"}, {"text": "Towards the end of the tale we discover who Angela Carson's boyfriend is.

After regaining consciousness, Wilson and his platoon chase Carson who is racing towards London in the General's staff car in an attempt to warn Wynne-Candy of their plans before they can get there. Margarethe Zelle, the woman known as Mata-Hari, was a Dutch-born spy executed by the French in 1917 after she had been captured spying for the Germans. \n"}, {"text": "After Wynne-Candy's house has received a direct hit during an air raid which unfortunately has also killed his friend and housekeeper Murdoch, what important wartime facility is constructed over the site upon which his home once stood?", "correct": "An emergency water tank", "options": ["A war cemetery", "A gun emplacement", "An air raid shelter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn emergency water tank.\n\n\tThe final scene of the film finds Wynne-Candy, now a senior commander in the Home Guard, in a contemplative mood gazing across the site on which his home once stood and where he shared many happy years with his wife Barbara before her death.  He remembers a promise that he had made to Barbara, inasmuch as he would only change when water, a flood or a lake, occupied the land on which their family home had once stood. Gazing into the water contained within the tank, Wynne-Candy realises that this is now the water or lake in question and that a new chapter in his life can begin; as Wynne-Candy turns to salute passing troops, it is at this point that the pictures fade and this epic tale ends. \n"}]}
