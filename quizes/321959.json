It didn't stop director Renny Harlin; he later went on to make the hilariously unrealistic super-shark film \"Deep Blue Sea\" in 1999.  What was the name of the 1995 film connecting both Davis and Harlin?", "correct": "Cutthroat Island", "options": ["Showgirls", "Cliffhanger", "Speechless"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCutthroat Island.\n\n\tI didn't see it when it was out either - and you shouldn't feel bad.  Geena Davis got back into the swing of things for the television show \"Commander in Chief\" (oh wait, that was canceled too...).  Renny Harlin, after finishing this flop and the Samuel L. Jackson-killer \"Deep Blue Sea\" later directed \"Driven\", \"Mindhunters\", and \"The Covenant\".  It certainly helped that he was married to Geena Davis at the time he filmed and completed \"Cutthroat Island\", but that couldn't save them the $104,000,000 lost on the film. Davis starred as the female captain of a pirate ship, which paralleled her role on \"Commander in Chief\" as the female President of the United States. Renny Harlin was nominated for a Razzie in directing, but lost to Paul Verhoeven (director of \"Showgirls\") who accepted his statuette in person. \n"}, {"text": "In 2002, not even Eddie Murphy could save this sci-fi comedy.  Although it was nominated for 'Worst Picture' by the Golden Raspberry Awards in its year of release, it was spared from the dubious distinction by the 'epic' (ha) Guy Ritchie/Madonna venture \"Swept Away\".  What Murphy film, also starring Randy Quaid, flopped?", "correct": "The Adventures of Pluto Nash", "options": ["Meet Dave", "Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps", "Haunted Mansion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Adventures of Pluto Nash.\n\n\t*Shudders*\r\"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" was unnecessary to say the least.  Released in 2002, the film was directed by Ron Underwood who, 12 years earlier, brought \"Tremors\" to the big screen (and we are still in his debt for that one...).  Eddie Murphy himself has admitted that the film garnered about two or three fans in interviews.  Murphy learned his lesson and never released a bad movie again... until \"Norbit\" in 2007.  And then \"Meet Dave\" in 2008.  \"Meet Dave\" lost $5,000,000 in the box office; \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" lost $134,000,000.  At least he's gotten a bit better, right?  \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" is about a man who sets out to find who destroyed his nightclub in outer space.  Prophets anticipating the film, maybe? \n"}, {"text": "Nothing may be more appealing than a sneaky look into the lives of two dating celebrities.  When Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez appeared in a film together in 2003, the satirical news outlet \"The Onion\" ran an article stating '[The film's] focus groups demand new ending in which Affleck and Lopez die.'  What movie supposedly caused so much anger in film-goers?", "correct": "Gigli", "options": ["Anaconda", "The Cell", "Surviving Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGigli.\n\n\t\"Gigli\" (as difficult to pronounce as it is to watch) is oft-regarded as a cinematic tragedy, for viewers at least.  Awarded the 2003 Razzie for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Actor, Worst Screen Couple, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay (in a rare 'Grand Slam'), \"Gigli\" is about a mobster asked to kidnap someone to get his boss out of prison.  Fearing mistrust, the boss hires J-Lo's character to take over.  The two fall in love.  Thumbs are cut off.  It's a waste of film.\rFilmgoers thought the same way.  They must've been reading the tabloids about the couple because the film only earned $7,000,000 in the box office, losing $66,000,000 in total.  Ironically, Jennifer Lopez was scheduled to film \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" less than a year before.  Thankfully, she jumped that boat... wait. \n"}, {"text": "Some films have tons of big names.  Matthew McConaughey, Penelope Cruz, and Steve Zahn all appeared in Breck Eisner's 2005 film, often regarded as a big screen debut (though he had lesser-known film works before).  Regardless, while the film was huge in terms of budget and effects, it tanked and lost millions.  What was the movie's name?", "correct": "Sahara", "options": ["Vanilla Sky", "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days", "Frailty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSahara.\n\n\tCosting $241,000,000 and only taking in nearly $120,000,000, the film (with huge-name actors) was a colossal blow for Paramount who expected the film to be a major action hit.  Developed from Clive Cussler's book series, the film wasn't as big a failure critically as others which were notable flops, but due to the extremely expensive graphics and sets it tanked like a fish out of water... uh... in a desert.\rWhile Matthew McConaughey became a big star despite this movie, some of his later films like \"Surfer, Dude\" (though I call that one \"Surfer, Dud\") failed to hit high notes.  Breck Eisner, the director, later filmed a remake of the 1973 George A. Romero horror film, \"The Crazies\". \n"}, {"text": "Based on a series of video games (but having nearly nothing in common with them), Square Pictures (now somewhat defunct because of this film's performance) released a film in 2001 composed entirely of intricate computer graphics.  What was the name of this movie starring Ming-Na and Alec Baldwin?", "correct": "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within", "options": ["Alone in the Dark", "Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li", "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinal Fantasy: The Spirits Within.\n\n\tOne of the more expensive video game adaptations (loose term in this case) ever made, Square Pictures (a subsidiary of the Square-Enix gaming developers) created \"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\" in 2001, throwing in minimal game motifs for good measure but missing the mark entirely.  While the film was a benchmark for CGI visual imagery, it tanked losing $81,000,000 (half its budget).\rThe film's graphics were so convincing that \"Playboy\" magazine placed the main character, Dr. Aki Ross, into their centerfold - the first time for an animated character (Marge Simpson would later repeat this feat in 2009).  Film director Hironobu Sakaguchi also directed the original \"Final Fantasy\" role-playing game in 1987.\rThe remaining options were all critical failures.  Of the three of them, only the \"Mortal Kombat\" sequel earned money; \"Street Fighter\" and Uwe Boll's \"Alone in the Dark\" failed to recoup their budget. \n"}, {"text": "Not even Disney can escape the wrath of the epic flop.  In 2002, the release of one animated film lost the company $83,000,000 in the box office.

Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" (but in SPACE!), the movie follows Jim Hawkins and involves the horrible cyborg pirate 'John Silver'.  While the film was favourable with critics, it lost $70,000,000 overall.  Disney would later strike gold with the Jerry Bruckheimer venture known as \"Pirates of the Caribbean\".  The second movie in the series went on to make over $1,000,000,000.\r\"Treasure Planet\" lost the 'Best Animated Feature' Academy Award to \"Spirited Away\". \n"}, {"text": "In a time of space-based movies, some like \"Armageddon\" pushed through to earn millions in the box office.

Star Val Kilmer later appeared in \"Deja Vu\" and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", both of which were quite successful, while co-star Carrie-Anne Moss went on to finish the \"Matrix\" trilogy.  Director Antony Hoffman went on to retire after this, his only film.\rLuckily, \"Red Planet\" was spared from the Razzie Awards.  Instead, sci-fi deadweight \"Battlefield Earth\" took the reigns, premiering in the same year and melting the brains of audiences worldwide.  It lost $42,000,000 itself. \n"}, {"text": "Jessica Biel and Jamie Foxx both appeared in a 2005 film about a deadly, talking military plane.  Film-goers were not pleased.  One critic renamed the film, \"Flop Gun\".  What was its actual name?", "correct": "Stealth", "options": ["Rollerball", "K19: The Widowmaker", "Vertical Limit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStealth.\n\n\tIt seems like a concept that any fan of military fighter jets in film could never avoid; a sentient and malevolent, malfunctioning jet decides to take it upon itself to fuel a futuristic war.  Foxx, Biel, Josh Lucas, and Dominic Purcell are called in to stop the device, known as EDI, after lightning makes it grow an ego.

One critic said it best: \"For years, people have joked about an action movie that might eliminate plot altogether and simply cut to the pyrotechnics. Someone has finally done it.\"\rLucy Liu is 'Sever'.  Antonio Banderas is 'Ecks'.  They fight.  Sever has kidnapped Ecks' son, and the kid has a 'nanobot assassin' inside of him which, as one would think, poses a problem.  The great thing about the film is the fact that most of the time, you won't even notice this going on.  Another critic stated that the film is loud and boring like a bad rock concert.  It's the amplifier feedback of film.  Director Wych Kaosayananda made his film debut with this one, then quickly faded away having lost $50,000,000 in the box office. \n"}]}
