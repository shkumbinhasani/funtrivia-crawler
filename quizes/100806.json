Most of the original teams folded after only a few years of playing, but a couple of them stayed afloat.  Only one of the original eleven franchises eventually relocated ... which one?", "correct": "Philadelphia Warriors", "options": ["Washington Capitols", "Detroit Falcons", "Chicago Stags"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhiladelphia Warriors.\n\n\tThe Falcons met their demise after the first season while the Stags managed a total of four seasons in the league.  The Capitols folded after the fifth season, but the Warriors managed to stick it out.  The Warriors moved from Philadelphia to San Francisco in 1962 and eventually relocated in Oakland, where they became the Golden State Warriors. \n"}, {"text": "In 1957 the Detroit Pistons came into being.  Prior to that year, in which town did they play?", "correct": "Fort Wayne", "options": ["Toronto", "Pittsburgh", "Providence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFort Wayne.\n\n\tFollowing their inaugural season the NBA made a lot of changes.  Many teams folded while some teams from smaller towns looked for a more populated location.  One example of this was the Pistons, who moved from the relatively sparsely populated Ft. Wayne to Detroit, an urban center.  It seems that the move was a success, as they remained in Detroit and won two championships (the 1989 and 1990 seasons). \n"}, {"text": "In its history, the Sacramento Kings franchise has played in all but which of the following cities?", "correct": "Baltimore", "options": ["Cincinnati", "Rochester", "Kansas City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaltimore.\n\n\tThe Sacramento Kings were born the 'Rochester Royals' in 1948 and played nine seasons in that New York town.  In 1957 they became the Cincinnati Royals, and stayed there for another 15 years.  From 1972 until 1985 they were the Kansas City Kings (also the Omaha Kings from 1972-1975, as they bounced between cities).  The franchise finally moved to Sacramento in 1985 and remained there to entertain fans armed with hoards of cowbells. \n"}, {"text": "Three of these franchises has never relocated as of 2002, which one is the odd team out?", "correct": "Atlanta Hawks", "options": ["Chicago Bulls", "Boston Celtics", "New York Knicks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtlanta Hawks.\n\n\tThe Knicks and the Celtics are both members of the original 11 and have each remained in their original locales as of 2002.  The Chicago Bulls were enfranchised in 1966 and went on to achieve great success in the 1990s, as all NBA fans are aware.  The Atlanta Hawks were originally called the Tri-Cities Blackhawks and came into being in 1949.  They moved to Milwaukee in 1951 and then to St. Louis in 1955 before finally settling in Atlanta in 1968. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these franchises changed both its location and its team name upon first moving?", "correct": "Philadelphia 76ers", "options": ["Los Angeles Lakers", "Golden State Warriors", "Houston Rockets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers.\n\n\tThe Warriors were originally called that, but were located in Philadelphia.  The Lakers likewise made a move but kept the team name.  Odd as it may sound for a city like Los Angeles that lies in a desert, the name made sense in Minneapolis.  The Rockets relocated from San Diego but also elected to keep the name, which makes good sense considering that Mission Control is located there!  The 76ers were originally called the Syracuse Nationals, a team name that would also have made sense in Philadelphia ... but nooo, they had to go and change it! \n"}, {"text": "The Seattle Supersonics franchise originally was located in Milwaukee?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNope, I lied.  The Supersonics were enfranchised in 1967 in Seattle and have remained there since.  I do believe that the two cities in question, Milwaukee and Seattle, have made a team exchange ... but that was baseball (the Seattle Pilots became the Milwaukee Brewers after only one season in the major leagues). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these NBA teams has either moved or changed its named the most times?", "correct": "Washington Wizards", "options": ["Los Angeles Clippers", "Sacramento Kings", "Portland Trailblazers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWashington Wizards.\n\n\tThe Wizards have gone through 6 incarnations.  They are:  Chicago Packers 1961-62, Chicago Zephyrs 1962-63, Baltimore Bullets 1963-73, Capital Bullets 1973-74, Washington Bullets 1974-97 and Washington Wizards 1997-present.  The Kings' travels were documented above in question 3.  The Clippers have had three places to call home (see question 8) while the Trailblazers have remained in Portland from 1970 until the present (2002). \n"}, {"text": "The Los Angeles Clippers were originally called the Buffalo Braves, a franchise that was founded in 1970.  Between Buffalo and Los Angeles, where did they play?", "correct": "San Diego", "options": ["St. Louis", "Indianapolis", "Nashville"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Diego.\n\n\tThe Braves moved to San Diego 1978 and remained there until 1984, when they moved to Los Angeles.  From 1984 they have played second fiddle to the Lakers...they should move back to San Diego, imho! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these cities went the longest between NBA franchises?", "correct": "Toronto", "options": ["Minneapolis", "Cleveland", "New Orleans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToronto.\n\n\tToronto waited 48 years between the Huskies (folded in 1947) and the Raptors, who began play in 1995.  Minneapolis was without a professional basketball team for 29 years, between 1960 (when the Lakers left) and 1989 (when the Timberwolves opened play).  Cleveland waited 23 years between the Rebels (folded in 1947) and the Cavaliers who were enfranchised in 1970.  New Orleans saw the Jazz leave in 1980, and finally reacquired NBA basketball via the Hornets in 2002, a 22 year wait. \n"}, {"text": "The Jazz were the only team to make a move from one city to another in the 1980s?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOf course I had to get a Jazz question in there!  The Jazz were one of three teams to move during the 1980s.  They left New Orleans for Salt Lake City in 1980.  As mentioned above, the Clippers and the Kings also made moves during the 'me' decade.  Thanks for playing this quiz! \n"}]}
