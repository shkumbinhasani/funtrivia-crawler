Where was this French artist, member of the first wave of the 20th century avant-garde assault on conservative aesthetic tradition, born?  \n", "correct": "Le Cateau", "options": ["Lille", "Limoges", "Cuiseaux"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLe Cateau.\n\n\tLa Cateau was a small town not far from where he would go to school, at Saint-Quentin in the mid 1880s.  His parents were involved in the grain business, but Henri had little interest in carrying on this family trade. \n"}, {"text": "After finishing secondary school, Henri went on to Paris.  He studied there for a year in order to become a part of which profession?  \n", "correct": "Law", "options": ["Medicine", "Architecture", "Accounting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaw.\n\n\tLike many fellow artists, Henri did not care much for his early education or initial profession.  His year of law school landed him a boring and repetitive job as a law clerk.  Was this all there was to life, Henri thought?  Fortunately for himself and the world, other interests would soon take hold... \n"}, {"text": "The key formative event in Matisse's young life came when he was 20 years old and recovering from a severe bout with which illness?  \n", "correct": "Appendicitis", "options": ["Epilepsy", "Influenza", "Dysentery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAppendicitis.\n\n\tIn 1890, while recovering from his appendicitis attack, his mother bought him a set of oil paints.  Spending his days painting simple pictures brought a realization to young Henry, the law was boring while painting was spiritually and emotionally fulfilling!  After sitting through some early morning art classes, he decided to abandon his law career and set out in pursuit of the arts. \n"}, {"text": "His first opportunity at an art education came ironically with the very conservative Adolphe-William Bouguereau.

Later in the 1890s he would study at the Acad\u00e9mie Carri\u00e8re, headed up by famous portraitist Eugene Carri\u00e8re. \n"}, {"text": "Matisse was 'rescued' from the stiflingly conservative style of Bouguereau by another famous French painter of the late 19th century.  Who was this French master that had his atelier set up at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts?  \n", "correct": "Moreau", "options": ["Derain", "Rouault", "Marquet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoreau.\n\n\tGustave Moreau, the famous French Symbolist artist, was one of the most admired avant-garde painters and teachers in Paris during this time.

Matisse met several other important artists in Moreau's studio, including Georges Rouault (Moreau's key disciple) and good friend Albert Marquet. \n"}, {"text": "In 1898, with his star rising, Matisse was married.

She helped support him early on by running a milliner's shop, and also helped promote his artwork.  Henri remained married to Am\u00e9lie until very late in his life, during World War II in fact, when they were legally separated.  It seems that Am\u00e9lie wanted to become active in the French resistance, while Matisse was withdrawn from the ugly events surrounding the war.  Eventually, the two were buried together... \n"}, {"text": "By the late 1890s, Matisse was becoming quite a significant figure among the French avant-garde painters.  A sign of his emerging leadership skills was his receiving of an honorary nickname from his peers.  What did the young, Parisian artists offer to Matisse as his new sobriquet?  \n", "correct": "The Doctor", "options": ["The General", "The Mayor", "The Chief"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Doctor.\n\n\tMatisse was nicknamed 'The Doctor', partially in jest at his appearance, with his long, red beard, but also because of his very solemn bearing.  This was a man to be taken seriously! \n"}, {"text": "Matisse had, of course, already felt the influence of the Impressionists by the early 1900s.  However, a fresh new influence was seeping into his brush that would help him develop his revolutionary use of pure, bright colors that characterize his most original works.  This influence would come from the 'Neo-Impressionist' artists involved in the technique commonly known as Pointillism.  Matisse read the writings of and befriended which practitioner of the Pointillist style in 1904? \n", "correct": "Signac", "options": ["Seurat", "Pissarro", "F\u00e9n\u00e9on"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSignac.\n\n\tSeurat, the founder of the Neo-Impressionist movement, had already expired a number of years before.  Paul Signac, friend of Seurat, had faithfully carried on the movement.  His writings very much affected Matisse's thinking, and he spent the summer of 1904 with Signac at St Tropez where he further indulged in the Pointillist technique.  Soon, however...he was to free himself from the constraints of the dot-technique characteristic of the Pointillists and move on to create something wholly new. \n"}, {"text": "The most consequential year in Matisse's art career came in 1905.  During that year, he and his colleagues Andr\u00e9 Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck, exhibited a number of paintings at the Salon d'Automne.  The powerful use of colors in the paintings at this exhibit created such a stir that art critic Louis Vauxcelles was driven to deem the artists collectively as which of these? \n", "correct": "Wild Beasts", "options": ["Chromatic Demons", "Savages", "Medusa's Children"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWild Beasts.\n\n\tVauxcelles, glancing from the paintings of Matisse and company to a sculpture of the early Renaissance style, was said to have exclaimed, \"Donatello au milieu des fauves!\" (Donatello among the wild beasts)  Thus the Fauvist movement received its name, and Matisse became 'Le Roi des Fauves' (The King of the Beasts). \n"}, {"text": "In 1910, Matisse created one of his most significant works.  Upon a blue background we see a circle of reddish-brown women, hands clasped in a ring of dance.  What is the title of this piece?  \n", "correct": "The Dance", "options": ["The Circle", "The Ring", "The Bacchanal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dance.\n\n\t'The Dance' is possibly Matisse's most memorable and recognizable work.  I believe you have seen it, but I will offer you this web-link to be sure:  http://www.abcgallery.com/M/matisse/matisse146.html \n"}, {"text": "During the entire decade of the 1910s Matisse fell under the varying influences of a number of sources.  Visits to Moscow allowed him to observe the iconic art of the middle ages, while visits to the Islamic world, and especially Morocco, allowed for a creeping in of Arab influence in his works.  In the late 1910s he also paid a series of visits to which aging Impressionist artist, whose works seriously affected the Matisse paintings of the 1920s?  \n", "correct": "Renoir", "options": ["Morisot", "Monet", "Degas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRenoir.\n\n\tRenoir would soon pass on (in 1919) but not before he imparted a great amount of wisdom to an already very mature Matisse.  Matisse was never egoistic enough to believe that new influences couldn't be brought in and he accepted gratefully the words of wisdom that were imparted from Renoir's elderly imagination.  Matisse's works during the 1920s, particularly his large, female figures, owe their creation partially from Matisse's Renoir-experience. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: Though Matisse is known to us as one of the great painters of the 20th century, he was unsuccessful in his attempts at working in the realm of sculpture.  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMatisse was (and is) considered a highly accomplished sculptor, and his works in bronze stand as some of the premier pieces of the early 19th century avant-garde in that aesthetic category.  His best known series of sculptures is called 'Back I-IV' (to be seen in the London Tate Gallery).  See 'Back IV' here: http://www.matissepicasso.com/matissepicasso.gb/02confrontations/zoom05d.html \n"}, {"text": "In 1941, ill health forced Matisse to slow down his professional work.  With which of these maladies did the already 70-year old Matisse suffer, requiring surgery?  \n", "correct": "Stomach cancer", "options": ["Stroke", "Brain tumor", "Prostate cancer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStomach cancer.\n\n\tSadly, Henri's ill health slowed him down during one of the most productive periods of his career.  The truth is, Matisse was always productive, from beginning to end, and he eventually made a reasonable recovery from his stomach cancer.  Some of his most significant works were created after his 70th birthday! \n"}, {"text": "At nearly 80-years old, Matisse, remaining remarkably active, undertook an entire architectural project.  He designed and built a small chapel as a return favor for a woman who had helped him during his period of convalescence.  In which town was this chapel built between 1948 and 1951?  \n", "correct": "Vence", "options": ["Nancy", "Fontainebleau", "Aregentan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVence.\n\n\tThe Chapel of the Rosary, in Vence, France, was truly one of Matisse's most astounding triumphs.  The entire chapel, including the priest's vestments and stained-glass windows were designed by him.  Matisse also created murals on the white-tiled wall, all in black outline.  Excellent pictures of the chapel can be viewed here: http://old.jccc.net/~jjackson/matisse.html \n"}, {"text": "In the final years of Matisse's life he gave up painting in favor of his 'Gouaches D\u00e9coup\u00e9es'.  Of which objects did these works of arts consist?  \n", "correct": "Paper cut-outs", "options": ["Leaves and other vegetation", "Pieces of scrap metal", "Sea shells"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaper cut-outs.\n\n\tAlready surpassing 80 years of age, Matisse found it difficult to continue painting, but he continued to be active with his new project which he developed using his paper cut-outs.  An example of one of these virtual collages can be found at the website listed in the chapel question above.
