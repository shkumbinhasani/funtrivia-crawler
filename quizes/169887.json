{"id": "169887", "name": " American Presidents in Classic Movies Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "World Leaders in Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "The finest movie about an actual president may be \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\". Raymond Massey was superb in the role of Honest Abe; who played his adversary, Stephen Douglas?", "correct": "Gene Lockhart", "options": ["Arthur Kennedy", "Martin Balsam", "Robert Ryan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGene Lockhart.\n\n\tThere's fine acting by Lockhart (and by Ruth Gordon as Mary Todd) ... but the top honors have to go to Massey for his brilliant portrayal of Lincoln in this film version of a Robert E. Sherwood play. \n"}, {"text": "Even before \"JFK\" and \"Thirteen Days\", there was a movie about \"The Missiles of October\". Who played President Kennedy?", "correct": "William Devane", "options": ["John Gavin", "Martin Sheen", "Sterling Hayden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Devane.\n\n\tDevane was fine in the role of JFK in this fine real-life thriller; a very young Sheen played RFK.  (The Costner film, \"Thirteen Days\", was also good.) \n"}, {"text": "Oliver Stone (who directed \"JFK\") also directed \"Nixon\". Who played the title role?", "correct": "Anthony Hopkins", "options": ["Jack Lemmon", "Jason Robards", "Charles Durning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnthony Hopkins.\n\n\tHopkins is versatile, but this movie didn't work for me. (On the other hand, does Nixon deserve a \"good\" movie?) \n"}, {"text": "\"Sunrise at Campobello\" was about FDR. Who played him?", "correct": "Ralph Bellamy", "options": ["Randolph Scott", "Joel McCrea", "Gregory Peck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRalph Bellamy.\n\n\tThis is, I believe, one of the roles for which Bellamy is best known. \n"}, {"text": "Charlton Heston has portrayed this president on more than one occasion.", "correct": "Andrew Jackson", "options": ["James Monroe", "James Madison", "John Adams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndrew Jackson.\n\n\tHeston has played Andrew Jackson in a variety of westerns, including \"The President's Lady\". (I'm not sure why ... perhaps it just worked out that way.) \n"}, {"text": "\"Seven Days in May\" pitted Kirk Douglas against Burt Lancaster in a plot to overthrow the government. Who played the president?", "correct": "Fredric March", "options": ["Charles Laughton", "Victor Mature", "Richard Widmark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFredric March.\n\n\tThis was a fine adaptation (by Rod Serling) of the excellent Knebel & Bailey novel. \n"}, {"text": "\"The American President\" featured Michael Douglas in the title role. Who played the challenging candidate from the other party?", "correct": "Richard Dreyfuss", "options": ["James Caan", "Robert Culp", "James Garner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Dreyfuss.\n\n\tThis thoroughly entertaining movie came to the screen via Aaron Sorkin. Annette Bening co-starred (with Martin Sheen and Michael J. Fox). \n"}, {"text": "\"Fail Safe\" was a taut cold war thriller. Who starred in the key role of President?", "correct": "Henry Fonda", "options": ["Glenn Ford", "James Stewart", "Don Murray"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry Fonda.\n\n\tFonda is always excellent as the strong, silent man of integrity and character (as in \"Twelve Angry Men\"). Here, he's very believable as a President who is confronting the ultimate national nightmare. \n"}, {"text": "Henry Fonda starred as a decent presidential candidate in \"The Best Man\". Who starred as his scoundrel opponent for the nomination?", "correct": "Cliff Robertson", "options": ["Robert Cummings", "Fred MacMurray", "John Payne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCliff Robertson.\n\n\tDo the ends justify the means? That's a question for Fonda to deal with in this very well-done movie. \n"}, {"text": "\"Suddenly\" involves a plot to kill the president. Who plays the would-be assassin?", "correct": "Frank Sinatra", "options": ["Dean Martin", "Tony Curtis", "William Holden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank Sinatra.\n\n\tPicture young Sinatra as a hit man and you're on the right track. This was a different kind of role for him. \n"}]}
