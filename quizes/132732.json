{"id": "132732", "name": "Double sound words yet again.Now don't go \"gaga\" ! Quiz | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "English", "Vocabulary"], "questions": [{"text": "Which one of these means you are \"up to no good\" or perhaps being naughty in a sexual way?", "correct": "hanky-panky", "options": ["snoggy-roggy", "handy-dandy", "kissy-wissy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhanky-panky.\n\n\t\"Kissy-wissy\" is the sort of baby-talk indulged in by lovers. \n"}, {"text": "In what context could you use the term \"go-go\"?", "correct": "when talking of a scantily clad and perhaps erotic dancer", "options": ["when talking about an unethical business deal", "when talking of the traffic light system in London", "when describing the signals of underwater divers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwhen talking of a scantily clad and perhaps erotic dancer.\n\n\tThere's a line in a country song where a dancing girl warns a middle-aged man on the prowl that he shouldn't \"do-si-do with a go-go\" if he doesn't actually mean it. Perhaps a \"go-go\" dancer would wear a \"ra-ra\" skirt. \n"}, {"text": "Which is the correct definition of \"namby-pamby\"?", "correct": "weak, sentimental and insipid", "options": ["vague and confused", "slow-moving and dull", "annoyingly lazy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nweak, sentimental and insipid.\n\n\tIt is definitely a term of abuse suggesting that someone needs to show a little more backbone and not have such a half-hearted approach. There is also a term \"niminy-piminy\" which seems to have the same meaning but which is apparently less acceptable to dictionaries. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following means a \"violent exchange of blows or words\"?", "correct": "ding-dong", "options": ["clip-lip", "blackjack", "pot-shot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nding-dong.\n\n\t\"Ding-dong\" is also used by people to suggest the sound of a bell. A \"pot-shot\" looks like a possible \"double sound\" word but it means an \"easy or random shot\", and does not necessarily imply any violence (although it may be used to refer to a verbal put-down, its idiomatic usage suggests nastiness rather than violencejust nastiness). One meaning of \"blackjack\" can certainly suggest violence but it doesn't fit the meaning in the question. \n"}, {"text": "What name might you give to a person who is involved in lots of business or money-making schemes, usually displaying a great deal of energy and ingenuity?", "correct": "a wheeler-dealer", "options": ["a dark-shark", "a rolling-bone", "a tricky-dicky"], "explanation": "\n\n\na wheeler-dealer.\n\n\tThere is, of course, always some suggestion that \"a wheeler dealer\" is slightly unscrupulous in his or her dealings. \"Tricky-Dicky\" was a term used about a certain American President. How he must have wished he could have had the support that a previous president got with badges that said, \"I like Ike\". \n"}, {"text": "A \"dum-dum\" is a soft-nosed expanding bullet. But where does the word \"dum-dum\" actually come from?", "correct": "The name of a neighborhood in Kolkata, India", "options": ["Because it was thought of as a stupid or \"dumb\" idea", "The sound it makes when it strikes a target", "Because it works well when used with a silencer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe name of a neighborhood in Kolkata, India.\n\n\tThere is no doubt that there was a time when a \"dum-dum\" was a term of abuse for anybody who was considered to be stupid. However, this has no connection with the place in India where it is believed such bullets were first manufactured. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following words was specially devised to reproduce the sound of raindrops?", "correct": "pitter-patter", "options": ["splish-splash", "slip-slop", "frou-frou"], "explanation": "\n\n\npitter-patter.\n\n\t\"Splish-splash\" and \"slip-slop\" both suggest a heavier movement of water - perhaps like someone moving about in a bath. \"Frou-frou\" is used to describe a rustling noise such as would be produced by a voluminous woman's skirt.  Nowadays, pitter-patter is used in other senses than the sound of rain - we might refer to the pitter-patter of little feet as the children scurry around the house, for example. \n"}, {"text": "What is \"tittle-tattle\"?", "correct": "gossip", "options": ["an argument", "rubbish", "food"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngossip.\n\n\tA tasty morsel of food is sometimes known as a \"titbit\", although it can also be defined as a \"pleasing bit of scandal\". There has even been a magazine called \"Tit-bits\". \"Tittle-tattle\" perhaps belongs to the same family but may also suggest the sound of banal conversation. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is another word for \"conference\"?", "correct": "powwow", "options": ["Mau-Mau", "war-war", "walk-talk"], "explanation": "\n\n\npowwow.\n\n\tThe word \"powwow\" is from the Native Americans. It was Winston Churchill who said it was better to \"jaw-jaw\" than to \"war war\" but this coining never became popular enough to make it into common parlance. \n"}, {"text": "What is \"juju\"?", "correct": "the power from an object superstitiously revered as a charm or fetish", "options": ["any of several spiny trees with yellowish flowers", "a dark red edible fruit", "a lozenge of gelatin or sugar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe power from an object superstitiously revered as a charm or fetish.\n\n\tThe object can be \"juju\" and the power of the object is also called \"juju\". The other three answers all refer to the word \"jujube\" which is a tree, the fruit of the tree and a flavoured lozenge. I hope this quiz wasn't a \"no-no\" for you ! \n"}]}
