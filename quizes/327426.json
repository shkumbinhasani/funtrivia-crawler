Original copies with the peel-off sticker are now collector's items. \n"}, {"text": "Edward Ruscha's 1962 painting \"Actual Size\" features a can of what food?", "correct": "Spam", "options": ["Corned Beef", "Peas", "Tuna fish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpam.\n\n\tThe painting features a large Spam logo as well as an \"actual size\" picture of Spam.

Some of the details of fruit carving can be very tiny, so a special knife is used to carve.  Which of these knives is used for the finer details in fruit carving?", "correct": "Thai knife", "options": ["Meat cleaver", "Paring knife", "Sashimi knife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThai knife.\n\n\tWatermelon is often used to make red (or pink) roses and other flowers; the red flesh makes a good background to a scene made from the green and white outer flesh.

It easily cuts through watermelon without making a huge mess out of it, and it can get into small crevices and cut away very small pieces of fruit. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes people even use eggshells in their art!

The laser can cut small layers off the shell to create a layered look, for instance feathers of a bird, or it can cut right through to make holes in the shell and create intricate designs.  It is fascinating; Google \"eggshell carving\" to see pictures.\r Interesting fact: Dr. Lew Jensen was the first person to carve an eggshell.  He used dentist's tools to carve the shell, a lot harder than using a laser! \n"}, {"text": "Food art is also the art of making a plate of food look nice.  This could be the simple arrangement of the food to make it look more appetizing, or it could mean actually making art out of the food.  For instance, thin pieces of cucumber can be wrapped around themselves to form a rose, or strawberry slices can be arranged to form a star.  Even a smiley face pancake is considered food art.

It can also mean food art, however.  Oranges can be carved to look like a flower and put on the plate, chocolate or lemon peel can be sliced into curls and put on the plate, or a simple Jell-O dessert can be formed into a shape to make food art. All are forms of garnishing, and all of this art is edible (though not always the tastiest, like sprigs of fresh rosemary; might not be the tastiest art). \n"}]}
