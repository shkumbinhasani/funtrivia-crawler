The word 'Christmas' literally means 'Mass of Christ'.  As for a 'twenty-four-hour period', well, heck, you know what that is!\r The cost of these twelve days of Christmas, according to 'The Christmas Index of December 2005, would be $18,348.87, in 2005 dollars. (Seven Swans-a-Swimming, for example, would cost about $4,200.) \n"}, {"text": "Let us say, for the sake of fun, that a true word-nerd were allowed to rename each Christmas song. Which song might then be renamed 'Light, Mellow Resonant Sounds Emanating from Hollow Metallic Objects, Shaped Like Inverted Cups'?", "correct": "Jingle Bells", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJingle Bells.\n\n\t'Jingle Bells', known previously as 'One Horse Open Sleigh', was written by a Mr. James Pierpont in 1857 for Thanksgiving. Later, it became associated with Christmas, though, if you'll notice, the song contains no mention of the latter holiday. \n"}, {"text": "Our dictionary elves have been working overtime for this quiz. For which popular song have they come up with the fresh new title, 'Do Not Impede or Forbid in Any Case the Occurrence of Frozen Atmospheric Water Vapor Descending Lightly upon the Earth's Surface'?", "correct": "Let it Snow!", "options": ["Winter Wonderland", "Step into Christmas", "Sleigh Ride"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLet it Snow!.\n\n\t'Let it Snow!' was written in 1945. Here are the lyrics from the first verse:\r Oh, the weather outside is frightful, \rBut the fire is so delightful; \rAnd since we've no place to go, \rLet It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! \n"}, {"text": "Which festive individual would be unhappy with the Christmas song title 'Festoon the Elongated, Walled Enclosures Used Typically for Passage'? Apparently, for one, the person who chose which actual name for the tune?", "correct": "Deck the Halls", "options": ["I'll be Home for Christmas", "Hang the Mistletoe", "Under the Tree"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeck the Halls.\n\n\t'Deck the Halls' is another one of those Christmas songs that doesn't contain the word 'Christmas', though the synomymous word 'yule' does appear. The song is derived from a traditional Welsh winter carol entitled 'Nos Galan'. \r By the way, the word 'festoon' may be used as a synonym for 'decorate', which is another term for 'deck'. \n"}, {"text": "Don't be sad if the Christmas song 'Azure Nativity' received a more familiar title, namely...?", "correct": "Blue Christmas", "options": ["Green Christmas", "White Christmas", "Red Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue Christmas.\n\n\tErnest Tubb was the first performer to make 'Blue Christmas' a hit (in 1949), but the world is most familiar with the Elvis Presley version of the somewhat downbeat tune.\r Azure is a shade of blue, while the word 'nativity' is sometimes used in place of Christmas. \n"}, {"text": "'Argent-Colored, Suspended Metal Tubes Found in a Campanile' is an admittedly cumbersome renaming of which delicate Christmas classic?", "correct": "Silver Bells", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilver Bells.\n\n\t'Silver Bells' is one of the most oft-recorded Christmas tune, none more famously that Bing Crosby's 1951 version. Jay Livingston and Ray Evans were the songwriters. They originally intended to call it 'Tinkle Bells'...no idea how I would have handled 'tinkle' in other words!\r The adjectival word 'argent' is from the Latin 'argentum', meaning silver. A campanile is a bell tower (a word derived from the Latin 'campana', meaning 'bell'). \n"}, {"text": "'Xmas of the Initial, Ordinal, Arithmetical Value'...wow, that's a mouthful. I would be all for going with that fancified name over the chosen title for which Christmas favorite?", "correct": "The First Noel", "options": ["Twelve Days of Christmas", "All Alone for Christmas", "Only on Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe First Noel.\n\n\t'The First Noel', also written with the awesome umlaut as 'The First No\u00ebl', is an 'ancient' English Christmas song. No\u00ebl is the French term for 'Christmas', derived as it is from the Latin term 'natalis', meaning 'birth'. \n"}, {"text": "Let's go crazy. Which classic Christmas song should be renamed 'Appreciative Feelings of Great Pleasure or Euphoria Bestowed in the Direction of a Cerulean-Hued Globe Rotating at the Approximate Distance of an Astronomical Unit around the Sun' if we get our way?", "correct": "Joy to the World", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoy to the World.\n\n\tOkay, let's not rename it, then, but rather try to decipher some elements of this alternate name. 'Cerulean-hued' is another potential word for 'blue', the color of the Earth (or 'world'), or in the case of this question, the 'globe rotating at the approximate distance of an astronomical unit around the Sun'. An astronomical unit (or AU) is approximately equal to 93 million miles, or 149.6 million kilometers, or the average distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the Sun. \n"}, {"text": "Okay, back to reality. I'm quite certain that players of this quiz will find the title 'A Nocturnal Unit of Time Sans Acoustical Accompaniment' a perfectly reasonable replacement for which beloved Christmas carol?", "correct": "Silent Night", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilent Night.\n\n\t'Silent Night' was originally written as a German carol by Franz Gruber (music), with lyrics added by Josef Mohr (who entitled the song 'Stille Nacht'). Perhaps the most famous English-language performance of the song was by Frank Sinatra.\r 'Nocturnal' is an adjective for 'night'. \n"}, {"text": "Finally, may I suggest the bland but effective title 'Yule-Related Musical Composition' in place of the equally bland original name for which popular Christmas song made famous by Nat King Cole?", "correct": "The Christmas Song", "options": ["Jingle Bell Rock", "Merry Christmas, Darling", "Christmas Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Christmas Song.\n\n\tThough Nat King Cole made the song famous, it was Mel Torme who penned the classic Yule-related (aka Christmas) tune with Bob Wells in 1944.
