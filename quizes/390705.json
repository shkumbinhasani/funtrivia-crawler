Since a point is not a border (it has no length), areas that meet at a point are not considered bordering. \n"}, {"text": "These national-level highways go through Medina County, TX.", "correct": "US-90 & I-35", "options": ["US-90 & I-10", "US-90 only", "I-10 & I-35"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUS-90 & I-35.\n\n\tUS-90 cuts through the county east/west, nearly dividing it into equal pieces.\r I-35 cuts through the southeast corner of the county.

When the original Bexar county (which occupied the western half of what is now Texas) was split up into smaller counties, they were *mostly* made up of little rectangles.  However, the northeast corner of Medina follows the course of the Medina River, then has a NE/SW border until it meets Bexar County.  \r So it roughly a concave/convex hexagon. \n"}, {"text": "How many independent school districts (ISDs) serve any part of Medina County?", "correct": "8", "options": ["1", "5", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n8.\n\n\tThey are D'Hanis, Devine, Hondo, Lytle, Medina Valley, Natalia, Northside, and Utopia ISDs.\r Some ISD are completely in the county (Hondo, D'Hanis).
