From what part of his body did these come?", "correct": "His chest", "options": ["His fingers", "His eyes", "The palms of his hands"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis chest.\n\n\tWhen his power first manifested, Jono blew off his lower mouth and upper chest, leaving him able to speak only telepathically. He does not need to breathe or eat. \n"}, {"text": "Jono is completely immune to the \"Death Force\" of Omega Red.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThere are two theories concerning Jono and his psionic energy. One theory is that the psionic energy sustains him, as he does not have several vital organs. Another is that his body is simply a shell, and he is really made up entirely of psionic energy. This would explain why Omega Red has no power over him. \n"}, {"text": "Which mutant attacked Generation X, only to be convinced by Jono to cease her attacks?", "correct": "Penance", "options": ["Riptide", "Malady", "Husk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPenance.\n\n\tPenance has red skin, and thus can sympathize with the freakish-looking Jono.

The victims were all mutants, but which mutant stayed behind after the fact?", "correct": "Amber", "options": ["Paige", "Liz", "Melanie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmber.\n\n\tAmber was a reptillian mutant who decided to stay in the college even after ESU shut their mutant student program down.
