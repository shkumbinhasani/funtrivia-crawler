From here you can do the 6-6 stack.  You do the first 6 stack with the two 3 stacks you just brought together, and then do the next 6 stack. You bring these two stacks together to make a stack of 12.  You take two to the side and have one face up, the other face down.  You make a 10 stack with the remaining 10 cups.  With the other 2 cups, after flipping the cups and hitting them on the table, you take down the 10 stack to bring yourself back to the original 3-6-3 stack again. \n"}, {"text": "Who had the record of the fastest cycle time for 4 years?", "correct": "Emily Fox", "options": ["Robin Stangenberg", "Steven Purugganan", "Timo Reuhl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmily Fox.\n\n\tEmily Fox, Bob Fox's own daughter, had the record of the fastest time for the cycle ever for four years!

This gets players prepared for the competition at hand, because once they use the plastic cups, it feels lighter to them, so they can more easily glide across the cups to get fast times.  All cups, whether metal or plastic, have three holes in each top. This is to prevent sunction between the cups, so the cups will more easily come apart from each other.  Don't try to use your own plastic cups, as they will not work!  You can get cups fairly cheap at any WalMart or Target!  It is worth getting the real things.  They even have special training cups. \n"}]}
