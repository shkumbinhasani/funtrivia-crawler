{"id": "134473", "name": "Atticus in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" Quiz | Literature | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors L-P", " Harper Lee"], "questions": [{"text": "What happened to the first two clients that Atticus ever had in Maycomb?", "correct": "They were hanged.", "options": ["Both clients were found not guilty and freed.", "They were sentenced to life imprisonment.", "One got off and one was hanged."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey were hanged.\n\n\tThe Haverfords were hanged. Atticus wanted them to plead guilty to second-degree murder but they were too stubborn. Atticus had studied law but Scout believes that he soon developed a distaste for the criminal rather than the civil side of law. \n"}, {"text": "How did Atticus meet the woman who became his wife and the mother of Jem and Scout?", "correct": "He met her in Montgomery when he was elected to the legislature.", "options": ["He met her in Maycomb where they both grew up.", "He met her in Montgomery when he was studying law.", "He met her in Boston when he went to visit his brother."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe met her in Montgomery when he was elected to the legislature.\n\n\tAtticus was fifteen years older than his wife. She was a Graham from Montgomery. Scout could not remember her mother enough to miss her. Jem sometimes had to go off and play by himself when he thought about her. \n"}, {"text": "Why did Jem take Scout to school on her first day?", "correct": "Atticus gave Jem some money so Jem would take her.", "options": ["Atticus gave Jem a talk about how he should look after her.", "Scout didn't know how to get to the school.", "Calpurnia wouldn't be allowed to go near the school."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtticus gave Jem some money so Jem would take her.\n\n\tPossibly Jem would have looked after Scout anyway but the money jingling in his pockets meant that Atticus had given him some encouragement. Jem has to warn Scout not to try to play games with him like they did when they were at home. \n"}, {"text": "At what time of day did Atticus almost accidentally teach Scout how to read?", "correct": "Every evening as he read the papers.", "options": ["As soon as he got home in the afternoon.", "First thing in the morning as he read the paper.", "During lunch-times when he came home from his office."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvery evening as he read the papers.\n\n\tIt was every evening when Scout would crawl into his lap and watch his moving finger as he read aloud.  For Scout reading became as important as breathing. \n"}, {"text": "What reason did Atticus give Scout for why all the professional people in Maycomb, including lawyers, were relatively poor?", "correct": "All the farmers were poor and had no money to pay them.", "options": ["They had lost their money in the stock market crash.", "There were too many professionals in Maycomb.", "The government had put up their taxes."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll the farmers were poor and had no money to pay them.\n\n\tIt is typical of Atticus that he takes the time to give a full explanation of the community in which Scout and Jem live. Mr. Cunningham can't pay him in money but he will eventually try to pay him in \"kind\". \n"}, {"text": "Where did Atticus receive his early education?", "correct": "He was taught at home by his father.", "options": ["He went to school in nearby Abbotsville.", "He went to the same school in Maycomb as Scout and Jem.", "He went to school in the state capital Montgomery."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was taught at home by his father.\n\n\tAmidst the trauma of her first day at school Scout remembers that her father and her Uncle Jack had been educated at home by her grandfather. She wonders why Atticus can't teach her in the same way. \n"}, {"text": "In what way did Atticus try to justify to Scout Mr.Ewell's hunting \"out of season\"?", "correct": "He talks about the Ewell children's hunger pains.", "options": ["He says the hunting laws are outdated.", "He says the local landowners deserve all they get.", "He says that it's pointless trying to change Mr. Ewell."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe talks about the Ewell children's hunger pains.\n\n\tScout has been brought up to respect the letter of the law. She tries to turn this in her favour by pointing out that Burris Ewell only ever has to go to the first day of school. Atticus uses the example of Mr. Ewell being able to get away with illegal hunting to show how some circumstances can change the way you feel about the law. \n"}, {"text": "How does Atticus get Jem to come down from the tree-house?", "correct": "He tells Scout to pay no attention to him and he will come down.", "options": ["He orders Jem directly to come down from the tree-house.", "He tells Scout to pass on his order that Jem must come down.", "He tells Calpurnia not to allow him any food."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe tells Scout to pay no attention to him and he will come down.\n\n\tAtticus reveals that he has a pretty good grasp of child psychology. He also maintains his dignity by not resorting to either bribes or threats. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the following observation about Atticus by Miss Maudie: \"Atticus Finch is the same in his house as he is....\"", "correct": "\"on the public streets.\"", "options": ["\"as when he is speaking to his neighbours.\"", "\"as when he is when consulted by one of his clients\".", "\"as he is when he is addressing a jury.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"on the public streets.\"\n\n\tThere are no mysteries or unpleasant secrets about Atticus that he keeps concealed. Unlike the Radleys where everything is shrouded in mystery and rumour and gossip can create wild stories, Atticus' life is an open book. \n"}, {"text": "What achievement of Jem's made Atticus declare...\"I'll never worry about what'll become of you, son, you'll always have an idea...\"?", "correct": "Building the snowman by using soil and snow.", "options": ["Working out that the Radley tree wasn't really dying.", "Deciding not to return the blanket to the Radley house.", "Looking after Scout on the night of the fire."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuilding the snowman by using soil and snow.\n\n\tAtticus is pleased at Jem's inventiveness in using the soil as the base for the snow-man figure. Later he warns him he ought not to make a caricature of any of the neighbours. \n"}, {"text": "How did Atticus react when Scout started to curse and swear?", "correct": "He decided it was a phase she was going through and ignored it.", "options": ["He told her she would have to stop it or get smacked.", "He warned her Uncle Jack would smack her if she swore.", "He said it was an insult to her dead mother when she swore."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe decided it was a phase she was going through and ignored it.\n\n\tThe contrast between Atticus's and Uncle Jack's attitude to swearing shows that Atticus has learned to be extremely patient and long-suffering as a parent.  He doesn't get annoyed when Jack hits Scout even though she has been provoked. He rightly concludes that she \"had it coming\". \n"}, {"text": "How did Atticus react to Aunt Alexandra's wish that Scout should be a \"ray of sunshine\" in her father's life?", "correct": "He told Scout he didn't mind her much the way she was.", "options": ["He told Aunt Alexandra to mind her own business.", "He told Scout to follow exactly what Aunt Alexandra said.", "He told Scout she already was a \"ray of sunshine\"."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe told Scout he didn't mind her much the way she was.\n\n\tAtticus would never be discourteous to his sister but he didn't really want to try to turn Scout in to something that she wasn't. He neither praised Scout nor scolded her but merely pointed out that he considered there were already enough rays of sunshine in the family. \n"}, {"text": "How did Atticus respond to Scout's request that he should ask Aunt Alexandra for her to be allowed to sit at the big table at Christmas?", "correct": "He merely said he had no influence because he was a guest.", "options": ["He said that he would try but probably fail.", "He told Scout that it would be totally futile to ask Aunt Alexandra.", "He told Scout not to talk such nonsense."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe merely said he had no influence because he was a guest.\n\n\tAgain Atticus apparently tries to take the heat out of a situation which he knows Scout finds irksome. There is no good scolding Scout or protesting to his sister about the seating arrangements. He uses instead the rules of courtesy to deflect the argument. \n"}, {"text": "What was the main difference between Uncle Jack and Atticus that Scout pointed out after he had spanked her?", "correct": "Atticus always listens to both sides of the story.", "options": ["Atticus would never spank her on the bottom.", "Atticus did not mind swearing.", "Atticus always waited a day before he punished her."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtticus always listens to both sides of the story.\n\n\tAtticus's sense of fairplay has been passed on to his children. Though Scout has been on the receiving end of punishment by her father, she usually comes to see that he had treated her justly. This has been particularly true when she has been in dispute with Jem. \n"}, {"text": "What did it take Scout several years to figure out about the conversation she overheard between her father and Uncle Jack?", "correct": "That her father intended her to hear it.", "options": ["Why Uncle Jack had not told on her.", "That Atticus knew he was going to lose the rape case.", "Why Atticus was not angry with her about  Francis."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat her father intended her to hear it.\n\n\tUncle Jack does not tell Atticus why Scout hit Francis. Atticus has already told Scout and Jem that they are going to lose the case. Why he wants Scout to overhear this conversation is because he's trying to get across that he knows how much she is trying to keep her head and stay out of trouble whilst the case is on. \n"}, {"text": "What compliment about Atticus's legal skills did Miss Maudie make to Scout?", "correct": "He could make people's will so airtight they couldn't be changed.", "options": ["He always did the best for each of his clients.", "He nearly always won each case for his clients.", "He knew all the laws of Alabama by heart."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe could make people's will so airtight they couldn't be changed.\n\n\tJem and Scout try hard to find something about their father that they can be proud about. Miss Maudie's compliment does not mean much when they considered the sporting achievements of their friends' parents. \n"}, {"text": "What is Jem's main reaction to the way in which Atticus deals with the mad dog incident? He is ...", "correct": "proud of the fact that his father never boasted about being a dead shot.", "options": ["scared that his father will be hurt in the incident.", "happy that he can now boast about his father for a change.", "angry with Scout for doubting their father could shoot straight."], "explanation": "\n\n\nproud of the fact that his father never boasted about being a dead shot.\n\n\tJem understands that the most important thing about the incident is the way his father takes no pride in what he has done. His father is a crack-shot and yet never mentioned it, even when his children were disappointed in him compared with other fathers. Jem tells Scout that they must never boast about what Atticus has done. \n"}, {"text": "What were Atticus's instructions about his children's behaviour towards Mrs. Dubose when she began to provoke them?", "correct": "\"hold your head high and be a gentleman\".", "options": ["\"pass by on the other side of the road\".", "\"shout back and show that you are not afraid of her\".", "\"keep quiet and run past before she can say anything\"."], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"hold your head high and be a gentleman\".\n\n\tThe way in which Atticus could speak politely to Mrs.Dubose and tell her all the latest news convinced Scout that her father was one of the bravest men who ever lived. Atticus uses the whole episode to show his children the different sort of courage that Mrs. Dubose possessed when she fought to clear herself of the morphine addiction. \n"}, {"text": "What was Atticus's reaction when he found out that his children had been to Calpurnia's church and heard Scout's description of the proceedings?", "correct": "He seemed to enjoy what he heard.", "options": ["He was not really interested because he was busy.", "He told Calpurnia off for taking them there.", "He was annoyed that the children had gone there."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe seemed to enjoy what he heard.\n\n\tIt is Aunt Alexandra who makes the biggest fuss over what had happened. Atticus has total trust in Calpurnia and defends her from all of Aunt Alexandra's comments. \n"}, {"text": "What is the first thing that Atticus says to Dill when he is found hiding out under Scout's bed?", "correct": "He asks him whether he is hungry.", "options": ["He tells him he has been a total fool to run away.", "He asks him whether his mother knows where he is.", "He tells him he will be sent straight back home."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe asks him whether he is hungry.\n\n\tAtticus retains his composure at all times. He deals with the practical things first of all as means of reassuring Dill that he has nothing to fear. Jem has proved himself responsible by breaking the childhood code of never informing on another child. Jem knew that Dill's mother would be suffering if she didn't know where he was. \n"}, {"text": "What was the one gesture of affection towards his children that Atticus indulged in on the night they face the mob outside the jail?", "correct": "He massaged Jem's hair.", "options": ["He kissed Scout on the top of her head.", "He held them both by the hand.", "He patted Jem on the back."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe massaged Jem's hair.\n\n\tEarlier Atticus had tried to make his children go home because he didn't want them caught up in the violence outside the jail. Jem had defied him and refused to obey orders. As they walk home Atticus massaged Jem's hair to indicate that all was understood and forgiven. Of course we should also mention that Scout used to crawl into his lap each night as he read the papers. \n"}, {"text": "What was Atticus attempting to suggest by getting Bob Ewell to write his name?", "correct": "That he was left-handed and the person who hit Mayella on the face.", "options": ["That he was illiterate and his evidence untrustworthy.", "That he could write and was not ignorant like he pretended.", "That he was right-handed and the person who hit Mayella on the face."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat he was left-handed and the person who hit Mayella on the face.\n\n\tAtticus spends a lot of time getting Heck Tate to descibe Mayella's injuries and which side of her face was most hurt. He then makes sure that Bob Ewell declares he agrees with this evidence. When Bob Ewell shows he is left-handed it is obvious that the right-hand side of her face is the side most likely to show the bruising. \n"}, {"text": "As well as standing up when Atticus leaves court what other method did the negroes in the community use to show how they respected his efforts for Tom Robinson at the trial?", "correct": "They send him chicken, ham and lots of other food as gifts.", "options": ["They all club together to pay Tom Robinson's fees.", "They collect money to buy Atticus a special tie.", "They start to do little jobs around the Finch garden."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey send him chicken, ham and lots of other food as gifts.\n\n\tAny money in the coloured community was actually used to help out Tom's wife Helen and her little children. Atticus is overwhelmed by the gifts of food that arrive at his house and tells Calpurnia to tell her people that times are too hard for them to give him gifts. \n"}, {"text": "What was Atticus's response to Bob Ewell's challenge, \"Too proud to fight...\" after he had spat in Atticus's face?", "correct": "\"No, too old...\"", "options": ["\"It wouldn't prove anything if I did.\"", "\"Not with the likes of you.\"", "\"I'll send for the sheriff.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"No, too old...\"\n\n\tMiss Stephanie Crawford regards Atticus's reaction as a \"dry\" or witty response. Atticus tells Jem and Scout that he would rather Bob Ewell took his anger out on him than on Mayella and any of the other children. He didn't have any deep-seated fears about what Ewell might do in the future. He is too civilised to suspect what actually happens. \n"}, {"text": "Which line said by Scout tells us that she has understood why Atticus is going to agree to the lie told by Heck Tate that Bob Ewell died by falling on a knife? ", "correct": "\"It'd be sort of like shootin' a mocking-bird, wouldn't it?\"", "options": ["\"Bob Ewell deserved all that happened to him.\"", "\"It was so dark and confusing out there.\"", "\"I knew it wasn't Jem who had killed him.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"It'd be sort of like shootin' a mocking-bird, wouldn't it?\".\n\n\tScout has understood that Boo Radley saved her life and killed Bob Ewell in the fight. To expose him to publicity and a trial or enquiry would be the last thing he could stand.  She understands that her father, who never lies and who would have put Jem through a court case, is willing to let the lie go unchallenged for the sake of Boo. \n"}]}
