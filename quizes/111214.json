During a typical NBA basketball game, a skirmish broke out between Kareem Abdul-Jabaar of the Lakers and Kevin Kunnert of the Houston Rockets.  Standing near the fracas was Kareem's teammate Kermit Washington.  Kermit's life would never be the same as he turned to his side and dealt a near-fatal blow to the face of which Rocket player who was rushing to assist Kunnert in the brawl?", "correct": "Rudy Tomjanovich", "options": ["Calvin Murphy", "Moses Malone", "Robert Reid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRudy Tomjanovich.\n\n\tThe blow landed by Kermit Washington was powerfully dealt, and landed square in the center of Rudy Tomjanovich's face.  Tomjanovich was soon taken to a hospital where his very serious injuries were treated; doctors suggested that the blow was nearly fatal.  Following the incident Washington was suspended for 60 days, but played in the NBA for five more seasons. Tomjanovich eventually returned, playing three seasons, though his playing statistics declined.  He went on to greater fortune as the world champion head coach of the Houston Rockets.  Tomjanovich has since forgiven Washington on several occasions and the two have announced publically their friendship.\n"}, {"text": "June 28, 1997: In a heavyweight boxing match between the champion, Evander Holyfield and the #1 contender, Mike Tyson, things went rather awry.  Holyfield easily handled Tyson in the first two rounds of the match, causing enough frustration in the latter to provoke a bizarre and memorable set of incidents.  Angered by what he claimed were several intentional headbutts in the first two rounds, Tyson attacked Holyfield with a barrage of punches in the third round.  This barrage was followed by not one but two bites, yes bites, by Tyson.  On which part of Holyfield's anatomy did the apparently cannabalistic Tyson take a nibble?", "correct": "Ear", "options": ["Nose", "Cheek", "Neck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEar.\n\n\tMike Tyson brought the phrase 'nibbling on your ear' to a whole new level that evening as he gnawed on both Holyfield's left and right ears.  Unbelievably, after the first bite, referee Mills Lane allowed the match to continue, with Holyfield's consent!  This was after Tyson had taken a half inch chunk of Holyfield's left ear off with his razor sharp incisors. Not getting enough to eat, Tyson went for Holyfield's right ear soon after and the fight was called.  There was no report after the fight as to whether Tyson was finally given some normal human food for consumption, but it seems that Holyfield's ear was not palatable...the missing piece was later found on the boxing mat and returned to Holyfield. \n"}, {"text": "November 20, 1982:  'The Big Game' is the title of the annual meeting between the Stanford Cardinal and Cal Bears football teams.  The biggest of these games occurred in 1982, the final game of Stanford quarterback John Elway's career.  Stanford led the game 20-19 after a remarkable drive, led by Elway, that resulted in a field goal.  With four seconds left and given no chance, the Cal Bears received the ensuing kickoff and, after a blinding display of lateral passing, somehow the Bears' Kevin Moen found himself in the endzone!  The Bears won 25-20!  To make what is now called 'The Play' even more intriguing, Moen was forced to wend his way through the Stanford band which had entered the field prematurely.  Moen somehow managed to sift his way through the band but ended up plowing down a band-member who was playing which instrument?", "correct": "Trombone", "options": ["Tuba", "French horn", "Bass drum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrombone.\n\n\tWouldn't a tuba or bass drum have been fun?  Sure ... but not nearly as fun as a crushed trombone!  The infamous trombone, played by Stanford student Gary Tyrrell, ended up in the college football hall of fame.  That's one trombone that will never be allowed to make us suffer through another round of 'Louie, Louie' again ... \n"}, {"text": "August 5, 1993: The worst idea in baseball history occurred on a nationally televised game when Robin Ventura, angry at having been brushed back in what seemed to be a retaliation pitch for an earlier home run by the White Sox 3rd baseman, charged the mound.  What Ventura seemingly failed to realize was that he was heading toward a devastating pummeling by which legendary pitcher?", "correct": "Nolan Ryan", "options": ["Gaylord Perry", "Roger Clemens", "Randy Johnson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNolan Ryan.\n\n\tRobin, you charged the mound against Nolan Ryan ... are you mad?  Robin Ventura's angry confrontation with Ryan on the pitchers mound that evening ended up being one of the most embarrassing moments in baseball history.  Ryan, waiting patiently for Ventura's approach, quickly administered a one-armed headlock on the young 3rd baseman and set upon the foolish Ventura with the most amazing set of noogies ever witnessed in pro sports.  Needless to say, it was the last time Nolan Ryan was ever challenged to a fight during a ballgame! \n"}, {"text": "September 19, 1988: U.S. Olympic diver and gold medal favorite Greg Louganis injured his head in a shocking diving board accident during a preliminary medal-qualifying round at Seoul, Korea.  Did Louganis go on to win the gold medal in that springboard diving event the next day?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tLouganis struck his head against the diving board on his way into the pool during an otherwise uneventful diving meet.  The following day, after several stitches administered by James C. Puffer, chief physician for the U.S. Olympic team, Louganis remarkably went on to score a gold medal in the event!  On a side note, Louganis later revealed that he was HIV positive and knew it prior to competing in the 1988 Olympic games.  Along with Magic Johnson, Louganis has done much to help bring about awareness of the AIDS virus to the public. \n"}, {"text": "February 23, 1985: The infamous Indiana coach Bobby Knight has been involved in his share of controversy.  He's been accused of choking his players, punching a policeman in Puerto Rico and a myriad of other embarrassing acts.  Perhaps his most well-documented act of poor sportsmanship came in 1985 during a game against arch-rival Purdue.  During that game Knight tossed what item across the Indiana basketball court to 'protest' what he considered to be unfair officiating?", "correct": "Chair & A chair", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nChair & A chair.\n\n\tThis unwarranted abuse of furniture took place late in a game which Purdue won 72-63 on Indiana's home court.  The Hoosiers ended up going 19-14 that season, and 7-11 within the Big Ten Conference.  They did not make their seemingly annual trip to the NCAA Tournament that year, settling for an NIT berth.  The Hoosiers ended up being the runner-up to UCLA in the NIT, losing in a closely fought 65-62 battle.  Two seasons later they would win the NCAA Championship.  All reports suggest that the chair survived and lived a long and fruitful life at Assembly Hall. \n"}, {"text": "July 12, 1979: Did I suggest that Robin Ventura's ill-fated decision to charge the pitchers' mound was the worst idea in baseball history?  Perhaps I am mistaken.  The end of the disco age was upon us in 1979 and the owner of the Chicago White Sox, being the glorious showman that he was, decided to host a 'Disco Demolition Night' during the break between the two games of a double-header.  The demolition of thousands of disco albums and tapes soon became a riot, however, and the field at Comiskey Park was torn apart.  Who was the owner of the White Sox that was behind this stunning debacle?", "correct": "Bill Veeck", "options": ["Marge Schott", "Ed O'Malley", "Charlie O'Finley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBill Veeck.\n\n\tBill Veeck, he of the fecund mind, was always looking for a new gimmick to foist upon the fans.  He finally stepped across the line of good-reasoning in the summer of 1979 by declaring the death of disco, and allowing fans to participate in a rally of wanton destruction of disco albums ... ever read 'Lord of the Flies' Bill?  The Tigers won the first game of the double-header over the White Sox 4-1, and they garnered a victory in the second game as well ... the White Sox were forced to forfeit after the chaotic brouhaha. When the hubbub was complete, the park resembled your average rugby field following several rough days of play ... back to the drawing board! \n"}, {"text": "January 6, 1994: The ice skating world was shocked to its foundations when American Olympic figure skater and media darling Nancy Kerrigan was attacked by a thug with a pipe.  With her knee injured questions arose as to whether she would be able to compete in the Olympic games that year in Lillehammer, Norway.  Appearing to benefit from the unfortunate turn of events was Kerrigan's rival Tonya Harding, second best American figure skater that year.  Unfortunately for Tonya, the brilliant plot to advance her career was uncovered, as it was discovered that her ex-husband was the mastermind behind the nasty knee-whacking, and Tonya was implicated.  What was this ex-husband's name?", "correct": "Jeff Gillooly", "options": ["Kato Kaelin", "John Bobbit", "Shawn Eckardt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeff Gillooly.\n\n\tJeff Gillooly and Tonya Harding both eventually fessed up to having been involved in the knee-bashing nightmare that nearly nixed Kerrigan's chances of making millions as an ex-Olympic gold medalist.  Harding's career, following this baffling turn of events, has been nothing but embarrassing ... sex videos, amateur boxing events and court-ordered evictions from homes.  Needless to say, her skating career was essentially over after the scandal came to public attention ... no 'Muppets on Ice' for you Tonya! \n"}, {"text": "December 10, 1989: In a spectacle of 'wonderful' sportsmanship, fans of the Philadelphia Eagles, taking full advantage of a recent snow storm that had lain piles of fresh snow within their grasp at Veteran's Stadium, began pelting the Dallas Cowboys with snowballs.  Who was the coach of the Cowboys at that time, towards which the snowballs were primarily aimed?", "correct": "Jimmy Johnson", "options": ["Barry Switzer", "Tom Landry", "Ed Rendell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJimmy Johnson.\n\n\tFollowing the game, which the Cowboys won 20-10, Jimmy Johnson required an escort to leave the stadium.  The fans, not satisfied with simply hitting the hated rival team, also took aim at the broadcasters of the nationally televised game.  Rumor has it that Ed Rendell, future mayor of Philadelphia but then attorney, promised any fan 20 dollars if they could lob a snowball far enough to hit the Cowboys' bench.  A recommendation to the Eagles organization...a two beer limit for every fan!  Wait, that would probably cause even worse chaos, never mind! \n"}, {"text": "January 9, 2003: The Chicago Blackhawks and Phoenix Coyotes skated to an unbelievable 0-0 tie in an NHL hockey game.  Is it true or false that this was the first scoreless tie in NHL history?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSadly, this game was one of hundreds of scoreless hockey games in NHL history, with the Chicago Blackhawks suffering the 35th 0-0 game in their team history!  No offense to hockey fans out there, but how can a game have no scoring?  To me, it would be like having a plate of spaghetti with no sauce ... anyhow, to each his or her own!  Just remember, for every exciting, wonderful and exhilerating moment in sports history there's an equally dispiriting, frustrating and upsetting situation to recall ... ah, the wonderful world of sports. \n"}]}
