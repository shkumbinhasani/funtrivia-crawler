{"id": "274351", "name": "Hardest \"Sly 3\" - \"Honor Among Thieves\" (PS2) Trivia Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Sly Cooper Games", "Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves"], "questions": [{"text": "What is Dr. M's lieutenant's name?", "correct": "Gronk", "options": ["Kronk", "Bronk", "None of the above"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGronk.\n\n\tGronk is the name of Dr. M's lieutenant, who he called in the beginning of the level to finish off Carmelita.  Kronk is a character from \"The Emperor's New Groove\" and \"Kronk's New Groove\" and I made up the name Bronk. \n"}, {"text": "When Sly wasn't breathing after being crushed by the beast, how many people rushed to him to save him?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Three", "Five", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tFour of the gang members came to rescue Sly because he wasn't moving.  They were all very concerned, but only Bentley, Penelope, Dimitri, and the Guru came to save him.  Panda King and Murray did not come to save Sly. \n"}, {"text": "How many sharks was Guru to possess?", "correct": "Ten", "options": ["Twelve", "Five", "Eight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTen.\n\n\tThese sharks were meant to viciously attack the magnetic devise to retrieve Sly's cane.  The Guru is the only member of the team without metal, so he was willing to help out the gang in getting the cane back.  Dr. M booby traps the water, however, so be careful.  You need to jump with the sharks to avoid death. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Dimitri say he would dive to get the cane?", "correct": "For love", "options": ["For Sly", "None of the above", "For Reme"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFor love.\n\n\tHe was talking to Penelope and she told him to get over himself.  He didn't really listen, and he finally dove after the cane telling Penelope he would dive for her love. \n"}, {"text": "What was the color of the beams of the gun the angel fish shot out?", "correct": "Green", "options": ["Yellow", "Red", "White"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen.\n\n\tAnother beast of Dr. M's creations, the angel fish is a very powerful foe.  He begins by throwing blasting octopi that you must avoid.  He sometimes tries to suck you in, but you can escape beforehand by shooting Dr. M again, but it only works when the red ball isn't surrounding him, so you need to time it well.  He also shoots out tentacles while throwing some of the exploding octopi, so you have to dodge those AND the bombs.  Finally, he uses guns, and you have to speed-swim your way away once the small red lasers become large green beams. \n"}, {"text": "How many teeth does the angel fish have?", "correct": "Twelve", "options": ["Ten", "Sixteen", "Eight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelve.\n\n\tYou get the best view of the angel fish's teeth when you finally destroy it.  During the video, he blows up and nothing but his skeleton remains.  This includes all 12 teeth, six on top and six on bottom. \n"}, {"text": "How many turrets must you destroy while in the plane?", "correct": "Fourteen", "options": ["Twelve", "Fifteen", "Sixteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFourteen.\n\n\tThe fourteen turrets can be very tough to destroy, but once you get the hang of it, you can blast them with ease.  Never do you actually destroy the turrets.  They are only vulnerable after firing.  The red shield on the green boxes disappear, and you have a limited time to fire at that box. \n"}, {"text": "How many fighters do you destroy once you have destroyed all of the turrets?", "correct": "Twenty", "options": ["Fifteen", "Twenty-five", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwenty.\n\n\tThe fighters look like bats with pink shields on them.  You must first destroy the shields with your bomb blaster, then you shoot them down.  This level has a lot with the plane, starting with the turrets, followed by the fighters, and finally the Whale-fly.  The Whale-fly is another creature controlled by Dr. M. \n"}, {"text": "During the video of you opening the vault and going inside, how many canes are visible on the ground?", "correct": "Seven", "options": ["Eight", "Six", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven.\n\n\tThe seven canes are scattered on the ground.  There are three in one pile, three in another pile, and one that is close to one of the piles but is off by itself.  All of the canes on the ground were Dr. M's \"home-made\" canes he tried to use to open the vault himself.  You can only use a true Cooper's cane to open it, however. \n"}, {"text": "All in all, how many different beasts of Dr. M do you fight before entering the vault?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "Five", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThere are a total of three beasts, although you fight four different times.  The first time isn't even in this level, but in the \"Beginning of the End.\"  Sly fights that.  The whole game is Sly's flashback of how they got this far, but how he was about to die.  Luckily, Carmelita comes and finishes off that first beast.  The second beast is the angel fish, which Dimitri must fight while retrieving the cane.  The final beast is the Whale-fly.  You fight Dr. M three more times, but only in the Cooper Vault. \n"}]}
