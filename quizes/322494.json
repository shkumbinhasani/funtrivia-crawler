This fish is a small member of the carp family.  It includes koi, bubble-eye, and black moor varieties.  What commonly named fish is this?", "correct": "Gold & Goldfish & Gold fish", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGold & Goldfish & Gold fish.\n\n\tGoldfish are the most common types of aquarium dwellers.  Although goldfish can be a golden color, they are not always this way.  They can range in color anywhere from white to black.  Black moors are also called telescope fish, so-called for the protruding eyes.  Bubble-eyes also have protruding eyes; sacs filled with liquid!  They can pop, so you need to be careful if you have some in your tank.  Other goldfish include: comet, fantail, pompom, and veiltail. \n"}, {"text": "This \"dark\" fish can be called the river (color)fish, Alaska (color)fish, and Sacramento (color)fish.  The fish from Alaska is a dark olive-green to brown color and has a white underbelly, with dark spots all over the body.  The Sacramento (color)fish is the only fish in the genus Orthodon, and the river (color)fish is from Australia.  Can you guess what fish this might be?", "correct": "Blackfish", "options": ["Maroonfish", "Magentafish", "Yellowfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlackfish.\n\n\tThe blackfish is not always black, like the name suggests.  The Alaska blackfish, genus Dallia, as mentioned, is a brownish color with reddish brown spots on its body and fins.  The river blackfish, genus Gadopsis, can range in color from yellows and greens with dark green spots to very dark purple, or black, thus the name.  The Sacramento blackfish starts out silver in color, but gets darker as it ages. \n"}, {"text": "What colorful name can a dogfish also go by?  This can also be another name for a nurse shark.

Those in this genus are so named because of the black bands on some of the species of the genus.  However, this means nothing.  They are not blackfish!  Rather, what \"colorful\" fish are they?", "correct": "Rainbowfish", "options": ["Multi-colored fish", "Neonfish", "Colorfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRainbowfish.\n\n\tRainbowfish come in a variety of colors, with often many different colors on a single fish; thus the name \"rainbow\" fish.  There have been over 70 species of rainbowfish discovered, and it is believed that there are many more scientists have yet to find.  Some rainbowfish have bands of black on them, running lengthwise, which is why they have been given the genus name Melanotaenia (black-banded). \n"}, {"text": "The color in this fish's name was actually named AFTER the fish, based on the common pinkish color of the flesh.  Though I won't make this too easy by giving you some more widely known species of this fish, I will say that the coho and the coastal cutthroat trout are part of this fish family.  What fish, without the word \"fish\" in its name, might this be?", "correct": "Salmon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalmon.\n\n\tSalmon is from the family Salmonidae.  The most common salmon eaten in the United States is Alaskan salmon.  Commonly known salmon species are the sockeye, chum, and chinook species.  Salmon are most known for swimming upstream in rivers to spawn, dying in the process from their lack of eating.  The coho salmon is also known as the silver salmon in the United States.  Rainbow trout and steelhead trout are classified as true salmon.\r When salmon, used for food, is cut, it has a deep pinkish-orange color to it.  The word \"salmon\" was then used to describe this color. \n"}, {"text": "This fish, from the Pomatomidae family, is called tailor in Australia.  In South Africa, it is called elf, or shad.  Elsewhere, it is called chopper or anchoa.  What \"colored\" fish might this be?", "correct": "Bluefish", "options": ["Indigofish", "Cyanfish", "Skyfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBluefish.\n\n\tThe bluefish is the only species in the Pomatomidae family.  The fish is blue in color (who would have thought), with grayish blue-green fins and a white underbelly.  The fish can range from seven inches long, known as snappers, to nearly forty pounds!  The bluefish is unique because it can be found in any climate.\r Did you get my clue?  I said it was a \"title\" fish.  This should have made your color choice much easier, because only \"redfish\" and \"bluefish\" are mentioned in the quiz title.  :-) \n"}, {"text": "Known as a sig in Russia, this common fish is from the Coregonus family.  There is also a single species of this fish, in the family Stenodus, known as an inconnu.  This fish name can also be a nickname for the ghostshark.

The scientific name of the rubyfish is Plagiogeneion rubiginosum. \n"}, {"text": "This fish, from the genus Sebastes, is also known as ocean perch, Norway haddock, and red perch, though it is not a haddock; nor a perch.  It is also called redfish and hemdurgan, and is often called bergylt, bream, and snapper by mistake.  What \"flowery\" fish might this be?", "correct": "Rosefish", "options": ["Sunflowerfish", "Violetfish", "Daisyfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRosefish.\n\n\tThe rose fish, though often called a haddock or a perch, is not either of the species.  Rather, it is from the Scorpaeniformes order, along with scorpionfish, skillfish, sablefish, velvetfish, firefish, greenlings, and flatheads.  The rose fish starts out brown in color, as a baby, and matures into a bright red fish, almost ruby in color.\r What a coincidence, the rubyfish is rose in color, and the rose fish is ruby in color.  ;-) \n"}, {"text": "This type of fish, resembling a worm or an eel, is so named because of their translucent bodies; without scales, similar to that of an eel.  They live in invertebrates, such as clams and starfish, though they are not normally parasitic.

They are normally commensal, which means they do not harm the host in which they live.  Others, however, are parasitic.  The free-living species of pearlfish include the Echiodon and Snyderidia families, the commensal species include the Carapus and Onuxodon families, and the parasitic species includes the Encheliophis family. \n"}]}
