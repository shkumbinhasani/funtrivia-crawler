Quiz | NFL Players | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "NFL Players", "     NFL QBs"], "questions": [{"text": "This New York Giant and Minnesota Viking Hall of Fame quarterback took the snaps for 18 seasons.  He was great, but had his ups and downs throughout his career.  One 'down' was setting a record for throwing 32 interceptions in a season.  Who is this Hall of Fame great that liked taking snaps?", "correct": "Fran Tarkenton", "options": ["Jim Plunkett", "Roman Gabriel", "Steve DeBerg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFran Tarkenton.\n\n\tTarkenton brought the term \"scrambling quarterback\" to the NFL.  Was he scrambling to find a receiver, or just running for daylights?  At any rate, he played six seasons for the Vikings before playing for five as a Giant.  He then played seven more in Minnesota before retiring in 1978.  1978 is where he set a season record with a TD/INT ratio of 25-32 in 1978.  When he retired, he was number one in passing yardage with 47,003 yards from the air. He had since been passed by John Elway, Dan Marino, Warren Moon, Brett Favre, and others to follow.  Francis Abury Tarkenton was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986. \n"}, {"text": "The 1972 Miami Dolphins went a perfect 14-0 in the season.  Which Dolphin quarterback started the most games in the season?", "correct": "Earl Morrall", "options": ["Terry Hanratty", "Marty Domres", "Steve Young"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarl Morrall.\n\n\tThe others were never Dolphins.  Bob Griese was the team's primary quarterback at the beginning of the 1972 season, but due to injuries, back-up Morrall played in all 14 games compared to Griese's six.  Griese was there at the beginning of the season, and there at the end after his injury-comeback.  With all the greatness of Morrall in-between, the decision to go back with Griese once he was able to play, must have been a very troubling decision for coach Don Shula.  In the end, it must have been correct.  Miami won that Super Bowl 14-7 against the Redskins. \n"}, {"text": "After some pretty dismal seasons, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers who began their franchise with a 0-14 season in 1976, finally appeared in a Super Bowl after a great 2002 season.

Feeley", "Joey Harrington", "Vinny Testaverde"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrad Johnson.\n\n\tThe others were not rostered by Tampa Bay in 2002.

Landry of the Detroit Lions was sacked 55 times in 1976.  In Greg's 11 seasons as a Lion, he was sacked an amazing 261 times.  What a bruising he took in Detroit, but the Lions created a reputation for not having an offensive line who could protect the one who took their snaps.  In 1985, Lion QB Eric Hipple was sacked 49 times.  In 2006, Jon Kitna took 63 sacks in 2006, then another 51 in 2007. \n"}, {"text": "Which quarterback took enough snaps in his career to be the first to throw 5000 passes?", "correct": "Johnny Unitas", "options": ["Terry Bradshaw", "Joe Namath", "Sammy Baugh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Unitas.\n\n\tBradshaw and Namath never reached the 4000-attempt mark, and Baugh never threw 3000 passes.
