{"id": "146505", "name": "'Ben Hur', Part III Quiz | Ben Hur . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Ben Hur"], "questions": [{"text": "Ben Hur returns triumphantly to his homeland in Judaea, the newly-adopted son of a Roman consul.  Upon his return, Ben Hur is met by one of the three wise men who witnessed Christ's birth, but which?", "correct": "Balthasar & Balthazar", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalthasar & Balthazar.\n\n\tWhile Ben Hur reclines luxuriously under a desert palm, Balthasar of Alexandria approaches with a query.  Could Ben Hur be the wandering rabbi, spreading wisdom across the holy land?  Ben Hur denies being Christ, of course, but he does prove strangely interesting to the old, wise man.  Balthasar takes Ben Hur with him to meet his Arab friend Sheik Ilderim. \n"}, {"text": "We are soon introduced to the garrulous Arab friend of the wise man of Alexandria, Sheik Ilderim.  Which actor won an Academy Award for his superb portrayal of the magnanimous sheik?", "correct": "Hugh Griffith", "options": ["Stephen Boyd", "Sam Jaffe", "Finlay Currie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHugh Griffith.\n\n\tAmong all of the excellent supporting performances, Hugh Griffith's stands out for its delicious eccentricity.  Of the other actors listed, Stephen Boyd played the ultra-ambitious Messala, Currie portrayed the wizened Balthasar and Sam Jaffe the tragic steward of the House of Hur, Simonides. \n"}, {"text": "Sheik Ilderim introduces Ben Hur to his 'beauties', the four wonderful white Arabian horses that pull his chariot in the circus.  The sheik has named his horses after stars.  Which of these is NOT the name of one of his equine beauties?", "correct": "Betelguese", "options": ["Antares", "Aldebaran", "Rigel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBetelguese.\n\n\tThe four horses are named after stars.  The four horses are: Antares, Altair, Aldebaran and Rigel.  Aldebaran means 'Follower of the Pleiades' in Arabic, which makes sense since both Aldebaran and the Pleiades are contained within the constellation Taurus.  Altair is Arabic for 'the flying eagle'.  Rigel is 'the foot' in Arabic.  Interestingly, Antares is a non-Arabic star name.  The name comes from the Greek, and means, essentially 'anti-war God' (anti-Ares). \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur returns to his family home in Jerusalem.  With whom does he make first contact after he enters the courtyard of his unkept home?", "correct": "Esther", "options": ["Simonides", "Tirzah", "No one, it's vacant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEsther.\n\n\tThe beautiful Esther has remained in the family home, never having married her fiance in Antioch.  Her father Simonides has been kept in prison all the while that Ben Hur has been gone.  The elderly steward has just been released prior to Ben Hur's return home. \n"}, {"text": "What item, formerly owned by Esther, has Ben Hur kept in his possession during his entire absence from Judaea?", "correct": "Ring", "options": ["Locket", "Cameo", "Necklace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRing.\n\n\tEsther gave Ben Hur her 'slave ring' when she announced to him her intention to marry.  Ben Hur promised to wear the ring until he met the woman he would marry.  He never removed the ring, suggesting that he just might have intentions with Esther...ahem! \n"}, {"text": "Just prior to making his shocking reappearance before his old rival Messala, Ben Hur provides a magnificent gift.  What weapon does Ben Hur give to his erstwhile friend?", "correct": "A dagger", "options": ["A bow and arrow", "A crossbow", "A spear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA dagger.\n\n\tMessala originally believes that the gift is from Quintus Arrius the Younger, a man he has never met.  He is correct about the name, but indeed he has met Young Arrius, it is his old rival back from the slave galley, Ben Hur!  The shocked look on Messala's face is priceless.  Ben Hur demands that Messala find his mother and sister and return them to their family home...the plot has thickened! \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur demands the return of his mother and sister during his visit with Messala.  Miriam and Tirzah are very much alive in the dungeon of the prison, but they have contracted what horrible disease?", "correct": "Leprosy", "options": ["Typhoid", "Tuberculosis", "Plague"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeprosy.\n\n\tThe jailer and Messala's lieutenant Drusus discover that Miriam and Tirzah have contracted leprosy.  Rather than be returned to Ben Hur, they are to be banished from the city and their cell 'burned out'. \n"}, {"text": "Esther discovers that Miriam and Tirzah are alive, but not well.  She promises not to inform Ben Hur of their existence.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tEsther makes an oath not to tell Ben Hur of their condition; they are simply too ashamed of the fact that they have become lepers, and are concerned that Ben Hur will be heartbroken.  Esther instead informs Ben Hur that she has seen his mother and sister, and that they were dead.  She has sealed Messala's fate. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur has made the decision to drive the sheik's horses in the coming chariot race.  As a result, the emboldened sheik enters the Roman bathhouse in which Messala and his lieutenants luxuriate.  The sheik haggles for what odds on a wager that Ben Hur will defeat Messala's team of black horses? ", "correct": "4-to-1", "options": ["2-to-1", "10-to-1", "Even money"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4-to-1.\n\n\tWhile the other Romans are hesitant to make a bet against the revenge-minded Ben Hur, the arrogant Messala offers the sheik 4-to-1 odds.  Messala claims that 4-to-1 is 'the difference between a Roman and a Jew'.  One of his men adds insult to injury with the quip 'or an Arab'. \n"}, {"text": "What is the amount of Sheik Ilderim's wager on his own white horses, driven by Ben Hur?", "correct": "1000 talents", "options": ["500 talents", "10000 dinares", "2000 dinares"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1000 talents.\n\n\tAt first Messala is taken aback by such a massive wager (that's a lot of talent!), but he agrees to the bet.  The overconfident Roman commander is in for the challenge of his life...beginning with the next quiz!  Thank you for playing, please feel free to try the other quizzes in this set. \n"}]}
