In column 1, I put the alphabet in sequence. In Column 2, I copy over column 1. In column 3, I use the spreadsheet's random number generator (In Excel, the format would be =Rand()*100. Then, I sort columns 2 or 3 to get my code. I check to make sure that a coded letter is not the same as the real letter. If they are I switch it with another one without going through the sorting again. \n"}, {"text": "After creating the code, what should you do next?", "correct": "Think up the answers", "options": ["Take 2 aspirin and call me in the morning", "Create a new code", "Give up"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThink up the answers.\n\n\tRemember that if your cryptogram quiz has a common theme that the answers should relate to that theme. Also, if your quiz doesn't have a theme, remember that only those really proficient at cryptograms will enjoy them. \n"}, {"text": "After coming up with the answers, what should you do?", "correct": "Translate the answers using your code", "options": ["Give up", "Create a quiz you have a better understanding of", "Randomly type letters as your code"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTranslate the answers using your code.\n\n\tBe careful! It's really easy to screw this part up. I've learned this from experience. I've typed in the actual letter in place of the coded letter. This is the hardest part of creating the quiz. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following statements would best describe a good cryptogram quiz?", "correct": "The code remains the same throughout the quiz", "options": ["Words that the code was translated wrong", "A quiz with an obscure topic", "A quiz that has many errors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe code remains the same throughout the quiz.\n\n\tEven though it is possible to make a cryptogram with a different set of code for each questions, it would not be advisable to do your first one using different codes. Different codes for each line could be used for quizzes that have 5 or more words that translate to popular phrases, but I don't suggest you try this until you've mastered one code quiz since you will come up with many suprises. \n"}, {"text": "After finishing your quiz, what should you do?", "correct": "Take the quiz using your code to make sure it translates properly", "options": ["Never visit your quiz again", "Twiddle your thumbs", "Say that mistake are for others to fix"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTake the quiz using your code to make sure it translates properly.\n\n\tI suggest that you take the quiz using only the code. Try not to look at what you are typing (hard to do) and see if you get the right answers. Remember, since you created this quiz you already know the answers, so you have to try real hard and look at the code and type the corresponding letter in its place. The best thing to do would be, if possible, is to have a friend or relative take the quiz and see if they translate it correctly. \n"}]}
