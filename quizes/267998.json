While working on perfecting the serum in the Florida Everglades, he was betrayed by his lover to an evil corporation called Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.). Rather than allowing the serum to fall into their hands, Sallis injected himself with the experimetal drug and was chased into the swamp where he drowned. Later, as the serum and the swamp came together, Sallis emerged as the mindless, muck-encrusted Man-Thing, who would become, not only the swamp's protector, but the defender of all reality as we know it, as well. \r The Man-Thing made his first appearance in the pages of \"Savage Tales\" #1 in May, 1971.

Raised in horrendous conditions and submitted to tortures beyond imagining, Free escaped his adopted home-world and rejoined his biological father's fight to end Apokolips' evil.\r Mr. Miracle has had several incarnations of his book, but none have ever really caught on for any substantial length of time. \n"}, {"text": "\"Showcase\" #73 was the first appearance of which of the following heroes?", "correct": "The Creeper", "options": ["The Metal Men", "Adam Strange", "The Inferior Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Creeper.\n\n\tWhile all of these heroes made their initial appearances within the pages of DC's \"Showcase\" at one time or other, it was The Creeper who was featured in issue number 73, in 1968.\r Jack Ryder was an out-spoken talk show host who was injected with an experimental serum after being wounded trying to prevent in an attempted kidnapping of scientist, Dr. Yatz.

This was about 2-3 months after Marvel's Man-Thing came on the scene. Both characters are eerily similair in that they both were changed into swamp creatures due to experiments that had been sabotaged in some way; they both became protectors of their respective swampland homes, with Swamp Thing in Louisiana and Man-Thing in Florida; they were both mystical creatures, as Swamp Thing eventually evolved into an Elemental being and Man-thing became the center of the Nexus of All Realities. \r Although, Swamp Thing intially had the power of speech (albeit, extremely labored), he lost it after it was later explained that Alec Olsen/Holland had actually died in the explosion that created the monster and that Swamp Thing was, in fact, a plant that thought it was a man. This first series ran for 24 issues.\r Swamp Thing is probably the more popular of the two swamp creatures and his books have received, not only fan praise, but critical acclaim within the comic book community, as well, due to some of the industry's most influential writers and artists being on the book at some time or other like Berni Wrightson (whom actually created the character along with writer, Len Wein) and Alan Moore, who's run on the second series, \"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\", truly re-invented the character and took it to new heights. \n"}, {"text": "The first U.S. appearance of Captain Britain occured in \"Marvel Team-Up\" #65.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\t\"Marvel Team-Up\" should have really been called \"Spider-Man and...\" because throughout most of the series' run, which went from 1972-1985, and ended with issue number 150, Spider-Man (or the Human Torch for a few issues) would team up with a less popular character. And, with issue number 65, it was Captain Britain's turn to have the spotlight turned on to him. \r The two-part story not only introduced the Captain to American fans, but it also introduced the villain, Arcade. Also, these issues were drawn by a man named John Byrne, who would later go on to gain incredible popularity on another book entitled \"The Uncanny X-Men\". \n"}, {"text": "The futuristic hero, Deathlok the Demolisher, made his first appearance in issue number 25 of \"Marvel Spotlight\".", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn an alternate reality in the not-too-distant future, Luther Manning became  Deathlok the Demolisher, and made his first appearance in the pages of \"Astonishing Tales\" #25. \r After being severely injured in battle, Manning awakens in the body of the cyborg, Deathlok, because the military branch needed a guinea pig to test the experimental weapon.

Hailing from the planet Daxam, Mon-El was found by Superboy and so named because of the day of the week he was found (Monday) and the misunderstanding that he was Superboy's brother from Krypton ('El' is Superboy/Superman's family name).\r Exhibiting almost the exact same powers as Superboy, the two were delighted to have been 'reunited', however, when it became apparent that Mon-El's weakness was lead and not Kryptonite, as it is with the people of Krypton, Superboy placed Mon-El into the Phantom Zone until a cure could be found. It would take 1000 years before Mon-El would see the outside world again when he was released in the 30th century by the Legion of Superheroes. He joined the team and became an intergal part of that group.
