She ends up falling in love with Johnny and he asks her what her real name is. It's a happy ending, feel good type of movie and has some great dance moves. Jennifer Grey plays 'Baby' and is still acting now although you wouldn't really recognize her. I remember watching this movie over and over because Patrick Swayze was so good looking in this movie.\r Penny is Johnny's partner, Lisa is Baby's sister, and Marjorie is Baby's mother. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1985 movie \"Mask\", what famous actress plays Diana Adams, the blind girl he falls in love with?", "correct": "Laura Dern", "options": ["Ariana Richards", "Julianne Moore", "Tea Leoni"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaura Dern.\n\n\tI didn't realize it was her until someone pointed it out to me. \"Mask\" is a movie based on the true story of Roy \"Rocky\" Dennis who suffers from the disease craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, which causes disfigurement of the face and a short life span (along with possibly many other symptoms). His mom, Rusty (Cher), is a single biker chick who tries giving Rocky the same things life has to offer any one else. Her boyfriends and biker gang accept him as he is, but he's not so accepted in the real world. She fights for him to get enrolled in school and even sends him to summer camp. There he meets and falls in love with a young blind girl named Diana. This is truly an excellent must see movie.\rLaura Dern was only 18 when she did \"Mask\". She is most known for her role in the first \"Jurassic Park\" and a small recurring role in \"Jurassic Park III\".\r Ariana, Julianne, Tea were all other actresses in the \"Jurassic Park\" trilogy. \n"}, {"text": "The main child actor of the 1989 movie \"Little Monsters\" also appears in this 1987 movie in which he didn't want to hear about the kissing stuff. Which 1987 movie am I talking about?", "correct": "The Princess Bride", "options": ["The Wizard", "Vice Versa", "The Boy Who Could Fly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Princess Bride.\n\n\tFred Savage is the man child actor in \"Litte Monsters\". I am a big fan of his, especially the TV show \"The Wonder Years\". \"The Princess Bride\" is still, to this day, one of my favorite movies and I even like the book.\r \"Little Monsters\" is about a young boy, Brian (Fred Savage), who is unhappy because he's always getting blamed for things he doesn't do and he's always being picked on at school. He finds out there is a whole other world under his bed. He becomes best friends with one of the monsters and starts playing tricks on others so they get picked on and get blamed for it. He soon finds out the more time you spend there the more you start turning into one of the monsters. Fred Savage's little brother, Ben Savage, is also in this movie as his little brother.\r \"The Princess Bride\" is a fairytale with a little bit of everything. It has the love/romance, sword fights, giants, fire swamp and even ROUS (Rodents Of Unusual Size). A couple have found true love within each other but keep getting separated. This tells the tale of true love always succeeding. \n"}, {"text": "The 1989 movie \"Parenthood\" is one of my all time favorites. They filmed this movie in Florida which is not the state of the city being portrayed in the film. The opening baseball game may give it away. What city and state does the movie claim to be in?", "correct": "St Louis, Missouri", "options": ["Chicago, Illnois", "Orlando, Florida", "Atlanta, Georgia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt Louis, Missouri.\n\n\t\"Parenthood\" is about the Buckman family all trying to deal with their lives anyway they can. You'll laugh as they suffer through embarrassing skeletons in the closet, bizarre family members, raising kids and even the stress of work. There are a lot of scenes where you can clearly see Florida license plates and when Julie Buckman picks up her pictures, there's a Publix grocery store behind her which is a southern grocery store (or used to be). Since I live in Florida, it was easy to tell the difference. It was a great movie though. I definitely recommend it. \n"}, {"text": "Which heart throb actor from the 1985 brat pack movie \"St Elmo's Fire\" plays the musician of the group?", "correct": "Rob Lowe", "options": ["Emilio Estevez", "Andrew McCarthy", "Judd Nelson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRob Lowe.\n\n\tThis is an excellent brat pack movie. I am a big fan of the brat pack movies (\"Breakfast Club\", \"Sixteen Candles\", \"Pretty in Pink\"). \"St Elmo's Fire\" is about a group of college friends trying to stay friends now that they are grown up in the real world. Ally Sheedy plays Leslie who's in love with Alec (Judd Nelson) but he can't keep his hands off other women.Andrew McCarthy plays Kevin who is so in love with Leslie, everyone thinks he's gay because he won't date anyone else. Rob Lowe plays Billy Hicks who is an alcoholic, drug addicted musician (and he looks good in this movie too). He's also married to a woman and has a kid, but still acts like he's a single college kid again. Demi Moore plays Jules, the single rich chick of the bunch who finds herself not rich anymore. Mare Winningham plays Wendy, a shy goody-goody, daddy's girl who has a crush on Billy. Emilio Estevez plays Kirby, who studied to become a lawyer but now is thinking of going in the medical field just because of a woman. All the drama of them dealing with life makes this movie pretty good.  \n"}, {"text": "Which actress is the voice of Jessica Rabbit in the 1988 movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"?", "correct": "Kathleen Turner", "options": ["Betsy Brantley", "Joanna Cassidy", "Mae Questel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKathleen Turner.\n\n\tThis is a cute movie. It combines real life and animation into one world. Roger Rabbit is a toon that is accused of murdering Marvin Acme and he has no one to turn to but the toon hating detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to help him prove he has been framed. Kathleen Turner voices Jessica, Roger's wife who is suspected of playing around. She has a very sexy voice and fits the role perfectly. \n"}, {"text": "Which famous \"American Pie\" actress plays the daughter of Dan Aykroyd in the 1988 movie \"My Stepmother is an Alien\"?", "correct": "Alyson Hannigan", "options": ["Shannon Elizabeth", "Tara Reid", "Mena Suvari"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlyson Hannigan.\n\n\tThis is a cute movie and at first I didn't realize it was Alyson. I'm a big Dan Aykroyd fan and this isn't one of his best but he makes it worth watching. Dan Aykroyd plays a widowed astronomer who figures out a way to send a surge of energy into space. It ends up hitting an alien planet and they send Celeste (Kim Basinger) to Earth to save their planet by getting them to send the surge of energy again. It's a funny and quirky movie that puts a little bit of a different twist on alien life forms.\rAlyson Hannigan plays Jessie Mills the daughter who realises all is not right with her new mother.\r I hope you enjoyed my quiz. Let me know your thoughts or some of your favorite '80s movies. \n"}]}
