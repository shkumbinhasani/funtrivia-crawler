{"id": "199305", "name": "Breed-Specific Genetic Problems Quiz | Animals | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Dogs", "Dog Health"], "questions": [{"text": "The Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever suffers from a hormonal malady unknown in other breeds. What is it?", "correct": "Early-onset Addison's disease", "options": ["Late onset Cushing's disease", "Early-onset hypothyroidism", "Diabetes insipidus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarly-onset Addison's disease.\n\n\tAddison's disease, in which the adrenal glands do not work properly, is common in several breeds, but usually occurs in older dogs. In tollers, the mode of inheritance is unknown, but it is suspected to be polygenic. Tollers are the only breed in which the disease regularly appears in puppyhood, sometimes as early as 4 months. In addition, while Addison's disease in older dogs is very treatable, the disease in young tollers often does not respond well to medication and is fatal. \n"}, {"text": "Cyclic neutropenia, an immunodeficiency that leads to repeated infections and bleeding, is found only in a certain color of dog. Which one?", "correct": "Gray collies", "options": ["Red Dobermans", "White boxers", "Black Labrador retrievers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGray collies.\n\n\tThe disorder, an autosomal recessive, is often called \"gray collie syndrome\" for this reason. The disorder actually causes the color change in the coat to gray. It can be cured by a bone marrow transplant; this can actually cause the gray hairs to be replaced by normally-colored ones. \n"}, {"text": "There are many genetic eye disorders in dogs. Which of the following is found primarily in the German shorthaired pointer?", "correct": "Cone degeneration (CD2 mutation)", "options": ["Cataracts", "Progressive retinal atrophy", "Retinal dysplasia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCone degeneration (CD2 mutation).\n\n\tCone degeneration causes the cone cells in the eye to deteriorate, leading to day blindness. There is a DNA test to determine whether or not a dog carries the genes for the disease. Cone degeneration, with this particular mutation, is found in Alaskan Malamutes as well as in the pointer. \n"}, {"text": "Irish setters can suffer from a fatal immunodeficiency disease found only in this breed. What is it called?", "correct": "Canine leukocyte adhesion deficiency", "options": ["Congenital agammaglobulinemia", "Adenosine deaminase deficiency", "Severe combined immunodeficiency"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanine leukocyte adhesion deficiency.\n\n\tThis autosomal recessive disorder leads to death at an early age from overwhelming infections. There is no effective treatment. A DNA test exists to detect carriers of the disorder. \n"}, {"text": "Briards suffer from a type of blindness found only in their breed. What is it?", "correct": "Congenital stationary night blindness", "options": ["Photoreceptor dysplasia", "Glaucoma", "Progressive retinal atrophy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCongenital stationary night blindness.\n\n\tThis disorder, in which the retinal pigment epithelium of the eye degenerates, was first discovered in Briards in Sweden.

The mode of inheritance is unknown, and the treatment of choice is implantation of a pacemaker. \n"}, {"text": "Progressive retinal atrophy is perhaps the most common genetic cause of blindness in dogs. In most breeds, PRA is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In which of the following breeds is PRA inherited as a X-linked recessive?", "correct": "Siberian husky", "options": ["Portuguese water dog", "Brittany", "Irish setter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSiberian husky.\n\n\tAs the disorder is X-linked, it is usually expressed in males, as males have only 1 X chromosome. \n"}, {"text": "Irish setters suffer from a disease that is similar to celiac disease in humans. What is this disorder called?", "correct": "Gluten-sensitive enteropathy", "options": ["Histiocytic ulcerative colitis", "Pyloric stenosis", "Protein-losing enteropathy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGluten-sensitive enteropathy.\n\n\tDogs with this disorder cannot tolerate gluten; the protein found in wheat. They develop severe diarrhea and lose weight. The symptoms disappear when the dog is fed a wheat-free diet. The method of inheritance is unknown. \n"}, {"text": "As carnivores, most dogs tolerate cholesterol in their diet much better than humans do. However, one breed often has a genetic disorder that interferes with cholesterol metabolism. Which breed?", "correct": "Miniature schnauzer", "options": ["Greyhound", "German shepherd", "Boxer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiniature schnauzer.\n\n\tHyperlipoproteinemia, sometimes called hypercholesteremia, is common in the miniature schnauzer. When the dogs eat high-fat meals, they vomit and experience diarrhea and abdominal pain. The disease is treated by feeding a low-fat diet.
