{"id": "13934", "name": "English Castle Ruins Quiz | World Sites | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " World Sites", "Castles & Palaces"], "questions": [{"text": "Hastings Castle, built by William the Conqueror on the cliff above where he first landed, thrived until disaster struck in the 1300s. What happened to it?", "correct": "The southern half fell into the sea.", "options": ["The southern half was destroyed in cannon tests.", "It was leveled by a waterspout.", "One word: Godzilla!!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe southern half fell into the sea.\n\n\tYes, folks, there was an immense storm and part of the cliff gave way. So what has the city of Hastings done about this erosion problem in recent years? Why, built a resort right underneath the (new) southern end of the cliff, of course! \n"}, {"text": "The ancient hillfort between Salisbury and Stonehenge was the site both of the ancient city and the old cathedral. Now, only a few stone walls and foundations remain (well, there's an excellent view, too). What name is now used for this hillfort?", "correct": "Old Sarum", "options": ["New Sarum", "Sorviodunum", "Ye Olde Salisbury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOld Sarum.\n\n\t'New Sarum' is the site of modern-day Salisbury. Sorviodunum was the Roman settlement. The new cathedral, in Salisbury proper, is famous for its magnificent medieval spire. \n"}, {"text": "For a ruin, Portchester Castle is in pretty good shape. Sure, most of the rooms are now roofless (and in many cases wall-less), but you can still go all the way to the top of the keep and look out over what city?", "correct": "Portsmouth", "options": ["Dorchester", "Plymouth", "Liverpool"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortsmouth.\n\n\tWhy is the keep so well-preserved? Apparently, during various wars of the 18th and 19th centuries, they had to put prisoners of war SOMEplace . . . \n"}, {"text": "Here's one that may stretch the definition of 'castle', but is awe-inspiring nonetheless. First fortified some 5000 years ago and held by the Celts until finally captured by Vespasian (a future Roman emperor), this Dorset county hillfort has no walls. Instead it has earthen ramparts, carved out of the hillside to form imposing defenses. (Very impressive in an age without bulldozers!) What is the name of this fortification?", "correct": "Maiden Castle", "options": ["Old Dorset", "Dorchester Castle", "Hillside Castle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaiden Castle.\n\n\tAt first, it looks like a hill. Then, it looks like an artificial hill, but still . . . just a hill. Then you imagine yourself trying to capture it with a couple dozen others and some spears, and you grow steadily more awed. Finally you end up giving heartfelt congratulations to Vespasian. \n"}, {"text": "If you go down into the crypt of York Minster (another word for a cathedral), you will find layers of archaeological detritus neatly labeled for your perusal. Among them are Roman gravestones and pottery, as well as a still-functional Roman culvert into which you can peek and see the water flow. It turns out that the Minster was built on the old site of a Roman military headquarters -- in fact, the very fortification where what man was first proclaimed emperor?", "correct": "Constantine", "options": ["Augustus", "Claudius", "Hadrian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConstantine.\n\n\tApparently he was up north to fight the Scots when his father unexpectedly died and the son began his rise to power. They're very proud of him, up in York, or so the density of statues would seem to indicate. Constantine, for all you curious types, was the first Christian emperor of Rome and had to fight to get his title. Augustus was the first emperor, {period;} Claudius conquered Britain while {emperor;} and Hadrian built a famous wall some ways north of York, but his title was not under dispute. \n"}, {"text": "Now let's deal with a different type of 'castle ruin': the ruined castle. Warwick Castle, a Norman fortress built on a site first fortified by Alfred the Great's daughter Ethelfleda, is rather less ruined than many of the other buildings featured in this quiz. It helped that it was the seat of an important earldom! Nevertheless, in 1978 it passed out of private ownership and into the hands of what company? ", "correct": "The Tussaud Group", "options": ["The MacLaughlin Group", "Lloyd's of London", "Disney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Tussaud Group.\n\n\tYes, that's the same company that runs Madame Tussaud's waxworks in London. At Warwick Castle, they've built a large fairground, conducted extensive restoration work, and opened the gates to the public. Somewhat less tastefully, they've left little to the imagination in the castle's legendary \"Ghost Tower\" -- using a sound and light show to evoke the murder of Sir Fulke Greville. \n"}, {"text": "To depart from castles briefly: Battle Abbey was a monastery built on the site of the Battle of Hastings (1066) by William the Conqueror. When Henry VIII decided not to be Catholic anymore, he let loose his minions on the monasteries and abbeys and convents, confiscating all manner of valuables and turning Battle Abbey into a full-fledged ruin (no second floor, only the foundations of the nave, a staircase going to nowhere, etc.). But, back when it was first built, the High Altar was placed on the spot where what Saxon king was said to have been killed by William's forces?", "correct": "Harold Godwinsson", "options": ["Egbert", "Harald Hardrada", "Canute"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarold Godwinsson.\n\n\tHarald Hardrada was the Norwegian king who tried to conquer England just before William did; Hardrada was killed by Godwinsson's forces. Canute was a Viking king of England, the one famous for the showdown with the tide. And Egbert, a king of Wessex who died in 837, is the first person in Queen Elizabeth II's official family tree (unless you count Odin). \n"}, {"text": "Back to castles. Leeds Castle, 'the most beautiful castle in England', is nowhere near Leeds the city, and is generally considered to be in pretty good condition and not a ruin at all. Yet one part of it, just outside the drawbridge but still fortified, IS a ruin. This small outbuilding served what purpose, vital during a siege?", "correct": "It was a mill.", "options": ["It was an outhouse.", "It was a stable.", "It was a forge."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was a mill.\n\n\tWhen you think about it, besieged people probably want to eat, especially as they're working up an appetite by shooting arrows at the enemy and such. Hence, a mill is most useful for grinding flour for bread. Archaeological excavations a few years back found the remains of a waterwheel, which had fallen into the river. \n"}, {"text": "The Tower of London is not a ruin, nor is it likely to soon become one (it brings in too much tourist money), but in the middle of it lies a small section of ruined wall said to part of the original Roman fortification of what city, the precursor of London?", "correct": "Londinium", "options": ["Sorviodunum", "Coventry", "West Ruislip"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLondinium.\n\n\tWest Ruislip is a stop at the end of the Central Line on the Tube. Apparently it's pronounced 'RYE-slip', though I wouldn't really know, being a confused American. I do think it's a nifty name, though. Coventry is a city near Stratford, victim of a tremendous air raid during World War II. \n"}, {"text": "The moment of truth: Can I come up with one more question? This category will be the ruin of me!! (Heh, heh, heh). Well, here goes. Canterbury still has its medieval walls (well, most of them), built on the ruins of the Roman walls. It does not, however, still have most of its gates. The West Gate, best (maybe only) of the survivors, is now a museum, but it used to serve what other purpose?", "correct": "It was a prison.", "options": ["It was the local quarry.", "It was good for hanging clothesline.", "It housed a sweatshop."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was a prison.\n\n\tYep, those old walls had to scramble to find gainful employment after the invention of cannon rendered them obsolete . . . \n"}]}
