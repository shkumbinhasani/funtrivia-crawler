{"id": "223295", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Point of View' Multiple Choice Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 7 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 7"], "questions": [{"text": "'Point of View' is an entire episode filmed from the perspective of one wounded soldier, a certain Private Rich.  During the episode, do we ever hear his normal voice?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAt the very beginning of the episode, we hear Rich say 'So, take a couple giant steps, Fergie' to his pal in his normal voice.  Later in the episode, despite his damaged throat, he manages a few additional words, albeit with a low, scratchy voice.  He says, 'Don't know what to say' when asked to say something, and also says 'Thank you' and 'So long, sirs'. \n"}, {"text": "Private Rich is injured in the neck, and is immediately shuttled off by chopper to the 4077th.  Who is the first person to address Rich at the helipad?", "correct": "BJ", "options": ["Klinger", "Radar", "Colonel Potter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBJ.\n\n\tPrivate Rich encounters BJ almost immediately after landing.  BJ asks, 'How ya doin', partner?  Have a reservation?'  After this, Radar introduces himself to Rich and then reassures the young man that everything will be okay. \n"}, {"text": "Prior to Rich's surgery, Radar arrives and takes the young Private's valuables.  Radar assures Rich that there is nothing to worry about, as he will put it in a safe.  Which of these individuals is *not* mentioned as someone who knows the safe's combination?", "correct": "Klinger", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Colonel Potter", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger.\n\n\tAccording to Radar, the combination of the safe is a secret that only Colonel Potter and he share, but then he adds Margaret's name to the list along with Hawkeye, who he is sure has informed BJ. \n"}, {"text": "What is the term for the type of surgery private Rich has performed on his wounded throat/neck?", "correct": "Tracheostomy", "options": ["Laparotomy", "Keratoplasty", "Rhinoplasty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTracheostomy.\n\n\tHawkeye tells Rich that he will be getting a tracheostomy (aka a tracheotomy).  This is an incision in a person's windpipe that is supposed to relieve any obstruction to breathing. \n"}, {"text": "While Rich is resting in the post-op tent, Nurse Kelley comes by to give the lad a very innocuous sponge bath.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tRather, it is Margaret who gives the nervous Rich his sponge bath.  Margaret claims that the secret to a sponge bath is to not let the 'bath-ee' know he is getting it, and to always look the person you are bathing straight in the eye. \n"}, {"text": "In a discussion with Colonel Potter, we discover that Private Rich is from which U.S. state?", "correct": "Texas", "options": ["California", "New Jersey", "Montana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTexas.\n\n\tColonel Potter guesses that Rich is from Texas before the young man can inform him officially.  Potter knows because, as he suggests, the 'friendliest boys in the world' come from Texas.  Potter adds that Texas boys always offer their hand for an immediate handshake. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter is in a particularly miserable state during this episode, and it shows.  In a private conversation with Rich, the Colonel reveals that he is ornery because he has forgotten his recent wedding anniversary.  Which wedding anniversary was this, according to the Colonel?", "correct": "35th", "options": ["25th", "15th", "45th"], "explanation": "\n\n\n35th.\n\n\tColonel Potter forgot to call Mildred on their wedding anniversary, a first for him.  He claims that there is no excuse for his forgetting.\r Interestingly, this is the third time that the length of his marriage had been mentioned during the series, and each time the length changed.  In 'Dear Mildred', they have been married 27 years, while in 'Images', it increases to 38 years.  In reality, none of these are accurate, since the date on Rich's notebook says 'September 12th, 1951', and Colonel Potter had to have gotten married after his service in World War I (which probably was completed no earlier than 1917, and more likely 1918).  Anyhow, why niggle? \n"}, {"text": "While Hawkeye is checking on Private Rich in the post-op tent, Charles angrily storms in and confronts his Swampmate.  Why is Charles so upset?", "correct": "Hawkeye has been reading his diary", "options": ["Hawkeye has scratched his Strauss record", "Hawkeye has put oatmeal in Charles' pillow", "Hawkeye has drawn a mustache on Winchester's mother's picture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye has been reading his diary.\n\n\tNot only has Hawkeye been reading Charles's diary, he has been drawing 'dirty' pictures in the margins.  Hawkeye claims that he drew the pictures because the reading was boring and needed visual accompaniment.\r This conversation is interrupted when Rich suddenly exhibits signs of further complications, requiring the lad to undergo a second surgery. \n"}, {"text": "After undergoing a second surgery, Private Rich is ready to be shipped out of the 4077th.  In the bus, he sees a comrade who was also injured at the beginning of the episode.  What is his buddy's name?", "correct": "Ferguson", "options": ["Wilson", "Thompson", "Markson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFerguson.\n\n\tFerguson is played by actor Hank Ross, father of Shavar Ross, who played Dudley in the television show 'Diff'rent Strokes'.  In this episode, Ferguson has been injured in the leg. \n"}, {"text": "In this episode, does the viewer ever get to see Private Rich's face?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tFor the most part, the director of this episode (Charles S. Dubin) is faithful to Rich's point of view, though there are some moments, especially when Rich is loaded onto a helicopter, when the camera view couldn't possibly be Rich's.\r Incidentally, it is my theory that Rich's voice is played by actor David Stafford, who is listed in the credits merely as 'The Soldier'.  If anyone has an alternative idea, I'd love to hear it!\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
