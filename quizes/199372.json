{"id": "199372", "name": "'Life of Brian': The Lame Details Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Monty Python", "Life of Brian"], "questions": [{"text": "In the first scene we see three wise men, self proclaimed 'astrologers from the east'.  Brian's mother Mandy doesn't think much of them, however.  She labels them 'not very wise' because they have been...?  ", "correct": "Creeping around a cow shed at two o'clock in the morning", "options": ["Walking lazily through the village latrine with sandals on", "Making chimpanzee impersonations with Groucho glasses on their faces", "Inflicted with hoof in mouth disease after eating the local borscht"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreeping around a cow shed at two o'clock in the morning.\n\n\tThe exact line, 'Well, what are you doing creeping around a cow shed at two o'clock in the morning? That doesn't sound very wise to me.'  Mandy is a strange one, but she (played by Terry Jones) occasionally rifles off a bit of wit...essentially she is the same character as the old women who accompanies Dennis, the revolutionary peasant, from the 'Holy Grail'. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the three gifts brought by the wise men is Brian's mum not too fond of?  ", "correct": "Myrrh", "options": ["Gold", "Frankincense", "All three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMyrrh.\n\n\tThe key line here, 'And thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense, er, but don't worry too much about the myrrh next time.'  Myrrh is after all just a balm, which Mandy doesn't seem extremely excited about.  Actually, when told that myrrh is a balm she mistakenly believes it to be some sort of ferocious creature...like I said, strange! \n"}, {"text": "Next we see the opening credits and one of Eric Idle's wonderfully ridiculous songs, entitled 'Brian'.  According to the song, what did the 'boy' called Brian have?  ", "correct": "Arms, legs, hands and feet", "options": ["A crush on Terri Garr", "A voice deeper than Barry White", "A heavy beard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArms, legs, hands and feet.\n\n\tAccompanying the song we get to enjoy the fantastical cartoon creations of Terry Gilliam, two for the price of one!\r Here's the entire song, in all its absurdity:\r Brian. The babe they called 'Brian', \rHe grew,... grew, grew, and grew-- \rGrew up to be-- grew up to be \rA boy called 'Brian'-- \rA boy called 'Brian'. \rHe had arms... and legs... and hands... and feet, \rThis boy... whose name was 'Brian', \rAnd he grew,... grew, grew, and grew-- \rGrew up to be-- \r Yes, he grew up to be \rA teenager called 'Brian'-- \rA teenager called 'Brian', \rAnd his face became spotty. \rYes, his face became spotty, \rAnd his voice dropped down low \rAnd things started to grow \rOn young Brian and show \rHe was certainly no-- \rNo girl named 'Brian', \rNot a girl named 'Brian'. \r And he started to shave \rAnd have one off the wrist \rAnd want to see girls \rAnd go out and get pissed, \rA man called 'Brian'-- \rThis man called 'Brian'-- \rThe man they called 'Brian'-- \rThis man called 'Brian'! \n"}, {"text": "Following the credits, the audience is treated to excerpts from Jesus' 'Sermon on the Mount'.  About what time of day does this speech take place, according to the caption?", "correct": "Tea time", "options": ["Noonish", "Elevensies", "After rush hour"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTea time.\n\n\tWhile the faithful listen intently to Jesus' speech, those who are less fortunately positioned have a difficult time hearing his famed sermon.  This includes Mandy, who shouts irreverently, 'Speak up!'  Brian's mum seems rather unenthusiastic about the sermon, and asks her son to accompany her to the local stoning. \n"}, {"text": "During Jesus' peaceful speech a melee occurs between two of the spectators, one played by Michael Palin and the other by Eric Idle.  The Idle character taunts the Palin character by repeatedly referring to which of his body parts?", "correct": "Nose", "options": ["Buttocks", "Stomach", "Head"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNose.\n\n\tThe Eric Idle character, aka 'Mr. Cheeky', becomes annoyed by 'Mr. Big Nose' (Michael Palin) and his wife.  Like Brian's mother, they can't hear what Jesus is saying, mistaking the word peacemaker for cheesemaker and meek for Greek.  In the end, Mr. Big Nose punches another woman in the face and, sadly, Jesus' message is lost to this section of the crowd. \n"}, {"text": "After leaving Jesus' sermon, Brian accompanies his mother to a rather spirited stoning.  What is the name of the poor fellow who is to be the victim of this barbaric spectacle?", "correct": "Matthias", "options": ["Tim", "Rashomon", "Creosote"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatthias.\n\n\tMatthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath, to be more specific.  Poor Matthias has committed the ultimate sin of saying 'Jehovah'.  His precise quote, at dinner with his wife: 'That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah.'  A hanging offense, to be sure! \n"}, {"text": "What is rather unusual about the crowd mustered together to join in the daily stoning?", "correct": "The crowd is made up largely of women", "options": ["Most of them are without their stoning union cards", "To a person, their names all begin with the letter Z", "They are mostly amateur stone throwers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe crowd is made up largely of women.\n\n\tAnd everyone knows, women are forbidden to participate in stonings, even to this day.  \r Seriously, though, these women are looking for blood.  The local merchants seem well aware that women are illegally joining the official stonings in the village, as they sell fake beards and variously-shaped rocks (pointed ones, flat ones and bags of gravel). \n"}, {"text": "Now for a very important question: Ultimately, how many people are hit with stones during the stoning?", "correct": "3", "options": ["2", "0", "1"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tPoor Matthias is hit in the head after his 'halibut' line, but that's his only encounter with a stone during the scene.  One woman/man from the crowd (Michael Palin) and the official in charge of the stoning (John Cleese) each are stoned mercilessly for uttering the word 'Jehovah'.  Let's hope I'm not stoned for typing the word in this quiz. \n"}, {"text": "With the very satisfying stoning complete, Brian and his mum make their way through town, passing a gang of begging lepers and one ex-leper.  How was this ex-leper cured?", "correct": "Jesus cured him", "options": ["He is lying; he never had leprosy to begin with", "Penicillin", "Good, clean living"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJesus cured him.\n\n\tThe ex-leper (Michael Palin) laments his condition by responding thusly to Brian's query regarding who cured his leprosy, 'Jesus did, sir. I was hopping along, minding my own business. All of a sudden, up he comes. Cures me. One minute I'm a leper with a trade, next minute my livelihood's gone. Not so much as a by your leave. 'You're cured mate.' Bloody do-gooder.'  \r Of course, the ex-leper doesn't want to become a leper again, a simple limp will do nicely. \n"}, {"text": "Returning home, Brian and his mum encounter a Roman officer.  When Brian inquires, with his mother, about the purpose of the officer's visit, what horrible secret does she reveal?", "correct": "Brian's father was a Roman", "options": ["They can no longer afford kosher food", "She is really a man", "Brian is being sold as a gladiator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrian's father was a Roman.\n\n\tOf course, she really is a man, but is that so horrible?  In all seriousness (and I must be serious for this quiz), Brian's last name is not really Cohen.  His father was a Roman named Nortius Maximus who promised Brian's mum, among other things, slaves, asses' milk and as much gold as she could eat.  Brian rejects his heritage, claiming himself proudly to be 'kosher' and a 'Red Sea pedestrian', among other things.\r Thank you for joining me here.  You are certainly welcome back for part two of this forty-seven part series on Monty Python's 'Life of Brian'. \n"}]}
