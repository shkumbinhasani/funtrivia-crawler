During my lifetime I lived in Milan, Italy, where I painted my 'Last Supper', Florence, Italy, where my beautiful 'Mona Lisa' was created, and France, where she is now hung for millions of art lovers to enjoy.  Besides being a painter, I was also a sculptor, an architect, an engineer and a scientist...a real 'Renaissance man'!

Only one of his paintings is in the United States! \n"}, {"text": "Another mutant, ninja turtle, I also happened to be the greatest Renaissance sculptor.  The word 'Renaissance' means 'rebirth', and my philosophy was to help the figures I sculpted be 'reborn' from the large marble rocks I used to sculpt.  One of my tallest sculptures is called 'David', a famous heroic figure from the Bible.  My large, marble 'David' looks over his shoulder with confidence and strength.  In addition to sculpting, I also painted.  My most famous paintings can be found in the Sistine Chapel in Rome.

Michelangelo was also a great architect, he worked on the tomb of Julius II and the dome for St. Peter's Basilica...both in Rome. \n"}, {"text": "I was another of the great Renaissance painters and some people call me the 'masters' master'.  I was born in Urbino but moved to Florence so I could be around the other great Renaissance masters.  I soon learned the Renaissance painting style and became one of the best painters of the High Renaissance.  My greatest paintings can be found in the Palace in the Vatican, where Pope Julius II lived.  The Pope himself asked me to paint frescos (painting with pigments on plaster) on the walls there.

I was a Flemish artist working in Flanders during this time and my style is considered to be Baroque.  In my paintings, such as 'The Raising of the Cross' and 'The Garden of Love' you can see lots of movement and decoration.

Like Rubens, David's works can be seen in many museums all over the world...go check them out! \n"}, {"text": "Some people consider me to be founder of the Impressionist movement in France.  In this movement, my friends and I tried to capture a scene at a particular moment on our canvasses.  Some people thought that our paintings looked sloppy because of this, but we pushed on with our style.  Eventually it became the hip style that everyone loved!

Please go have a look at them when you take a trip to New York, Los Angeles or any other large city with a museum. \n"}, {"text": "I am another of the great French painters of the late 19th-early 20th centuries (1800s-1900s).  My style is called 'Post-Impressionist' because I went beyond the purely real looking landscapes and portraits that the Impressionists would make.  Some of my paintings begin to look almost abstract (forms that may not be recognizable, like large square blocks and blotches rather than mountains and houses).  I painted a series of landscapes that include Mont Sainte-Victoire which was near my home in France, and was probably most famous for my still-lifes (arrangements of fruit, flowers and other non-living objects).  Can you tell me what my name is?", "correct": "Paul C\u00e9zanne", "options": ["Paul Signac", "Georges Braque", "Paul Gaugin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul C\u00e9zanne.\n\n\tC\u00e9zanne is my favorite modern painter because his pictures are so placid.  Sometimes I find myself staring at them for 20 minutes straight while in a museum.  You can see so many beautiful colors and wonderful brush strokes in these paintings.  C\u00e9zanne is considered to be the father of modern art because he had such a big influence on most of the early 20th century (1900s) painters like Matisse, Picasso (see below) and Braque.  You can see C\u00e9zanne's paintings in most museums of modern art. \n"}, {"text": "I am the last but not least painter of this quiz, a modern Spanish painter with a variety of styles.  In my early career I had my 'Blue Period' and my 'Rose Period'.  You can tell my paintings from these periods because they look very blue or rose colored!  One of my most famous paintings was called 'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon', which I painted in 1907.  In this painting, the women almost look like they are made of blocks...this was the first Cubist painting.  With Cubism, George Braques and I took another step towards making purely abstract paintings.  In 1937 I painted another famous work, called 'Guernica', which protested the killing of people during the Spanish Civil War.  Some people think some of my portraits look funny because you can see people with two eyes on one side of their head, but this is part of my Cubist style and isn't meant to make you laugh, it's meant to make you think!  Who am I?", "correct": "Pablo Picasso", "options": ["Salvador Dali", "Juan Gris", "Jean Miro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPablo Picasso.\n\n\tPicasso is considered by many to be the greatest painter of the last century.  One things for sure, he was the most prolific...he did thousands of paintings, sculptures, drawings and other pieces of artwork.  He was able to do this because he lived to be 92!  Well...I hope you learned a few things here and enjoyed the quiz.  Please remember to keep these artists in mind, they are the greatest of the past 6 centuries in Europe and you will most likely see their works when you go to the big museums in various big cities.  Happy museum going to you! \n"}]}
