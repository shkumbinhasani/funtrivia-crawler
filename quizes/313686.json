He currently works at Merlotte's, on the road crew, runs a webcam site, and of course sells mind-altering drugs.  Despite this he seems to manage quite a satisfying personal life.  The man certainly doesn't lack for energy! \n"}, {"text": "Mack and Denise Rattray soon reveal that their intentions toward the new vampire in town are less than friendly; in fact they intend to drain his blood and sell it.

Once she arrives on the scene she finds Bill on the ground unable to move as a thin silver chain has been draped over his neck and wrists.  After rescuing Bill, Sookie drapes this chain around her own neck as protection from Bill biting her - only to discover that there are other places that vampires like to bite humans! \n"}, {"text": "Sadly for Bill, When Sookie learn his name, she finds it to be decidedly unexotic.  What name does she NOT suggest might have been more suited to a vampire?", "correct": "Lestat", "options": ["Antwon", "Langford", "Basil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLestat.\n\n\tSookie laughs when Bill tells her his name, remarking \"Bill?

She then places both hands on his head, which makes her telepathic talent stronger, but she is still unable to \"hear\" Bill's thoughts.

After insulting both a customer and her boss, she walks out on her job at Super Save a Bunch.  Incidentally, if you find economics interesting, the book Tara was reading in this scene, \"The Shock Doctrine\" makes for some compelling reading.
