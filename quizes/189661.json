In this film, the lead character, Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), is unjustly incarcerated for the murder of his wife and her lover.  While in prison, Andy maintains his humanity by involving himself in all but which of these activities?", "correct": "The assembling of a Bible study group", "options": ["The fashioning of a chess set from various types of rock", "The development of a prison library", "The improvement of other people's lives through personal favors and other activities"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe assembling of a Bible study group.\n\n\tAndy Dufresne is an accountant who has been inadvertently framed for the killing of his wife.  To deal with the inredible hardships that he encounters in Shawshank Prison, Andy pursues a number of interesting endeavors, including the creation of a prison library, the fashioning of a rock-chess set and the uplifting of his fellow prisoner's lives through various means (e.g. he helps one young man graduate from high school; he acquires beer for his fellow inmates by doing some accounting work; he plays classical music over the prison intercom system).  Andy's philosophy while in Shawshank revolves around the concept of hope, and he spreads his values of optimism and humanism amongst his fellow inmates. \n"}, {"text": "Another of the great films involving the immurement of innocent individuals is Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece 'Schindler's List'.  Much of this film takes place in a Nazi concentration camp near Krak\u00f3w, Poland.  What is the name of this camp in which the 'Schindler Jews' dwelt for much of the World War II period?", "correct": "Plaszow", "options": ["Belzec", "Dachau", "Lwow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlaszow.\n\n\tPlaszow was not far from Krak\u00f3w, Poland, from whence came most of the Jewish people who were ultimately included in the list of personnel working at Oskar Schindler's metalworking plant.  \r Aside from the directing talent of Spielberg, the film also included magnificent performances by Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley.  The intensity of the Nazi barbarism during World War II is betrayed in this film, as is the continued sense of humanity among the prisoners in the concentration camp, even during times when the suffering was magnified. \n"}, {"text": "This prison film features an enormously powerful performance by George Kennedy, who portrays the character Dragline.  The title character puts in a very memorable egg-eating performance to boot.  Which of these films fits this description?", "correct": "Cool Hand Luke", "options": ["Captain Dreyfus", "The Spanish Prisoner", "Papillon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCool Hand Luke.\n\n\tCool Hand Luke is a film that features one-man's struggle to maintain his dignity, despite the degradation and brutality of his prison surroundings.  Paul Newman does a superb job of portraying the very likeable Luke, who befriends the prison heavy Dragline even despite the initial tension between the two men.  \r If you haven't seen this 1967 film, I highly recommend it.  In particular, watch for the one-man egg-eating contest about halfway into the film.  It exemplifies the defiant nature of the main character Luke. \n"}, {"text": "Back to World War II we go, and this time to a German POW camp called 'Stalag 17'.  Which actor plays the lead role of Sergeant J. J. Sefton in this classic film from 1953?", "correct": "William Holden", "options": ["Humphrey Bogart", "Alan Ladd", "Marlon Brando"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Holden.\n\n\tDirected by Billy Wilder, 'Stalag 17' stands as one of the classic films featuring the lives of POWs.  Playing the role of Sefton, a wheeling and dealing and skeptical American prisoner, was William Holden, who won a Best Actor Oscar for this gritty performance.  Holden's Academy Award acceptance speech was a classic.  It consisted of two words, 'Thank you.' \n"}, {"text": "This 1985 film, directed by Hector Babenco, featured a fascinating story of two men from different walks of life.  William Hurt portrays Luis Molina, a homosexual, while Raul Julia plays Valentin Arregui, a political prisoner.  What is the name of this film?", "correct": "Kiss of the Spider Woman", "options": ["La Endemoniada", "Chained Heat", "The Great Redeemer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKiss of the Spider Woman.\n\n\tThis film features the unusual relationship between two men who are confined in a dingy Latin American prison for different reasons, Molina (Hurt) for 'immorality' and Arregui (Julia) for being a political dissident.  The director Babenco fashions a wonderful story within a story, as the Molina character uses his dreamlike fantasies to escape from the horrible reality of his situation.  Manuel Puig wrote the novel upon which this film was based. \n"}, {"text": "The 1992 film 'American Me' told the tale of prison life from the particular perspective of the Chicano-American.  The film also marked the directorial debut of what excellent actor known for his roles in both the small and big screen mediums?", "correct": "Edward James Olmos", "options": ["Paul Rodriguez", "Hector Elizando", "Esai Morales"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdward James Olmos.\n\n\tThough not entirely set in the prison world, a great deal of the film was based on life in the California state prison system.  Aside from the subtle but sometimes explosive acting of Olmos, the film also featured a surprising performance by William Forsythe.  This epic film is as emotionally disturbing as it is captivating, so beware! \n"}, {"text": "Few prison films have been more jarring and disturbing in their imagery than the 1978 movie 'Midnight Express', which won a Best Screenplay Oscar for Oliver Stone.  In which country was this exceptionally disconcerting film based?", "correct": "Turkey", "options": ["Indonesia", "Saudi Arabia", "Pakistan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurkey.\n\n\tDirected by Alan Parker, 'Midnight Express' tells the tale of Billy Hayes, a young American who gets himself involved in the drug trade in the wrong place, at the wrong time.  After being thrown into a Turkish prison, Hayes (played by Brad Davis) struggles to keep his sanity while attempting to find a way out.  Look for interesting performances by John Hurt and Randy Quaid, and an utterly frightening turn as the prison boss Hamidou by Paul Smith. \n"}, {"text": "In 1979 the film-going public was treated to the fascinating story of Frank Morris in the movie 'Escape from Alcatraz'.  Which of these veteran actors portrayed the hardened Morris, who manages through a very elaborate plan to escape 'The Rock' with two other inmates?", "correct": "Clint Eastwood", "options": ["Robert Redford", "Tom Selleck", "Burt Reynolds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClint Eastwood.\n\n\tStolid, brooding and very convincing, Eastwood does an excellent job of acquiring the sympathy of the film-going audience while still maintaining his hardened edge.  Along with Morris escape two brothers, Clarence and John Anglin, played respectively by Jack Thibeau and Fred Ward.  Patrick McGoohan plays the ruthless prison warden in this film, and does a superb job of it.  Just what makes a prisoner fall over the edge, driving him to recklessness?  This film may provide some answers. \n"}, {"text": "This prison film of 2000 featured the able direction of veteran character actor Steve Buscemi, and included some flamboyant performances by actors Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Tom Arnold and Danny Trejo.  What was this movie titled?", "correct": "Animal Factory", "options": ["Silent Men", "Prison Riot", "Takedown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnimal Factory.\n\n\tIf you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it.  'Animal Factory' is the story of a young inmate named Ron Decker, played by Ed Furlong, who becomes quickly and deeply immersed in the prison milieu.  Along the way, he is taken under the wing of Earl Copen (Dafoe) who directs Decker on how to survive.  The film was based on the novel by Edward Bunker, an actor who appears in the film, and who experienced life first-hand in the California state penitentiary system.  (Also appearing in this film is actor Danny Trejo, who likewise spent a number of years in prison.) \n"}, {"text": "The 1996 film 'Sleepers' tells the story of four young boys who are locked up in a brutally-run detention center.  Which of the following actors was not part of the all-star cast in this film?", "correct": "Bill Murray", "options": ["Dustin Hoffman", "Robert De Niro", "Brad Pitt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBill Murray.\n\n\tAlong with performances by De Niro, Hoffman and Pitt, 'Sleepers' also features the acting of Kevin Bacon, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Jason Patric and Bruno Kirby.  Directed by Barry Levinson, this film is a rather powerful look at the cruel treatment that can, and occasionally does, occur in juvenile detention facilities.  Especially keep your eye out for Kevin Bacon, whose portrayal of the strikingly brutal prison guard Sean Nokes is devastating.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will sample some of my other quizzes online at this website. \n"}]}
