{"id": "260857", "name": "Spider-Man 3 | 10 Question Movie Multiple Choice Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Spider-Man", "Spider-Man 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) appears in a Broadway show early in the film.  What is it called?", "correct": "Manhattan Melodies", "options": ["An Ode to Manhattan", "Merry Melodies", "Melodies and More"], "explanation": "\n\n\nManhattan Melodies.\n\n\tPeter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is extremely supportive of his girlfriend's acting endeavors, but after some negative reviews, MJ gets fired from the production...a fact that she is hesitant to share with Peter. \n"}, {"text": "With whom is Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) romantically involved when we first meet him in the film? ", "correct": "Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard)", "options": ["Betty Brant (Elizabeth Banks)", "None of these", "Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard).\n\n\tGwen is Eddie's girlfriend...until she becomes infatuated with Spider-Man.  Eddie winds up with both personal and professional reasons to hate both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, which fuels his eventual transformation into the super-villain known in the comics (but not, interestingly enough, the movie) as Venom. \n"}, {"text": "As he did in the first two \"Spider-Man\" films, actor Bruce Campbell makes a cameo in \"Spider-Man 3\".  What is the profession of the man he portrays?", "correct": "maitre d'", "options": ["police officer", "reporter", "musician"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmaitre d'.\n\n\tCampbell plays the maitre d' at the restaurant where Peter plans to propose to Mary Jane.\r He played the announcer at a wrestling arena in \"Spider-Man\", and a ticket-taker at a theater in \"Spider-Man 2\".  Seems as though Bruce is moving up in the world! \n"}, {"text": "Flint \"Sandman\" Marko (Thomas Haden Church) has a daughter who is very ill.  What is her first name?", "correct": "Penny", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPenny.\n\n\tUnlike the villains of the previous films, Marko does not seem to be an evil or insane man.  He committed crimes in order to pay for his daughter's apparently expensive medical treatments.  Spider-Man even lets Marko go at the end of the movie, rather than turning him over to the authorities! \n"}, {"text": "What does Gwen Stacy do for a living?", "correct": "model", "options": ["police officer", "teaching assistant", "reporter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmodel.\n\n\tGwen is the daughter of Captain George Stacy (James Cromwell), but she is not a police officer herself.  She is a classmate of Peter Parker, but at no time do we see her doing any teaching.\r Just prior to her meeting Spider-Man, we see Gwen participating in a photo shoot with two other women.  This is consistent with the Gwen Stacy of the comics; she was also a professional model. \n"}, {"text": "Harry Osborn (James Franco) takes a cue from the comic books and calls himself \"Hobgoblin\".", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe word \"Hobgoblin\" is never spoken in the film.  In the comics, a successor to the Green Goblin identity did indeed call himself that, but Harry never called himself anything, really.  He simply recreated his father's experiment (giving himself superhuman strength, agility, and healing abilities in the process) and used his father's equipment to continue Norman Osborn's war against Spider-Man. \n"}, {"text": "While Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is under the influence of the \"black suit\", he takes Gwen Stacy on a date.  To what kind of club does he take her?", "correct": "jazz", "options": ["blues", "disco", "heavy metal"], "explanation": "\n\n\njazz.\n\n\tPeter takes Gwen to the jazz club where Mary Jane is working (as a \"waitress/singer\"), presumably to rub MJ's nose in the fact that he is seeing other women.  He even performs a flamboyant dance number, just to stick it to Mary Jane.\r Once Gwen figures out what Peter is up to, though, she feels terrible, and apologizes to MJ.  It's an awkward moment, but it shows that Gwen has character. \n"}, {"text": "J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) is frustrated that neither of his star photographers seems to be around to take pictures of the huge battle at the end of the film.  (They are, of course, both PARTICIPATING in said battle, but J.J. doesn't know it!)  He asks a little girl for her camera, so he can take pictures himself.  The girl agrees to loan J.J. her camera, but only for a certain amount of money.  How much?", "correct": "$100", "options": ["$50", "$150", "$200"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$100.\n\n\tJonah reluctantly forks over the money, only to learn that the camera has no film in it.  \"Film costs extra\", the girl tells him.  \r Jameson is mostly used for comic relief in the \"Spider-Man\" films, and that's just fine with me.  This is a funny scene! \n"}, {"text": "In the first \"Spider-Man\" film, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) was killed when sharp protrusions on the front of his own flying vehicle stabbed him.  True or False:  Harry Osborn dies in the same manner in \"Spider-Man 3\".", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tHarry, despite his having tried to kill Peter Parker early in the film, responds to Peter's request for help and fights by his side against Sandman and Venom.  He sacrifices himself to save Peter when Venom hurls Harry's \"goblin glider\" at a helpless Spider-Man.  The glider's blades pierce Harry's chest.  He dies (from exsanguination, presumably) just a few minutes later.\r Does that count as irony, given how Norman died? \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following statements is true about Peter and Mary Jane's relationship by the end of the film?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["They are engaged.", "They are married.", "They are through with each other forever."], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tThe film ends with Peter interrupting the song that Mary Jane is singing (a bit rude, that) and holding her close, almost slow dancing.  There is no further mention of the engagement ring, but it seems that the couple are at the very least back to where they were at the beginning of the film:  romantically involved best friends with hopes for a future together. \n"}]}
