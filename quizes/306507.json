Joanna is never retrieved from the water.\rFurther on in the episode, Jack's stress and fatigue catch up with him and he begins seeing visions of his dead father in the forests around the island.  Joanna's death was one of the catalysts in this.\rJoanna briefly resurfaces in the episode \"Born to Run\" in which Kate uses her passport photo to try and claim a new identity.

Upon this discovery, Ethan retreats into the jungle, taking a pregnant Claire and Charlie with him.  While Charlie is saved by Jack and Kate after he's hanged from a tree, Claire disappears for a while before appearing of her own accord (though she's now suffering from a bout of amnesia).  As it turns out, Ethan had taken her to a DHARMA Station known as The Staff during this time with the plan to take her unborn child.  Luckily, she's saved by Rousseau's daughter, Alex.\rJack and the others plan to trick Ethan using Claire as bait in the episode, \"Homecoming\", and luckily, they get the upper hand and catch him.  Before they can interrogate him as one of 'The Others' though, Charlie shoots him multiple times, killing him for what he did to Claire.\rAs it turns out, Ethan had been born on the island.  Living with Ben Linus and the Others on an adjacent island, he had been sent to the middle-section's crash site to make 'a list'.\rIn the fifth season episode, \"LaFleur\", it is discovered that Juliet actually delivered Ethan.

After Boone finds a leader in Locke, the two discover the presence of the DHARMA Station hatch in the jungle and together they dig it out.  Though the two eventually stop returning to camp with fresh boar, they manage to keep it a secret for long enough.  Boone's demons on the island tend to stem from his family issues.\rEventually, Locke is 'told by the island' to search at a specific location and he starts to lose the ability to walk (something he regained upon coming to the island).  He and Boone find the plane lodged in the trees upon a cliff and Boone, being able-bodied, climbs to investigate.  Although he finds very little of value in the plane (for the time being), he tries to use the radio and to his surprise, he gets a signal (although he doesn't discover that it's actually survivors from the tail-end of the same Oceanic flight).  His choice in doing this ends up sealing his fate as the plane comes crashing to the ground.  Locke is forced to carry him back to camp so that Jack can save his life and he soon retreats to the hatch in anger.\rIn the episode \"Do No Harm\", Jack is unable to save Boone when a number of problems arise during surgery.
