{"id": "370249", "name": "Going to the Movies and the Mall Online Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun", "Thematic Story Time"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Before we go get our seats, I'm dying for something to eat.  Like, OMG, literally.  I totally need refreshments.  The problem is, I'm like, too picky, y'know?\"\n\nI won't eat any candies that are blue.  Which one of these can I eat?", "correct": "Skittles", "options": ["M&Ms", "Jelly Bellies", "Smarties"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkittles.\n\n\tOriginal Skittles come in red, orange, yellow, green, and brown, meaning that blue is not included (unless you get a less common variation).  On the other hand, the chocolatey answers provided, M&Ms and Smarties, include blue candy-coating on a fair portion of their products (M&Ms can be red, yellow, blue, brown, green, and orange while Smarties contain even more).  Jelly Bellies come in a much larger mixed selection, so it's not absurd to find a blue one in the mix; some of their blue flavours include Berry Blue and Blueberry. \n"}, {"text": "\"OMG!  The movie hasn't even started yet; these trailers are taking so long and I just don't know how much more I can sit through, right?  I mean, that last trailer was just another remake of the same old comic book movies that came out a couple years ago!\"\n\nWhich superhero, who had a trilogy of films starring Tobey Maguire (and directed by Sam Raimi), ended up getting his series remade only a decade after being released in 2002?", "correct": "Spider-Man", "options": ["The Hulk", "X-Men", "Iron Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpider-Man.\n\n\tThe 2002 \"Spider-Man\", directed by Sam Raimi, was exceedingly popular.  Starring Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson, and Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, it made over $800,000,000 in the box office, spurring a trend in high-profile, blockbuster comic adaptations, mostly in the Marvel line.  After the trilogy earned over two and a half billion in box office revenue, \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" was released in 2012 starring Andrew Garfield in the title role.\r Similarly, while a \"Hulk\" movie was made in 2003 by Ang Lee (starring Eric Bana), Marvel released a remake more in line with their outlook for \"The Avengers\" in 2008, only five years later, starring Edward Norton.  It was called \"The Incredible Hulk\".  Doesn't take much. \n"}, {"text": "\"Shhhh!  It's starting!  I totally love movies.  OMG!  I can't wait to see this one; I've been waiting ages to see it.  I heard the main character is actually dead the entire time!\"\n\nIn which movie is that a possibility?", "correct": "The Sixth Sense", "options": ["Signs", "Inception", "World War Z"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sixth Sense.\n\n\tSpoilers!  Released in 1999, \"The Sixth Sense\" was lauded for its twist ending, one which characterized director M. Night Shyamalan as the master of the twist ending, a trope he would continue to use in later movies like \"Signs\", \"Unbreakable\", and \"The Village\".  While many panned his later films, \"The Sixth Sense\" got him nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards. The movie starred Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, the former as a psychologist and the latter as a young boy with the ability to 'see dead people'.  The movie, of course, ended with the twist that Willis' character was dead the whole time, and only Osment's character could see him. \n"}, {"text": "\"It's intermission and oh emm gee!  I need to go use the restroom.  I'd totally use the one here in the theatre but it's out of order.  Instead, I have to walk all the way to the mezzanine.  I literally can't even.\"\n\nWhich of these likely describes the mezzanine?", "correct": "It's the floor slightly above this one, overlooking the main lobby", "options": ["It's the parking garage under the mall", "It's the revolving restaurant thirty floors up", "It's the projection room above the theatre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's the floor slightly above this one, overlooking the main lobby.\n\n\tIt's a bit odd to refer to a mezzanine directly as a floor, mainly because it's position often puts it between two floors.  Accessible from both the floor above and below, usually by stairs, the mezzanine is more of a balcony than anything.  In a theatre proper, the mezzanine would be the second tier of seating found above the main floor (and perhaps under further balconies); in the mall it would be the level slightly above the current or main floor.  The word comes from the Italian word for 'middle', referring to its placement. \n"}, {"text": "\"Just made it in time for the second movie-- awesome timing, am I right?  OMG!  The lights are turning down.  This time I'm ready to be scared.\"\n\nWhich of these horror movies claimed to be based on true events?", "correct": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", "options": ["Friday the 13th", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Halloween"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\n\n\tAllegedly based on the murders committed by Ed Gein, \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" was released in 1974 and directed by Tobe Hooper.  The movie was a hit, resulting in a number of sequels and remakes over the coming decades.  The original followed a group of teenagers passing through Texas and stumbling across a family of cannibalistic psychopaths. The unrelenting, gruesome violence ended up making it a horror staple and it was considered one of the earliest 'low-budget horror' successes.  Horror 'based on true events' has always shown great popularity, especially at the turn of the century when handicam-made horrors like \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"The Blair Witch Project\" became some of the most popular independent releases ever to show in the box office and mockumentary releases dabbled into the genre. \n"}, {"text": "\"It's time to get up and stretch and do some shopping! (OMG!) You know what that means... Time for a coffee!  Let's go to Starbucks!\nNo, not that Starbucks... or that Starbucks... the other Starbucks!\"\n\nI order an venti caramel macchiato-- can't have enough caffeine!  Is there any coffee in a macchiato?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tSure enough-- coffee indeed!  While a large percentage of the caramel macchiato (or most macchiatos for that matter) is actually steamed milk (making it a latte), there's also a shot of espresso added in there.  Just enough to give you a bit more pep.\r Starbucks started in Seattle, Washington in 1971 and has since become one of the most famous international cafes.  Known for cropping up on every street corner in the world (just kidding, but seriously),  its twenty thousand plus locations serve everything from coffees to energy drinks to pastries to music albums and more.  It's a trendy spot...but if you're just looking for 'a coffee' they'll look at you funny...and so will the other patrons. \n"}, {"text": "\"OH!  EM!  GEE!  I just luv shopping soooo much.  Do you think this looks good on me?  The problem is, I have, like, three of these already.  What about some accessories?  I can never have too many accessories!  Swag!\"\n\nWhich of these is an article of clothing or an accessory?", "correct": "Pillbox", "options": ["Antimacassar", "Captcha", "Carafe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPillbox.\n\n\tThe pillbox, while it seems like it would store pills, is actually a hat.  While it's most commonly seen on military personnel, it has ben used over the years as a fashionable accessory, though rarely with a hip crowd.\r An antimacassar is a doily or cloth that's draped over a chair to protect the furniture from dirt while a carafe is also used in the home...as a pitcher for drinks like wine or juice.  Captcha is an application used by websites to determine whether or not a user is a human or a computer.  When inputting a password, for instance, you would complete a Captcha (usually a word or string of letters) to verify your identity as... not a spammer. \n"}, {"text": "\"OMG!  Today's so fun; I heart being at the mall with you.  We should totally take a selfie!\"\n\nWhat would I use to take a selfie?", "correct": "Cell phone", "options": ["Toilet paper", "Unpurchased items", "Ice cream"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCell phone.\n\n\tSelfies refer to the use of a camera or cameraphone to take a picture of oneself, usually for immediate (or later) upload to a social media site like Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook.  Obviously a product of the 'me generation', selfie-ing became a trend more and more as cell phones started improving their digital cameras and data usage; uploading files within seconds became the norm in the 2010s.\r The word 'Selfie' became ingrained in popular culture shortly thereafter and, actually, spawned a novelty single by The Chainsmokers known by (sigh...) \"#Selfie\".  The hashtag is another trend popularized by Twitter.  The less we discuss it, the sooner it may go away. \n"}, {"text": "\"Let's get some shoes!  OMG!  These shoes are only $300.  Let's get 'em!\"\n\nUnfortunately, the cashier won't take my currency.  Which of these can't be used in physical form?", "correct": "Bitcoins", "options": ["Discover Card", "Cheque", "Euros"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBitcoins.\n\n\tCreated in 2008, Bitcoins are an online form of currency which, in a way, have emerged as a legitimate form of payment for certain online outlets.  In many countries you can purchase or exchange real, physical money using Bitcoins, making them fully usable.  On the same note, however, many international agencies have been called to action to stop illegal activities, many of which have used Bitcoins in some way because of their lack of centralized origins. Although some countries have outright banned the use of Bitcoins, others have recognized its use and have gone out of their way to regulate it.  But you won't find it in your wallet; those shoes will need to be paid for in cash, debit, or credit. \n"}, {"text": "\"I'm not in the mood for dinner, but OMG, I could totally go for an ice cream.  Ice cream is, like, totally the best.\"\n\nIf you order the Ben and Jerry's flavour Cherry Garcia, you're selecting a flavour inspired by the lead singer of what rock band?", "correct": "The Grateful Dead", "options": ["Lynyrd Skynyrd", "AC/DC", "Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Grateful Dead.\n\n\tJerry Garcia was the front-man for The Grateful Dead since their hippie roots in the mid-1960s and he led the band until his death thirty years later.  Despite Garcia's long-running and dangerous drug habits, his influence on the rock and roll canon was insurmountable and he became memorialized in everything from TV shows to Beanie Babies to-- of course-- Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia ice cream which contains cherries and fudge.  The ice cream, however, came out eight years before his death.  A certain irony can be taken from the fact that Garcia was a diabetic. \n"}]}
