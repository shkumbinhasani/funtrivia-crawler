{"id": "245580", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - '5 o'clock Charlie' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "As the episode opens, Radar is taking bets as to the distance 5 o'clock Charlie, an errant enemy bomber, will miss his target today.  Father Mulcahy is among those who take up the challenge, betting that the distance will be 40 yards.  Does Father Mulcahy claim his money will go to the orphanage?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn fact, there has been no mention of Father Mulcahy's beloved orphanage at this point in the series.  Rather, Father Mulcahy intends to donate his winnings to the 'Bible Fund'. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Trapper seem to revel in the daily visits from 5 o'clock Charlie, so much so that they don sporting outfits and speak in British accents.  What is Radar's response when he hears their poor attempts to mock the English?", "correct": "Do you guys have a cold?", "options": ["You guys don't really sound French.", "Wow, is that how they really speak in New England?", "You two sound just like the Marx Brothers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDo you guys have a cold?.\n\n\tAnnounced over the intercom: 'And now, direct from North Korea, here he is for his sixth week, 5 o'clock Charlie, his airplane and his astigmatism!'  Jolly good show for Hawkeye and Trapper...rather! \n"}, {"text": "Come to think of it, it seems rather odd that 5 o'clock Charlie would even be trying to bomb the 4077th.  What exactly is his target in the vicinity?", "correct": "An ammo dump", "options": ["The supply depot", "An abandoned tank", "The mine field"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn ammo dump.\n\n\tAn ammo dump next to a surgical hospital, a good place to hide ammo, or so it would seem.\r Incidentally, when Frank complains to Henry about the danger of 5 o'clock Charlie, Henry responds: 'Charlie is like one of our own.  I mean how else would we know it's 5 o'clock if he didn't come over and try to blast that ammo dump?' \n"}, {"text": "Frank asserts that 5 o'clock Charlie presents a serious threat to the M*A*S*H 4077th.  He insists that Henry contact General Clayton about acquiring a gun.  Frank makes a reference to a certain Billy Mitchell, an American Colonel who advocated for a strong military.  What actor played Mitchell, according to Frank?", "correct": "Gary Cooper", "options": ["Clark Gable", "Cary Grant", "Spencer Tracy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGary Cooper.\n\n\tOddly enough, the movie Frank makes reference to, namely 'The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell', starring Gary Cooper, didn't arrive in theaters until 1955, several years after the Korean War was over.  No matter, though, point taken! \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the 4077th wins the pool of almost 100 dollars with a distance of 75.5 yards?", "correct": "Henry", "options": ["Klinger", "Margaret", "Nurse Baker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry.\n\n\tHenry is notified of his win just as Frank is barking at him to acquire a gun.  Henry is ecstatic about winning, but at the same time annoyed by Frank.  Something has to give! \n"}, {"text": "General Clayton participates in the 5 o'clock Charlie betting pool.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAs a matter of fact, General Clayton comes to the 4077th himself to witness 5 o'clock Charlie at work, and to see if a gun (or 'nug', as Henry calls it) is absolutely necessary.  He will come to regret this decision! \n"}, {"text": "What prompts General Clayton to finally agree to send the 4077th a gun to defend itself against 5 o'clock Charlie?", "correct": "Charlie bombs General Clayton's jeep", "options": ["Charlie hits the latrine while the General is inside", "Charlie destroys the mess tent", "Charlie makes an obscene gesture towards General Clayton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlie bombs General Clayton's jeep.\n\n\tAfter Charlie hits the General's jeep, he turns to Henry and says, 'Henry, you've got your gun.'\r Oddly enough if you watch the scene where the jeep explodes you will notice that it is already mangled before it catches fire. \n"}, {"text": "Inside the Swamp, Trapper and Hawkeye contemplate how to deal with Frank and his new gun.  They consider him a bigger menace than Charlie!  What is the name of the guitar-playing dentist who sits in the Swamp with them?", "correct": "Cardozo", "options": ["Pittman", "Satranini", "Devon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCardozo.\n\n\tThis episode marks the only appearance of Captain Phil Cardozo, apparently a visiting dentist.  Cardozo makes the intelligent observation that Hawkeye and Trapper should forget about Frank and get rid of the ammo dump.\r Cardozo is played by actor Corey Fischer, who also appeared in the movie 'MASH' as Capt. Dennis Patrick Bandini. \n"}, {"text": "As part of their plan to undermine Frank, Hawkeye and Trapper try to con him into thinking it's really only 4:30 while in the post-op ward.  What problem does one of the patients have, according to Hawkeye, requiring Frank's special abilities?", "correct": "Abscess", "options": ["Enteritis", "Lockjaw", "Ingrown toenail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbscess.\n\n\tHawkeye claims that 'post-operative infections' are Frank's specialty, and he adds, 'When we think of pus, we think of you.'  Unfortunately, the ruse only works for so long, Frank hears 5 o'clock Charlie approaching and charges outside towards his gun! \n"}, {"text": "Is Frank able to shoot down 5 o'clock Charlie during the episode?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tGood lord, no, that was a freebie for you!  Frank couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, but he does inadvertently make quick work of the ammo dump.  He orders the crew manning the gun to fire, despite the fact that the gun is aimed directly at the ammo dump.  The entire thing goes up in flames and Charlie gets away Scot-free.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
