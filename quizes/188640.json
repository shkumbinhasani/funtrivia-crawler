{"id": "188640", "name": "Electricity - A Quiz for Bright Sparks  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Science for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "We can produce electricity from many sources, the burning of fossil fuels (coal or oil) for example.\nWhat source supplies the energy to produce solar power?", "correct": "Sun", "options": ["Waves", "Wind", "Nuclear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSun.\n\n\tSolar energy from the sun can be collected by photoelectric cells; these convert the sun's light into direct current (DC) electricity. \n"}, {"text": "A substance that allow an electric current to flow is called a conductor.\nWhich of these substances WILL conduct electricity?", "correct": "Tap water", "options": ["Wood", "Glass", "Paper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTap water.\n\n\tTap water is a very good conductor of electricity because it allows the completion of an electrical circuit. (Pure water will not conduct electricity)\r*Because tap water is such a good conductor you must NEVER use a hair dryer, electric fire or mains powered device near a bath of water. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these household devices would you NOT normally expect to find an electric motor?", "correct": "Television", "options": ["Personal computer (PC)", "Hair dryer", "Hi-fi system"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelevision.\n\n\tHi-fi systems can have several electric motors to drive the CD player, cassette deck, record turntable or mini-disc player. \rPersonal computers have motors to run the hard disc drive, CD and floppy disc drives, they also have an electric motor to drive the cooling fan. A hairdryer has an electric motor to drive the fan. \r*Some large screen televisions may have cooling fans powered by an electric motor. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these statements is TRUE about most electrical devices?", "correct": "They produce heat", "options": ["They produce movement", "They create light", "They create sound"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey produce heat.\n\n\tElectrical consumption produces heat at the same time as it produces light, movement (electric motors) or sound (hi-fi). \rHeat is also produced in the grid system carrying electricity from the power station to your house because of the electrical resistance (measured in ohms) in the transmission cables. \n"}, {"text": "Of these household appliances, which will normally use the greatest electrical current for each hour of operation?", "correct": "Electric kettle", "options": ["Personal computer (PC)", "Television", "Hi-fi system"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElectric kettle.\n\n\tAn electric kettle consumes around two-thousand watts of power (UK). It is very wasteful to boil more water than you need! \rThe amount of power consumed by an electric kettle in just one-minute will power a sixty-watt light bulb for more than half-an-hour. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these events is also known as an electrical storm?", "correct": "Thunder and lightning", "options": ["A monsoon", "A hurricane", "An earthquake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThunder and lightning.\n\n\tLightning happens when clouds become negatively charged in relation to the earth. This potential difference can be one billion volts. \rA lightning flash lasts about a quarter of a second and can reach temperatures of thirty-thousand degrees Celsius, fifty-four-thousand degrees Fahrenheit. \rThunder is caused by the rapid expansion and contraction of the air around the lightning - it travels faster than the speed of sound causing a sonic boom. \rAs light travels faster than sound you see the lightning before hearing the thunder. \rYou can calculate the approximate distance of the storm by checking the time difference between the lighting and the thunder - each five seconds equals around one mile. \rIn the midst of a storm you should shelter in a building, if that is not possible a car will give you protection. \rIt is NOT a good idea to shelter under a tree as they are often struck by lightning! \n"}, {"text": "Most household electrical appliances are protected with a fuse. \nWhat units are used to rate household fuses?", "correct": "Amps", "options": ["Watts", "Volts", "Hertz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmps.\n\n\tFuses blow when too much current is drawn through them. This breaks the electrical circuit.\rIt is important to replace a blown fuse with one of the correct rating, as advised by the manufacturer of the appliance.\rUsing the wrong fuse rating could damage the appliance, or worse cause a fire! \n"}, {"text": "What units are used to measure amount of power consumed by a light bulb?", "correct": "Watts", "options": ["Volts", "Ohms", "Lumens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWatts.\n\n\tThe unit of power known as the watt is named after the Scottish engineer and inventor James Watt.\r*The watt, an International System unit of power, is equal to one joule per second. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these statements is TRUE about standard battery flashlight (torch)?", "correct": "It is normally powered by DC electricity", "options": ["It is normally powered by AC electricity", "Both of these", "Neither of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is normally powered by DC electricity.\n\n\tMost flashlights (torches) are powered by a number of one-and-a-half volt dry cell batteries that supply DC (Direct Current) electricity. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is a TRUE statement about electricity?\nYou can-", "correct": "Feel electricity", "options": ["Smell electricity", "Taste electricity", "Hear electricity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFeel electricity.\n\n\tAn electric shock is not only unpleasant it can also be very dangerous. \rThis is why you must NEVER open the cover of any mains powered electrical equipment - leave it to a qualified technician. \n"}]}
