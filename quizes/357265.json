{"id": "357265", "name": "The Scorch Trials Quiz | Authors | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors D-G", " James  Dashner"], "questions": [{"text": "When the boys search for Teresa at the outset of their second trial, who do they find in her room?", "correct": "Aris", "options": ["Gally", "Frypan", "Chuck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAris.\n\n\tArriving at a safehouse after the events of \"The Maze Runner\", the boys of the Glade are locked into their bedroom while Teresa is whisked off to her own.  In the night, Thomas inexplicably loses his telepathic connection with her and a Crank at their window wakes them up, screaming that he wishes to be killed. Although the boys find that the door is in fact locked, they break out to find the bodies of their captors dead in the next room.  Thomas immediately rushes to check on Teresa but, instead of finding her sealed away, they find another boy named Aris who claims to be from another maze populated by girls instead of boys. He claims to be their trigger, like Teresa was for them, and Thomas is able to speak with him in his mind.  After an alarm sounds, the boys find that the bodies in the other room have disappeared without their noticing. \n"}, {"text": "All of the boys are infected with 'The Flare' as part of their trial.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThings start to change quickly.  Teresa forcefully blocks Thomas out of her mind and as the days pass, the boys don't receive any food.  Finally, after a few days of waiting, the boys are given a small amount of food to sustain themselves.  They're also greeted by a man sitting at a desk, hiding behind an invisible shield.\r Inevitably, the man talks and claims that phase two of their trials has begun.  The boys are being tested with different situations (variables) to analyze their capabilities and determine if they are, in fact, able to save humanity.  With the world in chaos and solar flares causing a disease known as 'The Flare', the situation is dire.  They also confirm that they are being tested by WICKED, also known as 'World in Catastrophe, Killzone Experiment Department'.\r They are told that they have a five minute window during which to depart at six the following morning.  They must head one hundred miles north to a safehouse, otherwise they will succumb to 'The Flare', the condition with which they've already been infected.  They have two weeks to get there.\r The next morning, they choose Minho to lead the way as he has been marked with a tattoo reading 'The Leader'.  Thomas is unnerved by his, which reads that he must be killed. \n"}, {"text": "Which boy is attacked by the gooey metal before the Gladers emerge into the Scorch?", "correct": "Winston", "options": ["Jack", "Newt", "Thomas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinston.\n\n\tEmerging through the Flat Trans and into a pitch-black hallway, the boys hear whispers in the dark urging them to turn around or face their doom.  They plod onward anyways, bravely facing their mission.  They get a hard dose of reality soon after -- two of the boys die when their heads are mysteriously replaced with large metal spheres.  After climbing some stairs several hours later, Minho opens a hatch to reveal the outside world, too hot and too bright to withstand.  Fortunately, they run out of choices when a large drop of metal falls from the ceiling onto Winston's head, threatening to envelop his skull as happened to the other boys.  Thomas, thinking fast, is able to remove it, but not before causing damage.\r When the boys leave the tunnel, swathed in blankets to protect them from the sun of the Scorch, they find that to head north they must pass through a city and then through a black mountain range.  On their way to the city, two runners approach them and warn them about a second group sent to kill them before departing.  As darkness falls, Thomas spots a structure in the distance and a woman with long hair standing outside.  He decides to check it alone. \n"}, {"text": "In the Scorch, the Gladers encounter a dangerous storm.  Which element of the weather is most threatening to them?", "correct": "Lightning", "options": ["Thunder", "Hail", "Wind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLightning.\n\n\tWhen Thomas enters the structure, he's shocked to see Teresa there.  She warns Thomas away and tells him to be wary of the challenges ahead.  There will be traps set for him and he will need to be cautious.  After a kiss, his memories for her seem to rush back and he flees what certainly seems to be a dangerous trap without telling the others.  They run as fast as possible to the city, but not before spending a night.\r On their way to the city, an old man warns the boys of a storm soon to strike the area.  Before long, the clouds rush in and the Gladers are left to run and dodge dangerous lightning strikes.  Some, like Winston and Jack, are killed by this variable.  Despite Minho being set on fire by a lightning strike, eleven boys make it into a safe building on the edge of the city; they're hungry but alive.\r That's when a boy by the name of Jorge descends from the roof and claims to be a Crank. \n"}, {"text": "Jorge agrees to protect the Gladers and help them cross the city, but only if he can bring who else along?", "correct": "Brenda", "options": ["David", "Aris", "Barkley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrenda.\n\n\tActing as a leader, Minho tries to fight Jorge but instead ends up putting the Gladers into a predicament.  Jorge reveals his own forces, all Cranks, all ready to strike.  Thomas offers to talk to him alone instead and they quickly come to a private agreement after Jorge is told the truth.  They decide to gather food and go provided Jorge can bring Brenda, another Crank, along for the ride.  Jorge tells the others that they'll meet at a nearby tower in an hour.\r On their way to a food vault, Brenda tells Thomas about what happened.  The solar flares started before the world could react, and soon the world was scorched from Tropic to Tropic, creating an arid wasteland between the two poles.  This also sparked an epidemic, later called 'The Flare', which was unleashed from a lab.\r While everyone enjoys the food, an abrupt explosion separates Brenda and Thomas from the others; the other Cranks set the explosive devices, and let them off when they feared that a scheme was being plotted.  Brenda decides that they have no choice by to go through the Underneath, a series of underground passages spanning the city.  Thomas has to promise to take her to the end, though.  When they get through the passages to the center of town, they find that a man is following them...and then there are more. \n"}, {"text": "According to Brenda, the scorched city is situated in what used to be which former location?", "correct": "Mexico", "options": ["Brazil", "California", "Colorado"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMexico.\n\n\tWhen the man and the other Cranks pursue them, attempting to take their noses, Thomas and Brenda have no choice but to flee into the depths of the Underneath.  They hide in a compartment under a table, but are inevitably found by the first Crank who was looking for their noses.  They brawl and get the upper hand, and Brenda yells for Thomas to stab the Crank in the heart.  Fighting for his life, he does so.  They decide to go top-side after this, back into the heat, because Thomas has faced too much death underground in the past few days.\r Back above ground, the two of them sleep in a truck cab and Brenda tells a bit more about the city.  It turns out that they're in what was formerly Mexico.  WICKED was created after the remaining countries (after the solar flares) were unified to find a solution to The Flare and the other issues arising from the disaster.\r After Thomas experiences a concerning dream about his past with Teresa, he awakens and steps across the street to read a placard on a statue.  He's shocked to find that it says \"Thomas, you're the real leader.\"  Brenda informs him that they're all around the city, and it's one of the reasons Jorge wanted to protect him. \n"}, {"text": "While leaving the city, Thomas is taken in by WICKED officials for emergency medical work after what happens?", "correct": "He gets shot", "options": ["He gets electrocuted", "He steps on a rusty nail", "He gets stabbed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe gets shot.\n\n\tWhile Thomas and Brenda gaze at the statue, three Cranks arrive, one with a gun, and force them to join in their 'party'.  At gunpoint, they start dancing without realizing it; they're also forced to down some drugged drinks and, after Thomas tells Brenda that \"she can't be her\", he blacks out.  He wakes up a few hours later, tied up for an interrogation, and he figures he has to tell the Cranks the truth.\r Before long, although it looks grim, Thomas and Brenda are saved by Minho and the Gladers who ambush the party-goers and send them on their way.  As they leave, however, Thomas gets shot by the one Crank with a gun.  Minho beats him down and they flee the city, but Thomas passes out due to the pain.  Fading in and out of consciousness, Thomas is eventually picked up by a berg; WICKED patches him up.\r During his medical exam, Thomas overhears a conversation between his doctors who assert that none of what's happening will affect the patterns they've been seeing thus far (even though a gun wasn't supposed to be in the Variables).  Further, there are only four or five 'candidates' left in the running.  Soon enough, he's dropped back off in the Scorch outside a small hut.\r With five days left to reach the Safe Haven, Thomas tells about what happened and the Gladers sleep until the sun sets.  Then begins their trek through the mountains.  In his mind, Thomas hears Teresa warning him that something bad will happen to him, but he must remain trusting. \n"}, {"text": "Harriet is the leader of which of the following?", "correct": "The girls of Maze B", "options": ["WICKED", "The Cranks", "The Grievers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe girls of Maze B.\n\n\tAs the Gladers continue towards the mountains, they're stopped by none other than Teresa who, with twenty other girls, all from the second maze, decide to take Thomas with them, tying him up in a large bag and dragging him up the mountain.  She warns the boys that they plan to kill him as that was what they were told to do.  Thomas fears that she actually is 'The Betrayer' she was labelled as back at the dormitory.\r When they return him to their camp, the girls reveal that WICKED said that they needed to kill him or else they would not make it to the Safe Haven.  When Teresa leaves the group on a scouting mission, however, they speak to him and realize that their deeper-rooted beliefs may be true.  They don't need to kill him.  The girls' leader, Harriet, speaks to Teresa and convinces her that Thomas doesn't need to die, but Teresa decides to go it alone.\r With only two days left, Thomas and the girls start walking through the mountains.  Finding a narrow path down a steep cliff, they begin to descend but Thomas, now at the back of the pack, is beckoned into a thicket by Teresa.  He decides to follow her. \n"}, {"text": "When everyone arrives at the Safe Haven, what does it turn out to be?", "correct": "A banner on a stick", "options": ["A hospital facility", "An airport runway", "A lighthouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA banner on a stick.\n\n\tWhen Thomas follows Teresa into the thicket, she reveals that she and Aris are actually together; he emerges from behind Thomas and holds a knife to his back.  Noting that they're best friends, they kiss and cause Thomas to become jealous in an instant.  Leading him to a nearby cave, the two of them try to force Thomas into a small chamber but, of course, he tries to make an escape.  Forcing Aris to think about Rachel, his partner in Maze B, he nearly makes a break but he's stopped at the last minute by a blow to the head from Teresa.  He passes out in the machine as a sacrifice after being gassed.\r While unconscious, Thomas has a dream of the four of them -- himself, Teresa, Rachel, and Aris -- all planning to head off into the maze.\r When Thomas comes to, the door opens.  Aris and Teresa apologize since they only worked under WICKED's orders to ensure his safety.  Thomas doesn't think things can be the same between himself and Teresa, even though they shared such a bond.  This has to wait though; they only have five and a half hours left and everyone else is already en route to the Safe Haven.  They run, and on the way, Teresa explains that not only did WICKED take her from her dormitory on the first night out of the maze, but she could talk to Aris while in her coma in the Glade.\r When the trio reaches the point where the two groups converge, they're pleased to hear that everyone is on the same side.  Further, they've made it to the Safe Haven.  The only problem: the Safe Haven is simply a banner on a stick.  Something must be afoot.  With a storm brewing and less than an hour left, the groups are surprised when the ground starts shifting to reveal Griever pods.  Slowly, they start to open. \n"}, {"text": "When everyone escapes on the berg at the end of the story, who does Thomas say can be killed?", "correct": "Brenda", "options": ["Gally", "Teresa", "Aris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrenda.\n\n\tWhat crawls out of the Griever pods is frightening -- fleshy creatures with bulbs attached to their bodies.  Soon, everyone wields their weapons and, as a lightning storm commences, they begin their battle against the abominations.  Although the fight goes well once they realize the creatures' weak spots, the lightning becomes too dangerous and the warriors discover that their only safe bet is to jump into the pods to protect themselves.  As the time counts down, they hold tight.\r Soon, the timer counts down to zero and a berg descends.  Everyone releases themselves from their pods and races to the craft before it can depart.  Luckily, most make it aboard.  One of the people on the craft, however, is shocked that two non-Gladers, Jorge and Brenda, are aboard.  They are not allowed to join.  Thomas refuses to leave them.  When Thomas is given a choice, he says to kill Brenda, but this is a ploy to let down the WICKED associate's guard.  He pins the man, who says his name is David, and is told that there will be no more trials or games; everyone just needs to listen.\r The survivors are brought inside for showers, food, and beds.  When Thomas falls asleep he has a frightening dream; Brenda talks to him telepathically and warns him that things will get worse.\r Thomas wakes up in a cold sweat and discovers that he's been placed into a white, sterile room.  Speaking to Teresa telepathically, she says he's been gone for a week.  Everyone else was told that he was being treated for a deeper-rooted Flare infection.  He realizes that they're being lied to.  As he falls back to sleep, Teresa tells him that \"WICKED is good.\" \n"}]}
