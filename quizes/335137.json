{"id": "335137", "name": "\"Jersey Shore\" - Season 2 Quiz | Jersey Shore | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television H-K", "Jersey Shore"], "questions": [{"text": "During their stay in Miami, the shoremates stayed at which hotel suites?", "correct": "Metropole", "options": ["Coconut Grove", "Colony Hotel", "Embassy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMetropole.\n\n\tWith cold weather hitting the East Coast, the housemates from the \"Jersey Shore\" decided to migrate south for the winter.  Destination: Miami.\rWhile the Situation and Pauly D road tripped through West Virginia (picking up fireworks along the way), Snooki and JWoww drove down the same way, stopping in Savannah, Georgia for fried pickles.  The next day, everyone arrived at their new suites in the Metropole on Miami Beach.  Mike and Pauly arrived first and set up their room shortly before (surprise, surprise) Angelina showed up and decided to bunk with them.  Sammi showed up next and scouted out a room with three beds for herself and the girls while anticipating Ronnie's arrival (they broke up after the previous season) and Vinny showed as well to take the final room for himself and Ron.  He was followed by Ron and the girls.\rSettling into their new lodgings for the night, the housemates tried the new jacuzzi and unpacked.  Jenni accidentally broke a large shelf, knocking Ronron Juice all over Sammi's clothes, and Angelina tried to have a good time with the boys.\rHeading to the Ocean's Ten, a Miami club, everyone hopped into cabs and the girls started to fight with Angelina en route to their destination (though Angelina kind of started it).  Ronnie and Sammi fought at the club over their relationship and it escalated on the way home.  Instead of going back with the girls, Ronnie and Vinny went to a club called B.E.D. with the others to drink and dance.  Here, as Vinny put it, he \"released all his demons\", something that would haunt him for the rest of the season.  He decided to hop into bed with Sammi too, despite her still loving him. \n"}, {"text": "Where did the shoremates work while in Miami?", "correct": "Gelato shop", "options": ["Tanning salon", "T-shirt shop", "Gym"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGelato shop.\n\n\tIn the proceeding days, the gang settled into their suite at the Metropole.  Sammi and Ronnie argued about trivialities, Angelina spent the majority of her time on the phone, Snooki ruined dinner, and the girls headed to the sex shop for new outfits.  The girls decided to talk with Angelina about her insults (while the guys watched on) while JWoww and Snooki heard the news about Ronnie from the guys.  Meanwhile, Ron and Sam decided to work through their problems to be together.\rEverybody met their new boss at the gelato shop and learned how to perform their jobs and find out their shifts.  Ron took Sam along to a tattoo parlour to join him when he got inked and later that night the guys introduced 't-shirt time'.  At the club, Angelina drank a bit too much and smacked Pauly in the face later in the night.  This escalated to a much larger confrontation which got Pauly (of all people) to yell a fair bit.  This ended unresolved.  To fix things, Angelina made the attempt to make amends with the girls of the house and they accepted her apology.\rMeanwhile, Ron caused more waves with Sam and Snooki spent the night with Vinny.  The guys had an MVP (Mike, Vinny, Pauly) night at B.E.D. and hooked up with some grenades. \n"}, {"text": "To clear the air, Snooki and JWoww wrote an anonymous letter directed at which individual in the house?", "correct": "Sammi", "options": ["Angelina", "Ronnie", "Mike ('The Situation')"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSammi.\n\n\tThe girls had a night to themselves at home and Snooki broke up with boyfriend who drunkenly explained that he cheated on her.  Sam's suspicions about Ron intensified, but the two remained quite close...even when people explicitly mentioned Ron's bad habits.  Over dinner, Snooki, JWoww, and Angelina talked about writing an anonymous note to Sammi explaining everything Ronnie did at B.E.D. and Klutch and Nicole and Jenni ended up going to a computer cafe to do the deed.  When the girls wrote up the letter, Angelina tried to get out of it but to no avail.\rWhile Sam and Ron decided that they had major problems with one another, both realized that they were happier with each other than without and decided to stick it out. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the boyfriend who cheated on Snooki when she went to Miami?", "correct": "Emilio", "options": ["Dave", "Roger", "Jimmy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmilio.\n\n\tOn one night, MVP invited some girls back to the house and didn't expect a second set of girls to show up.  Mike ended up plotting and narrowing the field to three girls (by splitting some up in Ronnie's room) and the night was a success despite their degrading plan.  The next day, the housemates agreed on a plan for the day; Angelina was asked to clean the kitchen specifically.  This, of course, never happened- instead she said she couldn't care less and spent hours on the phone.  This caused a fight, but it was resolved soon after (no thanks to Angelina, though).  After dinner, the girls (led by Sammi) decided to spearhead dinner the next week.\rNicole and Jenni headed out for a walk and Snooki let out her emotions (which were bottled up after the break-up with Emilio).  She decided that she would move on, be single, and have fun.  This included a photo-burning ritual.\rJenni and Nicole ended up placing 'the note' into Sammi's nightstand that night and it wasn't long before it was read.  Ron went ballistic searching for the culprit(s) and Sammi resigned to acknowledging Ron's issues.  No one admitted to writing the letter.  As soon as Ron got the go-ahead to break up, he decided to call some girls from his phone book to get revenge.  Sigh. \n"}, {"text": "In episode 6, \"Should We Just Break Up?\", which two housemates got into a late night fight with each other because of the note?", "correct": "Sammi and Jenni", "options": ["Snooki and Angelina", "Ronnie and Snooki", "Jenni and Ronnie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSammi and Jenni.\n\n\tSnooki spent another night in Vinny's bed and had a tell-all session with Sam before heading to the beach with the other girls.  Again, there was a moment where Angelina was told to never mention who wrote the note.  Sam confided in Mike for the truth and he confirmed that the note wasn't really a lie.  More big fights abound!\rVinny, worried about getting pinkeye again, headed to the eye doctor for an appointment for eye pain (though it turned out it was just dry eyes).  Meanwhile, Mike showed his true colours with a girl he brought home.  The girls decided to follow through on their dinner venture although Sam decided not to help out.  Despite the guys holding low expectations for the dinner, the girls pulled it off.\rAngelina let it slip to Sam that Snooki and Jenni wrote the note while working with Sam.  After a night on the town (with Mike's sister included) a rumour started as a result of Angelina's lies.  This led to a full-blown fight between Jenni and Sammi in which the authors of the note were revealed. \n"}, {"text": "In episode 7, Angelina started dating a man named Jose.  What particular expensive accessory did he buy for her?", "correct": "Fossil watch", "options": ["Pearl necklace", "Diamond earrings", "Engagement ring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFossil watch.\n\n\tAfter a fairly extensive fight in the house, tensions remained at a high between Snooki/Jenni and Sammi while Angelina remained on the outside with everyone.  The next day, Jenni effectively avoided work to avoid Ron and Sam while Pauly and Vinny hit up Miami Beach.\rLater in the day, while at work, Angelina continued her growing relationship with Jose.  It turned out that he bought her a white Fossil watch (very expensive); she decided to keep teasing him despite all of the others liking him and the general consensus that he was getting played.\rBefore heading out to the club one night, Angelina and Vinny got into a fight at the house about her causing trouble.  Coincidentally, the two of them slept with each other after going to the club- an action that Angelina wouldn't live down, especially since she was leading Jose on. \n"}, {"text": "Episode 8, \"All in the Family\", was the start of Vinny's Miami relationship with what girl?", "correct": "Ramona", "options": ["Gina", "Rocio", "Danielle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRamona.\n\n\tVinny got a call from his mother about a visit to Miami.  That afternoon, a lot of different family members showed up (including his Uncle Nino, a man described by everyone as an 'Original Guido').  Of course, the whole thing culminated in a giant meal prepared by Vinny's mom and a hot tub fight between Snooki and Angelina.  After this evening, Vinny's family ended up heading out.  Later that night, Angelina ended up hooking up with someone Snooki had already slept with, fueling the fires even more.\rEveryone took a day at the beach and went back out to the clubs.  Here, Angelina told Jose that she'd hooked up with Vinny as a result of Mike's instigation (but didn't get into details).  At Tantra, Vinny found a girl he genuinely liked, Ramona.  Similarly, Pauly met a girl named Rocio.  Both decided to invite their girls out on dates (and buy flowers...and get haircuts...and buy new clothes).  When Vinny got home though, he received a call from Ramona canceling the date.\rAngelina, Jose, Ron, and Sam headed to dinner together for Jose's birthday and Jose confided in Ron about Angelina's fidelity problem.  The next day, Angelina admitted to not liking Jose (to the cameras) and sleeping with Jose (to the roommates, which was a lie).\rJenni's boyfriend, Tom, came down for the night to visit and he found a number in her phonebook that he didn't like.  This caused a bit of tension between the two of them but they enjoyed their night nonetheless.  Angelina's friend, Gina, came down as well.  A phone conversation between Angelina and her mother ended up being an emotional one because of her homesickness.  She and Gina spent a day at the beach while Pauly and Vinny had their own afternoon in the water.\rTo prepare with a night with his new girl, Mike ended up cleaning most of the house.  When he decided to leave the rest for Angelina so that she could pull her weight, she retaliated and inevitably ended up hitting him. \n"}, {"text": "A fallout in the tenth episode of the season, \"Gone, Baby, Gone\", resulted in the departure of which member of the household?", "correct": "Angelina", "options": ["Ronnie", "Sammi", "Snooki"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAngelina.\n\n\tAfter fighting with Mike, a lot of unresolved issues still lingered between Angelina and most of the house.  Jenni was the one to come forth to talk to her stating that she earned her spot in the family, but Angelina was torn between staying and going.  The issues worsened that night when Angelina stayed in Mike's bed with Jose (while Mike used the guest room with his girl) without asking.\rThe next day, Mike continued to dig at Angelina for never asking about the bed, but no apologies were given.  When asked if she would go to the club with everyone, Angelina decided to call everyone out for being fake instead.  Soon after, rumours began to circulate that she would be leaving though everyone seemed okay with the idea.\rAfter coming back from the club, everyone returned to the house to find Angelina's bags waiting outside.  Rather than simply leave, she decided that she'd need to get a final word in.  When she saw Snooki come back with one of her past guys, Alex, she decided to get more personal.  After calling everyone fake again, Snooki decided to finish with her and the two fought in the living room.  Soon though, Angelina took her stuff and left, shouting insults on her way out.  No one was sad to see her leave. \n"}, {"text": "In episodes 11 and 12, Snooki's best friend from back home flew to Miami for a visit.  What was the name of this friend?", "correct": "Ryder", "options": ["Lisa", "Melissa", "Julie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRyder.\n\n\tAs a cleansing ritual, Pauly and Mike moved Angelina's bed out of their room first thing in the morning.  In celebration, the house prepared lobsters for a family dinner.  Snooki and JWoww tried to keep one as a pet but placed it in freshwater and ended up killing it.  After dinner, Snooki spoke with Sam about the note to make amends and JWoww joined in on the conversation (though things were still tense between her and Sam.  While apologies were made, whether or not they were accepted is up for interpretation.\rVinny finally got his date with Ramona and they hit it off.  Surprisingly she didn't brush him off again.  Snooki's girlfriend, Ryder, ended up coming down for a visit and there was a lot of drinking, before, during, and after.  At the club that night, Mike and Snooki had a fight when he tried to carry her out of the club.  The next night was more of the same; Mike tried to steal Ramona from Vinny, then tried to convince everyone to go home, a choice that didn't go over well with most people (least of all Snooki, who he tried to kiss, but ended up smacking).  Mike did apologize the next day, though.\rRyder headed home the next day and Snooki cried because she was homesick.  She contemplated heading home early, but decided against it.  Jenni tried to get their mind off missing home, so they decided to spend the night at Space, a big New York-style club that the girls had anticipated visiting for a while.  Unfortunately, some of the housemates decided to start arguing with other partiers and they got kicked out.  Mike and Pauly headed home with some girls, but Mike screwed that up and acted poorly as a wingman.\rThe next day, Pauly, Vinny, Ramona, and Rocio spent time at the beach with each other while Ron and Sam joined in.  During dinner preparations the fire alarm went off and the fire trucks showed up (much to the girls' delight; the firemen were good-looking).  The next day, Mike got the car towed AND acted as a poor wingman for Pauly again. \n"}, {"text": "In the season finale, the gang played a game of 'Most Likely to...'.  Who admitted to being the 'Most Likely to Get Skin Cancer'?", "correct": "Pauly", "options": ["Vinny", "Snooki", "Jenni"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPauly.\n\n\tIn their final days in Miami, the housemates all took a tour of the Everglades, rode out to see some crocodiles, and ate some frog legs.  Pauly had his final date with Rocio, Vinny had his last dinner with Ramona, and Ron and Sam had their parting meal as well (and questioned the future of their relationship).  This resulted in a fight before everyone went out for their final Miami club night.\rOn the penultimate day, Jenni cleaned up the kitchen and Snooki volunteered to help make dinner.  When Sam decided she didn't want to help, Mike decided to instigate an issue.  He did more of the same during the final meal.\rEveryone gathered to have a game of 'Most Likely to...' and more drama ensued.  After one comment made by Jenni (about Mike), Snooki ended up telling a story about Pauly D calling JWoww fake and it escalated shortly thereafter.  With Snooki in tears and the night supposedly ruined, everyone apologized and spent the night enjoying themselves as a family.\rIn the morning, everyone toasted Miami over breakfast and packed their belongings.  As the taxis started arriving, everyone started leaving the suite they called home for the past two months.  After Ron, Sam, and Vinny headed to the airport, Mike and Pauly and Jenni and Snooki began the long drive home. \n"}]}
