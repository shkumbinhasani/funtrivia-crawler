{"id": "382857", "name": "\"Preacher\" - Season 1: \"Finish the Song\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "Preacher"], "questions": [{"text": "This episode opened with an extended shot of an American flag flying over an old western town. The scene was a flashback to hundreds of years ago, how many stars were on the flag?", "correct": "38", "options": ["52", "5", "13"], "explanation": "\n\n\n38.\n\n\tFlashing back to the old west like the show has done many times, viewers got another glimpse at the \"old man\" who heretofore hadn't been named. \r To answer the question I didn't expect others to pause the show and count the flag, but 38 is the only viable option. There was never an American flag with 5 stars, and 13 stars would have been easy to spot. 52 isn't anywhere near correct as even in present day when the show aired there were only 50 stars on the flag. The stars correlate to the number of states in the U.S. \n"}, {"text": "Who was left alive in the flashback scene to the old west bar?", "correct": "The old man", "options": ["The preacher", "The bartender", "A child"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe old man.\n\n\tThe old man was asked if he loved Jesus Christ, at which point he shot the preacher in the bar.
