{"id": "356553", "name": "\"America's Next Top Model\" - Cycle 10 Trivia Game | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television A-C", "America's Next Top Model"], "questions": [{"text": "For the first time in several cycles, how many models were sent to New York City to compete?", "correct": "Fourteen", "options": ["Thirteen", "Ten", "Sixteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFourteen.\n\n\tA group of girls started this cycle heading by to Los Angeles and attending the two Jays' Top Model Prep School.  After interviews, the girls were pared down to fourteen, and headed to a loft in New York City; this was the first time since Cycle 4 that more than thirteen girls were chosen.  After an impromptu runway show in the middle of Times Square, the girls had a photo shoot posing as high fashion homeless women and met with the judging panel (including new judge, Paulina Porizkova).  Here, Kimberly quit the competition before her photo was judged, citing a lack of interest in fashion, and the judges still sent home Atalya, leaving only twelve girls. This was the third time in the show's history that a girl quit the competition. \n"}, {"text": "For the first time in the show's history, what happened during the girls' makeovers in week two?", "correct": "They were not told what their makeovers would be", "options": ["They were allowed to do their own makeovers", "They were allowed to pick between two makeovers", "They were allowed to choose other contestants' makeovers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey were not told what their makeovers would be.\n\n\tAfter a Cover Girl-themed challenge at a New York Wal-Mart location (won by Claire) the girls headed to a salon for their makeovers.  This time, Tyra informed the girls that not even the Jays knew their plans; they would have their haircuts done and then face the mirror.  Surprisingly, most (if not all) of the girls actually liked their new looks. For the shoot this week, the girls boarded a boat, headed towards the Brooklyn Bridge, and posed in Elle MacPherson's lingerie line (with her behind the camera).  After this, Allison went home despite, allegedly, having the most experience, simply because she was considered ungrateful for the experience. \n"}, {"text": "In week three, the girls posed in outfits made of which of the following materials?", "correct": "Meat", "options": ["Burlap", "Cotton candy", "Cashmere"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeat.\n\n\tIn week three, the girls met with Jay Alexander for runway lessons at a New York City firehouse and proceeded to strut their stuff for the next challenge, a fashion show judged by former \"Top Model\" winner Jaslene and \"Seventeen\" editor-in-chief Ann Shoket.  This was won by Katarzyna.  During their shoot, the girls headed to the meat packing district for a shot in which they not only had to pose with raw meat, but wear clothing made of the same material. This week, Amis was sent home because the judges felt she didn't exude the qualities of a model, instead hiding behind a veneer of goofiness to get by. \n"}, {"text": "Week four brought the girls to Benny Ninja to learn how to pose as per the 3 Cs of modelling.  Which was not one of the Cs?", "correct": "Camera", "options": ["Couture", "Catalog", "Commercial"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCamera.\n\n\tDuring their fourth week, the girls met with supermodel Vendela and posing instructor Benny Ninja to learn the 3Cs, posing for Catalog, Couture, and Commercial.  Their subsequent challenge had them working in teams to pose the best in a dirty alleyway.  The winners ended up receiving a ton of free gifts from a swag tent. Claire, who was deemed the best poser, won a trip to Bora Bora.  The next shoot had the girls taking beauty shots while covered in paint.  While many of the girls stood out, Marvita was unable to break past her hard exterior and the judges sent her home (despite seeing Fatima's unshaved armpits on her own shot). \n"}, {"text": "In weeks five and six, animosity grew between the remaining models.  Whitney, Claire, and Lauren all antagonized which fellow contestant?", "correct": "Dominique", "options": ["Fatima", "Stacy-Ann", "Katarzyna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDominique.\n\n\tThe fifth week of the competition featured a meet-up with Tyra who taught the girls more poses to alleviate some of the walk issues seen by Ms. Jay.  This translated to a subsequent shoot in which the girls needed to epitomize different genres of music.  Some girls were praised for perfectly embodying their genres while others fell flat; Aimee headed home.\rThe next week, the girls split into teams and headed on a series of go-sees through the city.  Through this, Whitney and Dominique continues to seek each others' downfalls.  Despite this, they won the chance to participate in a shoot for \"Seventeen\" magazine with Stacy Ann and Claire.  For the shoot, the girls took inspiration from \"Fuerzabruta\" and posed above the cameras while swimming in water on a mylar sheet.  After this, Claire went home for a lack of variation and for not listening to Jay during the shoot. \n"}, {"text": "During week seven, why did Fatima not participate in the group shot?", "correct": "She had an appointment to receive travel papers", "options": ["She wasn't feeling well", "She refused to pose alongside some of the other girls", "She had the option of not attending because she won the previous challenge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe had an appointment to receive travel papers.\n\n\tWith seven girls left, all of the girls met with Paulina Porizkova to learn about etiquette for interviews and social gatherings.  After a party, Anya received a shoot for a 7-Up ad campaign and, in turn, a $10,000 cheque.  After this, the girls were asked to pass their bag to catch their connection-- naturally, the girls thought it was time to head abroad but they were told that instead they would be posing with their bags in a group photo shoot where they would be running to catch a flight. Fatima, already worried about not being able to go abroad, missed the shoot because she had to head to the consulate to receive her travel documents (as she had refugee status).  After the shoot, the girls were shocked to find that one of them would be eliminated in the adjacent hangar and would, in fact, be heading overseas immediately after. Despite not attending the shoot, the judges felt that Fatima's body of work was better than Stacy Ann's and they sent the latter home. \n"}, {"text": "To which foreign country did the final six models travel in this cycle?", "correct": "Italy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nItaly.\n\n\tAt the beginning of week eight, Tyra sent the girls from New York City to Rome, Italy where they checked into their new lodgings and got the lay of the land with a tour around the city.  Meeting with the Gai Mattiolo stylists and directors, the girls were required to adapt to the Italian style of fashion and Gai Mattiolo himself awarded Anya a red carpet gown. This week's shoot was actually a commercial filmed in Italian for Cover Girl Queen Collection Vibrant Hues Lip Colour.  At the judging panel, no one could forgive Lauren for repeatedly botching the commercial due to her discomfort and her disinterest in being a Cover Girl. \n"}, {"text": "In week nine, the girls had a high fashion Renaissance-themed shoot shot by who of the following?", "correct": "Tyra Banks", "options": ["Nigel Barker", "Jay Manuel", "Jay Alexander"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTyra Banks.\n\n\tWith only five girls left, the models met with the two Jays for an impromptu gladiator acting lesson and photo shoot challenge.  Here, Whitney was considered the best poser and she won a shopping spree in Rome (which she shared with Anya).  This week, the girls were bussed to a shoot with none other than Tyra Banks who sought out high fashion ideals in a Renaissance setting.  Guiding the girls to the slightest extent, she ended up giving the highest praise to Dominique and, at judging, sent Katarzyna home because she didn't stand out. \n"}, {"text": "In their penultimate week, the final four girls we asked to do which of the following with Paulina Porizkova?", "correct": "Take photos", "options": ["Pose in a group shot", "Learn how to use their faces", "Act in a commercial"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTake photos.\n\n\tIn week ten, the last four girls met with Paulina Porizkova in a Rome park to learn how to stand behind the camera and work with a model; all four had six minutes to take as many shots as they wanted, in whatever way they wanted, and the best photographer would win fifty extra frames in their photo shoot with Nigel Barker.  Fatima won this one.  For their subsequent shoot, the girls posed as Italian actresses coming face-to-face with the paparazzi.  Ultimately, the judges did not feel that Dominique was up to the caliber of the other girls and she was sent home leaving only three. \n"}, {"text": "Who was America's Next Top Model in Cycle 10?", "correct": "Whitney & Whitney Thompson", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhitney & Whitney Thompson.\n\n\tFor their first challenge of their final week, the remaining girls had their Cover Girl commercials filmed.  Demonstrating the beauty of LashBlast Mascara, the girls were also told that they would be in a print ad for the product culminating in a billboard appearance in Times Square.  Fatima was the girl sent home leaving Anya and Whitney to battle it out in a runway show for none other than Donatella Versace.  Reviewing their bodies of work, the judges felt that Whitney was the top model; she was the first plus-sized model to win the competition.\rAfter the show, Whitney continued her career in modeling, appearing in several publications and becoming one of the main models for Forever 21.  Aside from winning the $100,000 contract from Cover Girl and the contract with Elite Model Management (and the spread in \"Seventeen\" magazine) she later signed with Wilhelmina Models. \n"}]}
