{"id": "350626", "name": "Survivor: Exile Island Trivia Quiz | Survivor: Exile Island | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Survivor", "Survivor: Exile Island"], "questions": [{"text": "For the first time in \"Survivor\" history, the game began with how many tribes?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Three", "Two", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tDivided by age and gender, this was the first time that the sixteen castaways were split into four tribes of four.  The younger men were Viveros; the older men were La Mina; the younger women were Bayoneta; the older women were Casaya.  On Day 1, these tribes met on Exile Island, an important piece of land off the coast of Panama which would play host to a great deal of ire for certain castaways. For their first challenge, beginning immediately, they would find out the truth behind this.  One member of each tribe needed to run to the other side of the island.  Once they were there they needed to smash skulls to locate one of only a few containing an amulet. If they were one of the first three players to bring back an amulet, they would receive a flint and avoid sending their first player to Exile Island.  Bayoneta lost, so they sent Misty. \n"}, {"text": "Exile Island featured a large pyre shaped like which of these?", "correct": "Skull", "options": ["Torch", "\"Survivor\" Logo", "Shark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkull.\n\n\tExile Island would be some players' homes for a great deal of the game.  If a tribe lost a Reward Challenge, one of their members would be required to stay at Exile Island until the proceeding Immunity Challenge (unless otherwise specified).  Arriving at Exile Island, the exiled tribe member would receive nothing more than a machete and a bucket of water (not much more than the regular tribes did from the get-go).  On the other hand, the exiled castaway would also have the chance to locate a hidden immunity idol somewhere on the island. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 4, how many tribes were dissolved from the game?", "correct": "Two & 2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo & 2.\n\n\tHeading to their Reward Challenge on Day 4, the four tribes were surprised with an early twist.  Each castaway would stand on a slab to determine which two of them would be choosing new tribes.  Terry was required to select members for La Mina while Danielle would choose for Casaya.  This would be done in an alternating fashion-- one man would choose one woman who would choose one man (and soforth).  As a result, Bayoneta and Viveros were removed from the game entirely. Each team took on seven members leaving only Bruce without a tribe.  He was required to stay on Exile Island for three days, through the proceeding Immunity Challenge. He joined the losing tribe when they voted off Melinda. \n"}, {"text": "Who found the Hidden Immunity Idol on Exile Island?", "correct": "Terry", "options": ["Danielle", "Misty", "Bruce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerry.\n\n\tHidden on Exile Island was a single Immunity Idol with immense power.  The person who resided on Exile Island for however long would be able to use clues provided to search for the hidden talisman.  On Terry's first trip to the island (the third person to do so), he located the idol buried in a small crate under a rock under a tree shaped like a 'Y'.  He would be able to use this idol at any time during the game up to and through the Final Four. To use it, he would need to wait until the votes were cast, then present it should he receive the most votes (in which case, the person with the next-highest total votes would go).  This had a great effect on the game. \n"}, {"text": "When the tribes merged into a single group of ten castaways, what name did they take on?", "correct": "Gitanos", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGitanos.\n\n\tOn Day 16, the men of the La Mina tribe (minus Sally on Exile Island) received word that something on their beach didn't quite fit.  They found a boat tied to the rocks near their camp containing firewood and a crate of supplies that they needed to bring with them (and all of their stuff) to their new home at Casaya beach.  Sally joined them when they'd united at the beach.\rWhen all was said and done, they opened the crate to find food and drinks.  They also received their black flag and buffs; their name became Gitanos, the Spanish word for 'Gypsies'. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 23, the tribes headed to the Immunity Challenge and were granted the opportunity to eat or compete.  All of the participants opted to eat.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tHeading into the Immunity Challenge on Day 23, Jeff prompted the tribe members to select a shell and a nut each, and present one or the other depending on whether or not they wanted a meal or a shot at the immunity necklace.  When everyone revealed their choices, Sally and Terry (both La Mina members fighting for their lives) and Aras were the only ones to compete in the challenge while the other five participants were allowed to indulge in cheeseburgers, fries, and soda.  Terry won immunity as a result. \n"}, {"text": "Which castaway was forced to leave the game for medical reasons?", "correct": "Bruce", "options": ["Nick", "Shane", "Austin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBruce.\n\n\tOn Night 25, while Terry was on Exile Island and Cirie, Danielle, and Aras were at a spa reward elsewhere in Panama, Bruce experienced excruciating physical pain in his stomach which was so painful he opted to call in the medics for evacuation.  When he was taken to a hospital it was discovered that his digestive tract had a severe blockage and he would not be returning to the game.  As such he would be out of the running for the million though he would return to be a jury member.  No Immunity Challenge was held and no Tribal Council was held following this event. \n"}, {"text": "As a result of being sent to Exile Island, how many castaways did not need to participate in at least one Tribal Council ceremony?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Four", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tTribal Council acted as both a blessing and a curse for some castaways.\rFor instance, when Bruce was not selected for a tribe on Day 4 he was sent to Exile Island for two nights.  When Casaya lost immunity, he joined the tribe after they eliminated Melinda on Day 6 after their Tribal Council.\rWhen Sally was sent to Exile Island on Day 15 following a joint Reward and Immunity Challenge, she was also saved from the vote that night.  As a result, the four other members of La Minas, all men in an alliance, had to turn on their own members. \n"}, {"text": "During the only tie vote of the season, what did the participating tribe members need to do?", "correct": "Construct a fire", "options": ["Draw stones", "Look back on past vote totals", "Let the jury decide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConstruct a fire.\n\n\tOn Day 36, the final four headed to Tribal Council to cast their votes.  With the Hidden Immunity Idol still available, the vote was up in the air enough to go in any direction.  When the votes were cast, two votes went to Cirie and two went to Danielle.  When the tie persisted, they were forced to battle against each other in a fire-making challenge. Although earlier 'final four' ties (particularly the one in \"Survivor: Marquesas\") involved the purple rock tiebreaker, this season utilized the fire-making task seen in \"Survivor: Palau\".  The first to blaze through a rope would be spared.  After this Tribal Council, the Hidden Idol was no longer usable. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the Sole Survivor and million dollar winner from \"Survivor: Exile Island\"?", "correct": "Aras", "options": ["Danielle", "Terry", "Cirie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAras.\n\n\tAfter whittling the Final Four down to two by eliminating Cirie and multiple-immunity winner Terry, it was Danielle and Aras in the final two.  Heading to their final Tribal Council, the jury of seven asked their questions and ultimately gave the million to Aras.  He received votes from Terry, Cirie, Courtney, Sally, and Austin while Danielle took votes from Shane and Bruce.  During the game, Aras won a single Immunity Challenge (since Terry won five and Danielle won one) and went to Exile Island twice.  Danielle would later return to \"Survivor\" in \"Heroes Vs. Villains\". \n"}]}
