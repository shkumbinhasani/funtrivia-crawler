Operating clandestinely, this group invades laboratories and other animal facilities to free animals and disrupt production. Who are these 'freedom fighters for animals'?", "correct": "Animal Liberation Front", "options": ["Lynx", "Earth First!", "In Defense of Animals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnimal Liberation Front.\n\n\tThey have been listed as a terrorist group by the FBI, and most 'mainstream' animal rights organizations shun them. \n"}, {"text": "A controversial US animal group is often in the news for its publicity stunts for suggesting that college students would be healthier drinking beer than milk. By what acronym is this group known?", "correct": "PETA", "options": ["IDA", "HSUS", "PPF"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPETA.\n\n\tPETA started out as a grassroots group in the early 80's. As they grew, they became more confrontational and in the opinion of many within and without the AR movement, made some unwise decisions such as the 'Milk' commercials. On the other hand, they played a big part in making 'animal rights' a household phrase. \n"}, {"text": "What does the acronym PETA stand for?", "correct": "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals", "options": ["People for Ending Torture of Animals", "Pointless Experiments Torture Animals", "People for Ending Testing on Animals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\n\n\tAnother group, People for Eating Tasty Animals, has also used this moniker. \n"}, {"text": "This founder of PETA is most famous for a quote from the Washington Post interview, 'A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy'. She was referring to the fact that all of these creatures are capable of feeling pain, in fact the part that was left out was, 'When it comes to feeling pain...'

The monkeys lived in filthy conditions. The researcher, Dr. Taub, was convicted of several counts of cruelty, which were overturned on technicalities. The AR community fought for years for custody of the remaining monkeys, but never won it. Eventually, all the operated monkeys were killed at a primate research facility, while the control group- which had never been experimented on- went to the San Diego Zoo. \n"}, {"text": "In 1984, videotape was released of yet another horrifying experiment. It showed conscious animals being operated on and mocked by lab technicians. During the film, while teasing an animal, one tech said, 'You'd better hope the anti-vivisection people don't get ahold of this'. What kind of animals were being used in this lab?", "correct": "Baboons", "options": ["Chimpanzees", "Dogs", "Cats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaboons.\n\n\tThese experiments on head injury, revealed in videotapes stolen by the ALF, were being carried out by Dr. Genarelli at the Univ. of Pennsylvania. The lab was eventually closed down. \n"}, {"text": "This 1987 movie was, at first, viewed as a positive step for the animal rights movement, as it carried a strong anti-vivisection message.

This banner read, 'I'd Rather Go Naked than...'", "correct": "Wear Fur", "options": ["Eat Meat", "Wear Leather", "Go Hunting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWear Fur.\n\n\tPETA also got many celebrities, such as the singing group The Bangles, to pose for posters with this slogan. \n"}, {"text": "In some respects, the March For The Animals, held in Washington DC, marked the beginning of a transition time in the U.S. animal rights movement.One event that will never be forgotten by participants is that Christopher Reeve (before his horseriding accident) gave a speech that called for moderation rather than abolition of animal experimentation. In what year did this march take place?", "correct": "1990", "options": ["1980", "1986", "1985"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1990.\n\n\tThe March is considered a transition because it is one of the last events that many groups co-operated on. In addition, since the March the anti-AR groups have grown in power, the public appeal of AR has faded, and many groups have gone under. Yet, 'animal rights' has become a household word, and the public's perception of animal problems has changed- usually for the better. \n"}, {"text": "One of the issues of concern to the animal rights movement is the raising of animals for food.
