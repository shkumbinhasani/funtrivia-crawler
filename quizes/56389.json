Online Quiz | Baseketball | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Baseketball"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the following is NOT an actual BASEketball team?", "correct": "The New Jersey Mobsters", "options": ["The San Francisco Ferries", "The San Antonio Defenders", "The Roswell Aliens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe New Jersey Mobsters.\n\n\tThe New Jersey team was actually The Informants. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following Milwaukee Beers is left-handed?", "correct": "Joe 'Coop' Cooper", "options": ["None -- they are all right-handed", "'Squeak' Scolari", "Doug 'Sir. Swish' Remer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe 'Coop' Cooper.\n\n\tClearly shown throughout the film. \n"}, {"text": "In the sport of BASEketball, players on defense are allowed to perform 'psyche outs' -- distractions intended to throw off the 'batter.' Which of the following 'psyche outs' do we NOT see performed throughout the movie?", "correct": "We see all of these", "options": ["Wearing a DEA jacket", "Playing a spoof of the book-on-tape version of 'The Horse Whisperer'", "Chewing aluminum foil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe see all of these.\n\n\tDoug Remer (Matt Stone) plays the book-on-tape, which puts the batter to sleep. Joe 'Coop' Cooper (Trey Parker) frightens a member of the Miami Dealers with a DEA jacket, and freaks out another player by chewing on a huge wad of aluminum foil. \n"}, {"text": "Early in the film, when Coop and Remer are playing BASEketball alone in their driveway, they each spit out the name of a certain singer as an attempted 'psyche out.' Who is this singer, whose very mention is apparently distracting to one's concentration?", "correct": "Steve Perry", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve Perry.\n\n\tI have no idea why the name of the lead singer of Journey is considered distracting, but Cooper made it work on Remer. He even followed up with a rendition of the first line from 'Oh Sherrie.' \n"}, {"text": "Billionaire Ted Denslow shows up at Coop and Remer's house to offer them a chance to form a professional BASEketball league. How many years pass in between that scene and the next one, set at Beers Garden in Milwaukee?", "correct": "five", "options": ["three", "four", "six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfive.\n\n\tA title card reads 'Five Years Later' when we see Coop and Remer in uniform for the first time. \n"}, {"text": "Coop and Remer's diminuitive sidekick is 'Squeak' Scolari. What is his real first name?", "correct": "Kenny & Ken & Kenneth", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKenny & Ken & Kenneth.\n\n\tGiven all the physical damage that Squeak suffers throughout the film, one has to assume that calling him 'Kenny' is a reference to the 'South Park' character of the same name, who dies in almost every episode. \n"}, {"text": "Young Joey Thomas, one of Jenna Reed's (Yasmine Bleeth) charges in the Dreams Come True Foundation, is seriously ill, and requires an operation. A problem with which of his organs is causing his life-threatening condition?", "correct": "his liver", "options": ["his kidneys", "his brain", "his heart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhis liver.\n\n\tIt's never said exactly what's wrong with Joey, but it's stated several times that his illness is hepatic in nature. \n"}, {"text": "In one scene, Jenna is sitting beside Joey's hospital bed, reading aloud to him. From what book is she reading?", "correct": "'Women Who Run With the Wolves'", "options": ["'The Bridges Of Madison County'", "'Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus'", "'The Horse Whisperer'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Women Who Run With the Wolves'.\n\n\tA typically laughable 'Oprah Book Club' selection, by Clarissa Pinkola Estes, PhD. Hope you kept the receipt for that doctorate, Clarissa! \n"}, {"text": "Coop and Remer visit Joey in the hospital and ask him what his greatest wish would be. Before he asks for a day of 'hanging out' with the Milwaukee Beers, he lists off several other possible wishes. Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "'Helping O.J. find the real killer!'", "options": ["'Big game hunting!'", "'Chelsea Clinton!'", "'Poisoning a reservoir!'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Helping O.J. find the real killer!'\n\n\tThe O.J. joke would have been perfectly at home in this film -- there's at least one such crack later in the film -- but Joey never mentions O.J. at all. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following real-life sports legends does NOT appear in 'BASEketball'?", "correct": "Shaquille O'Neal", "options": ["Dale Earnhardt", "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar", "Reggie Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShaquille O'Neal.\n\n\tAbdul-Jabbar, no stranger to the films of director David Zucker (remember 'Airplane!'?), appears in a rather amusing cameo as part of Baxter Cain's exalted sports memorabilia room -- we even see him punching a time clock. Earnhardt has a cameo as a cab driver. Jackson, of course, is the inspiration for Coop's lifelong dream of becoming a sports legend. (He was also in 'The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!'.) O'Neal is mentioned several times, but never appears in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following real-life sports announcers does NOT appear in 'BASEketball'?", "correct": "Marv Albert", "options": ["Bob Costas", "Al Michaels", "Pat O'Brien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarv Albert.\n\n\tCostas and Michaels appear to be the regular announcers for Milwaukee Beers games. O'Brien is less prevalent, but presents the Beers with the coveted Denslow Cup trophy at the end of the film. No sign of Albert. \n"}, {"text": "Trey Parker and Matt Stone manage to sneak in the voices of a few 'South Park' characters during the film. Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Big Gay Al", "options": ["Eric Cartman", "Mr. Garrison", "We hear all of these voices"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig Gay Al.\n\n\tCoop slips into Mr. Garrison mode when he observes, sarcastically, 'Oh, I forgot how much Doug Remer cares about kids.' Later, when it's suggested that he should 'psyche out' a portly BASEketball player by making unsavory references to his weight, Coop emulates Eric Cartman, who's not exactly svelte. Matt Stone never gets a chance in the film to do his Big Gay Al voice. \n"}, {"text": "We see several 'special nights' at Beers Garden. Which of the following is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Canned Ham Night", "options": ["Dozen Eggs Night", "We see all of these 'special nights'", "Free-Range Chicken Night"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanned Ham Night.\n\n\tGiven that many fans started throwing the eggs at the players on Dozen Eggs Night, it's probably best that Canned Ham Night never happened. \n"}, {"text": "Coop, Remer, and Squeak bring a close to Joey Thomas' 'hang out with the Beers' day by bringing him to a bar to get drunk with them. The deleterious effects of that excursion are obvious later that night, when Coop's peformance in the game is less than impressive. Finish this observation about Coop's condition from the announcer: 'He's 1 for 11, and he smells like _________________.'", "correct": "Christian Slater", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristian Slater.\n\n\tPerhaps a bit harsh...but there's a later reference to Robert Downey, Jr. that's perhaps even more tasteless, in retrospect. \n"}, {"text": "During the sickly amusing scene in which Coop and Remer try to revive the unconscious Joey Thomas, a reference is made to a person known for playing a certain 'ER' character. Which character is it?", "correct": "Dr. Doug Ross", "options": ["Dr. Peter Benton", "Nurse Carol Hathaway", "Dr. Mark Greene"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Doug Ross\n\n\tCoop: 'I need those paddles that George Clooney uses!' Clooney played Doug Ross on 'ER' from 1994 to 1999, and is occasionally credited with putting 'South Park' on the map via word-of-mouth to his Hollywood friends. \n"}, {"text": "Jenna mentions to Coop and Remer that she is going to visit young Joey in the hospital. Remer, ever eager to suck up to Jenna, blurts out, 'I'll come with you -- I love hospitals!' Finish Coop's immediate attempt to correct him: 'No, you don't! You like ___________!'", "correct": "Taco Bell", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTaco Bell.\n\n\tThere's a reference shortly after Coop's line making it clear that Remer has confused hostels with hospitals, but Coop's immediate response is the Taco Bell line. \n"}, {"text": "The actor who plays Tuttle, the feared behemoth of the L.A. Riots, appeared in an earlier sports-related comedy. What was it?", "correct": "'Necessary Roughness'", "options": ["'Tin Cup'", "'Major League'", "'Bull Durham'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Necessary Roughness'.\n\n\tSamoan actor Peter Navy Tuiasosopo also played Manumana, the center for the Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos, in 1991's 'Necessary Roughness.' \n"}, {"text": "The Milwaukee Beers apparently have a 'house band' for home games. What is the name of this band that plays live music for them?", "correct": "Reel Big Fish", "options": ["Fishing Real", "Gone Fishin'", "Phish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReel Big Fish.\n\n\tThey're a real band, by the way. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following movies was not directly spoofed in 'BASEketball'?", "correct": "'Forrest Gump'", "options": ["'Titanic'", "'Braveheart'", "'The Natural'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Forrest Gump'.\n\n\tThe whole business with Coop constructing his ball, 'La-Z-Boy' -- and losing it at a critical moment, only to have it replaced by a homemade ball from a young fan -- is lifted right out of 'The Natural.' When Coop and Remer are falling straight down on the Polypeneisan 'balance board' in the final game, Coop says to Remer, 'Remember -- hold your breath before you hit!', a clear reference to Jack's identical instruction to Rose in 'Titanic,' just before the boat finally plummets for good.Coop quotes William Wallace's 'I love ya -- always have' from 'Braveheart'...and Squeak, while being tortured by the L.A. Riots, cries out 'FREEDOM!' If there's a 'Forrest Gump' reference, I sure didn't see it. \n"}, {"text": "Baxter Cain blackmails Coop and Remer by threatening to reveal to the public the fact that the newly-established Milwaukee Beers clothing line utilizes illegal child labor overseas. In what city is the offending factory?", "correct": "Calcutta", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalcutta.\n\n\tCoop personally travels there to set things straight. \n"}, {"text": "Late in the film, Coop drives a Volkswagen Beetle, presumably his own, to the airport. What color is the car?", "correct": "red", "options": ["blue", "black", "green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nred.\n\n\tThat'll hurt his insurance rates. =) \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following real-world television shows makes an appearance in 'BASEketball'?", "correct": "'Unsolved Mysteries'", "options": ["'Geraldo'", "'20-20'", "'George Michael's Sports Machine'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Unsolved Mysteries'.\n\n\tRobert Stack, who appeared in 'Airplane!', spoofs his own show to tremendous comedic effect. We did see 'The Jerry Springer Show' on a TV in a bar, but never 'Geraldo.' \n"}, {"text": "When we first see Squeak Scolari at the beginning of the film, who is his employer?", "correct": "the gas company", "options": ["the cable company", "the electric company", "the phone company"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe gas company.\n\n\tSqueak initially shows up at Coop and Remer's house to shut off the gas, since they haven't paid their bill. \n"}, {"text": "Which character did Joe 'Coop' Cooper NOT kiss during the film?", "correct": "Yvette Denslow", "options": ["Doug Remer", "Jenna Reed", "He kissed them all"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYvette Denslow.\n\n\tCoop kisses Jenna several times. He shares a remarkably passionate kiss with Remer late in the film. He never gets anywhere near Ted Denslow's widow, Yvette (Jenny McCarthy) -- but Remer does, at the very end of the film. \n"}, {"text": "A tough one to close it out: What was the final score of Denslow Cup V?", "correct": "Beers 17, Felons 16", "options": ["Beers 18, Felons 17", "Beers 19, Felons 18", "Beers 16, Felons 15"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeers 17, Felons 16.\n\n\tCoop and Remer used a rather complicated play (similar to the one we saw them use early in the film) to win the game. \n"}]}
