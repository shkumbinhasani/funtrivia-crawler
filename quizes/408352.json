{"id": "408352", "name": "Think About Thinking Quiz | Health and Human Biology | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " Health and Human Biology", "Psychology"], "questions": [{"text": "What is metacognition?", "correct": "Thinking about how you think", "options": ["Thinking about how dreams are interpreted", "Thinking about lunch", "Thinking about the correct way to conjugate a verb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThinking about how you think.\n\n\tThe prefix \"meta\" means \"beyond.\" \"Cognition\" comes from the Latin for \"to know.\" Therefore metacognition essentially means \"thinking beyond what you know,\" ergo thinking about how you think. \n"}, {"text": "One skill associated with metacognition is planning. Which of these is a good habit that comes from being able to plan?", "correct": "Organization of both time and resources", "options": ["Doing things that do not work over and over", "Being correct", "Understanding things better"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrganization of both time and resources.\n\n\tWith metacognition, you know what you know and don't know. Therefore you can organize based on this. You know what you need to complete something and how long you need to do it. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these can metacognition help you recognize?", "correct": "strengths and weaknesses", "options": ["errors on an essay", "the correct answer on a mutiple choice test", "countries on a map"], "explanation": "\n\n\nstrengths and weaknesses.\n\n\tKnowing more about how you think helps you better understand your strengths and weaknesses. This is important because they ask it at job interviews. Also, if you know areas you are weak in you can improve on those. It's hard to improve when you don't know what needs improving. \n"}, {"text": "At what age does metacognition start to develop?", "correct": "birth", "options": ["ten", "thirteen", "twenty-five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbirth.\n\n\tAccording to David Whitebread (2007) in his PhD on the subject in England, research shows that children develop metacognition skills from birth. This is enhanced by communication, especially with open-ended questions that encourage a child to think about things more. Also, discussing feelings is a good thing so that a child can learn to recognize how they are feeling at any given time. \n"}, {"text": "Can metacognition ever be unhelpful?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tMetacognition can be distracting when you are trying to complete a task. This is because the task will never get done if you overthink about how to do it, rather than just getting on with it. Also, overthinking can cause more mistakes when things aren't as hard as they seem. \n"}, {"text": "What is the first step in developing metacognition?", "correct": "Identifying what you know", "options": ["Knowing the parts of the brain", "Observation", "Learning to read"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIdentifying what you know.\n\n\tYou need to know what you know before thinking about what you know. To do this, write two lists, \"What I know about (topic)\" and \"what I want to learn about (topic).\" \n"}, {"text": "Who coined the term \"metacognition?\"", "correct": "John Flavell", "options": ["John Wayne", "John Denver", "John Quincy Adams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Flavell.\n\n\tJohn Flavell introduced the word in the 1970s. Flavell was a developmental psychologist from Massachussettes. He has written several books such as \"Cognitive Development\" and \"The Development Psychology of Jean.\" He has also written over 100 articles. \n"}, {"text": "Journaling is an excellent way to improve metacognition skills. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhen a person journals, they write their thoughts. For example, someone might write about a person they are having trouble with. They will ask \"why I am having trouble, what I can do, and how I feel?\" As they do this day after day, their thoughts become more together because they have developed metacognition. \n"}, {"text": "Between which ages does metacognition have the most growth?", "correct": "12-15", "options": ["3-6", "9-12", "20-24"], "explanation": "\n\n\n12-15.\n\n\tThose who teach in the 12-15 age range can further help their students' metacognition grow by asking open-ended questions, encouraging the children to think about how and why they do something. At this age, children are starting to become more independent and need to problem-solve with guidance, but not direct instruction. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is important to think about when regarding metacognition?", "correct": "Past, Present and Future", "options": ["Future and Past", "Past", "Past and Present"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPast, Present and Future.\n\n\tHaving to think about all three tenses is what makes metacognition complex. A person has to think about what worked in the past to figure out what they can do now (in the present) so that the future outcome will be what they want. This complexity is why it's best to start training children early on to think about how they think. \n"}]}
