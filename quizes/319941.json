{"id": "319941", "name": "Biblical Lions Online Trivia | Bible: Something in Common | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "Bible: Something in Common", "Bible Plants and Animals"], "questions": [{"text": "There is a Scripture in the Bible that mentions two big cats: lions and leopards.  The Scripture is found in Canticles.  By what other name is Canticles known?", "correct": "Song of Solomon", "options": ["Chronicles", "Psalms", "Acts of the Apostles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSong of Solomon.\n\n\tSong of Solomon is abbreviated Ca in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, because it is alternately called the Canticles.  Chapter four and verse eight of Song of Solomon says, \"With me from Lebanon, O bride, with me from Lebanon may you come. May you descend from the top of Anti-Lebanon, from the top of Senir, even Hermon, from the lair of lions, from the mountains of leopards.\"  This Scripture shows that lions lived in Palestine, although they are extinct there now.  Other Scriptures, such as Jeremiah 49:19, show them as living along the Jordan river. \n"}, {"text": "When speaking to Saul, this young boy recalled his killing of both a lion and a bear with his bare hands to save his sheep.  He told Saul that the Philistine he was about to fight was just like one of them.  Who might this boy have been?", "correct": "David", "options": ["Samuel", "Joseph", "Matthew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid.\n\n\tDavid was known as a loving protector of his sheep.  He was a fine shepherd, and would do anything for them.  This included killing both a bear and a lion.  He told Saul that Goliath the Philistine was just like one of them, and he must be killed just as the bear and the lion were killed.  He told Saul this in 1 Samuel 17: 34-36.\r Sometimes shepherds did not succeed in saving sheep from the lion's mouth.  They would simply take back part of the animal from the lion's mouth so they would not have to pay for his loss (sort of like insurance, I suppose). \n"}, {"text": "This man also killed a lion, but this time by ripping it in two!  This strong man was with his mother and father at the time, but did not tell them he had just killed a lion.  Who might this have been?", "correct": "Samson", "options": ["Peter", "Laman", "Reuben"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSamson.\n\n\tSamson was known for his long hair, which made him incredibly strong.  He killed 3,000 people with the jawbone of an ass, killed a lion by ripping it in two (Judges 14:5,6), and pulled down an entire building.  He must have been a pretty scary guy! \n"}, {"text": "In what was perhaps a less well-known encounter with a lion, this man, too, killed one.  He was the son of Jehoiada, and killed the lion in a waterpit in the snow!  Who might this brave man be?", "correct": "Benaiah", "options": ["Linus", "Obil", "Koz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBenaiah.\n\n\tKoz was a decendent of Judah, Obil was the caretaker of David's camels, and Linus was mentioned by Paul as having greeted Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:21.  Benaiah killed a lion in the waterpit during a snowfall, according to 2 Samuel 23:20.  The Scripture says that he went into the pit to kill the lion.  He could have avoided the lion completely, but instead, he mustered up courage and went in to kill the lion! \n"}, {"text": "A very famous lion encounter was that of this man.  He prayed to God and not to King Darius, so he was thrown into a lions' den.  The lions were kept hungry, so they would eat the prisoners.  This was sort of a death sentence.  But he survived!  Who might this be?", "correct": "Daniel", "options": ["Herod", "Timothy", "Korah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaniel.\n\n\tDaniel was known in the Bible as having survived the lions' pit.  When the king threw him in, he teased him, saying, \"Your God whom you are serving with constancy, he himself will rescue you.\" (Daniel 6:16,17).  It turned out his teasing came true.  God rescued Daniel from the pit.  Several days later, when they found him in there, they were amazed!  They realized Daniel's God was the true god so they quickly took Daniel out, and instead threw in the one who accused Daniel of wrongdoing, along with his entire family. According to verse 24 of Daniel chapter 6, they did not even hit the bottom of the pit before the lions started eating their flesh and crushing their bones. \n"}, {"text": "According to 2 Timothy 4:17, who was delivered from the lion's mouth?", "correct": "Paul", "options": ["Mark", "John", "Luke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul.\n\n\tPaul was delivered from the lion's mouth according to the Scripture.  It is unknown whether the incident was figurative or literal.  Had it been literal, Paul's situation would likely have been similar to that of Daniel's.  God would have closed the lion's mouth, so it would not eat Paul. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the prophet who disobeyed God simply by eating, and was killed by lions?", "correct": "He is not named", "options": ["Jehosaphat", "Josiah", "Jeroboam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is not named.\n\n\tThe prophet mentioned in 1 Kings 13 is unnamed.  He ate holy bread and water, which he was warned not to do.  He was told that if he did so, he would not be buried with his forefathers.  On his way back, a lion found him on the road and killed him.  The prophet was unnamed, and was only called \"old prophet\". \n"}, {"text": "According to Isaiah 11:7, in the New World Translation, the lion will eat the same thing as what animal?", "correct": "Bull", "options": ["Sheep", "Goat", "Cow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBull.\n\n\tAccording to Isaiah 11, \"the lion will eat straw just as the bull does.\"  \"The maned young lion will lie down with the calf.  The wolf will reside with the male lamb, and with a kid the leopard will lie down.\"  Isaiah 11: 6,7. \n"}, {"text": "According to Proverbs, which of these people has said, \"There's a lion outside!\"?", "correct": "Lazy one", "options": ["Lame one", "Blind one", "Dumb one"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLazy one.\n\n\tProverbs 22:13 and Proverbs 26:13 both mention the lazy one exclaiming that there is a lion in the city, and in 22:13, he claims it will murder him.  The lazy one does not run away from the lion.  In Proverbs, lazy ones do not work, blind ones cannot see, lame ones cannot walk, and dumb ones cannot speak. \n"}, {"text": "According to Proverbs 19:12, what is like the growling of a maned young lion?", "correct": "Raging of a king", "options": ["Goodwill of a king", "Courage of a king", "Strength of a king"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaging of a king.\n\n\tProverbs 19:12 says \"The raging of a king is a growling like that of a maned young lion, but his goodwill is like the dew upon the vegetation.\"  The Scripture is saying that the good of a king is the dew in the morning, but his rage is that of a lion's growl.  This Scripture is a good example of imagery. \n"}]}
