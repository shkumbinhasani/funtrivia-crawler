{"id": "361094", "name": "This One's For the Ladies Quiz | Celebrities Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Celebrity Trivia", "Celebrities Mixture", "   Quotes by Celebrities"], "questions": [{"text": "Step right up, ladies.  What actor/director/screenwriter once claimed that \"There's something really great and romantic about being poor and sleeping on couches.\"?", "correct": "Ben Affleck", "options": ["Kevin Smith", "Matt Damon", "Quentin Tarantino"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen Affleck.\n\n\tBen Affleck, who's spent most of his professional life raking in Oscars and money, has never been one to let fame and fortune not interfere in quote-making.  This celebrity is a man who also said \"I just feel like sometimes I'm a force to be dealt with. My talents are sometimes overused and also sometimes underused. It's not easy being me.\"\r Affleck, however, seems to have it all justified.  He directed \"Argo\" to a Best Picture win in 2012, co-wrote the Oscar-winning \"Good Will Hunting\" with Matt Damon.  On the same note he's won two Razzies with five nominations.  As Affleck has been cited as saying: \"I feel like fame is wasted on me.\"  Okay then. \n"}, {"text": "What male celebrity, known for living on tiger's blood, once said \"News-flash. I am special and I will never be one of you. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. My success rate is 100%!\"?", "correct": "Charlie Sheen", "options": ["Jim Carrey", "Robert Downey Jr.", "Tim Allen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlie Sheen.\n\n\tIn the 2010s, Charlie Sheen received a fair amount of media attention, particularly because of his cocaine struggles and canning from the long-running TV show \"Two and a Half Men\".  Despite this, Sheen stayed in good form as he took a very-much-panned U.S. comedy tour.  Aside from claiming he had tiger's blood and Adonis DNA (who doesn't, am I right?), he also popularized the phrase \"WINNING!\" and checked himself into the Sober Valley Lodge (it's not a real place-- it's in his mind).\r This is a man who said \"I don't think I'm a romantic sex symbol but I think I'm ruggedly handsome.\"  Step right up, ladies! \n"}, {"text": "Despite having been a movie cowboy at least once in his career, what \"Jarhead\" actor made note that \"Sometimes what I actually love to do is go to a farm and get fresh milk or watch a pig get slaughtered.\"?\n\n(Saucy, eh?)", "correct": "Jake Gyllenhaal", "options": ["Heath Ledger", "Jamie Foxx", "Tobey Maguire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJake Gyllenhaal.\n\n\tGyllenhaal has also been seen in \"Zodiac\", \"Proof\", \"Source Code\", and \"Brokeback Mountain\".  Quite the high-profile actor he's been in the spotlight since the early 2000s.  He's also the brother of actress Maggie Gyllenhaal.\r At the same time he's also said some pretty weird things.  At one point he said the following: \"If you're going to spend seven months of your life - for me seven months, for Roland Emmerich, 3, 4, 5 years of his life - doing something, I think you have to have something to say.\"  This concerns me a little since Emmerich is fairly well-known for making movies where he destroys the White House (\"Independence Day\", \"The Day After Tomorrow\", \"2012\", \"White House Down\"...).  Ah well...as Gyllenhaal himself says, \"crazy people don't sit around wondering if they're nuts.\" \n"}, {"text": "Ever the political figure, what celebrity, when asked to discuss his views on gay marriage, claimed that \"gay marriage is something that should be between a man and a woman\"?", "correct": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "options": ["Jerry Springer", "Clint Eastwood", "Al Franken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n\tFormerly a Terminator, a Kindergarten Cop, and the Governor of the State of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger took office in 2003 and held his position for eight years.  But what modern political campaign wouldn't be without its blown-out-of-proportion quotes?  In an interview with CNN, Schwarzenegger stated said quote about gay marriage, possibly because he was being asked pressing rapid-fire questions.\r This is the same man who said that \"the difference between Sly Stallone and me is I am me and he is him.\"  Oh. \n"}, {"text": "Which male singer, when discussing their newfound interest in tattoos on \"The Late Show with David Letterman\", mentioned \"I'm not going for the Sixteenth Chapel,\" in regards to their upcoming religious ink?", "correct": "Justin Bieber", "options": ["Justin Timberlake", "Axl Rose", "Harry Styles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJustin Bieber.\n\n\tCanadian-born Bieber, while popular with pre-teen girls, has often been under intense media scrutiny due to his originally sweet attitude and songs and his evolution into an R&B/hip-hop/dance artist (and adult).  While many artists either fold under pressure or stick with a winning formula, Bieber opted to become more 'with it', though the relevance of wearing adult onesies and getting tattoos may have been lost on people.\r On \"The Late Show with David Letterman\", Letterman, in his typical gibing way, poked fun at the heartthrob's new interest in tattoos, discussing the potential Christian iconography he was yet to add to his growing canvas.  At one point, Letterman told him not to get carried away with a mural like the Sistine Chapel.  Bieber responded that he would not get said \"Sixteenth Chapel\".  This is the same person who didn't know what basketball was in Germany.  Sigh. \n"}, {"text": "Despite being a part of American business for the greater part of a century (and on TV for over a decade), what mogul once said  \"All of the women on [the show] flirted with me---consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.\"?", "correct": "Donald Trump", "options": ["Ben Stein", "Howie Mandel", "Alan Sugar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDonald Trump.\n\n\tTrump began hosting \"The Apprentice\" in the early 2000s and the show took off, going international and having several U.S. seasons before the economy plummeted into a significant recession.  Nonetheless, in all of the regular and celebrity versions of the show, the point was the same-- to be successful either in business or charity ventures.  One thing was clear though, Trump was the face of all that was the show (not just Omarosa).\r Then again, Trump has also claimed that if he were to describe Atlantic City in one word, it would be 'Big Business'. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps a prerequisite for his former job as an \"America's Got Talent\" judge, what former fake-lifeguard pledged, \"I've got taste. It's inbred in me.\"?", "correct": "David Hasselhoff", "options": ["Howard Stern", "Piers Morgan", "Simon Cowell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Hasselhoff.\n\n\tHasselhoff, who hit it big acting on \"Knight Rider\" and \"Baywatch\" (and...*shudders*...\"Baywatch Nights\"), took on a job for the \"Got Talent\" shows in the mid-to-late 2000s, appearing in both the U.S. and UK versions.  He also found fame in Germany, particularly in a music career considered lackluster in North America.\r At the same time, Hasselhoff ended up going the route of Gary Busey, taking a career in b-movies and bringing out out weird soundbites like \"I try to let the ladies gravitate towards me so it doesn't look like I'm trying to jump into bed with them\" and \"There are many dying children out there whose last wish is to meet me.\"  Self-confidence can get you anywhere. \n"}, {"text": "What former Calvin Klein model and 1990s rapper confessed  \"I should have kept my shirt on a lot more. And not pulled my pants down so much.\"?", "correct": "Mark Wahlberg", "options": ["Taylor Lautner", "David Beckham", "Antonio Sabato Jr."], "explanation": "\n\n\nMark Wahlberg.\n\n\tWait, wait.  That sounds sensible, doesn't it?  Well...this comes from the same man who once said  \"I miss being able to wake up when I want and go on stage when I want and pull down my pants when I want.\"\rMark Wahlberg, who was once known as Marky Mark (with his Funky Bunch), hit it big in the rap scene and subsequently filtered his way into big-screen action cinema.  He has since appeared in the Oscar-winning \"The Departed\" (for which he was nominated for an Oscar himself), \"The Italian Job\" (2003), \"The Fighter\", and \"Ted\".\r He is also quoted as saying  \"The world is very different today than it was in 1968.\"  Yes it is, Marky Mark.  Yes it is. \n"}, {"text": "What \"Daredevil\"/Alexander the Great-actor cryptically stated that \"there's something very basic about rubbing honey on your skin and going steaming with a bunch of strange Russian men.\"?", "correct": "Colin Farrell", "options": ["Kevin Spacey", "Val Kilmer", "Tom Cruise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColin Farrell.\n\n\tLet me preface this by reminding players that Farrell is also a person who claimed that \"heroin is fine in moderation\".  Farrell, after breaking into the scene in films like \"Minority Report\", \"Daredevil\", \"Phone Booth\", and \"S.W.A.T.\", followed up a successful acting career with scandalous entries into the tabloids but managed to retain his professional side as well.  But such a life isn't without its quotes.  On one hand he's said \"I don't say or do things for shock tactics.\" On the other, he's said  \"It's not that I'm stupid. I just don't think sometimes.\" \n"}, {"text": "What notoriously outspoken rapper and seemingly-professional Twitter-yeller once claimed \"I'm like a tree.  I feed the branches of the people.\"?", "correct": "Kanye West", "options": ["Jay-Z", "R. Kelly", "Eminem"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKanye West.\n\n\tKanye West is quite the polarizing figure.  On one hand, his music is often critically-praised and seen as visionary for the rap/hip-hop industry; his album \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" was one of the most acclaimed albums of the 2000s.  On the other hand, he has tendency to say the absolute worst thing to anger the widest amount of people.  And this is beside destroying Taylor Swift's VMA acceptance speech.\r It doesn't end there-- West once claimed that he can't listen to his own music because \"my apartment is too nice to listen to rap in.  I have to be in a way more grimy environment to turn any rap music on.\"  This is the same person who said: \"I realize that my place and position in history is that I will go down as the voice of this generation, of this decade, I will be the loudest voice.\" \n"}]}
