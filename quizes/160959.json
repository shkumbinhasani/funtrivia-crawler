He even bumps into the disguised Holmes and apologises for the books that he has knocked down. Holmes' strange \"croaking voice\" is not recognised even when he speaks directly to his old friend. When Holmes reveals himself Watson faints for the first and only time in his life. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the only person in whom Holmes confided when the rest of the world believed that he had died at the Reichenbach Falls in the encounter with Moriarty?", "correct": "His brother Mycroft", "options": ["Inspector MacDonald", "Inspector Lestrade", "Inspector Gregson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis brother Mycroft.\n\n\tHolmes apologises to Watson for leaving him in the dark about what happened. However, he had needed Watson's realistic account of his \"death\" in order throw his enemies off his track. He had only confided in Mycroft because he had needed money for his travels to Tibet. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Empty House\" who is the man with the \"virile and sinister face\" that Holmes and Watson overpower in the building opposite to their rooms in Baker Street?", "correct": "Colonel Sebastian Moran", "options": ["Moriarty's younger brother, John", "Ronald Adair", "Von Herder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColonel Sebastian Moran.\n\n\tColonel Moran had been Moriarty's chief of staff and was one of the few people who knew that Holmes had survived by the waterfall. He was in the empty house intending to shoot Holmes with the special air-gun built by Von Herder, the blind German mechanic. Ronald Adair was one of Moran's victims because he had threatened to expose the Colonel as a card cheat. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Norwood Builder\" what had John Hector MacFarlane left in Mr. Jonas Oldacre's house that set the police on his trail.", "correct": "His walking stick.", "options": ["His gloves.", "His umbrella.", "His cigar case."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis walking stick.\n\n\tAccording to the report which Watson reads out from the \"Daily Telegraph\" it was an oaken walking stick which showed stains of blood on its handle. In the same room were signs of a \"murderous struggle\" and an open safe. This pointed to the obvious conclusion that MacFarlane had been involved in a murder. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Norwood Builder\" what did Holmes deduce from the erratic handwriting in the preparation document for the will that Jonas Oldacre wanted drawn up?", "correct": "It had been written on a train.", "options": ["It had been written by a man who was being held prisoner.", "It had been written by a man in the last stages of a terminal illness.", "It had been written by a man who was normally right-handed but who was using his left."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt had been written on a train.\n\n\tSome lines on the document were as clear as print; some lines were very badly written and in some places the document could not be read at all. The clear writing was from when the train was stopped. The indifferent writing was from when the train was in motion. The indecipherable writing occurred when the train passed over a series of points. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Norwood Builder\" what was the conclusive new evidence of MacFarlane's guilt that Lestrade claims to have found?", "correct": "The bloody thumbprint of MacFarlane at the crime scene.", "options": ["Marked money from Oldacre's safe in MacFarlane's wallet.", "The clear footprint which corresponded with MacFarlane's boot.", "Traces of blood on MacFarlane's trousers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bloody thumbprint of MacFarlane at the crime scene.\n\n\tWhen Holmes first sees the thumbprint he is exultant. He had made a close examination of the crime scene on the previous day. He knew that the incriminating mark had been put there over night. This meant that his client was innocent for he did not have access to the premises during this time. In fact the new thumbprint had been created using the wax that Oldacre had made MacFarlane press to seal a letter on the night of the supposed murder. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Dancing Men\" which is the first letter that Sherlock Holmes is able to work out when he tackles the code of the dancing men?", "correct": "E", "options": ["T", "A", "O"], "explanation": "\n\n\nE.\n\n\tHolmes declares, \"As you are aware E is the most common letter in the English alphabet and it predominates to so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect to find it most often.\" After that he mentions T,A,O,I,N,S,H as the letters most likely to come second, third, fourth, etc by numerical calculations. However, they are so close in frequency that they are not as easy to predict as E. \n"}, {"text": "Having identified the first letter in the code of the \"dancing men\" which female name does Holmes use to help him find the other letters?", "correct": "Elsie", "options": ["Roberta", "Agnes", "Sylvia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElsie.\n\n\tElsie is the name of the woman involved in the case. However, from a decoding point of view, her name is also very helpful because it contains the letter \"E\" more than once. This enables Holmes to work out the letters \"L\", \"S\" and \"I\". With these four letters available it is only a matter of time before the code representations of each letter fall into his hands. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Solitary Cyclist\" Holmes sends Watson down to find out as much as he can about the inhabitants of Charlington Hall. When Watson returns with his scanty information where does Holmes say that he should have gone to find out more?", "correct": "To the local pub.", "options": ["To the local estate agent.", "To the local railway station.", "To the local tea-shop."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo the local pub.\n\n\t\"Go to the nearest public-house. That is the centre of country gossip. They would have told you every name from the master to the scullery maid.\" This is how Holmes rebukes Watson. Later Holmes himself visits the pub and gets into a fight with Mr.Woodley. Holmes ends up with a cut lip and Woodley has to be taken home in a cart. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Solitary Cyclist\" how had the villains Carruthers and Woodley decided which one of them was to marry the girl who was to come into the big inheritance?", "correct": "They had played cards for her.", "options": ["They had drawn lots for her.", "They had tossed a coin for her.", "They had fought a boxing match for her."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey had played cards for her.\n\n\tCarruthers had the misfortune to fall genuinely in love with Miss Violet Smith whilst Woodley was just determined to force the girl to marry him. She recognised the \"drunken brute\" that Woodley was and would have nothing to do with him. Carruthers used to follow her to and from the station in order to see that she was safe. He was the cyclist behind the solitary cyclist. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Priory School\" where was little Lord Saltire kept after he was enticed away from his school?", "correct": "In a room at the \"Fighting Cock\" inn.", "options": ["In a room at the \"Robin Hood\" inn", "In a room at Holdernesse Hall.", "In a deserted cottage near the railway line."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a room at the \"Fighting Cock\" inn.\n\n\tThe heir to the Duke of Holdernesse was told that his mother was waiting to see him. In fact he was put into the hands of Reuben Hayes, the landlord of the \"Fighting Cock\" who brutally killed the German teacher who had followed behind. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the case of \"The Priory School\" what does Holmes say is the most interesting object he has seen \"in the North\"?", "correct": "The cheque for six thousand pounds.", "options": ["The device used to disguise horses' hooves as cows' feet.", "The flagon with the hidden knife blade.", "The man-trap he comes across in the grounds of the hall."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe cheque for six thousand pounds.\n\n\tHolmes tells the Duke of Holdernesse that the device that allowed the horses' feet to be disguised is the second most interesting object. However, the cheque is very welcome to him as a \"poor man\". Watson comments that it is one of the few cases where he insists on a fee. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Black Peter\" what had Holmes been doing with the \"huge barb-headed\" spear that he brings back to Baker Street with him one morning?", "correct": "He had been trying to transfix a dead pig that swung from a hook.", "options": ["He had been trying to impale a fish on the end of it.", "He had been testing the hilt of the spear for a concealed compartment.", "He had been measuring how close to a particular window it would reach."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe had been trying to transfix a dead pig that swung from a hook.\n\n\tHolmes found it absolutely impossible to transfix the pig with a single blow. This told him that the man who had killed Captain Peter Carey must possess both extraordinary strength and exceptional skill.In the end this proves to be true of Patrick Cairns. In the struggle to overpower him Holmes needs both a pair of handcuffs and the combined efforts of Watson and Gregson. \n"}, {"text": "With which particular crime is Charles Augustus Milverton most associated in the story that bears his name?", "correct": "Blackmail.", "options": ["Murder.", "Rape.", "Forgery."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlackmail.\n\n\tHolmes asks Watson to think of \"the serpents of the Zoo\" and talks of Milverton as a \"slithery, gliding, venemous creature\". He also calls him \"the king of all the blackmailers\". However, Holmes is forced to admit that Milverton is a genius at his trade. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Charles Augustus Milverton\" which person does Holmes suggest to Lestrade might fit the description of the \"middle-sized, strongly built man - square jaw, thick neck, moustache....\"?", "correct": "Watson.", "options": ["Inspector Gregson.", "Moriarty.", "Lestrade himself."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWatson.\n\n\tBoth Holmes and Watson had been present at Milverton's house on the night on which he was killed. They were nearly caught whilst escaping and Watson was grabbed by the ankle as he went over a six-foot wall. The witness had given quite an accurate description but Lestrade thought Holmes was joking when he suggested Watson could be the man. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Six Napoleons\" which famous jewel was found inside the last bust of the Emperor to be smashed?", "correct": "The black pearl of the Borgias.", "options": ["The green emerald of the Medici.", "The blue carbuncle of the Bourbons.", "The white diamond of the Andes."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe black pearl of the Borgias.\n\n\tWhen Beppo, one of the criminals, discovered that the police were on his trail he headed for the factory where he worked. He knew he had only a few minutes to hide the pearl. He made a hole in one of the six plaster casts that were drying in the passage and covered it over with a few further touches of his fingers. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Three Students\" what was the source of the black clay that Holmes found in the room where the examination paper had been copied?", "correct": "It came from a long-jump pit.", "options": ["It came from the nearby River Isis.", "It came from the stables at the \"Dragon\" inn.", "It came from the compost heap in the lecturer's garden."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt came from a long-jump pit.\n\n\tFor Holmes the source of black clay demonstrated that the most athletic of the students, who was renowned for his long-jumping, was the most likely suspect. The spiked shoe had been left on a table and snatched up leaving a scratch that was slight on one side but which deepened in the direction of the bedroom door. The guilty student had hidden there when the lecturer returned. \n"}, {"text": "In the case of \"The Golden Pince-Nez\" where does the woman responsible for the death of Mr. Willoughby-Smith conceal herself?", "correct": "Behind the professor's book-case.", "options": ["In the attic of the professor's house.", "In the cellar of the professor's house.", "In the professor's bathroom."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBehind the professor's book-case.\n\n\tHolmes had considered the various options for hiding places in the professor's house. The two similar corridors with coconut matting had convinced him that a short-sighted person could make a mistake when running in a panic. One corridor led to the professor's bedroom. Holmes had deliberately dropped a large quantity of cigarette ash in the professor's room in order to see if there was concealed compartment behind the bookcase. Traces in the ash would show if the bookcase moved. \n"}, {"text": "In what way does Pompey help Sherlock Holmes in the case of \"The Missing Three-Quarter\"?", "correct": "He follows the carriage in which Dr. Armstrong travels.", "options": ["He helps carry the sick woman to the doctor's surgery.", "He keeps guard over the house in which Godfrey Staunton is hidden.", "He takes a vital message to the Provost of Cambridge University."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe follows the carriage in which Dr. Armstrong travels.\n\n\tPompey is a drag-hound. Holmes has been constantly unable to follow Dr. Armstrong whom he is sure will lead him to Godfrey Staunton. So Holmes squirts a syringe of aniseed over the doctor's carriage and puts Pompey on the trail. The dog leads him successfully to where he wants to go. However, he only finds a terrible tragedy and not a crime. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Missing Three-Quarter\" what was the reason for the student's disappearance?", "correct": "He had gone to be with with his sick wife.", "options": ["He had gone to visit his dying uncle.", "He had been caught cheating in a vital examination.", "He had run away to escape his debts."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe had gone to be with with his sick wife.\n\n\tThe student, Godfrey Staunton, had made a secret marriage of which his rich uncle, Lord Mount-James, would not approve.

Sherlock Holmes knows that no crime has been committed and so he agrees to keep the whole matter secret. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Abbey Grange\" the three Randalls are suspected of the robbery and the murder. How is their innocence finally established?", "correct": "They are arrested in New York one day after the crime in England.", "options": ["Two of the Randalls had been killed in a railway accident and the third was attending their funeral.", "They are found to have emigrated to Australia three months before the crime.", "They are able to provide an alibi confirmed by two clergymen."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are arrested in New York one day after the crime in England.\n\n\tInspector Hopkins had always considered the Randalls to be his chief suspects in the crime. He is most disappointed when it is demonstrated that they could not possibly have committed it. Though he works out the truth, Holmes does not present Hopkins with the solution. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Abbey Grange\" what did Holmes deduce from the fact that all the beeswing was in one of the three glasses?", "correct": "He decided that only two people had been drinking the wine.", "options": ["He decided that the bottle had been shaken after two glasses.", "He decided that none of those present had actually drunk from their glasses.", "He decided that only one person had been drinking the wine."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe decided that only two people had been drinking the wine.\n\n\tHolmes' deduction was that two people had been drinking from the two glasses and that the third had been filled from the dregs of the other two.
