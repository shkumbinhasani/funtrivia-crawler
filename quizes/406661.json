{"id": "406661", "name": "\"RuPaul's Drag Race UK\" - Series 3 Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "RuPaul's Drag Race"], "questions": [{"text": "How many queens competed in this series of the show?", "correct": "Twelve & 12", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelve & 12.\n\n\tAs with the previous series, a dozen queens from all around the UK were brought into the workroom with the aim to impress RuPaul and become the UK's next drag superstar.  Of note, this series of the show was filmed during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring a number of protocol be followed before and during the production.  Additionally, this was the first instance hosted by RuPaul in which a cisgender female contestant competed-- Victoria Scone took the honour when she walked into the workroom. \n"}, {"text": "How many lip syncs were held during the first episode of this series?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "None", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tAlthough most episodes generally only feature a Lip Sync For Your Life, RuPaul also implored the top two of the premiere episode to Lip Sync For the Win.  The queens had to introduce themselves by bringing two looks to the runway.  For the first, they provided the typical 'Queen of Your Home Town' premiere runway but for the second, they walked in a look inspired by their favourite things. Victoria Scone and Krystal Versace won the episode before singing to Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" (giving Krystal the RuPeter Badge).  The bottom two, Anubis and Elektra Fence, sung to \"Sweet Melody\" by Little Mix with Anubis being the first to go home. \n"}, {"text": "Which queen was forced to withdraw from the competition this series?", "correct": "Victoria Scone", "options": ["Veronica Green", "Vanity Milan", "Elektra Fence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictoria Scone.\n\n\tAfter an injury sustained during her lip sync for the win in episode one, Victoria Scone struggled to participate in the physically active second episode (the RuSical themed around a drag Peloton device) before it was advised she be removed from the show.  Ultimately, she was provided with an open invitation to \"Drag Race UK\" Series 4, but she would not be able to proceed in the competition this time around.  This didn't abate the proceeding elimination; preceding returnee Veronica Green was eliminated in the same episode on the back of a design challenge. \n"}, {"text": "This season's girl groups challenge involved versions of what original song?", "correct": "Big Drag Energy", "options": ["Break Up (Bye-Bye)", "UK Hon", "Phenomenon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig Drag Energy.\n\n\tRolling off the major success of the first two girl group challenges of series past, the queens of Series 3 divided out into two teams of four to take on different versions of the original track \"Big Drag Energy\".  Interestingly, this was the first time in which both teams performed different versions of the same song. Although they had to create original lyrics and choreography, one team had a more upbeat version of the song and the other had a down-tempo remix.  The latter won, granting its four teammates RuPeter Badges.  Charity Kase and Scarlett Harlett dropped to the bottom to sing \"Who Do You Think You Are\" by the Spice Girls, but both were saved. \n"}, {"text": "In a rare instance, the queens performed in their acting challenge for the 'Draglexa' home assistant system to what result?", "correct": "There were no winners", "options": ["There was a six-way Lipsync for Your Life", "The queens gained the opportunity to vote out another competitor", "Everyone received a RuPeter Badge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThere were no winners.\n\n\tIn a rare case of poor performance, RuPaul informed the queens that their job scripting and acting in a commercial for the Draglexa device dropped them all to the bottom.  After a runway themed around their most expensive drag garments, Ru sent six queens to safety and forced Charity Kase and Scarlett Harlett to go head-to-head one more time (this time to Shirley Bassey's \"Big Spender\").  Scarlett was allowed to stay while Charity Kase was told to sashay away. \n"}, {"text": "The Snatch Game episode sent home how many queens?", "correct": "Two & 2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo & 2.\n\n\tIn a surprise elimination, RuPaul decided that she didn't get enough fight from both bottom queens, Choriza May and River Medway, when they flunked during Snatch Game and failed to master the main stage with their 'Feeling Fruity' runway looks.  After both queens, in their first time in the bottom, stumbled their way through \"Shout\" by Lulu and The Luvvers (in front of Lulu herself), Ru asked both to sashay away, leaving only five shocked queens still in the running. \n"}, {"text": "The Miss Fugly Beauty Pageant featured how many categories of runway options?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["One", "Two", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThe Top Five continued into the seventh episode of the series with the instruction to create three different looks for the Miss Fugly Beauty Pageant in which they had to hit the runway looking...well...not their best.  In addition to producing refined looks, they also had to race against the clock with RuPaul informing the contestants they would have just over an hour to hit the runway in a Fugly Swimwear look, only sixty minutes to shop for items for their Charity Shop Chic looks backstage, and then produce a Fugly But Fashionable option to round out their challenge. Scarlett Harlett was sent home this time during her and Vanity Milan's third trip to the bottom two. \n"}, {"text": "This season saw the final four queens in a Roast of who of these?", "correct": "Previously eliminated contestants", "options": ["The Spice Girls", "Past winners", "Graham Norton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPreviously eliminated contestants.\n\n\tThe penultimate challenge of the series forced the top four queens to participate in a 'Pearly Gates' roast in which they had to aim their barbs not only at themselves and the rest of the top four, but the judging panel (plus Kathy Burke) and the previously eliminated contestants.  Ella Vaday won her fourth RuPeter Badge and Kitty Scott Claus was sent alongside her to the finale while both Krystal Versace and Vanity Milan performed Dua Lipa's \"Hallucinate\" for the final spot.  The former stayed to fight another day while Vanity Milan was sent home in her fourth lip sync. \n"}, {"text": "This series' RuMix song was the first in any series to fall in what genre?", "correct": "Christmas", "options": ["Spoken Word", "Country", "Rap"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristmas.\n\n\tFor the finale episode, the top three queens walked into a decorated workroom to find that they would be writing lyrics and learning choreography as part of a performance to RuPaul's new Christmas track \"Hey Sis, It's Christmas\".  Following the usual routine of having a one-on-two chat with RuPaul and Michelle, all three queens had to personalize their components and learn tricky individual and group dance steps to show off their work on the mainstage before hitting the runway in their finale drag extravaganza looks. \n"}, {"text": "Which queen was crowned the winner of \"RuPaul's Drag Race UK\" Series 3?", "correct": "Krystal Versace", "options": ["Kitty Scott-Claus", "Ella Vaday", "Vanity Milan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKrystal Versace.\n\n\tAfter ten episodes of twists and turns, Krystal Versace, who won the series' first two challenges, ended up taking the win after a performance of Dusty Springfield's \"You Don't Own Me\", earning the crown, the sceptre, the World of Wonder show in Hollywood, and the title of the UK's Next Drag Superstar, succeeding the Series 2 winner Lawrence Chaney.  Interestingly, her two runners-up (Kitty Scott-Claus and Ella Vaday) were never part of the bottom two with Kitty winning two RuPeter Badges and Ella winning four, tying Bimini Bon-Boulash's Series 2 record. \n"}]}
