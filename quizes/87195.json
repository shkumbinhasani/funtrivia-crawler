Of what nationality was the fellow who invented this scale in 1812?  \n", "correct": "German", "options": ["Swedish", "Dutch", "Russian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGerman.\n\n\tFriedrich Mohs was a German mineralogist who desired to have a measure of the level of resistance to scratching of the various minerals he studied.  His choice of minerals for each level (1-10) is somewhat arbitrary, and is certainly not linear. \n"}, {"text": "An important figure in the development of the pH scale was which Danish chemist with a fun name?  \n", "correct": "S\u00f8ren S\u00f8rensen", "options": ["Jurgen Jurgensen", "Anders Andersen", "J\u00f8hann J\u00f8hannsen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nS\u00f8ren S\u00f8rensen.\n\n\tIn 1909 S\u00f8rensen developed his scale, which measures the acidity of a solution.  At a pH of 7, the acidity is considered neutral.  High numbers like 12 and 13 represent a high level of alkalinity, while lower numbers like 2 or 3 represent a high level of acidity. \n"}, {"text": "The Mercalli scale is a lesser known measure of what important natural phenomenon?  \n", "correct": "Earthquakes", "options": ["Typhoon wind strength", "Humidity", "Lightning strike frequency"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarthquakes.\n\n\tNow called the 'Modified Mercalli Scale', it was invented by Giuseppe Mercalli in 1902 to describe the intensity of earthquakes, and is not a very scientific scale like its counterpart, the Richter scale, being qualitative rather than quantitative.  An example here...this is the 'measure' of MM VIII on the Mercalli scale:  'Everyone runs outdoors. Moderate to major damage. Minor damage to specially designed buildings. Chimneys and walls collapse.'  I think he should have added 'run for your lives' for level 12! \n"}, {"text": "Another guy with a fun name, he was an Italian inventor who developed a 'thermoscope', an early version of the thermometer, which most significantly was the first temperature related instrument to have a numerical scale applied.  What was his name?  \n", "correct": "Santorio Santorio", "options": ["Giovanni Giovanni", "Bondone di Bondone", "Capriccio di Capriccio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantorio Santorio.\n\n\tSantorio's invention of the thermoscope (which is disputed) possibly even preceded the discovery of the water thermometer by Galileo in 1593. \n"}, {"text": "Speaking of hot and cold, Anders Celsius was the Swedish inventor of a very commonly used measure of temperature, the Centigrade (or Celsius) scale.  But Celsius was not a specialist in thermodynamics, rather, he was a professor of what scientific discipline at Uppsala, Sweden?  \n", "correct": "Astronomy", "options": ["Chemistry", "Botany", "Zoology"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAstronomy.\n\n\tThough he was an esteemed member of the academic community in Sweden, and a well-respected astronomer (even having built the first observatory in Sweden), he is best known for his temperature scale that still bears his name. \n"}, {"text": "Following the theme of temperature scales, we now move on to Lord Kelvin, whose absolute scale of temperature provides us with a fairly accurate measurement of 'absolute zero'.  Kelvin is also well known for which other major scientific accomplishment?  \n", "correct": "Development of the 2nd law of thermodynamics", "options": ["Development of the 3rd law of thermodynamics", "Development of Charles' Law", "Development of Boyle's Law"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDevelopment of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.\n\n\tThe 2nd law of thermodynamics is also known as the law of conservation of energy (heat cannot flow from a colder to a warmer body). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these scientists worked alongside Charles Richter in creating the Richter scale?  \n", "correct": "Beno Gutenberg", "options": ["John Dawson", "Inge Lehmann", "Andrija Mahorovicic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeno Gutenberg.\n\n\tThe German-born Gutenberg and American-born Richter were both professors at Caltech when they co-authored various studies on seismic activity.  Together they developed the Richter scale, allowing for a very accurate determination of earthquake intensity. \n"}, {"text": "The Fujita scale is used to measure which natural phenomenon?  \n", "correct": "Tornado wind-intensity", "options": ["Tsunami volumes and heights", "Atmospheric ozone levels", "Ultra-violet indices"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTornado wind-intensity.\n\n\tThe Fujita scale was developed by T. Theodore Fujita, a University of Chicago professor, in 1971.  There are 6 levels of the F-scale, ranging from F0 (wind speeds of less than 73 mph) to F5 (wind speeds ranging from 261-318 mph).  At level F5 cars may be tossed about, houses torn down and trees uprooted...get into the cellar! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these names is attached to the scale of damage which potentially could be caused by an asteroid or comet impacting the Earth?  \n", "correct": "Torino", "options": ["Firenze", "Napoli", "Venezio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTorino.\n\n\tThis scale was developed by MIT professor Richard P. Binzel in the mid-90s and is named for a conference on potential asteroid impacts which was held in Turin, Italy in 1999.  Check out www.torinoscale.com for more details on this scary scale! \n"}, {"text": "How many points are there on the Beaufort scale for measuring wind force?  \n", "correct": "13", "options": ["12", "6", "7"], "explanation": "\n\n\n13.\n\n\tThat was a bit of a trick question, as it appears there are only 12, but the scale goes from 0-12, making 13 points!  This scale was developed by Sir Francis Beaufort, a British admiral, in 1805.  The measures go from 0 (calm) to 12 (hurricane) and lists light air, breezes, gales and storms along the way...bring a life preserver!  Thanks for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and learned a thing or two. \n"}]}
