Maybe she cared for him after all. Earlier in the song he had declared that he was in love but it was \"in vain\". In the sequel song entitled \"Felina\" we learn that she probably did love him after all. She immediately kills herself using his sixgun. His jealousy was not really necessary. \n"}, {"text": "What is the very last word of the song \"El Paso\"?", "correct": "goodbye", "options": ["Felina", "sand", "kiss"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngoodbye.\n\n\t\"in arms that I'd die for.
