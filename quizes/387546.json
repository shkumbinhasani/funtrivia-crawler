Dr. Connors ended up being the lead villain in the first in the rebooted film series \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", during which he was played by Rhys Ifans. \n"}, {"text": "Culture Club discussed a specific chameleon in a 1983 hit song by what name?", "correct": "Karma Chameleon", "options": ["Hidden Chameleon", "Killer Chameleon", "Sneaky Chameleon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKarma Chameleon.\n\n\tA song about a red, gold, and green chameleon (not typically a thing), \"Karma Chameleon\" was the exact type of nonsense song you'd expect to hear in the early 1980s, but all the more interesting was that it followed the more downtrodden single \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\", which escalated Culture Club's status to hit '80s band only a short time prior.  According to lead singer Boy George, the song was about fears of social alienation which, sure, it works, but you have to wonder how the chameleon comes and goes.  That's not really how they work.\r You might assume I don't like this song. \n"}, {"text": "Geico employed which of these reptiles as their spokesmascot in 1999?", "correct": "Gecko", "options": ["Iguana", "Skink", "Bearded Dragon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGecko.\n\n\tCreated almost serendipitously out of an actor's strike, the Geico Gecko was made in an attempt to avoid using live, human actors in advertisements.  What resulted was one of the more famous ad campaigns to rise out of turn-of-the-century media.  The Geico Gecko, who would appear in the commercials, wouldn't really tout the company in early ads, instead reflecting on the fact that people would be contacting him assuming he was an insurance company.  He wasn't.  He was a CGI gecko. \n"}, {"text": "A lizard simply named 'Liz' appeared in what children's TV show as the sidekick of Ms. Frizzle?", "correct": "The Magic School Bus", "options": ["Barney & Friends", "The Polka Dot Door", "Dora the Explorer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Magic School Bus.\n\n\tAppearing alongside Ms. Frizzle in every episode of \"The Magic School Bus\", Liz is a chameleon who, oddly, never really changes her colours despite that being a fitting idea in many different episodes of the educational program.  Additionally, Liz never talks during the show, though she's seen to be exceptionally intelligent and self-aware.  Viewers probably wouldn't be surprised to know that she had a full name: Elizabeth Savannah Frizzle. \n"}, {"text": "Often spouting comedic lines about pop culture, what video game lizard starred in a series of platformer video games in the 1990s?", "correct": "Gex", "options": ["Yooka", "Iggy", "Godzilla"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGex.\n\n\tGex the Gecko starred in \"Gex\", \"Gex: Enter the Gecko\", and \"Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko\", all of which followed the titular lizard's adventures through unique worlds and stylized movie environments to battle Emperor Rez.  It would likely come as no surprised to players that Gex was voiced by an actual stand-up comedian-- Dana Gould-- whose one-liners and zingers would make up the repetitive bulk of dialogue spread throughout the games, almost always making fun of movies and TV shows, arguably going over the heads of the games' main demographic at the time. \n"}, {"text": "Johnny Depp played the role of which of these chameleons in a 2011 Oscar-winning film?", "correct": "Rango", "options": ["Espio", "Leon", "Tonto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRango.\n\n\t\"Rango\", winner of the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, was an entirely-CGI film featuring a chameleon lost in the Mojave Desert.  Starring Depp in the lead role as a colour-changing chameleon, the movie also featured a number of other lizards including an iguana played by Isla Fisher and a gila monster played by Ray Winstone.  Bill Nighy, Abigail Breslin, and Alfred Molina also starred.  The film, which cost $135,000,000 to make (CGI costs money) ended up making $245,000,000 in the box office. \n"}, {"text": "Killer Croc would be found in the sewers of what comic book locale?", "correct": "Gotham City", "options": ["New York City", "Metropolis", "Smallville"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGotham City.\n\n\tKiller Croc is typically a Batman villain.  First seen in 1983 in \"Detective Comics\", Killer Croc is actually a man with a rare genetic condition that makes him look like a crocodile.  Over time, his appearance seems to have influenced his attitude and habits-- he seems to be cannibalistic in later appearances.  Killer Croc was one of many bad guys featured in the \"Batman: Arkham City\" video game and, later, the \"Suicide Squad\" film released in 2016 (where he was portrayed by \"LOST\" actor Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these lizard foes is a chief antagonist in the \"Donkey Kong\" video game series?", "correct": "King K. Rool", "options": ["Bowser", "Lord Ganon", "Dimitri"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKing K. Rool\n\n\tKing K. Rool always seems eager to steal the Kong Family's banana hoard even though it's quite likely that, regardless of what species K. Rool actually is (he's clearly a lizard though), he's probably not really going to be eating them.  K. Rool was never introduced as a villain in the \"Donkey Kong\" series until \"Donkey Kong Country\" first released on the SNES.  He would follow the Kongs well into their series, becoming the main villain in the award-winning N64 game \"Donkey Kong Country 64\".  He was replaced in Retro Studios' platformer reboot \"Donkey Kong Country Returns\" on the Wii. \n"}, {"text": "Lizard-like in nature, what race from Germanic folklore is available to play or fight in \"Dungeons and Dragons\" and \"Pathfinder\" role-playing games?", "correct": "Kobold", "options": ["Gnoll", "Naga", "Murloc"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKobold.\n\n\tKobolds are impish, little guys typically believed to have dragon ancestry, though this just means that they tend to be lizard-like in certain regards.  While typically seen as an enemy race known for getting in low-level trouble in role-playing games (kind of like goblins with sharper points), they have a much more interesting origin in Germanic folklore.  Kobolds of lore depict them as fiendish spirits which are, more often than not, invisible and inhabiting peoples' homes. \n"}, {"text": "The Visitors of another planet turned out to be reptilian in nature in what short-lived sci-fi TV show first airing in 1984 and 1985 and being rebooted in 2009?", "correct": "V", "options": ["Fringe", "Surface", "Threshold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nV.\n\n\tIn \"V\", a series of giant spaceships operated by a charismatic group of interstellar beings arrived on Earth and started influencing in their ways until a small group of resistance people discovered that they were, in fact, reptilian beasts bent on taking over the planet.  While not featuring actual lizards, it's not hard to see that the Visitors take on the species' more terrifying qualities, especially when their true forms are revealed.  In both cases, the \"V\" TV show never really lasted too long due to poor viewership. \n"}]}
