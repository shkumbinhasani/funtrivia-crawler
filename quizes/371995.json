{"id": "371995", "name": "Looking up at Psamathe Quiz | Our Solar System | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Our Solar System", "Moons"], "questions": [{"text": "Cressida is an inner satellite of Uranus and its name is taken from which play by William Shakespeare?\n", "correct": "Troilus and Cressida", "options": ["Romeo and Cressida", "Frixos and Cressida", "Leander and Cressida"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTroilus and Cressida.\n\n\tCressida was discovered in 1986, in images taken by Voyager 2. It has a diameter of 82 km and belongs to the Portia Group of Uranus satellites which include Bianca, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita, all names from William Shakespeare's plays.\r The story of Cressida is a very sad one. She was a Trojan woman, a daughter of the priest Calchas, who was in love with king Priam's youngest son, Troilus. When Cressida was forcibly sent to the Greeks, she was pursued by Diomedes and betrayed Troilus's love. \n"}, {"text": "The moon Galatea takes its name from a Greek sea nymph. Knowing that, which planet does it more likely orbit?", "correct": "Neptune", "options": ["Pluto", "Venus", "Earth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeptune.\n\n\tGalatea is an irregularly shaped inner moon of Neptune. It orbits the planet every 10 hours and 18 minutes in a spiral motion. This means that it will eventually impact Neptune and break up in its atmosphere or become a planetary ring.\r All the moons of Neptune are named after minor Greek and Roman sea deities. \n"}, {"text": "Himalia is the largest moon of the Himalia Group of Jupiter's satellites.\nSince its name ends in -a, it has a prograde orbit (it orbits Jupiter in the same direction as the planet orbits the Sun).\n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tHimalia was most probably formed by a large piece of an asteroid which had pieces broken off during a collision. Those pieces were captured by Jupiter's gravity and became moons which formed the Himalia Group. Himalia is an irregular satellite because it is very distant - at 11.5 million km from Jupiter, and its orbit is eccentric.\r The International Astronomical Union uses names ending in -a for the Jovian moons with a prograde orbit.\r In Greek mythology, Himalia was a nymph from Rhodes who gave birth to three sons by Zeus - Sparteus, Cromios and Cytus.\r As expected, all the moons of Jupiter with female names have the names of women associated with the god in one way or another. \n"}, {"text": "Skathi is one of Saturn's moons which does not take its name from Greek or Roman mythology. Which mythology does it take its name from?", "correct": "Norse", "options": ["Slavic", "Aztec", "Mesopotamian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorse.\n\n\tSkathi, or Skadi, was the giantess wife of the Norse god Niord who was associated with the sea and seafaring.\r The moon was discovered in 2000 by Canadian astronomers. It is very small, only 8 km in diameter, and it is thought to have been born by a piece of the moon Phoebe which separated during an impact. Skathi belongs to the Norse Group of Saturn's satellites which is a large group of retrograde satellites (their orbits are in the opposite direction of Saturn's orbit). \n"}, {"text": "The mythological Lysithea was a daughter of Oceanus and a lover of Zeus. A satellite of which planet has taken her name?", "correct": "Jupiter", "options": ["Venus", "Mars", "Uranus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJupiter.\n\n\tLysithea is one of the sixty seven moons of Jupiter and it, too, belongs to the Himalia Group, a group of four moons that constantly change their orbits because of solar and planetary magnetic disturbances. The four moons are Lysithea, Leda, Himalia, Elara and there was a fifth moon (S/2000 J11) which was a candidate for the group but it has disappeared - it most probably crashed on Himalia.\r There are three mythological Lysitheas. One is the daughter of Oceanus, another one, who is also known as Semele, was the daughter of Cadmus and the mother of Dionysus and the last one was the daughter of Helenus. All three gave birth to children fathered by Zeus. \n"}, {"text": "Pallene is one of the three natural satellites, called Alkyonides, which are found between the orbits of larger moons Mimas and Enceladus. Which planet do they all orbit? ", "correct": "Saturn", "options": ["Uranus ", "Mercury ", "Mars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaturn.\n\n\tMethone, Anthe and Pallene are the Alkyonides, a group of Saturn's satellites which was discovered in 2004 during the Cassini-Huygens mission. All three have dust rings but Pallene's is the most complete one, it is called the Pallene Ring and mainly consists of material which escaped from Pallene.\r The name comes from one of the seven Alkyonides, daughters of the Titan Alkyoneus. Heracles killed their father and the daughters threw themselves in the sea where Poseidon's wife Amphitrite turned them into halcyons (kingfishers). \n"}, {"text": "This satellite of Uranus was first discovered in 1999, in pictures taken by Voyager 2. It was demoted in 2001 only to be finally confirmed as a satellite in 2003 from pictures taken by Hubble Space Telescope. It was named after which female character, whose name means \"lost\" in Latin, from Shakespeare's \"The Winter's Tale\"?\n", "correct": "Perdita", "options": ["Rhea ", "Dione", "Phoebe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPerdita.\n\n\tIn 1999, University of Arizona astronomer Erich Karkoschka was studying archived photographs taken by Voyager 2 in 1986, when he discovered a new moon of Saturn. In later observations, the moon seemed to have disappeared and it wasn't until 2003 that the Hubble telescope detected an object in Perdita's original location.\r The name came from the lost daughter of the king and queen of Sicily, Perdita, who lived in Bohemia, unaware of her royal blood. \n"}, {"text": "Psamathe is a small outer satellite of Neptune that is so distant from the planet, its orbit takes 26 Earth years to complete. According to NASA, how big is its diameter?\n", "correct": "40 kilometers", "options": ["84 kilometers ", "599 kilometers ", "210 kilometers "], "explanation": "\n\n\n40 kilometers.\n\n\tPsamathe, Laomedeia, Neso, Halimede and Sao were the last five outer moons of Neptune to be discovered, in 2002 and 2003. Psamathe and Neso are more distant from their planet than any other moon in our solar system. Psamathe is found at 46,700,000 km (29,018,034 miles) from Neptune.\r Psamathe was a Nereid, a sea nymph, and one of the fifty daughters of Nereus and Doris. She was the goddess of sand beaches. \n"}, {"text": "Telesto is a tiny moon in the complex system of Saturn's natural satellites. In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft photographed Telesto's surface and discovered that it was heavily scarred with impact craters. \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tTelesto's photograph depicts it like a very smooth, rounded piece of ice.  Telesto is a Trojan moon because it orbits both Saturn and another, larger, moon of Saturn, Tethys. Telesto and Calypso are Trojan moons of Tethys and Helene and Polydeuces are Trojan moons of the satellite Dione. Saturn is the only planet with Trojan moons.\r Telesto was a sea goddess, one of the three thousand daughters of Titans Oceanus and Tethys, called Oceanides. They personified spirits and blessings, like clouds, springs, fame, wealth, good fortune. Telesto was the goddess of success. \n"}, {"text": "Mond, masina, hold, selene, inyanga, candra are names of this lonely moon in different languages. It is lonely because it is an only child of the planet it orbits. Which moon is it?", "correct": "The Moon (Earth)", "options": ["Phobos (Mars)", "Haumea (Venus)", "Nix (Pluto)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Moon (Earth).\n\n\tThe Moon is the closest celestial body to Earth, the brightest in the night sky and the only one man has set foot on, other than Earth, by 2014. Its orbit is totally synchronized with Earth's, so we always see the same face. It orbits Earth and rotates on its axis in 27.3 Earth days and has a heavily scarred surface because of impacts with asteroids. Since the atmosphere of the Moon is so thin, and there are no weather conditions, the craters have remained unchanged over time.\r The Moon and the Sun have been the most influential celestial bodies in every human mythology. They are usually either brother and sister or husband and wife. The Sun is usually associated with light, life and the divine and the Moon with magic and the occult. There are countless lunar deities - to name just a few, there's the Greco-Roman Hecate, the Japanese Tsukuyomi, the Yoruba Yemaya and the Polynesian Hina. \n"}]}
