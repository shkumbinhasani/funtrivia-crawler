What color did they become by the 1950s?", "correct": "Green or blue", "options": ["Red", "Orange", "Gray"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen or blue.\n\n\tInitially, surgeons did not wear anything but their clothes and a butcher's apron and operated with bare hands in open amphitheatres with people watching the procedure while they were coughing, sneezing, even smoking. The 1918 flu pandemic and new research on sterilization methods brought the white scrubs, caps and thick rubber gloves.By the middle of the 20th century, researchers had observed that the white color caused headaches, dizziness and eye strain because of the contrast with the red blood on the operating table. Green was chosen as the opposite (complementary) of red on the color wheel.It was found to refresh the surgeon's sight from the red inner parts of a body and, also, to eliminate the green flashes the brain \"sees\" when looking at a white surface after staring at red for a long time. Nowadays, surgeon's scrubs can be a rainbow of colors but green is still considered the best choice. \n"}, {"text": "In 2001, a poll conducted among astronomers from Johns Hopkins University decided on the name of the average color of the universe.

The first blue pigment came from mining lapis lazuli which came from Afghanistan and Iran and it was used together with gold to decorate the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs. Its scarcity associated it with royalty and divinity and when, in 431 AD, the Catholic church decided to \"color code\" the saints, \"Mary was given a blue robe, a dark, wonderful and expensive blue, befitting the queen of heaven.\" \rOvertime, blue became the color of authority and trustworthiness and that explains police uniforms, the United Nations blue and bankers' suits. \n"}, {"text": "Salif Keita is a famous Malian musician and a prince, a direct descentant of the 13th-century founder of the Mali Empire, Sundiata Keita.
