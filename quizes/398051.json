They fight against one another in the training hall and Vers is urged to keep her emotions in check as they can be a distraction.  The two also talk about the Supreme Intelligence, the sacred being that connects them all. Vers is brought before it that very day and in its chambers she communes with it for the first time.  The Supreme Intelligence takes the form of an older woman from her past, but Vers can't remember her life from several years back.  She does know, however, that she is being trained despite it, partly since she can let go of the emotions that would have tied her to those memories. She will fight for all Kree and, fortunately, it's what she wants.  Because of this, she's given a mission.  Joining her mentor, Yon-Rogg, she will head out to fight the Skrull and retrieve an embedded Kree spy on the planet of Torfa. \n"}, {"text": "Vers crash lands on Planet C-53.  It's also known by what name?", "correct": "Earth", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarth.\n\n\tSplashing down on Torfa, Vers and the others track the beacon onto land and search through the sand and fog for their target, but the extraction goes poorly due to severe communication issues.  The Skrull forces manage to cloak themselves to trick the team, but this is picked up on fairly quickly and it results in a fight.  Vers, who finds the target, is shocked into submission and jolted into unconsciousness.\rShe has a dream that she's a United States Air Force pilot on Earth.  As she loads into the cockpit, her dream goes even further back to a go-karting accident she sustained as a child.  Her memories take her back to basic training and to bar fights and her past as a young girl.  One particular memory, where she spoke with Dr. Wendy Larson, allows the Skrull forces to locate her whereabouts before she was brought to Hala.\rIt turns out that Vers is only being used to locate Dr. Larson.  When she awakens in the Skrull lab she fights her way out, blasting a hole in the side of their ship before hijacking an escape vessel and hurtling to the surface of the planet below - C-53, the Terran Homeworld.  Earth. \n"}, {"text": "The Skrulls seek which of these from Project Pegasus?", "correct": "Lightspeed technology", "options": ["The Infinity Stones", "Clocking technology", "Vibranium deposits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLightspeed technology.\n\n\tWhen Vers crash lands onto Planet C-53, she's tossed from her escape pod and thrown through the roof of a Blockbuster Video.  She gets to her feet and tries to contract the Kree, but she finds that she has no signal and no clue as to where she is.  The Skrull forces, having evacuated their ship as well, crash land in the Pacific Ocean.\rBy morning, Vers is able to contact Yon-Rogg and the others and it's at that time she states her plan to locate Dr. Lawson to prevent the Skrulls from grabbing her lightspeed technology.  Her back-up won't be able to extract her from C-53 for another 22 hours.\rA security car calls in the police and, soon, Vers is approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson.  They chat for a bit, but a Skrull locates the three of them and a chase commences. \n"}, {"text": "The Skrulls are able to do which of the following?", "correct": "Mimic other beings", "options": ["Breathe in space", "Communicate telepathically", "Read and speak in any language"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMimic other beings.\n\n\tVers chases the Skrull onto a Los Angeles train car and identifies them amongst the passengers.  The fight brings them into the tunnels and to a station where, unfortunately, she loses the target.  Topside, Nick Fury drives after her only to discover that his passenger, who he thought was Coulson, was actually a Skrull in disguise.  Later, when Fury brings the Skrull in for an official autopsy, he doesn't realize that his own boss is being impersonated.\rVers finds a crystal after the Skrull drops it on the subway and after inserting it into her suit she comes up with one of her memories.  It ultimately leads her to start a bit of research into a place called Pancho's Bar, and with a computer connected to the internet, she's able to dig deeper.  She steals an outfit and a motorcycle and heads out to Pancho's herself to seek answers.  And she finds that she has memories of it. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the 'cat' who first appears at the Pegasus base?", "correct": "Goose", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoose.\n\n\tAt Pancho's Bar, Vers gets closer to locating Dr. Lawson when she finds a picture of a plane with the Pegasus logo on it, knowing it from her memories.  She asks about it, but Nick Fury emerges to inform her that she's looking into classified information.  The two have a quick chat to disprove that each other is a Skrull before they head out in pursuit of Pegasus together. The trip takes them directly to the facility and Fury uses his credentials to gain access.  They sneak their way down to the records room and, en route, encounter an orange cat by the name of Goose.  Fury takes notice of him, but Vers doesn't; she blasts into the records room instead. And inside, they find all the info they need on Lawson.  Vers finds that Lawson's notes were written in Kree, but Fury learns of Lawson's apparent death after a test flight with the lightspeed engine a six years earlier.  The prototype was destroyed with it and the project was terminated.  Another pilot went down with her and a pilot named Maria Rambeau was the last one to see them both alive, so that ends up being their next lead. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Lawson, as it's discovered, is actually of which race?", "correct": "Kree", "options": ["Skrull", "Human", "Asgardian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKree.\n\n\tAs Vers searches the files she gets suspicious.  Looking through photos she sees none other than herself in the background of one of them.  She later phones back to Yon-Rogg and finds out that Lawson was, in fact, an undercover Kree operative by the name of Mar-Vell who was planted on Earth to work on a unique energy core that could help them win the war.  She expresses that she likely had a life on Earth.\rAt the same time, Fury sets off to rendezvous with his boss, Keller, but he very quickly discovers that the man likely isn't who he claims to be; he's actually a Skrull.  The realization culminates in a fight in the records room and Vers has to jump in to fight Keller off.  They only make it out with the help of Coulson who, in an act of defiance, lies to his colleagues about the duo's whereabouts.\rVers and Fury are able to escape by jumping into the cockpit of a cargo jet and blasting into the air.  Somehow, Goose manages to stow away in the plane.  They head off to find Maria Rambeau in Louisiana. \n"}, {"text": "Who finds Vers in Louisiana while she's seeking out an old friend?", "correct": "Talos", "options": ["Ronan", "Yon-Rogg", "Coulson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTalos.\n\n\tFlying to C-53, Yon-Rogg contacts Officer Ronan regarding their mission.  Ronan suggests they bomb the Skrulls, but Yon-Rogg suggests that they've been lost and they're still searching, if only to give Vers a bit more time.\rVers, meanwhile, arrives in Louisiana with Fury and unknowingly reunites with Maria Rambeau and her daughter, Monica, who knew her from six years earlier when Vers was actually Carol Danvers.  Maria reminds Carol of the truth - Lawson was working to \"save lives\", as she put it, and Carol tried to be a hero.  Carol used to live with Maria and Monica; they were like family and they have pictures to prove it all.\rThere ends up being a knock at the door - a neighbour - but it ends up being the distraction that Talos, the Skrull commander, needs to sneak in the back door of Maria's house and ask the group for a moment of their time.  Things, he claims, aren't as black and white as Vers believes.  He asks Vers for her attention; he'll play the recording from Carol's black box and convince her to help him.\rAs they go to listen, Talos is spooked by Goose, the cat, but he specifically refers to Goose as something else entirely: a Flerkin. \n"}, {"text": "From which of these was the name 'Vers' taken?", "correct": "A dog tag", "options": ["An old Kree legend", "A birth certificate", "A billboard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA dog tag.\n\n\tTalos plays back the black box footage from Carol's accident and it evokes a strong memory.  In this, Carol recalled flying the lightspeed aircraft through the atmosphere with Lawson in the back.  As they were chased by the enemy forces on the way to Lawson's mysterious, flying lab, they were shot down, crashing on a beach.  Lawson, bleeding blue, died there on the beach.  In her final moments, Lawson bled blue and revealed that she was an extraterrestrial being named Mar-Vell from the Planet Hala.  As she aimed her gun to attempt to destroy her craft and prevent the enemy from taking the technology, she was killed from a blast from down the beach, leaving Carol to finish the job.  The one who emerged from down the beach was Yon-Rogg, and to stop him, Carol fired Lawson's gun at the plane's energy core, destroying it, but blasting herself with the photon energy inside.  It empowered her and imbued her with immense energy, but caused her to sustain severe amnesia.  All that Yon-Rogg found with her body was the back half of her dog tags - VERS.  Rambeau kept the other half as it was all that remained from the explosion.\rRemembering the truth, Carol copes with the lies told to her.  Talos tries to help her understand - Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell because she realized she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.  The Skrulls were refugees, not terrorists, and the Kree convinced her otherwise.  Lawson's labs were a shelter, and if Carol can help them find the core therein, they can save the true victims, hiding them from the Kree once and for all.  Convinced of the truth, Carol decides to help; they can follow Lawson's coordinates into orbit around Earth.  She asks Rambeau to join and, though her friend is initially hesitant, she opts to follow.\rYon-Rogg arrives on C-53, but just too late.  He quickly discovers that Vers knows the truth of her origin and the pursuit continues. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is used to power Mar-Vell's lab?", "correct": "The Tesseract", "options": ["The Soul Stone", "The Power Stone", "The Time Stone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Tesseract.\n\n\tCarol, Maria, Fury, and Talos (and Goose!) head into the atmosphere in a modified vessel and follow the coordinates up to Lawson's cloaked lab in a Kree imperial cruiser.  They head inside to find a spotless ship and, in the command room they find the ship's core, something which, in Lawson's notes, she called The Tesseract.  Carol stows it away in a Fonz lunchbox.  It's then that Talos calls the Skrulls out of hiding; many of them (Talos' family) emerge from the corridors of the ship having been hidden away by Lawson six years earlier to evade Kree capture.\rThat's when Yon-Rogg and the Kree Starforce arrive to take the prisoners and subdue the rogue Danvers.  Yon-Rogg uses his abilities to bring Carol down and connect her to the Supreme Intelligence to reason with her.  The Supreme Intelligence assures her that there's not much she can do, especially since the Kree have control over her powers, but Carol lashes out and remembers her emotions and humanity.  She fights against the Supreme Intelligence's abilities and, harnessing the power within, she inadvertently causes the power in the lab to wane, freeing the Skrulls and allowing them to fight back against Yon-Rogg's men.  The empowerment allows her to break the device placed on her to reach her full potential.  She leaves containment and hands the Tesseract over to Fury who, initially, refuses it.  Goose, however, revealed to actually be a Flerkin, swallows the Tesseract whole. \n"}, {"text": "Upon departing, Carol gives Fury which of these?", "correct": "A pager", "options": ["A book", "An iPhone", "Her jacket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pager.\n\n\tWhile Maria and Fury escape with Goose's Flerkin abilities, Carol battles Yon-Rogg and the others in the control room with relative ease.  Yon-Rogg ends up being the last man left standing but when he realizes that the Tesseract has been taken, he leaves to pursue the Skrulls.  Fury and Rambeau manage to fly their ship out of the lab though, getting away with Goose.  The Kree follow behind in their bombers and Marvel latches on to Yon-Rogg's craft as she descends to Earth.  Fortunately Maria, an ace pilot, is able to maneuver her ship to the surface while Carol takes care of her former mentor, grounding him.\rIn orbit, Officer Ronan finally reaches C-53 and deploys ballistic warheads to destroy the planet.  He's not prepared, though, for Carol, who launches the warheads back up into the atmosphere and destroys them.  She single-handedly wipes out the enemy fleet in space and Ronan retreats to Hala, suggesting he'll be back for Carol another time.\rCarol lands to encounter Yon-Rogg at his crash site but the two of them don't fight.  Yon-Rogg suggests he's proud of her for what she's done but knows that they need to fight.  She knocks him down with a single photon blast.  Instead of battling, she drags him back to his ship and sends him back to Hala with a message: she's heading back to Hala when she's done on Earth to end everything - the war and the lies.\rStill in flight, Fury tries to play nice with Goose, but the Flerkin scratches his eye.  He needs to wear a patch from then on.\rThat evening, over dinner, Carol tells Talos she'll finish Mar-Vell's job and find the Skrulls a home.  She'll be back with Maria and Monica before they know it.  Carol asks Fury to keep the Tesseract on Earth - hidden.  She hands him back his pager, modified, and suggests that she'll come back if there's ever an emergency.\rFury, returning to S.H.I.E.L.D., worries about his eye and looks for a replacement.  Coulson informs him that no one has located the Tesseract and they consider some sort of Protector Initiative.  They need more heroes.  Thinking on it, her renames it 'The Avenger Initiative'. \n"}]}
