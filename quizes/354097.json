She blames her stress on the weather and Dr. Thredson asks her to stop using corporal punishment.  She says that she is compassionate-- she asked another institution for their movie projector as a way to entertain the inmates during the upcoming storm.

When Lana comes in, Dr. Arden requests Kit's presence.\rSister Mary Eunice rushes into Sister Jude's office with a decanter of wine from the chapel and she says that someone has been imbibing.  When she requests that Sister Jude try some to see if it's been tampered with, she remembers that she no longer drinks after swearing it off in 1949.  Instead, she drinks it herself and indulges in the taste.  It is then that Sister Jude notices that Siter Mary Eunice is wearing red lipstick-- Ravish Me Red.  She claims that it's actually from Dr. Arden...and it's for Sister Jude.\rDr. Arden ties Kit up on the operating table and reintroduces him to the metal spider from his neck.

He accepts this and brings her to the corner but he says he can not assess her condition as he's legally only allowed to speak with Kit.  She says that she knows he's not one of 'them'; she needs to get a note to Wendy and she knows that Sister Jude is keeping her away.  She hands over the note and he agrees to give it over because he can go behind Sister Jude's back in doing so.\rIn the kitchen, Shelley asks Grace about the possibility of an escape and suggests that she may know another way out-- if she helps or not she'll end up getting free and going to Paris, her dream.\rSister Jude finds Dr. Arden in his office and finds that he's being prudent about the storm and staying the night.

When she receives a phone call, she picks up the receiver and hears the voice of a young girl.  Jude says she's sorry before hanging up.  It's then that she sees a pair of broken glasses on her desk.  She puts them aside and reaches for the decanter of wine left behind by Sister Mary.  She finishes it in one sitting and heads to the common room.\rWhen Sister Jude arrives, she blows her whistle and hears the news that the Mexican is missing.  Then, she struggles to make her way down the middle aisle to introduce the movie.  Clearly drunk, she has problems speaking; she notes the plot and cast of the film, \"The Sign of the Cross\" before mumbling about her own cryptic anxieties.  The lights go down and she heads off to find the Mexican while Sister Mary walks in front of the camera, takes a front row seat, and watches the movie. \n"}, {"text": "When Dr. Thredson checked in on Wendy, all he found was her body.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDuring the movie, Lana asks Dr. Thredson about Wendy.  He says that he stopped by.  The door was unlocked, so he went inside.  He didn't find anyone home, but he did find a spot of blood on the carpet.  He says he's afraid something may have happened-- perhaps she's another victim of bloody Face.  He tried to tell the cops that they may have gotten the wrong man, but they wouldn't entertain the idea.\rGrace heads to the restroom and both Kit and Shelley follow close behind.  During one scene of the film, Lana excuses herself as well.

They allow her to come along when Kit believes that she's sorry and that he's not a killer.  Before they can leave, however, one of the guards starts walking by.  Shelley offers to distract him by seducing him under the condition that they wait for her. If she doesn't show, then Lana has to write a huge piece to save them all.  The seduction is a success.  She leads him to the hydrotherapy room and ends up knocking him out on a pipe, but when she tries to return to the door to the death chute she comes across an already-angry Dr. Arden who stops her in her tracks. The others have no choice but to continue on. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first discover that the inmates haven't returned from the washroom?", "correct": "Dr. Thredson", "options": ["Sister Jude", "Sister Mary Eunice", "Spivey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Thredson\n\n\tKit, Lana, and Grace rush down through the death chute and emerge in the the storm, finally free.  Grace embraces Kit but tells Lana that when they get to the road, they split off from her.  \rDr. Thredson alerts the guard to the fact that the others haven't returned from the washroom (while Pepper heads out to the same spot).  He, in turn, tells Sister Mary Eunice of the dilemma though it's clear that she's more interested in watching the Christians get eaten onscreen.  She heads out anyways, making her way in front of the camera.\rDr. Arden brings Shelley into his lab and starts undressing.  He tells her to turn around as he attacks her against her will.  When she turns around she starts to laugh at him. He obviously takes offense to this, but instead of quieting her down by normal means, he knocks her unconscious, hitting her in the face with a heavy object. \n"}, {"text": "How does Dr. Arden punish Shelley?", "correct": "By amputating her legs", "options": ["By amputating her hands", "By severing her spine", "By giving her a lobotomy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy amputating her legs.\n\n\tLana, Kit, and Grace continue through the woods until Lana steps on something odd.

They run into another before returning to the safety of the tunnel.  They don't feel safe until they're behind locked doors.\rSister Mary Eunice awakens Sister Jude from her bed to inform her of the missing inmates.  When Sister Jude heads to the common room she turns the movie off and says that this experiment was a failure-- they'd never have a movie night again because of the three missing people.  When she looks around, Kit, Grace, and Lana are in their seats.  She naturally assumes that Shelley, Pepper (who was in the bathroom) and the Mexican are to blame and that they'll never make it out of the woods.\rShelley finds herself strapped into Dr. Arden's stretcher.  He says that because she tried to escape, he had to clip her wings, and with Sister Jude and the others thinking that she masterminded an escape, they're looking in the wrong places for her.  When he pulls back her sheets, he reveals that he's surgically amputated her legs. \n"}]}
