Average [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "PL: 'Party Line', where the party never ends.  How can I make your party special?\nCaller: Hey, Party Line?\nPL: Yes.\nCaller: I need a male deer.\nPL: Oh?\n\nSuffice to say, we don't usually send out animals.  What kind of party is this caller likely preparing for?", "correct": "Stag Party", "options": ["Doe Party", "Ram Party", "Fawn Party"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStag Party.\n\n\tIn many countries, a Stag Party is another name for a Bachelor Party, the supposed 'last night of bachelorhood' before a man gets married.  They don't usually have an actual stag.  As per tradition, this type of party is organized and maintained by the groomsmen and the best man, all of whom also have integral roles in the wedding proceedings.  Unsurprisingly, a lot of men tend to go to (ahem) exotic dancing clubs.  If you've seen the 2010 movie \"The Hangover\", that's sort of the dangerous, negative spin of a bachelor party.  Most people don't end up losing teeth or finding a tiger in their hotel bathroom...or losing the groom.\r PL: Your stag is on its way sir.  We actually have a deal right now where if you order a stag you get a dancer in a large cake, half-off.\rCaller: A female dancer?\rPL: Just someone to fawn over.\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}, {"text": "PL: 'Party Line', where you can party all night and never get tired.  How can I put the cherry on your party cake?\nCaller: I need...like...hundreds of screwdrivers.\nPL: May I ask why?\nCaller: I need something to go with all of these Rusty Nails.\n\nWhat kind of party am I likely delivering these to?", "correct": "Cocktail Party", "options": ["Housewarming Party", "Tool Party", "Hardware Party"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCocktail Party.\n\n\tThe caller is clearly asking for cocktails (to go with his cocktails, no less).  The Screwdriver is a basic drink- it's vodka and orange juice on ice (in a highball glass).  The Rusty Nail is whiskey and drambuie with ice (in a martini glass).  These drinks typically do not go well together.  You may also consider anti-nausea medication...but not while you're drinking them.  Cocktail parties are ideal for women trying to wear cocktail dresses and for people of all genders who enjoy anecdotes and random conversation; they're just casual get-togethers involving drinks and banter.  They've been termed as such since the 1920s.\r PL: Hey, if I send some Galliano and a hammer, you could have a Harvey Wallbanger!\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}, {"text": "PL: 'Party Line'.  I make all your party dreams come true.\nCaller: Hi 'Party Line'.  I need a question for my party guests.  We're having a tea party.\nPL: I'd love to help.  Why don't you try...\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\"\n\nWho is likely invited to this tea party?", "correct": "Alice", "options": ["Edgar Allan Poe", "The British-run City of Boston", "Sarah Palin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlice.\n\n\tI wouldn't be surprised if the caller were the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, both characters from \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", a Lewis Carroll children's story from 1865 (which later became a Disney adaptation).  During the seventh chapter of the story, Alice comes upon a tea party hosted by nonsensical characters and she is asked the confusing question: \"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\"  No answer is given; no answer needs to be.  The city of Boston had their own tea party in 1773 and Palin had hers in 2009.  Poe couldn't drink tea (at least, I assume...but I could be lying about that).\r Caller: Thank you so much- this should puzzle literature enthusiasts for centuries!\rPL: And a very merry unbirthday to you too.\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}, {"text": "PL: This is 'P-P-P-Party Line', rock on party-goers!  What can I do ya for?\nCaller: I need a \"Banquet\" as soon as possible!\nPL: Sure!  I'll send it by \"Helicopter\".\n\nWhat party is likely responsible for my reply?", "correct": "Bloc Party", "options": ["Quiet Riot", "The Tea Party", "S Club Party"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBloc Party.\n\n\tBoth \"Banquet\" and \"Helicopter\" are singles off of British band Bloc Party's debut album, \"Silent Alarm\", which was a major independent release in 2004 in the way of indie rock.  Reaching number seven on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart, it also showed on two other Billboard listings and peaked at number three on the UK albums chart.  \"So Here We Are\" was the top single from the album in the UK while \"Helicopter\" was a dance hit in the US.  \"Silent Alarm\" was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and while it didn't win that award, it took home several others.\r Caller: Thank you so much.  You can send them to-\rPL: \"Mercury\"?\rCaller: [Silence]\rPL: In retrograde?\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}, {"text": "PL: You've reached 'Party Line' and I'm here to pump up the volume.  How can I help?\nCaller: We need more ethernet cables.\nPL: You'll have to go AFK to get them.\n\nIf the caller is having a LAN Party, what are they likely doing with these ethernet cables?", "correct": "Connecting them so that many people can play games on the same internet network", "options": ["Hanging a pinata full of computer chips from the ceiling", "Plugging them into phone jacks to power up their dial-up internet speeds", "Wiring them into their DJ decks and stereo system for clearer sound and heavier bass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConnecting them so that many people can play games on the same internet network.\n\n\tLAN stands for Local Area Network, so people enjoying a party of this type are likely online gamers.  While some games like \"World of Warcraft\" don't really use this type of setup thanks to an online server that connects thousands at the same time, older titles like \"Counter-Strike\", \"Starcraft\", and \"Diablo II\" may have benefited from such a connection.  While many online games can only support a handful of players at the same time and some routers/modems are only built for a maximum of about four to six people, huge LAN parties are held worldwide and consist of thousands of people playing the same games in competitions.\r Caller: Everything seems to be up and running.\rPL: LOL, BRB, C YA, TTYL!\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}, {"text": "PL: Welcome to 'Party Line', lining up parties, aiming, and firing with deliveries.  Whaddaya need?\nCaller: Bed linens.\nPL: Bed linens?\nCaller: We're doing a toga thing.\n\nThe guests at this party are likely trying to imitate which ancient culture?", "correct": "Roman", "options": ["Chinese", "Greek", "Egyptian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoman.\n\n\tWhile other ancient civilizations may have had outfits similar to the toga, the Romans were the first to fashion garments specifically under this name and style.  Although normal Italians won't make a point of wearing these on a regular basis in a contemporary setting, you can still find them at fraternity houses across the world.  The toga party was made popular in the 1978 John Landis film \"Animal House\" and has persisted as a cliche frat theme for decades since.  To make a homemade toga, most people use a white bed sheet or a tablecloth.  In ancient times, it was a strictly male garment.\r Caller: Thanks for all your help, dude.\rPL: Not a problem; toga-ether we solved the problem.\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}, {"text": "PL: 'Party Line', and all I really wanna is a zig-a-zag-ah!\nCaller: I need some help.  I can't seem to get my hands on a Hoover.\nPL: What for?\nCaller: Nothing important.  If you're all out, I can settle for a Bush.\n\nWhat party is the caller likely forming?", "correct": "A Republican Party", "options": ["A Labour Party", "A Democratic Party", "A Progressive-Conservative Party"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Republican Party.\n\n\tSee, we could round up our Hoover, our Bushes, a Coolidge, a Taft, and even a Reagan, and we'd still be far from done the party!  The Republican Party was founded in the United States in the 1850s and Lincoln was the first President under this then-new group.  Since, there have been over a dozen Republican Presidents.  We could also send an elephant their way, just for the party, and free American flags.  It'd be a patriotic party for the ages.\r Caller: On second thought, you might want to keep the Bush.\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}, {"text": "PL: 'Party Line', your connection to a selection of true confection.  What do you need?\nCaller: It's not for me; it's for my daughter- she's becoming a woman.\nPL: What does she need, then?\nCaller: Birthday candles...and a tiara...and a dance hall...and a large cake...and hundreds of invitations.  It should be just like that MTV TV show.\n\nHow many birthday candles am I likely to need to send out?", "correct": "Sixteen", "options": ["Twenty", "Twelve", "Eight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSixteen.\n\n\tBetween 2005 and 2008, MTV produced a show called \"My Super Sweet 16\" in which girls turning sixteen were treated to lavish, expensive parties by rich relatives.  Unsurprisingly, this took a lot of flack from the media who claimed that the show encouraged negative values.  These people obviously had never heard of MTV before.  In 1984, John Hughes' \"Sixteen Candles\" also explored coming-of-age in film; it has since become one of his most famous films.  The sweet sixteen is usually focused on girls as opposed to boys.\r PL: Should I just send a kitchen sink?\rCaller: That would be great!\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}, {"text": "PL: 'Party Line', dishing out 100% party goodness for decades!\nCaller: I need a number of things for my party.\nPL: Well, fire away.\nCaller: Tickets to \"Star Wars: Episode 1\", Britney Spears albums, and a protected computer.\n\nIt's likely that this caller wants to party like it's which year?", "correct": "1999", "options": ["2012", "1985", "2001"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1999.\n\n\tTo be fair, if the caller really wanted to party like it were 1999, he'd get Napster and illegally download his Britney Spears track.  \"1999\" was a song by Prince originally performed in 1982.  Known as one of his most famous party songs, it reached number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in the US.  It only reached number twelve on the Hot 100 and it peaked at number twenty-five in the UK.  Unsurprisingly, the song was re-released at the turn of the century in 1999 reaching number ten in the UK.  In 1999, Britney Spears released her first album (\"Baby One More Time\") and the first \"Star Wars\" prequel broke box office records on Memorial Day weekend.  At the same time, people feared the Y2K Bug and bought new computers which wouldn't crash/kill other people when the time came for the big 2K.\r PL: Thank you for calling the Hotline Formerly Known as 'Party Line'.\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}, {"text": "PL: This is 'Party Line'.  You call, you party, we do the dirty work.\nCaller: 'Party Line', I need a jack.\nPL: Car troubles?  Call a tow truck.\nCaller: Nah, I'm stuck at my computer and I've got a bad hand.\n\nThe caller is probably just playing a game from what multi-million dollar company?", "correct": "PartyPoker", "options": ["PartyCraps", "PartyBlackjack", "PartySnooker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPartyPoker.\n\n\tPartyPoker became the Internet's largest online gambling website in the 2000s taking in millions from online gamers.  Owned by Bwin.Party International, it was founded in 2001 and hit its stride during a poker boom at the turn of the century.  In 2010 alone, it took in over 300,000,000 from unlucky participants and became the largest online business in the stock market.  The site also has ties to the World Poker Tour and takes in millions of different players every year.\r Caller: I don't know how I can thank you for your services!  You're a great guy.\rPL: I don't know what to say- I'm flush.\rCALL TERMINATED \n"}]}
