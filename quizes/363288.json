They were not found until the 1920s during a dig near Beijing, China. In November of 1941, in the middle of World War II, the Chinese decided to send these priceless remains to the U.S. until the end of the war.The fossils vanished while being transported to the Chinese port of Qinhuangdao. Their fate remains unknown, but many scholars believe that they were on the Awa Maru, a Japanese ocean liner that was sunk the same year.

When Hitler's army invaded the castle in 1941, they dismantled the jeweled room, packed the contents up into crates and shipped the whole thing to Kalingrad. After the war, the Germans claimed the components of the Amber Room had been stored in a castle which had burnt down during the war.  A Soviet investigator found some charred fragments at the castle's remains that appeared to have been part of the Amber Room. \r Some scholars doubt this story, believing instead that this treasure is lying on the bottom of the Baltic Sea along with the torpedoed steamer on which it had been stashed. Others believe it was hidden in an abandoned mine in Thuringia. It should be noted that both a small mosaic and an inlaid chest from the room have been recovered in the following decades and were turned over to the Russian government in a gesture of good faith. So just where is the mysterious Amber Room? Is it gone forever? Will we ever know? \n"}, {"text": "Off of the coast of which American state is the treasure ship \"Santa Maria Del Camino\" believed to lie, waiting to be discovered?", "correct": "Florida", "options": ["California", "Michigan", "Maine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlorida.\n\n\tIn 1555, the Santa Maria Del Camino set sail for Panama in order to pick up a  large treasure from South America.

For over 200 years speculators have been digging out this unusual hole and its many layers of logs and stones, only to have the hole flood with sea water.Most of these people believe that Captain Kidd or Blackbeard buried large amounts of gold at this location, and this supposition is hard to prove or disprove.

Two of the most valuable artifacts were two life-size solid gold statues of the Madonna holding the baby Jesus. \r The treasure was put on a ship bound for Mexico. When the crew learned of the treasures aboard, they decided to kill the accompanying guards and priests and set sail for the Cocos Islands where they presumably buried it, with plans to recover it after the situation calmed down. After burying the treasure the ship was captured and the crew was tried and convicted of piracy. Thousands have combed the Cocos Islands in the years since looking for this treasure.
