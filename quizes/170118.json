{"id": "170118", "name": "The Film History of Michael Keaton Trivia Game | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed E-K", "K - People Themed"], "questions": [{"text": "Keaton exploded onto the Hollywood scene with his role as Bill Blazejowski in the cute 1982 comedy 'Night Shift'.  This also happened to be the film that put which popular Hollywood director on the map?", "correct": "Ron Howard", "options": ["John Hughes", "Rob Reiner", "Ivan Reitman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRon Howard.\n\n\tThough it wasn't the debut performance for Keaton as an actor or Howard as a director, it was the first film of genuine note for both individuals.  The film also featured Howard's co-star from 'Happy Days', Henry Winkler, and a rising star of television, Shelley Long.  The film did mark the big screen debut of two other Hollywood notables...Shannen Doherty and Kevin Costner! \n"}, {"text": "Who was featured as Michael Keaton's leading lady in the breakout 1983 comedy hit 'Mr. Mom'?", "correct": "Teri Garr", "options": ["Geena Davis", "Jamie Lee Curtis", "Robin Wright"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeri Garr.\n\n\tThough 'Night Shift' put Keaton on the map, it was his performance as the loveable stay-at-home dad, Jack Butler, in 'Mr. Mom' that really made him a star.  Teri Garr did her typically tremendous job as Keaton's wife, Caroline Butler, who is forced to return to the job market (what a dated concept!) when Butler is laid-off from the auto plant at which he works.  The script was written by John Hughes. \n"}, {"text": "Keaton's comedic success was continued in 1984 when he played the lead role in the clever crime comedy 'Johnny Dangerously'.  What was the surname of Keaton's character in this funny film?", "correct": "Kelly", "options": ["Mahoney", "O'Reilly", "Malone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKelly.\n\n\tCo-stars galore adorned the screen with Keaton in this madcap film that defiles your sensibilities with its inane humor.  Along with Keaton's acting, other notable performances included Joe Piscopo's turn as the lead villain Danny Vermin and Maureen Stapleton as Ma Kelly. \n"}, {"text": "In the mid-1980s American jobs were being lost in the auto industry, and it became popular to blame Japan.  Picking up on that theme was the 1986 comedy 'Gung Ho', starring Michael Keaton as Hunt Stevenson, a tough but sometimes mealy-mouthed auto plant worker.  What was the alternate title for this film?", "correct": "Working Class Man", "options": ["Salaryman", "Car Kamikazes", "Making Cars for a Living"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorking Class Man.\n\n\tThough stereotypical in some respects, 'Gung Ho' (which saw the reuniting of Ron Howard with Michael Keaton) was so light in humor that it's difficult to take much offense.  The film also starred George Wendt, Mimi Rogers and John Turturro, and featured the loveable Gedde Watanabe as Kazihiro, the Japanese alter ego of Hunt Stevenson.  Watanabe went on to portray his same character in the short-lived television comedy based on the film (Scott Bakula played Hunt Stevenson.) \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the highlight of Michael Keaton's comedic career came in 1988 when he played the outrageous and offensive title role in the film 'Beetlejuice'.  'Beetlejuice' marked the first time that Michael Keaton had teamed with director Tim Burton in his acting career.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, the two of them would go on to join forces in the megahit 'Batman', but 'Beetlejuice' was the first of their collaborations.  'Beetlejuice' also featured the acting talents of Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Rider and Catherine O'Hara.  This quirky film also featured appearances by Robert Goulet and Dick Cavett...how's that for strange? \n"}, {"text": "Michael Keaton's first turn as a dramatic actor also came in 1988 when he portrayed Daryl Poynter as a drug addict in recovery mode.  What was the name of this interesting and underrated film?", "correct": "Clean and Sober", "options": ["The Squeeze", "Touch and Go", "Speechless"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClean and Sober.\n\n\t'Clean and Sober' marked Keaton's dramatic film debut, and what a performance it was.  Though not nominated for an Oscar, his performance did merit an award from the National Society of Film Critics.  Morgan Freeman put in a typically excellent performance as Keaton's co-star in this film. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1989 comedy 'The Dream Team', Keaton led an ensemble cast as Billy Caufield, a patient in a sanitarium who leads a 'team' of mentally ill friends in a comedy caper through New York City.  Which of these actors is not a member of the 'dream team'?", "correct": "Clint Howard", "options": ["Christopher Lloyd", "Stephen Furst", "Peter Boyle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClint Howard.\n\n\tWith a great cast, which includes Keaton, Christopher Lloyd of 'Back to the Future' and 'Taxi' fame, Peter Boyle, whose memorable roles include the monster in 'Young Frankenstein', and Stephen Furst, aka Flounder from 'Animal House', the film is worthy of a few good laughs. \n"}, {"text": "Michael Keaton was very fortunate to land the lead role in the 1989 megahit 'Batman'.  In how many of the 'Batman' films (including the first) did Keaton appear in the lead role?", "correct": "2", "options": ["4", "3", "1"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tMichael Keaton portrayed Batman/Bruce Wayne in the first film and the 1992 sequel 'Batman Returns'.  The lead role was handed over to Val Kilmer in the third film 'Batman Forever' (1995) and George Clooney took on the role of the Caped Crusader in the 1997 film 'Batman & Robin'.  Keaton was the best of the actors portraying the hero, in my opinion. \n"}, {"text": "In 1990 Michael Keaton took a surprising turn as a villain in the thriller 'Pacific Heights'.  Keaton plays Carter Hayes as the tenant from hell, who rents a house in which of these cities?", "correct": "San Francisco", "options": ["Seattle", "Portland", "San Diego"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Francisco.\n\n\tAfter having entertained us in light comedies for a decade, Keaton decided that he wanted a career shift.  Having scored some success with his dramatic role in 'Clean and Sober', Michael tried his hand in a 'bad guy' role in this film, set in the San Francisco neighborhood called Pacific Heights.  The film co-starred Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith, but Keaton really stole the show with his frightening performance. \n"}, {"text": "In 1994 Keaton led an ensemble cast in the film 'The Paper', a drama that revolved around the world of Newspaper reporting.  Keaton portrayed Henry Hackett in 'The Paper', an editor who worked on what fictitious New York paper?", "correct": "New York Sun", "options": ["New York Ledger", "New York Tribune", "New York Register"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York Sun.\n\n\tKeaton once again teamed up with his favorite director, Ron Howard, in this interesting film with an all-star cast.  Aside from Keaton, the movie also featured the talents of Glenn Close, Marisa Tomei, Robert Duvall, Jason Robards, Jason Alexander, Catherine O'Hara and Randy Quaid...oh yes, and Clint Howard too!  In my opinion, it was Keaton's best film of the 1990s.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other stuff. \n"}]}
