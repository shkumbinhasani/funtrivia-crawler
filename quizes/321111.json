{"id": "321111", "name": "The Science of Snowflakes Online Trivia | Environment | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " Environment", "Weather"], "questions": [{"text": "The Guinness Book of World Records lists the world's largest snowflake as being 15 inches wide. This flake and others like it fell in 1887, on Fort Keogh, in which large northern state?", "correct": "Montana", "options": ["Minnesota", "Maine", "Michigan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMontana.\n\n\tDuring a freak snowstorm, Fort Keogh, Montana, was pelted with extremely large snowflakes. Most snowflakes are measured in millimeters or micrometers. They are all but invisible to the naked eye. But that day they were the size of pancakes! \n"}, {"text": "Which scientist photographed thousands of snowflakes with one of the world's first photographic microscopes? ", "correct": "Wilson  Bentley", "options": ["Robert Buick", "Thomas Rolls", "Henry Ford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilson  Bentley.\n\n\tWilson \"Snowflake\" Bentley perfected the art of catching individual snowflakes on a piece of black velvet. He photographed over 5,000 snowflakes in his lifetime, most of which have been preserved. He was also the first scientist to measure snowflakes, raindrops, and hailstones. He was one of the worlds first cloud physicists and wrote the entry for the 14Th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica under the heading of \"snow\". \n"}, {"text": "Snow that falls in the shape of a ball instead of a flake is called which of the following?", "correct": "graupel", "options": ["coring", "slunk", "tank"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngraupel.\n\n\tIn certain weather conditions water droplets can condense on the outside of the snowflake causing a small round ball of snow to form. These little spheres of snow are call graupel or soft hail. They are different from hail in both size and hardness and usually fall in conditions of high moisture saturation in the air. \n"}, {"text": "Barometric pressure can affect how many sides a snowflake has.", "correct": "true", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntrue.\n\n\tMost snowflakes are 6 sided figures. But, they can have as few as 3 and have been found to have as many as 12 sides. The higher the moisture density in the air and the higher the barometric pressure, the more sides the ensuing snowflakes are likely to have. \n"}, {"text": "Most snowflakes are hexagonal, which means they would usually have 6 sides and meet at six points. What is the proper name for these meeting points?", "correct": "vertices", "options": ["venal", "velum", "valet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nvertices.\n\n\tA hexagon is simply a polygon with six vertices' and six edges. The vertices are the six points which make up the outside shape of the snowflake. Water always crystallizes in a hexagonal shape. While the vast majority of snowflakes will be hexagonal, as is common in nature, there are variations. \n"}, {"text": "The branches on a snowflake are called radiating ____?", "correct": "dendrites", "options": ["permutations", "conics", "ilia"], "explanation": "\n\n\ndendrites.\n\n\tThese branches are properly called radiating dendrites. The numbers, size, and shape are all influenced by moisture saturation, air pollution, wind, and temperature. Variations are endless! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the chart used for indexing snowflakes and their shapes, which was named after the scientist who invented it?", "correct": "Nakaya's Classification Chart", "options": ["Myown's Classification Chart", "Stergle's Classification Chart", "Rydzik's Classification Chart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNakaya's Classification Chart.\n\n\tUkichiro Nakaya, was a famed Japanese physicist who came up with a classification chart in 1935 that sorted snowflakes into 41 different types. This chart is still used today. Nakaya is also credited with creating the world's first artificial snowflakes. \n"}, {"text": "In 1611, which early scientist wrote a short treatise \"On the Six-Cornered Snowflake\"? ", "correct": "Johannes Kepler", "options": ["Edmund Halley", "Copernicus", "Amerigo Vespucci"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohannes Kepler.\n\n\tThis piece of scientific writing can be attributed to Johannes Kepler. It is the oldest known scientific paper on snowflakes. He knew the hexagonal shapes formed by snowflakes had to have a scientific reason behind them. It would be 300 years before an adequate explanation was provided by the scientific world. \n"}, {"text": "10 inches of snow will melt down to about 1 inch of water.", "correct": "true", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntrue.\n\n\t1 inch of rain is equivalent to about 10 inches of snow. The difference comes from the air trapped in snow ice crystals and the density of the snow. This can be seen by simply filling a tall water glass with snow and watching it melt. The lighter and fluffier the snow the faster it melts. \n"}, {"text": "Snowflakes are just frozen raindrops.", "correct": "false", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfalse.\n\n\tFrozen rain is sleet, graupel, or more simply frozen drops of water. They are not crystalline in formation. Snowflakes are frozen molecules of water that have joined together to make prisms and dendrites. \n"}]}
