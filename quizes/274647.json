When Beth introduces David to George, they comment about each other's jobs and George unwittingly makes the off-hand comment to Beth that 'she could do a lot better than David' and he soon regrets it after they leave. \n"}, {"text": "What is Kramer's role in Mickey's Acting Studio audition?", "correct": "A businessman accused of murder", "options": ["A detective losing faith", "A corpse", "A housewife with a lack of compassion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA businessman accused of murder.\n\n\tLater, when Jerry is at the apartment, Kramer and Mickey stop by.  Mickey is stressed because of his upcoming audition for The Acting Studio while Kramer is excited to be a part of it.  He's helping out Mickey by playing a businessman accused of murder, and while he has no lines, he considers the role important.\rKramer soon notes that his pants are falling apart and Jerry says that Kramer always used to wear jeans when they first met.  Kramer explains that he no longer has the body for that, as when he did wear jeans, he was as fit as a preteen Swedish boy.  Kramer assumes Jerry is saying he can't wear jeans, so he vows to buy a pair immediately. \n"}, {"text": "What does Elaine say that she nearly hit during her first driving exam?", "correct": "A dog", "options": ["A tree", "A pedestrian", "Another car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA dog.\n\n\tAfter Kramer leaves to get jeans, Jerry goes to run some errands with Elaine, and she ends up driving the car for the first time in a while.

Elaine quickly stops the car.\rThey head to the coffee shop and immediately work at a plan to jump at the soon-to-be-divorced couple.  Since they assume that the relationship is teeming with people who want to steal the spouses for themselves, they decide to act fast.\rElaine says that they'll call David and Beth just to say 'I'm there for you', then over time, make it so that they're just 'there'. \n"}, {"text": "What does Jerry compare Kramer to when he's wearing his new dungarees?", "correct": "Frankenstein", "options": ["Dracula", "A zombie", "A disabled person"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrankenstein.\n\n\tWhile at the apartment, Jerry and Elaine tell George that Beth and David are getting a divorce and George immediately realizes it may have been a result of his comment at the coffee shop a day earlier.

Both of them end up getting dinner dates in the process, and both nearly end up ruining the plan on the phone, but they pull it off.\rKramer, on the other hand, can't pull his new pants off.
