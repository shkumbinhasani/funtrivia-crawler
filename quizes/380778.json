{"id": "380778", "name": "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers World Tour Trivia Game | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Theatre"], "questions": [{"text": "Which was the first character shown in the play?", "correct": "Alpha 5", "options": ["Rita Repulsa", "Tommy Oliver", "Lord Zedd"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlpha 5.\n\n\tThe stage play opened with a prerecorded video clip in the Ranger's Command Center. The camera panned up to Alpha 5 as he was looking through the viewing globe and started a conversation with Zordon about the activities of Lord Zedd. \n"}, {"text": "What happened to Rita Repulsa in the first scene she was in?", "correct": "Putties kidnapped her.", "options": ["She was returned to her prison.", "She was covered in slime.", "She wasn't in the stage show."], "explanation": "\n\n\nPutties kidnapped her.\n\n\tRita was in the second scene, and first live action, of the play. She annoyed Lord Zedd so he had the putties kidnap her and take her away.\r Later in the same scene Zedd shrunk her into the size of a doll and had her locked away. \n"}, {"text": "The play was set in Angel Grove.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhile the \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" show was primarily set in Angel Grove, the concept of the play was that it was set in whichever city it was being performed in.\r Rather than risk the actors forgetting where they were though, the dialogue was just kept generic and used terms like \"this city\" and \"the city\" in most of the references. \n"}, {"text": "Which was the first of the Rangers to be shown in the play?", "correct": "Tommy", "options": ["Jason", "Trini", "Zach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTommy.\n\n\tTommy, who was the White Ranger, was the only option that was actually in the play. The other three characters had been written out of the show before the play was written.\r A small piece with the actors from the show was recorded on video for the play, then different actors were hired to play the morphed Rangers. That allowed the \"real\" rangers to be in the theater for the fans, and didn't stop production on the show. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the monster that Lord Zedd created?", "correct": "Lumitor", "options": ["Eye Guy", "Goldar", "Babboo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLumitor.\n\n\tZedd unveiled the new monster right after returning Rita Repulsa to her full size with a \"Stretching Chamber\".\r The creature was called Lumitor, and was described as a fire lion. Zedd said his mere touch could burn a house to cinders. \n"}, {"text": "Which two Rangers were the first imprisoned by Goldar?", "correct": "Aisha and Adam", "options": ["Billy and Rocky", "Tommy and Kimberly", "Tommy and Rocky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAisha and Adam.\n\n\tAisha (yellow) and Adam (black) were the two imprisoned by Goldar. He then left them with guards who were to take them to Lord Zedd. Aisha then faked an ankle injury to trick their captors into removing her chains. She convinced her jailers Squat and Baboo that she couldn't walk with the chains. \n"}, {"text": "What was different about the Pink Ranger's costume from the other five Ranger suits?", "correct": "It had a skirt.", "options": ["She had a shield.", "Her boots had high heels", "She had the only costume with a detailed helmet design."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt had a skirt.\n\n\tThe Pink Ranger was the only one with a skirt. The Yellow Ranger, who was also female, had an identical costume to the Red, Blue and Black Rangers. The White Ranger had a special costume as well, but no skirt.\r Each of the Ranger helmets had a design that looked like the animal they drew their powers from. \n"}, {"text": "Did the Ranger's Zords appear in the play?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe Rangers called forth their Zords about halfway through the play. This was accomplished by showing the sequence from the TV show on large video screens. A short scene with the Zords was then shown on the screen as the Zords fought Lumitor, who was on the stage.\r Lumitor, with the help of some pyrotechnics \"battled\" the Zords on the large screens. \n"}, {"text": "How was the monster defeated?", "correct": "Water melted it.", "options": ["The Dragonzord blasted it.", "The monster wasn't defeated, it was just distracted and left to fight another day.", "The six Rangers worked together to destroy it with their power weapons."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWater melted it.\n\n\tLumitor, being made of fire, had a bad reaction to water. Billy figured that out early on, and used the Firebird Thunderzord to plant chemicals in the clouds to start a rainstorm.\r When the rain started to fall, Lumitor dissolved in the water. \n"}, {"text": "What were the captured Rangers turned into?", "correct": "Birds", "options": ["Snakes", "Rocks", "Trees"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBirds.\n\n\tFirst Lord Zedd transformed them into monkeys, then he turned them into birds. The two worked together to talk to their teammates when they were found, but could only muster one word each.\r Tommy's talking sword, Saba, was able to talk to the birds though and deciphered a message to the rest of the team. \n"}]}
