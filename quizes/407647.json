{"id": "407647", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 30\" [3] Quiz | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 30"], "questions": [{"text": "In the start of Leg 5, teams travelled to Les Baux-de-Provence, arriving there at what time?", "correct": "Early in the morning", "options": ["Teams never travelled to this destination", "Noon", "Dinnertime"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarly in the morning.\n\n\tTeams started Leg 5 at the Place des Lices in Saint-Tropez, France, heading out from their fourth Pit Stop in the middle of the night with instructions to drive themselves to Les Baux-de-Provence, two hundred kilometres west.  It meant that when teams arrived at their destination and walked up to the top of the city to visit Ch\u00e2teau des Baux, they were doing so just before sunrise, early in the morning atop the fortified city in the south of France.  All teams had to wait for the ch\u00e2teau to open before receiving their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Participants completing the Road Block in Leg 5 had to construct which of these medieval weapons?", "correct": "Trebuchet", "options": ["Cannon", "Arbalest", "Battering ram"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrebuchet.\n\n\tAll eight remaining teams kicked into the Road Block at the same time, right after the sunrise in medieval France.  Opening their clues, one member of each pair needed to get medieval by using materials provided to make an authentic trebuchet.  If they could properly construct this massive weapon, they could get it approved and free their waiting partner, locked into the stockades for the duration of the challenge.  Conor, Lucas, Kristi, Henry, Eric, Cody, Chris, and Tim completed this task to get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "In the 'Full of Bull' Detour option in Leg 5, teams needed to find how many different coloured ribbons to get their next clue?", "correct": "Three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree & 3.\n\n\tFinishing the Road Block, teams needed to visit the Caf\u00e9 de la Fontaine in Maussane-les-Alpilles to obtain their Detour clue from a man enjoying a glass of red wine.  The first of their Detour options, 'Full of Bull', was the one completed by most teams.  It required that they travel to the Arles Amphitheatre and search through the hundred bull replicas there for three that had ribbons representing the colours of the French flag.  If they could collect the red, the white, and the blue, they could trade them for their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "The 'Colorful' Detour option, encountered by teams in Leg 5, had them completing a slide puzzle based on a famous artwork by which artist?", "correct": "Vincent Van Gogh", "options": ["Claude Monet", "Leonardo da Vinci", "Pablo Picasso"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVincent Van Gogh.\n\n\tTeams who didn't visit the Arles Amphitheatre instead had to make their way to Pont Van Gogh, a local bridge painted by Vincent Van Gogh several times.  There, in front of the landmark, they had to solve a unique slide puzzle featuring the bridge, in doing so unlocking the back of the easel where they could nab their next clue.  Only Joey and Tim ended up heading to this challenge, completing it while the other seven teams finished 'Full of Bull'. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated in France at the end of Leg 5?", "correct": "Joey and Tim", "options": ["Trevor and Chris", "Alex and Conor", "Cody and Jessica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoey and Tim.\n\n\tFinishing their Detours, teams drove themselves to the Hotel Benvengudo in Les Baux-de-Provence and, with that, to the fifth Pit Stop of the race in the gardens there.  Lucas and Brittany, leading for the entire leg (after placing second-to-last in Leg 4), hit the mat in first to win a trip for two to Bali, Indonesia courtesy of Travelocity. As they were followed in by Kristi and Jen, Eric and Daniel, and Henry and Evan, Lucas dropped to one knee and popped the question, making them one of the handful of teams to get engaged on the race course.  Although Trevor and Chris got lost driving through France, Joey and Tim fell to the bottom of the standings and were eliminated in eighth. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 6, teams flew from the south of France to what European city?", "correct": "Prague", "options": ["Tallinn", "Berlin", "Budapest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrague.\n\n\tTeams booked tickets on a Travelocity Mobile App at the start of Leg 6, leaving the fifth Pit Stop in Provence, France and flying themselves from Marseille to Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic.  While four teams caught the first flight, three were booked onto a second, one hour later.  Before arriving, teams were warned that a Double U-Turn would be waiting for them ahead on the race course. \n"}, {"text": "Which team utilized the U-Turn against Trevor and Chris in Leg 6?", "correct": "Cody and Jessica", "options": ["Henry and Evan", "Kristi and Jen", "Alex and Conor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCody and Jessica.\n\n\tLanding in Prague, teams needed to race to the Rudolfinum near the River Vltava.  There, before opening their first clue in the city, teams had to face the Double U-Turn and make a choice as to whether or not they forced another team to complete both impending Detour tasks.  The race mechanic was only used by one team, Cody and Jessica, who forced Trevor and Chris to complete both tasks.  Since Trevor and Chris were already in last, they opted not to use the U-Turn themselves. \n"}, {"text": "The Detour found in Leg 6 was a Blind Detour.  Which one proved to be the more popular option?", "correct": "'This'", "options": ["'That'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'This'.\n\n\tWithout any instructions, teams were told they could do 'This' or 'That'.  Given nothing more than directions, teams would find out the tasks they would face when they arrived at their next spots.  Most teams went with 'This', taking them to the Staropramen Brewery.  There, teams worked in the local beer industry, stacking empty kegs until they found one full keg from which they could pour a perfect glass of beer. Then, they needed to deliver their full keg through the city streets to a boat, the Fidelio, on the Vltava River.  Only Eric and Daniel and Trevor and Chris did 'That', which sent them, instead, to Charles University to listen to lectures on astronomy. If they could answer eight questions correctly in an oral exam, they would get their next clue.  Because Trevor and Chris were U-Turned, they subsequently went back to complete 'This' as well. \n"}, {"text": "The Road Block found in Leg 6 was a Switchback wherein teams had to get a secret passphrase from which of these?", "correct": "Ringing phones", "options": ["A decoder ring", "A library", "A series of statues"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRinging phones.\n\n\tAfter completing the Detour, teams travelled to the Andelska Lazen Beer Spa to get their next clue which, subsequently, directed them to a Road Block in a warehouse at Stara Cistirna Odpadnich Vod).  It turned out to be a Switchback based on a famous task last seen in \"The Amazing Race 15\".  For this, one member of each team needed to head into the building and pick up the hundreds of ringing phones searching for eight that would give them different words. If they could rearrange the words to make the Franz Kafka phrase 'the meaning of life is that it stops', they could write it on a complex form and hand it in to the main office to get it approved and get their next clue. Jen, Daniel, Evan, Alex, Brittany, Jessica, and Trevor were selected for this task. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated upon reaching the sixth Pit Stop of the race?", "correct": "Trevor and Chris", "options": ["Lucas and Brittany", "Cody and Jessica", "Alex and Conor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrevor and Chris.\n\n\tTo end the sixth leg of the race, teams needed to make their way up to the overlook at Letensk\u00e9 Park where they could check in at the mat and complete the first half of the race.  This time, Kristi and Jen maintained a strong lead to take the win, their second of the race (and their first since the very first leg).  Their prize, this time, was a trip for two to Perth, Australia courtesy of Travelocity. The last team to arrive this time was Trevor and Chris who, forced to complete both Detour tasks due to the Double U-Turn, couldn't keep pace with the other teams.  They placed seventh overall. \n"}]}
