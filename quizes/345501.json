She wanted to go to her sister's in Florida and bring Violet with her to start school.  Ben wanted her to consider the house in Los Angeles so that they could have a fresh start and actually work at their marriage, but she claimed that she tried, hard.  He said the house would be perfect-- just what she wanted-- and he'd had dreams about this house.  He said he loved her and that he would beg her to just see the house.  Soon enough, they were moved in.\r In the present day, Ben calls for Viv and Violet in an otherwise empty house.

She is extremely hesitant to give him up and Ben won't have it.  Finally she opens up about the truth; he shouldn't bring him back into the other house because the forces therein will do horrible things.  She says he's blind, and that's when he sees the picture of Tate and Addie on the countertop.  All this time, he never realized that Constance was his mother.  When he asks where Tate is, Constance says he's in his grave and that Ben is paying for his sins.\rBack in the murder house, Viv and Moira speak in the kitchen about observing as ghosts.  Viv keeps forgetting that she doesn't need to hide herself since she can't be seen unless she wants to and she watches, remembering that Ben has always been a good father.  Moira and Viv's goal is to protect the child, but that can't be done in the house.\rViv asks Moira for a cup of tea, but she says she won't make one; they're equals in the ghost world.

He places it into his mouth but sees a picture of Violet on his desk and can't pull the trigger.  Viv stops him, appearing to him and taking the gun.  She says that the baby needs a father; he needs to go.  She doesn't care if the baby isn't his-- it is his regardless.  She forgives him and says that he needs to protect their child.  Violet appears as well; he apologizes to her and regrets his choices but she takes the blame as well.  She says he won't need to pay for her tuition anymore, which is good.  She also says that he needs to leave with the baby-- it's not safe.\rWhen they disappear, Ben goes upstairs, grabs the baby, and makes his way out.  He's stopped at the stairs by Hayden, however, who, along with some of the more homicidal ghosts of the mansion, wrap the noose around his neck and hang him from the chandelier. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the family that purchases the murder house after the Harmons?", "correct": "The Ramoses", "options": ["The Blacks", "The Escobars", "The Gabriels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ramoses.\n\n\tMarcy, the realtor, welcomes the Ramoses to the house for a showing, weeks after Ben's body has been discovered in the main lobby.

While Ben was reunited with Viv and Violet in the afterlife, Constance made it her duty to locate the baby, her grandson. Constance also found Violet's body in the crawlspace, though she never said it, but she did go into the basement to retrieve the infant from Hayden's arms.  Constance told her that Viv wanted her to look after the child outside of the mansion, out of harm's way, and while Hayden didn't want to give up the child, Travis distracted her by slitting her throat and handing off the child.

Ben says that therapy doesn't work-- he's a total fraud-- people pay him to make it feel better but it doesn't matter at all.  Ben says that the two of them are both bad people but he can't be forgiven.  Violet won't go back to him because he has no remorse.

For the past three years she's been off the radar, housebound, because she took on the role of mother for \"the child of distant cousins\" in Virginia.  She claims that the child was orphaned.
