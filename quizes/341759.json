{"id": "341759", "name": "\"New York\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "How many hotel rooms do the New Directions have to share in New York?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Four", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tTo the tune of \"Rhapsody in Blue\", Rachel stands in the middle of Times Square, finally having made it to New York.  The kids start singing while enjoying lunch in the square and Kurt notes how long it took them to finally reach this point in their Glee Club careers.  Rachel rushes up with several tickets to \"Cats\", too excited to realize that the show closed eleven years earlier.\rAt the hotel, Will fulfills the group's reservations for two rooms as it's all they can afford.  The woman behind the counter states that most Glee Clubs divide their rooms by sexual orientation, not gender.\rRachel and Finn discuss their arrival in New York and his and Quinn's break-up but Rachel doesn't want to talk about any relationships until after the competition.  Puck and Lauren try to order cocktails from the hotel bar before Will instructs them to head upstairs. \n"}, {"text": "While on lockdown in the hotel, Brittany writes a song about which of these?", "correct": "Cups", "options": ["Headbands", "Dolls", "Beds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCups.\n\n\tWill puts all the kids on lockdown in their hotel room to write their two songs for Nationals while he \"goes to the theater to fill out some paperwork...and stuff\".  Will instead goes to Broadway to meet April Rhodes at the theater hosting her new Broadway show, \"Crossrhodes\".  The kids don't have a good time with songwriting; their being cooped inside produces uninspired numbers like Brittany's song about cups entitled \"My Cup\" (which rivals Rachel's \"My Headband\").\rThe kids decide to let New York write their songs for them and they head into the city proper to seek their inspiration.  On the way through Times Square and Central Park, they sing a mash-up of Madonna's \"I Love New York\" and \"New York, New York\" from the musical \"On the Town\". \n"}, {"text": "Who suggests to Finn that he ask Rachel on a date?", "correct": "Puck", "options": ["Artie", "Mike", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuck.\n\n\tWhen the kids return to the hotel, the guys get to work writing songs while the girls (and Kurt) enjoy a pillow fight in the other room.  Finn asks the guys if he and Rachel can start the performance with a duet and they all agree it would be a winning strategy.  Puck tells Finn that he should ask Rachel out and with their support and the allure of the city, he decides to text her to meet her at the Bow Bridge in Central Park (dressed up).\rWill walks onto the Broadway stage at April's show and sings Matthew Morrison's \"Still Got Tonight\" while he thinks no one is watching.  At the end of the song, a representative for the theater comes down the stairs and tells him that he has genuine talent. \n"}, {"text": "Which of Rachel's idols does she meet at Sardi's?", "correct": "Patti Lupone", "options": ["Judy Garland", "Idina Menzel", "Barbra Streisand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatti Lupone.\n\n\tRachel arrives in Central Park to find Finn dressed in a suit and tie (with flowers).  He says that the two of them should write a duet for Nationals since they're team captains and that they should call this a 'work date'-- strictly professional.  The two of them enjoy lunch at New York's famous Sardi's Restaurant and before Finn can ask her a question, Rachel spies one of her idols, Patti Lupone, getting up from a table.  Rachel decides she must talk to her, if not for herself then for Kurt, and she introduces herself.  Patti tells Rachel never to give up on her dreams and wishes both of them luck for their competition (and tells Rachel that Finn's cute).  Rachel is starstruck.\rAs they walk through the streets of New York, Rachel mentions that all they need is for street performers to serenade them and as they turn the corner, Puck, Sam, Mike, and Artie begin singing \"Bella Notte\" from \"Lady and the Tramp\".  Finn asks to kiss her and she decides that she can't. \n"}, {"text": "What do Kurt and Rachel do when they hit New York as a duo?", "correct": "Break into a theater", "options": ["See a show", "Sing at the Statue of Liberty", "Shop at Macy's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBreak into a theater.\n\n\tKurt wakes Rachel up early on the morning of the competition for something truly important to both of them: breakfast at Tiffany's.  While standing out front with their bagels they both decide that it's their destiny to come back for college and fame.  Kurt says that Blaine is already onboard and the plan is virtually set but Rachel is worried because Finn wants to get back together and he may be too much of a country boy to come. Kurt says that she may need to choose between love and career and he takes her to the Gershwin Theater to help her make her mind up.  They break in and though a guard sees them, he grants them fifteen minutes on the \"Wicked\" stage. The two of them duet the final song of \"Wicked\", \"For Good\", and Rachel realize that the stage is her true love.  She's made a choice. \n"}, {"text": "Who tells the kids about Will's possible Broadway venture?", "correct": "Dustin Goolsby", "options": ["Jesse St. James", "April Rhodes", "Sue Sylvester"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDustin Goolsby.\n\n\tQuinn expresses her distaste for the competition to Santana and Brittany and threatens to tell Mr. Schuester that Rachel and Kurt have gone into the city to get them suspended before the big show.  Santana tells her that it's not worth it to ruin everyone else's dreams because she can't have Finn.  When Quinn breaks down she says she just wants someone to love and to be loved by.  The girls decide to cheer her up by taking her for a haircut.\rIn the lobby, Will runs into Dustin Goolsby, the coach for Vocal Adrenaline, who wishes him luck on Broadway.  Will asks him how he knew over a drink and he reveals that he learned it from a Broadway blog.  He says not to tell the kids as it'll shake their confidence for Nationals.  Will says that he's not sure if he wants to do it since his real joy has been seeing the kids grow into mature young men and women following their dreams.  When he goes upstairs, the kids say they already know because Goolsby told them.  They express their support for Will but he says that he won't do it.  When he hit the stage he felt how glorious it was, but his real love is helping them reach that same level of fame.  They all hug before writing their songs for Nationals. \n"}, {"text": "Who gives Sunshine Corazon the confidence she needs to perform?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Her mother", "Quinn", "Her team"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tAt Nationals, everyone is pumped up and Will says that it's fine to get their hopes up since they have a really strong setlist to perform.  When they sit in on other groups' performances, they realize the strength of the groups they're up against.  Will watches as Goolsby gets up and follows him to the gift shop where he finds him buying t-shirts.  Goolsby states that every time they win Nationals they have a tradition of sending the other teams autographed shirts as consolation prizes.  Will buys him a t-shirt saying he'll get it when New Directions wins.\rRachel goes searching for Santana in the washroom but finds Sunshine Corazon throwing up instead.  Rachel criticizes her, but finds that she's doing it because she's so nervous.  As much as she used to love singing, Vocal Adrenaline made her scared to do it.  Rachel says Sunshine is too good to leave and that she sent her to the crackhouse at the beginning of the school year because she was too good.  Rachel says that they need to stick together and that she'll guide her through it if she needs help. \n"}, {"text": "According to Will, was Rachel and Finn's mid-performance kiss scripted?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tCarmel High's Vocal Adrenaline is next to hit the stage and the applause roars before Sunshine even steps up to the microphone.  Spying Rachel in the audience giving her support, Sunshine starts to sing her own original song, \"As Long as You're There\", before the rest of the choir comes out to perform their song and dance.  The number goes off without a hitch.\rBehind the stage, Finn walks up to Rachel confused since he's finally begging to be with her and she doesn't want him.  She says she does but this is her dream and she can't let anyone keep her from it.  She loves him, but there's nothing that can change her mind.  The curtain rises as they sing the song they'd worked together to write: \"Pretending\".  At the end of the emotional number the two of them kiss, much to the shock of the audience.  Jesse asks Will if- it was scripted.  It wasn't. \n"}, {"text": "What unexpected relationship is alluded to in the end of the episode?", "correct": "Mercedes and Sam", "options": ["Tina and Puck", "Artie and Rachel", "Santana and Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes and Sam.\n\n\tAfter the kiss, the kids perform their group number: \"Light Up the World\" and the crowd is brought to their feet.  Their performance is followed by a standing ovation.\rRachel tells Finn that they did well after their performance and Finn says that they had the kiss of the century.  Jesse begs to differ-- he says it was too vulgar and personal and that it would cost them the title.  Jesse says that he's clearly there for Rachel but Finn is confident that what they have is a more powerful connection.\rThe list is posted for the top ten competitors (of fifty) moving on and while Vocal Adrenaline makes the cut, New Directions is absent from the roster.\rKurt outlines the events that followed with Blaine back in Ohio.  Jesse went on and on about how the kiss cost them the competition; everyone went numb; Santana loses it and blames the couple at the hotel; the plane ride home was silent.  Kurt's not sad though.  Blaine tells Kurt that he loves him and Kurt responds with the same.  The two of them see Sam and Mercedes coming in for a coffee and they don't suspect a thing when the two of them walk away holding hands. \n"}, {"text": "What place does New Directions come in at Nationals?", "correct": "Twelfth", "options": ["Sixth", "Seventeenth", "Twentieth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelfth.\n\n\tBack at school, Santana is still frustrated and she carries a voodoo doll of Rachel around.  Brittany says this year wasn't really about winning though; it was about acceptance.  She knows that everyone in Glee fights and steals each others' boyfriends and girlfriends, but they're all family.  She knows that she'll be there for everyone's big moments because she loves them.  She loves Santana too.  Santana asks her when she got so smart.\rIn the library, Rachel finds Finn hiding because he thinks that everyone's angry at him.  At the moment he needed to be a leader, he blew it.  Rachel thinks that he had to express how he was feeling in the moment as an artist and he can't regret it.  Finn says it was worth it and Rachel agrees.  She knows they'll have another shot.  He tells her graduation and New York is a year away and they reconcile.\rAt the final meeting of the year, Will hangs a banner celebrating the New Directions' twelfth place win at Nationals and they congratulate themselves with their minuscule trophy. \n"}]}
