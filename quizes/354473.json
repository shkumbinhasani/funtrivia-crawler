It acts as the brain of the computer. What does CPU stand for?", "correct": "Central Processing Unit", "options": ["Computer Performance Utility ", "Control Point Unit", "Central Port Unit "], "explanation": "\n\n\nCentral Processing Unit.\n\n\tThe CPU is a very important component of the computer. It acts as the brain of the computer and processes all of its information. The faster the CPU the faster it can process information. Some computers contain multiple CPU's, making them faster and capable of processing large amounts of information at one time. The speed of a CPU is measured in Hertz (Hz), today typically on a scale of Gigahertz (billions of Hertz). As computers become faster they will need more efficient CPUs that can handle large amounts of information at once. \n"}, {"text": "Steve Jobs founded Microsoft.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBill Gates founded Microsoft; Steve Jobs founded Apple. Today Microsoft and Apple are two of the most successful companies in the computer business. The two companies are also rivals, but Intel is partners with both of them. When the companies were just getting started they were competing to create the best operating system.Both of them had an idea to sell operating systems for home use. Apple came out with their operating system first. Microsoft's operating system was created much later and it's earlier versions were not as successful. The idea of an operating system for home use was rejected at first by major companies such as IBM and Xerox because they believed no normal person would want a computer so there was no need for a home operating system.This turned out to be a big mistake considering that many people own a computer today. This is the plot of the movie \"Pirates of Silicon Valley\". \n"}, {"text": "Microsoft is a corporation that today is very successful. During its early years Microsoft competed with other companies that were already well known to create the best GUI for home use. What is the name of the series of operating systems created by Microsoft?", "correct": "Windows", "options": ["OSX", "Linux ", "Windows ", "Micro OS"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWindows.\n\n\tAn operating system instructs a computer how to operate. Microsoft created their GUI (Graphical User Interface) operating system later then some other companies, including Apple. Since the idea of a home operating system was not widely accepted at the time, the demand to create one and get many people to use it was high.Microsoft had to play catch up in order to become successful. The first few versions of Windows did not sell well; the first version of Windows that did was Windows 3.0. Today, Windows is one of the most widely used operating systems. Microsoft periodically releases new versions of Windows.\n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is a command prompt command for Microsoft Windows?", "correct": "PING", "options": ["Power", "Control Panel", "Add Device"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPING.\n\n\tThe command prompt uses the CLI (Command Line Interface) instead of the GUI (Graphical User Interface). The purpose of the command prompt is to perform troubleshooting and network tasks. This is useful if you are experiencing difficulties with your computer. The ping command determines the amount of time it takes data to travel from source to destination (and whether it can be reached at all). The tracert command is useful if you discover that a computer is not receiving data. It displays the exact path data takes and can help to determine where data was lost. \n"}, {"text": "Computers must have ways to store and process data in memory. Which of the following holds the data and programs that are being used at a specific time so it can be accessed quickly by the CPU?", "correct": "RAM", "options": ["REM", "RTM", "RIM"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRAM.\n\n\tThere are many ways that computers store and process memory. RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It can be installed into slots on the motherboard. It is recommended that you purchase more RAM if your computer is becoming slow. ROM, which is becoming rather rare, usually replaced by Flash memory, stands for Read Only Memory. Information written here is permanent and can not be changed. Flash memory is a type of memory that is held even after the computer is turned off. \n"}, {"text": "With today's technology, it usually does not matter if you switch a crossover cable with a straight-through cable when creating an Ethernet network. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tToday when two devices are connected it does not matter which of the two types of UTP cables are used. The devices adjust their settings accordingly, although this process fails occasionally. Before this was possible, you could only use one type of cable. A crossover cable was used to connect two like devices, such as two laptops.A straight-through cable was used to connect two unlike devices, such as a laptop and printer. It was very important that you purchased the correct cable type or the devices could not communicate. With today's technology it is easier to set up an Ethernet network with little assistance.\n"}, {"text": "A group of two or more computers that are connected to each other and are able to send and receive data is called a what?\n", "correct": "Network", "options": ["Internet ", "Host ", "System"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNetwork.\n\n\tNetworks range in their size and complexity. They range from small home and large business networks to the Internet. There must be some way to connect network devices together. The type of medium used depends on the network. If you are just connecting two devices you should probably use a simple cable, known also as \"peer to peer networking\". Other ways to connect devices include Infrared, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. Make sure you know which connection would work best for your devices and users before setting up a network. \n"}, {"text": "This component can damage a computer if installed incorrectly and injure a person if handled improperly. What is the name of this component?   ", "correct": "Power Supply", "options": ["Power Supply ", "Memory ", "Hard Drive", "CPU"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPower Supply.\n\n\tMany components are safe and easy to replace on your own while others contain extremely high voltages and should only be handled by an experienced technician. The power supply is one of the latter kind. It is safe to replace an unopened power supply but you should never try to repair one. A non-technician should never open a power supply even after it is disconnected. The charge can remain for several days after a power supply is unplugged. \n"}, {"text": "Computers are designed for specific purposes and perform different functions. Which of the following would you install to increase the functionality of your computer?", "correct": "Expansion card", "options": ["Functionality card", "Computer card", "Performance card "], "explanation": "\n\n\nExpansion card.\n\n\tExpansion cards can easily be installed by inserting them into slots on the motherboard. Expansion cards serve various purposes. One can be added to connect to the internet using Wi-Fi if your computer does not already have this capability. This card would most likely be added to a desktop computer since most laptops are already wireless. Other cards can be used to enhance the video, sound, and graphics of your computer. This is useful if you plan on using your computer for video or gaming. \n"}, {"text": "You turn your computer on and receive no display image but a series of beeps. This is a beep code that indicates what kind of problem there is with your computer. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tBeep codes are a great way to inform someone that their computer is having difficulties. The number of beeps heard indicate what type of problem is occurring. There could be bad memory or even a bad motherboard. One short beep is usually given when no problems are present. If the problem is really severe the computer might not even start.What each number of beeps mean depends on the manufacturer. If you come across a computer that is issuing a beep code, it is a good idea to figure out what this means so that you can fix the problem (usually by replacing the faulty component). Search your computer manual or computer manufacturer's website for a solution.\n"}]}
