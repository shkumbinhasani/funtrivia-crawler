What is amazing is that he only started playing the guitar at the age of 15. What's more, he was left-handed and learned to play upside down on a right-handed guitar. By the time of the Woodstock Festival in 1969, which he headlined, he was the world's highest-paid performer. His statue stands on the Isle of Wight, where he headlined the 1970 festival shortly before his death.\rHendrix was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991 and a year later the Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\rIt seems amazing now that Hendrix scored only one Top 20 single in the U.S. -- with \"All Along the Watchtower\" in 1968, which reached number 20.

This is the only non-compilation Floyd album to feature five members of the group, although Gilmour and Barrett only both performed on one track, \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\".\r\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" was the band's first album, and the only one of which Gilmour did not appear. \r\"Comfortably Numb\" was the last song ever performed by Gilmour, Roger Waters, Rick Wright and Nick Mason together. They re-untied in 2005 for \"Live 8\" in London, marking their first appearance as a foursome in 24 years. Rick Wright's death in 2008 also ensured that this would be their final performance. \n"}, {"text": "At number three in the poll are Gary Rossington and Allen Collins with the ultimate two-guitar song \"Freebird\", recorded in Georgia in 1973 and first appearing on Lynyrd Skynyrd's debut album \"(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)\".

Allen Collins died in 1990 following complications arising after a serious car accident. Bassist Larry Junstrom joined Ronnie Van Zant's brother, Donnie, in 38 Special in 1977. Original drummer Bob Burns left in the early 1970s and was replaced by Artimus Pyle.\rLynyrd Skynyrd were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.\rThe 14-minute live performance of \"Freebird\" by Rossington and Allen on BBC TV's \"Old Grey Whistle Test\" was always the clip that topped viewers' polls to be shown again. \n"}, {"text": "At number two is Eddie van Halen with \"Eruption\", recorded in 1977 and first released the following year on Van Halen's self-titled debut album.

For most Led Zeppelin recordings from the second album onwards, Page used a guitar sold to him by Joe Walsh: what type of guitar?", "correct": "Gibson Les Paul", "options": ["Fender Telecaster", "Danelectro 3021", "Vox 12-string "], "explanation": "\n\n\nGibson Les Paul.\n\n\tJames Patrick Page OBE was born in 1944 in Heston on the western outskirts of London. He became an established session guitarist whilst still a student and played on many hits of the era including two tracks on debut album by the Kinks and on the first single release by The Who.\rJimmy Page bought the 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard (No. 1) from Joe Walsh for $1200, and he used this guitar for most of the Led Zeppelin studio recordings. \rA 1959 Fender Telecaster given to him by Jeff Beck was used for the \"Stairway to Heaven\" solo.
