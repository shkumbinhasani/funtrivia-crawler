Multiple Choice Quiz | Basketball | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "  Basketball", "   NBA Players"], "questions": [{"text": "You find yourself on the intimidating hardwood 'parquet' floor in the Boston Garden during the mid-80s.  To make matters worse, a 6-foot-10 inch forward is backing you down in the paint with his unimpressive but surprisingly powerful build.  You notice the green number 32 on his jersey as he makes a spin move and pivots under your shoulder, softly laying the basketball off the glass and in for two.  Who has just taken the ball to the hole under your guard?", "correct": "Kevin McHale", "options": ["Paul Pierce", "Larry Bird", "Robert Parrish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin McHale.\n\n\tKevin McHale played power forward for the Boston Celtics during their three championship seasons of the 1980s (1981, 1984 and 1986).   Kevin's #32 jersey hangs in the rafters at Boston's Fleet Center in perpetuity, retired from further use.  Following his career with Boston, McHale moved to the Minnesota Timberwolves front office. \n"}, {"text": "You now find yourself playing against the Houston Rockets, it's the mid-90s.  In front of you, is an imposing 7 footer with amazingly silky moves for such a large man.  After being passed the ball, he suddenly dribbles toward you, with a surprising stutter-step move.  Appearing to travel (and you complain to the ref afterward), he spins right by you and jams the ball through the hoop with two hands.  You only have time to catch his number 34 as he whizzes past.  Who just made this 'dream' move? ", "correct": "Hakeem Olajuwon", "options": ["Otis Thorpe", "Ralph Sampson", "Kevin Willis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHakeem Olajuwon.\n\n\tHakeem Olajuwon, the king of the spin move, was given the apt moniker the 'dream' during his playing days with the Houston Rockets.  Teamed up with Ralph Sampson he almost won an NBA championship in 1985, and finally in both 1994 and 1995 he was able to kiss the trophy.  Hakeem ended his career with the Toronto Raptors, from whom he retired in 2002. \n"}, {"text": "Now it's the late 1990s and you find yourself in the newly christened 'Delta Center', home of the Utah Jazz.  Facing you is the Jazz point guard, a frail-looking 6 foot 1 inch guard with high, tight shorts that appear very uncomfortable.  You can take this guy, right?  Wrong!  Before you know what hit you he has dribbled around toward the left baseline and found his man for an easy lay-up.  You merely had a chance to catch his #12 as he drove past you with the greatest of ease.  Who just made you pay for your defensive fantasies?", "correct": "John Stockton", "options": ["Ricky Green", "Darrell Griffith", "Howard Eisley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Stockton.\n\n\tJohn Stockton, one of the most unassuming players in NBA history, holds the record for most assists and most steals in a career as of the year 2002.  Though Stockton never won an NBA championship, he helped battle the Chicago Bulls two years in a row, 1997 and 1998, for the NBA crown.  Michael Jordan was forced to work for those two trophies... \n"}, {"text": "Back to the mid-80s, once again.  Now you are playing against the high-flying and high-scoring Denver Nuggets.  You face a small forward the likes of which you've never seen before.  At 6 foot 7, he can handle the basketball as well as any point guard, a severe disadvantage for anyone attempting to guard him.  On top of that, this small forward has some of the silkiest moves and sweetest shots in pro-basketball history.  Coming around the lane to the right he appears to want to drive into the lane for a lay-up.  As you fall back into the lane, he suddenly pulls up for a gentle 15 footer that swishes through the net.  You fall down, the basketball bouncing near your head...and notice him trotting toward the backcourt, his number 2 smiling back at you.  Who just made you look like you were born with three legs?  ", "correct": "Alex English", "options": ["Fat Lever", "Kiki Vandeweghe", "Dan Issel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlex English.\n\n\tAlex English, like Stockton, never won an NBA championship.  In fact, he never even made it to the NBA finals.  This does not diminish the fact that he was the NBA's leading scorer for the decade of the 80s (19,682 pts).  English averaged 21.5 points during his NBA career with one of the smoothest games ever to hit the NBA hardwood. \n"}, {"text": "It's now the early 1990s, the heyday of the Portland Trailblazers.  Trotting down the left side of the court with the ball is a 6 foot 6 guard with a cheesy little mustache.  As you focus on that mustache and the #22 on his jersey, he continues to drive down the court, taking aim at the center lane.  'Gliding' past you, you merely reminisce about his appearance as he dunks the ball between two of your 7 foot teammates.  Who just turned you into background noise?", "correct": "Clyde Drexler", "options": ["Danny Ainge", "Damon Stoudamire", "Terry Porter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClyde Drexler.\n\n\tClyde 'The Glide' Drexler was a wonderful player for the Portland Trailblazers during the 80s and 90s.  He led the Blazers to the NBA championship series in both 1990 and 1992, but failed to defeat either the Pistons or the Bulls in those series.  A ring finally came to him during the 1995 season with the Houston Rockets! \n"}, {"text": "Still in the early 90s, you are now facing the deadly shooting Golden State Warriors.  You face up against a crew-cutted small forward with a deadly touch from the three point line.  Before you know what hits you...he spots up for a shot.  You turn your head just quickly enough to watch the ball swish through the hoop.  Who just lit you up?", "correct": "Chris Mullin", "options": ["Mitch Richmond", "Manute Bol", "Tim Hardaway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChris Mullin.\n\n\tI think the 'crew cut' hint should have given this one away (not to mention the fact that he is a forward!)  Chris Mullin came out of St. Johns University, much to the chagrin of Jazz fans everywhere.  The Warriors took the Jazz out of the playoffs several times during the late 80s and early 90s, largely due to the incredible shooting of Mullin, Richmond and Hardaway...oh yeah, and the magnificent three point shooting of Manute Bol, too! \n"}, {"text": "It's now the early 80s and you are facing one of the greatest NBA guards of all-time, at the height of his career no less!

Who is this man that has just frozen you like a block of ice?", "correct": "George Gervin", "options": ["Rich Kelley", "David Robinson", "Alvin Robertson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Gervin.\n\n\tThe 'ice' comment was a reference to George Gervin's nickname...the 'iceman'.  Gervin won 4 scoring titles during his illustrious career, and scored a total of 26,595 points!  It was a pleasure to see this smooth mover play the game...he could hit for 40 with unbelievable frequency (64 times during his career!) \n"}, {"text": "Who are these 'bad boys'?  You are now finding out, as elbows and knees are flying.  Yes, you are now facing the Detroit Pistons of the early 1990s.  The first man off the bench, a shooting guard, enters the game to face up against you.

To make matters worse, the 'microwave' aka Vinnie Johnson came off the bench as the third guard in this deadly trio.  Johnson was almost guaranteed to hit you for 15-20 points every night in his supporting role for the Pistons, and helped the 'bad boys' to their two championships of the late 80s - early 90s. \n"}, {"text": "It's the late 80s and you're guarding a small forward on the 76ers who plays like a power forward.

Standing in front of you is possibly the most powerful force ever to enter the NBA.  This 7 foot 1 inch center weighs around 315 pounds but seems to move like a 6 foot 6 inch guard.  He receives the ball from the wing and proceeds to move through you like a diesel truck.  You lie on the floor under the basket, looking straight up as he slams the ball into the hoop while deftly avoiding squashing you like a bug.  Which player just posterized you?", "correct": "Shaquille O'Neal", "options": ["Stanley Roberts", "Kareem Abdul Jabaar", "Samaki Walker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShaquille O'Neal.\n\n\tWhile some people believe that the Shaq gets away with some charges, one cannot deny is extraordinary skills around the basket.  He is a virtual scoring machine and can rebound and play servicable defense to boot.  The only solution to stopping him is to wait until he retires.  You may now proceed to the locker room, your defensive assignment is over.  Get some Bengay! \n"}]}
