{"id": "386409", "name": "Lion Quiz | L | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "L", "Li - Lz Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "In the first part of 'Lion', we meet a young boy named Saroo who is constantly trying to keep up with his older brother Guddu. In an early scene Guddu steals some coal before selling it to provide what drink for his family?", "correct": "Milk", "options": ["Water", "Lemonade", "Beer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilk.\n\n\tSaroo lives with his family near Khandwa village in West India. His mother, Kamla, works hard breaking rocks to make ends meet for her family. He also has an older brother, Guddu, and a younger sister, Shekila. Milk is seen as a treat by the family and something that they would rarely be able to afford. The gift of milk from Saroo and Guddu establishes the loyalty and love they feel towards their family.\r In the film, Saroo is portrayed by two different actors; the young Saroo by Sunny Pawar and the older Saroo by Dev Patel. Sunny was chosen from over 2000 boys to play the young Saroo and was only eight years old at the time of filming. When he first started shooting the film he was unable to speak English and bonded with some of the other cast members by playing cricket. \n"}, {"text": "Tired of waiting for his brother, Saroo decides to sleep on a stationary train. When he wakes up, the train is moving and there is no-one around to help him. In which Bengali city does the train eventually stop?", "correct": "Calcutta", "options": ["Chennai", "Jaipur", "Mumbai"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalcutta.\n\n\tUnbeknownst to Saroo, the train has travelled around 1000 miles (1600 km) East to the vast city of Calcutta. Originally hailing from a rural village, the young Saroo is bewildered by the city and he struggles to survive, sleeping rough and stealing food before he is eventually taken into an orphanage. \r Jaipur is located in the Northern state of Rajasthan while Mumbai is in the West (in Maharashtra) and Chennai is in the South (in Tamil Nadu).\r At the beginning of 2001, West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadev Bhattacharya officially renamed Calcutta to Kolkata to try and shrug of any reminder of the British Raj. Other cities that were renamed in the late 20th or early 21st century include Bombay to Mumbai in 1996 and Madras to Chennai in the same year. \n"}, {"text": "After spending several months in an orphanage, Saroo learns that he is to be adopted. In which country do his adopted family live?", "correct": "Australia", "options": ["United Kingdom", "Canada", "Brazil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAustralia.\n\n\tSaroo is adopted by the Australian couple John and Sue Brierley, played by David Wenham and Nicole Kidman respectively. Before Saroo travels he is taught some basics about his new life, including how to use a knife and fork and how to say 'salt' and 'pepper'. He is also given a jumper that says 'TASMANIA' in big letters on the front to help him feel more at home.\r His new parents meet him at the airport in Australia and are absolutely delighted to see him. While he is initially shy, Saroo soon adapts to his new life and forms a strong bond with his adopted family. \n"}, {"text": "The film now moves forward two years and we see that John and Sue Brierley have adopted a second young Indian boy. What is the name of Saroo's new brother?", "correct": "Mantosh", "options": ["Reyansh", "Aarav", "Aditya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMantosh.\n\n\tMantosh is not as easy going as Saroo and struggles to settle into the family when he first arrives in Australia. This strained relationship with his parents is developed later in the film when we find out that Mantosh general avoids contact with them and has had problems with drug abuse in the intervening years. \r Despite their difficulties, Saroo and Mantosh maintain a strong brotherly friendship throughout the film and Saroo refuses to give up on Mantosh. \n"}, {"text": "The film moves forward another 22 years and we meet the adult Saroo (Dev Patel). He begins a course in hotel management and quickly builds a relationship with a fellow student, Lucy. Which American actor portrays Lucy?", "correct": "Rooney Mara", "options": ["Zooey Deschanel", "Kirsten Dunst", "Brie Larson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRooney Mara.\n\n\tWhen the students in the hotel management course are asked why they are doing the course Lucy says that she wants to make people happy, while Saroo makes the class laugh by saying that he's in it for the money. Lucy and Saroo form an almost instant connection which later develops into a relationship.\r Rooney Mara first came to international prominence with her role in the 2010 film 'The Social Network' and went on to play the leading role in the American version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo', for which she was Oscar nominated. Other major roles include Catherine in Spike Jonze's 'Her' and Therese in the 2015 romantic drama 'Carol'.\r Kirsten Dunst appeared in 'Hidden Figures', another Oscar-nominated film in 2017, while Brie Larson won the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role at the 2016 ceremony for her work in the film 'Room'. \n"}, {"text": "While at a party with some friends from his course, Saroo has a flashback that reminds him of his childhood in India. What foodstuff prompted this flashback?", "correct": "Jalebi", "options": ["Samosa", "Bhaji", "Paratha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJalebi.\n\n\tThe jalebi is a sweet, fried snack food popular across the Indian subcontinent and beyond. Often presented in a pretzel-like shape, they are made by tubing sugar syrup-coated wheat-flour batter into a pan of hot oil.\r When Saroo sees the jalebis at the party he is transported back to his childhood in which he regularly saw jalebis at the market stall with his brother Guddu. This moment in the film pays homage to the novel 'In Search of Lost Time' by Marcel Proust in which the trigger food is a madeleine as opposed to a jalebi. \n"}, {"text": "After being reminded of his original family in India, Saroo is determined to try and find them. What internet-based tool does he use to try and track them down?", "correct": "Google Earth", "options": ["Amazon Prime", "Facebook", "Twitter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoogle Earth.\n\n\tThe intensity of Saroo's remembrance of the day in which he lost his family is such that he is able to identify several key features of the train station he was at when he got on the train. A friend tells him about the existence of Google Earth and he then works out roughly how long he was on the train and uses the average speed of a train in India in the 1980s to work out a huge circle of possible locations in which he may find his family.\r Google Earth provides satellite images of the entire surface of the globe, with the option to overlay maps such as train lines if required. This allows Saroo to systematically check each train station in the zone of possible locations. \n"}, {"text": "After the initial flashback to his childhood, Saroo is able to recall several other details. He remembers how he got the scar on his face when he was hit by a motorbike. What fruit was he carrying that obscured his vision and thus led to the collision?", "correct": "Watermelon", "options": ["Apple", "Gourd", "Pomegranate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWatermelon.\n\n\tThe young Saroo is somewhat small in stature, so carrying a watermelon is far from a trivial task. His flashback shows how he was holding the watermelon up in the air and was thus unable to see the approaching motorbike. The fact that Saroo still has the scar from this event in his childhood is symbolic of how his youth in India is still with him despite the fact that he is now fully grown. Other flashbacks in this period of the film include his remembrance of his brother Guddu taking food from the plates of diners in a crowded marketplace. \n"}, {"text": "After searching unsuccessfully for a long period of time, Saroo goes to visit his adopted family. He starts a discussion about adoption and Sue Brierley admits that she was unable to have children of her own.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSearching Google Earth to look at train stations takes over Saroo's life, jeopardising his relationships with both Lucy and his adopted family, as well as causing him to drop out of his course. He eventually manages to admit to his adopted parents what he has been doing with his time and they are instantly accepting and understanding. His fears that they would be angry or upset are unfounded and he feels comforted.\r He then asks Sue if she wishes that she could have had children of her own. She answers that both her and John were capable of having children but that they felt that there were so many children in need across the world that it seemed like a better decision to adopt those that had already been born and try and make their lives better. \n"}, {"text": "Does Saroo eventually manage the find the village in which he was brought up and thus be reunited with his mother?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThankfully he does, though it takes him a very long time (two years!). Eventually he finds a similar train station to the one in which he got lost by recognising a water tower and begins to discover that more and more of the nearby landscape and infrastructure is familiar to him. \r When he flies to his village to try and find his family there is a joyous reunion; his mother and sister are still living in the same village and they had always had hope that he would return one day. The film ends with footage of the real-life Saroo Brierley being reunited with family. \n"}]}
