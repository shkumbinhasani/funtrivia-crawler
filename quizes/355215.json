They have to pick five and match it up with their correct price. What game is this?", "correct": "It's In The Bag", "options": ["Magic Number", "Grocery Game", "Bag It!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's In The Bag.\n\n\tThe contestant has to correctly match up the five products and prices, and leave the sixth grocery item out, as it does not match up to the five prices. The game is set up so only one product matches up with one price; there is only one winning combination. When the contestant thinks they have matched up correctly, the host reveals the first item.If it was correctly matched, the contestant wins $1,000. The contestant can decide to walk with the money, or keep going. After each correct pairing, the winnings total doubles ($2,000, $4,000 up to $16,000 for all five). If one is wrong, the player loses everything. \n"}, {"text": "In this game, the player is handed three blocks, numbered 1, 2, and 3.

Be careful, as you can not bank all the money found behind your punches! What's the game?", "correct": "Punch a Bunch", "options": ["Punchboard", "Plinko", "Pick-a-Pair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPunch a Bunch.\n\n\tIn Punch-a-Bunch, the contestant is first shown four items, and they have to determine if the actual retail value is more or less than a given price. For each time, they are correct, they win a punch on the 5x10 punchboard. Behind each hole is a slit of paper with a prize amount, anywhere from $1 to the top prize of $25,000.

With the ten empty spots, the contestant has to guess the digits from 0-9, and when the price of one of the three prizes is full, the contestant walks with that prize. In the early days of the show, car prices were only four numbers (remember, then?), the first number was not revealed, and the contestant had to start guessing from the start. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these baseball terms is the name of a game on the show?", "correct": "Three Strikes", "options": ["Slugger", "Home Run", "Stolen Base"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree Strikes.\n\n\tIn this game, five discs (each one with a number in the price of a car on them), and three with an X on them. They are put in a bag and shuffled, where the contestant blindly draws them out. If they pull a number, they have to correctly guess where in the price that number fits. If they're right, that number is lit up on the gameboard, but if they are wrong it goes back in the bag.The game finishes when the three strikes are pulled, or if the contestant guesses the full price of the car, and win it as their prize. This game usually features luxury cars as prizes, as it is one of the harder pricing games on the show. \n"}, {"text": "One of my personal favourite games, contestants are shown a game board with six spaces (labelled car, $1000, $3000, $5000, and two Lose Everythings).

The contestant is shown three small prizes, and must guess the price. For every dollar, they are off, above or below, the climber climbs one step up the hill. After the three prizes, if the climber is still going up the hill, the player wins a large prize on the stage, plus the three small prizes.If the climber reaches the top, and falls off on the board, the player wins the prizes that they've already guessed. The mountain climber does not have a name, although hosts throughout the years have given it a few different names. \n"}, {"text": "This is the only game on the show that involves physical activity.

The game involves which sport?", "correct": "Golf", "options": ["Handball", "Wrestling", "Tennis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolf.\n\n\tAlthough wrestling would help with the rating, the game is \"Hole in One\" (or Two). The contestant lines up the six products in order of their price, each one closer to the hole. The prices are revealed down the line, and when one price revealed is lower than the previous one, the contestant has to putt from there. If the player miss their first shot, they get a second shot. A sunken putt means the player wins a car. \n"}, {"text": "Another game played for a car, in this one, players stand in the middle of a 5x5 board, each square with a number on it and have to walk the path of the car.

A correct guess wins the small prize, and a correct path wins the car. When all three prizes have been guessed, and the contestant steps on another wrong square, the game is over. \n"}, {"text": "This last game is probably the most well-known game on \"The Price is Right!\": the game of Plinko, where contestants slide chips down a game board, into different slots, with different prize amounts.
