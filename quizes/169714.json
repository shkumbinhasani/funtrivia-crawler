{"id": "169714", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Mulcahy's War' Online Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 5 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "Another episode, another operating session in the O.R.  During this session, we find BJ hard at work on a young man's foot, apparently a self-inflicted wound.  Which doctor of the M*A*S*H 4077th claims to be an expert on foot wounds?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Potter", "Hawkeye", "BJ"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tFrank sees that BJ is working on a young soldier's foot, and claims to be an expert in the area.  He also claims that the wound looks 'fishy', to which Hawkeye responds, 'I think he has a fish fetish'. \n"}, {"text": "Frank insists that the soldier with the foot wound whom BJ is patching up has shot himself.  Hawkeye makes up an incredible lie about the young man, a certain Danny Fitzsimons.  He claims that Fitzsimons is a star placekicker for which university's football team?", "correct": "Fordham", "options": ["Drexel", "Dayton", "Rutgers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFordham.\n\n\t'What happened is, an enemy soldier shot at him from very close range,' claims Hawkeye.  'Instinctively, Danny tried to kick the bullet out of the way', he insists.  Frank inquires about the enemy soldier, to which BJ responds, '10-yard penalty'.  Not surprisingly, Frank buys the entire story...asking Radar if Fordham has a football team. \n"}, {"text": "After patching up Fitzsimons, Hawkeye and BJ are summoned to the helicopter pad where they are told two wounded soldiers have arrived.  When they examine the two 'soldiers', they discover that one is a dog.  What sort of dog do they find on the rumble seat?", "correct": "German Shepherd", "options": ["Great Dane", "Irish Setter", "Golden Retriever"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGerman Shepherd.\n\n\tThe dog is a beautiful German Shepherd, best friend of Sergeant Hodkey, the other wounded soldier.  Hodkey claims that his pal, the dog, saved his life. \n"}, {"text": "We not only find out that this dog is a corporal in the U.S. army (according to his human companion), but that he has a cutesy name.  What is the dog called?", "correct": "Cupcake", "options": ["Honey", "Sweetheart", "Cinnamon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCupcake.\n\n\tCorporal Cupcake managed to save Hodkey's life by tripping a landmine, he later claims in the O.R.  When Frank enters the O.R., Hawkeye immediately consults with him about this new wounded 'soldier', whom they claim has been wounded in the foot.  Hawkeye confides that the wound is obviously self-inflicted.  Frank is insulted to discover that he is to operate on a dog, and despite the fact that his patient is a canine, insists that he be punished for inflicting his own wound.  Frank is in wonderful form in this episode, don't you think? \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye summons Father Mulcahy to come talk with Corporal Fitzsimons about his self-inflicted wound.  Mulcahy and the young soldier reminisce about Philadelphia, the boy's hometown.  They both are familiar with a certain Father Marty Gallagher, Fitzsimon's pastor.  What is Father Gallagher's nickname?", "correct": "Boom Boom", "options": ["Iron Priest", "Holy Moly", "Tank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoom Boom.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy claims to have studied with Gallagher, while Fitzsimons knows him as the pastor of his parish in Philly.  His nickname 'boom boom' came from the fact that he delivered sermons during World War II so close to the front line that they were often drowned out by the noise of battle.  At the end of his sermons, the enemy would say 'Amen', according to Fitzsimons!  Coincidentally, Colonel Potter also claims to have heard of Boom Boom Gallagher, the man had quite a reputation, you know? \n"}, {"text": "Father Mulcahy is rejected by Fitzsimons when the young man discovers that the good Father has never been to the front line.  Mulcahy immediately goes to Colonel Potter, hoping to rectify this situation.  Radar interrupts the conversation by letting the Colonel know there is an emergency up at an aid station.  It seems that a soldier needs to be picked up.  Potter orders Radar and which other individual from the camp to retrieve the wounded soldier?", "correct": "Igor", "options": ["Klinger", "Goldman", "Mulcahy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIgor.\n\n\tAs per Potter's instructions, Radar is to be accompanied by Igor to the aid station where they will pick up the young wounded soldier.  However, Mulcahy excuses Igor from the mission and goes in his place, against the specific orders of the Colonel. \n"}, {"text": "Father Mulcahy and Radar arrive at the aid station and retrieve the wounded soldier.  The young man has been wounded in which area of his body?", "correct": "Chest", "options": ["Abdomen", "Head", "Groin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChest.\n\n\tThe soldier has a serious chest wound, according to the sergeant at the aid station.  While Mulcahy and Radar are at the aid station, Radar asks the sergeant if they ever get wounded dogs up there.  The sergeat responds in the negative, but adds that they did have a wounded goat at one point.  When Radar inquires about what happened to the goat, the sergeant replies, 'We ate 'em!' (Radar has a very grave look on his face after this response.) \n"}, {"text": "During their return to the 4077th, Radar and Father Mulcahy notice that the wounded soldier is having difficulties breathing.  They make an emergency call back to the M*A*S*H and the Father is instructed to perform an emergency tracheotomy.  Mulcahy doesn't have a scalpel available, so he is forced to use his pocket knife.  His pocketknife apparently is inscribed with the name of what old movie hero?", "correct": "Tom Mix", "options": ["Hopalong Cassidy", "Zorro", "Tarzan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Mix.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy is a very sentimental man, obviously.  The medical kit that they have on the jeep is not quite up to par for emergency surgery, so the Father is forced to use his Tom Mix pocket knife, which he claims is 'very sharp'. \n"}, {"text": "In order to allow the young man to breathe properly during the surgery, Hawkeye suggests that Radar and Father Mulcahy need to find a small tube to insert in his wind pipe.  What do they end up using for this purpose?", "correct": "Eye dropper", "options": ["Fountain pen", "Syringe", "Straw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEye dropper.\n\n\tRadar asks if a pencil is okay at one point (he's young still).  Father Mulcahy and Potter discuss eye drops earlier in the episode, a foreshadowing of things to come.  The Father is successfully able to cut a notch in the young soldiers upper chest and to insert the tiny eye dropper tube.  'The skin and the tissue seemed to close right in around the tube', according to Mulcahy. \n"}, {"text": "Before Father Mulcahy can begin the emergency surgery he insists on saying a prayer.  Which one does he settle on in this moment of duress?", "correct": "Grace", "options": ["Our Father", "Sign of the Cross", "Hail Mary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrace.\n\n\tFollowing his harrowing experience at the front lines, Fitzsimons develops a new respect for Father Mulcahy.  The penultimate scene shows the reconciliation between the two men.
