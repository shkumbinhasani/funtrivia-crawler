{"id": "378200", "name": "They Have a Finger in Too Many Pies Multiple Choice Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Numbers for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "There are 3 pies and each pie has 4 fingers in it. How many fingers are in these pies?", "correct": "12", "options": ["10", "4", "8"], "explanation": "\n\n\n12.\n\n\tTo find the answer we multiply 3x4. 3x4 = 12 so the answer is 12. \n"}, {"text": "There are 2 pies each with 2 fingers in them. How many fingers are there altogether? ", "correct": "4", "options": ["5", "3", "6"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4.\n\n\tThis time to find the answer you would multiply 2x2 which is 4. You could have also added 2+2 and the answer would have still been 4. \n"}, {"text": "There are 9 pies and each pie has one finger in it. How many fingers are there?", "correct": "9", "options": ["1", "10", "6"], "explanation": "\n\n\n9.\n\n\tTo get this answer you would have multiplied 9x1 which equals 9. Another way you could have figured this problem out since there is only one finger in each pie is to count the fingers by counting the pies. The other thing is that 1 x any number is that number. For example 1x334 = 334. \n"}, {"text": "There are 10 pies and each pie has 3 fingers in it. How many fingers are there?", "correct": "30", "options": ["33", "13", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n30.\n\n\tThis time you would multiply 10x3 and get 30. Multiplying by 10 is easy because all you do is add a 0 to the number you are multiplying, for example 500x10 looks hard but you take 500 add a 0 and get 5000 and that is the answer. \n"}, {"text": "This time there are 6 pies with 2 fingers in each pie. How many fingers are in these pies?", "correct": "12", "options": ["2", "6", "24"], "explanation": "\n\n\n12.\n\n\tTo get the answer this time you multiply 2x6 to get 12. To multiply by twos all you need to do is count by 2's. So if we count by 2's 6 times we get 2,4,6,8,10,12. \n"}, {"text": "There are 5 pies with 9 fingers in each pie. How many fingers are there?", "correct": "45", "options": ["36", "40", "29"], "explanation": "\n\n\n45.\n\n\tThis time multiply 5x9 to get 45. Whenever you multiply by 5 the answer will either end in 5 or 0. \n"}, {"text": "This time there are 8 pies and there are 3 fingers in each pie. How many fingers are there altogether?", "correct": "24", "options": ["11", "12", "25"], "explanation": "\n\n\n24.\n\n\tThis time you would multiply 8x3 to get 24. The sum of the digits of an answer to a problem in which you have multiplied by 3 will add up to a multiple of 3. 24 is our answer and 2+4=6. 6 is a multiple of 3 because 3x2=6. \n"}, {"text": "If we have 7 pies with 6 fingers in each pie how many fingers do we have in total?", "correct": "42", "options": ["45", "13", "1"], "explanation": "\n\n\n42.\n\n\tThis time we multiplied 7x6 and got 42. \r Now for some facts about pie. Pie has been around since ancient Egyptian times. \n"}, {"text": "There are 11 pies and there are 3 fingers in each pie. How many fingers are in the pies?", "correct": "33", "options": ["14", "36", "8"], "explanation": "\n\n\n33.\n\n\tThis time you would multiply 11x3 which equals 33. The first ever published pie recipe was for a goat cheese and honey pie. It was published by a Roman. \n"}, {"text": "This time you have 2 pies and somehow 12 fingers were found in each pie. How many fingers is that?", "correct": "24", "options": ["10", "14", "34"], "explanation": "\n\n\n24.\n\n\tThis time you would multiply 2x12 which equals 24. Meat pies were the pies mostly made in the early days of pies. \n"}]}
