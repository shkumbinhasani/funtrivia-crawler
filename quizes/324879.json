Their numbers have decreased over the last 200 years because they are considered a delicacy. Strangely, Prohibition in the early part of the 20th century may have been their saving grace, in that alcohol was considered vital to a good turtle stew.Most terrapins are found today in the mangrove swamps of Florida where they are a protected species. Other than man, the animal that causes the most threat to terrapins is the raccoon who will scavenge terrapin nests and will also spend the long time required to kill an adult terrapin. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following choices best describes a yellow-bellied sapsucker?", "correct": "woodpecker", "options": ["butterfly", "squirrel", "ant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwoodpecker.\n\n\tA yellow-bellied sapsucker is a woodpecker found in the Caribbean and North and Central America.
