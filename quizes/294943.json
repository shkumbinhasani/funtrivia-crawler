{"id": "294943", "name": "The Minor Prophet Hosea Quiz | Old Testament / Tanakh | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "  Old Testament / Tanakh", " Hosea"], "questions": [{"text": "Whom did Hosea marry?", "correct": "Gomer", "options": ["Genny", "Gail", "Gretchen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGomer.\n\n\tHosea 1:3 \"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.\"\r The name Gomer means \"complete enough\" or \"burning coal\". \n"}, {"text": "What was Hosea's son named?", "correct": "Loammi", "options": ["Levi", "Larry", "Leonard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoammi.\n\n\tHosea 1:9 \"Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.\"\r Loammi means \"not my people.\" His name is symbolic of the Israelites' relationship with God during the time. \n"}, {"text": "What does Hosea say Israel's problem is in Hosea 4:16 (King James Version)?", "correct": "backsliding", "options": ["bad fashion sense", "tax evasion", "bad manners"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbacksliding.\n\n\tHosea 4:16 \"For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.\"\r Backsliding occurs when a person knows what they should do, and they have been doing it and then suddenly they stop. For example, a child may be potty trained and for months or even years they are going on the potty with no problem -- and then suddenly they start going in their pants again. In the case of the Israelites, they knew what God wanted and they were doing it, and then they once again started to live a life that God did not approve of. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Hosea say to \"blow the cornet\"?", "correct": "Gibeah", "options": ["Gilead", "Golgotha", "Galatia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGibeah.\n\n\tHosea 5:8 \"Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.\"\r The name Gibeah means \"a hill\".
