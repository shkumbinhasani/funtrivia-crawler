This tale was conceived by which former gangster-cum-novelist?", "correct": "Harry Grey", "options": ["Zane Grey", "Dorian Grey", "Christian Grey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Grey.\n\n\tThe leading role, that of David 'Noodles' Aaronson, is based on the life of the former prohibition era gangster turned police informant, Herschel Goldberg.  Goldberg adopted the pseudonym Harry Grey in order to protect himself and his family from any reprisals by the crime syndicates that he had written about in the novel. Herschel 'Harry' Goldberg was born in 1901 in either Odessa or Kiev, in what was then Russia, his family emigrating to the United States in 1905. This novel, believed to have been written whilst Goldberg was incarcerated in prison, was published in 1952.  Although most of Grey's novels could be considered best-sellers, 'The Hoods' was by far the most successful of them. Prior to filming, Leone and Grey had met on a number of occasions and those scenes that were set in the bar owned by Moe Gelly as an adult were based on the bar in which the director and Grey had met on order to discuss ideas for the film.  Harry Grey passed away during October 1980; his cause of death was undisclosed. \n"}, {"text": "What did Aaronson and Moe Gelly first discuss on his return to New York?

However, Aaronson considered the letter to be a warning from those who had wished to kill him some 30 years earlier.  He believed that they had always known where he had been hiding and that this letter was a warning that his return to New York would have serious consequences for him. \n"}, {"text": "'Your youngest and strongest will fall by the sword.'

Whilst contemplating, he had noticed a locker key hanging from a hook fixed to a plaque on the wall.

Max and Aaronson had a brief but tense conversation; it was inconceivable that Aaronson would ever harm his friend Max.\r \"Today they ask us to get rid of Joe; tomorrow they ask me to get rid of you,\" said Aaronson pointing at Max. \"Is that OK with you?  'Cause it's not OK with me!\" Aaronson continued.  \rAfter a period of thoughtful silence Max said to Aaronson, \"Wanna to go for a swim?\" \rAaronson nodded, \"Yeah, let's go for a swim\" as he accelerated the car along the pier and crashed through the rails at its end! \n"}, {"text": "\"Well look who's here, it's Fat Moe's Boneyard Boys,\" exclaimed Chicken Joe.

O'Donnell, who had still refused to call off the strike, was about to be burned alive when Max and the gang arrived and bargained for O'Donnell's life; they had also abducted Chicken Joe's boss earlier in the evening.\r \"This country is still growing up. Certain diseases it's better to have while you're still young,\" said Max to the petrol soaked O'Donnell. \"You boys ain't a mild case of the measles, you're the plague!\" retorted O'Donnell angrily before he screwed up his shirt and threw it at Chicken Joe's boss. \n"}, {"text": "Apart from their connection as witnesses in the Bailey Scandal, James Lister and Thomas Finney had what else in common?", "correct": "They both died under suspicious circumstances.", "options": ["They were both former members of Bugsy's gang.", "They were both related to Max.", "Neither were related to Max but they were brothers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey both died under suspicious circumstances.\n\n\tAs witnesses in the case that had become known as the Bailey Scandal, both men were high on the criminal underworld's hit list.
