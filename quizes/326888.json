{"id": "326888", "name": "\"Wheels\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "At which restaurant did Finn nearly get hired?", "correct": "Olive Garden", "options": ["Applebee's", "McDonald's", "Burger King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOlive Garden.\n\n\tThe episode begins with Quinn in the gymnasium watching as the Cheerios practice their newest routine.  Finn walks in and sits next to her and she claims that she needs a good distraction.  This is when she shows him her sonogram bill- $685.  Finn says he tried to get a job at Olive Garden, but they thought he was too tall to be a busboy.  Quinn leaves as she says that he was right, it's too hard to watch the Cheerios, and he needs to get a job to be a man for her and her baby.\rSue Sylvester ends practice with her Cheerios denouncing them for being sloppy and mediocre.  Interviewed by Jacob, the school reporter, she says that she had to let Quinn off the team because of the pregnancy but that they'll win Nationals regardless.  Meanwhile, Will has to talk to Principal Figgins about a handicapable bus so that Artie could travel with the team to Regionals.  Figgins says it's not in the budget.  The only way to get the bus is to find a way to pay for it himself. \n"}, {"text": "Who suggests that the kids hold a bake sale to earn money for the handicapable bus?", "correct": "Will", "options": ["Santana", "Artie", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill.\n\n\tWill gives the kids two pieces of news.  First, he researched past winners of Regionals and found that the judges favored Broadway hits.  His choice for them: \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\".  Kurt is thrilled as he loves the song and play, but Will gives the lead to Rachel (who has the song as her ringtone).  Mercedes also wants to be involved to use her 'chocolate thunder' but Will suggests they give another song to her later.  His other news regards the bus; the kids need to find a way to earn money for Artie to come along.  He suggests a bake sale but the kids claim they're too busy to bake (or, in Brittany's case, she finds the recipes confusing).  Artie claims that he understands and it shouldn't be a problem if he gets his dad to drive, but Will feels bad about their lack of enthusiasm or courtesy.\rArtie uses the auditorium to practice for Glee Club later that day and he performs a version of \"Dancing With Myself\" solo.  Will watches on from offstage. \n"}, {"text": "For how many hours a day must the members of New Directions spend in their wheelchairs?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Five", "One", "Seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThe next meeting, Kurt announces that he would like to audition for Rachel's solo in \"Defying Gravity\", but Will suggests that they find him something other than the female lead with a good high note for him.  Kurt is highly disappointed.  Will also mentions his distaste for the lack of compassion in the other Glee kids as they were going to make Artie get a ride. Artie agrees saying that it hurt his feelings.  Will decides that the club will be holding a bake sale no matter what.  On top of that, he has wheelchairs for everybody- all members must spend three hours a day in a wheelchair...AND they have to organize a wheelchair number. Suffice to say, the kids have a hard time adjusting. \n"}, {"text": "Who speaks to Principal Figgins in regards to Kurt auditioning to sing \"Defying Gravity\"?", "correct": "His father", "options": ["Mercedes", "Rachel", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis father.\n\n\tQuinn ends up going to work baking cupcakes for the bake sale and Puck steps into the kitchen to hand her the rest of his money.  He feels that he should give money for their kid, but Quinn won't let him be a part of it.  Before long, the two of them start playfully throwing ingredients at each other before Finn interrupts them.\rKurt, meanwhile, speaks with his Dad at his auto shop about his day explaining that he's full of ennui about being unable to try out for the \"Defying Gravity\" lead since he's not a girl.  Realizing that his son is down about it, he brings Will to the principal's office to discuss the issue.  Will actually agrees with Burt and later informs Rachel that he will be giving a fair chance to both herself and Kurt.  Kurt makes the kids in Glee vow to vote based on how well they actually sing and not popularity but Rachel remains dissatisfied with Will's diplomatic methods. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Sue add to her cheerleading squad?", "correct": "Becky", "options": ["Mercedes", "Rachel", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecky.\n\n\tFiggins brings both Will and Sue into his office and says that he is very proud of Mr. Schuester for his work with the Glee kids (and the wheelchairs).  Although Will states that he realized that there's only one handicapped ramp in the entire school, Figgins says it's too expensive to have more.  Sue agrees, but Figgins says that she could still learn from Will.  Since Quinn is no longer on the team, she needs to hold open auditions to fill the spot and Will will be the one to decide if the auditions are fair.\rThe kids start selling cupcakes over lunch and Quinn, Puck, Finn, and Santana find it difficult to make anyone buy any- after all, they're in Glee Club and they're in wheelchairs.  They make their first sale to Brittany who purchases a cupcake for her friend, Becky, who has Down Syndrome.  Shortly after, Quinn yells at Finn for his lack of good ideas and he storms off, tossing his wheelchair aside.\rSue holds her Cheerios try-outs in the auditorium with Will and they sit through a number of good and horrible auditions before Becky stands in front and performs her jump-rope routine.  Sue immediately gives Becky the spot on the team, leaving Will wondering what she's up to. \n"}, {"text": "How did Artie come to need his wheelchair?", "correct": "He was in a car accident", "options": ["He had a disorder from birth", "He fell off a building", "He received it from a football injury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was in a car accident.\n\n\tFinn and Puck wheel their way through the halls of the school talking about the baby and Puck criticizes what Finn is doing (or not doing) to earn money for Quinn.  Eventually, the two of them start to fight before Will breaks them up.\rThe night in Glee Club, Artie teaches the kids how to do a double-spin in the chairs.  Will eventually sends them home telling them to prepare themselves for the sing-off between Rachel and Kurt on Thursday.  When they leave, Tina stays behind with Artie and she tells him she didn't think it was so hard to learn to use the wheelchair.  He says you don't think of it that way after a while, kind of like with her stutter.  She asks why he had to get the wheelchair and he says that he was in an accident when he was 8.\rKurt prepares for his audition against Rachel in the choir room by hitting high notes.  While at work, his dad receives a discerning call making fun of Kurt's sexuality.  The two of them discuss this when Kurt arrives at the auto shop. \n"}, {"text": "Who is ultimately the one who is able to find a way to earn money through the bake sale?", "correct": "Puck", "options": ["Finn", "Brittany", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuck.\n\n\tFinn helps Rachel with he wheelchair when one of the wheels is broken and she discusses how she's worried about the 'Diva-off'.  While she wants to sing it for the club since the judges at Regionals are likely to find a female version of the song more accessible, she doesn't think that people like her enough to vote for her.  Finn says that he likes her before Quinn angrily shoves a past due notice in front of him.  She says that if he can't help pay it, they'll go their separate ways.  Finn thinks he's doomed, but Rachel has an idea.\rMeanwhile, the bake sale is a hit.  Will comes by to find business booming.  Santana explains that Puck used a family recipe and the cupcakes are selling like mad.  It turns out that Puck did it to impress Quinn for the sake of the baby.  The recipe was his own concoction- he threw together some cupcakes and threw in some marijuana (courtesy of Sandy).  He lied to get it, of course, by using the wheelchair he had for the week claiming that he was bit by a shark at the aquarium. \n"}, {"text": "Who wins the \"Defying Gravity\" Diva-Off?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Kurt", "Mercedes", "The audition is postponed indefinitely"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tWill spies on Sue training Becky in the auditorium the same way she would train all her other Cheerios- with a lack of motivation and a dose of fear.  When Becky is told to hit the showers, Will confronts Sue saying that Becky is different from other Cheerios.  Sue stops him there saying that Becky wants to be treated like everybody else and that Will may be the one at fault here.  Will tells her that she's still up to something, but Sue responds that he doesn't know the first thing about her.\rThe Diva-Off follows soon after and both Kurt and Rachel take to their spots to perform the \"Wicked\" showtune.  Although many are rooting for Kurt, he ends up not hitting the high note and Rachel wins the lead vocal role. \n"}, {"text": "Finn finds a job in this episode.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tPuck stops Quinn in the hallway and shows her that he's stolen the money from the bake sale for the baby.  He claims that he can get more- he has ambition and he can be a team player, but he wants to support his family.  Quinn takes back her 'Lima-loser' comment but says they can't steal money from a friend in a wheelchair.  Finn shows up in his wheelchair with a gift for Quinn: he got a job and is earning money.  Rachel convinced a restaurant owner to give Finn a job because he's handicapped (or at least looks to be in his wheelchair).  Quinn heads to rehearsal with Finn.\rIt turns out that the Glee kids earned $1,200 from the bake sale!  Will hands the money to Artie but Artie tells everyone that he'd rather use it to build a wheelchair accessible ramp in the auditorium as he won't be the only handicapped kid to come to school at McKinley High.  When Will speaks with Principal Figgins, it turns out that they don't even need to worry about it- Sue has donated enough money to give three wheelchair ramps to the school.  Will can't seem to figure out why.\rSue, meanwhile, heads out to visit her big sister, Jean, in her home.  Jean, like Becky, has Down Syndrome.  Sue spends the evening reading \"Little Red Riding Hood\", her sister's favourite book. \n"}, {"text": "What song ends up being used for the New Directions wheelchair number?", "correct": "Proud Mary", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nProud Mary.\n\n\tArtie and Tina fool around in the empty school hallways in their wheelchairs on their 'date'.  At one point, Tina gets out of her chair to give him his first kiss.  Shortly after this, Tina reveals a secret: she doesn't actually have a stutter; she's been faking it.  She pretended to have one in the sixth grade because she was shy but when she joined Glee she realized what she was missing by pushing people away.  Artie is shocked and leaves her behind in the hallway.\rKurt finds his dad at work and tells him he blew the note.  When he saw his father hurt by the phone call, he couldn't let himself win the Diva-Off.  He assures his father that he'll be fine but that he doesn't want to hurt him because of who he is.\rThe kids close the episode with their wheelchair number.  All of them head to the stage to perform Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Proud Mary\" to support Artie. \n"}]}
