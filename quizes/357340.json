He missed hunting rabbits, one of his favorite hobbies back in England. At the time, it seemed like a great idea to import and then release European rabbits on his land. While he only released 24 rabbits, by the turn of the 20th century there were millions of rabbits wreaking havoc on the ecology of Australia.The weather allowed them to breed all year long and an abundance of food meant they were well fed. They caused millions of dollars in crop damage, as well as being responsible for the loss of topsoil. They are suspected of being one of the most important factors in the loss of indigenous species in Australia.Biological control methods as well as long rabbit-proof fences have been used in an attempt to overcome the devastation caused by this invasive species. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these animals have been released into the Florida Everglades by pet owners who did not know what to do with their unwanted pets?", "correct": "Pythons", "options": ["Peacocks", "Jaguars", "Chimpanzees"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPythons.\n\n\tUnfortunately, some people have thought it was a good idea to release their large snakes, such as boas and pythons, into the Florida Everglades. This was done by people who thought they wanted a large constrictor as a pet and then became overwhelmed when the snake grew into an unmanageable size. These snakes proliferate in the warm Florida swamps, growing even larger, and eating the native species who are unfamiliar with them.They are even attacking alligators, the apex predator of the area. They are showing up in people's yards, looking quite satisfied after making a meal of the homeowner's pet. \n"}, {"text": "Native to Asia, which of the following fish has been introduced to every continent except Antarctica, causing many people to complain fretfully about how they are wreaking havoc on local environments?", "correct": "Common carp", "options": ["Sailfish", "Rainbow trout", "Oarfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommon carp.\n\n\tThe common carp was introduced into Europe about 2,000 years ago where it became an important food source. It was deliberately introduced into both North and South America, as well as Australia, with that idea in mind. Because they are bottom feeders who tear up the sediment in their search for food they have caused serious damage to native bird and fish species around the world.The vegetation consumed by the carp does not fully digest before it is excreted. This causes algae blooms, which can cause major damage to a small lake or river. They are also known to feed on the eggs of other fish causing a reduction in the number of native species. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following animals was not native to North America, but was introduced by European settlers in the 15th century?", "correct": "Pig", "options": ["Horse", "Bison", "Turkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPig.\n\n\tThe wild pig was brought to the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1493. Pigs are intelligent, adaptable animals that are able to live in almost any climate. They were brought to the Americas for food and for sport hunting. The same thing happened in Australia, and for the same reasons. Pigs love to root around in the ground, searching for roots and tubers.They tear up the top soil and destroy the land around them. There are many subspecies of wild pig, each adapted to the area in which it lives. The damage they can cause has led to some species being actively hunted to near extinction, more than once.\n"}, {"text": "At one time, it seemed like a good idea to introduce the Indian mongoose to many islands, for which of the following reasons?", "correct": "To kill native snakes", "options": ["For protection from native wolves", "To raise for fur", "For food"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo kill native snakes.\n\n\tThe Indian mongoose was deliberately introduced to many tropical islands by European settlers in an attempt to control native snakes. This small carnivore will eat anything that it can catch. Many island ecosystems had indigenous species of birds, amphibians, rodents and reptile populations decimated and some populations are now extinct, lost forever. The mongoose was introduced to the Amami-oshima Island in 1979. Since that time, at least seven species have become extinct. The mongoose also carries rabies and the human Leptospira bacterium, which can both be deadly to humans. \n"}, {"text": "What kind of animal is the Nile perch, one of the most devastating invasive species on the planet?", "correct": "Fish", "options": ["Bird", "Rat", "Snake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFish.\n\n\tThe Nile perch is a very large fish that makes its home in many of Africa's freshwater lakes. It can grow as large as 440lbs (200kg) and as long as six ft (almost 2m). It was found naturally in many areas of northern Africa where it was an important food source for the indigenous populations who lived in the area.The Nile perch was deliberately introduced into Lake Victoria in Uganda in 1954. At the time it seemed like a good idea to bring this fish in as it grows quickly, is very adaptable, and would bring in tourist dollars from those who wished to catch large fish. Since it was introduced, its presence has played a part in the extinction of more than 200 species of plants and animals endemic to the area.The Nile perch can be a fearsome predator who will eat anything small enough to fit into its mouth. The aquatic animals it did not eat, often starved to death because of competition for the remaining food. This fish has recently shown up in Australian lakes where heavy penalties have been enacted in an attempt to keep the fresh water lakes of Australia free from this fish. \n"}, {"text": "The coypu is an invasive species of rodent that causes the most damage in which of the following ways?", "correct": "Habitat destruction", "options": ["It spreads the plague", "It excretes toxic feces", "It has a call loud enough to deafen other animals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHabitat destruction.\n\n\tThe coypu is a large semi-aquatic rodent which originated in South America. Businessmen in Europe, Asia, and North America thought it would be a good idea to bring these animals into different continents in an effort to raise the animals for their warm fur, even though it was known to be a difficult animal to keep in captivity.As soon as the coypu started escaping they started destroying the native habitats around them. They tear up river banks, dykes and irrigation facilities. This ruins the nesting grounds of local animals, kills off the vegetation eaten by local herbivores, and causes the flooding of nests and nearby areas.Their activities have affected the local ecology in areas all over the world. \n"}, {"text": "Don't croak when I ask you what kind of invasive species is the Rana catesbeiana?", "correct": "The American bullfrog", "options": ["The Arctic tern", "The Norway rat", "The Texas jackalope"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe American bullfrog.\n\n\tThe Rana catesbeiana is more commonly known as the American bullfrog. It has been introduced to over forty different countries of the world on four continents. The importation of these frogs was done when someone thought it would be a good idea to make a frog farm. Frog legs are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world.They escaped easily and reproduce quickly. These amphibians are responsible for outbreaks of the chytrid fungus which causes death among local amphibian populations. They are also formidable competitors for the native food species, endangering local populations of fish, snakes, birds, and rodents.Many countries have enacted laws against further introductions of the animal and have started to attempt eradication of those bullfrogs found within their boundaries. \n"}, {"text": "The common house cat has caused the extinction of many island inhabitants where it has been introduced.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIslands have delicate ecosystems that can be severely damaged by the introduction of even one new species. Felis catus, otherwise known as the house cat was domesticated by humans c. 3,000 years ago. Their value as rodent hunters have led to them being used in many parts of the world. The colonization of many of the world's islands by European settlers usually meant the introduction of the cat. Island species of birds, which evolved in areas without predators, often did not perceive the cat as a threat and were easily hunted to extinction. \n"}, {"text": "The deliberate introduction of the brown tree snake led to high levels of starvation and cannibalism on Easter Island in the 15th century. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe introduction of the housecat has wreaked havoc on many islands of the world. That being said, the starvation and cannibalism that took place on Easter Island was caused by a different animal. The ecosystem of that island was ruined by the human animal. The deliberate destruction of the trees of the island led to the inability to make boats with which to fish, led to land erosion, and should serve as a warning to us all. \n"}]}
