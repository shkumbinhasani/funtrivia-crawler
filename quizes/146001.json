{"id": "146001", "name": "'Ben Hur', Part I Online Trivia | Ben Hur . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Ben Hur"], "questions": [{"text": "We all know the title of this multiple Oscar winning film, but what is the subtitle of 'Ben Hur'?", "correct": "A Tale of the Christ", "options": ["A Man Who Became a Legend", "Jewish Prince, Roman Warrior", "A Story of Our Lord"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Tale of the Christ.\n\n\tThis title is from the book upon which the film is based, 'Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ'.  The tale of Christ is the subtext that runs through the entire film.  The beginning of the film features the birth of Christ, while at the end we see Christ being crucified as Ben Hur looks on.  Though not made completely clear in the film, Ben Hur is supposed to be converted from Judaism to Christianity by the end of the film. \n"}, {"text": "Upon which U.S. Civil War General's work is the story behind the film 'Ben Hur' based?", "correct": "Lewis Wallace", "options": ["Thomas Sweeny", "Philip Sheridan", "John Logan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLewis Wallace.\n\n\tLew Wallace was a General from Indiana who fought for the Union side during the U.S. Civil War.  He wrote his very popular novel 'Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ' in 1880, and is now more well-known for it than for his exploits during the war.  During his lifetime, he saw his book become a very popular stage hit, but never saw it come to life in the cinema (he died in 1907). \n"}, {"text": "'Ben Hur' was nominated for 12 Oscars, and won 11 times!  In which category did the film fail to win an Academy Award?", "correct": "Best Screenplay", "options": ["Best Supporting Actor", "Best Actor", "Best Director"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBest Screenplay.\n\n\tWhile William Wyler won for Best Director, Charlton Heston and Hugh Griffith won for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively.  Karl Tunberg failed to win for his screenplay, and there is an interesting story behind why this is so.  Apparently, Wyler had difficulty finding a quality screenplay, and sifted through over 40 before finally settling on Tunberg's.  Wyler thought the screenplay, based on Wallace's book, of course, still needed much fine tuning, so he selected Gore Vidal to improve the quality of the dialogue. After disagreements on tone and style between Wyler and Vidal (Vidal insisted on creating a homoerotic air between the Ben Hur and the Messala characters), Wyler turned to Christopher Fry, who completed the screen writing. Unfortunately, the studio failed to recognize either Fry or Vidal's work, and gave the credit solely to Tunberg.  Wyler protested and lobbied for Fry, but the die had already been cast.  \n"}, {"text": "At the beginning of the film we see a Roman legion marching toward Jerusalem.  A change in command for the Roman troops in Judaea has been ordered by the Emperor.  Who will be the new commander of the garrison?", "correct": "Messala", "options": ["Flavius", "Drusus", "Septimius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMessala.\n\n\tMessala, played by Stephen Boyd, will be the young and ambitious new commander of the Roman legion in Jerusalem.  It so happens that Messala is an old friend of our hero, Judah Ben Hur.  Soon after Messala accepts command from the battle-weary Sextus, he meets with his old friend...and the rivalry begins! \n"}, {"text": "We soon meet our hero, Ben Hur.  What is Ben Hur's given name?", "correct": "Judah", "options": ["Solomon", "Israel", "David"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJudah.\n\n\tIt might be important to note at this point that there Judah Ben Hur is not an historic person, but rather a hero made up by Wallace to represent the repressed Jewish population under Roman rule.  We find that Judah Ben Hur is a devoted religious man and a patriot, both anathema to his friend Messala, who insists on his friend's loyalty to the Roman Empire. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur lives in Jerusalem in a stately home with which two relatives?", "correct": "Mother and sister", "options": ["Mother and brother", "Father and sister", "Father and brother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMother and sister.\n\n\tBen Hur's sister is called Tirzah (played by Cathy O'Donnell, sister-in-law of Wyler) and his mother is Miriam (portrayed by Martha Scott). \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur's family is a rather wealthy trading clan of Judaea.  The family business is run by a steward named Simonides.  Simonides has a beautiful daughter who is the slave property of the house of Hur.  What is her name?  ", "correct": "Esther", "options": ["Ann", "Ruth", "Elizabeth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEsther.\n\n\tEsther is portrayed by Haya Harareet, the only Israeli national among the cast (she was born in Haifa, Palestine, in 1931).  This was only one of seven films in which she made an appearance. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur is engaged to be married early on in the film.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIndeed not.  Rather, his servant Esther is engaged to a trader from Antioch named David.  Fortunately for Ben Hur, she is taken by her master from the time she first set eyes on him and decides not to marry.  The feeling is requited. \n"}, {"text": "For what seemingly insignificant action are Ben Hur and his entire family imprisoned by the Romans?", "correct": "Accidentally dropping a piece of tile from a rooftop", "options": ["Purchasing food from a 'Romans only' grocery area", "Knocking over a small statue in the local forum", "Practicing their religion on a Roman holiday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAccidentally dropping a piece of tile from a rooftop.\n\n\tBen Hur and his sister Tirzah gaze from their rooftop as the new governor marches into Jerusalem.  Unfortunately, a couple of tiles give way on the roof under Tirzah's hands, hitting the road below.  The governor is knocked off of his horse, but lives.  Messala sees this as his opportunity to teach the recalcitrant Jews a lesson, and imprisons Tirzah and Miriam.  Ben Hur is sent to the galleys. \n"}, {"text": "On his way to the slave galley, where he will become a rower, Ben Hur encounters Jesus Christ for the first time.  What is the nature of their meeting?", "correct": "Christ gives water to Ben Hur", "options": ["Ben Hur views Christ giving a sermon upon a hillock", "Christ gives Ben Hur a morsel of food", "Christ blesses Ben Hur along the path through Nazareth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChrist gives water to Ben Hur.\n\n\tWe never see the face of the actor, Claude Heater, who portrays Christ in the film, he only appears from behind.  While Ben Hur is marched to the galley, Christ administers some water to our fallen hero in defiance of the Roman guards.  The guard who commands that the prisoners be given no water seems overawed by Christ's presence.\r Thank you for having tried this first installment, please feel free to try the other quizzes in this series. \n"}]}
