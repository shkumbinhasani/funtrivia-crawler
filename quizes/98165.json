What was his reign name?  \n", "correct": "Wanli", "options": ["Tongzhi", "Yongle", "Hongwu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWanli.\n\n\tWanli spent the last several decades of his reign holed up in his Forbidden City, neglecting his responsibilities and allowing the more aggressive of his eunuchs to assert much more power than was usually the case, especially during the Ming period. \n"}, {"text": "As was the case during several Chinese dynasties, interference in government affairs by eunuchs caused conflict among the ranks of the official bureaucracy.  A very corrupt example could be found in this man, who rose from food taster of an imperial concubine to a dominant position in the imperial court during the 1620s.  What was this eunuch's name?  \n", "correct": "Wei Zhongxian", "options": ["Fang Lizhi", "Heshen", "Chen Yonggui"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWei Zhongxian.\n\n\tWei was food-taster to the concubine of Emperor Wanli's son, and eventually came to dominate the court of his grandson.  Wei went so far as to have temples built throughout China celebrating his greatness! \n"}, {"text": "In the 1590s, the Ming economy was already under strain from having to pay tributes to Mongol tribes in order to prevent them from invading from the north and from other public works.  Great additional expenditures were required to fight a war against the Japanese beginning in 1592.  The bulk of this war took place in which of these areas?  \n", "correct": "Korea", "options": ["Japan", "Manchuria", "China Proper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKorea.\n\n\tJapanese forces, led by their new Shogun invaded Korea in 1592 with the intention of adding the peninsula as a colony.  The Chinese surprise attacked the Japanese near Pyongyang later in that year, but were defeated.  However, their second attempt to remove the Japanese was more successful the following year and the Japanese were forced to a standoff at Seoul. The standoff continued until 1598, when the Japanese withdrew from Korea and sued for peace, something the Chinese were happy to negotiate having spent nearly 20 million taels over the course of the war.  These expenditures nearly bankrupted the imperial treasury. \n"}, {"text": "Along with the official Japanese threat, other seaborn threats persisted in the south of China, led by Japanese-born pirates.  What was the pejorative term given to describe these pirates?  \n", "correct": "Wokou", "options": ["Dugong", "Fenggeng", "Putou"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWokou.\n\n\tWokou (or wako in Japanese) means 'dwarf', apparently describing their diminutive stature.  Many of these pirates were Chinese by birth, and in actuality the crews of these ships were often international in nature.  The most threatened Chinese province was Fujian, across the strait from Taiwan.  Pirates continued to plague the south China coast well into the Qing period and some piracy still exists even today in the South China Sea! \n"}, {"text": "Factionalism became a major problem during the latter years of the Ming dynasty.  Many scholars during this period were prone to reject the strictly traditional scholastic system that had remained fairly static for the past several centuries.  They turned toward the philosophy of an early Ming philosopher who had espoused and endorsed a kind of intellectual eclecticism that was anathema to conservative officialdom.  What was this philosopher's name?  \n", "correct": "Wang Yangming", "options": ["Zhu Xi", "Ou Yangxiu", "Wang Anshi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWang Yangming.\n\n\tWang had developed a system of thought that had seemingly created an amalgam between the strict temporal Confucian idea system and the metaphysical world of Taoism and Buddhism.  Wang said, 'To learn simply means to learn to follow innate knowledge.'  A very dangerous idea indeed! \n"}, {"text": "To combat the trend of scholarly eclecticism, a group of ex-officials who had been dismissed from their positions as a result of factional infighting came together in 1604 to create the Donglin Society.  How does 'Donglin' translate into English?  \n", "correct": "Eastern Forest", "options": ["Peach Garden", "Southern City", "Red Pagoda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEastern Forest.\n\n\tThe Donglin scholars quickly rounded up large-scale support for their crusade to remove the corrupt influences in the imperial bureaucracy.  Unfortunately, they came into direct conflict with the eunuch Wei Zhongxian during the early 1620s.  Wei systematically removed the Donglin threat through Machiavellian means, even having one senior official beaten to death in the imperial court with the weak emperor's tacit consent.  By 1624 the Donglin faction had been defeated, but the imperial bureaucracy had been decimated in the process.  Wei himself committed suicide after having been condemned in 1627 much like Robespierre had fallen during the Reign of Terror. \n"}, {"text": "Another major problem that plagued China during late Ming times was the inability of officialdom to cope with increasing problems such as natural disaster and famine.  One such famine occurred in Shaanxi province, located quite a distance from the capital, during the late 1620s.  The inability of local officials to deal effectively with the famine led in part to rebellion in the area.  One of the leaders of this rebellion went on to lead a national rebellion that culminated in the felling of the Ming royal house.  Who was this ambitious individual of plebeian origin that engineered the downfall of the Ming?  \n", "correct": "Li Zicheng", "options": ["Liang Qichao", "Lin Zexu", "Kang Youwei"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLi Zicheng.\n\n\tLi Zicheng was an unemployed postal employee from a rural village in Shaanxi.  In short order he was able to take nearby Hubei, Henan and Shanxi provinces, and finally captured Beijing itself in 1644.  His new empire was called 'Dashun', which means 'Great Region of Obedience'. \n"}, {"text": "While peasant rebellion developed in the west, northeast of China the Manchus began to stir.  Prior to becoming the 'Manchu' people, these tribes were known as what?  \n", "correct": "J\u00fcrchen", "options": ["Xiong N\u00fc", "Pags Pa", "Tartar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJ\u00fcrchen.\n\n\tThe J\u00fcrchen had come to power once before in China during the 12th century when they ruled over northern China under the dynastic title 'Jin'.  Defeated and subjugated by the Mongols, the J\u00fcrchen were finally able to reorganize themselves and relieve themselves of Mongol dominance during the 16th century.  By the early 17th century the Manchu banners (signified by 8 colored flags) were well-organized and conquest became the goal of the leadership. \n"}, {"text": "Around 1610, the leader of the Manchus, Nurhaci, broke off relations with the Ming and began to assert dominance over the entirety of the area now called Manchuria.  It was Nurhaci's 8th son, Hong Taiji, who would lead a supremely organized force in conquering China for the Manchus, beginning in 1643.  Unfortunately, he died before the conquest could be completed and his brother Dorgan took over as regent, accomplishing the crowning of Hong Taiji's son the next year.  When this boy, grandson to Nurhaci, became the emperor of the newly formed 'Qing' (meaning 'pure') dynasty, what reign name did he take?  \n", "correct": "Shunzhi", "options": ["Yongzheng", "Kangxi", "Qianlong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShunzhi.\n\n\t'Shunzhi' means 'obedient rule', probably a term used to undermine Li Zicheng's authority...recall that Li had also chosen the 'shun' symbol in his reign name. \n"}, {"text": "In order for the Manchus to enter China proper in 1644, they would have to approach through the Shanhaiguan pass in northern Hebei province.  A certain Ming general, commander of the powerful northern army, was forced at this point to make his fateful decision.  Should he serve under the rebellious forces led by a peasant (see question 7) or under the Manchu 'barbarians'.  What was this general's name?  \n", "correct": "Wu Sangui", "options": ["Li Sao", "Zhang Chenggong", "Li Hongzhang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWu Sangui.\n\n\tWu's fateful decision to allow the Manchus through the Shanhaiguan, which lead to Li Zicheng's quick defeat, helped dictate the nature of the next 270 years of Chinese history.  Henceforth China would be under the rule of the 'foreign' Manchus, which caused resentment and frustration amongst many Ming loyalists for years to come.  In fact, Wu Sangui himself eventually rebelled against the Qing, even after having been given a free hand to command Guizhou province in the far south.  The Qing would eventually prove victorious and would rule China until 1911. \n"}]}
