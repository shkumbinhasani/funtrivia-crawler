{"id": "266741", "name": "The Ultimate \"Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly\" (PS2) Quiz |   Video Games", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games Q-S", "Spyro"], "questions": [{"text": "Throughout the game there are several challenges.  Of these include the electricity, fire and ice challenges.  How many are there in the challenge you do to receive a dragonfly?", "correct": "Eight", "options": ["Six", "Four", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight.\n\n\tGenerally, there are eight.  This changes, however, during challenges like destroying all the clouds over the water in \"Cloud 9\".  You must electrify metal poles for the electricity, flame scarecrows for the fire, and put out campfires for the ice challenges. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following was not a dragonfly name?", "correct": "Sparks", "options": ["Amy", "John", "Tashistation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSparks.\n\n\tJohn, Amy, and Tashistation are all baby dragonflies.  This game is all about you capturing baby dragonflies.  Sparks is not actually a dragonfly, as it is Sparx.  Watch your spelling! \n"}, {"text": "Spyro finds many Speedways along the way.  In which of the following levels did a Speedway NOT appear?", "correct": "Monkey Monastery", "options": ["Cloud 9", "Dragonfly Dojo", "Thieves Den"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonkey Monastery.\n\n\tSpeedways are found in several levels.  \"Dragonfly Dojo's\" Speedway is the first Speedway you come to in the game.  \"Oasis Speedway\" is found in the \"Thieves Den,\" and you must ride a platform to get to the Speedway in \"Cloud 9,\" located on the roof of the beginning of the level. \n"}, {"text": "How many thieves, other than good thieves, appear in this game?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "Two", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThere are only three.  The first is found in \"Cloud 9,\" with a staff to activate spirals.  The second is in \"Honey Marsh,\" running around near the first portal.  The third is in the lava in \"Jurassic Jungle.\" \n"}, {"text": "How many gems are in \"Jurassic Jungle\"?", "correct": "Six hundred", "options": ["None", "Seven hundred", "Eight hundred"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix hundred.\n\n\t\"Jurassic Jungle\" is the very last level of the game.  It takes 65 dragonflies to activate.  Watch out for the dinosaurs, they are tough to beat. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Monkey Monastery,\" is Bentley one of the Yetis you save?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAlthough Bentley is the big brother to Bartholomew, you never actually save him.  We don't know where he is in this level, but his brother lives in the Yeti house.  He rewards Spyro with a dragonfly once you free all the yetis. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not something Ripto uses as an attack?", "correct": "Electric balls", "options": ["Hitting the ground with his sceptor", "Fire balls", "Ice balls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElectric balls.\n\n\tThe first part of Ripto is ice.  You must continuously flame him until all his ice is gone, then once more for good.  The second time you must ice him until all his fire is gone, then once more for good.  The third and final time, he grows even larger, and hits the ground with his sceptor.  You must jump when he does this, then run away when he tries throwing more ice balls at you. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not an actual enemy that attacks?", "correct": "Gems from \"Thieves Den\"", "options": ["Space Cow", "Thunder Clouds", "Tourist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGems from \"Thieves Den\".\n\n\tNotice the question asked for the enemy that doesn't attack.  Gems and gem boxes run away, but they don't actually attack, yet they are considered an enemy.  Space Cows are found in \"Crop Circle Country\", Tourists are found in \"Luau Island,\" and Thunder Clouds are found in \"Cloud 9\".  Tourists are real cute when you near them.  They say hello before sniffing the ground.  If you dilly dally too long, they do finally attack, but it takes a while.  Space Cows are also in \"Spyro: Ripto's Rage.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a percentage you must have complete in order to fight Ripto?", "correct": "Fifty percent", "options": ["One hundred percent", "Seventy percent", "Eighty-five percent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFifty percent.\n\n\tAlthough there is a video with Ripto at the 50% mark, you do not actually fight him until the 70% mark.  Ripto uses his staff to fight you, and when it fails, he gets mad at himself for trusting (and failing using) his staff in two whole different games.  Then comes a video saying you completed everything. \n"}, {"text": "Which is a colored dragonfly that you capture throughout the game?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Yellow", "Green", "Blue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tYou also capture red dragonflies.  There are ten dragonflies in each level, giving a total of ninety dragonflies. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a type of slide?", "correct": "Electric Slide", "options": ["Rock Slide", "Honey Slide", "Ice Slide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElectric Slide.\n\n\tThere is no such slide as the electric slide, at least not for Spyro.  The Honey Slide is found in, you guessed it, \"Honey Marsh\", the Rock Slide is in \"Jurassic Jungle\", and the Ice Slide in \"Monkey Monastery\". \n"}, {"text": "How many mantarays do you catch in order to win during Hunter's challenge in \"Luau Island\"?", "correct": "Eleven", "options": ["Ten", "Eight", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEleven.\n\n\tInterestingly, if you catch eleven before the time runs out you automatically win.  Watch out for the octopi, though.  They are everywhere, and they squirt ink! \n"}, {"text": "During your first trip to \"Dragonfly Dojo\", how many dragonflies can you capture?", "correct": "Nine", "options": ["All of them", "Eight", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine.\n\n\tDuring your first trip, you can only capture nine dragonflies.  The tenth dragonfly is a reward for getting all three kites.  It is impossible to accomplish this task until you get ice breath, found in \"Cloud 9\". \n"}, {"text": "Ripto's cape is what color?", "correct": "Purple", "options": ["Blue", "Red", "Multicolored, made of dragonfly skins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPurple.\n\n\tRipto's cape is not made of dragonfly skins, as he loses them all near the beginning of the game.  His scepter had been acting pretty weird.  Ripto is short, so he gets teased a lot. \n"}, {"text": "Which are not actually good guys that activate a portal for you to get to their land?", "correct": "Yetis", "options": ["Thieves", "Pigs", "Bears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYetis.\n\n\tAlthough there are Yetis in \"Monkey Monastery\", they don't actually help you get to a level; monkeys do.  A pig helps you to \"Luau Island\", a thief helps you to \"Thieves Den\", and a bear helps you to \"Cloud 9\". \n"}]}
