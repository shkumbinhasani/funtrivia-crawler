{"id": "338336", "name": "Heraldry of Great Britain and the Commonwealth 2 Quiz | World | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Flags and Symbols"], "questions": [{"text": "'A silver shield, its field decorated with three smaller shield-shaped objects coloured red'... Using the correct language, how should these arms be described?", "correct": "Argent, three escutcheons gules", "options": ["Argent, a chief indented sable", "Or, two bars dancetty vert", "Azure, a bend or"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArgent, three escutcheons gules.\n\n\tThe colour silver, argent in heraldic language, is often represented in white. The escutcheon is the metal boss that is usually positioned at, or near to, the centre of the shield and provides a fixing point for the handle on the reverse side. These bosses were frequently of a similar shape to the shield itself. The description 'Argent, a chief indented sable' describes a silver shield with a thick black band at the top, the chief, and having its lower edge in a zig-zagged  pattern.  \rThe description 'Azure, a bend or' is simply a blue shield with a golden diagonal band from top left to bottom right.  A stripe in the alternate direction - bottom left to top right - would be described as 'a bend sinister'.  \rThe final example 'Or, two bars dancetty vert' describes a golden shield bearing two green zig-zag bars across its face. \n"}, {"text": "As well as a number of colours, or tinctures, heraldry also uses representations of two types of animal furs, these being known as ermine and vair. What part of the living animal do the dots on ermine represent?", "correct": "The tail", "options": ["The ears", "The feet", "The eyes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe tail.\n\n\tIn the ermine group of furs the tail markings come in various forms. In the most common form these dots look very similar to arrowheads. The ermine group are also used in four different colourways: black dots on white are known as ermine, white dots on black are ermines, black dots on gold are called erminois and gold dots on black are called pean.\rIn the vair group, the blue and white pattern represents alternately placed back and belly skins of the squirrel, specifically the grey squirrel. There are a number of variations to this pattern and the pieces may be rounded or angular in form.\rAny object or figure that is represented in heraldry in its natural or normal colour is described using the word proper, abbreviated ppr. \n"}, {"text": "The features of a shield of arms are described in a very specific order. What is always the first feature described?", "correct": "The surface, or field, of the shield", "options": ["Marks of Cadency", "The Principal Charge", "The Crest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe surface, or field, of the shield.\n\n\tThe order that the features of a shield of arms are described can be very complex, but for the sake of being as simplistic as possible it is as follows.\rFirstly, the main face of the shield, however many colours or tinctures it may consist of.  \rSecondly, the principal charge resting immediately on the surface and occupying the central, most commanding position.\rThirdly, any secondary charges on this same surface.\rAfter this we describe any objects placed on any of the previously mentioned charges.\rNext are any important charges that do not occupy a central position - a chief, canton or bordure for example.\rThese are followed by any objects placed on these charges and finally a description of any marks of cadency that may be present.\r There... I never said it was simple! \n"}, {"text": "In an uncoloured drawing or representation of arms, different metals and colours are shown as a system of dots and hatching, a method that was introduced during the 17th Century. What is the name given to these sketched drawings?", "correct": "A Trick", "options": ["A Yarn", "A Joke", "A Sketch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Trick.\n\n\tThis method of displaying arms is not as widely used today as it has been in the past. Modern heralds usually prefer to leave uncoloured drawings in outline, only using solid black where it appears in the arms.  In tricking, tinctures are indicated using abbreviations and charges are indicated by numbers. \n"}, {"text": "This charge, one of the simplest forms of decoration, is formed by two horizontal lines that contain the central region of the shield. Normally occupying one third of the area of the shield, what is this ordinary known as?", "correct": "The fess", "options": ["The pall", "The bend", "The chevron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe fess.\n\n\tThe fess, a single broad stripe across the central portion of the shield and usually occupying one third of the total area, should not be confused with another similar ordinary known as the bar. Bars are normally narrower than the fess, are considered to be a diminutive form of the fess and are seldom found singly on arms unless they are used in combination with another ordinary.  Groups of bars must be placed in such a way that the field shows above, below and between them. They are never placed at the top edge of the shield as this would be no more than a narrow chief. \n"}, {"text": "This ordinary is formed by two vertical lines that enclose the central area of the shield. By what name is this ordinary known?", "correct": "The pale", "options": ["The bar", "The cross", "The pallet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe pale.\n\n\tIn a similar manner to the fess, the pale is formed by two vertical lines that encompass the central portion of the shield. Like bars, two or more palewise stripes are known as pallets. Another palewise but very narrow stripe is called an endorse and these are usually found on the field in pairs enclosing another charge. \n"}, {"text": "Another ordinary, this area of the shield is contained within two diagonal lines that run from the dexter chief across the shield to its sinister base (remember that left and right in heraldry are taken from the viewpoint of the person behind the shield). By what name is this ordinary known?", "correct": "The bend", "options": ["The pile", "The saltire", "The fylfot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bend.\n\n\tTwo or more bends may be blazoned on a shield. If three or more are displayed then they should be termed bendlets. An even narrower version of the bendlet is called a cotise; for example a bend contained within two cotises would be termed a bend cotised, double cotised if contained by two on each side. A single cotise was known as a baston or a riband but a cotise couped (cut short so that its ends do not reach the edges of the shield) is known as a baton.\rA bend that runs in the opposite direction (from sinister chief to dexter base) is known as a bend sinister.\rAny charges that are placed on either a bend or bend sinister slope with it unless specified to the contrary in the blazon. \n"}, {"text": "A widely used ordinary, primarily because of its religious connotation was a form of cross known as the saltire. There are two saltires that appear on the union flag of Great Britain. Which two saints do these saltires represent?", "correct": "Saint Andrew and Saint Patrick", "options": ["Saint George and Saint Patrick", "Saint Andrew and Saint David", "Saint George and Saint Christopher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaint Andrew and Saint Patrick.\n\n\tThe union flag of Great Britain is constructed from one cross and two saltires, the Cross of St George representing England, The Saltire of St Andrew representing Scotland and the Saltire of St Patrick for Ireland.  Wales is not represented as it is a principality and is considered to be a part of England... My sincere apolgies to any Welsh players, but I don't make the rules!\rThe correct blazon should read: Azure, the Crosses Saltire of Saint Andrew and Saint Patrick, quarterly per saltire, counterchanged argent and gules, the latter fimbriated of the second, surmounted by the Cross of Saint George of the third, fimbriated as the saltire. \n"}, {"text": "Unless blazoned as reversed, how would you expect to see a chevron represented on a shield of arms?", "correct": "Point in chief", "options": ["Point in base", "Point in sinister", "Point in dexter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoint in chief.\n\n\tContrary to how we are used to seeing chevrons depicted (as badges of rank for example), in heraldry a chevron always has its point in chief (uppermost) unless the blazon states otherwise.  As in the bend, two or more chevrons may be borne on the shield and if there are three or more, they are termed chevronnels. Chevrons and chevronnels are always placed one above the other unless the blazon specifies another arrangement, e.g. interlaced or braced.  In the same manner as the fess and the bend, chevrons may also be cotised or double cotised.  Unlike the bend however, any charges placed on a chevron are placed in an erect manner. \n"}, {"text": "The Royal Arms of Great Britain as we see them today are the culmination of centuries of development. During the reign of which English monarch are these arms considered to have originated?", "correct": "King Richard I", "options": ["King Edward I", "King Henry II", "King Richard II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKing Richard I.\n\n\tRichard I, Richard the Lionheart or Richard Couer de Lion (8th September 1157 - 6th April 1199) was one of England's greatest warrior kings and the first that we have evidence of the systemic and hereditary use of heraldic devices.  Earlier monarchs possessed and made some use of personal marks and badges, but it wasn't until the 13th century that heralds assigned arms to these English monarchs retrospectively. \n"}, {"text": "In the UK, the flag seen flying over any building in which the current monarch is in residence is correctly known as the Royal Standard?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis is an error that is commonly made as this flag should be referred to as the Royal Banner. In correct heraldic terms, a standard is a narrow, tapering flag, sometimes swallow-tailed and often of great length. As a general rule, the higher the rank of the owner, the longer the standard. \n"}, {"text": "The motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto nation\" appears on the arms of which corporate body of the United Kingdom?", "correct": "The British Broadcasting Corporation", "options": ["The United Nations", "The Royal Air Force", "The National Trust"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\tThe BBC was granted arms in 1927. As well as the motto, the arms feature a gold band around a globe representing broadcasting transmission, a lightning bolt symbolising electrical activity and two supporting eagles carrying bugle-horns which are emblems signifying proclamation. The BBC, and especially its World Service, is respected around the world for the truthfulness, fairness and accuracy of its broadcasting. It played a prominent role during the years leading up to the Normandy landings in June 1944 and effectively countered the propaganda of Nazi Germany. \n"}, {"text": "In heraldic terms, where would you be more likely to expect to see a small flag known as a pennon flown?", "correct": "Immediately below the head on a lance", "options": ["From the mast of a ship", "From the crest on a helmet", "From the top of a small house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nImmediately below the head on a lance.\n\n\tA pennon was the personal ensign of a knight. They were always small(ish), pointed or swallow-tailed at the fly and flown immediately beneath the head of a lance. The pennon would be charged with a badge or other armorial device of the knight that bore it and they were frequently fringed in gold. The device on the pennon would often repeat that which was on the shield. \n"}, {"text": "Branches, sprigs and leaves of trees and plants are commonly seen as heraldic charges. Represented on the effigy of Richard II in Westminster Abbey are the leaves, flowers and seed pods of 'Planta genista', the badge from which a dynasty of kings took their name. Which dynasty was this?", "correct": "The Plantagenets", "options": ["The Windsors", "The Tudors", "The Stuarts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Plantagenets.\n\n\tThe Plantagenets, who first ruled in England during the 12th century, were a branch of the Angevins and a royal house founded by Geoffrey of Anjou who was the father of King Henry II of England. Between 1154 and 1485, there were a total of fifteen Plantagenet kings of England, many of which can be considered the greatest of all english kings. These include Richard I, Edward III and Henry V. The dynasty takes its name from the habit of Geoffrey of Anjou wearing a sprig of Planta genista, or Broom, in his hat. \n"}, {"text": "Azure, between three open crowns or an open book proper, leathered gules, garnished and having on the dexter side seven seals gold, and inscribed with the words DOMINUS ILLUMINATIO MEA. To which important and ancient educational body does this blazon refer?", "correct": "The University of Oxford", "options": ["The University of Cambridge", "The London School of Economics", "Paris Sorbonne University"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe University of Oxford.\n\n\tOxford University have been using arms since the middle of the 15th century and the University of Cambridge were granted arms in 1573.  Colleges within these Universities also bear their own arms and these are frequently based on the arms of their founders. \n"}]}
