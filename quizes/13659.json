{"id": "13659", "name": "Country Neighbors Quiz | Names, Maps and Borders | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Names, Maps and Borders", "Borders"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the only country to border both Venezuela and Paraguay?", "correct": "Brazil", "options": ["Colombia", "Chile", "Peru"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrazil.\n\n\tThe only South American countries not to border Brazil are Chile and Ecuador...'tis a big country! \n"}, {"text": "What is the only country to border both Vietnam and Nepal?", "correct": "China", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nChina.\n\n\tChina is the only country to border both Vietnam and Nepal.  Nepal is only bordered by India and China, but India does not touch Vietnam!  Vietnam is bordered by China, Laos and Cambodia. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only country to border both Belize and El Salvador?", "correct": "Guatemala", "options": ["Honduras", "Mexico", "Nicaragua"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuatemala.\n\n\tAs you probably know, Central America is made up of a chain of relatively thin countries.  Guatemala touches a surprising 4 other countries, more than any other Central American nation!  The countries:  Mexico, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these countries borders both Chad and Egypt?", "correct": "Sudan", "options": ["Algeria", "Central African Republic", "Chad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSudan.\n\n\tSudan is the second largest country in Africa, so it's no surprise that it makes the cut here! Libya also borders both countries. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only country to border both France and Spain?", "correct": "Andorra", "options": ["Monaco", "Netherlands", "Portugal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndorra.\n\n\tThis is almost a trick question, but it had to be done.  Spain is only touched by Portugal, France and Andorra, and naturally Portugal does not touch France...so that leaves only one other candidate, tiny Andorra. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only country to border both Lesotho and Swaziland?", "correct": "South Africa", "options": ["Zimbabwe", "Mozambique", "Botswana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSouth Africa.\n\n\tSince Lesotho is surrounded on all sides by South Africa, this one should have been easy...but only if you knew that! \n"}, {"text": "What is the only country to border both Chile and Peru?", "correct": "Bolivia", "options": ["Argentina", "Paraguay", "Brazil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBolivia.\n\n\tRecall back in question 1...Brazil only neglects to touch Chile and Ecuador, ruling that choice out.  Paraguay fails to connect with either Peru or Chile, while Argentina touches Chile plenty, but not Peru. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only country to border both Indonesia and Thailand?", "correct": "Malaysia", "options": ["Philippines", "Singapore", "Myanmar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMalaysia.\n\n\tThis is a tricky one.  Recall that Malaysia is divided into a mainland portion (on the Malay peninsula) and an island portion, on Borneo.  It's on Borneo that Indonesia and Malaysia touch, while on the mainland Malaysia borders Thailand. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only country to border both North Korea and Finland?", "correct": "Russia", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRussia.\n\n\tRussia is one long country...long enough to touch these two other countries that are a continent away.  When in doubt, think Russia! \n"}, {"text": "What is the only country to border both Iraq and Greece?", "correct": "Turkey", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurkey.\n\n\tAnother tricky one.  Turkey has a small portion of the European mainland, controlling both sides of the all-important Bosporus Strait.  Well...I hope you enjoyed this and maybe learned a thing or two.
