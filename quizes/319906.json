{"id": "319906", "name": "\"Acafellas\" Trivia Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Which member of the Glee Club speaks to Mr. Schuester about his choreography early in the episode, saying that he can't really make good moves?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Mercedes", "Quinn", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tOver dinner, Will decides to let his parents know that Terri is pregnant with their first grandson.  Both are ecstatic about the news and congratulate the couple though Terri is disappointed that he told them- they'd planned to keep it a secret.  His parents say that they'll keep their mouths shut before Will's mother goes to check out the baby's prospective nursery with Terri.  Will's father meanwhile decides to speak with his son.  Will says he's terrified, but his dad assures him that every man is, but you need the guts to be a good father.  He once tried to raise money for law school, but never went and he feels that unless you go headfirst into what you want, you'll never get it.\rAt school, Will teaches the kids some new moves for their next number but Rachel stops him in the number.  She claims that they need to hire Stanley, the midwest's greatest choreographer (and director for Vocal Adrenaline) to make moves for the team since Will (while a great vocal coach) isn't that good at choreography.  Although she feels bad about saying this, she was pressured into it by her newly-acquired teammates, the Cheerios Quinn and Santana.  Quinn asks Mr. Schuester if he ever performed after high school and he can't reply to her. \n"}, {"text": "Henri is a teacher at McKinley High.  What class does he instruct?", "correct": "Wood shop", "options": ["German", "Science", "Health"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWood shop.\n\n\tWill has a talk with Emma in her office later on saying that he always wanted to perform after high school, but he never had the guts.  He's also worried about setting a good example for his son.  He apologizes to Emma for unloading his problems on her, but she says it's okay since they're both in relationships now.  Emma says that Ken is pretty flawed, but he's confident.\rWill finds Ken in the staff room with Sandy, who had been banned from the school earlier for the advances he made on students in his Glee Club.  He reiterates his situation.  He is not to be within fifty feet of 'children' at all times.  Regardless, he's in the staff room to visit Henri, the shop teacher who had been off work due to an accident he had in the classroom.  Drinking cough syrup, he had accidentally cut off both of his thumbs with a table saw.  Howard, Terri's co-worker, arrives with a cake and they celebrate his health.  The guys sing \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" around the table and realize that they can actually harmonize well. \n"}, {"text": "When creating a name for Will's new group, which of these was not a candidate?", "correct": "Supranos", "options": ["Crescendudes", "Testostertones", "Acafellas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSupranos.\n\n\tThe group finds themselves at Will's place practicing their moves to the song \"This is How We Do It\" by Montell Jordan.  Will gains more confidence from his newfound hip-hop acapella group and they decide to name themselves 'Acafellas' and actually perform.  While they talk about this, Sandy arrives all dressed up and they're forced to turn him away at the door because when he's in the group, it's creepy.  Before they can get back to rehearsing, Terri forces them to stop claiming that if she doesn't get some sleep, she could miscarry.  Will finds over the next days that their love life has improved due to his confidence, but really Terri wants to ensure that she actually gets pregnant so that he doesn't find out that she really isn't expecting.\rThe Glee Club suffers too.  Rachel tries to apologize for what she said by offering sugar cookies, but Will hasn't gone to most rehearsals.  Will says that what Rachel said opened up his eyes to allow him to create Acafellas, and now he just doesn't have the time to do Glee as much.  Will suggests they hire Dakota Stanley for their choreography.  The Cheerios think this is a great opportunity, but Finn disagrees.  Later, Finn and Rachel argue about confidence issues and Rachel says that they're hiring Stanley with or without him, even if Finn opts to quit Glee Club.\rSue, meanwhile, is pleased with herself.  With the disbandment of Glee Club commencing, she looks forward to buying a new fog machine with her budget. \n"}, {"text": "What song do Will and the guys perform on their first gig?", "correct": "Poison", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoison.\n\n\tMercedes waits in the halls at school watching couples kissing and talking to one another.  When Kurt comes by, he tells her that although Glee Club kids are at the bottom of the social ladder, she shouldn't worry because they're superior anyways.  He then invites her to the mall after school to buy something for when they visit Dakota Stanley.  As Kurt departs, Mercedes is intercepted by Quinn and Santana who suggest that she make a move on him.  Mercedes thinks she isn't his type, but they insist.\rWill and the Acafellas perform \"Poison\" by Bell Biv DeVoe at a bar for some patrons and their friends.  Terri is less-than-thrilled, but everyone else, including Principal Figgins and Emma, are pleased with the performance.  After, Will's father claims that he sold all seventeen copies of the group's CD (\"Meet the Acafellas\") and his mother says that she didn't even need to flash anybody.  They send her off to the bar, stumbling, for coffee while Principal Figgins talks to Will.  He invites the Acafellas to perform during the PTA meeting at the end of the week since the parents are unhappy (they found out that the school has been serving prison food) and the Acafellas are a great attraction to have.  The guys look over a review of their band the next day in the paper to find that they are quite popular.  When Sandy interrupts them, he informs them that Josh Groban is coming to the PTA event on his invitation, but only if he becomes a member of the group.  Also, he's looking for an opening act. \n"}, {"text": "Ken is the first to disband from Will's hip-hop acapella group.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe Glee Club (without Finn and Artie) go to visit Vocal Adrenaline during their rehearsals to speak to Dakota Stanley in Kurt's decked-out car which, as he claims, he got because he swore to his father that he would never again wear form-fitting sweaters that stop at the knee.  Mercedes shows signs of her being interested in Kurt much to the approval of the Cheerios though Rachel and Tina notice it as well.  Soon though, Rachel spots one of the members of Vocal Adrenaline throwing up into a garbage can with another comforting her, but saying she can't back out for anything, whether it be for heat exhaustion or Crohn's Disease, or worse.  Rachel asks to speak to Stanley, but she warns them away saying that he's a monster.\rInside the school auditorium, Vocal Adrenaline practices their new number, \"Mercy\" by Duffy.  After the number, Dakota Stanley forces the students off the stage.  The New Directions kids ask for his services, but he states that he requires $8,000 for rehearsals and a $10,000 bonus if the kids place.\rMeanwhile, Will and Ken practice their dance moves and receive a call from Howard who leaves the band saying it was never his dream.  Emma also informs Ken and Will that Henri took a bottle of cough syrup because of the stress of the performance. \n"}, {"text": "While training for the performance with Will, Puckerman and Finn find it difficult to relax.  What does Will compare dancing to?", "correct": "Baseball", "options": ["Art", "Singing", "Tightrope walking"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaseball.\n\n\tFinn finds Will in his office to tell him that he's quitting Glee too.  Will says he never quit, but Finn insists that he might as well have.  Will tells him to hang in for a little bit longer and he also asks if he's available for Acafellas.  In the gym locker room, Ken tries to find a way to keep the group afloat for his own sake (with Emma) but he's interrupted by Puck who asks if he could be of service since there's a vacancy.  In his mind, Puck recounts the fact that he's got star potential, and because he's fed up with the girls at high school, he's aiming for more mature women.  In effect, he wants to perform at the PTA meeting for the moms.  Ken warns him that he can't screw up because his love life hangs in the balance.\rWill takes the reins with Finn and Puck to ensure they get the dance moves and lyrics down and they find it difficult.  He gets them to relax by likening dancing and performing to baseball.  As long as they don't get too overwhelmed, they can find a way to do it smoothly. \n"}, {"text": "What do the kids in New Directions do to earn money to pay for Dakota Stanley?", "correct": "Car wash", "options": ["Bake sale", "Karaoke", "Swap meet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCar wash.\n\n\tRachel and Tina decide to give Mercedes a 'gayvention' to talk to her about pursuing Kurt despite the fact that he's gay.  Mercedes claims that there's no reason to call him gay simply because he has a fashion sense (but Rachel says he wore a corset to second period).  Mercedes tells the girls that she's not sure if she could ever find a guy, especially one who knows what she's going through in Glee Club like Kurt.\rTo earn money to pay for Dakota Stanley, the kids start a car wash.  Even Sue joins in the ordeal, forcing her Cheerios to participate because she knows that Dakota Stanley will ultimately lead to a blow-up if he mentors the kids.  Mercedes and Kurt spend time polishing his car and she asks them if they can make their relationship official.  Kurt is surprised by this saying that he can't be with her in that way because he loves somebody else.  Mercedes asks if he loves Rachel (though he actually likes Finn) and he admits he does, and has for years.  Mercedes, shocked, picks up a rock and hurls it through his car's windshield before singing Jazmine Sullivan's \"Bust Your Windows\". \n"}, {"text": "When Dakota Stanley gets hired, what does he hand out to the New Directions kids?", "correct": "'Menus'", "options": ["Ropes (to hang themselves with)", "Itineraries", "Receipts"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Menus'.\n\n\tNew Directions earns enough money for Dakota Stanley who arrives at the school to set them up.  Immediately, he cuts Artie since he's not trying hard enough to walk.  Mercedes is cut early on too and Dakota complains that Kurt should stay away from aerosol cans since he can burst into flames at any second. He states that while the other girls are good enough, Rachel needs a nose job and Finn is a 'Frankenteen'.  Tina, Artie, Mercedes, Finn, and Kurt all decide to quit, but before they can leave Rachel fires Dakota Stanley saying that they'll make it as the winners because they're different from the other Glee Clubs out there...and she's taller than Stanley. \n"}, {"text": "Does Josh Groban show up for the PTA assembly like Sandy said he would?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe Acafellas prepare for their big PTA assembly gig and Finn tells Mr. Schuester that he isn't quitting Glee Club anymore.  While Ken puts on mascara and Puck looks forward to the cougars in the audience, Sandy excitedly rushes backstage to tell the guys that Josh Groban did appear.  Soon though, the guys are on stage performing Color Me Badd's \"I Wanna Sex You Up\" for the audience and it goes over quite well. After the show, Josh Groban goes backstage with his bodyguard, Flex, and congratulates the Acafellas on their performance.  He says that he stopped by mainly to see Sandy...and hand him a restraining order. Apparently, Sandy has been emailing him and sending nude photos, giving him locks of hair, writing sonnets, and tracking down his phone numbers.  Despite this, he says the show was \"explosive\". \n"}, {"text": "What punishment does Sue bestow upon Quinn and Santana for failing in their plans to destroy Glee Club?", "correct": "Revoking tanning privileges", "options": ["Doling out half rations during practice", "Donating their spare outfits to high-class animal shelters", "Blindfolding them during practice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRevoking tanning privileges.\n\n\tAfter the concert, Terri admits that she should've been more supportive of Will's 'Acafellas idea'.  They're interrupted by Will's father who can't find his wife.  As it turns out, Josh Groban is still backstage trying to put the moves on her.  As Terri heads to the car, Will's dad tells his son that watching him perform has given him the guts to pursue his own dream of going to law school.  Will admits that he knows he's a teacher, so he's going back to Glee Club and the school having performed his dream.\rAt school the next day, Mercedes apologizes to Kurt for throwing the rock through his windshield.  He also comes clean, admitting that he lied to her about liking Rachel.  He also admits that he's gay, something he'd never told anyone.  She tells him that he shouldn't be afraid of who he is, especially around Glee Club, but he says that he isn't that confident yet.\rSue, meanwhile, takes Quinn and Santana into her office.  Dakota Stanley was fired, Will is back, and everyone is more confident than before.  To express her anger with them, she revokes their tanning privileges for the semester (something that makes Santana run out of the room, crying).  Before she leaves, Quinn sarcastically thanks Ms. Sylvester saying that she learned \"when you believe in yourself, you don't have to bring other people down.\" \n"}]}
