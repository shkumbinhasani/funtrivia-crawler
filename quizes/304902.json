{"id": "304902", "name": "Bible Fs Quiz | Bible Alphabetics | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "Bible Alphabetics", "A-K"], "questions": [{"text": "According to Hebrews 11:6, what must a person have if they are to please God? ", "correct": "Faith", "options": ["Fear of God", "Fellowship", "Forgiveness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaith.\n\n\tHebrews 11:6 says, \"And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.\"  Hebrews 11 is often referred to as the \"Faith Hall of Fame\". In encouraging his readers to remain faithful, the author gives a long list of Bible characters who remained loyal to God during some difficult times in their lives. Verse 6 of this passage refers specifically to Enoch. His story can be read in Genesis 5:21-24. Faith is \"defined\" in the first verse of this chapter as \"being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see\". \n"}, {"text": "On the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said \"do not look somber\" when doing a particular action. What was Jesus talking about?", "correct": "Fasting", "options": ["Foot washing", "Forgiving those who trespass against you", "Faithfully serving others"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFasting.\n\n\tSpiritual fasting is the practice of abstaining from or reducing the intake of food and/or setting aside other activities in order to focus on spiritual concerns.  In the Old Testament the practice was often associated with repentance or seeking God's help in troubled times.  In Jesus' day many religious people were seen to abuse the discipline of fasting by making it an external, empty ritual to show a pretense of piety.In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus condemns this type of fasting which sought to impress men by saying you should fast in a way that seeks a closer relationship with God. (Matthew 6:16-19). \n"}, {"text": "In Galatians chapter five Paul composes a list that includes adultery, murders and hatred.  In the King James Version this list is referred to as the works of the _____.", "correct": "Flesh", "options": ["Fallen", "Faithless", "Fornicators"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlesh.\n\n\tPaul's list includes impurity, idolatry, debauchery, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, and selfish ambitions. In this passage (Galatians 5:19-21) the phrase \"works of the flesh\" which is used in the King James Version is translated as the \"acts of the sinful nature\" in the New International Version. Paul is trying to convince his readers that giving in to whatever their body desires will lead to disobedience to God's will and ultimate destruction. Thus he concludes the Galatians should strive to live as God desires. \n"}, {"text": "In Galatians chapter five Paul composes a list that includes such characteristics as love, joy and peace. What does Paul call these attributes? ", "correct": "Fruit of the Spirit", "options": ["Fruit of the Saved", "Foundations of the Faithful", "Faithfulness of the Followers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFruit of the Spirit.\n\n\tMany Christians believe that the Holy Spirit works within the Christian to develop the above characteristics. Through the Spirit's work they believe that the nature of God begins to be manifested in the life of the believer.  Paul in this chapter is contrasting the \"works of the flesh\" with the \"fruit of the Spirit\" in an attempt to show his readers that being guided by the Spirit of God is better than being guided by one's own sinful nature. \n"}, {"text": "Who kept Paul in prison, hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe?", "correct": "Felix", "options": ["Flatteus", "Festus", "Fred"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFelix.\n\n\tFelix was the Roman procurator of Judea from AD 52 to AD 60. He was known as a ruthless and cruel tyrant.  He was governor when Paul was brought before him in Caesarea after the Apostle was arrested in Jerusalem on charges that he \"brought Greeks into the Temple area\" (Acts 21:28).  Felix prolonged the trial keeping Paul in limited custody hoping he could get a bribe for his release.As a result Paul remained incarcerated for two years. During that time Paul and Felix often talked. On one occasion Paul's discourse about \"righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come\" frightened Felix and he sent him away (Acts 24:25-27). Felix's tyrannical oppression caused Nero to recall him back to Rome.History is silent regarding his fate upon his return. \n"}, {"text": "What leader thought Paul was insane but had not done anything that deserved death or imprisonment? ", "correct": "Festus", "options": ["Felix", "Flatteus", "Fred"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFestus.\n\n\tFestus replaced Felix as Roman procurator of Judea.  Josephus reports that he was a wise and just ruler. In Acts 25 the new governor hears the complaint of Paul's accusers and grants Paul a hearing. Paul, as a Roman citizen, has a right to appeal his case to Caesar and Festus grants the request even though he is not sure what charge to give Paul.He asks for help from King Agrippa, who agrees to hear Paul's case. In the midst of Paul's lengthy defense discourse, Festus interrupts the Apostle saying \"You are out of your mind, Paul! Your great learning is driving you insane\" (Acts 26:24). After Paul is done both Festus and Agrippa agree that Paul had done nothing wrong and could have been set free had he not made his appeal to Caesar.You can read about this incident in Acts 25 and 26. \n"}, {"text": "What was the second plague inflicted upon Egypt because Pharaoh refused to free the Hebrews from slavery?", "correct": "Frogs", "options": ["Fog", "Ferrets", "Fire and brimstone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrogs.\n\n\tBecause of Pharaoh's refusal to free the Hebrews God sent ten plagues upon Egypt. They were, turning water into blood, frogs, gnats, flies, the destruction of livestock, painful boils, hail, locust, and the death of the firstborn.  These events are recorded in Exodus 7-11.  The Bible says that the frogs \"covered the land\" and that they were in the palace, in people's beds, and ovens.After the frogs died they were \"piled in heaps\" and the \"land reeked of them\".  In recalling this event, the Psalmists said that the frogs devastated the Egyptians (Psalm 78:45) and that the land \"teemed with frogs\" and went up into the bedroom of (the) rulers\" (Psalm 105:30). Remarkably, according to the Biblical account, Pharaoh was given the option to end the plague at any time but chose to have the plague continue for another day (Exodus 8:9-10). \n"}, {"text": "With what event is the Bible character Noah usually associated?", "correct": "Flood", "options": ["Famine", "Feasting", "Fasting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlood.\n\n\tGenesis 6-8 relates the story of the Noahic Flood.  According to the Bible, God brought about the flood because of the increasing wickedness of society.  God determined he would destroy the earth and begin again with a new people. Noah and his family were the only ones who remained faithful to the Lord and they became God's means of repopulating the earth after the flood. Scholars who accept the historical account of this flood are divided over whether it was a universal or local flood.  Even today there is great interest in Noah and the ark as archaeologists, geologists, theologians and historians continue to search for evidence that will help solve many of the mysteries surrounding this event.\n"}, {"text": "What did Jesus say he would make Simon (Peter) and his brother Andrew? ", "correct": "Fishers of men", "options": ["Famous", "Faithful followers", "Firstborn of the church"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFishers of men.\n\n\tPeter and Andrew were fishermen by trade. The event where Jesus called them to be \"fishers of men\" (Mark 1:16-18, Matthew 4:18-20) was not the first encounter that he had had with the brothers - the apparent first encounter is recorded in John 1:35-42.  Jesus' play on words expresses the importance of their \"new job\". They no longer will be catching fish but they are commissioned to catch men for the cause of Jesus. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these was presented as a gift to the infant Jesus?", "correct": "Frankincense", "options": ["Flowers (specifically Roses of Sharon)", "Fruit", "Foreknowledge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrankincense.\n\n\tFrankincense is fragrant resin gathered from a certain type of balsam trees. The gum resin is ground into powder and burned to emit a balsam-like aroma. Since this product was imported from southern Arabia it was expensive. It was mixed with other materials to make the incense used for worship in the tabernacle (Exodus 30:34).  It was later used in the manufacturing of perfume and other cosmetics.  Frankincense, along with gold and myrrh, was presented to Jesus by the Magi (Matthew 2:11). \n"}]}
