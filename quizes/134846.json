{"id": "134846", "name": "And Now, For My Next Impression... Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Blazing Saddles"], "questions": [{"text": "One of my favorite scenes in the film involves Sheriff Bart and his sidekick Jim adorned in the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan in order that they may infiltrate Hedley Lamarr's criminal syndicate.  While discussing his criminal qualifications, the color of Bart's skin is noticed by Lamarr and his cronies.  Just before running off, Bart says, 'For my next impression, ____________!'  What person's name goes in the blank?", "correct": "Jesse Owens", "options": ["Edwin Moses", "Carl Lewis", "Jim Thorpe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJesse Owens.\n\n\tThis is, of course, a reference to the great American sprinter of the 1930s, Jesse Owens...who obviously wouldn't have been alive during the 1800s, when \"Blazing Saddles\" is set.  But, this sort of anachronism doesn't seem to matter in a Mel Brooks comedy! \n"}, {"text": "Near the beginning of the film, one of Hedley Lamarr's head lackies, Lyle, ridicules the railroad workers that toil away in the scorching heat.  Lyle is quoted as saying, 'The way you was lolly gagging with them picks and shovels, you would think it was a hundred and twenty degrees out here. Can't be more 'n ______________!'  Which temperature fits the blank?", "correct": "A hundred and fourteen", "options": ["A hundred and ten", "A hundred and four", "A hundred and nineteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA hundred and fourteen.\n\n\tLyle can be quite cruel, especially to the Chinese laborers.  When a Chinese laborer falls down from heat exhaustion he docks the poor fellow a day's pay for 'nappin' on the job.' \n"}, {"text": "Lili Von Shtupp, played marvelously by Madeline Kahn, entertains us with a lovely and plaintive song, describing the rigors of her 'profession'.  What is the first line of lyrics that she sings?", "correct": "Here I am the Goddess of desire", "options": ["Morning, noon, and night, it's dwink and dancing", "Who can satisfy my lustful habits", "Stage door Johnnies constantly suwwound me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHere I am the Goddess of desire.\n\n\tThe first section of the wonderful song 'I'm Tired', with speech impediment fully accounted for, goes:  'Here I stand, the Goddess of desire, set men on fire, I have this power.  Morning, noon, and night, it's dwink and dancing, some quick womancing, and then a shower.  Stage door Johnnies constantly suwwound me, they always hound me, with one wequest.  Who can satisfy their lustful habits? I'm not a wabbit! I need some west.'  That's 'west' as in 'rest', not 'west' as in, 'the opposite of east.' \n"}, {"text": "In a certain scene we see Bart and Jim in the sheriff's office, with Jim consoling poor Sheriff Bart about the ignorance of the townspeople.  Finish the following quote from Jim, 'You've got to remember that these are just simple farmers. These are people of the land. The common clay of the new West. You know, ______.' \n", "correct": "Morons", "options": ["Bumpkins", "Hicks", "Idiots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorons.\n\n\tThis is one of the better gags in the film.  Just when you think the racism of the people of Rock Ridge has gotten the best of Bart, Jim comes back with this zinger.  People always say, the best way to battle hatred is with humor! \n"}, {"text": "In his quest to rid himself of the people of Rock Ridge, Hedley Lamarr attends a meeting Governor William J. Le Petomane, played by Mel Brooks.  During the meeting, what term/phrase signifies agreement amongst the Governor's cronies?", "correct": "Harumph!", "options": ["Aye aye!", "(Grunting sounds)", "Hail the governor!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarumph!.\n\n\tThe proper terminology, according to Governor Le Petomane, is 'harumph!'  When one of his underlings fails to give him a 'harumph', he is terribly offended.  After watching this scene one gets the feeling that Mel Brooks doesn't think highly of politicians... \n"}, {"text": "After Hedley Lamarr says, 'My mind is aglow with whirling, transient nodes of thought careening thru a cosmic vapor of invention!' what is his toady Taggart's response to this?", "correct": "Ditto!", "options": ["Well, sir, you do know your vapors!", "Giddyap!", "(Slackjawed silence)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDitto!.\n\n\tThis, I believe, was the most grandiloquent of Lamarr's utterings in the film.  And his response to Taggart...'Ditto?  Ditto, you provincial putz?!'  Taggart is really salt of the earth, isn't he? \n"}, {"text": "Which character in \"Blazing Saddles\" laments his pitiable situation by claiming that he is 'only pawn in game of life'?", "correct": "Mongo", "options": ["Governor William J. Le Petomane", "Taggart", "Jim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMongo.\n\n\tThe big, bad Mongo is really a misunderstood and gentle creature, who only wishes to have friends.  He's a sucker for candy grams and completely fireproof.  Just beware that your horse doesn't make him upset... \n"}, {"text": "Which cliche, uttered by the unwitting Taggart, is apparently Hedley Lamarr's least favorite?", "correct": "Head them off at the pass!", "options": ["This town ain't big enough for the two of us!", "Ride off into the sunset.", "We don't need no stinking badges!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHead them off at the pass!.\n\n\tWhen Taggart utters this unfortunate phrase, Hedley Lamarr is so upset, he shoots his lackey in the foot!  Imagine his anger if Taggart were to have said, 'Don't worry, be happy.' \n"}, {"text": "Several great musical numbers adorn the film 'Blazing Saddles', including the opening tune.  Fill in the missing word(s) to the beginning of this song: 'He rode a blazing saddle, he wore a shining star, he came to offer battle to _________ near and far!'", "correct": "Bad men", "options": ["Ninnies", "Villains", "Lunkheads"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBad men.\n\n\tThe lyrics to the opening song, entitled 'Blazing Saddles', were cleverly written by Mel Brooks, while the music was written by John Morris.  It was performed by Frankie Laine, who also happened to sing the theme songs for the television shows 'Rawhide', 'Gunslinger' and 'Rango'. \n"}, {"text": "Near the end of the film, the big fight scene in Rock Ridge spills over to another movie set where men in tuxedos and top hats are performing a ridiculous song and dance, led by Dom Deluise.  What is the missing word to this incredible production number that begins, 'Throw out your hands, stick out your tush, hands on your hips, give 'em a push.  Don't be surprised, you're doin' the _______ ...'?", "correct": "French", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrench.\n\n\tWe are never privy to what exactly the 'French Mistake' is, but the Dom Deluise character sure seems to understand!  'Wrong!' he says, as he expertly goes through the motions of the absurd number, followed by a near dip in a fountain.  I suppose we'll leave the meaning behind the 'French Mistake' to Mel Brooks.  Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed a look back at a fantastic comedy. \n"}]}
