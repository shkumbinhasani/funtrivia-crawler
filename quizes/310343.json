{"id": "310343", "name": "\"Two Cars in Every Garage...\" Quiz | 'Simpsons' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Simpsons", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "Who catches the three-eyed fish in the first place?", "correct": "Bart", "options": ["Lisa", "Homer", "Milhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBart.\n\n\tThis episode opens with Bart and Lisa fishing on the shores of a river.  A man stops his car and walks down tot he shore to greet them.  After he says he's an investigative reporter on the road looking for a new scoop, Bart reels in a big fish.  When he pulls it above the water, the three discover that the fish has been horrible mutated; it has three eyes. The reporter looks downstream and sees the looming Nuclear Power Plant in the distance and features it as an article in the Springfield Shopper.  As a result, Governor Bailey calls for an investigation of the plant and its safety.  Marge claims this is a great idea but Homer states that if he were Governor, he'd focus on more important issues like splitting up President's Day into two separate paid holidays. \n"}, {"text": "When the safety inspection team arrives at the Nuclear Plant, what is one thing that they do not discover?", "correct": "Showers use the same water as used to cool plutonium rods", "options": ["Gum used to seal crack in cooling tower", "Plutonium rod used as paperweight", "The site is oversaturated with radiation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShowers use the same water as used to cool plutonium rods.\n\n\tMr. Burns warns the employees of the plant not to slip up as the inspection van rolls into the parking lot.  When Mr. Burns greets the team, they turn their Geiger counters on to discover the feedback of overwhelming radiation levels.  Mr. Burns says that this must be normal background radiation akin to what one might find in a playground. The team looks around further, noting the horrible safety standards the plant has.   Some flaws include leaking radiation pipes, finding Homer asleep at his monitoring post, and walking through a radioactive-flooded basement.  Mr. Burns asks the head investigator to step into his office for a talk and he tries to bribe the man to leave. Instead, he is handed a list of 342 violations that he must fix. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Homer want to vote for Mr. Burns?", "correct": "To keep his job", "options": ["To save money", "To do the right thing", "To stir the pot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo keep his job.\n\n\tHomer leaves work late on the same day having fallen asleep through most of his shift.  As he leaves the empty plant, he sees Mr. Burns' car across the parking lot and looks inside to see his boss drunk in the driver's seat.  When he investigates further, Mr. Burns invites him into the passenger seat for a talk.  Burns tells Homer that they're trying to shut the plant down and Homer makes the note that if he had enough money, he'd run for Governor.  Burns likes the idea and sets out to start a change.\rThe next morning, the newspaper already has the scoop.  Homer says that he'll vote for Burns to keep his job, but Marge says that they're a 'Mary Bailey family'.  Lisa is happy that they're having a political dispute at the table. \n"}, {"text": "While speaking with his campaign board, Mr. Burns discovers that 98% of voters see him as what?", "correct": "Despicable", "options": ["Ravenous", "Vampiric", "Brooding"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDespicable.\n\n\tThe main issue, as his campaign board notes, is the fact that Governor Mary Bailey is beloved by all whereas 98% of voters find Burns to be despicable.  As a result, they've hired on a speechwriter, a joke writer, a spin doctor, a make-up man, and a personal trainer.  Their goal: to turn Burns from the hunched, bloodthirsty individual he is into an all-American hero. In an artist's rendering, Burns asks why his teeth are showing; the campaign speaker states that he's smiling...it's part of the image.  Burns asks how they change his 'average joe-six-pack persona' into one that can defeat Mary Bailey and he discovers that they've also hired on a muck-raker, a character-assist, a mud-slinger, and a garbologist. First though, they have to deal with that three-eyed fish dilemma. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name given to the three-eyed fish?", "correct": "Blinky", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlinky.\n\n\tMuch to everyone's disdain at a coming election, Mr. Burns begins campaigning through public broadcasts.  His first announcement is about the three-eyed fish, which he names 'Blinky' as a result of its physical deformity.  Mr. Burns, however, dismisses the idea of a 'deformity' and 'mutation', instead opting to ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin to enlighten them on the topic.  As a result, Burns sends across the message that Blinky is, in fact, a 'super-fish' created as a result of Mother Nature's impact on its animals via evolution.  Viewers, for the most part, are impressed. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Marge hand out posters to support Mary Bailey?", "correct": "Kwik-E-Mart", "options": ["Springfield Mall", "Main Street", "Mayor's Office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKwik-E-Mart.\n\n\tAfter Burns' initial public broadcast, the polls shoot him up six points (up from zero).  As Grandpa Simpson says, they need 'young blood' in office.  While Mary Bailey persists that Burns supporters would simply be gullible voters, Burns continues to support the everyman, showing his support for lower taxes and the working man. As a result, he rises in the polls.  After rising 42%, Burns is told that the voters see him as imperial and God-like, to which he simply replies \"excellent\".  The campaign board says that because of this, he's in danger of losing touch with the common man, and as a result he will need to have dinner with an employee the day before the election. \n"}, {"text": "Smithers randomly selects Homer as the candidate for Mr. Burns to dine with the night before the election.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAfter being told the pre-election dinner plans, Mr. Burns walks over to his TV monitors and searches for one employee who could be deemed 'the every-man' in order to have dinner with him.  Looking to his campaign board, he picks Homer who, at the time, had been eating a doughnut and scratching his behind (and belching).  The next day, Marge is less-than-thrilled with Homer's spur-of-the-moment announcement to have the opposition over for dinner.  After he begs her on his hands and knees, she lets him host the dinner although she originally planned to ring doorbells for Governor Bailey. \n"}, {"text": "Who is asked to pose a question to Mr. Burns during dinner?", "correct": "Lisa", "options": ["Homer", "Marge", "Bart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLisa.\n\n\tWhile the campaign crew sets up the house for the dinner and the media circus involved, one leader asks Lisa to pose an important question to Mr. Burns which has been written down for her.  Lisa is unexcited by the blatant attempt to allude to Mr. Burns' unnecessary popularity and instead asks if she can ask her own question about the possibility of suppressing her fears of a horrible term as Governor (which Marge would also enjoy hearing), but the man tells her to stick to the card. They warn the family that he hates being touched, but that they need them to show him overwhelming affection to appeal to the viewers and voters. The night of the dinner, the polls are dead even. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these events does not happen during Burns' dinner with the Simpsons?", "correct": "Maggie throws up on Burns' suit", "options": ["Marge serves Burns a horrible meal", "Bart says Grace inappropriately", "Homer talks with his mouth full"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaggie throws up on Burns' suit.\n\n\tWhen Mr. Burns arrives the following night, the media is right behind him, taking pictures of every event.  As he begins to compliment the family, Santa's Little Helper leaps on him, pinning him to the ground and licking him.  Homer shoos him away and leads his boss inside, but the cat does the same thing, knocking him over.  Soon, however, they head in.\rDuring dinner, Burns soon realizes he can't keep his cool.  Bart makes a mockery of saying Grace at the table (which Burns rebounds from), the family eats like slobs, and he finds himself speaking to the cameras rather than speaking with the family.  Lisa says her inane question (and feels horrible after), and Marge brings out the main course: cooked three-eyed fish.  One bite from the fish, and Burns spits it across the room. \n"}, {"text": "Burns loses the election.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe media catches it immediately and the story spreads like wildfire.  Burns' poll ratings plummet immediately and he has no chance in the election.  As his election team walks out on him, Mr. Burns begins destroying the Simpson family's living room, knocking pictures to the ground and such.  He decides to leave to destroy more tasteful decor, but vows to Homer that as long as he's alive, he will make sure that his dreams will remain unfulfilled.  Marge assures Homer as they go to bed that no one can destroy his everyman dreams. \n"}]}
