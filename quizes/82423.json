What was the initial name of that character?", "correct": "Keyser Sume", "options": ["Sesyer Volme", "Seyser Kose", "Keyser Skolte"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeyser Sume.\n\n\tChris McQuarrie named the character after a man he worked with at a law firm.  The real-life Keyser Sume was flattered by the reference until he read the script; he then requested that the name of the character be changed so that his reputation did not suffer from comparisons to the mass-murdering character in the film. \n"}, {"text": "We learn in the DVD commentary by director Brian Singer and screenwriter Chris McQuarrie that Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) had a good reason for asking Keyser Soze what time it was in the opening scene of the film.  What was the reason?", "correct": "Keaton had set a timed explosive on the boat", "options": ["Edie Finneran was set to be executed at midnight", "Kobayashi was set to meet Keaton at exactly 1:00 AM", "Keaton's birthday would start at midnight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeaton had set a timed explosive on the boat.\n\n\tThe scene was cut from the final version of the film, but Keaton apparently placed a large bomb in the engine room of the boat and set it for midnight. \n"}, {"text": "One of the more humorous revelations on the DVD details the fact that the line-up scene (in which the five main characters meet for the first time) was meant to be very serious, but the actors were simply incapable of completing even a single take without bursting into laughter.  It's further revealed on the DVD that part of the reason for the actors' inability to concentrate on their jobs was one actor's insistence on indulging in loud, pungent flatulence throughout the shoot that day.  The actor responsible for this constant disruption played which character?", "correct": "Fenster", "options": ["McManus", "Kint", "Hockney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFenster.\n\n\tOn one of the DVD's featurettes, Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney) specifically notes that the digestive system of Benicio Del Toro (Fenster) was in full use that day, which made the giggles all the more difficult to suppress. \n"}, {"text": "What was the approximate budget of \"The Usual Suspects\"?", "correct": "$4 million", "options": ["$14 million", "$24 million", "$1.5 million"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$4 million.\n\n\tAmazingly, the film was made for a mere four million dollars, according to director Brian Singer (www.imdb.com lists the budget at six million dollars, for some reason).  The film's domestic gross was twenty-three million dollars.  Not bad, boys. \n"}, {"text": "How long was the principal shoot for \"The Usual Suspects\"?", "correct": "35 days", "options": ["45 days", "25 days", "55 days"], "explanation": "\n\n\n35 days.\n\n\tBrian Singer states this figure several times on the DVD.  Most of the shoot took place in the Los Angeles area, but there were two days of shooting in New York City, as well. \n"}, {"text": "There is a clue in the translation of Keyser Soze's name that suggests his true identity.  What English word or phrase is the clue?", "correct": "\"Talks too much\"", "options": ["\"Limp\"", "\"Kevin\"", "\"The man with the plan\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Talks too much\".\n\n\t\"Keyser,\" in German, means \"king.\"  \"Soze,\" in Turkish, means \"talks too much.\"  Roger Kint's nickname is \"Verbal,\" remember?  He even points out that people say he talks too much. \n"}, {"text": "Script revisions were frequent during the shoot -- so much that, at times, even the actors weren't entirely certain about what was happening in the plot.  Which actor was reportedly angry to learn that his character was not, in fact, Keyser Soze?", "correct": "Gabriel Byrne", "options": ["Stephen Baldwin", "Benicio Del Toro", "Kevin Pollak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGabriel Byrne.\n\n\tByrne had a fairly heated discussion with Brian Singer at one point once he learned, late in the shoot, that Kevin Spacey's character was actually going to be revealed as being Keyser Soze. \n"}, {"text": "As Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) tells U.S. Customs Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palmintieri) a disturbing story about the young Keyser Soze, we see Soze as a man with very long hair and an obscured face.  Who actually portrayed Soze in this sequence?", "correct": "intern Scott Morgan", "options": ["director Brian Singer", "Kevin Spacey", "screenwriter Chris McQuarrie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nintern Scott Morgan.\n\n\tScott Morgan, an intern on the set, was tapped to play Soze due to his thin frame and long hair -- yes, that was *real* hair on the young Keyser Soze, believe it or not!  Morgan was uncredited for his role, but Singer and McQuarrie clearly identify him on the DVD commentary and featurettes. \n"}, {"text": "A scene was shot in which the corpse of Arturro Marquez (Castulo Guerra), the man who could have positively identified Keyser Soze (and who was therefore killed by Soze on the boat), is discovered by a young boy fishing on a pier.  The scene wound up on the cutting room floor, which was something of a disappointment to director Brian Singer, given how much it cost to design and construct a lifelike mannequin to represent Marquez's waterlogged corpse.  How much did the mannequin cost?", "correct": "between $4,000 and $5,000", "options": ["between $10,000 and $12,000", "between $20,000 and $24,000", "between $15,000 and $16,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbetween $4,000 and $5,000.\n\n\tIt might not sound like much, but keep in mind that the budget for this film was not exactly Spielbergian.  A single shot from the scene containing the Marquez mannequin appears for about a second during the flashbacks punctuating Dave Kujan's \"revelation\" to Verbal Kint that Dean Keaton was Keyser Soze. \n"}, {"text": "One of the people involved in the making of \"The Usual Suspects\" provided two somewhat unrelated services.  What two titles does he or she hold in the credits of the film?", "correct": "Editor and Composer", "options": ["Stunt Double and Camera Operator", "Producer and Costume Designer", "Screenwriter and Second Unit Director"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEditor and Composer.\n\n\tJohn Ottman both wrote the film's original score, and edited the film.  Did a great job twice over, didn't he? \n"}, {"text": "Brian Singer tells an amusing and touching story in one of the DVD's featurettes about being approached at the Cannes Film Festival by an elderly woman who told him, after seeing \"The Usual Suspects,\" that a certain director would be proud of him, had he seen the film.  Which director did the woman mention?", "correct": "John Huston", "options": ["Alfred Hitchcock", "Michael Curtiz", "Francois Truffaut"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Huston.\n\n\tJohn Huston directed \"The Maltese Falcon,\" \"Treasure on the Sierra Madre,\" \"Key Largo,\" \"The African Queen,\" and dozens of other beloved films.  Singer was understandably flattered by the comment. \n"}, {"text": "What percentage of the Academy Awards for which \"The Usual Suspects\" was nominated did the film actually win?", "correct": "100%", "options": ["0%", "33 1/3 %", "50%"], "explanation": "\n\n\n100%.\n\n\tThe film was nominated for two Oscars: Best Original Screenplay (Chris McQuarrie) and Best Supporting Actor (Kevin Spacey).  In both cases, \"The Usual Suspects\" won.  Nominated for two; won two.  That's one hundred per cent. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the main five actors from \"The Usual Suspects\" did NOT participate in the featurettes seen on the DVD?", "correct": "They all did", "options": ["Gabriel Byrne", "Kevin Spacey", "Benicio Del Toro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey all did.\n\n\tEveryone involved with the film at every level seemed quite happy to discuss the production on the DVD. \n"}, {"text": "Both Brian Singer and Chris McQuarrie have stated quite clearly that \"The Usual Suspects\" was created specifically to showcase Kevin Spacey.  What previous film by Singer and McQuarrie had Spacey seen and been impressed with to the extent that he told its creators, \"We should do something together sometime\"?", "correct": "Public Access", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPublic Access.\n\n\tI've never seen this film, oddly enough.  I hear mixed reports about it.  Anyone got a recommendation or a slam for me?  I've been curious about it for years. \n"}, {"text": "True or False: Christopher McQuarrie titled his script \"The Usual Suspects\" because of the line \"Round up the usual suspects\" in \"Casablanca\" (1942).", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMcQuarrie swears that he knew nothing about that line from the classic movie; he says that he read a magazine article that was entitled \"The Usual Suspects,\" and simply thought it would make a good name for a movie.  Only later was the \"Casablanca\" reference pointed out to him. \n"}]}
