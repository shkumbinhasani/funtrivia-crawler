{"id": "104141", "name": "Aunts, Uncles, and Cousins Quiz | Thematic People | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Thematic People", "Thematic Family Members"], "questions": [{"text": "This fictional lady's name has sold millions of packages of pancake mix and millions of bottles of \"maple\" syrup: Aunt _______?", "correct": "Jemima", "options": ["Jemelle", "Janella", "Janey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJemima.\n\n\tIn the 1890s, entrepreneur Chris Rutt heard a song called \"Aunt Jemima\" in a vaudeville show. He and his partner decided to name their packaged pancake flour after the lady in the song. They later sold their product to Davis Milling Company, who hired Nancy Green, a former slave, to serve as a living trademark.By the mid-1900s, people began to object to Aunt Jemima's stereotypical \"mammy\" image and ad agencies gradually morphed her into the smiling, pretty middle-aged African American woman she is today. She has lustrous, curly dark-brown hair and of course no more \"head rag\" kerchief or long snowy apron.Quaker Oats has owned the Aunt Jemima products for many years. Does anyone remember the talking Mrs. Butterworth-shaped syrup bottle TV commercials from the 1960s or 1970s? \n"}, {"text": "If you live in the U.S., to which fictional uncle do you pay your taxes each year? Uncle _______?", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Sol", "Slim", "Sal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tHistorians do not seem to know for sure how the term \"Uncle Sam\" arose, but most trace it back to Samuel Wilson (1766-1854), a meat inspector (or perhaps a meat supplier) for the army during the War of 1812. Apparently, people liked Wilson, so soldiers and others called him \"Uncle Sam.\" He used to stamp meat boxes with \"U.S.\" (which probably stood for \"United States\") but some joked that it stood for his nickname.During the same era, \"Uncle Sam\" was a derogatory term that British soldiers used for Americans (you Brits were mean to us back then). It all came together somehow. Uncle Sam, in most Americans' minds, looks like the goat-faced elderly guy wearing a red, white, and blue tophat on the \"I Want YOU\" recruiting posters for the Army.His pointing finger seems to poke right AT the viewer, who I guess is supposed to think: \"Oh! You want ME?\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is by whom?", "correct": "Harriet Beecher Stowe", "options": ["John Brown", "Abraham Lincoln", "Harriet Tubman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe.\n\n\tHarriet Beecher came from a highly religious Protestant New England family; her father and brother were ministers, and her husband, Calvin Stowe, was a professor of Biblical literature.
