Which character was NOT afflicted with the virus in this episode?", "correct": "Quark (Armin Shimerman)", "options": ["Lieutenant Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell)", "Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks)", "Chief of Operations Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuark (Armin Shimerman).\n\n\tMost of the regular cast was speaking gibberish by the end of the episode, but Quark was never affected at all by the virus. \n"}, {"text": "In the second season episode \"Whispers,\" one member of the crew returns from a mission and becomes convinced that the entire station has been replaced by duplicates.  Which character?", "correct": "O'Brien", "options": ["Sisko", "Dax", "Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig, a.k.a. Siddig El Fadil)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nO'Brien.\n\n\tO'Brien seemingly came home to find that everyone on the station was acting very strangely toward him -- even his wife, Keiko (Rosalind Chao).  In a clever twist, it turned out that the \"O'Brien\" we had been following throughout the episode was actually a \"replicant\" (thank you, \"Blade Runner\"!) of the real O'Brien -- the audience had been swept up into the point of view of a *clone* of the character we knew so well! \n"}, {"text": "In the second season episode \"The Wire,\" we learn the first name of Garak (Andrew J.

Years later, we learned that Tain was actually Garak's father! \n"}, {"text": "In the original \"Star Trek\" episode \"Mirror, Mirror,\" audiences were introduced to the \"mirror universe,\" in which the Federation was an evil assemblage of conquerors and despots.  \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" never revisited this universe, but \"DS9\" did -- quite a bit, in fact.  Which two characters, in the second season episode \"Crossover,\" were the FIRST \"DS9\" regulars to venture into the mirror universe?", "correct": "Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) and Dr. Bashir", "options": ["Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) and Sisko", "Odo (Rene Auberjonois) and Sisko", "Dr. Bashir and Chief O'Brien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) and Dr. Bashir\n\n\tWhile traveling through the wormhole just outside Deep Space Nine, Kira and Bashir experience unusual \"turbulence,\" and are accidentally transported into the mirror universe.

(If you haven't seen the \"ST:TNG\" episode \"Second Chances,\" you might have no idea what a \"transporter clone\" is...and it would take waaaaay too long to go into here.  Just trust me.  WILL Riker did not appear in this episode; TOM Riker did.) \n"}, {"text": "The third season episode \"Meridian\" featured a planet that, like the mythical Brigadoon, only existed in the discernible universe for a short time every sixty years or so.

Which character?", "correct": "Dax", "options": ["Sisko", "Bashir", "Kira"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDax.\n\n\tJadzia Dax had a whirlwind romance with Meridian resident Deral (Brett Cullen), but the two were torn apart when Meridian went back into its own dimension, as it always does.

It featured the first full-on, no-holds-barred, no-camera-tricks-involved same-sex makeout scene between two women in any \"Trek\" series -- specifically, Jadzia Dax and a woman who, in one of Dax's previous lives, was her spouse.  The actress playing Dax's newly-rediscovered lover later played a role on \"Star Trek: Voyager.\"  What was it?", "correct": "The Borg Queen", "options": ["Seven of Nine", "Kes", "Seska"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Borg Queen.\n\n\tSusanna Thompson played Dr. Lenara Kahn, Dax's former wife, in perhaps the most controversial episode of \"DS9.\"  Thompson later took over, in \"Voyager,\" the role originated by Alice Krige in the motion picture \"Star Trek: First Contact\" -- the Borg Queen.  (Krige reprised the role of the Queen in the final episode of \"Voyager,\" but all other appearances of the character in the series were handled by Thompson.) \n"}, {"text": "In the fourth season, we learn that Dr. Julian Bashir has a favorite holosuite program, in which he lives out the adventures of someone based on a certain fictional character.  Which one?", "correct": "James Bond", "options": ["Flash Gordon", "Indiana Jones", "Sherlock Holmes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Bond.\n\n\tThe episode \"Our Man Bashir\" makes it quite clear that Bashir is a huge James Bond fan.

Who wrote this work of literature?", "correct": "Victor Hugo", "options": ["Arthur Conan Doyle", "Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley", "Edgar Allan Poe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictor Hugo.\n\n\tAccording to Eddington, he is Jean Valjean, and Sisko is Javert -- characters from Hugo's \"Les Miserables.\"  Sisko couldn't disagree more, given that Valjean's only crime is stealing a loaf of bread, and Javert is arguably obsessed to the point of insanity. \n"}, {"text": "In one of my favorite episodes, \"Children of Time,\" most of the Deep Space Nine crew stumbles into a highly unusual time-travel situation in which a planet is inhabited by hundreds of their future descendants.  Sisko is faced with a difficult decision: if he \"repeats history\" in such a way that those descendants are to come into being, a member of his crew has to die.  Which crewmember?", "correct": "Kira", "options": ["Bashir", "Dax", "O'Brien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKira.\n\n\tTo make a long story short, Kira would have to die in order for the colony of Gaia, hundreds strong, to survive.

Odo, a shapeshifter, would not normally require surgical alteration to change his appearance, but his shapeshifting abilities were not functioning at this time, as they had been removed by the Founders in the fourth season episode \"Broken Link\" as punishment for having killed another changeling. \n"}, {"text": "We learn in the fifth season that one of the regular characters was genetically altered as a child.  Which one?", "correct": "Bashir", "options": ["Sisko", "Quark (Armin Shimerman)", "Worf (Michael Dorn)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBashir.\n\n\tIn \"Doctor Bashir, I Presume?\", Dr. Louis Zimmerman (played by Robert Picardo, who portrayed the holographic doctor on \"Voyager\") accidentally discovers, via Bashir's parents, that Julian was functionally \"slow\" as a child, and was illegally enhanced in order to boost his intelligence, reflexes, and memory capacity. \n"}, {"text": "During the last two seasons of the show, a shady character named Sloan (William Sadler) plagued the DS9 crew.

One of them would have eventually killed the other, but Kai Winn (Louise Fletcher) interfered, leaving \"the Reckoning\" unresolved. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Kira Nerys' mother, as revealed in the sixth season episode \"Wrongs Darker Than Death or Night\"?", "correct": "Kira Meru", "options": ["Kira Tiyal", "Kira Lavel", "Kira Nerys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKira Meru.\n\n\tNerys uses the Orb of Time to travel to the past and discover that her mother, Kira Meru (Leslie Hope), was in fact the lover of her most hated enemy, the Cardassian Gul Dukat.  Ick. \n"}, {"text": "When the series began, Vedek Winn (Louise Fletcher) was a perpetual thorn in the side of Sisko, Kira, and the rest of the \"DS9\" crew.  A \"Vedek,\" in the Bajoran religion, is roughly analagous to a priest or a monk; Winn, however, sought the title of \"Kai,\" the actual leader of the Bajoran religion, perhaps analagous to a Pope.  In which season did Winn realize her goal and become the Kai of Bajor?", "correct": "the second", "options": ["the fourth", "the third", "the fifth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe second.\n\n\tIn the second season episode \"The Collaborator,\" the politically savvy Winn takes advantage of a delicate secret guarded by her primary opponent, Vedek Bareil (Philip Anglim), and is elected to the position of her dreams.

What was this ship originally called, before Sisko changed it?", "correct": "USS Sao Paulo", "options": ["USS Paladin", "USS Valiant", "USS Thames"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUSS Sao Paulo.\n\n\tInterestingly, the original name of that starship was in line with the theme of Deep Space Nine \"runabouts\", all of which are named after Earth rivers (the \"Yangtzee Kiang,\" the \"Rio Grande,\" the \"Ganges\", etc.)...and there is indeed a Sao Paulo River in Brazil. \n"}, {"text": "Here's one for you romantics out there.  How many \"real\" weddings (i.e. marriages that LASTED, as opposed to \"gimmick\" weddings that were annulled or reversed in the same episode that they occurred) involving at least one regular or semi-regular character did we SEE throughout the seven-season run of \"Deep Space Nine\"?", "correct": "3", "options": ["5", "7", "9"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tQuark's brother Rom (Max Grodenchik) and dabo girl Leeta (Chase Masterson) got married in season five's \"A Call To Arms.\"  Worf and Jadzia Dax tied the knot in the sixth season episode \"You Are Cordially Invited...\".
