{"id": "189863", "name": "The Film History of Robin Williams I Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed S-Z", " Robin Williams"], "questions": [{"text": "After having famously portrayed the alien Mork in the hit television series 'Mork and Mindy', Robin Williams finally ventured into the realm of feature films with his 1980 film debut in 'Popeye'.  Who starred alongside Robin as Olive Oyl in this Robert Altman directed live-action comedy?", "correct": "Shelley Duvall", "options": ["Sally Field", "Sally Kellerman", "Sally Struthers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShelley Duvall.\n\n\t'Popeye' was an example of a film that was marvelously cast but somehow still flopped.  Robin Williams was excellent as Popeye, and Shelley shined as Olive Oyl, but the movie just didn't tickle my fancy like it should have.  Perhaps it needed more spinach?  Just imagine if the original choice to play Popeye, Dustin Hoffman, were to have been kept.  I don't think that would have worked... \n"}, {"text": "In the 1982 film 'The World According to Garp', Robin Williams plays the title character.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAlongside an all-star cast that included John Lithgow, Glenn Close, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, Robin Williams is featured as T. S. Garp, the title character of this film which was based on the novel by John Irving.  It is here that Robin begins to show his dramatic abilities, though he naturally employed his comedic talents as well. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite early Robin Williams' roles was as the quasi-survivalist Donald Quinelle in the 1983 cheeseball classic 'Survivors'.  What veteran actor plays Sonny Paluso alongside Williams' Quinelle?", "correct": "Walter Matthau", "options": ["Jackie Gleason", "Buddy Ebsen", "Jerry Lewis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalter Matthau.\n\n\tDirected by Michael Ritchie, Robin once again shines in a comedic role that is only limited by the quality of the script.  Walter Matthau is also fun in this film that highlights both the absurdity of the working world and the neurotic fantasies of your average survivalist. \n"}, {"text": "Robin Williams does his best Yakov Smirnoff impression in the 1984 film 'Moscow on the Hudson'.  What is the name of Robin's Russian defector character in this frequently funny film?", "correct": "Vladimir Ivanoff", "options": ["Anatoly Khrushchev", "Mikhail Brezhnev", "Leonid Gorbachev"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVladimir Ivanoff.\n\n\tInterestingly, Yakov Smirnoff (who is actually Ukrainian) does appear in this film, but only in a minor role as Lev.  In the film, Robin Williams plays a Russian saxophone player who defects in Bloomingdales (of all places).  Again, another cheesy role...but Robin will make you laugh and cry here. \n"}, {"text": "Robin Williams has become a familiar face at Oscar ceremonies.  For which film did Robin Williams receive his first of several Academy Award nominations?", "correct": "Good Morning, Vietnam", "options": ["Seize the Day", "The World According to Garp", "The Best of Times"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGood Morning, Vietnam.\n\n\tRobin Williams received his first Oscar nomination for his performance as Adrian Cronauer, a radio DJ who brings joy to American soldiers during the terrifying situation in late 1960s Vietnam.  Again, Robin combined his unique talent for spontaneous comedy with a sense of dramatic humanity here, which is no doubt why the Academy decided to honor him with a nomination.  Incidentally, the film was very loosely based on a real DJ in Vietnam named Adrian Cronauer. \n"}, {"text": "On several occasions, Robin Williams has chosen to use stage names in the credits of various films.  One of these instances was for the 1988 madcap romp 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen', directed by whom?", "correct": "Terry Gilliam", "options": ["Barry Levinson", "Ivan Reitman", "Harold Ramis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerry Gilliam.\n\n\tFor 'The Adventures of Baron Muchausen', Robin chose the stage name 'Ray DiTutto', which translates from the Italian as 'King of Everything'.  In the film, Robin plays a minor role as the King of the Moon.  In this really odd piece, look also for appearances by Oliver Reed, Jonathan Pryce, Uma Thurman and Sting, not to mention the lead performances by Eric Idle and John Neville. \n"}, {"text": "Robin took an entirely dramatic turn in the 1989 film 'Dead Poets Society', and performed strikingly well at that.  What is the name of the English teacher he portrays in the film?", "correct": "John Keating", "options": ["Percy Shelldown", "William Wordsmith", "Alfred Tenneman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Keating.\n\n\tRobin's portrayal of John Keating in 'Dead Poets Society' garnered him his second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.  Though he did not win the award, it was clear that Mr. Williams would henceforth be regarded as both a master funnyman and a serious actor by his peers.   John Keating's favorite phrase in the film is 'Carpe Diem', which is interesting since Robin had previously appeared in the 1986 film 'Seize the Day'. \n"}, {"text": "In 1990, Robin Williams teamed up with Robert De Niro in yet another of his many dramatic performances.  What was the name of this film, directed by Penny Marshall and based on the book by Oliver Sacks?", "correct": "Awakenings", "options": ["Dead Again", "Being Human", "From Time to Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAwakenings.\n\n\tIn the film 'Awakenings' Robin plays a doctor named Dr. Malcolm Sayer who develops a drug that allows, for a brief time, a number of catatonic encephalitis victims to experience life once again.  The film is based on the real life experience of Dr. Oliver Sacks and his patients in the early 1970s. \n"}, {"text": "My personal favorite Robin Williams performance is in the 1991 film 'The Fisher King'.  In this movie, Robin plays a schizophrenic homeless man named Henry Sagan who formerly worked as a professor.  What one-word name does Williams go by during this very humanistic film?", "correct": "Parry", "options": ["Roger", "Lancelot", "Lombardi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParry.\n\n\tOnce again, Robin teamed up with Terry Gilliam in 'The Fisher King'.  He also worked alongside actors Mercedes Ruehl, Jeff Bridges and Amanda Plummer, all of whom performed stupendously.  Williams received his third Oscar nomination for his performance here, but again failed to take home the coveted statue. \n"}, {"text": "In which of the following films was Robin Williams teamed up with director Steven Spielberg?", "correct": "Hook", "options": ["Saving Private Ryan", "Jumanji", "Cadillac Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHook.\n\n\tRobin played Peter Pan in Spielberg's 1991 version of the classic children's story by James Barrie.  Alongside Robin appeared Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, Bob Hoskins as Smee and Maggie Smith as Wendy.  Not my favorite film by either Spielberg or Willaims, it still allowed Williams to spew forth his tremendous talent.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try more of my movie-related quizzes (and, more of my quizzes in general). \n"}]}
