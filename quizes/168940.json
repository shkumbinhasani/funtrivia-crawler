{"id": "168940", "name": "'T'errific Art Terms Quiz | Art | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Art Terms"], "questions": [{"text": "Lovers of Byzantine art are certain to know the answer to this question.  What is the 'T' term for an individual piece used to create a mosaic?  ", "correct": "Tessera", "options": ["Toggle", "Tassel", "Tarantella"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTessera.\n\n\tThe tesserae used to create the beautiful mosaics of the Byzantine period (and indeed other periods as well) were typically made from stone, glass, marble or other natural elements.  The name tessera comes from the Greek 'tessares', meaning 'four'.  This refers to the typically square shape of tesserae.  Some of the most amazing mosaics in history can be found in various churches in Ravenna, Italy, the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul and in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. \n"}, {"text": "A painting or carving with three adjoining compartments is typically called by what 'T' term of art history?  ", "correct": "Triptych", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTriptych.\n\n\tThe term for a two-compartmented painting or carving is called a diptych, which comes from the Greek 'diptukhos' (folded in two).  It is also possible to have more than three panels, in which case the work would be referred to as a polyptych.  Some examples of triptychs include the van Eyck brothers' 'Altarpiece at Ghent', Bosch's 'Garden of Earthly Delights' and Monet's 'Water Lilies'. \n"}, {"text": "In a Christian church, this term refers to the two 'arms' of the church that form right angles with the nave, creating the cruciform shape of the building.  What 'T' term of architecture fits this description?  ", "correct": "Transept", "options": ["Turret", "Temple", "Triplex"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTransept.\n\n\tThe point at which the transepts meet the nave in a cruciform church or basilica is called the crossing.  In early Christian basilicas the transepts were typically right up near the apse of the building, while in later Christian architecture the transepts were brought more towards the middle of the building to create the sense of a cross-shape. \n"}, {"text": "A 'truqueur' is a person who practices what occupation related to the world of art?  \n", "correct": "Forger", "options": ["Framer", "Art-dealer", "Auctioneer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForger.\n\n\tFor the most part, the label of 'truqueur' (one who practices 'trucage', a French term) is not a happy one.  However, it must be noted that forgery has been a part of the art world for many centuries, and the art of copying the works of others is not necessarily a dishonorable one (in fact, this is part of the learning process).  This is especially the case with Chinese art, where it was actually encouraged that painters emulate the style and composition of their masters. It is said that even Michelangelo indulged in forgery at one point in his career, creating a sculpture of 'antiquity' and selling it to a cardinal, who later destroyed it when he found out that the piece wasn't genuine! \n"}, {"text": "We don't often talk about the shapes of paintings, as typically we find that paintings are rectangular.  However, there have been many examples of circular paintings and/or reliefs in art history.  These are called by what Italian 'T' term?  ", "correct": "Tondo", "options": ["Tombolo", "Tazza", "Taleggio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTondo.\n\n\tIt should come as no surprise to learn that the Italian word 'tondo' literally means 'round object'.  The most famous tondo painting was the 'Doni Tondo', by Michelangelo.  This painting can be viewed at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. \n"}, {"text": "From Italian we return to French.  What is the special characteristic of a 'trompe l'oeil' painting?  ", "correct": "Visual illusion", "options": ["Vivid colors", "Abstract composition", "Concave painting surface"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVisual illusion.\n\n\tThe term 'trompe l'oeil' literally means 'deceives the eye'.  This technique has been used for centuries, dating back to the classical period (and most likely, beyond.)  It has been a favorite of artists who appreciate the humor of things, and many clever stories have been told of trompe l'oeil paintings.  My favorite 'trompe l'oeil'-related anecdote involves the ancient Greek artists Parrhasius and Zeuxis.  See this website if you wish to be regaled: http://www.in2greece.com/english/historymyth/history/ancient/zeuxis.htm \n"}, {"text": "In the 1940s and 50s the Abstract Expressionist movement exploded on the New York art scene.  Some members of the New York school, most notably Jackson Pollack, practiced a technique called 'action painting'.  What was the parallel European version of this technique called?  ", "correct": "Tachisme", "options": ["Trecentism", "Tenebrism", "Tischbein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTachisme.\n\n\tThe word 'tache' is French for spot or stain.  Largely a French phenomenon, the practitioners of tachisme included Fautrier, Riopelle (Canadian), Soulages and Mathieu.  Tachisme is also sometimes called 'Art Informel' by art historians. \n"}, {"text": "Terracotta is a type of earthenware used in building or modeling.  What color is terracotta, most typically?  ", "correct": "Brownish-red", "options": ["Dark green", "Black", "Yellowish-white"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrownish-red.\n\n\tTerracotta clay is most commonly a brownish-red color, so much so that the term has become synonymous with the that shade of red.  However, terracotta can be found in various other colors, depending on its chemical composition (most notably depending on the amount of iron-oxide present).  Terracotta work goes unglazed; it has been the favorite material historically for models made for sculptural or architectural purposes. \n"}, {"text": "What resinous secretion of certain pine (and some other) trees is distilled and used as a thinner for paints?  ", "correct": "Turpentine & Oil of Turpentine & Spirits of Turpentine", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurpentine & Oil of Turpentine & Spirits of Turpentine.\n\n\tThe very pungent 'spirits of turpentine' (or 'oil of turpentine') are used to dilute or thin oil paints, for varnishes, or as an ingredient in liniments.  Turpentine is ultimately a product of pine and other related trees, and can be quite hazardous to your health, so be careful using it! \n"}, {"text": "Tempera is a painting method using pigments mixed in emulsion with a colloidal vehicle.  Which of these is most commonly used as the medium for tempera paints?  ", "correct": "Egg yolk", "options": ["Tree sap", "Glue", "Wax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEgg yolk.\n\n\tFrom the 13th to the 15th centuries, tempera was the most oft-used technique for panel painting, only being abandoned when the use of oil paints became common.  Most typically, egg yolks were mixed with a pigment-water concoction to create tempera paints.  Some American artists revived the use of tempera in the 20th century, most notably Wyeth.
