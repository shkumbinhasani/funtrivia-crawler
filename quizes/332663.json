Nine American League and eight National League pitchers were grandfathered in to throw the pitch because that was their primary pitch. Burleigh Grimes was the last pitcher to throw it in the Major Leagues until he retired in 1934.  Some speculate that if all pitchers were banned from throwing it in 1920, then Cleveland Indian Ray Chapman would not have died from a Carl Mays spitball in the 1920 season. \n"}, {"text": "\"Baseball Digest\" began publication in August 1942.
