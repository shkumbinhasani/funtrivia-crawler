{"id": "341292", "name": "Nautical Nonsense Quiz | Transport | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Transport", " Maritime"], "questions": [{"text": "If someone were to say they have \"no room to swing a cat\", what is the cat they are referring to?", "correct": "A Whip", "options": ["A Pet", "This was a random phrase that didn't mean anything", "Catherine the Great"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Whip.\n\n\tA cat is short for a cat-o'-nine-tails.  A cat is a type of whip that has 9 whips attached (thus the name, a \"cat [whip] with nine tails\").  Floggings were shown to all the crew; and sometimes the ship got crowded, and the flogger did not have enough room to swing his cat at the victim.  Thus, the phrase.\r The \"captain's daughter\" is also a cat, but is only issued and used by the captain. \n"}, {"text": "In nautical terms, berth is used many times.  Which of these is NOT a description of \"berth\"?", "correct": "A large type of ship", "options": ["A place to sleep", "A place for ships not at sea", "A safety margin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA large type of ship.\n\n\tYou might have heard the phrase \"to give a wide berth\".  This is based on the word \"berth\" used in navigation, which is the distance between two ships at sea as a safety.  A berth is also the location where mooring ships not at sea can port.  Finally, it can also be a bed on a ship. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes a structure is built in the water that is similar to a buoy; it acts as a marker.  What marine animal is it named after?", "correct": "Dolphin", "options": ["Shark", "Whale", "Seal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDolphin.\n\n\tA dolphin is not only a marine mammal, it is also a word for a marker driven into the seabed.  It isn't a buoy in that it does not float.  Instead, it is a structure actually attached to the floor of the sea, but is not connected to the mainland in any way. \n"}, {"text": "You may have heard of a fathom, especially if you say \"I cannot fathom that, salami!\"  How long is a fathom, roughly?", "correct": "From fingertip to fingertip if you outstretch your arms", "options": ["From fingertips to the ground if you reach straight up", "From elbow to elbow if you touch your fingertips together", "From toe to toe if you can do the splits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom fingertip to fingertip if you outstretch your arms.\n\n\tThe average man's arm-span (from fingertip to fingertip) is six feet (1.8 meters) in length.  This is what is known as a \"fathom\" in nautical terms.  So, therefore, if something is 100 fathoms deep, it is approximately 600 feet (180 meters) deep. \n"}, {"text": "Many have heard of grog, but did you know it is half water and half alcohol?  What kind of alcohol is it, by chance?", "correct": "Rum", "options": ["Whiskey", "Gin", "Wine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRum.\n\n\t\"Where has all the rum gone?\" - Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp)\r Grog is a drink that was made by mixing half rum with half water.  This was because rum was running out, and Admiral Vernon (nicknamed \"Old Grogram\") ordered the rum to be watered down.  The drink was then named after his nickname, which was given because he always wore grogram coats. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes ships have more than three masts.  What is the fourth, much smaller mast known as?", "correct": "Jigger-mast", "options": ["Mizzen-mast", "Fore-mast", "Main-mast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJigger-mast.\n\n\tThe jigger-mast is the fourth mast on a ship, and is often much smaller than the others.  The third mast on a ship, the mizzen-mast, is bigger than the jigger-mast but smaller than the fore-mast and main-mast.  Both masts are aft of the two main masts.  The main-mast is the biggest mast, and located near the center of the ship.  The fore-mast is named so because it is fore of the main-mast.  It is smaller than the main-mast but larger than both the jigger-mast and the mizzen-mast.  It is the first mast. \n"}, {"text": "What is a monkey's fist?", "correct": "Type of knot", "options": ["Type of fishing technique", "An actual monkey fist with magical powers", "Type of belaying pin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nType of knot.\n\n\tA monkey's fist is a knot that is named so because it looks like a small set of fisted hands, resembling a monkey's paws.  \"Monkey Paw\" is a story about a real monkey's paw that moves on its own and grants wishes (but rather literally). \n"}, {"text": "When a ship skids on top of the water more-so than actually pushing through it, what is this called?", "correct": "Planing", "options": ["Boating", "Carring", "Training"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlaning.\n\n\tYou might have experienced planing yourself and on land; but we call it hydroplaning.  This is when a wheeled vehicle is moving fast enough to skim over the water on the road.  Water has enough \"bounce\" that at certain speeds, you ride on top of it rather than on the actual road.\r In the water, boats can plane too.  You might have seen a speedboat \"glide\" across the water, but it's just planing.  And yes, some planes do plane. \n"}, {"text": "You've probably heard all of these terms: aft, fore, port, starboard.  However, if you're like me, you get them mixed up often.  Which one refers to the right side of a ship?", "correct": "Starboard", "options": ["Port", "Aft", "Fore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStarboard.\n\n\tStarboard is the right of the ship, and port is the left.  Fore is the front of the ship, and aft is in the back.\r To remember which is which, think of FAPS and remember the order \"front, back, left, right\".  It will also help to think of fore as being foreward, and being listed first...  So it's front and back first, then left and right (front is fore, back is aft, left is port, and right is starboard, or FAPS).  And if that doesn't help...  Oh well. \n"}, {"text": "Though you might use the term \"under the weather\", it has a completely different meaning in nautical terms.  What does it mean on a ship?", "correct": "Serving a watch that is exposed to wind and spray", "options": ["There are thunderclouds directly overhead", "Ill; sick; not feeling well", "A type of rigging known as a \"weather\" has fallen on top of a crew member"], "explanation": "\n\n\nServing a watch that is exposed to wind and spray.\n\n\tIf someone is \"under the weather\", they are on watch duty.  This particular duty, however, is in a certain position on a ship; when it is windy, ocean spray blows onto the deck.  This watch position is right where the poor watcher will be hit by all the wind and spray; thus, he is \"under the weather\".  This often made that person sick, which is why we use the term \"under the weather\" to mean ill. \n"}]}
