The lightning struck the monster and later it woke up.  Frankenstein and the townspeople made preparations for Frankenstein's wedding until a man carried his drowned daughter to the village. Frankenstein and the townspeople hunted for the one responsible, but Frankenstein knew who it was, and he was alone when he caught up to the monster.  They fought in the windmill until the monster threw Frankenstein out.  The villagers set fire to the windmill.  Frankenstein survived the fall and was taken home to recover. \n"}, {"text": "How did Frankenstein's monster meet its end in \"Bride of Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "He was inside an exploding building.", "options": ["He was buried alive in the cemetery.", "He went around the world in 80 days.", "He was sent in a rocket to the moon."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was inside an exploding building.\n\n\tThe monster survived the fire in the windmill.  Eventually, he became friends with a blind hermit and learned to speak.  He was chased away.  Later, the monster insisted Frankenstein give him a mate.  Frankenstein took the monster and his assistants back to the old building where he had brought the monster to life in the previous movie. After he brought a strange woman back to life to be a mate for the monster, she hissed at the monster.  Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff) said, \"We belong dead.\"  He pulled a lever which exploded the building after Dr. Frankenstein and Elizabeth had escaped. \n"}, {"text": "How did Frankenstein's monster meet its end in \"Son of Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "He was kicked into the sulfur pit.", "options": ["He ran away.", "He was arrested for murder.", "He was shot to death."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was kicked into the sulfur pit.\n\n\tWhen Ygor showed Wolf Frankenstein the monster, Ygor talked Wolf into helping the monster become strong again, but he didn't know until later that Ygor was using the monster to kill the people who had sentenced Ygor to death.  Previously, Ygor (Bela Lugosi) had been hung and pronounced dead, but he wasn't dead after all, although his neck was now crooked. When Wolf discovered that the monster (Boris Karloff) had run off with his son, Peter, after having murdered people because of Ygor, Wolf (Basil Rathbone) shot Ygor several times and swung on a rope, like Tarzan, knocking the monster into the sulfur pit. \n"}, {"text": "How did Frankenstein's monster meet its end in \"Ghost of Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "He was in a burning lab.", "options": ["He was attacked by the wolf man.", "He was hung by his neck until dead.", "He was shot in the head."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was in a burning lab.\n\n\tIn \"Ghost of Frankenstein\" the characters were preoccupied with putting a different brain into the monster (Lon Chaney Jr, 1906-1973).  The monster had killed a doctor, so Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein (Cedric Hardwicke), son of the first Dr. Frankenstein, wanted to put the dead doctor's brain into the monster. However, Ygor (Bela Lugosi, 1882-1956) talked Dr. Bohmer (Lionel Atwill, 1885-1946) into putting Ygor's brain into the monster.  When this happened, the brain wasn't compatible, and the monster went blind.  This caused the monster to panic and knock things over, which started a fire in the lab, and the ceiling fell on the monster. This was the end, until the next movie. \n"}, {"text": "How did Frankenstein's monster meet its end in \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\"?", "correct": "He drowned.", "options": ["He burned.", "He was killed by the wolf man.", "He escaped."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe drowned.\n\n\tAfter returning to life and continuing to turn into a wolf man and attack people, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr) searched for someone to cure him.  Instead he found Frankenstein's monster (Bela Lugosi) frozen underground.  Eventually, another doctor did experiments which made Frankenstein's monster strong again.  The monster had a fight with the wolf man, but the barkeep, who had said he was against the experiments at the old Frankenstein place, blew up the dam, which flooded the underground lab, drowning the wolf man and the monster. \n"}, {"text": "How did Frankenstein's monster meet its end in \"House of Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "He sank into quicksand.", "options": ["He burned in the lab.", "The wolf man killed him.", "Dracula bit him."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe sank into quicksand.\n\n\tThis was the first movie containing Dracula (John Carradine), the wolf man (Lon Chaney Jr), and Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange) who had slept through the movie until the last ten minutes.  The villagers were looking for the wolf man when they saw the hunchback fall through a window.  (The monster had thrown the hunchback after the hunchback had injured Dr. Niemann.) The villagers saw Frankenstein's monster carry Dr. Niemann (Boris Karloff), the injured doctor.  The villagers chased them into the quicksand.  Frankenstein's monster and Dr. Niemann (Boris Karloff) sank into the quicksand. \n"}, {"text": "How did Frankenstein's monster meet its end in \"House of Dracula\"?", "correct": "He was in a burning lab again.", "options": ["He was in a burning windmill again.", "He drowned again.", "He fell in the sulfur pit again."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was in a burning lab again.\n\n\tDr. Edelmann found the bodies of the monster (Glenn Strange) and the skeleton of Dr. Niemann from \"House of Frankenstein\" in a cave.  They had sunken into quicksand at the end of \"House of Frankenstein\" and now \"House of Dracula\" revealed that the bodies ended up in a cave under the quicksand.  After sinking into the quicksand, the monster's body had not decomposed. After curing the wolf man (Lon Chaney Jr), killing Dracula (John Carradine), and turning evil, the doctor brought the monster (Glenn Strange) back to life, but then the monster (Lon Chaney Jr) knocked over something which burned down the lab. That's right.  The movie ended with a clip from \"Ghost of Frankenstein\" when Lon Chaney Jr had played the monster and burned the lab.  There was also a scene which showed an old clip of Boris Karloff as the monster.  You could say three different actors played as the monster in this movie. \n"}, {"text": "How did Frankenstein's monster meet its end in \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "He burned on the boat dock, falling through.", "options": ["He burned in the windmill again.", "He burned in the lab again.", "Dracula and the wolf man tore him apart."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe burned on the boat dock, falling through.\n\n\tWhile Dracula (Bela Lugosi) and the wolf man (Lon Chaney Jr) were fighting on the balcony above, Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange) stood on the boat dock trying to get to Bud and Lou, who were trying to row away, but Lou still had the boat tied to the dock.  A young doctor set fire to the boat dock, and the monster stood there burning until he fell through, which was the last we saw of the monster in the eight classic \"Frankenstein\" monster movies. \n"}, {"text": "What happened to Frankenstein's monster at the end of \"Young Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "He got a new personality.", "options": ["He was sold to the freak show.", "He was killed by Robot Monster.", "He watched \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe got a new personality.\n\n\tMel Brooks directed \"Young Frankenstein\", in which a relative of the original Dr. Frankenstein inherited the old estate and decided to create a new monster.  However, the new monster was just as violent as the old one, because Igor put in the brain of \"A.B. Normal\".  Near the end of the movie, Frankenstein exchanged \"brain fluid\" with the monster, which gave the monster normal intelligence, and he could speak.  The monster ended up with Elizabeth, young Frankenstein's former girlfriend. \n"}, {"text": "How did Frankenstein's monster meet its end in \"Dracula Vs Frankenstein\" (1971)?", "correct": "Dracula killed him.", "options": ["King Kong killed him.", "The wolf man killed him.", "Frankenstein killed him."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDracula killed him.\n\n\tIn this peculiar movie Dracula was superhumanly strong, and he literally tore the monster limb from limb.  J. Carrol Naish (1896-1973), the hunchback from \"House of Frankenstein\", played as a modern day Dr. Frankenstein while Lon Chaney Jr (1906-1973), the wolf man from \"House of Frankenstein\", played as Dr. Frankenstein's silent assistant, Groton. \n"}]}
