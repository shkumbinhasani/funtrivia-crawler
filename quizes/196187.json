{"id": "196187", "name": "Mad Cow Disease Quiz / Test | Diseases | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Diseases", "Neurological Disorders"], "questions": [{"text": "The causative agent of mad cow disease is probably a prion. What is a prion?", "correct": "An abnormal protein", "options": ["A protozoan", "A virus", "A very small bacterium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn abnormal protein.\n\n\tIt is theorized that the prions of mad cow disease are abnormally folded, and somehow induce normal nerve cell proteins to fold abnormally as well. The abnormal proteins do not work as they should in the nerve cell, and tend to clump together. The body's immune cells attempt to remove them, but cannot break them down. Eventually, the cells rupture and spread the prions even further. This process also leads to the nerve tissue becoming riddled with tiny holes. \n"}, {"text": "Mad cow disease is the only prion disease known to affect humans.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe first identified human prion disease was kuru, which affected the cannibalistic Fore tribe of New Guinea, and was spread by complicated rituals in which the brains of ancestors were eaten. \n"}, {"text": "Mad cow disease is a member of a group of diseases called TSEs. What does TSE stand for?", "correct": "Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy", "options": ["Total spongiform encerebration", "Terminal spinal encephalopathy", "Terminal simian evisceration"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTransmissible spongiform encephalopathy.\n\n\t\"Transmissible\" means able to be passed from one organism to another, \"spongiform\" refers to the holes it makes in nervous tissue, and \"encephalopathy\" means a brain disease. \n"}, {"text": "What is the proper scientific acronym for mad cow disease?", "correct": "BSE", "options": ["BCD", "MCD", "TCE"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBSE.\n\n\tBSE stands for \"bovine spongiform encephalopathy.\" \"Bovine\" means \"related to cows;\" the rest of the etymology is as for TSE. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following animals is NOT known to host a disease similar to mad cow?", "correct": "Pig", "options": ["Sheep", "Deer", "Mink"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPig.\n\n\tSheep suffer from scrapie, which was probably the origin of BSE. Deer in the US suffer from chronic wasting disease, which many suspect may be passed on to deer hunters. Captive-raised mink suffer from transmissible mink encephalopathy, which may have been acquired from scrapie-infected sheep. \n"}, {"text": "What is the human variant of mad cow disease called?", "correct": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease", "options": ["Tourette's syndrome", "Bovine encephalopathy", "Legg-Perthe's disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n\n\tSpecifically, it is called new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or nvCJD, as other forms of CJD exist. \n"}, {"text": "Which is NOT a symptom of mad cow disease in cows?", "correct": "Uncontrollable aggression", "options": ["Weight loss", "Loss of coordination", "Skittishness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUncontrollable aggression.\n\n\tDespite being called \"mad\" cow disease, aggression is not a symptom. Affected animals lose their appetites, drool, stagger, seem afraid of everything, and eventually are paralyzed and die. \n"}, {"text": "What types of tissues carry the greatest risk of spreading mad cow disease to people?", "correct": "Tissues from the nervous system", "options": ["Muscle tissue", "Fatty tissues", "Liver and other organ meats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTissues from the nervous system.\n\n\tAs BSE infects the nervous system, nerve tissues are the most dangerous. It is also recommended not to use eyes, spleen, thymus, lymph glands or intestines in human food. Most cases of mad cow in people probably arose either from consuming brains, or from contamination of hamburger with nerve tissue. \n"}, {"text": "What is the prevalent theory of how cows developed mad cow disease?", "correct": "From being fed sick sheep or cows", "options": ["It is a variant form of cow pox", "From a similar disease in wild deer", "It has always occurred in cattle, but mutated to infect humans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom being fed sick sheep or cows.\n\n\tSheep carry a TSE called scrapie. In the 1980's, scrapie-infected sheep were ground up and processed into cattle feed, thus possibly infecting cows. Cows were also fed to cows, and another theory is that BSE was a naturally-occurring disease in cows that was amplified in this fashion. \n"}, {"text": "In the United States, tissues that hold the highest risk of passing on mad cow disease may not be fed to animals.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThey may not be fed to ruminants (cows, sheep and goats) but are processed into pig, poultry and pet foods. Both domestic and zoo carnivores in Europe have contracted BSE through this route. \n"}, {"text": "What percentage of slaughtered cattle in the US are tested for mad cow disease?", "correct": "Less than 1%", "options": ["5%", "100%", "50%"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLess than 1%.\n\n\tIn the US, about 35,000,000 cattle are killed every year. Only about 113,000 are tested for BSE, or about .3% and test results are not returned until the animal has already entered the human food chain. In contrast, Japan tests 100% of slaughtered cattle. The US beef industry has strenuously opposed such testing in the US. \n"}, {"text": "Some cases of human mad cow disease may be misdiagnosed as what other disease?", "correct": "Alzheimer's disease", "options": ["Manic depression", "Polio", "Schizophrenia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlzheimer's disease.\n\n\tSome studies of the brains of Alzheimer's patients have shown that significant percentages had some type of CJD, although not necessarily nvCJD. \n"}, {"text": "There is a vaccine for mad cow disease in cows.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe only prevention is to not feed animal parts to cows. \n"}, {"text": "What must be done to destroy the agent that causes mad cow disease?", "correct": "Incineration", "options": ["Exposure to ultraviolet radiation", "Freezing", "Use of strong disinfectants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIncineration.\n\n\tOnly incineration at extremely high temperatures will destroy the prions. \n"}, {"text": "Cooking meat until well-done is a very important step in preventing the transmission of mad cow disease.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNormal cooking temperatures do not affect the prions at all. \n"}, {"text": "What is not a symptom of mad cow disease in people?", "correct": "Wild bursts of activity", "options": ["Slurred speech", "Paranoia", "Coordination problems"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWild bursts of activity.\n\n\tPeople with nvCJD may first show psychiatric problems, often paranoia, and memory loss. As the disease progresses, they have problems with speech, hearing and other senses, as well as loss of coordination. Finally, they lapse into a coma and die. Lifespan after diagnosis is not usually more than a year. \n"}, {"text": "Once symptoms show, human mad cow disease is always fatal.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIt is inexorably progressive, and no treatments halt its destruction of the nervous system. \n"}, {"text": "In December of 2003, Dave Louthan slaughtered a cow in Washington that later tested positive for mad cow disease. What happened to Mr. Louthan?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["He testified before the government on problems in slaughterhouse practices", "He became an activist against beef industry practices", "He lost his job"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tHe has appeared on many radio and TV shows to talk about how he feels beef industry practices may endanger human health. \n"}, {"text": "Which is NOT considered to be a possible mode of transmission of mad cow disease in humans?", "correct": "Close personal contact with someone with the disease", "options": ["Vaccines", "Cosmetics", "Blood transfusions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClose personal contact with someone with the disease.\n\n\tAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, there is no evidence that nvCJD has been spread by personal contact. Prions could be spread from vaccines produced with contaminated human or animal tissue, from blood transfusions, or the use of contaminated fats (tallows) in cosmetics. \n"}, {"text": "In the United States, what group possibly faces the danger of a prion disease related to mad cow disease?", "correct": "Deer hunters", "options": ["Horse riders", "Sheep farmers", "Goat milkers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeer hunters.\n\n\tMany deer, elk and moose in the US are infected with chronic wasting disease, a TSE. While no research confirms transmission of this disease to humans, no research shows that it does not happen. \n"}]}
