In the novel, three rival adventurers decide to travel to the Moon by climbing into a metal tube and firing themselves from an enormous cannon. Which author made some surprisingly accurate guesses about space travel in telling this story?", "correct": "Jules Verne", "options": ["Mark Twain", "H. G. Wells", "Isaac Asimov"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJules Verne.\n\n\tJules Verne is often regarded as the father of modern science fiction, and \"From the Earth to the Moon\" shows why. Verne's spaceship is launched from Florida, just as real ones would be a hundred years later, and for the same reason. It's even named \"Columbiad\"; \"Columbia\" was the name of the orbiting module for the Apollo 11 mission, first to land on the Moon. Of course, a cannon isn't a very good approach for launching a manned spacecraft: the barrel would have to be impossibly long to avoid lethal accelerations. Even Jules Verne couldn't get them all right! \n"}, {"text": "Many science fiction authors explore the possibilities of scientific ventures to the Moon. In one novel, associated with a famous film, the lunar crater Tycho is found to contain key evidence of extraterrestrial life and early human history. This evidence is a monolith -- an immense, smooth, magnetic black slab. What classic novel follows the consequences of this monolith's mysterious transmissions?", "correct": "2001: A Space Odyssey", "options": ["Voyager", "The Gods Themselves", "A Cry from the Dark"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\n\t\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" written by Arthur C. Clarke, was published in 1968, soon after the release of the Stanley Kubrick movie of the same name. The strange monoliths are artifacts of an alien species, which has deployed them widely throughout the galaxy. Are they meant to somehow spur the development of intelligence? Are they a way to make contact or a way to spy? This book explores these questions, and introduces us to one of the creepiest artificial intelligences in science fiction: the shipboard computer HAL 9000. \n"}, {"text": "The Moon is a victim in a 1971 novel about a man whose \"effective dreams\" create a new reality. Urged by his psychiatrist to dream of a humanity at peace, the man does dream of peoples united -- but only in the face of an extraterrestrial attack on the Moon. Who spun this tale of dreams, reality and utopia?", "correct": "Ursula LeGuin", "options": ["Isaac Asimov", "J. R. R. Tolkien", "Larry Niven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUrsula LeGuin.\n\n\tThe book is \"The Lathe of Heaven,\" and it takes its title from a (mistranslated) quotation from a Chinese philosopher who lived in the fourth century BC. \"To let understanding stop at what cannot be understood is a high attainment,\" the epigram goes. \"Those who cannot do it will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven.\" George Orr, the protagonist, can try to dream up a better world, but should he? Knowing when to stop is more than half the battle. \n"}, {"text": "\"The First Men in the Moon\" (1901) tells of a scientist and a businessman who make the first-ever voyage to the Moon -- only to be captured by the bug-like people who live underground there. Who wrote of this alarming first encounter?", "correct": "H. G. Wells", "options": ["C. S. Lewis", "Jules Verne", "Fred Saberhagen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nH. G. Wells\n\n\tMr. Bedford and Dr. Cavor, the stars of the story, travel to the Moon with the aid of cavorite -- a mysterious substance that cancels out gravity and immediately launches itself due to air pressure. They see many strange things on the Moon, from frozen air to hallucinogenic fungi, and Wells takes the opportunity to pen one of the first detailed descriptions of an alien society. As in his more famous book \"The War of the Worlds,\" the aliens may not be entirely friendly ... \n"}, {"text": "The Moon is only a quick stopover in the classic tale of spaceman Gully Foyle's extended revenge. He visits the Moon to find an informant who works in a vast pharmaceutical factory: the lunar environment is perfect for growing anaerobic bacteria. Who wrote the novel that gave us Gully Foyle, jaunting, and a solar system ruled by feudal, corporate clans?", "correct": "Alfred Bester", "options": ["Poul Anderson", "Neil Gaiman", "Arthur C. Clarke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlfred Bester.\n\n\tAlfred Bester's 1956 novel, titled \"Tiger! Tiger!\" in the U.K. and \"The Stars My Destination\" in the U.S., is set in the 25th century, in a fully inhabited solar system whose outer planets are at war with the inner ones. People here can jaunte -- teleport -- up to a thousand miles using only their minds, the heads of corporate \"clans\" have taken the place of antiquity's feudal lords, and the monstrous Gully Foyle seeks revenge against the people who left him to die in space.\r Foyle's visit to the Moon allows Bester to explore the possible foundation of a lunar economy. \"Mare Nubium,\" he writes, \"was ideally suited to the growth of anaerobic bacteria, soil organisms, phage, rare moulds, and all those microscopic life forms, essential to medicine and industry, which required airless culture.\" The immense vats of Bacteria, Inc., grow such lifeforms during the two-week lunar \"day\"; the equally long lunar \"night\" sterilizes the vats by freezing. \n"}, {"text": "In one memorable novel, human-alien contact is achieved between universes before it can be sought between planets. The two parallel universes have slightly different values for certain fundamental physics properties; by exchanging particles across the boundary, both sides get free energy. Which science-fiction author, who only very rarely wrote anything about aliens at all, described the lunar energy station that takes advantage of this particle flow?", "correct": "Isaac Asimov", "options": ["H. G. Wells", "Arthur C. Clarke", "Robert Heinlein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsaac Asimov.\n\n\t\"The Gods Themselves\" (1972) derives its title from an aphorism coined by 18th-century poet Friedrich Schiller: \"Against stupidity, the gods themselves contend in vain.\" The energy transfer between universes is doomed to destroy Earth, but neither civilization can bring itself to switch it off. In the final section, it falls to scientists at a settlement on the Moon to try to square this circle and save the world. Will they succeed? Only Asimov will tell ... \n"}, {"text": "When children's author Hugh Lofting wrote about the Moon in 1928, he came up with a unique description: a vibrant wilderness where even the plants are intelligent! Which beloved character, renowned for his ability to speak to animals, extends his communication skills to lunar plants?", "correct": "Doctor Dolittle", "options": ["Tintin", "Aslan", "Tarzan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoctor Dolittle.\n\n\tThe book is \"Doctor Dolittle in the Moon,\" eighth in Lofting's series of \"Dolittle\" books. A bit spookier and more focused than its predecessors, this fantasy may have been meant to end the series -- with the good Doctor stranded on the Moon! In the end, however, Lofting couldn't resist continuing the series: he brought Doctor Dolittle back to Earth in 1933's \"Doctor Dolittle's Return,\" and wrote three more sequels after that. \n"}, {"text": "\"An Inconstant Moon\" may be beautiful, but it's a bad omen for Earth. What writer ventured from Known Space to tell this short story much closer to home?", "correct": "Larry Niven", "options": ["Ursula LeGuin", "Robert Heinlein", "Lois McMaster Bujold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarry Niven.\n\n\tLarry Niven, best known for his series of works set in Known Space, published \"Inconstant Moon\" in 1971; it won for best short story at the next year's Hugo Awards. In this tale, the Moon is unusually bright and glorious one night -- but this reflects a change in the Sun that spells disaster for Earth. \n"}, {"text": "With place names like the Sea of Tranquility, the Moon seems like a peaceful place, but science fiction tells a different tale. In one author's telling, the Moon is settled as a penal colony, and one day its residents rise up against Earth.

An unlikely quartet of patriots -- an agitator, a professor, a technician, and a sentient computer eager for a challenge -- foment a revolution with the motto of \"TANSTAAFL\": \"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch!\" Heinlein's Luna is memorable not only for its rebellion, but also for its richly imagined culture, from impromptu citizens' courts to an encouragement of polyandry (a marriage with one wife and more than one husband). \n"}, {"text": "Ray Bradbury's short story \"-- And the Moon Be Still as Bright\" may be set on Mars, but the Moon of the title gives it an elegiac flavor that helps define the story. The title comes from the works of which Romantic poet?", "correct": "Lord Byron", "options": ["Samuel Taylor Coleridge", "John Milton", "Mary Shelley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLord Byron.\n\n\tThe line comes from the poem \"So, We'll Go No More a-Roving,\" written in 1817. The first verse reads:\r \"So we'll go no more a-roving\rSo late into the night,\rThough the heart be still as loving,\rAnd the moon be still as bright ...\"\r In Bradbury's 1948 story, part of \"The Martian Chronicles,\" one of the human characters recites the poem in grief for the dying Martian civilization. When his crewmates are disrespectful, he channels his mourning into direct and violent action. Even far from Earth, the Moon inspires both reflection and lunacy. \n"}]}
