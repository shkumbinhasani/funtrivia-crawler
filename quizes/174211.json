This time he plays Eugene Jerome, an army private from New York Ciy misplaced in Biloxi, Mississippi.  Broderick's character is based loosely on Neil Simon's personal experience, and he does a wonderful job bringing the character alive.  A very notable performance in this film is also turned in by Christopher Walken, who plays the somewhat loopy Sgt. Toomey. \n"}, {"text": "'Family Business' was a 1989 film that featured Broderick alongside two wonderful long-time actors.

There are some memorable moments, however, with the great actors featured here.  If anyone shines in his role, it would have to be Mr. Connery, who plays Jessie McMullen, the patriarch of the McMullen family. \n"}, {"text": "Broderick not only appeared in 'Family Business' in 1989, but also in the excellent war film 'Glory'.  In this film, Matthew plays a young Colonel prepared to lead a legion of black soldiers into battle against the south during the U.S. Civil War.  What was his character's name in 'Glory'?", "correct": "Robert Shaw", "options": ["Cabot Forbes", "Thomas Searles", "Henry Russell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Shaw.\n\n\tNot only is Broderick's performance of high quality, he is also surrounded by an all-star cast which included Denzel Washington as Private Trip (Oscar winner for 'Best Supporting Actor'), Morgan Freeman as Sergeant Major John Rawlins and Andre Braugher as Corporal Thomas Searles.  This is one of the best films I have seen on the American Civil War. \n"}, {"text": "Matthew Broderick isn't much for voice-over work, but he did provide one of the lead voices in which of these huge Disney animated hits?", "correct": "The Lion King", "options": ["Pocahontas", "Aladdin", "Beauty and the Beast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Lion King.\n\n\tBroderick portrayed the voice of the adult Simba in Disney's 'The Lion King'.

Though it was rather unpopular amongst film fans in general, I found Carrey's performance to be rather amusing.  Matthew Broderick does a great job of making Carrey's character look especially creepy with his straight man performance.  The film also features Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Owen Wilson, Andy Dick and Jack Black in supporting roles, making it even more worthy of a look!
