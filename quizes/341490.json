However, unlike Paul's other letters, he does not mention himself in this epistle. \n"}, {"text": "Complete this Bible verse from Hebrews 2:18. \"For in that he himself hath suffered being ___________ he is able to succour them that are ___________. What is the missing word in the King James Version?", "correct": "tempted", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ntempted.\n\n\tI had to look up the word \"succour\" and I found that it means help. \r This Bible verse is a reference to when Jesus was in the wilderness for 40 days and was tempted by Satan during that time. \n"}, {"text": "To what does Hebrews 4:12 compare the Word of God?", "correct": "a two-edged sword", "options": ["a smoldering fire", "a strong government", "a house of stone"], "explanation": "\n\n\na two-edged sword.\n\n\tIt says in Hebrews 4:12, \"For the Word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\" \r This verse is very visual as it shows God's word and the strength it possesses. \n"}, {"text": "In Hebrews 6:9 (King James Version), the author speaks of better things that accompany what?", "correct": "salvation", "options": ["love", "sharing", "faith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsalvation.\n\n\tIt says in Hebrews 6:9, \"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.\" \r In the beliefs of many Christians, someone obtains salvation when he or she believes that Christ lived a perfect life, died for his or her sins on a cross, was buried for three days and then rose again on the third day. It is generally taught that people who accept this gift of salvation will live forever in Heaven with Jesus one day. \n"}, {"text": "According to Hebrews 8:11 (King James Version), \"all shall know\" God, from the what to the what?", "correct": "least to the greatest", "options": ["youngest to the oldest", "slowest to the fastest", "dumbest to the smartest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nleast to the greatest.\n\n\tIt says in Hebrews 8:11, \"And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother saying, know the Lord; for all shall know Me, from the least to the greatest.\" \r This can be compared to the Old Testament, when only the Jews were considered God's people.

What is the definition of \"faith\" according to this chapter in the King James Version?", "correct": "The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.", "options": ["Believing in something when common sense tells you not to.", "Dedication to a master.", "Trusting that it'll all be good in the end."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\n\n\tIt says in Hebrews 11:1, \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\"\r The word \"hope\" in this verse is not like \"I hope I get a new bike for Christmas\", where one does not know but really wants it.
