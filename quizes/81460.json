He wanted to keep innovating and making progress. Needing a hit, however, he condescended to make one of his few sequels \"Son of Flubber.\" What hit film was this a sequel to?", "correct": "The Absent-Minded Professor", "options": ["The Misadventures of Merlin Jones", "Flubber", "Moon Pilot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Absent-Minded Professor.\n\n\tThe original still holds up over the abysmal Robin Williams remake. \n"}, {"text": "I almost forgot about this other sequel. What is the \"sequel\" to \"Old Yeller\"?", "correct": "Savage Sam", "options": ["Nikki, Wild Dog of the North", "Big Red", "The Legend of Lobo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSavage Sam.\n\n\tThis story by the same author features the same characters. If you think \"Old Yeller\" is disturbing, don't watch this film with family members under 6. It's pretty intense. Anyone that thinks Disney is all furry animals and magic and far removed from the harsh realities of life really ought to check out both these films. \n"}, {"text": "Disney launched a True-Life Adventure series of shorts beginning with \"Seal Island\" in 1949. That short won so many awards and the series proved so popular that, in addition to shorts, several full-length feature films were released entirely like the nature specials except that they were over an hour long. Which of these is NOT one of those feature-length nature specials released to theaters?", "correct": "Mysteries of the Deep", "options": ["Jungle Cat", "The Vanishing Prairie", "The African Lion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMysteries of the Deep.\n\n\t\"Mysteries of the Deep\" was a short. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these was a Sherman Brothers' musical that was made with the hope that it would be another success along the lines of \"Mary Poppins\"?", "correct": "The Happiest Millionaire", "options": ["Greyfriars Bobby", "Pollyanna", "Miracle of the White Stallions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Happiest Millionaire.\n\n\tThis was Disney's last live-action feature before his death in 1966. It was a colossal flop, and take it from a Disney fan, it is not very good. \n"}, {"text": "What is the film that was made at the same time as \"The Three Caballeros\" and was supposed to be sort of a \"making of\" picture?", "correct": "Saludos Amigos", "options": ["Lake Titicaca", "Seven Cities of Antarctica", "Aquarela Do Brazil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaludos Amigos.\n\n\t\"The Three Caballeros\" was a propaganda film made during WWII to help foster amnity between the USA and Latin America. While flying down to Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico to do research with his animators, Disney took a lot of film footage of the trip. Not one to let anything go to waste, he released it as a feature along with the cartoons \"El Gaucho Goofy\", \"Lake Titicaca\", \"Pedro\", and \"Aquarela Do Brasil.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which very early Disney full-length film featured popular comedian of the time Robert Benchley as a studio gate-crasher trying to meet Walt Disney and who then learns how a cartoon is created?", "correct": "The Reluctant Dragon", "options": ["Ben and Me", "Casey at the Bat", "Peter and the Wolf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Reluctant Dragon.\n\n\tThough the cartoon is normally shown by itself these days, it was originally a full-length feature. It was Disney's way of making profit on a cartoon that would probably have lost money if it stood on its own. \n"}, {"text": "\"Pecos Bill\", \"Johnny Appleseed\" and \"Little Toot\" are all cartoons featured in which full-length movie?", "correct": "Melody Time", "options": ["Fun and Fancy Free", "Make Mine Music", "Saludos Amigos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMelody Time.\n\n\tDuring WWII, when the Disney studio was hurting because the European markets had been cut off, most of the cartoons lost money. To compensate for that, Disney released them as a feature-length anthology of cartoons revolving around similar themes, usually music. These are among the most forgotten of the Disney animated features, which is a real shame. I think they are fantastic, and contain some of the studios finest material including \"Willie the Operatic Whale\", \"Peter and the Wolf\" and \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of these classic adventure stories was not made by Disney?", "correct": "Ivanhoe", "options": ["Kidnapped", "Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue", "The Fighting Prince of Donegal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIvanhoe.\n\n\t\"Ivanhoe\" was made by MGM, I believe. \n"}, {"text": "Disney made one feature-length war documentary released to theaters.
