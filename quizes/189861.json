{"id": "189861", "name": "The Film History of Ben Kingsley Online Trivia | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed E-K", "K - People Themed"], "questions": [{"text": "It's not often that an actor's feature film career takes off with an Oscar winning performance, but in the case of Ben Kingsley this occurred in 1982 with his impeccable performance as the title character in 'Gandhi'.  Oddly enough, this was Kingsley's only Oscar nomination of the 20th century.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, Kingsley was also nominated, but did not win, for his performance in a supporting role in the 1991 film 'Bugsy'.  Kingsley was also Oscar-nominated for his performances in the 2000 film 'Sexy Beast' and the 2003 film 'House of Sand and Fog'.  Kingsley's inauspicious film debut came in 1972's 'Fear is the Key', and he did not perform in another full-length feature film until 'Gandhi' a decade later. \n"}, {"text": "With whom did Ben Kingsley appear in the interesting 1983 drama 'Betrayal', directed by David Hugh Jones and based on the play by Harold Pinter?", "correct": "Jeremy Irons", "options": ["Harrison Ford", "Jeff Goldblum", "James Earl Jones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeremy Irons.\n\n\tIf you enjoyed the film 'Memento', this one might be for you.  'Betrayal' plays in reverse time order, as does 'Memento', though over a much longer time period.  The theme is adultery and its effects on two very close friends (played, of course, by Kingsley and Irons).  You can't find better acting talent than is displayed in this film. \n"}, {"text": "Many an actor has taken his turn as either Sherlock Holmes or as his faithful assistant Dr. John Watson.  In which film does Kingsley play the part of Watson opposite Michael Caine's Holmes?", "correct": "Without a Clue", "options": ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "The Masks of Death", "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWithout a Clue.\n\n\tKingsley takes his place among some other famous Watsons, including the masters Nigel Bruce and Hubert Willis, and other famous actors such as Robert Duvall and James Mason.  The interesting twist in this film (part comedy, part mystery crime thriller) is that Kingsley's Watson performs the real detective duties, while Caine appears as a drunken actor named Reginald Kincaid, who has been only hired to play the part of Holmes. \n"}, {"text": "Typically, I wouldn't include a made-for-television movie in a quiz like this, but I think this one deserves special mention.  In 1989, Kingsley acted in a televised film called 'Murderers Among Us'.  What was the subtitle of this film?", "correct": "The Simon Wiesenthal Story", "options": ["The Otto Frank Story", "The Elie Wiesel Story", "The Shalom Aleichem Story"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Story.\n\n\tSimon Wiesenthal was the famous 'Nazi Hunter', a Jew who lived through the Holocaust and dedicated his post-war life to tracking down Nazi leaders such as Adolf Eichmann and Klaus Barbee.  Kingsley's performance in this true-life story is riveting and worth a watch. \n"}, {"text": "Kingsley is always one for historical dramas.  Take the 1991 film 'Bugsy', where he plays which of these individuals who was involved in Bugsy Siegel's life?", "correct": "Meyer Lansky", "options": ["George Raft", "Harry Greenberg", "Mickey Cohen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeyer Lansky.\n\n\tIn 'Bugsy', the parts of Greenberg, Raft and Cohen were played by Elliot Gould, Joe Mantegna and Harvey Keitel, respectively.  Siegel was portrayed by Warren Beatty, while Annette Bening played his lady-love Virginia Hill.  Of the cast, Beatty, Keitel and Kingsley were all nominated for Oscars, though none of them took home the prize. \n"}, {"text": "In one of the great films of all time, Kingsley is featured as Itzhak Stern, the accountant and conscience of Oskar Schindler.  This is, of course, 'Schindler's List'.  Under whose direction did Kingsley ably work in this cinematic masterpiece?", "correct": "Steven Spielberg", "options": ["Barry Levinson", "Stanley Kubrick", "Richard Attenborough"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteven Spielberg.\n\n\tUndoubtedly, 'Schindler's List' is the greatest film of Spielberg's career.  Aside from his performance in 'Gandhi', this marks, in my mind, Kingsley's most magnificent acting work.  Kingsley's sober intensity reveals the many-faceted character that was Itzhak Stern, the man truly responsible for the assembling and maintenance of the list attributed to Schindler.  Sadly, Kingsley was not honored with even an Oscar nomination for his awesome performance! \n"}, {"text": "Ben Kingsley appeared in a charming little political comedy in 1993 called 'Dave' as Gary Nance.  What position did Kingsley's character have in the government in this film?", "correct": "Vice President", "options": ["White House Chief of Staff", "President", "Senator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVice President.\n\n\tBen Kingsley plays another character of conscience in this film, the incorruptable Vice President Gary Nance.  While the title character Dave Kovic, played by Kevin Kline, impersonates the corrupt President Bill Mitchell, who has had a stroke, he gets to know Nance and finds him to be a true man of character.  Dave hands the reins of government over to Nance by the end of the film.  Also look for entertaining performances by Sigourney Weaver, Ving Rhames, Frank Langella and Charles Grodin in this one. \n"}, {"text": "In a very unusual career move, Kingsley decided to try his hand at science fiction. In which 1995 film did he play a character called Xavier Fitch?", "correct": "Species", "options": ["Alien: Resurrection", "Resident Evil", "Predator II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpecies.\n\n\tKingsley has not always made the best career decisions, as he seeks a wide variety of acting roles.  This is an example of one of his lesser films, though there is some entertainment value. 'Species' is a sci-fi thriller wherein Kingsley plays government agent Fitch, who goes after a woman that has had her DNA spliced with some alien DNA.  You can figure out the rest, I'm sure. \n"}, {"text": "In perhaps Mr. Kingsley's most dynamic performance, he portrays the insanely domineering Don Logan who heads a group of individuals involved in the break-in of a bank vault.  What is the name of this film?", "correct": "Sexy Beast", "options": ["Suspect Zero", "Parting Shots", "The Confession"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSexy Beast.\n\n\tYou really have to see 'Sexy Beast' to believe it.  I find it unbelievable that the same man who played Gandhi and Itzhak Stern could put in a performance as such an egocentric madman as Don Logan.  If you don't understand cockney accents you may need to use your subtitles to really get the gist of what Logan is all about in this hilariously dark comedy-drama. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Kingsley plays the regal, cocksure Behrani in the 2003 film 'House of Sand and Fog'.  From what country have Behrani and his family immigrated to the United States in this film?", "correct": "Iran", "options": ["Saudi Arabia", "India", "Pakistan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIran.\n\n\tBehrani's family were obviously of the upper crust in Iran, but have had to make do with a dwindling family fortune since the fall of the Shah in 1979.  Behrani finds a deal he cannot pass up when Kathy, played by Jennifer Connelly, loses her house to the city as a result of a paperwork mix-up.  The two characters' struggle to claim ownership to the house ultimately leads to a shocking conclusion that I will not reveal here!  I will, however, recommend the film.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it and will try many other quizzes on this site. \n"}]}
