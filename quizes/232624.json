{"id": "232624", "name": "Odd Pok\u00e9mon in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, and Yellow\" Online Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Pokemon Games", " Pokemon Red/ Blue/Yellow"], "questions": [{"text": "In \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", you can choose between three starter Pok\u00e9mon.  Which is the only one that starts with or learns the technique 'Leer'?", "correct": "Charmander", "options": ["None of them learn Leer", "Squirtle", "Bulbasaur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharmander.\n\n\tIn \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", one can choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle.  Each of these have completely different strengths and weaknesses, so you'll need to determine which would best suit you for your journey.  You can pick your first Pok\u00e9mon in the beginning of the game at Professor Oak's lab in Pallet Town.  In \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", you don't start with any of these Pok\u00e9mon.  Instead, you have no choice but to use Pikachu throughout the whole game.  You will be able to find the other three Pok\u00e9mon in certain towns through the game though.\rLeer is learned by Charmander at level 15 and it will lower a Pok\u00e9mon's defence when used. \n"}, {"text": "Which Pok\u00e9mon can not be made in the Cinnabar Island lab?", "correct": "Mewtwo", "options": ["Kabuto", "Omanyte", "Aerodactyl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMewtwo.\n\n\tIf you happen to pick up a Helix Fossil or a Dome Fossil in Mt. Moon or a sample of Old Amber from the Pewter City Museum of Science, you can take it to the lab on Cinnabar Island, extract the DNA, and create seemingly extinct Pok\u00e9mon.  The Helix Fossil becomes Omanyte, which evolves into Omastar at level 40, the Dome Fossil becomes Kabuto who evolves into Kabutops at level 40, and the Old Amber becomes Aerodactyl, which has no evolutions.  This is the only way to add these Pok\u00e9mon to your collection in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red, Yellow, and Blue\". \n"}, {"text": "Where in Celadon City can one find an Eevee?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Mansion", "options": ["Game Corner", "Outside the Gym", "The Department Store"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Mansion.\n\n\tEevee is an odd Pok\u00e9mon that can only be found in the mansion in Celadon City.  To find it, you need to go around the houses on the north end of town.  Once you get it, you can learn its normal moves (the last is at level 42 in \"Yellow\" and 45 in \"Red Blue\") or you can evolve it into Vaporeon, Flareon, or Jolteon early and take advantage of certain type-specific moves. These are learned all the way up to level 52 in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\" or level 54 in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\".  Although you only get one in the game, you can get more into your game using \"Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\" or a Game Boy Link Cable.  Your rival starts with an Eevee in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\" while you begin with a Pikachu. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only city where can one find a Porygon?", "correct": "Celadon City", "options": ["Saffron City", "Indigo Plateau", "Cinnabar Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCeladon City.\n\n\tPorygon is quite an odd Pok\u00e9mon.  Using its solid shell and odd type-changing attacks, Porygon can be a good Pok\u00e9mon for the team.  In all three games, Porygon can only be acquired by earning enough from the Game Corner and by exchanging your coins for one at the Exchange Corner next door.  In \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Yellow\", you'll need a total of 9,999 coins, but in \"Pok\u00e9mon Blue\", you'll only need 6,500.  You can also exchange these for other Pok\u00e9mon or TMs.  To play the slots and collect coins, you'll need a Coin Case, so search Celadon for someone who's willing to give theirs up.  Porygon learns normal and psychic-type moves. \n"}, {"text": "Which Pok\u00e9mon do you need the Silph Scope to see in Lavender Town?", "correct": "Marowak", "options": ["Gengar", "Haunter", "Cubone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarowak.\n\n\tThe Marowak that requires the Silph Scope can be found on the penultimate floor of the Pok\u00e9mon Tower at the staircase to the top floor.  In order to battle it, you need to use the Silph Scope to get a clear image of it.  The Silph Scope can be found in Giovanni's office in the Game Corner in Celadon City. Once the item is used, you can fight Cubone's mother and save Mr. Fuji.  The Silph Scope is not used elsewhere in the game, and Marowaks can be captured on Victory Road, in the Unknown Dungeon, and (in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\") Safari Zone.  Another way to get one is by catching a wild Cubone in the Pok\u00e9mon Tower and evolving it. \n"}, {"text": "How many Snorlaxes can be found in each game?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Four", "Three", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tSnorlax is one of quite a few rare Pok\u00e9mon in the game.  Since there's only two in the game, you can't make many mistakes when trying to capture at least one.  One can be found on Route 16 between Cycling Road and Celadon City, and the other can be found on the bridged Route 12 just east of Vermilion City. These Pok\u00e9mon will be sleeping and refuse to wake up so they'll act as Road Blocks until you get a Pok\u00e9flute.  When you wake them up, they'll immediately battle you.  Snorlaxes usually attack with Headbutt, and will restore their health with the Rest attack.  During this attack, it will fall asleep for a few turns before it can do anything. It has no evolutions. \n"}, {"text": "Hitmonlee can be found in the Fighting Dojo.  What other Pok\u00e9mon could you choose after beating the Karate Master?", "correct": "Hitmonchan", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHitmonchan.\n\n\tHitmonlee and Hitmonchan are both rare fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon that can only be obtained after you defeat the Karate Master in the Fighting Dojo of Saffron City.  These Pok\u00e9mon vary from each other.  While Hitmonlee uses fierce kicks, Hitmonchan uses punches of different styles and elements (eg. Fire Punch, Ice Punch, etc.).  Both of these Pok\u00e9mon have attacks that no other Pok\u00e9mon in the game will have.  Both Pok\u00e9mon will be level 30 when you obtain them, and they can both learn five new attacks through experience. \n"}, {"text": "Which water Pok\u00e9mon, whose Pok\u00e9dex number is 131, can not be obtained in a battle?", "correct": "Lapras", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLapras.\n\n\tLapras is another extremely rare Pok\u00e9mon in the game simply because only one can be found through the adventure.  In order to obtain your very own Lapras, you need to find a certain person in the Silph Co. building in Saffron City and talk to them.  After this, they'll hand over their Lapras.  Lapras is classified as a water/ice-type Pok\u00e9mon, and it may be the perfect Pok\u00e9mon to send you Surfing across the sea.  Lapras will learn Sing, Water Gun, and Hydro Pump among other attacks. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these locations would you not find one of the three legendary bird Pok\u00e9mon of \"Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, and Yellow\"?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Mansion", "options": ["Seafoam Islands", "Power Plant", "Victory Road"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Mansion.\n\n\tThe three legendary bird Pok\u00e9mon of these three games are Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres, and although many legendary bird Pok\u00e9mon have been added to the proceeding games, these three are probably the most well-known.  Articuno, the ice bird, can be found in Seafoam Islands, and can specialize in ice and water attacks. Zapdos is in the Power Plant to the north-east and learns electric-type attacks.  Thirdly, Moltres is found near the end of the game on Victory Road to the north-west.  Moltres specializes in fire attacks.  Since all three are birds, they can all learn HM02 which contains Fly.  All three can be caught in all three games, though it might be tough without the Missing_No cheat! \n"}, {"text": "Mewtwo, probably the most famous legendary Pok\u00e9mon in these three games, can be found in the Unknown Dungeon.  Which town or city is the Unknown Dungeon closest to?", "correct": "Cerulean City", "options": ["Pewter City", "Fuchsia City", "Cinnabar Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCerulean City.\n\n\tAlthough you come across Cerulean City quite early in the game, the Unknown Dungeon remains inaccessible until you are able to use HM03 (Surf) outside of battle.  The Unknown Dungeon contains some of the strongest wild Pok\u00e9mon in the game as well as the elusive Mewtwo.  Many find that it's impossible to catch this Pok\u00e9mon, but with the Master Ball given to you by the head of Silph Co. in Saffron City, you can immediately catch the Pok\u00e9mon. Mewtwo specializes in psychic attacks.  Although Mewtwo is regarded as one of the most difficult Pok\u00e9mon to obtain in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, and Yellow\", the staff behind the game released the even more elusive Mew to the public, and it surpassed Mewtwo as one of the rarest Pok\u00e9mon. \n"}]}
