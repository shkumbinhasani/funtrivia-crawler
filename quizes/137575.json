{"id": "137575", "name": "Achilles, Mighty Greek Warrior Quiz | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Greek Myth", "Men and Gods"], "questions": [{"text": "At his birth, the ancient Greek warrior Achilles was dipped into a river in Hades by his mother Thetis in order to make him invulnerable.  In which hellish stream did Achilles receive this somewhat incomplete baptism?  ", "correct": "Styx", "options": ["Lethe", "Acheron", "Phlegethon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStyx.\n\n\tThetis made the unfortunate error, as I'm sure you're all aware, of not dipping Achilles entirely into the infernal waters of the Styx.  His heel, where Thetis grasped her son, was left vulnerable...apparently mom did not want to get her fingers wet! \n"}, {"text": "Thetis was the mother of this fierce Greek champion, but who was her husband and the father of the hero of the 'Iliad'?  ", "correct": "Peleus", "options": ["Oedipus", "Ajax", "Priam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeleus.\n\n\tPeleus was of relatively low birth, being only the king of Thessaly.  The lucky chap was fortunate to marry Thetis, who was a Nereid (a sea nymph), and a beautiful one at that, so gorgeous in fact that Zeus himself came after her (but then again, who didn't he come after?)  Peleus was not without accomplishment, however...he was a member of Jason's Argonauts, and took part in the hunt for the Calydonian boar alongside Atalanta.  No doubt some mention should be made here of their wedding...at which Eris (Strife) challenged Paris to choose the most beautiful goddess by handing out a golden apple, thus putting into play events that would lead to the Trojan War. \n"}, {"text": "For a time as a child, Achilles was handed over by Thetis (who wanted to hide Achilles away) to Chiron, who was to be his overseer and mentor during his youthful years.   What type of mythical creature was this Chiron?  ", "correct": "Centaur", "options": ["Hydra", "Griffon", "Basilisk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCentaur.\n\n\tHalf man, half horse, the centaurs were gentle and wise creatures with a penchant for drinking, who paradoxically were quite adept at making war.  Chiron, the wisest and most pious of these creatures, agrees to care for Achilles, but soon loses control of the rambunctious child.  Achilles' mischief provokes Chiron to insist that Thetis take her child back, much to her chagrin.  You see, she left Achilles with Chiron in the hopes that he would stay out of trouble, and to avoid his eventual fate (to die in battle.) \n"}, {"text": "After the failure of Chiron to rein in and control young Achilles, Thetis decides to dress the poor boy as a girl, in hopes that he would not be noticed by the developing armies of Greece.  Which Greek hero cleverly sees through this ruse?  ", "correct": "Odysseus", "options": ["Meneleus", "Aeneas", "Jason"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOdysseus.\n\n\tAchilles initially finds being disguised as a female quite repulsive, but learns to find new love for the situation when he manages to develop a relationship with King Lycomedes' daughter Deidamia, with whom he eventually marries and impregnates.  His son and only offspring Neoptolemus is born of this union.  Odysseus, the ever clever hero of his own sequel to the 'Iliad', finds Achilles out by way of a clever plot...blowing a horn that only a warlike male would answer.  War approaches. \n"}, {"text": "Our hero Achilles eventually becomes king of a certain group of 'ant men', mentioned in Homer's 'Iliad'.  By what term are these ant warriors known?  \n", "correct": "Myrmidons", "options": ["Lapiths", "Scythians", "Lacedemonians"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMyrmidons.\n\n\tThe Myrmidons were warriors of Thessaly, from whence Achilles came.  Achilles was king of these warriors, who were said to have originated as ants, but were morphed into warriors by the gods to serve as an army for Achilles' grandfather Aeacus. \n"}, {"text": "Entering the Trojan War as a general, Achilles established himself as one of the most able leaders of the Greek army, administering defeat after defeat upon his weary enemies.  Despite this great success, Achilles feuds with the Achaean king and commander of all Greek forces...namely, whom?  ", "correct": "Agamemnon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAgamemnon.\n\n\tAgamemnon was the King of Achaea, a stalwart man no doubt, but this fellow really overstepped his boundaries at times...sacrificing his own daughter Iphigenia, and threatening to steal Achilles' new girlfriend (see next question!) \n"}, {"text": "And naturally, the feud between the Achaean king and Achilles was instigated over a woman, with whom our hero had fallen deeply in love.  Who was the object of Achilles' deepest affections?   \n", "correct": "Briseis", "options": ["Eugenia", "Harmothoe", "Helena"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBriseis.\n\n\tLike many other women of Greek myth (see Helen, Medea, Clytemnestra, etc. etc.), Briseis was at the center of a controversy that cost lives.  Briseis was captured by Achilles during one of his raids, and soon became a willing captive when the Greek warrior fell enthralled by her beauty.  Soon, however, Agamemnon decided to claim Briseis for his own, infuriating the smitten Achilles to the point where the latter retired to his tent, refusing to further take part in the war. For her part, Achilles mother Thetis enjoined Zeus to rain failure upon Agamemnon's army until the object of her son's affection was returned to him.\n"}, {"text": "Without adequate resolution of the controversy involving his lady love, Achilles continues to resist re-entering the hostilities against Troy.   Unwilling himself to lead an army, his best friend decides to lead Achilles' followers in his stead.  Who was Achilles' best friend, a victim of tragedy in his own right?  ", "correct": "Patroclus", "options": ["Tiresius", "Philolaus", "Memnon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatroclus.\n\n\tPatroclus leads the Myrmidons at their vanguard, and suffers cruel death at the hands of the powerful Trojan warrior Hector for his troubles.  Nothing works in tragedies more powerfully than a reason for revenge... \n"}, {"text": "Finally realizing the folly of his puerile behavior after seeing the death of his most beloved compatriot, Achilles reconciles himself with the Greek king and leads his fellows into final battle at Troy.  During this battle, Achilles exacts bitter revenge against his fearsome rival, the man responsible for his close friend's untimely demise.  Name this chief rival of Achilles.  ", "correct": "Hector", "options": ["Pontus", "Aetreus", "Etion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHector.\n\n\tAfter violently removing Hector from the fray, Achilles drags his rival's body around Troy several times until a king's ransom is paid by Priam, king of Troy.  The victorious Achilles hasn't time to celebrate however... \n"}, {"text": "As the prophecy was foretold to his mother, Achilles falls at the end of the final battle at Troy, feeling the sting of an arrow's shaft in his one vulnerable body area, the heel.   The wielder of the instrument responsible for Achilles' death is either Paris, hero of Troy, or which of these gods?  ", "correct": "Apollo", "options": ["Ares", "Athena", "Artemis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApollo.\n\n\tPredictions foretold that Achilles would die in the battle of Troy, a war that it was prophesied could not be won without the young man's leadership.  And we know that in Greek myths, the words of a soothsayer always come true!  Poor Achilles, vulnerable only in such an inaccessible spot on his body, and yet struck down so easily by the arrow of one Paris (with the aid of Apollo, or by Apollo himself...we don't know!)  Now he is one for the ages, as is this quiz...I hope you enjoyed! \n"}]}
