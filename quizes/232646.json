{"id": "232646", "name": "Psalm - Book 2 Quiz | Old Testament / Tanakh | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "  Old Testament / Tanakh", " Psalms"], "questions": [{"text": "What does Psalm 42:11 say to put your hope in?", "correct": "God", "options": ["yourself", "the Yankees", "government"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGod.\n\n\tPsalm 42:11 \"Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.\"\r Most of the Psalms were written by David (the same one who fought and beat Goliath). \n"}, {"text": "What does the Psalmist tell us to do in Psalm 47:1?", "correct": "Clap your hands", "options": ["read the Scriptures", "the Tango", "sleep"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClap your hands.\n\n\tPsalm 47:1 \"Clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.\"\r The Psalms are very poetic and discuss a lot about being joyous and dancing, singing, hand clapping. David has a lot to be happy about because he knows with God he has everything. \n"}, {"text": "According to Psalm 48:10 what is \"thy right hand\" full of?", "correct": "righteousness", "options": ["bread", "money", "nothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nrighteousness.\n\n\tPsalm 48:10 \"According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.\"\r 'Righteous' means 'free from sin'. \n"}, {"text": "In Psalm 49:15, what does the Psalmist ask God to redeem his soul from?", "correct": "power of the grave", "options": ["despair over taxes", "agony of marriage", "power of the female"], "explanation": "\n\n\npower of the grave.\n\n\tPsalm 49:15 \"But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.\"\r As discussed later, in the New Testament, Christians believe that this \"power of the grave\" comes in the form of Jesus. By accepting him as Savior, Christians believe they can overcome the grave because their bodies die, but their souls live in Heaven forever with Him. (See Revelation 2:11 NIV, for a verse that discusses overcoming the grave.) \n"}, {"text": "What does it say the mouth is given to in Psalm 50:19 (King James Version)? ", "correct": "Evil", "options": ["Jokes", "Gossip", "Miserableness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvil.\n\n\tPsalm 50:19 \"Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.\"\r There are many verses in the Bible that make reference to the mouth and tongue being evil. This is because by lying, calling names, and other such things, the mouth can destroy a person. \n"}, {"text": "What is the tongue compared to in Psalm 52:2?", "correct": "sharp razor", "options": ["mad bull", "fast train", "strong mussel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsharp razor.\n\n\tPsalm 52:2 \"The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.\"\r I once read somewhere that the tongue is the heaviest of all muscles and that's why for so many it's hard to hold. Unfortunately, our words can hurt others more than any sword. After all, a sword can kill, and it's over. Words can continue to harm over and over again. \n"}, {"text": "Who says in their heart there is no God according to Psalm 53:1 (King James Version)?", "correct": "a fool & fool & the fool", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\na fool & fool & the fool.\n\n\tPsam 53:1 \"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.\"\r This is a very serious charge because, later on, Jesus tells the disciples in Matthew 5:22 (paraphrased from KJV) that whoever calls someone a fool is in danger of hell fire. \n"}, {"text": "According to Psalm 58:4, the wicked are like the deaf what?", "correct": "adder", "options": ["dalmatian", "bat", "camel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nadder.\n\n\tPsalm 58:4 \"Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear.\"\r Adders are a type of snake, and they really do have a hearing problem. Due to this their other senses are keener (from Nature Photographers online Magazine). \n"}, {"text": "Who is God a father to according to Psalm 68:5 (King James Version)?", "correct": "the fatherless", "options": ["the poor", "the weak", "the ones who listen the best"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe fatherless.\n\n\tPslam 68:5 \"A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.\"\r Of course, God is seen as Father to all, even those with fathers. But those believers without earthly fathers can take comfort in knowing they have a Father who cares about them more than any father here on earth ever could. \n"}, {"text": "Who is David's father (he is mentioned in Psalm 72:20)?", "correct": "Jesse", "options": ["John", "Joseph", "Jeremy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJesse.\n\n\tPsalm 72:20 \"The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.\"\r David's grandfather was Obed, who was the son of Boaz and Ruth.
