{"id": "373771", "name": "Fifty Shades of Grey Trivia Quiz | Authors | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors H-K", "J"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of Anastasia's roommate who asks her to interview Christian Grey on her behalf?", "correct": "Katherine", "options": ["Kristine", "Samantha", "Amanda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKatherine.\n\n\tMousey college girl Anastasia Steele, not really the journalist type, ends up goaded into an interview with, as she says, the \"enigmatic CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.\", by her sick roommate, and literally stumbles into his office.  Fortunately, it doesn't matter; both his immediate flirting and her cumbersome aloofness and naivety make their first meeting both awkward and enticing at the same time (I assume).  She keeps thinking of him as a control freak...he keeps rubbing his index finger against his bottom lip...and yet there's something attracting her to him. Over the coming days she can't seem to stop thinking of Mr. Grey, brushing off her dreams of him as a subconscious desire to purge him from her life, but when he shows up at the hardware store where she works looking to buy varying lengths of ropes and cables, she realizes she may actually like him. A coffee date with him the next day only confirms this fact. \n"}, {"text": "Anastasia receives an expensive first-edition copy of what book as a gift from Christian?", "correct": "Tess of the d'Urbervilles", "options": ["Lolita", "The Scarlet Letter", "Pride and Prejudice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTess of the d'Urbervilles.\n\n\tAnastasia runs off after the coffee date, and her finals become the main priority, since an immediate jump into the workforce is of the utmost importance during this point in her life.  After her final exam, though, she returns home to find a non-descript package containing first-edition copies of \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\", one of her favourite books.  It's definitely from Grey, and although she's warned away by her 'inner goddess', for some reason she simply can't.  Something compels her so.\rThat night, while celebrating at a bar with Katherine, Anastasia decides to phone Grey on her cell to ask about the books.  Soon after, in a frightening turn of events, he tracks her phone signal and shows up at the bar with his brother.  They dance until she passes out on the dance floor.\rIn a weirder turn of events, Grey brings her back to his hotel room and they lay it out; he suggests she work at his company, but because she and Katherine are moving (of course, another major life change), she's hesitant to do so.  He also states that he wants to date her, but he will not touch her without written consent.  He means this literally; there's a contract and everything.  She has to leave though, so in a fleeting and pretty gross moment, she sneaks the use of his toothbrush, dries her hair, and heads to work.  It doesn't matter; Christian is into that.  He promises to helicopter out to Seattle that night before they make out in an elevator. \n"}, {"text": "When Anastasia visits Christian's apartment for the first time and signs a non-disclosure agreement, she's invited to explore which of these?", "correct": "His 'play room'", "options": ["His wine cellar", "His library", "His office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis 'play room'.\n\n\tChristian Grey, being the enigmatic CEO of a corporation that he is, takes Anastasia on a helicopter ride (her first!) and lays out some pretty obvious come-ons and flirting-type moves.  When the time actually comes for her to sign a non-disclosure agreement about their relationship which, in retrospect, is probably the first warning sign after telling her that he needs her to read a contract before he can touch her, she signs immediately, because she's so enraptured. Without really taking it in, Anastasia is shown through Christian's apartment to his 'Play Room', actually 'The Red Room of Pain' where he certainly does NOT play Xbox as Ana seems to think in the beginning. It's here that Christian reveals he is a Dominant and wants her to live with him on occasion, though in her own room, and does not want an actual loving relationship.  They review an extensive rule list in the contract before Ana reveals that she's never slept with someone before.  Of course, because things have to happen, Christian decides to change that.  Wouldn't you know it, though, Christian is the brooding, enigmatic type, so when Ana awakens in the middle of the night, she finds him sitting at a grand piano playing a melancholy Bach piece.  The two spend the next day together as well, until they're rudely interrupted by Christian's mother in a sitcom-esque turn of events.  How silly. \n"}, {"text": "Ana's roommate, although hesitant about the growing relationship between her and Christian, isn't really in a place to talk since she's actually dating who of the following?", "correct": "Christian's brother", "options": ["Christian's father", "Her cousin", "A different business magnate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristian's brother.\n\n\tAfter the debacle with Christian's mom showing up at the worst possible moment, Ana returns home since, clearly, there are a lot of tumultuous life events happening on short notice.  This doesn't stop her from having an impromptu dinner with Christian, though; the two of them discuss the fact that Christian was actually a submissive partner in a BDSM relationship for six years before turning to his later ventures, though this made him the man he is today. Ana eventually slinks back home to return to packing and, in the meantime, she chats with Kate who, sincerely, urges her to avoid getting too serious with Christian because something's off about him. In the meantime, however, Kate's dating Grey's brother, so she's not really in a position to judge.  That night, Ana opens Christian's care package, a manila envelope containing the contract and agreements necessary for his dom/sub relationship to be binding (though, obviously, not in a legal sense).  The next day, she ends up receiving a laptop from Christian since, for some reason and in this century, she doesn't own one after four years of university education.  Ten minutes later she's already sending cheeky emails to her fling.  Ten minutes after that he actually shows up at her place, reminding her that they have a dinner date that week to discuss the paperwork.  Must be nice to waste money. \n"}, {"text": "Is Ray Steele Ana's biological father?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWednesday rolls around almost too quickly, and before Ana knows it she's already sliding herself into one of Katherine's slinky, purple dresses and a pair of stilettos to talk about the contract.  While in discussion, it becomes apparent that the two can't be in a room together.  She recognizes that he's using sex as a weapon to disarm her so she decides to do the same thing and ends up seductively chewing a stalk of asparagus and biting her lip every few seconds.  Eventually though, she has to leave; her graduation ceremony is in the morning and Christian is giving a speech during the event.\rThe next day, Ana's father (or, rather, her step-father), Ray Steele, comes by to escort her to the ceremony; her mother is tied up across the country (not literally, though you were probably thinking considering the novel) and can't make it.  The graduation goes along just fine; both Kate and Christian make speeches and the latter ends up talking about feeding third world countries and his adoption.  After she receives her diploma, Ana is shocked to find that Kate is introducing her fling to her step-father.  Luckily, Christian shares a mutual interest in fly fishing, so they hit it off.  That's when Ana decides to agree to his contract terms pending a discussion of their soft limits.  What a reward. \n"}, {"text": "What does Christian purchase for Ana as a graduation gift?", "correct": "A car", "options": ["A house", "A laptop", "Handcuffs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA car.\n\n\tShortly after the graduation, Ana and Christian butt heads over trivial things, though it mainly boils down to her feeling that he shouldn't have bought her the colossally expensive copy of \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\".  After a bit of petty chit-chat over wine, she also expresses her interest in interning at a publishing house, but only after the big move on the weekend.  They discuss the soft limits of their contract and Christian concedes to her requests, mainly because he feels something magical about her.  He also vows to put more into the idea of a relationship with her-- something more 'vanilla'-- but only if she accepts his graduation present to her, a red hatchback Audi.  Yes, her step-father already approved of it.\rThat evening, Ana meets Christian's 'dom' side full-force when she rolls her eyes at him and he punishes her with a spanking.  She cries over it, but he stays with her afterwards to show his support.  It's still a bit weird. \n"}, {"text": "While at dinner with the Greys, Ana and Christian sneak off to which part of the family estate?", "correct": "The boathouse", "options": ["The parlor", "The conservatory", "The ballroom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe boathouse.\n\n\tAfter their night together, Christian ends up late to work for the first time ever--something he's intrigued about, of course-- and, realizing she needs to be kept in constant contact with him, Ana is given another lavish gift, a Blackberry device.  In a twist, she decides not to pick up the phone after five calls and, as a result, Christian springs into action to find out what's wrong with her.  She wonders if, perhaps, he's smothering her, but the idea passes quickly.  After all, it's her first real boyfriend.  Shortly after, she and Kate move to Seattle.\rShortly after the move, the fateful Sunday arrives and when Ana reaches Christian's apartment she's greeted by an appointed OBGYN (which is a bit weird, but what isn't about the situation?).  Ana's given the all-clear and Christian invites her to dinner with his family shortly before taking her to his 'Red Room of Pain'.  After their union therein, he takes her panties hostage...just before the dinner party.  Oh how naughty and awkward.\rDinner with the Greys goes fine.  Elliott, his brother, plans to go with Kate on a trip to Barbados, and Christian is surprised when Ana reveals her intent to visit her mother out east.  He's angry with this plan, but she reiterates that they have yet to finalize their deal.  Christian gets even angrier when she brings up her friend, Jose, who sexually assaulted her at the bar a couple weeks prior (oh yeah, forgot to mention that).  Instead of staying angry with her, he sneaks her off to the boathouse to have some fun. \n"}, {"text": "Much of Christian's past is shrouded in mystery.  What does Ana discover about his biological mother?", "correct": "She died of an overdose", "options": ["She left the country", "She killed his father", "He never knew who she was, and still doesn't"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe died of an overdose.\n\n\tAna and Christian head off to the boathouse and Grey reveals that he's angry because no one has dared defy him before.  Despite this, he seems to like the feeling of it.  The two of them start to have their fun, but are interrupted by Christian's sister at the last moment and told that Kate and Elliott are heading out; they take the opportunity to do the same and hop into Christian's limo.  Along the way, Ana has a severe case of self-doubt and worries that she can't follow through with his expectations as a submissive partner.  Worried about their relationship, Christian begs her to stay, but sends her off to her mother's to consider the agreement.  Ana, negotiating the truth from Christian before they go to bed, uncovers the fact that Grey's mother was a drug addict and she died when he was four years old; he was adopted by the Greys shortly thereafter.\rAna, worried, of course, goes to her two internship interviews with publishing companies in the city before heading to the airport to discover that Christian not only found out what flight she was taking across the country, but upgraded her to first class.  What a jerk. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Ana's mother live?", "correct": "Georgia", "options": ["Florida", "South Carolina", "Mississippi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorgia.\n\n\tWhile on the plane, Ana gets the wise idea to send an impulsive 'jealousy' email to rile him up from the plane.  Upon arriving at the airport for her change-over in Atlanta she pulls back and sends a worried apology.  Nothing like temporary separation to spark anxiety.  Before she knows it, though, she's in Savannah in the open arms of her mother and new step-father who, she decides, is A-OK for her mom.  The two go to the beach and relax and, when Ana returns home, she and Christian are fine again (though not before an email essay).  The emailing gets a bit naughty before dinner, and she has to stop when she and her mother head to a nearby hotel for drinks at the bar.\rChristian can't leave well enough alone though; he shows up at the bar and introduces himself to Ana's mother.  When he leaves, Ana realizes she needs to be with him to make things right, and he reveals more of his past to her (including why he has scars on his chest).  This only makes her more leery, especially since he brings up a woman who was in his life in the past.  He asks about their agreement and both of them recognize that Ana is a horrible submissive partner.  The problem is that he considers his dominance a form of therapy.  He decides that he would like to do something for her the next day. \n"}, {"text": "What ends up being the breaking point for Ana's relationship with Christian?", "correct": "She experiences his harshest punishment", "options": ["She has to leave the country for work", "She finds him sleeping with someone else", "She's too jealous of his former lovers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe experiences his harshest punishment.\n\n\tChristian wakes Ana at 5:30am before dawn and takes her out in a glider, partaking in his second-favourite pastime.  It's thrilling to her to soar through the skies, but the duo lands in a field and drives off to IHOP, muttering seductive things about breakfast along the way (as one does).  They talk about mutually enjoying his compromises and she asks to sleep in his bed despite his reservations.  Fortunately, he agrees.\rWhile in Savannah, Ana receives a call about the publishing house job and everyone prepares for a good ol' celebration, but unfortunately, Christian has to return to Seattle early.  While he has 'a situation' that's clearly of concern to him, Ana worries about something banal-- what she said in her sleep the previous night-- to the point at which she obsesses over it.\rShe returns to Seattle the next day and Christian's so happy to see her that he says he bought her a whole wardrobe of clothing.  They spend time \"entering a dark, carnal place\" (his 'Red Room of Pain') and discuss the contract early the next morning.  This, however, leads to a rough argument since she compares his not wanting to be touched to her fear of punishment to put things into perspective.  He freaks out and reveals that what she said in her sleep was that she loves him, and she was afraid he would leave her.\rTo compromise, Ana decides to seek out the roughest punishment he can give her, but when she experiences how dark it can get, she finds herself furious and decides to flee.  They talk and discuss what's happening, and she says she loves him, but she doesn't want to risk anything.  She leaves her laptop, Blackberry, and car keys, and gets a ride home from Christian's servant, and cries in bed. \n"}]}
