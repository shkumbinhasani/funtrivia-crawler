Which is it?", "correct": "The Hanging Gardens of Babylon", "options": ["The Pyramids of Giza", "The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus", "The Colossus of Rhodes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hanging Gardens of Babylon.\n\n\tBuilt in, what was at the time, the largest city in the world, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were allegedly terraced gardens in what would now be Iraq.  They were conceived by Nebuchadnezzar II as a gift for his wife, Queen Amytis.  Interestingly, it's the only one of the Seven Ancient Wonders that was never confirmed; it's possible that the structure was nothing more than a beautiful idea created to help the queen deal with her fondness for beautiful, verdant gardens. \n"}, {"text": "In 1919, twenty-one people working in Boston died during an unexpected flood of what substance?", "correct": "Molasses", "options": ["Glue", "Tea", "Beer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMolasses.\n\n\tKnown as the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, this disaster occurred when a massive storage tank burst, sending a spill of twelve thousand tons of hot, sticky molasses through the North End streets.  The wave was fast enough and high enough to trap twenty-one people and injure nearly six times more.  It took a year to clean the damages; the molasses sank into the subway and stayed sticky through the coming summer. \n"}, {"text": "Which nation's capital shares its name with a famous supermodel, a letter in the NATO phonetic alphabet, and a legume?", "correct": "Peru", "options": ["India", "Belgium", "Canada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeru.\n\n\tThe city of Lima, Peru is one of the largest cities in all of South America and contains more than a third of Peru's citizens.

Not only was England's Queen Victoria Wilhelm's grandmother, but his mother, also named Victoria, was the Queen's eldest child (of nine) and a Queen consort herself (of Prussia).  Wilhelm II was notoriously problematic with foreign affairs, and this extended to his direct relations in England.  He spent the end of his life, following WWI, in exile and died in 1941. \n"}, {"text": "In a deck of cards, all four kings have beards, but only three of them also have a moustache. Which king does NOT bear a moustache?", "correct": "Hearts", "options": ["Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHearts.\n\n\tThe king, one of the top-ranking cards in the deck, is one of the most-nicknamed.  The red kings, for instance, are referred to as the Suicide Kings as they're typically depicted with weapons turned towards them.  The kings, as they are today, were based on 15th century French kings and, as such, the King of Hearts, meant to represent King Charles, is the only one who doesn't have a moustache. It's not because Charles never had a moustache (he likely did!).  Though many cite that the moustache went away for symbolic reasons, it's equally possible it was removed over time due to printing errors. \n"}, {"text": "What is the four-letter 'I' word is the name of a Greek goddess, a part of the eye, and a type of flower?", "correct": "Iris", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nIris.\n\n\tThe iris is the coloured part of the eye containing the pupil and surrounded by the sclera.

It makes sense since the word is used to relate to varied colours in most of its applications. \n"}, {"text": "What sculptor created \"The Thinker\"?", "correct": "Auguste Rodin", "options": ["Michelangelo", "Marcel Duchamp", "Alexandros of Antioch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAuguste Rodin.\n\n\tSculpted in 1904, \"The Thinker\" was made in bronze and depicts a naked man sitting on a rock.  More than two dozen official versions of the sculpture, cast from the original, can be found around the world.
