There is a white triangle on the left, however.  Inside the white triangle is a red star.\r A scalene triangle has no equal sides, an equilateral triangle has all three equal sides, and a right triangle has a right angle in it.  It is interesting to note that a right triangle can also be both a scalene or an isosceles triangle, but the triangle on the Djibouti flag is NOT a right triangle. \n"}, {"text": "The star on the Djibouti flag represents the five locations in which Somalis live.

It is 508 feet below sea level.  Why is it so low?", "correct": "Because it was created by a crater", "options": ["Because it is a cave accessible only from a collapsed mine shaft", "Because it isn't really a lake", "Because it's a giant sinkhole"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause it was created by a crater.\n\n\tLac Assal is so low because it was created by a crater.  Lakes such as these are known as \"crater lakes\", such as Crater Lake in the United States.  Lac Assal isn't too far off the coast of Djibouti, but because it is a crater lake, it is quite a large depression in the surface of the land.

However, the name of the plant sounds like it belongs exclusively in another country on the Arabian peninsula.  It is also called Miraa.  What is the plant?", "correct": "Qat", "options": ["UAE", "Bah", "Yem"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQat.\n\n\tQat (or Khat, or Gat) is a flowering plant found in East Africa as well as the Arabian peninsula.
