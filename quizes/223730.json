{"id": "223730", "name": "Nitrogen Multiple Choice Quiz | Chemistry | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Chemistry", "Specific Elements"], "questions": [{"text": "The name nitrogen (from Greek) means:", "correct": "native soda forming", "options": ["salt forming", "water forming", "sugar forming"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnative soda forming.\n\n\tGr. Nitron, native soda; and genes, forming \n"}, {"text": "Nitrogen (as N2) is the second most plentiful element by volume in the Earth's atmosphere.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIt is actually the most plentiful, at 78.1% by volume.  Oxygen (O2) is second at 21%. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following was NOT a name once given to nitrogen?", "correct": "deuterium", "options": ["burnt air", "azote", "noxious air"], "explanation": "\n\n\ndeuterium.\n\n\tDeuterium is actually hydrogen-2 -- hydrogen with a neutron in the nucleus.  Burnt air came from the fact that pure nitrogen won't support combustion.  Noxious air was the name given to the gas by Daniel Rutherford, credited with discovering nitrogen in 1772.  The French chemist Antoine Lavoisier named nitrogen azote, meaning without life. \n"}, {"text": "Nitrogen is part of the carbon-14 radioactive dating method in what way?", "correct": "Carbon-14 is formed from nitrogen-14", "options": ["Nitrogen turns carbon-14 back into carbon-12", "Nitrogen is used to extract carbon-14 from a test sample", "The ratio of carbon-14 to nitrogen is what determines a test sample's age"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarbon-14 is formed from nitrogen-14.\n\n\tWhen an energetic neutron hits a nitrogen-14 atom's nucleus, it stays and knocks a proton out of the nucleus.  This produces a carbon-14 atom and a hydrogen-1 atom (protium), the former being radioactive with a half-life of 5730 years.  This process in on-going, so that there's a constant percentage of carbon-14 in the environment, including living organisms. But once an organism dies, the carbon-14 in its body is not replenished.  After 5730 years, about half of the carbon-14 in the dead organism has beta-decayed back into nitrogen-14; after 11460 years, 3/4 is decayed.  Every 5730 years, 50% of the remaining carbon-14 will have decayed. By measuring how much is left, scientists can determine the age of organic materials up to about 60,000 years. \n"}, {"text": "Although nitrogen is relatively inert, bacteria in the soil _____ the nitrogen into a usable form for plants.", "correct": "fix", "options": ["eche", "nock", "hist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfix.\n\n\tAnimals then eat the plants, hence incorporating the nitrogen (mainly as proteins).  The nitrogen cycle is then complete when the animals excrete nitrogen compounds and other bacteria act on them and release nitrogen gas back into the atmosphere. \n"}, {"text": "Nitrogen is classified into this group of elements:", "correct": "non-metals", "options": ["noble gases", "halogens", "transition metals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnon-metals.\n\n\tNon-metals are the elements in groups 14-16 of the periodic table. Non-metals are not able to conduct electricity or heat very well. Non-metallic elements are very brittle as solids, and cannot be rolled into wires or pounded into sheets. They exist in two of the three states of matter at room temperature: gases and solids. The non-metals have no metallic luster, and do not reflect light. They have oxidation numbers of \u00b14, -3, and -2. \n"}, {"text": "Urea (NH2CONH2), one of the most utilized nitrogen compounds, is used in each of the following EXCEPT:", "correct": "gas lasers", "options": ["plastics", "fertilizers", "livestock feed supplements"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngas lasers.\n\n\tAmmonia is also used in the production of urea, NH2CONH2, which is used as a fertilizer, used in the plastic industry, and used in the livestock industry as a feed supplement. Ammonia is often the starting compound for many other nitrogen compounds. \n"}, {"text": "The nitrates of sodium (NaNO3) and potassium (KNO3) are collectively called:", "correct": "saltpeters", "options": ["hydrates", "amalgams", "alloys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsaltpeters.\n\n\tIn certain dry areas of the world these saltpeters are found in quantity and are used as fertilizers.  BTW, alloys are mixtures of metals, amalgams are mercury alloys, and hydrates are solid compounds combined with a specific ratio of water molecules. \n"}, {"text": "Nitrogen is an essential element in this class of food compounds:", "correct": "proteins", "options": ["carbohydrates", "alcohols", "fats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nproteins.\n\n\tProteins are a group of organic macromolecules that contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and usually sulfur and are composed of one or more chains of amino acids.  Alcohols are any of a series of hydroxyl compounds, including ethanol and methanol.  Fats are he ester of glycerol and one, two, or three fatty acids.  Carbohydrates are organic compounds that only contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the ratio 1:2:1. \n"}, {"text": "The planet Mars has a greater amount of nitrogen in its atmosphere than Earth does.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThere's only 2.6% nitrogen in Mars's air, compared to Earth's 78.1%.  This is overlooked in the Tim Burton film \"Mars Attacks!\".  The Martians in this film wear helmets in our air or chew \"nitrogen gum\".  But since Earth has an abundance of nitrogen, these wouldn't be necessary.  (But what the heck, it's just a silly movie.) \n"}]}
