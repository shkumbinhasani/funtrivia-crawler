{"id": "396860", "name": "The Avengers Multiple Choice Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", " The Avengers"], "questions": [{"text": "With what is Loki able to control minds?", "correct": "Sceptre", "options": ["A song", "Gaze", "Magic dust"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSceptre.\n\n\tThe Joint Dark Energy Division of S.H.I.E.L.D. goes into full lockdown as Nick Fury and Maria Hill arrive.  Phil Coulson states that they don't know how bad the problem is, but Dr. Selvig recognized that an event had occurred; the Tesseract had seemingly turned itself on.  Nick Fury orders a full evacuation; Selvig says they're a long way from controlling it; Clint, watching from above, says no one could've triggered it from what he's seen. And that's when the Tesseract creates a wormhole, allowing Loki to force his way through to the other side.  Seemingly invulnerable to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s weapons, Loki takes control, using his sceptre to control Hawkeye and Selvig. Fury stores the Tesseract away while he can, but Clint shoots him in the chest, acting before the wormhole can cave the facility in.  Fury, who survives the shot, communicates with Maria and she quickly gives chase.  All of these players escape the facility as it crumbles into the Earth, but Loki gets away with the Tesseract.  Fury calls in a Level 7; they're at war. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Natasha Romanoff locate Dr. Bruce Banner?", "correct": "India", "options": ["Brazil", "Australia", "Canada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndia.\n\n\tIn a dilapidated warehouse in Russia, Natasha Romanoff, codename Black Widow, is interrogated and beaten for information.  Before this can progress to outright torture, a call is received and Coulson is on the other line.  Romanoff beats her way out easily, clearly in control of the situation.  She's tasked, first, with going to Calcutta, India to pick someone up.\rThat someone turns out to be Dr. Bruce Banner, who's in the city helping who he can in secret.    S.H.I.E.L.D., as it turned out, never stopped tracking him, and it's time for him to help.  She shows him the Tesseract and asks him to find it; it has a gamma signature that they can't trace, but that he's done research on.  He goes willingly.\rFury, elsewhere, makes the decision to ask that they operate the 'Avengers Initiative' because a response team is required.  War needs soldiers, he reasons.  And that's why he revisits Captain America, who S.H.I.E.L.D. located and unthawed from the Arctic ice.  He agrees to help because he knows what the Tesseract is capable of.  Coulson takes the liberty of cleaning up Rogers' uniform.\rIn the river next to Manhattan, Tony finishes making Stark Tower completely self-sustaining and brushes off Coulson's repeated calls.  It doesn't matter though; Coulson is already in Stark Tower and has information about the Tesseract.  Stark argues that he was kicked out of the Avengers because of his tendencies, but once the information is opened up, Stark has no choice but to look into it. \n"}, {"text": "What element does Dr. Selvig need to work on the Tesseract?", "correct": "Iridium", "options": ["Thorium", "Krypton", "Molybdenum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIridium.\n\n\tLoki watches over the work being done by Selvig, but also ends up speaking to the leader of the Chitauri, considering the propositions put upon him.  Loki wishes for a war, but the Chitauri have yet to collect the Tesseract from him.  He reassures that it will yet happen.  Selvig and Barton, meanwhile, discuss the need for Iridium required to stabilize the Tesseract though it's hard to get a hold of.  Hawkeye is up for the task though.\rCap and Banner are both brought to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s carrier and introduced to one another before it's revealed that they're actually on a massive, cloaking airship.  In the control room they're briefed on where they are and Banner gives instruction to set up mass spectrometers around the world.  Ultimately, they find a match for Loki on cameras in Stuttgart, Germany.  It's where the Iridium is.  Rogers springs into action. \n"}, {"text": "Which two of the Avengers face off against one another in the forest until they're convinced to stop?", "correct": "Iron Man and Thor", "options": ["Iron Man and Captain America", "Captain America and The Incredible Hulk", "Thor and The Incredible Hulk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIron Man and Thor.\n\n\tLoki is able to get Hawkeye the retinal scan he needs to access the Iridium in Stuttgart and then he makes himself known, transforming into his proper form to begin terrorizing the people of the city, forcing them to kneel before him.  Captain America arrives just in time and Romanoff swoops in from above to support, but before long, they're joined by Tony Stark, who flies in to force Loki to surrender. They are all able to apprehend the willing Loki and start the flight back to the carrier, but they end up flying through an abrupt lightning storm triggered by Thor who, believing Loki to be imprisoned against his will, absconds with him to convince him to return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers both leap from their plane to chase after the brothers and, after the two of them discuss their issues and Thor's need to protect Earth, they head with the others back to the S.H.I.E.L.D. carrier anyways (but only after a bit of a scuffle), all of them knowing that they still need to obtain the Tesseract. \n"}, {"text": "Romanoff forces Loki to reveal that he plans to use which of the Avengers to bring down S.H.I.E.L.D.?", "correct": "The Incredible Hulk", "options": ["Iron Man", "Captain America", "Thor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Incredible Hulk.\n\n\tLoki is sealed away in a prison cell designed to hold the Hulk and threatened by Nick Fury while the others watch on from behind the camera feeds.  Loki muses on power, but he's ultimately left alone while the others discuss what to do.  Banner believes that Loki wishes to create a new doorway, and Stark agrees with this; the iridium is needed to stabilize a portal unlike what happened at S.H.I.E.L.D.  Dr. Selvig, of course, is there to facilitate that.\rBanner and Stark work together to investigate Loki's staff which, at the same time, is powered by the the Tesseract.  They don't know, however, how it can control minds.  What they do know is that Stark Tower is partly tied into things; because it runs independently off an ARC reactor it may factor in.  Alone, Stark tries to convince Banner that maybe his power is a privilege instead of a curse.\rThor looks into Jane Foster's whereabouts, finding that she's been moved somewhere safe.  S.H.I.E.L.D., as Coulson notes, has been made well aware of Asgard through Dr. Selvig.  Thor regrets that he has to step in to prevent a war.  Since Loki seeks vengeance he's not sure what he can do.\rRomanoff ends up the only person to sneak in to speak to Loki.  She asks about Barton, her friend, and Loki really only admits that he wants to be on the ship.  He doesn't say anything about being able to concede to her demands, but he leans in to shake her, all while the helicarrier takes on a virus.  It turns out that Romaoff was lying about her concern the whole time; as the ship is infiltrated, she catches Loki out, deducing that he plans to use the Hulk against S.H.I.E.L.D., and she sends that word along. \n"}, {"text": "The Avengers discover that S.H.I.E.L.D. wished to obtain the Tesseract for which of these?", "correct": "Development of weapons", "options": ["Currency with alien races", "Unlimited power", "Wormhole technology"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDevelopment of weapons.\n\n\tThings go from concerning to worse when Banner, Stark, and Rogers all discover that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to use the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction on account of Thor's recent visit from Earth which levelled a small town.  This puts everyone at odds, especially with Romanoff concerned about Banner's presence.  None of them notice as Barton's men track them through Loki's sceptre...and as Barton fires a special arrow at the carrier and blasts off one of the ship's engines.\rThe infiltration proves to be a big issue.  After the ship explodes, Romanoff is trapped under a large pipe and Banner begins to transform.  She barely manages to escape after Bruce takes on his Hulk form.  From his cell, Loki hears the roars.  Romanoff is only saved when Thor leaps in to subdue Banner. \n"}, {"text": "Who's launched out of the Helicarrier in the detention cell?", "correct": "Thor", "options": ["The Incredible Hulk", "Nick Fury", "Loki"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThor.\n\n\tIn the control room, Nick Fury and Maria Hill need to arm themselves to stop the incoming forces.  Since Hulk threatens their position, Maria calls in a fighter plane to distract Banner.  It works; Hulk leaps out of the carrier and goes down with the plane, bringing it down to Earth.\rOutside, Cap and Stark work together to try and hold the ship together, dislodging debris and sealing off the blast.  It doesn't matter too much though; Hawkeye manages to shut down the power in one of the engines before heading down to Loki's cell.  Romanov, intercepting the transmission, heads down alone to stop him and the two fight hand-to-hand on the way.\rThor, meanwhile, makes it to the holding cell first only to get trapped inside himself while Loki escapes.  It's Coulson who comes in to stop him, wielding a gun made with destroyer technology.  Loki subdues him quickly enough, launching Thor and the detention cell out of the carrier and down to land.  He survives by blasting through the window with Mjolnir.  Coulson, severely injured, manages to blast Loki when the Asgardian takes his guard down.\rRomanoff manages to bring down Barton by knocking him out.\rOutside, Cap and Stark manage to take care of the third engine.\rLoki barely escapes.\rCoulson succumbs to his wounds. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Loki plan to open the wormhole?", "correct": "New York City", "options": ["New Mexico", "Los Angeles", "Norway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York City.\n\n\tAfter Coulson's death, Nick Fury brings Stark and Rogers back to the control room to discuss their next moves.  With no known whereabouts for Banner and Thor, they have no choice but to proceed, even though they're down, because they've put all of their stakes into the Avengers Initiative.\rHitting Barton really hard in the head seems to have done wonders, and Romanoff says he doesn't need to apologize because it was Loki's doing from the very beginning.  Barton says that Loki plans to do something within the day.\rTony theorizes that Loki wants to do something excessive and public and, after thinking on it, he realizes that there's only one place Loki could go.  Fury watches as Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye leave with one of the jets and Iron Man flies off.  They find Dr. Selvig on the roof of Stark Tower, and it's already too late. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the last of the Avengers to join the climactic battle?", "correct": "The Incredible Hulk", "options": ["Thor", "Captain America", "Iron Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Incredible Hulk.\n\n\tStark tries to blast the Tesseract machine on the roof, but it's indestructible since it's loaded with energy.  Instead of continuing with this, Stark heads into his office and offers Loki a drink, threatening him while donning some items and making a drink.  Loki doesn't care; the Chitauri are already on their way.  Loki moves in to use his sceptre to control Stark's mind, but ends up hitting his ARC reactor.  Realizing it won't work, he instead launches Tony out the window, prompting him to don a fresh version of his suit.  That's when the wormhole blasts open, sending the Chitauri army down from the sky while the public watches from below.  Loki takes his place above the city watching as his plan comes to pass just as Thor arrives to stop his brother, and so they clash.  Cap and the others also come in, flying over to assist and getting blasted out of the sky and crash landing in a plaza near Grand Central.  That's when the Chitauri fleet flies in, launching its forces.\rLoki warns Thor that it's too late to stop the forces before escaping Stark Tower on the back of a Chitauri craft, heading on a rampage.  Cap, out at street level, takes control of the evacuation process while the NYPD lock down a perimeter.  No one is able to stop Banner from entering though.  When he shows up, he transforms once again into the Hulk, and brings down the Chitauri carrier, assembling the Avengers once and for all. \n"}, {"text": "With what are the Avengers able to stop the Chitauri forces?", "correct": "A nuke", "options": ["Loki's magic", "The Tesseract", "Vibranium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA nuke.\n\n\tNothing stops the Chitauri though; Loki sends in more forces and Cap takes control of the strategy, splitting the team to do what they do best.  Thor takes to the Empire State Building and calls upon the power of lightning to blast forces emerging from the wormhole while the Hulk smashes, as he does.  The containment is effective, but it doesn't stop the military from sending out nuclear missiles against Fury's advice.\rFrom the ground, Romanoff suggests that they close the wormhole somehow.  Grabbing a Chitauri vehicle, she flies to the top of Stark Tower solo to find Dr. Selvig, now free from Loki's control by an earlier blast, at the top.  The Hulk takes care of Loki in Stark's penthouse while Selvig and Romanoff try to deal with the Tesseract.  They need the sceptre to do that though, and with Loki distracted, they can do it.\rBut there's a problem.  Fury is superseded and the nuclear missile is launched directly at Manhattan.  He calls out to Stark to intercept and he flies out to stop it before it can wipe out New York City.  Romanoff, on the roof of Stark Tower, says she can close the wormhole, but Stark stops her for a minute, aiming to toss the nuke into it to protect the city.  It takes all of the remaining power in his suit to thrust through the wormhole, clearly a one-way trip, but he does it before disengaging and falling back, letting the Chitauri ship get destroyed and bringing down all of the forces in New York.  He plummets back through the wormhole just as Romanoff seals it, but he's powerless to stop from falling.  It's the Hulk who nabs him from the sky at the last second.\rThe Avengers save the day, beating Loki and saving the world.  Stark suggests they celebrate with some shawarma, but there are still some loose ends to take care of.\rThe Avengers become famous for what they've done.  Nick Fury believes they deserve a leave of absence.  Thor returns to Asgard with Loki and the Tesseract in tow as they both belong to the Gods.  Banner departs with Stark, heading back to the tower.  Hawkeye and Black Widow ride off together while Cap rides a bike his separate way.  If another situation arises, Fury is confident they will come back together. \n"}]}
