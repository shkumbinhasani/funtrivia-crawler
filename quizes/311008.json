{"id": "311008", "name": "\"Diablo II\" - Act I Quiz | Diablo Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games D-F", "Diablo Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Who gives you the first quest of the game taking you to the Den of Evil?", "correct": "Akara", "options": ["Charsi", "Gheed", "Kashya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAkara.\n\n\tFound in the northeast portion of the Rogue Encampment, Akara will also sell magic items such as staves, wands, and scepters.  Her presence in the Encampment is quite noticeable; she's responsible for fueling three of the six quests of the act.\rThe Den of Evil, found in the nearby Blood Moor, is the first dungeon of the game.  With only one level, it's a beginner's area.  It's home to a bunch of Fallen, Shamans, Gargantuans, and Zombies as well as the unique Corpsefire (who typically has the Spectral Hit attribute).  As you progress through the quest and finish up in the Den, the quest log will note how many enemies you have left (decreasing from 5 onwards).  After beating the quest, Akara will reward you with a skill point. \n"}, {"text": "Outside the Rogue Encampment, where is the first waypoint that you can find?", "correct": "Cold Plains", "options": ["The Cave", "Blood Moor", "Stony Field"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCold Plains.\n\n\tIf you cross Blood Moor entirely, the Cold Plains will await on the other side.  As soon as you walk down the path, the Cold Plains waypoint will be in clear sight near the entrance- this is one of the few instances where the waypoint never has a random location on the expanse of the map.\rCold Plains is home to the unique monster Bishibosh, a Carver Shaman, and Dark Spearwomen and Hunters, characters new to the game up to this point.  The Cold Plains are also home to a dungeon known as The Cave.  This cave contains the unique monster, Coldcrow.\rCold Plains also connects to Stony Field and Burial Grounds, both of which need to be reached to complete quests #2 and up. \n"}, {"text": "In the second quest of Act 1, 'Sisters' Burial Grounds', who must be defeated?", "correct": "Blood Raven", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlood Raven.\n\n\tYou are able to receive this quest from Kashya in the Rogue Encampment after completing the Den of Evil.  To reach the Burial Grouns, you will need to follow one fork of the path found in Cold Plains (the other will go to Stony Field).  The Burial Grounds are home to a rather large group of skeletons and Blood Raven herself.  This bow-equipped unique will use her hoards of undead minions to try and do some damage, but really the only thing to worry about is her speed.\rAfter the completion of this quest, Kashya will reward you with an archer mercenary who can use the powers of fire, ice, and electricity to shoot foes.  Once this mercenary dies, you can revisit Kashya to revive them or hire on a new mercenary entirely.  The first three acts allow you to purchase different types of mercenaries. \n"}, {"text": "One of the dungeons found in the Burial Grounds is The Crypt.  What is the name of the other?", "correct": "The Mausoleum", "options": ["The Mortuary", "The Pyre", "The Tower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mausoleum.\n\n\tBoth The Crypt and The Mausoleum can be found in opposite ends of the cemetery in the Burial Grounds and both are simple, single-floored dungeons which contain gold chests and undead enemies.  While The Crypt doesn't have a static boss, The Mausoleum will almost always contain Bonebreaker, an undead unique Skeleton, who guards the final chest.  Similarly to The Cave, it is not imperative to the complete story of the game to make a visit to both of these areas. \n"}, {"text": "The third quest of the game requires that players find the Scroll of Inifuss.  Where is this?", "correct": "Dark Woods", "options": ["Stony Field", "Black Marsh", "Cold Plains"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDark Woods.\n\n\tIn order to reach the Dark Woods, you need to travel from the Cold Plains, through Stony Field, and into a multilevel Underground Passage.  Once in the Dark Woods, rather large groups of Fallen and Fallen Shaman will have set up camp, and you'll need to wind your way through the forest to find the Tree of Inifuss guarded by the rather large Brute, Treehead Woodfist, who will typically be Extra Strong and Extra Fast. Once the Scroll of Inifuss is obtained, you can bring it straight back to Akara in order to determine how to find the captured Deckard Cain, the focal point for the third quest of the game. \n"}, {"text": "In which town can you rescue Deckard Cain?", "correct": "Tristram", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTristram.\n\n\tAfter taking the Scroll of Inifuss to Akara, you can make your way back to Stony Field to find the five circular Cairn Stones.  Touching these in the order specified on the scroll will enable you to enter a portal to the town of Tristram, now under siege by armies of undead creatures and Carvers.  Getting in might be tricky for lower-leveled characters as the electrically-enchanted Carver unique, Rakanishu, will guard the path.\rIn Tristram, you can defeat the unique boss, Griswold, save Deckard Cain from his cage, clear out any enemies, and find the obscure item, Wirt's Leg.  This item will come in handy if you ever want to attempt the well-known Cow Level after completing your difficulty of the game.\rBringing Cain back to the Rogue Encampment means that you can identify items through him for free.  As well, Akara will reward you with a ring. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the final boss found within the Forgotten Tower?", "correct": "The Countess", "options": ["Wendigo", "None of these", "Sin Skin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Countess.\n\n\tThe fourth quest of Act I, known as 'The Forgotten Tower', first requires that you find a Moldy Tome in Stony Field which will tell of the tower's location and existence in the Black Marsh, an area adjacent to Dark Woods.  This five floor dungeon will dig deeper and deeper into the ground to enable you to find the boss of the quest, The Countess, a Hunter-type enemy with a Fire Enchantment.  She is also randomly able to drop the Key of Terror.\rThe quest is not imperative; the only reward garnered from it is the drops that The Countess creates when killed.  Otherwise, it is a completely optional dungeon with no resulting rewards (ie. Rings, Skill Points, etc.).  For quicker access, a waypoint can be found randomly in the Black Marsh. \n"}, {"text": "Once you obtain the Horadric Malus for quest #5, who do you give it to?", "correct": "Charsi", "options": ["Deckard Cain", "Akara", "Warriv"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharsi.\n\n\tCharsi, the Rogue Encampment's principle trader/armorer will give you the fifth quest of the Act, known as 'Tools of the Trade', when you reach the Monastery at the far end of Tamoe Highlands.  After navigating through the Outer Cloister you'll come across The Barracks, an area swarming with undead Skeleton Mages, Hunter-class creatures, and more. At one end of this, you'll make your way to Jail, Level 1, beneath the Monastery, but in the other direction you'll eventually come across The Smith, a unique character whose room contains the important Horadric Malus.  Once this item is taken back to Charsi, you'll have the ability to imbue any normal item with magic properties. You must do this in order to complete the quest, but as a warning, it can only be used once in the entire game/difficulty, so it should be used wisely. \n"}, {"text": "Where can you not find a waypoint in Act 1?", "correct": "Tamoe Highlands", "options": ["Inner Cloister", "Jail, Level 1", "Catacombs, Level 2"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTamoe Highlands.\n\n\tTamoe Highlands is located between two waypoint areas, Black Marsh and the Outer Cloister, and because Tamoe Highlands and its dungeon, The Pit, have no impact on the quest-driven portions of the game, the necessity to have a waypoint available is lost.  Jail, Level 1 appears after The Barracks and will continue deeper into the Monastery to the Inner Cloister, a small area which will appear as a gateway into the final segments of the Act.  Following this, players will continue to travel deeper into the Monastery, eventually making their way to the Catacombs.  The final waypoint of the Act will be on the second level of the Catacombs.\rIn total, Act 1 has a total of nine waypoints (including the Rogue Encampment). \n"}, {"text": "Who is the final boss of Act 1?", "correct": "Andariel", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndariel.\n\n\tThe sixth and final quest of Act 1, 'Sisters to the Slaughter', will be available to you upon finishing the fifth quest or reaching Catacombs, Level 3, and it will result in your leaving the Act.  Andariel, the final boss, will be waiting in Catacombs, Level 4, and her defeat is mandatory.  Alongside her, you'll often find Dark Ones and undead creatures.  The real challenge when you open the door to Andariel's Throne Room is avoiding her poison breath and ensuring that you deal the final blow on her.  Being the final boss of the Act, 'Andy' (as she affectionately called by online players) will be apt to dropping much rarer items than others.\rAfter defeating Andariel, players can finish their Act 1 experience by talking to Warriv, boarding the caravan, and heading east to Lut Gholein. \n"}]}
