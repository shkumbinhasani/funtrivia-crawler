Eve's mother told Eve to be home by 10 pm. Adam wants to hang out later at the new arcade. Eve wants Adam to like her so she has no problem breaking a Commandment. Which of the following things might she do to break a Commandment?", "correct": "Ignored her mother and stayed out with Adam.", "options": ["Tell Adam she had to be home at 10 pm.", "Drink alcohol.", "Left Adam to get home when she was supposed to."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIgnored her mother and stayed out with Adam.\n\n\tThe Commandments tell readers to honor their mother and father. This means to obey them, and treat them with respect. (Exodus 20:12) \n"}, {"text": "After you have a chat with Adam, the two run off again. Just as you sit down with your glass of iced tea, here comes Eve again. \"Adam is being bad! I just saw him make a golden calf and bow down to it.\" How has Adam broken a Commandment this time?", "correct": "By worshiping idols", "options": ["By talking to cows", "By stealing", "By committing adultery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy worshiping idols.\n\n\tWorshiping idols can be interpreted as happening when anything that is not God takes a higher place than God in someone's life. It could be models, cars, money, movie stars, sports, etc (Exodus 20:4). In this case, Adam has made an idol of a calf and is literally worshiping it. \n"}, {"text": "Adam and Eve are having marital problems. It turns out that for the last few months Adam has been having an affair with his secretary. How is he breaking a Commandment?", "correct": "Adultery", "options": ["Murder", "Getting jealous", "Having idols"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdultery.\n\n\tAdultery is forbidden in Exodus 20:14. Elsewhere in the Bible, it says that you do not even have to go through with the sexual act to be committing adultery. Jesus says in Matthew 5:28, \"But I say to you, That whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" \n"}, {"text": "Sunday rolls around (for some congregations it could be Saturday) and everyone is heading to church.

How did they break a Commandment?", "correct": "They did not keep the Sabbath Day holy.", "options": ["They ate hamburgers.", "They killed someone.", "They lied."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey did not keep the Sabbath Day holy.\n\n\tThe Bible says in Genesis 2:3 that God finished his work and rested on the seventh day. He then commands believers in Exodus to \"Remember the Sabbath and keep it Holy\" (Exodus 20:8). Some people observe the Sabbath on Saturday and for some it is on Sunday. \n"}, {"text": "Once again you talk to Adam and the two run off again. You see they are now playing a game of Monopoly. You go back to watching your TV show and drinking your iced tea. Suddenly you hear this huge fight break out and Adam and Eve are screaming at each other. Then you hear Eve say some words about God that she should not say when angry. How did she just break a Commandment?", "correct": "Taking the Lord's name in vain", "options": ["Adultery", "Stealing", "Lying"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTaking the Lord's name in vain.\n\n\tTo \"take the Lord's name in vain\" means to use God's name when angry or as a filler.

The Bible says there is only one God. \n"}, {"text": "Adam wants to fix things with Eve so he decides to get her a nice diamond  bracelet. Adam goes to the store and sees the perfect bracelet. He looks at the price: $4000. Adam doesn't have that much money and Eve would love that bracelet, so he nonchalantly walks over and sticks it in his pocket. He then walks out of the store. Right as he does, the store security guards grab him. He has been caught on camera breaking another Commandment. How?", "correct": "Stealing", "options": ["Lying", "Not keeping the Sabbath Holy", "Killing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStealing.\n\n\tWhether the theft is of a five-cent piece of candy or a $4000 bracelet, it is stealing and it is forbidden in the Bible. (Exodus 20:15) \n"}, {"text": "Eve spends most of her time at work telling people about her neighbor Miss Jones. She tells them all that Miss Jones beats her children.

Adam sees that Mr. Jones has a brand new Porsche in his driveway. Eve sees that Mrs. Jones has a brand-new, state-of-the-art in-ground swimming pool. Adam and Eve are quite bitter now because they are so jealous of their neighbors. What is another word referring to the act of being jealous, used in many translations of the Commandments?", "correct": "Covet", "options": ["Pride", "Lasciviousness", "Gluttony"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCovet.\n\n\tThe 10th Commandment says \"thou shalt not covet.\" This means people should be content with what they have rather than being jealous that they do not have what the other person has. To covet something is to be jealous of its owner and to want it for oneself. (Exodus 20:17) \n"}]}
