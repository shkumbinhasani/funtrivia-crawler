Under the scientific method, if something is not testable, it is not science. Intelligent design is not testable, therefore it cannot be science. \n"}, {"text": "Exequiel Ezcurra, director of scientific research for the \nSan Diego Natural History Museum, stated:\n\"[Intelligent design] violates one of the most basic principles of scientific philosophy, the principle of ... \n", "correct": "parsimony.", "options": ["the scientific method.", "rational thought.", "observation."], "explanation": "\n\n\nparsimony.\n\n\tAccording to Ezcurra, [parsimony] \"states that natural effects should be explained through natural causes and that unnecessary hypotheses should be discarded when trying to understand the way the natural world works.\" Intelligent design adds unnecessary complexity and hypotheses to an explanation of how the world came to be. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Evan Snyder,neurologist and director of the Stem Cells and Regeneration Program at The Burnham Institute, stated:\n\"If proponents of intelligent design (ID) wish their hypothesis to be treated as a science, then they must...\"\n", "correct": "be prepared to generate experiments that will prove ID incorrect and teach their students how to disprove ID.", "options": ["abandon religion.", "show that they believe in science.", "publish more articles in scientific journals."], "explanation": "\n\n\nbe prepared to generate experiments that will prove ID incorrect and teach their students how to disprove ID.\n\n\tIn order to be a true theory, a scientific theory must be falsifiable- that is, experiments that could disprove the theory must be conceivable. No such experiments have been proposed by the architects of intelligent design theory. \n"}, {"text": "Jeffrey Bada, a marine chemist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, stated:\n\"Intelligent design claims that the processes involved are scientifically unknowable and thus must be explained by a supernatural or extraterrestrial creator. \n\nThis is akin to the widely held 19th century theory of panspermia that life on Earth began from a spore or seed from outer space. Scientific research subsequently demonstrated that panspermia was not a testable and verifiable scientific theory...\"", "correct": "and the same applies to intelligent design today.", "options": ["but some scientists still believe in it.", " and the same applies to intelligent design today.", "but Intelligent Design proponents believe in it.", "but that was no reason to give it up."], "explanation": "\n\n\nand the same applies to intelligent design today.\n\n\tAgain, intelligent design fails the test of the principle of falsifiability. \n"}, {"text": "Moselio Schaechter, adjunct professor of biology at San Diego State University, when asked about the evolution of complexity, stated:\n\"How would you build a highly complex vehicle that can be driven, flown and navigated underwater? Would you start from scratch with some steel ingots...\"", "correct": "or would you use parts from existing cars, planes and submarines?", "options": ["and hope you'd somehow be able to build it?", "or would you ask a Creator to build it for you?", "or would you just say that it could not possibly be built?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nor would you use parts from existing cars, planes and submarines?.\n\n\tOver and over again, evolutionary examples have shown a remarkable ability to \"make do\" and use available features and mechanisms as the platform for further evolution. For some examples, see my quiz \"Evidence for Evolution- Unintelligent Design.\" \n"}, {"text": "J. David Archibald, professor of biology at San Diego State University, stated:\n\"The cry that teaching intelligent design in the science classroom should be permitted because of intellectual freedom is a red herring. We don't teach alchemy, astrology and witchcraft in the science classroom...\"", "correct": "because like intelligent design, they are not science.", "options": ["because they are clearly false.", "but we will need to if we allow the teaching of intelligent design.", "but they are taught in some churches."], "explanation": "\n\n\nbecause like intelligent design, they are not science.\n\n\tThe point of this is that we long ago decided to teach one thing in science classrooms- science. No matter what intellectual freedoms we support, intelligent design is not science, and does not belong in the classroom. It isn't a matter of freedom, it's a matter of appropriateness. \n"}, {"text": "Michael Simpson, professor of biology at San Diego State University, stated:\n\"I think it is possible to be both spiritual and a critical thinker: To use one's mind (the scientific method and common sense) in evaluating specific beliefs or claims or ideas, and yet...\"", "correct": "to also seek that question of existence and continually embrace the wonder and awesome mystery of this world.", "options": ["most religious people do not do so.", "to believe in an inerrant Bible.", "creationists claim that this cannot be done."], "explanation": "\n\n\nto also seek that question of existence and continually embrace the wonder and awesome mystery of this world.\n\n\tIt is a common misconception that spiritual belief and evolutionary thought are antithetical. As this quote shows, they are certainly not mutually exclusive. \n"}, {"text": "Phil Unitt, curator of ornithology for the San Diego Museum of Natural History, stated:\n\"Science is a mental activity consisting of observation and experimentation, synthesized by interpretation. The interpretation consists of developing a story that is consistent with the results of observation and experimentation. The key concept that distinguishes science from nonscience is that if new observations and experiments contradict the story...\"", "correct": "the story must be changed to accommodate them", "options": ["scientists do not know what to believe.", "the story must be thrown out.", "the new observations must be disbelieved."], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe story must be changed to accommodate them.\n\n\tOne of the major differences between true science and intelligent design is that scientific explanations are always changing , as we learn more about the world around us and must change our theories to accommodate new facts. ID lacks any such process of change (especially since it also lacks any type of research) and thus is inflexible. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Ajit P. Varki, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego, stated:\n\"Debating intelligent design would be like...\"", "correct": "debating someone who still insists that the Earth is flat", "options": ["debating the existence of the moon.", "debating the theory of relativity.", "debating the theory of gravity."], "explanation": "\n\n\ndebating someone who still insists that the Earth is flat.\n\n\tVarki is simply stating that intelligent design isn't worth debating, to him, as it is so obviously false. \n"}, {"text": "Tom Demere, a paleontologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum, stated:\n\"I have to admit that it is not that clear to me just what constitutes intelligent design, since I could find...\"", "correct": "no research papers published in peer-reviewed scientific publications on the subject", "options": ["no information on the subject at all.", "articles on it in every major science magazine.", "so many scientists who believed in it."], "explanation": "\n\n\nno research papers published in peer-reviewed scientific publications on the subject.\n\n\tTrue scientists submit all of their work for peer review. If it hasn't been published, scrutinized and criticized, and if the scientists involved have been unable to respond to or refute the criticisms, then it isn't science. \n"}]}
