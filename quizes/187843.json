What was this league called?", "correct": "All-American Girl's Professional Baseball League", "options": ["Professional Women's Baseball Association", "International Ladies Baseball League", "World League of Female Baseball Players"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll-American Girl's Professional Baseball League.\n\n\tIn the film 'A League of Their Own', the Tom Hanks character was loosely based on major league hall-of-famer Jimmie Foxx, who managed the Fort Wayne Daisies.  The Geena Davis character, Dottie Hinson, was modeled after actual player Dottie Kamenshek (who was touted as a men's major league level ball player by several talent scouts).  Much of the situations in the film mirrored what occurred in real life, for example the charm school scene.  The All-American Girl's Professional Baseball League lasted from 1943 to 1954. \n"}, {"text": "An international team golf league was in existence from 1974 to 1978, and featured some of the greatest current talents in the game.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNo team golf league has ever existed (though the non-starting 'National Professional Golf League played one season in 1972 - singles competition only).  However, between the years 1974 and 1978 there did exist a team tennis league called World Team Tennis.  Indeed, some of the big stars of the day did participate, including Jimmy Connors, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert (not Lloyd, yet) and Bjorn Borg.  The league included a total of 19 teams in its short history, which included a number of franchise moves, etc.  The most intriguing team was the 'Soviets', a touring team of players from the Soviet Union.  The following website gives a pictorial view of each team's logo: \r http://www.fortunecity.com/wembley/stamford/576/wtt/ \n"}, {"text": "The American Basketball Association, which existed from 1967 until 1976, was considered the National Basketball Association's minor league.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIndeed, not!  The ABA was a rival league with essentially the same talent level as the NBA.  Players such as Julius Erving, George Gervin, Rick Barry and Moses Malone spent portions of their professional basketball careers playing in the ABA, which allowed for three-point baskets and emplyed red-white-and blue balls. Four ABA teams, the Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, San Antonio Spurs and New York/New Jersey Nets, merged into the NBA when the ABA went defunct in 1976.  The greatest ABA moment came in 1971 when the Utah Stars, led by Zelmo Beatty, Willie Wise and Ron Boone, won the ABA championship. \n"}, {"text": "The American Football Conference in the NFL sprouted from the merger of the NFL with the American Football League in the late 1960s.

When the two leagues finally merged after the 1969 season, the Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers all shifted over to the AFC. \n"}, {"text": "Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation in 2001 had a brilliant idea, create an 'extreme' football league which promotes the violence of the game.  Unfortunately for McMahon, the fans weren't buying it, and the league fell apart after only one season.  A team from which city won the only league championship?", "correct": "Los Angeles", "options": ["San Francisco", "New York", "Chicago"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLos Angeles.\n\n\tIn the only XFL championship game the Los Angeles Xtreme won handily over the San Francisco Demons by a score of 38-6.  The league began with high television ratings, but they quickly fell off as football fans had difficult time swallowing the wrestling style interviews and announcing team, and more importantly, the low quality of play.  The league was also known for its 'extreme' team names (for example, the Demons and the Hitmen).  This reminds me of a top ten list from David Letterman show, the 'Top Ten Rejected XFL Team Names'.  They are as follows (borrowed from the Late Show archive - pay special attention to #2):\r 10. Florida Felons\r9. Dallas Deadbeat Dads\r8. Richmond 'Roid Rage\r7. Las Vegas Lapdancerz\r6.

Though playing in the Spring (and hence gunning for a separate television audience), the league directly challenged the NFL's supremacy by offering large contracts to some very big football names.  Some other USFL names include: Gary Anderson, Bobby Hebert, Kelvin Bryant, Doug Flutie, Anthony Carter and Reggie White.  Donald Trump was a team owner.  Jim Mora, Steve Spurrier and Marv Levy all served as coaches.\rBarry Sanders played his entire career in the NFL with the Detroit Lions. \n"}, {"text": "Rival to the WNBA, the women's professional basketball league which was founded in 1997, was which of the following now defunct leagues?", "correct": "American Basketball League", "options": ["Womens Basketball Association", "Continental Basketball Conference", "Ladies Basketball Federation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican Basketball League.\n\n\tThe ABL lasted from 1996 until 1998, and differed from the WNBA in a myriad of ways.  The ABL used the same-sized balls as the NBA, had a more distant three point line and played during the NBA season.  Players such as Kate Starbird and Teresa Edwards played for ABL teams, but the league lost its challenge for supremacy in the women's basketball world when the NBA essentially endorsed (and financially backed) the WNBA. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most long lasting defunct professional leagues in history was the North American Soccer League, which played its games between 1968 and 1985.

Which former NBA player purchased the entire league in 1999 for 10 million dollars?", "correct": "Isiah Thomas", "options": ["Magic Johnson", "Julius Erving", "Larry Bird"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsiah Thomas.\n\n\tFounded in 1978, the CBA served as a minor league for the NBA, though there were no official links between NBA teams and the CBA franchises.  Some very good NBA players, for example Anthony Mason and Mario Elie, played for fair stretches in the CBA before attaining NBA success.  Isiah Thomas imagined a situation wherein the CBA would officially link itself as a developmental league for the NBA, but the NBA had other ideas, creating a developmental league of its own (and thus putting the CBA out of business).  Thomas was forced to divest himself of the league when he became coach of the Indiana Pacers. \n"}, {"text": "There has never been a professional baseball league to rival Major League Baseball since the merger of the National and American Leagues in 1903.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tFrom 1914-1915, the Federal League played major league level baseball in nine cities (Chicago, Indianapolis, Buffalo, Baltimore, Brooklyn, Newark, St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Kansas City).  Players such as Three-Finger Brown, Joe Tinker, Benny Kauf, Dutch Zwilling and Hal Chase all played for Federal League teams. The Federal League sued Major League Baseball in 1915, and a peace settlement was ultimately brokered thanks to the work of Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis (the Federal League was disbanded, with the teams and players absorbed by MLB - the owners were compensated as well).  Major League Baseball has enjoyed anti-trust exempt status ever since, and no significant challenges were made for the rest of the 20th century.\n"}]}
