Which is not one of them?", "correct": "Delphine", "options": ["Borquita", "Marie Jeanne", "Pauline"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDelphine.\n\n\tThe story begins in 1834 in New Orleans as Mme Delphine LaLaurie hosts an extravagant party in her household.  Flaunting her three daughters, Marie Jeanne, Pauline, and Borquita, she discusses their inner beauty.  Her youngest, Pauline, comments that perhaps her hidden talents lie in the boudoir; LaLaurie does not know of her relationship with one of her black servants.\rThat evening, LaLaurie sits in front of her mirror and smears herself with blood in an attempt to enhance her vitality.  Discovering that Pauline is possibly sleeping with the servant, she decides to punish the boy, Bastien (despite his claims that he's in love with someone else).  He's taken to a dungeon already occupied by tortured prisoners where LaLaurie places a severed bull head atop his.  She always wanted one of her own. \n"}, {"text": "Zoe was the first in her family to display signs of witchcraft.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn the present day, Zoe brings her boyfriend back to her place and leads him to the bedroom.  Clearly planning to sleep together, they undress and lie down.  She's worried about her first time and, when they begin, her boyfriend's nose starts to bleed.  He begins convulsing on the bed and dies of a brain aneurysm.\r Zoe's mother apparently never told her that she was a witch-- her great-grandmother had the same 'genetic affliction'.  When she informed her daughter she also had to send her south to New Orleans, allegedly the 'new Salem' after the witches from Massachusetts headed south after the trials, to a boarding school for girls like her.  In the company of an eccentric woman with vibrant hair, Zoe was left at the gate of Ms. Robichaux's Academy. \n"}, {"text": "When Zoe arrives at Ms. Robichaux's Academy, who is not a student there?", "correct": "Misty", "options": ["Madison", "Queenie", "Nan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMisty.\n\n\tZoe steps into the academy for the first time to find an empty building adorned with ancient portraits and lavish furniture.  Heading through the rooms, several figures in ornate masks appear in her periphery until one blocks her exit.  Cornered, Zoe is covered with a burlap sack and brought to a table where the figures attempt to sacrifice her as a joke. They reveal themselves to be witches as well-- Madison Montgomery (a movie star), Queenie, and Nan-- before the headmistress arrives and introduces herself as Cordelia Foxx.  She sends the others to get groceries from the van outside while she shows Zoe her room, informing her that Ms. Robichaux's Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies was established as a premier boarding school in 1790.  It was taken over by witches in the 1860s, establishing it as a safe haven and learning academy. It has since dwindled in its tenancy. \n"}, {"text": "According to common belief, the Supreme of a coven embodies how many gifts?", "correct": "Every single one", "options": ["None", "A small handful", "All but one"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvery single one.\n\n\tCordelia tells Zoe that witches are a dying breed.  Those who discovered witch blood in their family bloodlines chose not to reproduce.  Nonetheless, witches typically have a few natural gifts which manifest over their lives.  Most only have a couple, but a Supreme, some say, has all of them.  There is only one per generation. Back in the 1600s, many understood the dangers of their blood but these days no one knows of their ancestry.  Unfortunately, some don't come to recognize their powers until it's too late and they fall by the wayside.  Cordelia is there to help the girls not suppress, but harness their powers. \n"}, {"text": "What power does Misty Day have?", "correct": "Resurgence", "options": ["Paralysis", "Pyrokinesis", "Mind-control"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResurgence.\n\n\tWhile discussing the dangers of the outside world, Cordelia brings up Misty Day, a young Cajun woman who did not know the full extent of her powers of resurgence, the ability to bring things back to life.  Weeks earlier, Misty was seen drawing a soul back from the precipice in an act of resurrection.  This, however, was seen by many as necromancy.  She was burned at the stake for her supposed sins.\r Cordelia reinforces the fact that they are constantly at risk; by harnessing their powers they can protect themselves and each other from going extinct. \n"}, {"text": "Fiona has invested millions in scientific advancement to create which of these?", "correct": "Anti-aging formulas", "options": ["Transplant organs", "Lab-made magic powers", "New cosmetic drugs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnti-aging formulas.\n\n\tArriving at a scientific institute in the rain, current Supreme Fiona Goode investigates the trials being performed on a new serum using stem cells.  She demands that she be injected with the life-changing formula that day, but the concoction won't be ready for clinical trials for at least another two years.  She needs vitality and youth-- not plastic surgery.  He says no once more, but ultimately concedes by injecting her for five days.\r Later that week, the scientist heads to her hotel room to find her strung out and angry with the lack of results.  He says he'll leave his resignation, but she locks him into the room, uses her magic to seduce him, and kills him with a fatal kiss, draining the life from him. \n"}, {"text": "Cordelia is shown practicing which of the following forms of magic?", "correct": "Potion-making", "options": ["Transfiguration", "Pyrokinesis", "Voodoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPotion-making.\n\n\tThe four girls of Ms. Robichaux's sit down for dinner and discuss what makes them special.  Nan reveals that Zoe was sent to New Orleans because she killed her boyfriend, thus revealing that her own power is the ability to read minds (though not at will).  Madison was sent there after she killed her film director, dropping a stage light on his head with telekinesis.  Queenie, retaliating to Madison's insults and stories, demonstrates her ability to be a human voodoo doll.  Madison decides that due to a lack of candidates, Zoe will have to be her new best friend, and tells her to get dressed in something not from the Gap-- they're going to a frat party.\r Cordelia, meanwhile, creates some potions in her greenhouse, using the properties of herbs and plants to brew liquid magic.  She's surprised to see Fiona, her mother, in town since she was supposed to be off in Switzerland.  While she mixes up a restorative, Fiona says that Cordelia never really realized the full extent of her powers as the daughter of the Supreme.  Fortunately, Cordelia feels like she's done well.  Fiona doesn't-- the witches need to protect themselves from the coming storm and she's there to help. \n"}, {"text": "Who's responsible for flipping the bus of frat boys?", "correct": "Madison", "options": ["Zoe", "Kyle", "Fiona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadison.\n\n\tA bus of frat boys led by Kyle pulls up to a party and, after he gives them the ground rules on not allowing public urination or exposure, he sends his boys off to the event.  Zoe and Madison show up shortly thereafter and, because of her star power, everyone immediately notices the latter show up.  Kyle, however, immediately takes notice of Zoe and decides to introduce himself with a drink.\r Madison, meanwhile, finds herself in a back stairwell with a frat guy who, unknown to her, places a roofie in her drink.  It hits almost immediately and, against her will, she's pulled to a back room and sexually attacked by several of Kyle's frat boys.  When Kyle and Zoe notice something is wrong he heads upstairs and finds them caught in the act, chasing them out to the bus.  He gets knocked out by the other boys as they try to cover up the incident while Zoe and Madison chase behind.  Madison, enraged, uses her telekinesis to flip the bus.  Simple as that. \n"}, {"text": "Marie Laveau gave Mme. LaLaurie a potion allegedly meant for which of these?", "correct": "Love", "options": ["Youth", "Fame", "Fortune"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLove.\n\n\tThe next day, the fraternity bus crash makes the headlines of the news and Zoe walks in to catch the report.  As it turns out, two of the nine boys onboard are in critical condition; seven are dead.  Madison turns off the TV.  Nan realizes something is up before Fiona walks in to introduce herself.  She admits that she knows Madison was responsible and informs her that she was sloppy.  Then, she states that they're going on a field trip...and that they should change into something black.\r The trip takes them on a walking tour of the city.  On the walk they're told that they are each unique, but it's not enough; they have to work together to stay alive.  En route to their destination, however, Nan gets sidetracked to the household of Delphine LaLaurie, prompting Fiona to get them a free tour.\r LaLaurie was a woman of severe torture; her victims had their pancreas removed so that she could use the blood to extend her life.  One day, however, she was met by Marie Laveau, a woman who claimed that she had a love potion for her.  This was a trap; the potion was actually a horrible narcotic,.  Laveau was actually the lover of Bastien, and to save him she had to get creative.  Laveau found Bastien, now wearing the minotaur's head, in her torture chamber.  LaLaurie's body was never found.  Nan tells Fiona that the body is outside, buried under a brick path. \n"}, {"text": "Is Kyle one of the survivors of the crash?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tZoe heads to the hospital to see Kyle but, to her disappointment, he's not one of the two boys in critical condition.  He's dead.  One of the two boys, however, was the one responsible for attacking Madison.  This leaves her vengeful.  To get back at him she shuts the door and gets back at the horrible being in bed.  Drawing the curtain she arouses the boy and sits on top of him, killing him in the same way as her boyfriend by causing a deadly aneurysm.\r Fiona moves into the Academy once and for all and quickly heads out to perform an errand.  That night, using her mind-control powers, Fiona persuades two men to dig up a casket beneath Mme. LaLaurie's garden path.  Inside she finds the woman bound and, after over a century, alive. \n"}]}
