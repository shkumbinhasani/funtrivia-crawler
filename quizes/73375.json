{"id": "73375", "name": "Krypton Quiz | Chemistry | 5 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Chemistry", "Specific Elements"], "questions": [{"text": "The atomic symbol for krypton is:", "correct": "Kr", "options": ["Kt", "K", "Sm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKr.\n\n\t'K' is potassium (Latin: {kalium);} 'Sm' is Samarium (not Superman). 'Kt' is not a valid symbol. \n"}, {"text": "The name krypton is Greek for:", "correct": "hidden", "options": ["green", "heavy", "death"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhidden.\n\n\tGreek 'kryptos'. Krypton exists in the Earth's atmosphere at only one part per million. In comparison, oxygen exists at 200,000 ppm, so krypton is indeed hidden. \n"}, {"text": "Krypton's major spectral lines are these two colors:", "correct": "orange and green", "options": ["violet and green", "red and green", "blue and yellow"], "explanation": "\n\n\norange and green.\n\n\tThe orange-red spectral line of Kr-86 was the basis for the 'meter' measurement of the Metric System. \n"}, {"text": "Krypton has 6 stable isotopes. The longest lived of its unstable isotopes has a half-life of:", "correct": "210,000 years", "options": ["3 seconds", "5280 years", "15 hours"], "explanation": "\n\n\n210,000 years.\n\n\tKr-81 has a half-life of 210,000 years. It is sandwiched between two stable isotopes: Kr-80 and Kr-82. \n"}, {"text": "Krypton is grouped in this classification group:", "correct": "noble gas", "options": ["halogen", "rare earth", "non-metal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnoble gas.\n\n\tAs such, it does not readily form compounds with other elements. However, compounds with fluoride and molecule-ions with other noble gases have been identified. \n"}]}
