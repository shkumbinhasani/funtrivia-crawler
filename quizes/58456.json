{"id": "58456", "name": "Evolution and the Creationists Trivia Quiz | Sci / Tech | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Biology", "Evolution"], "questions": [{"text": "What, exactly, is the theory of evolution?", "correct": "Living things are related to each other through common ancestry from earlier forms that were different from them", "options": ["Humans evolved from apes", "New species have arisen through a process of random mutations", "Life always becomes more complex"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiving things are related to each other through common ancestry from earlier forms that were different from them.\n\n\tIn order to understand the arguments over evolution, we must first understand what it is! It is a theory that encompasses all living things, not just humans. \n"}, {"text": "Evolution is just a theory, which means it can't really be a fact.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe difference here is between the scientific meaning of theory and the everyday 'detective story' meaning. In the everyday world, a theory is just a guess. To the scientist, a theory is a system of facts and hypotheses that is accepted as the explanation of a given phenomenon. Theory formation is the purpose of science. In this sense, evolution is a theory- but so is gravity (the theory of gravity), electricity (electromagnetic theory), quantum theory, the theory of relativity, and so on. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is the most powerful driving force of evolution?", "correct": "Natural selection", "options": ["Genetic drift", "Random mutation", "Isolation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNatural selection.\n\n\tNatural selection, the process made famous by Darwin, is the most important means of evolution. As one scientist defined it, 'Natural selection dictates that individuals with traits and variations better suited to the environment are more likely to survive than others who are less well-suited. Because they compete more successfully for mates and limited resources, and live longer, the fitter individuals leave more offspring, and their favorable traits are passed on to succeeding generations.The traits spread through the population, and eventually, perhaps, cause it to evolve into a new species.' However, creationists seek to deny natural selection by ignoring it. Duane Gish, mentioned below, has written a book for young people called 'The Amazing Story of Creation From Science and the Bible'. As one reviewer wrote, 'Not once in the book does he mention natural selection, the most important mechanism of evolution.By downplaying and ignoring the role of natural selection, Gish makes evolution seem absurd. He represents it as occurring entirely by chance and mutations.' \n"}, {"text": "The National Academy of Sciences advises that students in biology classes should be taught creation theory as well as evolution.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\t'The Academy states unequivocally that the tenets of 'creation science' are not supported by scientific evidence, that creationism has no place in a science curriculum at any level, that its proposed teaching would be impossible in any constructive sense for well-informed and conscientious science teachers, and that its teaching would be contrary to the nation's need for a scientifically literate citizenry and for a large well-informed pool of scientific and technical personnel.' \n"}, {"text": "A popular argument by creationists is that evolution could never have occurred because it is so unlikely. As one example, they have stated,' There are n! (n-factorial: n x n-1 x n-2 x...x 1) ways of an enzyme or DNA strand of n parts forming prebiotically. Since the smallest proteins have at least 100 amino acids, the chance of forming a particular enzyme prebiotically is at most 1 divided by 100!, which is small enough to be disregarded.' What is wrong with this argument?", "correct": "Complex molecules don't form by chance alone", "options": ["The math is incorrect", "Enzymes can only be formed in living things", "Larger proteins have fewer amino acids"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComplex molecules don't form by chance alone.\n\n\tWhile this argument correctly demonstrates that no given protein could have come into existence all at once by pure chance, such a demonstration is irrelevant to current origin-of-life research. As Iris Fry points out, 'origin-of-life theories rely on various organizing principles, including selection mechanisms and catalysis, that are supposed to have limited and constrained the wide scope of possible prebiotic possibilities, thus constructing the scaffolding out of which the living arch eventually emerged'. \n"}, {"text": "Evolution is impossible because it breaks the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the entropy (disorder) of a system increases over time.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis misinterpretation of the Second Law is common. This law applies only to a closed system, with nothing going in or out. Environments on Earth are not such systems. In addition, nothing in the Second Law contradicts local reverses in entropy. For example, snowflakes and mineral crystals are more orderly than their components.As one scientist said, 'Everything in this world that works, works by temporarily and locally reducing entropy. ' All the Second Law says is that, for the system as a whole, entropy will increase over time. Ilya Prigogine won the Nobel prize in 1977 for his work on the Second Law. His papers include one on how the Second Law does not contradict evolution.Arch-creationist Duane Gish of the Institute for Creation Research responded 'Prigogine's theoretical ideas are buttressed with a large amount of complicated mathematics which few biochemists and molecular biologists can understand, but it all does look deliciously scientific.' This is a classic example of poor logic. \n"}, {"text": "Human embryos have tails.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tA delicious (although not entirely accurate) witticism on this situation is that 'Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,' or embryonic development mirrors the evolutionary process. Although the human embryo doesn't entirely follow the evolutionary path, it does in some respects. If we never had creatures in our background with tails, why would our embryos ever have them? \n"}, {"text": "Male humans have one less pair of ribs than female humans.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlthough the Bible states that Eve was created from Adam's rib, males have exactly as many ribs as females. \n"}, {"text": "Bacteria and viruses are mentioned in the Bible.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIf the Bible were an inerrant source of factual scientific information, one would expect it to display at least some knowledge of germ theory, not to reflect the understandable ignorance of people in a time before microscopes. However, there is no mention or revelation whatsoever in the Bible of any scientific facts that were not already common knowledge among the people of the day. \n"}, {"text": "The hair stands up on the back of our necks when we are afraid. What does this have to do with evolution?", "correct": "Our ancestors looked bigger when they were frightened if their hair stood up", "options": ["It shows our muscular structure is similar to that of apes", "Nothing", "Only humans have evolved this gesture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOur ancestors looked bigger when they were frightened if their hair stood up.\n\n\tTo get an example of this physiological phenomenon, one need look no further than the family cat when it's scared by a dog, puffing up and hissing. This 'piloerection' is nearly universal among mammals- chimpanzees do it too. However, in modern-day short-haired humans, the gesture has lost its original significance. If it is not an evolved response, why should we have it at all? \n"}, {"text": "What do goosebumps have to do with evolution?", "correct": "Our ancestors were warmer when they fluffed up their hair", "options": ["Nothing", "They prove we are related to birds", "They are unique to humans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOur ancestors were warmer when they fluffed up their hair.\n\n\tAgain, this is easily observable in modern-day birds and mammals. Also, again, it's easily explainable by evolution, but not by creation. As one scientist put it, 'Goosebumps were obviously 'created' to erect and 'fluff up' the hair or fur on a hairy or furry mammal ancestor, thereby improving its insulation value against the cold. Since most of us nowadays have so little body hair as to render it useless for insulation purposes, goosebumps are another vestigial reaction whose tool (fur) is no longer with us.' \n"}, {"text": "We humans have lower back pain, varicose veins, and childbirth difficulties- what do these have to do with evolution?", "correct": "They are examples of inferior design", "options": ["They are shared with chimpanzees", "They cannot have evolved because they are harmful", "Nothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are examples of inferior design.\n\n\tOne would expect that if humans were created by a perfect creator, in his image, as the pinnacle of his creation, that they would be examples of perfection in design. Alas, it isn't so. We, along with all other living things, have plenty of 'jury-rigged' and non-optimal designs that do the job, but lack elegance.Our aching backs and varicose veins are legacies of our four-footed ancestors. Humans are relatively recent bipeds, and our structure is still very much like that of a four-legged animal. We lack the necessary musculature to strengthen our backs, and our veins are not well-designed for the pressures that an upright stance puts on them.Female pelvises are not optimally designed for the passage of large-headed infants, as the human species has only recently undergone a tremendous spurt in brain growth. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following animals has the most ideally-engineered eye-i.e., from an engineering standpoint, the eye that makes the most \"sense\" in the arrangement of its structures?", "correct": "Squid", "options": ["Human", "Eagle", "Fly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSquid.\n\n\tThe eyes of mammals, including humans, have retinas that are are inside-out. The nerves and blood vessels come out through the light-sensitive area of the retina, producing a blind spot. They then spread over the light-sensitive area of the retina, providing a barrier to light entering the eye. An ideal design would be to have these nerves and capillaries behind the retina. Human eyes aren't designed this way- but squid eyes are. Once again, why should the pinnacle of creation have an imperfect design? \n"}, {"text": "Why do carnivores present a problem for creationist theory?", "correct": "Supposedly, all animals were originally designed as herbivores, so why were the carnivore modifications (like fangs and claws) created in the original animals?", "options": ["They aren't mentioned in the Bible", "They don't", "Why would a just God have created killer animals?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSupposedly, all animals were originally designed as herbivores, so why were the carnivore modifications (like fangs and claws) created in the original animals?.\n\n\tIn the supposed idyll of Eden, all animals were herbivores, implying that all were created as herbivores and were to remain so. Then, of course, Adam messed things up. But, if all the original animals were herbivores, why would they need fangs, claws, poison, webs? And why would herbivores need great speed, chemical defenses, quills or bad tastes? \n"}, {"text": "What one characteristic below do all mammals share?", "correct": "Five digits per limb- either complete or vestigial", "options": ["Well-developed sense of sight", "Hair at all stages of development", "Give birth to live young"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive digits per limb- either complete or vestigial.\n\n\tYes, that includes whales that have five digits per flipper, bats that have five digits per wing, horses and antelopes that have vestigial remains of five digits, etc. Five digits isn't the most effective design for many of these creatures- so why should all show the remnants that are easily explained by theorizing that they all descended from a five-toed ancestor? The answer is not \"Give birth to live young\" because the monotreme mammals, the platypus and echidna, lay eggs. \n"}, {"text": "Why do men and other male mammals have nipples?", "correct": "As embryos, all mammals start out phenotypically female", "options": ["There is no reason, they were just created that way", "Some male mammals give milk", "Males need them to produce hormones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs embryos, all mammals start out phenotypically female.\n\n\tOnly later in development, after the nipples have formed, does a hormonal surge form male sexual structures. This would be an odd thing for a perfect creator to explain, as male nipples are not only useless, they can be dangerous (males can get breast cancer!) \n"}, {"text": "Creationists claim that fossils are the remains of the living organisms that perished in Noah's Flood. The Karoo Formation in Africa contains the remains of over 800 billion vertebrate animals. If this were a true representation of how many vertebrates were killed in the flood, how many vertebrate animals would each acre of land on Earth have held at the time of the flood?", "correct": "2100", "options": ["134", "12", "2"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2100.\n\n\tObviously, this would be a very crowded Earth! \n"}, {"text": "Most religious groups oppose evolutionary theory.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe opposite is true. Very few religions have doctrines opposing evolutionary theory. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only state in the US, as of November, 2001, that mandates an anti-evolution warning in its textbooks?", "correct": "Alabama", "options": ["Georgia", "Missouri", "Arkansas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlabama.\n\n\tSimilar laws have been thrown out in all other states that had them. \n"}, {"text": "What is the main argument given by scientists for why creationism should not be given 'equal time' in our science classes?", "correct": "Science is not a democratic process", "options": ["Scientists do not believe in God", "Most scientists accept creationism", "Scientists think that they have all the answers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScience is not a democratic process.\n\n\tWe should decide which scientific theory is superior and should be used in education by its power to explain successfully, not on how popular it is. Creationism is not a science, it is a religious belief system. As such, it may have its place in a humanities class, alongside other religious belief systems, but not in a science class. \n"}]}
