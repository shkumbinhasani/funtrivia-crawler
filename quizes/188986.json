{"id": "188986", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'Change Day' Trivia Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 6 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "Colonel Potter receives a phone call from army headquarters, it's his pal Colonel Abrams.  The army has decided to issue new military money in exchange for the old.  What is the term that is used for this army issue currency? ", "correct": "Scrip", "options": ["Recur", "Float", "T-note"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScrip.\n\n\tThe term 'scrip' is short for 'subscription receipt', and refers to provisional certificates of money issued by banks, companies or other organizations (for example, the U.S. army) that may be used to exchange for formal, government issued currency.  The point of using scrip is to fight off counterfeiters and black marketeers, as the scrip can be more frequently changed. \n"}, {"text": "And now for a question that will test your attention span.  The currency exchange will involve a switch from which color money to which color?", "correct": "Blue to red", "options": ["Red to green", "Blue to yellow", "Yellow to green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue to red.\n\n\tMy apologies for the very detailed question, but I felt it necessary to see if you were paying attention.  After all, beginning the following day, the blue scrip will become worthless.  Colonel Potter instructs Klinger to make sure that all roads in and out of the compound be guarded by military police so that black marketeers will be unable to have access to the camp with their arbitrage schemes (foreshadowing!) \n"}, {"text": "Charles has caught wind of the currency exchange and sees an opportunity to play profiteer.  Since the locals will not be able to participate in the exchange, Charles has offered to exchange their military issued cash for actual U.S. dollars, but at what very unfair ratio?", "correct": "10-to-1", "options": ["2-to-1", "20-to-1", "5-to-1"], "explanation": "\n\n\n10-to-1.\n\n\tCharles, who is already very wealthy, nonetheless cannot resist the opportunity to make a profit.  He suggests a scheme to his tailor and prospective partner Mr. Kim that all the locals be gathered so an exchange be made.  Of course, Mr. Kim will benefit as well, but only to the meager tune of 2% of the profit. \n"}, {"text": "When questioned by Mr. Kim (who has been tailoring clothes for Charles) about why a wealthy American would desire to make such a profit from the poor locals, what does Charles use as his reasoning?", "correct": "It's the hunt!", "options": ["It's the principle of it!", "It's the profit!", "It's the American way!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's the hunt!.\n\n\tCharles responds to Mr. Kim's query as follows: 'It's the hunt!  It's the challenge of scenting the spoor of opportunity and tracking it down.  Besides, we're just acting as business agents for your people.  We're doing them a big favor.'\r Charles essentially blackmails Mr. Kim into helping him with this scheme, offering the latter the choice of a check for his tailoring services that might take months to cash or cash tomorrow.  Mr. Kim reluctantly chooses the latter. \n"}, {"text": "Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger has been acting very unusual during this episode.  Everything is by the numbers for Klinger, and he is wearing a full military uniform, including the underwear!  We soon discover that Klinger has amended his behavior in order to find entrance into which of these military academies?", "correct": "West Point", "options": ["The Naval Academy", "The Air Force Academy", "Virginia Military Institute"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWest Point.\n\n\tHawkeye's response when confronted with this information about Klinger goes as follows: 'One day our little brown-eyed girl is running around in a floppy hat and a beard, and the next day she's off to West Point.'  BJ adds, 'That brilliant screwball finally did it!  He's getting out of the service by joining the army!'\r Klinger admits that his Uncle Gus helped him get an invitation to attend West Point, thanks to his connection with a certain local congressman. \n"}, {"text": "Following Colonel Potter's announcement about Klinger, and Klinger's subsequent verification of the news, the other members of the 'M*A*S*H' crew are suitably shocked.  As they discuss these turn of events, a confrontation occurs nearby between Igor and Zale.  Oddly enough, Igor is not played by Jeff Maxwell, but rather by which of these bit actors that later appeared in 'Animal House', among other films?", "correct": "Peter Riegert", "options": ["Timothy Brown", "Johnny Haymer", "G. W. Bailey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter Riegert.\n\n\tAs you 'M*A*S*H' fans are probably aware, Johnny Haymer portrayed Zale, G. W. Bailey was Luther Rizzo and Timothy Brown played Spearchucker.  Corporal Igor Straminsky was portrayed by Jeff Maxwell on the show from 1974 until the final episode in 1983 with two exceptions, this episode ('Change Day') and the earlier sixth season episode 'War of Nerves'.  Peter Riegert went on to play Boon in the 1978 film 'Animal House'.  I'm not sure why Maxwell was not portraying his Igor character in either of these two episodes. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye has agreed to do a favor for Corporal Boone, who is laid up in the post-op tent.  Namely, he will swap the young man's $400 dollars during the currency exchange the following day.  Unfortunately, Hawkeye is unable to keep a hold of the Corporal's money, as it is stolen from which of these locations?", "correct": "Mess tent", "options": ["The showers", "Operating room", "The Swamp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMess tent.\n\n\tWhen Igor and Zale enter into fisticuffs, everyone in the mess tent runs out to bear witness, that is, almost everyone.  While Hawkeye and friends view the brouhaha boiling outside the mess tent, someone steals the canvas bag in which Corporal Boone's army scrip has been held.  Inside the bag was $400 dollars in blue scrip ready for exchange! \n"}, {"text": "In order for Klinger to leave Korea and the 4077th, he must pass an army entrance exam.  Our favorite cross-dressing corporal thinks he will simply breeze through the test, but he's wrong.  What sort of question trips Klinger up right from the beginning?", "correct": "Math", "options": ["English", "Biology", "Chemistry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMath.\n\n\tThe first question Klinger reads: \r 'Mary's mother sent her to the store to get nine large cans of beans.  Mary could only carry two cans at a time.  How many trips to the store did Mary have to take?'\r Of course the simple answer is five.  But Klinger is unable to decipher such a complex question of arithmatic.  Klinger's responds to the question, 'What kind of family would only feed their children beans?'\r Needless to say, Klingger (That's the way he spells his name on the exam before Potter corrects him!) fails the exam miserably. \n"}, {"text": "Charles' scheme to make big money on the currency exchange is tripped up.  What unfortunate turn of events occurs, forcing Charles to be late to the camp?", "correct": "A roadblock", "options": ["He gets lost", "A flat tire", "He is forced to abandon his jeep under enemy fire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA roadblock.\n\n\tBJ and Hawkeye caught wind of Charles' plan to cheat the locals and had their MP pal set up a roadblock, forcing the Major to walk back to the 4077th.  Unfortunately for Charles, he does not make it before the deadline, 1600 hours.  Hawkeye and BJ show up at just the right moment to exchange $400 of Charles' money (in order to pay back Boone's stolen cash), of course giving Charles only one dollar in exchange for every ten. \n"}, {"text": "Is Corporal Boone's money ever returned by the thief?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tBJ and Hawkeye are able to scam Charles out of $400 in blue scrip, which they exchange for red.  This scrip is then returned to Boone.  While in the process of refunding Boone his money, Father Mulcahy runs in with good news, the canvas bag containing the Corporal's cash has been returned.  Earlier in the episode, the good Father had made a fire and brimstone appeal to the dwellers of the camp that Boone's money be returned, and this turns out to have been effective.  Hawkeye suggests that Father Mulcahy keep the other $400 for his orphans.  All's well that ends well, with the exception of one unhappy Winchester.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope that you enjoyed it and will try my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
