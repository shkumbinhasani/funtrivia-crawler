Which of these players began his career with Millwall, went on to play for Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United (winning the European Champions Cup with the latter), before doing the unthinkable in 2004 and signing with West Ham?", "correct": "Teddy Sheringham", "options": ["Neil Harris", "Barry Kitchener", "Billy Bonds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeddy Sheringham.\n\n\tSheringham signed for Millwall in 1983 as a teenager and scored their first ever home top-flight goal in 1987.

He enjoyed a successful career with the Gunners, winning two league titles and two FA Cups. \n"}, {"text": "Newcastle United and Sunderland have been contesting the \"Tyne-Wear derby\" since 1883.
