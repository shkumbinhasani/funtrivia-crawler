Which of the following 2di does it connect with at its northern end?", "correct": "I-70", "options": ["I-66", "I-95", "I-25"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI-70.\n\n\tSince it ends in '70', I-270 intersects with I-70. \n"}, {"text": "What 3di is the longest?", "correct": "I-476 (PA)", "options": ["I-495 (MA)", "I-115 (MT)", "I-270 (MD)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI-476 (PA).\n\n\tIt's 129.61 miles, from Philadelphia to Scranton. It used to only be 21 miles, until State Route 9 was redesignated an interstate. \n"}, {"text": "What 3di is the shortest?", "correct": "I-375 (MI)", "options": ["I-290 (MA)", "I-270 (CO)", "I-395 (MD)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI-375 (MI).\n\n\tIt's 1.06 miles long.  It goes from I-75 to the Civic Center. The freeway dates back to 1965, but number dates back to 1970 or earlier.\r Baltimore's I-395 had been shortest at only 0.72 miles long.  But its northern entrance ramps are now considered to be a part of its official length, so it's now 1.98 miles long. \n"}, {"text": "What is unique about I-238, in Hayward, CA?", "correct": "It doesn't intersect I-38", "options": ["It has a stoplight in the middle of its length", "It goes through two states", "it has a spur off of it called I-1238"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt doesn't intersect I-38.\n\n\tAnd the reason it doesn't: there is no I-38! 238 was the state route number for the highway being upgraded to interstate standards. But they had run out of numbers ending in '80'. Another nearby highway, CA 17, got the designation {I-880;} CA 238 became I-238. \n"}, {"text": "How many different I-295 segments are there?", "correct": "7", "options": ["5", "3", "2"], "explanation": "\n\n\n7.\n\n\tThe seven distinct I-295's are in Maine, Massachusetts-Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey-Delaware, DC-Maryland, Virginia, and Florida. \n"}, {"text": "Louisville, KY is unique in the nation because of its 2 3di's.

Only 2 miles goes through Indiana. Also, the Capital Beltway, I-495, goes through Virginia, Maryland, and the very bottom corner of the District of Columbia. But DC isn't a state. \n"}, {"text": "The Long Island Expressway is also designated", "correct": "I-495", "options": ["I-290", "I-287", "I-476"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI-495.\n\n"}, {"text": "I-395 (VA-DC) is also called this", "correct": "Shirley Highway", "options": ["Capital Spur", "Pentagon Throughway", "Jefferson Davis Highway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShirley Highway.\n\n\tIt was named after Henry G. Shirley, who was the Virginia Highway Commissioner who gave the 'go ahead' for work on the expressway.

Slightly tricky: although Hawaii has no highways that go from state to state, they do have interstate-grade highways funded the same as the contiguous states' interstates. One, I-H1, has a 3di: I-H201. \n"}, {"text": "Wyoming's only 3di, I-180, is unique in what way?", "correct": "it has traffic light in the middle", "options": ["doesn't intersect I-80", "it's a one way road", "it's only a 2-lane road"], "explanation": "\n\n\nit has traffic light in the middle.\n\n\tIt's in Cheyenne.

It's the only interstate divisible by 111. If you hate using impersonal numbers, call I-444 by its catchy name -- the Inner Dispersal Loop. Like Texas' I-345, I-444 is not signed. There is a proposal for a I-555 in Arkansas. \n"}, {"text": "What's unique about the three-digit interstate highways of I-76?", "correct": "They all are in Pennsylvania", "options": ["They are all shorter than 10 miles", "They all go between two states", "They all intersect each other"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey all are in Pennsylvania.\n\n\tThere are 5 existing 3-digit variations of I-76: 176, 276, 376, 476, 676.

But in 1977, the final part of I-95 through Washington was {cancelled;} I-95 inside the Beltway was renumbered I-395 and the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered I-95 so that I-95 would be continuous. Then in 1993, the whole Beltway was again numbered I-495, with the eastern half having a dual I-95 and I-495 designation. \n"}, {"text": "What 3di has the highest number?", "correct": "I-990", "options": ["I-995", "I-999", "I-897"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI-990.\n\n\tThe Lockport Expressway, a 5 mile spur off I-290 to the Millersport Hwy (NY 263) in the Buffalo suburbs.
