Difficult [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "A 'petasus' was a broad-brimmed cap worn low on the brow by travelers of ancient Greece, probably to keep out the sun.  With which of the Greek gods was the petasus associated?  ", "correct": "Hermes", "options": ["Apollo", "Hades", "Poseidon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHermes.\n\n\tHermes had quite a collection of interesting accoutrements with which he was associated.  Aside from his winged petasus, he also carried a staff called a caduceus (that he had acquired from Apollo) and donned winged sandals on his feet called 'talaria'.  I suppose all the wings helped increase his speed, which is important for a messenger god, no doubt! \n"}, {"text": "The name for which Italian sauce comes from an Italian language word that means 'press' or 'pound'?  ", "correct": "Pesto", "options": ["Alfredo", "Marinara", "Ragu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPesto.\n\n\tThe name 'pesto', which is applied to a wonderful sauce of crushed basil leaves, pine nuts, garlic and other ingredients, and goes perfectly with fettuccine, is from the Italian word 'pestare', which means 'pound, crush'.   The very best way to prepare a good pesto sauce is to toss the required ingredients into a mortar and crush them with a pestle, thus the name. \n"}, {"text": "The 'alula', or 'spurious wing', of a bird is homologous with which digit of the human body?  \n", "correct": "Thumb", "options": ["Pinkie finger", "Pinkie toe", "Big toe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThumb.\n\n\tThe term 'alula' comes from the Latin for 'small wing', and is pluralized 'alulae'.  Typically, a bird's alula arises as the first joint on a bird's wing, where a small tuft of quill feathers appears.  The alula contains homologous bones with the human thumb, but naturally does not serve the same function.  The alula is also known as the 'spurious' or 'bastard' wing. \n"}, {"text": "In ancient Rome, gladiatorial combat was certainly a popular spectacle in the public amphitheater.  Of the four types of gladiators of that ancient era, which would wield a net among his weapons?  ", "correct": "Retiarius", "options": ["Samnis", "Myrmillo", "Thrax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRetiarius.\n\n\tThe retiarii would carry a net (the name retiarius comes from the Latin word for net, 'rete') which they would use to trap their opponents before coming in for the kill with either a trident or a dagger.  A myrmillo would typically carry a sword and shield, as would a samnis, while a thrax would wield a scimitar along with a shield.  Men who took part in gladiatorial combat with beasts were known as 'bestiarii'.  Shockingly, many gladiators, including the emperor Commodus, entered combat voluntarily. \n"}, {"text": "First appearing in the late 1600s, the 'chalumeau' was the precursor to which modern musical instrument?  \n", "correct": "Clarinet", "options": ["Harp", "Flute", "Trombone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClarinet.\n\n\tThe chalumeau (pl. chalumeaux) derived its name, which is French, originally from the Latin word 'calamellus', which means 'little reed'.

The story goes that he took the customs of Phoenicia with him to Boeotia, on the Greek mainland, and established the city of Thebes.  There he introduced the original 16 letter alphabet that would eventually develop into the Greek alphabet as we know it today.  And, of course, the Roman writing system arose from the Greek letters, and in turn the letters we use today arose from the Latin alphabet.  This quiz was brought to you in part by Cadmus. \n"}, {"text": "What is the Korean term that can be used to describe huge conglomerate organizations, such as Samsung and Hyundai, that essentially make the South Korean economy go?

The Japanese equivalent term is 'keiretsu'. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the inventor of the first submarine used in naval combat, 'The Turtle', which was employed unsuccessfully during the American Revolutionary war?

In 1776 it was used to attack (ultimately unsuccessfully) the British warship called 'The Eagle' in New York harbor.  A device meant to drill a hole in the side of warships failed to work properly, and the mission aboard the single-man, hand-cranked submarine was abandoned. \n"}, {"text": "Which famous road of history stretched from the town of Lashio to the city of Kunming?  \n", "correct": "Burma Road", "options": ["Silk Road", "Ho Chi Minh Trail", "Appian Way"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurma Road.\n\n\tThe Burma Road was opened during the late 1930s as a way for the British and Americans to continue trade with China, engaged at the time in war with Japan.  The road continued to be employed as a way of supplying the desperate Chinese nationalists during the early years of World War II, until it was captured by the Japanese in 1941.  Allied forces did not recapture the road until 1945, not long before the end of the war.
