These saintly folk needed a sedate name for their entertainment, to show that it wasn't just a frivolous pursuit. What did they call their spelling contests?", "correct": "Spelling schools", "options": ["Spelling churches", "Spelling matches", "Spelling rounds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpelling schools.\n\n\tThis title certainly did not give the impression of a wild and rowdy event! Instead, the \"spelling schools\" were competitive but peaceful evening events. \n"}, {"text": "Spelling bees are uncommon in countries outside the US. Why?", "correct": "Most languages are spelled phonetically; a spelling bee wouldn't be much of a challenge!", "options": ["Spelling bees are a product of a democratic society", "Most educational systems in other countries place little emphasis on spelling", "All of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMost languages are spelled phonetically; a spelling bee wouldn't be much of a challenge!.\n\n\tDue to its roots in a multiplicity of languages, English is fiendishly inconsistent when it comes to the spelling of words. In contrast, most other languages follow strict phonetic rules, and thus a spelling bee in Spanish or Russian would pose little challenge. \n"}, {"text": "As evidence of the declining state of US education, some people have used the argument that the winning words for the National Spelling Bee today are much simpler to spell than those of 50 years ago.
