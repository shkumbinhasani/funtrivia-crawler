{"id": "371535", "name": "How to Play the Game Quiz | Topics for Kids | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Games and Toys for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "To play this game, you'll need a deck of cards that tells you what color square to go to on the path. Maybe you'll get all the way to King Kandy! What game is this?", "correct": "Candy Land", "options": ["Monopoly", "Payday", "Hungry Hungry Hippos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCandy Land.\n\n\tOn the Candy Land board, a path made of colorful squares takes you through a magical land made of all different types of candy. Along the way you might visit Gramma Nutt in the Peanut Brittle House or see the Lollipop Forest. Delicious! \n"}, {"text": "Lots of fun games can be played with an ordinary deck of cards. Which game needs its own, special cards?", "correct": "Uno", "options": ["War", "Crazy Eights", "Solitaire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUno.\n\n\tWhen you play Uno, you want to use up all your cards by placing them in the pile in the center -- but you can only put a card down if it matches the last card's color or number (or if it's wild). To make matters worse, the other players can make you pick up new cards! \n"}, {"text": "When you're playing checkers (draughts), how do you move the pieces on the board?", "correct": "Diagonally", "options": ["Straight ahead one square at a time", "Sideways", "Straight ahead two squares at a time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiagonally.\n\n\tThe pieces in checkers all move and capture diagonally. Ordinary pieces can only move forward, but later in the game a kinged piece can move in either direction. \n"}, {"text": "Hi-ho! You play this game with a spinner that tells you how much plastic fruit you can harvest from your tree -- or how much you have to return. What kind of fruit are you putting in your bucket?", "correct": "Cherries", "options": ["Bananas", "Kiwis", "Blueberries"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCherries.\n\n\tIn Hi-Ho! Cherry-O, each player has their own cherry tree with little plastic cherries and their own bucket for harvesting. You want to get all the cherries off the tree and into your bucket -- but watch out! The spinner might tell you a cherry's been stolen by a bird, or even that your whole bucket has overturned. \n"}, {"text": "While we play this game, we're building a huge and complicated machine. At the end of the game, we can use it to try to catch the other players' pieces! What are we playing?", "correct": "Mouse Trap", "options": ["The Game of Life", "Monopoly", "Jenga"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMouse Trap.\n\n\tEvery player controls a mouse, and the winner is the last one left after all the other mice have been caught in the mouse trap. If it's been built right, the mouse trap is fun to watch all on its own. Here's how it goes, according to a song in a commercial: \"\"Just turn the crank, and snap the plank, and boot the marble right down the chute, now watch it roll and hit the pole, and knock the ball in the rub-a-dub tub, which hits the man into the pan. The trap is set, here comes the net!\" \n"}, {"text": "Now we're all moving around a board, trying to collect jewelry and hang onto a crown. What game are we playing?", "correct": "Pretty Pretty Princess", "options": ["Monopoly", "Mystery Date", "The Game of Life"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPretty Pretty Princess.\n\n\tTo win, you have to have the necklace, bracelet, earrings and ring in your color -- and you have to be the one with the crown. And watch out -- if you're stuck with the black ring at the end, you'll lose! \n"}, {"text": "You and your friends are sitting around a plastic tray with a lot of marbles in the middle. Each of you has a lever to open the mouth of your creature so it can \"eat\" the marbles. What animal are you controlling?", "correct": "Hippopotamus", "options": ["Dog", "Giraffe", "Eagle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHippopotamus.\n\n\tThe game is Hungry Hungry Hippos. Each player controls one hippo with a lever that opens and closes its mouth. All that motion shakes the tray so the marbles roll randomly around. The winner is the one whose hippo managed to swallow the most marbles! \n"}, {"text": "Tic-tac-toe, three in a row! In a new tic-tac-toe game, how many spaces are there where you can put an X or an O?", "correct": "9", "options": ["64", "25", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n9.\n\n\tA tic-tac-toe board is usually just drawn on paper as a square that's three spaces wide and three spaces tall. That makes nine spaces altogether! The two players take turns to write their symbols (Xs or Os) in a space, trying to get three in a row. Sometimes this game is also called Noughts and Crosses, or Xs and Os. \n"}, {"text": "In this game you roll the dice move across the board to square 100 -- but if you ever land at the top of a snake you'll fall backward! Which of these is a way to jump ahead on the board?", "correct": "Ladder", "options": ["Pogo stick", "Rocket", "Racecar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLadder.\n\n\tThe game is Snakes and Ladders, although some copies use chutes instead of snakes and are sold as Chutes and Ladders. With 99 squares to get through, it would be slow going without the ladders -- but the snakes can be heartbreaking even so. \n"}, {"text": "\"Right foot, green!\" says the spinner. On the game mat on the floor, everybody has to put their right foot on a green space, no matter how tangled they get. What game are we playing?", "correct": "Twister", "options": ["Operation", "Sorry!", "Pictionary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwister.\n\n\tIn Twister, your whole body is the game piece. You have to get your hands and feet on the right colors without falling down and without being knocked over by the other players. That mat gets pretty crowded and that's where the game really gets fun! \n"}]}
