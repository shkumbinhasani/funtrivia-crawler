I'm using all the retired superheroes of the world to build the perfect supervillain robot - and, with them dead, my amazing technology will make me the world's only superhero. I'll finance my retirement by selling my inventions to the public - and, \"when everyone is super, no one will be.\" The retired Supers are all too happy to come fight my prototype - there's no way they know what I really have planned. In which of these movies can you catch me monologuing?", "correct": "The Incredibles", "options": ["Zoom", "Man of Steel", "The Avengers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Incredibles.\n\n\tThis 2004 Pixar movie takes an unaccountably pro-Incredible view of the world, but it's still worth seeing for Jason Lee's star turn voicing me - the one and only Syndrome. When I was a kid, I wanted nothing more than to be Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), but he didn't want me as his sidekick. He's going to regret that! I lured him in once to fight my battle robot, and now his whole family of superheroes-in-hiding is stuck on my island.(It's volcanic, naturally. Just being smarter than everybody else doesn't mean I can't appreciate a good clich\u00e9 -- or, in this case, an evil one.) There's no way they'll win! \n"}, {"text": "Ha! This ragtag band of rebels thinks I'm on their side, running from the machines in the good ship Nebuchadnezzar and plugging in to save humanity from their captors. There's no way they know I've cut a separate deal with our enemies - all I have to do is sell out my crewmates and I'll have a beautiful life. In what movie do I make my play?", "correct": "The Matrix", "options": ["Blade Runner", "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Gattaca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Matrix.\n\n\t\"The Matrix\" is what we call the simulation that the machines have built to keep humanity under captivity, so it seemed like a good title idea for the 1999 movie, too. I'm Cypher (played by Joe Pantoliano). It may look like Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the star of the film, but give me a break - he may be the One who can save humanity, but really he spends the whole movie just as confused as the audience. He can't stop me, anyway - that would take a Tank.\r I started out just as wide-eyed and curious as he was, wanting to know what lay beneath reality, wanting to help out the last free human city of Zion. I didn't realize how tough things would be. As I ask in the movie: \"Why, oh why didn't I take the blue pill\" and just stay in the Matrix? Luckily, I've got a second chance: if I hand over my captain, Morpheus, to the agents, they'll plug me back in and make me an actor or something. Who cares if it's real or not? \"Ignorance is bliss.\" \n"}, {"text": "The Klingons and the United Federation of Planets are pursuing an end to the cold (and occasionally hot) war that occupied TV and movie viewers for decades. We can't allow that to happen! We've assassinated the Klingon chancellor on his way to peace negotiations, and allowed Captain Kirk to take the blame. The Enterprise crew knows it's a frameup - but there's no way they know this conspiracy includes officers from the highest levels of the Federation, Klingon and Romulan militaries. What movie details their no-doubt futile efforts to thwart our plot?", "correct": "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country", "options": ["Star Trek: Nemesis", "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home", "Star Wars V: The Phantom Menace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.\n\n\tAs explained in this 1991 movie, these peace efforts are inspired by a major disaster: an explosion of a Klingon moon, which both deprives the Klingon Empire of a major energy source and badly affects the environment of the homeworld. The Enterprise is assigned to escort the Klingon chancellor's ship, but soon into the voyage that ship is disabled by torpedoes - which some of the Enterprise's logs insist were fired from the Enterprise - and assassins beam aboard wearing Starfleet uniforms.Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and ship's doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley) are turned over to the Klingons for trial, which might defuse the situation.Luckily, we have an ace up our sleeve: we know the secret location of the rescheduled peace talks, and this time we're going to frame the Klingons for an attack on the Federation president. Even the Enterprise's intrepid crew won't be able to solve the mystery and save their shipmates in time to stop us at the peace conference! \n"}, {"text": "People know I'm a villain, but they just don't take me seriously anymore! The Bank of Evil won't give me a loan, and even my mother thinks I'm a joke. That's all going to change, though: there's no way they know that I have a bold new plan. In fact, I am almost ready to steal the moon! All I need are some cash, my faithful minions, and maybe a couple of intrepid orphan girls to get me a shrink ray. In what movie can you watch my adventures?", "correct": "Despicable Me", "options": ["Austin Powers", "Annie", "Fantastic Voyage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDespicable Me.\n\n\tYes, this 2010 animated picture, in which I'm voiced by Steve Carell, gives you a pretty good idea what I've gone through. No supervillain should have to put up with that kind of disrespect! Even my moon plan proved troublesome - another, better funded villain stole my idea and my shrink ray, my loans dried up, and the orphans seem to think I should be some kind of superdad just because I adopted them. I mean, amusement parks? Bedtime stories about finger-puppet kittens? Ballet recitals? Just what kind of supervillain do they think I am? \n"}, {"text": "Our friend went on a trip without telling her rich husband - so we faked her kidnapping to get some much-needed cash. All right, there have been a couple of glitches. Everyone keeps confusing the rich guy with some slacker who loves bowling, and the suitcase was full of dirty underwear instead of ransom money! But we'll get it all ironed out, and after all, there's no way they know who we are.  In which of these movies will you find our scheme?", "correct": "The Big Lebowski", "options": ["Taken", "Fargo", "Raising Arizona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Big Lebowski.\n\n\tYou might need to watch this 1998 movie a few times to figure out exactly what's going on with the kidnap plot - we sure did! All right, so our plan is complicated, but that's how we know nobody's going to figure it out. We weren't exactly expecting double crosses, triple crosses, stoner philosophy (who knew it was Jeff Bridges' The Dude who was technically the main character?), or quite so many bowling-related fight scenes. Our nihilist ideology will win the day, though - and even if it doesn't, at least folks will have a cult classic to enjoy. \n"}, {"text": "I'm just an innocent art professor, out to learn about the world and serve the common good. At least, that's what I'd like you to think, but actually I work with the Nazis. After Dr. Henry Jones started to suspect me and mysteriously disappeared, I offered my assistance to his son in tracking down one of the greatest relics of Christendom. I'm sure I'll find it, with Indy's help. There's no way he knows who I'll give it to! In which Indiana Jones movie can you find me?", "correct": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", "options": ["Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark", "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", "Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\n\tThis 1989 picture is the third in the franchise about a swashbuckling archaeologist. Everyone says Indiana (Harrison Ford) is terribly smart and resourceful, but you'll see from Alison Doody's portrayal that I'm finding him frightfully easy to manipulate. With the help of his father's notes, I'm sure he'll track down the Holy Grail soon - and then I'll be able to deliver it to the Nazis. Not bad for an art professor, huh? It's true that I've never studied the more advanced archaeological subjects like \"escaping from a collapsing temple,\" but it's not as though I'll need to be able to do that! \n"}, {"text": "It hasn't exactly been a bed of roses since I refused to be the Angel of Death anymore, and my friend and I were kicked out of Heaven. But now we've got a second chance: if we can just pass through the right door of the right New Jersey church on the right day, our sins will automatically be forgiven and we'll have to be admitted back. There's no way they know, and there's no way this could backfire either! What comedy chronicles our plan?", "correct": "Dogma", "options": ["Bruce Almighty", "Keeping the Faith", "Saved!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDogma.\n\n\tWhen Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and I (Matt Damon) first had this idea in this 1999 Kevin Smith movie, we didn't see the catch: if we return to Heaven after having been banished by God, the paradox could destroy all creation! Bartleby is still anxious to go forward, but I think this is going to take some more thought. Luckily, I've got time - it isn't as though a motley crew headed by Linda Fiorentino is trying to stop us. \n"}, {"text": "In college, my buddy Martin and I were computer hackers, before computer hacking was cool. I was arrested and he's been on the run ever since. Now he thinks I'm dead, but I'm free, rich, and well connected to organized crime. Now I have a plan to destroy the world economy, and Martin and his team can get me the codebreaker box that'll let me do it. There's no way they know that the NSA agents asking for his help are really on my payroll! In which movie can you see the way I manipulate them?", "correct": "Sneakers", "options": ["Swordfish", "WarGames", "The Net"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSneakers.\n\n\tI'm played by Ben Kingsley in this 1992 caper film, and he comes close to capturing my gravitas. Robert Redford's Martin is so very gullible, though - not that I can blame him, given the cleverness of my plan! The filmmakers follow the heists of Martin and his crew, as they work to steal the box from the mathematician who built it. I suppose that, if they ever find out I'm behind it all, they might try to steal it from me, too - but my plan has so many layers, there's no way I can fail. \n"}, {"text": "Harry Potter thinks I'm on his side - that I'm a grizzled former Auror whose main concern is teaching him Defense Against the Dark Arts. I do some of that, of course, but I'm not really Mad-Eye Moody, and my job here is simple: to get the boy to the last task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, so he can be kidnapped for the ritual that will restore the Dark Lord to his powers. Harry, his friends, even the headmaster - there's no way they know who I really am. In which of the \"Harry Potter\" movies can you be amazed by my powers of deception?", "correct": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", "options": ["Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\n\n\tI, Barty Crouch Jr. - the Dark Lord's most faithful servant outside of Azkaban - am faithfully playing Mad-Eye Moody for a whole school year. Even so, it may be that Brendan Gleeson got the harder job: in this 2005 picture, he had to play me playing Mad-Eye! No part of my task has been simple. I have to keep the real Mad-Eye locked and hidden away; I have to brew disgusting Polyjuice potion (stealing the ingredients) and drink it every hour to maintain my disguise; and worst of all, I have to pretend to love Harry Potter and hate the Dark Lord.It was worth it, though, just to see the look on the boy's face when the Goblet of Fire spat out his name as a contestant in the Tournament (acting on my instructions, of course). And when I deliver him to the Dark Lord - well, imagining that moment is so sweet I'd do this for a hundred school years, if that was what it was going to take.\n"}, {"text": "They know I'm obsessed with gold. They know that I have a plan targeting Fort Knox. But there's no way they know that I'm not scheming to steal the gold at all - I just need to take it out of commission for a while. Which \"Bond\" villain am I?", "correct": "Goldfinger", "options": ["Goldeneye", "Max Zorin", "The Man with the Golden Gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoldfinger.\n\n\tYes, I'm Auric Goldfinger, and \"Goldfinger\" is the name of the 1964 \"Bond\" movie where you can see Gert Fr\u00f6be's interpretation of me. Sean Connery's James Bond first gets onto my trail in an effort to stop my gold smuggling, but there's so very much more at stake. If I can get that atomic bomb into place, all Fort Knox's gold supply will be too radioactive to use - and, for the next couple of generations, the value of my supply will be sky-high.Even if the world is no longer on a gold standard, my plan is unstoppable! And if Bond gets too close, I'm confident my assistant Oddjob (Harold Sakata) will find some creative way of finishing him off. \n"}]}
