But I'll confess...I'm not sure who the ladies are! I'm afraid that when I was a caterpillar, my parents didn't offer such instruction. How do I tell the difference without asking them?\nSigned,\nConfused in Coccoonville", "correct": "Dear Confused: Look at their antennae, not their thorax! A good whiff of their perfume helps too.", "options": ["Dear Confused: Well, usually the ladies like to dress in finer wear than the men- plus there's a certain gleam in their eyes!", "Dear Confused: I'm afraid to tell you this...but there are no female moths.", "Dear Confused: Check out their shapely legs, and see if they stick their tongues out at you."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDear Confused: Look at their antennae, not their thorax! A good whiff of their perfume helps too.\n\n\tYou see, Confused, those female moths prefer a simple hairdo. While your antennae are big and bushy (the better to catch a whiff of their special perfume- sometimes you can smell it from miles away!) theirs are smooth. Good luck with the girls from now on! \n"}, {"text": "Dear Agnes,\nI am writing you all the way from Australia, looking for some tips on interior design. I'm a bowerbird, you see, and I've built what I consider to be a fantastic pad. But all the girls are ignoring me. It must be my decor.

I want to hear the sound of little fins in my ocean space! But when I look around me, all I see are other female groupers with the same aim. And there are just no eligible males in sight. What do I do? I'm not getting any younger!\nSigned,\nGuy Grouper Groupie", "correct": "Dear Groupie, You can become a parent- just become male!", "options": ["Dear Groupie, Try some scented cologne to attract the big boys.", "Dear Groupie, Didn't you know that you don't need a guy to have some fishlets?", "Dear Groupie, You'll just need to prepare yourself for a long migration."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDear Groupie, You can become a parent- just become male!.\n\n\tYou sound like you're one of the big fish in the pond, Groupie. And you have lots of female company. So why not do what comes naturally to your kind- just turn into a male! Most groupers do this when they get a bit old and there aren't any eligible bachelors around. \n"}, {"text": "Dear Agnes,\nI'm one pooped phalarope. My wife dresses much fancier than I do. She often leaves me at home to care for the eggs while she has a night on the town...and I think it might be with other guys! I am becoming the laughingstock of shorebird society. What do I do?\nSigned,\nHenpecked", "correct": "Dear Henpecked, Sorry to tell you this, but that's just life for phalaropes.", "options": ["Dear Henpecked, Don't you think that it's time that you went out and got a harem of your own?", "Dear Henpecked, Are you sure she's a she?", "Dear Henpecked, Don't worry, she's really faithful only to you."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDear Henpecked, Sorry to tell you this, but that's just life for phalaropes.\n\n\tMr. Hen, I am afraid you are one of nature's anomalies. Your wife is bigger and brighter than you, and likes to chase the guys around. I have even worse news- pretty soon she's going to migrate south for the winter, and leave you to care for your chicks- alone. That's the way it is for your species. Blame Darwin. \n"}, {"text": "Dear Agnes,\nHow does a nice earthworm meet another of the opposite sex?\nSigned,\nFishin' For Mates", "correct": "Dear Fishin', Stop lookin' for the opposite sex...because there aren't any!", "options": ["Dear Fishin', Try hanging out in the best pile of rotten leaves that you can find.", "Dear Fishin', The ladies are lighter, and a bit slimier too!", "Dear Fishin', Look for a worm with fewer segments than you- that's the one!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDear Fishin', Stop lookin' for the opposite sex...because there aren't any!\n\n\tYou see, Fishin'- you are a hermaphrodite!

They don't want to get the big guys riled up either, though. So if you just pick a nice little bachelor pad behind a rock, they'll come to you! Scientists call your kind \"sneaker males\"- and it isn't because of your footwear! \n"}, {"text": "Dear Agnes,\nI'm a blue whale expecting a blessed event.

You and your partner both make those darts from calcium in your bodies, then coat them with a special chemical. That chemical prevents your partner from digesting your sperm. Without it, 99.98% of your sperm would become food rather than baby snails! \n"}, {"text": "Dear Agnes,\nI think I'm a pretty handsome wolf spider, and I know a nice girl who lives under a branch up the street.
