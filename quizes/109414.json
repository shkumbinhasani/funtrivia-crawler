Seurat and Paul Signac were the most famous practitioners of scientific Pointillism (which they termed 'Divisionism'), though technically the Impressionists used the technique prior to these two.  The term 'Pointillism' was coined by F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on, an art critic. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following items is associated with the creation of 'plaster of Paris', often used in sculpture?  \n", "correct": "Gypsum", "options": ["Bitumen", "Talc", "Limestone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGypsum.\n\n\tGypsum is a hydrous calcium sulfate that forms the base for plaster of Paris.
