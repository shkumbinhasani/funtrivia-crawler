{"id": "18512", "name": "Hard Mythological Mothers Quiz / Test | Greek Myth | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Greek Myth", "Women and Goddesses"], "questions": [{"text": "What Titan was the mother of Artemis and Apollo?", "correct": "Leto", "options": ["Rhea", "Silvia", "Eurydice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeto.\n\n\tHera was so angry with her that she forbade all the lands of the earth to give her shelter. Finally, poor Leto was able to give birth on the floating island of Delos. The results: the goddess of the moon and hunt and the god of light and music. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the mother of Hephaestus?", "correct": "Hera", "options": ["Aphrodite", "Demeter", "Europa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHera.\n\n\tHephaistos is the god of forges and metalcraft. \n"}, {"text": "What mortal was the mother of Dionysus?", "correct": "Semele", "options": ["Io", "Europa", "Hero"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSemele.\n\n\tDionysus, god of wine and revelry, was actually born from Zeus's leg, as Semele had turned to ash before giving birth. Being a Greek mythological character is so complicated! \n"}, {"text": "And which woman conceived Athena?", "correct": "Metis", "options": ["Eurydice", "Hero", "Zeusina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMetis.\n\n\tAthena, goddess of wisdom, sprang full-grown from Zeus's head. This made some sense as Metis had, while pregnant, changed into a fly and been swallowed by Zeus, so it was only natural that the child should be born from his head. Okay, so maybe it doesn't make sense, but that's the way the story is told. \n"}, {"text": "Who was mother of Hermes, mischievous messenger god?", "correct": "Maia", "options": ["Thetis", "Eurydice", "Io"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaia.\n\n\tMaia was one of the Pleiades, and Hermes was a precocious child: when he was less than a day old he stole Apollo's cattle and got away with it. \n"}, {"text": "Who bore Heracles, the famous hero?", "correct": "Alcmene", "options": ["Leto", "Europa", "Leda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlcmene.\n\n\tZeus had disguised himself as Alcmene's husband, away at war. Zeus was a notorious cheat at the game of love. \n"}, {"text": "And who was the mother of Clytemnestra and Helen of Troy?", "correct": "Leda", "options": ["Europa", "Alcmene", "Metis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeda.\n\n\tOn this occasion, Zeus transformed himself into a swan. \n"}, {"text": "Who bore the hero Perseus, slayer of Medusa and rescuer of Andromeda?", "correct": "Danae", "options": ["Demeter", "Daphne", "Alcmene"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDanae.\n\n\tDanae's father had heard his grandson would kill him, so he had her shut up inside four walls. There was no roof, however, and it was through that gap that Zeus descended as a shower of gold. \n"}, {"text": "Zeus changed Ceroessa's mother into a cow in order to shield her from a jealous Hera - but his plan backfired. Who was she?", "correct": "Io", "options": ["Leda", "Mnemosyne", "Danae"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIo.\n\n\tHera, who knew her husband well, was suspicious of the cow's loveliness and demanded it as a gift.
