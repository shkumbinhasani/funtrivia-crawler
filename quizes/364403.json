What official item was this?", "correct": "The clothing ration book", "options": ["The beer ration card", "The national identity card", "The food ration book"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe clothing ration book.\n\n\tOn the 29th of September 1939, shortly after the outbreak of war, the United Kingdom carried out a national registration day in which every household was required to provide the details of those at the address for rationing purposes.  Petrol began to be rationed almost immediately with the rationing of most other goods, beginning with bacon, butter and sugar, following in January 1940; other types of meat became rationed during March that year. The rationing of clothing began on the 1st of June 1941 and ended, almost eight years later, on the 15th of March 1949, just a few months before filming of 'Passport to Pimlico' began. Rationing ended officially in the United Kingdom on the 4th of July 1954.  The dedication in the opening credits takes the form of an evergreen wreath interspersed with lilies encompassing a small selection of these clothing ration books. \n"}, {"text": "From listening to the two Royal Engineer Bomb Disposal NCOs, we learn that the local population have given the last unexploded German bomb in London a name, a female name.  With what name had this bomb been christened?", "correct": "Pamela", "options": ["Robin", "Francis", "Beverly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPamela.\n\n\tThe NCO's are digging a pit around the bomb known locally as Pamela when Benny the paperboy throws a copy of the daily down to them.  One of the soldiers picks it up and reads the headline:\r\"Phew! Ninety four degrees on the Air Ministry roof!\"\r\"Right, I'll keep off it\" his comrade replies and asks \"Any more about us in there?\"\r\"Here...  It is now believed that Pamela, the last unexploded bomb in the London area, will be removed from Miramont Place, Pimlico on Tuesday next.  The soldiers' O.C., or Officer Commanding, arrives with the news that Pamela is not going to be removed but will blown up in situ and that this was to take place the following day. \n"}, {"text": "What incident resulted in the discovery of the underground cellar that contained the documents that laid claim to the borough of Pimlico?", "correct": "The detonation of a bomb", "options": ["Collapsing sewer pipes", "Rebuilding work ", "Tunnelling "], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe detonation of a bomb.\n\n\tWhilst attending a council meeting, Arthur Pemberton stands at a window in the chambers and watches some children playing on the bomb site outside.  Realising that the large cable drum that they are rolling is about to fall into the pit containing the unexploded bomb that the soldiers were working in earlier that day, Pemberton takes cover just as the bomb is detonated; the explosion attracts many people from all over the area.Predictably, when the local police constable arrives, the children all blame one another for setting off the bomb!  Pemberton moves closer to the edge of the crater and, losing his footing, he slips down into the very deep hole. \n"}, {"text": "Whilst at the bottom of the crater, Pemberton receives a knock on the head from falling rocks and believes he is dreaming when he sees the opening into what appears to be a small cellar filled with glistening objects.  What occurrence, later that evening, convinces him that what he saw was real?", "correct": "A gold coin falls from his shirt collar.", "options": ["He finds a piece of parchment stuck to his shoe.", "A youth finds a golden candlestick and takes it to him.", "His daughter tells him that she also saw the treasure."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA gold coin falls from his shirt collar.\n\n\tIt is while Arthur is being nursed after his fall that he tells his wife and his daughter what he thought he saw while he was in the crater. \r\"I thought I was seeing things again\" Arthur tells his wife.\r\"Seeing things?\" she replied,\r\"Yes, when all that stuff fell on my head I fancied I saw a kind of cave with a load of treasure in it; goblets, jewels, gold coins\"\rHe then reaches back to clear some debris from around his neck when the gold coin falls and rolls across his parlour floor.  Excitedly Arthur tells his daughter Shirley to fetch a couple of torches whilst he finds a ladder and they both race back to the crater.  They both descend into the crater and discover the hidden cache of treasure. \n"}, {"text": "Which old European province was proved able to lay claim to Pimlico through a document recovered from the hidden cache and which had been translated by Professor Hatton-Jones of London University?", "correct": "Burgundy", "options": ["Prussia", "Monaco", "Aquitaine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurgundy.\n\n\tAccording to research carried out by the somewhat eccentric Professor Hatton-Jones, played by the great Margaret Rutherford, the recovered documents prove that Charles VII 'The Rash', Duke of Burgundy, had settled in the area now known as Pimlico as a certain Maurice de Charolais, and had the area ceded to him by King Edward IV.  According to these documents, presented as evidence by Hatton-Jones in the coroner's court, Pimlico was still a possession of the Duke of Burgundy, is foreign soil and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the British government.  After carefully considering the evidence, His Majesty's Coroner declared that the treasure was the sole property of the inhabitants of Pimlico:\r\"Are you implying that this treasure does not belong to the crown?\" the coroner asks Hatton-Jones.\r\"Oh no, it belongs to the people of the area covered by the old estate\" stated Hatton-Jones, continuing \"Since this charter specifically makes them natives of Burgundy!\"\r\"You mean that these Londoners are technically Burgundians?\" the coroner asks incredulously; \"Indubitably!\" replies Hatton-Jones as the courtroom erupts and the local constable utters the line, \"Blimey!  I'm a foreigner\". \n"}, {"text": "Due to a constitutional issue, the British government refused to negotiate with the representatives appointed to the State Council because it was required, under law, that they could only be appointed by the British monarch?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tA small number of Pimlico's residents, led by Arthur Pemberton, form a committee and decide to sell the land back to the British government. The British are convinced that, due to a \"rather obtuse constitutional issue\" that had arisen, they were not bound to negotiate with the Burgundians; any representation could only be appointed by the Duke or his heirs and, as the Burgundian royal line was supposedly extinct, Pemberton's small cohort were not considered to be legitimate representation for Pimlico's residents.  Later that evening, the arrival of the handsome Frenchman S\u00e9bastian de Charolais Duke of Burgundy, played by Paul Dupuis, seems to be the answer to their prayers...once his evidence and credentials have been checked, of course!\r\"Forgive me.  Are you a bleeder?\" asks Professor Hatton-Jones on her first meeting with S\u00e9bastian de Charolais.  \r\"I beg your pardon?\" he asks in return.\r\"Do you suffer from haemophilia?  When you cut yourself do you bleed interminably?\" Hatton-Jones replies.  \r\"No...I don't think so\" says S\u00e9bastian\r\"Pity, it's in the family; definitely in the family\" remarks a slightly disappointed Hatton-Jones. \n"}, {"text": "Within a very short time the British government sets up border controls between Pimlico and the United Kingdom.  In response, the residents insist on applying visa rules and customs checks for tourists; in fact, for anyone passing through Pimlico.  Where do these border controls first take place?", "correct": "The London Underground", "options": ["Madame Tussaud's", "The London Dungeon", "Portobello Road market"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe London Underground.\n\n\tThe government ramp up the pressure on the inhabitants of Miramont Place.  Cut to a scene inside a carriage on the London Underground and an exchange with a local government minister and Professor Hatton-Jones; \r\"Good evening Professor\"\r\"Oh, good evening\"\r\"Your friends in Miramont Place have got themselves into a right mess\"\r\"Poor souls; the innocent victims of destiny!\" retorted the professor.\r\"They started all this nonsense, now they have to put up with the consequences\"\rMoments later the underground carriage screeches to a sudden halt and the occupants fall over each other; the carriage doors open;\r\"All passports; passports ready please!\" shouts PC Spiller.\r\"All hand luggage open please!\" cries Mr Pemberton.\r\"Kindly make your currency declarations please!\" requests the bank manager, Mr Wix.\r\"Ah, the fighting people Mr Basset.  Worthy successors to the Knights of the Golden Fleece!\" cries a delighted Professor Hatton-Jones. \n"}, {"text": "After a late night incursion into the area surrounding Miramont Place, PC Spiller turns on a water hydrant in order to fill a large storage pit that the residents had excavated.  Unfortunately, as the water supply returns something happens that threatens their very future.  What is this catastrophic event?", "correct": "The state food supply is destroyed by a flood.", "options": ["The carcass of a dog is found in the water supply.", "The water is used to put out a fire at Pemberton's store.", "The water quickly seeps away through cracks."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe state food supply is destroyed by a flood.\n\n\tUnbeknown to the Food Minister, Miss Molly Read, a tap that had been left turned on upstairs in the pub as the water supply had been cut off has caused a flood when the water supply is temporarily restored.  As the resident's remaining food stocks had been stored for safe-keeping in the cellar of the local pub, the flood is disastrous in that it has destroyed all that was left!\r \"Four tins, that's all that's left; everything else has had it\" cries poor Molly,\r\"We've all had it this time\" says a dejected Pemberton. \n"}, {"text": "As the government blockade takes hold, supplies begin to be dropped into Pimlico from the air.   What is the first type of aircraft that we see delivering supplies to the residents of Miramont Place?", "correct": "A helicopter", "options": ["A military glider", "A Lancaster bomber", "A small passenger aircraft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA helicopter.\n\n\tAfter reaching a desperate situation the residents of Miramont Place decide to surrender.  Just as they are preparing to leave some children begin to throw sweets to them across the wire barricades.  Encouraged by this, others begin to throw more substantial food items to the inhabitants, acts of kindness which escalate over a very short period of time. In scenes reminiscent of the Berlin Airlift, an event that was taking place whilst filming was in progress, food and other goods pour in, with the first aircraft to break the blockade, a helicopter, delivering a consignment of fresh milk.  The Burgundians find themselves, once again, in a strong enough position to demand a re-negotiation of terms with the British government; but the stalemate continues and it appears that the main stumbling block to an agreement is the horde of treasure that the Burgundians possess.\n"}, {"text": "Finally, the residents and the British government enter into an agreement that is beneficial to all; the treasure will be sold to the UK government and Pimlico will merge once again to become a part of England.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMr Wix, the Burgundian Chancellor, finally proposes that their treasure is loaned to the British government with the condition that any interest on the loan is to be paid to and is for, the sole benefit of the residents of Pimlico.  The British government agrees to this proposal and consequently the blockade is lifted and the Burgundians announce that they are, once more, a part of the United Kingdom; with this the film closes with a street party being held in a heavy rainstorm and, as the camera's picture fades, it closes in on a thermometer showing the temperature dropping very rapidly to freezing, in much the same way as it would during any other British summer! \n"}]}
