Kimble replies, 'Put it in.  Paper's paper.'  Kimble wins with a full house over BJ's trio of eights. \n"}, {"text": "Following the game, Kimble discusses with BJ and Hawkeye a little 'medical problem' he has.  It seems that he can't fly because of an ear disfunction, but the doctors soon discover that Kimble's problem is unrelated to his physical well-being.  The Sergeant admits to having about a ton of army supplies he is carrying back with him so that he can open his own restaurant.  What is the name of the restaurant he plans to open?

In order to get on the ship, he must acquire three doctors' signatures for his imaginary 'ear ailment', which would mean a signature from Frank as well (good luck!)  \r Kimble points out how clever his restaurant's name is with the 'three K's'.  Hawkeye responds, 'You can buy your linen from the Ku Klux Klan'. \n"}, {"text": "The following morning we see Radar and Klinger taking a shower (really, Radar does take showers now and then!)

After Chivers delivers the two bottles of Scotch, they are both lost to the sniper (obviously, his brigade didn't do its job!) \n"}, {"text": "Another man with a medical problem, this time a tank commander named Colonel Griswald.  Does Colonel Griswald ever mention specifically what his ailment is?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNo, and for good reason.  The Colonel has an STD (sexually transmitted disease) and doesn't care to announce it to the entire camp, let alone to the doctors.  Griswald describes it as a 'delicate problem', and that there would be 'certain ramifications if [he] checked into a base hospital'.  Though he doesn't exactly spell it out, Hawkeye knows his meaning precisely.  A penicillin shot is pending... \n"}, {"text": "While Hawkeye attends to the Colonel, BJ approaches Sergeant Kimble with a possible deal that would allow the latter to return to the United States on a boat.
