{"id": "139530", "name": "Braided Rugs from Cotton T-Shirts Quiz | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "  Needlework"], "questions": [{"text": "In the nineteenth century, braided rugs were often made from _______.", "correct": "wool", "options": ["cotton T-shirts", "corduroy", "silk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwool.\n\n\tPioneer women used strips of leftover wool. You can still buy braided wool rugs from businesses such as L.L. Bean. \n"}, {"text": "Why might cotton T-shirts make good rug-making materials? ", "correct": "All of these are good reasons.", "options": ["Cotton isn't as scratchy as wool.", "The resulting rug is machine washable.", "T-shirts are cheap in used-clothing stores."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these are good reasons.\n\n\tAlso, if you cut a strip of T-shirt about 1 1/4 inches wide and stretch it, its edges curl under and form a nice thin rope that's easy to braid. \n"}, {"text": "Wool doesn't come in rich colors like cotton T-shirts do.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNo, actually, wool comes in very deep, rich colors. And it doesn't seem to fade as fast as cotton does. (So that's not one of the reasons for choosing cotton over wool.) \n"}, {"text": "What's the hardest part of making a rug from cotton T-shirts?", "correct": "getting the rug to lie flat", "options": ["cutting T-shirts into strips", "stretching T-shirt strips so they form \"ropes\"", "braiding the \"ropes\" made from T-shirt strips"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngetting the rug to lie flat.\n\n\tIt took me a few rugs before I figured out how to get a round rug to lie flat. An oval rug is easier to flatten out. \n"}, {"text": "True or false? Sewing the braids together with tiny stitches takes less time than lacing them together.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBefore I learned how to lace (kind of like lacing up a tennis shoe), I sewed a couple of braided rugs--man, did that take a long time! \n"}, {"text": "When choosing T-shirts for your rug, which type should you avoid?", "correct": "T-shirts with writing or pictures", "options": ["all-cotton T-shirts", "striped T-shirts", "black, purple, or red T-shirts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nT-shirts with writing or pictures.\n\n\tYou can't use the parts with writing or pictures because that plastic or rubber ink used to create decorations interferes when you stretch the cloth strips to make them roll up. \n"}, {"text": "If you don't practice good posture while you make braided rugs for hours on end, you can develop RSI. This stands for _______?", "correct": "repetitive strain injuries", "options": ["rapid sentient injuries", "retroactive sitting injuries", "relatively stressful injuries"], "explanation": "\n\n\nrepetitive strain injuries.\n\n\tYou can get RSI from too much typing, too! Take breaks, stretch, drink plenty of water, and exercise, and you will probably escape this kind of injury. \n"}, {"text": "True or false? Four is the ideal number of colors to include in a braided rug.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNah--there is no ideal number. However, if you use, say, magenta, orange, green, and yellow (M, O, G, Y), you can make a ring of MOG, then one of MOY, then one of YOG, then one of MYG, and so on. \n"}, {"text": "True or false? A braided rug is the same as a hooked rug.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNope. Hooked rugs have individual strands of wool that stick up like grass in a lawn (as do machine-made shag rugs) and braided rugs lie flat on the floor. \n"}, {"text": "True or false? Worn-out polo shirts make good materials for cotton braided rugs. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNo, polo shirts are made of double-knit or pique cotton. This fabric doesn't roll up when you stretch it, so you can't make \"ropes\" for braiding. The ideal kind of T-shirt for the job is a 100 percent cotton Fruit of the Loom \"Hefty T.\" For pattern ideas, look at rugs in the L.L. Bean catalogue. Happy braiding! \n"}]}
