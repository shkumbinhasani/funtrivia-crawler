Cooking quizzes go to Hobbies; fictitious animal stories belong in Literature (if adult books) or For Children (if on children's stories); \"Lassie\" quizzes belong in Television; and 'Cats' quizzes belong in Humanities. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is an acceptable question on an Animals quiz?", "correct": "What breed of dog is nicknamed \"The Grey Ghost\"?", "options": ["Can dogs be trained to do tricks?", "What is the name of my dog?", "What is the best breed of dog for kids?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhat breed of dog is nicknamed \"The Grey Ghost\"?.\n\n\tPersonal questions, personal opinion questions, and overly simple questions are not appropriate for this category. \n"}, {"text": "When researching your quiz, verifying your information on one web site is always sufficient.", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tPlease verify your information with several reputable sources! There are many inaccuracies on websites.
