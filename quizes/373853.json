{"id": "373853", "name": "Brain Drain Quiz | Diseases | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Diseases", "Neurological Disorders"], "questions": [{"text": "Which condition, normally diagnosed in childhood, is characterized by problems with communication and relating to other people and the sufferer's surroundings, but can present in a wide array of symptoms across a spectrum?\n", "correct": "Autism", "options": ["Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis", "Apraxia", "Attention Deficit Disorder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAutism.\n\n\tA study, done by AutismSpeaks.org, states that about 1 in 62 children worldwide are affected by some form of the disorder.\r Early ways to identify the spectrum in children is to look at how they interact with other humans. A typical child will respond well to outside stimuli and interact with others as it develops. A typical autistic child tends to prefer to be alone, and doesn't interact with children or adults as easily as their peers.\r While there are some studies that show autism to be a genetic condition, and others that show it to be an environmentally caused one, the definitive answer eluded researchers in the field into the early 21st century. \n"}, {"text": "Which genetic neurological illness, named for its discoverers, normally leads to death by the age of four?\n", "correct": "Tay-Sachs Disease", "options": ["Higgs-Boson Syndrome", "Xavier's Disease", "Albright-Rice Disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTay-Sachs Disease.\n\n\tAccording to the National Institute of Health, Tay-Sachs Disease patients rarely live past age four.\r This disease causes infants to go blind, become deaf and stop being able to swallow within months of being born.\r The disease doesn't show signs of being present for the first few months of life, but once it's known, the mental and physical abilities of the child decline rapidly. Eventually full paralysis sets in, and the child typically dies within months of diagnosis. \n"}, {"text": "A form of dementia, this disease typically presents in the elderly. It inhibits the patient from being able to remember friends and family, and causes other types of forgetfulness as well. What disease have I just described?", "correct": "Alzheimer's Disease", "options": ["Multiple Personality Disorder", "Paget's Disease", "Attention Deficit Disorder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlzheimer's Disease.\n\n\tAlzheimer's Disease doesn't usually show up until a patient is in their 60s, though it has been known to develop earlier in extreme cases.\r Patients with the disease eventually must be under total care because they may wander and forget where they live. Early on with the disease patients forget things like how to brush their teeth, or comb their hair, or even to eat and drink.\r The disease is more likely to be diagnosed in a person with a family history of it, but people with no family history of it can also suffer from it. \n"}, {"text": "Which disease causes the patient to have extreme pain, more than would normally result from minor injuries, so severe that it often spreads to other areas of the body, and can be debilitating?", "correct": "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome", "options": ["Crohn's Syndrome", "Protogenesis", "Celiac's Disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComplex Regional Pain Syndrome.\n\n\tComplex Regional Pain Syndrome causes a dramatic increase in the patient's pain receptors.\r Small cuts or scrapes cause intense pain to an entire hand, foot, leg or arm and often take hours, or even days, to dissipate.\r CRPS patients often present discolored skin and an increase in temperature in the affected areas. \r The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke lists the only treatment for the disease to be pain medication and anesthetics to dull the pain. \n"}, {"text": "While it affects the cerebellum, the portion of the brain that controls movement, this disease won't turn its sufferers into zombies. What disease can be controlled completely when treated properly?", "correct": "Dandy-Walker Syndrome", "options": ["Epilepsy", "Raynaud's Disease", "Frigg's Disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDandy-Walker Syndrome.\n\n\tDandy-Walker Syndrome typically causes many symptoms, all of which can be treated on their own, but a cure still eluded doctors and researchers in the early part of the 21st century.\r One treatment that can be effective is to put a shunt in the brain that allows excess fluid to drain out of the cavity, relieving stress and lessening symptoms. \n"}, {"text": "This learning disability causes patients to get words mixed up. What problem presents these symptoms? ", "correct": "Dyslexia", "options": ["Vice Versa Syndrome", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Dyspraxia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDyslexia.\n\n\t'The problems of dyslexia can range from minor problems with reading to a total inability to comprehend the written word. Some people are able to read slowly, and manage to understand the written word. Others have cases so extreme they are never able to fully overcome the condition.\r The disease affects the brain of each patient differently. Dyslexia is often discovered early in life, and can be generally overcome through remedial programs in school. \n"}, {"text": "Which condition presents itself through seizures, which can be controlled by medication for the majority of sufferers?", "correct": "Epilepsy", "options": ["Adamantium", "Protogenesis", "Xavier's Disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEpilepsy.\n\n\tEpilepsy, once diagnosed, can be mitigated through diet, medicine and surgical techniques in the vast majority of patients.\r The full spectrum of the disorder ranges from the occasional seizure to very frequent and life-threatening seizures depending on the severity of the condition. This is caused by a disruption of the normal neuronal pattern of the brain. \n"}, {"text": "Commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, this condition affects the entire body over time. What condition was the famous baseball slugger diagnosed with cutting his career short?", "correct": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "options": ["Pine Tar Disease", "Huntington's Disease", "Crohn's Syndrome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.\n\n\tALS patients suffer from muscle atrophy and overall weakness. The disease typically affects one part of the body to start with and slowly spreads to the entire body.\r Professor Stephen Hawking was another famous person to suffer from the disease that bears the name of the Major League Baseball legend.\r The causes of the disease is still eluding doctors and researchers alike in the early 21st century. \n"}, {"text": "Which disease, brought on by a reduction in the dopamine-producing brain cells, caused Michael J. Fox to semi-retire from acting after he was diagnosed with it?", "correct": "Parkinson's Disease", "options": ["Huntington's Syndrome", "Elephantiasis", "Vader's Faux Disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParkinson's Disease.\n\n\tAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders, the four primary symptoms of the disease are tremors, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and body, bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance and coordination. \n"}, {"text": "Characterized by repetitive and involuntary movements and vocalizations, which disease is almost always diagnosed when a person is in early childhood?", "correct": "Tourette's Syndrome", "options": ["Munchausen Syndrome", "Smith-Mewes Syndrome", "Waxon-Miagi Disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTourette's Syndrome.\n\n\tOther than presenting with the \"tics\" or movements and vocalizations mentioned in the question, patients with Tourette's Syndrome don't require medicine for the condition.\r In all but the rarest cases the \"tics\" present no impairment. For the patients with these extreme cases, there is medication that helps quell the symptoms. \n"}]}
