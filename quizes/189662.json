{"id": "189662", "name": "Top 10 Sci-Fi Films Quiz / Test | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Sci-Fi Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Coming in at #10 was 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', an extraordinary tale of unearthly visitors and the unusual effects they have on ordinary earthlings.  Who directed this popular sci-fi extravaganza?", "correct": "Steven Spielberg", "options": ["George Lucas", "Stanley Kubrick", "Milos Forman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteven Spielberg.\n\n\t'Close Encounters' has it all: cute aliens with enormous heads, gigantic spaceships emitting rhythmic colors and sounds, and mashed potato sculpting.  Featuring the acting of Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr and, interestingly, French new-wave director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, this film leaves the audience wondering, are we truly alone? \n"}, {"text": "At #9 on the list is 'The Matrix', a 1999 brain-in-the-box, sci-fi thriller that starred all but which of the following actors?", "correct": "Guy Pearce", "options": ["Keanu Reeves", "Carrie-Anne Moss", "Laurence Fishburne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuy Pearce.\n\n\tAlso featuring Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano, 'The Matrix' inspired its audience to question 'What is real?'.  Director/brothers Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski went on to direct two sequels to 'The Matrix', both of which elaborated on their vision of a world beleaguered by a war between human beings and machines. \n"}, {"text": "Arriving at #8 on the list was the 1953 classic 'The War of the Worlds'.  Though the special effects featured in this film are now well-outdated, it nonetheless captured well the mood set in the original novel that was written by whom?", "correct": "H. G. Wells", "options": ["Jules Verne", "Arthur C. Clarke", "Isaac Asimov"], "explanation": "\n\n\nH. G. Wells\n\n\tH. G. Wells' classic tale of an Earth invasion by the ever insidious forces of Mars was first made into a radio play by Orson Welles in 1938 (Halloween night) before being brought to the silver screen in 1953 by director Byron Haskin (Welles would have nothing to do with the movie version).  The story also inspired Tim Burton's 1996 film 'Mars Attacks!', an obvious send-up of this 1953 classic, not to mention that other 1996 blockbuster 'Independence Day'. \n"}, {"text": "#7 on this top ten list is a wonderful 1951 sci-fi, adventure film that is part thriller, part moral play, namely 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'.  What is the name of the alien being in this film?", "correct": "Klaatu", "options": ["Nikto", "Verata", "Accabwehc"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlaatu.\n\n\tMichael Rennie portrays Klaatu, an alien being who has been dispatched to Earth to warn the people of this planet to cease their warlike activities or be destroyed.  The film relies almost entirely on dramatic dialogue and the ominous presence of a metallic robot for its suspenseful mood, and largely dispatches with the need for special effects.  Thanks to the expert directing of Robert Wise, the audience is effectively thrilled and entertained until the very end. \n"}, {"text": "Listed at #6 on the top ten list is the combination of the first two 'Terminator' films.  In these films, cybernetic organisms called terminators travel to the past in order to kill a woman and her son.  What is the last name of this mother/son pair?", "correct": "Connor", "options": ["Davis", "Phillips", "Anderson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConnor.\n\n\tSarah and John Connor are the targets of the terminators in the first and second films, respectively.  In the first film, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the evil terminator, intent on eliminating Sarah Connor, a woman who will give birth to John Connor, leader of a future rebel movement.  In the second film, Schwarzenegger returns as terminator programmed to protect the pre-adolescent John Connor against another, more powerful cyborg.  Like 'The Matrix', these films deal with the popular theme of 'man vs. machine'. \n"}, {"text": "We now reach the top five!  Which 1972 film, which was remade in a 2002 version starring George Clooney, and which was based on a novel by Stanislaw Lem, occupies the #5 position on the list?", "correct": "Solaris", "options": ["Soylent Green", "The Andromeda Strain", "Day of the Triffids"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSolaris.\n\n\tBased on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, 1972's 'Solaris' was directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and is the only non-English language film on the list.  The story in 'Solaris' revolves around a psychologist who has gone into space to investigate some mysterious occurrences aboard a space station.  When this psychologist suddenly encounters his dead wife aboard said space station, the mystery truly begins! \n"}, {"text": "Coming aboard at #4 we have the 1979 classic sci-fi film 'Alien'.  Which actress is featured among the cast of this gruesome tale of outer space encounters with a malevolent alien race?", "correct": "Sigourney Weaver", "options": ["Glenn Close", "Jessica Lange", "Geena Davis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSigourney Weaver.\n\n\tSigourney Weaver is among a cast which also includes Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto.  Directed by horror/sci-fi master Ridley Scott, 'Alien' was partially hyped by the fitting tagline 'In space no one can hear you scream'. \n"}, {"text": "Down to the nitty-gritty we come.  At #3 in our countdown we have another classic sci-fi series, this time the original 'Star Wars' and its sequel 'The Empire Strikes Back'.  This question should not be difficult for true fans of the series: Which of these characters only appears in one of the first two films?", "correct": "Lando Calrissian", "options": ["C-3PO", "Obi-Wan Kenobi", "Chewbacca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLando Calrissian.\n\n\tI realize that this was something of a trick question, as Obi-Wan 'died' in the first film, but his character does indeed rise from the dead in 'The Empire Strikes Back'.  Lando, however, is first introduced in the second film and does not appear in the original 'Star Wars'.  \r Notice that 'Return of the Jedi' is not listed?  Neither are the later entries in the 'Star Wars' series for, I believe, very fitting reasons which I shall not bother to discuss! \n"}, {"text": "The #2 movie on this list is one of the most beautiful films ever produced, namely '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  What is the name of the main character in this lovely film, portrayed by Keir Dullea? ", "correct": "Dr. Dave Bowman", "options": ["Dr. Bill Michaels", "Dr. Frank Poole", "Dr. Rolf Halvorsen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Dave Bowman\n\n\tHopefully the quote, 'I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that' came to mind when you were considering the answer to this question.  In another example of 'man vs. machine' we are treated to a psychological battle between Dr. Bowman and Hal 9000, an intelligent computer gone haywire.  Magnificently directed by Stanley Kubrick, '2001' is a visually poetic version of Arthur C. Clarke's short story 'The Sentinel'.  The frighteningly calm voice of the psychopathic computer, Hal 9000, was provided by movie actor Douglas Rain. Who can forget the scene in which Dave shuts Hal 9000 down while the helpless computer voice sings 'Daisy'? \n"}, {"text": "And finally, the #1 sci-fi film of all-time according to this group of prominent scientists is 'Blade Runner', the futuristic drama detailing a bounty hunter's relentless pursuit of a series of androids on the lam.  What is the name used for these androids in the film?", "correct": "Replicants", "options": ["Synthoids", "Pseudo-humans", "Cybots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReplicants.\n\n\tBased on a novel by Philip K. Dick, 'Blade Runner' was directed by Ridley Scott.  This expertly wrought action drama includes just the right mixture of fast and slow moments, and features the acting of Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Darryl Hannah to boot!  Ford plays Deckard, a blade runner whose sole job has been to terminate quasi-human organisms called replicants.  Difficulties arise for Deckard when he begins to identify the very human nature of these replicants, especially the one portrayed by the sexy Sean Young. \n"}]}
