Bologna, Italy, however, is quite a wealthy location with many historical and cultural landmarks and, like other Italian spots, wonderful cuisine.  The meat was named after the city, but it's not from Bologna specifically.\r Dijon is in France, Gruy\u00e8re is in Switzerland, and Gouda is in Holland.  The latter two are cheeses and dijon is a type of mustard. \n"}, {"text": "What fields did The Beatles say they would \"take you down\" to in 1967...maybe forever?", "correct": "Strawberry", "options": ["Raspberry", "Coffee", "Banana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrawberry.\n\n\t\"Strawberry Fields Forever\", a single release with \"Penny Lane\" in 1967, became one of the band's most famous hits from their psychedelic era.  Many outlets have regarded it as one of The Beatles' most defining tracks.  It reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number eight on the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S., failing to top \"Penny Lane\" on the same record.\r The original Strawberry Fields were in Liverpool, England.  After John Lennon's death in the 1980s, Strawberry Fields became a memorial in Central Park as well.\r Strawberries-- despite being referred to as berries-- are not actually berries.  They're fruits created with several seeds on the outside.  Allegedly, bananas are. \n"}, {"text": "What food is the favourite of Garfield the Cat?", "correct": "Lasagna", "options": ["Potato chips", "Mashed potato", "Pizza"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLasagna.\n\n\tSince the late 1970s, at the dawn of \"Garfield\" and the three-panel strip's first appearance in national newspapers, the fat, orange feline has loved \"nature's most perfect food\", the pan of lasagna.  Many strips from start to finish have chronicled Garfield's love for all things Italian; even his TV specials and \"Garfield and Friends\" have shown this fact.  Jim Davis has gone on record saying that he couldn't have picked a more difficult food to draw, considering.\r Lasagna is an interesting dish.  An Italian classic, it consists of several layers of thin, flat pasta set on cheeses, sauces, and other contents, then baked.  Magnifico! \n"}, {"text": "According to Hannibal Lecter in \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1990), what type of beans did he eat the census taker's liver with?", "correct": "Fava", "options": ["Lima", "String", "Garbanzo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFava.\n\n\t\"A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.\"\r In this Oscar-winning film from 1990, Anthony Hopkins (who won Best Actor for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter) stated this line which has since become one of the most famous horror quotes of all time.  Lecter, a cannibal, claimed this to Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster).  The quote has since appeared on AFI's list of famous quotes.\r Fava beans are cooked and eaten in different cuisines around the world stretching from Szechuan cooking in China to spicier fare in Mexico.  Chianti, meanwhile, is a red wine from Tuscany, which may give you an idea of how Lecter prepared the legume.  You know...with human liver. \n"}, {"text": "Tangelos can be hybrids of tangerines and what other fruit?", "correct": "Grapefruit", "options": ["Apple", "Lemon", "Grape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrapefruit.\n\n\tWhile tangelos are usually hybrids between tangerines and pomelos, the largest citrus fruit found in Asia, they can also be created when you combine tangerines and grapefruits; such variety is usually found in other parts of the world, most notably Florida in its ideal citrus growing seasons.  The tangelo is thick-skinned like a tangerine but contain sweet, juicy, citrus insides.  This variety is much more suited to the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico mainly because the grapefruit was first hybridized in Barbados.\r Want a weirder fruit?  What about a combination orange/grapefruit-- it's known as a orangelo.  Ugli fruit is also a hybrid-- it's a grapefruit, tangerine, and orange combo.  Both are found in Central America and the Caribbean. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these books contains a girl named Violet being turned into a giant blueberry?", "correct": "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", "options": ["What's Eating Gilbert Grape", "James and the Giant Peach", "The Latke Who Couldn't Stop Screaming"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\n\tThe second of four children to lose their chance at inheriting Willy Wonka's crazy chocolate factory in Roald Dahl's children's book, Violet Beauregarde needlessly refused to listen when she tried chewing a prototype for anew type of gum which would act as a substitute for a three-course meal.  After the side and main course, she moved to dessert, blueberry pie, and promptly inflated into a blueberry (\"...turning violet, Violet!\").  She was later rolled out and squeezed to normal size.  Such events also happened in the film adaptations.  Oompa Loompah doopity-doo, am I right?\r \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was written by Dahl in 1964; he wrote \"James and the Giant Peach\" three years earlier.  \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\" was by Peter Hedges while \"The Latke Who Couldn't Stop Screaming\" (yes-- it's a book) was written by Lemony Snicket (aka. Daniel Handler) in 2007.\r There is no study proving that eating blueberries or gum will turn you into a giant blueberry.  Chew responsibly. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these famous historical figures was knighted?", "correct": "Francis Bacon", "options": ["Milton S. Hershey", "Dom P\u00e9rignon", "Charles T. Pepper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancis Bacon.\n\n\tMilton S. Hershey is the man responsible for the famous American chocolate/confection company Hershey's, the headquarters of which are in Hershey, Pennsylvania.  He was never knighted.\r Charles T. Pepper is the famous Dr. Pepper (though he was never a practicing doctor himself, but a pharmacist from Virginia).  He never invented the drink in question; it was named for him.  He was never knighted.\r Dom P\u00e9rignon was a French monk of the order of St. Benedict; he was never knighted, obviously, but he did become the namesake of one of Mo\u00ebt & Chandon's most famous champagnes.  The drink took his name and he had nothing to do with it.\r Francis Bacon, however, was knighted at the turn of the sixteenth century.  A man of science during the Renaissance in England, his empiricist methods became the benchmark for scientific research used to this day.  He and that certain part of the pig (you know...the bacony part) have no relation. \n"}, {"text": "In North America, what frozen waffle brand do ads demand you 'leggo' of?", "correct": "Eggo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEggo.\n\n\tEggo Waffles are frozen breakfast foods designed to be popped into a toaster and, sure enough, commercials have used the slogan 'Leggo My Eggo' for quite a while.  Created in the 1950s, Eggos are named partly because unlike regular waffles, they have the distinct taste of egg.  Most waffles, homemade at least, are made with a waffle mix or batter which can vary depending on the type.  They're best served with maple syrup in my opinion. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these foods on TV's \"The Simpsons\" is usually depicted with pink icing and sprinkles?", "correct": "Donut", "options": ["Cake", "Chocolate bar", "Hot dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDonut.\n\n\tDonuts are perhaps one of Homer Simpson's most favourite items though foods of all sorts have appeared in the show's more-than-twenty-five seasons airing.  Donuts in particular have gotten a notorious run; in many of the Halloween episodes, Homer's taste for donuts with pink icing has been a notable weakness.  He's stolen the giant Lard-Lad donut from the company sign (and received the wrath of killer shop mascots) and even sold his soul to the devil (Flanders, it would seem) for a single donut.   Mmmmmmm. \n"}, {"text": "What type of sauce is used in a croque-monsieur?", "correct": "B\u00e9chamel", "options": ["Velout\u00e9", "Hollandaise", "Sriracha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nB\u00e9chamel.\n\n\tA croque-monsieur, translating to 'Mister Crunch', is a French dish consisting of ham and cheese (usually a Swiss cheese) cooked into a sandwich in a variety of ways.  Some such ways involve the addition of eggs or other brunch-type foods.  The meal is also topped with a b\u00e9chamel consisting of butter, flour, and milk or cream, making it quite rich.\r A hollandaise would be better served on eggs Benedict; it's egg yolk, butter, and an acid (eg. lemon).  Velout\u00e9 is a light meat stock thickened with butter and flour.  Sriracha is a Thai sauce made with chilies and vinegar (amongst other seasonings); some people simply put it on anything. \n"}]}
