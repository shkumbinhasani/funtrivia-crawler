{"id": "363713", "name": "The Space Pumpkin Quiz | Sci / Tech | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Astronomy"], "questions": [{"text": "For my dinner party, I must make a salad. Fortunately, I'm in a giant pumpkin, so I can use it as my mixing bowl. I head straight for a comet, the Great Comet of 44BC. By what other name, reminiscent of a salad created in Mexico, is the comet known?", "correct": "Caesar's Comet", "options": ["Greek's Comet", "Waldorf's Comet", "Tossed Comet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaesar's Comet.\n\n\tIn Ancient Rome, when the Great Comet fell shortly after Julius Caesar's death, they viewed it as a sign of his newfound god status. The comet fell during the day, and quite possibly was the brightest daytime comet in history. The comet was visible for seven days in 44BC, but was not a periodic comet (meaning it does not visit Earth at regular intervals). It is believed that the comet disintegrated. \n"}, {"text": "I feel that Romaine lettuce is not quite enough for my salad. I hop in my pumpkin and head towards Jupiter. The pumpkin was nearly squashed by the planet's gravity but I was able to pass it safely and land on one of the many moons here. Which of these leafy greens could I add to the salad, which is the alternate name of Jupiter XXXVII?", "correct": "Kale", "options": ["Arugula", "Iceberg", "Spinach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKale.\n\n\tI personally prefer spinach in a salad, but Jupiter has no Spinach moon. The moon was discovered in 2001, and named Kale (pronounced Kay-lee) in 2003. The name is Greek; Kale was one of the Graces (Charites), daughters of Zeus (or Jupiter, as it turns out). \n"}, {"text": "Every salad needs a protein, so I head for such a nebula in space. But I seem to have set my coordinates wrong, and I end up way off course to a different nebula. Fortunately, my extra trip was not a total waste of time; I grab some fairy floss, as it should make a nice dessert snack after the salad. Which of these is a nebula in the Ara constellation?", "correct": "Cotton Candy Nebula", "options": ["Rock Candy Nebula", "Chocolate Nebula", "Candy Cane Nebula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCotton Candy Nebula.\n\n\tCotton candy, also known as fairy floss or candyfloss, will be a nice addition to my meal, so I'm not entirely upset my pumpkin went to the wrong place.\r The Cotton Candy Nebula was discovered by the IRAS satellite, and can be found in the Ara (The Alter) constellation. It is considered a protoplanetary nebula. \n"}, {"text": "Finally back on track, it's time to add some protein to the salad in my squashcraft. I find the nebula and slice the protein into my salad. Which of these is an actual nebula, also called CRL 2688?", "correct": "Egg Nebula", "options": ["Bean Nebula", "Ham Nebula", "Chicken Nebula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEgg Nebula.\n\n\tThe Egg Nebula was described in 1975 as a bipolar protoplanetary nebula, though Fritz Zwicky previously described it as two galaxies. The nebula is visible using only a medium-sized telescope, and is known for the brights arcs and circles found around a middle star. \n"}, {"text": "I like to make my own dressing, so I travel in my space pumpkin to get some citrus that will taste great in the salad. It was a bit difficult to track, but I finally found the C/2012 F6 comet I was looking for. What citrus-sounding comet have I landed on?", "correct": "Lemmon Comet", "options": ["Oringe Comet", "Lyme Comet", "Grapefroot Comet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLemmon Comet.\n\n\tThe Lemmon Comet was discovered by A. R. Gibbs in 2012 at the Mount Lemmon Survey near Tucson, Arizona. The comet was visible for many months, seen from the Southern Hemisphere at first, but crossing to the Northern Hemisphere in April 2013. \n"}, {"text": "I had a bit of trouble tracking my next target, as it was a series of US intelligence satellites, and I had to find a few remains of the satellites since they are no longer in use. I have finally found some though, so I can add the seeds to my citrus dressing for a nice crunch. Which of these was a space program during the 1960s?", "correct": "Poppy Program", "options": ["Mustard Program", "Caraway Program", "Sesame Program"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoppy Program.\n\n\tThe Poppy satellites were launched from 1962-1971, with a total of 24 satellites being launched (the first launch sent two, the second and third launch sent three each, and the remaining four launches sent four satellites each). All 24 launches were a success, and the program ended in 1977. \n"}, {"text": "I have but one ingredient left for my salad, so I set my pumpkin on a course to a nebula that would make a nice garnish atop the greens. More citrus is never a bad thing, so I've headed straight to which nebula, resembling a citrus slice?", "correct": "Lemon Slice Nebula", "options": ["Lime Slice Nebula", "Grapefruit Slice Nebula", "Orange Slice Nebula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLemon Slice Nebula.\n\n\tThe planetary nebula looks very similar to a lemon slice, thus the name. The young nebula is found in the Camelopardalis constellation, 4,500 light years from Earth. \n"}, {"text": "I have but one stop left and that is to our very own moon, but as I head there I get caught up in the rings of Saturn. As I crash into a moon, my ship explodes, sending pumpkin everywhere! I look around the moon, though, and notice it is named after cookware, so I can salvage my ship to make a nice pumpkin pie for dessert, placing the pumpkin bits on said cookware. Which of these is designated as Saturn XVIII?", "correct": "Pan", "options": ["Pot", "Cookie Sheet", "Whisk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPan.\n\n\tPan was discovered in 1990, and orbits Saturn in the Encke Gap. The moon is responsible for keeping the Gap free of dust particles from the rings (it is called a ring shepherd). It was named the god of shepherds, Pan. The walnut shaped moon was discovered in 1990, though the possibility of such a moon was theorized in 1985. Interestingly, image proof of the moon dates back to 1981. \n"}, {"text": "Fortunately for me, my escape pepita pod remains intact. I load all my ingredients and head towards Luna; yes, our very own moon. This is where I find a crater filled with alcohol. That is always a good thing to have at a dinner party! Which of these is a lunar crater found in Mare Imbrium?", "correct": "Beer Lunar Crater", "options": ["Vodka Lunar Crater", "Wine Lunar Crater", "Rum Lunar Crater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeer Lunar Crater.\n\n\tI had to stop by the Stein Lunar Crater first to grab some glasses to hold the beer.\r The Beer crater is considered a young crater, and is a fairly small indentation. It is found within Mare Imbrium, meaning \"Sea of Showers\". The crater is round and cup-shaped.\r Disclaimer: this crater is not actually filled with alcohol. It is simply convenient to say so for the purpose of this riveting story. \n"}, {"text": "I begin to run low on fuel, so head home to Earth. As I travel back, however, I cannot help but think I'm missing something. Nearing our atmosphere, I quickly remember what it was. I need to make my pumpkin pie creamy, and since it was a last minute decision to make the dessert, I did not have the desired substance at home. I don my space suit and head outside the capsule; our own galaxy was all I needed. What is the name of the galaxy containing my missing ingredient?", "correct": "Milky Way Galaxy & Milky Way & The Milky Way & The Milky Way Galaxy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilky Way Galaxy & Milky Way & The Milky Way & The Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n\tThe Milky Way Galaxy is one that contains our very own solar system, and comes from the Greek words for \"milky circle\". The Galaxy is found among several smaller galaxies, all part of the Virgo Supercluster. The center of the spiral galaxy is designated as Sagittarius A*, presumed to be a supermassive black hole. \n"}]}
