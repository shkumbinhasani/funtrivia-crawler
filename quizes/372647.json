To find out, figure out this fractured form:\n\nAim Air I Cane Sine Lang Goo Wedge", "correct": "American Sign Language & ASL", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language & ASL.\n\n\tAmerican Sign Language or ASL is the 4th most commonly used language in America. It was influenced by French sign language which can be seen in some signs. For example, \"to look for\" in French is \"chercher\" and the sign for \"to look for\" is made with a C hand not an L hand.  In ASL, you don't always sign every word but rather the important words. Instead of saying \"I'm happy with you\" you would sign \"I Happy You\".\r It is important to note not all deaf people use ASL. Some are oral, and some use both methods together which is known as total communication. There is a debate in the Deaf community about whether or not the Deaf should speak or not. \n"}, {"text": "Celebrities: This actress is deaf and a role model to your sister and many other people.
