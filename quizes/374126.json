{"id": "374126", "name": "\"Sword Art Online\" - Aincrad Arc Quiz | Television | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "S.. Sn-Sz"], "questions": [{"text": "\"The World of Swords\" - Starting SAO for the first time, players entered the 1st Floor to discover that they could not do which of these?", "correct": "Log out", "options": ["Change settings", "Control their movements", "Alter their appearance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLog out.\n\n\tTen thousand players hooked up to the first fully-immersive virtual reality game, 'Sword Art Online' (SAO), by plugging into their NerveGear units and connecting their minds to the server for intense RPG action.  On his first day, beta tester Kirito met with a newbie, Klein, and headed out to the fields to introduce him to the combat rules. Before Klein could log out for dinner though, they realized they couldn't log out; the option had been removed from their menus.  Soon, all of the players were teleported to the Starting City and introduced to a spectral apparition claiming to be the game's creator, Kayaba Akihiko, and told that they could not leave the game without beating it.  If they died, they would die in real life, and any attempts to be pulled free of their NerveGear in the real world would do the same thing. All of the players were transformed to reflect their appearances in real life before they were set free.  Kirito planned to leave immediately, taking shortcuts to the upper floors to gain experience (before the floors were wiped clean), but Klein opted to stay with his friends. \n"}, {"text": "\"Beater\" - Who defeated the boss of the 1st Floor?", "correct": "Kirito", "options": ["Diavel", "Asuna", "Agil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKirito.\n\n\tA month after the game's launch, two thousand people had died and the first floor had yet to be cleared, indicating a major shift in the enemy algorithms since the beta test.  Some of the strongest fighters gathered for a meeting, planning to team up and head to the boss room in the floor's dungeon together, but Kirito realized that he had no friends as a solo player. He ended up teaming up with a mysterious girl named Asuna and heading up.  Arriving at the boss room, Kirito noticed that the boss had a different tactic than when he first fought it, and with Asuna's help he ended up being the one to take out the fearsome foe, winning a rare item, the Coat of Midnight, for dealing the final blow. After the battle, many of the other players called him a beta tester and a cheater-- a beater-- and claimed that he should've acted sooner to save them.  Instead, Kirito took his winnings and continued solo, stepping foot onto the 2nd Floor and ending his party with Asuna. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Red-Nosed Reindeer\" - Kirito, deciding not to go solo, joined which guild for a brief spell?", "correct": "Moonlit Black Cats", "options": ["Divine Dragon Alliance", "Laughing Coffin", "Fuurinkazan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoonlit Black Cats.\n\n\tFour months after finishing the boss battle on the 1st Floor, Kirito still headed out to battle and the game finally saw progress all around; he was already level 40 and on the 11th Floor, and he decided to go against his solo tendencies to join the Moonlit Black Cats, a guild he felt could use a hand.  In a month, they'd forged their way through to the 20th Floor. On the 28th Floor, he ran into Klein again.  Now the leader of his own guild, Klein tried to get Kirito to hang around, but couldn't persuade him.  After a freak battle in the 27th Floor labyrinth resulting in the deaths of most of the Moonlit Black Cats, Kirito ventured off into the Forest of Wandering of Floor 35 on Christmas seeking out an item guarded by Nicholas the Renegade which could, allegedly, revive a dead player.  Ultimately, the item, a Divine Stone of Returning Soul, couldn't bring back his fallen comrades as it had to be used ten seconds after a player's death.  He gave it to Klein. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Black Swordsman\" - Kirito met a beast tamer named Silica whose familiar, Pina, was which of the following?", "correct": "Dragon", "options": ["Bird", "Raccoon", "Wolf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDragon.\n\n\tKirito came across Silica in the Forest of Wandering on the 35th Floor and while her dragon familiar, Pina, fell in battle, he was able to step in at the last moment to save her.  He decided, since the dragon's soul was in her possession, he could take her to the 47th Floor to visit the The Hill of Memories and retrieve a Pneuma Flower, an item that would revive her companion. Doing so, he ended up catching the attention of a guild leader, Rosalia, who he'd actually intended to attract, using Silica as bait, with the intent of sending her and her guild of player-killers (red players) to prison on behalf of a vengeance-seeking warrior. He was able to do so, as his level was much higher than all of theirs, and save Silica's familiar from being lost forever. \n"}, {"text": "\"Murder in the Safe Zone\" - Yolko, Caynz, and Schmitt were all part of what now-defunct guild?", "correct": "Golden Apple", "options": ["Rising Sun", "Sword and Steel", "Weeping WIllow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolden Apple.\n\n\tAfter Kirito and Asuna, now the second-in-command of a leading clearing guild, spent a day relaxing in a grassy meadow, she ended up taking him out for dinner in Marten, a city on the 57th Floor, but the two were interrupted by an apparent murder; a player had been killed and hanged from a belltower and no witness were present to see who committed the impossible crime (since one would need to accept a duel to be killed by another player).  This led the duo to question his date for the evening, Yolko, who admitted that she was in his guild. When Kirito discovered the blade was made by a man named Grimlock, Yolko spilled the beans; Grimlock was likely out to kill the other members of the guild since they were inadvertently responsible for the death of Griselda, the leader of their Golden Apple guild. Schmitt, a higher-level player, was also involved in the goings-on, and when he was brought to Yolko for a discussion, they were shocked to find a murder committed before their very eyes; Yolko was attacked from behind by a cloaked figure, a dagger thrown into her back. \n"}, {"text": "\"Illusionary Avenger\" - Who was responsible for Griselda's death?", "correct": "Grimlock", "options": ["Schmitt", "Yolko", "Caynz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrimlock.\n\n\tAfter Yolko fell to her death, Kirito pursued her attacker but lost him when he teleported away.  It wasn't until Kirito and Asuna let Schmitt go to the Hill of the Cross on the 19th Floor that they uncovered the truth.  Really, Caynz and Yolko faked their deaths and used teleportation crystals to escape suspicion. They did this to avenge Griselda, mainly by getting Schmitt to fess up though he never committed the crime.  Really, it was Grimlock, the creator of the weapons and the real-life husband of Griselda, who killed her to preserve the memory of what she was like in the real world and he hired the evil guild of the Laughing Coffin to do so.  When the rest of the Golden Apples take Grimlock to help him cope, Kirito and Asuna decide to return to town and leave the memory of Griselda at peace. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Temperature of the Heart\" - Kirito and Lisbeth searched for which of these materials in an attempt to craft a powerful sword?", "correct": "Crystallite Ingot", "options": ["Thorium", "Adamantium Crystal", "Blackrock Ore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrystallite Ingot.\n\n\tKirito ended up wandering into Lisbeth's blacksmithing shop to seek out the strongest sword he could find (on Asuna's recommendation) but he ended up breaking what she considered her masterpiece.  As repayment, Kirito took her on a trip to Floor 55 to find a Crystallite Ingot guarded by X'rphan the White Wyrm. A battle ensued and the pair found themselves (and the ingot) at the bottom of a pit only to discover that they'd fallen into the dragon's lair.  The two ended up escaping, but only by flying out on the dragon and being tossed into the sky.  They made it back in one piece and Lisbeth realized that she was falling for Kirito. After making his new sword-- Dark Repulser, her new masterpiece-- she planned to tell him the truth but Asuna arrived and interrupted her.  Kirito, realizing, asked her to become his exclusive blacksmith and renewed her faith in escaping the game, even though she wouldn't end up with him. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Sword Dance of Black and White\" - Kirito finds which of these rare animals in the wild, sparking a dinner date between himself and Asuna?", "correct": "Ragout Rabbit", "options": ["Gold Wolf", "Sandwich Beast", "Tasty Turkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRagout Rabbit.\n\n\tAfter two years in the game, Kirito came across a Ragout Rabbit in the woods on the 74th Floor and killed it, bringing it back to Floor 50 with him.  Asuna, who'd maxed out her cooking skills, volunteered to cook it at her house and with that they had their first date together, devouring the in-game gourmet food in a rabbit stew. Following the meal, Kirito diverged from his normal plan and opted to join a party with Asuna; she would take a leave of absence from her position as second-in-command for the Knights of the Bloodoath and they would clear the 74th Floor Labyrinth dungeon together.  Unfortunately, Asuna's bodyguard, Kuradeel, had different ideas, and when Kirito defeated him in a duel he was forced to sulk off. The two proceeded to work through the dungeon only to come across the boss room as a duo.  Inside, they found a deadly beast...The Gleam Eyes...and knew they couldn't beat it alone. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Blue-Eyed Demon\" - To protect other players, Kirito revealed he had which hidden skill in battle against The Gleam Eyes demon?", "correct": "Dual Blades", "options": ["A second health bar", "Holy Sword", "Feint"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDual Blades.\n\n\tKirito and Asuna, afraid to advance without a larger group, decided not to fight The Gleam Eyes but instead turn around.  Doing this, they ran into Klein and his Fuurinkazan clearing guild and they all banded together to clear the rest of the area.  During this time, they encountered another guild-- The Army-- who planned to return to the front lines and fight the boss. They got more than they bargained for and Kirito, Asuna, Klein, and the others had to step in to help.  All three risked their lives to save the foolish guild but it was Kirito who made the most impact, drawing Dark Repulser for the first time and demonstrating his one-of-a-kind dual wielding abilities to banish The Gleam Eyes once and for all...although he nearly died doing so.  While Klein and his group continued on through the portal, Kirito and Asuna returned to the 50th Floor before being summoned to the latter's guild hall. Her request for a leave of absence was denied; if Kirito wanted to remain in a party with her, he would need to duel the leader of the Knights of the Bloodoath and if he lost he would need to join them. \n"}, {"text": "\"Crimson Killing Intent\" - Kirito accepted the duel with Heathcliff, the leader of the Knights of the Bloodoath.  Did Kirito win?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhile Kirito accepted the duel in an attempt to be with Asuna in his party, the battle in the colosseum ended with Heathcliff, the guild leader, as the winner as he used his Holy Sword techniques to move at a shocking speed.  As such, Kirito was made a member of the guild against his wishes.  His first order of business was to go into a party without Asuna, instead traveling into the wilds of Floor 55 to battle enemies with Godfree (the Commander of the Vanguard) and his former opponent Kuradeel. When they were out in the labyrinth, however, Kuradeel poisoned the two others and revealed himself as a member of the Laughing Coffin before killing Godfree. Kirito was only saved at the last minute by Asuna who'd been tracking the trio the whole time.  The two embraced before returning to Asuna's house where, the next morning, Kirito proposed to her.  She said yes. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Girl of the Morning Dew\" - Where do Kirito and Asuna find Yui?", "correct": "In the forest", "options": ["In a lake", "In their cabin", "In a dungeon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the forest.\n\n\tKirito and Asuna end up approved for a leave of absence considering recent circumstances and the two waste no time in getting married and residing in a cabin on the 22nd Floor.  While exploring together one day, they come across a young girl with no cursor in the woods and bring her back to their cabin to recuperate. Discovering that her name is Yui, the two of them decide to take care of her as parental figures until they can find her actual parents.  To do this, they opt to return to the Town of Beginnings on Floor 1 to canvas the city.  In doing so, the two get into a fight with the local army, but Asuna scares them off with her immense strength. It's then that Yui remembers that she never came from the 1st Floor, but somewhere much darker. \n"}, {"text": "\"Yui's Heart\" - Saving Kirito and Asuna from danger, Yui reveals herself to be another player in disguise.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tKirito and Asuna are met by Yulier, a woman from The Army, whose members have been terrorizing Floor 1.  She apologizes for her guildmates and claims to desperately need their help to find a companion of hers, lost in the labyrinthine dungeon right beneath the Town of Beginnings.  They head in to find him (with Yui in tow), which they do, but come face-to-face with one of the strongest enemies they've ever encountered: The Fatal Scythe. Yulier and her partner teleport out safely, but Kirito and Asuna end up being no match for the foe and, to their shock, Yui steps in to save the day, invoking her power and destroying the creature once and for all. Yui reveals herself as part of the program, a manifestation of the system meant to oversee the entire server.  Having killed the monster she's now regarded as a foreign object in the game code and must be deleted but, before she leaves, she says how glad she was to be loved by her foster parents.  After being wiped from the game, Kirito hacks into the code and creates an item from her soul-- Yui's Heart-- which he gives to Asuna and remains saved to his NerveGear. \n"}, {"text": "\"Edge of Hell's Abyss\" - Kirito, Asuna, and a team of skilled warriors face off against The Skull Reaper, a foe resembling which of these?", "correct": "Centipede", "options": ["Bull", "Grim Reaper", "Dragon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCentipede.\n\n\tAfter an eventful couple of weeks, Kirito and Asuna are called back to the front lines by Heathcliff and, with their friends and powerful allies, they're brought to the boss room of the next floor and trapped there in a fight to the death with The Skull Reaper, the most dangerous boss thus far.  When it drops from the ceiling onto the party, Kirito and Asuna have no choice but to fend off the being's attacks while others chip away at its health bars.  Heathcliff, leading the charge, calls for everyone to make a final blow on the beast and, of course, it's a matter of life and death. \n"}, {"text": "\"The End of the World\" - On which floor does Kirito face off against the game's final boss?", "correct": "Floor 75", "options": ["Floor 1", "Floor 100", "Floor 0"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFloor 75.\n\n\tIn the boss room of Floor 75, Kirito, Asuna, and the others successfully brought down The Skull Reaper and collapsed in exhaustion.  While everyone worried about the remaining twenty-five floors in the game, Kirito noticed something odd and tested a theory by making an attack on Heathcliff, revealing him as an Immortal Object. Heathcliff then reveals himself to be the creator of the game Kayaba Akihiko, and also the game's final boss.  Heathcliff paralyzes the fighters in the room (save for Kirito) and forces him to battle, stating that if Kirito wins, then the game will end and they'll all be freed. Kirito has no choice and puts forth a valiant effort when Heathcliff intentionally removes his Immortal status...but it becomes clear when his weapon breaks that he's likely not going to win.  In that moment, however, everyone is shocked when Asuna, no longer paralyzed, is able to step in front of Heathcliff's blade, killing herself but saving Kirito. \n"}, {"text": "Does Kirito beat the game?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAfter Asuna dies, Heathcliff stabs Kirito who, summoning up the last of his strength, uses Asuna's discarded rapier to stab back through Heathcliff, so not only does Kirito defeat the final boss, the game creator himself, but he's killed in the process.\rKirito awakens on a platform overlooking Aincrad and finds both Asuna and Kayaba Akihiko waiting for him.  They discuss what happened...and why...as \"Sword Art Online's\" players are removed from the game and the world falls away in pieces.  Akihiko departs and Kirito and Asuna are able to spend their final moments together in the game.\r...But Kirito awakens in a hospital bed.  Surprised that he survived the game, he gets up and begins searching the halls of the hospital searching for Asuna. \n"}]}
