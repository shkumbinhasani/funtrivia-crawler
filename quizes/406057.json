{"id": "406057", "name": "The \"Resident Evil 3\" Enemy Guide Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis"], "questions": [{"text": "The Zombies found throughout this game were infected with which strain of virus?", "correct": "T-Virus", "options": ["G-Virus", "B-Virus", "Las Plagas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nT-Virus.\n\n\tThough the G-Virus appears to run rampant in \"Resident Evil 2\" (especially when considering the evolution of William Birkin), the T-Virus is the cause of the outbreak in Raccoon City proper in \"Resident Evil 3\", occurring before and after Claire and Leon's story.  Zombies created in \"Resident Evil 3\" are hearty and are often able to take a number of hits from any gun before falling. It's still occasionally possible to get a headshot and one-hit-KO one of these animated corpses, but it's quite rare.  Sometimes it makes the most sense to run by and conserve ammunition, but you won't always have that luxury. \n"}, {"text": "Zombie dogs, found in this game, are known by what typical series name?", "correct": "Cerberus", "options": ["Spreaders", "Biters", "Bloodhounds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCerberus.\n\n\tAppearing in most main-series games, Cerberus are quick, dangerous, zombified dogs and they will waste no time in taking a flying leap across a room to get at your flesh.  Despite their speed, these foes aren't all too strong and will often be felled by a shotgun blast to the head, which isn't particularly difficult if your reflexes are quick.  These creatures often hunt in packs, so if you find yourself surrounded you'll probably have a hard time overcoming them.  They appear early in this game as well, so you'll need to be on your guard. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is known to stop the poison of a Drain Deimos?", "correct": "Green Herb", "options": ["Blue Herb", "Gunpowder", "First Aid Spray"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen Herb.\n\n\tJill's only way out of the Uptown section of Raccoon City will involve bringing power back to the Subway, and to do that she needs to enter the Power Substation and flip the switches that have since blown their fuses.  The problem there is that the Power Substation has been overtaken by infected bugs which have fed off the T-Virus-infected Zombies of the city, creating larger, more dangerous disease spreaders. Jill can take quite a few hits from these little guys, and they're easy to kill, but they're crafty and quick.  A memo Jill can obtain before heading into the Substation will inform her that their toxins can be abated with simple Green Herbs. Once she's done at the Substation, she won't have to see these things again. \n"}, {"text": "When fighting Zombies infected with the Nemesis-Alpha parasite, where is their weak spot?", "correct": "The head", "options": ["The chest", "The leg", "The tail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe head.\n\n\tSome Zombies found in this game go a step further and Jill/Carlos will find that they have a helmet-like parasite protecting them from harm.  This is a Nemesis-specific thing as his parasitic abilities will allow him to infect people with stronger protective capabilities.  To beat these zombies, you need to shoot their bodies until the head-laden parasite reveals a singular red weak spot.  Once you shoot that weak spot enough, the zombie will fall. \n"}, {"text": "Gammas are susceptible to which of these?", "correct": "Heat", "options": ["Acid", "Cold", "Light"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeat.\n\n\tFirst found in the Raccoon City sewer system, Gamma-type Hunters are weak as bioweapons, but generally tougher than your everyday infected creatures.  These bipedal foes derived from frogs, and the T-Virus has mutated these once-harmless creatures into giant foes with gaping, toothed maws that can swallow prey whole.  By the time Jill heads into the sewers to escape Nemesis, they'll have free reign of the tunnels.  Fortunately, by this point, she'll be able to use a Grenade Launcher (and hopefully some Flame Rounds) to put these creatures down for good. \n"}, {"text": "Only one of the two playable characters in this game faces off against Lickers.  Which?", "correct": "Carlos & Carlos Olivera", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarlos & Carlos Olivera.\n\n\tLickers are a prominent foe in \"Resident Evil 2\", and the only time you should face off against them in this game is when you head to the Racoon City Police Department, and that's something that only Carlos does.  These creatures rely heavily on sound to flush out their prey, and with their fearsome claws and long tongues, they can do massive damage to anyone who proceeds without caution.  These creatures are, fortunately, susceptible to light, so a Flash Grenade should incapacitate them long enough for you to get the jump. \n"}, {"text": "The Beta version of which foe makes an appearance in the Spencer Memorial Hospital?", "correct": "Hunter", "options": ["Tyrant", "Licker", "Zombie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHunter.\n\n\tOne of the later enemies found in the game, the Beta-Hunter is similar to Hunters found in previous installations of the game, but it differs in a couple of key differences.  Alpha Hunters, seen in the Spencer Mansion, were stronger with their attacks, taking more damage out of Jill during her first run-ins with the creature.  The Betas, however, do less damage (though they still do a lot) to ensure they're more agile.  You might find that it's much more difficult to get a headshot in; they duck and dodge a lot more reflexively. \n"}, {"text": "Pale Heads, found in the NEST 2 Lab, are known for which of these?", "correct": "Regenerative capabilities", "options": ["Being invincible", "Long, tendril-like limbs", "Weak spots on their backs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRegenerative capabilities.\n\n\tAs described in a note found on the way into the NEST 2 Lab, the Pale Heads seem to have taken over the hallways and corridors where the vaccine was synthesized.  Coming complete with significant regrowth capabilities, you'll need high-powered weaponry to bring these creatures down in short order (ie. you don't want to waste your handgun ammunition on them).  Several shotgun blasts to the head or grenade launcher rounds are your best bet at putting these down for good.  They are, otherwise, just as dangerous damage-wise as any regular zombie. \n"}, {"text": "Jill is able to destroy Nemesis at the climax of the game, but to do that she'll need to shoot it with a massive electrical beam how many times?", "correct": "Three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree & 3.\n\n\tJill will fight Nemesis a handful of times throughout the game, each allowing it to regenerate and evolve more and more until the final battles in the NEST 2 Lab at the story's end.  After Carlos drowns Nemesis in a powerful solvent, the bioweapon will return and take root in a final boss chamber.  Fortunately, it's also a room containing a high-powered electric gun that Jill can use...and she'll need to fire it three times...before Nemesis will be blasted through entirely.  There won't be time for Nemesis to come back when Raccoon City is nuked a short time after. \n"}, {"text": "The final shot taken in the game won't be against Nemesis, but instead against which UBCS foe?", "correct": "Nicholai", "options": ["Tyrell", "Murphy", "Mikhail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNicholai.\n\n\tA member of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service, Nicholai's motivations become clear once Jill meets with the team in the subway during her escape from the Uptown region of Raccoon City.  He'll ultimately make it far into the story, living past Nemesis and acting as the final actual encounter of the game.  Jill will have the opportunity, with Carlos' help, to take a final shot at the greedy mercenary and the pair will leave him atop the hospital to die in the missile blast that wipes out the city. \n"}]}
