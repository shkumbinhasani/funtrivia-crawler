{"id": "247692", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Der Tag' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "Here's a toughie to start you out!  At the outset of this episode, a lonely Frank is on the telephone with a jubilant Margaret.  While Hot Lips parties away during a conference in Tokyo, poor Ferret Face is miserably whiling away the time 'home' at the 4077th.  Meanwhile, Radar snoozes away during this pathetic telephone conversation.  What is the title of the comic book that lies on Radar's chest while he restfully dozes?", "correct": "The Avengers", "options": ["Superman", "The Fantastic Four", "Captain Marvel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Avengers.\n\n\tThis is an example of an anachronism on 'M*A*S*H'.  The comic book Radar has on his chest was yet to be printed in the early 1950s.  In fact, the Avengers were hardly even a notion in Marvel Comics founder Stan Lee's brain at that point, I'm guessing!\r With teddy bear in arm, soundly sleeping, Radar serves simply to agitate Frank even more.  'God knows what filth he's dreaming,' Frank complains. \n"}, {"text": "Apparently, while away in Tokyo, Margaret has made several good friends, including a physical therapist named Fred.  What word does Margaret emphasize when she describes Fred to the hapless Frank?", "correct": "Body", "options": ["Muscles", "Brain", "Handsome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBody.\n\n\tAccording to Margaret, Fred 'hasn't got a brain in his whole body', with an emphasis on 'body'.  Frank instantly replies, 'What do you mean by 'body', why do you have to say 'body'?  It seems that Margaret is essentially torturing Frank here, signalling the beginning of the end of their 'friendship'. \n"}, {"text": "With Frank so miserable, things are difficult for everyone else at the 4077th.  Colonel Potter recognizes this, and brings Hawkeye and BJ into his office to discuss the matter.  Does Colonel Potter give the two doctors a direct order to be nice to Frank?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tColonel Potter claims that 'the man feels totally friendless', and wants something done about it.  However, Potter knows that he can't officially order Hawkeye and BJ to be nice to poor Frank, so he uses a subtler approach, namely, he begs.  'Who could resist those colonel eyes?' asks Hawkeye. \n"}, {"text": "The boys engage in a game of poker in the Swamp, and Frank is eventually invited to join the crowd.  Offered a glass of gin, Frank drinks it like water.  What flavor does he describe as he sips down his gin?", "correct": "Lemon", "options": ["Licorice", "Cherry", "Vanilla"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLemon.\n\n\tIt's hilarious to see Frank suck down one gin after another, especially given the fact that his character is supposedly a teetotaller (but we know different!)  After describing the gin as 'nice and lemony', it is revealed that Hawkeye and BJ have used cough drops to flavor their precious booze. \n"}, {"text": "During the poker game, Frank is incredibly lucky and wins a great deal of money from his fellow denizens of the 4077th.  His very first hand is an indication of how the night will go.  What type of hand is he dealt without having to draw a single card?", "correct": "Flush", "options": ["Full house", "Four of a kind", "Straight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlush.\n\n\tFrank's first hand is a heart flush.  When he is asked to draw, he claims, 'These will suit me just fine.'  He attempts to bet $50 when its his turn, but Colonel Potter corrects Frank by informing him that 'the maximum bet is five dollars, poker face.' \n"}, {"text": "After a full night of cards, dancing and lots of booze, Frank passes out from all the excitement.  After dragging the poor, drunken sod back to the Swamp, BJ and Hawkeye develop a clever plan.  They place a toe tag on Frank's foot.  Aside from 'emotionally exhausted', what other description do they give of their beloved tentmate?", "correct": "Morally bankrupt", "options": ["Inescapably annoying", "Terminally dull", "Shamelessly corrupt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorally bankrupt.\n\n\tFrank's best moments come in the Officer's Club, where he dances with Nurse Kellye.  Apparently, Frank likes the 'curve of her gluteus maximus' and 'the red fullness of her lips'!  After passing and out and being transported to the Swamp, Frank giggles hilariously as Hawkeye and BJ apply the toe tag. \n"}, {"text": "The following morning, all seems well, all, that is, except for Frank, who is missing!  Who first notices that Frank has flown the coop?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Colonel Potter", "BJ", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tRadar comes to check on Frank in the Swamp and finds him missing.  Frank was supposed to be on duty in post-op, so this means trouble.  Radar has even checked Margaret's tent, but found it padlocked. \n"}, {"text": "Confounded by Frank's disappearance, BJ and Hawkeye meet with Colonel Potter.  Colonel Potter discovers Frank's whereabouts via a phone call from a medic named Nick at an aid station.  Frank has been transported to the front!  Which of these is not part of Nick's description of Frank Burns?", "correct": "Squinty eyes", "options": ["Big pores", "Skinny guy", "No chin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSquinty eyes.\n\n\tPoor Frank...even Nick describes him, essentially, as a ferret.  As we, the viewers, know, Frank accidentally flopped into an ambulance that was then driven to an aid station at the front line.  An annoyed Colonel Potter selects two 'volunteers' to go and retrieve Frank, Hawkeye and BJ. \n"}, {"text": "During the entire time that Frank is at the front, do we ever see him awake?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAs Hawkeye puts it, regarding the happily sleeping Frank: 'As a doctor, he's hitting his peak right now.'  Back home at the 4077th, Frank awakens from his peaceful snooze, perfectly refreshed and ready for a new day.  The same cannot be said for Hawkeye and BJ who look dead tired after entertaining Frank all evening. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret finally returns from her sojourn in Tokyo, bearing gifts.  What has she brought Frank as a token of her esteem for her amorous lover?", "correct": "Glazed plums", "options": ["Decorative chopsticks", "A child's doll", "Dried seaweed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlazed plums.\n\n\tRegarding the glazed plums, Margaret claims: 'I saw them in a window and said, \"That's Frank.\"'  She continues, 'I hear that peace talks are going badly.'  Frank quickly responds, 'We can only hope.'  Ah, endless love!\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
