{"id": "9796", "name": "How to Do Science Trivia Quiz | Sci / Tech | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Miscellaneous Science"], "questions": [{"text": "You are interested in doing an experiment on bacteria. You notice that bacteria tend to grow on agar gel. Every time you look at a dish of agar, you see bacterial colonies. What do you call this step of the scientific method?", "correct": "Observation", "options": ["Fact", "Hypothesis", "Theory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nObservation.\n\n\tYou looked at something and noticed it. That's the first step of the method! \n"}, {"text": "Hmmm. After looking at lots of dishes of agar and finding bacteria on every one, you say to yourself, 'Barring other factors, bacteria will grow on an uncovered dish of agar at room temperature.' What, in layman's but not scientific terms, have you just created?", "correct": "A theory", "options": ["An explanation", "A fact", "A variable"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA theory.\n\n\tA theory is an explanation backed by observations. Note that a scientific theory is rather different, and is explained as being facts established over time, which is different than the situation described in the question. \n"}, {"text": "You have read research that claims that garlic juice kills bacteria. You decide to do an experiment to see if garlic juice will prevent bacteria from growing on agar gel. You state, 'I think bacteria will not grow on agar gel that has been treated with garlic juice.' This statement is a...", "correct": "Hypothesis", "options": ["Observation", "Fact", "Explanation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHypothesis.\n\n\tUnlike a theory, a hypothesis is not backed up by observations. It is often thought of as a 'scientific guess'. Once this guess has been backed up by observations, it can be called a theory. \n"}, {"text": "You set up your experiment. You need to think about things like the amount of gel in each dish, the amount of garlic juice you use, etc. You know that you want to use the same amount of each of these items for each dish in your experiment. These things are called...", "correct": "Control variables", "options": ["Experimental variables", "Control groups", "Response variables"], "explanation": "\n\n\nControl variables.\n\n\tThe control variables are items that you hold constant during your experiment. \n"}, {"text": "You will set up two groups of Petri dishes. Both groups will get equal amounts of agar gel. Both groups will use dishes of the same size, and the dishes will be held at the same temperature. Both groups will be inoculated with the same amount and strain of bacteria. One group will have 5 ml. of garlic extract added to each dish. The group that does NOT have garlic extract added is the...", "correct": "Control group", "options": ["Experimental variable", "Control variable", "Experimental group"], "explanation": "\n\n\nControl group.\n\n\tYou compare the control group to the experimental group to see if there are significant differences between the two. \n"}, {"text": "You will set up two groups of Petri dishes. Both groups will get equal amounts of agar gel. Both groups will use dishes of the same size, and the dishes will be held at the same temperature. Both groups will be inoculated with the same amount and strain of bacteria. One group will have 5 ml. of garlic extract added to each dish. The addition of garlic extract is the...", "correct": "Experimental variable", "options": ["Control variable", "Response variable", "Control group"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExperimental variable.\n\n\tThe experimental variable is the variable that you do not hold constant- the one that you manipulate or change. \n"}, {"text": "You will set up two groups of Petri dishes. Both groups will get equal amounts of agar gel. Both groups will use dishes of the same size, and the dishes will be held at the same temperature. Both groups will be inoculated with the same amount and strain of bacteria. One group will have 5 ml. of garlic extract added to each dish. Seven days after you add the bacteria, you measure the amount of bacterial growth in each of your dishes. This growth is the...", "correct": "Response variable", "options": ["Experimental variable", "Control variable", "Control group"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResponse variable.\n\n\tYou measure how this variable responds to your experimental treatment. \n"}, {"text": "You used a total of 32 dishes in your experiment, measuring the amount of bacterial growth in each dish by noting the square centimeters of the area that was covered by growth on day 7. Since this is a new experiment, we don't have any standard deviation figures from other, similar experiments. Which statistical test would be most appropriate to determine whether or not there is a significant difference between the two groups?", "correct": "A t-test", "options": ["A z test", "A chi-square test", "Any of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA t-test.\n\n\tA t-test is used when you want to look for significant differences in ordinal data between two groups, but you don't have population standard deviations to work with.  Chi-square is used for proportional data (such as percentages). We don't have a standard deviation, so we can't use the z test. \n"}, {"text": "In order to show that your results are indeed significant, you must disprove the null hypothesis. What is the null hypothesis?", "correct": "The statistical assertion that there are no significant differences between the control and experimental groups or that these results are due to chance alone.", "options": ["The assertion that there is an error in the experiment", "The assertion that nothing happened in this experiment", "The chance that what you observed was due to the experiment alone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe statistical assertion that there are no significant differences between the control and experimental groups or that these results are due to chance alone.\n\n\tIn order for your results to be significant, you have to be able to show that they aren't just due to chance and that there really is a significant difference between your two groups. \n"}, {"text": "OK, it looks like your garlic extract kills bacteria! Have you proved that garlic extract kills bacteria?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tVery little in science is proven! You can assert that the likelihood is great, but you haven't proven your assertion. \n"}]}
