{"id": "296142", "name": "Minute Men Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "M.. Ma-Mi"], "questions": [{"text": "Who is the main character of the movie?", "correct": "Virgil Fox", "options": ["Jason Dolley", "Charlie Tuttle", "Zeke Thompson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVirgil Fox.\n\n\tVirgil Fox is played by Jason Dolley.  He meets up with a supersmart kid during his freshman year in high school, Charlie Tuttle.  During his senior year, he meets another friend of his, Zeke Thompson.  The movie first aired in January of 2008 on Disney Channel. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Charlie's cat?", "correct": "Albert Felinestein", "options": ["Queen LaFeline", "None of these", "Felinestein's Monster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlbert Felinestein.\n\n\tCharlie Tuttle is played by Luke Benward.  He is a 14 year-old genius who builds a time machine.  His cat, Albert Felinestein, became the world's first time traveler in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Who did the Minute Men save from nudity at their school?", "correct": "Chester", "options": ["Dexter", "Fester", "Lester"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChester.\n\n\tChester, who is played by Dexter Darden, is saved by Minute Men from an embarrassing experience.  Some bullies stole Chester's clothes, and he runs up to the main level of the school in a towel.  Another boy rips off the towel, to expose his nudity.  The Minute Men go back in time to give Chester a pair of cool clothes.  He heads upstairs and shocks the bullies.  He then becomes a much different person after this experience. \n"}, {"text": "What does everybody call the Minute Men?", "correct": "The Snow Suit Guys", "options": ["The Time Travellers", "The Minute Men", "The Just In Timers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Snow Suit Guys.\n\n\tVirgil doesn't like everyone in the school calling them the Snow Suit Guys.  He constantly tries to enforce the fact that they are known as the Minute Men.  Nobody pays attention to him, and they are still called the Snow Suit Guys. \n"}, {"text": "When the cat went into the time machine, a major error occurred. What was this error?", "correct": "His watch was a minute behind, and it shouldn't have been", "options": ["The leash didn't pull Zeke in, and it should have", "He was covered in snow, but he should have been sweating", "Nothing unusual happened in this scene"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis watch was a minute behind, and it shouldn't have been.\n\n\tAlbert Felinestein was the world's first time traveler.  When he came back, Virgil and Zeke looked at the watch they put on the cat, and it was one minute behind their watch.  This would not be the case should time travel actually work.  If the cat went back in time, and came back, his clock would be running the entire time.  Therefore, it would still read the same.  Another option could be that he could live in the past for days, or even years, and come back to the exact time he left, and his clock could have read any time of day. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Charlie have a crush on?", "correct": "Jeanette", "options": ["Jocelyn", "Amy", "Stephanie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeanette.\n\n\tCharlie has a crush on Jeannette Pachelewski, who is played by Kara Crane.  Right before Charlie, Virgil, and Zeke jump in the black hole, she kisses him.  This makes him freeze in his tracks.  When they come out of the black hole, in the library, he kisses her, and this embarrasses him, because he forgets that Jeanette hadn't kissed him at this point. Jocelyn is Derek's French teacher.  Stephanie, whom Virgil has a crush on, believes all she is teaching him is French kissing.  She catches her boyfriend kissing Jocelyn.  When she has caught him, Derek wants Virgil to go back in time to prevent Stephanie from getting him caught. If he was a good boyfriend, he would have Virgil stop Jocelyn from kissing him altogether.  This is one of the first signs we see that proves he likes Jocelyn, not Stephanie. \n"}, {"text": "What causes Stephanie to break her leg?", "correct": "Something knocked her off the cheerleading pyramid", "options": ["The cheerleaders at the bottom of the pyramid let go of her ankles", "She jumped off the cheerleading pyramid", "The cheerleaders at the bottom of the pyramid collapsed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomething knocked her off the cheerleading pyramid.\n\n\tEarlier in the movie, we see a guy with a really long name get \"seduced\" by Jocelyn and her friends.  She gets him to break the rules and bring food out to them.  She moves a \"Wet Floor\" sign so he doesn't know it is slick.  He trips and food goes flying, so the \"Minute Men\" go back in time to prevent this from happening. He starts becoming a little more popular, and joins in a game of hackey sack.  He kicks the hackey sack toward the cheerleading pyramid.  The hackey sack hit Stephanie and threw her balance off just enough for her to fall from the pyramid.  It is a wonder how such a tiny ball can throw off such a steady pyramid! \n"}, {"text": "Who is Amy?", "correct": "Virgil's little sister", "options": ["Virgil's mother", "Virgil's crush", "Virgil's girlfriend"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVirgil's little sister.\n\n\tAmy is always mad at Virgil for not having any \"cute\" boys as his friends.  She annoys Virgil all the time.  Even when Virgil was on his way into the black hole to save the world, she said \"When you die, can I have your room?\"  Virgil does not really like Amy.  We never see Virgil's mother in this movie, and Stephanie never technically becomes his girlfriend.  At the end of the movie, they never really \"become\" a couple, but they do tell each other how they feel about each other.  Virgil is jealous of Derek for being Stephanie's boyfriend throughout the entire movie. \n"}, {"text": "Near the end of the movie, what does Derek hold up when he says \"Guys, we can't do this!  Because I've got a better idea!  Let's put this on them!\"?", "correct": "Lipstick", "options": ["Leis", "Cheerleading outfits", "Nothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLipstick.\n\n\tDerek claims that he tried to stop the football team from messing with Virgil and Charlie.  However, when Virgil is in the black hole to save the world, he sees the scene where he interfered to try to save Charlie.  This was the first day the time machine components were used.  He overhears Derek making things WORSE for Virgil and Charlie, and this changes his viewpoint on things.  He realizes that this day was a good day.  He met Charlie that day. \n"}, {"text": "What does Charlie want to build at the end of the movie?", "correct": "Teleportation device", "options": ["Another time machine", "Molecular transporter", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeleportation device.\n\n\tCharlie claims that he can build a teleporter out of the materials that were used to make the time machine.  He never really wanted to use the time machine, and became uneasy about using it after awhile, yet he wanted to use the parts to make another machine!  He says he found a way to use the parts without creating another black hole.  Yeah right, Charlie! \n"}]}
