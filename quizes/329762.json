{"id": "329762", "name": "\"Laryngitis\" Quiz / Test | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "What does Puck do in the opening of the episode that causes him to lose his social status?", "correct": "Have his mohawk shaved", "options": ["Get caught talking to Rachel", "Get caught singing in the showers", "Miss a touchdown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHave his mohawk shaved.\n\n\tThe episode opens with Puck's mohawk getting a shave.  When he arrives at school he realizes that he no longer possesses the power he once had over the kids in the hallways.  Upon walking into the choir room, Brittany doesn't even recognize him.  Santana says that she doesn't know whether it's his whining or his lack of mohawk, but she's no longer turned on by him.  The nerds of the school are able to overthrow him and actually toss him into the dumpster (like he once did to them).   That's when it hits him: Mercedes was once unpopular, but now that she's a Cheerio she's all kinds of popular.  To rise back through the ranks of the school, he needs to date a Cheerio.\rRachel, meanwhile, tells Will that she needs to take her several vitamin supplements because she felt a tickle in the back of her throat and she's exhausted.  Every song she sings is a solo.  While she likes the spotlight, it's difficult for her to maintain...especially considering her recent mission. \n"}, {"text": "According to Rachel, which of these Glee Club members is not pulling their weight in rehearsals?", "correct": "Quinn", "options": ["Mercedes", "Artie", "Tina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn.\n\n\tTo prove that the other members of the club have not been pulling their weight, Rachel commissioned the president of the AV Club to bug their choir room.  Then, with her gathered evidence, she isolated the voices heard on her tapes and listed off those not participating in rehearsals (Finn, Quinn, Santana, Brittany, and Puck).  This list shocks Will as almost half of the entire club isn't actually practicing.\rPuck heads to Mercedes' locker with a proposition: the two of them hook up, Puck's status raises, and she gets him as arm candy.  Mercedes decides that it wouldn't work, after all, Puck knocked up Quinn and left her on her own.  As well, he's 'Top 40' material and she's 'Rhythm and Blues'; they don't actually jive well together. \n"}, {"text": "What song does Rachel decide to sing for the weekly assignment?", "correct": "\"The Climb\" - Miley Cyrus", "options": ["\"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\"", "\"Don't Rain on My Parade\" - Barbra Streisand", "\"Run Joey Run\" - David Geddes"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Climb\" - Miley Cyrus.\n\n\tWill and Rachel confront the rest of the kids in Glee about the lack of compassion as they gear up for finals.  Finn explains that the male leads have gone to Jesse and shaken his confidence, Santana says she's only there to look hot, Quinn's baby hormones are making her moody, and Brittany is frustrated by the amount of lyrics.  Will tells the kids their assignment.  Since they seem to have lost their voice, they each need to find a song that represents themselves and sing it in front of the club.\rKurt is thrilled.  His song choice is already set because he feels he knows his own range inside and out.  As he walks down the hall with Mercedes, he discovers his dad entering the school.  It turns out that he's actually there for Finn to take him to a major league game.  Kurt is disappointed that he wasn't invited.\rThe class gears up for its assignment and Rachel takes an early chance to prove herself with Miley Cyrus' \"The Climb\" which she claims is a song about overcoming obstacles.  In this case, the obstacles are the other members of Glee as they've been impeding their own chances for Regionals.  As she begins to sing, she hits several flat notes.  As it turns out, she's losing her voice, much to everyone's shock. \n"}, {"text": "Who uses \"Jessie's Girl\" as their song for their Glee Club assignment?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Puck", "Rachel", "Jesse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tSue finds Kurt in the halls and asks him about why he was absent for practice the previous day.  Kurt explains how he thinks he's losing his dad because of his sexuality, but Sue says he's too obsessed with the label of his preferences and he probably doesn't know what he wants.  Sue really doesn't care though and decides to leave the conversation.  Kurt gets an idea though, and when his dad gets home he finds that his son has donned more masculine cloths (plaid shirt, trucker's cap, jeans, etc.).  He's also decided to use \"Pink Houses\" by John Mellencamp as his Glee Club assignment choice despite the fact that he doesn't know what the song is about.\rFinn takes Rachel to a doctor's office and comforts her through her appointment.  The doctor recommends a tonsillectomy, but she doesn't want to harm her voice.  Finn says that he'll always like her despite what happens and that Jesse can't even help her out- after all, he's in San Diego with his Vocal Adrenaline friends for Spring Break.  Although Rachel says that she still has feelings for Jesse and has confidence that he feels the same about her, Finn gets his song idea for the club assignment: \"Jessie's Girl\" by Rick Springfield. \n"}, {"text": "Alongside whom does Puck sing his assignment song for the week?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Finn", "Artie", "Santana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tAfter Finn performs his song, Puck asks to present his selection for the club assignment of the week.  To woo Mercedes he picks out a jazzy number by Jewish, African-American performer Sammy Davis Jr., \"The Lady is a Tramp\".  It works.  As Puck swings his way through the song, Mercedes joins in and the two duet and dance in the choir room with one another. The song impresses the entire club and, most importantly, Mercedes herself.  The whole school sees Mercedes a bit differently after this performance and she's happy with it.  Quinn meets her outside her locker and although Mercedes expects criticism, Quinn says for her to go for it.  She does, however, restate the fact that Puck is using her and her popularity to protect himself. Mercedes is okay with this as she's just happy that anyone is interested in being with her.  Both of them, however, are concerned with Santana's reactions as she was the only one who was shocked and angered by Puck's performance in the choir room. \n"}, {"text": "Who admits to enjoying Kurt's performance of \"Pink Houses\"?", "correct": "Brittany", "options": ["Will", "Rachel", "Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrittany.\n\n\tNext on deck for performing is Kurt who stands up for the Glee Club to perform John Mellencamp's \"Pink Houses\".  No one really cares for his 'All-American' song and Will actually goes out of his way to say that Kurt misunderstood the assignment as it is \"not Kurt\".  The group needs Kurt to be Kurt, but he didn't really show himself.  After Kurt heads out, Brittany follows him and says that she liked his rendition of the Mellencamp song (which may not necessarily be a compliment...).  While she originally thought that he was a \"capital-G gay\", now that he isn't she'd like to have a perfect record and make out with every guy in the school.\rRachel, meanwhile, wanders the school extremely sick.  Finn calls her dramatic, but she can't help but feel sorry for herself claiming that like Tinkerbell, she needs applause to live.  He decides to have her meet an old friend of his. \n"}, {"text": "During this episode, Mercedes performs \"The Boy is Mine\" by Monica and Brandy alongside Santana.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tKurt and Brittany make out in Kurt's basement and Kurt actually asks her what it's like to kiss a boy.  She says it tastes like burgers...or her armpit.  When Kurt's dad comes home, he's surprised to find his son with a girl considering his sexual preferences and says that he's free to be whoever he wants.\rMercedes talks to Puck about what needs to happen.  Firstly, he has to stop talking about video games.  Secondly, he needs to know that she likes frozen coffee drinks.  As he goes to get her one, resident nerd Jacob proves that Puck's popularity is back on track because he's dating Mercedes.  As he continues onwards, Mercedes catches him looking at Santana and the two perform \"The Boy is Mine\" during class and into Glee Club.  This culminates to a quick fight in the choir room which Will has to break up before it gets out of hand. \n"}, {"text": "Why is Finn's friend, Sean, paralyzed?", "correct": "Football accident", "options": ["Fell off the school", "Car crash", "Paralyzed since birth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFootball accident.\n\n\tMercedes later spots Puck leading dumpster tossing in the school parking lot and he justifies his actions saying that it's what needs to be done to maintain order.  She isn't too thrilled.\rFinn and Rachel show up at his friend Sean's house.  His mother lets them in and they head up to his room for a talk.  Rachel discovers that Sean is paralyzed and unable to leave his bed.  Finn and Sean met at football camp many years earlier, but in a game shortly after, he was paralyzed in a football game from the upper chest down.  Like with Rachel's voice, Sean was angry with what he had lost- his body, his friends, his life.  However, he is good at other things, and he can get past what makes him miserable because he knows he has those.  Rachel thanks him for what he says to her. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Kurt perform \"Rose's Turn\" during this episode?", "correct": "The auditorium", "options": ["His bedroom", "The choir room", "The baseball diamond"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe auditorium.\n\n\tMercedes quits the Cheerios claiming that she never really fit in.  Sue is disappointed as their Whitney Houston number (in which Mercedes was set to do ten solid minutes of vocal runs) will need to be replaced.  Mercedes feels that she did the right thing as it makes her realize who she is.  She tells Puck that she doesn't like the mean version of him very much (and that he probably doesn't either).\rKurt and Brittany walk down the halls (to the surprise of others in Glee Club) until his dad reappears to say that he's taking Finn out for motocross and dinner.  Kurt is disappointed once more as he tried so hard to appeal to his father's ideas of the perfect son.  As his dad walks away he begins to sing \"Rose's Turn\" from \"Gypsy\".  This progresses to the auditorium and he performs the musical's final number in front of large illuminated letters of his name.  His dad catches the performance in the audience and applauds him.  He explains that they called off the dinner and that he's dumb, but he's not stupid.  He may have been occupied with Finn, but it's hard to work around their issues.  He's trying his hardest and he's trying not to hurt Kurt.  Kurt has been disappointed though and he says that he's going to work to make it work.  His dad tells him to stop because he just needs to be himself. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of the episode, who is not present to sing \"One\"?", "correct": "Jesse", "options": ["Puck", "Kurt", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJesse.\n\n\tRachel returns to visit Sean at his house and she reveals that she came alone to thank him.  Her voice is back (thanks to herbal remedies, antibiotics, and a vow of silence) and she's realized that she's good at more than just singing.  She says that she wants to return the favour by giving singing lessons once a week.  Eventually she'll need to have her tonsils out, but she's not scared to do it anymore.  The two of them decide to start their lessons immediately, and as she takes his hand they start to sing \"One\" by U2.\rNew Directions sings the song from their auditorium, each of them unique in their own way.  As the episode comes to a close, the group of them sings in unison and  Rachel and Sean duet the final words together. \n"}]}
