A champion poker player drops dead during a high-stakes game.  According to Gil Grissom (William Petersen), several items contributed to the man's death.  Which of the following was NOT one of them?", "correct": "a straw", "options": ["eye drops", "candy", "lead"], "explanation": "\n\n\na straw.\n\n\tThe poker player in question had been suffering from a low-grade form of lead poisoning for years thanks to a bullet in his leg that had never been removed.  He was famous for obsessively eating chocolate candy at the poker table, which, over time, exacerbated the lead poisoning.  When an angry waitress spiked his drink with eye drops in an attempt to give him diarrhea(!), a chemical called tetrahydrozaline in the drops pushed his already-elevated lead levels into overdrive, causing him to die almost instantly. \n"}, {"text": "The \"B\" story in episode 1 focuses on a murder that apprently took place during a high-speed drag race.  Which two CSI's raced against each other in an experiment designed to determine whether it was possible for one driver to shoot another while driving at extremely high speeds in the open desert?", "correct": "Catherine Willows and Nick Stokes", "options": ["Catherine Willows and Warrick Brown", "Warrick Brown and Sara Sidle", "Nick Stokes and Warrick Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatherine Willows and Nick Stokes.\n\n\tCatherine and Nick worked the case, and proved (via some \"Laser Tag\"-inspired hardware) that it was indeed possible to make the shot while racing at speeds in excess of 150 MPH. \n"}, {"text": "Which band makes a guest appearance as themselves in episode 2, \"The Accused Is Entitled\"?", "correct": "The Wallflowers", "options": ["The 5,6,7,8's", "The Donnas", "The Shins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wallflowers.\n\n\tJakob Dylan and his band are playing at the nightclub featured at the beginning of the episode.  They don't have any dialogue, but the name of their band is emblazoned on the front of the bass drum, so they are clearly playing themselves. \n"}, {"text": "Raymond J. Barry guest-stars in episode 2 as Gil Grissom's one-time mentor.  His character shares a name with a character from an older, classic television program.  Which one?", "correct": "The Fugitive", "options": ["Barney Miller", "Dragnet", "Gunsmoke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fugitive.\n\n\tGil's ex-mentor is named Philip Gerard -- the name of the man who pursued Dr. Richard Kimble in \"The Fugitive,\" the incredibly popular TV show that ran from 1963-1967.  The final episode of that show was, at the time, the most-watched TV event in history.\r The \"CSI\" writers have proven in their commentary tracks that they are quite knowledgeable about television history, so I doubt that this reference was an accident. \n"}, {"text": "Grissom's mentor spends a lot of time and effort in episode 2 trying to discredit the CSI team during an important case.  His knowledge of the team is extensive, and he feeds the defense attorney certain \"skeletons in the closet\" that she uses to blindside the CSI's in open court.  Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Nick Stokes' having been sexually molested as a child", "options": ["Catherine Willows' past as an exotic dancer", "Sara Sidle's attraction to Gil Grissom", "Warrick Brown's gambling addiction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNick Stokes' having been sexually molested as a child.\n\n\tWarrick's gambling problem and Catherine's past were pretty predictable, since their histories are common knowledge to fans of the show.  I was surprised, though, to see the defense attorney try to accuse Sara of professional impropriety by asking her about her relationship with Grissom.  Apparently, Gerard picked up on the \"unrequited love\" thing that Sara has for Gil, and jumped on it!\r Nick Stokes is indeed a survivor of sexual abuse, but Philip Gerard apparently never discovered that -- in fact, the only person on the show who seems to know about it is Catherine. \n"}, {"text": "In episode 3, \"Let the Seller Beware,\" Grissom discovers an unusual fungus near the swimming pool of a woman who was murdered in her home.  He decides to conduct an experiment on a member of his team to confirm a suspicion he has about the fungus in question.  Who winds up with a fungal infection as a result of this experiment?", "correct": "Greg Sanders", "options": ["Dr. Albert Robbins", "Warrick Brown", "Nick Stokes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreg Sanders.\n\n\tSanders (the DNA lab tech played by Eric Szmanda) is of Norwegian descent, as is the man Grissom suspects of murder.  Since the fungal infection in question is common among Norwegians, Grissom uses Sanders as his guinea pig, intentionally infecting one of his feet with the same fungus found at the crime scene! \n"}, {"text": "The grisly \"B\" story of episode 3 centers on Sara Sidle, as she looks for the teenager who -- wait for it -- disemboweled a classmate with his or her teeth during a PCP-addled frenzy.  Sara is able to locate the killer(s) quickly due to the fact that the victim suffered from a particular ailment that was passed on to the killer(s) at the time of...well, ingestion.  Which one?", "correct": "an E. coli infection", "options": ["HIV", "a salmonella infection", "tuberculosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nan E. coli infection\n\n\tI'm not sure if it was ever explained how the victim got the E. coli infection -- \"unsanitary conditions...or a bad burger\" is all that's said about it -- but the teenagers who ate her flesh became extremely ill from the same infection in less than 24 hours.  E. coli is nasty stuff, folks! \n"}, {"text": "Episode 4, \"A Little Murder,\" concerns the death of a dwarf.  True or False:  This man was killed by another dwarf.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe victim was engaged to a woman who, despite being the daughter of two \"little people\", was of perfectly average human height.  This woman's father killed her fiancee since he refused to stand by and allow his \"normal\" child to marry a dwarf! \n"}, {"text": "In the \"B\" story of \"A Little Murder\", a member of the CSI team is attacked at a seemingly safe crime scene, and actually \"becomes\" evidence thanks to a brief physical struggle with the killer who is still at the scene.  Which one?", "correct": "Catherine", "options": ["Sara", "Nick", "Gil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatherine.\n\n\tCatherine is jumped by the killer, and winds up offering up her clothes in the hopes of getting the man's DNA from it.  The man is eventually caught when the fingerprint powder from Catherine's kit is detected in the nostrils of one of the suspects in an impromptu line-up. \n"}, {"text": "Episode 5, \"Abra Cadaver,\" re-unites actor William Petersen (Grissom) with one of his co-stars from the 1986 motion picture \"Manhunter\" (that would be the GOOD version of \"Red Dragon\" for you newbies).  Which one?", "correct": "Tom Noonan", "options": ["Dennis Farina", "Kim Greist", "Brian Cox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Noonan.\n\n\tTom Noonan, who played serial killer Francis Dolarhyde in the superlative \"Manhunter,\" plays magician/murderer Zephyr in this episode.  As a big fan of that movie, I really enjoyed seeing these two adversaries face-to-face again. \n"}, {"text": "Episode 6, \"The Execution of Catherine Willows,\" concerns a death row inmate whom Willows' findings helped to put away many years ago.  Which character admits to being a proponent of the death penalty?", "correct": "Warrick", "options": ["Jim Brass", "Sara", "Nick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarrick.\n\n\tCatherine asks Warrick if he is for or against the death penalty.  \"Pro,\" Warrick says, \"if he did it.  The application sucks, though.  There's a lot of brown skin in that room.\" \n"}, {"text": "Episode 6 features a rare sight for this show:  evidence being processed not at the familiar CSI lab, but at a faraway federal facility.  Where is the Mitochondrial DNA Lab that is shown working on evidence from Catherine's 15-year-old case throughout the episode?", "correct": "Norfolk, VA", "options": ["Washington, DC", "Baltimore, MD", "Philadelphia, PA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorfolk, VA.\n\n\tNo fewer than five times during the episode, we're shown a title card that reads \"Mitochondrial DNA Lab -- Norfolk, VA\".  Apparently, they provide services that the Vegas crime lab can't. \n"}, {"text": "Some things happen in the final minutes of episode 6 that don't happen very often on \"CSI\".  Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Catherine cries.", "options": ["The murderer being sought is never apprehended.", "Grissom is shown drinking alcohol.", "A criminal is executed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatherine cries.\n\n\tGrissom and company learn that, while the death row inmate was in fact responsible for one murder, he was actually a copycat, and not the serial killer everytone thought he was.  The original killer is still at large...and by the end of the episode, Grissom (while helping Jim Brass work through a bottle of scotch) admits that he has no idea who or where this killer is!\r The man Catherine put away is executed via lethal injection at the end of the episode...and while she certainly looks conflicted about it, she doesn't actually cry. \n"}, {"text": "Episode 7, \"Fight Night,\" keeps the entire CSI team pretty busy -- three crimes occur at almost exactly the same time during their night shift.  Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "A casino owner's child is kidnapped.", "options": ["A boxer is killed in the ring.", "A jewelry store is robbed.", "A gang shooting breaks out in the street."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA casino owner's child is kidnapped.\n\n\tNick handles the jewelry heist, Catherine looks into the gang shooting, and the rest of the team sticks with the high-profile \"dead boxer\" case.  (I made up the kidnapping.) \n"}, {"text": "It's revealed in \"Fight Night\" that one of the characters boxed as a young man.  Which one?", "correct": "Warrick Brown", "options": ["Archie Johnson", "Nick Stokes", "Albert Robbins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarrick Brown.\n\n\tWarrick even gloves up to help Grissom with a \"punching power\"  experiment late in the episode.\r Much more to come -- we're not even a third of the way through the season! -- so stay tuned for part two. \n"}]}
