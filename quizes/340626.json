The drinking starts to get a bit out of hand and after a quick game of spin the bottle, Rachel finds a duet partner in Blaine.  The two of them take to the stage in her dads' Oscar party room to sing \"Don't You Want Me\" by The Human League while the others sing and dance drunkenly in front.\rThe original version of \"Don't You Want Me\" was released in 1981 on The Human League's \"Dare\" album and it's one of their most well-known singles.  It reached the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 in the following year.  This was also the top-selling song from the \"Blame It on the Alcohol\" episode; the \"Glee\" version, included in \"Glee: The Music, Volume 5\" reached number forty-nine on the same chart. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these New Directions members throws up during the performance of \"Tik Tok\" in \"Blame It on the Alcohol\"?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Rachel", "Tina", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\t\"Tik Tok\" was Ke$ha's first major hit.  Released in 2009 on her debut album, \"Animal\", the song hit number one on two Billboard charts (including the Hot 100) and topped the Billboard End-of-the-Year chart for 2010.  The \"Glee\" version reached number sixty-one on the Hot 100 though it never appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 5\".\rFor their big performance at McKinley High's alcohol awareness assembly, the New Directions perform Ke$ha's \"Tik Tok\" for the school with Brittany singing and dancing in the lead.  To ease themselves into their performance, however, they drink a horrible concoction of leftover booze, Oreos, and cough syrup and both Brittany and Santana throw up mid-song.  It certainly makes the school aware of alcohol. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Will and Beiste perform \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\" in \"Blame It on the Alcohol\"?", "correct": "A cowboy-themed bar", "options": ["The school auditorium", "A roller-disco", "A piano bar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cowboy-themed bar.\n\n\tWhen Beiste tells Will he needs to loosen up she invites him to Rosalita's Roadhouse, a honky-tonk cowboy-themed bar in Lima.  Here, he downs a number of drinks before joining Beiste onstage for a performance of \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\" by George Thorogood.  The song proves to be a hit.  This also happens to be Coach Beiste's first performance on \"Glee\".\r\"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\" neither appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 nor on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 5\".  The original, however, made a lasting appearance in George Thorogood's discography; along with \"Bad to the Bone\" it's one of his most famous hits with The Destroyers. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Sexy\", Will duets with Holly Holiday for what Prince song?", "correct": "Kiss", "options": ["Little Red Corvette", "Party Like It's 1999", "When Doves Cry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKiss.\n\n\t\"Kiss\" was originally on Prince's \"Parade\" album and it hit number one on three different Billboard charts upon its release in 1986, also winning a Grammy.  The \"Glee\" version appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 5\" but only reached number eighty-three on the 'Hot 100'.\rWill, in an attempt to portray sexiness to the Glee Club, decides to turn Prince's \"Kiss\" into a tango and he seeks a partner in Holly Holliday, who's returned to teach sex-ed at McKinley in this episode.  After their dance, the two of them kiss and she decides she can't be in a relationship with him.  She switches her decision at the end of the episode. \n"}, {"text": "Santana sings Stevie Nicks' \"Landslide\" during \"Sexy\" and dedicates it to which Glee Club member?", "correct": "Brittany", "options": ["Puck", "Sam", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrittany.\n\n\tIn order to come to terms with her true feelings toward Brittany, Santana asks Holly to help sing \"Landslide\" in the choir room.  The emotional performance allows her to open up to her friend and express the truth, that she loves her.  The song marks a start to Santana's coming out as a lesbian character.  Of course, Brittany still wants to be with Artie because she loves him as well.\r\"Landslide\" was originally part of the Fleetwood Mac discography but many attribute the more-popular live version solely to vocalist Stevie Nicks.  It's also been covered in the past by The Smashing Pumpkins and The Dixie Chicks.  The \"Glee\" version was the first Fleetwood Mac song to appear on the show and it was the highest-charting single of the episode reaching number twenty-three on the Billboard Hot 100.  It features the vocals of Santana, Brittany, and Holly and it did show on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 5\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of these groups performs \"Afternoon Delight\" during \"Sexy\"?", "correct": "The Celibacy Club", "options": ["The Cheerios", "New Directions", "Dalton Academy Warblers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Celibacy Club.\n\n\tThis was the only song from the episode not to chart although it did make an appearance on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 5\". The original, released by Starland Vocal Band in 1976, hit number one on the Hot 100 in the same year.  This was the last song of the season to feature both Emma and Carl.\rBecause Holly Holliday's sex-ed teaching methods are not to her liking, Emma decides to put her own spin on sex by having the Celibacy Club perform its own song and dance routine to the Starland Vocal Band song \"Afternoon Delight\".  The plan backfires when she is told that the song isn't about desserts (as she thought) but about sex.  The song is performed by Emma, Carl, Puck, Quinn, and Rachel. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these original songs was not performed by a New Directions member in \"Original Song\"?", "correct": "My Headband", "options": ["Big Ass Heart", "Trouty Mouth", "Hell to the No"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Headband.\n\n\tA particular perk of this episode is the amount of new, original songs created by McKinley's Glee Club heading into Regionals.  In an attempt to be original, Santana sings \"Trouty Mouth\" (about Sam), Puck sings \"Big Ass Heart\" (about Lauren), and Mercedes sings her own \"Hell to the No\".  None of these songs, they decide, makes the cut for Regionals.  \"My Headband\" was performed by Rachel during \"Blame It on the Alcohol\" but it wasn't that great.  She follows it up in this episode with \"Only Child\".\r\"Hell to the No\" was the only one of these songs to chart.  It reached number fifty-three on the Hot 100.  None of these songs appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 5\". \n"}, {"text": "During their Regionals performance, the Dalton Academy Warblers sing which song by P!nk?", "correct": "Raise Your Glass", "options": ["Get This Party Started", "So What", "Stupid Girls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaise Your Glass.\n\n\t\"Raise Your Glass\" was released by P!nk in 2010 becoming yet another number one hit for the artist.  The song reached the top of three different Billboard charts including the Hot 100.  The \"Glee\" version appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Presents the Warblers\" and reached number thirty-six on the 'Hot 100'.\rThe Warblers started their Regionals setlist with a duet; Kurt and Blaine partnered together to sing \"Candles\" by Hey Monday.  After this, Blaine led the Warblers through a rendition of P!nk's \"Raise Your Glass\" which received a great deal of applause from the crowd.  During this episode, the Warblers also performed Maroon 5's \"Misery\" and \"Blackbird\" by The Beatles. \n"}, {"text": "\"Get It Right\" was composed by Rachel and Quinn during \"Original Song\".", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlthough Quinn originally sets out to pair up with Rachel to write the song, she takes the opportunity to criticize her and set the record straight about herself and Finn.  The emotional damage wreaked havoc on Rachel and allowed her to write the song she truly needed.  Her song, \"Get It Right\", was the first to be performed for the New Directions' Regionals setlist and she aimed the song at Finn.\r\"Get It Right\" was an original song written especially for \"Glee\".  It appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 5\" and hit number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100. \n"}, {"text": "What was the second song on the New Directions Regional setlist in \"Original Song\"?", "correct": "Loser Like Me", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoser Like Me.\n\n\tFueled by some of the hurtful things said by Sue and others over the past year, the kids of New Directions write \"Loser Like Me\" for their second song at Regionals and win the competition with it.  Unsurprisingly, the song is a big hit with the audience and the judges alike and they advance onward to Nationals.\r\"Loser Like Me\" was yet another original song created for \"Glee\".  This upbeat track taken on by all of New Directions ended up reaching a peak of number six on the Billboard Hot 100, the cast's second-highest position to date (after \"Don't Stop Believin'\").  It also appeared as the final song on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 5\". \n"}]}
