{"id": "302453", "name": "The British Open : 1990s Quiz | Tournaments | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "Tournaments", "   British Open"], "questions": [{"text": "Having alredy won the Masters in April, Nick Faldo won his second major of 1990 when he won the British Open at which course? ", "correct": "Old Course, St Andrews", "options": ["Muirfield", "Royal Troon", "Royal Birkdale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOld Course, St Andrews.\n\n\tFaldo was neck-and-neck with Greg Norman after 36 holes at St Andrews, but took control on day three, and eventually finished the tournament five shots ahead of Payne Stewart and Mark McNulty. Three months earlier, Faldo had won his second successive Masters at Augusta after defeating Ray Floyd in a playoff. \n"}, {"text": "Which Australian golfer won his first-ever major at the 1991 British Open? ", "correct": "Ian Baker-Finch", "options": ["Rodger Davis", "Craig Parry", "Wayne Grady"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIan Baker-Finch.\n\n\tBaker-Finch had led the 1984 Open after three rounds, before a disastrous last round at St Andrews. In 1991, at Royal Birkdale, he made amends by finishing two shots ahead of Mike Harwood. \n"}, {"text": "Nick Faldo won his third Claret Jug in 1992 at Muirfield, finishing the tournament a single shot ahead of which American player?", "correct": "John Cook", "options": ["Chip Beck", "Fred Couples", "Steve Pate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Cook.\n\n\tFaldo held a four shot lead over Cook with nine holes left to play on the final day, but an amazing turnaround saw a six-shot swing with Cook two shots ahead with holes running out. Faldo managed to get his game back together just in time to finish one shot better than the American and win the title for the third time. \n"}, {"text": "Nick Faldo looked likely to successfully defend his title in 1993 at Sandwich, but a superb final round of 64 saw which Australian snatch the title?", "correct": "Greg Norman", "options": ["Wayne Grady", "Ian Baker-Finch", "Robert Allenby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreg Norman.\n\n\tFaldo, who had shot a 63 on day two, held a one-shot lead over Norman going into the final round.

", "correct": "Costantino Rocca", "options": ["Bernhard Langer", "Darren Clarke", "Anders Forsbrand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCostantino Rocca.\n\n\tRocca holed an amazing birdie putt from the Valley of Sin in front of the 18th green at St Andrews to force the play-off, but failed to repeat his heroics in extra time, big-hitting Daly winning his first major since the 1991 US PGA Championship. \n"}, {"text": "Royal Lytham and St Annes had been an unlucky course for American golfers, nobody from the USA having won there since Bobby Jones in 1926.

The tournament was eventually won by Mark O'Meara, who defeated which other American player in a four-hole playoff? ", "correct": "Brian Watts", "options": ["Tiger Woods", "Davis Love III", "Loren Roberts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrian Watts.\n\n\tWatts led the field by two shots after three rounds, but O'Meara shot a 68 to tie him and force the playoff. The 41-year old O'Meara played the extra holes in two fewer shots than Watts to add the Claret Jug to the 1998 Masters title that he had won that April. \n"}, {"text": "The final Open of the 90s, the 1999 event at Carnoustie, was won by Scotsman Paul Lawrie, but will probably always be remembered for the astonishing late collapse of which French player at the 72nd hole?", "correct": "Jean Van de Velde", "options": ["Thomas Levet", "Jean-Francois Remesy", "Marc Farry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJean Van de Velde.\n\n\tVan de Velde held a three shot lead as he stood on the 18th tee on the final day, but conspired to take seven shots at the par 4 hole, during which he took his socks and shoes off to play a shot from the burn (thankfully he was persuaded by his caddy to take a penalty drop instead!). This amazing collapse allowed Lawrie and Justin Leonard to join the Frenchman in a four hole playoff for the title, and it was the Scotsman who prevailed to become the first winner from the \"home of golf\" since Sandy Lyle in 1985. \n"}]}
