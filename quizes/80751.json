{"id": "80751", "name": "Hammer and other Euro-Horror Online Trivia | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these was an Italian horror film starring Christopher Lee?", "correct": "What?, or The Body and the Whip", "options": ["Horror Express", "I, Monster", "The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhat?, or The Body and the Whip.\n\n\tLee said this was the best of his Italian films. He was probably right! The other films all star Lee, but they are not Italian. \n"}, {"text": "In which film did Lee portray the notorious Judge Jeffreys who sought out and burned witches on behalf of James II?", "correct": "Night of the Blood Monster", "options": ["The Conquerer Worm", "Witchfinder General", "Burn, Witch, Burn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight of the Blood Monster.\n\n\tThis was the lousy American title given to this movie (because we're so unintellectual!). The original titles are \"The Bloody Judge\" or \"The Witch Killer of Blackmoor.\" \"Witchfinder General\" and \"The Conquerer Worm\" are two titles for the same film that stars Vincent Price as another witchkiller during the time of the English Civil War. \"Burn, Witch, Burn\" is an excellent psychological thriller about a man who does not realize his wife is a witch. \n"}, {"text": "In the sixties, Hammer's rival Amicus came up with their \"anthology series\" of films that linked several short horror stories together through the use of one unrelated central theme. Which of these films was NOT one of those?", "correct": "Tales of Terror", "options": ["The House That Dripped Blood", "Asylum", "Torture Garden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTales of Terror.\n\n\t\"Tales of Terror\" was made for AI by Roger Corman as part of his Poe series. \n"}, {"text": "After the success of \"Psycho\" and \"Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?\", Hammer launched a number of \"psychological horror films\" in the Hitchcock-Castle vein.

Which of these was NOT one of those?", "correct": "Asylum", "options": ["Nightmare", "Crescendo", "Paranoic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsylum.\n\n\t\"Asylum\" was one of the Amicus films that featured a number of short stories. I consider \"Paranoic\" to possibly be the best film Hammer studios made. A must see! Others in the series include \"Maniac\", \"Hysteria\", \"The Nanny\", \"Fear in the Night\" and \"Taste of Fear\". \n"}, {"text": "Which excellent Hammer film featured Peter Cushing as Captain Clegg, an 18th-century pirate who leads the villagers of the town they inhabit out on smuggling raids disguised as ghosts?", "correct": "Night Creatures", "options": ["The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh", "The Devil Ship Pirates", "Twins of Evil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight Creatures.\n\n\tAnother must see. \"Romney Marsh\" was a Disney version of the same story. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these British horror films was NOT based on a true story?", "correct": "The Horrible Dr. Orloff", "options": ["The Stranglers of Bombay", "The Flesh and the Fiends, or Mania", "Countess Dracula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Horrible Dr. Orloff\n\n\t\"The Stranglers\" was a true account of a ruthless religious cult in India. \"Mania\" was based on the graverobbing exploits of Burke and Hare.

Lee also played the Count in the non-Hammer films \"My Uncle Was a Vampire\" and \"Dracula and Son\". \n"}]}
