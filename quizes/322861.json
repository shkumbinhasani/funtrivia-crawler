Who plays Bill in the films?", "correct": "David Carradine", "options": ["Brad Pitt", "Michael Madsen", "Cheech Marin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Carradine.\n\n\tStarring Uma Thurman as 'The Bride', the first film follows the main character as she begins crossing names off her list of people to exact her revenge upon.  See, Bill and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (three women and one man, a group of trained assassins) walked in on her wedding day and killed the entire chapel before leaving her for dead.  Waking up from a coma, The Bride vowed to take the lives of those involved in killing her husband and unborn child.  Bill, played by David Carradine, has some cards up his sleeve though.\rQuentin Tarantino split this film into two parts, both released six months apart.  With revenge as its main theme, Tarantino explores many different styles of film from martial arts fare to the spaghetti western and more.  Both films have consistently appeared on the IMDB Top 250.  Tarantino has also filmed and directed \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Inglourious Basterds\", and \"Reservoir Dogs\" to critical acclaim.  \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" and \"Vol. 2\" are no exception to this trend.\r Crafted by a film-going Kyleisalive \n"}, {"text": "A classic literary tale of revenge is \"Moby Dick\" by Herman Melville.

What happened at the end of Moby Dick?", "correct": "Moby Dick sinks the Pequod and kills Ahab", "options": ["Ahab kills Moby Dick", "Moby Dick eludes Ahab", "Everybody dies, including the whale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoby Dick sinks the Pequod and kills Ahab.\n\n\tAfter finding the whale and chasing it for three days Ahab spots Moby Dick from atop the main mast and sinks a harpoon in it.  The whale slams into the Pequod.  The harpoon's rope gets wound around Ahab and the whale pulls him and the ship down.  The only survivor is Ishmael, the narrator.\rPerhaps Ahab should have abandoned the idea of revenge.  As one crewman warned him: \"See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou that madly seekest him!\" \r Crafted by Captain Deputygary \n"}, {"text": "Was this revenge or retribution? A group of boys taunt the Old Testament prophet Elisha with claims that he is folically challenged (aka bald as a coot!). What happened to them as Elisha had his revenge?", "correct": "They were mauled by bears", "options": ["They were eaten by termites", "They were abducted by angels", "They were taken away as slaves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey were mauled by bears.\n\n\t\"From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. \"Go on up, you baldhead!\" they said. \"Go on up, you baldhead!\" He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.\" (2 Kings 2 v. 23-24 NIV translation)\r One of the harder bible passages for commentators to interpret! \r Crafted by a hirsute and bear-loving Glendathecat \n"}, {"text": "Wanda the fish met a tragic end in the aptly named \"A Fish Called Wanda\", but Wanda's owner, Ken had his revenge.

Which Italian philosopher advised that \"Men should be either treated generously or destroyed, because they take revenge for slight injuries - for heavy ones they cannot\"?", "correct": "Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli", "options": ["Dante Alighieri", "Jean-Jacques Rousseau", "Thomas Aquinas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli.\n\n\tNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli made this statement in \"The Prince\". It is a political treatise, which advises a prince on how best to rule. In it, Machiavelli counsels that such a ruler should have an appealing public persona at the same time as using deception, deceit and cunning behind the scenes to ensure his position of power.  \"The Prince\" is significant as a work that approached politics with realism rather than idealism. It is this work that essentially led to the term 'Machiavellian' as a description for people who use deception and guile to achieve their own ends.\rThomas Aquinas was an Italian Catholic priest and philosopher and Dante Alighieri is an Italian writer, famous for \"Inferno\".  Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a French philosopher who, interestingly, interpreted \"The Prince\" as a satire, basing his reasons for this on Machiavelli's other works which were much more 'republican' in tone. \r Crafted by a philosophical EmmaF2008 \n"}, {"text": "In what song did Mary Anne and Wanda get their revenge with a plate of black-eyed peas?", "correct": "\"Goodbye Earl\" by the Dixie Chicks", "options": ["\"Boom Boom Pow\" by the Black Eyed Peas", "\"Goober Peas\" by the Kingston Trio", "\"Don't Break My Heart Again\" by Whitesnake"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Goodbye Earl\" by the Dixie Chicks.\n\n\tThe single \"Goodbye Earl\" was a big success for the Dixie Chicks even with its controversial treatment of domestic violence resolved with some justifiable homicide.

The Ancient Mariner shoots the bird and the Albatross takes its revenge- the ship is becalmed with \"water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink\" and terrible things are seen upon the ocean. The crew blames the Ancient Mariner and they hang the dead bird around his neck but terrible things are yet to come as a ghost ship arrives, manned by Death and Night-mare Life-in-Death. Death wins the souls of the crew in a game of dice but the Ancient Mariner's fate is far worse as he is forced never to die but to wander the earth telling his story as a lesson to anyone who will listen.\r Crafted by a thirsty Flopsymopsy \n"}, {"text": "In Norse mythology, which \"brother\" of Odin was, as a result of his many malicious activities against the gods, bound to a rock and forced to endure the dripping of a snake's venom on his face? ", "correct": "Loki", "options": ["Honir", "Ve", "Vili"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoki.\n\n\tWhereas some sources claim Loki to be the biological brother of Odin and one of three sons of Borr, others say that he was not even of the race of the gods. While the latter may be true - Loki seemingly not to belong to any fixed race on Earth - he and Odin certainly were, in a sense, brothers. This allegiance between the two often acted as a safety line for Loki in the face of hostility from the other gods.\r In the beginning, Loki's actions were simply mischievous (e.g. stealing Freya's necklace), however he became noticeably more evil as Ragnarok (the final battle) approached. His part in killing Balder (Odin's beloved son) and his lack of remorse for the deed was the last straw for the gods who tracked Loki down and bound him to a rock. A snake was also held above him and the venom which dripped from its fangs fell onto Loki's face.\r Crafted by doublemm \n"}, {"text": "What does the Bible say about revenge?  In Matthew 5:38 of the New International Version it says: \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'\"  What does the next verse say?\n", "correct": "If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.", "options": ["It is mine to avenge; I will repay,", "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's.", "Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome wife."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIf someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.\n\n\tPeople seem to think that the Bible promotes \"an eye for an eye\" but in actuality in Matthew and many other books the New Testament advise a person to let perceived or real offenses be unavenged.  In fact Matthew 5 goes on to say: \"And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.\"  And: \"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\"  Matthew 5 is also, along with Luke 6, where the Beatitudes are found.\r Crafted by Deputygary \n"}, {"text": "Proverbially, what is the best way to serve up revenge?", "correct": "Cold", "options": ["Steaming right from the fire", "Warmed up", "With a side of llama cutlet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCold.\n\n\tThe phrase \"Revenge is a dish best served cold\" has been attributed to many different sources including Shakespeare, Afghan sayings, and \"Old Klingon Proverb\" (from \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\").  Wikipedia cites the earliest written record as being the 1841 novel \"Mathilde\" by Marie Joseph Eug\u00e8ne Sue.
