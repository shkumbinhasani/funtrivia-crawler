The music video, directed by \"I Am Legend\" director Francis Lawrence, also promoted Gaga's notorious fashion styles.  The video featured a pair of razor-blade sunglasses, Gaga's personalized earbud brand, and an outfit created to look like a gyroscope (which she would later wear live during a \"Saturday Night Live\" performance).\rGaga later released \"Telephone\" and \"Alejandro\" as singles in 2010 to similar success.\r \"Bad Romance\" was a song title recommended by Runaway_Drive. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these songs, found on the band's 1989 album \"Pump\", was performed by Aerosmith?", "correct": "Don't Get Mad, Get Even", "options": ["Love Shack", "Born to Run", "Sympathy for the Devil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon't Get Mad, Get Even.\n\n\t\"Pump\" was one of the band's most famous albums and as a result it was not short on hits.
