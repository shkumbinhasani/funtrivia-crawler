By the way, the answer to that question is the following: Ginny, Demelza, and the two Beaters. Team members who each sit out at least one game are Ron, Harry, and Katie Bell. Dean Thomas and Cormac McLaggen play as substitutes. \n"}, {"text": "Why is it a good idea to omit questions such as those I've complained about in Items 1-9? ", "correct": "all of these reasons are valid ones", "options": ["because such questions might be against quiz-making rules", "because such questions irritate many players", "because such questions make quizzes too challenging for some players"], "explanation": "\n\n\nall of these reasons are valid ones.\n\n\tIf I take a quiz that has two or more questions like the ones I've been complaining about, I usually rate it \"Poor\" (unless the rest of it is absolutely wonderful). \r Sorry to seem like such a crank, and thanks for taking the quiz!
