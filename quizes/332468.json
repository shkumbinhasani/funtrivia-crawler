Lots of knights (paladins) probably disappeared from chess sets during the show's run to spark kids' role play. \n"}, {"text": "Nick Adams had the lead role for this series titled 'The Rebel' portraying which character?", "correct": "Johnny Yuma", "options": ["Mark McCain", "Bart Maverick", "Will Sonnett"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Yuma.\n\n\tNick was able to claim close friends with two icons of his time, Elvis Presley and James Dean, due in part to fame from this role.
