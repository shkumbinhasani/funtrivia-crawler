The French believed that they could form a trade route up the Mekong, but they eventually found that the series of rapids along the great river made this impossible. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these did not characterize colonial rule in Laos?", "correct": "Massive building of infrastructure", "options": ["Massive Vietnamese in-migration", "Growth in opium production", "Underdevelopment in public education"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMassive building of infrastructure.\n\n\tThe French, believing Laos to essentially be a backwater, only useful as a buffer zone between Vietnam and Thailand, tended to neglect Laos. Vietnamese were educated and employed as administrators in the region, and a great many came to settle in Laos. The Lao people were not given the same educational opportunities as the Vietnamese, and infrastructure in the country was also ignored. The one growth area in the Lao economy was in the opium trade, despite French attempts in curtailing such activities. \n"}, {"text": "Two of the great rebellions against colonial rule came via the leadership of two Lao heroes.

The result for the Hmong was that, following the war, they became a people with no land. Thousands and thousands of Hmong were re-situated in the United States, where a rather large Hmong community exists to this day. \n"}, {"text": "On August 23 1975 the establishment of the new, socialist Lao state was announced at the capital of Vieng Chan (Vientiane). The communist party, by this time, had been renamed using what acronmym?", "correct": "LPRP", "options": ["LCC", "LARC", "LCMN"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLPRP.\n\n\tThe LPRP, or Lao People's Revolutionary Party, sprung out of the former Pathet Lao.

While Laos has been 'opened up' to the outside world economically, a new level of Thai economic domination has began to surface, very much a concern to the Laotian people. Laos has spent much of its history either being politically dominated or under the direct control of other powers, so these fears are by no means unfounded. It remains to be seen what the future holds for Laos. \n"}]}
