What's the name of this dragon?", "correct": "Volvagia", "options": ["Morpha", "Dodongo", "Twinrova"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVolvagia.\n\n\tA classic boss from a classic game, Volvagia hides in the final chamber of the Fire Temple, the second of five temple dungeons visited by Link seven years into the future in \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" (N64).  Volvagia has the ability to fly out from lava holes in the battleground and head into the air dropping fire bombs onto the ground below, but with careful timing and the proper swings, Link can make short work of this fiery dragon and quell the fires of Death Mountain to save Goron City's inhabitants and claim the Fire Medallion from his spiritual brother, Darunia, the Sage of Fire. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Banjo-Tooie\", giving Humba Wumba a Mega-Glowbo will allow her to transform Kazooie into a dragon.  What type of animal was Kazooie before this?", "correct": "Breegull", "options": ["Bear", "Dinosaur", "Ottsel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBreegull.\n\n\tAlthough you could spend the entire game of \"Banjo-Tooie\" (N64) playing with the normal bear-bird duo of Banjo and Kazooie, where would the fun be in not claiming the Mega-Glowbo from the safe in Cloud Cuckooland (accessed from Glitter Gulch Mine) and transforming Kazooie into a scaly, green dragon at Humba Wumba's hut outside Witchyworld's entrance in the Isle O' Hags?  Unlike the normal Breegull form of Kazooie, Banjo can grab his trusty companion and she'll shoot a stream of fire from her mouth to set enemies ablaze. You can switch back and forth between Kazooie's two forms at will as long as you jump back into Humba's pool. Kazooie will also appear in dragon form in cinematics if this form is selected. \n"}, {"text": "A band with a particularly dragon-themed name created the final track played during the credits of \"Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock\".  What band, famous after their appearance in the game, created the difficult \"Through the Fire and Flames\" track?", "correct": "DragonForce", "options": ["Dragon Legion", "Dragonheart", "The Magic Dragon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDragonForce.\n\n\tAfter the popularity of Buckethead's difficult song in \"Guitar Hero II\", \"Jordan\", RedOctane added \"Through the Fire and Flames\" into \"Guitar Hero III\" not as a part of the main setlist, but as a song unlocked after a playthrough of the game.  Upon finishing the final songs, you'd be guided into the end credits during which you can play along (without scoring) to what many rhythm game players considered the most difficult song to appear in-game thus far. Their complex songs have led DragonForce to a bit of fame in the gaming community and they've received a gold record in sales because of their appearance in the series. The song was remade with updated features (ie. vocals, drums, etc.) for \"Guitar Hero Smash Hits\" and also appeared in the rock-themed game \"Brutal Legend\". \n"}, {"text": "In \"Pokemon\", the dragon-type Pokemon Dratini evolves into Dragonair.  What does Dragonair evolve into?", "correct": "Dragonite", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDragonite.\n\n\tPlayers of \"Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow\" will always find that Dratini, Dragonair, and Dragonite will appear in the last few slots of the Pokedex due to their strength and rarity.  Dratini can be found in the Safari Zone north of Fuchsia City in these original three games (as can Dragonair, but only in \"Yellow\").  Dratini evolves into Dragonair at level 30 while Dragonair becomes Dragonite at level 55, the highest level at which a Pokemon could naturally evolve (without trading or stones) in the original trilogy.  Since they are dragon-type Pokemon they can learn moves like Dragon Rage \n"}, {"text": "Players venturing into this dragon's lair in \"World of Warcraft\" (PC) would need to be in a raid group.  What is the name of this dragon, the leader of the Black Dragonflight, seen in the game since the original release?", "correct": "Onyxia", "options": ["Tyrygosa", "Sindragosa", "Malygos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnyxia.\n\n\tOriginally, Onyxia's Lair was a fairly reputable forty-man raid dungeon from the earliest days of \"World of Warcraft\" designed for the top tier of players looking to improve armour and be elite.  As time went on, new patches and expansions were added to the game to make Onyxia's Lair not only irrelevant, but unvisited, so over later revamps, Onyxia's Lair became a ten and twenty-five-man dungeon.  Here, players test their mettle against a giant black dragon by the name of Onyxia whose whelplings and fire can best even the brightest warriors of a level-range.  Although all of the other dragons have appeared in the game over the years, none have been so prevalent and famous as Onyxia.\rSindragosa comes from the Icecrown Citadel raid of \"Wrath of the Lich King\", Malygos is in the Eye of Eternity in the same expansion, and Tyrygosa appeared in later updates for \"The Burning Crusade\". \n"}, {"text": "\"Kingdom Hearts II\" featured a world called 'Land of the Dragons' based on which Disney movie?", "correct": "Mulan", "options": ["The Jungle Book", "Pete's Dragon", "Fantasia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMulan.\n\n\tOne of the earliest stages of the game (after a lengthy session of storyline with Roxas), the Land of the Dragons stage is pulled directly from the late 1990s Disney film \"Mulan\".  Mulan, as 'Ping', joins your party for battles across mountainscapes, Chinese forests, and the Emperor's Palace as you fight to stop the Huns from invading.  Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy in the film, becomes a dragon sidekick for Sora and company.  In the first game of the series, the evil witch Maleficent becomes a dragon during her battle against Sora as well. \n"}, {"text": "The most popular purple, winged dragon in gaming happens to have a dragonfly named Sparx as his companion.  What is the name of this character?", "correct": "Spyro & Spyro the Dragon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpyro & Spyro the Dragon.\n\n\tSpyro the Dragon has appeared in games since 1998 on the original Playstation system.  Since, he's become one of the most profitable characters to appear on Sony's systems and has had a long-running and reliable series of platforming games.  \"Spyro the Dragon\" was originally created by Insomniac Games who, over the years, have also brought forth \"Ratchet and Clank\" and the \"Resistance\" series for Sony's consoles. Spyro, since his debut, has fallen into other developers' hands over the years including Sierra, Eurocom, and Activision, while Insomniac has focused on different innovative IPs for Playstation. Spyro's travel buddy, Sparx, just happens to be a dragonfly.  Spyro has also been voiced by Elijah Wood in the past. \n"}, {"text": "There's something frustrating about the extreme difficulty spike of \"Demons Souls\" for the PS3.  In the first level (1-1, Boletaria Palace), a giant, red dragon will shoot a one-hit-kill blaze of fire along the castle parapets making timing and precise accuracy a must.  Is it possible to kill this beast?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhile obscenely hard for most RPG players, \"Demons Souls\" is an appropriately dark, yet beautiful game that separates the casual from the hardcore video gamer.  Not only is it strikingly easy to die in any battle in the game (think \"Super Ghouls and Ghosts\" dying) but the levels are crafted in ways that make even the best players think. The first level, Boletaria Palace, contains several fighting warriors, rabid dogs (fast ones), and a series of castle parapet walkways which will be consistently blasted with dragon fire.  Patience is a virtue just as much as speed and timing here, but strong players will be able to fight and defeat this massive Red Dragon and claim its soul (the Small Flame Scale Demon's Soul) in Level 1-2.  But egads...to start this game you can't let the constant deaths get to you. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these dragon-themed games was the earliest to be released (by twenty years)?", "correct": "Dragon Warrior", "options": ["Blue Dragon", "Dragon Age: Origins", "Lair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDragon Warrior.\n\n\t\"Dragon Warrior\", which became \"Dragon Quest\" in its later years, was first launched as a series in 1986 on the NES.  This classic role-playing game has since been one of Japan's most famous, and aside from \"Final Fantasy\", it's one of Square-Enix's claims to fame.  Twenty years later, \"Blue Dragon\" was released on the Xbox 360 as a turn-based RPG released by the same developers who made the colossally-sized RPG \"Lost Odyessy\".  \"Lair\" came next on the Playstation 3 and after its 2007, its motion-sensitive control scheme, performed while the player character was on the back of a realistic dragon, called attention to the Sixaxis controller's issues and handling. \"Dragon Age: Origins\" is the most recent release (from 2009).  This Westernized RPG set in a fantasy world was made by Bioware (who also made \"Mass Effect\") for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.  Although it took many years to create, popularity and critical acclaim spurned a series of \"Dragon Age\" games. \n"}, {"text": "Although he's technically the King of Koopas, he is scaly, he breathes fire, and he fits well on our list here.  Who is Mario's arch-enemy?", "correct": "Bowser", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowser.\n\n\tBowser has been a thorn in Mario's side since the days of the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" for the NES, and his presence has been recurring in the series for over two decades of games.  Whether fighting against Mario for stakes including Princess Toadstool/Peach, or fighting alongside Mario in RPGs or sports games, Bowser has been a video game antagonist of the ages. Many of the platformer games in the series (even the really early ones) have emphasized Bowser's likeness to a dragon from the ability to shoot or breathe fire to his tyrannical hold over helpless royalty.  Mario always seems to win out in the end, however. \n"}]}
