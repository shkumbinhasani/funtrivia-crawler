{"id": "301729", "name": "Horror Films of 2008 Online Quiz | Horror Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Horror Mixture", "Horror Movies by Year"], "questions": [{"text": "Another of JJ Abrams' top-secret projects, which movie had the tentative title \"1-18-08\"?", "correct": "Cloverfield", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCloverfield.\n\n\tReleased with an intricate viral marketing scheme, \"Cloverfield\" was a unique film in many aspects.  With all the hype (including a mysterious image of the Statue of Liberty without its head) and the shakey-cam methods used by the cast (which we'll see in many...many...many more films this year), \"Cloverfield\" became the first horror/sci-fi hit of the year, reaching No 1 in the box office and garnering over $170,000,000.  \rThe film centers around video camera footage, recovered by the U.S. Government after an alien attack on New York City.  The events depicted in the film are filmed by a small group of people who trek across the under-siege city to save their friend.  What they realize, however, is that the dangers are all around them, and the city is no longer safe. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the George A. Romero zombie film, the fifth in his series, which was released in 2008?", "correct": "Diary of the Dead", "options": ["Island of the Dead", "Land of the Dead", "Dawn of the Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiary of the Dead.\n\n\tDisplaying the same 'shakey-cam' techniques seen in \"Cloverfield\" earlier in the year, \"Diary of the Dead\" was another installation in the '...of the Dead' series of zombie horror films directed by George A. Romero (famous for his work in \"Night of the Living Dead\").  \rThis film centers around a group of individuals who band together during a zombie outbreak and make their way to a safehouse/mansion to escape the terror and carnage.  The film is also a social commentary, taking a modern twist and forcing it into the movie's ultimate message.\rAlthought the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival the year before, it gained a small release in 2008 in exclusive theatres, gaining back its ten million dollar budget. \n"}, {"text": "Jessica Alba starred in which 2008 horror film, originally made in China?", "correct": "The Eye", "options": ["The Grudge 2", "House", "The Ring 2"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Eye.\n\n\t\"The Eye\" was originally a Chinese-made horror film, released in 2002 by the Pang Brothers, and remade for American audiences by the same duo in 2008.  While the original film's tension and use of the supernatural was highly praised by many, its two sequels fared poorly in comparison.  The American remake, starring Jessica Alba and Parker Posey, fared similarly and only reached No. 2 in the box office (but still earning over $50,000,000).\rThe film centers around a blind woman who receives transplants for both of her eyes.  Although this miracle is a breakthrough and a life-changing experience, there comes a hitch: the eyes she has taken allow her to see ghosts and visions that only she can witness.  While the people around her question her sanity, she has to determine what to make of this 'gift'. \n"}, {"text": "Which film, set entirely in a country house, was directed by first-time filmmaker Bryan Bertino?", "correct": "The Strangers", "options": ["Last House on the Left", "Wrong Turn 2: Dead End", "The Woods"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Strangers.\n\n\tPossibly one of the surprise hits of the summer horror scene, \"The Strangers\" was Bryan Bertino's debut film, after he offered to film the game under a smaller budget.  \rStarring Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler, the film follows a couple in a cottage in the woods.  In the middle of the night, a knocking is heard on their door, and shortly after, the home invasion begins.  As the couple tries to hide and run from their attackers, they are attacked with precision and unwavering violence.\r\"The Strangers\" grossed more than most other horror films this year.  Hitting No. 1 in the box office, the film grossed $74,000,000.  Unlike most other horror films, the use of tension and cinematography in \"The Strangers\" couldn't parallel others like it in recent years. \n"}, {"text": "Which movie, remade and rereleased in the United States in 2008, was known as \"Chakushin Ari\" in Japan?", "correct": "One Missed Call", "options": ["Asylum", "Pulse 2", "Death Note"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne Missed Call.\n\n\t\"One Missed Call\" was the first horror film released in 2008.  Unfortunately, the film was one to miss.  After refusing to screen the film, Warner Bros. released it in the first week of January.  On the whole, the film received one of the lowest overall ratings of the year.\rStarring Shannyn Sossamon and Edward Burns, \"One Missed Call\" involves an odd, fatal curse that haunts cell phone users.  When your phone rings with an ominously eerie ringtone, you'll hear yourself dying on the other line.  Unwittingly, the characters decide to take the call or hook into their voicemails long enough to do this and they put their own lives at risk.  It takes a complicated plot turn about little girls and an abandoned hospital before Shannyn Sossamon can solve the mystery behind the haunting...and even then, it's not over.\rThe original, \"Chakushin Ari\" was directed by Takashi Miike, known for his work on \"Ichi the Killer\", \"Audition\", and \"Three Extremes\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of these 2008 films was based on a Spanish horror movie released the preceding year?", "correct": "Quarantine", "options": ["Insanitarium", "Loner", "Grizzly Park"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuarantine.\n\n\t\"Quarantine\", starring Jennifer Carpenter (known for her work in \"Dexter\"), revolves around a tape found inside a quarantined apartment building.  While reporting at a fire station, a reporter and her cameraman go on a ride-along during an emergency call.  When they arrive at the building, it is promptly discovered that some of the residents have an obscure, rabies-like disease, and when the building is quarantined off, they must fight for their lives in the dark with a shaky-night vision camera.\rMuch like \"Cloverfield\" (released earlier in the year), the film utilized the same 'handheld camera' style of cinematography.  \"Quarantine\" was based on the movie \"[REC]\", released in Spain in 2007.  Released in October, 2008, \"Quarantine\" reached No. 1 in the box office and earned $33,000,000 overall.  While \"Quarantine\" received moderately favourable reviews, \"[REC]\" remained the more critically popular film. \n"}, {"text": "What 2008 horror film starred Joshua Jackson?", "correct": "Shutter", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nShutter.\n\n\tThe original \"Shutter\" was made in Thailand in 2004.  Although the original was quite well-received, the 'Year of Remakes' couldn't let this one go untouched.  \"Shutter\", released in March 2008, did not spark too much interest in a field oversaturated by remakes.  In its opening weekend it reached No. 3 in the box office, but it still managed to rake in $43,000,000 overall.\r\"Shutter\" is a film based around the idea of spirit photography; taking a picture and capturing the spirit of a tragically-killed individual within.  When a couple is haunted by one such spirit in their photos, a dark secret is brought up from the past.\rMuch like \"One Missed Call\" earlier in the year, \"Shutter\" was not screened for critics. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these 2008 films takes place in Mexico?", "correct": "The Ruins", "options": ["Lost Boys 2: The Tribe", "The Happening", "Credo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ruins.\n\n\tBased on the Scott Smith novel of the same name, \"The Ruins\" was one of the more promising hopeful horror films of 2008.  The film is based on a group of friends who travel deep into the Mexican jungles to find a friend's brother at an archaeological dig.  When they arrive, however, it turns out that the locals have been guarding the ruins for years...not for preservation, but for safety.  When weird things start to happen and rescue hopes begin to look grim, the gang learns the horrible truths behind the ruins.\rThe film grossed a meager $22,000,000 which, in comparison with some of the other horror films of the year (sadly), was quite a bit less.  The film received mixed reviews, unlike the book (which was quite successful).  Stars included Joe Anderson, Shawn Ashmore, and Jena Malone. \n"}, {"text": "Which popular horror series released an installment (fifth in the series) on the week of Halloween in 2008?", "correct": "Saw", "options": ["Friday the 13th", "Feast", "Anaconda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaw.\n\n\t\"Saw 5\", unfortunately, was the fifth in the slowly-declining-in-quality \"Saw\" series.  With the antagonist of the series (and most of his followers and victims) dead, Jigsaw's work is taken up by the final follower.  Now, with the primary villain only seen in flashback sequences, it's up to one man to finish the killer's work, another man to solve the entire case (by talking to himself a whole lot) and another five people to solve their way through surprisingly simple traps.  Blood and ignorance ensue.\r\"Saw V\" was made for $10,000,000 and made ten times that in the box office.  Despite this, it placed second in the box office (ironically behind \"High School Musical 3; Senior Year\").  Critically, the movie bombed. \n"}, {"text": "Described as a 'rock opera', which film by Darren Lynn Bousman hit limited release in November 2008?", "correct": "Repo! The Genetic Opera", "options": ["Prom Night", "The Haunting of Molly Hartley", "Let the Right One In"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRepo! The Genetic Opera.\n\n\tOriginally thought to be released early in 2008, \"Repo!\" shifted from release date to release date with no end.  Finally, the film took a tour of limited releases across the United States and Canada before being announced for DVD release.  Because of this, \"Repo!\" barely regained its $8,500,000 budget.\rStarring Alexa Vega, Anthony Stewart Head, Paris Hilton, and Sarah Brightman, the film involves a company called GeneCo and a man who repossesses your organs for further use if you don't pay up on your taxes.  Alexa Vega has an odd disease, passed down from her mother and this forces her to stay in her room for seventeen years.  When she leaves, she discovers a masochistic, dystopian world where GeneCo and odd, underground organ transplants seem to rule over all.\rWith a fifty-five song track listing, the film's soundtrack was an infectious mix of rock songs.  This alone separated the film from others of the genre which are quite a bit less...erm...musical. \n"}]}
