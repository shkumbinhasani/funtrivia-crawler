{"id": "362061", "name": "Customs and Culture in the Maghreb - Mauritania Online Trivia | World | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Cultures", " African Cultures"], "questions": [{"text": "Mealtimes are an important part of Mauritanian culture, but there are some unusual customs as to with whom they will eat their food. Of the following, who would you NOT expect to see sitting at your Mauritanian dinner table?", "correct": "Your wife's family", "options": ["Your children", "Your husband/wife", "Your employer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYour wife's family.\n\n\tIn Mauritania there exists a custom known as 'Sahwa', which means 'shyness'.  This custom dates back many centuries and is rigidly adhered to by the older members of society, especially in the more remote rural areas. This custom dictates that a husband is forbidden from speaking or eating in the presence of his wife's relatives.'Sahwa' also forbids a woman from breast-feeding her children in the presence of her father or older brothers as this is considered to be an expression of sexuality. Wives are not permitted to express feelings for their husbands and are expected to look sullen at all times even during her wedding celebrations.Failure to adhere to the requirements of 'Sahwa' can have serious repercussions, the worst of which in this culture is the castigation of the entire family. \n"}, {"text": "After both lunch and dinner it is customary in Mauritanian homes for women, children and slaves to serve the men with which beverage?", "correct": "Sweet green tea flavoured with mint", "options": ["Crushed fruit with yoghurt", "Black coffee and cream", "Whisky and soda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSweet green tea flavoured with mint.\n\n\tYes, as strange as it may seem, slavery is still practiced in Mauritania!  The Mauritanians are particularly fond of sweet foods and drinks and also drink sour camel milk and water; a drink known as 'Zrig', hibiscus flower juice and the juice of the fruit of the Baobab tree. \n"}, {"text": "Custom dictates that on major ceremonial occasions an animal is slaughtered.  Which section of society are the only ones who are permitted to slaughter an animal?", "correct": "Only circumcised adult males", "options": ["An Imam", "Eunuchs", "Only circumcised adult females"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly circumcised adult males.\n\n\tAt the end of Ramadan and the feast that celebrates the end of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, the only meat that will be accepted as a sacrifice is lamb; any meat from this animal must be eaten after three days or it will be discarded.  It is also customary for an animal to be slaughtered during the celebrations of the giving of a name, a tribal initiation ceremony, marriage and funerals. \n"}, {"text": "Mauritanian society is organised within a strict 'caste' system.  Of the following, which would you be surprised to find in the lowest social class?", "correct": "Musicians", "options": ["Weavers", "Soldiers", "Fishermen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMusicians.\n\n\tMusicians are known as 'Iggawin' and occupy a position within the lowest of the 'non-slave' social castes.  In Mauretania the 'Iggawin' are looked upon in a similar way as minstrels were in Europe during the medieval period.  They accompanied members of the warrior caste during wars, sang songs, wrote commentary and poems extolling their master's bravery... Thinking 'Brave Sir Robin' may give you an accurate picture of the role that they perform!  Even more surprisingly, other occupations that would be found in the lower caste include historians, governmental advisers, poets and playwrights. Those at the very top of the Mauritanian caste system are the religious hierarchy and the warriors, descendants of the 'Moors', the people who occupied the area many centuries ago. Beneath are those skilled artisans such as metalworkers and the other two occupations - weavers and fishermen. \n"}, {"text": "Mauritania, as a tribal society, has many marriage customs and marriage between cousins is commonplace.  \"It is expected that any married couple must divorce if they are found to have shared milk from the same breast\".  Is that statement true or false?", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIf it can be proved that, as children, a married couple shared milk from the breast of the same woman, they are obliged to divorce each other even if they have had children together. In Mauritania, as in other Islamic countries, their women are not permitted to marry men who are not Muslims, whereas the men are free to marry women from whichever religious background they wish.  Divorce in Mauritania is rare but married couples may do so up to three times. \n"}, {"text": "Back to eating... In Mauritania food and the eating of food has an important social aspect.  What implements do Mauritanians use exclusively in handling their food whilst eating?", "correct": "Right hand only", "options": ["Left hand only", "Large slotted spoon", "Folded palm leaves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRight hand only.\n\n\tMeals are usually eaten communally and from a large bowl known as a 'calabash'.  Eating with the left hand is forbidden!  Among the black African population the main meal is eaten at lunchtime whereas within the Arab and Berber population the main meal is eaten during the evening.  The Mauritanian diet consists chiefly of millet, rice, fish and sweet potatoes with meat being consumed by those who can afford it.  Dates are very popular, as is couscous and a baked lamb dish known as 'Mechoui'. \n"}, {"text": "One of the oldest social customs in Mauritania is the practice of 'Leblouh'.  What is 'Leblouh'?", "correct": "Forced fattening", "options": ["Wailing", "Tribal tattooing", "Breaking wind after meals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForced fattening.\n\n\tTo many of Mauritania's poor and uneducated rural people, 'Leblouh' is the only means of ensuring that their daughters gain a husband.  In this country, slim women are deemed to be inferior and are considered to bring shame upon their families.  Because of this many families practice forced feeding, even going as far as to hire the services of and paying older women who are deemed experts in the fattening process. It is believed that the practice has its roots in the period when nomadic women were confined to their tents and became fat due to a lack of exercise; this went on over time to become the social and cultural norm that persists to this day. Things however are changing albeit slowly due to campaigns by the Mauritanian health system in highlighting the health problems that arise with the practice of 'Leblouh'. \n"}, {"text": "\"In Mauritania the contribution made to society by women, of any ethnicity, is not recognised in any form\".  Is that statement true or false?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe importance of the contribution made by women in Mauritanian society is acknowledged, but men dominate in virtually every sphere of Mauritanian life.  In the southern part of the country, mainly populated by those of black African ethnicity, women are expected to cook, look after the household and care for the children. In the Arab and Berber north, women are not expected to work as manual labour is considered degrading... unless you are a female slave of course!  Unfortunately however, female circumcision is still routinely practiced as is the custom of the forced 'fattening' of young women in preparation for their marriage, a practice known as 'Leblouh'. \n"}, {"text": "Before taking a photograph of a Mauritanian male, it is customary to do which of the following? ", "correct": "Become friends", "options": ["Become friends ", "Turn your back on them", "Spit at them", "Poke out your tongue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecome friends.\n\n\tMauritanian etiquette demands that before you take a picture or have your picture taken with them, that you become friends.  This is achieved by standing very close, shaking hands and talking about your health and wealth.  Once friendship is achieved the picture can be taken.  A word of warning, however; in some areas this 'friendship' is seen as an excuse to call on you, eat your food and consume your drink!  The people naturally stand very close to each other whilst talking, handshakes are always offered to visitors but never by Mauritanian women... Oh yes, never call a person older than yourself by their name. \n"}, {"text": "Unusually for a one hundred percent Muslim nation, many Mauritanians still adhere to the use of what in their religious rites?", "correct": "Charms, amulets and fetishes", "options": ["Daggers", "Alcohol", "Crucifixes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharms, amulets and fetishes.\n\n\tThe population of Mauritania are Sunni Muslims but, as an ancient culture, the old African belief systems have proved impossibly difficult to eradicate.  Many Mauritanians still believe in the supernatural and believe, as did the ancient European druids, that all things possess a life force.  In some tribal areas traditional 'medicine men' still exist and practice their arts. Burial is the normal means of disposing of the dead in Mauritania and those who die in old age are customarily buried without coffins.  Cremation is uncommon and is only used as a means of disposing those who have died from contagious disease. Amongst the nomadic population graves are sites to be avoided and once a person is buried their grave is not visited again.  Prior to burial the custom is that the body is washed seven times and then wrapped in white coloured cloth before being buried facing the sacred city of Mecca.  Women are not permitted to attend the funeral and the custom is that any guests who have turned their backs and left the graveside will never return.  It is also customary for the belongings of the deceased to be distributed amongst the poor within their community. \n"}]}
