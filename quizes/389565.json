{"id": "389565", "name": "Zone of Strange Movies Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "In which of these movies does a man in a Frankenstein monster mask kill people at a carnival?", "correct": "The Funhouse", "options": ["The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies", "The Girls From Venus and the Men From Mars Get Together and Try to Take Over the Earth", "The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Funhouse.\n\n\t\"The Funhouse\" (1981) began with a boy stabbing at his sister in the shower with a rubber knife.  This recalls murders in \"Psycho\" and \"Halloween\".  Later, the girl goes with her friends to a carnival where they get locked inside the funhouse.  They didn't know that a deformed man in a Frankenstein mask would murder a gypsy woman and try to murder them to get rid of possible witnesses.  (\"The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies\" also involved a gypsy woman and murder at a carnival.) \n"}, {"text": "In which of these movies did Michael Caine play a scientist who fought killer bees?", "correct": "The Swarm (1978)", "options": ["Killer Bees (1974)", "Swarmed (2005)", "The Deadly Bees (1967)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Swarm (1978).\n\n\tDr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine) survived an attack of killer bees and worked with General Slater to figure out how to stop the bees.  The expensive movie (Budget: $21 Million, Box Office: $7.6 Million) was directed by Irwin Allen (\"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\"), and featured a train derailment and attacks of killer bees at a missile base and various towns. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these movies did a cat survive while several people were getting killed by a space monster?", "correct": "Alien", "options": ["Beware! The Blob!", "Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster", "The Cat From Outer Space"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlien.\n\n\tIn \"Alien\" a mutating alien roamed inside a spaceship killing people.  There was a pet cat on board who somehow escaped getting murdered.  When Ripley found the cat and brought it into the escape pod with her, the alien monster popped up, and she had to put the alien out.  (Did the cat keep away \"space mice\"?)  \"The Cat From Outer Space\" also involved a cat from space, but there was no alien monster.  A cat did get killed by a monster in \"Beware! The Blob!\" \n"}, {"text": "What monster had giant claws in the movie \"The Giant Claw\"?", "correct": "Bird", "options": ["Lion", "Dragon", "Bear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBird.\n\n\tThis was considered to have the most silly looking monster in the history of movies.  It was a giant, supersonic bird which knocked airplanes out of the air and tore up buildings. The exploding airplanes looked real, but the bird itself looked like a puppet, with big eyes, instead of small bird eyes. It resembled the evil bird which took Baby New Year in the TV special, \"Rudolph's Shiny New Year\".  Also, the movie showed people smoking on a commercial airplane flight. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these movies featured the character Captain Harris, who became a zombie?", "correct": "Creature with the Atom Brain", "options": ["Police Academy", "House of Frankenstein", "Tomb of the Blind Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreature with the Atom Brain.\n\n\tThe movie began with an atomic zombie crashing through a window and grabbing a man while getting shot, lifting him above his head and breaking his back.  Radioactive synthetic blood brought corpses from the morgue back to life.  Police Captain Harris was killed, resurrected, and controlled by the evil Buchanan.  Harris had visible electrodes in his brain, but no one seemed to notice.  Harris stabbed people in protective custody to death.  (\"Police Academy\" did have a Captain Harris, but he never became a zombie.) \n"}, {"text": "In which of these movies did Dr. Frankenstein accidentally step on someone's brain?", "correct": "Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell", "options": ["The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies", "Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster", "Frankenstein Meets Moses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrankenstein and the Monster From Hell.\n\n\tThis was a featured clip in the movie \"It Came From Hollywood\", but it originated in \"Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell\".  Dr. Frankenstein was running a house for the criminally insane when he decided to resurrect someone by putting the man's brain into someone else's body.  When he removed the violent brain, he dropped it in a bowl on the floor and accidentally stepped on it while grabbing the other brain. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these movies did Mrs. Frankenstein say, \"How dare you wake me up in the middle of the day?\"?", "correct": "Flesh for Frankenstein", "options": ["Frankenstein Created Woman", "House of Frankenstein", "Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlesh for Frankenstein.\n\n\tFrom the makers of \"Blood for Dracula\" came \"Flesh for Frankenstein\".  Dr. Frankenstein was more interested in creating and bringing to life a man and woman to make a superior race than he was his wife.  Mrs. Frankenstein (Monique Van Vooren) started an affair with a local working man, who began to think Dr. Frankenstein was killing people when his friend disappeared.  He woke up Mrs. Frankenstein to ask her about it, but she replied, \"How dare you wake me up in the middle of the day?\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"I Was a Teenage Frankenstein\" what did Frankenstein say to his assistant when his creation cried?", "correct": "\"The tear duct functions.\"", "options": ["\"I've created a cry-baby.\"", "\"Take a sample of his tears.\"", "\"What's he crying about?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The tear duct functions.\"\n\n\tA teenager had gotten injured in an accident.  Frankenstein used various body parts to repair and resurrect the teenager, but the face was mangled.  The teenager insisted on seeing his face in the mirror, and he cried.  Frankenstein commented, \"The tear duct functions.\"  Technically, Frankenstein himself was a middle-aged man, but his creation was a teenager. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these movies did space creatures use retractable needle fingernails to inject alcohol into people?", "correct": "Invasion of the Saucer Men", "options": ["The Cat From Outer Space", "Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster", "Cyborg Trio From Planet K-9"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInvasion of the Saucer Men.\n\n\t\"Invasion of the Saucer Men\" took place one night when some little aliens left their flying saucer and ran around the woods where teenagers were smooching.  Someone hit an alien with a car.  When the driver left to tell someone he hit a space alien, a drunk man arrived, and the alien used retractable needle fingernails to inject the drunk man with additional alcohol, causing the man (Frank Gorshin) to die of alcohol poisoning.  When the police arrived and saw the dead man, they thought the driver had mistakenly thought he hit a space alien when he really had hit the dead drunk man. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these movies had no Dr. Frankenstein?", "correct": "Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster", "options": ["Ghost of Frankenstein", "Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell", "Bride of Frankenstein "], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrankenstein Meets the Space Monster.\n\n\t\"Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster\" involved aliens looking for Earth women.  Meanwhile, a NASA ship crash landed which damaged an android on board, sending it on a rampage.  The people at mission control referred to the android as a \"Frankenstein\", because it was uncontrollable, and it had a deformed damaged skull.  The aliens happened to have a monster in their spaceship which got loose and fought the android.  There was no Doctor Frankenstein in this movie, and you could even say there was no Frankenstein monster, just a damaged android and a space monster. \n"}]}
