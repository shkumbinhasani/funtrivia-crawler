{"id": "354137", "name": "Endangered: The Javan Rhinoceros Quiz / Test | Animals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "   Wild Mammals", "Perissodactyls- Rhinos and Equines"], "questions": [{"text": "What country is home to Ujung Kulon National Park, the home of the world's only surviving Javan rhinoceros population?", "correct": "Indonesia", "options": ["Tanzania", "Kenya", "Romania"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndonesia.\n\n\tAt one time the Javan rhinoceros lived in northeast India, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Today it only exists at the Ujung Kulon National Park  in Indonesia. At the turn of the 21st century, there were less than fifty of these animals left in the wild. There are none in zoos or private collections that are known of. These 40-50 animals are all that remain of this unusual and majestic animal. \n"}, {"text": "What has been the biggest cause for the dwindling population of Javan rhinoceros?", "correct": "Poaching", "options": ["Leprosy and tuberculosis", "Imported predators", "Typhoons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoaching.\n\n\tThe main reason that rhino populations have dropped all over the world, is poaching. The horn of any rhino is extremely valuable and can fetch over $500,000 or more, at auction. They have been used for centuries in Chinese herbal medicine. As the human population increased so did the demand for all types of medicine. Its use as an aphrodisiac and aid for impotence has not decreased even with the discoveries of Western medicines such as Viagra and Cialis. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these statements about the Javan rhinoceros are true?", "correct": "It has very poor eyesight", "options": ["It has very poor hearing", "It has a very poor sense of smell", "It has very poor balance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt has very poor eyesight.\n\n\tThe Javan rhino has very poor eyesight, as do all species of rhinoceros. They have excellent hearing and smell which are both used as their main method of sensing what is going on around them. They also have an excellent sense of balance and are much more agile than they look. \n"}, {"text": "Other than man, what was the main predator of the Javan rhino?", "correct": "They did not have any predators", "options": ["The saltwater crocodile", "The spectacled bear", "The orangutan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey did not have any predators.\n\n\tThe Javan rhino does not have any natural predators other than man. Man only hunted it for its horn and leathery hide. Even large predators such as the tiger did not attempt to bring down the Javan rhino, as its skin is too thick, and it was strong enough to kill a tiger by trampling it to death.  The Javan rhino does not usually share the same environment as the saltwater crocodile, preferring the dense lowland grasslands and forest. \n"}, {"text": "The Javan rhinoceros has the longest and heaviest horn of all known rhinos.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe Javan rhino has only one horn instead of two, like its cousin the Indian rhinoceros, and is also known as the 'lesser one-horned' rhinoceros.  Their single horn rarely exceeds 10 inches (25cm).  Many of the females do not appear to have a horn but rather exhibit a small bump-like protuberance. \n"}, {"text": "What local volcano, if it erupted, could cause this species to become extinct in one eruption?", "correct": "Krakatoa", "options": ["Muana Loa", "Mount St. Helens", "Laki"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKrakatoa.\n\n\tThe 1883 eruption of Krakatoa killed almost, if not all, of the Javan rhinoceros in the area. Many zoologist believe that if this powerful volcano erupts again, that its proximity to the Ujung Kulon National Park would ensure the extinction of the Javan rhinoceros. Anakrakatau is the name given to what remains of the Krakatoa volcano and it is growing at a rate of about 5 in. (13cm) every week. Volcanic activity, typhoons, and earthquakes are a real threat to the survival of these animals. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following statements best describes the Javan rhino's social behaviors?", "correct": "Solitary, except when mating and rearing offspring", "options": ["They live in family packs of 15-20", "Solitary, except when mating and rearing offspring ", "They avoid each other at all times except for mating", "They separate into large packs depending on the sex of the animal "], "explanation": "\n\n\nSolitary, except when mating and rearing offspring.\n\n\tThe Javan rhino tends to be a solitary creature. It is only during mating and during the period of raising their offspring that they live together. They do not mate for life, only for the one season. Groups are occasionally seen together near water sources and salt licks. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these terms best describes the eating habits of the Javan rhino?", "correct": "Herbivore", "options": ["Piscivore", "Omnivore", "Carnivore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHerbivore.\n\n\tThe Javan rhino is an herbivore, as are all rhinos. The Javan rhino likes woody grasses and acacia plants. They are very adaptable eaters and will eat whatever is available but do have their favorites. Rhinos play a very important part in their own environments by spreading and fertilizing seeds in their dung. They spend the majority of their days grazing, and if left alone, they are gentle giants. \n"}, {"text": "What color is the Javan rhinoceros?", "correct": "Dusky gray", "options": ["Glossy black", "Creamy white", "Reddish brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDusky gray.\n\n\tThe Javan rhino is a dusky gray color and blends well into the shadowy forests that it inhabits. It has very thick skin which folds in such a way that it appears to be wearing armor. The Javan rhino has the least amount of hair of any of the rhino family. It has eyelashes, and sparse amounts of hair on the end of its tail and small amounts on its ears. These hairs tend to be the same gray color of the rhino. \n"}, {"text": "The horn of the Javan rhino is made of ivory.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMany people mistakenly think the horn of a rhino is made of bone, or of ivory. The horn of the Javan rhino is made of compacted hair and keratin, the same material your fingernails are made of. The rhino uses its horn as a tool to move vegetation aside or occasionally in masculine displays that are put on during mating season. Because the Javan rhino is so critically endangered very little is actually known about the species and its behavior. \n"}]}
