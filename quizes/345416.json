The video game was perfect.  Nothing could be better.  Until the sequel came out, of course.  Which video game was originally part of \"The Orange Box\", and later became its own game, then a sequel?", "correct": "Portal", "options": ["Porter", "Postal", "Poster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortal.\n\n\t\"Portal\" was originally released in \"The Orange Box\", along with \"Half Life 2\" and \"Team Fortress 2\", in 2007.  \"Portal\" was a spin-off of \"Half Life\", involving the puzzle aspects, but set in the same universe as \"Half Life\".  The game quickly outshined the other two games in \"The Orange Box\", which was quite surprising to its creators.  \"Portal\" had such success that in 2011, \"Portal 2\" (XBox 360, PS3) was released, and it was even better than the original. \n"}, {"text": "When \"Sly Cooper\" was released in 2002, I, like many others, were thrilled.  It was a wonderful game where stealth and thievery were major concepts.  It couldn't be better.  But \"Sly 2\" came out, which introduced an entirely new form of game play.  What is the full title of \"Sly 2\"?", "correct": "Band of Thieves", "options": ["Honor Among Thieves", "Thievius Raccoonus", "Thieves in Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBand of Thieves.\n\n\t\"Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus\" was the first in the series, released in 2002 for the PS2.  It was generally well received, but most people seemed not to like the length; it ended too soon.\r In 2004, \"Sly 2: Band of Thieves\" was released for the PS2.  The game play completely changed from the original \"Sly Cooper\" game.  Instead of green portals to enter each level, there were missions, and they would appear anywhere on that level's world map.  \"Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves\" was released in 2005 for the PS2, but it was not until a very long wait of 7 years that, in 2012, \"Sly 4: Thieves in Time\" was released. \n"}, {"text": "The first game introduced Sora, and the video game was amazing.  It was a lengthy game, especially if you leveled up all your stats and found all the trinity marks, but it was worth every minute spent; and more than once through, too.  Then the second game came out, and it only got better.\n\nWhich video games series is described above?", "correct": "Kingdom Hearts", "options": ["Final Fantasy", "Legend of Zelda", "Banjo-Kazooie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKingdom Hearts.\n\n\t\"Kingdom Hearts\" was the first title of the series, released in 2002 for the PS2.  The game merged the \"Final Fantasy\" games with Disney movies; and it did so to much success.  Sora met Donald Duck and Goofy, and the three went around different Disney 'worlds', and each world contained the story from that particular Disney film (with Sora, Donald and Goofy added in, of course).  The next video game in the main series (not including spin-offs and side plots) was \"Kingdom Hearts II\", released for the PS2 in 2005.  It added more Disney worlds to visit, and also allowed you to visit some of the same locations, but with a completely new story to it.  The game was also rather lengthy, but to collect everything and level up your character only made the game more entertaining. \n"}, {"text": "I loved \"Tak and the Power of Juju\" when it was released for the PS2 in 2003.  I thought it was great!  Then \"Tak 2\" was released, and it got even better.  Which of these is \"Tak 2\" called?", "correct": "The Staff of Dreams", "options": ["The Great Juju Challenge", "The Guardians of Gross", "Mojo Mistake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Staff of Dreams.\n\n\t\"Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams\" was the second in the Tak series, and was released for the PS2 and XBox in 2005.  It added a few new elements, had a better story, and had better controls and graphics than the first game, making it much better than the first.  The third game in the series was \"The Great Juju Challenge\", released in 2005 for the PS2, XBox, and DS (among others).  The fourth game, \"The Guardians of Gross\", was released for the Wii and PS2 in 2008.  \"Mojo Mistake\" was also released in 2008, even on the same day (October 13), but was a game released for the Nintendo DS. \n"}, {"text": "I love all the \"LEGO\" video games, and the sequels never disappoint; they always seem to be better.  Which of these LEGO games includes a sequel, a threequel, and a complete saga?", "correct": "LEGO Star Wars", "options": ["LEGO Indiana Jones", "LEGO Batman", "LEGO Harry Potter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars.\n\n\t\"LEGO Star Wars\" was released in 2005 for the PS2 and Xbox.  It followed the first three movies of the \"Star Wars\" franchise.  In 2006, \"LEGO Star Wars II\" was released, which followed movies 4-6, the original trilogy.  In 2007, the video games were combined into the \"Complete Saga\".  In 2011, \"LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars\" was released.\r Other LEGO games include \"Indiana Jones\", \"Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues\", \"LEGO Batman\", \"LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes\", \"LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4\", \"LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, and \"LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean\" (my personal favorite, but, alas, no sequel from the time of the writing of this question). \n"}, {"text": "I much preferred the sequel to this classic game, where you must destroy the Pookas and Fygars on the level.  The first of the games takes place underground, but the seconds moves to an island.  To destroy enemies, you can either blow them up like a balloon, or break off a chunk of the island into the water, thus killing whatever bad guys are on that chunk of land.  What is this game?", "correct": "Dig Dug II", "options": ["Ms. Pacman", "Galaga", "Asteroids II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDig Dug II.\n\n\t\"Dig Dug\" was first released in 1982 as an arcade game.  \"Dig Dug II\" was the sequel to the game, released in 1985 for the arcade and the NES.  Though I personally enjoyed \"Dig Dug II\" much more than the first, it did not gain as much popularity. \n"}, {"text": "In my humble opinion, the more Lara Croft video games they make, the better they get (with a few exceptions, of course).  The second was better than the first for sure.\n\nWhich video game series features Lara Croft?", "correct": "Tomb Raider", "options": ["Splinter Cell", "Resident Evil", "Beyond Good and Evil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTomb Raider.\n\n\t\"Tomb Raider\" was first released in 1996 for the PS, and its sequel, \"Tomb Raider II\", was released for the PS in 1997.  Several quizzes have been added to the series, and they became wildly popular.  Two movies, starring Angelina Jolie, were even made based off of the games. \n"}, {"text": "When \"Crash of the Titans\" came out, I was thrilled.  I played it over and over and over again, and enjoyed it almost as much every time.  I enjoyed the sequel even more, though.  Instead of levels, there were missions.  Instead of going straight through, you could travel across the world, and you'd often find yourself where you were once before.\n\nWhat was the name of the sequel to \"Crash of the Titans\"?", "correct": "Crash: Mind Over Mutant", "options": ["Crash: Mind-Boggling Mutants", "Crash: Mutating Madness", "Crash: Mutants on the Loose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrash: Mind Over Mutant.\n\n\t\"Crash of the Titans\" was released for the PS2, XBox 360, Wii, and DS in 2007 as part of the \"Crash Bandicoot\" franchise.  In 2008, the sequel, \"Crash: Mind Over Mutant\", was released for the PS2, XBox 360, Wii, and DS.  \"Crash of the Titans\" had 20 levels, but each level you could play straight through. You would exit the level and be brought back to a main screen where you can choose the next level.  However, the sequel \"Crash: Mind Over Mutant\" took place on one giant world map.  You began in the middle, and traveled back and forth between different sections of the world, but they were all interconnected. It was one giant level, but contained many different missions. \n"}, {"text": "The first video game was great.  Then the sequel, \"Melee\", was even better.  It kept improving with the third release, \"Brawl\".\n\nWhat video game series is this?", "correct": "Super Smash Bros.", "options": ["Super Mario Bros.", "Super Mario Galaxy", "Super Mario All Stars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros.\n\n\t\"Super Smash Bros.\" was released in 1999 for the N64.  It was a great game, only to become even greater with the 2001 release of \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" for the GameCube.  Who would have thought it could get any better?  Well, it did, in 2008, when \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" was released for the Wii. \n"}, {"text": "Though I much prefer the very first few \"Spyro the Dragon\" video games, I also quite enjoyed a spin-off series, the first of which was \"Spyro: Season of Ice\".\n\nWhat was the sequel, which I thought to be a bit better, called?", "correct": "Season of Flame", "options": ["Season of Snow", "Season of Fire", "Season of Heat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeason of Flame.\n\n\t\"Spyro: Season of Ice\" was first released for the GBA in 2001.  The sequel to the game, \"Spyro: Season of Flame\", was released in 2002 for the GBA.  In the first game, Spyro must recover fairies, and in the second game, he must recover the fireflies, which allow dragon's to breathe fire. \n"}]}
