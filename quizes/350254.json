The best way to attain the shield is to stock your party with all the lucky abilities you can manage, giving you a slightly higher chance of collecting the shield, and fighting bookmasters like mad until one of them finally drops the shield.  Some players are lucky enough to get it with only fighting a few; but be warned that it may take several hundred battles before you are finally able to get it.\r The Defender is just as rare; and can be obtained from a defender heartless dropping his shield.  The Chain Gear is not so rare; and can simply be bought from Moogles.  The Save the King is an extremely powerful weapon for Goofy to yield, and is only attained after winning the Hades Cup in time trial mode; an improbable task to be sure! \n"}, {"text": "In \"Plants Vs.
