They had been to a dinner party at the Club Chateau with James Allen's boss and decided to get away from it together.\r James Allen is a World War I veteran who has returned home after the war. When the depression took effect he found himself out of work and living in a shelter in the southern state of Georgia. He gets involved in a robbery at a diner and ends up serving a long jail sentence, working on the chain gang. He eventually escapes and makes his way to Chicago where he becomes successful in the construction industry. His former girlfriend, Marie, tracks him down and blackmails him into marrying her. He meets Helen in Chicago and Marie denounces him to the police. He ends up back on the chain gang, but eventually escapes again. He spends the rest of his time permanently on the run from the police.\r The last lines of the film are:\rHelen: \"How do you live?\"\rJames Allen: \"I steal.\"\r The film loosely portrays the story of Robert E. Burns, who actually helped with the production of the film for a few weeks, while still on the run from the authorities in Georgia. All of the other films were also released in 1932. \"Horse Feathers\" starred the Marx Brothers, \"The Big Stampede\" starred John Wayne and \"As You Desire Me\" starred Greta Garbo.\r Quoted by cyberhen \n"}, {"text": "\"Roads?

Fox) and Marty's girlfriend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) into the time-traveling DeLorean to head into the future (and set up the sequel). When Marty worries aloud that they don't have enough road ahead of them to get the car up to the magic speed of 88 mph, Doc Brown responds with the quote above, and the car then sprouts wings and takes off into the sky.\r When the camera pans back to show the flying car, it's clear the filmmakers goofed up--the road stretches off into the distance, so Marty shouldn't have been worried. There was plenty of road ahead to accelerate up to 88 mph.\r Quoted by jwerth \n"}, {"text": "\"You're not so tough without your car, are ya?\"\n\nThough injured, with a bat in hand, Phoebe knocks the villainess to the ground while making this statement. From which movie is this surprising, yet comedic remark?", "correct": "Kindergarten Cop", "options": ["Gone in 60 Seconds", "Days of Thunder", "Mad Max"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKindergarten Cop.\n\n\tIn \"Kindergarten Cop\" (1990), Phoebe O'Hara (played by Pamela Reed) has been badly injured by Eleanor Crisp. Eleanor Crisp and her son Cullen Crisp, Sr. are desperately seeking Cullen's young son, who is being protected from his evil father. Upon finding him, they stop at nothing to try to kidnap the boy, which is when Eleanor drives her car into Phoebe. Injured and weak, taking a bat in hand and heading to the defense of Detective John Kimball (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), Phoebe manages to knock Eleanor down and out with a baseball bat while expressing this great quote, \"You're not so tough without your car, are ya?\"\r Quoted by Funnytrivianna \n"}, {"text": "\"Every man... every man has to go through Hell to reach paradise.\"\n\nGregory Peck and Robert Mitchum starred in the 1962 movie containing this quote, but in which film can it be found?", "correct": "Cape Fear", "options": ["Moby Dick", "Night of the Hunter", "To Kill a Mockingbird"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCape Fear.\n\n\tSam Bowden is an attorney who, 14 years ago, withheld evidence in his client Max Cady's rape trial that would have knocked years off Cady's sentence.\rWhile in prison, Cady dreams of taking his revenge against Bowden. In his mind, Bowden is the reason he's lost his wife, his child, and 14 years of his life. When Cady is released, he heads straight for Bowden looking for revenge. But instead of going after Bowden himself he focuses on his wife and daughter. The context of the quote is from the scene where Max Cady tricks Bowden's daughter Danielle into meeting him, allegedly for a part in a school drama. Danielle quickly discovers the ruse and curious, she asks of Cady: \"Well um, why do you hate my father?\" To which Cady answers: \"I don't hate him at all. Oh, no, I pray for him. I'm here to help him. I mean, we all make mistakes, Danielle. You and I have. At least we try to admit it. Don't we? But your daddy, he don't. Every man carries a circle of Hell around his head like a halo. Every man, every man has to go through Hell to reach his paradise.\"\r Quoted by _Morpheus_ \n"}, {"text": "\"Ahem, according to Starfleet medical research... Borg implants can cause severe skin irritations. Perhaps you'd like an analgesic cream?\"\n\nThese words were used in a rather pathetic attempt to stall the advance of twenty ruthless, terrifying, and rapidly approaching Borg in the film, \"Star Trek: First Contact\". Who said them?", "correct": "EMH Mark I", "options": ["Nicky the Nose", "Dr. Beverly Crusher", "Lily"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEMH Mark I.\n\n\tThe EMH (Emergency Medical Hologram) Mark I, the same model as \"Star Trek: Voyager's\" Doctor, was played in this cameo appearance by Robert Picardo. The Borg have boarded the Enterprise, and Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) activates the EMH program in a desperate measure to stall for time. The EMH promptly responds with his usual line, \"Please state the nature of the medical emergency.\" Upon being informed that the emergency involves twenty Borg about to break through the door, the EMH objects, \"I'm a doctor, not a doorstop,\" a variation on Dr. McCoy's classic line. Beverly suggests that he \"do a dance,\" or \"tell a story.\" I, personally, think the analgesic line was much better - though I doubt the Borg were impressed.\r \"Star Trek: First Contact\" (1996) starred Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, James Cromwell, and Alice Krige (the Borg Queen). The film was directed by Jonathan Frakes, who plays Commander William T. Riker. The Enterprise NCC-1701-D of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" having been destroyed in the previous film, \"Generations\", the crew now serves aboard Enterprise NCC-1701-E. The Borg have traveled back in time to just before mankind's first warp flight in the 21st century, in order to prevent Earth's first contact with the Vulcans. Of course, the Enterprise crew must stop them before history is changed irrevocably, and humanity is assimilated.\r The \"future\" setting of the movie (Stardate 50893.5, year 2373) takes place during the television series, \"Deep Space Nine\", where Worf should be stationed during the time this film covers. However, DS9's Defiant, captained by Worf, is sent to intercept the Borg cube and, the Defiant becoming disabled in the battle, Worf transfers onto the Enterprise for the remainder of the film.\r Quoted by Darthrevan89 \n"}, {"text": "\"Wanna ride on my Segway?\"\n\nWhat movie is this quote from?", "correct": "Paul Blart: Mall Cop", "options": ["The Terminal", "Hot Rod", "Mallrats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop.\n\n\tPaul Blart is an overweight man whose wife died recently. He lives with his only daughter and his mother and he cannot seem to get a date, not even online. He finally meets someone at the mall named Amy, and he begins to fall in love with her. He asks her to ride on the Segway, in which she replies \"Won't you get in trouble?\" Paul says \"Yes, I could lose my job.\" Of course, Amy still takes a ride on the Segway.\r Quoted by Salami_swami \n"}, {"text": "\"Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?\"\n\nIn this film, the high school principal, Mr Vernon, is explaining the rules to his Saturday morning detention students when the student John Bender asks Mr Vernon the question above.  What film is it?", "correct": "The Breakfast Club", "options": ["Sixteen Candles", "Weird Science", "Pretty in Pink"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Breakfast Club.\n\n\tThe character of John Bender is played by Judd Nelson.  He depicts a rebellious high school student, and he says this to his school principal in this 1985 film.\rThe film is about five high school students who have to serve Saturday detention together. The teens are all from different walks of life, but during the course of the film, they find that they have more in common than they think.\r Quoted by fredfrank \n"}, {"text": "\"I'm gonna eat your brains and gain your knowledge.\"\n\nIn which film did Dr. Block mutter this quote to his wife?", "correct": "Planet Terror", "options": ["Death Proof", "Hell Ride", "Dawn of the Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlanet Terror.\n\n\tTheatrically released as one of the two films in the Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez double-feature offering, \"Grindhouse\", \"Planet Terror\" was the first to be shown of the two.  Directed by Robert Rodriguez and released in 2007, \"Planet Terror\" is about the release of a certain dangerous chemical known as DC2 into the atmosphere, resulting in the transformation of any exposed victims from bumbling Texan townsfolk into the living dead.  Starring Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Marley Shelton, Quentin Tarantino, Naveen Andrews, Bruce Willis, Michael Biehn, Fergie (of the Black Eyed Peas), one of the director's sons (Rebel), and two of the director's nieces as 'The Crazy Babysitter Twins', the film was the more action-packed of the two.  Robert Rodriguez has also directed \"Sin City\" and \"Spy Kids\".\rThe quote in question was actually mentioned more than once in the movie.  Although Dr. William Block mentions this line to his wife in the end of the movie, it is first mentioned by his son (Tony) earlier in the film, foreshadowing the events yet to come.  Soon after saying the line, Tony and his father pray for \"no dead bodies for daddy\" while his mother, Dakota, plans to run away with her lover, after working the night shift with her husband in the local hospital.  Of course, none of this goes according to plan.\r Quoted by Kyleisalive \n"}]}
