Initially, he thought he would try and rent out the Marsten House, a creepy, decrepit house overlooking the town, but he was shocked to discover that it had already been bought.\rWhen he arrives in the town, he walks through a small park and meets the young Susan Norton, who is reading a copy of \"Air Dance\", one of his books.  They discuss it before Ben asks her on a date.  She gladly accepts and they talk at a local diner.  Susan discusses how she is into art, and how she has been selling pieces around the county to make money to move to New York City and start a career.\rAll the while, Ben can't get his mind off the Marsten House.  When he was younger, in order to gain initiation into a club, Ben had to enter the Marsten House (abandoned after the murder of Mrs. Marsten and the suicide of Hubie Marsten) and take a small souvenir.  A snowglobe, his choice, had been taken with him that night.  He still has it.  However, Ben decided to go to the top floor, to the room where Hubie Marsten supposedly hanged himself.  When he opened the door, he saw the body hanging there, and it opened its eyes to stare at him.  Ben fled from the house, and the idea has haunted him ever since. \n"}, {"text": "What type of attraction did Straker and Barlow open in the town of 'Salem's Lot?", "correct": "Antiques shop", "options": ["Ice cream parlour", "Convenience mart", "Haunted house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAntiques shop.\n\n\tMears soon discovers that the owners of the mysterious Marsten House are a certain Kurt Barlow and Richard Straker who plan to open an antique shop in the center of town to house wares for tourists passing through town.  This information is held by the town's real estate agent, Lawrence Crockett, who recounts his odd experience with Straker in his office.  Straker had seemed to know the whole deal, inside and out, and upon checking out the legal work, Crockett found no reason not to sell it to him.\rShortly after the duo moves in, Danny and Ralphie Glick pass through a forest in town.  Soon, they are pursued by an unknown creature who takes Ralphie and leaves Danny on the forest path.  When Danny returns home to his worried parents, Ralphie is nowhere to be found.  What they don't know is that across town, Ralphie is becoming the first sacrifice to the creature settling in 'Salem's Lot. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Danny Glick end up dying?", "correct": "The hospital", "options": ["None of these", "The Marsten House", "The forest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe hospital.\n\n\tAs time goes by in 'Salem's Lot, Hank Peters and the Royal Delivery Service are called in to help move furniture to the new antiques shop and the Marsten House.  Although most of the furniture is to be sent to the new shop in town, one large box is to be brought down to the basement of the Marsten House.  Hank is also instructed to leave a large padlock on the table in the basement.  The men don't question the loud clunking sound from the box as they navigate the dark basement, and on the way back out, Hank forgets the padlock and needs to rush back down to leave it.  Both men are clearly frightened.\rMeanwhile, Danny Glick falls into an unstable condition and is taken to the hospital.  A few days later, despite the fact that he seems to be going back to normal, he dies in his room. \n"}, {"text": "Which character brought Mike Ryerson home?", "correct": "Matt", "options": ["Ben", "Lawrence", "Susan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt.\n\n\tAfter the funeral of Danny Glick, Mike Ryerson is instructed to bury the coffin.  However, due to an abnormal sensation, he ultimately decides to dig the coffin back up and open the top.  He finds what he was looking for: the body of Danny Glick, and all the while, he's watching him with his eyes wide open.  Mike faints and wakes up in the forest a while later.\rLater that week, Matt Burke stops by the bar and finds a nervous and ill-seeming Mike Ryerson.  He offers to take him home and gives him a bed in the spare bedroom.  Mike constantly worries about his own well-being and fears for himself in the night.  Matt leaves him in the room with the window locked, but in the middle of the night he hears noises from the room.  Now afraid, Matt takes a large Bible from his living room and calls Ben, who is staying at a boarding house in town.  He also tells him to bring a crucifix. \n"}, {"text": "Who ends up sending Ben to the hospital?", "correct": "Floyd", "options": ["David", "Susan's mother", "Matt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFloyd.\n\n\tWhen Ben arrives at Matt's house, the two make their way to the bedroom and find Mike dead in the bed.  They form a story and decide to make sure the police don't suspect them.  They also realize that the window was opened from the outside.\rWhen Ben goes across the Lot, he is attacked by Susan's ex-boyfriend, who is mysteriously dressed.  As a result, Ben is sent to the hospital to recuperate from his wounds.  Susan visits him there and he tells her to visit Matt to hear the story.\rShe ends up taking his advice and finds Matt at his house, nervous about the situation.  As he tells her the story, they hear someone enter the bedroom upstairs, and Matt tells Susan to continue talking as he makes his way upstairs with the Bible.  Opening the door to the spare bedroom, he finds Mike, in his vampire form, laying on the bed.  Mike rises, but Matt retracts his invitation into his house and forces Mike to leave out the window.  During this, Matt has a heart attack, and Susan calls his personal physician. \n"}, {"text": "Jimmy Cody is a mortician.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tJimmy Cody is Matt's physician, and after both Ben and Matt are sent to the hospital, he is briefed on the vampire situation that is beginning to plague 'Salem's Lot.

Mrs. McDougall finds her infant son dead in his crib while Floyd Tibbits is sent to the morgue.  Somehow, though, Floyd rises from the metal slab...\rMark Petrie, who Danny and Ralphie Glick were walking through the forest to see, is visited in the night by a vampiric Danny Glick, who is floating at his window.  Mark's knowledge of horror movie monsters gives him the upper hand, and he is able to defend himself from Danny's enticing eyes with a makeshift cross.  He vows never to open the window for the boy and says to himself that he won't tell his parents. \n"}, {"text": "Who bites Jimmy at the morgue?", "correct": "Mrs. Glick", "options": ["Mr. McDougall", "Mrs. Norton", "Mr. Lawrence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMrs. Glick\n\n\tWhen Ben is able to leave the hospital, he and Jimmy Cody make their way to the funeral home to see what happens to the bodies inside.  However, while they wait, Marjorie Glick transforms into a vampire and angrily attacks the duo.  Jimmy is bit on the hand before Marjorie is finally defeated, but thinking fast, Jimmy dopes himself up and extracts the infected blood from his own hand, preventing him from becoming a vampire as well.\rMeanwhile, across town, Susan ascends the hill to the Marsten House.  As she nears the house itself, she is surprised by Mark Petrie, who has also ventured to the area to solve the mystery.  The two go inside, and although they feel that everything is safe, they neglect to hear Straker come up behind them in the kitchen.  While Susan is taken to the basement, Mark is tied up in the room that once contained the body of Hubie Marsten.  He manages to escape this, however, and he knocks out Straker as he re-enters the room.  When he attempts to reach the basement though, he decides to call for Susan instead.  She barely wakes up before screaming.  Barlow bites her while Mark flees. \n"}, {"text": "Who is forced to defeat the vampire Susan?", "correct": "Ben", "options": ["Father Callahan", "Jimmy", "Mark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen.\n\n\tWhen Jimmy and Ben reunite with Matt, Mark also unites with the group and they decide that they must take action at once in order to stop the invasion.

After this, they return to the Marsten House and discover that the blessing holds true.  Ben is able to destroy the front door of the house with his blessed hands.  When the group goes to the room that once contained Hubie Marsten (and a short while ago, Mark) they find Straker hanging from the ceiling, sliced open, and bleeding on the floor- punished for his failure.\rThe group then proceeds to venture into the basement where they find a note from Barlow mentioning them all by name.  They also find Susan, sleeping on a table.  Ben forces himself to destroy her with a wooden stake, and the others place her into a wooden coffin and send her down the river. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Father Callahan flee to in the end?", "correct": "New York City", "options": ["Detroit", "Chicago", "Boston"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York City.\n\n\tWhile Ben and Jimmy stay with Matt in the hospital, Mark and Father Callahan try to tell the truth to the Petrie parents, but they don't understand until it's too late.  Barlow, sensing that the group is split up, goes to the Petrie household and kills Mark's parents, cracking their skulls together.  While Father Callahan holds off Barlow with his cross, Mark flees for the hospital.  Unfortunately, the cross doesn't hold back the darkness and Barlow overtakes the priest, forcing him to drink the vampire's blood.  Now unclean, Father Callahan can no longer return to his church (his hands burn when he attempts to open the doors).  He catches the next bus and leaves 'Salem's Lot for New York City.\rMark returns to the hospital as Mrs. Norton, realizing that things are awry, and blaming Ben, enters the hospital with a gun in hand.  The orderlies discover this, however, and stop her before she reaches Matt's room.  Mark, Jimmy, and Ben decide that they need to find the hiding places of the local vampires, so they set out for some of the more obvious places.  They find a sleeping, vampiric body of Mike Ryerson hiding in the darkness of Barlow and Straker's antiques shop before realizing that the abandoned school would be the perfect place for Barlow to hide.  This is further enforced by the fact that chalk was on his hands when he grabbed Mark in his house.  They make a note to check the next day.  Unfortunately, Matt has a heart attack in his hospital bed and dies that night. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Barlow's coffin finally found?", "correct": "In the basement of the boarding house", "options": ["In the Marsten Place", "In the antiques shop", "In the abandoned school"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the basement of the boarding house.\n\n\tWhile the group discovers more and more vampires sleeping and hiding within the houses of 'Salem's Lot, Ben realizes that the chalk on Barlow's hands was from the pool table in the boarding house basement.  Over the past few days, Barlow had seduced Eva and made her into a vampire to take over her basement.  Jimmy and Mark head to the house to find the site, but Jimmy is killed as he falls into the basement, landing on a knife trap left by the vampires.  Mark quickly rushes to Ben and tells him the sad news, and they prepare for their final battle.\rReturning to the basement, the two use their holy water and weapons to reveal a chamber behind a large wooden cabinet that houses Barlow's coffin.  They attempt to drag it outside to the light, but they run out of time before dusk and have to open it to stake him in the heart.  During this time, however, Mark looks into the vampire's eyes and goes mad, trying to kill Ben.  Ben manages to hold him off and plunge the ash stake into Barlow's chest, killing him as they flee town.\rYears later, Mark and Ben return to the lot to finish some business.  Ben first returns to the boarding house and destroys the snow globe he pulled out of the Marsten House that one day as a child.  He also destroys his story, which was left behind after he ran.  The two drive up to the Marsten House and quickly set some wild grass ablaze, leaving the fire to purify the rest of the town. \n"}]}
