{"id": "392380", "name": "Let Them Wear Capes! Quiz | Comics | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Comics", "Comic Books Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Superman's red cape isn't only a stylish and memorable accessory; it's part of his history.  Who originally made his cape?", "correct": "Martha Kent", "options": ["Lana Lang", "Jor-El", "Lois Lane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartha Kent.\n\n\tOriginally part of the costume designed by Martha Kent, the red cape has become part of the Superman image though it was originally done for sensible and practical reasons that were more to do with the creation of the original comic than anything in the story itself.  To reinforce the idea that Superman could fly, the cape was used to give an appearance of motion; simple as that. The fluttering cape was better able to convey the idea of flight instead of, say, leaping or falling in each panel.  The cape was also originally meant to hide his Clark Kent clothing, but that never really ended up being a major feature. \n"}, {"text": "In many forms of media, Batman's cape has been proven to have which of these unique traits?", "correct": "Bulletproof", "options": ["Sentience", "Breathable skin", "Light-reflective surface"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBulletproof.\n\n\tWhile the Batsuit has taken on various forms over the countless TV series, comics, graphic novels, and films in the \"Batman\" canon (including the one with those Bat-Nipples...but let's not discuss \"Batman & Robin\" anymore), some features have been seen repeatedly.  Batman's cape, for instance, has always been made of a sturdy-enough, billowing material that can prevent fire damage or, in some cases, hails of bullets. In some depictions, the cape has also been used for flight, though not all versions allow for this.  Christopher Nolan's Batman use the cape to fly using a special fiber that solidified when exposed to an electric jolt. \n"}, {"text": "Marvel hero Doctor Strange uses which of these relics to fly?", "correct": "Cloak of Levitation", "options": ["Monk's Tunic", "Cape of Flight", "The Strange-Glider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCloak of Levitation.\n\n\tThe Cloak of Levitation, while a magical object, also seems to have a significant amount of sentience, operating of its own will while successfully aiding Doctor Strange on many occasions.  In the 2016 Marvel film, Strange is saved in battle by the cloak on several occasions.  While the origin of the cloak is a bit of a mystery, it first appeared in comics as far back as 1963, inevitably becoming an integral part of the protagonist's wardrobe and featuring in several comic arcs. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Marvel heroes is typically seen with a red cape?", "correct": "Thor", "options": ["Iron Man", "Captain America", "The Incredible Hulk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThor.\n\n\tWhile Thor's cape doesn't really get much coverage in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a tool, his humble garment (often seen when Thor appears in his undisguised form) can actually be used to create small windstorms.  Most of the capes in the movie series (besides Doctor Strange's) are worn in the \"Thor\" films while the rest of the lead heroes opt not to don them in favour of thrusters, a place to hang their buckler, or, in the Hulk's case, the opportunity not to destroy more clothes. \n"}, {"text": "Comic book antihero Spawn is able to control his cape with which of these?", "correct": "His nervous system", "options": ["Heat", "The pull of the moon", "His hand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis nervous system.\n\n\tSpawn is a unique character in that most of his powers are infused into him via necroplasm, a substance that flows not only through him, but most of his enemies and has its sources in Hell.  As such, Spawn's abilities, including his ability to wield his cape, are attached to his body-- in this case, his nervous system-- and it actually acts, in some instances, as a separate entity.  So because of this, it's possible for Spawn not to be in complete control of what his cape does, but by fighting with the necroplasm within, he's able to use it in battle. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these X-Men villains is commonly seen wearing a cape?", "correct": "Magneto", "options": ["Juggernaut", "Sabretooth", "Apocalypse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagneto.\n\n\tFirst appearing in \"The X-Men\" #1 back in 1963, Magneto has rarely strayed away from his common wardrobe choices including a telepathy-blocking helmet and a cape which, really, doesn't have any powers.  That said, in the comics it's a good way for artists to demonstrate Magneto's unique levitation abilities which can be accomplished by manipulating magnetic fields.  In the \"X-Men\" film series, Magneto has often been depicted wearing an asymmetrical cape for reasons unknown. \n"}, {"text": "What colour is the cape of Fantastic Four villain Doctor Doom?", "correct": "Green", "options": ["Red", "Black", "White"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen.\n\n\tUnlike many Marvel creations who wear capes, Doctor Doom's doesn't really carry many magical powers, but the hood he adorns is almost iconic on the character.  First appearing in the \"Fantastic Four\" series, but crossing over into \"Infamous Iron Man\" in 2016, Doctor Doom has often been shown as a supervillain but inevitably became a hero when he joined The Avengers in the \"AXIS\" storyline. \n"}, {"text": "Although this DC hero wears an outfit with a lightning bolt on the front, they wear a gold cape on their back.  Who is it?", "correct": "Captain Marvel", "options": ["Black Panther", "Ant-Man", "Ghost Rider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Marvel.\n\n\tAlso known by the name 'Shazam' in some comics, Captain Marvel was a DC hero originally made by Fawcett Comics back in the late 1930s and, though he seemed to be a direct copy of Superman, he ended up finding a great amount of popularity in the '40s and '50s.  Weirdly, Captain Marvel Jr.'s cape inverts the outfit's colours-- it's a red cape.\rCaptain Marvel, of course, should not be confused with...uh...Captain Marvel (the Marvel superhero created in the late-1960s by Stan Lee) who, in most iterations, does not wear a cape at all. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the X-Men is often depicted in a cape?", "correct": "Storm", "options": ["Jean Grey", "Jubilee", "Psylocke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStorm.\n\n\tOroro Monroe, better known as Storm, has had many costume changes over decades of \"X-Men\" comics (beginning in \"Giant-Size X-Men\" in 1975), but most of them have featured capes of some sort from her Norse mythology phase (where she wore Freya's blue cloak) to her time on the '90s animated show (and her white outfit) and beyond (and her blue and black capes).  Storm, of course, has the power to control the weather. \n"}, {"text": "What dark-costumed character has the ability to open rifts into a shadow dimension?", "correct": "The Cloak", "options": ["The Tunic", "The Cape", "The Jacket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Cloak.\n\n\tPart of the Marvel crime-fighting duo of Cloak and Dagger, the Cloak is a unique mutant who is able to draw people into another dimension or navigate his way through his rifts to teleport.  Often donning a dark cloak of shadowy material, his costume is used to great effect to simulate the opening of rifts.  His companion, Dagger, can create light daggers of psionic energy that can be used to harm or heal.  Although they first appeared in \"\rPeter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man\" in the early 1980s, they soon got absorbed into the \"X-Men\" series. \n"}]}
