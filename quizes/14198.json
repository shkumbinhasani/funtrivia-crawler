{"id": "14198", "name": "Seedy Section of the Forest Quiz | Botany | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Botany", "Angiosperms and Gymnosperms"], "questions": [{"text": "Believe it or not, the development of seeds was a major step in the evolution of plants. First to develop were 'naked' seeds (not surrounded by fruit), which can be found among the conifers and other plants of what taxonomic division?", "correct": "gymnosperms", "options": ["angiosperms", "liverwort", "bryophytes"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngymnosperms.\n\n\tThe word 'gymnosperm' is derived from the Greek: 'gymno,' naked, and 'sperm,' seed. \n"}, {"text": "The next big advance, seedwise, was the evolution of flowering plants which surround their seeds with lovely nutritious tissue (aka fruit). To what division do these plants belong?", "correct": "angiosperms", "options": ["bryophytes", "gymnosperms", "liverwort"], "explanation": "\n\n\nangiosperms.\n\n\tThe fossil record indicates angiosperms appeared near the end of the Cretaceous period. \n"}, {"text": "Well, seeds are very nice, but you still have to have two parents. In plants, the parents are haploid gametophytes (the male gametophyte is often contained in a grain of pollen), and they produce a diploid sporophyte, which in turn produces gametophytes of both genders. What is this pattern called?", "correct": "alternation of generations", "options": ["Krebs Cycle", "the Krebs Alternation", "Calvin Cycle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nalternation of generations.\n\n\tIn a haploid gametophyte, each cell has only 1 copy of each {chromosome;} in a diploid organism, each cell has 2 copies (like in humans). Plants have alternation of generations because both stages are multicellular (unlike humans). The Calvin Cycle is involved in {photosynthesis;} the Krebs Cycle is critical to aerobic cellular respiration. \n"}, {"text": "In flowering plants, the zygote is only one fertilization product. The other, the product of an event called 'double fertilization,' is a triploid cell that arises from the union of one sperm cell with two polar nuclei from the embryo sac. What is this triploid cell called?", "correct": "endosperm", "options": ["apple", "triploidon", "gametophyte"], "explanation": "\n\n\nendosperm.\n\n\tThe endosperm has three copies of each chromosome. It provides nutrition for the growing seed. \n"}, {"text": "Flowering seed plants are often divided into two groups: monocotyledons and dicotyledons. What does 'cotyledon' mean?", "correct": "seed leaf", "options": ["fruit", "vein structure (on surface of leaf)", "supporting root"], "explanation": "\n\n\nseed leaf.\n\n\tA seed leaf is the first effort at photosynthesis by a germinating seed. There are other differences between 'monocots' and 'dicots', ranging from root arrangement to internal stem structure, but seed leaves are the difference most noticeable to the layman. \n"}, {"text": "The earliest known seed plant, Elkinsia polymorpha, appeared in what geologic time period?", "correct": "Devonian", "options": ["Mesozoic", "Cretaceous", "Cenozoic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDevonian.\n\n\tThe Late Devonian period was about 380 million years ago. \n"}, {"text": "An unfertilized seed is partially surrounded by an integument (or protective layer). The hole in the integument is what pollen enters through; what is this opening called?", "correct": "micropyle", "options": ["gametophyte", "endosperm", "drilone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmicropyle.\n\n"}, {"text": "What is the process in which a seed begins to grow into a plant?", "correct": "germination", "options": ["dormancy", "budding", "birth"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngermination.\n\n\tGermination can be triggered by a number of factors, and it may be several years before a seed germinates. \n"}, {"text": "The protective layer surrounding a seed is also known by which of these less scientific-sounding names?", "correct": "seed coat", "options": ["seed pod", "skin", "seed armor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nseed coat.\n\n\tA seed pod encloses a collection of different seeds, not a single seed like the integument does. Many thanks to player barefoot_walker, who was kind enough to inform me that the words hull, husk, and aril - among others - are also often used to refer to the integument. \n"}, {"text": "Seed plants evolved in the oceans and only later made the transition to land.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSeeds only appeared rather late in the development of terrestrial (land) plants. \n"}]}
