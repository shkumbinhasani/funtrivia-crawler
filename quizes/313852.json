{"id": "313852", "name": "Lady Gaga: Queen of the Disco Stick Quiz | Music | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music L-P", "Lady Gaga"], "questions": [{"text": "Appearing on the cover wearing diamond-covered shades and holding onto her 'disco stick', what is the name of Lady Gaga's debut album?", "correct": "The Fame", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fame.\n\n\tSomewhat emphasizing Lady Gaga's 'in your face...with fame' attitude, the title \"The Fame\" applies through most of Gaga's appearances and works.  Since its release in mid-2008, \"The Fame\" has gone platinum in a number of countries and has won a fair number of awards.  It's been #1 on the Billboard Electronic CD chart on four separate occasions and has reached #1 in five different countries.\rThe album cover for her debut CD sees Gaga wearing her crystallized shades and holding an illuminated disco stick (a scepter, also with crystals, which lights up in her hand).  These fashion items persisted through a number of Gaga's early television appearances and concerts including her appearance in the fourth season of \"So You Think You Can Dance\".  It's only the tip of the iceberg in her wardrobe though... \n"}, {"text": "Lady Gaga's debut single, \"Just Dance\", featured guest vocals from which of these musical artists?", "correct": "Colby O'Donis", "options": ["Akon", "Timbaland", "Justin Timberlake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColby O'Donis.\n\n\tGoing four times Platinum in the United States and six times Platinum in Canada, \"Just Dance\" was a #1 single on the Billboard Pop Single chart for over a month in 2009.  It also charted as #1 and #2 on the Hot 100 and Hot Dance Club Play charts.\rFeaturing Colby O'Donis with guest vocals (a number of months before O'Donis' first CD would be released), \"Just Dance\" gained major appeal with listeners after Gaga's appearances during the swimsuit portion of the 2008 Miss Universe Pageant and her first \"So You Think You Can Dance\" performance.  As a result, her album sales boosted.\rTypically, this song is one of the few to feature her disco stick exclusively and it's often regarded as one of her trademark singles.  The music video also features Gaga riding a plastic dolphin in a wading pool.  Classy. \n"}, {"text": "Lady Gaga's lesser-known song \"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\" was used to promote what short-lived ABC TV show?", "correct": "Dirty Sexy Money", "options": ["Eli Stone", "Shark Tank", "Women's Murder Club"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDirty Sexy Money.\n\n\tWhile the music video comes in two different versions, one of these was actually used as a promotional tool for the soon-to-be-canceled \"Dirty Sexy Money\", which lasted a mere two seasons.  Another instance of eccentrically odd fashion, Gaga is seen in this video wearing very large, red shoulder pads and little else. (As a side note, Gaga has claimed in various publications that she doesn't like to wear pants so that her vision-impaired grandmother can see her better during her performances as her legs are a lighter tone than her outfits...seriously.)  The song is fairly upbeat and hard-hitting compared to most of her other songs on \"The Fame\" album. Although the song really never took off as a single, one can only suspect that her popularity from \"Just Dance\" allowed her to burn a fair bit of money in this music video. \n"}, {"text": "According to one of Lady Gaga's singles, what is something you \"can't read\"?", "correct": "Her poker face", "options": ["Braille", "Her book of secrets", "Her dirty mind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer poker face.\n\n\tThe second single off her \"The Fame\" CD, \"Poker Face\" actually sold less copies in the United States than \"Just Dance\" (though it still reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Pop 100, Hot Dance Airplay, and Hot Dance Club Play charts amongst others).  Regardless, it was an important single for Gaga due to its popularity amongst listeners...that is before \"Boom Boom Pow\" by the Black Eyed Peas knocked it off the charts.  Filled with sexual innuendos and poker/card game lingo, the song was a benchmark of what to expect from our eccentric popstar.\rThe music video featured Gaga at a poker game- of course she has a number of state-of-the-art outfits...one of which features a mask made of mirrors and another of which looks to be made of the same hard plastic used to strap people into rollercoasters.  More shoulderpads ensued. \n"}, {"text": "Which of Gaga's songs contains the lyrics \"Cherry cherry, boom boom\"?", "correct": "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)", "options": ["Boys Boys Boys", "Retro, Dance, Freak", "Paper Gangsta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say).\n\n\tWhile definitely not one of Lady Gaga's more popular songs, \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\" was the third designated single from \"The Fame\".  Although it slowly made its way through some international charts, it didn't actually break out in the United States.  The song is a more friendly, pop, song than Gaga's other songs on the CD.  The music video, much like her others, features a number of unique fashion and hair styles.  She also sits on a Vespa in some really uncomfortable positions for a little while.  You know how it is...\rThe lyric itself is a reference to music producer Martin Kierszenbaum who wrote the one song on Lady Gaga's debut CD.  How does someone get that nickname? \n"}, {"text": "Lady Gaga's first tour was presented under which name?", "correct": "The Fame Ball Tour", "options": ["The Disco Stick Tour", "The Summerboy Tour", "The Radio Gaga Tour"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fame Ball Tour.\n\n\tA combination of theatrical performances, highly choreographed dance numbers, many and varied outfits of all shapes, sizes, colours, and geometric shapes, and interspersed videos comprised of pop art-esque snippets of Lady Gaga's life, the Fame Ball Tour was a weird achievement in itself.  Notable for being both a concert and a 'show' all at once, Lady Gaga used this first tour to establish herself as a new icon in all different respects: music, fashion, and art.  Praised by critics, the show was a surprise hit. \n"}, {"text": "Which of Lady Gaga's songs actually mentions the disco-stick?", "correct": "LoveGame", "options": ["New York", "Bad Romance", "Brown Eyes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoveGame.\n\n\tThe fourth single off of Lady Gaga's \"The Fame\", \"LoveGame\" is actually quite smutty.  Highly sexual and based around the idea of playing games, the song was one of the most popular singles from the CD.  The music video for the song takes Lady Gaga underground to a subway where she and a number of dancers take to a subway train car to dance and perform.  Soon, things get steamy in a car park.  It's kind of flashy, yet kind of unsanitary all at the same time.  The song reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club chart and went two times Platinum in Canada. \n"}, {"text": "In May 2009, Lady Gaga appeared on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\".  What was unique about her dress on the cover?", "correct": "It was made entirely of clear, plastic bubbles", "options": ["It was comprised of a slender black dress complete with a black feathered neck brace and half-face-mask", "It covered her entire body, obscuring her face in a red, lace mask", "It was created out of fifty Kermit the Frog plush toys sewn together and wrapped around her body"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was made entirely of clear, plastic bubbles.\n\n\tThose who have seen any of Lady Gaga's television performances wouldn't be surprised to know that all of the possible answers are actual outfits worn by the singer.  In fact, shortly after Gaga wore the Kermit outfit, she showed up with the real Kermit the Frog as her date to the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The bubble dress worn on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\" has made appearances on Lady Gaga's tour and on TV and has become one of the more notorious pieces of fashion she has come up with.  The other two selections, as well as a small space-age-style dress, one outfit with an eskimo-style fur-lined hood, and a trendy white leotard (which she bled through in her somewhat over-dramatized performance), appeared at the same MTV Video Awards ceremony. \n"}, {"text": "Which song's music video, which was released as Lady Gaga's fifth single, was produced as a short film directed by Jonas Akerlund?", "correct": "Paparazzi", "options": ["Summerboy", "I Like It Rough", "Monster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaparazzi.\n\n\t\"Paparazzi\" was a much less 'dancey' song from Lady Gaga's first CD.  Instead, listeners were given a slower pop song in which she sings about love and fame (seems about par for the course, right?).  \"Paparazzi\" appeared on three different Billboard charts and the music video, directed by Akerlund, was the recipient of an MTV Video Music Award for Art Direction and Special Effects in 2009.  At eight minutes long, the video followed the story of Gaga as an up-and-coming star who is nearly killed by her boyfriend. After a short time of recuperation (during which many odd outfits are worn and danced in...including a metallic, suit-of-armor-like costume with crutches) she returns and poisons her boyfriend.\n"}, {"text": "In October 2009, Lady Gaga appeared on which TV show to have a catfight with Madonna?", "correct": "Saturday Night Live", "options": ["MadTV", "Late Night with Conan O'Brien", "So You Think You Can Dance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaturday Night Live.\n\n\tThe second show of \"Saturday Night Live's\" thirty-fifth season saw Ryan Reynolds and Lady Gaga guest-starring, and in one of the show's sketches, Lady Gaga and Madonna danced and sang together in a short number before tugging at each others' hair and clawing at one another.  Kenan Thompson, during the sketch, sat the both of them down on either side (while Madonna shouted \"What the heck is a disco stick?\") and asked them to kiss and make up.  Before this could turn into another Madonna/Britney Spears taboo-breaker, he moved in the way.\rIn addition, Lady Gaga performed the song \"Bad Romance\" for the first time on TV to promote her debut album's rerelease known as \"The Fame: Monster\".  Leading herself into the song with \"LoveGame\" and wearing an odd hula-hoop/Da Vinci contraption, she sat down as a piano and belted out her new song.  Another sketch showed Lady Gaga and cast member Andy Samberg both wearing the 'bubble dress' from the \"Rolling Stone\" cover. \n"}]}
