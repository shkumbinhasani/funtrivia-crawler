Sitting on the couch she finds her reminiscing about past, particularly the night she triumphed over the previous Supreme, Anna-Leigh Leighton.  The year was 1971.  The previous Supreme became the leader after performing the Seven Wonders. Fiona said that she knew she was becoming Supreme.  While her powers flourished, Anna-Leigh's were diminishing.  That night, she slit Anna-Leigh's throat to speed along the process.  Spalding saw the whole thing. \n"}, {"text": "What was Kyle's mother planning to do before Zoe called?", "correct": "Hang herself", "options": ["Arrange the funeral", "Find a new man", "Fly to Brazil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHang herself.\n\n\tHeading to a jazz bar for a drink Fiona recalled her past triumphs in love as well, being able to woo men without fail.  Unfortunately, with her powers waning, she started finding herself unable to attract.  To combat her worries, Fiona makes her way to a doctor considering plastic surgery.\rZoe decides to visit Kyle's mother.  With his death still a fresh memory, the two of them talk about the recently-deceased boy.  His mother talks about his intellect and politeness and Zoe recalls his kindness.  What his mother reveals, however, is that moments before receiving the phone call about her son's passing, she planned to hang herself.  She decided not to only when she picked up the phone and spoke to Zoe.  Zoe claims that she will see him again; he has not left them yet. \n"}, {"text": "Fiona returns to the Academy to find LaLaurie watching which of the following 'horrible' things on TV?", "correct": "President Obama's inauguration", "options": ["\"Soul Train\"", "The movie \"Precious\"", "\"Sister, Sister\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nPresident Obama's inauguration.\n\n\tMadison, Queenie, and Nan watch from a high balcony of the Academy as the new neighbours, a Christian mother and her attractive son, move in.  When the son, Luke, takes off his shirt, his mother, Joan, tells him to go inside and put on some clothes, while scowling at the witches across the way.\rInside the Academy, Fiona returns home to find Delphine LaLaurie watching some historical events on TV, particularly President Barack Obama's inauguration.

Fiona, in a moment of brilliance, informs LaLaurie that she is the new maid. \n"}, {"text": "Fiona decides to make Delphine the slave of which girl at Academy?", "correct": "Queenie", "options": ["Nan", "Zoe", "Madison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueenie.\n\n\tIn the Dining Room, the girls discuss their sexual exploits and Queenie reveals that she's never been with a guy (or, rather, Nan reads her mind).  When LaLaurie enters the room, Queenie calls her out for hitting her over the head with a candlestick a couple days earlier.  Delphine, however, takes it upon herself to chastise the girl for being black saying that there are limits to her servitude.  Fiona stops any altercations and informs the girls that Delphine is now Queenie's personal slave; there's nothing she hates more than a racist.\rOut in the swamp, Misty listens to Stevie Nicks with Kyle who, now healed, is calmer and more coherent.  She tells the reanimated boy that one can't really be themselves and come into their own until they find their tribe.  When Zoe returns, she decides to take Kyle with her, promising that she'll be back.

It turns out that Nan makes the right move; it's Luke's favourite cake.  Joan emerges in the doorway and thanks the girls, but insists that they'll need to leave for Bible Study; they can share the cake there. Madison makes it clear that she has no interest in their views.  When Joan tries to grab the knife from her hand, Madison uses her telepathy to fling the utensil into the opposite wall.  As they leave, Madison, unaware that she could, ignites the drapery in the adjacent room with her mind. \n"}, {"text": "What does Joan Ramsey deliver to Fiona as a gift?", "correct": "A Bible", "options": ["A cake", "A crucifix", "A bottle of wine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Bible.\n\n\tCordelia visits a specialist, continuing her attempt to get pregnant.

She has cancer.\rZoe brings Kyle back to his mother's house and, instead of being there for the moment, props him up at the door, knocks, rings the buzzer, and flees the scene, running back to her car.  She leaves the two to reunite.\rBack at the Academy, Joan stops in for a visit, delivering a Bible as a gift.  She says that she will not have the girls at her place again as she could go to the police in regards to Madison's assault with a deadly weapon and arson.

She remains shocked and he remains unable to communicate.  She lays down with him and expresses her concern.  When she brought him a towel in the shower, he was not the same person he once was; his body makes him look like someone else.  She says it doesn't matter though as he's still her little boy and they're together again.  When she starts to kiss him and make sexual advances, he begins to cry.\rCordelia makes her way to Cornrow City, Marie Laveau's salon in the Ninth Ward for her appointment with the great witch of voodoo.  There's no need for introductions; she's there about a fertility ritual.\rOn the day of the ceremony, Cordelia would need to bring two ounces of her husband's semen in a jar and, after Laveau eats a spicy pepper to attract the gods, they would sacrifice a goat.  She would then sleep for four days and four nights.  They would also need a New Moon.  Oh-- and $50,000.  Oh-- and Laveau would never give her the ritual, not after Fiona stopped in the previous week to enforce their rivalry and spark war. \n"}, {"text": "Fiona admits to being a horrible mother for Cordelia.  What's the topic of the first lesson she teaches Madison?", "correct": "Self-preservation", "options": ["Manipulation", "Kindness", "Attraction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSelf-preservation.\n\n\tBack at the Academy, Nan tells Zoe that she obviously likes Kyle; Zoe tells her to stop listening into her mind.  That's when she gets a call from Kyle's mother telling her to come by.\rFiona takes Madison out for lunch so that they can discuss her burgeoning powers.  They also discuss Fiona's failed relationship with her daughter and Madison offers a way to make things right by allowing her to teach what she knows.

During their discussion however, Delphine is scared by a figure out the window-- Bastien, her former houseboy and torture victim, returned to do Marie Laveau's bidding.  That's when Delphine reveals to Queenie that she is, in fact, Delphine LaLaurie, the former social elite of New Orleans.  Queenie says that she should have Delphine killed for her past but LaLaurie insists that she tortured the boy for ravaging her daughter.  When she begs for mercy, Queenie decides to take matters into her own hands, taking a bit of her slave's blood and wandering outside to lure it away from the Academy.  When they reach the back of the house, however, Queenie attempts to seduce the bull-headed slave, suggesting that they both deserve love.  She cowers as the creature advances on her.\rKyle, meanwhile, is bothered by his mother who, frustrated with his new, introverted self, tries to get him to talk.  This causes him to become enraged, however, and to stop her he smashes her head in with a trophy.  Zoe arrives on a dinner invitation to find the corpse on the floor; Kyle is covered in blood in the hallway behind her. \n"}, {"text": "According to Fiona, the coven doesn't need a new Supreme.  What does it need?", "correct": "A new rug", "options": ["A new leader", "A bit of fear", "Hope"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA new rug.\n\n\tFiona and Madison head to play pool at a local bar and the Supreme finds that her new pupil is turning heads, so much so that she sees a bit of herself in the young girl.  They return to the Academy soon after and enter the front parlor where Fiona says to get her portrait painted while she's young.  She also reveals that Madison has to be the next Supreme because her powers are waning (as she's dying of cancer and won't last the year) while Madison grows stronger. Her life force is literally pouring out of her body and into Madison's.  Madison says that she can get her help, but Fiona won't go out old, shriveled, and weak; she'll die in style. She admits to being a bad Supreme and cutting her throat, right where they stand now, and using the knife on the piano next to them.  She hands the knife to Madison and tells her to kill her for the sake of the coven.  In their struggle, Fiona slits open Madison's throat with the same knife, killing her nearly instantly.  Spalding, watching from the doorway, hands her a handkerchief and is instructed to clean up the body, burying her deep.  Fiona says that the coven doesn't need a new Supreme; it needs a new rug. \n"}]}
