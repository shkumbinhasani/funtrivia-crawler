{"id": "197761", "name": "Hardest Citizen Kane (Part 3) Trivia Quiz | Citizen Kane . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Citizen Kane"], "questions": [{"text": "When we last left the tale we were following the story of Mr. Bernstein, Charles Foster Kane's assistant.  Bernstein recollects the early days of the 'New York Inquirer', a newspaper owned and managed by Kane.  One of Mr. Kane's first acts as the new publisher of the 'Inquirer' is to include a personal statement on the front page of the paper.  What title does he give this statement?", "correct": "Declaration of Principles", "options": ["The Kane Credo", "Testimonial of the Publisher", "Bill of Reader's Rights"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeclaration of Principles.\n\n\tKane's principles include the following:\r I) I will provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.\r II) I will also provide them with a fighting and tireless \rchampion of their rights as citizens and as human beings. \r After Kane requests that his Declaration be printed, Leland requests the original copy.  He suggests, 'I have a hunch it might turn out to be something pretty important.  A document.  Like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and my first report card at school.' \n"}, {"text": "Kane, Leland and Bernstein look hopefully at the front window of the 'Inquirer' building.  At this point, the circulation of the 'Inquirer' is only 26,000, but they intend to change this.  The three men are then shown looking enviously at the front window of the rival 'Chronicle's' building, with the front window reading 'Circulation: 495,000'.  \n\nKane claims that it took 20 years for the 'Chronicle' to assemble their newspaper writing team.  How long does it take him to acquire the entire 'Chronicle' writing staff for his paper?", "correct": "6 years", "options": ["5 months", "12 years", "1 year"], "explanation": "\n\n\n6 years.\n\n\tIn a visually entertaining transition, the camera moves in toward a painting of the 'Chronicle' writing staff while Kane discusses, with some envy, the 'Chronicle's' success.  Once the 'Chronicle' team is fully within focus of the picture, the scene fades into an actual photographic sitting with the same group of ten men.  \r Kane claims, 'Six years ago I looked at the picture of the \rworld's greatest newspapermen. I felt like a kid in front of a \rcandy store. Well, tonight six years later I got my candy, all of \rit. Welcome, gentlemen, to the 'Inquirer'!'\r The 'Inquirer's' circulation at this point: 684,000. \n"}, {"text": "After a celebratory gala, Kane leaves for Europe for an extended vacation, leaving Leland and Bernstein to run the newspaper.  Kane does not leave the two of them empty-handed, however.  From Europe he sends dozens of art pieces, mostly statues.  Which of these other items does Kane specifically mention he is after in a letter?", "correct": "The world's biggest diamond", "options": ["The Mona Lisa", "Charlemagne's remains", "A Scottish castle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe world's biggest diamond.\n\n\tThough Kane has suggested numerous times that he is not concerned with wealth and fame, the fortune that he now controls has clearly overwhelmed his sensibilities.  He spends lavishly, sending home precious paintings and pricelss antique marble sculptures, among many other objects.  Kane is a man of great appetite, and not only for material objects...he hopes that the purchase of the world's biggest diamond will lure his future wife. \n"}, {"text": "Following Kane's return from Europe, we discover that he will soon be married.  His soon-to-be wife, Emily, is no less than the niece of the President of the United States.  What is her family name?", "correct": "Norton", "options": ["Madison", "Hume", "Ophuls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorton.\n\n\tMiss Emily Monroe Norton, niece of the current president, becomes Kane's first wife.  Their marriage is initially a happy one, but they lose interest in each other, as depicted in the famous breakfast table scene later in the film.  In the Newsreel at the beginning of the film it states that, not long after their divorce, Emily and her son (with Kane) are killed in a car accident. \n"}, {"text": "After receiving nothing from Bernstein about 'Rosebud', the reporter Mr. Thompson decides to have a visit with Kane's old friend Jed Leland.  The cynical and elderly Leland has plenty of gossip for Thompson, not being entirely too fond of his former employer and long-time pal Kane.  In fact, what does Leland call himself in relation to Kane?", "correct": "A stooge", "options": ["A stoolie", "An underling", "A footman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA stooge.\n\n\tLeland has few kind words in his recollection of Kane.  He claims that Kane 'behaved like a swine' and that he did 'brutal things'.  According to Leland, Kane had a 'generous mind', lavish with opinions, 'but that he never believed in anything except Charlie Kane.' \n"}, {"text": "During his interview, Leland reveals something very profound and tragic about Charles Foster Kane.  According to this old friend of Kane, what is the only thing the newspaper man really ever wanted out of life?", "correct": "Love", "options": ["Respect", "Money", "Peace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLove.\n\n\tJedidiah Leland probably knows Charles Foster Kane better than anyone else, so when he makes this revelation it seems rather believable.  Leland insists that Kane wanted love from his wife, and later from the American people in general, and this is what drove his ambition.  Unfortunately, according to Leland, Charles 'just didn't have any [love] to give', the exceptions being to himself and to his mother. \n"}, {"text": "Leland reveals several stories about Kane that allow reversions to flashbacks.  In one such moment, the viewer is taken back to the moment that Mr. Kane met his second wife, Susan Alexander.  From what ailment is Susan suffering on that dark, damp night?", "correct": "A toothache", "options": ["Sprained ankle", "Strep throat", "Food poisoning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA toothache.\n\n\tSusan meets Charles on the sidewalk, the poor fellow just having suffered a splash of dirty rainwater from a passing vehicle.  She tempts him into her apartment with offers of 'hot water', all the while experiencing the painful throbbing of a sore tooth.  In Susan's apartment, the fatherly Kane and the young lady get along nicely, throwing shadows on the wall, wiggling ears and singing gaily. \n"}, {"text": "The next Leland-related flashback depicted is that of Charlie Kane's run for governor.  During his governor's run, who was his hated and much-maligned opponent?", "correct": "Jim Gettys", "options": ["Tomas Giuletti", "Frank Lang", "Phil McClintock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJim Gettys.\n\n\tIn a marvelous set of film cuts, Kane is depicted making a fiery political speech at an interesting variety of angles.  Interspersed with the speech are cutaway close ups of his various supporters and more distant shots of the crowd (which is actually a drawing with holes cut out and lights flashing behind to get the effect of movement).  \r 'Well, I'd make my promises now, if I weren't too busy arranging to keep them.', Kane brags during this grandiose and polemical address to his supporting throng. \n"}, {"text": "Despite his love affair with Susan Alexander being revealed to the world by his crooked opponent, Kane continues his political campaign.  The night of the election, his publishing crew at Kane's 'Inquirer' are deciding between two newspaper headlines.  One reads 'Kane elected', and will be used in the case that he wins.  What will the headline read if his campaign fails?", "correct": "Fraud at polls!", "options": ["The crook wins!", "Election results in question!", "Evil triumphs!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFraud at polls!.\n\n\tAnd indeed Kane does lose...so the headline 'Charles Foster Kane defeated: FRAUD AT POLLS!' appears in the 'Inquirer' the next day. \n"}, {"text": "In one of the most interesting and revealing scenes in the film, Kane confronts a drunken Leland the day after the election.  During their discussion, Leland mispronounces a word.  Which word does he unintentionally slur?", "correct": "Criticism", "options": ["Governor", "Revealing", "Newspaper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCriticism.\n\n\tAnother marvelously shot scene, this one entirely from low angles, involves Kane and Leland talking about the failure of the political campaign.  Leland discusses Kane's extraordinary ego, how he talks of the working class people as if he owned them (making some reference to Kane's 'Declaration of Principles').  He also makes reference to the labor movement, a movement that will take away Kane's purpose for being...that purpose being to have the working man worship at his feet.\r Finally, Leland requests that he be moved to Kane's Chicago paper where he will continue to do 'dramatic crimitism' (Cotten, who portrayed Leland, immediately corrects himself by saying 'criticism'.  This was not an intentional gaff).\r Thank you for trying this quiz.  I hope you enjoyed it and will try the other quizzes in this series. \n"}]}
