All you need is style!", "correct": "Bondi", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBondi.\n\n\t\"James BOND, In a boat...\"\r Bondi Beach is in a suburb of Sydney, Australia's biggest city and the capital of New South Wales. The beach, located on the east coast of the continent, is about a mile (1.6 kms) long and looks onto the Tasman Sea. Famous for its surfing and for the sometimes scanty attire of its fans, the beach attracts tourists and locals alike. The exact origin of its name has been washed away by history; \"Bondi\" is almost certainly an indigenous name, but it isn't known which people may have given it the name, or what the word meant to them. Two popular theories are that it's a reference to the sound of waves over rocks, and that it commemorates a battle that once occurred there. \n"}, {"text": "The Queen of Sheba liked sand. Don't you? All you need is a towel.", "correct": "Bali", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBali.\n\n\t\"The Queen of SheBA LIked sand.\"\r Bali is an island in the nation of Indonesia, south of Borneo and east of Java. On the western side of the Wallace Line, most of its native plants and animals are more characteristic of Asia than of Oceania. Tourists -- especially from Australia, China, and Japan -- flock to Bali for food, fun, beautiful landscapes, and fabulous beaches. Kuta Beach, in the south of the island, is especially popular despite tragic bombings in the town in 2002 and 2005. \n"}, {"text": "With sand by the acre, temperatures suitable for tank tops, and clear blue skies, all you need is a ticket!", "correct": "Crete", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrete.\n\n\t\"...sand by the aCRE, TEmperatures suitable...\"\r Crete is the largest island in Greece, sitting pretty in the eastern Mediterranean. Tourists can see the sites of the ancient Minoan civilization, an advanced society that adored bull dancing and flourished from around 2700 to around 1420 BC. After touring a museum or a palace, however, they tend to head to the beaches, of which the Palm Beach of Vai may be the most famous. \n"}, {"text": "You can build any creature you like out of sand, but beware: silica pet ownership is ephemeral. All you need is low tide.", "correct": "Cape Town & Capetown", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCape Town & Capetown.\n\n\t\"...siliCA PET OWNership is ephemeral.\"\r Cape Town, the second-largest city in South Africa, sits near Africa's southeastern tip. In addition to its fine architecture and nature preserve, and the beautiful Table Mountain, it boasts a wide range of beaches. Those on the Atlantic coast (like Noordhoek or Kommetjie) face the sunset, but the water there is colder than at the False Bay beaches (like Fish Hoek or Boulders Beach). \n"}, {"text": "Here's a screwball beach comedy idea: a cop, a cab, an apple and a leopard are the keys to stopping pollution. All you need is luck!", "correct": "Copacabana", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCopacabana.\n\n\t\"...idea: a COP, A CAB, AN Apple and a leopard...\"\r We've skipped across the Atlantic Ocean to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Copacabana is the name both of a famous beach and of the neighborhood around it. The name, oddly enough, comes from a Bolivian town with a famous icon to the Virgin Mary; that icon is the namesake of the Brazilian beach. With four kilometers of sand and beautiful Atlantic water, Copacabana has no trouble attracting swimmers, surfers, and sand-lovers in general. \n"}, {"text": "Escape November mud and March rains! All you need is sun.", "correct": "Bermuda", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBermuda.\n\n\t\"...NovemBER MUD And March rains!\"\r Bermuda consists of a pair of main islands (plus more than a hundred tiny ones) in the North Atlantic Ocean, on about the same latitude as the U.S. state of South Carolina. It's named after a Spanish explorer, but is administered by the UK as an overseas territory. At various times, insurance has surpassed tourism as the largest sector of the economy, but sun-seekers are still vitally important to the islands. Many of Bermuda's beaches feature fine-grained, pink sand, which makes an appealing contrast to the bright blue Atlantic water. \n"}, {"text": "Prepare for sunbathing with a vanilla rub and a cucumber mask. All you need is a spa!", "correct": "Aruba", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAruba.\n\n\t\"...with a vanillA RUB And a cucumber mask.\"\r Aruba, an island just 27 km (17 mi) off the north coast of Venezuela, is part of the Netherlands. The tourists who flock to its warm, gentle western and southern beaches can doubtless understand why the Dutch hang on to the island! It gets its name from the Spanish for \"It had gold,\" a pressing concern for early Spanish explorers and the government that funded them. \n"}, {"text": "Bah! Amassing wealth can be so dull. All you need is a paperback book.", "correct": "Bahamas", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBahamas.\n\n\t\"BAH! AMASsing wealth...\"\r The Bahamas are an island group north of Cuba. The nation's capital is Nassau; like Bermuda, its economy relies on offshore finance and on tourism. White sand, clear water, and warm weather are quite a draw! Treasure Cay Beach is regularly voted one of the nicest in the world, and there's even a top-tier golf course nearby. \n"}, {"text": "In a deleted scene from Seuss, Sam I Am inquires, \"Would you like it on a beach\"? All you need is a picnic basket!", "correct": "Miami", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiami.\n\n\t\"...from Seuss, saM I AM Inquires...\"\r Sam I Am is a character from Dr. Seuss's classic 1960 book \"Green Eggs and Ham.\" He spends the entire book trying to persuade his friend to sample the eponymous dish, offering it in places as varied as trains, boats, and \"anywhere.\" Perhaps he would have succeeded sooner if he had tried offering it on one of the beaches near Miami, Florida, in the United States. Near Florida's southeastern tip, the beaches are warm and beautiful year-round, as millions of tourists can testify. \n"}, {"text": "Nobody bats a thousand, i.e. goes their whole life without a mistake. All you need is to cut yourself a break!", "correct": "San Diego", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Diego.\n\n\t\"...bats a thouSAND, I.E. GOes their whole...\"\r San Diego is a city on the Pacific Coast of California, just across an international border from the Mexican city of Tijuana. The city's population (well over a million people) enjoy famously beautiful weather all year round, which can be celebrated at any of a number of area beaches. The city itself has quite a view, whose names run the gamut from pedestrian (Pacific Beach) to evocative (Sunset Cliffs). Coronado, a nearby resort city, is home to a gorgeous strip of sand that's often named among the country's best beaches.\r To \"bat a thousand\" means to succeed every single time you try. The saying arises from baseball, where batters' average hit rates are usually reported in thousandths. For example, somebody who gets an average of one hit for every five at-bats is said to bat .200, or \"two hundred.\" \n"}]}
