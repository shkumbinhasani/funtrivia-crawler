{"id": "390535", "name": "10 \"A Streetcar Named Marge\" Questions | 'Simpsons' - Seasons and Episodes Trivia Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Simpsons", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of Meryl Streep's fragrance?", "correct": "Versatility", "options": ["Actress", "Oscar", "Silkwood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVersatility.\n\n\t'Smell like Streep, for cheap!'  As it turns out, Meryl Streep's Versatility, served up in an Oscar-shaped perfume bottle, is the sponsor of the Miss American Girl Pageant on television.  Homer, Lisa, and Bart watch this at the start of the episode, seeing the ladies of America parade their outfits onstage.  Marge interrupts partway through the show, suggesting that she'll be out of the house but she's leaving a low-cal microwavable dinner option for them-- Krusty Brand Slender Vittles.  They don't really pay attention. \n"}, {"text": "Marge claims to have never acted in a play before.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMarge is excited to discuss her plans with the family-- she's auditioning for a stage version of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".  Having not acted in a play since high school, she believes it may be a good opportunity to meet new people.  She proceeds to make practice attempts on the piano in the other room, but her efforts are quashed by the rest of the family, and when she finally gets ready to leave, she's criticized for not telling her plans...even though she did.  She departs anyways, excited to have something new to do. \n"}, {"text": "Who claims to have appeared in a production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in the past?", "correct": "Ned Flanders", "options": ["Helen Lovejoy", "Chief Wiggum", "Otto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNed Flanders.\n\n\tWhen Marge arrives at the Springfield Community Center for auditions she's surprised to see a number of familiar faces, the first being Ned Flanders, who's actually appeared in a stage production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in the past.  Because he went to an all-boys school, he ended up playing the role of Blanche DuBois.  The talk is cut short, however, when the director of the play, Llewellyn Sinclair, arrives to lay down the law. \n"}, {"text": "How many heart attacks has Llewellyn Sinclair claimed to have had?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Two", "Countless", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tLlewellyn Sinclair claims that he's directed three plays in the past and he's had three heart attacks.  Often, he reduces actors to tears during rehearsals, but his reviews are allegedly astounding.  One review he flaunts reads 'Play Enjoyed By All'.  Simple as that.\rHe gets into auditions immediately, asking all those auditioning as Stanley to remove their shirts.  The role almost instantly goes to Ned. \n"}, {"text": "Does Marge receive the Blanche DuBois role?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe role of Blanche DuBois is the big one, and Llewellyn Sinclair dives into vocal auditions for all those looking to take the lead on it.  Unfortunately, none of the women who line up for the role seem to be an immediate fit, so he almost decides to strike the sets and end the production before it's even begun.  Things change, however, when he overhears Marge calling Homer from a payphone, accepting defeat and suggesting that his words-- 'outside interests are stupid'-- were correct.  Llewellyn takes the phone from her hand and hangs it up, claiming that she will be his Blanche. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is taken from Maggie when she arrives at the Ayn Rand School for Tots?", "correct": "Pacifier", "options": ["Blanket", "Teddy bear", "Hair bow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPacifier.\n\n\tSoon, Marge is thrown into rehearsals and problems begin to arise.  With no care for Maggie, Marge has to bring the baby to the community center.  In an effort to get the best performance out of Marge, Llewellyn offers a recommendation to drop Maggie off at his sister's daycare-- the Ayn Rand School for Tots.  Ms. Sinclair seems upsettingly harsh, immediately taking away Maggie's pacifier and locking it away once Marge departs. \n"}, {"text": "Marge is able to channel her character's motivation in rehearsals by picturing whose face?", "correct": "Homer's", "options": ["Llewellyn's", "Maggie's", "Bart's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHomer's.\n\n\tMarge doesn't seem to have any passion in the role, and while she's eager to please, it's hard for her to break out.  In one scene, she tries her best to figure out a Blanche's motivation and argues that she could potentially just take Stanley's abuse with gentle good humour instead of breaking a bottle.  When Homer arrives early to pick Marge up though, she finds her inspiration; he enrages her enough to break the bottle and attack Ned who, in a surprising twist, can't seem to overpower her. \n"}, {"text": "According to Marge, there's a scene in the play about which of these pastimes?", "correct": "Bowling", "options": ["Fishing", "Watching TV", "Drinking beer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowling.\n\n\tAt the Ayn Rand School for Tots, Maggie and the other babies make noble attempts to retrieve the pacifiers from their storage locker but their plans are foiled.  Maggie, caught in one situation, is forced into isolation in 'the box' at one point.\r At home, Marge spends time over dinner speaking in a Southern accent.  When she gets up to go rehearse at Ned's, Homer goes off the deep end a bit.  The ring falls off his pudding tin.  His yelling, fortunately, fuels her anger and she tries to rehearse the broken bottle scene again, much to Ned's worry.  That night, Homer struggles to support Marge with her play and barely makes an effort to conceal his disinterest in going to the one-night-only presentation the following day even though, as Marge says, there's a scene involving bowling that might actually interest him. \n"}, {"text": "Who's removed from the production at the last minute?", "correct": "Otto", "options": ["Jasper", "Lionel Hutz", "Apu Nahasapeemapetilon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOtto.\n\n\tOn the day of the play, Maggie is left at the Ayn Rand School for Tots one last time, and it's then that she and the other babies enact their master plan to beat Ms. Sinclair.  Maggie, crawling into the ventilation, manages to covertly steal the keys from the office desk, get back into the playroom, and open the locker to redistribute the pacifiers to all.  Homer, Bart, and Lisa arrive to pick her up only to find an unsettling room of babies echoing their pacifier noises.\r The family heads to the Community Center though, and while they do, Marge and the other performers have their rally backstage.  Otto is ejected from the cast and the curtain rises to a full house. \n"}, {"text": "According to the song at the end of the play, what's a stranger?", "correct": "A friend you haven't met", "options": ["Your future wife", "Somebody to love", "A streetcar named Desire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA friend you haven't met.\n\n\tIn an interesting twist, \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" is completely reimagined for the community center's play and reframed as a musical about the seedy city of New Orleans.  Though it seems a bit confusing at the start, the crowd seems to get into its groove and become enraptured with what's shown to them. There's even a scene where Marge, suspended on wires during a smoke and laser show, wows the crowd with her descent into madness.  The show gets a standing ovation and Marge receives rapturous applause.  But as the curtain falls, Marge can't help but notice Homer looking sad in the crowd.  After the show, Homer tells her she was terrific; he was sad because Stanley should've been better to Blanche. He reflects that he's been a lot like Stanley, but maybe not for the same reasons.  Oh well.  Can't connect all the dots. \n"}]}
