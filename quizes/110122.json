{"id": "110122", "name": "10 Greatest 'Saturday Night Live' Performers Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Saturday Night Live", "'Saturday Night Live' - Actors"], "questions": [{"text": "Number one on my list of greatest SNL performers is Dana Carvey.  Not only was Carvey a master of impressions, he also created a number of memorable characters that were original and refreshing, including the Church Lady, Hans (of Hans and Franz), and Massive Headwound Harry.  Which of the following Dana Carvey original characters does not relate to the description given?", "correct": "Earl Parsons:  Grumpy Old Man", "options": ["Derek Stevens:  Singer of the cheesy rock ballad 'Chopping Broccoli '", "Lyle Clark:  Owner of Toonces the Driving Cat", "Chris:  Ambiguous lover of the ambiguous 'Pat'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarl Parsons:  Grumpy Old Man.\n\n\tActually, we don't know what the real name of the Grumpy Old Man was, but he was a hoot to watch.  No performer on Saturday Night Live can claim more great impressions than Dana Carvey.  Consider this partial list of his classic impersonations: George Bush (Sr.), Johnny Carson, John Travolta, Jimmy Stewart, Ross Perot, Regis Philbin, etc. I also nominate Dana Carvey for the best impression of a fellow Saturday Night Live performer with his Dennis Miller impersonation.  If these impressions are not enough to convince you, consider that Dana Carvey also served as a sidekick for Mike Myers' Wayne (as Garth), Julia Sweeney's Pat (as Chris), and as Hans of the Hans and Franz skits. In terms of longevity, Carvey can also claim to be one of the longest running performers on the show, featured from 1986 until 1993.  Cool fact:  The Church Lady's real name...Enid Strict! \n"}, {"text": "A close second to Dana Carvey is the ultimate Mr. Steady, Phil Hartman.  Hartman's list of famous characters and impersonations is perhaps not quite as long as Dana Carvey, but I believe that he served as the 'glue' for the show during his years (1986-1994) as a Not Ready for Prime Time Player.  Not only was he a key perfomer, and great supporter for many of the other acts on the show, he also provided some very original characterizations.  Which of these was not a Phil Hartman character on SNL?", "correct": "Jonathan Jan Kolavecci, The Master Thespian", "options": ["Gene, The Anal-Retentive Chef", "Cirroc, The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer", "Russell Clark, Editor of 'Sassy'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJonathan Jan Kolavecci, The Master Thespian.\n\n\tThe Master Thespian was a character played by Jon Lovitz, but the other three were classic recurring roles by Phil Hartman.  Other great impressions by Phil include: Bill Clinton, Ed McMahon (to Carvey's Carson), Phil Donahue, Frank Sinatra, Barbara Bush (now that's range!), Charlton Heston, Burt Reynolds and many others!  It was sad to see such an excellent performer pass away so long before his time.  Cool fact: Phil Hartman was on the show longer than any other regular performer except Tim Meadows. \n"}, {"text": "This is where it starts getting tough, so many great performers to choose from!  For my number three selection I chose Gilda Radner.  One of the members of the original cast, Gilda performed on the show from 1975 until 1980.  We all remember her classic, original characters: Emily Litella, Roseanne Roseannadanna and Baba Wawa.  Gilda also portrayed one of the hilarious 'Nerds' alongside Bill Murray, a couple who were simply made for each other!  What was Gilda's 'nerd' name?", "correct": "Lisa Loopner", "options": ["Rhonda Weiss", "Judy Miller", "Bobbie Paisner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLisa Loopner.\n\n\tSadly, like Phil Hartman, Gilda left us long before her time.  Fortunately we have the legacy she left from her years on SNL and her great character portrayals to keep us laughing.  I think it's safe to say that Gilda was an inspiration to future women who wished to join the cast of SNL.  Cool fact: Gilda was the first of the original cast members to sign on in 1975 for this classic late night television show. \n"}, {"text": "For my number four selection, I have chosen Eddie Murphy.  In 1980, the remaining original cast members had left the show and a new set of performers was about to embark on an unknown project.  Most people did not think the show would remain afloat...they didn't count on Eddie Murphy!  The eclectic mix of clever original characters and amazing impressions that Eddie Murphy developed over his 4 year stint on the show was quite stunning.  Who can forget his impersonations of Bill Cosby, James Brown, Stevie Wonder and Little Richard Simmons?  Apart from these, Eddie created an adult version of the 'Little Rascals' Buckwheat (Buh-Weet), a confrontational live-action Gumby and a spoof on Mr. Rogers (Mr. Robinson).  Speaking of Mr. Robinson, how did he answer the door in his neighborhood?", "correct": "Who is it?!", "options": ["Ain't no one here!", "What do you want!", "I'll pay the rent next week!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWho is it?!.\n\n\tMr. Robinson's neighborhood is a little less friendly than Mr. Roger's, you see?  I think the main reason SNL survived past 1980 was Eddie Murphy's quick rise to stardom.  One of my favorite Eddie Murphy skits was his short film where he made himself up as a Caucasian to see if the world was different in a white man's shoes.  Cool fact: Eddie Murphy is the only regular cast member to have hosted the show while still a cast member.  This resulted from the fact that his co-star from the movie '48 Hours', Nick Nolte, became indisposed and could not host. \n"}, {"text": "Number five:  Will Ferrell.  Just as Phil Hartman was the 'glue' during his years on the show, Ferrell became the 'glue' during his stint.  Will Ferrell's run on the show lasted from 1995 until 2002, and during that time he showed a variety of skills, both as a lead actor and in various supporting roles.  Probably the best times came for Ferrell when he began doing his George Bush Jr. impressions, but one cannot dismiss easily his many other fun characters, such as Steve Butabi (one of the 'Roxbury' brothers), Craig Buchanan (cheerleader, with Cheri Oteri), Ted Kazinsky (the Unibomber) and many others.  Will also did several riotously funny sketches as which game show host?", "correct": "Alex Trebek", "options": ["Pat Sajak", "Regis Philbin", "Bob Barker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlex Trebek.\n\n\tWill Ferrell's impression of Alex Trebek isn't exactly the most convincing, but his obvious frustration at the idiocy of celebrity guests such as Sean Connery makes up for the lack of accuracy.  If his Trebek doesn't tickle you than surely you must have enjoyed his work as Marty Culp alongside Bobbi Mohan-Culp (played by Ana Gasteyer), middle school teachers who try desperately to be hip with their modern pop/rap medleys.  Cool fact: Will Ferrell made more than any other SNL performer during a single season with a salary of 350K + in 2001! (Guess they thought he was the 'glue' too...) \n"}, {"text": "For my number six pick I will return to the original cast again.  Of the original cast members, John Belushi was probably the one who gained the most mass appeal.  Not only was the man funny, creating wonderful original characters like The Samurai Butcher and Pete (the owner of the Greek Olympia Cafe), but he created wonderful impersonations of Marlon Brando and William Shatner (as Captain Kirk).  If this wasn't enough, Belushi performed musical numbers as Jake Blues (of the Blues Brothers) and Joe Cocker.  He also impersonated Beethoven, but with a twist.  His Beethoven was intermingled with which modern performer of music? ", "correct": "Ray Charles", "options": ["Elvis Presley", "Louis Armstrong", "Jim Morrison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRay Charles.\n\n\tIf you haven't seen John Belushi's Ray Charles/Beethoven amalgam, I highly recommend it!  Though John Belushi only appeared on the show from 1975 to 1979, his performances are still memorable to this very day.  Sadly, Belushi became the first Saturday Night Live cast member to pass away when he died from a drug overdose in 1982.  The world lost a great talent that day.  Cool fact: Belushi and Dan Aykroyd actually put out an album as The Blues Brothers called 'A Briefcase Full of Blues'! \n"}, {"text": "Number seven on my list is Jon Lovitz.  Some find Mr. Lovitz annoying, but no one can deny that his talents helped keep the show afloat during the transition period between 1985 and 1990.  After the 1985 season, all of the cast members left the series except Lovitz and Nora Dunn, and Lovitz helped usher in the third generation of SNL performers while creating clever characters such as Tommy Flanagan (of Pathological Liars Anonymous), Annoying Man and Jonathan Jan Kolavecci (Master Thespian!).  Lovitz also appeared as a deadpan Satan, Michael Dukakis and Harvey Fierstein.  Getting back to that liar Tommy Flanagan, who did he claim was his wife?", "correct": "Morgan Fairchild", "options": ["Farrah Fawcett", "Suzanne Somers", "Cheryl Ladd"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorgan Fairchild.\n\n\tWho can forget Tommy Flanagan's wild claims, or Harvey Fierstein's 'Is that so wrong?', or how about his skits with Tom Hanks as two nerds who just couldn't get the attention of any women?  If his work on the show is not enough to convince you, consider this cool fact: It was Jon Lovitz who convinced Lorne Michaels to hire Phil Hartman in 1986! \n"}, {"text": "For my number eight selection I have chosen to go with Mike Myers.  His very memorable, and nearly all original, characters include: Wayne (from 'Wayne's World'), the Sprocket Dieter, Simon (the English boy in a bathtub), and Linda Richman of 'Coffee Talk'.  Which of these was a catchphrase of the Barbara Streisand obsessed Richman? ", "correct": "Like buttah!", "options": ["It's gravy!", "You betcha!", "You're the tops!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLike buttah!.\n\n\tThough Myers (1989-1995) specialized in original characters, and even has found post-SNL success with new ones like Austin Powers, he also did some memorable impressions.  They include: Carl Sagan, Lance Ito and Mick Jagger.  Along with Murphy, Myers has been the most successful former SNL player in films, with his 'Wayne's World', 'Shrek' and 'Austin Powers' as just a sampling.  Cool fact: Mike Myers likes to pull characters from real life.  For example, Linda Richman is based on his mother-in-law...she's like buttah! \n"}, {"text": "Number nine may surprise you, but I have selected Jan Hooks.  Jan Hooks was on the show from 1986 until 1991 and created many memorable characters during her stint on the show, even during a time when the show seemed male-dominated.  Jan Hooks did marvelous impressions as Hillary Clinton, Ivana Trump, Sinead O'Connor and Tammy Faye Baker.  She and Nora Dunn also played a pair of lounge singing sisters who shared what last name?", "correct": "Sweeney", "options": ["Carry", "Hartley", "Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSweeney.\n\n\tLiz (Dunn) and Candy (Hooks) Sweeney established the cheesy singing pair on SNL long before Farrell and Gasteyer tried their hand.  My favorite moment was when Jan Hooks serenaded Paul Simon with 'Bridge Over Troubled Water'.  Cool fact:  Jan Hooks made her first appearance in a major film when she played a tour guide at the Alamo in 1985's 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure'. \n"}, {"text": "Finally, number 10 on my list.  This was a struggle, there are some great ones that I had to leave out.  I went with Chris Farley.  No other performer in SNL history played the self-deprecating role as well as Chris Farley, and his loveable and original characters, such as Matt Foley (motivational speaker), Barney (applicant as a Chippendales dancer) and super Bear's fan Todd O'Connor always displayed clearly his charm.  Farley wasn't only interested in playing the starring role, he also played the supporting actor in such skits as: 'I'm chillin'' (as B-Fats), 'Gap 'Girls'' (as Cindy, the boss) and 'Nat X' (Sandman).  Returning back to Matt Foley, motivational speaker, in what type of vehicle did he reside?", "correct": "Van", "options": ["Boat", "Bus", "Truck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVan.\n\n\tEveryone knows that Matt Foley lives in a van, down by the river!  Sadly, like several other individuals on this list, Chris Farley died young, he was only 33 years old when he died in 1997.  Cool fact: Chris Farley's first film role was in 1992 in Mike Myers' film 'Waynes World'.  Honorable mentions for this quiz:  Dan Aykroyd, Billy Crystal, Tim Meadows, Cheri Oteri, Joe Piscopo, and Martin Short.  Let me know if you agree and who your favorite performers are...thanks! \n"}]}
