{"id": "115684", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'As You Were' Online Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "The opening scene of 'As You Were' unfolds in the officers' club, where the inhabitants of the 4077th occupy themselves with odd activities in the hopes of preventing death by boredom.  While Trapper fidgets with a slot machine and Hawkeye plays pinball, which character is going to work on the piano?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Frank", "Father Mulcahy", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tGary Burghoff, who plays Radar in the series, is quite the musician indeed!  On top of his brilliant drum playing, which we can observe in the episodes 'Showtime' and 'Dear Dad, Again', he is adept at the piano!  This should come as a surprise to those who know that Burghoff has a somewhat deformed left hand (three fingers are shorter than normal).  Apparently Burghoff is quite an accomplished musician, having written dozens of songs and recording an album with his 'Mardi Gras Celebration Jazz Band'.  Burghoff also plays the bugle, though you wouldn't know it from the way he plays in some of the episodes (including this one)... \n"}, {"text": "After we leave the fun of the officers' club we see Henry spending his afternoon sunbathing.  Meanwhile, in the mess tent Trapper and Hawkeye enjoy a cup of coffee while Frank engages in which odd activity?", "correct": "Aligning condiments on the tables", "options": ["Supervising the shining of utensils", "Ordering Igor to taste test that evening's dinner", "Stacking and arranging meal trays"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAligning condiments on the tables.\n\n\tIn a certification of his insanity, Frank has decided to arrange various condiments in a perfectly aligned fashion upon the mess tent tables.  The condiments have been arranged according to height and popularity, which, according to Frank, results in the following order: ketchup, mustard, relish, mayonaisse, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.  He's out of his gourd! \n"}, {"text": "From the mess tent we now find ourselves in Father Mulcahy's tent, where the good chaplain is soaking his feet.  Klinger enters the Father's tent with, what Mulcahy describes as a 'smart' outfit, a pink dress and a blue turban.  Once again, Klinger has devised a crazy plan to acquire his coveted Section 8.  He plans to send a letter to General Mitchell, accompanied by a photo of himself wearing a dress which is an exact copy of one worn by which actress?", "correct": "Rita Hayworth", "options": ["Joan Crawford", "Bette Davis", "Betty Grable"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRita Hayworth.\n\n\tKlinger's plan further involves sending the original photo to General Mitchell's wife if his demand for a psychological discharge are not met.  The photo will be accompanied by a letter claiming that Klinger is General Mitchell's mistress...hairy legs and all!  Incidentally, the dress is a copy of the one Rita Hayworth wore in the film 'Gilda'...the same one the prisoners view in the film 'Shawshank Redemption'.  There must be something special about that film! \n"}, {"text": "We now find ourselves in the Swamp, it's the next morning and Radar's very precise version of reveille can be heard.  Trapper and Hawkeye sip coffee while chuckling over their latest Frank prank.  Frank has been enclosed in a box marked 'Fragile', 'Use No Hooks' and 'This Side Up'.  Hawkeye, later in the episode, claims that several items have been provided for Frank while trapped in the box.  Which of these is not one of them?", "correct": "Water bottle", "options": ["Airholes", "Shredded newspaper", "Lettuce and carrots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWater bottle.\n\n\tApparently, Hawkeye and Trapper truly believe Frank to be a ferret, face and all!  While trapped in the box Frank shouts, 'I'm locked in!'  Trapper promptly responds, 'We all feel that way at times.' \n"}, {"text": "The next scene is one of general hilarity.  Henry gives his commanding officer's monthly orientation lecture, which revolves around a rather sensitive topic.  What is the subject of what has to be the goofiest lecture ever given?", "correct": "Venereal diseases", "options": ["Female reproductive system", "Pregnancy", "Human sexuality"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVenereal diseases.\n\n\tHenry stands before two large, vague diagrams of human bodies, one male and one female.  He proceeds to give a lecture that is even more vague, there's lots of giggling amongst the men...you'd think they were teenagers!  Henry can't bring himself to say 'Venereal disease' or even 'V.D.'  A quote, 'Whatever you do, don't run the risk of catching today's subject!'  As the lecture winds to a close, Radar has a question...'Do you suppose someday you could give us a talk on V.D.?'  Poor kid, just doesn't get it... \n"}, {"text": "Next we see Frank and Margaret in a desperate conversation.  Frank has a certain problem, requiring surgery, but he refuses to approach his swampmates for help.  Margaret insists, however, and Frank finally gives in.  For which problem does Frank need medical treatment?", "correct": "Hernia", "options": ["Appendicitis", "Tonsilitis", "Hemorrhoids"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHernia.\n\n\tThe conversation between Margaret and Frank is rather sad.  At one point Frank, being the monumentally insecure chap that he is, insists that Margaret assess his competence.  'Nurse to doctor, how do I rank as a surgeon?' Frank asks.  Margaret responds diplomatically, 'Frank, don't you have enough pain?' \n"}, {"text": "When Margaret and Frank enter the swamp, they find Trapper and Hawkeye dressed in the most unlikely of costumes.  What sort of costumes have the two doctors ordered, for no explicable reason?", "correct": "Gorilla costumes", "options": ["Connecting horse costumes", "Ancient Roman costumes", "Santa Claus costumes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGorilla costumes.\n\n\tI can't imagine anyone going so far out of their way to order gorilla suits, but this is just what the two mad doctors do in 'As You Were'.  They appear in the suits several times in the episode, and play the parts of gorillas rather admirably I must say! \n"}, {"text": "Before Trap and Hawk can get Frank onto the operating table, the camp receives an onslaught of wounded soldiers.  As per usual, when the operating starts, nearby bombing starts as well.  This prompts Radar to make a few calls to regimental headquarters.  During his two calls Radar claims which two military ranks?", "correct": "Major and Lt. Colonel", "options": ["Captain and Corporal", "Colonel and Sergeant", "Lieutenant and General"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor and Lt. Colonel\n\n\tDuring the first call, Radar becomes 'Major O'Reilly'.  Whomever answers on the opposite end quickly sees through the ruse, they ask for Radar's age.  Radar answers, 'What?  Well, I'm...uh...19.'  Radar's rank elevates to Lieutenant Colonel during the next call, until he discovers that he is chatting with his friend Tony Rizzo, a sergeant.  As can be expected...the bombing doesn't stop. \n"}, {"text": "In a classic Wayne Rogers' scene, we find Trapper taking a break from the operating room, having a cigar.  A nurse soon joins him in the cigar.  Trapper manages to con the nurse into a visit to the supply tent, combining his break time with hers.  Together they have how many minutes?", "correct": "20 & twenty & 20 minutes & twenty minutes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n20 & twenty & 20 minutes & twenty minutes.\n\n\tTrapper: 'Rough, huh?'  Nurse: 'Plenty!'  Trapper: 'Want a puff?' (hands her the cigar) 'I'm takin' 10 minutes.'  Nurse: 'I'm on 10 minutes.'  Trapper: 'Between us we've got 20 minutes, let's go!'  Smooth operator...in and out of the operating room! \n"}, {"text": "In the midst of the busy operating session, Frank's medical condition acts up again...surgery becomes necessary.  At the same time, a local pregnant woman is in the midst of labor.  Who handles the baby's birth?", "correct": "Henry", "options": ["Trapper", "Hawkeye", "Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry.\n\n\tWhile Henry delivers the baby, Hawkeye repairs Frank's hernia.  Frank wakes up at the end of the operation to the crying of the recently born child.  'What's that?' Frank asks.  Hawkeye responds, 'You and Margaret are the parents of a five-pound baby hernia.' I guess the anesthetic wasn't powerful enough to stop the comedy.  Thank you for attempting this quiz.  I hope you enjoyed it...give my other 'M*A*S*H' episode quizzes a try if this one didn't give you a hernia! \n"}]}
