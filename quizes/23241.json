Tesla created the first fluorescent lights and made alternating current available to the masses. His work on alternating current makes it possible for power to be delivered to people as it is today. Tesla also helped to create the radio (wireless communication), but Marconi was given the bulk of the credit, including a Nobel Prize in 1909. After Tesla's death the international scientific community recognized Tesla's contributions to Marconi's work. \n"}, {"text": "Tesla's final project in life was a weapon that he believed would end war as we know it.

This weapon was never created, although some steps were taken by the U.S. government to help institute its creation. Tesla died in 1943 before more work could be done to examine the utility of this weapon. Some believe that Reagan's Star Wars project was based on Tesla's death ray plans. \n"}]}
