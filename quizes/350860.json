{"id": "350860", "name": "War Is Hell! But Sometimes Hilarious - Allo, Allo Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television A-C", "Allo Allo"], "questions": [{"text": "'Allo, Allo' is set in and around the establishment 'Caf\u00e9 Ren\u00e9' in which French town?", "correct": "Nouvion", "options": ["Oradour-sur-Glane", "Clochemerle", "Ville-France"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNouvion.\n\n\tAlthough the establishment which is central to the programme is supposedly fictitious; there must be thousands of 'Caf\u00e9s Ren\u00e9' in France, the village of 'Nouvion' actually exists.  Nouvion, which is also referred to as Nouvion-en-Ponthieu, is a small village or commune of around twelve hundred souls located in the Picardy region of north-eastern France.  During the making of the programme, no filming ever took place in Nouvion but was instead filmed in the county of Norfolk in the east of England. \n"}, {"text": "Central to the plot of wartime sitcom 'Allo, Allo'  for many years of its run on British television,  which valuable item were the Wehrmacht, the Gestapo, the French Resistance and Ren\u00e9 Artois from Caf\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 all trying to procure for themselves and which was contained within a Knackwurst sausage? ", "correct": "'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' by Van Klomp", "options": [" 'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' by Van Klomp", "Hermann Goering's birth certificate", "Secret plans for the invasion of Britain", "Winston Churchill's medical records"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' by Van Klomp.\n\n\tWhen the town of Nouvion fell to the German Forces, its valuable artworks were stolen by the Germans, one of which was Van Klomp's painting 'The Fallen Madonna' referred to by everyone who has seen it as the 'Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies'.  The painting is kept by the local German Commandant and his senior staff officer to provide them with a nest egg for once the war is over. However, Hitler himself learns of the painting and sends Herr Otto Flick of the Gestapo to Nouvion to retrieve the painting and return it to him in Berlin.  Reproductions of the painting are made by a local forger but these get mixed up with the real painting which are rolled and concealed in knackwurst sausages and secreted in the cellar at Caf\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 for safekeeping. It is strange to see, on a visit to Longleat House, a British stately home, a copy of the painting of 'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' that had been commissioned by the BBC and presented to 6th Marquis of Bath for his assistance with the programme. \n"}, {"text": "Madame Edith, played by the wonderful Carmen Silvera, provided the entertainment at 'Caf\u00e9 Ren\u00e9'.  Her speciality was singing and dancing but what indispensible item must the customers have taken with them whilst patronising 'Caf\u00e9 Ren\u00e9'?", "correct": "Earplugs or cheese", "options": ["Their own wine", "Opera glasses", "Papieren, Bitte!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarplugs or cheese.\n\n\t\"Boom! \rWhy did my heart go boom,\rMe and my heart go boom, \rBoom titty boom once I found you\".  \r\"Boom! \r(Ren\u00e9 - \"Edith, you've cleared the room!\") \rI can see love in bloom,\rBoom titty boom all around you\".\r Only slightly more tuneless than Madame Edith's singing voice is that of her mother, Madame Fanny La Fan, played by Rose Hill, and on those occasions when they both entertain the patrons the sound is dreadful; so bad in fact that the locals were known to stick cheese in their ears to block out the sound!  Search for this and other musical gems from the show and I promise you lots of sniggering!  Ironically both Carmen Silvera and Rose Hill could both sing well; Rose Hill particularly, had enjoyed a long and successful career as an operatic soprano having performed with both the Royal Shakespeare Company and Sadler's Wells Company which later became the English National Opera. \n"}, {"text": "Ooooh, Rrren\u00e9!  This was the catchphrase of which cast member that played the role of a waitress and (cough) gentleman's entertainer?", "correct": "Vicki Michelle (Yvette Carte-Blanche)", "options": ["Sue Hodge (Mimi LaBonq)", "Kim Hartman (Helga Geerhart)", "Rose Hill (Madame Fanny La Fan)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVicki Michelle (Yvette Carte-Blanche).\n\n\tWet celery, a flying helmet and occasionally an egg-whisk are all implements used by Yvette to entertain German officers in the rooms above the caf\u00e9.  However, Yvette loves Ren\u00e9 and wants to run away with him to get married in Switzerland.  Unfortunately for Yvette, events conspire to ensure that Ren\u00e9 must remain with his wife Edith.  Unbeknown to Yvette, he was also having a relationship with the other waitress at the caf\u00e9, both Mimi LaBonq and Maria Recamier albeit on different occasions during the show's run, neither of which had any idea that he is seeing the other at the same time! \n"}, {"text": "\"Listen very carefully... I shall say zees ernly wance\" was the catchphrase of Michelle of the Resistance; she was the leader of the Nouvion branch of the resistance whose commander was described as 'Ze one wiz ze big 'ooter' and was played by Kirsten Cooke.  But which branch of the French Resistance was Michelle a leader of?", "correct": "The Gaullist Resistance", "options": ["The Communist Resistance", "The Vichy", "De Geuzen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Gaullist Resistance.\n\n\tThe Gaullist Resistance was one branch of a much wider organisation that carried the war to the Wehrmacht in the occupied areas of France.  Michelle Dubois was the leader of the Nouvion cell and was always devising plans for disrupting the German lines of communication and for helping with any plans for the return of the British airmen to England. Confusingly, and this arises because the viewer is expected to imagine the cast speaking French and not English, she is the only character that can actually speak English.  In order to obtain help from Ren\u00e9 with an operation that Michelle has planned, she leads Ren\u00e9 to believe that she has a crush on him... Unfortunately for her, he believes this to be true! \n"}, {"text": "\"Allo, Night'awk, Allo, Night'awk\"... This was the radio announcement from London when contact on the illegal radio was being made by the British Intelligence Services.  What frightening occurrence took place and which terrified Madame Edith's bedridden mother when the London messages came through?", "correct": "Bedknobs on her bed flashed", "options": ["A bell rang loudly", "Her bed shook vigorously", "Her 'gazunder' vibrated noisily"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBedknobs on her bed flashed.\n\n\tIt is common knowledge in Nouvion that many years ago, Mme Fanny La Fan had a secret admirer; a young artist who gave her paintings and cut off an ear as a token of his admiration for her.  Mme La Fan is constantly being 'courted' by Roger LeClerc, a local forger who was originally asked to produce the forged copies of Van Klomp's 'Fallen Madonna' and who believes himself to be a master of disguise; which he most certainly is not!  Mme La Fan lived in the attic rooms above Caf\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 which unfortunately for her was where the British airmen were also hidden away. On rare occasions Mme La Fan will join her daughter, Mme Edith, in providing song a dance entertainment for, if it can be called entertainment, the locals and the occupying Germans in the bar at Caf\u00e9 Ren\u00e9.   For those who might be unfamiliar with the term, a 'gazunder' is a slang name that was used to refer to a chamber pot; it takes its name from the fact that it 'gazunder' (goes under) your bed. \n"}, {"text": "Landmines, balloons, gliders and rowing boats were all used in numerous attempts to return which assets back to England?", "correct": "The British airmen", "options": ["'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' by Van Klomp", "Von Smallhausen of the Gestapo", "Rescued carrier pigeons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe British airmen.\n\n\tA thread that ran through all nine series of 'Allo, Allo', were the attempts to return the British airmen back to England.  Royal Air Force Flight Lieutenants Fairfax and Carstairs, played by John D. Collins and Nicholas Frankau respectively appeared in series one to seven of the programme's run, finally escaping back to England at the end of series seven although the viewer is given no further information as to how this was achieved; given the comedic effort that the writers had put into previous series, and the importance to the programme as a whole that had been placed on the return of the British airmen, this was something of a disappointment. \n"}, {"text": "\"Ren\u00e9!\"  What are you doing 'olding that serving girl in your arms?!\"  True or false?  Ren\u00e9's immediate first reaction was always to respond with \"Are you blind, woman?\"", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBarely an episode would pass where Ren\u00e9 was not caught in a compromising situation with at least one of his waitresses; in some instances Edith may catch him out on more than one occasion in a single episode.  Ren\u00e9 would always respond with \"You stupid woman!\" before formulating any one of a number of outlandishly unbelievable excuses for doing so! For example, after being caught downstairs, in the dark and wearing only his dressing gown and holding Yvette in his arms, Rene's answer to his wife was that Yvette was upset that he and Edith had not been able to elope together and that the reason that she was wearing roller skates is that she was \"skating to the orphanage, the only place where she knows true 'appiness\"... What is even more unbelievable is that Mme Edith always believed everything that she was told! \n"}, {"text": "The arrival at Chateau Headquarters of which of the following senior German officers was always announced clearly - and very, very loudly - by Private Helga Geerhart of the Wehrmacht?", "correct": "GENERAL ERICH VON KLINKERHOFFEN!", "options": ["GENERAL LEOPOLD VON FLOCKENSTUFFEN!", "EVERY ONE OF THEM!", "AIR CHIEF MARSHALL MAXIMILLIAN VON WINKELMEISTER!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGENERAL ERICH VON KLINKERHOFFEN!.\n\n\tPrivate Helga Geerhart was the apple of Herr Flick of the Gestapo's eye; although he would never admit as much.  Barely an episode of 'Allo, Allo' went by where Helga wouldn't display her stocking tops or find herself reduced to being dressed in nothing more than her Basque or her silk knickers, \"ze ones mit ze little swastikas\" that Herr Flick was so enamoured of.  Perhaps Helga's most popular catchphrase was \"May I kiss you, Herr Flick?\"  Kim Hartman, the actress who played Helga, now has her own production company, 'Quinton Arts', which she founded and runs in partnership with her husband. \n"}, {"text": "In which year did the BBC finally cease producing 'Allo, Allo'?", "correct": "1992", "options": ["2001", "1986", "1978"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1992.\n\n\tBetween 1982 and 1992 85 episodes, in nine series, including the pilot and two Christmas specials were broadcast.  In 1994 a special edition was broadcast by the BBC which consisted, in the main, of clips from the show interspersed with cast interviews.  In 1990 Gorden Kaye was seriously injured whilst driving home after filming when gale force winds blew a piece of an advertising board through his car windscreen resulting  in him suffering severe head injuries; the scar with which the storm left him can be clearly seen in subsequent episodes. Who says that the Germans don't have a sense of humour?  In 2008 a German television channel purchased the rights to broadcast all nine series which were to be overdubbed into German! \n"}]}
