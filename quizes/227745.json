One of his fellow comedians laced the cap of Dougie's water bottle with 12 times the recommended dosage of the stuff, which proved to be fatal almost immediately.  \r (For the record, I can't find any online reference to such a drug, so it's a safe bet that the \"CSI\" writers made it up.) \n"}, {"text": "In \"Last Laugh,\" the killer of comedian Dougie Max confesses on a stage in front of a crowd.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tComedian Michael Borland (Bobcat Goldthwait) is in the middle of a set when he notices that Gil Grissom is in the audience.

Salinger", "F. Scott Fitzgerald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIan Fleming.\n\n\tGrissom goes on to add that he read Fleming's \"James Bond\" novels in his youth...but oddly, that quote doesn't come from any of the novels.
