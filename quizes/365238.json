His mother, one of Marie's salon workers, was hopeful for the future and let him attend an integrated school.  They found the boy, lynched in a tree outside the city.  To right these wrongs, Marie took it upon herself to enact a voodoo ritual, animating and controlling the bodies of Southern soldiers in a New Orleans cemetery.  She sent these soldiers out to kill the boy's attackers, brutally dismembering and eating them all. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Fiona find Queenie after the attack?", "correct": "In the greenhouse", "options": ["On the street", "In the kitchen", "In the yard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the greenhouse.\n\n\tIn the present time, Spalding was about to commence a tea party with his extensive doll collection before he heard Madison and Fiona come in from their night out.  He arrived in the doorway just in time to see Fiona slit Madison's throat with a knife.  As things settle down in the parlor, a loud crash is heard outside, so Fiona goes to investigate while Spalding deals with Madison's corpse.  Fiona finds herself drawn to the greenhouse where she finds Queenie on the ground, bloody and beaten.  Bastien approaches them from behind. \n"}, {"text": "What does Fiona do with Bastien's head?", "correct": "Sends it back to Laveau", "options": ["Buries it in the yard", "Crushes it with magical force", "Uses it for a scarecrow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSends it back to Laveau.\n\n\tFiona awakens Cordelia due to the attack on the coven, bringing her to Queenie's room and telling her that a minion of Hell has been summoned by Marie Laveau.  Cordelia blames her for visiting Marie Laveau; Fiona blames her for visiting as well.  While they argue, Queenie slowly slips away and Fiona is forced to use her healing powers to infuse life into the girl.  They decide that they can't take her to a hospital; they will handle everything internally to avoid getting a visit from the Council.\rFiona finds Delphine hiding in a closet; LaLaurie is surprised that Queenie saved her life and says that Bastien was there for her.  She worries that it may return.  Fiona says it won't.  The next day, an unmarked box arrives at Cornrow City.  When Marie laveau looks inside, it's Bastien's bull head, still alive. \n"}, {"text": "With what does Zoe plan to kill Kyle?", "correct": "Rat poison", "options": ["Gun", "Chainsaw", "Knife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRat poison.\n\n\tZoe, having stayed the night at Kyle's mother's place, finds Kyle hitting his head on the bathtub and worries about what she'll do with the reanimated boy.  She decides to head to the kitchen to make him something and, searching the shelves, she considers ending his life with rat poison.  Mixing the dish she returns to the bathroom to find that he's disappeared.  The front door remains open but, as the sun is setting and it's Halloween, she has no chance of finding him.\rBack at the Academy, Delphine zips Fiona up.  The former fears for pranks and demons on Halloween night, but Fiona isn't worried at all.\rMarie Laveau, meanwhile, plots revenge.  Many years earlier, she and Anna-Leigh Leighton signed the truce between the Salem and Voodoo witches.  Now, they have to fight for survival. \n"}, {"text": "Who summons the Council to Robichaux's Academy?", "correct": "Nan", "options": ["Cordelia", "Queenie", "Fiona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNan.\n\n\tCordelia is concerned with the safety of the coven and she calls Hank who, out on a business trip, assures her he'll be home soon.  The call ends quickly when a woman, Kaylee, arrives at his hotel room door.  It's not long before the two of them head to bed.\rCordelia soothes Queenie in bed while Delphine watches nearby.  When Cordelia leaves the room, LaLaurie thanks the girl for saving her life.  Nan arrives to inform them all that the Council has arrived, headed by Myrtle Snow, Cecily, and Quentin.  While Cordelia thinks that they're there because of Queenie's attack...and then because she may have broken the truce...they reveal that they were actually summoned there by Nan who, unable to hear Madison's thoughts, believes her to be dead. \n"}, {"text": "What is the method of execution for one who has murdered a Salem descendant?", "correct": "Burning at the stake", "options": ["Hanging", "Dismemberment", "Beheading"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurning at the stake.\n\n\tThe Council begins the proceedings to determine the whereabouts of Madison Montgomery by stating that anyone who inflicts grievous bodily harm against a Salem descendant shall be put to death by burning at the stake.  They ask Cordelia about the girl's general mannerisms and her tendency to be out late before asking the other girls some basic questions.  They ask Zoe and Cordelia about her new powers before the latter notices that her rug is missing.  When they speak to Nan she reveals that Madison was developing new powers, particularly pyromancy. \n"}, {"text": "In Baton Rouge, Hank kills a young woman named Kaylee.  How does he do this?", "correct": "He shoots her", "options": ["He crashes a car", "He infects her", "He burns her"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe shoots her.\n\n\tIn Baton Rouge, Hank and Kaylee sit down for a quick meal in their hotel room.  She believes he's a USDA agent and it's clear that she's a little worried that he may have other girls out there.  Somehow, he knew exactly what she wanted from the moment they met.  She says that she likes him and hopes he won't break her heart.  He pulls out a gun and fires it into her neck.\rThe Council opts to speak to Fiona considering the circumstances.  Myrtle clearly takes an opposition to Fiona considering their past, and she brings up a Council meeting in 1971, since she was there when Anna-Leigh 'disappeared'.  Fiona claimed she tried to draw a truce with the voodoo witches; she lied.  Shortly after, Fiona was named Supreme-Elect. \n"}, {"text": "Why was Spalding's tongue removed?", "correct": "To prevent him from telling the truth", "options": ["As punishment", "As a ritual for all witch-serving humans", "He never had a tongue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo prevent him from telling the truth.\n\n\tAfter Fiona was deemed Supreme-Elect, Myrtle vowed to out the truth from the young witch, proving that she was the one who killed Anna-Leigh, and not the Voodoo Witches.  To do this, she used a spell to enchant Spalding's tongue, forcing him to tell the truth under every circumstance.  That night, the evening before he was set to speak in front of the Council in a closed session, his tongue was cut out.\rMyrtle continues, in the present day, that a witch hasn't been burned at the stake since the 1920s.  She calls the final witness-- Spalding. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Spalding claim was responsible for his tongue being removed?", "correct": "Myrtle", "options": ["Anna-Leigh", "Fiona", "Cordelia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMyrtle.\n\n\tWhen Myrtle calls Spalding to stand in front of the Council, she only asks him one question: Who was responsible for severing his tongue?  He takes a piece of paper and writes down the name: Myrtle Snow.\rIn 1971, he heard Myrtle tell someone about his tongue over dinner and, after revealing to Fiona that he had always loved her (and couldn't tell a lie) he cut his tongue out himself.\rMyrtle, furious, tells the Council that she still believes Fiona keeps killing Supremes.  Cordelia informs them all that Madison could not have been the next Supreme as she had a heart murmur, and all potential Supremes typically have glowing, radiant health.  The Council is forced to leave without answers. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Spalding hide Madison's corpse?", "correct": "In the attic", "options": ["In the garden", "In the swamp", "Under the academy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the attic.\n\n\tAs dusk falls on Halloween, Marie Laveau begins a ritual in her salon, bringing the dead to life to strike back at the Miss Robichaux's.\rThe girls discuss Madison, worrying for their fellow witch.  Unfortunately they're all forced to stay inside.  Little do they know, Madison is upstairs, set up for a tea party in Spalding's room.\rAt a local bar, Cordelia and Fiona go out for drinks.  Cordelia asks her why she doesn't like Hank, and she says that he's a liar.  She also asks if she killed Madison, which she lies about and says no to.  When Fiona asks who she thinks is the new Supreme, she doesn't answer.  Cordelia heads to the bathroom and, coming out of her stall, she's splashed in the face with a glass of acid, her attacker leaving unseen.\rBack at Miss. Robichaux's, Luke stops by to deliver a gift for Nan.  When someone knocks on the door, presumably to trick or treat, Delphine answers and finds herself face-to-face with the zombified bodies of her daughters. \n"}]}
