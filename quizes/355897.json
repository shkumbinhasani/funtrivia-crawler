{"id": "355897", "name": "Why Did They Draft Him? Quiz | USA | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "USA", "USA by Player"], "questions": [{"text": "The Portland Trail Blazers had the second pick in the 1984 NBA draft and picked Sam Bowie of Kentucky. The Chicago Bulls must have been delighted with that, as they picked next and selected which player from North Carolina?", "correct": "Michael Jordan", "options": ["Scottie Pippen", "Dennis Rodman", "Steve Kerr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Jordan.\n\n\tThe first pick in the 1984 draft actually went to the Houston Rockets who selected Hakeen Olajuwon; the Nigerian center would go on to lead them to two NBA titles.

The Indianapolis Colts had the first pick and selected Peyton Manning from Tennessee. The San Diego Chargers had the second pick and selected which quarterback from Washington State?", "correct": "Ryan Leaf & Leaf", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRyan Leaf & Leaf.\n\n\tManning transformed the Colts from an NFL doormat into a perennial contender, and led them to victory at Superbowl XLI. The Chargers no doubt had similair hopes with Leaf, but his career was over before it had hardly begun. A poor relationship with his teammates and allegations of a poor work ethic overshadowed his on-field performances during his debut season, which were well below expectations. He missed the following season with injury, and never recovered his college form -  he had retired from the game by 2002. \n"}, {"text": "Alexandre Daigle was selected first overall in the 1993 NHL entry draft, ahead of future all-stars such as Chris Pronger, Paul Kariya and Rob Niedermayer. Which team had the misfortune to make this selection?", "correct": "Ottawa Senators", "options": ["Vancouver Canucks", "Tampa Bay Lightning", "San Jose Sharks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOttawa Senators.\n\n\tDaigle was a center from the Victoriaville Tigres of the QMJHL. The Senators were so desperate to sign him that they were accused of throwing games during the 1992-93 season to ensure they ended up bottom of the standings, and thus have the top pick in the draft. Unfortunately for Ottawa, Daigle failed to live up to his hype, scoring just 74 goals in five seasons before being traded to the Philadelphia Flyers. \n"}, {"text": "Brien Taylor was the first overall pick in the 1991 MLB draft, but never played a single game in the majors.

Things didn't work out for him in the pros however. An arm injury suffered in a fight curtailed his career, and he never made it out of the minor leagues.
