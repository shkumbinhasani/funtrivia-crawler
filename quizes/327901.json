The Senators not only lost 100 games, they did it right by losing 113 against only 38 wins.  It was baseball's worst showing since the 1899 NL Cleveland Spiders.

No other pitcher won more than six games in 1904 for the Senators either. \n"}, {"text": "In 1911, Major League Baseball introduced the Most Valuable Player Award.

The Babe would retire with 714 career home runs. \n"}, {"text": "The 1930s saw four Triple Crown hitters in the decade.  The two in the National League were hit by Chuck Klein and Joe Medwick.

He had two seasons of 23-7 records but came up empty-handed for the Cy Young Award each time.  He was in the top five balloting for the MVP four times, but just couldn't bag one.  Over his 21 seasons and 19 with the Braves, Warren won 363 games against 245 losses.  Ironically, his 363 wins matched the number of career hits that he had also.  The others were not pitchers and never played for the Braves. \n"}, {"text": "The 1950s were ruled by the New York Yankees for their eight World Series appearances in the decade.
