However, dinosaurs were not as 'cool' in the 40's as they are today. What nickname did Gould earn for his interests?", "correct": "Fossil face", "options": ["Dino boy", "Dinosaur breath", "Bonehead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFossil face.\n\n\tHe explained in one of his essays that the constant teasing that 'nerdy' kids must endure probably keeps many brilliant people away from a scientific career. \n"}, {"text": "Gould became a professor at a very young age- 26. At what university did he teach?", "correct": "Harvard", "options": ["Yale", "UCLA", "Columbia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarvard.\n\n\tHe taught many subjects, including geology, biology, zoology and the history of science. \n"}, {"text": "At the age of 30 Gould and Niles Eldredge coauthored a paper on a new theory of evolutionary science quite different from strict Darwinism. What was this theory called?", "correct": "Punctuated equilibrium", "options": ["Founder effect", "Allopatric speciation", "Convergent evolution"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPunctuated equilibrium.\n\n\tThis theory proposed that evolution, rather than being a slow process of gradual change, instead takes place in 'fits and starts', with long periods of stasis punctuated by short periods -in an evolutionary sense; these periods are usually tens of thousands of years- of intense evolutionary change. In 'The Episodic Nature of Evolutionary Change,' in his book 'The Panda's Thumb- Reflections in Natural History', Gould described his theory thusly- 'Eldredge and I believe that speciation is responsible for almost all evolutionary change.Moreover, the way in which it occurs virtually guarantees that sudden appearance and stasis shall dominate the fossil record.All major theories of speciation maintain that splitting takes place rapidly in very small populations. The theory of geographic, or allopatric, speciation is preferred by most evolutionists for most situations (allopatric means 'in another place'). A new species can arise when a small segment of the ancestral population is isolated at the periphery of the ancestral range. Large, stable central populations exert a strong homogenizing influence. New and favorable mutations are diluted by the sheer bulk of the population through which they must spread. They may build slowly in frequency, but changing environments usually cancel their selective value long before they reach fixation. Thus, phyletic transformation in large populations should be very rare-as the fossil record proclaims. But small, peripherally isolated groups are cut off from their parental stock. They live as tiny populations in geographic corners of the ancestral range. Selective pressures are usually intense because peripheries mark the edge of ecological tolerance for ancestral forms. Favorable variations spread quickly. Small peripheral isolates are a laboratory of evolutionary change.' \n"}, {"text": "Gould was most famous as an author of short essays on science. In which magazine were these essays originally published?", "correct": "Natural History", "options": ["Science", "Smithsonian", "The Scientist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNatural History.\n\n\tIt was these essays that were gathered into most of Gould's books. \n"}, {"text": "One of Gould's books was titled 'The Panda's Thumb.' What did the panda's thumb have to do with evolution?", "correct": "An example of imperfect design", "options": ["An example of convergent evolution", "An example of paleontological detective work", "An example of very gradual evolution"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn example of imperfect design.\n\n\tPandas don't really use their true thumbs. Instead, one of their wrist bones- the sesamoid- has evolved into a thumblike structure that the panda uses to grasp bamboo. This is not an ideal structure, but it works. Gould loved to point out such anomalies, stating that they, not perfect designs, were proof that evolution does indeed occur. \n"}, {"text": "One of Gould's works was called 'The Mismeasure of Man.' What was this book about?", "correct": "The heredity of intelligence", "options": ["Rate of growth of human skeletons", "Physical differences between men and women", "Physical differences between human races"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe heredity of intelligence.\n\n\tGould debunked the myths that certain races are more intelligent than others. This book was No. 24 on the Modern Library's list of the 100 greatest English-language nonfiction works of the 20th century. \n"}, {"text": "Gould wrote many essays for the 'New York Review of Books.' However, many of them were not about books on science. What were they about?", "correct": "Baseball", "options": ["Computers", "Stamp collecting", "Education"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaseball.\n\n\tGould loved baseball, and wrote several essays on baseball statistics. According to MSNBC, 'A longtime New York Yankees fan, he appeared in Ken Burns' PBS documentary history of the sport and in 1999 wrote an obituary tribute to Joe DiMaggio for The Associated Press.' His most famous work on baseball is an essay in which he argues that the 'demise of the .400 hitter' is the equivalent of an evolutionary arms race. \n"}, {"text": "Another of Gould's reviews for the 'New York Review of Books' was a scathing review of a book by Charles Murray. What was the subject of this book that so aroused Gould's ire?", "correct": "Theories of racial intelligence", "options": ["Creationism in the public schools", "Astrology", "Warm-blooded dinosaurs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheories of racial intelligence.\n\n\tThe book was 'The Bell Curve', which stated that blacks were biologically intellectually inferior to whites. Gould wrote, 'The Bell Curve, with its claims and supposed documentation that race and class differences are largely caused by genetic factors and are therefore essentially immutable, contains no new arguments and presents no compelling data to support its anachronistic social Darwinism, so I can only conclude that its success in winning attention must reflect the depressing temper of our time -- a historical moment of unprecedented ungenerosity, when a mood for slashing social programs can be power-fully abetted by an argument that beneficiaries cannot be helped, owing to inborn cognitive limits expressed as low I.Q. scores.' \n"}, {"text": "Gould appeared as an expert witness in several court cases. What did the cases concern?", "correct": "Teaching creationism to schoolchildren", "options": ["Generic drug marketing", "Affirmative action", "Ownership of dinosaur fossils"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeaching creationism to schoolchildren.\n\n\tAccording to Jeffrey St. Clair in 'Counterpunch', 'But Gould did more than write about `it; he savored political combat. In 1987, he put his weight behind a court case, Edwards v. Aguillard, challenging Louisiana's Creationism Act, which mandated that creation science (Gould dubbed it 'Genesis literalism') be taught along side evolution. The Supreme Court struck the law down. In 1999, Gould rushed to Kansas to protest the decision by the Board of Education to banish evolution (and the Big Bang Theory) from public school classrooms.' \n"}, {"text": "Gould appeared as himself on one episode of a famous television series. Which one?", "correct": "The Simpsons", "options": ["The Cosby Show", "Star Trek-The Next Generation", "CSI"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Simpsons.\n\n\tWilliam A. Dembski wrote, 'This episode was really a very clever cultural commentary. Lisa Simpson wants to stop a huge mall development from proceeding at 'Sabertooth Ravine' because the ravine is a fossil site. As a compromise, the mall developers decide to let Lisa dig for fossils while they continue to build the mall.While digging, Lisa finds an almost human fossil. Almost, but not quite: in place of arms the fossil has wings. 'It's an angel' declare the naive and religiously motivated townfolk. Lisa, who plays the scientific naturalist, will have none of it. She therefore enlists Gould to prove that the fossil is nothing of the sort.' \n"}, {"text": "Fill in the blank for the following quote from Gould-'Teaching _____________is like teaching English but making grammar optional.'", "correct": "biology without evolution", "options": ["science without ethics", "math without statistics", "medicine without compassion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbiology without evolution.\n\n\tJust as grammar is the backbone of English, evolution is the backbone of biology. \n"}, {"text": "What were Gould's political views best characterized as?", "correct": "Liberal", "options": ["Conservative", "Apolitical", "Middle of the road"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiberal.\n\n\tIn an interview with prominent skeptic Michael Shermer, co-author with Gould of 'Why People Believe Weird Things,' Gould stated, 'I think that the main reason why liberalism is under attack is that is has been so successful. That's the point Galbraith makes and I think he is right. Social Security worked. All these things worked. A sufficiently large number of people are reasonably comfortable now, and many have become enemies of this comfort being extended to the smaller number of people who remain poor.' \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following was a hobby of Gould's?", "correct": "Singing in a choir", "options": ["Raising pigeons", "Mushroom hunting", "Knitting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSinging in a choir.\n\n\tDespite being Jewish and a confirmed agnostic, he sang with a choir for many years. \n"}, {"text": "In 1980, Gould was diagnosed with abdominal mesothelioma, a type of cancer. The cancer went into remission for some years, then returned. Gould worked very hard to finish his magnum opus, probably knowing that he had little time left. What was this book called?", "correct": "The Structure of Evolutionary Theory", "options": ["A Brief History of Evolution", "Equilibrium and Evolution", "Creationism- The False Doctrine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Structure of Evolutionary Theory.\n\n\tIt is a huge work, well over 1000 pages, that documents the history and the future of evolutionary theory. \n"}, {"text": "Another of Gould's most famous essays is called, 'The Median Isn't the Message.' What is the subject of this essay?", "correct": "Statistics of cancer survival", "options": ["The average person's views of science", "Mediocrity in science education", "Fraud in science research"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStatistics of cancer survival.\n\n\tGould wrote that the median survival time for abdominal mesothelioma was only 8 months. To the average person, that seems a death sentence. But Gould, with his statistical training, realized that it was more important to look at the right tail of the survivorship curve- yes, half the people were dead in eight months, but what of the other half? Gould found that that right tail extended for many years, and due to his age, health, and access to medical care he was likely to be on it. He was- and he lived for 20 more productive years.As part of the essay, he wrote, 'It has become, in my view, a bit too trendy to regard the acceptance of death as something tantamount to intrinsic dignity.Of course I agree with the preacher of Ecclesiastes that there is a time to love and a time to die--and when my skein runs out I hope to face the end calmly and in my own way. For most situations, however, I prefer the more martial view that death is the ultimate enemy--and I find nothing reproachable in those who rage mightily against the dying of the light.' \n"}]}
