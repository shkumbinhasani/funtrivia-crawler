{"id": "97771", "name": "Hardest 'M'agnificent Art Terms Trivia Quiz | Art | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Art Terms"], "questions": [{"text": "This 'M' term describes any large stone used to make dolmens (two large upright stones capped by a lintel stone across the top) such as the ones found at Stonehenge.  What is this term which is derived from the Greek for 'large stone'?  \n", "correct": "Megalith & Megaliths & Monolith & Monoliths", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMegalith & Megaliths & Monolith & Monoliths.\n\n\tIn the Welsh language, Stonehenge could be termed a 'cromlech' (concave stone), which describes any circle of oversized, vertical stones.  Megalithic architecture is fairly common throughout the world of ancient times, but the most famous examples are to be found on the British Isles and on Easter Island, where megalithic heads were carved in abundance. \n"}, {"text": "Another very common 'M' term, this one describes a large painting done directly on a wall.  A very popular form during the early Renaissance, when frescoes were frequently executed on the walls of churches, this sort of work was also popular amongst the post-revolutionary Mexican artists of the 20th century.  Which 'M' term are we looking for here?  \n", "correct": "Mural & Murals", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMural & Murals.\n\n\tThe term 'mural' comes to us from the Latin 'murus', which means wall.  Some of the great mural painters include Masaccio, Giotto, Diego Rivera and David Siquieros. \n"}, {"text": "This term does not just describe a simple sketch, but an elaborate preliminary drawing or painting of a larger planned work meant to be shown to a patron.  Which of the following terms best describes such a work?  \n", "correct": "Modello", "options": ["Mutule", "Mullion", "Muntin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nModello.\n\n\tBecause these works were meant to impress wealthy patrons, they normally went well beyond a simple sketch of the intended larger-scale painting.  Some opine that the greatest collection of Modelli (plural form of the Italian-derived term) is that created by Rubens and his workshop.  Given the number of large scale paintings created by Rubens, this should come as no surprise to any art lover! \n"}, {"text": "We'll do a little Arabic now...for a change of pace.  This architectural term describes a slender tower which rises above the surrounding structures in a Muslim city.  From the balconies on these towers the faithful are called to prayer...but what are these towers called?  \n", "correct": "Minarets", "options": ["Mihrabs", "Muezzins", "Madrasahs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinarets.\n\n\tMinarets can be both round and square in plan, but all must contain the balconies from which the muezzins (one of the 3 incorrect answers) call all Muslims to prayer 5 times a day.  It is said that Muhammed the prophet did not like bells, and hence decided on this alternative way to rouse the faithful in the various Arab cities! \n"}, {"text": "This term was coined by Italian Futurist painter de Chirico in 1917 to describe some of his bizarre paintings.  Which term did he use?  \n", "correct": "Metaphysical Painting", "options": ["Magical Realism", "Mundane Quotidianism", "Mystical Surrealism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMetaphysical Painting.\n\n\tThe Italian term, Pittura Metafisica, was useful to de Chirico and some of his fellow Italian artists, such as Carr\u00e0 and Morandi, to describe their surrealistic paintings.  These paintings used strange imagery, alternative perspective and incongruous juxtaposition to promote a sense of unreality probably inspired by the horrors of war.  By 1920 the movement had ended, but the paintings will always endure as a testament to the work of these fascinating artists. \n"}, {"text": "The term 'merz' was self-coined to describe the works of which famed Dada artist?  \n", "correct": "Kurt Schwitters", "options": ["John Heartfield", "Tristan Tzara", "George Grosz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt Schwitters.\n\n\tSchwitters created this nonsense term one day in 1919 while working on one of his many collages.  While randomly chopping bits of magazines, newspapers and pamphlets he came across the word 'Commerzbank', which he had broken down to 'merz' with his scissors.  The word resonated with Schwitters, who henceforth titled his collages 'merzbilden' (merz pictures).  Later in his life his greatest project became his Merzbau (merz buildings), an indoor architectural construct. His first Merzbau in Hanover, Germany was destroyed in World War II bombings, and his second Merzbau was destroyed by fire in Lysaker, Norway in 1951.  His third and final Merzbau remains unfinished but can be viewed at the Hatton Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, in England. It is really impossible to describe the Merzbau, one must see it with his/her own eyes! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these terms describes a stick with padded end that is placed upon a canvas in such a way that her/his painting arm can rest and remain steady?  \n", "correct": "Maulstick", "options": ["Muntstick", "Metzostick", "Modalstick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaulstick.\n\n\tAlso called a 'rest-stick' or 'Mahlstick', this term is derived from the obsolete Dutch word maalstok which literally means 'paint stick'.  A maulstick is especially useful to a painter who requires many small details in his/her painting, so it is no surprise that the Dutch invented it! \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  The term 'mannequin', employed in the modern sense to describe a life-sized figure used to model clothing, comes to us from the Middle Dutch for 'little man'.  \n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tFrom the Middle Dutch 'mannekijn', a diminutive of man, the term manikin, and later mannequin, was drawn.  A manikin, also called a lay figure, is a jointed model of the human body used by artists as a model for their works.  Artists would also dress the manikins up with various clothing in order to create a level of realism necessary for their works. The most famous manikin in the world might be 'Manikin Pis', a statue of a boy in Brussels which the locals dress in strange costumes.  The boy continuously urinates...he's part of the fountain there.  To be frank, not the most thrilling site in the city... \n"}, {"text": "What is the term used to describe a representation of the Virgin enthroned as Queen of Heaven, with Child in arms?  \n", "correct": "Maest\u00e0", "options": ["Millefiori", "Mud\u00e9jar", "Mati\u00e8re"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaest\u00e0.\n\n\tMaest\u00e0 is from the Italian for 'majesty'.  In the typical Maest\u00e0, the Virgin and Child are surrounded by a host of angels and saints, all of your very favorites...if you are excited about such things. \n"}, {"text": "The terms 'Pentelic', 'Parian' and 'Carrara' are all associated with which 'M' of art?  \n", "correct": "Marble", "options": ["Metope", "Mosaic", "Mobile"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarble.\n\n\tPentelic marble was the favorite of the ancient Greeks, brought from Mt. Pentelicon in Attica.  The Elgin Marbles are sculpted from Pentelic marble.  Parian marble, from the Greek island of Paros, was used in the construction of the ancient Mausoleum at Helicarnassus.  Carrara marble, from Tuscany, was the favorite of the greatest Renaissance sculptor, Michelangelo.  So ends my first 'M' quiz, please stay tuned for the second 'M' art term quiz...coming soon!
