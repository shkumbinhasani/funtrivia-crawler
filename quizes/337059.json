I have found it.\"  However, the word had not been around in the times of ancient Greece.

He had perhaps put the golden crown in liquid, seeing that it was more buoyant than solid gold.  Archimedes had discovered that the water level rose when he got in the tub, and he used that on the Golden Crown.  He was so excited that he ran in the streets, still naked and wet from just having gotten out of the tub. \n"}, {"text": "After finishing some of his most famous works, which could take a very long time to finish, Leonardo Da Vinci could have said \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!\"  - but he didn't, of course.  Which of these was not a famous Da Vinci painting?", "correct": "Creation of Adam", "options": ["The Last Supper", "Mona Lisa", "Vitruvian Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreation of Adam.\n\n\tLeonardo Da Vinci painted several masterpieces, of which the \"Mona Lisa\" is the most famous.

The \"Vitruvian Man\" is a very famous drawing of Da Vinci's.  \"The Last Supper\" is one of the most famous religious paintings of all time, along with Michelangelo's \"Creation of Adam\". \n"}, {"text": "The apostle John could have shouted \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" when he finished a book of the Bible.  He might have said this after every book of the Bible he wrote, but which of these did he write on Patmos (according to the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures)?", "correct": "Revelation", "options": ["2 John", "3 John", "John"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRevelation.\n\n\tThe apostle John wrote a total of five Bible books.  He wrote Revelation while imprisoned on Patmos around 96 C.E.  The other four books were written somewhere around Ephesus circa 98 C.E, all after his writing of Revelation.  The first of these was 1 John, then 2 John, and then 3 John, but he did not complete his final book, John, until even later.  John is one of the four Gospels. \n"}, {"text": "When Shakespeare finally finished writing a play, he was probably quite happy.  He might have even said \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" because he had finally written the play.  But which of his plays, assuming the entire thing is kept intact, is his longest?\n\nI'll give you a hint; the play involves seeking revenge to Claudius and Gertrude.  There is also a ghost.", "correct": "Hamlet", "options": ["Romeo and Juliet", "The Comedy of Errors", "Macbeth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHamlet.\n\n\t\"Hamlet\" was Shakespeare's longest play, and because of its incredible length, its entire play would last much longer than the norm.  In fact, this play has (typically) about 4,042 lines.  Of course, varying versions of the play might be much shorter, as some directors decide to remove parts of the play that seem unimportant.  Some even argue whether some lines are authentic or not.  Also, \"Hamlet\" is a very difficult play to direct, because Shakespeare hardly included any stage directions.  The play can be interpreted any number of ways by the director, and therefore, \"Hamlet\" might change completely based on how the director chooses to interpet it.\r In contrast, Shakespeare's shortest play, \"The Comedy of Errors\", had only 1,787 lines.\r From all of Shakespeare's works, including all 38 of his plays, he wrote 118,406 lines total.  Considering that this would average roughly 3,000 lines per play, \"Hamlet\" has quite a huge number with it's over 4,000 lines.  And that would be if you didn't even count all his sonnets!  Remember, counting the sonnets would actually make the \"average\" number of lines in his works much lower.  Indeed, \"Hamlet\" was quite an enormous play.\r I should point out that \"Hamlet\", like all Shakespeare's plays, was edited and re-edited after his death experts using different editions, and so not all scenes from \"Hamlet\" are viewed as authentic by everyone.  However, it is generally accepted that \"Hamlet\" is Shakespeare's longest play. \n"}, {"text": "It took a long time to finish building the first Apple computer, Apple 1, but when it was finally finished, Wozniak and Jobs were no doubt thrilled, and they might have even uttered a \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\".  What did Apple 1 originally sell for?", "correct": "$666.66", "options": ["$8,492.37", "$1,999.99", "$100.00"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$666.66\n\n\tThe first Apple computer was released in 1976.  It was discontinued in 1977, however, when it was discovered that it had many faults.  In fact, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs did everything they could to try and take Apple 1 off the market completely, even allowing trade-ins for people to receive an Apple 2 as a replacement for their Apple 1 computer.  Wozniak liked repeating numbers, so the original price was set at $666.66.\r Since only 40 to 50 Apple 1 computers exist today, they are extremely valuable collector's items.  They can range in value from US$ 14-16,000, but some, if they are still in working order, are sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r One man on an Apple documentary was shown as having originally bought the Apple 1 with an IP address of 005.  This makes it one of the earliest known sold Apple 1 computers, if not the first, if 001-004 were even stickered. \n"}, {"text": "\"It's alive!  It's alive!\"  Instead of yelling this out in excitement, Frankenstein could have said \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" when he realized he had successfully created his monster.  \"Frankenstein\" was written by Mary Shelley, but by what other name was \"Frankenstein\" known?", "correct": "The Modern Prometheus", "options": ["It's Alive", "Frankenstein's Monster", "Percy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Modern Prometheus.\n\n\tThe full title of \"Frankenstein\" is \"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus\".
