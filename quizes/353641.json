Therefore, the bands vary greatly from flag to flag.  Generally, bright blue, red, and orange are used.  Some less common variations include duller and darker shades (more like magenta, periwinkle, and pumpkin), and some appear more pastel in color.  For the most part, however, the bands of color are at least some shade of red, blue, and orange. \n"}, {"text": "The Armenian Coat of Arms contains two different animals, chosen because of their power, wisdom, and courage.

Armenia borders no open water, and is therefore considered landlocked. \n"}]}
