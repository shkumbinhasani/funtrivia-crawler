{"id": "105485", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Love Story' Multiple Choice Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these very un-Radarlike behaviors is the first sign for Trapper and Hawkeye that all is not well for their young pal Radar?", "correct": "He leaves a tray of uneaten food", "options": ["He leaves the duty roster unfinished and the office a pigsty", "He takes a long shower", "He sleeps without his teddy bear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe leaves a tray of uneaten food.\n\n\tAs all  M*A*S*H fans know, in the early episodes of the show Radar is a glutton, so leaving an unfinished tray of chicken legs is a certain sign that something is amiss.  An equally bad sign would have been Radar's taking a shower, an activity he seemed averse to during his stay at the 4077th.  Of course Radar would never neglect his office duties or his teddy bear, but Colonel Blake does recollect some odd behavior from Radar as well. \n"}, {"text": "Trapper, Hawkeye and Henry attend a private meeting regarding Radar, where they share stories of his uncharacteristic behavior.  What does Henry suggest as a first step in discovering what ails Radar?", "correct": "A complete physical", "options": ["A 3 day pass for Radar to Tokyo", "A call to Radar's mother in Iowa", "A visit from Sidney Freedman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA complete physical.\n\n\tThe physical includes X-rays, blood pressure checks, urine samples and a lollipop in the end.  The results come up negative, Radar's health is perfectly fine.  The mystery continues! \n"}, {"text": "The boys finally confront Radar in the swamp after failing to find a cure for Radar's unhappiness.  Frank suggests that Radar is 'gold bricking', but Radar reveals that it's something else, namely a 'Dear John' message from his girlfriend back home.  In what form has she delivered the message?", "correct": "Vinyl record", "options": ["Tape recording", "Christmas card", "Plain old 'Dear John' letter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVinyl record.\n\n\tThe message has been recorded in the 'glass booth of Holtzmann's Department Store' according to his girlfriend.  Fascinating, I did not know that one could cut a record so easily at that time until I rewatched this episode a few years back.  Now all we have are dumb CDs and cassette tapes! \n"}, {"text": "What is Radar's erstwhile girlfriend's name?", "correct": "Linda Sue", "options": ["Betty Anne", "Mary Kate", "Dawn Marie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLinda Sue.\n\n\tA wholesome, all-American girl, or so you would think, this is the first and only mention of her.  Not only is she Radar's girlfriend, but we find out that they are engaged!  Unfortunately for poor Radar, he discovers that Linda Sue has decided to marry his buddy Elroy Fimple.  It's amazing how much Elroy's voice sounds like the actor who later portrays Radar's pal Sparky in another of the first year episodes! \n"}, {"text": "After failing to get a date for Radar with the various nurses at the hospital, Hawkeye and Trapper are at a loss for what to do.  Without warning, while walking with Radar through the camp, two new nurses arrive in a jeep.  Radar is instantly lovestruck by one of these two nurses.  Her first name is Louise, but what is her last name?", "correct": "Anderson", "options": ["Jones", "O'Brien", "Cutler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnderson.\n\n\tLieutenant Louise Anderson, lover of Vivaldi and reader of Plato.  This young woman is obviously way out of Radar's league intellectually, but this does not stop Hawkeye from playing the matchmaker (though it seems he has designs of his own as well!)  I love the line from Hawkeye, 'Radar you got a problem.  This Lieutenant Anderson has a brain!'  Poor Radar, by implication, does not. \n"}, {"text": "In order to get Radar a match with Louise, some intellectual training commences in the Swamp.  Radar is instructed to deliver several very 'thoughtful' lines in case the conversation becomes intellectual.  One of the lines is, 'I consider that horse and buggy thinking'.  What is the other important line for Radar to remember?", "correct": "That's highly significant.", "options": ["Madam, you have impeccable opinions.", "Indubitably, my dear.", "A certainty, to be sure."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat's highly significant.\n\n\tHawkeye also instructs Radar to look bored at times, in a very snooty sort of way.  Trapper's opinion about Radar's 'thoughtful' look?  'He said look thoughtful, not sick!'  When Radar displays his 'bored' look Trapper responds, 'That's your bored look? (Yeah!) Go back to looking sick!' \n"}, {"text": "Now for everyone's favorite line from the conversation had between Radar and Louise in the mess tent.  Which composer's name goes in the following line, as instructed by Hawkeye?  'Ahhh, _____' (Fill in the blank)", "correct": "Bach", "options": ["Mozart", "Tchaikovsky", "Beethoven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBach.\n\n\tNeed I say more here then....Ahhh, Bach?  Actually...I do.  I love Louise Anderson's response to this expression.  She responds, 'What does that mean?  Ahhh, Bach?' To which Radar replies, 'Uh, just that...Ahhh, Bach!' \n"}, {"text": "Also during the mess tent conversation, Radar explains to us why the Roman Empire fell.  According to our intellectual friend, what was the source of the decline and fall of Rome?", "correct": "Internal strife", "options": ["Financial instability", "Barbarian hordes", "Economic implosion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInternal strife.\n\n\tRadar attempts to impress Louise with this tidbit of knowledge after she uses the cliche, 'when in Rome...'.  Talk about your non-sequitors!  By the way, the source of Radar's newfound wisdom?  The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon, of which he has only read the first line. \n"}, {"text": "Of course, Radar's relationship hits a snag when Frank and Hot Lips discover that he is dating a Lieutenant.  Margaret confronts Henry with an ultimatum, break up Radar's relationship with Louise or she will be forced to go over Henry's head.  Trapper and Hawkeye respond by preventing any nocturnal 'events' from occurring between Frank and Hot Lips.  Which of these is a method used by the two Swamp rats to prevent Margaret and Frank from one of their 'secret' meetings?", "correct": "They put chloroform in Frank's cologne bottle", "options": ["They lock Frank in the officer's latrine", "They staple Frank's blanket to his cot", "They make Frank believe he might have hepatitis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey put chloroform in Frank's cologne bottle.\n\n\tPoor Frank is no match for Trapper and Hawkeye, but was he ever?  They also show up in Margaret's bed after having Radar misdirect Hot Lips into post-op. \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  At the end of the episode Radar is mesmerized by Louise's discussion of Bach.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAre you kidding?  Radar probably has no idea what she's saying, and certainly wouldn't here...he sleeps leaning on his hand while she chats away about her favorite composer, only awakened by Hawkeye with one more 'Ahhh, Bach!'
