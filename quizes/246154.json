This was the case with the 1980 film 'Any Which Way You Can', which featured more bare-knuckled fighting than you can shake, well...a fist at!  Exactly what type of primate was Eastwood's co-star, named Clyde in the film?", "correct": "Orangutan", "options": ["Gorilla", "Chimpanzee", "Spider monkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrangutan.\n\n\tClyde the orangutan actually submitted a performance superior to Clint Eastwood's in this film, I thought.  So much so that he probably should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Ape.  Sadly, the orangutan that played Clyde in 'Any Which Way You Can' died a couple weeks after filming...but at least we have this wonderful film epic to remember him by. \n"}, {"text": "You want more cheese, I got your cheese right here!  What could be more cliched than a movie about a young man and woman stranded alone on a desert island, with only their wits and a seemingly endless amount of clothing, photographs and other supplies from a shipwreck to keep them alive.  Yes, I am of course referring to that unforgettable epic 1980 film featuring the near-Shakespearean acting of Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins.  What is its title?", "correct": "The Blue Lagoon", "options": ["Pretty Baby", "Endless Love", "Old Enough"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blue Lagoon.\n\n\tBrook Shields finally won the role of Emmeline in 'The Blue Lagoon' after several actresses, including Lori Laughlin, Kelly Preston, Diane Lane and Dana Plato turned it down.  And what was her reward?  A big win as Worst Actress at the Golden Raspberries.\r This film was such a success that it spawned a sequel, the 1991 bomb 'Return to the Blue Lagoon'.  Ouch! \n"}, {"text": "No movie screams 'early 80s' more than the hilarious comedy 'Caddyshack', which featured a veritable who's who of comedy giants of the era.  Despite the funny checkered slacks, the cheesy hats and the Kenny Loggins theme song, this movie still manages to entertain.  Which of these comic actors did NOT lend his talents to 'Caddyshack', the ultimate in early 80s corny comedy?", "correct": "Steve Martin", "options": ["Rodney Dangerfield", "Chevy Chase", "Bill Murray"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve Martin.\n\n\tAnother movie that featured the amazing acting talents of an animal, this time a gopher puppet that ably duels with Bill Murray for camera time.  Oddly enough, this comedy classic was the only film that featured both Chevy Chase and Bill Murray.  The really crummy sequel 'Caddyshack II' only featured Chevy Chase, Bill Murray elected not to return. \n"}, {"text": "Was there anything more pathetic, and yet more stimulating, than big sci-fi/fantasy extravaganzas that were released in theaters during the early 1980s, just prior to the great revolution in special effects technology?  \n\nExhibit A: 'Flash Gordon'\n\nFeaturing the acting of Max von Sydow, Timothy Dalton and Sam Jones as the title character, 'Flash Gordon' typifies the above-described phenomenon.  Campy, cardboard and loads of fun, the film entertained the heck out of anyone who enjoys a good, gaudy sci-fi epic.  Adding to the atmosphere was the great soundtrack, featuring the title song by what operatic rock band?", "correct": "Queen", "options": ["Led Zeppelin", "The Police", "Jethro Tull"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen.\n\n\tSam Jones was nominated for a Worst Actor award at the Golden Raspberries, but failed to take home that great honor.  'Flash Gordon' essentially launched a long career for him as an actor in low-budget, campy action flicks, so he wasn't complaining.\r As for the Queen soundtrack, I offer you this: 'Flash! Ah-Ah! He'll save everyone of us!' \n"}, {"text": "Imagine this script: A Coca-Cola bottle is discarded by a careless pilot, only to be discovered by an African bushman.  Though it is first treasured by the tribe, it eventually is considered to be an evil thing and one tribesman volunteers to essentially throw it away -- off the edge of the Earth.  \n\nNo way a movie like this could ever get made, right?  Wrong!  It was made and released in 1980!  What was the title of this corny, but unexpectedly funny, film?", "correct": "The Gods Must Be Crazy", "options": ["The Emerald Forest", "The Mission", "A Far Off Place"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Gods Must Be Crazy.\n\n\tJamie Uys, a South African film director, was able to create not one, but two films of this title (including the 1985 sequel).  The star of this film, N!xau (the only lead actor I can think of with a 'click' in his name), went on to star not only in the 1985 sequel, but also in three more sequels produced in China (I kid you not!) \n"}, {"text": "Well before the massive wave of television shows to film in the 1990s, we had 'The Nude Bomb'.  Starring Don Adams in the TV role that made him famous, upon what 1960s television series was this unfortunately very forgettable 1980 movie based?", "correct": "Get Smart", "options": ["Adam 12", "Car 54, Where Are You?", "Dragnet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGet Smart.\n\n\tStripped down to its essentials, this film was a naked, shameless attempt by its producers to make money.  Unfortunately, critics undressed this film to reveal what it really was, a denuded version of the original television show, sans the eminently memorable Barbara Feldon (as Agent 99).  Even hardcore ecdysiasts were unwilling to shed their hard-earned money for this sad farce! \n"}, {"text": "Classic cartoon characters used to be sacrosanct, one would not dream of creating a live action version of them.  All of this changed, however, in 1980 when that old swashbucklin' cartoon sailor with the incomprehensible speech pattern, Popeye, made his theatrical debut.  What loquacious comedy actor really bulked up his forearms to play the spinach binging Popeye in that eponymous 1980 film?", "correct": "Robin Williams", "options": ["George Carlin", "Steve Martin", "Dan Aykroyd"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobin Williams.\n\n\tWow, usually Robert Altman's films are great, but this one, is not quite on the top of his list.  Nonetheless, Robin Williams (in his first film) was able to mutter is way through his role as Popeye with some limited dignity.  Shelley Duvall was perhaps the biggest scene-stealer in this picture, playing the rail-thin Olive Oyl.\r Oh yes, the thing about Robin Williams and his 'bulked up forearms'?  It was a joke...he wore prosthetics! \n"}, {"text": "Three office ladies unintentionally get sweet revenge on their arrogant, chauvinistic boss, kidnapping and hiding him away for several weeks while completely liberating themselves and their co-workers at their office.  What was the title of this 1980 film, an effective comedic shot across the bow of the male-dominated corporate ship?", "correct": "Nine to Five", "options": ["Out of the Blue", "Midnight Madness", "Inside Moves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine to Five.\n\n\tThough the film itself hasn't exactly aged well, the performances of the three female leads, Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton are still charming.  Ironically, in this film dominated by the ladies, perhaps the most entertaining performance is submitted by Dabney Coleman as the unbelievably bigoted and sexist boss Franklin Hart, Jr.\r The cheesiest sequences of the film come when the three leading ladies share their fantasies about how they would overcome their boss, Parton with a lasso, Fonda with a shotgun and Tomlin with rat poison.  The 'Snow White' scene, complete with cartoon animals, is a classic! \n"}, {"text": "Before he did 'Back to the Future', and long before the amazing triumphant success of 'Forrest Gump', this Oscar-winning director gave us the 1980 classic of cheesedom 'Used Cars'.  Name this special effects whiz kid who needed no such devices in this stripped-down film starring Kurt Russell and Jack Warden.", "correct": "Robert Zemeckis", "options": ["Ridley Scott", "John Cameron", "George Lucas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Zemeckis.\n\n\tYou want funny?  This film claims to be one of the funniest.  Just read the tagline: 'Estimated Laugh Count: 287 City, 410 Highway.'  Zemeckis even presents the audience with Lenny and Squiggy of 'Laverne & Shirley' fame, albeit with different names in the movie.  This film single-handedly made it safe for Americans to buy a used car once again. \n"}, {"text": "And now for my 1980 favorite, the cheesiest of the cheeses, I bring you 'Xanadu'.  Complete with bad acting, corny writing and the longest unadulterated singing roller-skating scene in movie history, 'Xanadu' brought film to a new level of cheesehood.  Who among these fine actors and actresses was NOT a part of the wonderful cinematic experience that was 'Xanadu'?", "correct": "John Travolta", "options": ["Michael Beck", "Olivia Newton-John", "Gene Kelly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Travolta.\n\n\t'Xanadu' was not the favorite of critics.  In fact, one critic very succinctly summed it up for the entire community: 'In a word, Xana-don't.'  Michael Beck, who had starred in the film 'The Warriors' the year before, also submitted quite a zinger regarding the movie: 'The Warriors opened a lot of doors in film for me, which Xanadu then closed.'  Honestly though, Beck's acting was pretty crummy, cheesy lines notwithstanding.\r Fortunately, the music of Olivia Newton-John and ELO have elevated this film to cult status, so critics be damned!  I'm not afraid to admit that I still enjoy tapping my feet to the theme song from the film on rare occasion.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it! \n"}]}
