Which of the following is NOT an isotope of hydrogen?", "correct": "Dilithium", "options": ["Tritium", "Protium", "Deuterium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDilithium.\n\n\tProtium is hydrogen with only a proton in its nucleus. Deuterium has a proton and neutron. Tritium has a proton and two neutrons.  Dilithium is the fictional substance on \"Star Trek\" that is an essential component of their warp drive. \n"}, {"text": "How much of the mass of the observable universe is made of hydrogen?", "correct": "75 percent", "options": ["50 percent", "90 percent", "25 percent"], "explanation": "\n\n\n75 percent.\n\n\t90 percent of atoms are hydrogen, but on a mass basis they compose 75 percent of the universe's mass.  (These figures do not reflect \"dark matter\" theory.) \n"}, {"text": "A cubic foot of hydrogen in a balloon will lift about how much weight?", "correct": "1 ounce", "options": ["1 gram", "1 pound", "1 kilogram"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1 ounce.\n\n\tThe lifting power of 1 cubic foot of hydrogen gas is about 0.07 lb at 0C, 760 mm pressure. \n"}]}
