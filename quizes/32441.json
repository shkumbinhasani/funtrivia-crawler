All living things have a constant ratio of carbon-12:carbon-14. After it dies, the carbon-14 level drops due to radioactive decay. Figuring the ratio left in an organic sample, scientists can determine how many half-life periods the sample has had, and therefore its age. \n"}, {"text": "How many carbon compounds have been catalogued?", "correct": "10,000,000", "options": ["1,000,000", "10,000", "100,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n10,000,000.\n\n"}, {"text": "What does 'carbon' mean?", "correct": "charcoal", "options": ["life", "fizzy", "black"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncharcoal.\n\n\tFrom the Latin carbo. \n"}]}
