{"id": "355166", "name": "Wrong Place, Wrong Time Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Science Fiction"], "questions": [{"text": "Here's a meld of science-fiction and fantasy: a 19th-century engineer going back to the chivalrous age of King Arthur! In Mark Twain's telling, just what kind of Yankee went back in time after a blow to the head?", "correct": "Connecticut", "options": ["Liberal", "Jumping", "Carpetbagging"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConnecticut.\n\n\tWritten in 1889, \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" ably skewers chivalry and romanticism, while getting in a few jabs at late-nineteenth-century trends as well. Hank Morgan was an engineer whose technological abilities soon propelled him to the top of King Arthur's court - after his knowledge of astronomy saved him from execution, that is. His efforts to remake medieval technology and industry were tremendously successful, but he had a much greater challenge with the social structure, and a jealous Merlin caused him all manner of problems.In addition to pioneering the idea of a technologically advanced person traveling back in time and modernizing a historical nation, \"Connecticut Yankee\" is a darned good read. \n"}, {"text": "What if you were unwillingly transported to another time and place -- again and again and again? In \"The Time Traveler's Wife\", Henry couldn't control the hours- or days-long trips he took, often to significant moments in his life or his love's. Who wrote this 2003 novel?", "correct": "Audrey Niffenegger", "options": ["Catherine Asaro", "John Scalzi", "Vernor Vinge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAudrey Niffenegger.\n\n\tHenry, the time traveler, didn't use technology for his trips. Instead, thanks to a genetic disorder, he'd find himself naked in another time and place, without any more warning than a dizzy spell. One trip, in the moment of a car crash, was life-saving; more commonly, they ran from bizarre to slightly creepy to incredibly dangerous. His titular wife, Claire, always had to stay behind, waiting and worrying. It's a tremendously evocative and moving book, probing all the comedy and tragedy of its premise. \n"}, {"text": "Scholar Martin Padway turned a corner in Rome and wound up 1400 years in the past, in the time of the Ostrogoths. His knowledge of Latin and his clever application of modern technology bought him time to formulate a new life's work: keeping the Dark Ages from descending on western Europe. What's the name of this novel by L. Sprague de Camp?", "correct": "Lest Darkness Fall", "options": ["To Bring the Light", "He Walked Around the Horses", "Timeline"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLest Darkness Fall.\n\n\tIn this 1939 novel, the definition of \"modern technology\" can be surprising. You might expect the printing presses and telegraphs, but Padway's first success came when he helped a banker speed up his accounting -- through the introduction of Arabic numerals and double-entry bookkeeping. Modern military tactics came into play, too, when he tried to fend off a destabilizing Byzantine invasion. It's a memorable book, covering a fascinating and oft-ignored historical period.\r David Drake's 1996 short story \"To Bring The Light\", in which a Roman woman from the height of empire had to recreate the legends of the Roman Republic's founding, was written as a tribute. \n"}, {"text": "People first noticed it in the sky: seeming hours of eerie, shimmering lights that faded to reveal stars slightly out of place. Scouting expeditions confirmed a shocking fact: their whole island had somehow been transported to the 1200s BC, and these modern people had to make their way in an ancient world. In the series by S.M. Stirling, what is this \"Island in the Sea of Time\"?", "correct": "Nantucket", "options": ["Oahu", "Great Britain", "Cuba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNantucket.\n\n\t\"Island in the Sea of Time\", published in 1998, began a trilogy about the stranded island and the alternate world history it created. In addition to the island off the coast of Massachusetts, quite a lot of Atlantic water went back in time, too -- including, very luckily, a Coast Guard cutter with both an engine and sails. It's fascinating to read about Nantucket's diplomatic missions to ancient civilizations, and about the re-orientation of society to face their new reality -- even as the actions of a rogue Nantucketer forced them to a war footing. \n"}, {"text": "Usually, tales of accidental time travel have the traveler educating the poor, benighted people of the past somehow. At the very least, the traveler can feel superior to them! But \"Ladies Whose Bright Eyes\" inverted that formula, with a protagonist who failed to modernize medieval times. What novelist, famous for \"The Good Soldier\", wrote this book?", "correct": "Ford Madox Ford", "options": ["Jules Verne", "Erich Maria Remarque", "Ernest Hemingway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFord Madox Ford.\n\n\tPublished in 1911 and again (with revisions) in 1935, \"Ladies Whose Bright Eyes\" let its time traveler - Sorrel - try and fail to reproduce even the most familiar twentieth-century technology. He was a mining engineer, but he didn't know where to find the ores he would need for modern mining and metallurgy; he was a publisher, but he couldn't build a moveable-type printing press from scratch. Soon, Sorrel simply settled into medieval life, finding a niche where he could be happy, and learning from the medieval people he met.\r The title of the book comes from the John Milton poem \"L'Allegro.\" The poem speaks of tournaments, and \"ladies, whose bright eyes / Rain influence, and judge the prize.\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"Pebble in the Sky\", an ordinary Chicagoan was suddenly transported - to the future! Poor Joseph Schwartz couldn't communicate with anyone at first, but he soon learned the truth. Earth was a backwater planet, plagued by radioactivity and despised by other planets in the Trantorian Empire, but some fanatic Earthlings had a plan - and Schwartz was the only one who could prevent a terrible crime. Who wrote this 1950 novel?", "correct": "Isaac Asimov", "options": ["Ben Bova", "Poul Anderson", "Spider Robinson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsaac Asimov.\n\n\tAt the time of his unplanned voyage, Schwartz was a 62-year-old retired tailor, walking by a nuclear-physics laboratory at the exact time of an unexplained accident. The next thing he knew, he was several thousand years in the future, forced to navigate an unfamiliar world and an unfamiliar culture. Worse, he was in terrible danger: Earth of the future was so poor that its inhabitants were executed on reaching the age of sixty. With unexpected allies and a tremendous stroke of luck, though, he was able to get surprisingly far.\r Mentions of the Trantorian Empire establish this book - Asimov's first novel - as part of the same universe as his more famous \"Foundation\" series, also an excellent read. \n"}, {"text": "At the beginning of Jane Yolen's young-adult novel \"The Devil's Arithmetic\" (1982), Hannah, a teenager living in a suburb of New York, didn't understand or appreciate her older relatives. Then a sudden dislocation in time and space brought history far too close for comfort. To what historical event was Hannah transported?", "correct": "The Holocaust", "options": ["The U.S. Civil War", "The Irish Potato Famine", "The Rape of Nanking"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Holocaust.\n\n\tOne moment, Hannah was opening the door for the prophet Elijah at her family's Passover Seder. The next moment, she was in a Polish shtetl in 1942 and everyone kept calling her Chaya. When the villagers were deported to a concentration camp, Hannah/Chaya knew the horrors in store for them; suddenly those boring family stories were urgently real. Could she find a way to survive? Would she ever make it home? I raced through this book to find out. \n"}, {"text": "When the town of Grantville, West Virginia (circa 2000) was suddenly transported to Germany, several things happened. First, the arrival of the town, its technology, and its strange political and cultural ideas destabilized an already chaotic Thirty Years' War. Second, their story developed and unfolded collaboratively: the original author joined up with co-authors, and fans submitted short stories and articles for the \"Grantville Gazettes.\" What was the name of the original book by Eric Flint?", "correct": "1632", "options": ["1532", "Changer of Worlds", "Time Spike"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1632.\n\n\tHistorically, the Thirty Years' War ravaged central Europe between 1618 and 1648. Literarily, the arrival of Grantville - complete with power plant - in 1631 Thuringia added a new and very important player to the mix. After the initial book was published in 2000, Flint joined up with other authors to chronicle the further adventures of his universe's strong ensemble cast.At the same time, fans of the series sent in stories and suggestions that both guided the published novels and provided new canonical material, in the form of the online publication \"Grantville Gazettes.\" By 2012, more than ten novels had been published in the series, as well as five anthologies. \n"}, {"text": "Dana was a modern woman of the 1970s, so she was never going to like being dragged back to an earlier age when \"women's rights\" were a bad joke. But her situation was even worse than that: she was repeatedly yanked back to the early 1800s to help an ancestor in the American South, and Dana was black. What 1979 novel by Octavia Butler explored the horrors of slavery?", "correct": "Kindred", "options": ["Fledgling", "Wild Seed", "The Parable of the Sower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKindred.\n\n\tOver the span of a few weeks in the 1970s, Dana was pulled back to various points in the lifetime of her ancestor Rufus, always when his life was in danger. It began when Rufus was a small, sweet child, and Dana could entertain hopes that there would be true love between him and her ancestor Alice -- even though Rufus was the white son of a plantation owner and Alice was a free black girl. Soon, though, Dana's experiences became darker and more disturbing, as she realized how slavery twisted everyone it touched. \n"}, {"text": "When Billy Pilgrim traveled in time, he didn't jump far: instead, he re-lived experiences from his own life, both in the past and in the future. Sound confusing? The alien Tralfamadorians could explain it all, at least to Billy's satisfaction. Alternatively, you could read which classic novel by Kurt Vonnegut?", "correct": "Slaughterhouse-Five", "options": ["The Sirens of Titan", "Cat's Cradle", "Breakfast of Champions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five.\n\n\tThis 1969 novel was, among other things, Vonnegut's attempt to process his own experiences during World War II, when (as a prisoner of war) he survived the fire-bombing of the German city of Dresden. Billy Pilgrim, protagonist of \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" survived the fire-bombing in the same way, and the trauma was so great that he became \"unstuck in time.\" Luckily, when the Tralfamadorians kidnapped him to display him in a zoo, they also explained their own theory of time.According to these aliens, you don't have free will over what happens in your life, but you do have the freedom to choose the moments you dwell on. Billy found this philosophy a great comfort, and through his wanderings made peace even with his own eventual murder; so it goes. \n"}]}
