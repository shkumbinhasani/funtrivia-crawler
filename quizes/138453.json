The Church wrote the historical records. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the monument erected to mark the spot where William II supposedly met his death?", "correct": "The Rufus Stone", "options": ["The Murder Stone", "The King's Stone", "The William Stone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Rufus Stone.\n\n\tThe Rufus Stone is triangular in shape and was erected in 1745 (645 years later) by Earl De La Warr.
