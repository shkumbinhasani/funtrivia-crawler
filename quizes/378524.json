{"id": "378524", "name": "Oh Holey Night Quiz | Thematic Fun | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun", "Thematic Story Time"], "questions": [{"text": "Oof...there's no excuse.  This holiday season, I told myself \"Kyle, you know what?  Hold back on the eggnog.\"  How naive I was.  I couldn't restrain myself.\n\nIs eggnog actually made with eggs?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhile the original meaning of the word 'nog' is hazy at best...kind of like how I'm feeling now...it's believe that it goes back to the word 'noggin', a mug once used in the Middle East for thick drinks.  Eggnog is a drink consisting of milk, sugar, eggs, and spices-- usually nutmeg and/or cinnamon-- and goes strikingly well with rum.  That's exactly where I met my fate.  Now, twelve hours later, I'm one step closer to Christmas and uhh...things are regrettable. \n"}, {"text": "Shortly after my first drink of eggnog, I made the mistake of the evening.  During a conversation with some friends, I ended up accidentally using the wrong emoji to get my point across.  Where was I talking to my friends?", "correct": "In a text message", "options": ["Over a landline phone", "In MSN Messenger", "At a restaurant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a text message.\n\n\tWhile this may not be as horrible a social gaffe as one would think, I figured I'd message my friends early on in the night just to let them know that I was drinking eggnog (#eggnog #xmas #justnogthingz).  Imagine my disappointment when I discovered the next morning that I sent them a cat emoji instead of a smiley face emoji!  What a disappointment.\rFor those not in the know, emojis are small images sent on cell phones alongside texts; graphical smileys, for instance, are emojis, but there are hundreds of others that've been developed over the years to accommodate for all possibilities.  Japanese in origin, emojis were added for use in cell phones in the 2010s.  In 2015, the word 'emoji' become the Oxford Dictionary's 'word of the year'. \n"}, {"text": "I was two drinks of eggnog into the night when things started getting fuzzy.  At one point, I walked out onto the patio and tripped over an Adirondack...which is likely which one of these?", "correct": "A chair", "options": ["A mountain", "A dog", "A decorative brass figure"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA chair.\n\n\tHmm...that was probably the point in the night where I should've stopped.  Opting to head outside for fresh air (though it's frigid out there this time of year...) I ended up heading out to the patio and stumbling over an Adirondack, a wooden lounge chair.  This is particularly difficult to do, mainly because the thing is bottom-heavy and made of thick wood, so while I ended up toppling over, the chair was perfectly fine. Adirondack chairs are named after the Adirondack Mountains in New York State, where they were originally created.  In Canada, one would probably refer to it as a Muskoka Chair, named after a similar area in the Canadian Shield known for cottage life and leisure. \n"}, {"text": "Three drinks of eggnog and I had to sit down.  Taking my phone out, I decided to spend money to get extra lives so that I could help Tiffi advance in what game?", "correct": "Candy Crush Saga", "options": ["Clash of Clans", "Tetris", "World of Tanks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCandy Crush Saga.\n\n\tAnother act I'd never partake in sober-- paying for in-app transactions in a mobile video game.  It seems like I'm not the only one either; close to 98% of unique players in \"Candy Crush Saga\", a game known for its match-three gameplay (like similar puzzle game \"Bejeweled\"), will not purchase the bonuses and extra lives considered by most to be unneeded. It's not to say that these add-ons aren't a help, but they don't guarantee it either.  In fact, a good percentage of money spent on the game comes from people who don't want to wait a mandatory few days (or few levels) to advance to the next stage. It doesn't stop tens of millions of people playing, nor does it stop over a billion dollars in revenue a year. \n"}, {"text": "The fourth drink of eggnog for the night is the last one I remember; I ended up prostrate, on the ground, before my memory faded out.  What was I doing if I was prostrate?", "correct": "Laying flat on the ground", "options": ["Sitting, cross-legged", "Performing a cartwheel", "Standing firmly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaying flat on the ground.\n\n\t'Prostrate' is a term used to define someone laying in a helpless position, and in my case I just needed to rest.  While I definitely wasn't prone to danger laying on the floor in my own apartment, the word was originally used to define someone as being in a submissive state.  With that in mind, it's also used when referring to someone in a bow or a kneeling position when performing religious practices.  I assure that I was not worshiping eggnog; I was merely resting my eyes. \n"}, {"text": "Looking at my credit card statements, I realized that I'd made several calls to a 900-number referred to on my statement as 'Miss Cleo'.  Which of these must I have called?", "correct": "A psychic hotline", "options": ["A dating advice hotline", "The U.S. Government", "A warrantee company"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA psychic hotline.\n\n\t'Miss Cleo', as she was known, was actually Youree Dell Harris, a woman who promoted her psychic services with a well-known 'Call me now!' catchphrase in the late-1990s.  While her authenticity was contestable, her cultural impact was widespread in North America.  Calling her probably wasn't my best decision, especially since her number was taken down in the early 2000s.  That's usually what happens when you're investigated for fraudulent business schemes. \n"}, {"text": "It was only a bit later in the morning that I discovered a package at my door (praise priority shipping).  I would never go out of my way to purchase a 'stab jacket', but the nog does weird things.  What would I use this for?", "correct": "Scuba diving", "options": ["Rock climbing", "Paragliding", "Safety during a game of darts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScuba diving.\n\n\tA stab jacket, likely better-known as a stabilizer jacket, is used to compensate for buoyancy underwater, allowing the wearer to inflate the device with air on the surface in order to float, and to release it when underwater.  While the stab jacket can vary in terms of size and orientation on the body, its function is usually the same and, like most other devices used during a dive, requires proper handling and use to avoid causing injury to the user.  Being afraid of deep water, I'll never use this purchase, but 'nog-Kyle' knows no bounds.  And no, you would never want to stab a stab jacket. \n"}, {"text": "I never noticed the mess I made in the kitchen until I actually needed to make a meal.  Turned out, I already made one...the previous night...and never cleaned up.  What could I have been making with flat pasta, mozzarella, tomato sauce, vegetables, and ground meat?", "correct": "Lasagna", "options": ["Burrito", "Ice cream sundae", "Pizza"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLasagna.\n\n\tI'm actually a fair bit amazed by my ability to cook something up in a state where I'm not able to remember.  And, you know what?  A lasagna is pretty darn complex considering the situation.  A popular Italian family dish, lasagna is made by layering flat pasta, meat ragu, cheese, and vegetables in a deep dish before cooking it in the oven.  While there is a lot of space for variability between the contents of a lasagna (for instance, subbing out the meat and replacing the cheese makes a hearty veggie lasagna), the basics are fairly consistent.  I just regret the mess. \n"}, {"text": "My neighbour ended up knocking on my door in the afternoon...after they'd woken up.  Apparently I kept them up at night singing nonsense like \"all I really wanna is a zigga-zag, ah\" on repeat last night.  I was actually, coherently, singing a song by what group?", "correct": "The Spice Girls", "options": ["The Backstreet Boys", "One Direction", "Destiny's Child"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Spice Girls.\n\n\tFortunately, those lyrics are actually directly from the brit-pop girl group's first number one single, \"Wannabe\", which rose to the tops of the charts worldwide in 1996 and kicked off a both a worldwide British invasion and a long chain of popular girl groups in the music industry, UK or otherwise.  It's not surprising i would've been singing this song; aside from simple nostalgia factor (try going to school when this song came out), the Spice Girls were known for catchy earworms, amongst which were \"Spice Up Your Life\", \"Stop\", and \"Say You'll Be There\".  They've performed on and off since their breakup in late 2000. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the worst part of the whole night was waking up to a splitting headache.  Ah yes, the dreaded hangover.  I've decided to treat my ailment with a Chinese remedy, specifically the horn of what animal?", "correct": "Rhino", "options": ["Rams", "Beetle", "Elephant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRhino.\n\n\tFrom nog to noggin, last night inevitably had to lead to the hangover.  It only makes sense to top off what must've been an adventurous night with an adventurous alternative cure to my nog-headache.  Ground rhino horn comes straight from Asia, and many cultures from China to Vietnam to Thailand use the curative for a variety of reasons (including as a hangover cure).  While its actual value is debatable, its use has come under fire in modern times because of the poaching involved.  You could also, you know, take aspirin. \n"}]}
