Rumor has it that the project has once again seen new light, this time as a magnificent construct in Hong Kong Harbour.  It could take 10 years to build.  The 800-meter high structure would be conical in shape and would contain everything from apartments to movie theaters, and would be nearly twice the height of the tallest buildings in the world. \n"}, {"text": "Biology: A dose of gibberellins in the proper place will cause which of the following?  \n", "correct": "Excited growth in young plants", "options": ["Frenetic and aimless swimming in fish", "Immobilization of insects", "Sexual excitement in mammals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExcited growth in young plants.\n\n\tGibberellins are one of five classes of plant growth hormones, and are chemically related to terpines.  They particularly work on stem growth and flowering in plants, you can thank them for your asparagus spears! \n"}, {"text": "History: The Meiji Period of Japanese history, which lasted from 1867-1912, involved one of the greatest socio-political transformations in world history.  Japanese society was fully 'modernized' within an approximately 50 year period, while presided over by the emperor and his advisors.  What is the general term used to describe these advisors/elder statesman who truly ran things from behind the scenes?  \n", "correct": "Genro", "options": ["Shijo", "Tenno", "Keiretsu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenro.\n\n\tOld oligarchs such as Ito Hirobumi and Aritomo Yamagata pulled the strings behind the scenes, leaving the Meiji Emperor as a symbolic figurehead for the Japanese people.  The success of the Meiji period reforms allowed Japan to become a 'first world' nation within several decades, but alas the militarists grabbed control of the national polity and drove Japan towards its disastrous World War II defeat. \n"}, {"text": "Words: Which of these weather-related words is of American origin (that is, American English) and did not come into common use until the late 19th century?  \n", "correct": "Blizzard", "options": ["Monsoon", "Tornado", "Typhoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlizzard.\n\n\tThe word 'monsoon' was originally derived from Arabic and means 'season', while 'tornado' is from the Spanish for 'thunderstorm'.  The word Typhoon has two, alternate origins...one Greek (meaning 'violent storm') and one Chinese (meaning 'big wind).  The specific origin of the word 'blizzard' is unknown, but it is known that the word came into general use around 1870 in the United States...and hence is considered a native of American English. Some suggest that the word is onomatopoeic...the sound of a violent snow storm buzzing across ones ears, while others think it could possibly have come from the German word 'blizz' (fast), the same root used for the word 'blitzkrieg'. \n"}, {"text": "Entomology: Which fascinating insect behavior was first investigated by Austrian Nobel Laureate Karl von Frisch?  \n", "correct": "The frenetic dance of Honeybees", "options": ["The mating ritual of praying mantises", "The 'hissing' of the Madagascar cockroaches", "The hunting techniques of the antlion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe frenetic dance of Honeybees.\n\n\tKarl von Frisch was a Nobel Laureate in Medicine (1973) who specialized in the study of human and animal behavior.  One of his most fascinating studies was that of honeybees.  Worker bees who have successfully located a substantial food source will 'dance' as a way of communicating to their cohabitants in order to give them directions and distance...a spectacular form of insect communication! \n"}, {"text": "Geography: What is the largest country in the world, by area, whose name begins with the letter 'T'?  \n", "correct": "Tanzania", "options": ["Thailand", "Turkey", "Turkmenistan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTanzania.\n\n\tYes, I was surprised by this too!

Regardless, what was the name of this daring, yet apocryphal female pontiff? \n", "correct": "Pope Joan", "options": ["Pope Margaret", "Pope Honoria", "Pope Catherine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPope Joan.\n\n\tPope Joan was said to have sat upon the papal throne for a little over two years, disguised as an Englishman named John Anglicus (John VIII) around the time that Benedict III held the position (855-858).  Her true identity was betrayed one day when she gave birth to a child and she was subsequently stoned to death.  Though the controversy as to whether Joan truly existed continues on, most experts believe it to be false...and substantial evidence has been presented backing this case. \n"}, {"text": "Writers: Which of these famous authors is said to have drunk 50 cups per day of coffee, enough so that caffeine poisoning partially led to his death?  \n", "correct": "Balzac", "options": ["Dostoyevsky", "Faulkner", "Ibsen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalzac.\n\n\tFrench novelist Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, who wrote 'La Com\u00e9die Humaine', among other works, apparently couldn't get enough coffee...he drank it night and day.

He seemingly didn't subscribe to the ancient Greek maxim, 'nothing in excess'. \n"}, {"text": "Monuments: The appearance of one of these famous monuments in the United States can sensibly be described using the word 'patina', but which?  \n", "correct": "Statue of Liberty", "options": ["Mt. Rushmore", "St. Louis Arch", "Washington Monument"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStatue of Liberty.\n\n\tAnything constructed of copper and left to the elements will eventually develop a green incrustation, caused by oxidation.  For the most part, in sculpture, a patina is seen as something attractive...and the Statue of Liberty's green appearance is no exception.  While the Statue of Liberty is made of copper, the St. Louis Arch was constructed of stainless steel, hence it will never incur patination.  Mt. Rushmore and the Washington Monument are both constructed of stone, and hence will certainly not develop patinas. \n"}, {"text": "Language: The word 'barbarian' comes from the ancient Attic Greek, describing the 'bar-bar' noises that non-Greek speaking peoples would make when they verbally communicated, true or false?  \n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSome ancient Greeks of Athens, being the arrogant chaps that they were, considered all other languages to be nonsensical gibberish, a series of 'bars', so to speak.  Thus the term 'barbarian' was bestowed upon the non-Attic Greek speaking peoples to generally identify them...and yes, the word had the same negative connotation it has today.
