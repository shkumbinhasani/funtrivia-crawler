{"id": "336815", "name": "The Music of \"Glee\" 9 Multiple Choice Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Glee"], "questions": [{"text": "Mercedes performed \"River Deep - Mountain High\" in \"Duets\" along with which other Glee Club member?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Rachel", "Quinn", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\tIn an attempt to win a dinner for two at one of Lima, Ohio's best restaurants, Breadstix, Santana and Mercedes put their differences aside to sing a rendition of Ike and Tina Turner's \"River Deep - Mountain High\" for their duet assignment.  They were the first pair to perform during the episode and they ended up starting the week's performances off with a bang.\rThe original version of the song was released in 1966 though it only reached number eighty-eight on the Billboard Pop Chart.  The \"Glee\" version, which appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 4\", peaked at number forty-one on the Billboard Hot 100 making it more successful on the charts than the original rendition.  Nonetheless, it's often cited by many music media outlets as a classic Turner single. \n"}, {"text": "\"Sing!\" (from \"Duets\") was the first song on \"Glee\" to feature the vocals of which member of New Directions?", "correct": "Mike", "options": ["Sam", "Tina", "Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike.\n\n\tOriginally from \"A Chorus Line\", \"Sing!\" was originally the fifth number found in the stageplay which debuted in 1975.  One of the longest-running Broadway shows ever created, it won nine Tony Awards.\rIn \"Duets\", Mike and Tina perform their duet to this song in order to try and win the Breadstix dinner for themselves.  To make a true duet, the song required that both Tina and Mike sing, so he took the reins and sang while dancing for this one.  \"Sing!\" reached number eighty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100 though it did not appear on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 4\".  This was the first vocal performance by Mike on the entire show. \n"}, {"text": "Sam and Quinn performed \"Lucky\" for their duet choice in \"Duets\".  Did they win the duets competition?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tFor much of the episode, Sam tries to express his feelings for Quinn and she spends her time trying to maintain her independence.  When the two of them end up winning the Duets competition (in a semi-rigged vote) they also win the dinner at Breadstix and inevitably go on their first date.\rThe original rendition of \"Lucky\" by Jason Mraz and Colbie Caillat appeared on four different Billboard charts in 2009 and peaked at number forty-eight on the Hot 100.  The \"Glee\" version actually did better hitting number twenty-seven on the same chart and becoming the highest-charting song of the \"Duets\" episode.  It appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 4\".  The original single also won the Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of \"Duets\", Rachel and Kurt performed a mash-up duet consisting of Judy Garland's \"Get Happy\" and which Barbra Streisand song?", "correct": "Happy Days Are Here Again", "options": ["The Way We Were", "You Don't Bring Me Flowers", "Evergreen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHappy Days Are Here Again.\n\n\tAlthough originally made in 1929, Barbra's version of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" was recorded in 1962 and later released on \"The Barbra Streisand Album\", her debut CD.  Garland's \"Get Happy\", meanwhile, was originally recorded in 1930 before she recorded it in 1950 for a film soundtrack.  Both of them created the duet together a decade later.  The \"Glee\" version didn't show on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 4\" but it did appear on the Billboard Hot 100 at number forty-eight.\rAfter realizing Kurt's loneliness in the choir room, Rachel offers to sing a duet with him to make him realize that there are people that care about him.  To end the episode, they both share the spotlight with these songs from some of their favourite artists. \n"}, {"text": "\"Hot Patootie\" was the first song on the show to be performed by which character in \"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\"?", "correct": "Carl", "options": ["Beiste", "Principal Figgins", "Karofsky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarl.\n\n\tIn order to get Carl involved in the Frank-N-Furter role (left vacant by Mike Chang), Sue has him audition.  Instead of picking a Frank song, he performs Eddie's \"Hot Patootie\" and dances with the kids in the choir room.  Will isn't thrilled with this, but Mercedes ends up claiming the Frank role, so Carl can still be Eddie.\r\"Hot Patootie\" never charted on the Billboard charts but it did appear on the special CD released to commemorate this episode, \"Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show\".  This song marked the first major performance by Carl on the show.  It was originally performed by Meat Loaf Aday (who appeared in the episode as well). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these New Directions members did not appear in the end of \"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\" (in \"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\")?", "correct": "Rachel (as Janet)", "options": ["Finn (as Brad)", "Kurt (as Riff-Raff)", "Brittany (as Columbia)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel (as Janet).\n\n\t\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\" never charted on the U.S. Billboard charts though it did appear as one of the singles on \"Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show\".  It was Emma's first song of the show's second season.\r\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\" featured both Will and Emma in one of the school classrooms.  When Will orchestrates a ploy to take over the role of Rocky (suggesting that Sam step back from it) so that he can be close to Emma, he asks her to sing the libretto from the song for practice.  They really get into the song while Brittany and Santana watch from the window unnoticed.  By the end of the song, Emma realizes what she's doing and runs away. \n"}, {"text": "All regular members of New Directions appeared in \"Time Warp\" at the end of \"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\".", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhile many of the members of New Directions performed the \"Time Warp\", the \"Rocky Horror Picture Show's\" most famous song, during the finale of the episode in the school's auditorium, Puck had been taken to juvie in the previous episode, \"Duets\", and would not return to the school until the following episode, \"Never Been Kissed\".  As a result, New Directions was one man down for two episodes.\r\"Time Warp\" was the only song from the episode and the \"Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show\" album to chart in the United States.  It reached number eighty-nine on the Billboard charts. \n"}, {"text": "Puck and Artie performed Bob Marley's \"One Love/People Get Ready\" at which location in \"Never Been Kissed\"?", "correct": "The school's steps", "options": ["Breadstix", "The auditorium", "The choir room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe school's steps.\n\n\t\"One Love/People Get Ready\" was originally performed by Bob Marley and the Wailers in 1977 on the \"Exodus\" album.  The \"Glee\" version of the song reached number forty-one on the Billboard Hot 100.  It also showed on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 4\".\rPuck returned in this sixth episode after a two episode absence.  Coming back from a stay in juvy, Puck vowed to do community service in order to remain at McKinley.  His idea: Help Artie because he's handicapped.  By help, Puck means that he'll give Artie any trade secrets he can to get back together with Brittany.  To earn some cash, they perform Bob Marley's mash-up, \"One Love/People Get Ready\" and earn $300 on the school's steps to take the girls to Breadstix. \n"}, {"text": "\"Teenage Dream\" (in \"Never Been Kissed\") is the first song in the show to be performed by what character?", "correct": "Blaine & Blaine Anderson", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlaine & Blaine Anderson.\n\n\tKurt meets Blaine at Dalton Academy in the \"Never Been Kissed\" episode and learns of the cool a cappella stylings of the Dalton Academy Warblers.  Blaine sings Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream\" with the other Warblers as part of an impromptu performance in the school.  It marks the start of his and Kurt's friendship.\r\"Teenage Dream\" was, surprisingly, the most well-received song since the very first episode's \"Don't Stop Believing\".  Amazingly, the song hit number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 (\"Don't Stop Believing\" was number four the previous year).  \"Glee\" wouldn't have a more popular hit until their original songs later in the season.  \"Teenage Dream\" appeared in \"Glee: The Music, Volume 4\".  Katy Perry's original version hit number one on four different Billboard charts (including the Hot 100) and appeared on her album of the same name. \n"}, {"text": "Who performed the mash-up of \"Start Me Up\" and \"Livin' on a Prayer\" in \"Never Been Kissed\"?", "correct": "The girls of New Directions", "options": ["Will and Emma", "The guys of New Directions", "Finn and Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe girls of New Directions.\n\n\tThe \"Start Me Up\"/\"Livin' on a Prayer\" mash-up reached number thirty-one on the Billboard Hot 100.  The original version of the former song peaked at number two on the same chart in 1981 and the Bon Jovi rendition of \"Livin' on a Prayer\" reached number one in 1986.\rIn the second of three mash-ups in the \"Never Been Kissed\" episode, the girls sang \"Start Me Up\" by The Rolling Stones and \"Livin' On a Prayer\" by Bon Jovi (though the guys would later sing The Supremes' \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" and En Vogue's \"Free Your Mind\" for Coach Beiste).  These were made as part of the week's lesson plan, to make mash-ups in gendered groups which involved songs from the opposite gender's bands.\rThe guys' mash-up reached number thirty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100 implying that, outside the show, the girls won in some capacity.  Neither song appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Volume 4\".  By this standard, the guys won the previous year's mash-up reaching number thirty on the charts (versus the girls' number forty). \n"}]}
