{"id": "187905", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'Fade In, Fade Out' (Part II) Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "The second half of 'Fade In, Fade Out' begins in the Swamp, where Hawkeye and BJ unhappily pack Frank's belongings so they can be shipped to the Ferret Face in Tokyo.  While this process is in full bloom, Margaret enters the tent looking for an item of hers that has been in Frank's possession.  What might this be?", "correct": "A photograph", "options": ["A book", "A locket", "A pair of earrings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA photograph.\n\n\tFrank has managed somehow to keep a photo of Margaret in his possession, even after Margaret has been married.  Apparently, she no longer wants him to have this memento and claims the photo for herself.  \r Prior to Margaret entering the Swamp, Hawkeye and BJ are dividing up Frank's clothing.  Anything that has holes goes in Frank's foot locker, anything that is new remains with them...even underwear! \n"}, {"text": "Speaking of Margaret, she has arrived back early from her honeymoon.  In the operating room, Margaret clearly appears to be upset, but she refuses to discuss her problems with anybody.  Now, in the Swamp, she opens up to Hawkeye and BJ.  Margaret explains that, for the first two days, things went wonderfully on her honeymoon.  Following that, Donald no longer showed any interest.  Donald's strange behavior began after attending a party, with Margaret, thrown by a general with what surname?", "correct": "Weiskopf", "options": ["Krummer", "Francis", "Bukowski"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWeiskopf.\n\n\tThis is a very interesting stage in the evolution of 'M*A*S*H'.  From this point forward, Hawkeye and BJ become confidants of Margaret's.  The former antagonism between the characters has diminished.  Hence, Margaret is now able to reveal even the most intimate details of her life, including her problems with Donald. Donald seemed unable to perform his husbandly duties following a party at General Lyle Weiskopf's.  Hawkeye and BJ suggest that Donald is simply suffering from performance anxiety; it's hard to live up to your significant other's past, the doctors add.  'The male libido can be a very fragile thing', Hawkeye suggests. \n"}, {"text": "After Hawkeye and BJ soothe Margaret somewhat, she returns to give Frank's possessions another once-over.  In doing so, Margaret discovers another of her possessions, this time one that she claims Frank has essentially stolen.  What sort of item is this?", "correct": "Alarm clock", "options": ["Negligee", "Fountain pen", "Picture frame"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlarm clock.\n\n\tResponding to a pointed criticism from BJ, Margaret says, while rummaging through Frank's foot locker, 'Oh, I know, I know...Frank Burns was a little too 'by the book' for you guys, but I personally have some very fond memories of our friendship.'  After discovering her alarm clock, she angrily continues, 'That dirty rat!  My alarm clock!  He said the bellboy took it!  That fink!'  BJ responds, 'Margaret, remember the fond memories.'  Margaret retorts, as she pours gin all over Frank's stuff, 'Oh, I'll give him a fond memory.  Bottom's up, Frank.' \n"}, {"text": "In the O.R., the doctor that Hawkeye operated on earlier has recovered nicely from follow up surgery, performed by Charles.  Addressing Charles, the doctor says, 'Dr. Pierce tells me that your technique was extraordinary.'  How does Charles resond?", "correct": "To him, perhaps.", "options": ["Of course.  I'm a Winchester!", "What'd you expect?  I'm chief thoracic surgeon at Massachusetts General.", "Anything might seem extraordinary to a country doctor."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo him, perhaps.\n\n\tEarlier, Doctor Berman smilingly states, 'I thought I was a goner.'  Charles first insult, directed at Pierce, is the response: 'Yes, I can understand that.'  Hawkeye had made the egregious mistake of calling Charles 'Chuck' earlier in the conversation (and Charlie at other times). \n"}, {"text": "Charles happily leaves the O.R., once again having shown Hawkeye up.  Entering the officer's club, he takes a last drink before leaving the 4077th 'cesspool'.  However, just before he is able to depart, Colonel Potter arrives.  Potter delivers Charles some bad news, he has been assigned to the 4077th permanently.  Charles angrily asks what the consequences are if he refuses to serve there, to which Potter answers...?", "correct": "You'll be making gravel at Leavenworth!", "options": ["You might find your next quarters a little more confining!", "You have two choices, this cesspool or the stockade!", "You'll find yourself performing surgery on your fellow inmates!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou'll be making gravel at Leavenworth!.\n\n\tPotter follows this comment up with a stern '\u00bfComprende?'  Charles meekly responds, 'Comprendo!'  'Good!' Potter responds, and continues, 'Well Major Winchester, I can't tell you how happy I am you've decided to join us.  And remember, if you ever have a problem, feel free to stop in.  My tent flap is always open.'  The Colonel will regret making this final offer! \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the entire episode, Klinger has been consorting with a 'lawyer' named Schaeffer who insists that our hirsute friend is a legitimate Section 8.  We later learn that this lawyer is indeed not a lawyer, nor even a captain, as he claims.  Rather, he is a private who has also been bucking for a Section 8.  This is not his first masquerade, he has also disguised himself in a number of other ways, including which of the following?", "correct": "Chaplain", "options": ["Korean merchant", "General", "Air Force pilot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChaplain.\n\n\tAccording to Potter, Schaeffer has been 'busted twice' and has 'done four months in the slammer'.  He has impersonated a doctor, a bombadier, a tank commander and a chaplain.  To this, Schaeffer adds: 'At this very moment somewhere in America, 25 couples are living in sin.'  Compared to Klinger, this guy is obviously a 'real pro', says Colonel Potter. \n"}, {"text": "BJ and Hawkeye receive a final call from Frank Burns late in the episode.  Following the call, Hawkeye tosses the telephone out the door of the tent in anger.  Which of these is *not* part of Frank's rather irksome 'good news'?", "correct": "He has been given a medal of bravery", "options": ["He has been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel", "He has been assigned to a veteran's hospital in Indiana", "He has been cleared of all charges"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has been given a medal of bravery.\n\n\t'The army, in its infinite wisdom, has not only cleared Frank of the charges, they have assigned him to a veteran's hospital in Indiana and promoted him to lieutenant colonel', the annoyed Hawkeye says.  BJ's reaction is to grab the telephone in attempt to smash it himself, but this time Radar is prepared, he won't let go of his beloved communications device. \n"}, {"text": "Winchester is the next person who attempts to accost Radar's telephone.  He demands that Radar make a call to Tokyo.  After some threatening language, Radar begins to make the call, but not before Colonel Potter enters the office.  Potter insists that Charles is 'not going anywhere'.  Winchester responds by announcing that his father knows which of these famous individuals?", "correct": "Harry Truman", "options": ["Douglas MacArthur", "Dwight Eisenhower", "George Marshall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Truman.\n\n\tAccording to Charles, his father 'doesn't like [Harry Truman], but he knows him.'  Potter responds, 'Fine.  You have dad call Harry, then Harry'll call me, and maybe we'll work something out.  In the meantime, vamoose.'  Charles responds, 'Alright Colonel, I am...vamoosing.' \n"}, {"text": "Before Charles exits Radar's office at Colonel Potter's command, he gives one of his all-time best dialogue.  In Charles brief speech, he suggests three things that the Colonel *can* do in the demoralizing sense.  Which of these is not one of them?", "correct": "Confine him to using medieval surgical techniques", "options": ["Cut him off from the civilized world", "Incarcerate him with two moronic cell mates", "Torture him with thrice-daily swill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConfine him to using medieval surgical techniques.\n\n\tThe entire speech reads: 'But, know this.  You can cut me off from the civilized world.  You can incarcerate me with two moronic cell mates.  You can torture me with your thrice-daily swill.  But you cannot break the spirit of a Winchester.  My voice will be heard from this wilderness and I shall be deliverd from this fetid and festering sewer.'  \r Colonel Potter responds, 'I think he's getting the hang of this place.' \n"}, {"text": "After a very difficult session in the O.R., during which Charles learns that 'meatball' surgery is an entirely new ball game, the newest member of the outfit appears demoralized.  After a brief pep talk, Charles departs for the Swamp, opting to be alone.  Potter asks BJ and Hawkeye to give Charles a break for a short time, and not to play any practical jokes on the poor fellow until he gets 'broken in'.  Unfortunately, the Colonel is too late.  What surprise have they prepared for Charles in the Swamp?", "correct": "A snake in Charles' bed", "options": ["A bucket of water over the door of the Swamp", "Shaving cream in Charles' toothpaste", "Scrambled eggs in Charles' boots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA snake in Charles' bed.\n\n\tCharles has a very difficult time performing in the O.R.  Charles' insists that he 'does one thing at a time, does it very well, and then [he] moves on'.  Unfortunately, this is not the way it works when speed is of the essence.  BJ is forced to take over for Charles as he lags behind.  Following surgery, the other doctors attempt to pep Charles up, and it seems to have some positive effect.  Later, Hawkeye and BJ return to a Swamp filled with the music of Mozart.  Hawkeye hops on his bed, only to find to his surprise that Charles has moved the snake under his blanket.  When Hawkeye cries out, Charles turns toward Hawkeye and ever so gently appeals for silence: 'Please. Mozart.'\r Thank you for playing.  I hope you enjoyed this quiz and will be encouraged to try some of my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
