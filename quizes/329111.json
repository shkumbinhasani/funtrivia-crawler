Average [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Oh no...what is he doing?\"  An innocent bystander looks on as Kyle starts shattering works of art.  \"He'll never find chocolate in those.\"\n\nWhat Russian art creations, of which there are slightly more than fifty in the world, could Kyle be destroying?", "correct": "Faberge Eggs", "options": ["Van Gogh Paintings", "Unicorn Tapestries", "Busts of Venus de Milo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaberge Eggs.\n\n\tCreated between 1885 and 1917, the Faberge Eggs  are works of art once made by a series of jewelers in Russia.  Prestigious and luxurious, these creations are expensive, and Kyle really shouldn't be destroying them- it's hard to tell if the contents of the chocolate vault will even cover the costs...\rWhile many of the original Fabrege creations are located in museums there are a number in private collections.  They cost millions to purchase (in auction) and were created under the supervision of Tsar Alexander III in the late 19th century-early 20th century.  Many of the eggs have distinct Russian themes (ie. the Trans-Siberian Railway, the Moscow Kremlin, and the Alexander Palace egg).\rIn his lifetime, Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh created thousands of works of art (mostly paintings) and some are housed in Russia's Hermitage Museum.  There are only seven Unicorn Tapestries, and there is only one true Venus de Milo statue (in the Louvre in Paris).  Perhaps the bust would 'shatter', but the paintings and tapestries would not...\rLet's just hope Kyle doesn't get the idea to visit these places in his search. \n"}, {"text": "\"CHOCOLATE!\" Kyle exclaims as he barrels into factory in England.\n\"No! Please don't destroy those!\" A worker shouts to get Kyle's attention but alas, it's no use.  Kyle has used a club to smash a Rolls-Royce coming fresh off the conveyor belt.\n\nWhat German company (which owns the Rolls Royce name) will probably be asking Kyle to pay for the damages?", "correct": "BMW", "options": ["Lotus", "Nissan", "Aston Martin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBMW.\n\n\tKyle smashed an expensive car this time...where did he get a club?\rBMW, a German car company founded in 1916, acquired the Rolls Royce name in the 1990s before holding it in a joint-venture with Volkswagen.  Eventually, Rolls Royce would become a complete subsidiary of the BMW name.  As authentically British as the Mini Cooper (also owned by BMW, coincidentally), the Rolls Royce factory can be found in West Sussex.  BMW's actual headquarters can be found in Munich.  Kyle is probably going to need to pay a fair bit...these are luxury cars and very few are created every year.\rLotus is a British-made car company founded in the 1950s; its factory can be found in Norfolk.  Aston Martin, the oldest selection, calls Warwickshire its home.  They've been making luxury cars since 1912.  Nissan is a Japanese car company which, at one time, was known as Datsun before it was phased out. \n"}, {"text": "With a baseball bat behind his back, Kyle sneaks up on a lead in China.  According to his sources, the chocolate vault is actually concealed within a terracotta statue.  As he smashes into the first of hundreds of possibilities, he's dragged away by security.\n\nWhat city, home to a world famous UNESCO site based on its statues, is Kyle likely appalling?", "correct": "Xi'an", "options": ["Shanghai", "Beijing", "Hong Kong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nXi'an.\n\n\tIt's extremely lucky that Kyle got away with that one without paying a fine.  He has been extradited out of China though...\rKyle destroyed one of thousands of terracotta soldiers created during the Qin Dynasty to protect the First Emperor of Qin after his death and in the afterlife.  Luckily, they couldn't fight back.  Amongst the thousands of soldiers (each one unique in their own ways) are different ranks of the army, horses, and chariots.  Many still haven't been unearthed from the Xi'an region though hundreds are on display in warehouses near the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor.\rThese statues aren't expensive- they're priceless.  UNESCO has backed this location since 1987. \n"}, {"text": "Set on the idea that the vault is behind some painting, Kyle heads to the Art Institute of Chicago.  Spying a George Seurat painting, he tears it off its wall and throws it to the ground before a guard tackles him to the floor.  No vault.\n\nWhich of these expensive paintings is by this particular Pointillist artist?", "correct": "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte - 1884", "options": ["American Gothic", "The Persistence of Memory", "L'Absinthe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte - 1884.\n\n\tGet Kyle out of these museums!  I mean come on!  He should be on some blacklist by now.\rThe Art Institute of Chicago is one of the U.S.' largest art museums and it houses some pretty memorable works particularly from the Impressionist period onwards.  \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte - 1884\", Seurat's painting of people on a beach, is an example of Pointillism, a technique in which dots of paint are used to create the image on the canvas.  This museum also contains \"American Gothic\" by Grant Wood, \"The Basket of Apples\" by Paul Cezanne, and Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks\" as well as works by Van Gogh and Monet.\r\"The Persistence of Memory\" is a surrealist painting (you know...the melting clocks?) by Salvador Dali found in New York's Museum of Modern Art and \"L'Absinthe\" is a work by French Impressionist painter Edgar Degas (found in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris). \n"}, {"text": "Before Kyle can reach the doorway of this household with a sledgehammer, a passer-by recognizes him and calls the police.  Although it's clear he assumed that the vault was on the other side of this London address' front door, he claims that he just wanted to use the services of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous literary sleuth.  That wouldn't explain the sledgehammer...\n\nWhat address did Kyle almost raid in his hunt for chocolate?", "correct": "221B Baker Street", "options": ["29 Fleet Street", "10 Downing Street", "3 Abbey Road"], "explanation": "\n\n\n221B Baker Street.\n\n\t221B Baker Street is the residence of the fictional Sherlock Holmes, master detective.  Since the release of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories about the famous character, the location has been the site of the Holmes Museum dedicated to the literary figure.  There is no actual building at 221 on said street, but the museum states otherwise.  I'm not sure what Kyle was thinking with this one, but had he succeeded I'm sure he would've destroyed a lot of memorabilia and replicas from the days of Holmes specials and the book series.\r10 Downing Street is the residence of the British Prime Minister while Fleet Street is the neighbourhood of the fictional Sweeney Todd.  In real life, Fleet Street once house many of London's news outlets (including Reuters).  3 Abbey Road is home to the famous music recording studio of the same name where The Beatles, Radiohead, and Oasis created a number of albums.  This is also the location at which the \"Star Wars\" soundtrack was created (amongst several other major movie soundtracks). \n"}, {"text": "Heading back to Europe, Kyle thinks that he knows exactly where to find the vault.  When he arrives at his destination, he steps over the velvet rope, much to the shock of tourists and religious visitors, and rips the Shroud of Turin off its wall.  The vault was not behind it.\n\nTo what country did Kyle just travel?", "correct": "Italy", "options": ["Jordan", "Belgium", "Monaco"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItaly.\n\n\tBefore Kyle could be apprehended, he folded up the shroud, placed it on a stool, and departed quietly.  He never returned to Italy.  Frankly, I don't think he would be welcome.\rThe Shroud of Turin is kept in its chapel in the city of Turin (which hosted the 2006 Winter Olympics).  Notorious for its religious significance, the Shroud of Turin is said to contain the image of Jesus Christ on its front.  Although testing has been performed on the relic on numerous occasions, scientific developments have never been able to explain the imprint on the front of the piece.  The Shroud was alluded to in the Bible and it has been claimed that it had been in circulation for over a thousand years.\rKyle nearly destroyed a religious artifact...what next? \n"}, {"text": "Back to London, Kyle heads to the Beatles Museum in Liverpool.  A Beatles fan weeps into her hands as Kyle uses a pickaxe to tear into the piano on which John Lennon composed \"Imagine\".  Net value: \u00a31,450,000.  Apparently, he thought the vault was hidden inside.\n\nWhen the piano went up for auction in 2000, what famous musician purchased it?", "correct": "George Michael", "options": ["David Bowie", "Michael Jackson", "Yoko Ono"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Michael.\n\n\t\"Imagine\", released of the album of the same name in 1971, became an anthem symbolizing world peace after its debut.  Originally composed on Lennon's Steinway Model Z, the song became Lennon's most famous solo piece and has been covered by multiple artists.  The piano was purchased in a Hard Rock Cafe auction in 2000 to musician George Michael (of Wham!) and sent to the Beatles Museum in the UK for display.  Along with the Steinway, the museum is also home to Lennon's signature round glasses.\rLike with China before, Kyle is now banned from the UK for destroying museum property.  Imagine if there was a vault there... \n"}, {"text": "By now, Kyle is a household name having destroyed priceless artwork and expensive items worldwide.  Having received the notion that the chocolate vault is not an actual vault at all, but a person, he is intrigued.  This is why he's backstage at a concert waiting to pounce the minute the singer begins her rendition of \"Poker Face\".\n\nIn attempting to reach the musician to ask her some questions, Kyle destroys hundreds of thousands of dollars of stage equipment and eccentric clothing, but who is the artist?", "correct": "Lady Gaga", "options": ["Beyonce", "Jennifer Lopez", "Keith Richards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLady Gaga.\n\n\tHow did he even get into this one?  In his quest for chocolate, Kyle ended up backstage at a Lady Gaga concert and jumped onstage shortly after she finished her choreographed routine for \"Just Dance\".  Unwittingly, he bent a giant gyroscope and stepped on a dress made entirely of plastic bubbles in his attempt to reach the singer onstage.  Luckily, Gaga's security was able to bring Kyle to the ground before his outlandish idea could work.\r\"Poker Face\", released on Lady Gaga's first album, \"The Fame\", was her second single and it reached number one on several 'Billboard' charts topping her debut, \"Just Dance\".  The gyroscope Kyle destroyed was seen in her \"Bad Romance\" music video while the bubble dress was worn on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine.  Elaborate, crazy, and eccentric, Lady Gaga's outfits tend to be both expensive and over-the-top...it's easy for Kyle to owe a lot in ruining them.\rSpending a few nights in jail, Kyle realizes that he needs to stop watching \"The Fifth Element\" for ideas and that the stakes are higher...if he finds the chocolate vault and gets in, he's never leaving. \n"}, {"text": "Kyle heads to Canada and investigates a spot where he assumes the vault might be buried: under 'The Last Spike'.  What a good place for a vault- after all, they buried a railroad spike into it to prevent anyone from opening it!  With a jackhammer in tow, Kyle bends the track, derailing a cross-country train and damaging Canada's history forever.\n\nIn which province did he destroy the Canadian Pacific Railway?", "correct": "British Columbia", "options": ["Alberta", "Saskatchewan", "Manitoba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBritish Columbia.\n\n\tChronicled in \"The Last Spike\" by Pierre Burton (a classic Canadian author), this event marked the coming together of Western and Eastern Canada in November 1885.  After several years, hundreds of deaths (mostly of immigrant workers on the tracks), and horrible turns of fate, the Last Spike was driven into the track which crossed from the Pacific Coast, through the Rockies, across the prairies, and to Ontario (and beyond).  Similarly, the United States drove the last spike of their Central and Union Pacific Railway in Promontory Point, Utah with a spike of solid gold in 1865.  Canada's last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.\rKyle's in for it now.  There's no turning back.  The vault's not in British Columbia.  He runs into the woods. \n"}, {"text": "Exiled to the wilderness, Kyle is now forced to wander the lands alone.  This doesn't stop his mind from setting its sight on the ultimate goal.  This is when he sees it: an oil pipeline.  Don't ask how, but he ruptured the Alaskan pipeline.  No vault was found.\n\nIf Kyle ruptured the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, oil would stop flowing to what Alaskan city?", "correct": "Valdez", "options": ["Anchorage", "Juneau", "Nome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nValdez.\n\n\tOne of the most expensive American ventures ever created, the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System cost eight billion dollars in the year it was constructed (1977).  Pumping crude oil 800 miles across the northernmost U.S. state, the pipeline crosses from Prudhoe Bay to the city of Valdez (passing through Fairbanks) transporting hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil per day.  Rupturing this pipeline would cause millions of dollars of environmental damage in a very short amount of time.  It's happened before too!  The pipeline is associated with BP, Exxon Mobil (though not the Exxon Valdez spill), and Chevron amongst other oil companies and has been responsible for some of the world's largest on-land spills.\rKyle's done it this time.  No vault... \n"}]}
