{"id": "319354", "name": "3.13 \"Waiting in the Wings\" Online Quiz | 'Angel' Episodes/Seasons | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Angel", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Our story begins with an excited Angel striding into the hotel. He's just purchased five tickets for a performance, and he can't wait to attend with his friends. What kind of show are they going to see?", "correct": "A ballet", "options": ["A symphony", "An opera", "A Shakespeare play"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA ballet.\n\n\tThe ballet is \"Giselle,\" a tragic love story that is the dance company's signature piece. In fact, it's a long-standing tradition for the company; Angel remembers having seen their production of it over a hundred years previously, when he was evil.\r The rest of the crew doesn't quite share Angel's enthusiasm. Gunn is particularly upset, which is understandable, since the outing was apparently his idea (he'd wanted to see a favorite band). He stands in shock after Angel returns with ballet tickets. \"It's like a nightmare,\" he says. \n"}, {"text": "In preparation for their high-culture outing, our heroes seek out evening wear. The gentlemen get their rental tuxes together, while Cordelia shows Fred the rather sketchy trick of exploiting department-store return policies for an effective dress rental. But there's anxiety in the air, too: two of the men are in love with a girl named Fred. Which two?", "correct": "Wesley and Gunn", "options": ["Angel and Wesley", "Lorne and Connor", "Gavin and a Senior Partner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWesley and Gunn.\n\n\tWesley and Gunn are each hoping to impress Fred with their tuxedoed good looks and sophisticated taste; they are both also temporarily struck speechless by the sight of Fred in her evening gown. Fred seems oblivious to their flustered states. Meanwhile, Angel seems to be thinking of Cordelia as more than just a friend. It should be an interesting night! \n"}, {"text": "Sadly, not everyone gets to go to the performance. One person -- who, come to think of it, probably knows more about music than the others combined -- has to stay at the hotel to take care of the baby. Who is it?", "correct": "Lorne", "options": ["Wesley", "Gavin", "Doyle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLorne.\n\n\tLorne is not happy that he wasn't invited to the ballet; he even sings baby Connor a little song about it. He tries to be a good sport, though -- even as the evening grows dark, and even as he begins to hear strange noises ... \n"}, {"text": "At the theater downtown, the lucky attendees are enjoying the show. Well, most of them, anyway. Gunn and Angel are utterly transported, but what is Cordelia doing?", "correct": "Sleeping", "options": ["Texting", "Whispering to Fred", "Knitting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSleeping.\n\n\tThe last few weeks have been hard on Cordelia -- she's become a demon, for one thing -- and she deserves her rest. She isn't the only one dreaming, however. Wesley is transfixed by the beauty of the dancing, and by the beauty of Fred beside him. In a scene that ultimately had to be cut (but which I strongly recommend watching on the DVD), he imagines Fred dancing the role of Giselle, with himself prancing awkwardly about the stage around her. \r Amy Acker, the actress who plays Fred, danced ballet for many years. According to his commentary track, director/writer/producer Joss Whedon devised this episode partly to show off her dancing skills, as well as to show off Alexis Denisof (Wesley)'s talent for physical comedy. It's a shame the sequence had to be cut. \n"}, {"text": "Intermission rolls around, and the group discusses the show. Gunn is having a fantastic time, despite his initial misgivings, but Angel -- whose idea this was -- seems disturbed. He's noticed something odd about the show. What is it?", "correct": "The performers are the same ones he saw a hundred years ago.", "options": ["Some of the performers are actually flying.", "All the performers are the same person.", "The ushers are all vampires."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe performers are the same ones he saw a hundred years ago.\n\n\tBallet dancers put a lot of strain on their bodies, so they don't usually have long careers -- and a hundred years is really pushing it. Something uncanny is going on, and Angel decides to investigate. He takes Cordelia to help him find the backstage entrance. Fred, Gunn, and Wesley stay behind to watch the rest of the performance. \n"}, {"text": "After sneaking backstage, Angel and Cordelia find themselves in a seemingly endless torch-lit hall. There's definitely something uncanny going on. They slip into an empty dressing room and presto, they're possessed. What sort of scene do the spirits enact through them?", "correct": "A romantic interlude", "options": ["A confrontation between spies", "A furious duel", "A tearful farewell between father and daughter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA romantic interlude.\n\n\tThe scene is one of passion between the prima ballerina and an illicit sweetheart, \"Stefan.\" They are desperate to be together, but keep pulling back, fearful that \"he\" will find out; we learn that \"he\" is very possessive and has a fearsome temper. Angel and Cordelia are clearly very uncomfortable that all this is playing out using their personal bodies, but after experiencing two such scenes, Angel has a much clearer idea about what's at the root of these strange happenings. \n"}, {"text": "As our heroes wander the haunted corridors backstage, they are set upon by twin assailants, dressed all in black. What kind of masks do they wear?", "correct": "White masks representing comedy and tragedy", "options": ["Feathered masks held up to the eyes", "Rubber ghoul masks", "Cardboard politician masks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite masks representing comedy and tragedy.\n\n\tSince the time of the ancient Greeks, the theater has been symbolized by two white masks showing the two faces of drama. One mask, with upturned eyes and a wide grin, is the face of comedy; the other, with downcast eyes and an intense frown, shows the face of tragedy. The villain's minions are these masks personified: one of them weeps as he fences with our heroes, and the other one laughs.\r Cordelia and Angel fend off one pair in the haunted dressing room; another pair attacks Fred, Gunn, and Wesley, who have come to check on their friends, in a hallway. Gunn is lightly wounded, and shares a first kiss with Fred in the aftermath. These dramatic swordsmen keep coming, though: the wizard who maintains the enchantment conjures them up faster than they fall. \n"}, {"text": "As his sword-wielding henchmen are struck down, the enchanter conjures up more -- but each new pair weakens the overall enchantment. Angel's friends exploit this fact to create a diversion, while Angel himself finds the lead performer and hears her story. What actress, who would star in the Joss Whedon show \"Firefly\" just months later, plays this cursed woman?", "correct": "Summer Glau", "options": ["Gina Torres", "Sarah Michelle Gellar", "Eliza Dushku"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSummer Glau.\n\n\tAngel finds the prima ballerina literally waiting in the wings, ready to make her next entrance. In a stunning monologue, she tells him everything. How she loved Stefan. How Count Kurskov, owner of the company, was jealous. How she hesitated to leave, fearing the loss of her career, and now has lost everything in an enchanted, eternally repeating loop of time. \"He made me. He owns me. When I dance, it's only for him ... But always, at the same moment, I slip. It isn't just the same ballet, it's the same performance. I don't dance, I echo.\" She begs Angel to make it stop.\r \"Waiting in the Wings\" first aired on February 4, 2002; it was Summer Glau's first acting job. That fall she was gracing television screens again, as the fugitive River in \"Firefly.\" \n"}, {"text": "Angel runs onto the stage, pauses, and leaps into the box where the enchanter has been watching. How does Angel end the curse?", "correct": "By smashing the enchanter's power center", "options": ["By applauding before the end of the performance", "By appealing to sweet reason", "By killing the enchanter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy smashing the enchanter's power center.\n\n\tThe owner of the ballet, Count Kurskov (Mark Harelik), has been keeping the prima ballerina in an eternal time loop by drawing from his power center, a large red jewel that he conveniently wears as a tie clip. (Pro tip for evil overlords: power centers belong in safe deposit boxes.) With the force of his enchantment weakened (first by the attacks on his minions, and then by the ballerina dancing her own steps), he is easily overpowered by Angel.\r His power center and enchantment destroyed, Kurskov is distraught. The prima ballerina makes a deep bow to Angel, and then vanishes. The audience is surprisingly unfazed. \n"}, {"text": "Back at the hotel, wounds are tended, victory is celebrated, and lovers are reunited. Cordelia erupts in happiness when she catches sight of a surprise visitor -- her old flame from the demon dimension of Pylea. Who is he?", "correct": "The Groosalugg", "options": ["Holtz", "Landok", "Numfar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Groosalugg.\n\n\tThe Groosalugg, played by Mark Lutz, is a part-human, part-demon who is familiar from a story arc at the end of the second season. For complicated reasons, Cordelia was briefly honored as a princess of Pylea, and the Groosalugg was her champion and her sweetheart. He stayed behind to govern when she returned to L.A., but it seems he's been deposed -- and he's come to find her. Cordelia couldn't be more starry-eyed. And Angel couldn't be more jealous. \n"}]}
