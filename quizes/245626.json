{"id": "245626", "name": "Top Movies of 2003 Trivia Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "2000s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall, along with two hired hands, drive cattle across the still virgin western frontier.  After passing a town where they have purchased supplies, they run into trouble from the henchman of a corrupt local land baron.  Exciting gun mayhem ensues, in true revisionist Western fashion.\n\nWhat was the name of this beautifully made 2003 film, directed by Costner?", "correct": "Open Range", "options": ["High Plains Drifter", "The Left Handed Gun", "Extreme Prejudice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOpen Range.\n\n\t'Open Range' was certainly one of the best surprises of 2003.  After failing miserably with two major projects in the 1990s (namely 'Waterworld' and 'The Postman'), it seemed like Kevin Costner would never recapture the magic he found with 'Dances with Wolves', but he did well with 'Open Range'.  'Open Range' also happened to be the last live film appearance from Michael Jeter, who you may recognize from films such as 'The Fisher King' and 'The Green Mile'. \n"}, {"text": "One of the true box-office shockers of 2003, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' was a booming success for everyone involved.  Engaging, entertaining and energetic, the film featured the acting of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, among others.  Who directed this great film with a massive fan following? ", "correct": "Gore Verbinski", "options": ["David Fincher", "Michael Bay", "Michael Apted"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGore Verbinski.\n\n\t'Pirates of the Caribbean' launched Johnny Depp into the acting stratosphere, and made Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly into bona fide box office draws.  It also established Gore Verbinski, creator of such films as 'Mousehunt' and 'The Ring' as one of the go-to directors of Hollywood. \n"}, {"text": "Before his subsequent Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2005, what charming thespian lent his substantial acting talents to 2003's low-key 'American Splendor', a biographical sketch of Harvey Pekar, a comic book writing everyman who hit it big in the 80s and 90s?", "correct": "Paul Giamatti", "options": ["Matt Dillon", "Jake Gyllenhaal", "William Hurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul Giamatti.\n\n\t'American Splendor' is truly a unique film, interweaving the drama of a free-flowing biopic, starring Giamatti as Pekar, with very self-conscious insertions of Pekar himself, commentating as if the film were in documentary form.  Credit also must be given to the very underrated actress Hope Davis, who plays the role of Harvey's long-suffering wife Joyce.  She's marvelous! \n"}, {"text": "I found 'Lost in Translation' to be one of the most charming and disarming films of 2003, in part because of the seemingly effortless performance by Bill Murray as a disillusioned Hollywood superstar, but mainly as a result of Sofia Coppola's masterful direction.  In what country does the action of this quirky film take place?", "correct": "Japan", "options": ["France", "Russia", "India"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\t'Lost in Translation' was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Actor for Bill Murray and Best Director and Best Picture for Sofia Coppola.  Coppola came away with the only win for the film, a much deserved Original Screenplay Oscar.  Coppola captures very well the disorientation of living overseas, and she expertly creates an aura of romance that defies the need for any eroticism.  Well done! \n"}, {"text": "One of the most intriguing films of 2003 was 'Master and Commander', a movie starring Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey, captain of a British ship that pursues a French man-of-war around the rough waters of South America.  What is the subtitle of this gripping adventure film?", "correct": "The Far Side of the World", "options": ["Riding the Rough Seas", "Battle of the Warriors", "Into the Unknown Waters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Far Side of the World.\n\n\tAustralian director Peter Weir does some of his best work in this film that manages to inject low-key humor and drama into this otherwise action-filled epic.  Though the film was nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Director and Best Picture, it only won two.  It probably deserved more! \n"}, {"text": "'21 Grams' is a 2003 film that is, literally, not for the faint of heart.  Directed by the Mexican master Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, it features an excellent cast, including all but which of the following?", "correct": "Tea Leoni", "options": ["Sean Penn", "Benicio Del Toro", "Naomi Watts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTea Leoni.\n\n\tAlejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu has brought to the screen some of the best films of the 2000s, including 'Amores perros' and 'Babel'.  '21 Grams' was his first full length feature film in the English language, and what a debut it was!  I strongly recommend having a look at all his films, difficult as they may be to watch at times. \n"}, {"text": "Airplane pilot Charlie Halliday, played by Barry Pepper, is trapped in the Canadian tundra with a young Inuit woman, stricken with tuberculosis.  Despite her illness, she helps the hapless Halliday to survive the harsh weather conditions of the Arctic.\n\nWhat captivating 2003 film is described here?", "correct": "The Snow Walker", "options": ["Land of No Return", "Solo", "A Far Off Place"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Snow Walker.\n\n\tBarry Peppers is excellent (as usual!) as Halliday, an overconfident pilot who finds himself completely helpless in a hostile weather environment.  Annabella Piugattuk is charming as Kanaalaq, a woman perfectly at home on the Arctic tundra, whose only limitation is her debilitating disease.  This movie is based on the written work by Farley Mowat.  Check it out! \n"}, {"text": "'The Station Agent' is the story of Finbar McBride, a man who seeks solitude in a rural New Jersey town but finds new companionship in completely unexpected places.  What is the name of the actor who plays McBride, a disgruntled, lonely man who finds compassion and, eventually, new meaning in his life?", "correct": "Peter Dinklage", "options": ["Jeremy Bergman", "Jayce Bartok", "Joe Lo Truglio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter Dinklage.\n\n\tPeter Dinklage, who, as a result of his dwarfism, has typically found roles that focus on his height, such as the one he played in the movie 'Elf', finds himself the leading man in 'The Station Agent', a completely unique film.  Starring alongside Dinklage is the charming Patricia Clarkson, who really shines as Olivia Harris, a divorcee who has lost her son.  This movie deserves your attention! \n"}, {"text": "In the role that he was born to play, Jack Black practically soars as a washed-up loser, booted out of his own hard rock band, who seizes for himself a second lease on life by posing as a substitute teacher.  Yes, I speak of 'School of Rock', one of the sleeper films of 2003.  What is the name of Jack Black's excitable and rather unprincipled character in this risible cinematic treat?", "correct": "Dewey Finn", "options": ["Angelo Estefan", "Doug Di Marco", "Yngwie Chodd"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDewey Finn.\n\n\tRichard Linklater expertly directs this film that features largely a cast of pre-teens, many of them with little to no acting experience (but with plenty of musical talent).  Somehow, he manages to bring out their hidden acting talents, meshing them with Jack Black, who seems almost constantly energized.  Also appearing are Joan Cusack, the stiff but sympathetic school principal, and Sarah Silverman, Dewey Finn's nemesis.  Both are very good! \n"}, {"text": "A 2003 film biopic with an unusual title, namely 'Baadasssss!', it focuses on the early film career of one of the pioneers of African American cinema.  What filmmaker's difficult early filmmaking years are depicted in this riveting piece of cinema?", "correct": "Melvin Van Peebles", "options": ["Gordon Parks", "Tim Reid", "Spike Lee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMelvin Van Peebles.\n\n\tParticularly, the film, directed by Van Peeble's son Mario, focused on the making of Melvin's first movie, 1970's 'Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song' (thus the title).  The movie is alternatively named 'How to Get the Man's Foot Outta Your Ass', so take a look at it under that title if you are unable to find it as 'Baadasssss!'  It is most certainly Mario Van Peebles best film.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it.  Please feel free to let me know what your favorite films of 2003 were. \n"}]}
