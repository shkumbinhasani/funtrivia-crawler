{"id": "169448", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Smilin' Jack' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "A young soldier is injured by a nearby bomb explosion, and he is rushed to Battalion Aide.  From there, the chopper pilot Smilin' Jack transports him to the M*A*S*H 4077th for immediate surgery.  Jack enters the O.R. during the surgery to see how his patient is doing.  What regular habit does he have with the patients he transports that prompts Frank to call him a ghoul?", "correct": "He photographs them on the operating table", "options": ["He lists the types of injuries they have in a notepad", "He takes a charcoal rubbing of their dog tags", "He collects bullets and fragments from their surgeries"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe photographs them on the operating table.\n\n\tAfter Smilin' Jack takes the patient's picture he explains that he has a picture of 'every one of them that lived'.  According to Jack, 'it's kind of like stepping on a crack.  If I take their picture, they live!'  Jack later takes a picture of Frank in order to placate the unhappy fellow. \n"}, {"text": "We find out during the conversation in the O.R. that Smilin' Jack has which of the following surnames?", "correct": "Mitchell", "options": ["Ransom", "Pratchett", "Spengler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMitchell.\n\n\tWe discover that Lieutenant \"Smilin'\" Jack Mitchell has transported 839 wounded soldiers up to this point.  For some reason, these chopper pilots seem to be very attractive to the nurses.  It appears that he will have a date with a young nurse named Cathy King following the surgery. \n"}, {"text": "Smilin' Jack is one of the most successful and proficient chopper pilots in Korea.  However, there is another chopper pilot that Jack considers a serious rival.  Which pilot does Jack mention by name?", "correct": "Dangerous Dan", "options": ["The Cowboy", "High Flyin' Brian", "Jester Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDangerous Dan.\n\n\tWhile Jack has carried 839 wounded soldiers to the 4077th, Dangerous Dan has transported 842.  Smilin' Jack seems intent to surpass Dangerous Dan and make 'Chopper Pilot of the Year', but some complications might prevent such a thing from happening as we shall see. \n"}, {"text": "Smilin' Jack continues to hang around about camp.  He visits Colonel Potter's office to reacquaint himself with the Colonel.  It seems they met at the 121st Evac.  Potter convinces his friend Jack to make a trade; the 4077th needs streptomycin.  What will the 4077th offer Jack in return?", "correct": "Aftershave lotion", "options": ["Mosquito netting", "Ice cream", "Ping pong balls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAftershave lotion.\n\n\tAt first, Radar suggests trading some DDT and/or tongue depressors, but Jack wants neither.  The aftershave lotion appears to hit the spot, since, as Jack claims, the 8063rd can use some new specimen bottles. \n"}, {"text": "While Potter and Jack converse, the Colonel suspects that there is something the matter with Jack's health.  What tips the Colonel off to this?", "correct": "Jack's hand has a wound that won't heal", "options": ["Jack suddenly feels dizzy and must sit down", "Jack's stubborn refusal to drink a toast", "Jack has a sporadic hacking cough"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack's hand has a wound that won't heal.\n\n\tWhen Jack offers Potter a cigar he notices an old wound that he had treated 'months ago'.  Jack makes light of the subject, but later on when Potter sees the chopper pilot in the officer's club with Hawkeye and BJ he 'grounds' Jack until he has had a complete physical.  Before this, Jack performs a neat (but probably impossible) trick with a syringe, a spoon and an orange. \n"}, {"text": "While Jack's health is in question, the young man who he recently transported to the 4077th, Corporal Owens, is recovering well.  What is unique about Owens, who confides in BJ that he doesn't want to return to the front lines?", "correct": "He has earned two Purple Hearts", "options": ["He is only 16-years old", "He has assumed another identity", "He is openly a homosexual"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has earned two Purple Hearts.\n\n\tCorporal Owens has already been 'clobbered' twice by the enemy, and doesn't want to return to the front lines.  He describes for BJ the terror of battle, which the Chinese make worse by blowing bugles and whistles late at night. \n"}, {"text": "Despite being 'grounded' by Hawkeye and BJ, after they discover that Jack has diabetes, he flies off again to pick up more wounded soldiers.  How many does he need to transport back to the M*A*S*H to break the record during this, his last flight?", "correct": "4", "options": ["5", "3", "6"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4.\n\n\tSmilin' Jack attempts the almost impossible feat of carrying four men at one time in his chopper.  Somehow he manages to successfully transport them to the 4077th, thus breaking Dangerous Dan's record.  But this success is short-lived; Dangerous Dan returns to the camp soon after Jack with a couple more wounded soldiers, again surpassing Jack. \n"}, {"text": "Radar is next to sit with Corporal Owens.  Radar attempts to assuage Owens with his midwestern charm, and he apparently succeeds in helping to relax his newfound friend.  What item does Radar give to Owens for luck?", "correct": "Four-leaf clover", "options": ["Rabbit's foot", "A pen", "A marble"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour-leaf clover.\n\n\tRadar keeps a four-leaf clover for luck, but figures that Owens needs it more than him.  The poor lad willingly returns to the front lines by the end of the episode, even despite his having been wounded in battle.  Everyone sees the irony in the fact that Smilin' Jack is being sent home, when he prefers to stay, while Owens is sent back to battle, though he wants to return to the States. \n"}, {"text": "By the end of the episode, we see Corporal Owens climbing on a bus headed for Seoul.  Does he claim he will be returning home?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe heroic Corporal Owens will further recover in Seoul, after which he will be sent back to the front lines.  He suggests to Radar that he hopes he doesn't see him again, which would potentially mean a third Purple Heart. \n"}, {"text": "The final scene of the episode occurs in the O.R., where Hawkeye, BJ and Potter are hard at work.  When Hawkeye asks the Colonel which of the three wars he has experienced is the worst, how does Potter answer?", "correct": "Each and every one", "options": ["World War II", "The Korean War", "World War I"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEach and every one.\n\n\tAfter regaling us with his stories of Duncan McShane, the 'craziest pilot he ever knew', Potter is sobered by some disturbing news over the P.A. system.  Hawkeye's question has only one obvious answer for Colonel Potter (and a gimme for you, the quiztaker!)  Thanks for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
