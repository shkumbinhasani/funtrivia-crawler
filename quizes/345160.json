It seems like a nice place to stop to rest my wings.  It looks like this mosque is on the neck of the \"path of Cygnus\".\n\nWhere on earth is the Sankore Mosque?  I know I am in Mali, but what city is it?", "correct": "Timbuktu", "options": ["Tessalit", "Tominian", "Taghaza"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTimbuktu.\n\n\tTimbuktu, also called Timbuctoo or Tombouctou, is a city right in the middle of Mali.

I think it is time for a rest, here, in Zaire! (On the phone: bwah bwah bwah bwah bwah)  What, what's that?  It's not called Zaire anymore?  Well, that's just terrific.

Its capital is Kinshasa, although that is much further south than where my point on the map fell.  More specifically, the point landed just north of the equator, but south of the Congo River, but still completely within the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \n"}, {"text": "I think that while I rest at Cygnus' tail, I will do some diving in Flic en Flac.  I am a swan, after all, so diving is easy for me!  I have heard some scary stories of a famous species of bird that became extinct here, but for now, I am going to ignore that and take in the beautiful sites of this magnificent island nation.\n\nI don't know the name of the country, though.  Where on earth am I?", "correct": "Mauritius", "options": ["Madagascar", "Mauritania", "Comoros"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMauritius.\n\n\tFlic en Flac is a famous tourist spot on the island of Mauritius, though it is not as popular as Grand Baie.  Mauritius is famous for being the once-home of the dodo bird, which became extinct on the island in the 17th century.  It was very easy prey, as the bird was none-too-bright.\r This scared Bonny, and she decided to start flying again. \n"}, {"text": "I've found my way to the right upper wing of Cygnus, and it happens to be located in a very hot country.  Since I was so close, I toured the ancient ruins of Tanis.  But as the day went on, it just kept getting hotter, so I decided to take a bath in Lake Manzala.\n\nAah, now that's refreshing.

It is also just a few miles away from the ancient ruins of Tanis. \n"}, {"text": "I have been flying for so long, I think I need a break to grab a bite to eat!  I settled down in the Krubera Cave and enjoyed some khinkali for lunch.\n\nI love Atlanta.  Wait, what?  You mean to tell me I'm not in Atlanta?  I'm in Abkhazia?  Well, then, where on earth am I?", "correct": "Georgia", "options": ["Turkey", "Jordan", "Latvia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorgia.\n\n\tKrubera Cave is the world's deepest known cave, and is located in Abkhazia, Georgia.  Georgia being the country, of course, and not the state.  That is, perhaps, where Bonny thought she was.\r Khinkali is a type of meat dumpling, and is quite a popular dish in the country of Georgia. \n"}, {"text": "I am near the tip of Cygnus' wings, and I am getting hot again.  Time for a bath in the Garabogazkol Aylagy, my favorite body of water.\n\nGarabogazkol Aylagy is its own body of water, but when water levels rise, it becomes a bay of the world's largest lake.  Where on earth is Bonny?", "correct": "Caspian Sea", "options": ["Mediterranean Sea", "Sea of Azov", "Caribbean Sea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaspian Sea.\n\n\tThe Caspian Sea, though the name can be deceiving, is actually the world's largest lake.  Garabogazkol Aylagy is a body of water that is separated from the Caspian Sea by just a thin piece of land.  There is a very narrow opening in this thin piece of land that allows the Caspian to drain into the G.A. (I've typed it out three times already, don't make me do it again), but when the waters rise with the seasons, it appears more as a bay than a body of water on its own. \n"}, {"text": "I love Russia.  One of my favorite things to eat is borscht.  My favorite city to visit while I'm in Russia is Orsk, which also happens to be the tip of Cygnus' right wing, which is why I'm here!\n\nOrsk, as well as the Or River, is located in which Russian federal subject, which borders Kazakhstan?", "correct": "Orenburg", "options": ["Irkutsk", "Komi", "Kamchatka"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrenburg.\n\n\tOrsk is a city in Orenburg Oblast which is a federal subject (or oblast) of Russia that pokes into Kazakhstan.

There was no place to rest, and I thought I wouldn't make it.  Fortunately, I was able to find my way to the Americas, landing just on the shores of Ponta do Seixas.\n\nPonta do Seixas is the easternmost point of the Americas.

My journey ends at the tip of Cygnus' left wing, which is at the Chilean border.  Chile has a long border, and I know it borders more than one country; stop hassling me.  I do know that my destination has led me to the border of Chile and its northernmost neighbor.\n\nWith which neighbor does Chile share its northern border, which is also where I will stay for several months before I travel back to my other home in Europe?", "correct": "Peru", "options": ["Argentina", "Brazil", "Guatemala"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeru.\n\n\tChile is the long, thin country on the west coast of South America.
