{"id": "330459", "name": "The Music of \"Glee\" 7 Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Glee"], "questions": [{"text": "In an attempt to emulate Lady Gaga, many members of New Directions perform \"Bad Romance\" in Gaga-esque costumes.  Which of these is not one of the costumes seen here?", "correct": "The red lace costumes from the \"Bad Romance\" music video", "options": ["The bubble dress (as seen on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\")", "The satellite dress (and accompanying satellite handpiece (as seen at the Grammy Awards)", "The lobster headpiece"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe red lace costumes from the \"Bad Romance\" music video.\n\n\tWhile seeing these outrageous costumes in real life may have helped, it's clear which ones are worn when the girls of New Directions (and Kurt) hit the stage to perform Lady Gaga's #1 hit single \"Bad Romance\" from her second album, \"The Fame Monster\".  Reaching the top spot on two of the US Billboard charts in 2009, \"Bad Romance\" was the CD's first single (followed by \"Telephone\" as seen in \"Glee's\" second season and \"Alejandro\").  The \"Glee\" version of \"Bad Romance\" appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 3 - The Showstoppers\" and charted at #54 on the 'Billboard Top 100'.\rIn attempting to demonstrate theatricality, the girls take on Gaga's hit single (with Kurt) and create their own Gaga costumes at home.  Quinn wears the satellite outfit, Brittany wears the obscure lobster headpiece, and Tina wears the plastic bubble dress while others take on different looks throughout.  The red lace costumes were featured in the episode, but they were worn by members of Vocal Adrenaline. \n"}, {"text": "When performing Kiss in \"Theatricality\", the boys of New Directions select which song?", "correct": "Shout It Out Loud", "options": ["Rock and Roll All Nite", "Strutter", "Detroit Rock City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShout It Out Loud.\n\n\tWhile \"Shout It Out Loud\" never charted (from the \"Glee\" episode, that is), the original by Kiss reached #31 on the Billboard charts upon its release in 1976.  It originally appeared on the band's \"Destroyer\" album.  The \"Glee\" version of this song did not appear in \"Glee: The Music, Vol. 3 - The Showstoppers\".  The other Kiss song performed in this episode, \"Beth\", did chart at #72 on the Billboard 'Hot 100' for \"Glee\" and it did appear on the album.  Kiss' original reached #7 on the same chart in 1976.\rThe guys, worried about needing to perform a Lady Gaga number, approach theatricality from a different angle with this song.  The guys later sing \"Beth\" (with Puck on lead vocals) in the choir room.  Quinn and Puck decide to name their unborn child Beth, if it's a girl. \n"}, {"text": "\"Poker Face\" (in \"Theatricality\") is performed by Rachel and which other person?", "correct": "Shelby", "options": ["Mercedes", "Finn", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShelby.\n\n\tWhen Rachel and Shelby decide to leave their mother-daughter relationship as it is and approach each other when they're more comfortable, Rachel asks her mother if they can perform a duet as she'd always had the dream to do so.  Keeping in theme with the \"Theatricality\" episode, Shelby and Rachel perform a version of \"Poker Face\" with nothing more than their vocals and the piano.  This song appeared on \"Glee, The Music: Vol. 3 - The Showstoppers\" where it reached #20 in the US.  This would be the second highest-charting song in season 1's latter half.\rThe song, Lady Gaga's second major single, was perhaps her most popular from her debut album.  Nominated for three Grammies, it won one (for 'Best Dance Recording').  The song was #1 on the 'Billboard Hot 100' and two other charts in the US and has since gone multi-platinum around the world. \n"}, {"text": "While working at Sheets 'N' Things in the episode entitled \"Funk\", Puck and Finn play what song by Beck?", "correct": "Loser", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoser.\n\n\t\"Loser\", by Beck, originally hit #10 on the 'Billboard Hot 100' and this single (Beck's first) was what inevitably led to his major record deal.  It also appeared on the 1993 album \"Mellow Gold\".  The \"Glee\" rendition of \"Loser\" peaked at #93 on the 'Hot 100' and appeared on \"Glee, The Music: Vol. 3 - The Showstoppers\".\rWhen Puck and Finn slash the tires on Vocal Adrenaline's fleet of Range Rovers, they're forced to pay for damages and get jobs at Sheets 'N' Things where Terri Schuester happens to work.  While dealing with Sandy Ryerson as a customer, Puck cranks the radio to play this song which he and Finn make a duet (with the staff of Sheets 'N' Things backing). \n"}, {"text": "In \"Funk\", Puck, Finn and Mercedes decide to band together to perform a number to the Beach Boys song \"Good Vibrations\" in the choir room.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhile the three of them do perform \"Good Vibrations\" in the choir room (as per Terri's suggestion from the Sheets 'N' Things iTunes playlists), they actually perform the version by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch (feat. Loleatta Holloway) which was released in 1991.  Contrary to what they thought they were performing, Will lets them know that they didn't actually pick a funk genre song; they simply picked one with the word 'Funk' in the band name.\rThe original \"Good Vibrations\" (by Marky Mark) reached #1 on two different 'Billboard' charts (including the 'Hot 100').  The \"Glee\" version, while not appearing on \"Glee, The Music: Vol. 3 - The Showstoppers\", reached #69 on the same chart becoming the highest-charting song from the episode. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these people does not perform \"Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)\" at the end of \"Funk\"?", "correct": "Jesse", "options": ["Rachel", "Kurt", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJesse.\n\n\tJesse, having defected from McKinley and transferred back to Carmel High School and Vocal Adrenaline, no longer performs with New Directions as of this episode.  His choice was made to cripple both Rachel (emotionally) and the Glee Club as a whole talent-wise.  After a 'funkification' to the tone of Queen's \"Another One Bites the Dust\" early in the episode, New Directions retaliates with \"Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)\" by Parliament as funk is a genre that Vocal Adrenaline has never been able to perform (since they're soulless automatons).\rWhile the original song by Parliament appeared on two US 'Billboard' charts, the \"Glee\" version never charted in the States though it did appear on \"Glee, The Music: Vol. 3 - The Showstoppers\".  All twelve members of Vocal Adrenaline performed it. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Journey\", New Directions performs four different Journey songs.  Which of these is not one of them?", "correct": "Separate Ways", "options": ["Any Way You Want It", "Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'", "Faithfully"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeparate Ways.\n\n\tWhen the kids finally make it to Regionals, they all decide to perform a Journey medley as their first big number, \"Don't Stop Believin'\", was so integral.  They begin with \"Faithfully\", performed by Rachel and Finn, move into a mash-up of \"Any Way You Want It\" and \"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\" as a group, and end with their new and improved version of \"Don't Stop Believin'\".  While this results in a standing ovation from the crowd, New Directions places third at Sectionals and faces disbandment.\rAll of these songs appeared on a special EP release, \"Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals\".  Their mash-up released to #58 on the 'Billboard Hot 100' while \"Faithfully\" became the top-seller from the disc peaking at #37.  The album hit #1 on the 'Billboard' albums chart and the new version of \"Don't Stop Believin'\" was nominated for a Grammy. \n"}, {"text": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is performed by which of these in \"Journey\"?", "correct": "Vocal Adrenaline", "options": ["New Directions", "Aural Intensity", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVocal Adrenaline.\n\n\tDuring Regionals, while New Directions rushes to the hospital after Quinn's water breaks, Vocal Adrenaline ends up performing this Queen classic on stage (with Jesse taking on the lead vocals).  The performance ends up giving Vocal Adrenaline the win, once again sending them to Nationals.  Aural Intensity placed second with a mash-up of Olivia Newton-John and Josh Groban, two of the judges for Regionals.\r\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" reached #84 on the 'Billboard Top 100' and appeared on \"Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals\".  The original \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a Queen classic.  It first appeared on \"A Night at the Opera\" in 1975 and peaked at #2 on the 'Top 100' in the U.S. \n"}, {"text": "To whom was \"To Sir, with Love\" dedicated in \"Journey\"?", "correct": "Will", "options": ["Sue", "Finn", "Principal Figgins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill.\n\n\tDespite the fact that New Directions didn't place at Regionals, the kids are grateful that they spent the time together.  They perform \"To Sir, With Love\" as a gift to their leader and mentor in the auditorium.  Unbeknown to the kids, Sue is watching from the shadows at the top of the auditorium and she realizes that Will is a good teacher.  She speaks to Principal Figgins and Glee Club gets another year to prove their worth.\r\"To Sir, With Love\" was originally performed by Lulu in 1967 hitting the top of the 'Billboard Hot 100'.  It was also remade by Tina Arena in 2007.  The \"Glee\" version, appearing on \"Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals\", reached #76 on the same chart. \n"}, {"text": "What was the last song performed in the first season (as seen in \"Journey\")?", "correct": "Over the Rainbow", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOver the Rainbow.\n\n\tIn the end, Will tells New Directions that they've been given another year of Glee Club.  To thank them for their dedicated performance of \"To Sir, With Love\", he brings out the ukulele and asks Puck to join him in singing \"Over the Rainbow\".  This song ends the season as things start looking up for the kids in Glee.\r\"Over the Rainbow\" peaked at #43 on the 'Billboard Hot 100' and showed as the final song on \"Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals\".  The original was performed by Judy Garland in the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\" and is, by all means, a classic.  The rendition featured in \"Glee\" most resembles Israel Kamakawiwo\u02bbole's ukulele cover released in 1993. \n"}]}
