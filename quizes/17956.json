{"id": "17956", "name": "What's Your Dog Saying? Trivia Quiz | Dogs | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Dogs", "Dog Behavior"], "questions": [{"text": "You catch your dog doing something you don't want him to, and you yell at him. Your dog is not making eye contact with you. His lips are pulled back and his ears are flat against his head. He turns his head away from you and licks his lips when you approach. What is your dog expressing?", "correct": "Submission", "options": ["Stubbornness", "Fear", "Guilt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSubmission.\n\n\tYour dog is expressing that he does not wish to challenge your leadership. He accepts that you are the boss. Submissive dogs never stare at dominant dogs. Don't punish a dog that acts like this- he's already saying, 'You're the boss!' \n"}, {"text": "You meet a strange dog. He snarls at you with his hackles (the hair on his back) raised. His tail is held low and stiff, and his ears are laid back. What is this dog saying?", "correct": "I am afraid and may bite or run.", "options": ["I am afraid and will run away.", "I am the boss and I am going to bite you.", "I am angry."], "explanation": "\n\n\nI am afraid and may bite or run.\n\n\tThis is the classic profile of a fear biter. These dogs are the most dangerous, as they feel that they must bite to protect themselves. If they can run, they will, but if they feel cornered they will attack, often ferociously. They don't have the confidence of the dominant dog. Give this dog an escape route and don't force yourself on him! \n"}, {"text": "Your male dog is chattering his teeth. Which of these is a likely reason?", "correct": "I smell a bitch in heat", "options": ["I am tired", "I am feeling carsick", "I am hungry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI smell a bitch in heat.\n\n\tThis may be related to a courtship ritual in which the male dog nibbles the hair on the ears of the female. It may also help increase the transfer of scent to the nasal membranes. \n"}, {"text": "Your male dog mounts another male. What is the most likely reason?", "correct": "To show that he is the boss.", "options": ["Because he is homosexual.", "Because he wants to mate and is frustrated.", "Because he likes the other dog."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo show that he is the boss.\n\n\tDespite many misconceptions, this is a dominance ritual. It is perfectly normal. Neutered dogs and females also mount to show dominance. \n"}, {"text": "A dog is approaching you slowly. He is looking directly into your eyes and seems to be walking on his tiptoes. His ears are up and his tail is also up and wagging slowly. What is he saying?", "correct": "I may bite you.", "options": ["I am friendly.", "I am curious.", "I am scared."], "explanation": "\n\n\nI may bite you.\n\n\tThis is a very dominant dog. If you stare at him or otherwise challenge his dominance, he is likely to bite. When a dog like this comes towards you, turn your side to the dog and do not stare at him! Talk soothingly and quietly, and try to back away. \n"}, {"text": "Your dog faces you, panting. He bows down on his front legs with his tail wagging quickly. He yaps a little. What is he saying?", "correct": "Play with me!", "options": ["I need to go outside!", "I am frustrated.", "I want some food."], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlay with me!.\n\n\tThis is a happy, relaxed dog who wants to have some fun! \n"}, {"text": "You ask your dog to stay and walk away. Your dog yawns. What is he saying?", "correct": "I am nervous.", "options": ["I am bored.", "I am tired.", "I need a walk."], "explanation": "\n\n\nI am nervous.\n\n\tDogs yawn when they are nervous about something. You often see dogs yawn in obedience classes when an owner is being too harsh with them. Some misled owners correct yawning dogs thinking that they are not paying attention- bad idea! \n"}, {"text": "A dog you don't know comes up to you and takes your hand in his mouth without biting it. What is he saying?", "correct": "Hello!", "options": ["I am worried.", "I want some food.", "If you move, I'll bite you."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHello!.\n\n\tBelieve it or not, this is a friendly gesture! It's equivalent to a human handshake. Dogs will grasp each others' muzzles in the same way. \n"}, {"text": "You approach a puppy whom you just caught urinating on the floor. He rolls over on his back and urinates again. What is he saying?", "correct": "I am submissive.", "options": ["I am spiteful. I urinate on the floor on purpose.", "I am housebroken.", "I will pee where I please."], "explanation": "\n\n\nI am submissive.\n\n\tThis puppy should not be punished. This behavior is the canine equivalent of saying, 'I'm sorry!' and if you punish it you'll set up a vicious cycle of reoccurrence. \n"}, {"text": "You are teaching your dog something new. After a bit of work, he scratches at his neck. You are sure he doesn't have any fleas. Why is he scratching?", "correct": "He needs a break.", "options": ["He is being stubborn.", "He is hungry.", "He wants to pull his collar off."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe needs a break.\n\n\tBehaviors like scratching and shaking like a wet dog happen because of 'sensory overload.' The dog needs a break to calm down. \n"}]}
