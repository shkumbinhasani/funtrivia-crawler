{"id": "341457", "name": "A Non-Food Hobbies Quiz | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", " Hobbies Other"], "questions": [{"text": "Astrology uses many animals as star signs, many of which are animals which we eat.  But which of these astrological signs is of an animal you might find in a Cajun Boil meal?", "correct": "Cancer", "options": ["Taurus", "Scorpio", "Aries"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCancer.\n\n\tCancer is the sign of the crab.  A Cajun Boil meal is one that consists of seafood, potatoes, and corn (and sometimes other foods).  It is prepared by boiling the items in a spicy Cajun-flavored broth.  A Cajun Boil is often served by throwing all the food on the table.  No plates are used, but tiny forks and shell crackers are used to get the meat out of the crab shells and lobster shells. \n"}, {"text": "Collectibles: Many people collect quarters, particularly state quarters.  Three of them have pictures of food items for which they are famous on the quarter.  Which of these does NOT have a food pictured on the quarter?", "correct": "Florida", "options": ["Wisconsin", "Georgia", "Vermont"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlorida.\n\n\tOf all the 50 state quarters, many include animals (some of which we DO eat) but only three contain other types of food we eat.  Georgia has a picture of the state fruit, the peach (Georgia is also the largest peach producer).  Vermont has a picture of two maple trees with sap buckets, thus showing the process of obtaining maple syrup, for which Vermont is well known.  Finally, Wisconsin has an ear of corn (state grain) as well as a wheel of cheese.  Wisconsin is extremely famous for its cheese (Wisconsin residents are even often called \"cheese heads\"). \n"}, {"text": "Crafts: Sometimes, kids make paper dolls.  Others make yarn dolls.  Still others choose to make dolls out of what material?", "correct": "Corn husks", "options": ["Apple cores", "Cherry stems", "Leftover spaghetti noodles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorn husks.\n\n\tCorn husk dolls were once very popular, and still are somewhat common among some cultures.  They were first made by Native Americans.  The dolls were made by wetting the corn husks, thus making them soft.  Then the corn husks would be shaped and tied to form a doll-like shape.  Faces could be added, and so could yarn for hair or even clothing.  They are very simple dolls, but not too difficult to make. \n"}, {"text": "Exercise and Fitness: Who doesn't love ham?  We all have ham; hamstrings, that is.  Which of these exercises would actually benefit your hamstrings?", "correct": "Lunges", "options": ["Push-ups", "Pull-ups", "Curl-ups"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLunges.\n\n\tLunges benefit your calves as well as your hamstrings.  Lunges are a lower-body exercise, so it also works your quadriceps.  Pull-ups and push-ups are upper-body exercises, and do not really benefit your hamstrings at all.  Curl-ups affect your mid-section, as they are designed to strengthen your abs, and really do not use the hamstrings at all. \n"}, {"text": "Board Games: Gramma Nutt is one of the most famous Candyland characters.  On the original Candyland game, what does she make?", "correct": "Peanut Brittle", "options": ["Walnut Brownies", "Macadamia Nut Cookies", "Pecan Pie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeanut Brittle.\n\n\tGramma Nutt is one of the many characters on the 1949 Milton Bradley board game, Candyland.  Gramma Nutt owned the peanut brittle space.  There were also peppermint candy canes, chocolate chip cookies, gumdrops, cupcakes, and lollipops. \n"}, {"text": "Homes and Gardens: Certain flowers can be used as flavorings for teas.  Which of these flowers' \"hips\" are used in the making of tea?", "correct": "Rose", "options": ["Marigold", "Tulip", "Daisy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRose.\n\n\tRose hips are actually the fruit of the rose plant.  These fruits are used to flavor many things, including teas, other beverages, jellies, and pies, to name a few.  Rose petals can also be used to flavor teas, and rosewater is also commonly used. \n"}, {"text": "Needlework: Hot pads are used to pick up hot food dishes as well as to place those dishes upon surfaces you would not put them on directly.  Which of these needlework methods would probably NOT be wise way to make a hot pad?", "correct": "Embroidering", "options": ["Knitting", "Crocheting", "Quilting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmbroidering.\n\n\tEmbroidering is a technique that involves taking small threads and threading them through something to create a beautiful design.  This makes the embroidered piece very stiff, as well as thin, and would not be a practical way to make a hot pad.  Crocheting and knitting would both work to make a hot pad, because you can use very thick yarn and knit or crochet very tightly to allow the hot pad to protect your hand from the heat of the food dish. Quilting is also a good way to make a hot pad.  You can make a mini-quilt by sewing together very small pieces of fabric, or you can just use one piece.  To quilt, you have two layers of fabric as well as some sort of \"filling\", so this would provide sufficient protection in order for you to be able to use your mini-quilt as a hot pad. \n"}, {"text": "Photography: Some people take pictures of food for a living.  To make some of the foods appear more appetizing, however, they do not always use that actual food.  What can be used instead of ice cream so it does not melt as fast?", "correct": "Frosting", "options": ["Whipped cream", "Glue", "Gelato"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrosting.\n\n\tA very thick frosting can be created using shortening, corn syrup, and powdered sugar.  Color is also added depending on the ice cream flavor being depicted.  This does not melt under the hot studio lamps, so it can be used much longer than the actual ice cream for a photo shoot.\r Many interesting techniques are also used for many other food products.  For instance, extra water is often added to drinks to make them sparkle and look more appealing.  Furthermore, the ice you see in drinks such as Coca-Cola is hardly ever actually ice; but instead is just plastic cubes that resemble ice.  Also, water can be sprayed onto a glass to make it look like it is ice cold.  Salad can appear fresh by being sprayed with cold water before arranging a few lettuce leaves on an upside-down bowl placed in a larger bowl, and dressing is sometimes just herbs and spices sprinkled on the lettuce.  There are many other ways people avoid \"food spoiling\" to create gorgeous, more appetizing food works of art.  The following link describes a few of those techniques:\r http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_photography#Styling_techniques \n"}, {"text": "Card Games: Card games use a surprising amount of alcohol references.  Which of these alcoholic beverages is also an actual, popular card game?", "correct": "Gin", "options": ["Vodka", "Beer", "Tequila"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGin.\n\n\tThere are many different variations of gin, including gin rummy and Oklahoma gin.  The object of gin is to get points in your hand before your opponent does.  If you are confident you have more points in your hand than your opponent, you can \"knock\", which will give you points if you were correct.  Sometimes the opponent undercuts, however, and you will lose points. \n"}, {"text": "Hobbies Other: A fun goop called Oobleck was created because of a book called \"Bartholomew and the Oobleck\".  It is a unique substance with only two ingredients; one is water, and the other is a baking ingredient.  Which ingredient, mixed with water, creates Oobleck?", "correct": "Cornstarch", "options": ["Flour", "Powdered Sugar", "Baking Soda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCornstarch.\n\n\tOobleck is made by mixing equal parts cornstarch and water.  You can also add color to it (the original Oobleck was green) by adding food coloring to the water before you mix the water and cornstarch together.  Oobleck is unique because if you punch it hard, it acts as a solid.  However, if you slowly poke it with your finger, it acts as a liquid.  Similarly, if you have it in your hands, constantly moving, it will stay in a ball shape, but as soon as you relax and let the ball of Oobleck to stop moving, it will become liquid and ooze through your fingers.\r \"Bartholomew and the Oobleck\" is a book by Dr. Seuss.\r It can be very entertaining for young children to play with Oobleck.  Try reading \"Bartholomew and the Oobleck\" to them, and then dress as a scientist and create Oobleck for them to play with (recommended outside if you don't like a mess).  I guarantee your young children will have a blast playing with this solid liquid. \n"}]}
