{"id": "342234", "name": "\"I Am Unicorn\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "According to Brittany, who is a unicorn?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Tina", "Santana", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tIn this episode, Kurt starts his school day by tending to his appearance in his locker and Brittany shows up for a chat.  She's decided that she wants to help him run for Senior Class President because he's fabulous and because he's a unicorn; he knows he's magical and he's not afraid to show it.  He asks why she doesn't run since she's so popular and she claims that she's not smart enough to run.  She seems enthusiastic, however, and he accepts her offer.\rIn the choir room, Will informs the Glee kids that Dustin Goolsby has been fired as the head coach of Vocal Adrenaline since they came in second place at Nationals the previous year.  As such, he will no longer direct the school musical; someone else will take on that role. \n"}, {"text": "Who is not instructed to join in Will and Mike's mandatory 'Booty Camp'?", "correct": "Blaine", "options": ["Mercedes", "Kurt", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlaine.\n\n\tTo place focus on New Directions winning Nationals this coming year, Will decides to dedicate more time and energy to the Glee Club this year.  In order to be a bit harder on them he institutes a mandatory Booty Camp after practice every week in order to help the more troubled dancers of New Directions better themselves for the coming competition season and Mike Chang will help him out.  Amongst those required to join are Finn, Puck, Kurt, and Mercedes.  Blaine wants to join as well in order to catch up though he is not required to do so.\rIn regards to the \"West Side Story\" production, Rachel is disappointed to see that Will has placed Coach Beiste and Emma in charge.  They also ask that Artie join as a student director and he gladly accepts with a bit of encouragement from Tina. \n"}, {"text": "According to Shelby, a headhunter was sent to which of the following locations to find her?", "correct": "New York", "options": ["London", "Los Angeles", "Canada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York.\n\n\tWhile making coffee in the teacher's lounge, Will is approached by none other than Shelby Corcoran, an ex-coach of Vocal Adrenaline who beat New Directions at Regionals two years earlier.  To his surprise, she's now teaching part time at McKinley despite having moved to New York with her adopted daughter (Quinn and puck's child, Beth).  She states that she's there because she was hunted out in New York and paid to start a second Glee Club at McKinley because she's the best money can buy. Who bought her?  Al Motta, Sugar's dad, who made a generous donation to get her daughter whatever she wanted to become famous. Shelby is also back in Lima to make right the problems of her past.  Will is in support of her new Glee Club because the school needs more arts programs and he urges on the competition. \n"}, {"text": "Quinn accepts Sue's anti-arts video request on what condition?", "correct": "That Sue purchase couches for 'The Skanks'", "options": ["That she and 'The Skanks' get immunity from expulsion", "That Sue break up Finn and Rachel", "That she receive a carton of cigarettes every week"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat Sue purchase couches for 'The Skanks'.\n\n\tSue finds Quinn holding up a girl for her lunch money in the bathroom and makes a deal with her.  Sue says that there's no one to blame for her fall from grace except the Glee Club and she asks that she participate in a congressional video opposing the arts to help her in the polls.  Quinn agrees to this on the condition that she get thrift store sofas for under the bleachers (since smoking all day makes it hard for her to stand).  Sue agrees.\rKurt, meanwhile, is put off a bit by Brittany's overtly-homosexual, over-the-top campaign posters and 'bulging gift sacks' and suggests that they do something much more subtle.  Brittany is a bit disappointed that Kurt's not fully aboard, but she stresses his need to remain a unicorn because it makes him special. \n"}, {"text": "At Booty Camp it is revealed that who of the following is a Junior in high school?", "correct": "Blaine", "options": ["Mike", "Mercedes", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlaine.\n\n\tShelby decides to speak to Quinn and Puck in private and she expresses her interest in having Quinn be a part of Beth's life.  This way, Quinn won't feel the same way as she did when she gave up Rachel at a young age.  Quinn feels like this is simply a way of tormenting her; since she's the birth mother she deserves to see the baby regardless.  Shelby says it won't happen until she cleans up her act, however.\rAt Booty Camp, Mike begins teaching his pupils the grapevine while Kurt and Blaine discuss the upcoming auditions for \"West Side Story\".  Both are eager to audition for Tony, the male lead, and it's clear that Kurt is a bit worried that his boyfriend will be an ideal choice for the role over himself.  Blaine says he'd be happy with any role opposite Kurt's and that perhaps it's best a Senior take the lead role anyways. \n"}, {"text": "During the filming of Sue's campaign video, does Will apologize to Quinn for her treatment in Glee Club?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tShelby steps in on Rachel's rehearsal for the school play and Rachel is clearly set aback by the arrival.  Shelby suggests that they don't need to take things so quickly and recommends that she sing \"Somewhere\" since it'd be ideal for her and because she needs to break out a little to get what she wants.  Playing it safe would be too easy.  The number soon evolves into a duet between Rachel and her mother.  The audition she provides for Artie, Emma, and Beiste is no less than stellar.\rSue's video begins filming and during one pivotal moment, she has Quinn enter Will's office to express her disinterest in the arts and her hatred towards Glee Club.  Will decides to tell her how he feels about her attitude, ungratefulness, and immaturity and suggests that she grow up because the New Directions have been nothing but friends to her.  She leaves the room and Sues says that (unfortunately) she got none of it on camera.\rPuck visits Shelby's apartment having claimed to have gotten his act together and, for the first time, he admits that he'd do anything to be in her life. \n"}, {"text": "Why are the school musical's co-directors hesitant about letting Kurt play the role of Tony?", "correct": "He's too effeminate", "options": ["He can't hit high-G", "He doesn't have a strong enough baritone", "He can't dance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's too effeminate.\n\n\tKurt steps up to the stage for his audition and while he says he'll be aiming for the role of Tony, he'll be using Barbra Streisand's \"I'm the Greatest Star\" from \"Funny Girl\" (with Rachel's written permission).\rIn the girls' bathroom, Puck speaks to Quinn to insult her new style and criticize her attitude.  She says that he doesn't really care about being with her anymore but he cares too much for Beth to let Quinn do what she's doing.\rBeiste, Emma, and Artie all discuss the roles so far and while they're currently on board for Rachel to play Maria, Beiste and Artie are all concerned that Kurt's a bit too effeminate to play Tony and he overhears this outside the guidance office window. \n"}, {"text": "To convince the co-directors that he can play the role he auditioned for, Kurt and Rachel enact a scene from which famous work?", "correct": "Romeo and Juliet", "options": ["Cats", "Grease", "The Phantom of the Opera"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRomeo and Juliet.\n\n\tKurt's a bit downtrodden because of the comments made about his audition.  Of course, when he heads through the halls he discovers that Santana and Brittany have been putting up the overtly-homosexual unicorn posters.  Brittany wants Kurt to embrace his specialness but Kurt simply doesn't want to go through with it for fear that it might hurt has chances at winning.  He tells her to take the posters down and he asks Rachel to help him re-audition for Tony.\rBrittany is hurt by Kurt's comments and her apparent failure but Santana says that she was a genius for her ideas and that perhaps she's the actual unicorn.\rIn the auditorium, Kurt and Rachel decide to perform a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet\" in order to prove that Kurt can take on the masculine Romeo role.  Unfortunately, while they're both successful in playing their roles, Kurt is still not believable as a strong, male actor. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Finn have a job?", "correct": "Burt's auto shop", "options": ["McDonald's", "Sheets 'n' Things", "Breadstix"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurt's auto shop.\n\n\tShelby has her first Glee Club meeting with Sugar Motta and finds herself quickly frustrated by the girl's lack of tone or pitch.  Sugar calls off the rest of the lesson to go home and watch \"My Strange Addiction\" since she's already too good for this Glee Club.  Quinn comes by after the lesson and Shelby says that she was just like Quinn after she gave up Rachel (only she had a Regis Philbin tattoo and a Sinead O'Connor haircut).  Shelby thinks that she needs to stop punishing herself and that she needs to find out who she really is.  Shelby allows Quinn to see a photo of Beth and she begins to cry.\rAt Burt's shop, Rachel tells Finn that she'll be in emotional DEFCON-1 until the results of the audition are posted and Finn discusses earning enough money from Burt's shop to go to college.  Rachel says that he should look towards his dreams since he's capable of doing more than staying in an auto shop.  Kurt also stops by the shop to talk to his dad about his effeminate nature and Burt says that rather than struggle for hunky, male roles in plays and movies he should fight to change the norm and write his own stuff that puts him first.  There's no point in him being something he's not. \n"}, {"text": "Who rejoins the New Directions in this episode?", "correct": "Quinn", "options": ["Santana", "Lauren", "Sam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn.\n\n\tAt Booty Camp, Finn struggles to make the moves but with encouragement from Will he's able to hit every step.  After their quick congratulations, Quinn appears in a white dress and with the pink taken out of her hair.  She says that she's a bit rusty and they welcome her back to Glee Club.  Puck says he's proud of her but she says that if all she needs to do is dye her hair and pretending to think she's special, she's willing to do it to get full custody.\rIn the teacher's lounge, Will tells Sue that Quinn is back in Glee Club and Sue is thrilled since it shows how her addictive personality is being gratified once more by the arts.  Sue also states that she's up 9% in the polls and she's in the lead.  Bieste, Emma, and Will decide that they need an anti-Sue to run against her.\rBrittany finds Kurt putting up the unicorn posters in the halls at school and he invites her over to his place.  While she's thrilled that he's embracing his awesomeness, she can't come over; she and Santana are making campaign posters for her own presidency campaign.\rIn the auditorium the co-directors sit in for Blaine's audition for the role of Bernardo or Officer Krupke.  After performing \"Something's Coming\" from \"West Side Story\", they ask if he'd like to read for the role of Tony instead.  Kurt watches from the balcony while Blaine struggles to respond. \n"}]}
