Online Trivia | Animals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "  Other Domestic Animals", "Goats"], "questions": [{"text": "Do goats really smell terrible? ", "correct": "The bucks in breeding season do! Pee-yew!", "options": ["No it's all a misconception.", "Yes, bucks and does both reek.", "Only if they aren't cared for properly!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bucks in breeding season do! Pee-yew!.\n\n\tBucks- male goats- smell because it's the caprine version of cologne and really turns the lady goats on. They acquire their distinctive aroma both from musk glands and from peeing on themselves. \r Does and neutered males- wethers- have no offensive smell. \n"}, {"text": "Yum! Tin cans! Are they really on a goat's menu?", "correct": "The cans- no- but the labels sure are!", "options": ["Never. Ew!", "You bet! Goats have cast-iron stomachs and can digest metal with ease.", "Only if they are mineral-deficient."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe cans- no- but the labels sure are!.\n\n\tGoats can digest cellulose because of friendly rumen bacteria that break it down for them. Paper is cellulose, and goats consider paper to be a tasty snack. Goats will peel the labels off cans and eat them- but the can itself is not a treat. \n"}, {"text": "Sheep are woolly and fluffy, goats are sleek and smooth. Is that really a good way to tell them apart?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAngora goats, for example, have wool and look like sheep, and Barbados blackbelly sheep are smooth-haired and look like goats. One way to tell them apart is the horns- it's the sheep that have the curly ones that look like snail shells. \n"}, {"text": "Goats are really man's best friend! What behavior do goats share with dogs?", "correct": "They wag their tails when they are happy", "options": ["They \"bark\" when something alarms them", "They like to retrieve things", "All of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey wag their tails when they are happy.\n\n\tJust try feeding a kid a bottle and watch that tail go- aaaaw, cute! \n"}, {"text": "I'm afraid I'm going to get goat flu! I visited some goats and they all were sneezing at me! What's going on?", "correct": "A sneeze is a goat's alarm call- you scared them!", "options": ["Goats are prone to respiratory illnesses but it won't make you sick.", "They want to make you sick! It's a plot for caprine domination of the world!", "Well, they must not have been goats then- they were really sheep!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA sneeze is a goat's alarm call- you scared them!.\n\n\tThe \"sneeze\" you hear is really a snort, and it's used as an alarm call. \n"}, {"text": "Look at the beard on that goat! Since it has a beard, I know that...", "correct": "it's really a goat and not a sheep", "options": ["it's a male goat", "none of these", "it's an old goat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nit's really a goat and not a sheep.\n\n\tBoth male and female goats can have beards, although those of the males are more luxurious. Only goats have beards- sheep don't. \n"}, {"text": "Goats make great pets, but you can't have just one...a single goat is usually miserable.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tGoats are herd animals. A single goat will be very lonely. Sometimes other animals. like horses or llamas, can be goat pals, but they prefer their own kind. \n"}, {"text": "Male goats really do, er, um...have a high libido. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed they do, as do most herd animals. The male with the greatest proclivity to consort with the ladies leaves the most offspring. Darwin would be proud. \n"}, {"text": "A lush grassy meadow provides ideal nutrition for a goat. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tGoats are mostly browsers. They will ignore the lush green grass to eat the dried leaves that fell from the apple tree. \n"}, {"text": "Ah, Spring! All of those cute little kids just love playing in the April showers and capering in the puddles! And the adults love a spot of rain as well. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tGoats hate, hate, hate getting wet. Even a hint of sprinkles sends them running for cover. They are desert animals, and they won't let you forget it! \n"}]}
