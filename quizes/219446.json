The origin of its name is somewhat mysterious; many claim that it got its name from the first letter of the last name of Leonhard, who first proved that the constant was irrational. What is this number, the base of the natural logarithm (ln)?", "correct": "e", "options": ["alpha", "pi", "N"], "explanation": "\n\n\ne.\n\n\tLeonhard Euler, a Swiss mathematician who did most of his work for the Russian Czars in St. Petersburg, lived from 1707 to 1783. A child prodigy, his productivity throughout his life was incredible, even during the last 17 years of his life when he was entirely blind (this was well before the invention of Braille). In fact, it took the St. Petersburg Academy 50 years after his death to prepare and release all of the work he had left unpublished!\r The number e, critical to any scientific discussion of oscillations or exponential growth or decay, is equal to 2.71828... Euler realized that this number was related to sine and cosine functions: e^(i x) = cos(x) + i sin(x). This formula leads to one that physicist Richard Feynman once called \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\": e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0, which relates the five most fundamental mathematical constants. \n"}, {"text": "Amedeo was an Italian chemist with a famous hypothesis and a famous number. He didn't actually determine the constant that's named after him, but he did predict it when he hypothesized that equal volumes of gas, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules. What constant, the number of atoms in a mole, is named after him?", "correct": "Avogadro's number", "options": ["the volta", "Moletto's number", "Faraday constant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvogadro's number.\n\n\tIt was Amedeo Avogadro's work that led to the definition of a mole as 6.022 x 10^23 molecules. Born in Turin in 1776, he became Count of Quaregna at the tender age of 11. He was trained as a lawyer but didn't like it and turned to Mathematical Physics instead. His brilliant and important idea, that gases are made up of a quantifiable number of atoms and molecules, was published in 1811 and ignored completely during his lifetime (he died in 1856). In the 1880s, however, Avogadro's memory was vindicated when Stanislao Cannizzaro used his work to create a table of atomic weights.Now his work has even led to a very minor holiday: many chemists, especially students anxious for a party, celebrate Mole Day on October 23. \n"}, {"text": "Michael, an English scientist of humble birth, made almost innumerable contributions to the science of electrodynamics: he invented electric motors, discovered electromagnetic induction, and basically paved the way for commercial electricity. The constant that carries his name is equal to the electrical charge of one mole of electrons. What is it?", "correct": "Faraday constant", "options": ["Planck's constant", "Rydberg constant", "Hubble constant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaraday constant.\n\n\tMichael Faraday (1791 - 1867) had little formal education; instead, he learned science during his apprenticeship to a bookbinder, consulting the very volumes he was binding. He won a job as a laboratory assistant through tenacity, charm, and the generosity of Sir Humphry Davy, then the President of the Royal Society, and soon made a name for himself with his brilliant experiments. In addition to his studies of conductors and magnetism, he discovered the chemical benzene and invented the system of oxidation numbers still used by chemists today. Famously humble, he declined both knighthood and the presidency of the Royal Society, and he had but three words of advice to aspiring chemist William Crookes: \"Work. Finish. Publish.\"\r The Faraday constant is approximately equal to 96,485 Coulombs per mole. \n"}, {"text": "Our next constant is named after two people, but it's the first who concerns us now. Jozef was the Slovenian son of a maidservant and a miller's assistant who made contributions to electrodynamics and thermodynamics, but his name is attached to a law of blackbody radiation: the energy emitted is directly proportional to the fourth power of the body's temperature. What is the name of the proportionality constant, represented by a lower-case sigma?", "correct": "Stefan-Boltzmann constant", "options": ["Rydberg-Bohr constant", "Fermi-Dirac constant", "Bose-Einstein constant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n\tThe Stefan-Boltzmann constant has the value 5.67 x 10^-8 Joules per second per area, per Kelvin to the inverse power of four. Stefan (1835-1893) formulated it as an empirical law; his student, Ludwig Boltzmann, derived it theoretically, so the law and constant bear both of their names.\r In his youth, Stefan seriously considered becoming a Benedictine monk, but his love for physics was too strong for him to go into the cloister. This was a fortunate decision for physics, because the Stefan-Boltzmann law paved the way for Max Planck's theory of quantized light -- which in turn was the beginning of quantum mechanics. \n"}, {"text": "Ludwig was an Austrian scientist, so famous that Emperor Franz Josef himself made him promise not to accept an academic appointment anywhere else. He made important contributions to the theory of statistical mechanics, including the definition of entropy S: S = k ln W, where W is the number of states available to the system and k is what constant named for its formulator?", "correct": "Boltzmann constant", "options": ["Planck's constant", "Rydberg constant", "Bohr constant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoltzmann constant.\n\n\tLudwig Boltzmann (1844-1906) made many other important contributions, including the derivation of Stefan's empirical (based on experiment) law for blackbody radiation (see Question 4). He basically derived all of statistical mechanics separately from Gibbs, and he was the first to recognize that entropy must always increase -- now known as the second law of thermodynamics. But other physicists doubted him, and this ate away at his self-confidence. Boltzmann, who likely suffered from bipolar disorder, hanged himself believing his life's work to be in ruins, unaware that the data that would vindicate him was even then being analyzed. His famous equation for entropy is engraved on his tombstone.\r The Boltzmann constant is equal to 1.38 x 10^-23 Joules per Kelvin. \n"}, {"text": "Max was advised against pursuing physics: \"In this field, almost everything is already discovered,\" a professor told him in 1874. Max proved him wrong with his theory of blackbody radiation in 1900. According to this theory, electromagnetic energy could only be emitted in quantized form. The energy of a photon is then equal to its frequency times what constant, named for Max?", "correct": "Planck's constant", "options": ["Hubble constant", "Boltzmann constant", "Faraday constant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlanck's constant.\n\n\tMax Planck's (1858-1947) naysaying professor was Philipp von Jolly. Planck's theory of blackbody radiation (which is, to a good approximation, the radiation of a star) is now considered to be the cornerstone of quantum mechanics; he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for it in 1918. A proud German physicist at a time when the great work in physics was all being done in Germany, he fought a losing one-man battle against the exile of Jewish physicists as the Nazis took power. For daring to teach the theories of Einstein, he was accused of being a \"white Jew\" by proponents of \"Aryan physics\" (whatever that was supposed to be), and the government investigated his racial background. His last surviving child, Erwin, was executed in 1945 for his participation in an assassination attempt on Hitler.\r The Planck constant is represented by h = 6.626 x 10^-34 Joule seconds. In quantum mechanics we often divide h by 2pi to get the useful quantity hbar (a lower-case h with a crossed stem). \n"}, {"text": "Janne, working at Lund University in Sweden, noticed an interesting pattern in the emission lines of the hydrogen spectrum. While many were trying to explain and predict the lines, it was Janne who in 1888 devised a simple formula: the inverse of the wavelength of each emission line is equal to a constant times (1/ni^2 - 1/nf^2), where ni < nf are integers. What is this constant, which is different for each element, called?", "correct": "Rydberg constant", "options": ["Bohr constant", "Planck's constant", "Boltzmann constant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRydberg constant.\n\n\tJohan \"Janne\" Rydberg (1854 - 1919) was first hired by Lund University as a docent in mathematics, but it was in physics that he made his mark. His formula allowed spectral lines to be related to each other as a predictable series; this is still a guiding principle of atomic physics today. Each emission line is due to photons emitted when an electron \"jumps\" from a higher-energy orbital to a lower-energy one, so each element has a distinct spectrum and a distinct Rydberg constant R. The Rydberg constant for hydrogen is equal to the energy of the ground state: -13.6 electron volts.\r Although his formula revolutionized atomic physics, Rydberg's colleagues were reluctant to laud his accomplishments because he wasn't enough of an experimentalist for their tastes; they trivialized his insight as simply being a rearrangement of other people's data. He lost a contentious tenure fight at Lund University and was denied membership in the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, although he was named a foreign member of the Royal Society of London a few months before his death of a brain hemorrhage. \n"}, {"text": "Niels was one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, although his model of the atom was more classical than not. In this theory, released in 1913, electrons traveled about the nucleus in distinct orbits which affected the atom's chemical properties. The radius of the innermost electron orbit is named after him; what is it?", "correct": "Bohr radius", "options": ["Planck radius", "Einstein radius", "Rydberg radius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBohr radius.\n\n\tNeils Bohr (1885 - 1962) was a Danish physicist who has gone into legend. The Bohr model of the atom, surprisingly accurate and still taught in chemistry classes before students are ready for the more accurate quantum model, was a major advance in the development of quantum physics. It was he who explained, using his model, the emission of photons that Rydberg had studied empirically (Question 7).\r Bohr's political views -- which basically boiled down to the idea that all scientific knowledge should be shared across borders -- became controversial during World War II, when Hitler was pushing his scientists to develop nuclear weapons. Werner Heisenberg visited Bohr to try to persuade him to join the project, a conversation that is the subject of Michael Frayn's acclaimed play \"Copenhagen\". Bohr wound up fleeing Denmark with the aid of the OSS, one step ahead of the German police, and did some minor work for the Manhattan Project.\r The Bohr radius, usually represented by a0, is roughly equal to 53 picometers. \n"}, {"text": "The next constant is not technically constant after all: it varies over very large time scales. This is, perhaps, to be expected of the number that describes the expansion of the universe! American astronomer Edwin realized that the speed of receding galaxies, as measured from their redshift, is directly related to their distance from us. What is the constant of proportionality, named after him?", "correct": "Hubble constant", "options": ["Chandrasekhar constant", "Faraday constant", "Shapley constant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHubble constant.\n\n\tEdwin Hubble (1889 - 1953) had his first taste of fame in high school, when he set an Illinois state record for the high jump (and won seven first-place prizes at a single track meet). His contributions to astronomy, however, proved longer-lasting. In 1924, he was the first to realize that the controversial \"fuzzy nebulae\" were actually other galaxies, and by 1929 he and Milton Humason had realized that the more distant galaxies were rapidly receding from our own. They formulated Hubble's law: v = H0 * d, where v is a galaxy's recessional velocity, d its distance from the Milky Way, and H0 the Hubble constant (71 kilometers per second per Megaparsec). This is an incredible result: the farthest galaxies are receding from us at the greatest speed! Thus, the first real evidence that our universe is expanding.\r Hubble also discovered the odd comet or two, formulated a classification scheme for galaxies based on their geometry, and lobbied extensively for astronomy to be considered a subfield of physics, so that astronomers could be recognized with Nobel Prizes. His campaign was successful but took too long: Hubble died just after the Nobel Committee had unanimously decided to honor him, but just before they could award him the prize. \n"}, {"text": "Subrahmanyan was one of the first to combine physics and astronomy. While traveling by ship from India to continue his education at Cambridge, he worked out a startling theory: stars above a certain mass cannot end their existence as white dwarf stars, but instead must continue collapsing, in modern terminology becoming either neutron stars or black holes. What is this mass limit, which won him the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics and which is equal to 1.44 solar masses?", "correct": "Chandrasekhar limit", "options": ["Raman limit", "Hubble limit", "Bohr limit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChandrasekhar limit.\n\n\tSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910 - 1995) was born in Lahore in what is now Pakistan, the son of a Brahmin family and the nephew of Nobel Physics laureate Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (who won the prize for his discovery of the Raman effect in the scattering of monochromatic light). In order to pursue his studies of physics he had to leave India, creating a cultural conflict that dominated his early years. Despite his arrival with his seminal white-dwarf theory in hand, his reception at Cambridge was less than warm, and after getting his PhD he left for the United States and the University of Chicago (eventually becoming a naturalized citizen).\r Nicknamed Chandra (Sanskrit for \"moon\" or \"luminous\"), his later work included fundamental theories of radiative transfer, fluid and plasma physics, gravitational theory and stellar evolution, and he was thus understandably upset that his Nobel prize made no mention of any work he had done after his early 20s. \n"}]}
