She only lived to the age of 36, but in her life, she was a very successful singer, actress, and model who will forever be remembered.\n\nWhat is the name of the actress that can be found by anagramming the capitalized phrase?", "correct": "Marilyn Monroe", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarilyn Monroe.\n\n\tMarilyn Monroe was born as Norma Jeane Mortensen in 1926, began her career as a model in 1945, and in later years she would have a very successful career as an actress and singer. Monroe was well-known for her unique figure as a model, and could possibly even be considered a plus-size model by today's standards. However, she was not a size 16 as some myths suggest. In fact, this legend is tricky to judge; sizes have changed since Monroe's time (sizes are now smaller than they once were), and her clothing was typically tailored to her shape and not given a specific size. In 2009, a fashion features editor by the name of Sara Buys was given the opportunity to try on some of Marilyn Monroe's clothes, and she stated that her outfits were a size 8, and perhaps a size 10 at her heaviest - a far cry from 16!\r Poor Marilyn has been at the center of many myths and lore. The fact that she once had a sixth toe has been proven completely false. A famous photo supposedly revealing the extra digit was simply some strange lighting and angling that created the bonus toe illusion. Another false legend is that Disney's Tinker Bell was modeled after her. Yet another popular myth revolves around Marilyn Monroe's death. Though her death (at the age of 36 in 1962) has not been officially accepted as such, many believe her death was actually a murder. True, IN LORE, MY NORMA is featured quite prominently. \n"}, {"text": "Some actors and actresses seem to fall in similar roles in all their movies, and a certain characteristic seems to connect itself to these actors. In this instance, the actor seems to always get killer roles such as Richard Riddick and Dominic Toretto. An autobiography of his film career could, then, be titled \"I END LIVES\".\n\nWhich actor, known for his tough guy roles, can be found in the scrambled capitalized phrase?", "correct": "Vin Diesel", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVin Diesel.\n\n\tVin Diesel was born as Mark Sinclair in 1967. He first began his acting career in 1990, but became known in 1998 when he appeared in \"Saving Private Ryan\". It is interesting how some actors play a certain type of character so well that it seems they always get that part. In the case of Vin Diesel, he plays the tough killers. In the \"Riddick\" series of film, Diesel plays the title character. He also portrays Dominic Toretto in the \"Fast and Furious\" series, and Xander Cage in \"xXx\". Even in family comedy films such as \"The Pacifier\" Vin Diesel always falls into the tough guy role. \n"}, {"text": "Having been knighted as Sir, this actor surely has GENUINE CLASS. In fact, an air of class seemed to follow him in all his roles: Obi-Wan, Yevgraf, and the like.\n\nWhich actor's name can quite fittingly be rearranged to genuine class?", "correct": "Alec Guinness & Sir Alec Guinness", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlec Guinness & Sir Alec Guinness.\n\n\tSir Alec Guinness de Cuffe was born in 1914, and in 2000, he died at the age of 86. This man of genuine class began his film career in 1934 as an uncredited extra, but it wasn't until 1946 that he had a major role in the film \"Great Expectations\". Though Alec Guinness had many well-known roles throughout his 60-year career, he is probably most known for his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. Interestingly, being labeled as Obi-Wan Kenobi did not quite appeal to Guinness. He originally played the part because of the movie's moral good, though he thought the film to be \"fairy tale rubbish\". When Obi-Wan Kenobi was killed off in a later film, it had actually been Guinness' idea. He had simply grown fed up with playing the part and asked George Lucas to kill off Obi-Wan Kenobi. The death of Obi-Wan Kenobi was twofold, however. Guinness also believed the character would grow stronger as a result of his death.\r Sadly, Sir Alec Guinness himself succumbed to death in 2000 when he passed away due to liver cancer. His wife of 62 years died of cancer only two months later. \n"}, {"text": "Some actors appear in so many films, it seems they can be seen ON ANY SCREEN you look at. Such is the case with this Scottish actor who appeared in countless films throughout his 50-year career. His most noted role came early in his career when he first played James Bond in 1962.\n\nWhat is the name of this great actor who is seen all mixed up 'on any screen'?", "correct": "Sean Connery", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Connery.\n\n\tSean Connery was born in 1930, and his first film was in 1954. In 1962, Connery appeared as James Bond in \"Dr. No\". He portrayed James Bond in several films throughout his career. Sean Connery played Indiana Jones' father in \"The Last Crusade\", but did not do so in the fourth installment of the series. He had retired by the time the fourth \"Indiana Jones\" film came out, and said retirement was too much fun to reprise his role. Even after his retirement, though, Sean Connery decided to do a few voice roles, including that of James Bond in a video game.\r Sean Connery has been called \"The Greatest Living Scot\", and in 1989 was named the \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by \"People\" magazine. Ten years later, the magazine named him the \"Sexiest Man of the Century\"; he was 69 at this time. \n"}, {"text": "This singer has been considered one of the greatest of all time, which is proven by his sales of over 100 million albums and singles. Besides his wonderful songs, such as \"Superstition\", he plays multiple instruments. What makes this child prodigy even more impressive is the fact that he ER, DOESN'T VIEW.\n\nWho is the inspirational blind singer who can be found in the anagram above?", "correct": "Stevie Wonder", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStevie Wonder.\n\n\tStevie Wonder was born as Stevland Hardaway Judkins in 1950. His career in the music industry is quite impressive. With over 30 number one US hits, 22 Grammy Awards, and 100 million albums and singles sold, it is by no stretch of the imagination that one can call Stevie Wonder one of the greatest singer/musicians in the music industry. In fact, in 2008, \"Billboard\" magazine listed Wonder at number five of the \"100 All-Time Top Artists\".\r Stevie Wonder also plays several instruments, which he learned young. He can play the keyboard, harmonica, drums, bass guitar, and others. This achievement is made more impressive and inspirational, in my opinion, due to his becoming blind shortly after birth. \n"}, {"text": "Whenever you are in the mood for some OLD WEST ACTION, you can never go wrong with watching movies directed by and/or starring one man in particular. As the Man with No Name in the \"Dollars\" trilogy and as Harry Callahan in the \"Dirty Harry\" series, this actor epitomizes the old west.\n\nWhat is the name of the man who can be found using the phrase in all capital letters?", "correct": "Clint Eastwood", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nClint Eastwood.\n\n\tClint Eastwood (born in 1930) first rose to prominence in the \"Dollars\" trilogy by playing the Man with No Name. The trilogy included the films \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964), \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965) and \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" (1966). He also starred in the \"Dirty Harry\" films that were released throughout the 70s and 80s. Eastwood also won Academy Awards for \"Unforgiven\" and \"Million Dollar Baby\", both of which won for Best Director and Best Picture. \n"}, {"text": "I've never personally met this actor so as to know how he introduces himself to people, but I can imagine he would say something like this: \"I, AN ARTIST, SO KNOWN AS BEAN, greet you.\"\n\nThe spookily accurate anagram above references the character Mr. Bean, who is portrayed by what actor?", "correct": "Rowan Sebastian Atkinson & Rowan Atkinson", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRowan Sebastian Atkinson & Rowan Atkinson.\n\n\tRowan Sebastian Atkinson was born in Consett, England in 1955. He has appeared in many successful films and television shows, including the series featuring Mr. Bean, and my personal favorite, \"Blackadder\". Atkinson is known for his deadpan delivery of strange and hilarious lines. He also over-articulates words, which has a comic effect. He does this, however, to avoid his stammer, especially with certain letters that give him the most trouble. For instance, in \"Blackadder the Third\" (1987), he puts emphasis on both the B's in 'Bob'.\r Of course, not all his characters are about language. While portraying Mr. Bean, Atkinson leaned more towards visual humor, as the antics of the character could be quite entertaining. Mr. Bean was retired in 2012, however, as Atkinson believed a man in his 50s should not be playing such a childish character. \n"}, {"text": "Not all television stars can be cool.

He had his first show in 1980; his morning show was called \"The David Letterman Show\", and it won two Emmy Awards.

The company also produced several sitcoms, including \"Everybody Loves Raymond\". \n"}, {"text": "This actress is known for many roles, though perhaps none are as known as Rachel Green from \"Friends\". As \"Men's Health\" magazine's \"Sexiest Woman of All Time\" (2011), it comes to no surprise that she looks FINE IN TORN JEANS, which she seemed to wear a lot of on \"Friends\".\n\nWhat actress has been anagrammed in the all-capital phrase above?", "correct": "Jennifer Aniston", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJennifer Aniston.\n\n\tJennifer Aniston (born in 1969) got her start in 1990 on \"Molloy\", and in 1993 she began her film career in \"Leprechaun\". It wasn't until 1994, however, that she really became known to much of the world, when she starred as Rachel Green on \"Friends\", which lasted until 2004. In 2010, she starred in \"The Switch\", which she also produced. Aniston is also a successful businesswoman, and has her own perfume scent.

SORRY, PAL, but he has been dead since 1977 when he was found on a bathroom floor. He had many number one hits during his career, including \"Love Me Tender\".\n\nThe urban legend of this singer faking his own death can be hinted at using the anagram of his name as seen above. What is the name of this man?", "correct": "Elvis Aaron Presley & Elvis Presley & Elvis Aron Presley", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nElvis Aaron Presley & Elvis Presley & Elvis Aron Presley.\n\n\tElvis Aaron (misspelled as Aron on his birth certificate) Presley was born in 1935 and died at 42 in 1977. His death has been suspected to have been caused by a drug overdose along with existing medical conditions (though these conditions were possibly caused by drugs). He fell and hit his head on the toilet after taking too many drugs. Some people, however, did not believe he had actually died. Many speculated, even 35 years later, that he had faked his own death in order to retire from his career peacefully. It has been thought that the original casket contained a wax figure of Elvis.\r In his career, Elvis Presley was wildly successful. He released a plethora of albums, twenty of which reached number one, between 1956 and 2007 (two of these albums were posthumous). These albums included over 35 number one singles, including hits like \"Love Me Tender\" and \"Jailhouse Rock\". He also had quite the career in the film industry. Many of his films contained his more popular songs (such as \"Love Me Tender\" and \"Jailhouse Rock\"). \n"}]}
