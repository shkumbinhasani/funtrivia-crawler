{"id": "265570", "name": "Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" Quiz | Authors | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors L-P", " Larry Niven"], "questions": [{"text": "Let's begin with the not-so-fearless leader of this exploratory expedition, an alien known as a Pierson's puppeteer. Nessus's ability to take risks is enough to make him insane in the eyes of his notoriously cautious people, but that doesn't mean they don't have a job for him. What is he promised in exchange for leading a mission to the Ringworld?", "correct": "The ability to have children", "options": ["Incalculable riches", "A certificate of sanity", "A ticket off the puppeteer world"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe ability to have children.\n\n\tThe Pierson's puppeteer species -- tri-pedal organisms with a pair of heads on long stalks -- vanished from known space centuries before this book takes place. Now, however, they're drawn back -- or rather, one of them is. \"Your whole ethical system is based on cowardice,\" one character observes about them, but sometimes a risk must be taken to benefit the entire species -- and, the Hindmost (the puppeteer leader) judges, the investigation of the Ringworld is just such a task.No sane puppeteer would be willing to do it, and even Nessus -- a lunatic by puppeteer standards, and a coward by human ones -- quails at the dangers involved. Only the utmost prize -- being permitted to have children -- drives him forward. \n"}, {"text": "Nessus's first recruit is a human from Earth, Louis Wu, the viewpoint character of the book. The book opens with Louis's celebration of a milestone birthday, and his musings on an increasingly boring life. How old is he?", "correct": "200", "options": ["50", "100", "75"], "explanation": "\n\n\n200.\n\n\tWith the aid of a miracle drug called boosterspice, humanity has finally been able to achieve the long lifespans it has so long dreamed of -- but the reality often falls far short of the dream. Louis Wu grows bored of the sameness of life on an earth interconnected by instantaneous transfer booths, and bored of the sameness of conversations with those who have been his friends for decades. The book opens on his 200th birthday, after he has left his birthday party and headed west, extending his day one hour at a time, dreaming all the while of taking a sabbatical and getting away from people. \n"}, {"text": "The third member of the crew also joins on Earth, but he is no Earthling. Speaker-to-Animals is a diplomat from a world that has pursued several disastrous (for them) wars with the humans; now they are trying their hands at peace. What is the name of his species, which resembles eight-foot-tall bipedal tigers?", "correct": "Kzin", "options": ["Outsider", "Slaver", "Kdatlyno"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKzin.\n\n\tKzinti (the plural of Kzin) are fearsome, sentient predators who were busy taking the universe by storm when they encountered the human race. Although psychoengineering had made humanity almost entirely pacifist, the first human ship attacked by the Kzinti managed to turn its propulsion system into a deadly weapon, marking the first victory of the Man-Kzin Wars. Beginning in the Larry Niven short story \"The Warriors\" (1966) and continuing over several anthologies by different authors, these wars resulted in a cowed and defeated Kzin race, deferent to the hegemony of man. \"We know what happens when we fight,\" says one kzinti diplomat. \"Today our numbers are less than an eighth of what they were when kzin first met man. Our colony worlds are your colony worlds, our slave species are freed ... when we must apologize or fight, it is my function to apologize.\"\r Speaker-To-Animals is a proud member of a defeated species, anxious for personal honor (and the corresponding right to take a name for himself, rather than calling himself by his occupation). Intelligent and resourceful, he is nonetheless a dangerous member of the team, anxious for any opportunity to take command -- and, just possibly, to seize sole ownership of the prize. \n"}, {"text": "Teela Brown, another human, is the last member to join. She's young (only 20 years old) and has led an unusually painless existence. Nessus wants her to join the crew because he believes that she has been bred for luck. How?", "correct": "For five generations running, only global Birthright Lottery wins allowed her ancestors to be born.", "options": ["For six generations running, each of her ancestors had a narrow escape from violent accidental death.", "For seven generations running, her ancestors lived on space stations, where a single moment of bad luck could have doomed the whole crew.", "For two generations running, only state lottery wins allowed her ancestors to afford parenting licenses."], "explanation": "\n\n\nFor five generations running, only global Birthright Lottery wins allowed her ancestors to be born.\n\n\tThe right to have children is strictly controlled on the Earth of Louis Wu and Teela Brown; it has to be, with some eighteen billion people inhabiting the planet! The colony worlds don't really relieve the population pressure; only the Fertility Board can. Each person has the right to parent one child; for subsequent children, that right must be earned -- by cash, by proven survival traits, by single combat, or by the Lottery. \r \"For the past two centuries,\" Nessus explains, \"between ten and thirteen percent of each human generation has been born by right of a winning lottery ticket. What determines who will survive and breed? On Earth, luck. And Teela Brown is the daughter of six generations of winning gamblers...\" \n"}, {"text": "Of course, none of our adventurers volunteer for the trip out of a sense of excitement. Teela goes because she's fallen in love with Louis, and he's going. Nessus offers Louis and Speaker an unspeakably valuable prize for their service. What is it?", "correct": "An innovative ship that takes only 1 minute and 15 seconds to travel an entire light year", "options": ["A library containing the sum of puppeteer knowledge", "Citizenship with the puppeteers", "A puppeteer doctor to train each world in the latest surgical techniques."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn innovative ship that takes only 1 minute and 15 seconds to travel an entire light year.\n\n\t\"If my mission is successful,\" Nessus tells Louis, \"I plan to turn the ship over to my crew, with blueprints with which to build more. The ship, then, is your ... fee, salary, what have you.\" This prize is more than just useful, however: it's vital to the survival of their species. Ten thousand years previously, a star in the dense core of the Milky Way galaxy had gone nova, setting off a chain reaction -- \"the Core explosion.\" In another twenty thousand years, the radiation from this cataclysmic event will reach known space and destroy every biological organism in its path.Ever try to evacuate tens of trillions of sentient beings to another galaxy? Louis and Speaker know that their species need the fastest, best ships they can get. \n"}, {"text": "In addition to the main prize, Louis asks to know the location of the puppeteer homeworld as the price of joining the crew. Nessus agrees (suspiciously quickly) to show it to him. Where is it?", "correct": "En route out of the galaxy", "options": ["On the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth", "At the galactic core", "Only three light-years from the Kzin homeworld"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEn route out of the galaxy.\n\n\t\"You will find the information more surprising than useful,\" warns Nessus, but Louis -- knowing that humanity had spent hundreds of years fruitlessly seeking this homeworld -- persists. Our intrepid crew visits the homeworld on their way to the Ringworld -- but the homeworld is not attached to a star. In their flight from the Core explosion, the puppeteers are moving their entire homeworld, in addition to four agricultural planets to supply them with food.Arranged at the five points of a regular pentagon, in a stable gravitational pattern called a Kemplerer rosette, these planets are on their way out of the galaxy.Artificial suns circle each farming world; the homeworld \"glow[s] by its own light, in patches the shapes of continents and the colors of sunlight.\" Louis Wu vows, not for the first time, to live forever, so that he can see all the wonders of the universe. \n"}, {"text": "As the journey begins, Speaker attempts a coup, hoping to abscond to his people with the prize. How does Nessus maintain command?", "correct": "Using a device called a tasp, he stimulates the pleasure centers of Speaker's brain.", "options": ["He creates a distraction until Louis and Teela are able to subdue Speaker.", "He cuts the oxygen levels to the ship's cabin.", "He threatens Speaker with a fearsome weapon -- a Slaver disintegrator."], "explanation": "\n\n\nUsing a device called a tasp, he stimulates the pleasure centers of Speaker's brain.\n\n\tA Slaver disintegrator would destroy everyone inside the ship, and any effort by two humans to subdue a full-grown kzin in hand-to-hand combat is similarly doomed to failure. Nessus has a far subtler weapon: the tasp, which feels so good that a being can easily become addicted to it, which is a terrifying thought for one as sophisticated and dignified as Speaker-To-Animals.\r \"The puppeteer is quite right,\" Speaker admits, having been disarmed while distracted by the tasp. \"I would not risk the tasp again. Too many jolts ... would leave me his willing slave. I, a kzin, slaved to an herbivore!\" \n"}, {"text": "When our heroes arrive at the Ringworld, they begin by making careful observations to better understand who and what they're dealing with. Unfortunately, this research period is abruptly ended when they are forced to crash land on the surface. Why?", "correct": "They are shot down by the Ringworld's automated defenses.", "options": ["They are shot down by a manned warship from the Ringworld.", "A powerful solar flare causes a critical systems failure.", "Teela accidentally breaks the main fuel line, causing their precious fuel to vent to space."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are shot down by the Ringworld's automated defenses.\n\n\tIts path mistaken for that of a dangerous meteor, the ship is attacked with x-ray lasers. These vaporize the wing of the ship, which contained landing gear, communications equipment, thrusters, and sensors; only the General Products hull, impervious to all electromagnetic radiation, protects the crew, their hyperdrive, and their life support system.Forced to fall in the direction their ship was originally aimed, the crew must prepare for an impact on the Ringworld itself. A stasis field protects them physically from the force of the crash, but now they are stranded on the surface of a strange world, built by an unknown species of unimaginable power. \n"}, {"text": "Trapped on the Ringworld surface, our crew must interact with the natives if they are to have any hope of lifting off again. Which of these is the best description of the majority of the native Ringworld population?", "correct": "Humanoids at a low technological level", "options": ["Kzinti at a low technological level", "Never-before-seen aliens with control of incredibly futuristic technology", "Humanoids with control of incredibly futuristic technology"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHumanoids at a low technological level.\n\n\tEvidence of the Ringworld civilization is everywhere -- in the crumbling cities, in the spaceport at the edge of the ring, and not least in the engineering marvel of the Ringworld itself. Our crew even encounters a survivor of the original Ringworld civilization, Halrloprillalar, although she herself can give only a fractured narrative of the disaster. A microorganism ate the superconductors that powered the cities, and the rest was silence.\r The descendants of the survivors live at an Iron Age level, forming isolated cultural and linguistic groups and worshipping reminders of the original Ringworld Engineers, a bald and vanished group. There will be more on them in later Ringworld books! \n"}, {"text": "A crucial insight finally allows our crew to get spaceborne again -- but they leave one member behind. Who stays on the Ringworld with the companionship of a native?", "correct": "Teela", "options": ["Nessus", "Louis", "Speaker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeela.\n\n\tSeparated for some weeks from her companions, distraught and stuck with a broken flycycle, Teela Brown finds comfort with a half-Engineer Ringworld native, Seeker. \"[He] was so blatantly type-cast that [Louis] burst out laughing ... He was a hero. You could tell. You didn't need to see him fighting dragons. You need only see the muscles, the height, the black metal sword ...\" Seeker is on a quest to walk to the base of the Arch -- not realizing that the Arch is merely the other half of the Ringworld, and that it has no base at all. Teela falls in love with him, and follows him, at least for now; this is where her luck wants her to be. \r Louis, meanwhile, works out a brilliant way to get the ship off the Ringworld and back home -- but for that, you'll have to read this excellent book for yourself! \n"}]}
