{"id": "266199", "name": "Where in \"Twilight Princess'\" Hyrule Are We? Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "Where in Hyrule are we if we're on the top of the Isle of Riches?", "correct": "Lake Hylia", "options": ["The Great Hylian Bridge", "Zora's River", "Death Mountain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLake Hylia.\n\n\tThe Isle of Riches is next to Fyer's cannon hut on the water of Lake Hylia.  In order to get onto the platforms of the Isle, we'll need to start at Falbi's Hut, overlooking the lake.  From here, we need to grab onto a Cucco and flutter down to it.  One way of doing this is following the right path that loops around to the island.  On the top a spinning platform holds a perched Heart Piece.  As we go down each platform, we can collect Rupees, and even a Poe Soul.  To get back to Falbi's we can easily take a ride in Fyer's Hut, though we'll have to pay a price for the quick method. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're fighting Puppets?", "correct": "Sacred Woods", "options": ["Hyrule Field", "Faron Woods", "Temple of Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSacred Woods.\n\n\tThe Sacred Woods are located in a small part of the Faron Woods, just behind the Forest Temple, and to reach it, we either need to navigate the treetops, or we need to use Rusl's golden Cucco to jump across platforms.  In this area, we'll need to defeat the Skull Kid to gain access to the Sacred Grove, and the home of the Master Sword and Temple of Time.  However, the Skull Kid will make the Sacred Grove difficult for us to navigate, and we will need to fight off his Puppets the entire time. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're talking to Renado?", "correct": "Kakariko Village", "options": ["Lanyaru Province", "Arbiter's Grounds", "Ordon Ranch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKakariko Village.\n\n\tRenado is the elder of the village at the base of Death Mountain, and he's the one that is taking care of the Ordon Village kids after they are taken into the twilight by the Bulblin.  We'll find through some conversations that Telma has an attraction to this man.  We must visit Renado more than once in the game as Kakariko Village is home to important plot points involving the children, Prince Ralis, and Ilia. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're learning how to Jump Slice?", "correct": "Snowpeak Mountain", "options": ["Faron Woods", "Lake Hylia", "The Bridge of Eldin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnowpeak Mountain.\n\n\tThe Jump Slice, chronologically, is the sixth and penultimate Hidden Skill that we can learn in the game, and it can be found on the side of Snowpeak Mountain before we reach Yeto and the peak.  Snowpeak is the last province that we will visit in the game to complete our world map, and it's one of the more foreboding due to its icy tundra and snowy landscape.  It's also where we visit the fifth temple, Snowpeak Ruins. \n"}, {"text": "Where in Hyrule could we possibly be if we're talking to Jaggle, Pergie, Bo, or Sera?", "correct": "Ordon Village", "options": ["Kakariko Village", "Hyrule Castle Town", "Hyrule Field"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrdon Village.\n\n\tThe characters listed in the question are all characters that we can meet in the opening parts of the game.  Jaggle and Pergie are Talo and Malo's parents who own the house on the river that cuts through town (the one with the dock).  Bo is the mayor of Ordon Village, who is also Ilia's father.  He gives us the Iron Boots after a sumo challenge in his house.  This allows us to climb Death Mountain and defeat the Gorons that stand in our way.  Sera owns Sera's Sundries, where we buy our Slingshot early in the game. \n"}, {"text": "Where would we happen to be if we were obtaining the Ancient Sky Book?", "correct": "Hidden Village", "options": ["Kakariko Village", "City in the Sky", "Temple of Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHidden Village.\n\n\tThe Hidden Village is a lot less hidden when we've finished the Temple of Time and claimed our Dominion Rod.  We need to jog Ilia's memory and head north through Hyrule Field's western edges to find the opening to the Hidden Village where Darbus will be breaking down a rock wall.  Here, we need to fight off the Bulblin to reach Impaz, who is the last remaining member of her tribe.  When you remind her of Ilia, and show her the Dominion Rod we'll get the Ancient Sky Book, which will ultimately power up the Rod and let us gain entry to the City in the Sky. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're visiting Mother and Child Rocks?", "correct": "Zora's Domain", "options": ["Gerudo Mesa", "The Fishing Hole (Zora's River)", "Hyrule Field"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZora's Domain.\n\n\tMother and Child Rocks is the centerpiece in Zora's Domain, and when the entire area is covered in ice, we need to climb it to reach the Royal Chamber.  These Rocks are also the home to the Reekfish, which we need to catch and memorize the scent of before we can advance to the Snowpeak Ruins to the northeast.  \rThe name 'Mother and Child' can also be found in \"Wind Waker\".  Mother and Child Isles is where players can find the Ice and Fire Arrows as well as a Goron trader. \n"}, {"text": "Holy Leaping Armos!  Where could we be if we're entering the Cave of Ordeals?", "correct": "Gerudo Mesa", "options": ["Sacred Grove", "Snowpeak Mountain", "None of these areas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGerudo Mesa.\n\n\tThe Cave of Ordeals should not be attempted until later in the game due to the foes that reside within.  It's the ultimate test for players in terms of combat as it features enemies that must be fought throughout the game.  At the very end, in the fiftieth chamber, we can meet the Great Fairy, who will give us a reward for banishing the baddies.  We can reach the Gerudo Mesa for the first time by asking Fyer to shoot us over the hills around Lake Hylia in his cannon. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're stealing Lantern Oil?", "correct": "Faron Woods", "options": ["Gerudo Mesa", "The Great Hylian Bridge", "Ordon Ranch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaron Woods.\n\n\tThe only place where we can steal anything in this game is at Trill's shop outside the Forest Temple in Faron Woods.  Here, if we have an empty bottle, we can fill it up with Lantern Oil or Red Potion.  Trill bases his entire shop on the honour system, and it's up to us if we want to abuse this.  We can get away without paying anything, of course, but if we pay too little and return to the shop, he'll fight for what's rightfully his.  How does a bird come across Lantern Oil anyways?! \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're talking to Gengle?", "correct": "Hyrule Castle Town", "options": ["Kakariko Village", "Lake Hylia", "Zora's River"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyrule Castle Town.\n\n\tGengle is Jovani's cat, who, after we first discover them, is turned into jewels and money after a curse is placed on them.  In order to return Jovani and Gengle to their regular human and cat forms, we need to collect all of the Poe Sould (sixty in total) from around Hyrule.  Though this may be time-consuming, it's well worth it.  Every time we visit in Hyrule Castle Town, he'll fill up our wallet, no matter how many Rupees it takes.  Gengle is also the leader of the pack of felines that play outside Jovani's house. \n"}]}
