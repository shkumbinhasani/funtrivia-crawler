Included in the cast were a doctor, several criminals, a Korean couple, an Australian rock star, and a pregnant woman.  And that's just some of the people who were in the pilot!  What J.J. Abrams-produced drama was this?", "correct": "LOST", "options": ["Fringe", "Alias", "Alcatraz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLOST.\n\n\tFirst envisioned as a miniseries for U.S. network ABC, \"LOST\" was originally meant to star Michael Keaton but as it grew to become a full series and began to flesh out its long, winding stories, it took on Matthew Fox in the lead role of Jack Shephard as well as Evangeline Lilly, Josh Holloway, Terry O'Quinn, Dominic Monaghan, Harold Perrineau, and on and on and on.  By the time the cast rounded out in season six, dozens and dozens of characters had joined the world of the show (which was mostly set on a 'deserted' island).  By the end of the series, most of them were dead. Due to the cost of the cast and the filming in Hawaii, it was one of the most expensive TV shows ever produced. \n"}, {"text": "Paging Dr. Carter...and Dr. Ross...and Dr. Greene...\nThe amount of doctors inducted into the staff on this show (set in a Chicago hospital) rose every year of its fifteen season run in the U.S. (on NBC).

The original cast included Anthony Edwards, George Clooney, Sherry Stringfield, Noah Wyle, Eriq La Salle, and Julianna Margulies. Over the years, the cast was joined by famous faces including Maria Bello, Ming-Na, Mekhi Phifer, Shane West, Linda Cardellini, and John Stamos.  Most of the original cast left the show to pursue movie careers (Clooney was certainly successful) while others became popular many years after the show concluded (Margulies won awards for \"The Good Wife\"). \n"}, {"text": "A main cast, most of whom had unique superpowers, lived, died, saved the cheerleader, and saved the world in four seasons.  Starring Ali Larter, Greg Grunberg, Adrian Pasdar, Zachary Quinto, and others, what show aired from 2006-2010?", "correct": "Heroes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeroes.\n\n\t\"Heroes\" was critically acclaimed in its first season due to a strong showing from its main cast and an immersive plot comprised of several intertwining storylines.  When the show progressed, adding several new characters and killing the older ones off, it started to fall out of favour and fast.  When the writer's strike hit, nearly halving the second season, the show couldn't recover. It ended in its fourth season.  Most of the actors, more popular from their appearances on \"Heroes\", found work fast (Quinto, for example, starred in the \"Star Trek\" reboot film and \"American Horror Story\" while Hayden Panettiere took a film career).  Creator Tim Kring created \"Touch\" for FOX in 2012. \n"}, {"text": "Who are you?  Are you like Nick Stokes (played by George Eads)?  How about Sara Sidle (played by Jorja Fox)?

Zuiker, started airing in 2000 and ended up continuing for several hundred episodes with several additions to the main cast.  Originally led by William Petersen (as Grissom) and Marg Helgenberger (as Willows), the show has taken many twists and turns over the years; when these actors departed their roles were filled by several major stars including Laurence Fishburne, Ted Danson, and Elisabeth Shue.  The \"CSI\" franchise has been popular enough to spawn spin-offs set in Miami and New York as well. \n"}, {"text": "Vampires?  Werewolves?  Fairies?

Following the Gallagher family and their rowdy exploits in Chicago, the show became a success for the network and, like the original version, didn't hold back on its shocking nature. \n"}, {"text": "A cast of former Broadway stars, comedians, and twenty-somethings posing as teenagers hit the FOX network with a hit show featuring musical numbers.

The show followed a group of people from the southeastern United States fighting for their lives in a zombie apocalypse.  A notable part of the show is the fact that none of the cast members would ever be safe; many main cast members have come and gone quickly due to the temperamental nature of the series. \n"}, {"text": "Topher Grace, Laura Prepon, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, and others played a group of teen friends living their lives in Point Place, Wisconsin.

Many of the episodes featured seemingly outlandish, yet nevertheless hilarious plots revolving around the cast of the show and the writers group.  Due to the show's ties with NBC, it accumulated a huge number of movie and TV stars who appeared in cameos and larger arcs.  Despite low ratings, the show was kept on by NBC until its seventh season and all of the original cast members stayed involved. \n"}]}
