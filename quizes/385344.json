Charming Jones (Ann-Margret) was being protected by Handsome Stranger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) while Cactus Jack (Kirk Douglas) attempted to rob her, wearing disguises and setting traps at various places.

Starting out as a normal Western involving a hired army trying to grab land, the movie became more odd as it progressed.  Filmed during the real life Contra War, the story involved American multimillionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt (Peter Boyle) hiring Walker to secure rights to overland shipping between the Atlantic and Pacific by taking over the government of Nicaragua. There seemed to be comparisons between the past and present Nicaragua as anachronisms popped up, including people reading 1980s magazines, helicopters, lighters, automatic rifles, a car passing a horse carriage, etc. Of course, Ed Harris has appeared in various movies (\"Stepmom\", \"The Right Stuff\").  He played as Hank Blaine in \"Creepshow\". \n"}, {"text": "In which movie did Leslie Nielsen play Col.

It was because Rance Roden (Don Lamond) wanted the American Indians to get angry so they would kill the settlers and Rance could take over the land.  He also sold weapons to Chief Crazy Horse. Rance hired just about every famous Western character to drive Cabot out of town, including Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, Belle Starr, Bat Masterson, etc.  However, Annie Oakley (Nancy Kovack) liked Cabot and helped him.

He was brought to town and prepared for hanging, until Julia Tate (Mary Steenburgen) said she would marry him. There was a local law that said if a local woman married a criminal, he wouldn't be executed. (This sounds insane.)  She needed a man to help her in the mine.  Of course, Jack Nicholson played Jack Torrence in \"The Shining\" (1980) and the Joker in \"Batman\" (1989).  He appeared in many movies, including \"Easy Rider\", \"Chinatown\", and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". \n"}, {"text": "In which movie did Don Knotts play a dentist who fought criminals?", "correct": "The Shakiest Gun in the West", "options": ["Lights Out at Alcatraz", "Challenge of the Herculareans", "She-Devil of Death Valley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Shakiest Gun in the West.\n\n\tJesse Haywood (Don Knotts) graduated from dental school in Philadelphia in 1870 and decided to become a frontier dentist.

Pa Danby (Walter Brennan) expected the new sheriff to release his son Joe, but the new sheriff wasn't scared of Danby like everyone else was.  Pa Danby hired various gunslingers to kill Sheriff McCullough, but the sheriff outdrew them.  One day a gunslinger showed up to challenge the sheriff just before lunch. The sheriff complained that killing a man before lunch spoiled his appetite, so he threw rocks at the gunslinger and chased him out of town.
