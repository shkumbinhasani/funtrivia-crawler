Chabert arrives unintimidated, and Derville hears his story. \n"}, {"text": "Why is Derville surprised to hear this man introduce himself as Colonel Chabert?", "correct": "The famous Colonel Chabert had died at the Battle of Eylau", "options": ["He knew Colonel Chabert. Colonel Chabert was a friend of his. And this, sir, is no Colonel Chabert.", "The famous Colonel Chabert had been exiled with Napoleon", "At the man's age, Derville would have expected him to be at least a major general"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe famous Colonel Chabert had died at the Battle of Eylau.\n\n\tChabert, the hero of Eylau and pet of Napoleon, had devised the strategy for the cavalry charge that enabled the French to escape defeat. Dozens of people, however, had seen him fall with a saber wound to the head, and Napoleon's own doctors had declared him dead. In reality he was only stunned and sick, and the doctors had examined him only perfunctorily; Chabert dug himself out of a mass grave of soldiers and was saved by a Prussian couple. \n"}, {"text": "What is Colonel Chabert's problem?", "correct": "His wife, now the Comtesse Ferraud, has his fortune and won't acknowledge his existence.", "options": ["An old battle injury has him in constant pain.", "New recruits are weak and lily-livered compared to the men Chabert used to command.", "His wife, now the Comtesse Ferraud, won't let him see his children."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis wife, now the Comtesse Ferraud, has his fortune and won't acknowledge his existence.\n\n\tHis wife, declared a widow by Napoleon and given Chabert's pension, used the fortune left her to marry a Count and gain impressive social standing. When her first husband turns up alive, she is frightened that he will destroy her new marriage -- and so she accuses him of being an impostor and refuses to part with any of the fortune he had made. Chabert, once Napoleon's right hand, thus lives in abject poverty. \n"}, {"text": "What is the Comtesse Ferraud's problem?", "correct": "The Comte Ferraud can achieve his political goals only by divorcing her.", "options": ["A shortage of labor has made her massive real estate holdings depreciate in value.", "The Comte Ferraud no longer loves her.", "She faces treason charges for having been a part of Napoleon's court."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Comte Ferraud can achieve his political goals only by divorcing her.\n\n\tThe Comte Ferraud wants, above all else, to be a peer of France. Although his Comtesse is fabulously wealthy, she is of low birth and cannot offer him the political connections he needs for a peerage. On the other hand, if he divorces her he can marry one of the daughters of a peer -- and eventually inherit his father-in-law's position. \n"}, {"text": "How does Colonel Chabert propose to solve his problem?", "correct": "By suing the Comtesse Ferraud.", "options": ["By petitioning the King for stricter boot camps.", "By seeing the Comtesse's brilliant surgeon.", "By weeping piteously outside the Comtesse's window."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy suing the Comtesse Ferraud.\n\n\tAlthough his best witness -- his old quartermaster Boutin -- is dead at Waterloo, Chabert feels he can win a lawsuit with the aid of some papers from Germany. He intends to win back his fortune and humiliate his wife for having abandoned him. Derville, however, points out that the Ferrauds have powerful connections with the judges of France, and that Chabert's share of the fortune has already been distributed according to his will. Chabert, therefore, agrees to try for a compromise, outside the courts. \n"}, {"text": "How does the Comtesse Ferraud propose to solve her problem?", "correct": "By ensuring that the Comte doesn't know he has grounds for divorce.", "options": ["By encouraging her laborers to have more children.", "By floating high-risk bonds.", "By arguing that although her first husband was close to Napoleon, she had actually been spying for the monarchy and was not a traitor."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy ensuring that the Comte doesn't know he has grounds for divorce.\n\n\tThe Comtesse believes that if her husband isn't given a good, non-political reason to divorce her, he won't. This is why she goes to such lengths to cover up her first husband's existence once she learns that he is alive and that she is a bigamist; she must also conceal her past as a prostitute. She is willing to reach an agreement with Chabert and Derville so that Chabert will not reveal himself to her husband. \n"}, {"text": "As he goes to meet with the Comtesse Ferraud, what does Chabert want above all else?", "correct": "To regain his name in all its honor.", "options": ["To regain his fortune.", "To regain his health.", "To regain his wife."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo regain his name in all its honor.\n\n\tAlthough he certainly wants the other three goals, the most important thing to Chabert is that he be able, once again, to honorably use the name he had built up from his childhood in an orphanage.
