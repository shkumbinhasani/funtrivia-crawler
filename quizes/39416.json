How many died for Laman's sin?... They called them savages. The fools said they could be swept aside like rubbish. How many battles lost, how many cities burned, before they faced the truth? Before the nations stood together against them?'", "correct": "Tam", "options": ["Lan", "Moiraine", "Siuan Sanche"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTam.\n\n\tAs he is gripped by fever, Tam unconsciously relates his experience fighting in the Aiel War. \n"}, {"text": "'Their King was Aemon al Caar al Thorin, Aemon son of Caar son of Thorin, and Eldrene ay Ellan ay Carlan was his Queen. Aemon, a man so fearless that that the greatest compliment for courage any could give, even among his enemies, was to say a man had Aemon's heart. Eldrene, so beautiful that it was said the flowers bloomed to make her smile. Bravery and beauty and wisdom and a love that death could not sunder.

They think that maybe -maybe- we are what we say. And maybe there's a trick in our words. Perhaps we are only Elaida's hand, weaving some elaborate scheme. Doubt leaves people floundering. Doubt gave Pelivar and Arathelle the nerve to stand before Aes Sedai and say, 'You cannot go further.' Who else will stand in our way, or interfere, because they aren't certain, and uncertainty leads them to act in a cloud of confusion? There's only one way for us to dispel their confusion. We have already done everything else. Once we declare ourselves at war with Elaida, there can be no doubts. I don't say that Arathelle and Pelivar and Aemlyn will march away as soon as we do, but they and everyone else will know who we are. No one will dare again to show doubt so openly when you say you are the Hall of the Tower. No one will dare stand in our way, meddling in the affairs of the Tower through uncertainty and ignorance. We have walked to the door and put our hands on the latch. If you are afraid to walk through, then you all but ask the world to believe you are nothing but Elaida's puppets.'", "correct": "Egwene", "options": ["Moiraine", "Sheriam", "Siuan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEgwene.\n\n\tAbout declaring war on Elaida. \n"}, {"text": "'There are no clear paths.
