{"id": "115419", "name": "Thomas Edison - Inventor Extraordinaire Quiz | People | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "People E-G", " Thomas Edison"], "questions": [{"text": "The prolific American inventor Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847 in a small Ohio town.  After which Italian city was his town of birth called?  \n", "correct": "Milan", "options": ["Genoa", "Florence", "Venice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilan.\n\n\tNancy Elliot Edison gave birth to her seventh child Thomas on that fateful February day of 1847, with father Samuel Edison, Jr. close at hand.  Thomas was preceded in birth by his six siblings, Marion, William, Callie, Harriet, Samuel and Eliza.  The family was not poor, as the myths would have it, but at the same time they were not bathing in wealth. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: As a youth, Thomas had only a few short months of formal schooling and was considered by his parents and teachers to have a severe learning disability.  ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThomas only had 3 months of formal education, his mother pulling him out of school at 10 years of age.  Home schooling was proposed for the young Thomas, who seemed to lack the ability to learn conventionally.  He did not begin speaking until he was four years old, prompting some adults around him to speculate that he might be retarded. Thomas was not retarded, but he may have suffered from what we now term 'Attention Deficit Disorder' (ADD) and/or dyslexia.  Fortunately, young Thomas responded very well to his home schooling, which was supervised wholly by his beloved mother.  He poured over books concerning a myriad of topics and became quite eloquent, though from his youth forward he always harbored suspicions about formal education and the products therewith. \n"}, {"text": "At the age of seven, Thomas and his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan.  He set up his first laboratory in the basement of his family's house at 10 years of age.  At 12 years old, he found his first job working in a position attached to which field?  ", "correct": "Railroad", "options": ["Utilities", "Medicine", "Law"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRailroad.\n\n\tThomas accepted a position working for the Grand Trunk Railway operating out of Michigan, selling knickknacks and performing other odd tasks.  During his work with the railway he began printing his own newspaper, the first regular daily newspaper delivered on trains in the country.  Thomas also moved some of his lab items onto an abandoned railway car where he continued to experiment.  His experience on the rails included his first taste of telegraphy, an occupation with which he would soon become intimately involved. \n"}, {"text": "Most of his life, Thomas suffered from a certain handicap.  From which of the following difficulties did he suffer?  \n", "correct": "Partial deafness", "options": ["Lame left leg", "Partial blindness", "Inoperative left arm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPartial deafness.\n\n\tEdison became almost completely deaf at a very young age.  He lost hearing entirely in his left ear and perhaps suffered from 80% hearing loss in his right ear.  This handicap likely occurred as a result of a blow he received to the head by a train conductor during his stint at the Grand Trunk Railway.  He had inadvertently started a fire on one of the trains, provoking his superior to violent anger. Soon after this incident, Thomas suffered from scarlet fever, which, enhanced by the blow to the head, caused permanent hearing loss.  Obviously, Edison did not let his handicap deter him from achieving greatness! \n"}, {"text": "From 1862 to 1868 Edison worked in the telegraphy industry, where he learned much about mechanical devices.  During this time, he also came into contact with a number of important individuals, including the current king of inventors, Alexander Graham Bell himself!  Inspired by the atmosphere of innovation he found during these years, and especially in Boston, where he lived during the latter part of this period, he came up with his first invention.  What was this first invention, developed in 1868, for which he received his first patent?  ", "correct": "Vote Recorder", "options": ["Automatic Telegraph", "Fuse Block", "Magnetic Ore Separator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVote Recorder.\n\n\tEdison's vote recorder seemed like the logical solution to what he saw as a very slow-moving voting process amongst members of the Massachusetts legislature.  Little did Thomas realize, the members of that legislature didn't want to be hurried along in their voting process; they needed more time to satisfy their urge to be verbose!  Sadly, his vote recorder was a financial failure...but Thomas would not be deterred! \n"}, {"text": "Thomas' first financial success came a year later.  Traveling from Boston to New York, he found himself in dire financial straits.  Hoping to strike it rich in the Big Apple, he found odd jobs here and there.  It was in Gotham that serendipity first smiled at Edison, when he created which device, his first major moneymaker? ", "correct": "Stock Ticker System", "options": ["Electric Meter", "Pneumatic Stencil Pens", "Dynamo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStock Ticker System.\n\n\tThomas found a small apartment which happened to exist below a New York brokerage.  Hearing of trouble within the brokerage regarding the stock ticker equipment, Edison made his way upstairs and helped to fix the stock ticker system.  This led to his first major patent and a whopping $40,000!  Edison was so stunned by this exorbitant sum that he wandered for a few days with the check in his pocket, marveling at it from time to time. \n"}, {"text": "Edison's first marriage began in 1871, when he decided to hitch up with a laboratory assistant nine years his younger.  Who was this lovely girl with whom Thomas became betrothed? ", "correct": "Mary Stilwell", "options": ["Tina Southwick", "Margaret Cummings", "Eliza Jewson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMary Stilwell.\n\n\tWith Thomas, Mary would have three children, Marion Estelle, Thomas Alva Jr. and William Leslie.  Sadly, Mary would die in 1884, at only 29 years of age.  His second wife was called Mina Miller and she bore Thomas three children, Madeleine, Charles and Theodore Miller.  Mina outlived Thomas by 16 years. \n"}, {"text": "Thomas and his wife soon had three children.  What were the fitting nicknames of the first two children, a daughter and a son?  \n", "correct": "Dot and Dash", "options": ["Belle and Morse", "Light and Bulb", "Inspiration and Perspiration"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDot and Dash.\n\n\tGiven Thomas's connection with the telegraph, it being the partial inspiration for his future works, it makes sense that his first two kids would be named for the two symbols of Morse code! \n"}, {"text": "In 1876, Thomas, with the support of several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, set up a laboratory for inventing purposes in which small New Jersey town? ", "correct": "Menlo Park", "options": ["Princeton", "Hackensack", "Morristown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMenlo Park.\n\n\tIt was at this site that Edison and his assistants would create the many memorable inventions for which Thomas is now famous.  It's no wonder that he was called the 'Wizard of Menlo Park'. \n"}, {"text": "The following year, 1877, Edison patented his personal favorite invention.  What was this remarkable device?  \n", "correct": "Phonograph", "options": ["Electric Pen", "Fluoroscope", "Electric Fan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhonograph.\n\n\tEdison invented the phonograph (aka record player) in 1877, the year after opening his Menlo Park laboratory.  He called the phonograph his 'baby'.  Thomas believed that the phonograph would bring him the most fortune, but this was not so.  All told, Edison was involved in the patent of over 1,093 inventions (singly or jointly), the most ever for an individual in U.S. history. \n"}, {"text": "Let's jump to 1879 now, and another important Edison invention, the incandescent light bulb.  Is it true or false that Edison's light bulb was the very first to be patented?  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn actuality, a number of light bulbs came before Edison's, but they were relatively unsuccessful prototypes, burning out in a much shorter time and with lower quality lighting effects.  It is safe to say that Edison's light bulbs, financed by Morgan and Vanderbilt, revolutionized the lighting industry, however. \n"}, {"text": "The first commercial power system was developed by Thomas Edison in 1882, when he began lighting homes in which of these cities?  \n", "correct": "New York", "options": ["Boston", "Paris", "London"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York.\n\n\tOther cities were developing rudimentary power systems, but Edison's was the first commercial system to light up a city.  His company began producing electricity for New York City homes in 1882 using direct current. \n"}, {"text": "1882 was also the year of Edison's only significant scientific discovery.  This discovery, that an electric current could be induced to flow between two unconnected wires in a vacuum, is called the Edison _______?  (Fill in the blank)", "correct": "Effect", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEffect.\n\n\tHis discovery and documentation of the Edison Effect eventually helped lead to the development of the vacuum tube, a key component for early radios, televisions and computers. \n"}, {"text": "Thomas Edison was involved in the creation of a number of major U.S. companies in various industries.  The greatest example of his corporate initiative was the development of the Edison Electric Company in 1889, which eventually merged with another Company and became which major corporate juggernaut of the 20th century?  \n", "correct": "General Electric & GE & G.E. General Electric Company  & G E & The General Electric Company", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneral Electric & GE & G.E. General Electric Company  & G E & The General Electric Company\n\n\tEdison was involved in the incorporation of General Electric in 1892.  It would soon go toe-to-toe with its major early rival, Westinghouse, who employed Nikola Tesla, the developer of alternating current. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1890s, after his invention of the motion picture camera and the projector, Edison became involved in movie making.  He opened his Black Maria Motion Picture Company in 1893 and set out to make films.  What was the name of the 10 minute film released by his company in 1903 that took the film world by storm?  \n", "correct": "The Great Train Robbery", "options": ["A Trip to the Moon", "The Birth of a Nation", "The General"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Great Train Robbery.\n\n\tEdison's very first copyrighted film was a recording of a sneeze.  'The Great Train Robbery' was created in 1903, produced by Edison and directed by Edwin S. Porter.  The short film, based on an actual train robbery pulled off by Butch Cassidy and his gang, became the inspiration for an entire industry, though Edison himself never had much financial success from it.  Following his great inventions of the late 19th century, Edison would continue to work on various useful gadgets for a number of years, finally passing away in West Orange, New Jersey, in 1931.  Though he has long since been dead, his name will forever be etched in the annals of history as one of the world's greatest inventors!
