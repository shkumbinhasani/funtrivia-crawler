{"id": "406809", "name": "Midnight Mass - Book VII: Revelations Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "Midnight Mass"], "questions": [{"text": "When the Angel absconded with Mildred, what did he do with her?", "correct": "Transformed her", "options": ["Tossed her out to sea", "Beheaded her", "It is unknown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTransformed her.\n\n\tAs the congregation at St. Patrick's Church emerge from the bloodbath, Mildred awakens on the ground outside, finding herself to have been reborn and taking in the new sensations that come from the Angel's gift.  She finds Father Hill inside and sits with him.\r Throughout the town, the changed islanders commence their hunt for sustenance, attacking those who stayed home in their lust for blood and feeding them from their own to change them.  While many break into the other houses and feast on the citizens, Ali and Ed Flynn watch on, at odds with their new natures.\r Sheriff Hassan, Sarah, Erin, Annie, Warren, and Leeza take refuge in Erin's home and watch from the windows, expecting the reborn townspeople to find them in due time.  Hassan says he needs to go back to church; he needs to find his son. \n"}, {"text": "Who sacrifices themselves, distracting Bev while the others escape Erin's burning house?", "correct": "Annie", "options": ["Sheriff Hassan", "Leeza", "Warren"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnnie.\n\n\tHassan asks Sarah for answers, but it appears there are none to be had; Sarah's samples couldn't make it to the mainland for testing since the ferry was inoperable.  When the group realizes they have no cell service, Warren suggests they find his canoe and get away while they can.  Erin realizes that the remaining boats on the island are operable, likely after some fixes, because the islanders will want to spread their gospel to the mainland.  The contagion, however, needs to stay on Crockett's Island; if just one of them makes it to the mainland, it's over.\r Erin hands Hassan's gun back over and the group distributes knives for their own protection.  Annie reminds them that they get back up, however.  It's not a solution, but it may buy them a few more minutes.  The whole thing might come down to seconds.\r Annie struggles to comprehend what's going on.  Always believing there to be a Heaven, all of this is at odds with what she knows to be true.  It's not about their going to Heaven though, Erin says.  It's now about everyone else.\r That's when the molotov cocktail crashes in through the window.  Bev and Sturge are outside, and hey know Erin's in there.  Though Erin makes for the door, Annie stops her; this is her opportunity to help the ones she loves, and she'd like a word with Bev. \n"}, {"text": "Why did Father Hill bring the Angel back to Crockett's Island?", "correct": "To save Mildred", "options": ["To usher in a new era", "He was compelled against his will", "To rehabilitate it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo save Mildred.\n\n\tSheriff Hassan forces Warren out Erin's back window as Annie emerges out the front door, walking down the front porch to speak to Bev and Sturge, knife in hand.  Bev assures that she would never hurt the children inside.  In fact, they're already ready to be reborn.  Their brief pain will be followed by immortality.  Annie tells Bev what she needs to say-- Bev isn't a good person.  God doesn't love Bev more than anyone else; she's not a hero and she's not a victim.  He loves Bev as much as He loved Riley, even if that hurts Bev to hear.  As Bev and Sturge move to check around the back of the house, Annie takes the knife to her own throat and slices across, distracting the two with her running blood long enough to let her son and the others get away.\r In the church, Father Hill muses on the Bible with Mildred holding his hand.  He admits why he did it all-- it was her and Sarah.  He put the Angel in the trunk and smuggled it back to Crockett's Island because he didn't want them to die.  He didn't want the rest of them to die either, but it was all for them.  He regrets not being able to tell his daughter the truth.  It's all over though; they made their choices. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these buildings survive the fires back in 1984?", "correct": "The church", "options": ["The general store", "The schoolhouse", "The rec center"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe church.\n\n\tErin, Sarah, Sheriff Hassan, Leeza, and Warren race through town, keeping to the shadows as they try to make their way to the waterfront only to encounter the Angel flying overhead.  As the creature breaks into a woman's home, the group's presence is noted by Ooker, who comes after them looking to feed.  Hassan uses his last bullets to defend them as the vampires start to close in; the only way they can escape is by splitting up.\r In front of Erin's house, Bev and Sturge wonder why Annie would have killed herself.  As Erin's place burns down, Sturge warns that it may set the other buildings up like a tinderbox, especially considering the strong winds coming off the sea.  Bev suggests that they let it happen; St. Patrick's Chruch survived the fires in '84; it will be their Ark and the faithless will burn in the lake of fire, just like in Revelations.  As they leave Annie to awaken on her own, they grab their molotovs and continue on.\r Leeza and Warren hide themselves in Joe's trailer while the crows pass by.  Grabbing the rifle from Joe's wall, she begins to load her pockets with ammunition.  Like Erin said, it could grant them minutes. \n"}, {"text": "Who of these refuses to feed on the people in town?", "correct": "Ed", "options": ["Bev", "Father Hill", "Sturge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEd.\n\n\tWhile Bev and Sturge make more fires in town, Annie and Ed reunite, both walking the same streets to find each other wandering aimlessly.  Both find the other covered in blood, but both admit it's their own.  They feel the pain of needing to feed, but they both suggest that they couldn't do it.  As much as they're starving, they won't change who they are.\r At the docks, Erin, Sarah, and Hassan wonder if Leeza and Warren made it to the boat.  Sarah believes that they may never know, so she decides out loud that they did.  As the three unlock the gas tanks, they douse the boats in fuel and light them ablaze.\r Leeza and Warren, meanwhile, take refuge in a house while Mayor Scarborough and his wife call for their daughter outside.  As the smoke starts to overwhelm them, they realize they've hidden in the long-abandoned house that the Angel has been using as a hiding spot.  They find the bodies there and, in the shadows, the Angel itself taking its next victim.  Taking aim, Leeza takes the rifle and fires it at the creature with next to no effect.  It's because of this that she douses it with gasoline, creating a trail of fuel out the door before Warren lights it.\r The Angel, lit ablaze, flees into the sky while the kids run to evade capture.  They leave the rifle behind and it's grabbed by Sturge on his rounds through the town.  If the people of Crockett's Island aren't in the rec center by dawn, he says, they'll be toast. \n"}, {"text": "Bev declares Father Hill a false prophet and a challenge to her faith.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhile the town burns, Bev makes the final beds in the candlelight of the rec center and heads outside to watch from the church. When she rings the church bells, it attracts the attention of everyone on the island.  It's because of this that Father Hill and Mildred are made aware of her presence and they emerge to meet her.\r Father Hill is brought outside to see the fires set on the island and he's made aware of Bev's plans to use the two remaining buildings as an Ark for the chosen townspeople but he refuses her suggestion that they should be the ones to spread the gospel beyond the island; they got it all wrong.  He comes to the realization that they are the wolves; they were all wrong and it needs to stop.  When Bev reminds him that he needs to be faithful and preach, Father Hill snaps back at her, saying it was never supposed to be about a priest.  Instead it was always supposed to be about God.\r It's enough to convince Bev that Father Hill/Monsignor Pruitt is nothing more than a false prophet.  He would be the hardest test of her faith, a stumbling block.  She bids them adieu, hoping they enjoy the sunrise before taking the congregation for herself. \n"}, {"text": "Who returns to St. Patrick's Church in an attempt to burn it down?", "correct": "Sarah", "options": ["Erin", "Sheriff Hassan", "Riley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSarah.\n\n\tAs Warren and Leeza race across the island and find the shored canoe they listen to the crackling flames and explosions.  Leeza says goodbye to her parents and says a prayer as they load into the boat, asking God for them to find peace.  Everyone in their families is gone.  They can only leave while they still can.\r At the rec centre, Bev commences a headcount and speaks to the townspeople, suggesting that many of them could have done more, if they hadn't, by coming to Mass.  They lost their families and friends, but anyone who did not make the effort to pray amongst the congregation is not welcome.  Father Hill, standing at the door to the church, welcomes him in instead, saying that if no one is welcome then it isn't God's house.\r As he heads inside, he finds his daughter covering the pews in gasoline. \n"}, {"text": "Sarah Gunning refuses her father's blood, dying without being reborn.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSarah stops what she's doing when Father Hill reenters the church and the two face each other.  He says she's doing the right thing, however.  When she's done setting the place ablaze she should leave out the back in the vestibule and head to the water.  He admits he's proud of her and says he's sorry that he and her mother never told her the truth about him, but their reunion is cut short when a gunshot rings out.  Sturge, standing in the doorway, lowers the rifle.\r What results is a fight out onto the church steps.  Father Hill only stops when Mildred finds Sarah laying on the ground inside and the two rush in to feed her their blood.  Sarah refuses, however, spitting it back up to avoid becoming reborn.  As the two carry her body out and to the little bridge near the marsh, Mildred knocks over a candle, setting the church ablaze.\r It takes a while before the townspeople notice, in the distraction that is the church fire, that Sheriff Hassan is behind them getting ready to set fire to the rec center. \n"}, {"text": "Who manages to burn down the rec center?", "correct": "Ali", "options": ["Sheriff Hassan", "Erin", "Father Hill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAli.\n\n\tWhen Bev finally sees Sheriff Hassan dousing the rec center in gas, she grabs the rifle and fires it at him, clipping him in the leg.  She mocks him for being a terrorist, alleging she knew he would be trouble the minute he showed his face on the island.  She says he's a coward and filled with dirty blood; he couldn't even burn it when they were inside.  It's not empty though; Erin has been inside soaking the beds with gas as well.\r When Erin emerges and flicks open her lighter, it's a moment too late.  The Angel swoops in and grabs her, pinning her to the ground in the cemetery and beginning to feed on her.  Ali is the one to pick up the dropped lighter.  As Bev asks the boy to hand over the lighter, with the gun still trained on his father, Ali tosses it inside.  The building goes up in flames as Bev fires a shot into Hassan's stomach.\r Erin, still pinned to the ground, manages to reach into her pocket and grab the last weapon at her disposal-- the knife from her butcher's block.  As the creature feeds it doesn't notice as she begins to tear into its wings.  When it finally leaves her, it realizes that it struggles to ascend into the sky.\r As the townspeople disperse, realizing that there's nowhere left to turn and nowhere to hide from the sun, some can only attempt to forgive themselves for what they've done. \n"}, {"text": "How many people survive the last night on Crockett's Island?", "correct": "Two & 2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo & 2.\n\n\tWhile Hassan and Ali try to make their way down the road, they watch as the creature struggles to fly into the night, due west.  Leeza and Warren, out at sea, see the same thing and believe it'll never make it before sunrise.\r As Erin succumbs to her wounds, she remembers one of her last conversations with Riley where they mused on what might happen when they die.  It's Riley's words that she remembers, this time coming from her own voice.  As she stares into the cosmos, she forgets and remembers that she is a part of it, as is everything else.  Life is a dream and a wish for eternity.\r Father Hill and Mildred leave Sarah's body at the bridge while the town burns.  Ed and Annie lead the town in singing a final hymn together as the night ends.  Hassan and Ali make it to the water's edge before sunrise.  During their final prayers, Hassan succumbs to his wounds.  Bev, watching the two share their last moments, gazes at the horizon and fights to dig a hole in the sand in a last-ditch effort to survive.\r When the sun crests the edge of the water, the remaining islanders are destroyed in its light.\r Leeza and Warren, adrift in their canoe, watch as the ashes drift to them over the water. \n"}]}
