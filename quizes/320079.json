Who was the director of this film?", "correct": "Wes Craven", "options": ["John Carpenter", "Tobe Hooper", "Tom Holland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWes Craven.\n\n\t\"Scream\", appearing in 1996, starred Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and other big actors.

The entire opening scene sees the famous Drew Barrymore talking with the killer over her phone about horror movies.  In a shocking move, Barrymore is the first to be killed in the film despite her billing.\r\"Scream\" was praised by critics for its approach and earned $173,000,000 in the box office.  It was followed by a number of sequels starring the original cast and each one was a box office success.

Released in 1959 on the album \"Shout!\", the song has since been used in numerous movies covered by various artists (including The Temptations, Green Day, Bon Jovi, and even Alvin and the Chipmunks). \n"}, {"text": "Cry! - In 2002, which country artist released the Billboard #1 album, \"Cry\"?", "correct": "Faith Hill", "options": ["Dixie Chicks", "Lee Ann Womack", "Shania Twain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaith Hill.\n\n\tSelling millions of copies (going three times platinum), the CD hit #1 on the Billboard Top 100 albums and spawned three singles including one named \"Cry\" which won Hill the Grammy for 'Best Female Country Vocal Performance' in 2002.  While Faith Hill has released a number of CDs, \"Cry\" continued a streak of popular country albums by the singer.  The one single wasn't her first Grammy either; in 1999, she claimed three.  The single later appeared on Faith Hill's second greatest hits album, \"The Hits\", which was released in 2007. \n"}, {"text": "Shriek! - The 2000 film \"Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth\" falls under what genre?", "correct": "Parody Film", "options": ["Animated Film", "Documentary", "Melodrama"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParody Film.\n\n\tAlthough this film was planned for a theatrical release in 2000, the earlier release of the box office hit \"Scary Movie\" ended up pushing the film to a straight-to-DVD release.  While a bit cruder, \"Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth\" parodies the same horror conventions as its popular counterpart with less famous actors. In fact, the only major names in the movie are Coolio (who plays the Administrator-Formerely-Known-As-Principal...seriously), Simon Rex (who appeared in \"Scary Movie 3\", coincidentally), and Julie Benz (who appears as Rita on \"Dexter\" and who had a role in \"Saw V\"). \n"}, {"text": "Bark! - All breeds of dog bark.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlthough there are only a few instances of 'barkless' dogs, it is completely false to say that all dog breeds have the ability to bark.  Basenjis, for example, are unable to produce a barking noise due to the shape of their voicebox.  Beside the name 'Basenji', the dog is also typically known as the 'African Barkless Dog'.  Australian dingos are typically regarded as barkless dogs as well due to the fact that the noise they emit does not resemble domestic dog barking.\rThe act of 'debarking' an animal is considered illegal in many countries though veterinarians have performed this surgical procedure before to lower the volume or remove the bark of pet dogs. \n"}, {"text": "Squawk! - What was the name of Long John Silver's parrot in Robert Louis Stevenson's novel \"Treasure Island\"?", "correct": "Captain Flint", "options": ["Hawkins", "Davy Jones", "Captain Jack"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Flint.\n\n\tCaptain Flint is actually two characters in the 1883 'boys novel' \"Treasure Island\".

The story of \"Treasure Island\" takes a young Jim Hawkins onto a boat with a map and a group of pirates to discover where the treasure is buried.  When he arrives, however, the swashbuckling fun is only one of the pirate-themed goodies that await; he's also faced with horrible dangers, mutiny, double-crossing scallywags, and swordfights. The book popularized the terms 'X marks the spot' and 'Pieces of Eight' and it's been adapted many times over. \n"}, {"text": "Crow! - What is the name of the actor who passed away while filming the 1994 film \"The Crow\"?", "correct": "Brandon Lee", "options": ["Bela Lugosi", "Chris Farley", "Peter Sellers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrandon Lee.\n\n\tThe son of martial artist and actor Bruce Lee, Brandon lee had appeared in about half a dozen works before \"The Crow\".

Which of these repetitive strain injuries comes from text messaging?", "correct": "'Blackberry Thumb'", "options": ["'iPhone Elbow'", "'RAZR Wrist'", "'Sprint Sprain'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Blackberry Thumb'.\n\n\tMuch like 'Wii Elbow', the term 'Blackberry Thumb' has been used to describe injuries sustained as a result of technology.  In the case of 'Blackberry Thumb', Palm Pilot/PDA/Cell Phone users who make too many text messages without proper thumb exercises or rest breaks may find their digits to be experiencing some acute pain (similar to the idea of a Nintendo Wii Remote straining the elbow).  With phones and electronics getting smaller, more compact, and more 'practical', the rate of injuries rises and since the Blackberry's debut in the late nineties, more and more cases of this odd syndrome have appeared...but more products have been sold and text messaging has become more popular than directly phoning. \n"}, {"text": "Bellow! - Which of these does a bellows apparatus typically shoot?", "correct": "Air", "options": ["Bullets", "Arrows", "Skeet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAir.\n\n\tA bellows in a typical sense is an object pumped to shoot air at a high pressure at a specific item.  For example, bellows can be used on fire or heated objects in order to supply oxygen.  Specifically-built bellows are also used in the production of pipe organs and bagpipes.  A common double-chambered bellows has a tendency to open and shut much like an accordion in order to allow air to enter and be forced out a nozzle at the opposite end.  Although bellows for modern use are typically automated, they've been around since ancient times. \n"}]}
