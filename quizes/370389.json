What business is that?", "correct": "Plastic surgery clinics", "options": ["Fashion industry", "Electronics", "Shipping"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlastic surgery clinics.\n\n\tCasablanca has a long standing tradition in plastic surgery. This tradition started in the 1950s with French gynecologist Georges Burou, a pioneer in sex reassignment surgery for transwomen. At a time when these types of operations were illegal in Europe, Georges Burou performed them in Casablanca, rather successfully, and his method laid the foundation for the perfection of the procedure in later years.Many skilled plastic surgeons followed in Dr Burou's footsteps, catering mainly to the growing need for rhinoplasties, tummy tucks and breast implants. For one third of the cost of a plastic surgery in a European country, a whole family can enjoy a vacation in the sun while a parent gets a tummy tuck or a nose job.The demand is so great that business is spreading to neighboring Algeria. \n"}, {"text": "The Shrine of Sidi Abderrahman is built on a rock out at sea, past Casablanca's Corniche, the oceanside neighborhood.
