{"id": "64065", "name": "History of the FAPL: 1992-2002 Quiz | Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "       FA Premier League", "Premiership 1990s"], "questions": [{"text": "Who won the first ever Premier League title in the 1992-93 season?", "correct": "Manchester United", "options": ["Arsenal", "Leeds United", "Aston Villa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nManchester United.\n\n\tMan United's first title since the 1960s, although despite the 10 point margin, they were made to fight until the penultimate weekend by Aston Villa. United actually have the honour of having the first ever Premier League goal scored against them, Brian Deane scoring for Sheffield United after just five minutes of their 2-1 win over United.That was the beginning of a poor start for Man Utd as they then lost 3-0 at home to Everton before an uninspiring home draw with Ipswich. They went 10 games without defeat, winning half of them and then, arguably the turning point, the purchase of Eric Cantona from Leeds United.I was stunned when he left Elland Road, especailly for Old Trafford, but what an impact he made. \n"}, {"text": "Who finished rock bottom of the league in the first ever Premier League in the 1992-93 season?", "correct": "Nottingham Forest", "options": ["Swindon Town", "Crystal Palace", "Oldham Athletic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNottingham Forest.\n\n\tAll season people said that Forest were 'too good to go down' and with Brian Clough in charge and the likes of son Nigel, Stuart Pearce and Roy Keane in the side, then they should have been. But some startling early season results got them off to a bad start, they lost 5-3 at Oldham, 4-1 at Blackburn, 3-1 at Norwich, all this after winning their opening game against Liverpool 1-0, a game which was the first ever LIVE Sky Premier League game. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1993-94 season it was all about the relegation battle come the end of the season, but which teams made the drop to the 1st division?", "correct": "Swindon Town, Oldham Athletic, Sheffield United", "options": ["Oldham Athletic, Sheffield United, Middlesbrough", "Swindon Town, Ipswich Town, Oldham Athletic", "Swindon Town, Norwich City, Sheffeld United"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwindon Town, Oldham Athletic, Sheffield United.\n\n\tSwindon never looked in it as their defence leaked 100 goals. Their first victory didn't arrive until November, by which time the damage was largely done. Oldham didn't survive this time although it was close. They won only four games before Christmas and despite a rally during Easter when they beat Southampton and QPR in three days, a good FA Cup run resulted in a fixture pile up and no wins in their final eight games.The final relegation spot was between four clubs on the last day. If Everton failed to win, then they were down, an own goal and a penalty put Wimbledon 2-0 up at Goodison, but in an unforgettable comeback Graeme Stuart with two and Barry Horne kept them up, but it was so close.Southampton saved themselves with a 3-3 draw at West Ham so for so long it looked as though Ipswich would go down. Their goalless draw against Blackburn wouldn't have been enough if Sheff United would have held their 2-2 draw at Chelsea, however in stoppage time Mark Stein put Chelsea 3-2 up and denied United the point they needed and down they went. It was an amazing climax to a remarkable day. \n"}, {"text": "On 25th January, 1995 Eric Cantona 'Kung-Fu' kicked a Crystal Palace fan and received an F.A. ban for how long?", "correct": "8 Months", "options": ["16 Months", "10 Months", "12 Months"], "explanation": "\n\n\n8 Months.\n\n\tEarly in the second half Cantona was shown the red card for kicking Richard Shaw, as he was walking away to the dressing room, he launched his now infamous kung fu attack on Palace fan Matthew Simmons after he'd yelled obsenities at the Frenchman. The game ended 1-1 but the result was irrelevant. Cantona was suspended by United for the season, a ban that was later increased by the FA until the end of September 1995. Football fans were split, some (mainly United fans) thought Cantona was justified and that players shouldn't have to take abuse, the rest thought that he should have been banned from ever kicking a ball in this country again. \n"}, {"text": "Blackburn Rovers won the Premier League in the 1994-95 season on the last day of the season, despite losing to Liverpool 2-1 on the last day: who got the winner for Liverpool?", "correct": "Jamie Redknapp", "options": ["Ian Rush", "Robbie Fowler", "Steve Macmanaman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJamie Redknapp.\n\n\tBlackburn knew that a win at Liverpool would secure the title regardless of United's game at West Ham. However if Blackburn drew or lost AND United won, then the Reds would steal it away. By half time it looked all over, Blackburn were a goal up through Alan Shearer and United were behind thanks to Michael Hughes.United then equalised through Brian McClair and Liverpool levelled it through John Barnes. Blackburn still had the edge, but another United goal would be enough. Both Blackburn and United had chances to score, and both blew them. Amazingly late in stoppage time Jamie Redknapp scored a stunning free kick to put Blackburn behind, they now knew that if United scored at Upton Park, there'd be no time for Blackburn to get back.As Liverpool celebrated their goal, there came an enourmous roar from the Blackburn section, the final whistle had gone at West Ham and United had only drawn! It was a thrilling piece of television, I still get goose pimples when I watch it even now. The sight of Redknapp's shot going in, the Blackburn fans with their heads in their hands, some look around at a guy who obviously has a radio concentrating on the other game, and then bedlam as they know they've won the league despite losing at Anfield. This finale is only bettered by the finish to the 1988-89 season (Liverpool v Arsenal 0-2 at Anfield to give Arsenal the League title). \n"}, {"text": "In the 1996-97 season Liverpool, Newcastle United and Arsenal all finished on 68 points.

Bolton were within ONE goal of staying up but fail to score to draw at Chelsea, as Everton struggled for points at Coventry. Everton weren't the only big club to struggle as new Tottenham manager Christin Gross failed to impress and Newcastle found it hard without Shearer When he was injured for 5 months. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1999-2000 season who scored the most Premiership goals?", "correct": "Kevin Phillips", "options": ["Micheal Owen", "Alan Shearer", "Dwight Yorke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin Phillips.\n\n\tPhillips netted 30 goals in the Premiership but failed to score in any other competition.
