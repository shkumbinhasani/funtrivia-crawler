{"id": "182530", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Dear Mildred' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of 'Dear Mildred' Radar enters Colonel Potter's office asking if he can be of assistance.  The Colonel says no, suggesting that he merely needs to write a letter to his wife back home.  It's the Colonel's anniversary; how long has he been married to Mildred?", "correct": "27 years", "options": ["38 years", "50 years", "45 years"], "explanation": "\n\n\n27 years.\n\n\tDespite his relatively advanced age, he has 'only' been married for 27 years!  This would mean that he and Mildred were married in either 1924 or 1925.  When the Colonel asks Radar if he is married, Radar responds, 'No sir, I'm just a kid.' \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter begins his letter to Mildred while Radar cleans his office.  The first person at the camp that the Colonel discusses is Radar.  Radar is described as 'nice enough', but a little...?", "correct": "Squirrelly", "options": ["Skunky", "Weaselly", "Badgery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSquirrelly.\n\n\tWhen the Colonel writes 'squirrelly' Radar gives him a knowing and somewhat annoyed look, his radar-sense at work.  During the first several episodes in which Colonel Potter appeared they tried to create a sense of tension between him and Radar.  This makes sense when one considers that Colonel Blake had just died and Potter, who had replaced him, was 'regular army'. \n"}, {"text": "Following his morning in the office with Colonel Potter, Radar comes to the Swamp for some advice.  It seems that he can't get comfortable around the Colonel and compares him to his aunt.  Radar claims that after spending the summer with his aunt he would always return home with which 'ailment'?", "correct": "Hyperaciditity", "options": ["Upset stomachosis", "Nervous twitchers", "Nauseations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyperaciditity.\n\n\tAnother of the famed Radarisms that were featured during his run on the show.  'I just can't get relaxed around him,' Radar says.  He continues, 'It's like staying with your aunt instead of your mother.  You gotta say 'please'.  You can't dunk your zwieback in your Bosco!'  Oh the humanity! \n"}, {"text": "In the midst of Radar's angst, a chopper arrives at camp with mail.  In addition to bringing the mail, the pilot announces that he needs to check his tail rotor cables and asks if the 4077th has which of the following?", "correct": "A sharpshooter", "options": ["A tailgunner", "An intelligence officer", "A combat specialist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA sharpshooter.\n\n\tThe pilot claims that the Chinese have left a wounded horse somewhere north of the 4077th and that it should be 'put out of its misery'.  When he inquires about a sharpshooter Hawkeye responds, 'We've got four rifles in this outfit, and one of them is a reading lamp'.  Radar strongly objects to the idea of shooting the horse and suggests that the doctors go and save it.  They reluctantly agree. \n"}, {"text": "The scene shifts back to Colonel Potter, who sits in the mess tent drinking coffee and continuing his letter to Mildred.  He is joined by Father Mulcahy who, after a brief discussion, leaves suddenly.  When the Colonel inquires into Mulcahy's problem, the latter responds with a single word.  What is it?", "correct": "Dysentery", "options": ["Diarrhea", "Hepatitis", "Enteritis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDysentery.\n\n\tThe discussion between Potter and Mulcahy is a bit awkward, with Potter praising Sunday's sermon.  Mulcahy responds, 'Ah yes, 'Do Unto Thy Brother'.  You know, you can't miss if you've got good material.'  Before Potter can respond, Mulcahy says, 'Well, if you'll excuse me, I have to run.'  'More confessions?' Potter asks.  'Dysentery', answers the Father.  Potter retorts, 'Ah well, this too shall pass!' \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter continues his letter to Mildred, describing the qualities of Father Mulcahy.  He describes a 'movie night' in the mess tent when Mulcahy comes to the rescue after the projector fails.  The Father does a duet with Nurse O'Connor, but what song do they sing?", "correct": "All Dressed Up and No Place to Go", "options": ["I'm Afraid to Come Home in the Dark", "Long, Long Trail", "Keep the Homefires Burning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll Dressed Up and No Place to Go.\n\n\tThe lyrics for the song are as follows:\r 'When you're all dressed up and no place to go \rLife seems weary, dreary and slow. \rMy heart has ached and bled for the tears I've shed, \rWhen I've no place to go unless I went back to bed. \r I've had a sad, sad life and whenever I go \rTo that peaceful spot where the violets grow, \rUpon a nice white stone will be written below: \r\"He was all dressed up and no place to go.\"' \n"}, {"text": "In the scene following the musical number, we see Radar, BJ and Hawkeye pursuing a horse that the helicopter pilot has discovered in a nearby field.  BJ takes the first turn in attempting to lasso the horse.  Is he successful?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNot unless 'success' is defined as lassoing Hawkeye to a rock.  Hawkeye also makes an attempt to rope the horse, but it is aborted as soon as he begins to approach the poor animal.  Radar, always good with animals, finally manages to cajole the horse over to their truck.  Hawkeye comments, 'If I could only do that with nurses.' \n"}, {"text": "The next topic in Colonel Potter's letter is the suspected fling between Frank and Margaret.  After a few racy comments from the Colonel, the scene shifts to Margaret and Frank who are attempting to acquire a carved bust of the Colonel from a local craftsman.  What medium does this gentleman use?", "correct": "Wood", "options": ["Glass", "Stone", "Metal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWood.\n\n\tPotter talks of his suspicions about Margaret and Frank, but claims that it's 'none of my business'.  In the letter he writes of 'lip rouge around [Frank's] mouth' and 'swollen lips', 'whisker burns on [Margaret's] cheeks' and 'teeth marks on [Frank's] neck'...pretty racy stuff!  The scene shifts to the craftsman's hut where Margaret and Frank commission a wood bust carving of Colonel Potter for $7.50 (the craftsman bargains Frank *up* from six dollars). \n"}, {"text": "When Margaret and Frank make their way to give the Colonel his present, they are accosted by the curious Hawkeye and BJ.  The four of them, along with the craftsman who created the Colonel's bust, enter Potter's office.  During this procession, Hawkeye and BJ lament the fact that they did not get Potter anything for his anniversary.  Cho offers to sell them a pencil box, claiming it was once owned by whom?", "correct": "Adolf Hitler", "options": ["George Washington", "Mao Zedong", "Alexander the Great"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdolf Hitler.\n\n\tInside Cho's vestcoat are a number of items, including Hitler's pencil box (or so he claims), numerous watches and ballpoint pens and a World Series ring (or so he claims!)  Needless to say, Hawkeye and BJ aren't buying. \n"}, {"text": "After being presented his bust carving, Colonel Potter receives an even greater surprise.  Radar enters his office and brings with him the horse that he and the doctors had tended to earlier in the episode.  Though the name is not mentioned in this episode, what is the Colonel's Horse called?", "correct": "Sophie & Sofie", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSophie & Sofie.\n\n\tIn one of the most poignant moments in the history of the series, Potter is first introduced to his horse Sophie.  Gary Burghoff and Harry Morgan play the scene perfectly.  Oddly, throughout the episode Radar and others refer to the horse as a 'he' when the horse ultimately turns out to be a 'she'!  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my other 'M*A*S*H' quizzes. \n"}]}
