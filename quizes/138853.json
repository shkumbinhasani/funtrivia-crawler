{"id": "138853", "name": "Minor 'M*A*S*H' Characters and Actors Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "M*A*S*H - Characters and Actors"], "questions": [{"text": "Actors Robert F. Simon, Herb Voland and Gene Wood all played what sort of character during the run of the series 'M*A*S*H'?", "correct": "Generals", "options": ["Wounded soldiers", "Chopper pilots", "Mess sergeants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenerals.\n\n\tGene Wood played General Hammond from both season one and the film version of 'M*A*S*H'.  Herb Voland was General Clayton, from both seasons one and two.  The nuttiest general of them all, General Mitchell, was played by Robert Simon during season two. \n"}, {"text": "Josh Bryant played the loveable Jack Scully in several episodes of 'M*A*S*H'.  How many times, in fact, did Bryant appear as Scully during the run of the series?", "correct": "3", "options": ["5", "4", "2"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tJosh Bryant appeared as Margaret's brief love interest, Sgt. (and Private) Jack Scully, during one season seven episode ('A Night at Rosie's') and two season eight episodes ('Guerilla My Dreams' and 'Stars and Stripes').  I really wish it had worked out between him and Margaret, I thought they made a cute couple... \n"}, {"text": "Which of these early minor actors (with character names) made a later appearance in the series as a completely different character?", "correct": "John Orchard (Ugly John)", "options": ["Odessa Cleveland (Ginger Bayliss)", "Timothy Jones (Spearchucker)", "Patrick Adriarte (Ho Jon)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Orchard (Ugly John).\n\n\tJohn Orchard, who played Aussie anesthesiologist Ugly John during a number of season one episodes, made an appearance during season eight as a military policeman named Muldoon.  Ugly John was quite a swell fellow, but Muldoon was a bribe-taking creep! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these actresses played a total of four different nurses (by character name) during the run of the series?", "correct": "Kellye Nakahara", "options": ["Gwen Farrell", "Stefanie Powers", "Jean Powell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKellye Nakahara.\n\n\tNakahara not only portrayed the oft-appearing Nurse Kellye during the series, but also played Nurse Yamato ('Hot Lips and Empty Arms', season 2), Nurse Able ('A Full Rich Day', season 3) and Nurse Charlie ('Bulletin Board', Season 3).  Nakahara has the distinction of being the minor character who appeared the most on the series (56 times!)  Mettey played three different nurses (Griffin, Anderson and Baker) during the early seasons, while Farrell played two (Butler and Wilson) and Jean Powell played one (Baker).  By the way, have you ever noticed how many nurse Bakers and Abels (or Ables) there were on the show?  I believe they used these two names because they were the names of the two monkeys who were shot into space by the United States in 1959, the first living creatures to return from an American space mission. These names may also have been inspired by an earlier form of the phonetic military alphabet. \n"}, {"text": "Of the two actresses with the last name Farrell (Gwen and Judy) who portrayed nurses on the show 'M*A*S*H', which was married at one time to Mike Farrell, aka B. J. Hunnicut?", "correct": "Judy & Judy Farrell", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJudy & Judy Farrell.\n\n\tJudy Farrell, nee Hayden, appeared on the show from 1976-1983, and was once married to Mike (they have since divorced.)

Interestingly, Judy and Mike had a daughter...named Erin! \n"}, {"text": "Sal Viscuso and Todd Susman both played a regular role during the run of 'M*A*S*H'.  Which character did both portray during the series?", "correct": "PA announcers", "options": ["Anesthesiologists", "Corpsmen", "Dentists"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPA announcers.\n\n\tBoth Sal Viscuso and Todd Susman played the disembodied voices you hear during nearly every 'M*A*S*H' episode, both uncredited during the entire series (what a ripoff!)  Viscuso also played the PA announcer during the film version of 'M*A*S*H'. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most beloved recurring 'M*A*S*H' characters was the quixotic Colonel Flagg, played by Edward Winter.  Let's get trivial...what was Flagg's given name?", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Albert", "Dave", "Fred"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tWinter played Colonel Sam Flagg as a semi-regular from 1974-1979.  His first appearance on the show as as Captain Halloran in the season three episode called 'Deal Me Out'.  Here's a cool bit of info...Winter also made an appearance on the short-lived sequel 'AfterMASH' as Flagg in 1984! \n"}, {"text": "Speaking of Colonel Flagg, between him (Edward Winter) and Allan Arbus, who played Major Sidney Freedman, who appeared in more episodes of 'M*A*S*H'?", "correct": "Arbus & Allan Arbus & Sidney Freedman & Sidney & Freedman", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nArbus & Allan Arbus & Sidney Freedman & Sidney & Freedman.\n\n\tWhile Edward Winter made a total of seven appearances on the show (six as Flagg), Allan Arbus made a total of ten!

Tuttle in the season one episode called 'Tuttle'?", "correct": "Himself", "options": ["No one", "Alan Alda", "Herb Fitts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHimself.\n\n\tOne of the great guest performances of all time, Tuttle really knocked 'em dead.  Unfortunately, this was his first and last appearance of the series, apparently there was a contract dispute and hence they decided to kill the character off.  As Frank Burns once said, 'We can use all the Tuttles we can get!' \n"}, {"text": "Which of these irregular cast members (with character names) was not a part of the cast during the final episode of 'M*A*S*H', called 'Goodbye, Farewell and Amen'?", "correct": "Johnny Haymer (Sgt.
