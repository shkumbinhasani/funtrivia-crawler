{"id": "191495", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'The Smell of Music' Multiple Choice Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "The 4077th has just seen another massive influx of casualties, and the doctors are bushed from the resulting 72-hour O.R. marathon.  Hawkeye and BJ are ready for a nice nap, but alas their dreams will have to be put on hold, as Charles has chosen this inopportune time to practice which musical instrument?", "correct": "French horn", "options": ["Accordian", "Trombone", "Cello"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrench horn.\n\n\tThe unflappable Major Charles Emerson Winchester seems to be unaffected by the merciless O.R. session.  Rather than turn in for a lovely 24-hour nap, as Hawkeye suggests, Charles insists on bellowing with his French horn.  Naturally, Charles is utterly unskilled with his instrument of choice, and hence all within his vicinity suffer unhappily to the cacophonous sounds he produces. \n"}, {"text": "After attempting to politely request that Charles cease his hopeless attempt at producing a melody, Hawkeye decides to play dirty.  Specifically, what dirty item does he employ in an attempt to cut off the foul noise emerging from Charles' musical instrument?", "correct": "Socks", "options": ["Underwear", "A banana peel", "A dead mouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSocks.\n\n\tIn fact, Hawkeye stuffs not one, but two dirty socks into the opening of Charles' French horn.  Charles threatens violence when Hawkeye refuses to remove his socks from the horn.  Hawkeye responds, 'Go ahead!  Beat me to death!  Just don't play that thing!' \n"}, {"text": "When Charles continues to stubbornly refuse to be reasonable about his 'music', BJ and Hawkeye concoct another plan.  They will not shower until Charles gives up his melody-making.  Unfortunately, their plan makes them immediate social pariahs.  Who is the first 4077th dweller to comment on their wondeful body aromas?", "correct": "Margaret", "options": ["Klinger", "Colonel Potter", "Father Mulcahy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret.\n\n\tSurprisingly, Klinger's nose is not the first to detect the doctors' foul odor, despite his having served them breakfast.  Rather, it is Margaret who first seems to notice the stench, commenting, 'Did the wind just suddenly shift?'  'Seems to be coming from the stable,' responds Father Mulcahy. \n"}, {"text": "Back to the O.R. we go.  Colonel Potter has just completed surgery on a young man named Saunders.  It seems that his face has been badly wounded and will need some more reconstruction in Tokyo.  How did this unfortunate young man receive his facial deformation?", "correct": "His rifle backfired", "options": ["He was it by enemy mortar fragments", "He was thrown from a jeep", "He came too close to an exploding landmine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis rifle backfired.\n\n\tColonel Potter fashions an odd looking facial bandage that covers Saunders' cheek, which he suggests will need further work when the young man is shipped to Tokyo.  Father Mulcahy suggests, 'He'll need a lot more than physical attention.  I'm afraid that kind of wound goes a lot deeper than the skin.'  This portends future trouble for Colonel Potter. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter sits with Saunders in the post-op tent.  Saunders complains that his life will never be the same now that he has received such a deforming wound.  He is especially concerned about his 'girl' back home.  What is her name?", "correct": "Linda", "options": ["Elizabeth", "Sally", "Jane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLinda.\n\n\tSaunders claims that he and Linda were voted the 'handsomest couple at Allerdice High School'.  To Linda, looks are very important, according to Saunders, and she will not want to be with someone whose face has been damaged as his has.  It seems to me that either Saunders has a very low opinion of his darling Linda, or she is a very superficial woman indeed. \n"}, {"text": "Back in the Swamp, BJ and Hawkeye seem to be having an effect on Charles, who continues hopelessly to play away at his instrument.  By the use of an electric fan and an interesting flapping motion with their shirts, they think they have overcome Charles with their stench.  How does Charles one-up the two of them?", "correct": "He uses a surgical mask", "options": ["He turns on a larger fan of his own", "He uses a pair of nose plugs", "He pulls his blanket over his head"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe uses a surgical mask.\n\n\tCharles is far too clever for them.  Having temporarily ceased playing his horn thanks to the mephitic stench protruding from the bodies of his tentmates, Charles dons a surgical mask fitted with a mouthhole suitable for blowing the French horn.  'We have met the enemy and we are his,' says a defeated Hawkeye.  \r Colonel Potter saves the day by entering the Swamp and ordering Charles to stop tooting his horn.  Charles leaves the Swamp in disgust at this point. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter has arrived at the Swamp in order to drown his sorrows with a drink, and perhaps chat with Hawkeye and BJ about Saunders.  Just as he begins talking of Saunders' problems, Klinger barges in and announces that Saunders has attempted suicide.  What form of suicide has he tried?", "correct": "Swallowing sleeping pills", "options": ["Eating poison", "Cutting his wrist", "Cutting off his IV"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwallowing sleeping pills.\n\n\tSaunders really has taken the damage to his vanity hard, and he displays his unhappiness most emphatically by stealing sleeping pills from the medical cabinet in the post-op.  Colonel Potter orders a 24-hour watch on Saunders from henceforth. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and BJ now approach the mess tent for some chow.  They come across a table set outside the tent and soon find out from Klinger that they are meant to eat alfresco.  Father Mulcahy passes by and comments on how charming their little tentside set-up is.  According to the good Father, it reminds him of a meal he had in which city?", "correct": "Rome", "options": ["Seoul", "San Francisco", "London"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRome.\n\n\tSpecifically, Father Mulcahy claims to have eaten at an outdoor restaurant in Rome along the Via Veneto while on a visit to see the pope.  When Hawkeye offers Father Mulcahy a chance to join them at their lovely little table, he declines.  BJ asks, 'Father, is it because we smell bad?'  Father Mulcahy replies clumsily, 'Well, uh...I, uh...oh dear.  Oh dear, how shall I put this?  Uh...yes, because of that.'  Hawkeye responds, 'Jesus ate with the lepers.'  Mulcahy retorts, 'He was an exceptionally good sport.' \n"}, {"text": "While the battle of the stink reaches epic proportions, Colonel Potter finds himself in the operating room where he has hunted down Private Saunders.  Once again, the lad is attempting suicide, this time by trying to shoot himself up with an overdose of morphine.  ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, Saunders attempts to asphyxiate himself to death using the anesthetizing gas (which wouldn't work, by the way; he would just pass out!)  Colonel Potter turns off the gas, but Saunders threatens that he will just find another way.  Potter uses reverse psychology on Saunders by pretending to force the gas mask on Saunders's face.  When Saunders fights back, Potter points out that the young lad obviously has the will to go on living. \n"}, {"text": "The final showdown between Winchester, BJ and Hawkeye happens outside the Swamp.  While Winchester continues to play happily away at his instrument, Hawkeye and BJ play a metal drum and a kazoo, respectively.  The discord attracts the entire camp, and the battle is soon ended.  Which of these happens first?", "correct": "Hawkeye and BJ are 'bathed'", "options": ["Charles' instrument is crushed", "Neither ever happen, so far as we can observe", "Both happen simultaneously"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye and BJ are 'bathed'.\n\n\tMargaret heroically leads the 4077th crowd towards the unsuspecting Swamp-rats, and has Klinger open fire on BJ and Hawkeye with a firehose.  She then orders a soapy sponge bath for the two doctors, a bath that Hawkeye especially enjoys.  Margaret then takes Winchester's French horn and has it crushed under the tire of a jeep.  Colonel Potter arrives too late to see the festivities, and retrieves Charles' flattened horn.  Rather than punish the 'Visigoths' and 'barbarians' (as Winchester puts it), Colonel Potter suggests a celebration at the Officers' Club 'for the duration of the whiskey'.  He suggests that the Swamp-dwellers will pay.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
