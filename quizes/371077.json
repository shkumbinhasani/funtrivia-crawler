{"id": "371077", "name": "I Spy...Kanto Quiz | Pokemon Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Pokemon Games", " Pokemon Red/ Blue/Yellow"], "questions": [{"text": "To slip into this building unnoticed would be quite difficult...unless you were one of the Ghost-type Pokemon frequenting the area.  In what Lavender Town landmark would you be able to fight Channellers and catch Gastly?", "correct": "Pokemon Tower", "options": ["Goldenrod Radio Tower", "Bell Tower", "Dragonspiral Tower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPokemon Tower.\n\n\tAppearing in several generations of the game, Pokemon Tower is Lavender Town's claim to fame in \"Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow\" because the town lacks a proper gym.  Instead, you can head up the different levels of this multi-story Pokemon cemetery to fight your way to the top and capture ghost-types Gastly and Haunter.  Near the bottom you'll face off against your rival; near the top you'll fight Team Rocket.  The building became Kanto's Radio Tower in later generations. \n"}, {"text": "You could delve into the darkness if you so chose, but rampant Geodude and Zubat would find you no problem...and then there would be the issue of your first Team Rocket battle.  Where would this be?", "correct": "Mt. Moon", "options": ["Bill's House", "Route 1", "Cerulean City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMt. Moon\n\n\tMt. Moon, east of Pewter City and a required stop on your trip through Kanto, is one of the largest underground expanses in \"Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow\", and it's especially interesting if your lead-in Pokemon is Pikachu, especially since his electric attacks will do nothing against rock-type Pokemon like Onix and Geodude.  Team Rocket is found near the very end.  It's also one of the only places in the game where you can find the Helix or Dome Fossils; you also have a higher chance of finding Moon Stones there. \n"}, {"text": "It's best not to let yourself slide into a disadvantageous state.  In which area of the game is there a clear downward slant, making it more difficult to travel north than it is to travel south?", "correct": "Cycling Road", "options": ["Rock Tunnel", "Victory Road", "Mt. Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCycling Road.\n\n\tThe Cycling Road is primarily found on Route 17, and while it's never a mandatory route by any means, it can feel quite exhilarating to start at the top, near Celadon City, and ride all the way to the bottom near Fuchsia City.  Remember though, the top part of the trail, at Route 16, is actually blocked by a Snorlax until you use the Pokemon Flute.  The route always leans to a southward slant, so anyone riding it will speed down in front of trainers and have a horrible slog riding back up if that's the route they wish to take. \n"}, {"text": "If you're looking for the cover of the dense wilderness, you wouldn't be able to find anywhere in Kanto larger than this early region known for its bug-type Pokemon and, if you're lucky, a wild Pikachu.  Where is it?", "correct": "Viridian Forest", "options": ["Tohjo Falls", "Route 20", "Cerulean Cape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViridian Forest.\n\n\tOne of the first expanses of Pokemon-heavy areas in Kanto, at least for a newer trainer, Viridian Forest is known for its bug-types and the frequency at which you'll end up fighting Pidgey.  If you head into the area in \"Pokemon Yellow\", it can be a good idea to train Caterpie/Metapod into Butterfree to take advantage of Psychic-type moves going into the battle against Brock in Pewter City.  In \"Pokemon Red and Blue\", you can also find Pikachu in the grasses within the forest, albeit rarely. \n"}, {"text": "It's best to avoid well-lit areas if you're planning to spy anywhere.  Where would you avoid going if you plan to avoid an overwhelming amount of Electric-type Pokemon? ", "correct": "Power Plant", "options": ["Professor Oak's Laboratory", "Saffron City", "Magnet Train"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPower Plant.\n\n\tThe Power Plant is a completely optional area in Kanto, but if you're into the idea of an all-Electric-type party, you'd be heading to the right place.  The area is filled with Voltorb, Electabuzz, and Magnemite, and if you head straight through to the end, it's the only location on the map where you'd be able to locate the legendary Electric bird Pokemon, Zapdos.  The Power Plant is at the end of Route 10, and can only be accessed if you use Surf to get to it.  It was abandoned before the events of \"Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\". \n"}, {"text": "To gather all of your spy gear you'd be best to stop in at a Department Store.  Where would this be possible?", "correct": "Celadon City", "options": ["Saffron City", "Cerulean City", "Fuchsia City "], "explanation": "\n\n\nCeladon City.\n\n\tCeladon City, found west of the largest city on the map (Saffron City), is quite the unique place in that a lot of great to-dos can be checked of your list upon arriving.  The Game Center, home to Team Rocket and a slew of slot machines, is in the center of town; the fourth gym, home to Erika, allows you to face off against grass-types; you can get an Eevee in one of the houses.  Perhaps most important is the Department Store, home to almost everything you'd need to accomplish your goals from TMs to evolutionary stones to...well...lemonade.  It's up to you! \n"}, {"text": "If you seek to spy on the elite, then you should probably look to the four trainers who head the Pokemon League.  Where would you fight these four and, inevitably, the Pokemon Master?", "correct": "Indigo Plateau", "options": ["Victory Road", "Tohjo Falls", "Pallet Town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndigo Plateau.\n\n\tThe Elite Four, as they're known, are the penultimate step on the way to becoming a Pokemon Master, so heading up there would be the wisest move if you wanted in at the top.  Arriving at the Indigo Plateau, you would face off against ice-type trainer Lorelei, rock/fighting-type trainer Bruno, poison/ghost-type trainer Agatha, and dragon-type trainer Lance, but that's not the end of the road.  Following these four one would, no doubt, need to face off against their rival who, in a moment of foresight, got to the end of the game moments before you. \n"}, {"text": "You'd be wise, if you're looking for loot, to go for the most powerful item in the land.  If you wanted to get a Master Ball, where would you need to go?", "correct": "Silph Co.", "options": ["Pokemon Mansion", "Victory Road", "Unknown Dungeon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilph Co.\n\n\tThere's only one Master Ball in Kanto, and to get it you'd need to sneak into the office at the very top of the massive Silph Co. building in the middle of Saffron City.  Of course, anyone visiting Silph Co. for the first time would know that it's not too safe.  In fact, sneaking in requires masterful work because Team Rocket inhabits the bulk of the building, taking up nearly every hallway and boardroom on its eleven floors.  On the top floor, in the President's Office, Giovanni is faced for a second time. \n"}, {"text": "It's a good idea to train in the wilderness, immersing yourself in the environment.  Where would you be able to hide out...at least for five hundred paces?", "correct": "Safari Zone", "options": ["Cinnabar Island", "Route 1", "Mount Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSafari Zone.\n\n\tSafari Zone, an enclosed region north of Fuchsia City, is the sole home of a number of different species (Tauros, Kangaskhan, and others, for instance), but catching them is a bit tougher than one would expect, mainly because it's not possible to unleash your own Pokemon to fight them in the nature reserve.  In fact, the only options when you come across them in battle are to throw bait or rocks, run, or throw a Safari Ball...which won't always work as intended.  It's the only region in Kanto to have such stipulations. \n"}, {"text": "There's no better spot for a spy hideaway than a group of isolated islands.  Pick your spot between two halves of Route 20; what's its name?", "correct": "Seafoam Islands", "options": ["S.S. Anne", "Cerulean Cape", "Diglett's Cave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeafoam Islands.\n\n\tRoute 20 stretches through the waters on the south end of Kanto from Fuchsia City to Cinnabar Island, and between them are a series of small islands, the Seafoam Islands, which likely won't get too much tourist traffic.  In fact, within the islands you'd be hard-pressed to find trainers of any sort, though Pokemon will undoubtedly run rampant through its caverns and waterways.  The site is also the home of legendary bird Pokemon Articuno. \n"}]}
