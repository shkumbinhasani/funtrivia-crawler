{"id": "203077", "name": "\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,\" Season Six Quiz | Television | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine", "Episodes"], "questions": [{"text": "In the season premiere, \"A Time to Stand\", Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) and most of his crew use a purloined Jem'Hadar ship to invade the territory of the Dominion, with whom they are at war.  Sisko, as captain of the alien ship, wears an unusual headset that allows him to see where the ship is going, even though there are no windows or viewscreens aboard the ship.  The headset, though, causes him to experience intense headaches.  Who volunteers to act as Sisko's back-up, and wears the headset for him whenever the pain grows too great?", "correct": "Garak (Andrew J. Robinson)", "options": ["Bashir (Alexander Siddig)", "Worf (Michael Dorn)", "Nog (Aron Eisenberg)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarak (Andrew J. Robinson)\n\n\tGarak notes that, as a Cardassian, he is probably better equipped to wear the Jem'Hadar headset.  He too, though, experiences discomfort after wearing it for a while. \n"}, {"text": "Worf's son Alexander appears in the episode \"Sons and Daughters\", and it's the first time he's been seen since his semi-regular appearances on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".  True or False:  The same actor who played Alexander on \"TNG\" plays Alexander in this \"DS9\" episode.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBrian Bonsall -- perhaps best known for playing Andy Keaton, the youngest child on the popular 80's sitcom \"Family Ties\" -- played Alexander most of the time on \"TNG.\"  On \"DS9\", however, Alexander is played by Marc Worden. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following events occurs in the episode \"Rocks and Shoals\"?", "correct": "A Vorta betrays the Jem'Hadar who serve him.", "options": ["Kira (Nana Visitor) betrays Odo (Rene Auberjonois).", "A Jem'Hadar betrays the Vorta he serves.", "Odo (Rene Auberjonois) betrays Kira (Nana Visitor)."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Vorta betrays the Jem'Hadar who serve him.\n\n\tWhile Odo arguably betrays Kira later in the season once he finds himself \"hexed\" by the female shapeshifter, nothing like that happens in this episode.  In fact, it's in this episode that Odo and Kira agree to start a new resistance against the Dominion and the Cardassians.\r After both Sisko's stolen Jem'Hadar warship and the warship pursuing them crash-land on the same planet, the Jem'Hadar soldiers are betrayed by their critically injured Vorta leader, who happily tells Sisko how to kill them all at once, just to end the conflict quickly and guarantee his own survival as a prisoner of war.  What a tool. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Behind the Lines\", Sisko is given a new assignment that removes him from the captain's chair of the USS DEFIANT.  Who commands the ship in his place?", "correct": "Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell)", "options": ["Chief Miles Edward O'Brien (Colm Meaney)", "Admiral Bill Ross (Barry Jenner)", "Lt. Commander Worf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLt. Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell)\n\n\tAdmiral Ross makes Sisko his new adjutant, and Dax takes over the DEFIANT.  She does an admirable job, and even though she holds the rank of Lieutenant Commander, she is referred to as \"Captain\" by the crew, as per naval tradition. \n"}, {"text": "Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo) finds relations with his daughter, Tora Ziyal (Melanie Smith), quite strained in \"Favor the Bold\".  Whom does he ask to intercede on his behalf and convince his daughter to reconcile with him?", "correct": "Glinn Damar (Casey Biggs)", "options": ["Quark (Armin Shimmerman)", "Odo", "Kira"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlinn Damar (Casey Biggs).\n\n\tZiyal is at odds with her father about his refusal to show mercy toward political prisoner Rom (Max Grodenchik), so Dukat orders his subordinate Damar to convince her that his cause is just, and that she would do well to side with her father in all things.  Ironically, Damar murders Ziyal in cold blood in the very next episode! \n"}, {"text": "Tora Ziyal dies in \"Sacrifice of Angels\".  How does she meet her end?", "correct": "She is killed by Glinn Damar.", "options": ["She accidentally drinks poison meant for her father, Gul Dukat.", "She is killed by her father, Gul Dukat.", "She willingly commits suicide."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe is killed by Glinn Damar.\n\n\tDamar shoots Ziyal dead, ostensibly as an execution of sorts brought about by her \"seditious\" behavior.  Dukat is driven to the brink of insanity by the death of his daughter. \n"}, {"text": "Before the wedding of Dax and Worf takes place in \"You Are Cordially Invited,\" Worf invites several men aboard the station to join him in his \"Kal'Hyah\", the Klingon version of a bachelor party.  Which of the following characters is among the invited?", "correct": "Bashir", "options": ["Quark", "The are all invited", "Jake Sisko"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBashir.\n\n\tWorf asks Martok, Benjamin Sisko, Dr. Bashir, and Chief O'Brien to participate in the Kal'Hyah.  Jake is a bit too young, and Worf pretty much hates Quark's guts. \n"}, {"text": "Which dead character's \"mirror universe\" doppleganger is the focus of the episode \"Resurrection\"?", "correct": "Vedek Bareil (Philip Anglim)", "options": ["Commander Cal Hudson (Bernie Casey)", "Kai Opaka (Camille Saviola)", "Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVedek Bareil (Philip Anglim).\n\n\tMajor Kira falls right into the trap designed by her own doppelganger when the \"mirror universe\" duplicate of her dead lover, Bareil Antos, shows up on the station with an agenda she never suspects.  As always, Kira's duplicate is creepy and twisted! \n"}, {"text": "In \"Statistical Probabilities\", Dr. Bashir meets four people who, like himself, have been genetically enhanced.  Unlike Bashir, though, these people suffer from personality disorders that set them apart from most of society, despite their brilliance.\n\nAfter spending some time together and studying statistical data, Bashir and the \"enhanced\" quartet come up with a conclusion that makes Starfleet Command very unhappy.  What is it?", "correct": "The Federation can not possibly win the war with the Dominion.", "options": ["Section 31 controls the majority of Federation lawmakers.", "The Bajoran Prophets are not gods, but merely \"wormhole aliens\".", "The Klingons' alliance with the Federation is a lie."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Federation can not possibly win the war with the Dominion.\n\n\tBashir advises Captain Sisko that the Federation should surrender to the Dominion in order to keep the casualty list at millions instead of billions.  Sisko flatly refuses...and given how the war eventually turns out, it's a good thing that he did! \n"}, {"text": "A Vorta is accidentally killed in \"The Magnificent Ferengi\".  Which one?", "correct": "Keevan (from \"Rocks and Shoals\")", "options": ["Yelgrun (from \"The Magnificent Ferengi\")", "Eris (from \"The Jem'Hadar\")", "Borath (from \"The Search\")"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeevan (from \"Rocks and Shoals\").\n\n\tKeevan (Christopher Shea) was the Vorta who happily sacrificed the lives of the Jem'Hadar soldiers under his command in the episode \"Rocks and Shoals\".  His dying words after being accidentally shot are, \"I hate Ferengi.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Waltz\" primarily concerns itself with the relationship between two characters.  Which ones?", "correct": "Sisko and Dukat", "options": ["Sisko and Kasidy Yates (Penny Johnson)", "Kira and Dukat", "Kira and Odo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSisko and Dukat.\n\n\t\"Waltz\" does an excellent job of underscoring the depths of Gul Dukat's insanity.  He and Sisko find themselves trapped in a cavern for a protracted period of time, and we see that Dukat's inner demons, interestingly enough, visit him much in the same manner that the Bajoran Prophets force themselves into Sisko's consciousness.\r At the end of this episode, Sisko more or less foreshadows the final episode by saying, \"It's him or me.\" \n"}, {"text": "At long last, Morn (Mark Shepherd) speaks a line of dialogue in the only episode whose title references his name, \"Who Mourns For Morn?\".", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNope!  The funny thing about Morn was that, although many characters made references to (and even complained about) his loquacious nature, the viewers never heard Morn speak a single word in the series' seven-year run.\r Executive Producer Ira Steven Behr and other \"DS9\" bigwigs have admitted that this affectation was a nod to the fact that legendary \"Cheers\" character Norm (whose name is an anagram for fellow barfly Morn, of course) had a wife who, although frequently mentioned, was never, in the eleven seasons of that show, seen clearly. \n"}, {"text": "The runabout RUBICON undergoes a \"shrinking experiment\" in the episode \"One Little Ship\".  Who is NOT aboard the RUBICON when it shrinks to the size of the plastic model kit that you and I can buy at the local hobby shop?", "correct": "Worf", "options": ["Dax", "Bashir", "O'Brien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorf.\n\n\tDax, O'Brien, and Bashir are the lucky crewmembers who find themselves reduced in size in this episode.  Worf remains aboard the DEFIANT, straining against the presence of the Jem'Hadar who have taken over the ship. \n"}, {"text": "\"Far Beyond the Stars\", one of my favorite episodes, is mostly set in 1950's New York...or, arguably, Sisko's hallucinations of that setting.  This episode contained a number of \"firsts\" for the numerous \"Star Trek\" televison series.  Which of the following things did NOT happen for the first time in \"Far Beyond the Stars\"?", "correct": "Cigarettes are smoked on screen.", "options": ["A racial slur that rhymes with the word \"trigger\" is spoken by a character.", "A mild curse that rhymes with \"clap\" and refers to excrement is spoken by a character.", "All of these things happened for the first time in this episode."], "explanation": "\n\n\nCigarettes are smoked on screen.\n\n\tBoth of the words mentioned above -- the racial slur and the mild curse referring to excrement -- are spoken (in the 1953 setting) for the first time ever in the \"Star Trek\" televised mythos.  \r Several characters smoke cigarettes in this episode, but we'd seen that before, in the \"ST: TNG\" episode \"The Big Goodbye\" (which featured Captain Picard's \"Dixon Hill\" holodeck prgram, set in the era of 1940's Earth), the fourth-season \"DS9\" episode \"Little Green Men\" (set in 1950's Earth), and even in an episode or two of the original \"Star Trek\" series, if I recall correctly. \n"}, {"text": "Chief O'Brien is given the difficult task of going undercover to get information from a criminal in \"Honor Among Thieves\".  For what organization does Bilby (Nick Tate), the criminal in question, work?", "correct": "The Orion Syndicate", "options": ["The Maquis", "The Tal'Shiar", "The Obsidian Order"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Orion Syndicate.\n\n\tBilby is an arms dealer for the Orion Syndicate, which seems to be the equivalent of the 20th-century Mafia.  O'Brien finds himself liking Bilby, and having second thoughts about setting him up...but even after he confesses to Bilby that he is a Starfleet operative, Bilby walks right into certain death in order to ensure his family's survival.  It's a sad episode! \n"}, {"text": "The episode \"Change of Heart\" gets its title from the dilemma of a major character who, appropriately enough, changes his or her mind in the climax of the of the show.  Who is it?", "correct": "Worf", "options": ["Dax", "Sisko", "Kira"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorf.\n\n\tWorf and Dax are assigned to meet a Cardassian double agent deep in the jungle of a dangerous planet in order to receive a critical intelligence report.  Along the way, Dax is critically injured, and at first, she convinces Worf to leave her behind in the jungle to die, so that he can meet the double agent and retrieve the intel that could potentially save millions of lives.  He initially agrees with her logic, but at the last moment, Worf changes his mind (and heart) and doubles back, choosing to save his wife's life as opposed to saving the lives of millions of strangers.\r Sisko later notes that Worf's decision will probably prevent him from ever reaching the rank of captain...but he adds that, as a man who once had a wife, he would probably have done the same thing.  Powerful stuff! \n"}, {"text": "In \"Wrongs Darker Than Death or Night\", Gul Dukat tells Kira Nerys that he was romantically involved her mother during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor.  True or False: His claim is a lie.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tKira uses the Orb of Time to travel back about thirty years, and sees for herself that Dukat's claim is true.  Kira Meru (Leslie Hope) became Dukat's consort in order to assure the continued safety of her husband and three children...including little Kira Nerys. \n"}, {"text": "Which character finds himself repeatedly and illegally interrogated in the episode \"Inquisition\"?", "correct": "Bashir", "options": ["O'Brien", "Worf", "Sisko"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBashir.\n\n\tBashir is targeted by the mysterious Sloan (William Sadler), a representative of the even more mysterious \"Section 31\", a more-top-secret-than-top-secret-can-get branch of Starfleet Intelligence.  By the end of the episode, Sloan tries to recruit Bashir into the ranks of Section 31.  He refuses, but Sisko tells the good doctor that the next time Sloan asks him to join up, he is under orders to say \"yes\"! \n"}, {"text": "A guilt-ridden Sisko more or less narrates \"In the Pale Moonlight\", an episode that depicts Sisko's efforts to bring a new ally into the Federation's war against the Dominion.  Who?", "correct": "the Romulans", "options": ["the Klingons", "the Breen", "the Vulcans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe Romulans.\n\n\tThe Vulcans and the Klingons are already acting in concert with the United Federation of Planets in the Dominion War.  The Breen remain a wild card throughout this season, but would actually ally themselves with the Dominion, not the UFP, in season seven.  \r Sisko -- with some seriously underhanded assistance from Garak -- manages to get the Romulans to forge an alliance with the UFP and side against the Dominion.  An excellent episode, and a grim reminder of the quote \"It's easy to be a saint in paradise.\"  Sisko gets his hands dirty this time...dirtier than we've ever seen them.  Such is war. \n"}, {"text": "Odo seeks advice from holographic nightclub singer Vic Fontaine in \"His Way\".  Odo is unsure what to do about his feelings for Kira, so Vic tries to set him on the path to romance.  At one point, Vic generates a holographic Kira lookalike named Lola Chrystal who sings a number while Odo (sort of) accompanies her on the piano.  What classic song does Lola sing with (and TO, really) Odo?", "correct": "Fever", "options": ["Makin' Whoopee", "I've Got You Under My Skin", "Blue Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFever.\n\n\tLola (played, of course, by Nana Visitor) sings the torch song \"Fever\".  And yes, that's really Visitor's singing voice! \n"}, {"text": "A major character is possessed by a \"pah-wraith\" -- an energy-being similar to (and at war with) the Bajoran Prophets -- in \"The Reckoning.\"  True or False:  This episode is the first time we learn of the existence of pah-wraiths.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe first we ever heard of the pah-wraiths was in the fifth-season episode \"The Assignment,\" in which Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao) was possessed by one...although not in as dramatic or deadly a fashion as Jake Sisko was possessed in \"The Reckoning.\" \n"}, {"text": "The episode \"Valiant\" is named for the USS VALIANT, a DEFIANT-class Federation starship.  What is unusual about the VALIANT?", "correct": "It is manned entirely by Starfleet cadets.", "options": ["It is from an alternate dimension.", "It is manned entirely by Vulcans.", "It is from the future."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is manned entirely by Starfleet cadets.\n\n\tJake and Nog find themselves rescued by the VALIANT, only to learn that no actual Starfleet officers are aboard.  The ship was launched in order to provide an advanced training/recon mission for Red Squad, the finest cadets at Starfleet Academy, but all actual officers were killed in the line of duty, leaving no one but the cadets on board.  Red Squad decided to continue their mission, and they do pretty well for themselves...until the end of this episode, when the ship is destroyed and most of her crew are killed. \n"}, {"text": "\"Time's Orphan\" centers around an unusual time-travel accident that results in a character finding him/herself ten years older than he/she should be.  Who is it?", "correct": "Molly O'Brien", "options": ["Nog", "Jake Sisko", "Kirayoshi O'Brien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMolly O'Brien.\n\n\tEight-year-old Molly falls into a Bajoran time portal of sorts, and by the time she can be retrieved, hours later, she is a very confused eighteen-year-old woman.  It all turns out well at the end, though -- The O'Briens get their eight-year-old Molly back, thanks to the actions of 18-year-old Molly, who then ceases to exist.  (Man, time travel gives me a headache.) \n"}, {"text": "The crew of the USS DEFIANT respond to an audio-only distress call and race to rescue the woman who sent it in \"The Sound of Her Voice\".  What is the rank of Lisa Cusak, the woman in question?", "correct": "Captain", "options": ["None of these -- Lisa Cusak is not a Starfleet officer", "Commander", "Lieutenant Commander"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain.\n\n\tLisa Cusak (voiced by the talented comedian Debra Wilson) was the captain of the starship OLYMPIA, which was destroyed.  Her escape pod landed on a planet with a less-than-suitable atmosphere to sustain human life, so time was running out for her throughout her communications with the DEFIANT during its six-day journey to reach her.\r Time, in fact, was long gone by the time DEFIANT even picked up her first signal.  Watch the episode to see what that means! \n"}, {"text": "By the end of the season finale, \"Tears of the Prophets,\" Benjamin Sisko has left DS9 and is home, on Earth.  What is he doing in the very last shot of the episode?", "correct": "scrubbing clams", "options": ["playing baseball", "washing dishes", "playing the piano"], "explanation": "\n\n\nscrubbing clams.\n\n\tSisko, having lost his faith in the Prophets, his effectiveness as a Starfleet officer, and pretty much everything else, heads for home with his tail between his legs.  He returns to familiar territory (his father's restaurant in New Orleans) and familiar duties: scrubbing clams on the stoop outside the restaurant's kitchen.  Kind of a depressing final shot of the season, huh?\r Three more seasons for me to cover, so let me know if you want to see more! \n"}]}
