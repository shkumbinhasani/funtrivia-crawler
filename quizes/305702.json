{"id": "305702", "name": "'Super Smash Bros. Brawl' - Snake's Take Quiz / Test  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Super Smash Brothers Games", "Super Smash Bros. Brawl"], "questions": [{"text": "When confronted by this slow-moving and rather friendly (but androgynous) creature, Snake asks Otacon, what this 'lizard thing' is that likes to lay eggs and throw them, too. Who are they talking about?", "correct": "Yoshi", "options": ["Charizard", "Meta Knight", "Lucas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoshi.\n\n\tSnake says he can't tell if Yoshi is male or female, but Otacon assures him he's all male...at least, that's what Yoshi says. \rSince his debut in 'Super Mario World' (SNES), Yoshi has made his way into a number of multi-character games like 'Mario Party', 'Mario Kart' and the 'Super Smash Bros.' series.  Snake and Otacon later joke about catching one to see what they taste like. Yecchh! \n"}, {"text": "Snake is awestruck as he tells Otacon he's in the presence of 'F-Zero pilot number 07!'. Who are they drooling over?", "correct": "Captain Falcon", "options": ["Samus Aran", "Marth", "Fox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Falcon.\n\n\tCaptain Falcon is the star of the racing game 'F-Zero' (Super Nintendo), its N64 follow-up, 'F-Zero X', and subsequent games. He is almost revered by Snake and Otacon for his famous catch phrases like 'Falcon Puuuuuuunch' and 'Falcon Kiiiiiiick'. \n"}, {"text": "Snake is honored by the presence of this sibling of a Nintendo icon, but the Colonel thinks the title 'King of Second Bananas' is more of a put-down. What character are they at odds over? ", "correct": "Luigi", "options": ["Mario", "Wario", "Diddy Kong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuigi.\n\n\tLuigi actually appeared at the same time as his brother, Mario, world-known as the official mascot of the Nintendo Corporation. He began as Mario's 'palette swap' (basically the same character, but with different colored clothing) in the original 'Donkey Kong' video game in 1981, but entered into his own in the first 'Mario Bros' (NES). Since then, he claimed plenty of games to his own credit including 'Mario Is Missing' (NES) and 'Luigi's Mansion' (GameCube). Wario didn't make his debut till 1992. \n"}, {"text": "Although both Snake and the Colonel freely admit this diminutive character is 'a good kid', they also know he has 'psi abilities that defy all scientific explanation'. Who are they talking about?", "correct": "Ness", "options": ["Link", "Pit", "The Ice Climbers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNess.\n\n\tNess is a character in 'Earthbound', based on the Japanese game 'Mother 2: Gyiyg no Gyakush\u00fb' (both Super Nintendo games). Ness is one of the 'Chosen Four' (along with fellow characters Paula, Jeff Andonuts and Poo), known for his love of all things American. He has a dog named King and is known to get an allowance from his dad to continue his adventures. He also bears an uncanny resemblance to Lucas, who first appeared in 'Mother 3' (GameBoy Advance) in 2006. \n"}, {"text": "Regarding this character, Mei Ling tells Snake the lesson of the ancient tale, 'The Vain Ocean of Wealth and Splendor' (from the Zhen Zhong Ji), indicating that even if this guy's companions, or 'pikmin', are killed, they have a tendency to come back. Who are they talking about?", "correct": "Captain Olimar", "options": ["Lucario", "King Dedede", "Ike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Olimar.\n\n\tOlimar, from the game 'Pikmin' (Nintendo GameCube), is captain of the S.S. Dolphin, from where he works for the Hocotate Freight Company. On an unnamed planet, he finds small dime-sized little creatures he calls 'Pikmin', who are individually weak (and quite edible), but make good company in large numbers. In the second game 'Pikmin 2', Olimar is joined by a crewman named Louie (both names are intentional partial anagrams of 'Mario' and 'Luigi').\rAll Snake can say after Mei Ling's story is, 'I'm waiting for the movie'. \n"}, {"text": "Snake thinks he 'looks like some cheap movie monster', but the Colonel warns he is the heaviest fighter in this game...by far. Who are they talking about?", "correct": "Bowser", "options": ["Donkey Kong", "Jigglypuff", "Ganondorf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowser.\n\n\tBowser, also known as Koopa or King Koopa in Japan, has been the main enemy of Mario and scourge of the Mushroom Kingdom since making his debut in 'Super Mario Bros. (NES) in 1985. Larger than the rest of the turtle-like Koopas, he has the added danger of spikes and sharp teeth. In the movie version of 'Super Mario Brothers' (1993), he is portrayed by Dennis Hopper. \n"}, {"text": "Snake really doesn't know what to make of this guy. He tells Otacon, 'There's a guy walking around here...and he's two dimensional'. This sends Otacon off on the ins and outs of 1980s software and the use of large-scale integrated circuits on a monochrome LCD display. Who are they referring to?", "correct": "Mr. Game & Watch", "options": ["Kirby", "Wolf", "Toon Link"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Game & Watch\n\n\tThe term 'Toon Link' actually refers to Link's more cartoon-based shape that started with GameCube's 'Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker'. \rMr. Game and Watch was a character in the 'Game and Watch' handheld games that were produced by Nintendo from 1980 until 1991. Besides enjoying a game, the units also featured a clock and alarm. This might explain why Mr. Game and Watch does not speak, but only makes beeps and whistles. Snake closes Otacon's tech discussion with 'This is making my head hurt'. \n"}, {"text": "Snake has serious reservations about fighting anyone in a dress, but the Colonel warns him this is not a time for pickup lines...this lady's punches 'are backed by magic that can cut to the bone'. Who is she? ", "correct": "Zelda", "options": ["Princess Peach", "Zero Suit Samus", "Jigglypuff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZelda.\n\n\tZelda, the long-time object of Link's affection, is the Princess of the mythical kingdom of Hyrule. She is often at the mercy of the main antagonist, Gannon (or Ganondorf), but is usually able to lend Link a hand at some point in his quest. Beginning with 'The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time' (N64), she is also able to change to the mysterious fighter Sheik.\rSnake has less respect for Peach, telling Mei Ling if Mario was smart, he'd tell this girl to stop getting kidnapped. Mei Ling's reply: 'You don't get a lot of dates, do you, Snake?' \n"}, {"text": "Despite Otacon's obvious excitement at this blue-haired character's inclusion in Wii's 'Super Smash Bros. Brawl', Snake has an obvious dislike for him, saying 'There's something about him that just rubs me the wrong way'. Who are they referring to?", "correct": "Sonic", "options": ["R.O.B.", "Yoshi", "Sheik"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSonic.\n\n\tPerhaps the reason for the animocity may lie in the fact that both Snake (from Konami) and Sonic (Sega's mascot) are the only non-Nintendo characters in the 'Brawl' game. Debuting in 1991, Sonic was one of the first characters entered into the San Francisco Metreon Mall's 'Walk of Game', along with Mario and Link. \n"}, {"text": "Mei Ling wants to take this cute 'little yellow thing' home with her, but Snake whines, 'Give me a break! What do I look like...a Pok\u00e9mon trainer?'. Obviously, he is quite aware of the electricity that can come blasting from his 'cute little cheeks'. Who or what is it?", "correct": "Pikachu", "options": ["Charizard", "Squirtle", "Jigglypuff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPikachu.\n\n\tAll of the choices are Pok\u00e9mon (or 'pocket monsters', as translated from the Japanese), but Pikachu is perhaps the most recognized. He (and the others) were created by Satoshi Tajiri and first appeared in video game form on the Nintendo GameBoy in 1996 . Thank you for playing my quiz! \n"}]}
