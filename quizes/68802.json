A glitch in the adaptation process, perhaps? \n"}, {"text": "How long has Vern (Jerry O'Connell) been looking for the jar of pennies under his porch?", "correct": "nine months", "options": ["seven months", "five months", "eleven months"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnine months.\n\n\tNarrator: 'Nine months, man. You didn't know whether to laugh or cry.' \n"}, {"text": "Which of the four boys, as far as we know, does not have an older brother?", "correct": "Teddy", "options": ["Chris", "They all do", "Vern"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeddy.\n\n\tChris Chambers' brother Eyeball and Vern Tessio's brother Billy are both members of Ace Merrill's gang. There's never a mention of Teddy having any siblings at all. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a toughie. Denny LaChance (John Cusack), the late older brother of Gordie (Wil Wheaton), was something of a local football star. What was the number on his high school jersey?", "correct": "19", "options": ["49", "29", "39"], "explanation": "\n\n\n19.\n\n\tBlink and you miss it, but when Gordie is looking around Denny's room for his canteen, we see a quick shot of a framed photo of Denny in his football uniform. The number 19 is clearly emblazoned on his chest. \n"}, {"text": "We're shown a flashback scene in which Denny gives Gordie a baseball cap. The logo of what team is on the cap?", "correct": "the New York Yankees", "options": ["the New York Mets", "the Boston Red Sox", "the Philadelphia Phillies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe New York Yankees.\n\n\tGordie: 'Hey, this is your Yankee cap!' Denny: 'No -- it's *your* Yankee cap.' \n"}, {"text": "Which member of Ace Merrill's gang is briefly seen wearing Gordie's beloved baseball cap?", "correct": "Eyeball", "options": ["Billy", "Ace himself", "Charlie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEyeball.\n\n\tAce (Kiefer Sutherland) is the one who snatches the cap off of Gordie's head, but he immediately tosses it to Eyeball, who puts it on his own head -- backwards, no less. The cap is never mentioned again, which is rather odd considering a) its importance to Gordie, and b) the fact that late in the film, Gordie has Ace's entire gang at gunpoint, and could presumably force them to return it...but only if they had it with them, of course. \n"}, {"text": "Chris (River Phoenix) 'borrows' his father's gun to bring along on the trip. What caliber ammunition does the pistol take?", "correct": ".45", "options": [".22", ".38", ".357"], "explanation": "\n\n\n.45\n\n\tChris: 'It's a .45.' Gordie: 'I can see that.' \n"}, {"text": "How many times is Chris' father's gun fired in the movie?", "correct": "two", "options": ["three", "one", "none"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwo.\n\n\tGordie is the only person in the film to fire the gun at all, and he does so twice. The first time is an accident -- Gordie has been told that it's unloaded, but when he pulls the trigger, he actually fires a round into a garbage can behind the Blue Point Diner. Then, at the climax of the film, Gordie fires a second round into the air -- a warning shot, to keep Ace Merrill from taking a knife to Chris' throat. \n"}, {"text": "There's some discussion about the time that Teddy (Corey Feldman) nearly fell out of a tree. It's strongly suggested that the fall would have killed him had it not been for the timely intervention of a certain individual. Who caught Teddy by his hair and saved him from falling out of that tree?", "correct": "Chris", "options": ["Gordie", "Vern", "Teddy's father"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChris.\n\n\tChris goes on to say that sometimes he dreams about that incident...but in his dreams, he fails to catch Teddy, and comes away with just a handful of hair. \n"}, {"text": "There's a mildly grisly scene in which one member of Ace's gang is carving the word 'Cobra' (and a small snake-like symbol) into the shoulder of another with a razor blade. Which of the following sentences accurately describes the scene?", "correct": "Eyeball is giving a tattoo.", "options": ["Billy is giving a tattoo.", "Ace is giving a tattoo.", "Charlie is giving a tattoo."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEyeball is giving a tattoo.\n\n\tI guess tattoo parlors were hard to come by in 1959. \n"}, {"text": "In Gordie's campfire story about Davy Hogan and the ultimate revenge plan, we see Davy preparing for the 'barf-o-rama' by drinking an entire bottle of castor oil before the pie-eating contest. How many raw eggs does he swallow after drinking the oil?", "correct": "one & 1", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\none & 1.\n\n\tYou'd think the oil would be enough, but Davy chases it with a single raw egg. \n"}, {"text": "What kind of pies are served at the pie-eating contest where Davy Hogan hatches his big plan?", "correct": "blueberry", "options": ["peach", "apple", "cherry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nblueberry.\n\n\tThe color of the pie innards is a clear hint on its own, but Gordie goes on to say that Davy 'suddenly imagined he was eating cow flops and rat guts in blueberry sauce,' and also that Davy's, um, projectile stream contained 'five pies worth of used blueberries.' Yuck. \n"}, {"text": "Teddy likes Gordie's story, except for the ending. If Teddy had his way, what assemblage would Davy Hogan go on to join after the events of the pie-eating contest?", "correct": "The Texas Rangers", "options": ["The United States Army", "The Foreign Legion", "The United States Marine Corps"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Texas Rangers.\n\n\tTeddy: 'You know -- something *good* like that!' \n"}, {"text": "Finish this quote from Gordie: 'I *knew* 'The $64,000 Question' had to be fixed. There's no way anybody could know that much about ________.'", "correct": "opera", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nopera.\n\n\tGordie goes on to criticize 'Wagon Train' as well, which is a little ironic: Gene Roddenberry pitched the original 'Star Trek' to NBC as 'Wagon Train' in space,' and Wil Wheaton (Gordie) would later join the cast of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' as Wesley Crusher. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the two boys come very close to being hit by a train while crossing a long bridge?", "correct": "Vern and Gordie", "options": ["Vern and Teddy", "Chris and Gordie", "Teddy and Chris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVern and Gordie.\n\n\tTeddy and Chris are significantly ahead of Vern and Gordie on the bridge, since Vern insists on crawling rather than walking, and Gordie doesn't want to leave Vern too far behind, for some reason. Vern's lucky that Gordie lagged behind with him -- it's Gordie who manages to tackle Vern right off of the bridge, just in time to avoid what Teddy would call 'El Smacko.' \n"}, {"text": "Finish this Teddy quote, as he is imitating Charlie Hogan in a rather girlish voice: 'Oh, Billy! I wish we'd never boosted that car! Oh, Billy -- I just turned my Fruit of the Looms into a ______________!'", "correct": "fudge factory", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nfudge factory.\n\n\tA rather colorful metaphor...and in the face of danger, even. Nicely done, Teddy. \n"}, {"text": "What day of the week is it when the boys finally return home from their life-changing journey?", "correct": "Sunday", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSunday.\n\n\tThe narrator states that they returned to Castle Rock 'the day before Labor Day,' and Labor Day always takes place on a Monday. \n"}, {"text": "The theme song from 'Have Gun, Will Travel' is sung several times during the film. Which of the boys is never heard singing it all by himself?", "correct": "Gordie", "options": ["Vern", "None of these", "Teddy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGordie.\n\n\tAfter the incident with Milo Pressman, Vern starts to sing the song to cheer up Teddy, but no one joins in. As Teddy walks off toward his home at the end of the film, he can be heard singing it to himself in the distance. Early in the film, all four boys sing the song together, but Gordie is never heard singing it alone. \n"}, {"text": "According to the narrator, how many children does the adult Vern have?", "correct": "four & 4", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nfour & 4.\n\n\tThe adult Vern, we're also told, is a forklift operator by trade. \n"}, {"text": "We see the narrator -- the adult Gordie Lachance, of course -- typing the last few lines of the story he's been telling us. What is the last word that he types?", "correct": "'anyone'", "options": ["'me'", "'forever'", "'friends'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'anyone'.\n\n\tThe last paragraph on Gordie's screen reads: 'I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, did anyone?' These lines also appear, almost word for word, in Stephen King's 'The Body,' appropriately enough. \n"}]}
