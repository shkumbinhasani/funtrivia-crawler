{"id": "403782", "name": "Living Well is the Best Revenge Quiz | Entertainment | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Entertainment by Themes"], "questions": [{"text": "Commonly found as a treasure chest, a Mimic is a neutral aberration first introduced in what tabletop role-playing game?", "correct": "Dungeons & Dragons", "options": ["Call of Cthulhu", "Warhammer", "RuneQuest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDungeons & Dragons.\n\n\tAlthough Mimics appear in many role-playing game monster compendiums, their appearance in Gary Gygax's original 1977 \"Monster Manual\" for \"Dungeons & Dragons\" is probably the most memorable.  Mimics can be virtually any inanimate object though the common trope is for them to appear as wooden or stone objects (treasure chests are typical).  Mimics returned in every subsequent edition of the game taking on different variant forms (think bigger-- Space Mimics can be found between planets!) and having analogs in other tabletop RPG systems. \n"}, {"text": "Candlesticks, clocks, wardrobes, and tea sets fight off a mob in provincial France in what famous Disney movie?", "correct": "Beauty and the Beast", "options": ["Ratatouille", "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", "Frozen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeauty and the Beast.\n\n\tDue to a witch's curse, the people of the Beast's castle were transformed into humdrum furniture before the start of \"Beauty in the Beast\" (based on the fairy tale \"La Belle et la B\u00eate\").  During Belle's stay at the castle, for the most part, the furniture waits on her much like they did in their human lives though during the siege on the castle in the story's climax, they fight back against the French mob that storms in on the building. When the curse is broken by true love's kiss, the furniture reverts back to normal.  Not a first time for Disney though (and certainly not a last time).  Inanimate objects are personified on a regular basis, but such is magic. \n"}, {"text": "Items picked up in early \"Pokemon\" games were indistinguishable from Pokeballs (used to catch new Pokemon).  But some of those items were actually which of these catchable creatures, similar in appearance to said items?", "correct": "Voltorb", "options": ["Pidgey", "Pikachu", "Chansey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVoltorb.\n\n\tPlayers of \"Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow\" may have visited the Power Plant portion of the map later on in their explorations of Kanto.  This electric-themed location, home to Zapdos, was probably the easiest place to find Voltorbs and Electrodes, Pokemon with self-destructing capabilities and electric charges. These red and white Pokemon, shaped like Pokeballs, were indistinguishable from items found on the ground, so you could find yourself launching into a battle instead of nabbing something extra.  In the early days, Pokemon generally resembled animals, but later games more took on the form of common items (including refrigerators, lightbulbs, and chandeliers). \n"}, {"text": "The Monster Book of Monsters could take a bite out of you if you're not careful.  How do you pacify this magical tome from the \"Harry Potter\" series?", "correct": "By stroking it", "options": ["By casting a spell on it", "By feeding it", "By singing to it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy stroking it.\n\n\tFirst appearing in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" as a bit of required reading, the Monster Book of Monsters was put onto the reading list by Hagrid when he headed the Care of Magical Creatures class.  Harry and company had to obtain copies of the book when they went into their third year (during which they shared the period with Syltherin's third years as well).  The book was ravenous, and also shared the same temperament when appearing in other \"Harry Potter\" media (including the video games).  The only way to be able to read the contents without getting bitten was to stroke its spine, pacifying it.  No comment on whether or not that tip was written inside the book or not. \n"}, {"text": "'The Luggage' is a protective treasure chest found in the writings of what fantasy author?", "correct": "Terry Pratchett", "options": ["Douglas Adams", "Robert Rankin", "J. R. R. Tolkien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerry Pratchett.\n\n\tFirst seen in his debut \"Discworld\" book, \"The Colour of Magic\", The Luggage belongs to the tourist Twoflower and follows him around as he goes off to explore.  Particularly ravenous around other people, the Luggage epitomizes the treasure chest mimic trope of fantasy tales (especially games).  At the end of the first novel, it actually careens off the edge of Discworld following its owner.  It unsurprisingly manages to continue on, appearing just when the story needs to take a turn for the absurd in \"The Light Fantastic\" and \"Interesting Times\" (amongst other stories). \n"}, {"text": "In the 2019 New Zealand film \"Killer Sofa\", an unassuming recliner becomes a hungry beast due to the power of what supernatural creature?", "correct": "Dybbuk", "options": ["Wendigo", "Gremlin", "Banshee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDybbuk.\n\n\tNew Zealand is a nation of cheeky horror movies, and \"Killer Sofa\" takes it to the extreme.  About a Jewish folklore ritual, \"Killer Sofa\" features a recliner with the ability to eat people, empowering itself by taking their souls and possessing them.  The story is based on the myth of the dybbuk, a creature typically found in a box. The movie, of course, treads the line between silly and serious as characters (including detectives) try to get to the bottom of some murders and missing people reports, all the while not knowing that the killer is in their very midst, blending in with the furniture. \n"}, {"text": "In a betrayal of all one comes to know about RPGs, \"Chrono Trigger\" featured a mimic creature in the form of which of these?", "correct": "A save point", "options": ["An inn", "A menu screen", "A pause screen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA save point.\n\n\tCreated by Square, \"Chrono Trigger\" was considered a crown jewel of SNES-era role-playing games, placing the player into a time-traveling fantasy story.  Like most turn-based RPGs of the era, the game relied on saved progress-- the game was simply too long to play in a single sitting for most players-- and these save points were visible on maps as glistening stars. Later in the game, players could find a save point that wasn't really what it seemed to be; it would launch them into a battle.  Other games with fake save points include \"Chrono Cross\" (this game's sequel), \"Final Fantasy V\", and games in the \"Castlevania\" series. Truly a betrayal of all expectation. \n"}, {"text": "In the 2010 film \"Rubber\", which of the following has sentience and the power to kill with its mind?", "correct": "Tire", "options": ["Children's toy", "Mannequin", "Ball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTire.\n\n\tIn a movie that alludes to its own meta capabilities, the 2010 horror-comedy \"Rubber\" leaned into its own absurdity for most of its run-time.  In the film, general people and authorities working out in the desert faced off against a sentient tire, wreaking havoc for undisclosed reasons which, frankly, aren't relevant.  The movie goes to extreme lengths to remind that everything happening for no particular point-- it just *is*.  Debuting at Cannes, \"Rubber\" had short-lived popularity in cult horror spheres. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars\", Super Mario has to face off against a foe by the name of Bundt, which is actually which of these?", "correct": "A cake", "options": ["An egg", "A treasure chest", "A statue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cake.\n\n\tMade by Square (much like \"Chrono Trigger\"), the SNES title \"Super Mario RPG\" playes with expectations a little bit, and besides facing off against new and old \"Mario\" series enemies, Mario comes across several should-be-inanimate enemies just in the course of the story.  Visiting a wedding-themed town named Marrymore, Mario will stop Bowser and Princess Toadstool's wedding and be forced into battle against the wedding caterers and, to everyone's shock, their sentient cake. The game also features a small handful of literal mimic chests, and they're harder than usual enemies, just to keep you on your toes. \n"}, {"text": "It may seem essential for some, but a parasitic hearing aid results in an explosive death for a character in what spooky movie franchise?", "correct": "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "options": ["Friday the 13th", "The Grudge", "Halloween"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\n\tShowing up in \"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\" (1991), the hearing aid situation wasn't out of line for the fantastical horror hi-jinx of Freddy Kreuger in one of his campiest outings.  In this sequence, Carlos Rodriguez, a hearing-impaired character, ends up in a nightmare in a boiler room.  He puts the hearing aid into his ear and, sure enough, the nightmare intensifies.  The normally-sentient hearing aid latches in and Freddy cranks the volume.  KABLAMMO.  Seriously-- what can be trusted? \n"}]}
