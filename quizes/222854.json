{"id": "222854", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Major Ego' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 7 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 7"], "questions": [{"text": "Charles has saved a patient's life by administering direct heart massage.  Rather than letting this wonderful moment speak for itself, Charles has notified the press, and a certain Captain Tom Greenleigh has been summoned.  From which press outlet has Captain Greenleigh been sent?", "correct": "Stars and Stripes", "options": ["AP", "Boston Globe", "UPI"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStars and Stripes.\n\n\tCaptain Greenleigh has been sent specifically by General Imbrie at I-Corps to cover this exciting accomplishment by Charles.  Less exciting is the fact that it was Charles himself who notified I-Corps of his fortunate feat.  Charles, naturally, has ulterior motives, namely to have some of the higher brass notice his skills and possibly get a ticket to Tokyo...or home! \n"}, {"text": "While Charles is floating in the clouds, Margaret is still mired in her divorce settlement with her ex-husband Donald.  What has Donald done this time to upset Margaret?", "correct": "Tied up their joint savings account in legal knots", "options": ["Announced his engagement to be married to another woman", "Charged several large purchases under Margaret's name", "Refused Margaret's request to have her personal effects sent to Korea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTied up their joint savings account in legal knots.\n\n\t'I'm just so sick and tired of this whole divorce', says Margaret, and with good cause.  Donald is fighting to the bitter end to tie up Margaret's money in the hopes that she will give up and make some settlement favorable to him.  Luckily, Margaret is very resilient, she will not let 'Donald Duckface' take advantage of her! \n"}, {"text": "Charles gets busy telling his entire life story to the rather reluctant Greenleigh, who seems more interested in Margaret.  When Charles gives a rundown of some of the schools he has attended, what name does Hawkeye add to the list?", "correct": "The Massachusetts Institute of Snobbery", "options": ["Braggadocio College", "Boston Academy for Pomposity", "University of Arrogance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Snobbery.\n\n\tCharles claims to have been born in 'Upper Boston', and his family has lived there for five generations.  He attended Choate (a prep school in Connecticut) and Harvard University.  \r No doubt, if 'The Massachusetts Institute of Snobbery' existed, Charles would meet all requirements for admission. \n"}, {"text": "Klinger is attracted to Captain Greenleigh, but not because he is handsome.  The hirsute Corporal believes that Greenleigh may have his ticket out of Korea, especially if the Major writes a story about his cross-dressing.  Klinger has a movie-star theme going in this episode to impress Greenleigh.  The first dress in which he appears in this episode is from which popular film?", "correct": "Gone with the Wind", "options": ["Grand Hotel", "His Girl Friday", "Casablanca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGone with the Wind.\n\n\tKlinger appears in three dresses in this episode, one a Scarlett O'Hara get-up from 'Gone with the Wind' and the second a rendition of Dorothy's clothing from 'The Wizard of Oz' (more about the third later).  When Winchester sees Klinger in his Scarlett O'Hara dress he is incensed.  'Get out of here you antebellum buffoon!', shouts Charles. \n"}, {"text": "When casualties arrive at the 4077th, Captain Greenleigh gets to see Charles in action.  Colonel Potter specifically requests that Charles work on a patient with which specific problem at the outset of this operating session?", "correct": "Aortic aneurysm", "options": ["Punctured spleen", "Damaged kidney", "Skull fracture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAortic aneurysm.\n\n\tDuring triage, Charles locates a patient with a sucking chest wound so that  Greenleigh can get a good photograph.  Later, he works on a patient with an aneurysm, his surgical specialty.  Unfortunately, the young man will have complications related to the surgery, some of Charles's suture lines leak in the patient's aorta. \n"}, {"text": "Sutton is the name of the original patient Charles saved with his heart massage.  The young man claims to have already received a purple heart while fighting at which location?", "correct": "Pork Chop Hill", "options": ["Hill 403", "Inchon", "Pusan Perimeter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPork Chop Hill.\n\n\tThe Battle of Pork Chop Hill actually took place towards the very end of the Korean War (1953).  A movie was made about the battle in 1959, starring Gregory Peck, and it was called, oddly enough, 'Pork Chop Hill'. \n"}, {"text": "Meanwhile, Colonel Potter decides he will help Margaret.  He puts in a call to Donald and helps talk some sense into the man.  Donald decides that he will help clear things up with his soon ex-wife.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, Colonel Potter fails to have any effect at all on Donald, not that Margaret was expecting otherwise.  Margaret is frustrated beyond reason, and drinks quite a bit that evening.  She declares to BJ that it has been four months since she made 'close order drill' with Donald, and she later decides to accept the advances of Captain Greenleigh. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret and Greenleigh become an item during the time that the latter spends at the 4077th.  They become so close that Margaret demands that Tom commit to a regular relationship.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, it's quite the opposite.  Tom Greenleigh seems smitten with Margaret, and she is also fond of him, but she dismisses any suggestions that they should maintain close relations.  She believes that it would be better if they could just remember their time together, brief as it may have been, and move on. \n"}, {"text": "After one of his patients develops post-surgical complications, Charles decides that he is no longer interested in having Major Greenleigh write his article.  Charles takes the finished piece from Greenleigh and tears it up.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn the end, Charles does the honorable thing and disallows Greenleigh's article.  Charles even labels himself the 'Boston Bungler' (though he merely does so in an attempt to anticipate Hawkeye's mockery).  Greenleigh is quite upset, complaining about having to listen to Charles's boring stories about the 'lace curtain circus' that Charles calls a family. \n"}, {"text": "Klinger appears again to Greenleigh at the end of the episode in a final attempt to catch the Major's attention.  This time, he is dressed as which Hollywood icon?", "correct": "Bette Davis", "options": ["Jean Harlow", "Joan Crawford", "Mary Pickford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBette Davis.\n\n\tThis is Klinger's third 'movie star' dress of the episode.  Third time's a charm, as far as Greenleigh is concerned, and he pursues Klinger for a possible article in 'Stars and Stripes'.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
