{"id": "165228", "name": "An Italian Vacation Trivia Game | Europe | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Europe", "Italy"], "questions": [{"text": "After a rather long flight from Atlanta, we gently descend through some scattered clouds over the Ligurian Sea towards the west coast of the Italian peninsula.  Approaching Rome, we arrive at Fiumicino Airport just a few minutes early.  We discover that Fiumicino also goes by another name, that of a famous historic Italian...but which?", "correct": "Leonardo da Vinci", "options": ["Petrarch", "Galileo Galileo", "Julius Caesar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonardo da Vinci.\n\n\tFiumicino (which means 'little river' in Italian) is the old name for what is now generally called Leonardo da Vinci Airport.  The airport is located sixteen miles (twenty-six kilometres) from Rome's city center, so it's just a 45 minute cab ride from the city (or 30 minutes, if your cab driver is particularly insane.)  I surely hope you know who Leonardo is! \n"}, {"text": "We decide to immediately make our way by train to the beautiful Tuscan town of Florence, just a two and a half hour train ride from Rome.  Walking towards the town center, we behold the beautiful Duomo that caps off the city's largest cathedral.  What is that cathedral called?", "correct": "Santa Maria del Fiore", "options": ["Santa Maria Novella", "Santa Croce", "San Lorenzo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSanta Maria del Fiore.\n\n\tThe awesome red-tiled brick dome (Duomo) was built by Filippo Brunelleschi in the 15th century.  It served as the model for future domes in Rome (Michelangelo's dome at St. Peters) and Washington, D.C. (the U.S. Capitol building).  Sitting aside the Santa Maria del Fiore is the Florentine Baptistry, with brass doors designed by Ghiberti that Michelangelo deemed 'The Gates of Paradise'.  Also attached to the cathedral is a campanile, designed by Giotto. \n"}, {"text": "Following several wonderful days of touring, we decide to set out for Siena, a nearby town that served as long-time rival to Florence.  After spending some time in the Pinacoteca Nazionale we decide that we must have lunch in this beautiful town with a Renaissance feel.  With our meal we share a bottle of Tuscany's most famous wine.  Which of the following wines fits this description?", "correct": "Chianti", "options": ["Lambrusco", "Bardolino", "Frascati"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChianti.\n\n\tAlthough all of these wines originate in Italy, Chianti is the specialty of the Tuscan region.  Siena and Florence were great rivals in the 14th and 15th centuries within this region, having fought several times on the battlefield.  The rivalry extended to the canvas, where the Sienese greats Duccio, the Lorenzetti Brothers and Simone Martini rivaled Giotto, Cimabue and Donatello in their aesthetic abilities. \n"}, {"text": "Next on our agenda is Bologna, just a short ride north of Florence.  The city is modern but still retains its old charm, particularly within the city center where we behold Giambologna's Neptune fountain and not one, but two leaning towers!  We also enjoy some Bolognese cuisine, which includes which of these meats that originated in Bologna?", "correct": "Mortadella", "options": ["Chorizo", "Parma ham", "Andouille"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMortadella.\n\n\tMortadella is a thick sausage with fatty parts, sometimes containing pistachio nuts and peppercorns.  It, along with Bolognese sauce, is perhaps Bologna's most famous culinary product.  The city of Bologna strikes the perfect balance between Renaissance and modern, and is certainly worth a visit.  You can see Europe's oldest university there. \n"}, {"text": "A side-trip from Bologna takes us to the ancient town of Ravenna, located along the east coast of Italy.  Ravenna is famed for its ancient mosaics, which can be found in the very well-preserved basilicas, baptisteries and other religious buildings.  It also happens to contain the tomb of what ancient monarch?", "correct": "Theodoric", "options": ["Diocletian", "Constantine", "Justinian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheodoric.\n\n\tFittingly, Theodoric, who reigned in Ravenna for over 30 years, had his tomb located within the city confines.  Incredibly elaborate mosaics, many of which were commissioned by the that good emperor, may be found in a number of locations throughout the town.  If you go, which I recommend you do, be sure to visit the Basilica di S. Vitale, the Basilica di S. Apollinare Nuovo, Galla Placidia's Mausoleum and the Neonian Baptistery. \n"}, {"text": "Our happy tour of Bologna and Ravenna has come to an end, as we make our way north yet again, to Milan.  Which artistic masterpiece awaits our visit to that cosmopolitan town of northern Italy?", "correct": "Leonardo's 'The Last Supper'", "options": ["Michelangelo's 'David'", "Donatello's 'St. George'", "Raphael's 'The School of Athens'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonardo's 'The Last Supper'.\n\n\tLeonardo's 'The Last Supper' can be found in the refectory connected to the Cathedral of S. Maria della Grazie.  Be sure to make your reservations early during tourist season!  Milan also features the opera house La Scala, its own Duomo (the third largest cathedral in Christendom) and the Pinacoteca di Brera, which contains Andrea Mantegna's 'The Dead Christ'. \n"}, {"text": "Milan was lovely, but we now wish to head east to the lovely city by the sea, Venice.  Venice is a city of islands and canals, with the only means of transport being by boat.  We take a vaporetto to our hotel room, which sits right along the Grand Canal.  Which of these bridges could we not travel under on our way along the Grand Canal?", "correct": "The Bridge of Sighs", "options": ["The Scalzi Bridge", "The Accademia Bridge", "The Rialto Bridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bridge of Sighs.\n\n\tSome of the bridges that cross the Grand Canal are the marble Ponte Rialto,\rthe Ponte Accademia, made entirely of wood, and the stone Ponte degli Scalzi, near the train station.  The Bridge of Sighs connects the New Prisons to the Palazzo Ducale, and is not for public use (nor does it cross the Grand Canal.)  Venice is lovely to behold by boat, but even better by foot...but watch your step, the city contains few public parks for dogs, if you understand my meaning. \n"}, {"text": "While in Venice, we decide to make the short trip to Padua to see some of its artistic wonders.  The greatest of these wonders is a series of frescos to be found in the Scrovegni Chapel, near the ancient ruins of a Roman arena.  Who was commissioned to paint these frescoes in the early 14th century?", "correct": "Giotto", "options": ["Cimabue", "Duccio", "Simone Martini"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGiotto.\n\n\tEnrico Scrovegni, the scion of a powerful banking family in Padua, commissioned Giotto, the best-known and most well-beloved painter of the time, to paint a series of frescos on the walls of the Scrovegni family's chapel.  Giotto's series of frescos in the Arena Chapel (so-called because of the ancient Roman arena attached to the church) are often marked as the beginning of the modern age of art.  You must see these frescos some time in your life! \n"}, {"text": "Several marvelous days in beautiful Venice leave us breathless but still hungering for more of Italy.  A return to Rome will mark the final leg of our tour.  In Rome, we stay at a hotel not far from the Pantheon, the only fully intact building of ancient Rome.  Which of these is not true of the Pantheon?", "correct": "It houses Michelangelo's 'Pieta'", "options": ["The 30-foot diameter oculus is its only source of natural light (providing the doors are closed!)", "It is the burial place of Raphael", "It was converted from a Roman temple to a Christian church"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt houses Michelangelo's 'Pieta'.\n\n\tMichelangelo's 'Pieta' (he actually did more than one 'Pieta', but I'm referring to his most famous piece by that name) is kept a short distance away in St. Peters in the Vatican.  The Pantheon, built originally by Augustus' general Agrippa, and then rebuilt by Emperor Hadrian in the year 126 A.D., served originally as a temple for all the Roman gods (thus its name, which means 'all gods').  Later, it was converted to a Christian church, and hence preserved throughout the long ages by Christians as a holy site. \n"}, {"text": "Sadly, our trip has ended and we find ourselves returning to the airport via a train running from Termini Station.  Along the way to the station, a gentleman drops his coat.  Having his arms full, you lean over and pick it up for him, for which he returns a grateful 'grazie!'  How should you respond?", "correct": "Prego", "options": ["Pronto", "Ciao", "Ragu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrego.\n\n\t'Grazie' means 'thank you', while 'prego' is the word for 'you're welcome' (not just a canned spaghetti sauce!)  In general, Italians are very polite...you may hear 100 grazies and pregos for each day you stay in Italy.  Let's hope we can return there soon enough. \n"}]}
