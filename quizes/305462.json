{"id": "305462", "name": "\"Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4\" - Characters Quiz / Test  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games Q-S", "Shin Megami Tensei Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Before the game begins, the protagonist is found in the Velvet Room.  Here, \"Persona\" players will find a familiar face- Igor.  What is the name of Igor's assistant in \"Persona 4\"?", "correct": "Margaret", "options": ["Belladonna", "Elizabeth", "Nanashi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret.\n\n\tAlthough the Velvet Room appears in many of the \"Persona\" games, this is the first time that it appears inside what seems to be a moving limousine.  The room (for the most part) will contain Igor, a mysterious man who speaks in occasionally-cryptic sentences.  He alludes to the protagonist that this year will change his life, and he's definitely not wrong about it.  The protagonist visits the Velvet Room in both dreams and the real world depending on where it can be accessed.\rAt one point in the game, Margaret will see you in the Velvet Room alone, explaining that she is the reason he is able to access this mysterious area.  Because of this obscure bond, the protagonist is able to create a link to the Empress Arcana.  If the protagonist strengthens and fuses Empress Arcana-based Personas, then Margaret's relationship will grow.  Gathering social links and additional Personas of all types will also fill Margaret's compendium, in turn convincing her to give you stronger items.\rIf the True Ending of the game is achieved a second time, Margaret will reveal that she is the sister of a previous Velvet Room attendant, Elizabeth (who appeared in \"Persona 3\").  She will then battle you. \n"}, {"text": "The first major party member to join the protagonist's cause is Yosuke.  What is the name of the department store he is associated with?", "correct": "Junes", "options": ["Mays", "Aprils", "Julys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJunes.\n\n\tYosuke was 'the new kid' before the protagonist arrived in Inaba, and because of his father's affiliation with the new department store, June's, he has been somewhat ostracized by the owners and workers from small businesses around town.  Yosuke first enters the Midnight Channel not as a victim, but to investigate the disappearance of Saki Konishi, a girl who worked a June's.  In order to finish the mission, Yosuke needs to oppose the shadow of himself.  When this is done, he will join the protagonist's party and fight with his Persona (of the Magician arcana), Jiraiya.\rYosuke tends to provide slapstick comic relief during the storyline and acts as one of the protagonist's best friends.  Powering up his social link to the maximum level will result in Jiraiya evolving into Susano-O. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these facts is not true about Chie?", "correct": "She is an excellent chef", "options": ["She informed the protagonist and Yosuke about the Midnight Channel", "Her initial Persona is Tomoe", "She levels up in the Chariot arcana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe is an excellent chef.\n\n\tChie is a tomboyish girl in the protagonist's class.  She, Yosuke, and the protagonist fall into the TV for the first time together though she's the second person to join the protagonist's party.  It isn't until after Yosuke battles his inner shadow that Chie needs to battle her own.\rChie originally tells Yosuke and the protagonist about the Midnight Channel at the June's food court when the trio are just becoming friends.  After realizing that he can place his hand in the TV during a Midnight Channel airing, he tells the two and they end up falling into one of the TVs in June's electronics department.\rChie's Persona is in the Chariot arcana and it is leveled up through interactions with her in various locations.  Her main Persona, Tomoe, becomes Suzaka Gongen when the arcana is maxed out. \n"}, {"text": "Yukiko, prior to the events of \"Persona 4\", was slated to take over the family business.  What business does Yukiko's family own?", "correct": "Amagi Inn", "options": ["The restaurant in the North Shopping Area", "The liquor store in the South Shopping Area", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmagi Inn.\n\n\tYukiko is a shy, reserved character who was to be the future boss of the Amagi Inn.  During the initial controversy in town, this inn held many reporters and police investigators.  When Yukiko appeared on the Midnight Channel in the form of a promiscuous, flaunting beauty, everyone was shocked.  The protagonist, Yosuke, and Chie traveled to her location within the Midnight Channel to help her and discovered a lavish castle.  At the end, they protected her by fighting her shadow, and after the battle it was discovered that she possessed the power of Konohana Sakuya in the Priestess arcana.  After consideration, it is revealed that she does not want to take over the Amagi Inn and she branches into newer ventures.  She also joins the group to solve the mysteries of the Mystery Channel ad the recent murders.\rOnce maxed out, her social link will result in Konohana Sakuya evolving into Amaterasu. \n"}, {"text": "Kanji's social link can be maxed in which arcana?", "correct": "The Emperor arcana", "options": ["The Fool arcana", "The Judgment arcana", "The Hierophant arcana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Emperor arcana.\n\n\tUsing the Persona of Take-Mikazuchi, Kanji is a formidable friend in the Midnight Channel and in real-life Inaba.  His stern appearance and unorthodox appearance make Kanji seem like a bully, but as it is discovered, he is a much more sensitive person than he lets on.  In addition, the game leaves it open to interpretation as to whether Kanji is straight or gay, leading to a much more enigmatic personality.\rThis idea is further supported by the fact that his Midnight Channel stages are held in a mysterious bathhouse.  Upon fighting his sexually-confused shadow self, Kanji will decide to join the group and he will become a very important friend to keep.\rOnce the Emperor arcana is maxed out, Take-Mikazuchi will evolve itself into Rokuten-Ma\u014d. \n"}, {"text": "When Teddie transitions into the real world and Inaba, he transforms into a human.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tTeddie first appeared during the protagonist's, Yosuke's, and Chie's first adventure into the Midnight Channel.  This cute creature is essentially a friendly bear, though it's clear that in both the real world and the Midnight Channel, it's nothing more than a costume.  When Teddie's head comes off in the Midnight Channel, it's shown that nothing is inside, but when Teddie visits Inaba to find his new friends, he becomes a human.\rUp until just after Kanji's dungeon, Teddie does nothing more than help his friends inside the Midnight channel, allowing them to come and go and commentate on battles (including search for escape routes and dictate weaknesses).  Eventually, Teddie becomes a party member, fighting with the Star arcana.  His original Persona is Kintoki Douji, but it evolves into Kamui with a maxed social link.  Unlike other characters, Teddie will not level up in the Star Arcanum through forced interaction, but through the regular storyline.  You can not max out Teddie's social link unless you achieve the Good or True Ending. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Rise's Persona before her social link is maxed out?", "correct": "Himiko", "options": ["Loki", "Kanzeon", "Jack Frost"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHimiko.\n\n\tRise, before moving back to Inaba and becoming the 'new kid' in the protagonist's class, was known as Risette from her previous work in the TV industry.  Although many people look up to her advertising career, her previous group of friends were only with her because of the fame behind her name.  When she arrives in Inaba to settle down and go back to school, the group finds that she is the next victim.  They head to her Midnight Channel incarnation, a strip club, to save her.\rAlthough one would assume that Rise joins the party, she does not become a fighter for the group.  Upon joining, she takes Teddie's role as the commentator for the group and Teddie joins as a fighter.\rRise's Persona, Himiko, evolves into Kanzeon at max social level.  Both of these Personas are in the Lovers acrana. \n"}, {"text": "What item will Naoto use in place of melee attacks in battle?", "correct": "Gun", "options": ["Knife", "Sword", "Chakram"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGun.\n\n\tNaoto Shirogane is similar to both Kanji and Rise.  Like Rise, Naoto is 'new' in Inaba.  A member of the Shirogane family, known for intense detective work over the years, Naoto travels to Inaba in order to infiltrate certain aspects of the community and gain knowledge about the Midnight Channel killings.  Like Kanji though, Naoto's gender is placed into question until it is ultimately revealed in her dungeon (a mysterious, secret laboratory) that she is actually female.  Despite the fact that her outward appearance doesn't really demonstrate this, Naoto does have her sensitive moments throughout the game.  In addition, her intelligence may be unequaled by all of the other members of the team.\rThough Naoto appears much later in the game than the other characters, and though she is the final member to be added to the party, you can max out her levels in the Fortune arcana and evolve her Persona, Sukuna Hikona, into Yamato Takeru.  In addition, the more interaction held between the protagonist and Naoto, the more comfortable she is expressing herself in more feminine ways. \n"}, {"text": "What relation is Dojima to Nanako?", "correct": "He is her father", "options": ["They are not related", "He is her uncle", "He is her brother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is her father.\n\n\tThe protagonist moves in with Dojima and Nanako at the start of the game in April 2011.  While Nanako is a stern figure in the household, always having to work as a detective on the murder cases and leaving Nanako behind to take care of the house, Nanako is a friendly child who quickly befriends nearly everyone in the game.\rOver the course of the game, the protagonist can speak with Dojima one-on-one to establish the Hierophant arcana links.  Despite the fact that Dojima will often be quite short with the protagonist, it is evident that he's just trying to protect the boy.\rNanako, while spending time with all of the other party members, can speak with the protagonist on many occasions to strengthen the Justice arcana social link.  Towards the end of the game, Nanako is placed into the Midnight Channel and the group has to travel to her incarnation of the dungeon (known as 'Heaven' because of her pure heart and longing for her mother, who passed away when she was much younger).  Depending on whether or not the player gets the Bad, Good, or True Ending, Nanako's fate will be decided. \n"}, {"text": "If you play through to the Good or True Ending, the Inaba killer will end up being which character?", "correct": "Adachi & Tohru & Tohru Adachi & Detective Adachi", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdachi & Tohru & Tohru Adachi & Detective Adachi.\n\n\tDetective Adachi, throughout the game, worked with Dojima on the case of the Inaba murders, and it is discovered that he was actually the mastermind behind most of the events that occurred over the past year.  When the Investigation Team realizes that Adachi did it, they chase him into the Midnight Channel and fight their way to him in a dark version of Inaba.\rIf the Investigation Team points all of the blame on Taro Namatame as the sole killer, they will receive the Bad Ending of the game, but if they realize that there was a second person (being Adachi), the game will continue for another dungeon (or two for the True Ending).  While Namatame initially believes that the Midnight Channel is saving people from the murders (because the first two were killed by Adachi and the rest were saved by the Investigation Team), he realizes when Nanako is thrown in that it may not be true.\rAfter fighting Adachi's shadow and self in the Midnight Channel, it is revealed that his Persona was actually Izanami.  Finishing the True Ending will reveal that Izanami was actually disguised as the gas station attendant at the entrance to Inaba.  Shaking hands with many of the characters as they entered town granted them access to the Midnight Channel and influenced their doings in the game.  Once this evil being is defeated, the True Ending is completed. \n"}]}
