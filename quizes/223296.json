Naturally, Hawkeye is referring to Charles's unfortunate bald spot. \n"}, {"text": "Upon their return to the Swamp, Hawkeye and BJ notice a radical change.  Things are clean!  Hawkeye complains that which of his 'pets' are dead?", "correct": "Fleas", "options": ["Lice", "Rats", "Spiders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFleas.\n\n\tCharles has had things tidied up a bit while his bunkmates have been gallivanting about in Tokyo.
