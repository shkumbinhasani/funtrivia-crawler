{"id": "173826", "name": "Movies - One Through Ten Online Trivia | Something in Common | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Common Titles"], "questions": [{"text": "Three Dog Night said that 'One is the loneliest number'.  Is it true that 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is the only film to win best picture with the word 'One' in its title?  ", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tLet's not forget about Frank Capra's 1934 film 'It Happened One Night'!  By the way, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' won the Best Picture Oscar in 1975.  Can you think of any other Oscar winning pictures that have a number in their title? \n"}, {"text": "What is the number 'two' title of the sequel to the 1974 thriller 'Chinatown'?  ", "correct": "The Two Jakes & Two Jakes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Two Jakes & Two Jakes.\n\n\t'Chinatown' was directed by Roman Polanski and starred Jack Nicholson.  It was a classic detective film.  The 1990 sequel called 'The Two Jakes' was directed by Jack Nicholson.  I wouldn't call it a classic. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite comedies of the 1980s was the film 'Three Amigos'.  Which of these actors was not among the title three?  ", "correct": "Dana Carvey", "options": ["Steve Martin", "Martin Short", "Chevy Chase"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDana Carvey.\n\n\t'Three Amigos' was unleashed upon the public in 1986, and provided mild amusement, particularly for those of us with juvenile senses of humor.  The amigos, played absurdly by Chase, Short and Martin, are silent western stars who are in their career decline.  Through a misunderstanding they find themselves in lawless Mexico, and wacky antics ensue.  My favorite lines comes from Dusty (Chase), who, when having difficulty with a tortilla asks, 'Do you have anything besides Mexican food?' \n"}, {"text": "Who directed and starred in the 1981 adult drama/romance called 'The Four Seasons'?  ", "correct": "Alan Alda", "options": ["Woody Allen", "Peter Sellers", "Blake Edwards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlan Alda.\n\n\t'The Four Seasons' featured the acting talents of Alda and Carol Burnett, one of three couples who share vacations together each year.  It explores the ups and downs of marriage relations amongst people of middling age.  Burnett and Alda provide some light-hearted moments, as would be expected. \n"}, {"text": "From 1970 comes our number five film, oddly enough entitled 'Five Easy Pieces'.  Which actor plays the lead role in this film about drifters?  ", "correct": "Jack Nicholson", "options": ["Steve McQueen", "Paul Newman", "Robert Redford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Nicholson.\n\n\tNicholson plays the lead role of a classical pianist cum oil rig worker brilliantly (as always!).  Interesting co-stars such as Karen Black and Susan Anspach put on performances worth watching as well.  Even Sally Struthers gets into the act in a rather stunning manner.  It's certainly worth a watch! \n"}, {"text": "The movie 'Six Degrees of Separation' features the acting of Kevin Bacon, among others.  ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOddly, a film with a title ('Six Degrees of Separation')  that has practically defined Kevin Bacon's life and career does not include him (the casting manager dropped the ball here!)  The film does include the acting of Will Smith, Stockard Channing, Donald Sutherland and a rotating Kandinsky painting.  Rumor has it that you can trace the actors in this film to any other actor in Hollywood in six easy steps. \n"}, {"text": "The Japanese film 'The Seven Samurai', directed by Akira Kurosawa, was based on 'The Magnificent Seven', an American western directed by John Sturges.  ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually it's quite the opposite.  The Kurosawa-directed 'The Seven Samurai' was released in 1954 and starred Kurosawa's favorite actor Toshiro Mifune.  'The Magnificent Seven' came along six years later (couldn't Sturges have just waited seven for trivia purposes?) in 1960 and starred Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen and Eli Wallach.  Both are excellent films, but I'll take the original over the imitation any day. \n"}, {"text": "I'm going to cheat a little for the eighth question and add a fraction.  Which Italian director created the masterpiece '8 1/2'?  ", "correct": "Federico Fellini", "options": ["Bernardo Bertolucci", "Michelangelo Antonioni", "Pier Paolo Pasolini"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFederico Fellini.\n\n\tAlong with 'La Dolce Vita', '8 1/2' is considered to be the classic work of Fellini's career.  The film features the acting of Marcello Mastroianni and Anouk Aimee.  I will say no more other than, you must take a look at the film. \n"}, {"text": "This film features not one but two numbers in its title, and also the acting of Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton.  What is the name of this 1980 paean to women's lib?  ", "correct": "Nine to Five & 9 to 5", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine to Five & 9 to 5.\n\n\tIronically, the most entertaining performance among the mostly female cast probably comes from the snivelling Dabney Coleman, who plays the egocentric and chauvinistic boss of the Fonda, Tomlin and Parton characters.  If you haven't seen the movie, it's really worth watching, though the material is somewhat dated. \n"}, {"text": "Cecil B. DeMille directed not one, but two different versions of 'The Ten Commandments'.  ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDeMille's first version of 'The Ten Commandments' was released in 1923 and starred Theodore Roberts as Moses.  It was created during the era of silent films.  His second go at the story took place 33 years later in 1956, when he re-created the epic using the ham-fisted acting of Charlton Heston and the incredibly advanced special effects of the day (yes, I'm being facetious!).  Both versions are worth a watch.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other quizzes. \n"}]}
