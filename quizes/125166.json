{"id": "125166", "name": "\"Top Secret!\", the Movie Online Trivia | T | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "T", "Tn - Tq Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Most of the film takes place in East Germany, during the Nazi regime.  According to the letterhead on an official communique that we see early in the film, what is the motto of East Germany?", "correct": "\"Better Government Through Intimidation\"", "options": ["\"The Guards Will Kill You, If the Electrified Fence Doesn't Get You First\"", "\"Don't Bother Trying To Escape\"", "\"Land of Vine and Grape\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Better Government Through Intimidation\".\n\n\tAll of the wrong answers here are actually lines of the translation we're given of East Germany's national anthem later in the film.  I'm guessing those aren't the real lyrics.  =) \n"}, {"text": "General Streck's (Jeremy Kemp) only response to this communique takes the form of a rather unusual stamped message.  What does this stamp say?", "correct": "\"Find Him and Kill Him\"", "options": ["\"This Space For Rent\"", "\"Heil Hitler, and All That\"", "\"I Like Ike\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Find Him and Kill Him\".\n\n\tI'd love to have that stamp!  The communique stated that Agent Cedric (Omar Sharif) had escaped an attempt on his life. \n"}, {"text": "Interestingly enough, our hero Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) only winds up being invited to East Germany because another performer has had to cancel at the last minute.  Who was the Nazis' original choice to represent the United States at their upcoming cultural festival?", "correct": "Leonard Bernstein", "options": ["Lawrence Welk", "Sammy Davis, Jr.", "Liberace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonard Bernstein.\n\n\tI think the joke here is that it would be somewhat unusual for Nazis to invite a Jewish composer to their festival.  =) \n"}, {"text": "The first image of Nick that we see in the film is featured on the cover of his \"greatest hits\" album.  What is Nick dressed as on the cover?", "correct": "a baseball player", "options": ["a court jester", "Superman", "a sailor"], "explanation": "\n\n\na baseball player.\n\n\tNick, in full baseball regalia, is swinging a bat.  At the point of would-be impact, we see the words \"greatest hits.\"  Get it? \n"}, {"text": "We hear a number of Nick Rivers songs throughout the film.  Which one do we hear *first*?", "correct": "\"Skeet Surfin'\"", "options": ["\"Straighten the Rug\"", "\"I Just Met a Girl Like You\"", "\"How Silly Can You Get?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Skeet Surfin'\".\n\n\tAs the opening credits of the film play out, scores of young adults are seen engaging in the activity being sung about -- skeet shooting while surfing.  (Don't try this at home, kids.)  The other three songs are heard much later in the film. \n"}, {"text": "We're shown a quick shot of a \"Billboard\" chart, and Nick Rivers holds the top three spots.  Which of the following is NOT one of the songs featured in those spots?", "correct": "\"Skeet Surfin'\"", "options": ["\"Skeetin' USA\"", "\"Skeet City\"", "\"Your Skeetin' Heart\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Skeet Surfin'\".\n\n\tObviously a goof on the somewhat repetitive nature of the Beach Boys' early hits.  It's odd, though, that the only skeet-related song that we actually HEAR isn't a chart-topper... \n"}, {"text": "True or False: Val Kilmer actually provides Nick Rivers' singing voice in this film.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tYup -- whenever Nick is singing, that's really Kilmer's (pre-recorded) voice.  Kilmer also reportedly learned to play the guitar for the role, but the directors decided that it would be much funnier if Nick's hand movements did not match the actual guitar music on the soundtrack (a la Elvis movies), so Kilmer never got a chance to show off his new talent! \n"}, {"text": "To cement the idea that Nick Rivers is an enormous star, we're shown a marquee outside of Madison Square Garden featuring Nick's name above -- and in larger letters than -- the names of a number of other musicians.  Who is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Liza Minelli", "options": ["Stevie Wonder", "Frank Sinatra", "Linda Ronstadt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiza Minelli.\n\n\tThe marquee reads:  \"Tonight -- NICK RIVERS...also, Stevie Wonder, Linda Ronstadt, and, time permitting, Frank Sinatra.\"  Heh. \n"}, {"text": "When we finally lay eyes on Nick Rivers in the flesh (as oppposed to the photos we see of him early of the film), he is on a train bound for East Germany.  What is Nick doing when we first see him?", "correct": "painting", "options": ["singing", "sleeping", "eating"], "explanation": "\n\n\npainting.\n\n\tNick is painting a landscape...but, since he's on a moving train, the image on his canvas is blurred.  Good sight gag, there. \n"}, {"text": "Nick's manager, Martin (Billy J. Mitchell), is reading what seems to be a local newspaper on the train.  What is it called?", "correct": "\"The Daily Opressor\"", "options": ["\"The Daily Dictator\"", "\"The Daily Despot\"", "\"The Daily Propaganda\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Daily Opressor\".\n\n\tThere's a story about Nick's imminent arrival on the front page. \n"}, {"text": "On the train, we overhear the instructional cassette tape that Nick has been using to learn German.  Which sentence do we NOT hear the instructor use as part of the lesson?", "correct": "\"I am sitting on my favorite lemur.\"", "options": ["\"I want a schnauzer with my wienerschnitzel.\"", "\"There is sauerkraut in my lederhosen.\"", "\"The pen is on the table.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"I am sitting on my favorite lemur.\"\n\n\tApparently, almost all of the German spoken in this movie is either complete gibberish, or words entirely unrelated to the English subtitles we're given! \n"}, {"text": "Nick shows off his newly-acquired lingustic ability by asking Martin a question in German.  What is it?", "correct": "\"Is your daughter eighteen?\"", "options": ["\"Is your father rich?\"", "\"Would you like fries with that?\"", "\"How do you spell 'relief'?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Is your daughter eighteen?\".\n\n\tMartin isn't entirely pleased with Nick's obvious levity. \n"}, {"text": "Nick offends the first official from the German High Command he meets, Colonel van Horst (Warren Clarke), by speaking a sentence to him in German with a nasty tone.  When Martin asks what was said that had made the colonel so angry, Nick replies: \"Nothing -- I just told him that I put his name on the _______________________ mailing list.\"  What belongs in the blank?", "correct": "Montgomery Ward", "options": ["Victoria's Secret", "Frederick's of Hollywood", "Goosesteppers 'R' Us"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMontgomery Ward.\n\n\tRemember them?  A prominent American department store for decades that went belly up in the 1990's. \n"}, {"text": "When Nick and Martin arrive in East Germany, we're shown one of those overhead \"graphic depiction\" animation sequences that get used quite a bit in spy films (and the Indiana Jones films, come to think of it).  In this case, however, the animation quickly stops \"tracking\" Nick and Martin's movements and turns into a video game.  Which one?", "correct": "Pac-Man", "options": ["Q*Bert", "Asteroids", "Space Invaders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPac-Man.\n\n\tThe \"dots\" used to show Nick and Martin's path become the dots \"eaten\" by Pac-Man...and the ghosts, sound effects, and music kick in right on schedule, creating a pretty decent impression of the classic arcade game. \n"}, {"text": "Underground resistance members Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) and Agent Cedric (Omar Sharif) are both shown approaching an ostensibly blind informant (Ian McNeice) and using pre-arranged code phrases to initiate their conversations with him.  Interestingly enough, these code phrases always refer to sports.  Which sport is NOT used as part of the secret \"passwords\" used to communicate with the informant?", "correct": "golf", "options": ["tennis", "basketball", "They are all used"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngolf.\n\n\tCedric asks the informant, \"Do you know any good white basketball players?\"  The response is, \"There are no good white basketball players, my friend.\"  Hillary asks, \"Who [sic] do you favor in the Virginia Slims tournament?\"  The response is, \"In women's tennis, I always bet against the heterosexual.\"  There's never a reference to golf in these exchanges. \n"}, {"text": "At the upscale cafe where Nick and Martin are supposed to have dinner, Martin orders something rather unusual for Nick to drink.  What is it?", "correct": "Ripple", "options": ["Night Train", "Mad Dog 2020", "Boone's Farm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRipple.\n\n\tAll answers above refer to notoriously \"lowbrow,\" inexpensive wines...but Martin specifically states, \"I ordered that '84 Ripple Blanc you like.\"  When the waiter pours it into the glass, the glass melts as though doused in acid.  Heh. \n"}, {"text": "Hillary mildly criticizes the United States while dancing with Nick.  One of the things she maligns is American television.  She makes some concessions, though, admitting that certain TV shows were in fact \"okay.\"  Which one did she NOT name as being acceptable?", "correct": "\"All in the Family\"", "options": ["She named all of these shows", "\"M*A*S*H\"", "\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"All in the Family\".\n\n\tHillary: \"'M*A*S*H' was okay, and the old 'Mary Tyler Moore Show'.\" \n"}, {"text": "Since Nick speaks very little German (despite the language tape), Hillary orders dinner for them both.  The dish that eventually arrives at their table is entirely composed of parts of a pig.  What part of the pig is NOT included in the dish?", "correct": "the snout", "options": ["They are all included in the dish", "the genitals", "the hoof"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe snout.\n\n\tHillary orders roast swine knuckles poached with flaming hog testicles.  Somewhere, the Iron Chef was listening... \n"}, {"text": "According to Hillary, the etymological meaning of her name incorporates a reference to a particular part of the human anatomy.  Which part?", "correct": "the breasts", "options": ["the buttocks", "the genitals", "the legs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe breasts.\n\n\tHillary: \"It's a German name.  It means 'she whose bosoms [sic] defy gravity'.\"  You go, Hillary. \n"}, {"text": "Nick sings a song, much to everyone's surprise, at the restaurant where he first meets Hillary.  What is it?", "correct": "\"Tutti Frutti\"", "options": ["\"Hound Dog\"", "\"Teddy Bear\"", "\"Jailhouse Rock\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Tutti Frutti\".\n\n\tIn keeping with the Elvis ribbing, I suppose.  I love the sexagenarian orchestra getting into the groove...especially the old guy who trashes an electric guitar at the end of the sequence. \n"}, {"text": "Hillary needs to get in touch of the leader of the underground resistance.  What is this man's code-name?", "correct": "The Torch", "options": ["The Raven", "The Flame", "The Falcon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Torch.\n\n\tAnd he turns out to be Hillary's long-lost childhood love.  Small world, hmm? \n"}, {"text": "Hillary and Nick attend a performance of the ballet \"Swan Lake.\"", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIt's actually \"The Nutcracker Suite.\" \n"}, {"text": "Nick winds up spending some time in a German prison cell.  What unusual item can be seen in this cell?", "correct": "a Cuisinart", "options": ["a waterbed", "a hot tub", "a pinball machine"], "explanation": "\n\n\na Cuisinart.\n\n\tA Cuisinart sits on a shelf behind Nick's head as Martin sits on the bed and explains Nick's problematic situation. \n"}, {"text": "General Streck introduces Nick to two of his torture experts.  Finish his description of one of them: \"Klaus is a moron who knows only what he reads in _____________________.\"", "correct": "\"The New York Post\"", "options": ["\"TV Guide\"", "\"The National Enquirer\"", "\"The Weekly World News\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The New York Post\".\n\n\tPoor Klaus. \n"}, {"text": "True to Streck's description of him, Klaus is holding a periodical under his arm.  Whose face and name appear on its cover?", "correct": "Olivia Newton-John", "options": ["Nancy Reagan", "Jane Fonda", "Zsa Zsa Gabor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOlivia Newton-John.\n\n\tThe headline reads, \"Maniac Killer Stalks Olivia Newton-John.\"  Stay tuned for part two of this quiz! \n"}]}
