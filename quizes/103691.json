{"id": "103691", "name": "Kundun Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "   Movies H-K", "K"], "questions": [{"text": "Because 'Kundun' is such a visually stunning movie, wonderfully filmed throughout, the director deserves a mention here.  Who directed this multi-layered masterpiece?", "correct": "Martin Scorsese", "options": ["Zhang Yimou", "Bernardo Bertolucci", "Ang Lee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartin Scorsese.\n\n\tAs surprising as this may seem, Martin Scorsese, known for his 'gangster' films, was the director of 'Kundun'.  Scorsese's excellent work not only includes the lovely filming of the movie, but also the coordination and training of several dozen lay actors (see question 10).  I think that Roger Deakins, the director of photography, also deserves a mention here...I think he may have learned a thing or two from watching Zhang Yimou films? \n"}, {"text": "Another striking and prominent feature in this film is the lovely soundtrack.  Throughout the film the rhythms and beats keep one's ears just as focused as one's eyes.  Which composer created the extraordinary soundtrack for 'Kundun'?", "correct": "Philip Glass", "options": ["John Adams", "John Cage", "Gian Carlo Menotti"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhilip Glass.\n\n\tPhilip Glass, who is most known for his minimalist works, including the operas 'Einstein on the Beach' and 'Akhnaten', also has produced the score for a number of films.  Glass employs both traditional and modern instruments in his work, and makes excellent use of native instruments as well.  In this film he employs the 'rag-dung' (giant Tibetan horns) for some effect! \n"}, {"text": "Near the beginning and the end of the film we see a large sand 'painting' which has been painstakingly created by Tibetan monks.  These sand drawings, very common in Tibetan culture, are shaped as what?", "correct": "Mandalas", "options": ["Buddhas", "Pagodas", "Stupas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMandalas.\n\n\tA Mandala (which means 'circle' in Sanskrit) is a graphic symbolization of the universe, circular in shape.  Within the mandala are multiple images of the Buddha and other figures.  Monks work for months on end to create these very intricate, multi-colored sand drawings using mostly their hands and simple instruments.  When they have finished, they sweep it away, as is depicted near the end of the film.  These actions symbolize how fleeting this life is... \n"}, {"text": "What nickname does the Dalai Lama's family use to refer to him as a child?", "correct": "Lhamo", "options": ["Reting", "Rumpuche", "Boomba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLhamo.\n\n\tThe Dalai Lama is called 'Lhamo' (the protector).  This indicates that his family envisioned him to be a great Lama one day...somehow they knew!  Later, he is called Kundun by the various Lamas, servants, and government officials.  Kundun means 'the presence' in the Tibetan language.  The name 'Dalai Lama' means 'ocean of wisdom'. \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  As a child, the Dalai Lama is depicted as being  constantly tranquil and well-behaved in this film.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually quite the opposite.  The boy is depicted as being naughty...disobeying his parents, pulling on his father's mustache, whining and crying, etc.  I imagine that the Dalai Lama insisted that things be depicted this way, that he is a regular man with regular human frailties. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Regent who seeks out and discovers Kundun, the child who will be the next Dalai Lama?", "correct": "Reting Rimpoche", "options": ["Jigme Tsarong", "Gyatso Lukhang", "Lobsang Samten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReting Rimpoche.\n\n\tReting Rimpoche is depicted as a wise and powerful nobleman who has served as Regent during the interim between the death of the 13th Dalai Lama and the coming of age of the 14th.  Unfortunately, he also seems to have been involved in some corrupt activities and is later imprisoned, eventually meeting his death in captivity. Was this man really corrupt or were political games afoot?  The young Dalai Lama does not find out...as his advisors say, 'this is not for your eyes'.  I think Scorsese, and surely his advisor, the Dalai Lama, wanted to express that the governmental situation in Tibet was rather corrupt at this point in history. \n"}, {"text": "How many different actors portray the Dalai Lama in 'Kundun'?", "correct": "4", "options": ["2", "6", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4.\n\n\tThe four actors portray Kundun at the ages of 2, 5, 10 and as an adult.  Again, these kids were untrained, and do a rather good job I must say. \n"}, {"text": "As an adult, the Dalai Lama meets with which world leader in this film?", "correct": "Mao Zedong", "options": ["Joseph Stalin", "Harry S Truman", "Mahatma Gandhi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMao Zedong.\n\n\tAfter the Chinese seize control of Tibet in 1950, the Dalai Lama chooses to find compromise, if possible, with the Chinese.  He visits Mao in Beijing to see if he might work with him.  Unfortunately, the Chinese Communists had no intention of sharing power with the Dalai Lama, only wishing his consent as a 'puppet'.  Mao even goes so far as to shock Kundun with the remark that 'religion is poison'.  Probably not the best message for a religious leader to hear... \n"}, {"text": "Near the end of the film, the Dalai Lama is depicted as fleeing Tibet, in order to escape Chinese repression.  To which country does he travel?", "correct": "India", "options": ["Bhutan", "Nepal", "Burma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndia.\n\n\tIn 1959, the Dalai Lama made his escape from Tibet and soon after set up a Tibetan exile government in Darmsala, India. \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  All of the actors depicting Tibetan roles in 'Kundun' are Tibetan by ancestry.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMartin Scorcese decided to have an authentic cast for this film, I applaud this decision.  Though the acting isn't perfect, it's surprisingly good considering that the actors were not formally trained.  In fact, it makes me wonder...wouldn't all films be better with this sense of reality imposed? \n"}]}
