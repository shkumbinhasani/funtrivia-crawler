In which Harry Potter-related book do we hear his name?", "correct": "Quidditch Through the Ages", "options": ["Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them", "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", "The Tales of Beedle the Bard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuidditch Through the Ages.\n\n\t'Quidditch Through the Ages' was a book written by J.K. Rowling in aid of Comic Relief, a charity who raise money in order to provide improved living conditions to poverty stricken areas of the world.\r The book is all about Quidditch (obviously), the teams that play the game worldwide and the development of the broomstick. So if you didn't remember the name, hopefully the broomstick led you in the right direction. \n"}, {"text": "B - Bathilda Bagshot wrote 'A History of Magic', one of Hermione's favourite books. In 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' we find out where she lives. Where is that?", "correct": "Godric's Hollow", "options": ["Little Hangleton", "Budleigh Babberton", "The Burrow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGodric's Hollow.\n\n\tIn 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' we discover that Godric's Hollow was quite a haven for magical families. Not only did the Potters live there, but also the Dumbledores and Bathilda Bagshot (with her nephew Gellert Grindelwald). \r However, after the death of Ariana Dumbledore, Grindelwald leaves and it seems that Bathilda was left alone for quite a long time. She meets an unfortunate end in 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' as she is possessed by Lord Voldemort and Nagini escapes from her body. \n"}, {"text": "C - Cho Chang met Harry in the Owlery one morning as she was sending a Birthday present to her mother. Did she have her own owl?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThis happens in 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' when Harry gets up early to send a letter to Sirius. When he is at the Owlery, Cho is also there as she says that she only just remembered her mother's birthday and is sending her a late present. While Harry uses Hedwig to send his letter, Cho uses one of the school barn owls.\r After they have finished sending their letters, Argus Filch storms into the Owlery attempting to prevent Harry from sending the package which had fortunately already left. He claimed to have been tipped off about Harry ordering dungbombs through owl mail but the most likely reason for his interruption was that he was sent by Professor Umbridge as part of her control over Hogwarts. \n"}, {"text": "D - Dilys Derwent was one of the portraits that Dumbledore called on the night that Arthur Weasley was attacked. Other than in the Headmaster's office, where does her portrait hang?", "correct": "St. Mungo's", "options": ["Ministry of Magic", "Grimmauld Place", "Gringotts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Mungo's\n\n\tHarry has a vision of Arthur Weasley's attack through the eyes of Nagini, Voldemort's snake. After waking quickly he hastens to find a teacher and Professor McGonagall accompanies him to Dumbledore's office.\r Dumbledore leaps into action straight away and calls on Everard, a previous headmaster, to check on Arthur Weasley in the Ministry of Magic. He then calls upon Dilys, whose portrait hangs in St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies, to see whether or not he arrives at the hospital. He also calls on Phineas Nigellus to notify Sirius that Harry and the Weasley children will be coming to Grimmauld Place. \n"}, {"text": "Skipping E and on to:\n\nF - Florean Fortescue was the owner of the Ice Cream Parlour in Diagon Alley. In 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' he helped Harry with his homework. In which subject was this? ", "correct": "History of Magic", "options": ["Care of Magical Creatures", "Transfiguration", "Charms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHistory of Magic.\n\n\tWhen Harry left the Dursley's house in 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' he went to stay in the Leaky Cauldron after Cornelius Fudge found him on his way to Diagon Alley. He then spent the remainder of his holidays exploring the shops in Diagon Alley; some of his time he spent outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour where he was provided with free ice cream and helped with his History of Magic homework.\r Having not been mentioned very often throughout the series, Fortescue doesn't appear again until 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'. Unfortunately this is only to be kidnapped by the Death Eaters which causes his ice cream parlour in Diagon Alley to close. \n"}, {"text": "G - Gregory Goyle was drafted in to the Slytherin Quidditch team. What position does he play?", "correct": "Beater", "options": ["Seeker", "Keeper", "Chaser"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeater.\n\n\tBoth Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were brought into the Slytherin Quidditch team in 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', both as beaters. They joined their leader Draco Malfoy who already played seeker on the team.\r When Gryffindor beat Slytherin, Malfoy enraged both Harry and the Weasleys by insulting their families and the Weasley's lack of money. This resulted in a display of 'muggle duelling' which caused Professor Umbridge to give lifetime Quidditch bans to Harry, Fred and George. \n"}, {"text": "H - Helga Hufflepuff was the founder of Hufflepuff house. Her only known descendant was Hepzibah Smith, who owned two of the objects that would later become Horcruxes.

While Slytherin looked for cunning, Gryffindor for chivalry and Ravenclaw for intelligence, Hufflepuff pledged to teach everyone and treat them equally.\r Hepzibah Smith was a descendant of Helga Hufflepuff and she was also a great collector of antiques and other tidbits. Among her collection was Slytherin's locket which she purchased from Borgin and Burke (who had themselves paid only ten galleons for it from a desperate Merope Gaunt). She also owned Hufflepuff's Cup which seems to have been passed down as a family heirloom. \n"}, {"text": "I - Inigo Imago was the author of 'The Dream Oracle'. Which teacher taught Harry from this book?", "correct": "Professor Trelawney", "options": ["Professor McGonagall", "Professor Vector", "Professor Sprout"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProfessor Trelawney.\n\n\tProfessor Trelawney is one of the divination teachers at Hogwarts and as 'The Dream Oracle' is a divination based book it follows that she taught him from it. Harry and Ron didn't have to buy 'The Dream Oracle' from Diagon Alley it was a school textbook that Trelawney handed out in 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'.\r Although Harry and Ron weren't much good at dream interpretation, they had great fun trying to interpret what each other's dreams meant when it was clearly an exercise in futility. Hermione dropped divination in the third year after claiming that it was all a load of rubbish and storming out of the classroom. \n"}, {"text": "J - Joey Jenkins was a beater in which Quidditch team? *Hint - Ron's favourite team*", "correct": "Chudley Cannons", "options": ["Tutshill Tornadoes", "Holyhead Harpies", "Puddlemere United"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChudley Cannons.\n\n\tJoey Jenkins is in a book called 'Flying with the Cannons' which Ron bought Harry for Christmas. The Chudley Cannons are Ron's favourite Quidditch team even if they aren't very good (ninth in the league according to Ron) and his bedroom is plastered with posters of the players and other bright orange Chudley Cannons memorabilia. \n"}, {"text": "Skipping K and on to:\n\nL - Luna Lovegood was one of the group that travelled to the Ministry of Magic in 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'. How many were in that group?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Three", "Twelve", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tThe six that travelled to London were Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna. Originally Harry was planning to go on his own but Ron and Hermione insisted that they cared about Sirius almost as much as he did and that they would come as well. Then the others said that this was their chance to do something real for Dumbledore's Army and so all six of them went to the Ministry.\r As Professor Umbridge had taken Harry's broom and she also controlled the Floo Network, the group were forced to fly to London on a group of Thestrals who were attracted to the blood on Harry's robes. Using their excellent sense of direction, the Thestrals took them to the visitor's entrance of the Ministry of Magic and they went on to fight the Death Eaters. \n"}, {"text": "M - Minerva McGonagall pledges to support Harry in his quest towards which profession?", "correct": "Auror", "options": ["Dragon Handler", "Seeker", "Death Eater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAuror.\n\n\tIn 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' Harry has to decide which subjects he is going to take at NEWT level so as to pursue a career. He decides that he would like to be an auror, or dark wizard catcher and proposes this to Professors McGonagall and Umbridge at a careers consultancy meeting. \r Professor Umbridge says that the Ministry of Magic will never employ Harry (probably because he goes against what they are saying about the return of Voldemort). This angers Professor McGonagall and she therefore pledges to aid Harry with any work that he need to do in order to reach the standard necessary to become an auror. \n"}, {"text": "Skipping N and O and on to:\n\nP - Peter Pettigrew. What is unique about Pettigrew amongst Death Eaters?", "correct": "He wasn't in Slytherin house", "options": ["He didn't go to school", "His wand is made of plastic", "His Dark Mark is on his right arm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe wasn't in Slytherin house.\n\n\tIn 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' Hagrid says 'There ain't a witch or wizard who went bad who weren't in Slytherin House'. However this doesn't mean that witches and wizards who were in other houses can't go bad: Peter Pettigrew was in Gryffindor house with his friends Remus Lupin, James Potter and Sirius Black and he went very bad indeed.Pettigrew (Wormtail) became a Death Eater and acted almost as slave to Lord Voldemort. He would have been killed in 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' but Harry spared his life and this led to his downfall in the final book as he was strangled by his own hand. \n"}, {"text": "Q - Quirinus Quirrell was Harry's Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher in his first year. Where did Professor Quirrell claim to have gotten his turban from?", "correct": "An African Prince", "options": ["A Russian Tsar", "Lord Voldemort", "Professor Dumbledore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn African Prince.\n\n\tProfessor Quirrell claims to have been given the turban by an African Prince. This may be true but the most likely explanation is that he had to buy it when he was possessed by Lord Voldemort and there was clearly a noticeable protrusion on the back of his head.\r Voldemort was possessing Quirrell in order to capture the Philospher's Stone and return himself to a body and immortality. The stone was protected by many different enchantments and Voldemort used Quirrell's body to discover these and get past them into the last chamber. However, when Harry thwarted Voldemort he left Quirrell for dead. \n"}, {"text": "R - Rowena Ravenclaw was one of the four founders of Hogwarts and had a daughter called Helena.

In her youth she stole the diadem from her mother and went into hiding in Albania. As her mother grew older she wanted to see her daughter and sent the Baron to retrieve her.\r She refused to accompany him and in a moment of anger he killed her. Having realised what he had done he proceeded to kill himself and the diadem was left in a forest in Albania. However, when Tom Riddle came to Hogwarts he charmed the information out of the Grey Lady and he retrieved the diadem from Albania and turned it into a Horcrux which was then hidden in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts. \n"}, {"text": "S - Stan Shunpike was the conductor on the Knight Bus. When Harry sees him at the Quidditch World Cup, what audacious claim does he make to a group of Veela?", "correct": "That he was about to become Minister for Magic", "options": ["That he flew to the moon on a broomstick", "Thst he owns Gringotts bank", "That he jumped from the Top Box in the Stadium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat he was about to become Minister for Magic.\n\n\tVeela were the Bulgarian mascots at the Quidditch World Cup. Normally they appear as extremely beautiful women who have an irresistible control over men. However, when they're angry they turn into harpy-esque creatures who screech violently.\r When the Death Eaters were rioting in the campsite after the game everyone fled into the surrounding woodland. While Harry, Ron and Hermione were in the woods they saw Stan Shunpike talking to a group of the Veela and claiming that he was about to become the Minister for Magic.

As the Room of Requirement provides you with what you need (they were doing Defence Against the Dark Arts) there was a bookshelf full of self-defense books and 'Curses and Counter-Curses' was amongst them. \n"}, {"text": "W - Willy Widdershins. When he overhears the forming of Dumbledore's Army in The Hog's Head, who does he report this information to?", "correct": "Dolores Umbridge", "options": ["Argus Filch", "Lord Voldemort", "Albus Dumbledore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDolores Umbridge.\n\n\tHermione suggests that they hold the introductory meeting for the DA in the Hog's Head (NB: They weren't called the DA at the time) as no other students went in there.

Mundungus Fletcher was also there dressed as a witch and informed the Order of their plans.\r This event caused Professor Umbridge to introduce the Decree which disbanded all clubs and societies in the school which not only led to problems for the DA but also for the Gryffindor Quidditch team against whom Umbridge seemed to hold a grudge. \n"}, {"text": "With X, Y and Z out of the way, here are a few other alliterative character questions.\n\nWhich of these character names doesn't begin with A?", "correct": "The Centaur who becomes a teacher", "options": ["The wizard in the water queue at the Quidditch World Cup who was wearing a nightdress", "Hagrid's giant spider in the Forbidden Forest", "Ginny Weasley's Pygmy Puff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Centaur who becomes a teacher.\n\n\tHagrid's giant spider in the Forbidden Forest is called Aragog.

He is seen again later in the same book when he comes to rescue Harry in the Chamber of Secrets itself. Unfortunately Fawkes leaves Hogwarts with the death of Dumbledore in 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'.\r Rubeus Hagrid's three-headed dog was called Fluffy and he was used as the guard for the trap door into the chambers that lead to the Philosopher's Stone.

The only time she left the position was when the portrait was slashed by Sirius Black and had to be restored by Filch. It was during this period that Sir Cadogan became the guardian portrait.\r The poltergeist at Hogwarts is called Peeves. He spends his time causing mayhem and singing classics such as 'Oh Potter you rotter...'. \n"}]}
