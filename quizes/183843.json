Which of the early films in which De Niro appeared was alternately titled 'The Swap'?", "correct": "Sam's Song", "options": ["Trois Chambres \u00e0 Manhattan", "Greetings", "The Wedding Party"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam's Song.\n\n\tThe 1969 film 'Sam's Song' was also alternatively known as 'Line of Fire'.  'The Swap' was the title adopted after a 1979 re-cut of the film.  'Greetings' and 'The Wedding Party' were both directed by Brian De Palma, a director with whom De Niro would work again in the future.  Oddly, in 'The Wedding Party', De Niro's name was misspelled 'Robert Denero' in the credits. \n"}, {"text": "Robert De Niro was featured in the 1973 film 'Bang the Drum Slowly', portraying baseball player Bruce Pearson.  Was this the only baseball-related film in which De Niro starred?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tI knew you'd see through my ruse.  Robert De Niro also was featured in the 1996 film 'The Fan', co-starring Wesley Snipes.  In that film, De Niro plays an obsessed baseball fan, rather than a player himself.  As usual, in both cases, his acting was marvelous. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps overshadowed by some of De Niro's later work is his acting performance in the 1973 film 'Mean Streets'.  Which of these is NOT true about this fascinating film set in Little Italy, New York?", "correct": "It garnered Robert De Niro his first Oscar nomination", "options": ["De Niro won an award for Best Supporting Actor from the National Society of Film Critics", "It marked the first collaboration between De Niro and Martin Scorsese", "It marked the first time that De Niro appeared in a film with Harvey Keitel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt garnered Robert De Niro his first Oscar nomination.\n\n\tDe Niro's first Oscar nomination would come in 1975 for his role in 'Godfather II'.  The Best Supporting Actor victory from the National Society of Film Critics was one of two acting awards he won in 1974 (the other being for 'Bang the Drum Slowly', again as a supporting actor, from the NYFCC).  \r 'Mean Streets' marked the first of several fruitful collaborations with both Scorsese and Keitel for Mr. De Niro. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following actors did NOT co-star with Robert De Niro in the 1974 film classic 'The Godfather: Part II'?", "correct": "Marlon Brando", "options": ["Robert Duvall", "Al Pacino", "Diane Keaton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarlon Brando.\n\n\tThe 1974 film 'The Godfather: Part II' featured De Niro as Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando in the first installment.

Upon which author's work was that film based?", "correct": "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "options": ["J. D. Salinger", "Thornton Wilder", "Ernest Hemingway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald\n\n\tLots of interesting tidbits about this film.  While Fitzgerald wrote the book upon which the film was based, the screenplay was written by the famed playwright Harold Pinter.  This was the last movie directed by classic Hollywood director Elia Kazan.  It featured acting performances by Jack Nicholson, Tony Curtis and Robert Mitchum, among others.  The story is supposedly based on the life of Irving Thalberg, one time head of MGM studios. \n"}, {"text": "Robert De Niro was a part of an all-star cast in the 1978 film 'The Deer Hunter'.  Did he win a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in that Michael Cimino-directed film?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNo, but he did receive his first such nomination for 'The Deer Hunter'.  His first Best Actor award would have to wait until 1981, when he garnered the Oscar nod for his role in the 1980 film 'Raging Bull'.

Also featuring the acting of James Woods, Joe Pesci, Treat Williams, Tuesday Weld and others, it's a classic cinematic treat that doesn't get as much attention as it should. \n"}, {"text": "In which film does Robert De Niro play a Spanish slave hunter in South America who turns himself towards Christ, becoming a member of the Jesuit order?", "correct": "The Mission", "options": ["The Enchanted Forest", "The Order", "Paraguay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mission.\n\n\tDe Niro co-stars with Jeremy Irons, Aidan Quinn and Liam Neeson in the beautiful and tragic 1986 film 'The Mission'.

What makes the film even more interesting is the serious turn taken by Jerry Lewis for his role as a kidnapped talk show host.  Despite the shift in roles for the featured actors (and the director), the film really does work! \n"}, {"text": "With which film director, and member of Monty Python, did Robert De Niro work in the 1985 sci-fi/comedy 'Brazil'?", "correct": "Terry Gilliam", "options": ["Terry Jones", "Graham Chapman", "Eric Idle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerry Gilliam.\n\n\tTerry Gilliam's 'Brazil' was another interesting acting turn for De Niro, who again plays a comedic role as Archibald Tuttle (his good friends call him 'Harry'), a futuristic repairman.  De Niro proved his incredible acting range with this film.\r There are so many great De Niro performances that they all can't fit into one quiz, hence this is only part I.  Thank you for playing; if you enjoyed this I hope you'll check out some of my other quizzes. \n"}]}
