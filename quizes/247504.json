Which of these is not a two-word phrase that Henry uses to describe 'Big Mac'?", "correct": "Head honcho", "options": ["Head man", "Big monk", "Big cheese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHead honcho.\n\n\tHenry's giddy behavior leads him to spew various nonsense about General MacArthur's arrival.  He calls MacArthur the 'big monk', among other things, and continues the description as follows: 'He's the biggest, highest, monkiest of all.  They don't come any monkier!'  MacArthur is paying this brief visit to the 4077th because it has the best survival rate in all of Korea. \n"}, {"text": "Henry is not only excited for the 4077th in general, he also anticipates that MacArthur's visit will boost his personal stock.

Whose much smaller picture is right next to MacArthur's picture on the wall?", "correct": "Harry Truman", "options": ["Jesus", "Henry Blake", "Macarthur's wife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Truman.\n\n\tAs if to poke fun at General MacArthur's ego, a large picture of the General is juxtaposed against a tiny picture of his boss, Harry Truman, to whom he was politically opposed.  For Frank and Margaret, this is perfectly appropriate! \n"}, {"text": "Margaret claims that her father fought together with Douglas MacArthur.  In what country did these two great Americans fight side-by-side, according to Margaret?", "correct": "The Philippines", "options": ["Germany", "Japan", "France"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Philippines.\n\n\tMargaret claims that her father and MacArthur 'fought the Huks together in the Philippines'.  The problem with this is that MacArthur wasn't fighting the Huks when he was in the Philippines, but rather the Japanese.  The Huks were Communist guerrilla rebels who also fought against Japanese occupation during World War II.  They only turned against U.S. and mainstream Philippine forces after the war, in MacArthur's absence.\r Margaret claims that at Christmas her father and General MacArthur exchanged shrunken tribesman's heads.

During the rehearsal, Klinger storms in with one of his loveliest dresses and begs to kiss General Radar's pipe. \n"}, {"text": "General MacArthur indeed pays a visit to the 4077th, but does his jeep ever actually stop in the camp?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tUnfortunately, despite all the preparations for the General's visit, MacArthur does not even have the courtesy to stop and have an actually visit to the 4077th.  Rather, his jeep just drives through and he salutes the M*A*S*H personnel.  Radar is still dressed as the General during his very brief visit, but he loses the cornpipe from his mouth when he salutes. \n"}, {"text": "Klinger is prepared for the General's arrival at the 4077th.  As what American icon is Klinger dressed for MacArthur's visit?", "correct": "Statue of Liberty", "options": ["Betty Crocker", "Aunt Jemima", "Raggedy Ann"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStatue of Liberty.\n\n\tThis is by far Klinger's most outrageous costume during the run of 'M*A*S*H'.  Not only is he dressed as the Statue of Liberty, he also has a torch in his hand, complete with sparklers.  General MacArthur seems completely unphased by Klinger's outfit, and gives the crazy Corporal a proud salute!\r Thanks for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
