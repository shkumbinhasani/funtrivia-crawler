{"id": "215902", "name": "The Last Few Episodes--Part 1 Quiz | 'Six Feet Under' - Seasons and Episodes | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Six Feet Under", "Episodes"], "questions": [{"text": "Why doesn't Nate's memorial service include a viewing?", "correct": "He did not want to be embalmed.", "options": ["He is an organ donor.", "His family members are too distraught.", "He requested cremation."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe did not want to be embalmed.\n\n\tNate has a \"green\" funeral. He is not embalmed and he has no casket. He is buried in a cloth shroud in a beautiful wilderness area. His late wife Lisa Kimmel Fisher would have approved. \n"}, {"text": "After Nate's death, David keeps \"seeing\" an evil man in a hooded red sweatshirt. Ultimately, who does the man turn out to be?", "correct": "part of David himself", "options": ["Keith", "David's mother, Ruth", "David's dad, Nathaniel"], "explanation": "\n\n\npart of David himself.\n\n\tAfter David embraces the man (who turns out to have David's own terrified face), he begins to recover from his intense grief and paranoid fear. \n"}, {"text": "Whom does Claire marry (in the future as it's shown at the end of the final episode)?", "correct": "Ted, Claire's former co-worker", "options": ["Billy Chenowith (Brenda's brother)", "Russell, a fellow art student", "Arthur, a former intern at Fisher and Diaz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTed, Claire's former co-worker.\n\n\tClaire probably begins to fall in love with Ted on the night of Nate's seizure, when Ted spends all night with her in the hospital. He's a Republican (so he and she have opposite political viewpoints), but he's very supportive of Claire's artistic career. \n"}, {"text": "In Brenda's mind, how does (the late) Nate feel about their baby, Willa? ", "correct": "He taunts Brenda by saying their child is defective.", "options": ["He assures Brenda that their premature baby will be just fine.", "He says he can't wait until Willa can join him in the afterlife.", "He tells Brenda that he loves Willa far more than Maya."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe taunts Brenda by saying their child is defective.\n\n\tAfter Ruth comforts Brenda, the new mom (and struggling step-mom) seems to experience a catharthis. She has a new fantasy in which Nate (and his dad) appear next to Willa's crib. Nate finally cradles the baby and assures Brenda that he will love Willa forever. It seems that Brenda's previous fantasies stemmed from her grief, anger, and self-hatred triggered by Nate's infidelity and cool, detached rejection just prior to his death. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Ruth living at the end of the final episode?", "correct": "at her sister's home in Topanga Canyon", "options": ["with Brenda, Maya, and Willa", "in her old home at the Fisher family's funeral home", "with George in his apartment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nat her sister's home in Topanga Canyon.\n\n\tWhen Ruth is horribly depressed she agrees to go and live with George, but as her grief lifts a bit she realizes that she can't do this.

He even joins an Internet news group on childcare. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Brenda ask Billy to move out?", "correct": "She has an incest dream.", "options": ["He behaves inappropriately with Claire's boyfriend.", "He tries to kiss her again.", "He behaves inappropriately with Maya."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe has an incest dream.\n\n\tAnd a very creepy dream it is.

Eventually he faces his \"demons\" and recovers. \n"}, {"text": "How does Bettina help Ruth cope with Nate's death?", "correct": "by encouraging her to take drugs", "options": ["by holding a seance during which Nate speaks to his mother", "by praying with her and Father Jack", "by convincing Brenda to let Maya live with Ruth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nby encouraging her to take drugs.\n\n\tIronically, Bettina, the friend who bullied Ruth's sister Sarah through detox, encourages Ruth to take pill after pill after pill. When Ruth worries about addiction, Bettina jokingly offers to help Ruth through detox if necessary. I love Kathy Bates as Bettina. Academy Award winner Bates directed many of the \"SFU\" episodes, too. \n"}, {"text": "What surprising behavior does Olivier display?", "correct": "He is very loving with little Willa.", "options": ["He makes a pass at Brenda.", "He breaks up with Margaret.", "He refuses to recommend Claire for a job."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is very loving with little Willa.\n\n\tOlivier not only comes through for Margaret on the day of Nate's memorial service, he recommends Claire for a prestigious photography job and helps care for little Willa. \n"}, {"text": "Who comes to take Maya away from Ruth and back to Brenda?", "correct": "Margaret", "options": ["Olivier", "George", "Billy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret.\n\n\tMargaret is fairly nasty to poor Ruth--no surprise--but perhaps Margaret is defending her daughter. \n"}, {"text": "By the end of the final episode, with whom is Maya living?", "correct": "with Brenda", "options": ["with Ruth", "with David and Keith", "with Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwith Brenda.\n\n\tAs far as Maya knows, Brenda is her mother, so it is probably best that she ends up with Brenda.
