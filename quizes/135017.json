This meant that Mrs. Melbury, Bill and Susan would have to give up their present furnished rooms and their current schools and move north on a permanent basis. \n"}, {"text": "What did Mrs.Melbury warn her children to look out for when they moved north?", "correct": "That she didn't let her standards of dress or behaviour decline.", "options": ["That the children didn't start using local Cumbrian dialect.", "That they didn't fall behind because of changing schools.", "That they would always obey the countryside code."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat she didn't let her standards of dress or behaviour decline.\n\n\tAs Mrs.Melbury puts it - there would be sometimes nobody to see her but the sheep. That, she thought, might tempt her to let herself go and she lists what they need to watch - \"hair, clothes, hands, anything....\" \n"}, {"text": "Which scene in Shakespeare was Bill reminded of when he staggered along the road in the pouring rain on the first night and considered turning back without getting any milk?", "correct": "Lancelot Gobbo's debate between conscience and temptation.", "options": ["Macbeth's scene with Banquo on the heath.", "The shipwreck of Viola in \"Twelfth Night\".", "King Lear's fury in the thunderstorm."], "explanation": "\n\n\nLancelot Gobbo's debate between conscience and temptation.\n\n\tBill describes his journey as a debate between his desire to go back to the cottage and the wish to get out of the rain and the dark. In the end he drops the milk jug and finds his way back to the cottage having been unsuccessful in his quest to reach the nearest neighbours. \n"}, {"text": "Why did Bill decide to let his sister have the bigger bedroom in the cottage?", "correct": "The smaller room he wanted was over the warm kitchen.", "options": ["He wanted to cheer her up after the long journey.", "The smaller room had a much nicer view.", "The smaller room was much closer to the bathroom."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe smaller room he wanted was over the warm kitchen.\n\n\tSusan claims that she needs a bigger room so that she can invite friends in and try clothes on. Bill is pretty sure that during the Lakeland winters the room over the heat of the kitchen will be the best one to be in at night. \n"}, {"text": "Apart from not wanting people looking at his back lawns what reason did Sir Alfred Askew give for keeping Bill and Susan off the island?", "correct": "The island was a bird sanctuary.", "options": ["The island was a site of archeological interest.", "The island was where he proposed building a cottage.", "The island contained many rare flowers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe island was a bird sanctuary.\n\n\tWhen an investigation is made it is clear that Sir Alfred Askew has only just come up with the idea of the island being a bird sanctuary. It does also prove to be a site of archeological interest but that is not something any of them know when he claims it is a bird sanctuary. \n"}, {"text": "Who or what is \"the Monstrosity\"?", "correct": "A vividly-striped canvas umbrella that fits over a garden-table.", "options": ["An old car that is constantly on the verge of falling apart.", "The name the local people give to Sir Alfred Askew.", "The shop in Winthwaite that sells all sorts of sweets."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA vividly-striped canvas umbrella that fits over a garden-table.\n\n\tThe \"Monstrosity\" proves to have an important influence on the course of the story. Miss Florey mistakes their cottage for a place which sells teas because she assumes the table has been put out especially for customers. Later the Melbury family decide it would be a good idea to actually \"do\" teas and make a small profit. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Bill get into trouble with Mr. Kingsford, the headmaster, on his first day at his new school?", "correct": "For being seen with the high school girls during the lunch hour.", "options": ["For accidentally going to the wrong lesson.", "For being cheeky to one of the teachers.", "For not wearing his cap whilst walking in Winthwaite."], "explanation": "\n\n\nFor being seen with the high school girls during the lunch hour.\n\n\tThe two girls that Bill met were his sister Susan and her new friend, the very attractive Penny Morchard.

She mentions the word \"elephants\" to him to suggest his Indian background. She then says the name \"Matson\" which was the one that Bill had overheard on the telephone. He responds in the way they had all hoped. \n"}, {"text": "How did Bill draw attention to himself when they were chased through the woods on Sir Alfred's estate?", "correct": "He lets out a long blood-curdling yell.", "options": ["He whistles loudly in three quick bursts.", "He deliberately steps on a branch so that it cracks loudly.", "He shouts out a false name as though calling to a friend."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe lets out a long blood-curdling yell.\n\n\tBill knows that if they are chased it will be Penny with her limp who will be the most vulnerable.

What name do they use?", "correct": "Operation Amphibian", "options": ["Operation Treasure", "Operation Dawn Wind", "Operation Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOperation Amphibian.\n\n\tA large part of the preparations for \"Operation Amphibian\" are connected with assembling, transporting and rowing Tim's collapsible boat. In order to disguise what they are talking about when speaking from the phone in the village shop Bill talks of \"Amphibious archeology\" which Penny spoonerises as \"archious amphibiology\". \n"}, {"text": "Why did Tim have a problem when riding with Bill into Winthwaite after they had made their find on the island?", "correct": "He had to ride Susan's bike which was much too small.", "options": ["He had hurt his leg and riding caused it to ache.", "He got a puncture and fell off.", "The rain fell heavily and he had no mudguards."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe had to ride Susan's bike which was much too small.\n\n\tTim complained that he felt like \"an elephant on a fairy-cycle\" as he struggled along on bicycle that was much too small.

The objects found were thus Treasure Trove and the finders (i.e.Bill, Tim, Penny and Susan) were entitled to a reward. \n"}, {"text": "How did the newspaper man succeed in causing Penny to be embarrassed?", "correct": "by suggesting that she might want a relationship with Bill in the future.", "options": ["by taking her photograph when she wasn't ready", "by calling her the heroine of the whole story.", "by asking her about her limp."], "explanation": "\n\n\nby suggesting that she might want a relationship with Bill in the future.\n\n\tWhen Penny is adamant that she is not Bill's sister the newspaperman suggests that it \"might mean more than one thing\". At this suggestion Penny goes \"pink right up to her high cheek-bones.\" \n"}]}
