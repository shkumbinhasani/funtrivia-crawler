Millipedes have a hard, waxy, chitinous exoskeleton, while centipedes lack any hard or waxy covering. Millipedes are primarily scavengers, while most centipedes are carnivorous. \n"}, {"text": "What does \"centipede\" mean?", "correct": "hundred feet & hundred foot & 100 feet & 100 foot", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nhundred feet & hundred foot & 100 feet & 100 foot.\n\n\tThroughout history, man has been impressed by the legginess of these animals! \n"}, {"text": "Some millipedes glow in the dark. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOne small genus found in California is bioluminescent. It is also blind. No one knows why the luminescence evolved. \n"}, {"text": "Some people keep millipedes as pets.\n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe African giant black millipede is the most commonly kept. Some keepers have received mild chemical burns from their \"pets.\" \n"}, {"text": "Centipedes and millipedes are insects.\n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThey are arthropods. There are several major groups of arthropods. Both centipedes and millipedes are in the subphylum Myriapoda. Millipedes are class Diplopoda, centipedes are class Chilopoda. Other groups of arthropods include subphylum Insecta- the insects; subphylum Crustacea- lobsters, shrimp, crabs and the like; and subphylum Arachnida- spiders, scorpions, ticks and the like. \n"}, {"text": "What do most centipedes eat? \n", "correct": "Insects and other small animals", "options": ["Stored goods", "Plants and decaying matter", "Soil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsects and other small animals.\n\n\tMany centipedes are adapted to be swift hunters. \n"}, {"text": "What do most millipedes eat?\n", "correct": "Plants and decaying matter", "options": ["Insects and other small animals", "Stored goods", "Soil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlants and decaying matter.\n\n\tMost millipedes are found in damp places eating damp things. \n"}, {"text": "Some centipedes live in the ocean. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tHydroschendyla submarina, a member of a family that usually lives underground, lives in oceans off the coast of Europe. \n"}, {"text": "Thousands of millipedes sometimes invade homes.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDamp conditions can cause accelerated breeding rates, leading to harmless but messy \"millipede invasions.\" \n"}, {"text": "How fast can the fastest centipede move? \n", "correct": "20 inches per second", "options": ["15 miles an hour", "5 miles an hour", "15 feet per minute"], "explanation": "\n\n\n20 inches per second.\n\n\tThat's a little over one mile per hour, but it looks much faster when the centipede is scuttling across your basement floor! \n"}, {"text": "Which is NOT a way that centipedes defend themselves? \n", "correct": "Biting", "options": ["Hiding", "Poison-injecting claws", "Pinching hind legs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBiting.\n\n\tThe first pair of a centipede's legs, below the mouth, are modified into claws called \"forcipules\" that can inject venom into both prey and enemies. The Chinese thought this poison could cure rheumatism, kidney stones, skin disease and scarring. The hind legs of some centipedes also have pinchers, but these are not venomous. \n"}, {"text": "Which is NOT a way that millipedes defend themselves?", "correct": "Venomous bite", "options": ["Porcupine-like quills", "Spraying toxic gas", "Secreting noxious poison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVenomous bite.\n\n\tSome millipedes can spray a toxic brew containing hydrocyanic acid. Many millipedes secrete a poisonous liquid from glands called \"repugnatorial glands\" through pores on their bodies. This liquid contains benzoquinones and can actually cause chemical burns that can take up to 14 months to disappear. One species of millipede, Polyxenus fasciculatus, is covered with porcupine-like quills that can actually penetrate and kill attacking invertebrates. \n"}, {"text": "The \"bite\" of a centipede is often fatal. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIt isn't really a bite, as the venom is injected from modified claws. Most often, the venom causes effects similar to that of a bee sting- swelling, itchiness, hives and pain. There is a reported fatality caused by the large tropical centipede Scolopendra subspinipes. The victim was a 7 year old Filipino girl who was bitten on the head. \n"}, {"text": "Some people/cultures eat centipedes. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tA visitor to Central Africa reported that this was the most disgusting cuisine of his trip! \n"}, {"text": "How many species of centipedes and millipedes occur in the USA? ", "correct": "About 1000", "options": ["About 10,000", "About 100", "About 100,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbout 1000.\n\n\tMost centipedes and millipedes are found in the tropics, as they thrive in moist, warm locations. There are about 13,000 species worldwide. \n"}, {"text": "Most centipedes and millipedes give birth to live young.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMost lay from 20-300 eggs.

", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSome species make nests and tend the eggs and then the newly-hatched young for up to 50 days.

It is commonly found in basements, where it feeds on cockroaches and other insects. By what common name is it known? ", "correct": "House centipede", "options": ["Spider centipede", "Long-legged centipede", "Commensal centipede"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHouse centipede.\n\n\tScutigera coleoptera, the house centipede, is the only species of centipede that actually reproduces in dwellings. It takes 3 years to mature. The scutigerid centipedes have compound eyes (most centipedes are either eyeless or have one or a few eye facets) and are active in daylight as swift hunters. \n"}, {"text": "Centipedes and millipedes carry diseases that are dangerous to humans.\n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThey are not known to carry any diseases. Centipedes are beneficial, as they eat so many insects. Millipedes can damage gardens. \n"}]}
