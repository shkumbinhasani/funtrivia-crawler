{"id": "106643", "name": "Moral Issues in Movies Quiz | Classic Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Classic Movies", "Classics - Tough"], "questions": [{"text": "In \"Fail Safe\", President Henry Fonda decides to make up for the destruction of a Soviet city by voluntarily destroying an American one. Which U.S. city does he select?", "correct": "New York", "options": ["Chicago", "Washington, D.C.", "Los Angeles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York.\n\n\tInteresting issue. To maintain the uneasy \"balance\" of the Cold War, the President avoids major conflict by killing millions of people. \rHard to believe it could ever happen. Could it be justified: the certain death of many versus the possible death of so many more? \n"}, {"text": "In \"Fat Man and Little Boy\", the question of using an atomic bomb in WW II is addressed. Who stars in the movie?", "correct": "Paul Newman", "options": ["Glenn Ford", "James Stewart", "Jack Lemmon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul Newman.\n\n\tNewman is Leslie Groves in this fact-based tale of J. Robert Oppenheimer and company and the Manhattan project. A weapon of this sort had never before been used (or even existed). Too radical to use  - or a fair and necessary weapon (a la \"all's fair in war\")? \n"}, {"text": "In \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", the Nazi crimes in WW II were addressed. Which of the following did NOT play a victim of Nazi brutality?", "correct": "Marlene Dietrich", "options": ["Judy Garland", "Montgomery Clift", "All three played victims"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarlene Dietrich.\n\n\tGarland and Clift were victims. Dietrich was a citizen and resident - not all Germans were Nazi sympathizers, etc. Spencer Tracy, maximilian Schell and Richard Widmark. Is it acceptable to say \"we were only following orders\"? \n"}, {"text": "In \"North by Northwest\", Cary Grant is a fictional individual - who is placed in considerable danger as a result. Who decides to more-or-less leave him there in order to further his own agenda?", "correct": "Leo G. Carroll", "options": ["John WIlliams", "James Mason", "Wendell Corey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeo G. Carroll\n\n\tCarroll's attitude initially is that the development is his good luck - and Grant's misfortune. One of the oldest questions in ethics: do the ends justify the means? \n"}, {"text": "In \"Inherit the Wind\", the issue involves the impact of teaching Darwin's theories of evolution as opposed to the Bible's story of creation. Who is NOT in the cast of the Spencer Tracy /Fredric March version?", "correct": "James Whitmore", "options": ["Harry Morgan", "Dick York", "Claude Akins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Whitmore.\n\n\tMorgan is the judge. York is the defendant, Scopes. Akins is the priest (and father of York's girl friend). Freedom of speech - even if it's \"blasphemy\"? \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Best Man\", political candidate Henry Fonda has a weapon that he may be able to use against opponent Cliff Robertson. What is it?", "correct": "Allegations of homosexuality", "options": ["Hospitalization for drug addiction", "Hospitalization for nervous breakdown", "Allegations of criminal imprisonment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAllegations of homosexuality.\n\n\tAgain, do the ends justify the means? Robertson is a scoundrel - but, do you pull out all the stops? Does \"anything go\"? \n"}, {"text": "In \"Seven Days in May\", the President (and his supporters) have a potential weapon to use against renegade Burt Lancaster - letters that he wrote to Ava Gardner. Who is sent to obtain this \"weapon\"?", "correct": "Kirk Douglas", "options": ["Edmond O'Brien", "Martin Balsam", "Andrew Duggan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKirk Douglas.\n\n\tOld friend Douglas is dispatched by president Fredric March to retrieve the letters for possible use. Again, do the ends justify the means? \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Music Box\", Jessica Lange must deal with the possibility of her father's guilt in Nazi atrocities. What is the evidence that is contained within the music box?", "correct": "Incriminating photographs", "options": ["A written confession", "Evidence of bribery and embezzlement", "Money"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIncriminating photographs.\n\n\tMoral issue here involves loyalty to one's family versus a moral obligation to the world at large. Does one turn in one's own parent?\rGood movie. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Absence of Malice\", the issue involved is the responsibility of the press. Who pays the price - by committing suicide - when certain information is disclosed?", "correct": "Melinda Dillon", "options": ["Donna Mills", "Sally Field", "Teri Garr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMelinda Dillon.\n\n\tDillon plays a sensitive young woman who cannot bear to have word of her abortion revealed. Fine movie. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Wall Street\", the morality of what one does for money is examined when Charlie Sheen turns over some information to bigshot Michael Douglas. Where did Sheen get the information?m,", "correct": "From a family member", "options": ["By secretly examining private documents", "From his girlfriend", "By eavesdropping illegally"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom a family member.\n\n\tSheen gets it from his father, Martin Sheen. Do you \"do whatever it takes\" to get ahead in business? (\"Greed is good\" ? That's another issue.) \n"}]}
