The door under the Third Laboratory is actually situated underneath the Presidential Palace, and when Ed later investigates it's been sealed off with alchemy.  This leads them to believe that the Fuhrer may be connected.  With Havoc paralyzed from the wait down, it's up to the others to head out and solve the mystery without him (though Ed suggests giving Dr. Marcoh a call, leading them to discover he's missing).\rScar returns to Central as well, and Ed and Al work together with Ling and Lan Fan to use their enemy to lure the Homunculi out of hiding (mainly to protect their best sacrifices from dying at the Ishvalan's hands).  Wrath and Gluttony emerge to prevent catastrophe only to get intercepted by Ling and Lan Fan but, of course, the Grand Fuhrer's speed is no match. \n"}, {"text": "\"Backs in the Distance\" - Scar created his own tattoos.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLan Fan is attacked by Wrath but not killed.  Instead she's left to be eaten by Gluttony, but Ling jumps in at the right moment to fend off the attacks.  Both end up cornered by Bradley in an abandoned building, unable to escape the two Homunculi.\rBecause of this distraction, Ed and Al are unable to stop battling Scar.  Instead, they need to hold back the Ishvalan foe by talking to him.  It's then that Ed asks him about the Rockbells; it also happens to be the moment Winry appears and discovers the truth for herself.  As she picks up a gun, Scar remembers his own sordid history as the State Alchemists killed his people; he was saved by his brother at the last moment when he fused his arm onto Scar's body.  In his rage, Scar killed the Rockbells and the others and fled the destroyed city.\rIn the last moment, Ed protects Winry and stops her from firing the gun while Al runs off in pursuit. \n"}, {"text": "\"Girl On the Battlefield\" - Lan Fan is able to get Wrath off her and Ling's trail by doing which of the following?", "correct": "Cutting off her arm", "options": ["Killing herself", "Covering them in garbage", "Jumping off a bridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCutting off her arm.\n\n\tLing and Lan Fan escape Wrath and Gluttony, but the former remains in pursuit.  Gluttony, meanwhile, finds Scar and the Elrics.  Scar is shocked to find that his powers do not kill the Homunculus, but when it seems like things are getting worse, Ling arrives, having escaped the Fuhrer.  Ling uses a grenade to destroy Gluttony, but his regenerative properties begin working.  Quickly, the group ties him up with strong cable, preventing him from escaping or attacking.  Elsewhere, Wrath finds the end of the blood trail; Lan Fan has removed her left arm and attached it to a dog to throw him off the track.\rHawkeye arrives with a car, grabs Lan Fan and Gluttony, shoots Scar in the leg, and heads out of the city.  When the Elrics move in to attack Scar, however, they're attacked by the girl from Xing, allowing the Ishvalan to escape.  Ling forces Hawkeye to pick up Lan Fan before leaving, but not before Fuhrer King Bradley spots her.\rWinry receives a call and is summoned home to help her Auto-Mail customers; leaving the city, she's put out of harm's way.  Colonel Mustang brings Ed and Al out of Central along with Ed, a mortician contact from the Ishvalan Civil War.  There, they bring Lan Fan back to health and Ling is introduced to Mustang.  This is also the opportunity at which Ling reveals Fuhrer King Bradley's identity as a Homunculus.  When Gluttony hears Mustang's name, however, the conversation is cut short; he breaks free of his binds to kill the one responsible for torching Lust. \n"}, {"text": "\"Inside the Belly\" - Who isn't eaten by Gluttony?", "correct": "Alphonse", "options": ["Envy", "Edward", "Ling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlphonse.\n\n\tDr. Marcoh, still being held hostage as a potential sacrifice, concerns himself with the safety of his village.  Meanwhile, Fuhrer King Bradley converses with Pride about the future.\rOut in the country, Gluttony, now empowered, fights to devour the others around him.  This form, more powerful as it seems, enable him to eat the obstacles in his path, including Colonel Mustang's fire.  Luckily, Ling and Lan Fan are able to take the chance to escape to the car while the others loop back around.  The Elrics and Ling stay back while the injured Mustang hops into the car with Hawkeye and the others.  Ling faces off against Envy while Al and Ed attack Gluttony.  Unfortunately, all of them save for Al end up getting devoured by the hungry Homunculus in a massive attack, and Gluttony can't bring them back.\rBack in Central, Mustang makes an attempt to reach out to Lt. General Raven only to find himself in the midst of corruption itself. \n"}, {"text": "\"Doorway of Darkness\" - Colonel Mustang's team is reassigned throughout Amestros.  Where is Hawkeye sent to work?", "correct": "Central Command", "options": ["North City", "East City", "West City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCentral Command.\n\n\tIn Central, the young girl from Xing, May, worries over her missing panda, Xiao-Mei, who's actually with Al.  Scar plans to go out to help find Xiao-Mei.\rEd and Ling find themselves in the belly of Gluttony and unable to escape.  After searching for ages looking for an exit, they come across Envy and learn the truth...they've been consumed by the Portal of Truth.  Gluttony was originally a failed experiment to create a real Portal of Truth, but the one they're in is an in-between.  The person responsible was 'Father', as he's known.  Ed also asks what the Homunculi did in Ishval, and Envy reveals that he fired the first shot to start the war.  Ed tries to attack, but Envy decides to take on a larger form.  There's no choice but to fight.\rGluttony tries to figure out what to do, so he talks to Al.  Afraid that 'Father' may be angry, he decides to bring Al along.\rFuhrer King Bradley speaks to Mustang directly to teach him a lesson and he reveals that he never felt bad about the death of General Hughes.  To cripple Mustang's efforts, his team is sent to different compass points; one to the west, one to the east, and one to the north.  Hawkeye is summoned to Fuhrer Bradley's side as personal assistant. \n"}, {"text": "\"Reunion\" - Which of these is found within Gluttony's false Portal of Truth?", "correct": "Pieces of the Ruins of Xerxes", "options": ["Ishvalan people", "The Father", "Failed Homunculi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPieces of the Ruins of Xerxes.\n\n\tLing and Ed put up a bold fight against Envy but the battle proves to be extensively trying, especially when Ed's eaten up by the beast the Homunculus has become.  Inside Envy's writhing body, he finds the core of the Homunculus, the Philosopher's Stone, and recalling a piece of rubble within Gluttony he realizes there may be a way out.\rMay finds that Al is the one with Xiao-Mei in his possession and she and Scar head off in pursuit of him and Gluttony.  Heading deep within the city's sewers, all of them narrow in on the core of darkness within (though May and Scar have to fight the gatekeepers, chimeras, to get in).\rThe Fuhrer King recalls his own history; he was created to be Fuhrer, and was one of many candidates to become Wrath.  Once he was injected with the Philosopher's Stone, he retained the powers within and rose to power.  He was once human, but can't go back.\rInside Gluttony, Ed realizes that the runes he saw in Xerxes were for a transmutation circle for human transmutation.  The circle, he hypothesizes, can transmute a living person, opening the portal and sending them out.  This was used for the first time in Xerxes to bring the city down, create a Philosopher's Stone, and bring life to Envy.  They walk through the portal.  Ed ends up back in front of the door only to find that there are two portals.  In front of one is Al, but he can only leave with his own soul. \n"}, {"text": "\"Interlude Party\" - This episode is actually framed around a dream had by which character?", "correct": "Van Hohenheim", "options": ["Alphonse Elric", "Edward Elric", "Winry Rockbell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVan Hohenheim.\n\n\tThis episode features Hohenheim and a young Pinako Rockbell discussing their lives around a fire.  The possibility that humans may or may not have the power to defeat the Homunculi is of the utmost importance.  Little does he know, an uprising has already begun as the puzzle pieces have started to fall into place, even for his own sons.  Fortunately, humankind is willing to make its own sacrifices and use its own hidden strength to win, especially in desperate times.  Hohenheim is awakened from his dream by the appearance of his dead wife, Trisha. \n"}, {"text": "\"Father\" - Who gives up their body as a host for Greed?", "correct": "Ling", "options": ["May", "Xiao-Mei", "Scar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLing.\n\n\tA reunion occurs quite quickly when Alphonse and Gluttony reach Father, mainly because Envy, Ed, and Ling are able to escape from Gluttony's stomach.  When they emerge, Father makes it clear that he's in charge by first healing the Elric brothers, then removing their ability to transmute.  Ling ends up offering up his body to Father, making himself a host to a new version of Greed shortly before May and Scar make their arrival and, to the surprise of Father and the Homunculi, they're still able to use alchemy to fight back. The duo escapes (with Xiao-Mei) with Al's help, but the brothers are left in Father's hands to be brought back up to Wrath on the surface. \n"}, {"text": "\"Struggle of the Fool\" - May reveals to Al that she is which of the following?", "correct": "A princess", "options": ["Ling's sister", "Dead", "A Homunculus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA princess.\n\n\tEd and Al are brought directly up to Central Command where Al reveals that May never escaped; she was actually kept inside his armor.  They're immediately brought to meet Wrath, revealing his identity as Fuhrer King Bradley, and they find that Col. Mustang is essentially a hostage.  Fullmetal resigns his title as a State Alchemist then and there, but Wrath threatens to kill Winry, leaving Ed with no choice.  They're allowed to leave provided they retain their ranks.  After the boys call Winry to ensure her safety, Greed finds them and asks them to deliver an item to Lan Fan.  Al ends up handing it over and, in her eagerness, Lan Fan asks for a new arm with which she can save Ling.  When May finds out that Lan Fan is present, the two get at each others' throats until Dr. Knox forces them to rest.\rIn the sewers, Scar finds Dr.Marcoh imprisoned underground.  Since he was responsible for the extermination of the Ishvalan people, Marcoh finds it a cruel twist of fate.  Dr. Marcoh begs Scar to kill him to fight back and prevent Father from using his knowledge.\rMustang ends up telling Armstrong and Hawkeye the truth and consider their options; the Colonel strengthens his resolve. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Ishvalan War of Extermination\" - Scar allegedly kills Dr. Marcoh and writes which of these on his prison cell wall?", "correct": "Vengeance", "options": ["Homunculi", "Ishval", "Freedom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVengeance.\n\n\tCol. Mustang, as it turns out, trained under Riza Hawkeye's father and, as a result, was entrusted with his research in flame alchemy after his death.  He solemnly vowed to keep his daughter safe.  Ed decides to return her gun to her at her apartment and she tells the story.  At the same time, Dr. Marcoh tells the same story to Scar underground.\rAfter the one bullet fired by Envy in Ishval, a seven-year-long civil war occurred and, eventually, a bill was passed by Fuhrer King Bradley to enact the Ishvalan War of Extermination.  Hawkeye was a sniper and, along with the State Alchemists, she was forced to kill a lot of people.  After the war, she joined Col. Mustang because they shared the same ethics; he allowed her to stay on provided she did not hesitate to end his life if he deviated from the mission.  Hawkeye tells Ed that the only way they can succeed is if those responsible for Ishval's destruction are brought to trial.  She and Mustang (and others) plan to be seen as mass murderers because they and the current government need to be brought down and democracy needs to reign.  Despite the suicidal move, Hawkeye believes that penance must be paid.\rDr. Marcoh reveals to Scar that there was a reason he performed experiments-- to create a Philosopher's Stone which, inevitably, was given to State Alchemist Kimblee and made for a turning point in the war.  When Envy returns to give Marcoh his dinner he finds that Scar has murdered him and written VENGEANCE on the wall in his blood. \n"}]}
