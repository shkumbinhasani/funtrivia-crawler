Grace", "Wally Hammond", "Len Hutton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHerbert Sutcliffe.\n\n\tHerbert William Sutcliffe is one of England's greatest ever batsmen.

This partnership, and Sutcliffe in particular, were instrumental in England's victory in the 1928-29 Ashes series in Australia.\rNine England batsman scored centuries in both innings of a test during the 20th century, but only Sutcliffe did it twice. \n"}, {"text": "Formula One: Who became the oldest winner of the Formula One Championship when he won at the age of 46?", "correct": "Juan Manuel Fangio", "options": ["Alberto Ascari", "Jack Brabham", "Alain Prost"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio.\n\n\tJuan Manuel Fangio has claims to be the greatest diver in Formula One history.
