{"id": "213179", "name": "\"Ocarina of Time\" - The Bosses Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Ocarina of Time"], "questions": [{"text": "What is Gohma's weakness?", "correct": "Her eye", "options": ["Her face", "Her legs", "Her tail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer eye.\n\n\tWhen Gohma's eye turns red, take out the Fairy Slingshot and shoot directly into Gohma's eye.  When this is done, Gohma will be rendered harmless, and you'll be able to attack her with your sword.  If you manage to do a few jump attacks with your sword, Gohma should be dead in no time, although the Great Deku Tree won't quite be saved. \n"}, {"text": "When do you throw bombs at King Dodongo?", "correct": "When he inhales", "options": ["When he exhales", "When he rolls", "When he's not facing you"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen he inhales.\n\n\tIf you throw bombs when King Dodongo inhales, he'll swallow it and it will explode inside of him, giving you a chance to sneak up and slash him with your sword.  Again, jump attacks will be useful when fighting King Dodongo because they're more powerful and the fight will end much quicker.  If you don't manage to throw a bomb into King Dodongo's mouth, he'll breathe fire at you and keep rolling. \n"}, {"text": "How many tentacles does Barinade use to attach to the ceiling of his boss chamber?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "Five", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThese three tentacles are the focus in the very beginning of the episode.  By using the boomerang, you can knock the tentacles off of the ceiling and Barinade can start his second phase.  Although the tentacles are only the focus during a short time, the boomerang will be used throughout the battle. \n"}, {"text": "How many pictures are in Phantom Ganon's chamber?", "correct": "Six & 6", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix & 6.\n\n\tIn the first half of the boss battle, Phantom Ganon will ride his horse through the paintings and attack you when he pops out.  If you can shoot Phantom Ganon with an arrow before he escapes the picture, you'll remain unscathed.  Sound easy?  Well, Phantom Ganon will appear to be leaving two different pictures at once, and you need to pick the correct one to shoot. \n"}, {"text": "Is it possible to attack Volvagia while he's flying?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tVolvagia can only be attacked when he's popping out of one of the holes in the floor, but you can bring him back down into one using an arrow or two.  To attack him, you need to use the Megaton Hammer to stun him and then you can attack him with either the hammer or a sword.  In between attacks, Volvagia will take to the sky, sometimes dropping boulders behind him.  To avoid these, you can climb down the sides of the island where you can't be harmed. \n"}, {"text": "What weapon is crucial in the battle against Morpha?", "correct": "Longshot", "options": ["Hookshot", "Deku Nuts", "Fairy Bow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLongshot.\n\n\tAfter receiving the Longshot from the Water Temple, your Hookshot will no longer be used.  The Fairy Bow and Deku Nuts won't have any effect on Morpha.  Once you start fighting Morpha, try and shoot the core with your Longshot, and when it's outside of the watery part, you can slash it with your sword.  If you use the Biggoron Sword, it shouldn't take more than five slashes to destroy this boss. \n"}, {"text": "What does Bongo Bongo use to play his bongo?", "correct": "His hands", "options": ["Drumsticks", "An omniscient force", "Wind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis hands.\n\n\tIn this boss battle, you'll need a sword, the Fairy Bow, and the Lens of Truth.  If you equip the Hover Boots, you'll have a major advantage in this battle as well because Bongo Bongo will frequently play the giant bongo arena and you'll be bouncing up and down during the battle.  With the Hover Boots, you'll be able to get an easier shot with your Bow and Arrows.  This boss' weakness is his eye; once it's hit, he'll be harmless for a short time and you can attack him with your sword. \n"}, {"text": "What elemental power does Koume possess?", "correct": "Fire", "options": ["Ice", "Ground", "Wind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFire.\n\n\tKoume is the fire witch and Kotake is the ice witch.  While fighting them, you'll only need your sword and the Mirror Shield.  When the witches or their final form shoot their powers at you, your Mirror Shield can capture their powers.  When you capture three shots of the same type (fire or ice), the Mirror Shield will shoot the power back out, so you'll need to aim the power back at the boss. \n"}, {"text": "How many elemental barriers must be broken before you can reach the top of Ganondorf's Tower?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Seven", "Eight", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tYou must pass through and destroy the Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, Spirit, and Light Barriers.  Fighting Ganondorf is basically the same as the final half of the battle with Phantom Ganon in the Forest Temple.  The one difference is that Ganondorf will occasionally make a black hole.  If he does this, shoot a Light Arrow at him, and he'll go down instantly. \n"}, {"text": "Which weapon won't have an effect on Ganon?", "correct": "Bombchus", "options": ["The Biggoron Sword", "Light Arrows", "The Megaton Hammer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBombchus.\n\n\tAlthough Bombs and Bombchus won't affect Ganon, you can use them to break down pillars in order to restock on arrows, magic, and health.  To defeat Ganon, you need to attack his tail.  Since your Master Sword isn't used until the very end of the battle, you should use the Biggoron Sword if you have it.  You can also use Light Arrows to stun Ganon by shooting them into his eyes. \n"}]}
