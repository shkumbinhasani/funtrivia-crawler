Building on the popularity of the battle card game released shortly after \"Pok\u00e9mon\" hit it big in North America, the handheld game put you in the role of a card player who, heading to different gyms, needed to build a deck and battle against foes with different card types, much like a player would visit gyms in the original \"Pok\u00e9mon\" games.  Unsurprisingly, the game also released with a limited edition card for players of the actual card game.  It was a surprisingly popular and well-received title. \n"}, {"text": "In what game do you play a photographer, out to take photos of Pok\u00e9mon in their natural habitats?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Snap", "options": ["Pok\u00e9mon Camera", "Pok\u00e9mon Picture Challenge", "Pok\u00e9mon Photo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Snap.\n\n\t\"Pok\u00e9mon Snap\" was another surprising windfall for Pok\u00e9mon at a time when platform releases in the series were scarce.  Again, instead of catching and battling Pok\u00e9mon, the point was to interact in a new way, in this case by taking pictures of the Pok\u00e9mon in the game on beaches, in forests, in volcanoes, and even on the moon.  In seven locations, you could snap photos of about 40% of the original 151 Pok\u00e9mon, in some cases triggering their appearances through different, unique means. \n"}, {"text": "Using a microphone on the Nintendo 64, you could talk to which of these Pok\u00e9mon in a stand-alone game released in 1998?", "correct": "Pikachu", "options": ["Meowth", "Mewtwo", "Jigglypuff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPikachu.\n\n\tIn \"Hey You, Pikachu!\", you could have a Pok\u00e9mon of your very own on the Nintendo 64.  With this game, again, there was no real combat or adventure at hand, but you could take care of Pikachu (for a year, or longer if you decided to continue).  The game didn't really have much else going for it save for a rare instance using voice-recognition software on an early console.  This would later come back in a bigger way for console titles on the Gamecube and the Nintendo DS/3DS. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series games on the Game Boy Color was based on the puzzle game known as 'Panel de Pon'?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle Challenge", "options": ["Pok\u00e9mon Tetris", "Pok\u00e9mon Block Battle", "Pok\u00e9mon Blocks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Puzzle Challenge.\n\n\tReleasing during the second generation of \"Pok\u00e9mon\" games (ie. \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\"), \"Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle Challenge\" was almost like \"Tetris\" in the sense that it had a board of falling blocks, but it differed in that different shapes didn't need to fit together necessarily; you had to swap blocks of different colours around, like in \"Candy Crush Saga\" and use specific Pok\u00e9mon to do certain extra things.  A similar game, \"Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League\", came out on the Nintendo 64 in the same year, but based itself on the anime. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these games could you catch the original 151 Pok\u00e9mon, but only on two boards and by racking up points?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Pinball", "options": ["Pok\u00e9mon Backgammon", "Pok\u00e9mon Chess", "Pok\u00e9mon-Life"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball.\n\n\t\"Pok\u00e9mon Pinball\", a very early series spin-off showing up on the Game Boy Color in 1999, took all of the original 151 Pok\u00e9mon of the classic \"Red\" and \"Blue\" games and made them catchable, but only if you were able to succeed at games of virtual pinball, scoring points and avoiding falling into the gutter.  Caught Pok\u00e9mon could also be evolved by various means, but only if you could catch them by using the pinball as a Pok\u00e9ball.  The game had a sequel on the Game Boy Advance, but not until \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" were released. \n"}, {"text": "You, the player, could become the Pok\u00e9mon in what series of games played in randomly-generated levels?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon", "options": ["Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum", "Pok\u00e9mon Black and White", "Pok\u00e9mon Stadium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon.\n\n\tThe \"Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon\", beginning on the Game Boy Advance in 2005 and continuing through the Nintendo handheld line, was another surprise hit for the series bolstered by the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" name alone.  Once more, the goal wasn't to collect Pok\u00e9mon but to play through a storyline interspersed with randomized dungeons and battles.  The games are similar to the original titles in that they're turn-based, but as a Pok\u00e9mon you can't catch other Pok\u00e9mon to fight with; you need to recruit them. \n"}, {"text": "You could use the Nintendo DS stylus to wrangle Pok\u00e9mon in what 2006 handheld title?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Ranger", "options": ["New Pok\u00e9mon Adventures", "Pok\u00e9mon Magic", "Pok\u00e9mon DS"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Ranger.\n\n\t\"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" was another unique alternative game running parallel to the main series.  In it, you would still go around catching \"Pok\u00e9mon\", though not in an open world, fight-through the gyms, become a Pok\u00e9mon Master sort of way.  Instead, you could capture Pok\u00e9mon by circling them with your stylus on the Nintendo DS touch-screen, effectively roping them in like a ranger.  The game had two further sequels on the DS-- \"Shadows of Almia\" and \"Guardian Signs\". \n"}, {"text": "Only on the Gamecube, which of these titles sent you out to capture Shadow Pok\u00e9mon?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness", "options": ["Pok\u00e9mon Trozei", "Pok\u00e9mon Shadow Run", "Pok\u00e9mon Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness.\n\n\tA follow-up to another offshoot title, \"Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum\", on the Gamecube, \"Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness\" was unlike the original series because it was a role-playing game in which you needed to battle Pok\u00e9mon while only catching those of the shadow-type, even if they weren't typically shadow Pok\u00e9mon.  This was because in the mythology of this specific game, Shadow Pok\u00e9mon were those who needed their hearts purified.  While the game sold well, it was not necessarily a popular title amongst purists. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these games in the series was an action game in which you would beat up other Pok\u00e9mon in an arena setting?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Rumble", "options": ["My Pok\u00e9mon Ranch", "Pok\u00e9mon Tournament", "Pok\u00e9mon Battle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Rumble.\n\n\t\"Pok\u00e9mon Rumble\", released as a semi-independent game on the WiiWare system in 2009, had you take on the role of your own Pok\u00e9mon as you battled against your enemies in real-time with your fists.  Because of the motion sensitivity of the Wii Remote, you could actually play fisticuffs in the game, heading through dungeons and fighting in arena battles to win.  The game didn't fare all too well critically for its mindless mechanics, but sequels showed up on the 3DS and Wii U in later years. \n"}, {"text": "What mobile app allowed players to catch Pok\u00e9mon in the real world using GPS technology and a camera?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Go", "options": ["Pok\u00e9mon Catch", "Pok\u00e9mon Trainer", "Catch 'Em All"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go.\n\n\t\"Pok\u00e9mon Go\", backed by Nintendo but created by Niantic, became a quick mobile phenomenon in 2016 when it released on iOS and Android devices, sending people of all ages out into the world (or wherever they could get a data signal) to catch, raise, and battle Pokemon they could find out in the real world (or in their own homes).  Using the touch screen on their phone and the camera feature, they could see the Pokemon on the device, throw Pokeballs, and add them to their collections.  It's claimed that in its first year, the app was downloaded more than five hundred million unique times. \n"}]}
