{"id": "388109", "name": "The Carotid Kid Quiz | Word Play | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", " Word Play", "Mixed Word Puzzles"], "questions": [{"text": "For each question you will be given the type of puzzle, a clue to the answer, and the puzzle itself. Best of luck!\n\nWords in Common:\n\nTo sort this situation out, the Carotid Kid needs to get to the centre of things. Can you help her out by identifying what word can go before all of the following to form three new words?\n\nBreak, Beat, Felt", "correct": "Heart", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeart.\n\n\tHEARTbreak, HEARTbeat, HEARTfelt.\r The heart is the centre of the body's circulatory system, a large muscle responsible for pumping blood around the body. The largest artery out of the heart is called the aorta and the largest veins coming into the heart are the vena cava. \n"}, {"text": "Missing vowels:\n\nThe Carotid Kid begins her investigation in what looks to be a large room, though she has no idea where she is. Can you fill in the missing vowels and help her out?\n\nTRM", "correct": "Atrium", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtrium.\n\n\taTRiuM.\r The heart is made of four chambers, two of which are known as the atria, the left atrium and the right atrium. The left atrium is where oxygenated blood enters from the lungs, while the right atrium is where the vena cava bring in deoxygenated blood from the rest of the body. \n"}, {"text": "Anagrams:\n\nIn the corner of the room is a massive door, and it looks to be the only way out. The Carotid Kid reads a sign that tells her \"The only way to pass the door is to combine the clues for three and four\". A scrap of paper on the floor carries the clue:\n\nThe easiest way through is to apply a dab of CITRUS DIP to the hinges.\n\nCan you rearrange the block capitals to help her out?", "correct": "Tricuspid", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTricuspid.\n\n\tThe tricuspid valve is a one-way gateway between the right atrium and the right ventricle below it. It is only able to open in one direction, preventing the flow of blood backwards between the two chambers. \n"}, {"text": "Hidden Words:\n\nDirectly beneath the scrap of paper containing clue three, the Carotid Kid notices a panel etched into the floor. Can you find the hidden word that'll let her pass through the door?\n\nOnce you've passed through this door, seek the oval vent to the North.", "correct": "Valve", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nValve.\n\n\t...oVAL VEnt...\r There are two key valves in the heart, one of which is the tricuspid, and the other is the mitral. The mitral valve ensures that oxygenated blood flows in the correct direction from the left atrium to the left ventricle. \n"}, {"text": "Fractured Words:\n\nShe passes through the door and finds herself in another cavernous chamber. There's a neon sign that she hopes will tell her where she is, but it just seems to be a misplaced advert for a narcissistic dessert. Can you unravel the true meaning of the clue?\n\nVain Treacle ", "correct": "Ventricle", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVentricle.\n\n\tThe lower two chambers of the heart are known as ventricles. Blood flows into the right ventricle from the right atrium and leaves via the pulmonary artery. In the left ventricle, blood enters via the right atrium and leaves via the aorta. \n"}, {"text": "Wordwise:\n\nSpotting a large circular duct in the wall of this second chamber, the Carotid Kid enters with caution. Once inside she sees a sign to 'The Breathing Centre' but nothing to tell her the name of this tunnel. Can you find out where she is by saying what you see?\n\nPULM\nARY", "correct": "Pulmonary", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPulmonary.\n\n\tA general rule in the circulatory system is that arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, while veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. However, as the heart itself is not the source of oxygen, there is one exception to this. While the pulmonary arteries take blood away from the heart, they transport it to the lungs to become oxygenated, thus the pulmonary arteries are the only arteries to carry deoxygenated blood. The opposite is true for the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. \n"}, {"text": "In Other Words:\n\nAs she travels along the tunnel, the Carotid Kid decides to strike up a conversation with some of the others she sees travelling alongside her. The first person she meets is a rather intimidating warrior-like man carrying a shield. He says his friends call him Luke but that his real name was:\n\nBlanched Plasma Cubicle\n\nCan you exchange each of the words for a synonym to find out what on earth he's on about?", "correct": "White Blood Cell & White Blood Cells", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite Blood Cell & White Blood Cells.\n\n\tBlanched = White, Plasma = Blood, Cubicle = Cell.\r White blood cells, or leukocytes, are one of the central aspects of the body's immune system. While they come in many different types, their primary role is to fight infection and identify foreign objects in the body. Unlike red blood cells, white blood cells contain a nucleus. \n"}, {"text": "Hidden Words:\n\nBemused by Luke, the Carotid Kid decides to speak to another traveller. This one is on the smaller side and before the Carotid Kid can open her mouth he blurts out:\n\n\"My mum says that I did such a good job clotting today that I can stay up late. Let's play some video games!\"\n\nCan you find his name hidden in this bizarre message?", "correct": "Platelet", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlatelet.\n\n\t...uP LATE. LET's...\r Platelets are small cells found in the blood that aid with blood clotting. Clotting is incredibly important for the human body as it ensures that we don't lose too much blood if we sustain an injury. Some diseases, such as haemophilia, inhibit the clotting process and can make even small cuts very dangerous. \n"}, {"text": "Rebus:\n\nAfter walking along the main tunnel for what seems like hours, the Carotid Kid decides to take a side exit and head off the beaten track. She walks for a few more minutes before she reaches a complete dead end. A sign on the wall tells her where she is but she doesn't quite understand it. Can you find synonyms for each word and then put them all together to work out her location?\n\nBottletop + Tablet + Breezy", "correct": "Capillary", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCapillary.\n\n\tBottletop = Cap, Tablet = Pill, Breezy = Airy.\r Cap + Pill + Airy = Capillary\r Capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessel in the body, with some narrow enough to only allow one or two cells to pass through at a time. A bruise is usually caused by the rupturing of capillaries, easily done due to their one-cell-thick walls that can easily be damaged. \n"}, {"text": "Anagrams:\n\nGiving up on the inside job, the Carotid Kid decides that she'll need to work on the problem from the outside. She's pretty sure that there's one tool she needs for the job, but all she can remember is the following advice from her professor:\n\nIt is important to adopt the correct POSE TO properly study the CHEST.\n\nCan you unscramble the block capitals to work out what it is she needs?", "correct": "Stethoscope", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStethoscope.\n\n\tThe stethoscope is a device that allows doctors to listen to all sorts of sounds taking place inside the body, particularly in the heart and lungs. It typically consists of a circular resonator that is placed on the area of interest, connected to two ear pieces that allow the doctor to hear clearly what is going on. \n"}]}
