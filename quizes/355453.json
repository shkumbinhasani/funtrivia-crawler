{"id": "355453", "name": "Basic Cell Quiz 2: Mitosis Vs Meiosis | Sci / Tech | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Biology", "Cell and Molecular Biology"], "questions": [{"text": "Mitosis and meiosis are both processes in which a cell divides and creates new cells. Mitosis produces normal body cells. What type of cell does meiosis produce? ", "correct": "Gametes", "options": ["None of these are true.", "Diploid", "Gametes ", "Somatic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGametes.\n\n\tThe body cells produced during meiosis are identical and contain the same set of DNA. Gametes, or sex cells, produced during meiosis, are genetically different. This is one of the reasons there are a wide range of possibilities for the traits of an offspring. For example no two humans look exactly alike except for twins. \n"}, {"text": "Mitosis produces a different number of cells than meiosis. Which of the following statements is true?", "correct": "Mitosis produces two cells while meiosis produces four.", "options": ["Meiosis produces one-fifth the amount of cells as mitosis.", "Meiosis produces two cells while mitosis produces four.", "Mitosis produces one-tenth the amount of cells as meiosis. "], "explanation": "\n\n\nMitosis produces two cells while meiosis produces four.\n\n\tMeiosis is slightly different in males and females. The gametes produced by males are known as sperm. The gametes produced by females are called eggs. After meiosis in males all four of the cells produced can be used. In females, however, only one of the cells is used. The other three give all of their cytoplasm away to the one cell making it larger. The three smaller cells shrivel, resulting in the so-called polar bodies. \n"}, {"text": "The term haploid refers to a cell containing one set of chromosomes. The term diploid refers to a cell containing two sets. Both mitosis and meiosis produce diploid cells.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMitosis produces diploid cells while meiosis produces haploid cells. During Mitosis the two sets of chromosomes replicate into four sets. The cell then divides into two cells each containing two sets of chromosomes.\r A haploid gamete produced during meiosis can join with another gamete produced by the opposite sex. Since each of the parent cells contain one set of chromosomes, a diploid cell is formed. This is the first cell of a new offspring. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following only occurs during meiosis?", "correct": "Crossing Over", "options": ["Cytokenisis", "Telophase ", "Interphase"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrossing Over.\n\n\tCrossing over occurs during prophase 1 of meiosis. Crossing over is when sections of a chromosome are switched with sections of another chromosome that contains genes for the same traits. There are an infinite number of ways and times chromosomes can cross over. This helps contribute to genetic diversity and is another factor why no two humans, except twins, look alike. \n"}, {"text": "The stages of mitosis and meiosis are the same: prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. However, something is different. Which of the following statements is true? ", "correct": "The process of meiosis involves each stage occurring twice.", "options": ["The process of mitosis involves each stage occurring twice.", "The process of meiosis involves each stage occurring twice.   ", "None of these are true.", "The process of mitosis involves telophase ocurring twice."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe process of meiosis involves each stage occurring twice.\n\n\tSince mitosis involves one cell producing two cells each stage only occurs once. \r Meiosis produces four cells. The original cell produces two cells after going through all the stages. These two cells then go through all of the stages again. Each cell produces two more cells. A total of four cells are produced. Therefore, each stage occurs twice during meiosis. \n"}, {"text": "Organisms that reproduce asexually only go through mitosis.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAsexual reproduction involves only one parent. The offspring is an exact copy of the parent. There is no need for the production of gametes and therefore no need for meiosis. Gametes are only produced in organisms that reproduce sexually. \n"}, {"text": "Only cells produced from mitosis contain a nucleus. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAll cells need a nucleus in order to function. The job of the nucleus is to control all cell activities and acts as the cell's brain. The nucleus is where the chromosomes are located, which is an important element of both mitosis and meiosis. \n"}, {"text": "Centrioles are involved during both mitosis and meiosis. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe centrioles are located in the cytoplasm and help to organize cell division. There are two of them inside a cell located next each other at ninety degree angles. Before division, the centrioles replicate so there are now four. When preparing for division, two go to one side of the cell and two to the other. \n"}, {"text": "The spindle is only used during meiosis.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe spindle is actually used during both mitosis and meiosis. During division the spindle fibers attach to chromosomes. \n"}, {"text": "Mitosis occurs in all organisms. Which of the following organisms would not undergo meiosis? ", "correct": "Bacteria", "options": ["Humans", "Plants", "Fungi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBacteria.\n\n\tBacteria is a unicellular organism that reproduces asexually. Therefore, meiosis is not required. \n"}]}
