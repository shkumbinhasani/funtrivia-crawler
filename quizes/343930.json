{"id": "343930", "name": "Bosses of \"Skyward Sword\" Quiz | Zelda Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Skyward Sword"], "questions": [{"text": "Your first major boss of the game is in Skyview Temple.  With which of these are you likely to fight the Demon Lord, Ghirahim?", "correct": "Sword", "options": ["His own attacks", "Bombs", "Clawshot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSword.\n\n\tThe Demon Lord Ghirahim is a bit of a weirdo-- obsessed with raising his own master from the darkness to take over the land, he will stop at nothing to prevent Link from reaching Zelda.  The first battle against this figure is at the end of Skyview Temple and he'll put up a real fight, opting to take Link's sword out of his grip and toss it back at him if he's hit on the wrong side; this is where precise swordfighting becomes crucial.\rGhirahim is fought on two other occasions later in the game-- once at the end of the Fire Sanctuary and again at the Sealed Grounds in the past. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the boss of the Earth Temple?", "correct": "Scaldera", "options": ["Gohma", "Dodongo", "Volvagia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScaldera.\n\n\tScaldera emerges from the roof of the boss chamber in the Earth Temple after the departure of (who else?) Ghirahim and begins to assault Link with fire, rocks, and lava.  A creature made of these three substances, the key to winning this battle is blowing up Scaldera's outer shell with bombs (if you run out there are some at the top of the area's ramp along with heart flowers).  When the weak point of the boss is exposed you can slash at it until Scaldera is defeated. To incapacitate the boss for a short time, you'll need to wait until it breathes in in preparation of a fire-shooting attack and toss a bomb into its mouth. \n"}, {"text": "Moldarach, the boss of Lanayru Mining Facility, will use which tactic in battle?", "correct": "Burrowing underground", "options": ["Leaping up and down in the air", "Climbing to the ceiling", "Running around Link in circles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurrowing underground.\n\n\tUnlike earlier boss rooms, the final chamber in the Mining Facility is covered in deep sand, allowing the thousand-year arachnid, Moldarach, to burrow underground when the battle gets too heated.  Using the Gust Bellows obtained in the dungeon, Link can unearth the boss and fight back-- this will likely also unearth smaller creatures known as Arachas, and they're annoying. Moldarach will fight with his tail (he's a scorpion) and two pincers though the pincers are usually the first to go.  Before he goes underground, the pincers will be dealt with.  After finishing the battle, the room will drain of sand and Link can head to the Temple of Time. \n"}, {"text": "The Imprisoned is a boss fought at which of these spots?", "correct": "The Sealed Grounds", "options": ["Skyloft", "The Lumpy Pumpkin", "Temple of Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sealed Grounds.\n\n\tThe Imprisoned is the large-mouthed creature from below kept underground by a spike protecting the world from darkness.  This, of course, fails to keep him sealed in and he emerges for a battle in which Link must prevent him from reaching the temple at the top of the path and destroying it.  Link can do this by slashing the creature's toes then, when it's on the ground, push the spike in its head back in.  This must be done three times.\rThe Imprisoned is fought three times in the game-- the first is after completing the third dungeon and receiving the Goddess' Harp and the second is towards the end of the game when you've completed the next three temples.  This time he'll have arms.  The final time occurs when you must return to Faron Woods to learn the Song of the Hero. \n"}, {"text": "In the Ancient Cistern, the final boss is Koloktos.  This enemy has how many arms?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Eight", "Two", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tThe guardian at the top of the Ancient Cistern, this boss means business.  Fueled by darkness, Koloktos, the golden protector of Farore's Flame, will employ its six arms to swat at you and slash you with lengthy sabres.  It's not very nice.  Using the Whip, Link can pull apart the different arms and fight fire with fire, picking up the creature's large swords and destroying the other appendages with them.  When Koloktos is on the ground, Link can destroy the cage surrounding its weak point (on its chest) and deal the final blows.\rBeating Koloktos will result in an upgraded sword and the ability to move on to the next dungeon. \n"}, {"text": "Although only a minor boss, what enemy must be fought in order for Link to obtain the Bow?", "correct": "Scervo", "options": ["Dreadfuse", "Armos", "Stalmaster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScervo.\n\n\tReaching the Sandship in the middle of the Lanayru Sand Sea, Link will need to reach the passageway behind the locked door on the first floor in order to locate a Stalfos enemy, Scervo, who will face off against him on the gangplank at the bow of the ship.  Battling on progressively smaller planks, Link will need to keep attempting to knock him off the front of the boat.  Doing so will result in Link receiving the Bow, an item which will activate the Timeshift Stone on the ship's mast.\rAn enemy known as Dreadfuse can be found in the Sky Keep near the end of the game.  This battle is held on a shorter gangplank. \n"}, {"text": "When you use the Squid Key to open the locked boss room of the Sandship, where will you inevitably fight the boss?", "correct": "On the deck of the ship", "options": ["In that room", "In the brig", "In the captain's quarters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn the deck of the ship.\n\n\tUpon opening the door to the boss room using the oddly-shaped key from the captain's quarters, Link will go inside only to find...an empty room.  But it soon comes under siege by large tentacles and Link will need to return to the deck to find the ship broken in half by an abyssal leviathan, Tentalus, a boss which requires that you make use of your new bow to shoot him in his one eye. Before this can happen, you'll need to use sword techniques to slice away at the tentacles rising from the ship and to tear away at his tentacle hair.  Once you've done enough damage to his eye you'll reach Nayru's Flame and be able to upgrade to the Goddess White Sword, doubling your dowsing ability. \n"}, {"text": "Bilocyte is defined as which of these?", "correct": "Ocular Parasite", "options": ["Parasitic Arachnid", "Colossal Pest", "Tentacle Creature"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOcular Parasite.\n\n\tIn order to learn the Song of the Hero, Link needs to head into the Thunderhead to meet Levias, a giant whale who flies through the clouds.  This first meeting (spurned by a large bowl of Pumpkin Soup) proves to be a bad first impression; Levias is infected with a parasite known as Bilocyte and the boss battle that ensues takes place on his back. Link must begin by flying into the tentacles hanging off Levias.  After landing on the flat of Levias' back, Link will encounter Bilocyte, a boss whose projectiles must be tossed back to him before you can get a hit on his single weak spot-- his eye.  Freeing Levias from the grasp of this creature will result in a journey to all three regions of the surface to meet with powerful dragons. \n"}, {"text": "Before fighting the final boss of the game, Link must battle Ghirahim who reveals himself to be the incarnation of which of these items?", "correct": "Sword", "options": ["Triforce", "Sealing spike", "Evil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSword.\n\n\tAt the Sealed Grounds in the past, Ghirahim prepares Zelda for a ritual in which her soul is used to awaken and power the final boss of the game who appeared in the form of The Imprisoned on many occasions.  No matter what, this evil being is raised from his prison and Ghirahim, once defeated, transforms into a sword used in the final battle.\rDuring his last fight, Ghirahim pulls out all the stops beginning with fighting on raised platforms (which you have to knock him off of).  The battle continues on the ground with Ghirahim using a saber, and then with a much larger weapon which Link must destroy to reach his foe's inner core, his weak spot. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the game's final boss?", "correct": "Demise", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDemise.\n\n\tDemise will rise from his prison underground and beckon Link to another realm to partake in a final duel for the fate of the world and the Triforce.  When Link is ready he can proceed and fight with nothing more than the Master Sword and a Shield.  Perhaps the best thing to keep in mind is that remaining calm can save you. Hitting several times in succession may cause Demise to get the upper hand.  The battle begins with a simple duel with swords but when Demise falls he'll use the power of lightning to reinforce his attacks, making him all the more difficult to deal with.  When he finally falls, he'll vow that he'll be reincarnated, just as Link and Zelda will, and he will return. Until then, however, that marks the end of the game.  Link and Zelda can return to their own time in peace. \n"}]}
