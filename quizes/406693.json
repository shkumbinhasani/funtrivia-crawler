{"id": "406693", "name": "Seemingly Useless \"Resident Evil 4\" Items Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 4"], "questions": [{"text": "If Leon destroys all of the Medallions in the first two Chapters of the game, he'll get a gun from the Merchant.  What colour are these Medallions?", "correct": "Blue", "options": ["Gold", "Red", "Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue.\n\n\tThere are fifteen Blue Medallions in the first couple Chapters of the game, seven of which are located in the farm near the starting village and right of which are near the cemetery at the church.  These Medallions are, of course, completely optional as a to-do, but if Leon shoots all fifteen then he'll be able to stop by any Merchant and claim the Punisher pistol with extra firepower.  Shooting ten will also result in the gun, but without the useful power upgrade. \n"}, {"text": "In Chapter 1-2, Leon will encounter one of his first key items, a pair of Emblems which, when combined, create a key of what shape?", "correct": "Hexagon", "options": ["Sphere", "Star", "Square"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHexagon.\n\n\tChapter 1-2 will lead Leon to a cliffside village loaded with enemies and small huts, but the aim will be a little more complicated.  A door at the far end, locked with an ornate key, will be the only thing separating him from the path ahead, and to get through he needs to grab the Emblem Right Half and Emblem Left Half from two separate chests.  Both are innocuous on their own, but combined, they create a Hexagonal Emblem which can be used once and then tossed. \n"}, {"text": "The Round Insignia opens which of these?", "correct": "The church", "options": ["The cave", "The castle", "The helicopter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe church.\n\n\tFound in Chapter 2-1 in the waterfall cave, the Round Insignia is another in a long line of oversized keys that open ornate, complex doors.  All of Leon's efforts in Chapter 1-3, especially dealing with Del Lago, will lead to this Round Insignia bearing the logo of Los Illuminados.  This emblem is specifically used to open the front door to the church and, subsequently, the hiding place of Ashley Graham. \n"}, {"text": "The boss battle against Bitores Mendez will result in the collection of which of these?", "correct": "False Eye", "options": ["Garden Key", "Computer Chip", "Gold Finger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse Eye.\n\n\tAs Leon and Ashley make their way to a new extraction point in Chapter 2-3 (don't worry, that one won't work either), they'll find a door across a deep ravine and figure out that it's the way to go to leave the village and head to Castle Salazar.  The catch is that the door, in perhaps the wildest instance of technological advancement in this part of rural Spain, has a retinal scanner.  To get inside, they need to beat Bitores Mendez, the village priest, and get his False Eye. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout Chapter 3 at Salazar's Castle, Leon will need to find numerous one-time-use keys to progress.  Which is not one of them?", "correct": "Insignia Key", "options": ["Gallery Key", "Prison Key", "Castle Gate Key"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsignia Key.\n\n\tThe Insignia Key is found much earlier in the game in Chapter 1-2 when Leon reaches Bitores Mendez's house and it's used up long before he and Ashley reach Salazar's Castle.  There, there will be no shortage of different keys.  The Prison Key, in Chapter 3-1, is needed to reach the game's first Garrador (and a necessary switch in his prison cell); the Castle Gate Key, found outside earlier in the chapter, is needed to get into the building; the Gallery Key is found in Chapter 3-2, giving Leon access to a puzzle involving paintings.  Once used, all of these items are discarded. \n"}, {"text": "How many Grails can Leon collect in Salazar's Castle?", "correct": "Two & 2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo & 2.\n\n\tIn Chapter 4-1, Leon needs to collect both the King's Grail and the Queen's Grail to advance though both are at the end of short, yet dangerous trials.  The former can be found at the end of a long hallway guarded by more than half a dozen fearsome Armaduras whole the latter can be found, guarded by Salazar and a collapsing room.  Both items need to be placed into the hands of their respective statues in the castle, allowing Leon and Ashley to continue moving through. \n"}, {"text": "The only way off the island at the end of the game is by using a key to which of these?", "correct": "Jetski", "options": ["Yacht", "Motorboat", "Helicopter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJetski.\n\n\tIn exchange for the Plagas Sample that Leon will grab off Saddler at the end of the final boss battle, Ada Wong will hand over a set of keys with a teddy bear keychain, and with a short three minute time limit, Leon will need to use it to get himself and Ashley off the island and away from the nightmare.  The jetski can be found sitting in a small cave beneath the final boss area, and if they can accelerate to the cave exit fast enough, they'll be free. \n"}, {"text": "Aside from herbs and sprays, Leon can heal himself (and Ashley) with which local food items?", "correct": "Fish", "options": ["Apple", "Chicken", "Pork"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFish.\n\n\tThere are two unique foodstuffs in \"Resident Evil 4\" which, though they seem silly, are actually quite useful.  There are three coloured eggs (a white Chicken Egg, a Brown Chicken Egg, and a Gold Chicken Egg) that replenish certain amounts of health.  Additionally, Leon can hop into shallow waters to catch fish, specifically Black Bass in small and large sizes, and they'll refill health as well. \n"}, {"text": "How much is the Salazar Family Insignia worth?", "correct": "Nothing; it's a Key Item", "options": ["12,000 ptas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNothing; it's a Key Item.\n\n\tIt might be worth a ton in use, but you can't sell the Salazar Family Insignia.  You grab this item in Chapter 3-4 when you control Ashley in Salazar's Castle.  She'll need to collect this at the end of the hall of Armaduras to be able to reunite with Leon elsewhere in the building.\r The Salazar Family Crown, however, is a different story.  Combining the Crown and Crown Jewel found in Chapter 4-1 with the Royal Insignia found in Chapter 4-2 creates an item that you can sell for 48,000 ptas. \n"}, {"text": "Leon can save his progress at the end of a Chapter or at which of these on the map?", "correct": "Typewriters", "options": ["Chalkboards", "Beds", "Tape recorders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTypewriters.\n\n\tJust like in earlier iterations in the \"Resident Evil\" series, saving the game is as easy as locating a Typewriter at key moments in the game (usually in safe rooms/houses though sometimes they're in odder spots).  Though the first few games in the series required that the player character carry an Ink Ribbon to use the Typewriter (ensuring a limited amount of saves in any given game), you have infinite opportunities in \"Resident Evil 4\" with no need to worry about running out at any save point. \n"}]}
