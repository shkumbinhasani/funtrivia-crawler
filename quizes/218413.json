{"id": "218413", "name": "Top Movies of 1994 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1990s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "1994, what a great year for movies.  Perhaps no film from 1994 has received more attention than 'The Shawshank Redemption', a story about hope and friendship.  Which actress' name is featured in the title of the original Stephen King story upon which this wonderful film is based?", "correct": "Rita Hayworth", "options": ["Betty Grable", "Marilyn Monroe", "Jean Harlow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRita Hayworth.\n\n\tThe title of the Stephen King story is 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', though for the film version only 'The Shawshank Redemption' is used in the title. This wildly popular film is directed by Frank Darabont, and features Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the principle acting roles. \n"}, {"text": "Which famous poet is a featured character in the lovely, low-key romantic drama 'The Postman'?", "correct": "Pablo Neruda", "options": ["Ezra Pound", "Langston Hughes", "Arthur Rimbaud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPablo Neruda.\n\n\t'The Postman' (or 'Il Postino') is a charming, tender love story that features beautiful cinematography and poetic dialogue.  Pablo Neruda befriends a simple postman who, like the Chilean master of prosody, has a gift for language.  Michael Radford directs this delightful little film. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most heartfelt films of 1994, or any year, is the unique cross-dressing comedy entitled 'The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'.  In which country does this story take place?", "correct": "Australia", "options": ["Mexico", "South Africa", "Chile"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAustralia.\n\n\tWith Stephan Elliot directing a wonderful cast, including Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce, Terrence Stamp and Bill Hunter, the final product is a brilliant, tacky spectacle of a film, that ultimately convinces the viewer with its straightforward sincerity.  If you still have not seen this film, you simply must! \n"}, {"text": "'Eat, Drink, Man, Woman' (or 'Yin Shi Nan Nu') came to us via Taiwan in 1994.  Which director delivered this tasty morsel of a film?", "correct": "Ang Lee", "options": ["Wayne Wang", "John Woo", "Tsui Hark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAng Lee.\n\n\tIn the tradition of films such as 'Babette's Feast' and 'Like Water for Chocolate', 'Eat, Drink, Man, Woman' is an exploration of both the most sensual culinary delights, and the depths of love between man and woman.  Though Ang Lee has directed other fine films, for example 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', this film is, in my view, his cinematic masterpiece. \n"}, {"text": "Take John Turturro as Herbie Stempel, a nerdy, anxiety ridden former game show winner, add Ralph Fiennes as the well-spoken man named Charles Van Doren who supplants the disgruntled Stempel, and mix in the direction of Robert Redford.  You now have the recipe for which 1994 film?", "correct": "Quiz Show", "options": ["Faraway So Close!", "Second Best", "The Client"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuiz Show.\n\n\t'Quiz Show' is the fascinating true story about a cheating scandal that occurred on the television game show '21' during the 1950s.  Watch for several cameo appearances by various directors, including Martin Scorsese and Barry Levinson. \n"}, {"text": "'Huozhe' is a sweeping epic masterpiece from Chinese director Zhang Yimou.  What English language title was adopted for this masterful 1994 cinematic work?", "correct": "To Live", "options": ["A Family", "Pathways", "Heart and Souls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo Live.\n\n\t'To Live' is among Zhang Yimou's greatest triumphs, the story of a Chinese family that survives through the tumult of the Chinese Civil War and the Cultural Revolution.  The film stars Gong Li and Ge You, two of China's most celebrated actors.  I highly recommend this, one of the best films from China's greatest director. \n"}, {"text": "'The Professional', also known as 'L\u00e9on', is one of the most riveting movies of 1994.  A gut-wrenching drama, a perilous action flick, a heart-warming comedy, all of these could be used to describe this multi-dimensional film.  Which actress is featured as the sweet young Mathilda in this impressive Luc Besson directed movie?", "correct": "Natalie Portman", "options": ["Julia Stiles", "Christina Ricci", "Kirsten Dunst"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNatalie Portman.\n\n\tNatalie Portman was just 13 years old when this film debuted in 1994.  It was her first acting job.  Also featured in the film are Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello.  There are a lot of memorable lines from this film.  One of my favorites is from the title character Leon, who says, 'Revenge is not good. Once you're done. Believe me.' \n"}, {"text": "'Heavenly Creatures' is a stunning fantasy-drama that features the excellent acting of Kate Winslet, among others.  This film was one of the earlier entries from which hugely popular movie director?", "correct": "Peter Jackson", "options": ["Wes Anderson", "Joel Coen", "David Fincher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter Jackson.\n\n\tPeter Jackson really hit a home run with this film about two girls in New Zealand, whose fantasy lives become blurred with reality.  The shocking factual nature of the film's plot (it was based on a true story), makes the proceedings yet more intriguing.  'Heavenly Creatures' marked the debut of Kate Winslet in a feature film, and what a lovely debut it was. \n"}, {"text": "Two clever gangsters trade clever quips before doing a job.  Later, one of the gangsters takes his boss's wife on a date that goes terribly awry.  A boxer who has been paid to throw a fight, decides to win the fight, killing his opponent in the process.  These are the major sub-plots of what too clever for words film of 1994?", "correct": "Pulp Fiction", "options": ["Slackers", "Clerks", "Bandits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPulp Fiction.\n\n\tQuentin Tarantino was back with a vengeance in 1994, and he surprised the world with his casting of John Travolta in a major comeback role as Vincent Vega.  Samuel L. Jackson just missed out on a Best Supporting Actor Oscar; his portrayal of Jules is not to be missed.  Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and Harvey Keitel are also part of a great ensemble cast. \n"}, {"text": "'Ed Wood', a biopic about the almost crazed low-budget film director of the 1950s and 60s, features Johnny Depp in the title role and a hilarious Martin Landau as the aging horror-film icon Bela Lugosi.  Who lovingly directed this quirky little film?", "correct": "Tim Burton", "options": ["John Waters", "Terry Gilliam", "Russ Meyer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTim Burton.\n\n\t'Ed Wood' has Tim Burton's trademark all over it.  Yet, the film has a feeling of artsiness to it that perhaps raises it to a level above Burton's previous projects.  Burton properly pays homage to the classic film era, by employing black and white photography, and he is able to squeeze every drop of acting talent from his two leads, especially Landau in an hilarious take on Bela Lugosi.\r I hope you enjoyed this quiz, thank you for playing.
