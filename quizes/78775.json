", "correct": "Sisowath", "options": ["Monivong", "Sihanouk", "Savannakhet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSisowath.\n\n\tFollowing Norodom's invitation for the French to occupy Cambodia,\racquiescence became the rule for the Cambodian kings.  After Sisowath took power in\r1904, he further helped strengthen French rule in Cambodia and benefited himself by\rstrengthening the now symbolic position of the King.  Sisowath ruled from 1904 to 1927\rwhen he was succeeded by his son Monivong.  The years from 1904 until the death of\rMonivong in 1941 are referred to generally as 'the years of colonial calm'. \n"}, {"text": "The Japanese occupied Cambodia in 1941 (along with the rest of French Indochina) and\ngave Cambodia independence in 1945.  Who became king in that year? ", "correct": "Norodom Sihanouk", "options": ["Sirik Matak", "Norodom Ranariddh", "Barrambang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorodom Sihanouk.\n\n\tSihanouk was merely a 19 year old prince in 1945, and the grandson of\rMonivong. \n"}, {"text": "The new monarchy did not last long, as a successful coup occurred later in 1945.  Who\nwas the leader of this coup?", "correct": "Son Ngoc Thanh", "options": ["Thien That Tran", "Nguyen Luong", "Hien Hung Huy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSon Ngoc Thanh.\n\n\tThanh's stint as prime minister also did\rnot last long as the French soon returned to power in Cambodia, ousting Thanh and\rexiling him back to France.  Followers of Thanh formed the non-Communist 'Khmer\rIssarak' (Free Khmer) to fight against French occupation, and Thanh was able to return to\rCambodia in 1952 to resume his political career. \n"}, {"text": "Cambodia officially won its independence from the French in 1953, and elections were\nheld in 1955 to form the National Assembly.  One party won all of the seats in this\nNational Assembly, what was it called?", "correct": "Sangkum Reastr Niyum", "options": ["Barom Racha", "Norkor Phnom", "Norkor Kuork Phlouk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSangkum Reastr Niyum.\n\n\tThe Sangkum Reastr\rNiyum (People's Socialist Community) was neither socialist nor run by the people.  King\rSihanouk essentially ran the party and the country as he saw fit, modernizing where\rnecessary in order to help uplift the people whom he called his children. \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  Cambodia was a stable country during the late 1950s, but was destabilized in part\nby U.S. interference.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSihanouk's regime was able to gain a pretty good hold on the\rcountry, but unfortunately his nominally socialist regime was unacceptable to the United\rStates and its allies in Thailand and South Vietnam.  The Khmer Issarak was revitalized\rby the Thais and the United States and a failed military coup was attempted in 1959.  In\rthe early 1960s several attempts were made to assassinate Sihanouk while the South\rVietnamese made various incursions into Cambodian borders in further attempts to\rdestabilize the Sihanouk regime.  Sihanouk had no other recourse but to seek assistance\rfrom the Vietnamese communists and the Chinese, leading Cambodia on its inevitable\rpath of extreme leftism.  Sadly, it is possible that the millions of deaths that occurred\rduring the horrible reign of the Khmer Rouge would never have happened had it not been\rfor these events in the 1950s and 60s. \n"}, {"text": "The Cambodian Communist party began to develop strength in the mid-1960s, in the\nmidst of further destabilization in Indochina.  What was this party called?", "correct": "Khmer Rouge & Khymer Rouge", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKhmer Rouge & Khymer Rouge.\n\n\t'Khmer' refers to the great Khmer empire of Cambodia's past, and rouge of course means\r'red' in French, symbolizing Communism. \n"}, {"text": "Pol Pot was an early leader of the Cambodian communists.  What was his real name? ", "correct": "Saloth Sar", "options": ["Ang Chan", "Son Sen", "Ieng Sary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaloth Sar.\n\n\tSaloth Sar became known as Pol Pot, his nom de guerre, in 1976. \n"}, {"text": "In 1970, a bloodless coup succeeded in at-last officially removing the Cambodian king\nfrom power.  Which pro-American fellow took control at this point? ", "correct": "Lon Nol", "options": ["Ta Mok", "Heng Samrin", "Hun Sen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLon Nol.\n\n\tLon Nol\rwas previously the defense minister in Sihanouk's government, but was supported in this\rpower grab by the United States.  Sihanouk was away in France seeking medical\rtreatment at the time, and later formed a government in exile in Beijing. \n"}, {"text": "Bombing campaigns by the United States succeeded in destabilizing the new,\npro-American regime while causing thousands and thousands of deaths.  Terrible as these bombings were, what followed was even worse.  In 1975, the communists officially took\npower in Cambodia, renaming the country 'Kampuchia', and began a campaign to purge\nall enemies from the country.  It is estimated that from 1975 to 1979 how many deaths\noccurred during these campaigns?  ", "correct": "2,000,000", "options": ["8,000", "50,000", "80,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2,000,000.\n\n\tApproximately 2 million people were\rkilled, some only because they wore eyeglasses, during the purges of the Khmer Rouge. \rThe 2 million deaths reduced Cambodia's population by 1/3 in just 4 years making it one\rof the worst genocides in history. \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  The reign of the murderous communists in Cambodia was ended by the\nUnited States and UN forces. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, the Khmer Rouge regime, supported by the\rChinese, was ended in early 1979 by the Communist Vietnamese.  The Vietnamese\rattacked and occupied Cambodia in response to Cambodian incursions on the\rVietnamese border.  Unfortunately, the Vietnamese came too late to prevent the deaths of\rcountless Cambodians, but it is possible that they saved the lives of many others.  Heng\rSamrin was installed as the new puppet leader of Cambodia, and his right hand man was\rHun Sen, who later became the prime minister of a Cambodia finally free of\rcommunism.  Hopefully, a new and relatively free Cambodia will never see the horrors of war and\rgenocide again. \n"}]}
