If she thought one was enough, she was right, the sequel was very weak. \rTalbot was in \"I Married A Monster From Outer Space\". Ohmart was in the Vincent Price version of \"House on Haunted Hill\". Kirk was menaced in Price's \"House of Wax\". \n"}, {"text": "Raymond Burr appears in what Sci Fi Classic?", "correct": "Godzilla", "options": ["Reptilicus", "Gorgo", "Rodan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGodzilla.\n\n\tWell ... you have to start somewhere.
