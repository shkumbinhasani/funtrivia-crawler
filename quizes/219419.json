Bill Murray discovered the answer to this question, and much more, in which charming comedy of 1993?", "correct": "Groundhog Day", "options": ["April Fool's Day", "Labor Day", "Arbor Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGroundhog Day.\n\n\tBill Murray played Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman from Pittsburgh. who has contempt for just about everything, including himself.  After arriving in the small town of Punxsutawney for a Groundhog Day ceremony, he began to feel a sense of deja vu as his days began repeating themselves.  \r Andie MacDowell played Rita, his love interest in the film.  The chemistry between the two, and some entertaining performances by a number of the supporting actors, make this film a must-see. \n"}, {"text": "'A Nightmare Before Christmas' combines Halloween and Christmas into one exciting funfest that must be seen to be believed.  From whose creative (and demented) mind did this wonderful little film emerge?", "correct": "Tim Burton", "options": ["John Waters", "Terry Gilliam", "Stephen King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTim Burton.\n\n\tThough Henry Selick directed 'A Nightmare Before Christmas', this masterwork of stop-action animation was purely the brainchild of Tim Burton, master of the weird.  The voices of Chris Sarandon and Catherine O'Hara were lent to the two main characters, namely Jack Skellington and Sally.  Danny Elfman (as he always does for Tim Burton) provided the music for the film, and he also performed the singing numbers for the Jack Skellington character. \n"}, {"text": "One of the great films of 1993, and for that matter of all time, was 'Schindler's List', the story of an entrepreneur in Nazi Germany who helps save the lives of over a thousand Jewish people.  Who played the role of Oskar Schindler, in this brilliant masterpiece?", "correct": "Liam Neeson", "options": ["Ralph Fiennes", "Ben Kingsley", "Jonathan Sagall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiam Neeson.\n\n\tLiam Neeson was excellent as Schindler.  Ray Fiennes shocked everyone with his performance as the insidious death camp operator Amon Goeth.  Ben Kingsley provided the film with a true moral center, with his fascinating and understated performance as Itzhak Stern, a humble accountant.  And, of course, all of this would not have been possible without the consummate direction of Steven Spielberg. \n"}, {"text": "'In the Name of the Father' was a powerful, character-driven story that featured brilliant performances from Emma Thompson, Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis.  What was the name of the young man played by Mr. Day-Lewis?", "correct": "Gerry Conlon", "options": ["Paul Hill", "Paddy Armstrong", "Robert Dixon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGerry Conlon.\n\n\tIn fact, the casting for this film was brilliant all-round, but the performances of Thompson, Postlethwaite and Day-Lewis especially provided the central characters with a level of depth that simply forced the viewer to stay focused.  \r The story centered around a group of Irish people who were accused of an IRA-planned bombing attack, despite a great deal of existing evidence that appeared to prove their innocence. \n"}, {"text": "A surprising and unexpectedly tender story in the gangster genre, this film featured Robert De Niro as the father of a young man named Calogero.

What was the title of this interesting fable?", "correct": "A Bronx Tale", "options": ["Night Falls on Manhattan", "Crooklyn", "Bus to Queens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Bronx Tale.\n\n\tIn his normal fashion, Robert De Niro submitted an excellent performance as Lorenzo Anello, working class father of young   Calogero, a boy growing up in the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of the 1960's Bronx.  De Niro also directed this film that featured his pal Chazz Palminteri as the local gang leader Sonny.  Palminteri wrote the play upon which this film was based, and on top of that, he wrote the screenplay for the film.  Not surprisingly, the story was semi-autobiographical...Calogero was Chazz Palminteri's real given name. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most entertaining films of 1993 was 'True Romance', an action-drama featuring a fantastic ensemble cast.

Who was the author of this fascinating story?", "correct": "Quentin Tarantino", "options": ["Tim Robbins", "Joel Coen", "David Fincher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuentin Tarantino.\n\n\tEquipped with perhaps the best cast in film history, director Tony Scott brought this Quentin Tarantino-written story to the big screen in 1993.  Included in the marvelous ensemble cast were Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport, James Gandolfini, Tom Sizemore, Bronson Pinchot and Chris Penn.  With such a cast, it's difficult to say who 'stole the show'.  Any opinions? \n"}, {"text": "One of the most beautiful, and sensual, films of 1993 was 'The Piano', a lovely piece directed meticulously by Jane Campion.  In which country did most of the action in this film take place?", "correct": "New Zealand", "options": ["China", "Germany", "South Africa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Zealand.\n\n\tJane Campion is a native to New Zealand, so it is no surprise that the story from her greatest career achievement took place there.

In addition, Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel added their talents to this memorable film. \n"}, {"text": "A film from 1993 that perhaps did not quite receive the attention it deserved, was the fascinating 'Fearless', a story about some survivors of a devastating plane crash.  Who directed this compelling movie?", "correct": "Peter Weir", "options": ["John Sayles", "Martha Coolidge", "Jim Jarmusch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter Weir.\n\n\tAs per usual, this Peter Weir film was a dramatic character study of people who have been placed in a psychologically disturbing situation.  Jeff Bridges was disturbing and brilliant as Max Klein, a man who seemingly had a complete personality change after surviving a plane crash.  Isabella Rossellini played his confused and frustrated wife.  Rosie Perez, in possibly her greatest career performance, played another survivor of the plane crash.  John Turturro, Tom Hulce John De Lancie and Benicio Del Toro additionally helped spice up the film with their acting. \n"}, {"text": "In which film did Michael Douglas play a frustrated worker from the defence industry, who suddenly snapped, embarking on a sometimes violent quest across the crime-filled streets of the Los Angeles area, in order to see his daughter and estranged wife?", "correct": "Falling Down", "options": ["Shining Through", "The Game", "Don't Say a Word"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalling Down.\n\n\t'Falling Down', directed by Joel Schumacher, was another rather overlooked film of 1993.  Michael Douglas was almost frightening as William Foster, a man who simply has been pushed over the edge by the pressures of his crumbling life.  Robert Duvall was marvelous as Detective Martin Prendergast, a police officer on the verge of retirement.  Barbara Hershey and Tuesday Weld were also excellent as the estranged wife of Foster and the wife of Prendergast, respectively.  If you have not already, please give this film a look. \n"}, {"text": "We end this quiz with a Merchant/Ivory production, namely 'The Remains of the Day', a delicately wrought drama about a butler and a housekeeper, who tend the home of a self-styled British diplomat during the years leading up to World War II.
