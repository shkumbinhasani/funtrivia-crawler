{"id": "25074", "name": "Ancient Ionian Scientists Quiz | Scientists | 5 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "Scientists & Inventors", " Scientists"], "questions": [{"text": "Which scientist first discovered that the angles at the base of an isoceles triangle are equal?", "correct": "Thales", "options": ["Euclid", "Pythagoras", "Anaxagoras"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThales.\n\n\tThales may have been the world's first geometer, and is certainly considered by most Westerners to be the first philosopher, in the modern sense of the word.  This Meletan scholar posited that water was the basis of all things, and that the Earth floated upon a giant bed of water. \n"}, {"text": "Which Ionian scientist introduced the sun-dial to the Greek world?", "correct": "Anaximander", "options": ["Diogenes", "Ptolemy", "Empedicles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnaximander.\n\n\tHe probably found the sun-dial while in Babylon or Egypt.  Anaximander was likely the first to determine the solstices and equinoxes.  Unlike Thales, Anaximander believed the universe began as an amorphous mass containing the properties of the 'opposites' (wet and dry, for instance). \n"}, {"text": "Anaximenes believed the essence of all things was air. What did he call this 'air'?", "correct": "Pneuma", "options": ["Cardia", "Taxia", "Pulma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPneuma.\n\n\t'Pneuma' means 'breath' in Greek, so this makes sense.  He was also a Miletan, like Thales and Anaximander...the center of philosophic thought of the time, it was a city (Miletus) on the Ionian coast of Asia Minor. \n"}, {"text": "Which ancient Ionian astronomer introduced the zodiac to the Greek world?", "correct": "Cleostratus", "options": ["Alcmaeon", "Herophilus", "Heracleitus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCleostratus.\n\n\tCleostratus was from Tenedos, somewhat outside the central sphere of Ionian Greece.  He also was responsible for an ancient calendar, based on the solar cycle rather than the lunar one. \n"}, {"text": "He was the first great Greek map-maker and ventured as far as the pillars of Hercules. What was his name?", "correct": "Hecataeus", "options": ["Aristarchus", "Menaechmus", "Apollonius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHecataeus.\n\n\tThe 'pillars of Hercules' are found at the tip of the Meditteranean, where it meets the Atlantic ocean.  In ancient times they were called the 'columns of Melkarth', after an ancient god of Phoenicia.  Hecataeus was from Miletus, like our previous friends, and travelled widely throughout the ancient world.  Thank you for daring to attempt this quiz...I hope you enjoyed it! \n"}]}
