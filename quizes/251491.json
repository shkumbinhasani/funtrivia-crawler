{"id": "251491", "name": "'Dune' (Part VI) Trivia Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Dune"], "questions": [{"text": "While Paul Atreides and his mother have discovered the Fremen, and prepare to exact revenge on the Harkonnens, Thufir Hawat is not so lucky.  He has been captured and poisoned by the Harkonnens.  His only recourse to treat the poison in his body is by consuming the milk of what animal?", "correct": "Cat", "options": ["Dog", "Rat", "Pig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCat.\n\n\tIn one of the truly bizarre (and, dare I say, campy?) moments in the film, a cat is presented to Thufir, complete with an attached rat.  Thufir has been implanted with a heartplug, as is the custom of the evil Harkonnens.  Their added gift is that he has been poisoned and must milk a cat once a day to receive the serum he needs to survive. \n"}, {"text": "Paul Atreides is recruited by the Fremen to teach them fighting skills.  Specifically, they want to learn the Weirding Way.  Paul demonstrates the power of the Weirding by obliterating a large stone shaped in what way?", "correct": "Obelisk", "options": ["Diamond", "Globe", "Cube"], "explanation": "\n\n\nObelisk.\n\n\tBefore he displays his Weirding skills, Paul asks for volunteers to destroy the stone by kicking, hitting, cutting and, yes, even yelling at the large block of granite.  These very ineffective attempts are then followed by Paul's very able application of a Weirding Module to effectively destroy the stone. \n"}, {"text": "Not only does Paul teach the Fremen his fighting skills, he also tames the sandworms.  What is the name of the device he uses to climb to the top of the sandworms?", "correct": "Kiswa maker hook", "options": ["Kralizec climbing hook", "Ghola construct hook", "Chakobsa utility hook"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKiswa maker hook.\n\n\tHere's an interesting trivia tidbit.  When we first see Paul climb the side of the sandworm, the kiswa maker hook slightly pries the segment of the sandworm out, revealing tendons inside.  Those tendons were constructed using condoms! \n"}, {"text": "Paul is provided a bodyguard by the Fremen, consisting of 15 men who will fight to the death for him.  What is the term used for this group of guards?", "correct": "Fedaykin", "options": ["Kralizec", "Qanat", "Mentat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFedaykin.\n\n\tClearly the term Fedaykin is derived from the Arab word 'fedayeen', which refers to a force of Arab guerrilla fighters, who will give their lives to the cause, whatever that may be.  In the case of 'Dune', the cause is protecting Paul Atreides.  The Fedaykin are identifiable by the red paint on their shoulders. \n"}, {"text": "After completing the training of the Fremen, Paul and his forces bring spice production to a standstill.  What old friend of Paul's is he reunited with during this period?", "correct": "Gurney Halleck", "options": ["Duncan Idaho", "Thufir Hawat", "Dr. Kynes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGurney Halleck.\n\n\tNeither Gurney nor Paul are aware that the other is still alive, because they both now use their secret Fremen names.  Naturally, they are very pleased to be reunited and fight side-by-side during the rest of the war against the Harkonnens. \n"}, {"text": "Paul is the first male to drink the Water of Life and survive.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn order for Paul to fulfill the prophecy and become the Kwisatz Haderach he must drink the Water of Life.  Removing himself to the middle of the desert, he drinks the Water of Life and survives.  After Paul drinks the Water, all of the other Bene Gesserit women are shown with bloodied noses.  Paul is now able to see in the place the Bene Gesserit sisters cannot look. \n"}, {"text": "Paul is the one, the Kwisatz Haderach.  With the confidence of this in mind, he and his troops make one final assault on the Harkonnens.  While he and his men ride sandworms into battle against the Harkonnens, who is responsible for the death of Baron Harkonnen himself?", "correct": "Alia", "options": ["Princess Irulan", "Lady Jessica", "Stilgar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlia.\n\n\tAlia confronts Baron Harkonnen and warns him repeatedly.  'Wait until my brother comes,' she ominously threatens.  When the Baron moves to kill her, she removes some tubes in his chest, causing him to float through a breach in the wall and into the waiting stomach of a sandworm. \n"}, {"text": "The Harkonnens defeated, Paul has but one adversary left to conquer, namely Feyd-Rautha.  What does Feyd repeatedly say during his dagger duel with Paul?", "correct": "I will kill you!", "options": ["You will be dead!", "Death is your destiny!", "Defeat is coming!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI will kill you!.\n\n\tThis is Sting's turn to shine, as he utters the line 'I will kill you!' in a state of pure madness.  It doesn't take long for Paul to dispatch of Feyd, though there are a few moments when his adversary gets the upper hand.  After stabbing and killing Feyd, Paul emits a killing sound without the use of the Weirding module. \n"}, {"text": "After the blade fight between Paul and Feyd, something happens on the planet Dune that has never happened before.  What natural phenomenon occurs?", "correct": "Rain", "options": ["A tornado", "Sunlight", "An earthquake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRain.\n\n\tAs the Kwisatz Haderach, Paul commands rain to fall on the desert planet Dune, completing the prophecy.  Alia announced that Paul is indeed the Kwisatz Haderach (as if we didn't know!), and the film is complete! \n"}, {"text": "Finally, what masterful director was responsible for the film 'Dune'?", "correct": "David Lynch", "options": ["Tim Burton", "Ridley Scott", "George Lucas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Lynch.\n\n\tAfter successes with the bizarre 'Eraserhead' and the lovely 1980 film 'The Elephant Man', David Lynch took on this enormous and unusual project.  Though things did not go perfectly for him, it is still a beautifully made film.  Oddly enough, for the 'extended cut' produced for television, additional footage was added.  David Lynch disowned this version, and thus it became an Alan Smithee production.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed this series on 'Dune'! \n"}]}
