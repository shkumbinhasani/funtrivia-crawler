He created the opera 'Eugene Onegin' and the ballet 'Swan Lake', but I would argue that the 'Nutcracker' was his greatest and most enduring work! \n"}, {"text": "Which German romantic writer created the story upon which the Nutcracker ballet was based?", "correct": "Hoffman", "options": ["Friedrich", "Schiller", "Herder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoffman.\n\n\tBased on E.T.A. Hoffman's 'The Nutcracker and the Mouse King' to be exact.  Hoffman was the German writer of numerous fairy stories, with the 'Nutcracker' being his most enduring piece. \n"}, {"text": "The Nutcracker opera was based on 'King Rene's Daughter' by which Danish dramatist?", "correct": "Herz", "options": ["Werner", "Schade", "Aasen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHerz.\n\n\tHendrik Herz was his full name. The opera is of course different from the ballet, a bit darker. \n"}, {"text": "The Nutcracker ballet marked the first use of what instrument in an orchestral score?", "correct": "Celesta", "options": ["Harpsichord", "Hurdy gurdy", "Accordian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCelesta.\n\n\tA celesta is a keyboard instrument, which produces sounds much like bells.  Its name is French, meaning 'celestial'! \n"}, {"text": "The main character of the Nutcracker is a little girl named Clara who receives a Nutcracker from a mysterious individual. What is his name?", "correct": "Drosselmeyer", "options": ["Von Dietrich", "Sternberger", "Weill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrosselmeyer.\n\n\tHerr Drosselmeyer is usually portrayed as an eccentric but kindly older gentleman who has come bearing gifts. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Clara's naughty brother who breaks her beloved gift?", "correct": "Fritz", "options": ["Gustav", "Hans", "Werner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFritz.\n\n\tNaturally, Fritz is jealous of Clara's prize toy, after all...every child wants a nutcracker for Christmas! \n"}, {"text": "In the original choreography, a death occurs in the Nutcracker ballet. True or False?", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Mouse King is killed after a fight between himself and the Nutcracker Prince. Clara hurls her slipper at the Mouse King to kill him. Not very resilient if you ask me... \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a dance of the Nutcracker?", "correct": "Indian", "options": ["Chinese", "Arabian", "Spanish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndian.\n\n\tThese 'national' dances are all performed to the delight of Clara.  My personal favorite is the Spanish dance, for the beautiful melody though, not the dancing.  The Russian dance is the most exciting in the dance category! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Russian dance, the traditional dance of the Cossacks?", "correct": "Trepak", "options": ["Stuvik", "Voltok", "Kulak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrepak.\n\n\tThe Trepak is an active dance that requires very strong legs, I would imagine. \n"}, {"text": "Who dances with the Nutcracker Prince in the Pas de Deux?", "correct": "Sugar-Plum Fairy", "options": ["Irina", "Mother Goose", "The Snow Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSugar-Plum Fairy.\n\n\tThis is perhaps the most beautiful dance duet in the history of ballet, and the Sugar-Plum Fairy part is the second most sought after, behind little Clara herself.  I hope you have enjoyed this little quiz, enjoy listening or watching the Nutcracker this Christmas season! (or the one coming up!) \n"}]}
