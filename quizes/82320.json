Director Orson Welles dressed her in flowing robes and gowns, and placed her behind obstacles in order to mask her condition. \n"}, {"text": "Which character actually *heard* Charles Foster Kane say the word \"Rosebud\" seconds before Kane died?", "correct": "Raymond, the butler", "options": ["Jedediah Leland", "An unnamed nurse", "No one did"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaymond, the butler.\n\n\tIt's a common misconception that no one was in the room when Kane spoke his dying word(s), \"Rosebud\"...but the script itself contradicts this idea.  At the end of the film, when \"News on the March\" reporter Mr. Thompson (William Alland) asks Raymond (Paul Stewart) about the meaning of the term \"Rosebud,\" Raymond states that he heard Kane say \"Rosebud\" just after his second wife left Xanadu...and, he adds, \"that other time, too.\"  We never *see* Raymond in the room during the opening scene of the film when Kane dies, but the dialogue demands (as does logic) that *someone* heard Kane's final words, and Raymond appears to have been that critical witness -- \"that other time, too\" seems to be a reference to Kane's final moment alive. \n"}, {"text": "A rather notable actor appears in several scenes of \"Citizen Kane,\" but his face is obscured in shadow, and his name is barely (if at all, in some prints) noted in the credits.  Who is he?", "correct": "Alan Ladd", "options": ["Jimmy Stewart", "Humphrey Bogart", "Tyrone Power"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlan Ladd.\n\n\tLadd plays one of the reporters in the shadowy \"News on the March\" screening room early in the film, and appears again (still in shadow) in the final scenes.  He received no official credit for his role. \n"}, {"text": "According to a number of biographies and film history texts, cinematographer Gregg Toland \"earned\" his place in the crew of \"Citizen Kane\" by brandishing his Academy Award and stating quite simply to Orson Welles that Welles *needed* him in order to make the movie work.  For what film had Toland won the Academy Award as Best Cinematographer?", "correct": "\"Wuthering Heights\" (1939)", "options": ["\"Intermezzo\" (1939)", "\"The Long Voyage Home\" (1940)", "\"Les Miserables\" (1935)"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Wuthering Heights\" (1939).\n\n\tToland was nominated for every single one of the films mentioned -- and, eventually, for \"Citizen Kane,\" as well -- but by the time he approached Welles, he had only won for \"Wuthering Heights.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following injuries did Orson Welles suffer while making the film?", "correct": "a broken ankle", "options": ["He suffered all of these injuries", "a slipped spinal disc", "a fractured skull"], "explanation": "\n\n\na broken ankle.\n\n\tDuring the shooting of the scene in which Kane chases \"Boss\" Jim Gettys down a flight of stairs, Welles broke his ankle.  He spent some time in a wheelchair after that point, and walked haltingly during his recovery.  This would be a major obstacle for most filmmakers, but Welles simply folded the limp into the walk of the \"older\" Charles Foster Kane for the rest of the shoot. \n"}, {"text": "The editor of \"Citizen Kane\" went on to direct which of the following movies?", "correct": "He directed all of these films", "options": ["\"West Side Story\"", "\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\"", "\"The Sound of Music\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe directed all of these films.\n\n\tRobert Wise directed all three of these films, as well as the original (read: BETTER) version of \"The Haunting\" (1963) and \"The Andromeda Strain.\" \n"}, {"text": "Dorothy Comingore was not born with the name she used in the credits of \"Citizen Kane.\"  What was her real first name?", "correct": "Margaret", "options": ["Summer", "Laura", "Autumn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret.\n\n\tDorothy was born Margaret Louise Comingore, and appeared in several \"Three Stooges\" features before being tapped by Orson Welles for \"Citizen Kane.\" \n"}, {"text": "Orson Welles has been portrayed by a number of actors over the years, in many films.  Which actor has *never* played Welles in a film?", "correct": "D. B. Sweeney", "options": ["Vincent D'Onofrio", "Angus MacFayden", "Liev Schrieber"], "explanation": "\n\n\nD. B. Sweeney\n\n\tMacFayden played Welles in \"Cradle Will Rock\" (1999); Schrieber played Welles quite brilliantly in \"RKO 281\" (1999); D'Onofrio played Welles (with a dubbed-in voice) in \"Ed Wood\" (1994).

During this confrontational scene that Welles insisted on shooting over and over, Cotten misspoke a word, and Welles left that error in the final cut of the film.  What word did the exhausted Cotten mispronounce, even in the final version of the film?", "correct": "criticism", "options": ["cinnamon", "misappropriation", "revisionism"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncriticism.\n\n\tThe sleep-deprived Cotten pronounced \"criticism\" as \"crimitism.\"  Welles liked the authenticity of the error so much that he left it in the film.  Listen for it! \n"}, {"text": "Who actually sang the opera parts for Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) on the film's soundtrack?", "correct": "Jean Forward", "options": ["Dorothy Comingore herself", "Maria Callas", "A studio vocalist whose name has been lost to history"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJean Forward.\n\n\tJean Forward, as far as I can determine, never did anything else in the film industry aside from this thankless role in \"Citizen Kane\" -- and, according to Roger Ebert's commentary on the DVD, composer Bernard Herrmann demanded that she sing a half octave above her natural range in order to make her sound weak! \n"}, {"text": "On what holiday did \"Citizen Kane\" originally premiere in theaters?", "correct": "May Day", "options": ["Independence Day", "April Fool's Day", "Memorial Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMay Day.\n\n\t\"Citizen Kane\" was first shown to the American moviegoing public on May 1, 1941. \n"}, {"text": "Where in New York City did \"Citizen Kane\" enjoy its premiere?", "correct": "the Palace Theatre", "options": ["Radio City Music Hall", "None of these -- the film premiered in Los Angeles", "Times Square Theater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe Palace Theatre.\n\n\tThe original plan was for \"Citizen Kane\" to premiere at Radio City Music Hall, but various circumstances did not allow for that plan to be realized; as a result, \"Citizen Kane\" premiered in a smaller theater. \n"}, {"text": "While Jedediah Leland is being interviewed by Mr. Thompson, Kane's remarkable \"castle\" property is referenced.  By which name does Leland *not* sarcastically call Kane's palatial home in response to the question?", "correct": "He refers to the property by all of these names", "options": ["Shangri-La", "El Dorado", "Sloppy Joe's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe refers to the property by all of these names.\n\n\tLeland: \"What's it called again?  Shangri-La?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?\"  Leland quickly admits to Thompson that he knew that the name of Kane's compound was Xanadu all the time -- he was just pretending not to remember. \n"}]}
