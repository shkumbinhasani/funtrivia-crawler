{"id": "213475", "name": "Weapons in \"Ocarina of Time\" Quiz | Zelda Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Ocarina of Time"], "questions": [{"text": "What are used as ammo for the Fairy Slingshot?", "correct": "Deku Seeds", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeku Seeds.\n\n\tDeku Seeds can be found on the ground (dropped from enemies), in small bushes, and in shops.  Although you start out with thirty Deku Seeds, you can upgrade the satchel to hold up to fifty seeds.  The Fairy Slingshot is only usable as a child, but it's soon replaced by the Fairy Bow, found in the Forest Temple.\rYou can find the Fairy Slingshot within the Great Deku Tree. \n"}, {"text": "How many Bombs can be found in your first Bomb Bag?", "correct": "Twenty", "options": ["Ten", "Thirty", "Forty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwenty.\n\n\tThe first Bomb Bag can be found in Dodongo's Cavern on Death Mountain.  Like many weapons found in dungeons, they are crucial for beating the next boss.  Bomb Bags can be upgraded to hold up to forty Bombs at one time.  One of these upgrades can be found by bombing the Hot Rodder Goron in Goron City. \n"}, {"text": "Where can the sword's Spin Attack be found?", "correct": "Death Mountain", "options": ["Zora's Fountain", "Hyrule Castle", "Desert Colossus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeath Mountain.\n\n\tThe fairy will give you the new technique as well as the ability to use magic for the first time.  This green magic meter will instantly appear underneath your health bar, and it can be refilled by picking up the green Magic Jars found around Hyrule. \n"}, {"text": "Which enemies aren't damaged by the Boomerang?", "correct": "Like-Likes", "options": ["Shaboms", "Tailpasarans", "Biris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLike-Likes.\n\n\tThe Boomerang is a very useful weapon while you're still a child because you can reach Heart Pieces and Gold Skulltula Tokens with ease.  By using Z-targeting, the Boomerang can effectively come in contact with flying enemies, making it much more useful than the Fairy Slingshot for aiming.\rThe Boomerang is found in one of the corridors of Jabu Jabu's Belly. \n"}, {"text": "How many Stalfos must be fought and defeated before you can claim the Fairy Bow (in the room containing the bow's chest)?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "One", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThe three Stalfos are typically like any other Stalfos in the game.  You start off fighting one solitary Stalfos in the room, and once he's defeated, you fight two at once.  The tricky thing is that once you kill one, you'll need to kill the other or else it will come back to life.\rOnce you receive the bow, you can upgrade its quiver twice.  Once in Kakariko Village's Shooting Gallery, and once in the Gerudo Archery Range.  The Fairy Bow is found in the Forest Temple. \n"}, {"text": "How much does the Giant's Knife cost?", "correct": "200 rupees", "options": ["300 rupees", "500 rupees", "400 rupees"], "explanation": "\n\n\n200 rupees.\n\n\tThe Giant's Knife can be bought from Biggoron when Link is an adult.  You can't use the Giant's Knife with a shield, so you're just going around with a sword in both hands.  The sword does more damage than the Master Sword, but it breaks after a few hits (although you can still damage people with the broken sword).  It's a good idea to use the sword for bosses because more damage can be inflicted. \n"}, {"text": "What button can the Megaton Hammer never be set to?", "correct": "Up-C", "options": ["Left-C", "Down-C", "Right-C"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUp-C.\n\n\tThe Up-C button can't have anything equipped on it because it has different uses.  The first is first-person view, and the second is Navi's command.\rThe Megaton Hammer is used to smash, bash, and break things.  You use it to smash boulders, attack Volvagia, and bash certain statues and pillars.  The hammer is also able to open certain grottos only found using the Stone of Agony. \n"}, {"text": "What is not true about the Longshot?", "correct": "It shoots three times farther than the Hookshot", "options": ["It's located in the Water Temple", "It's spring-loaded", "It's received after defeating Shadow Link"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt shoots three times farther than the Hookshot.\n\n\tThe Longshot only shoots twice as far as the Hookshot.  The Longshot will open up more opportunities for you and it will allow you to access many Gold Skulltulas and locations.  It's basically an upgraded Hookshot. \n"}, {"text": "What do you shoot to obtain the Fire Arrow?", "correct": "The sun", "options": ["A flame", "Blue Fire", "You don't shoot anything.  It comes in a chest."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe sun.\n\n\tYou can get the Fire Arrow after defeating Morpha, the boss of the Water Temple.  Immediately afterwards, walk to the plaque on top of the temple, and shoot an arrow into the sun.  A Fire Arrow can be claimed on the island directly in front of you.\rThe Fire Arrow uses 2 MP, but it comes in handy on some occasions. \n"}, {"text": "Where is the Bombchu Shop located?", "correct": "Hyrule Market", "options": ["Kakariko Village", "Gerudo Valley", "Goron City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyrule Market.\n\n\tYou can only access this shop as child Link because Hyrule Market is destroyed by Ganondorf in the future.  When you buy any of the Bombchus from this shop, the lot they were in is gone for good, so use them wisely.  Bombchus are only required in one dungeon of the game - The Spirit Temple. \n"}]}
