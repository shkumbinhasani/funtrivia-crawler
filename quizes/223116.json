The song \"I Will Call Upon the Lord\" is from Psalm 18.  What is the verse that gives us the song?", "correct": "3", "options": ["5", "4", "6"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tPsalm 18:3 \"I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.\"\r The rest of the this popular church chorus can be found in Psalm 18:46. \n"}, {"text": "Psalm 23 is one of the best known, and recited books of the Bible.

Since it was so common, many references in the Bible relate to farming, especially sheep. The shepherd takes care of his sheep and makes sure they have everything they need. Likewise, the Lord takes care of us, and makes sure we have everything we need. \n"}, {"text": "What does David ask God to forgive?", "correct": "All his sins", "options": ["Taking someone else's wife", "Being late to church", "His appearance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll his sins.\n\n\tPsalm 25:18 \"Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.\"\r David's sins can be found in II Samuel 12:1-14. He committed adultery when he slept with Bathsheba.  Then he committed murder when he killed her husband. There are other sins as well but those are two that are well known about David. David's story shows that God can forgive anything...even murder. \n"}, {"text": "In Psalm 28:7 David says: \"The Lord is my _________ and my _______________.\" What two \"S\" words complete the verse?", "correct": "strength and shield", "options": ["shoulder and shield", "song and sonnet", "savior and staff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nstrength and shield.\n\n\tThere was a song written based on this verse as well called \"Strength and Shield\".

He says we can be angry at the act, not the person. This makes sense because anger toward people leads to cruel actions and even murder. \n"}, {"text": "Who will borrow and not pay back?", "correct": "the wicked", "options": ["friends", "family", "government"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe wicked.\n\n\tPsalm 37:21 \"The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.\"\r There are 150 chapters in the book of Psalms.
