{"id": "225185", "name": "When Marvel and DC Cross Paths Multiple Choice Quiz | Entertainment | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Comics"], "questions": [{"text": "DC's \"Omega Men\" no. 3 (June 1983) marked the first appearance of Lobo, an over-the-top character who was specifically created to be a parody of an extremely popular Marvel Comics character.  Which one?", "correct": "Wolverine & Logan", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWolverine & Logan.\n\n\tWriter Roger Slifer and penciller Keith Giffen seemed to be going for a minor in-joke, but Lobo actually became quite popular in his own right, and wound up appearing in multiple mini-series, and even earning a regular series at DC. \n"}, {"text": "DC's silver age Flash, Barry Allen, died in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" no. 8 (November 1985).  A few years later, a Marvel comic paid homage to this milestone character by having him appear in a thinly disguised form, winning a huge super-speedster race and being referred to as \"Buried Alien.\"  Which title featured this unusual (and techinically unofficial) appearance of Barry Allen?", "correct": "Quasar", "options": ["The Fantastic Four", "Doctor Strange", "Speedball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuasar.\n\n\tThe man called \"Buried Alien\" had long blond hair and an unkempt beard, and seemed very confused about both where and who he was, although he seemed to know that he was from a \"Different Cosmos\" (get it?).  He won the footrace and promptly vanished.  I thought it was a nice nod to the Fastest Man Alive on the part of the late, great writer Mark Gruenwald. \n"}, {"text": "John Byrne is a writer/artist who has done extensive work for both Marvel and DC.  In 1990, he strongly suggested with two pages of art and script that, due to some interdimensional gymnastics, a certain Marvel character and a certain DC character were actually the same person!  Which ones?", "correct": "Mr. Mxyzptlk and The Impossible Man", "options": ["Hawkeye and Green Arrow", "Darkseid and Galactus", "Doctor Doom and Lex Luthor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Mxyzptlk and The Impossible Man\n\n\t\"Superman\" Vol. 2 no. 50 (December 1990) features 5th-dimensional imp Mr. Mxyzptlk, a diminuitive scamp with transformative powers who likes to play irritating games with the Man of Steel.  For two pages, though, John Byrne shows Mxyzptlk off \"on vacation\" playing with his \"fantastic new friends\" -- namely, Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four -- as a green-and-purple shapeshifter.  Fantastic Four fans should recognize this reference to The Impossible Man, an equally troublesome imp with a similar personality (if not necessarily identical powers).\r The Fantastic Four are never fully shown, of course, but we see enough of their costumes (or, in the case of The Thing, his physique) and hear enough of their dialogue to recognize them clearly.  Fun is fun, but DC probably didn't want a lawsuit from Marvel over the unauthorized use of their characters! \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Avengers\" no. 85 (March 1971), writer Roy Thomas introduced a team of super-beings called the Squadron Supreme.  These super-beings were rather obviously designed to be analogues of DC Comics' Justice League of America.  Which of the following statements is NOT accurate regarding the Squadron Supreme?", "correct": "Hyperion is an analogue of Aquaman.", "options": ["Power Princess is an analogue of Wonder Woman.", "Nighthawk is an analogue of Batman.", "Doctor Spectrum is an analogue of Green Lantern."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyperion is an analogue of Aquaman.\n\n\tHyperion -- the sole survivor from an alien planet who was raised on Earth by humans and possesses remarkable strength, flight capability, and numerous vision powers -- is an analogue of Superman, DC Comics' primary icon.  If you're looking for Aquaman's analogue in the Squadron, that would be Amphibian. \n"}, {"text": "From the late 80's through the mid-90's, DC Comics proudly published \"The Sandman,\" a literate, intricate monthly series written by Neil Gaiman that primarily focused on The Endless, seven godlike beings who embodied certain concepts that were part and parcel of the human condition.\n\nOne of the Endless was Death, who generally appeared as a \"goth girl,\" and spent most of her time doing exactly what you would expect: gathering/guiding the souls of the recently departed.  In 1994, she made a surprise appearance in an issue of a  Marvel comic book.  Which one?", "correct": "The Incredible Hulk", "options": ["The Amazing Spider-Man", "The Fantastic Four", "The Mighty Thor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Incredible Hulk.\n\n\tIn \"The Incredible Hulk\" no. 418 (June 1994), Death made a brief appearance, giving the gift of a brush to Marlo Chandler, the bride-to-be, on her wedding day to Rick Jones, longtime friend of the Hulk.  This was writer Peter David's way of making good on the ominous promise he had made in a previous issue (\"Plus: Marlo has a brush with death!\").  Mr. David and Mr. Gaiman are apparently good friends, which eased the way for the cameo appearance. \n"}, {"text": "In the early 80's, DC's \"The New Teen Titans\" introduced a new character named Terra, a superhuman who wound up being far less benevolent than she originally seemed.  Writer Marv Wolfman has stated on several occasions that Terra was created solely because of the immense popularity of a certain Marvel character.  Which one?", "correct": "Kitty Pryde", "options": ["The Black Cat", "Dark Phoenix", "She-Hulk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKitty Pryde.\n\n\tKitty Pryde, the teenaged mutant ingenue, was introduced in \"Uncanny X-Men\" no. 129 (January 1980), at a time when the X-Men were the hottest thing going at Marvel.  The New Teen Titans, in some circles, were more or less considered DC's \"competition\" for that title, so Marv Wolfman and artist George Perez decided to introduce a fresh young female character of their own...but the twist was that Terra, as opposed to Kitty, was an evil, duplicitious traitor from day one, placed into the Titans for the sole purpose of destroying them! \n"}, {"text": "As of February 2006, there have actually been numerous single-issue collaborations between Marvel and DC in which characters from the two separate \"universes\" have interacted.  Which is NOT one of these collaborative efforts?", "correct": "X-Men/JLA", "options": ["Batman/Hulk", "Punisher/Batman", "Green Lantern/Silver Surfer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nX-Men/JLA.\n\n\tThere has never been an X-Men/JLA crossover.  (And if you think I'm making up \"Batman/Hulk\"...well, I only WISH that I were.  Go check it out, if you dare.  It's pretty goofy stuff.) \n"}, {"text": "In 1996, dreams finally came true for many longtime fans of both Marvel and DC: the two companies agreed to co-publish a mini-series (entitled, predictably enough, \"Marvel vs. DC\") in which the characters from the two universes would not only interact, but face each other in combat.  Several \"title bouts\" were designed, pitting flagship characters against each other in fights that many fans had only dreamed about ever seeing on the printed page.\n\nIn almost all cases, there was a clear winner in each \"title bout.\"  One match-up, though, turned out to be a draw.  Which one?", "correct": "Batman vs. Captain America", "options": ["Superman vs. The Hulk", "Storm vs. Wonder Woman", "Iron Man vs. Green Lantern"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatman vs. Captain America\n\n\tFor the record, Superman beat The Hulk; Storm beat Wonder Woman (which, to this day, makes no sense to me at all); and Iron Man never even faced Green Lantern -- I made that one up.\r Batman and Captain America traded feints and blocks and swings and misses and dodges and deflections for a while...but they eventually realized that they were too evenly matched in unarmed combat to bother with a continued battle.  They then worked together to solve the larger problem of the merging universes.  (Can anyone say \"cop-out\"?) \n"}, {"text": "As a clever finale to the \"Marvel vs. DC\" mini-series, the two universes were briefly merged into something new, called \"Amalgam Comics.\"  For a week or two, fans were presented with comic books featuring the adventures of characters who embodied the personas, powers, costumes, and histories of multiple iconic characters from the two disparate universes that had been kind of \"smushed together\".\n\nWhich \"amalgamation\" did we NOT see during this period?", "correct": "Thor and Wonder Woman", "options": ["Spider-Man and Superboy", "Superman and Captain America", "The Flash and Ghost Rider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThor and Wonder Woman.\n\n\tSuper-Soldier was a merge of Superman and Captain America.  The Flash and Ghost Rider (with a touch of DC's Demon thrown in for good measure) became Speed Demon.  Spider-Boy was...well, you can guess.\r Thor was merged with DC's Orion to become (awkwardly, if you ask me) \"Thorion\", while Wonder Woman and Storm merged to become the John Byrne-created \"Amazon.\" \n"}, {"text": "The first major Marvel/DC crossover was \"Superman vs. Spider-Man\", back in \"Marvel Treasury Edition\" no. 28 (1976).  Which character did NOT appear in that milestone issue?", "correct": "Lana Lang", "options": ["Lex Luthor", "Mary Jane Watson", "Doctor Octopus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLana Lang.\n\n\tSuperman and Spider-Man faced the villainy of Doc Ock and Luthor, and Mary Jane Watson was one of the hostages said villains used against the heroes.  Lana Lang was not in \"Marvel Treasury Edition\" no. 28, but she did appear in \"Superman and Spider-Man\", the second meeting of the two icons, a few years later. \n"}]}
