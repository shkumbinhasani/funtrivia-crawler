{"id": "381613", "name": "\"Masked Rider\" - The Pilot Quiz | TV for Kids | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "TV for Kids", " TV for Kids I-R"], "questions": [{"text": "What was the last name of the family that \"adopted\" Prince Dex when he arrived on Earth?", "correct": "Stewart", "options": ["Smith", "Johnson", "Jones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStewart.\n\n\tThe Stewart family was already a multicultural group, so the addition of one more went unnoticed by neighbors and other townspeople. There was a white father, Asian mother, and African American brother among the family. \n"}, {"text": "What town did Dex land in on Earth?", "correct": "Leawood", "options": ["Coast City", "Angel Grove", "National City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeawood.\n\n\tDex landed in a giant crater just outside of the Stewarts' house. He was followed to the planet by Count Dregon and his evil minions. The Stewarts quickly decided to let him stay with them. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the creature that came to Earth with Dex?", "correct": "Ferbus", "options": ["Alpha", "Herbie", "Sasha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFerbus.\n\n\tFerbus' species wasn't identified in pilot, but he was identified in later episodes as a Monotomonax. He was a hairy bipedal creature with a bird-like beak for a mouth. \n"}, {"text": "Who gave Dex his powers?", "correct": "King Lexian", "options": ["Alpha 5", "Zordon", "Count Dregon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKing Lexian.\n\n\tKing Lexian was Dex's grandfather. He bestowed the Masked Rider powers on Dex just before sending him to Earth to stop Count Dregon from enslaving it. \n"}, {"text": "What did Count Dregon call his army of evil minions?", "correct": "Insectovores", "options": ["Cogs", "Putties", "Tengu Warriors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsectovores.\n\n\tNaming the minions Insectovores made a lot of sense with the inhabitants of Edinoi evolving from insects instead of apes.\r The creatures were less evolved than Dex's race though, and still bore a resemblance to bugs. While the members of the army of the recurring baddies were called Maggots, they also were members of the Insectovores. \r When using his powers, Dex also had antennas on his head, making him appear bug-like. \n"}, {"text": "Dex is the nephew of the villain Count Dregon.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tBecause Dregon was the youngest of King Lexian's children, he could not inherit the Masked Rider powers. Instead he chose to attack the planet and try to take it over. When his forces started to run short he chose to instead attempt to enslave Earth to give him more warriors to fight on his side. \n"}, {"text": "When transformed into his Masked Rider identity, what is one of Dex's modes of transportation?", "correct": "Motorcycle", "options": ["Horse", "Skateboard", "Helicoptor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMotorcycle.\n\n\tDex had both a motorcycle and car, though the motorcycle was used more often in the pilot and the series as a whole.\r Both vehicles talked and had names. The car was called Magno and the bike was called the Combat Chopper. \n"}, {"text": "How did Dex learn to speak conversational English?", "correct": "Watching TV", "options": ["Listening to the radio", "Reading books", "Talking to kids at school"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWatching TV.\n\n\tAt the suggestion of Albee Stewart, Dex stayed up all night watching various TV shows the night he arrived on Earth. Albee hadn't intended for Dex to stay up all night, but the situation worked enough to let Dex get by and not be seen as an alien. \n"}, {"text": "What is alien about Dex's appearance?", "correct": "He has a gemstone in his forehead.", "options": ["He has pointy ears.", "He has an eye hidden in the back of his head.", "He has a claw instead of a left hand."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has a gemstone in his forehead.\n\n\tMost people on the planet Edenoi were telepathic. They worked their powers through the gemstones embedded in their heads. Dex managed to hide his stone using his powers when interacting with most humans. \n"}, {"text": "Who started a food fight at the school?", "correct": "Ferbus", "options": ["Albee", "Dex", "King Lexian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFerbus.\n\n\tFerbus tossed some pieces of food off a table at the back of one of the Maggots' heads then hid. When the Maggot turned around, it saw the other Maggot standing near the table. The two Maggots then started fighting with each other and throwing food. The distraction allowed the people hiding in the school to be safe until Dex was able to arrive and defeat the Maggots. \n"}]}
