", "correct": "Abaddon", "options": ["Abacus", "Abaris", "Abbassid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbaddon.\n\n\tThe word 'abaddon comes from the Hebrew 'abad', and means 'ruin' or 'death'.  This term can be found in the New Testament book called Revelations, chapter nine, and several times in the Old Testament.

Don Vicente, a native of Barcelona, was said to have killed several people in 1836 in order that he may acquire a single rare book.  When these guys said, 'I'd kill for that book', they were not kidding! \n"}, {"text": "There are certain words one must know in every foreign language, and such is the case with the word 'beer'.   'Pombe' is the term for beer in which of these languages?
