The Doctor, of course, has been investigating, but was never aware of the planned shift in space; it was organized by the Judoon, who separated the building from London due to the lack of jurisdiction they had in bringing an alien criminal to justice. Fortunately, The Doctor and Martha are able to solve the mystery and identify the culprit, a Plasmavore masquerading as an old woman, before she can set off a super-charged MRI machine, destroy half the Earth, and escape in the Judoon ships. Following this adventure, the Doctor decides to take Martha onto the TARDIS as a thank you. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Shakespeare Code\" - Martha and the Doctor head to London in 1599 to witness an authentic Shakespearean performance, but which of these plays do they see?", "correct": "Love's Labour's Lost", "options": ["All's Well That Ends Well", "As You Like It", "Hamlet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLove's Labour's Lost.\n\n\tPromising Martha one trip through time and space, the Doctor brings her back to London in 1599 to witness the premiere of Shakespeare's \"Love's Labour's Lost\" and then, quickly, meet the writer himself at a local inn.  What they discover, however, is that he also plans to premiere \"Love's Labour's Won\", a play that never actually ended up debuting, according to Martha. What they discover is that a near-extinct alien-race known as the Carrionites is using the power of language to bring back their type back into the universe.  They nearly get away with it, but the Doctor convinces Shakespeare to banish them to a crystal ball once and for all. When all is said and done, \"Love's Labour's Won\" is destroyed and Queen Elizabeth I, horribly angry with the Doctor upon arriving at the Globe (for something he's not quite aware of) chases them to the TARDIS. \n"}, {"text": "\"Gridlock\" - The Doctor brings Martha to New New York.  What do they discover in the 'Fast Lane' of the Motorway?", "correct": "The Macra", "options": ["The Daleks", "The Menoptra", "The 456"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Macra.\n\n\tTaking Martha on another trip, this time into the distant future, the Doctor ends up bringing her to one of the places he brought Rose, New New York on New Earth.  When he arrives this time, however, it's in the slums, and Martha is promptly whisked away by two people who plan to bring her with them into the carpool 'Fast Lane' of the New New York Motorway, one which has trapped drivers for decades without letting them out. When the Doctor follows he discovers that feral, enlarged Macra, crab-like creatures, devour people in their vehicles at the bottom of the Motorway, and the only way he can inevitably save Martha (and the rest of New New York) is with the help of the Face of Boe, who's dying up in the now-empty senate on the surface. Fortunately, the Doctor and the Face of Boe are able to do so, though at the cost of the latter's life.  Following this, Martha is able to get the Doctor to open up a bit about his past. \n"}, {"text": "\"Daleks in Manhattan\"/\"Evolution of the Daleks\" - Visiting New York City in the 1930s, Martha and the Doctor discover that which Dalek group has begun its invasion?", "correct": "The Cult of Skaro", "options": ["Mark IV Daleks", "The Supreme Daleks", "Necros Daleks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Cult of Skaro.\n\n\tThe Cult of Skaro, who previously appeared in London during the Doctor's final adventure with Rose, return in this instance to commence their new operations.  The Doctor, opting to take Martha to the actual New York, ends up bringing her to the 1930s during the construction of the Empire State Building. What they find, however, is that the Cult of Skaro is transforming local workers into pigmen and attempting to infuse them with Dalek DNA to make hybrids, one of whom ends up being attacked by the Cult in mutiny when they realize his new motives.  With the help of a dancer named Tallulah, the Doctor and Martha put an end to most of the Cult, but not before one of the Daleks, Caan, escapes at the last moment. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Lazarus Experiment\" takes place in the present time.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Doctor, having fulfilled his promise to Martha, returns her to her apartment in London and is set to depart...that is until he catches word that a professor has found the alleged fountain of youth in science.

The Doctor discovers what it is-- it's actually an infection spread by the living star outside, only spread because the ship was mining it.

Unfortunately, they're found hiding in 1913 England where the Doctor, now a school teacher named John Smith, is unaware of anything going on.  Much of the time is spent by Martha trying to bring the Doctor back to his senses, even though he fears reverting back to his normal self.

She determines that the Weeping Angels are responsible when she and her roommate's brother, Larry, watch the Doctor on a DVD originally filmed in the past and the two of them head to a house outside the city to help.

Unfortunately, a man named Professor Yana possesses a watch similar to the Doctor's when he stored his memories within it in 1913.  The watch transfers its powerful contents into the Professor when he opens it, bringing to life a great nemesis of the Doctor's-- The Master-- and he begins to take the TARDIS and strand them where they are.  They're only able to follow it using Jack's vortex manipulator to jump back in time...to the twenty-first century.\r The Doctor and Martha realize as soon as they return that The Master is none other than Harold Saxon, the new Prime Minister of Britain.  He's also been hunting down The Doctor, and he's known that Martha has been involved; her apartment has been booby trapped and her family has been captured.  He also introduces the world to the Toclafane, an alleged alien race that plans to make harmonious contact with Earth.  The adventure takes them to the Valiant, an aircraft carrier in the sky, and they find that the TARDIS has been recreated into a paradox machine.  The Master ultimately reveals himself to the world, killing the U.S. President in the process, and activating the TARDIS to let loose the Toclafane, spreading six billion of them onto Earth via the created vortex.  The Master temporarily kills Jack with his laser screwdriver while preventing the Doctor's regeneration, significantly aging him with Dr. Lazarus' technology.

He finds her before that can happen and he brings her back to the Valiant, but in doing so he reunites her with the Doctor, allowing him to verify that she followed his plans.  Using peoples' channeled energy, he's able to tap into the power of the Archangel satellite network and bring himself back to his normal self, reverting his age back.\r Martha, her family, and Jack head out to destroy the paradox machine, reverting time back one year to the moment at which the Toclafane would have emerged.  In that moment, The Master's human wife shoots him and he dies in the Doctor's arms.  Without the Doctor's knowing, someone retrieves the Master's ring.\r Jack leaves the Doctor and continues to run his new version of Torchwood while Martha decides to stay in London with her family, despite her love for the Doctor, leaving him alone.
