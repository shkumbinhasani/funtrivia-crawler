The band begins with their songs sung throughout season three of \"The Sing-Off\", which they won.  Then they play a few of their own songs from their first album, including \"The Baddest Girl\" and \"Love You Long Time\".  Following this performance is a medley of cover songs, and a guest appearance by Lindsey Stirling to play violin in their Imagine Dragons cover of \"Radioactive\".\n\nWhich band (which is my favorite) are we watching tonight?", "correct": "Pentatonix", "options": ["Nota", "Urban Method", "Committed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPentatonix.\n\n\tPentatonix won the third season of \"The Sing-Off\" in 2011 (Nota was season one's winner, and Committed won season two).  They are an a cappella electronic band of five.  In 2012, they released their first EP album \"PTX Volume 1\", which contained a few popular cover songs as well as some of their own music.\r Though mostly an a cappella group, they released a video (and digital download) of an Imagine Dragons song in 2013.  The song was \"Radioactive\", and they collaborated with dubstep violinist (you heard me right; dubstep violinist) Lindsey Stirling.  If you enjoy electronic music, I implore you to have a listen to this song; it is my favorite song by Pentatonix. \n"}, {"text": "Our next concert is a young punk singer (who happens to be my favorite) that began as a one-man-band.  He played guitar, drums, and the harmonica.  Later on he got an entire band, but quite honestly, I like the older stuff better.  The concert started with his older songs, before the band, including songs off of \"The Yippee\" and \"The Summer\" EP albums.  My favorite song he performed was \"I Love You 5\".\n\nWhat is the stage name of this singer?", "correct": "Never Shout Never", "options": ["The Honorary Title", "The Scene Asthetic", "Forever the Sickest Kids"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNever Shout Never.\n\n\tNever Shout Never (sometimes stylized as Nevershoutnever) originated in 2007 with just Christofer Drew Ingle.  The band was called The Shout, but later Never Shout Never became the name of the entire band.  His first EP album \"Demo-shmemo\" was released in 2008, and his first studio album in 2010 (\"What Is Love?\").  His second studio album, also released in 2010, reached number fourteen on the US Billboard 200 album chart. The album, \"Harmony\", was unique; it included flower seeds in the packaging (a limited edition version even contained a flowerpot).  The reason?  According to the album's instructions: \"so you can get involved and make the world a more beautiful place!\" \n"}, {"text": "Next up is a wonderful concert with John Vesely.  Beginning his career as a solo artist, he released his album \"Awake\" in 2005.  For his next album, he had a band, and for most of the show, the band was with him.  My favorite was his performance of \"Fall For You\", perhaps his most recognized single from \"A Twist in My Story\".\n\nWhat is the stage name of John Vesely, our next concert?", "correct": "Secondhand Serenade", "options": ["Secondhand Lions", "Secondhand Firstfoot", "Secondhand Clothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSecondhand Serenade.\n\n\tJohn Vesely released his first demo CD called \"Awake\" in 2005 under the name Secondhand Serenade.  In 2007, it was re-released as a studio album; and with this re-release he also released a single called \"Vulnerable\".  A year later, his second album was released, called \"A Twist in My Story\", and it contained the song \"Fall For You\".  The album did much better than \"Awake\"; it reached 44 on US charts whereas the first album only reached 164.  In 2012, he released an acoustic version of \"A Twist in My Story\", called \"A Naked Twist in My Story\". \n"}, {"text": "I also enjoy R&B, so our next concert is of one of my favorite R&B artists.  The concert was full of wonderful singles, including her first, \"I Wanna Be Down\", and my favorite \"Put it Down\".  It was also exciting to see Monica make a cameo appearance to sing \"The Boy Is Mine\" with her.\n\nWho is the artist in concert now?", "correct": "Brandy", "options": ["Mary J. Blige", "Aaliyah", "Whitney Houston"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrandy.\n\n\tBrandy Norwood, who is known simply by her first name, released her first self-titled album in 1994.  The album did fairly well; it contained two number one Billboard Hot R&B songs as well as one number two.  In 2002, her third album, \"Full Moon\", reached number on the the US R&B album chart.  Her fifth album was released in 2008 (the album was \"Human\").\r Before her sixth album released, it was decided Brandy needed a new persona; and after a bit of peer pressure from friends and colleagues, Brandy created an edgier alter-ego of herself, known as Bran'Nu.  With that, in 2012, \"Two Eleven\" was released, with a more hip-hop feel, and with a bit more rap than previous Brandy albums.  The album met with success, debuting at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 (her first to do so in eight years).  \"Two Eleven\" gets its name from Brandy's birthday and also the day her friend Whitney Houston died. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite singers is this one, who is every bit as good live as she is in a studio (and not many nowadays sound very good live).  As the concert unfolds, you feel as though you are growing older with this singer; she began with some early work she did when she was discovered on MySpace in 2006.  She followed that with songs from her debut album, \"19\", which represented her age at the time.  Next up was her life as a 21-year-old; and you could feel in her music that she had matured two years.\n\nWhich artist is next up on our concert tour?", "correct": "Adele", "options": ["P!nk", "Ke$ha", "Cher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdele.\n\n\tAdele Laurie Blue Adkins, who is known simply as Adele, was discovered through MySpace when a friend of hers posted a demo on the site in 2006.  In 2008, Adele released her first album, \"19\".  In 2011, her second album was released, entitled \"21\".  This album won her six Grammy Awards in 2012; tying Beyonce's record of most Grammy's won in a single night.  Adele also became only the second person to win all four General Field awards (Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Album of the Year, and Best New Artist). \n"}, {"text": "The next concert again took us through a journey.  It began as a concert of Kara's Flowers, where they sang several songs, including \"Soap Disco\".  After the performances as Kara's Flowers, James Valentine came on stage, to complete the band that replaced Kara's Flowers in 2001.  They sang some wonderful songs; \"Harder to Breathe\" (their first single under their new band name), \"This Love\", and then Christina Aguilera appeared to sing \"Moves Like Jagger\" alongside the band.\n\nWhich band is in concert now?", "correct": "Maroon 5", "options": ["Blink 182", "Eiffel 65", "UB40"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaroon 5.\n\n\tMaroon 5 formed in 1994, but were known then as Kara's Flowers.  Only one studio album was released, and it did not fair well.  The band self-released a few more albums, then parted ways.  In 2001, the band, fronted by Adam Levine, joined James Valentine and created a new band, Maroon 5.  Under the new name, they released their first album, \"Songs About Jane\", in 2002.  Their fourth album, \"Overexposed\" (2012), contains some of my favorites songs; \"Daylight\", \"Payphone\", and \"Love Somebody\", to name only a few.  The album also contains the song \"Tickets\", namesake of this very quiz. \n"}, {"text": "It seems to surprise a lot of people, but I do like rap music.  This next concert is of a successful female rapper.  The concert began with her mixtapes and then followed the songs of Young Money where she had rapping parts, such as \"BedRock\" and \"Roger That\".  Following the Young Money performances, there was a large medley of songs that this artist is the featured artist of.  Getting so many people to join in a concert is difficult so she sang her own versions of these songs such as \"Bottom's Up\", \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\", and \"Massive Attack\".  Next was a medley of all her songs as a solo artist, and not as featured artist; she ended the concert by raining \"Pink Friday\" perfume from the ceiling.\n\nWhich rapper is featured in this concert?", "correct": "Nicki Minaj", "options": ["Eve", "Foxy Brown", "Li'l Kim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNicki Minaj.\n\n\tNicki Minaj released her first mixtape under Young Money in 2007 (\"Playtime is Over\").  She was also featured as one of a large variety of artists from the group called Young Money on a few of their albums.  She was a featured artist in numerous successful songs, including \"2012\", \"Letting Go (Dutty Love)\" and \"Beauty and a Beat\".  As a solo artist, however, she did not gain fame until the release of her 2010 album \"Pink Friday\".\r Nicki Minaj has been considered the most influential female rapper of all time by many, which can be proven by her mind-blowing record of 44 singles in the Billboard Hot 100 by April of 2013.  Besides her music, Nicki Minaj has also been a judge of \"American Idol\" in 2013, the voice of one character from \"Ice Age: Continental Drift\", and also released a fragrance in 2012.  Nicki Minaj has also become a fashion icon; she wears loud and strange costumes, wigs, and makeup, but due to her unique style, Mattel even released a Barbie based on Minaj (which is fitting, since Nicki Minaj is sometimes known as \"the living Barbie\"). \n"}, {"text": "I really enjoyed the next concert. It started with five different acts, each singing songs they performed on \"The X Factor\". After each performed individually, they left the stage, and returned as a unified group. They continued with their performances from the show, and then sang the songs from their first two albums. My favorites were \"Irresistible\" and \"Taken\", though the rest of the crowd seemed to prefer \"One Thing\" and \"What Makes You Beautiful\".\n\nWhat group performed this concert for us?", "correct": "One Direction", "options": ["OneRepublic", "The Wanted", "N'Sync"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne Direction.\n\n\tOne Direction appeared on series 7 of the UK reality series \"The X Factor\" (2010). The group began as five different contestants in the boy's section, but were actually eliminated from the competition. However, after final judging in one round, Simon Cowell noted that the groups section of the show was lacking, and created two new groups from eliminated contestants (Belle Amie was created from the eliminated girls and One Direction from eliminated boys). Now a group, the five eliminated became what was known as One Direction. The group faired well in the competition, placing third.\r The band stuck together after \"The X Factor\", and released their first album in 2011 (\"Up All Night\"). In 2012, their second album, \"Take Me Home\", was released. They released several hit singles with these albums, including \"What Makes You Beautiful\", \"Up All Night\", \"Live While We're Young\", and \"One Thing\". \n"}, {"text": "The next concert showed us the life of a boy. The performance began with an accordion, which is exactly how this singer got his start. During the performance, we heard the song he sang at the White House and Hank Williams, Jr. came on stage to sing \"Jambalaya\" with him, just as he had done when he was but a boy. We heard songs from his independent albums, and finally reached the release of his debut album, where he performed songs such as \"Wanted\" and \"Somebody's Heartbreak\".\n\nWhich singer am I enjoying in concert now?", "correct": "Hunter Hayes", "options": ["Tim McGraw", "Luke Bryan", "Scotty McCreery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHunter Hayes.\n\n\tEvery time I read Hunter Hayes' story, I cannot help but be astounded. From a young age, Hayes was interested in music. When he was two years old, he received a toy accordian as a gift. I would imagine most two-year-olds would be very unhappy they didn't get candy, but Hayes loved his accordian, and when he was five years old he was given a custom-made accordian that fit his small hands. The youngster became famous in Louisiana, and performed \"Jambalaya\" alongside Hank Williams, Jr. when he was only four!  Three years later, Hunter Hayes was invited to perform at a White House lawn party for Bill Clinton, released an album when he was only nine (he even wrote most of the songs), and appeared on \"America's Most Talented Kids\" at 13. By 21, he had released his debut studio album, \"Hunter Hayes\" (2011) which was nominated for three Grammy Awards, had learned to play over thirty instruments, and was an opening act for Carrie Underwood's \"Blown Away\" tour.\r As I near 21, I think of how impressive all those achievements are. I can't sing, I play no instruments, I don't know how to write a good song, I've never seen a Grammy Awards on TV, and I couldn't even fine Pennsylvania Avenue when I visited Washington, D.C., let alone sing for the president. \n"}, {"text": "I am a man of many likes, so our next concert is one in the world of dubstep. The artist is Sonny Moore, and the concert began with performances from his emo band known as From First to Last. A medley of remixes followed, including my favorite, a remix of Benny Benassi's \"Cinema\". Songs from his extended plays included \"WEEKENDS!!!\", \"Bangarang\", and \"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\". Of course, I tend to prefer lesser known songs, and my favorite was \"First of the Year\".\n\nWhich artist is performing for our final concert?", "correct": "Skrillex", "options": ["Burial", "Author", "Nero"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkrillex.\n\n\tSonny John Moore, known as Skrillex, got his music start with a band called From First to Last, who released two albums. As a solo artist, he released many originals and remixes as Sonny Moore, though he was known on the internet as Tripz. He was scheduled to release his first studio album in 2010, but scrapped the album and became known as Skrillex, releasing his first extended play under that name the same year (the album was \"My Name is Skrillex\"). Also in 2010, Skrillex released his Grammy winning song \"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\" (which was found on the EP album of the same name), and in 2011, he released another Grammy winning song called \"Bangarang\" (on the album of the same name\". He also won an Annie award for \"Bug Hunt\", a song found on 2012's \"Wreck-It Ralph\". \n"}]}
