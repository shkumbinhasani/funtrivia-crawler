Their working relationship began in 1939 and continued until 1972 during which time they wrote, produced and directed twenty-four films,  including masterpieces such as 'Black Narcissus', 'One of Our Aircraft is Missing' and 'A Canterbury Tale'.  Although considered a directorial team, the majority of the film director's duties were performed by Powell whilst Pressburger concentrated on the screenwriting, editing and, as he was an accomplished musician, the scoring of the music for their films. Their partnership and production company were officially dissolved in 1957, but both men remained the firmest of friends until Pressburger's death in 1988 at the age of 85. \n"}, {"text": "What is the call sign of the Lancaster bomber aircraft in which David Niven's character, Squadron Leader Peter Carter, was plunging to his doom?", "correct": "'G' George", "options": ["'A' Apple", "'H' Henrietta", "'F' Florence"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'G' George.\n\n\tIt is the 2nd of May 1945 and badly damaged Lancaster 'G - George' is limping back from a raid over Germany.

He dictates a letter to his mother that he asks June to write down for him and tells June that he would like to be remembered to his sisters.  After asking June if she has a boyfriend, he then immediately tells her not to answer so as to save her any embarrassment.  He then informs June that he will be jumping but has no parachute... \r \"I could love a girl like you June; you're life and I'm leaving you\".  \r Abandoning a tearful June to her thoughts, Peter Carter makes his way to the aircraft escape hatch, says goodbye to his comrade Flying Officer Bob Trubshawe, who lies dead in the cockpit, glances around his aircraft once more before slipping through the hatch, into the clouds and to his almost certain death. \n"}, {"text": "In which non-combat role is American service-woman, June, employed?", "correct": "Radio operator", "options": ["Military secretary", "Telegraphist", "Nursing assistant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadio operator.\n\n\tJune, played by Kim Hunter, is a USAAF radio operator.  Squadron Leader Carter is washed up on a deserted beach and believes that he must be in Heaven until an RAF Mosquito aircraft thundering overhead brings the realisation that he has somehow survived and, even more surprisingly, has been washed up within a very short distance of June's billet at Leigh Wood House.

Many allied airmen are arriving and, after being registered by the Chief Recorder's team of assistants, they are issued with their wings, but it is an American aircrew who decide to grab a drink before reporting to the registration desk.

When he finally encounters the pair relaxing together amongst some Rhododendron bushes he suspends time so that he can discuss his dilemma and the future course of events - Peter's ascent to Heaven. Predictably Peter refuses and an argument ensues; Conductor 71 is promptly sent packing back to heaven empty handed! \n"}, {"text": "In life Conductor 71 was a member of an aristocratic French family.

He also admits that he hadn't said anything earlier as he was concerned that others may think that he was losing his mind. The Squadron Leader is invited to stay with Reeves to undergo observations and it is here that conductor visits him once again.

Farlan, played by actor Raymond Massey, sets out to prove that no good American could fall in love with an Englishman and especially in such a short period of time.  Later, Reeves considers the selected jury, consisting of a Frenchman, a Boer, a Russian, a Chinese, a Punjabi and an Irishman to be unfairly biased and insists that they are replaced with an all American jury, much to the surprise of Abraham Farlan. \n"}, {"text": "Whilst the ethereal Peter Carter is appearing in the Celestial Court, what is happening to his physical body?", "correct": "He is undergoing brain surgery.", "options": ["He is playing chess - it is only his spirit in the Celestial Court.", "He is sleepwalking.", "He is in the throes of a nightmare."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is undergoing brain surgery.\n\n\tReeves had determined that Peter's hallucinations were caused by an earlier, untreated head wound and that surgery was his best chance of recovery.

After accepting Reeves states that, to fight the case successfully, he will need evidence.

Doctor Reeves is convinced that the only way to prove beyond doubt that she and Peter love each other is for her to step onto the stairway and surrender her life for him. As she does so the stairway begins its ascent back to heaven but soon comes to juddering halt.  Knowing that she has proved her feelings for Peter, she rushes back down the steps to him.
