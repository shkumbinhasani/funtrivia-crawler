Jessica can't resist and she goes into the house, leading to a confrontation.

Sookie also agrees to attempt to infiltrate the Fellowship of the Sun to seek clues about Godric's whereabouts.\rAt the Fellowship of the Sun, Jason rises through the ranks and discovers the arsenal of weapons in the Newlins' house.

Following a trail of clothes, they head to a clearing to find a ritual being performed and Maryann responsible.

The next day, everyone at the ritual can't remember what happened.\r Jason finishes building a platform for the church and finds Sarah crying-- she confides in him, saying that the recruits are being trained for a war against the vampires.

Steve, meanwhile, discovers that Sookie is related to Jason and holds him at knife-point to get information out of him.  He ultimately opts to kill Jason.  Sarah finds out that Steve has attempted to kill Jason.  She decides to shoot Jason with paintballs and confront him.  When he discovers that Sookie has been taken, he decides to save her.\r Sam locates Daphne and holds her at gunpoint until she reveals that Maryann is an immortal Maenad who can control primal energies.  Maryann later comes to find Daphne and decides to use Eggs, under her control, to kill her.  Sam later finds her body in the restaurant freezer.\r Sookie discovers that Hugo is the traitor giving away the vampires and tries to convince him that there is nothing with the fellowship for him.

Lorena comes by to meet Sookie leading to a fight between the two of them.\r Sam finds Daphne's body in the freezer with its heart missing; someone has also called the cops.

He later watches over Maryann in the form of a fly.\r Eggs speaks to Tara, worried, because he's been blacking out again.  Maryann comes in and says she'll ease up on the partying.  She also offers up some food; she doesn't say she cooked Daphne's heart in a souffle as they eat more and more.\r As the night wears on at Godric's nest, the vampires are visited by Luke from the Fellowship of the Sun, who, using a makeshift explosive device, detonates himself and a pile of silver chains.  Eric saves Sookie from the blast by shielding her with his body.  Likewise, she 'saves' him by removing the silver bullets from him, drinking his blood.  This results in them also being connected, much like she and Bill already were...and it creates an attraction between them.  Go figure.  Godric, meanwhile, is called off his post as sheriff.  He apologizes for his past actions and heads to the roof to watch the sunrise (committing suicide).  Sookie stays with him until the end.\r Lafayette and Tara's mother stop at Sookie's house to take her away from Maryann.

Returning back to Bill's place they find that Hoyt's mother has been transformed by Maryann and that Sam is being hunted down.  They make a connection between the scratches on the victims' backs and the creature that Sookie was attacked by.  Using animal sacrifices and natural materials, Maryann has constructed a large structure on Sookie's lawn.\r Maryann heads to Merlotte's and forces the citizens of Bon Temps to give up Sam.  Sam, realizing, heads to Andy's motel room to create a plan.  When Arlene calls Sam for help, he arrives to find that it's a trap.  He and Andy are able to hide in the freezer.\r Sookie returns home to find the place a mess since Maryann has taken over.  Lafayette calls and tells her to leave immediately but she and Bill are met by Maryann herself.  When Sookie is grabbed she discovers that Maryann was the beast who attacked her.  Bill tries to bite Maryann but discovers that her blood is toxic to him.  When Sookie fights back, she discovers that she can repel the maenad with her touch.\r Jason arrives at Sam's bar with weapons and, somehow, is able to manage the situation.  He gets the people out of the bar by holding Arlene hostage, prompting Terry to evacuate everyone despite the mind control.  This gives them the opportunity to retrieve Sam when the freezer door opens; he goes willingly.  Outside, Jason and Andy devise a plan to pose as the god they're sacrificing to and they manage to 'smite' Sam (who transforms into a fly before their eyes).  When the ordeal ends, Sam returns and says he'll explain what happened later.\r Lafayette and Lettie Mae keep Tara tied up and when Sookie and Bill arrive, an attempt at looking into her mind is made.

Bill says that only one vampire may be able to defeat Maryann so he needs to go.

Sophie-Anne insists that Bill stay the day and he is obligated to do so.  After a great deal of impatience, Sophie hints that the only way to make the maenad go away is by making it believe that its god has arrived...though the god never really does arrive.\r While Andy and Jason go to the sheriff's office to find some firearms, Sam takes in Arlene's children who ask why he hasn't called in a vampire.  Since Sam believes that Bill is still in Dallas, he has to seek help from Eric at Fangtasia.  He decides to stop in at Sophie-Anne's just as Bill is heading out.\r Sookie and Lafayette are forced to let Tara run free and save Eggs when Lettie Mae holds them at gunpoint for the keys to her handcuffs.  This forces Lafayette to have a traumatic recollection of his previous experience with guns.  They manage to distract Lettie Mae and chase after her in the other car.  When Tara arrives, she resists Maryann but falls victim to the same mind-control.  She also says that Tara brought her forth during a ritual with the crackpot pharmacist.  Shortly after this, the mob arrives to inform Maryanne that 'he who comes' took Sam and destroyed him.  She is not thrilled that they fell for that trick.\r Sookie and Lafayette are able to breach the defenses at Sookie's house and although Sookie is able to get inside, Lafayette becomes one of Maryann's servants.

It turns out, she's going to be Maryann's maid of honor.  Maryann asks Sookie to use her powers on her again but she can't seem to bring it across.  When this happens, she tries to figure out what Sookie is.  Sookie thinks that she's marrying Sam, but it turns out that Maryann wants to marry the god she's giving Sam to.\r Sophie and Eric discuss the maenad but, more pressingly, they discuss the sale of vampire blood.  She warns him not to let Bill know that she's supplying it to him and he says he'll take care of Bill.\r Jason and Andy arrive at the 'wedding' only to turn into more members of the mob.  Bill, meanwhile, brings Sam to the main event as 'the vessel' and trades him for Sookie.  The ritual is started and Maryann has Eggs make the fatal stab into Sam's torso.  When Sookie tries to save him, he tells her to destroy the offering which she does, provoking Maryann to chase her into the woods.  Before Maryann can deal the final blow to her, she spies a horned creature, a bull emerging from the forest, and goes to meet it.  Though Maryann recognizes it as her God and husband-to-be, it gores her with its horn and transforms back into Sam, revived thanks to Bill's vampire blood.  Maryann crumbles to the ground, now mortal and dying.\r Things start to get back to normal-- some of the citizens of Bon Temps believe Maryann was an alien foreigner while others believe she planted LSD in the water supply.

When she peers into his mind, she reveals that Eggs was the one who killed for Maryann and he doesn't take the news too well.\r Sam decides to visit some faces from his past-- his adoptive parents.  His mother talks about why he was abandoned and she warns him not to seek out his real family.\r Eggs tries to force Andy to take him to prison to atone for the crimes he committed but he refuses considering the circumstances.  When Jason sees Andy being held at the end of Maryann's sacrificial knife from a distance, he shoots Eggs, killing him.  The two of them decide to cover up the crime.\r Bill, deciding to celebrate, brings Sookie to a French restaurant and proposes to her.  Shocked, she takes a moment to compose herself in the restroom and decides that she will marry him despite the tragedies of the past weeks.  When she returns to the room she finds that the table has been torn apart.  Bill is missing. \n"}]}
