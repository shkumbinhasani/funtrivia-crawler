{"id": "373082", "name": "Hard \"Show Stoppers\" Quiz / Test | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Freak Show"], "questions": [{"text": "What 1932 movie does Elsa insist on watching on her final night with her freaks?", "correct": "Freaks", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreaks.\n\n\tDriving out in the rain, Stanley arrives at the freak show just in time for a major feast; it's Elsa's going away party.  Elsa toasts Chester, the new owner of the freak show, and he gives a thankful speech of his own.  She responds asking for privacy with her freaks so that they can spend the last precious moments alone, together, and he obliges graciously.  Elsa also takes the time to thank Stanley, her manager, for all that he's done.  She asks Stanley if he's ever watched \"Freaks\", Tod Browning's 1932 film, and he says he hasn't.  He has no idea what's coming. \n"}, {"text": "When Stanley opens his gift from the freaks, what's inside?", "correct": "A decapitated head", "options": ["A mirror", "A bomb", "A confession"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA decapitated head.\n\n\tThe freaks tell Stanley about \"Freaks\" and outline a bit of the story, mainly that in the end, the villain, who tried to exploit the freaks for their inheritance, got their comeuppance.  They insist that he stay around and bring out a fascinating gift which, when he opens it, turns out to be the head of the curator of the American Museum of Morbidity in a glass jar. Stanley is immediately placed into Elsa's bullseye target and taken for a spin, and when he comes down she hits him in the leg, crippling him.  When he's told to run, he tries to turn the tables, telling the freaks that she killed Ethel, but the bloodlust is too strong. He's forced to make a run for it out in the storm, but he ends up cornered under one of the trailers with no hope. \n"}, {"text": "Where has Jimmy been hidden away?", "correct": "In an abandoned shack", "options": ["On the freak show grounds", "In a motel", "In another state"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn an abandoned shack.\n\n\tElsa and Maggie visit Jimmy in the abandoned shack where the twins were held.  Shocked by what's happened, Jimmy is angered that the freaks killed his father, but Elsa insists that he broke their code.  He's also frustrated with Maggie because of the lies she's made and initially refuses to let Maggie help him redress his wounds. Fortunately, Elsa has someone coming, an old friend, who can help with his missing hands.  When she leaves, Maggie's left alone with him and she says that she's always loved him...but he can't see past her wrongs.  She vows to make things right because she's a changed person. \n"}, {"text": "Who informs Chester that he was the one who murdered his wife?", "correct": "Marjorie", "options": ["Dandy", "Elsa", "Detective Colquitt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarjorie.\n\n\tElsa is busy yelling at her stage technicians when her special guest, Massimo Dolcefino, walks in, but the moment she sees him, she embraces him lovingly.\rThat night, Bette and Dot are reasonably worried when they see Marjorie watching them sleeping with Chester.  This ends up having ramifications, of course, because he and Marjorie have and argument about it after the fact.  Marjorie insists that the girls are using him and reminds him that she didn't kill Alice and Lucy-- she couldn't have since she's a doll.  It was he who did it.  Afraid of losing Marjorie, Chester admits that he'll need to kill the twins. \n"}, {"text": "What does Dandy give to the twins?", "correct": "Information about Chester", "options": ["A proposal of marriage", "Money", "Poison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInformation about Chester.\n\n\tThat night, the freaks look through Ethel's trailer, recalling her memory and playing cards. Having a bit to drink, they think about what Stanley said and connect the dots; with Stanley dead, Elsa's dreams of Hollywood are dashed, so it's unlikely she'll leave.  She did, however, kill one of their own, and they need to kill her in retribution for that.  They toast to this and set out to plan her murder.\rBette and Dot brush their hair and think about Chester when Dandy walks into their tent, out of friendship of course.  He informs the girls that since his mother's death, he's changed.  He wants to reach out to those who matter to him, so he extends an olive branch to them and offers up a folder containing the truth behind Chester Creb.  They refuse to read the info and kick him out, but he leaves the folder. \n"}, {"text": "Massimo murdered all of the people responsible for removing Elsa's legs.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tElsa heads back to Jimmy's shack and gives him a strong drink before introducing Massimo and injecting him with an anesthetic.  Massimo says that he's there to make him whole again, and Elsa, promising that this option is the best, reveals that she has wooden legs, as made by Massimo, the man she loved. Elsa states her regret before Massimo reveals what he did in the days after discovering her.  After her legs were made and the war was emerging in Germany, he had to make the men responsible pay, so he killed all of them...but one-- Dr. Hans Gruper.  Unfortunately, the Doctor knew of his arrival and shot him, keeping him hostage and torturing him. He only survived when a higher authority stepped in and used him to steal books.  Massimo went to America to find Elsa, but never did. \n"}, {"text": "Who is killed during Chester's magic act?", "correct": "Maggie", "options": ["Desiree", "Penny", "Bette and Dot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaggie.\n\n\tIn Elsa's absence, Chester tries to get the freaks to switch around the order of routines during the show and it's at this time that the twins state they don't want to be his magic assistants any longer (though they don't say that they've read his file).  He says that instead of taking a volunteer, he actually plans on using them as a subject for the trick, slicing them in half. They continue to refuse, so Maggie steps in to take the spot; she wants to be part of the show and make her contribution.  Chester is already fuelled by anger at this point, so it's not long before he's picturing Maggie as his ex-wife, Lucy, and Alice. Instead of getting her to perform as normal, he instead handcuffs her feet together and, without stopping, saws her in half, pulling the boxes away to reveal the murder he just committed. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Chester turn himself in to the police?", "correct": "Because he killed Marjorie", "options": ["Because of his magic trick", "Because he's an accomplice", "Because he killed his wife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause he killed Marjorie.\n\n\tChester, shocked at what he's done onstage, snaps out of it when he realizes that Marjorie has deceived him.  He heads back to his trailer to find the doll packing; they need to leave since he's killed again.  When she refuses to listen to him, he stabs her multiple times despite her pleas.  It's too late though-- he's killed her.\rChester reports the murder of a young lady, but it turns out, when he reveals the body, it's just a doll.  Finally unhinged, Chester kneels before the cops and begs to be sent to the electric chair. \n"}, {"text": "Who warns Elsa of the freaks' impending attack?", "correct": "Bette and Dot", "options": ["Desiree", "Eve", "Ethel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBette and Dot.\n\n\tDuring his first performance back in 1946, Jimmy was encouraged by his mother to go onstage and make her proud.  Now, sitting in a shack and being fed by Amazon Eve, he needs to make things right.  Eve tells him that Maggie is dead and he refuses to hear the details.  She informs him that Elsa is next...that night...but it's clear he's in no shape to do anything about it.  In fact, with new hands, he's best not to get involved since he'll have a shot at a normal life.\rBack at the freak show, Elsa rests in her tent for what will be the last time.  Bette and Dot walk in and warn her that she needs to leave; the others have been plotting revenge, but the girls owe her.  Elsa asks where she can go and the girls say anywhere but there.\rThe freaks grab their weapons and go only to find Elsa's tent vacant.\rElsa has an impromptu meeting with the only person she can: Dandy.  In a rush, she sells the freak show for $10,000 in cash and leaves Jupiter forever. \n"}, {"text": "When Dandy takes control of the freak show he finds what remains of Stanley, but where?", "correct": "In the big top tent", "options": ["In Elsa's tent", "Buried in the back", "In a glass jar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the big top tent.\n\n\tDandy pulls up to the freak show the next morning and takes inventory, informing the freaks of his purchase and letting them know that he controls their contracts.  Dandy is thrilled; being in show business has always been a dream of his, and now it's come true.  He asks Paul to fetch him a lemonade with a paper straw as he takes to the stage, finally, and blows kisses to the empty seats before taking a bow.  He is, however, distracted by a noise in the back of the big tent.  Walking back, he finds the remains of Stanley-- his limbs cut off, and dressed up like Meep.\rOn another stormy night, Massimo unveils his greatest work yet, Jimmy's new hands.  When he tries them on for the first time, he considers them perfect.  Instead of fingers, both hands reflect his original claws. \n"}]}
