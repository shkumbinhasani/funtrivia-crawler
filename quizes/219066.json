{"id": "219066", "name": "\"Super Mario 64\" Stages 10-12 Online Trivia | Super Mario 64 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Mario Games", "Super Mario 64"], "questions": [{"text": "What is not an enemy found in \"Snowman's Land\"?", "correct": "Snufit", "options": ["Money Bags", "Amp", "Fly Guy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnufit.\n\n\tSnufits are more commonly found in \"Hazy Maze Cave\".  Money Bags often contain money, but you can't see them until you go near them.  When they appear, jump on them for about four coins.  Amp is also in the level, but like always, he can't be defeated, and there is one Fly Guy usually floating around near the Amp. \n"}, {"text": "What will block the Snowman's breath when you are going for the 'Snowman's Big Head' star in \"Snowman's Land\"?", "correct": "A penguin", "options": ["A wall", "Nothing does; you use the Metal Cap", "Nothing does; you end up going around it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA penguin.\n\n\tOn the journey for the level's first star, you'll need to climb up the giant snowman in the center of the level.  When you reach the bridge in front of his face, he'll decide to blow you off, and if he's successful, you'll fly back to the start of the level (and your hat will be blown off).  To pass by the wind, hide behind the heavy, big penguin as you go across and continue your climb. \n"}, {"text": "What cap is required to retrieve a star in \"Snowman's Land\"?", "correct": "Vanish Cap", "options": ["Metal Cap", "Wing Cap", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVanish Cap.\n\n\tThe Vanish Cap is needed for the 'Into the Igloo' task.  To get into the igloo, you need to ride a Koopa Shell up a steep hill along one side of the snowman.  Once inside, you need to search the small labyrinth for the Vanish Cap, and once you put it on, you can walk through ice walls to grab the star. \n"}, {"text": "How many stars can be found 'downtown' in \"Wet-Dry World\"?", "correct": "Two & 2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo & 2.\n\n\t'Go To Town for the Red Coins' and 'Quick Race Through Downtown!' are both located downtown.  To get downtown, you need to use a cannon or climb the fence separating it from the first part of the stage.  In this area, there are many buildings, and wall which you can pass through with the Vanish Cap. \n"}, {"text": "How many secrets must you find in the 'Secrets in the Shallows & Sky' task in \"Wet-Dry World\"?", "correct": "Five", "options": ["Six", "Four", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive.\n\n\tThese secrets are found by hitting five different blocks in the level whether it be by pushing them, breaking them, or jumping into them.  Three are near the ground of the level, and two are near the top.  Once you've found them all, the star will appear near the start of the stage. \n"}, {"text": "How do you raise the water in \"Wet-Dry World\" to it's highest point?", "correct": "By jumping into the picture a certain way", "options": ["You go downtown in the level", "It all has something to do with the moon, and the tides, so you really have no control over it...", "You hit one of the Crystal Taps scattered throughout the level"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy jumping into the picture a certain way.\n\n\tBy jumping high into the picture entrance of the level (either by triple jump or backflip), you can make the water rise to its highest point.  At this point, you can still lower the water, but you can also reach the Pink Bob-omb, the cannon, and the entrance to downtown (and the final two stars of the level). \n"}, {"text": "In \"Tall, Tall Mountain\", where can you find blue coins?", "correct": "On the slide", "options": ["Near the waterfall at the bottom of the mountain", "At the top of the mountain", "On a mushroom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn the slide.\n\n\tTo access the slide, you have to find the hidden entrance in the side of a cliff wall.  This slide is much like Princess Peach's secret slide in Peach's Castle.  If you enter the slide, but lose a life, you can re-enter the level and start at the top of the slide again.  This comes in handy when trying the hundred-coin star for the level.  The slide is used to obtain star #4, 'Mysterious Mountainside'. \n"}, {"text": "How many stars do you obtain on top of a mushroom in \"Tall, Tall Mountain\"?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Three", "One", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tThe stars, 'Scary Shrooms, Red Coins', and 'Blast to the Lonely Mushroom' require that you find the star on the mushrooms.

You have to complete task #1, 'Scale the Mountain', before you can even begin task #2.  In 'Mystery of the Monkey Cage', you have to return to the top of the mountain, catch Ukkiki the Monkey twice, and then head back down to the caged star.  Ukkiki will open the cage, and you can claim the star at the bottom of the waterfall. \n"}, {"text": "How many Toads throughout Peach's Castle will give you secret stars?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "Two", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tOne is near the entrance to \"Hazy Maze Cave\", one is in the second floor of the castle (near the \"Tall, Tall Mountain\" picture), and on is on the top floor of the castle near \"Tick Tock Clock\".  These stars will be added to your secret star stash (along with other stars not found through the different stages of the game). \n"}]}
