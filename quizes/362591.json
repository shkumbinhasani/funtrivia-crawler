Cochran. Although he promoted wrestlers early in his career, Cochran went on to stage many plays, notably working with Noel Coward later in the 1920s and 1930s.

This committee included radio personality Commander Campbell and Maurice Webb MP. \r The Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules were implemented in the late 1940s and became almost universally accepted in the UK.

He wore leotards to wrestle in - the first one was made by his wife from a sofa cover! He had six children. Shirley retired in 1993 and died in 1997. It's hard to imagine anyone, let alone a Yorkshireman, with a less appropriate first name.\r Question by Invinoveritas \n"}, {"text": "Martin Ruane was a huge man who fought under an alias, wrestling for a few years as part of a tag team with Big Daddy.

The team broke up in 1977 when Big Daddy turned 'blue eye' (a goodie); Haystacks stayed a 'heel' and they maintained a continuous feud which attracted high ratings when they wrestled one another. Ruane was a devout Christian and would not wrestle on Sundays.

He retired in 1978, made a brief comeback in 1981, retired again, came back in 1988 and retired for good in 1993. \r His favourite finishing move was \"The Kamikaze Smash\" or \"Splash\", which involved somersaulting into a prone opponent's stomach from the top ring rope.

After being demobbed from the Merchant Navy at the end of the war he became a wrestler and wrestled five or six\r  times a week in gyms, back street bars and sports clubs up and down the country. He became a great audience favourite due to his ability to bring a comical aspect to his wrestling. He would often stagger around the ring, rubber legged, appearing completely punch drunk, before miraculously recovering and defeating his opponent with lightning speed. He was respected and feared in equal measure by other wrestlers, who acknowledged he was a master of his craft and one of the hardest opponents to beat.\r Question by Christinap \n"}, {"text": "Steve Logan was the first wrestler to win which British title when, in 1975, it was revived after being dormant for some years?", "correct": "British Middleweight Champion", "options": ["British Heavyweight Champion", "British King of the Ring", "British Freestyle Wrestling Champion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBritish Middleweight Champion.\n\n\tAs well as appearing solo, Steve Logan also often partnered Mick McManus in tag team matches.
