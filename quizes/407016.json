The series was a prequel to the movie and was about Ariel's underwater adventures with Flounder, Sebastian, and the others.

The three main characters were brothers Yakko and Wakko and their sister Dot Warner. There were many other characters as well, including Chicken Boo was one of them. He was a chicken who tried to pass himself off as a man. His theme was \"Chicken Boo, what's the matter with you? You don't act like the other chickens do. You wear a disguise to look like human guys. But you're not a man; you're a Chicken Boo.\" Another favorite character of mine was a little girl named Mindy who always got her dog, Buttons, in trouble. She called her mom \"Lady,\" and her catchphrase was \"Okay. Love you. Bye-bye.\"\r The show did a lot of parodies of things, such as \"West Side Story\" using the characters on the show. Yakko sometimes did educational musical numbers such as \"State Capitals,\" where he sang all United States state capitals. \r Another major part of this show was a sketch called \"Pinky and The Brain.\" In every episode, Pinky would say something along the lines of \"What are we going to  do today?\" And The Brain would reply, \"Same thing we do every day, try and take over the world.\" And each time, they would fail. \n"}, {"text": "In 1995, two characters from \"The Lion King\" got their own series.
