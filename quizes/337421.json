Can you tell me which word I have misused?", "correct": "than & then", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nthan & then.\n\n\tWhen I said \"every now and than\", \"than\" was incorrectly spelled.

That is denoting a specific time, so it's a \"when\".\r Hopefully that trick will help you if you ever find yourself unsure of which one to use. \n"}]}
