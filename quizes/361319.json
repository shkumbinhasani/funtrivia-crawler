Fortunately it has a real name.  What race received particular notice not only after one man won the competition seven consecutive times, but admitted to doping afterwards and was, subsequently, stripped of the title?", "correct": "Tour de France", "options": ["Volta a Catalunya", "Amstel Gold Race", "Giro di Lombardia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTour de France.\n\n\tThe Tour de France was first held in 1903 and has only been interrupted by the two World Wars.  In many cases, its winners have gone on to victory multiple times in succession; it has been won the most by French-born cyclists.  However, between 1998 and 2005, American-born Lance Armstrong, who later founded the LiveStrong brand to raise cancer awareness, cycled into the lead winning a lucky seven times (surpassing four other racers with five wins).  In 2012, after admitting to doping during each of his races, he was stripped of the titles and lost support from his sponsors.\r The Tour de France, nonetheless, is an annual event occurring during the summer.  The race rides over the course of three weeks and is part of the Grand Tours (including Giro d'Italia in Italy and Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a in Spain).  It most often ends in Paris nearly two thousand miles later. \n"}, {"text": "The moon passes through all lunar phases over the course of approximately 29 days.  After which of these phases is the moon 'waxing'?", "correct": "New Moon", "options": ["High Noon", "Full Moon", "Harvest Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Moon.\n\n\tA New Moon is present when sunlight is completely blocked by the moon itself, sheathing the moon in complete shadow as it passes across the sky.  For the first phase following this, the moon is considered waxing during which, depending on the Hemisphere, one side of the satellite will begin revealing itself. Fourteen days later, the moon will be full again as sunlight will strike the face aimed towards Earth.  The period following this as the moon begins to go dark is considered 'waning'.  During a lunar month, half of the moon will always be lit at any given time; a period of nearly fifteen days will pass before a spot sees sunlight again. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not part of the Hydrologic Cycle, a process performed by water all around the planet at all times?", "correct": "Freezing", "options": ["Condensation", "Precipitation", "Evaporation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreezing.\n\n\tThough the Hydrologic Cycle consists of several different phases, the main gist of the naturally-occurring phenomenon involves water vapor rising from the ground and then condensing in the sky to form clouds, then falling to the ground again as precipitation, whether that be snow or rain.  This process important for all life on the planet, factoring into the sustainability of ecosystems and the growth of life as a whole. At the same time, however, human interference through pollution and industrialization has had a severe effect on the cycle, causing issues such as acid rain and global warming. \n"}, {"text": "The image of Ouroboros is typically that of a creature doing what?", "correct": "Eating itself", "options": ["Forming a figure-eight", "Shooting fire into the air", "Emerging from a volcano"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEating itself.\n\n\tOuroboros is a fairly loaded motif appearing as far back as Ancient Egypt.  Symbolizing the ring-like nature of time--birth and death and possible reincarnation--the Ouroboros is usually a snake or dragon and it forms a loop by devouring itself.  In ancient alchemist circles, the Ouroboros symbolized wholeness because in itself it depicted an entirety of process, eternal sustenance and persistence of time.  The figure has been used frequently in anime, art, and science fiction. \n"}, {"text": "A normal human sleep cycle consists of both REM and what other phase in which dreaming does not typically occur?", "correct": "NREM", "options": ["CDMA", "REMX", "CATNAP"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNREM.\n\n\tWhile REM consists of Rapid Eye Movement and occurs repeatedly throughout a good night's sleep, NREM involves a few different sub-stages in which involuntary eye movements do not occur.  During this time the sleeper typically does not dream; the sleeper cycles through three phases of NREM before falling into REM for a short time and restarting the process.  REM, however, gets longer with each passing cycle until morning.  NREM, of course, stands for Non-Rapid Eye Movement and it usually consists of your deeper sleep. \n"}, {"text": "Every year, Earth tilts on its axis creating different seasonal effects in the North and South Hemispheres.  What term is used to describe the event occurring twice a year in which all parts of Earth's surface experience the same amount of natural light in a single day?", "correct": "Equinox", "options": ["Solstice", "Eclipse", "Declination"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEquinox.\n\n\tAn equinox occurs twice a year, once in March and once in September, and in both cases the Earth is tilted directly even with the sun, giving even distribution of light across an entire hemisphere--both the north and the south receive the same amount of sunlight for an entire day.  Adversely, the points at which the certain hemispheres encounter their shortest or longest days of the year are referred to as summer and winter solstice, and they occur in June and December respectively. In this case, the Earth is tilted on its axis at a maximum angle, greatly increasing sun exposure on one side and minimizing the length of a day of sunlight on the other. \n"}, {"text": "You can time your watch to this one:  what famous geyser in the United States erupts in a plume of scalding water once every ninety-one minutes?", "correct": "Old Faithful", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOld Faithful.\n\n\tFound in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Old Faithful, as the name suggests, is a landmark one can set his or her watch to.  Once nearly every hour and a half, the geyser, Yellowstone's most famous in the Norris Geyser Basin, shoots upwards for anywhere between one and five minutes at a height of over thirty feet (though it has reached higher than fifty on occasion).  Old Faithful isn't the tallest in the park though--that title goes to the Steamboat Geyser, also in Yellowstone.  The catch is, you don't necessarily know when that one'll erupt--Old Faithful blows its top on time. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these flowers is considered a perennial, which blooms and blossoms recurring every year, as opposed to an annual, which only survives for a single growing season?", "correct": "Daffodil", "options": ["Marigold", "Snapdragon", "Petunia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaffodil.\n\n\tThere are many different flowers out there in the world but only some of them come back for more with each passing year.  Annual flowers, despite their name, only flower once in their lifetime-- this can range from typical vegetables like corn and lettuce to garden flowers like snapdragons and zinnia.  Likewise, the biennial plant grows for two years before its lifecycle comes to an end, only blossoming in the second year (eg. onions).  Perennials, however, grow once per year until the bulb or seed is compromised. Daffodils, for instance, once planted, will flower every spring provided the weather is warm enough to facilitate growth. When the flower dies, the bulb remains dormant until the ground thaws and recommences harvesting nutrients.  Other perennials include irises, catmint, and peonies; some can grow in spring, some wait until summer, and a few even wait until fall to flourish. \n"}, {"text": "What mythical bird creature, when old enough to die, is reborn in the ashes of its former corpse?", "correct": "Phoenix", "options": ["Roc", "Cockatrice", "Tengu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhoenix.\n\n\tAnother cyclical creature, the phoenix symbolizes rebirth and eternity.  On one hand, the bird is an embodiment of ever-burning light and fire as a powerful creature tied to historical, religious, and mythological belief.  On the other, when the bird's life is snuffed out, it rises from the ashes to live again, symbolizing reincarnation. Phoenixes thus represent a great deal of themes from immortality to Christian resurrection to time itself.  Their presence has been seen in several forms of media from the \"Harry Potter\" series to \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", a Stravinsky orchestral piece, and the music videos of Lady Gaga and Kanye West. \n"}, {"text": "Every four years you can count on there being a leap year.  In what month of a leap year do we gain an extra day?", "correct": "February", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFebruary.\n\n\tLeap years, as opposed to common years, have a twenty-ninth day in February instead of just twenty-eight in total.  Why?  Well, it's mainly because life isn't perfect on Earth--although it takes approximately 365 days to complete one orbit around the sun, it's actually slightly more than that by a fraction of a day. Thus, an additional day is added every fourth year except when said year is a centennial year (eg. 1800, 1900, etc.), and only if that centennial is not divisible by 400 (eg. 1600, 2000, etc.).  While not all calendars follow this, the Gregorian calendar (upon which many different industries run) includes the exception. \n"}]}
