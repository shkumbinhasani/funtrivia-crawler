{"id": "332004", "name": "\"Funk\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Vocal Adrenaline taunts New Directions with a performance of what Queen song?", "correct": "Another One Bites the Dust", "options": ["Bohemian Rhapsody", "Somebody to Love", "Killer Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnother One Bites the Dust.\n\n\tThe Glee kids of McKinley High are somewhat eager to go to Regionals considering how well they're doing...that is until Rachel informs them that there's a major issue.  When they head to the auditorium, the Glee club from Carmel High School, Vocal Adrenaline, decides to one-up them before the competition even begins. To start, Jesse decides to let New Directions know that he has transferred back to Vocal Adrenaline because of the way he's been treated.  They then decide to demonstrate their performance of Queen's \"Another One Bites the Dust\" to frighten the McKinley kids.  Rachel is very much put off by Jesse's deception and the rest of the club recognizes this as Carmel High tradition to psych out the competition (called a 'funkification' since Carmel shows what they can do and the other teams go into a deep funk).  When they head to the choir room however, they realize that the place has been covered with toilet paper. \n"}, {"text": "Who let Vocal Adrenaline into the McKinley auditorium?", "correct": "Sue", "options": ["Principal Figgins", "Jesse", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSue.\n\n\tWhile the kids and Mr. Schuester clean up, Sue reveals that she let Vocal Adrenaline in to do a sound check over the weekend.  This isn't surprising.  What is, on the other hand, is that Sue has plans to knock out a part of the choir room's wall to place her prospective first place trophy inside for when she wins the Cheerleading Nationals.  She also figures that when the kids lose at Regionals, she'll make the choir room an annex for her trophies.  While Sue tells the kids that they have odds of 40-1 against at Regionals, Will destroys one of her trophies.  She doesn't mind though; after all, the room is probably going to her.\rThat evening, Will and Terri sign off on their divorce papers making their separation final.  Terri leaves with a final kiss and the affirmation that Will will always be that 16-year-old boy she fell in love with. \n"}, {"text": "Puck and Finn get in trouble for doing which of these things?", "correct": "Slashing the tires of Vocal Adrenaline's members' cars", "options": ["Kidnapping Jesse and holding him hostage before the competition", "Stealing Carmel High School's statue", "TP-ing Vocal Adrenaline's choir room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlashing the tires of Vocal Adrenaline's members' cars.\n\n\tWill comes into Glee Club to talk to the kids about regrets, and while many of the kids have their regrets, Will openly tells them that he just finalized his divorce and that he regrets living in a relationship that just wasn't working.  He also says that win or lose, New Directions will regret it if Vocal Adrenaline gets the best of them before the competition. Will suggests stealing Carmel High's school statue, but Kurt says that they can't as it's a three-ton great white shark eating a seal pup.  Will suggests that they find a cooler way of one-upping the other team, but Finn and Puck both realize that desperate times call for desperate measures (despite their remaining anger towards each other over Quinn's pregnancy).  They decide to slash the tires of all of Vocal Adrenaline's Range Rovers. They get caught, however, and face punishment in Principal Figgins' office.  While Figgins and Sue suggest expulsion, Shelby simply wants them to pay for the damages.  Finn agrees that he and Puck can get jobs to pay up for what they did. \n"}, {"text": "Who is it that triggers Will's idea to get back at Sue through a seductive song and dance?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Jesse", "Puck", "Terri"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tWill speaks to the last Glee Club director, Sandy Ryerson, about purchasing marijuana to deal with his depression, but Sandy refuses to give it to him.  Instead, they discuss what can be done about raising the spirits of the New Directions kids and beating Vocal Adrenaline.  Sandy says that Carmel High has one weakness.  In the choir room, Will informs the kids that funk is, in fact, that weakness as their rivals tend to act like a singing and dancing machine omitting any sense of emotion in their performances.  As such, Vocal Adrenaline has never performed a funk number.  While Mercedes immediately volunteers to bring funk to the club, Quinn decides that she wants a chance to express her soulfulness and anger.\rWill speaks to Rachel in his office about her relationship with Jesse.  While she prattles on about Vocal Adrenaline's supposed motives in this event, Will discovers how to get himself out of his funk: by defeating his other nemesis, Sue.  To do this, he decides to invite Sue into the choir room after hours, shower her with compliments, and seduce her with a performance of \"Tell Me Something Good\" by Rufus and Chaka Khan. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Puck and Finn get jobs?", "correct": "Sheets 'N' Things", "options": ["Breadsticks", "Hummel Auto", "McKinley High School"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheets 'N' Things.\n\n\tIt turns out that Puck and Finn are able to get jobs at Sheets 'N' Things where Will's ex-wife, Terri, happens to be aiming for the manager position.  She claims that she hired them on to boost her quarterly sales and since they work for less than immigrants, they were perfect.  When her coworker, Howard, comes over to say that Sandy has entered the store, she says that he must be attended to as he's their best customer. Puck and Finn get stuck serving Sandy's outrageous requests, but when Puck heads to the stereo to crank up Sandy's Kenny G, he ends up putting on Beck's \"Loser\" to which they and the staff and customers of the store perform. Terri turns down the music so that everyone can get back to work.  While she sends Puck off to re-stack space heaters, she helps Finn fold shams since he reminds her of Will. \n"}, {"text": "What is Sue's favourite flavour of Carbo Gels (which Will purchases for her)?", "correct": "Appletini", "options": ["Chocolate monkey", "Strawberry daiquiri", "Pina colada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAppletini.\n\n\tWhile Sue writes in her journal about finding love in Will Schuester, he comes into her office with flowers to match her tracksuit and a canister of appletini-flavoured Carbo Gels, her favourite.  Will says that his divorce has opened his eyes to possibilities, and that he realized that what he truly wants is Sue.  With her cheerleading national championship approaching on the weekend, he invites her out to dinner on the Wednesday at Breadsticks.\rAt Sheets 'N' Things, Finn says that he's confused about folding shams and that he needs to focus on Glee and beating Vocal Adrenaline.  Terri gets frustrated since Glee also contributed to the destruction of her marriage.  She decides to break out of her funk by helping with Finn's assignment.  They immediately head to the store's computer to go onto iTunes and search the word 'Funk'.  She also promotes Finn to Assistant Assistant Manager and leaves Howard to clean up. \n"}, {"text": "Quinn, while performing \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\", does so on stage.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tQuinn commences New Directions' funk numbers with a song she picked to emphasize her anger at being pregnant.  Although the song is kind of awkward, she is backed by several pregnant teens (who call themselves 'The Unwed Mothers Connection') and she sings James Brown's \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" in the choir room.  The others realize her pain and comfort her after the song is finished though it's still a weird performance because of the back-up dancers...\rSue shows up at Breadsticks on Wednesday in a clean, red tracksuit and pearls.  Will doesn't.  The waitress informs Sue that she's been stood up.  Sue finds Will at his apartment and storms in, furious at him for the humiliation.  Will says he got revenge because she meddled in his relationship with Terri and tried to sabotage New Directions.  In addition, she's mean to the kids (to which she replies that she's mean to everyone), so this is a taste of her own medicine.\rThe next few days, Will realizes the consequences.  Sue hasn't come to school, so the Cheerios are left without an aim.  Kurt explains that he's fine, but many of the Cheerios don't know what to do.  While he has Glee Club, the other Cheerios need the scholarships from cheerleading; without Sue they're doomed at Nationals. \n"}, {"text": "Finn and Puck perform \"Good Vibrations\" with which member of New Directions?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Rachel", "Artie", "Santana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tIn their response to a funk number, Finn and Puck bring forth \"Good Vibrations\" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch (featuring Loleatta Holloway).  While they perform this song and show off their moves for the Glee Club, Will informs them that the song isn't necessarily funk- it just has 'funk' in the band name.  Artie explains everyone's dismay: they can't even get the genre of their songs right...they must be in a deep funk.\rMercedes apologizes to Quinn for her reaction to her song choice.  Quinn apologizes too because she never realized how it felt to be such an outsider, criticized because of her looks.  Mercedes informs Quinn that she spoke to her mother, and since they have an extra room, she can stay with them with her baby (so that she doesn't need to stay at Puck's). \n"}, {"text": "Does Sue win Nationals?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWill goes to Sue's trophy-laden house to be let in by Sue's Mexican housekeeper.  It turns out that Sue hasn't left her bed or even taken a protein shake since she got home from her humiliation.  Will tries to talk sense into her stating that while the kids are scared of her temperament, they need her and she needs them because she does love them.  With this clear indication of love in her life, Sue is convinced and decides to get out of her house and back to the school.  Will also apologizes for his actions; what he thought would get him out of his funk was horrible, not only hurting himself but other people as well.\rOn the weekend, Sue brings the Cheerios to a SIXTH consecutive National Championship victory (partly because she gave Kurt a fourteen and a half minute Celine Dion medley entirely in French).  While Will watches the recorded taping of the event from home, Sue arrives in his apartment with the trophy and gives him a choice: he can either allow for her trophy case to be built in the choir room or he can kiss her (with tongue) right there, right now.  As he leans in close, she decides to take back the option since his breath reeks of failure.  As a constant reminder of what he did for revenge, a bulletproof trophy case is installed. \n"}, {"text": "What do the Vocal Adrenaline members do to Rachel to force New Directions to perform a funk number in the end of the episode?", "correct": "Throw eggs at her", "options": ["Hand out demeaning and untrue flyers about her at McKinley", "Blacklist her name at the community theater", "Spread gossip about her on the internet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThrow eggs at her.\n\n\tRachel receives a call from Jesse asking to meet him in the McKinley parking lot.  Excited, she heads outside but finds herself ambushed by Vocal Adrenaline who decide to pelt eggs at her.  They all encourage Jesse to do the same and Rachel urges him onwards.  He does, cracking his egg on her forehead.  The guys in New Directions decide to exact their revenge on their rivals, but Will stops them at the door claiming that harmful revenge is not the answer.  Will uses Rachel's phone to contact Jesse and he invites Vocal Adrenaline to the McKinley auditorium on Friday.\rWhen they arrive, the kids surprise Vocal Adrenaline with a true funk number: \"Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)\" by Parliament.  When the kids show off their emotion in a fun performance, Vocal Adrenaline is left awestruck...they've never been able to pull off a funk number.  They're soulless automatons. \n"}]}
