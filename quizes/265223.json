Their franchise was one of eight teams in the new American League in 1901.  What was the team's first name?", "correct": "Washington Senators", "options": ["St. Louis Perfectos", "Providence Grays", "Cleveland Spiders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWashington Senators.\n\n\tThe other teams were all National League teams.  The Senators began their history in 1901 by posting a 61-73 record under manager Jim Manning for a sixth place finish.  That was Manning's only season of managing. \n"}, {"text": "The franchise saw their first World Series with the tremendous help of a pitcher by the name of Walter Johnson.  Which year did they not only appear in it, but win it all?", "correct": "1924", "options": ["1877", "1892", "1970"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1924.\n\n\tWalter Johnson didn't play in any of the other seasons listed.  In Johnson's 18th season in Major League baseball in 1924, he went 23-7, winning his second AL MVP and third Triple Crown.  What an amazing feat in itself, and not to mention him being 36-years old at the time.  Although winning only one game in that World Series in 1924, Walter struck out 20 New York Giants in 24 innings. The Senators won the series, four games to three.  Johnson and the Senators went to the World Series the following season in 1925, but lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates.

The Twins and the NFL Vikings shared the stadium. \n"}, {"text": "In 1965, manager Sam Mele took the Twins' ballclub to their first World Series but lost to the Dodgers.

Kelly took the Twins to two World Series under his tenure, in 1987 and 1991.  After 16 seasons in Minnesota, Kelly retired from the game in 2001.  The Twins were the only team that he had ever managed.

Kaat went 25-13 with over 200 strikeouts, but was overshadowed by virtually every Baltimore Oriole player, because Baltimore went on to skunk the Dodgers in the World Series.  That was Jim's first of three 20-game seasons in his career (only one as a Twin).  He retired in 1983 after 25 seasons.  Walter Johnson won over 30 games in a season twice. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the franchise's first Cy Young award winner?", "correct": "Jim Perry", "options": ["Johan Santana", "Frank Viola", "Walter Johnson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJim Perry.\n\n\tThe Cy Young award began in 1956, long after the retirement of Walter Johnson.  Santana won his first Cy Young award in 2004.  Viola won the award in 1988, but it was Perry that went 24-12 in 1970, who was the franchise's first.  In the 1970 Cy Young balloting, the top four were only 11 points apart.  The finish was Perry with 55, Dave McNally of the Orioles with 47, Sam McDowell of the Indians with 45, and Mike Cuellar of the Orioles with 44.

Johnson won three Triple Crowns in his career.  In 1913, his Triple Crown also brought him the AL MVP award, then he won another triple in 1918, but unfortunately, no MVP was awarded due to WWI.  His third Triple Crown came in 1924, and with that came another MVP, and also the first World Series title that the franchise had won.
