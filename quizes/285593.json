It was directed by David Hand and written by Felix Salten (the novel), Larry Morey (the story adaptation) and Perce Pearce (the story direction). It is a wonderful story of the adventures of a fawn named Bambi, and his friends Thumper, Flower, Friend Owl and Faline. The film shows exquisite animation through the journey of Bambi as he grows up, falls in love and becomes a strong buck. There are heartbreaking events and heartwarming scenes throughout the movie.\r Thumper says this wonderful quote to Bambi, as they discover the frozen pond. Thumper pounds his foot on the ice and wiggles his little nose as he coaxes Bambi to step foot on the ice. Bambi slides and wobbles. His unsteady legs go every which way. Eventually, Thumper gets Bambi back on his feet and pushes him along the ice. This is when Bambi see Faline, the immediate love of his life.\r Quoted by Funnytrivianna \n"}, {"text": "\"Six feet three and a half inches.

Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) is talking to Marvin Wilson (Jesse White), who is a sanitarium orderly, and Miss Kelly (Peggy Dow), who is a nurse, in the sanitarium after Elwood's sister, Vita Louise Simmons, has a disastrous party as a result of Elwood arriving with Harvey (his invisible rabbit friend). She decides that Elwood should be committed to a mental institution. James Stewart made the comment because Miss Kelly was discussing that Elwood had been brought into the hospital because he went to the garden party with Harvey.\rInterestingly, James Stewart was six feet four inches tall and spent the entire movie looking 'up' whenever he was speaking to Harvey.\r Quoted by MarchHare007 \n"}, {"text": "\"What's the most you've ever lost in a coin toss?\"\n\nAnton Chigurh utters this chilling line in the 2007 film adaptation of which Cormac McCarthy novel?", "correct": "No Country for Old Men", "options": ["Ocean's Thirteen", "Fargo", "The Road"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo Country for Old Men.\n\n\tJavier Bardem's portrayal of the sociopath, Anton Chigurh in the 2007 Best Picture film, \"No Country for Old Men\" won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.\rEarly in the film, Chigurh asks this question of a gas station owner in southern Texas, telling the man to call the flip of his quarter.  The man says that he didn't bet anything with which to call the coin, but Chigurh states that he's been putting the stake up his whole life.  The man calls the coin correctly and receives his lucky quarter as the prize.  Chigurh tells the man not to put it into his pocket with his other loose change because it's his lucky quarter.  Tossing it with the rest turns it into just another coin.\rLater on, Chigurh gives the same chance to Carla Jean Moss (portrayed by Kelly MacDonald) and she calls Chigurh on the situation instead saying that he's the one who has the choice, and not the one who calls heads or tails on the coin.\r The film, in question, involves a drug trade gone wrong.  After one man finds a case containing millions of dollars, he fights to keep it for himself, but finds others after it as well.

The full quote, said to Shrek, the ogre is, 'We'll stay up late swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles!' Not surprisingly, Shrek wasn't impressed.\rThis film was released in 2001 and it won the very first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film in the same year.  The story takes viewers to a fairy tale setting where an 'evil' ogre, Shrek, must save and protect Princess Fiona and deliver her to the antagonist, Lord Farquaad.  In the particular scene from which the quote is pulled, Shrek has saved Donkey early on in the movie, and Donkey is looking to Shrek to be his friend.

Harry points his .44 Magnum in the gunman's face and dares him to shoot, saying \"Go ahead, make my day!\" He uses the same phrase at the end of the movie, speaking to a man who is going to rape a woman.\rClint Eastwood made many western movies. Following these, he made five \"Dirty Harry\" movies beginning in 1971 and moving into the early 80s. The movies were about a reckless cop in San Francisco, stopping at nothing to bring down criminals.

Things are going to start happening to me now.\" Sadly, the sniper picks Naven randomly from the phone book as his victim. The 1979 film, \"The Jerk\", is a very funny film where Steve Martin is raised by a poor black family and decides he is going to make something of himself.\rIn this scene, Navin R. Johnson is working at a gas station. A sniper is shooting at him, but misses and hits some oil cans. Navin exclaims aloud \"He hates these cans, stay away from these cans.\"\r Quoted by Fredfrank \n"}, {"text": "\"I never told you, but you sound a little like Dr. Seuss when you're drunk\".\n\nThis is said by Anna Crowe to her husband Dr. Malcolm Crowe.

The quote is referring to the way Malcolm's voice sounds unstable and out-of-it when he is drunk, kind of like Dr. Seuss's voice. Malcolm and Anna are having a romantic evening in their room when they realize they're not alone. Malcolm is shot and the movie starts off with Malcolm trying to help Cole (Haley Joel Osment) sort out his issues with 'dead people'. Malcolm is portrayed by Bruce Willis, and the film was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.\r Quoted by Rightiam \n"}, {"text": "\"You're spoiled, vengeful and bloody!

She is angry because Henry has refused her permission to marry Lord Percy, son of the Duke of Northumberland, because he wants her for himself.\r\"Anne of the Thousand Days\" is the love story of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII of England. It is a story that changed England forever.

The film, released in 1986, was as great, if not better, than the original as Ripley returns to the alien planet in order to save a colony who has lost contact with Earth.  Something is amiss.  When they arrive, the only survivor of the alien attack, Newt, is found inside the building.  Ripley goes to extreme lengths to save Newt from the various pitfalls and setbacks of the horrible alien planet, including making a solo trip into the alien queen's lair to save the girl.  The quote in question was mentioned by Newt as the survivors of the initial attack (once they first arrive) try to escape the building and depart in their shuttle.  However, the aliens get there first, kill the pilot, and cause the shuttle to come crashing to the ground.  Newt warns the others: \"We'd better get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon, and they mostly come at night... mostly.\"\rIronically, this serious line, which shows the hopeless isolation of the group, has been parodied on various TV shows and movies due to its popularity.\r Quoted by Kyleisalive \n"}]}
