{"id": "245903", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Carry On, Hawkeye' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "The personnel at the 4077th are catching the flu one by one.  Is Trapper the first 'M*A*S*H' doctor to be bedridden by this mini-epidemic?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAt the beginning of the episode, Hawkeye is shown feeding Trapper some oatmeal, or a substance that looks a lot like oatmeal.  Trapper remains ill throughout the episode, and is unable to assist Hawkeye in surgery despite attempts to bring himself to his feet.\r Trapper is soon followed by Henry and Frank, both of whom are also essentially bedridden throughout the episode. \n"}, {"text": "In the opening scene, Hawkeye introduces himself to the 'newest' nurse at the 4077th.  Played by Lynette Mettey, what is the name of this fresh nurse at our favorite M*A*S*H unit?", "correct": "Sheila Anderson", "options": ["Meredith Vauxhall", "Mary Wittington", "Theresa Franklin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheila Anderson.\n\n\tThe odd thing about this scene is that he is talking to Lynette Mettey, an actress who had already made several previous appearances on 'M*A*S*H', most recently in the season one episode 'Cease Fire', aired just eight months prior.  Mettey was known as Lt. Nancy Griffin during season one.  In two later episodes she would also appear under different names, namely Nurse Baker and Nurse Able.  'M*A*S*H' was notorious for this musical chairs game with the names of its nurses. \n"}, {"text": "With a number of personnel already stricken with influenza, Hawkeye is becoming desperate.  He talks with a general about getting another surgeon at the 4077th.  What historical figure does he reference when asking for someone who is 'good with a knife'?", "correct": "Jack the Ripper", "options": ["Attila the Hun", "Alexander the Great", "Napoleon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack the Ripper.\n\n\tDespite Hawkeye's desperate plea, he seems to be unable to convince this general of the importance of his request.  A new surgeon will be arriving, but 'not for days'. \n"}, {"text": "Among those who assist Hawkeye in surgery during this episode are both Father Mulcahy and Radar.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy seems rather able in the O.R., though we only really see him controlling the bleeding of a wounded soldier.  Radar finally arrives in the O.R. rather late in the episode, and quite against his will.  Oddly enough, Hawkeye has Mulcahy and Radar help rather than Nurse Kellye, who is assigned simply to put latex gloves on the surgical personnel. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye makes a power grab in this episode, asserting himself as the new commanding officer at the 4077th.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMargaret insists that she is in charge of the unit, with Hawkeye in complete agreement.  However, Hawkeye is in charge in the operating room, which is nothing new since he is already chief surgeon.  Margaret shines as the C.O., and Hawkeye is impressed enough with her overall performance to call her a 'nurse, friend and overall good egg'. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret suggests that she and Hawkeye take experimental flu shots.  Where does a skeptical Hawkeye receive his flu shot?", "correct": "Rear end", "options": ["Arm", "Abdomen", "Leg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRear end.\n\n\tWhile Margaret takes her flu shot in the standard place, her arm, Hawkeye insists that he wants his flu shot in his 'tushy'.  'You're rally enjoying this, aren't you?' Margaret asks, to which Hawkeye quickly retorts, 'Aren't you?'  Most amusingly, Radar walks in while Hawkeye is just about to get his shot, and his completely mortified.  'Excuse me, I'm sorry,' says Radar on his way out, prompting Hawkeye to laugh heartily. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye chats with a still-sick Trapper about potential replacement surgeons for the 4077th.  Among those who potentially could help are a gynecologist and what type of practitioner?", "correct": "Veterinarian", "options": ["Podiatrist", "Plastic surgeon", "Psychiatrist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVeterinarian.\n\n\tApparently, the pickings aren't good when it comes to getting a replacement surgeon.  It does seem that the 4077th never has a problem in the future with getting replacement surgeons, only when the plot of a particular episode necessitates it! \n"}, {"text": "Margaret leans over the bed of a delusional Frank, attempting to comfort her dear Ferret Face while he is ill.  Frank calls Margaret 'Nancy' during their conversation.  Who is this Nancy?", "correct": "Frank's receptionist", "options": ["Frank's mother", "Frank's next door neighbor", "Frank's high school sweetheart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank's receptionist.\n\n\tIt appears that Margaret is not the only woman that Frank has fooled around with.  'Goodbye, Nancy.  You're the best receptionist I ever had,' he says to a dumbfounded Hot Lips.  When Margaret protests, Frank follows this up with, 'Honestly Louise, we had to work late!'  Frank is having a conversation with two women in one! \n"}, {"text": "Does Margaret ever appear to get sick during this episode?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tMargaret is a rock, she never gets sick.  Perhaps the flu shot she took worked on her. \n"}, {"text": "Does Hawkeye ever fall ill with the flu during this episode?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tHawkeye finally succumbs by the end of the episode, but not before delivering the following line to Margaret: 'You know all those rotten things I've said to you, all those nasty little tricks I've played on you?  I'd like to get well and do them all over again.'\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
