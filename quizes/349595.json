{"id": "349595", "name": "Marvel's \"The Avengers\" Multiple Choice Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", " The Avengers"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the following Avengers from the comics is not in the movie?", "correct": "The Wasp", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Black Widow", "Captain America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wasp.\n\n\tThe Wasp, even though she is a founding member in the comics, is not in the film.\r The first appearance of Captain America within the movie is in a gym.  It has been decked out to resemble a 1940's training facility to give Steve Rogers a small piece of home.  In this scene he is also pretty tough on the heavy bags as he breaks one off of its chain. \r Hawkeye is the first Avenger we see in the movie.  Unfortunately, he uses his screen time to get brainwashed by Loki and doesn't officially join the rest of the group until there is only about 40 minutes left in the film.\r Black Widow is first seen as being held prisoner.  They think they are interrogating her when, in fact, she is interrogating them.  Once she hears Hawkeye is in trouble she decimates the criminals and moves on to her next mission. \n"}, {"text": "What is Agent Coulson's first name?", "correct": "Phil", "options": ["Steven", "John", "Cal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhil.\n\n\tAgent Coulson is seen in many of the films leading up to the \"Avengers\".  It isn't until the \"Avengers\" where his name really stands out and provides the impetus for a funny line in the film.  Agent Coulson walks into Stark Tower and Pepper calls out, \"Phil! Come in,\" and Tony Stark replies, \"Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.\" \n"}, {"text": "When Loki is locked up in the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, who gets him to reveal that he is planning to get Banner to change into the Hulk and destroy the ship from within?", "correct": "Black Widow", "options": ["Thor", "Iron Man", "Nick Fury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack Widow.\n\n\tBlack Widow manipulates Loki into revealing that he is planning on triggering Bruce Banner to turn into the Hulk.  She gets him to do this by making him think he's got the upper hand in a conversation the two of them are having about Hawkeye.  He thinks she is being an emotional woman when instead she is lowering his guard by faking sadness and extracting information from him. \n"}, {"text": "Which Avenger's girlfriend makes an appearance in the film that isn't just a quick picture or a flashback to one of their solo movies?", "correct": "Pepper Potts (Iron Man)", "options": ["Jane Foster (Thor)", "Betty Ross (Hulk)", "Peggy Carter (Captain America)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPepper Potts (Iron Man).\n\n\tThis is the first time we actually get to see Pepper and Tony as an actual couple.  In the first two \"Iron Man\" movies she is his friend and confidant but they seemed to shy away from being more.  However, in the \"Avengers\" it is clear they have become a full blown couple. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the blue glowing square that Loki uses as a weapon?", "correct": "The Tesseract", "options": ["The Infinity Gem", "The Soulstone", "The Forever Cube"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Tesseract.\n\n\tThe Tesseract is seen briefly at the end of Thor, in the scene after the credits.  However, it takes a much bigger role in the Captain America movie where HYDRA plans to use its power for world domination.  In the \"Avengers\" it is used to open a rift in space where the invading army comes through and a part of it's tremendous energy is also used to power Loki's staff. \n"}, {"text": "When Iron Man is struck by Thor's lightning what happens?", "correct": "It super charges his armor up to 400%.", "options": ["Tony Stark's chest piece gives out and he goes into cardiac arrest.", "It is deflected and strikes Captain America.", "His suit shuts down and he is trapped in his own armor."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt super charges his armor up to 400%.\n\n\tThis super charged armor helps Tony go toe-to-toe with the Thunder God until Captain America breaks it up.  Thor, however, doesn't just give up because Captain America says so and gives Cap's shield one good whack with his hammer causing a shock wave that levels many of the trees around them. \n"}, {"text": "When the Avengers are in the streets of New York Captain America starts issuing orders.  What are his orders to the Hulk?", "correct": "Smash", "options": ["Throw a nuclear bomb into the rift in space.", "Destroy the force field surrounding the machine that is keeping the hole open.", "Turn back into Banner and help Tony reinitialize his armor."], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmash.\n\n\tAnd smash he does.  He smashes foot soldiers, one of the giant serpent ships, the flying machines and, in one of the most memorable scenes, Loki himself. \n"}, {"text": "When all of the Avengers are bickering in the lab on the S.H.I.E.L.D helicarrier which Avenger is not present?", "correct": "Hawkeye", "options": ["Dr. Banner", "Black Widow", "Captain America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye.\n\n\tHawkeye isn't there because he is still under Loki's control at this time.  It is happening right around when Hawkeye is leading the attack on the helicarrier.  Luckily, the Black Widow is able to subdue him and returns him back to his normal self where he can take his place on the Avenger team. \n"}, {"text": "When Tony Stark is threatening Loki and going through the Avengers roll call what is he doing?", "correct": "Making a drink", "options": ["Using an energy absorber to suck the energy out of Loki's staff", "Dialing 911 on his phone", "Setting Stark Tower to self destruct"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaking a drink.\n\n\tHe actually offers Loki a drink during this time as well. This turns into a great piece of dialogue later on, after he has been defeated. As Loki lies there, staring up at all six Avengers looking down on him he mutters, \"If it's all the same to you, I'll have that drink now.\" \n"}, {"text": "In one of the final scenes of the film, Pepper and Tony are standing on a section of Stark Tower that has been destroyed holding blueprints for something.  As they are standing, the camera pans out so the audience can see more of Stark Tower and only one letter from STARK is left standing.  Which letter is it?", "correct": "A", "options": ["K", "S", "R"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA.\n\n\tWith blueprints in hand and the A being prominently featured, this could be  foreshadowing that they will be building the Avengers headquarters on that spot.  Shortly after that scene we see foreshadowing once again when the evil Thanos makes an appearance and smiles upon hearing \"Humans... they are not the cowering wretches we were promised! They are unruly, and so cannot be ruled! To challenge them, is to court death.\" \n"}]}
