{"id": "407650", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 30\" [6] Quiz | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 30"], "questions": [{"text": "In Leg 11, Henry and Evan faced a Speed Bump requiring that they work with which of these?", "correct": "Paper lanterns", "options": ["Paper cranes", "Paper planes", "Paper frogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaper lanterns.\n\n\tCommencing Leg 11, the final four teams were told to fly one thousand miles to the Pearl of the Orient, the city of Hong Kong.  Upon arriving, teams needed to make their way to the overlook at Victoria Peak to find a clue in the hands of a marked photography kiosk.  Though teams could continue from here, Henry and Evan came upon their mandatory Speed Bump task at this point, and for this additional challenge they needed to light and hang forty Chinese paper lanterns.  When they were done, teams could get their photo taken and receive their next destination. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Detour tasks, encountered in Hong Kong in Leg 11, was done in the rain?", "correct": "'Hairy Crab'", "options": ["'Grub Grab'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Hairy Crab'.\n\n\tTeams, receiving their photograph, could grab a clue and proceed to Aberdeen Promenade to find their Detour task.  In 'Hairy Crab', teams needed to join the local fishermen in properly securing a basket of hairy crabs and tying them to be sent to market.  Once they tied fifty crabs in the rain, they could receive their next clue. In 'Grub Grab', teams instead needed to head to a seafood restaurant where one team member had to take a full table order in Cantonese, relay it to their partner in the kitchen, and properly plate and serve the dishes.  'Hairy Crab' was done by Kristi and Jen and Cody and Jessica while 'Grub Grab' was done by Alex and Conor and Henry and Evan. \n"}, {"text": "In the Leg 11 Road Block, team members destroyed which of these to find their clues?", "correct": "Computers", "options": ["Statues", "Vehicles", "Beer bottles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComputers.\n\n\tAfter their Detour, teams headed by taxi to Central Pier #4 to find their Road Block waiting on the roof for their arrivals.  Here, teams encountered the Road Block.  For this one, team members needed to blow off a little steam by creating a bit of rage art.  Using a bat, they just needed to destroy electronics while they searched for two halves of a clue in different components.  Once Henry, Connor, Cody, and Kristi finished their 'art', they could head out. \n"}, {"text": "Before checking into the Pit Stop, teams needed to figure out the code to open which of these?", "correct": "Briefcase", "options": ["Safe", "Cryptex", "Computer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBriefcase.\n\n\tWhile some team members completed their rage art for the Road Block, their counterparts were shackled to a black briefcase and, following the prior task, they were instructed to head by taxi to Lan Kwai Fong to figure out how to open it.  What teams didn't know is that the streets would contain three critical red and yellow neon signs for items featured on the race. If they could identify them and match them to their corresponding leg numbers (1 for the Washington Square Arch, 3 for a fez, and 5 for a bull), they would have the numbers to punch into their briefcase to get their next instructions. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was last to be eliminated from the race at the end of Leg 11 (in Hong Kong)?", "correct": "Alex and Conor", "options": ["Henry and Evan", "Kristi and Jen", "Cody and Jessica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlex and Conor.\n\n\tAs teams opened their briefcases they found two specific road signs-- one for Johnston Road and one for Wan Chai Road.  This was all teams needed to be able to search for Phil at the race's final Pit Stop, there at the specific intersection.  Though they had a Speed Bump, Henry and Evan pulled into first place at the Detour and kept the lead to win their second leg of the race (and making them one of the three teams in the final leg).  Alex and Conor, unable to figure out their briefcase, ended up being eliminated out on the race course.  They became the final team eliminated. \n"}, {"text": "In teams' final destination city, San Francisco, they needed to search outside of a stadium for which of these?", "correct": "Baseball", "options": ["Hockey puck", "Football", "Tennis ball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaseball.\n\n\tAt the end of the race, teams needed to fly over the Pacific, taking a long flight from Hong Kong due east to San Francisco, California (which they did, fortunately, in business class).  When they landed, they could make their way to AT&T Park and locate their first clue at the statue of the 'Say Hey Kid', Willie Mays. Their time at the stadium didn't end there though-- they had to hop into kayaks and paddle around the waters of McCovey Cove searching for a marked baseball-- three in many-- bearing the numbers 6-6-0, indicating Mays' total career home runs.  They could trade the balls for a clue. \n"}, {"text": "The final Road Block of the race sent teams to a task at what San Francisco landmark?", "correct": "San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge", "options": ["Golden Gate Bridge", "Coit Tower", "Alcatraz Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.\n\n\tFollowing the baseball task, teams received a Road Block that would send one team member on the highest ascender climb ever held on \"The Amazing Race\".  In this task, Kristi, Cody, and Evan were selected to pull themselves up the side of the Bay Bridge's anchorage, a height of more than two hundred feet.  At the top, they would go inside, get rigged in an LED light suit, and perform a freefall through the dark, cavernous structure, claim their next clue, and reunite with their partner to keep racing. \n"}, {"text": "Teams stopped off at San Francisco's Chinatown in Leg 12.  It was there that they made dozens of which of these?", "correct": "Fortune cookies", "options": ["Steamed buns", "Dumplings", "Egg rolls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFortune cookies.\n\n\tOnce teams were released from the Road Block they received a puzzling clue-- a rebus containing pictures and items that would lead them to the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company in San Francisco's famous Chinatown district.  If teams could determine the destination they would find that their next challenge would involve using traditional methods to make fortune cookies.  Both team members would need to take turns, creating fifty-one cookies each (for a total of one hundred and two) to be given their next clue, written on the slip inside a giant fortune cookie. \n"}, {"text": "The final task of the race, the season's memory task, involved constructing which of these on the USS Hornet?", "correct": "Airplane", "options": ["The Golden Gate Bridge", "Boat", "Road sign"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAirplane.\n\n\tThe teams finished the fortune cookie task and were directed to their last destination, the USS Hornet in Alameda, which they could reach after their final taxi ride of the race.  It was here that they had to enter the massive museum ship and search for twelve parts of a large model plane scattered throughout the cabins and decks of the craft, all coloured the same as their provided fuselage and all bearing stickers indicating moments from the previous legs of the race. Once they had all twelve, the team member who did not participate int he Road Block needed to assemble the plane in such a way that it would use half of the provided pieces, but represent each of the twelve legs of the race. If they could work out the puzzle and build the plane, they would be given the go-ahead. \n"}, {"text": "Which team won \"The Amazing Race 30\"?", "correct": "Cody and Jessica", "options": ["Kristi and Jen", "Henry and Evan", "Alex and Conor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCody and Jessica.\n\n\tOnce team members completed their planes they could run them down the deck of the USS Hornet to reunite with their partners and then proceed on foot, together, to the far end of the flight deck, to land on the Finish Line.  After more than two and a half hours of searching, puzzling, and building, Jessica was able to complete her plane first, mere minutes before Henry. It was because of this that she and Cody were able to race down the ship first and land on the mat to win the race and the one million dollar prize.  Cody and Jessica were followed closely by Henry and Evan in second and then by Kristi and Jen in third. \n"}]}
