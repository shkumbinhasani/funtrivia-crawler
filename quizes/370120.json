{"id": "370120", "name": "Gallows Humor Quiz | Doctor Who | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Doctor Who", "Doctor Who - Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "The Doctor must have had the \"hots\" for Reinette, since he sat in her fireplace so often. He was heartbroken, though, when he arrived just after her \"ticker\" stopped and it was her \"time\" to go.\n\nThese three puns (for your amusement or possible disappointment) involve which of these characters of history, who found the Doctor in her childhood bedroom?", "correct": "Madame de Pompadour", "options": ["Elizabeth II", "Queen Victoria", "Lady Jane Grey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadame de Pompadour.\n\n\tMadame de Pompadour appeared in the 2006 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Girl in the Fireplace\". As a girl, Reinette met the Doctor in her fireplace. An alien spacecraft had used the fireplace as a portal to the 1700s, because they needed to find a brain to power their ship. They chose Reinette, but she was not 'ready' until she was 39. Of course, the Doctor was able to save her from the ticking clock people, but when he returned for her a few moments later to show her the stars, she was gone.Being a time traveler, his three minutes was her three years. He arrived only to see Reinette being carried away in a casket.A sad episode that I hopefully lightened up with puns. \n"}, {"text": "This person only had a few brief appearances before they died in \"Doctor Who\", but this Prime Minister was a favorite to many. First seen with the Slitheen, the person introduced themselves as a member of Parliament. Before long, they were Prime Minister during Britain's golden age.\n\nYes, you know who they are. Which character is it?", "correct": "Harriet Jones", "options": ["Winston Churchill", "Harold Saxon", "Margaret Thatcher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarriet Jones.\n\n\tHarriet Jones was a popular character who first appeared as a member of Parliament in the Slitheen episode \"Aliens of London\". In the episode, she introduced herself to everyone as \"Harriet Jones, backbench MP for Flydale North.\" In a later episode, while fighting the Sycorax, Harriet Jones had indeed become Prime Minister (something she at first did not think possible) and introduced herself to everyone as \"Harriet Jones, Prime Minister.\" By now, everyone she meets (even the Sycorax) replies with \"yes, we know who you are.\" In the 2008 episode \"The Stolen Earth\", Harriet Jones is seen once again, for her final time.While protecting the earth and the Doctor, Jones is discovered by Daleks. Her sad demise was lightened by her introducing herself to the Daleks as \"Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister\" and the Dalek's reply of \"Yes, we know who you are.\" \n"}, {"text": "In one episode of \"Doctor Who\", the Doctor becomes a human to hide from an enemy chasing him through time and space. John Smith was just what the Doctor ordered; in this new human form, the Doctor was finally able to live a normal life.\n\nSister of mine was very sad when John Smith died (ooh, a \"Doctor Who\" pun AND a hint, how lucky of you). What enemy was pursuing the Doctor?", "correct": "The Family of Blood", "options": ["The Cybermen", "The Slitheen", "The Adipose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Family of Blood.\n\n\tThe 2007 episode \"The Family of Blood\" followed the Doctor as he fled from the Family. In order to hide from these creatures, who could smell his Time Lord blood, he hid his Time Lord consciousness inside a fob watch. Unfortunately for Martha, the Doctor, as his human form 'John Smith', fell in love with Joan. Joan made the Doctor's decision to become the Doctor once again even more sad for both him and just about every \"Doctor Who\" fan. She made the comment that he wasn't just becoming the Doctor again, he was killing John Smith, as his life would cease to exist. \n"}, {"text": "In the episode \"The Doctor's Wife\", we were introduced to a new character who we actually knew since the very beginning of \"Doctor Who\". Her 'death' was super sad, because it was so heartbreaking for the Doctor.\n\nThe Doctor has been married almost as often as Henry VIII... Which of his 'wives' died in this 2011 episode?", "correct": "Idris", "options": ["Melody", "Liz", "Rose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIdris.\n\n\tIn the episode \"The Doctor's Wife\", the TARDIS' core is forced out by House into a conscious body. The girl whose body kept the TARDIS was named Idris, though the Doctor preferred to call the living TARDIS \"Sexy\". Meanwhile, Amy and Rory were being tortured inside the dead TARDIS by House. Naturally, in the end, everything worked out okay - all except that the TARDIS could not survive in a human body for long, and her living consciousness died and returned to the TARDIS core. \n"}, {"text": "\"And I'm free - free fallin'.\"\n\nIn a Christmas special episode, the Doctor crashed into the spaceship Titanic, and he met a girl who would become his companion for the episode. At the end of the episode, she saved the Doctor and began falling. She continued to fall until the Doctor was able to scatter her among the stars.\n\nWhich of these characters' deaths was it?", "correct": "Astrid Peth", "options": ["Bannakaffalata", "Sarah Jane Smith", "Novice Hame"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAstrid Peth.\n\n\tAstrid Peth was a waitress on the Titanic spaceship who met the Doctor and traveled with him through the ship after it crashed. She was kept safe until the very end, where she used a forklift to push Max (the bad guy) off an edge. She began to fall, and the ship's programming kept her falling forever. The Doctor, however, reversed this effect and tried to save her.It was too late, however, so all he was able to do was scatter her among the stars (she had always wanted to see the stars), telling her she was not falling, but flying. This 2007 Christmas special was sad to many, but especially to the Doctor.He had just lost Martha as a companion and now he had lost Astrid as well. \n"}, {"text": "The Doctor is always changing history, but some events are \"timelocked\" and he cannot change them. In \"The Water of Mars\", however, he changed the fate of one crew member and kept her alive. However, this character knew this would change history, and she went inside her home and killed herself instead.\n\n\"Don't go in the water.\" What was the name of the character who was supposed to die from water on Mars but instead shot herself in her home?", "correct": "Adelaide Brooke", "options": ["Darwin Brooks", "Sydney Brooks", "Victoria Brooks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdelaide Brooke.\n\n\tIn the 2009 special \"The Water of Mars\", the Doctor met a crew who were living on Mars. It was discovered, though, that the water was dangerous. Adelaide wanted to leave Mars to return to Earth, but the Doctor would not let them because he knew of their deaths; not only would their deaths spark a wave of scientific discoveries, but the possibility of bringing the deadly water back to earth was too great.In the end, the Doctor decided to defy history and bring Adelaide home in the TARDIS. However, when Adelaide learned of her supposed death, and how it inspired her granddaughter to make huge advancements in science, she decided she was not supposed to be alive after all.She went inside her home, we heard a gunshot, and the newspaper article changed to show Adelaide had died in her home on the very day she was originally supposed to die. \n"}, {"text": "You may as well call this character \"Forever Alone\", because he had lived for possibly millions of years as the last of his kind. His last appearance was in \"Gridlock\", where he spoke one final secret to the Doctor before his tragic death.\n\nWhat character died only after the third meeting of the Doctor?", "correct": "Face of Boe", "options": ["Lady Cassandra", "Strax", "Donna Noble"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFace of Boe.\n\n\tThe Face of Boe was only seen in a few episodes of \"Doctor Who\", and on the Doctor's second meeting of him, the Face of Boe was dying. However, he told the Doctor they would meet one more time, which happened in the 2007 episode \"Gridlock\". The Face of Boe gave all his remaining life force to help the citizens of New New New New New New New New New New New New New New New York (that's 15 'news'). Before he died, the Face of Boe revealed one final secret to the doctor: \"You Are Not Alone\". I won't tell you what it meant, because that is my final secret.\r Another episode hinted at who the Face of Boe was, though it was never confirmed for sure. It was said that Jack Harkness was often called \"The Face of Boe\", and he was concerned about how he would age and what he would look like, and if there would ever come a time where he would actually finally die. If it is true that Jack Harkness is indeed the Face of Boe, and all the facts do indeed fit together, it would make for quite an interesting story... \n"}, {"text": "Some characters die more than others. One companion of the Doctor died several times; in two different dreams that were reality, by a gunshot then taken by a crack so as never to exist, only to become living plastic to guard a box for 2,000 years only to die again, then come back to a world where the plastic part never happened, and finally die a time or two more.\n\nThe resilient character always makes me think of \"Stayin' Alive\", since he never seemed to actually remain dead. Which character died so many times?", "correct": "Rory Williams", "options": ["Ian Chesterton", "Jack Harkness", "Aldric"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRory Williams.\n\n\tTrue, Jack Harkness did die countless times, but never in the ways mentioned in the question. Rory Williams, however, died in several ways throughout the series, mostly while defending his true love, Amy Pond. In fact, it never seemed to be Rory's death that saddened us; it was why he died and what affect the death had on Amy. In the 2010 episode \"Amy's Choice\", two scenes unfolded, where one was supposed to be reality, and one a dream.When Rory was killed in one dream, Amy immediately decided that scene was the dream. Her reasoning? \"If this is the reality then I don't want it.\" She decided to kill herself and the Doctor in this dream (they were told that once they were dead in the dream, they'd wake up in reality). She didn't know whether it was the dream or the reality, but all she cared was that she didn't want it if it was reality because Rory wasn't there.His death, and Amy's reaction to it, cemented the love of the characters for many, and proved Amy's love was for Rory. There was not a dry eye in my house! \n"}, {"text": "Time travel is a curious thing, because sometimes we see the death of a character before we have even met them. In \"The Silence of the Library\", one character's death was sad, but it wasn't \"rip-your-heart-in-to-a-million-pieces-sad\" until the second time I watched the episode, after knowing who the character was. I would give you more information, but \"Spoilers.\"\n\nWho was this wonderful character who died trying to save the people who were saved?", "correct": "River Song", "options": ["Miss Evangelista", "Vashta Nerada", "Anita"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiver Song.\n\n\tIn \"Silence in the Library\", we met a new character by the name of Professor River Song. Throughout the episode, she was very distraught that the Doctor did not recognize her; and she even commented on how young he looked. She foreshadowed many events that happened in later episodes and seasons, but these hints weren't really noticeable until rewatching this 2008 episode.Her death was very upsetting, because we knew we'd see her again, and she seemed to know the Doctor quite well. The episode became even more heartwrenching after seeing the episode where River tells Rory that one day she would see the Doctor and he wouldn't even know who she was, and she thought it would kill her.Watching \"Silence in the Library\" again after that episode made her death all the more depressing. \n"}, {"text": "Even the Doctor has died, even before he could regenerate into a new body. It was the Impossible Astronaut who had killed him, and the timelocked event could never be changed. This puzzled many viewers, who had no clue what would happen since the Doctor had a death which could not be avoided. Perhaps it was the end of \"Doctor Who\"?\n\nIs there a doctor in the house? Oh wait, he died. In which of these locations was the Doctor shot and killed?", "correct": "Lake Silencio, Utah", "options": ["Bad Wolf Bay, Norway", "Torchwood Estate", "Aboard the TARDIS"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLake Silencio, Utah.\n\n\tThe Doctor died at the beginning of the sixth season when he was shot at Lake Silencio by the Impossible Astronaut. By the end of the season, during \"The Wedding of River Song\", we learn that the Doctor was shot by River Song herself, and in an alternate universe where she refused to shoot him, time became stagnant.Eventually, the entire universe would end if the Doctor didn't die. Somehow though, the Doctor managed to cheat death even in a timelocked event by using the robot Teselecta to his advantage. He was on the beach right where he needed to be, and the timelocked event had indeed occurred.However, instead of dying, the Doctor sat safely inside the robot replica of himself. Yes, even a timelocked event can be rewritten if you're the Doctor! \n"}]}
