Responsible breeders don't breed them. A \"breed\" of dog is one that breeds true- i.e.- if you breed beagles to beagles, you get more beagles. This isn't true with cockapoos- if you breed 2 first-generation cockapoos, you don't get dogs of any recognizable type- some look like poodles, some look like cockers, and some look like something in between. That's why they are usually sold only as first-generation crosses. \n"}]}
