{"id": "345314", "name": "\"Smoldering Children\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Murder House"], "questions": [{"text": "Who was responsible for causing Larry's disfiguring burns?", "correct": "Tate", "options": ["Charles", "Larry", "Constance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTate.\n\n\tIn 1994, Constance, Tate, Addy, and Larry gather around the table for dinner.  Tate offers to say grace while Larry expresses his delight at his willingness to join their new family.  Instead of a real prayer, Tate criticizes their circumstances, especially Larry's apparent blindness towards the fact that Constance doesn't really love him; she just wants back in the house she once owned.  Tate says that Larry's family burned themselves alive upon the discovery of his infidelity and Larry explains that there are sacrifices people have in the name of love.  Tate also blames Larry for the death of Beau, his sibling.\rThe next morning, high on drugs, Tate finally cracks.  He dresses up in his trench coat, gathers his guns, and before visiting his school with the intent to shoot his fellow students, he stops in at Larry's office with a can of gasoline.  He douses Larry at his desk before lighting a match and setting him ablaze. \n"}, {"text": "What nickname did the media give to Travis' murder?", "correct": "'The Boy Dahlia'", "options": ["'The Superstar'", "'Hollywoodland'", "'Silver Surfer'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Boy Dahlia'.\n\n\tBen visits Vivian at the mental hospital to offer an apology.  She doesn't want it though - she wants him to leave.  She thinks he's the crazy one but he says he knows the truth, that she was raped.  Ben reveals to Viv that one of the babies is not his, something that she didn't know.  The reason he was furious with her during his last visit was because he was convinced it was Luke's doing.  Ben says that they'll find answers and although there are a few legal hoops to jump through, they'll be able to get her out.  She says, however, that she won't go back to the house.\rConstance is visited by two detectives about Travis' body as it's been found in a park in the city.  She's genuinely shocked and the cops believe his body was dumped there.  They admit that he's what the news has referred to as the 'Boy Dahlia' because of the similarity between his and Elizabeth Short's murder in 1947. \n"}, {"text": "How many days was Violet absent from school before Ben was visited by the truancy officer?", "correct": "Sixteen", "options": ["Forty", "Thirty-one", "Seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSixteen.\n\n\tBen is visited at the house by a truant officer but, since he's on the phone with an investigator about possible samples taken from the rubber mask, he's unable to deal with the issue at the moment.  The officer comes in to find a bowl of fruit swarming with flies and Ben suggests that perhaps he should call an exterminator.  The truant officer states that Violet has been absent for sixteen days.  If she's out of school any longer, she'll go to juvenile court.\rBen stops in in Violet's room to ask about the school issue.  He says he's been a lousy father lately and he apologizes for everything in the past year but he tries to reason with her.  She says she can't go back and when he offers to find her another, she says they're all the same.  He says she has to go tomorrow; there's no way around it. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Constance originally assume killed Travis?", "correct": "Larry", "options": ["Hayden", "Random vandals", "Tate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarry.\n\n\tConstance stops in at Larry's apartment claiming that she needs somewhere to turn.  He's thrilled.  She says that Travis has been murdered and she holds a knife to his throat.  She says that he must've killed Travis, but he says he only moved the body.  He doesn't know who in the house did it.  When Constance realizes that Travis died in the house, she decides she has to go to him.  She tells Larry that she endured Larry for the sake of her family but she never loved him.\rViolet heads downstairs, prepared to go to school, but Tate stops her at the bottom of the stairs and asks her to spend the day with him.  After a kiss, she agrees. \n"}, {"text": "What did Constance do to her husband's body?", "correct": "Cut it up and fed it to the dogs", "options": ["Hid it beneath the floorboards", "Buried it in the yard", "Burned it in the furnace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCut it up and fed it to the dogs.\n\n\tConstance heads home to find the detectives at her door.  They say that the man at the Korean store down the road remembers their fights and they ask if she'll come to the precinct.  When her knife falls out of her purse, she realizes she has no choice.\rThe flies in the Harmon household seem to keep multiplying, so Ben calls in the exterminator, Phil, who says that most of these old houses have three-foot crawlspaces underneath, so pests of all sorts get in.  He will be able to make an estimate as soon as he goes underneath.\rAt the precinct, Constance feels like she has no reason to be there.  They feel, however, that too many people have been dying around her.  Beau, for example, died of 'natural causes'; Tate was a mass murderer; her husband and maid, Hugo and Moira, went missing.  Constance claims that she never pursued them because she couldn't stand in the way of true love.  In reality, she buried Moira in the yard, cut up her husband, and fed him to the dogs in the cellar to hide the evidence. \n"}, {"text": "What is Harry Goodman's profession?", "correct": "Lawyer", "options": ["Exterminator", "Police officer", "Principal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLawyer.\n\n\tConstance receives an appointed lawyer, Harry Goodman, who asks her to stop speaking to the detectives.  He says that the 'Boy Dahlia' case will bring a lot of attention to the department.  They want to pin the case on her to alleviate the pressure that they're getting.  This is why she needs to keep quiet.\rPhil suits up to begin the extermination in the Harmons' crawlspace and he descends beneath the house to find tons of bugs.  What he finds deeper in the darkness is much worse however.  He tries to run, but Tate stops him, backs him against a wall, and asphyxiates him with his own bug spray.\rBen calls a preparatory school to try and secure a spot for Violet.  He sees Tate's reflection in a picture frame but turns around to find no one there. \n"}, {"text": "How many daughters did Larry have?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["None", "Three", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tViolet plays chess with Tate in the attic and Tate expresses his concern that Ben is trying to send her away.  She believes that perhaps, since he sent Viv away, he'll do the same with her.  Tate says he won't let him send her away and he dresses up in the rubber suit yet another time.\rIn the basement, Larry removes some of the bricks from the wall to reveal Travis' clothes.  Travis asks what he's doing with his stuff and Larry explains that he has to move it because it's evidence.  Travis seems fine with this, but he wants to know if he's been in the news.  He's kind of thrilled to have been on TV.  Travis is disappointed that Constance has been taking the news hard.  Two girls, Margaret and Angela, call Travis back to the other room, asking him to play.  Both are Larry's daughters.  Travis goes to play with them after asking for some news clippings.  Larry is delighted to see his daughters and his wife, Lorraine, appears behind him.  He asks why he hasn't seen them before and she explains that he must be ready; he's on the cusp.  He apologizes for everything and she tells him to prove it.  Larry says he'll make Constance pay, but Lorraine says he was the one to break the vows, not Constance.  They disappear, leaving him alone in the basement. \n"}, {"text": "Does Ben discover the identity of the Rubberman?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tBen emerges from the shower and wipes the steam away from the mirror to find the Rubberman behind him.  The two engage in a fight, but ultimately, Rubberman gets the upper hand, bringing Ben to the ground and drugging him.  Before he passes out, Ben is able to get the rubber mask off to discover Tate underneath.  He says that the only reason he isn't killing Ben is because of Violet.\rHarry stops over at Constance's house to bring her to the station.  He says that he thinks she'll be charged.\rTate returns to the attic to a concerned Violet and he suggests that they take enough pills to commit suicide and be together forever.  She agrees to the idea and she asks if they can do it in the bathtub.  She says she'll go run the bath but instead she makes a run for it, screaming for help. \n"}, {"text": "The body of which character is found in the crawlspace?", "correct": "Violet & Violet Harmon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nViolet & Violet Harmon.\n\n\tViolet races downstairs in terror and, when Ben doesn't respond, she rushes out the front door to the gate, screaming for help from the people across the street. Only a dog starts barking at her; the people don't notice.  She runs out the gate and instantly appears in the kitchen.  Tate finds her there and she runs to the front door again, only to reappear at the back door.  When Tate rounds the corner, she says that she doesn't want to die but he says it's too late for that.  Tate tells her that he won't hurt her but he needs to show her something; then she can go wherever she wants.\rThey go to the basement and down into the crawlspace, into the darkness.  What he shows her she can't prepare for, even though he says she'll be okay.  When she opens her eyes, she finds her own body, swarming with flies and contorted by weeks of decomposition.  She died when she took too many pills weeks before.  Tate tried to help her cough up the medication but she took too many.  He says that she died crying in the bathtub with him, but she died loved. \n"}, {"text": "Who steps up and takes responsibility for Travis' murder?", "correct": "Larry", "options": ["Tate", "Constance", "Ben"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarry.\n\n\tConstance is brought to the station and she's shown behind the one-way mirror to find Larry giving a confession, complete with the murder weapon.  Constance does not admit to knowing him and, thus, does not give any hint towards a motive.  She figures that he must've admitted his guilt to pacify a guilty conscience.\rTate and Violet play a game of cards in her room and discuss the past few weeks.  They both thought that they were protecting each other from different secrets; Tate even knew he was a ghost the whole time.  He hid the fact to have a better shot with her.  She asks what it'll be like and he says it'll be like it's always been.  He says it's the two of them together for always.\rIn prison, Larry receives a visitor.  It's Constance.  He says he's glad to see her one last time because he's being sent to Illinois to serve the rest of his sentence.  He wonders why she won't ask why he admitted to the crime, but she says that she long stopped asking why the mad do mad things.  Larry says he needs to pay for the crimes he committed and he can take it all as long as she'll say the words he needs to hear.  He says he knows she loved him once, but she refuses to make a reply.  Instead, she hangs up the phone and makes her exit. \n"}]}
