{"id": "79296", "name": "Make Your Own Mozzarella! Online Trivia | Food & Drink | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "Food & Drink", "Cheeses and Dairy Products"], "questions": [{"text": "First of all, let's talk about milk. Mozzarella is traditionally made with water buffalo milk, but unless you live in India you probably don't have any on hand. What kind of milk can you use to make your cheese?", "correct": "Goat's or cow's milk", "options": ["The milk of human kindness", "Chocolate milk", "Milk of Magnesia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoat's or cow's milk.\n\n\tYou may not be as lucky as I am and have milk fresh from the goat- so you can use milk fresh from the store. \n"}, {"text": "How much milk do you use for a nice batch of cheese?", "correct": "One US gallon", "options": ["One ounce", "An industrial-sized truck full", "One cow full"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne US gallon.\n\n\tA gallon is an easy amount to work with. That's a little under 4 liters, if you happen to be metric. \n"}, {"text": "You'll need three more ingredients to make your cheese. The first is citric acid, a natural chemical. It acidifies the milk to help make nice stretchy cheese. You can buy this at your local Jewish deli or other store carrying Jewish items. What will it be called?", "correct": "Sour salt", "options": ["Schmaltz", "Oy gevalt, you're asking me?", "Chopped liver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSour salt.\n\n\tIt's the same stuff that's sprinkled on gummy candies to make them sour. \n"}, {"text": "The next ingredient you'll need is rennet. Rennet coagulates the milk. Rennet has two sources- what are they?", "correct": "Animal rennet from calf stomachs or vegetable rennet from fungi", "options": ["Paste and glue", "Ren and Stimpy", "The Federal Reserve and the Smithsonian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnimal rennet from calf stomachs or vegetable rennet from fungi.\n\n\tIn a calf's stomach, rennet turns the milk into a curd that the baby can digest. Rennet that is just as good and doesn't kill any cute baby calves is made from fungi that produce the enzyme naturally. \n"}, {"text": "And you'll also need some salt. Which kind of salt is best for cheesemaking?", "correct": "Kosher salt", "options": ["Salt of the earth", "Salt and Pepa", "Old Salt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKosher salt.\n\n\tPick it up when you buy that sour salt. It doesn't contain any additives that can affect the cheese. \n"}, {"text": "What equipment will you need to make your cheese?", "correct": "A stainless steel pot, a thermometer, measuring spoons, a glass measuring cup, a stirring spoon, a colander, a bowl and some cheesecloth", "options": ["A dairy farm, a huge production vat, and ten thousand laborers", "A Tinkertoy set, an erector set, and one of those cool chemistry kits", "Nothing. The true purist needs nothing."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA stainless steel pot, a thermometer, measuring spoons, a glass measuring cup, a stirring spoon, a colander, a bowl and some cheesecloth.\n\n\tCheese should always be made in stainless steel. It's easy to clean and doesn't impart flavors to the cheese. The cheesecloth you use should be fine, not the stuff sold in grocery stores. An old sheet or towel can be used. A digital thermometer is easiest to read. \n"}, {"text": "All that gear that you use to make the cheese should be as sterile as possible. What is NOT a good way to sterilize your cheesemaking stuff?", "correct": "A trip to Three Mile Island or Chernobyl", "options": ["The dishwasher", "Bleach", "Boiling water"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA trip to Three Mile Island or Chernobyl.\n\n\tHave it clean before you start. \n"}, {"text": "All right, let's make cheese! Put that milk in your pot and stir in some citric acid dissolved in a quarter cup of water. How much citric acid do you use?", "correct": "One and one quarter teaspoons", "options": ["5 pounds", "The national production of Armenia", "A whole whole bunch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne and one quarter teaspoons.\n\n\tYou want the pH to be around 5.6 when you start, ending up at around 5.3. \n"}, {"text": "Now put the cheese-making pot in a sinkful of nice hot water, stick the thermometer in it and stir it every once in awhile. How warm do you want it to get?", "correct": "88 degrees Fahrenheit", "options": ["Fahrenheit 451", "6 degrees of separation", "-52 Kelvin"], "explanation": "\n\n\n88 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\tYou can add a bit of boiling water to the sink every now and then to help keep the water warm. \n"}, {"text": "Once it's at the correct temperature, take the pot out of the water and add 10 drops of rennet, mixed in a quarter cup of water. Let the pot sit, covered, for 15 minutes. What will happen?", "correct": "The milk will coagulate into a firm curd", "options": ["The Health Department will show up at your doorstep", "Your Italian grandmother will materialize and tell you that you are doing it all wrong", "The rats will abandon the Pied Piper and move in with you"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe milk will coagulate into a firm curd.\n\n\tThe curd is about the consistency of soft tofu or egg custard. \n"}, {"text": "Using a long-bladed knife, cut the curd into 1-inch cubes. Put the pot back into the sink and add enough hot water to the sink to bring the temperature up to about 115 degrees F. Stir gently every now and then for 40 minutes.What will you see happening in your pot now?", "correct": "The curds will shrink and you'll see lots of whey", "options": ["Your future is reflected in the whey", "Whey more than you expected", "No whey!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe curds will shrink and you'll see lots of whey.\n\n\tThe curds are getting firmer and stretchier. \n"}, {"text": "After 40 minutes, line a colander with the cheesecloth and balance it over a big pot or bowl. Pour the curds and whey into the colander. Let sit 10 minutes. What will you have in the colander?", "correct": "A lump of curd that looks something like cheese!", "options": ["A lump on the head", "A lump of gold", "A lump of sugar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA lump of curd that looks something like cheese!.\n\n\tWhile it's draining, you can break up the curd mass once or twice so more whey drains off. You can also turn the lump of curd for the same reason. \n"}, {"text": "It's almost cheese! Break off a cup of curd and put it into a glass measuring cup. Sprinkle it with a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Stick it in the microwave on high for 50 seconds. What will it resemble when you take it out?", "correct": "Silly Putty in cream", "options": ["Something from your wildest nightmares", "The Creature from the Black Lagoon", "Elvis Presley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilly Putty in cream.\n\n\tIt's looking like mozzarella! \n"}, {"text": "Using a stainless steel spoon, stretch and compress the ball of cheese a few times, like pulling taffy. Stick it back in the microwave for 25 more seconds. Take it out and stretch and compress it more, like playing with a lump of Play-Doh. Pour off the excess whey and continue stretching. When it's cooled a bit, take it out of the cup and pull it out and form it back into a ball a few times. Then roll it into a nice ball. What do you do with it now?", "correct": "Soak it in a cold brine or let it dry a bit", "options": ["Feed it to the dog", "Press it onto the Sunday comics to pick up the pictures", "Play a little handball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSoak it in a cold brine or let it dry a bit.\n\n\tTraditionally, the cheese is brined. The brine is made with about a cup of salt in a quart of ice-cold water. Soaking for an hour or two makes a lightly salted cheese, soaking for longer makes it very salty! \n"}, {"text": "Repeat the steps until all the curd is used up. Ta-da! You now have about 4 balls of mozzarella cheese! What's the best way to preserve whatever you don't devour immediately?", "correct": "Freeze it", "options": ["Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids", "Put it in the pantry with your cupcakes", "Put it in a hiding place where no one ever goes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreeze it.\n\n\tMozzarella is one of the few cheeses that actually improves with freezing. I hope you enjoyed this quiz and do try to make some cheese! \n"}]}
