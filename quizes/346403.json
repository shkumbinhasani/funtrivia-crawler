In the morning the man awakes to find that his spurs and cash have been stolen.\r Lee Hazlewood originally wrote the song and released a recording of it with Suzi Jane Hokom with little success. He then did a duet with Nancy Sinatra, which first appeared as a B-Side to Nancy's 1967 hit \"Sugar Town\". It became a huge hit for the pair with the release of the album in 1968 and began a long and fruitful partnership.\r Pollucci19 hopes that a nice summery wine will go well with your dinner. \n"}, {"text": "When Louis Armstrong first recorded \"Struttin' with Some Barbecue\" in 1927, it didn't have any lyrics - just some incredible instrumental work, with solos by the clarinet and trombone. Songwriter Don Raye added mouth-watering lyrics in 1941. Here's the first verse:\n\n\"Struttin' with some barbecue,\nSwingin' with the band.\nLike the happy people do,\nWay down in ______________.\"\n\nAccording to Raye's lyrics, where are these happy, swingin', struttin' people?", "correct": "Dixieland", "options": ["Georgia", "Kalamazoo", "Appalachia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDixieland.\n\n\tRaye made this jazz standard an ode to the American South, the home of that musical tradition. (And, Southerners would argue, of the only good barbecue.) The title of the piece was original, though, bestowed upon it by its composer - Lil Hardin, who was married to Armstrong from 1924 to 1931. It seems that \"barbecue\" was slang at the time for a beautiful girl - so Hardin may have been thinking of her romance with Satchmo rather than about food! The piece has been performed countless times by countless musicians, with Raye's lyrics and without.\r \"Hear that ol' trombone\rAnd the trumpet ad lib.\rLove to hear the lick,\rWhile I do my pickin' on a juicy rib.\" \r CellarDoor worked for hours getting this dish just right. \n"}, {"text": "\"Cut like a razor blade so fast\nOther DJs say, 'damn'\nIf my rhyme was a drug\n___________________\"\n\nCan you select the next line of lyrics to 'Ice Ice Baby' (1990), sung by cool rapper Vanilla Ice?", "correct": "\"I'd sell it by the gram\"", "options": ["\"I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo\"", "\"I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom\"", "\"Turn off the lights and I'll glow\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"I'd sell it by the gram\".\n\n\t\"Ice Ice Baby\" was written by Vanilla Ice, or Robert Van Winkle as he was originally born, and DJ Earthquake, who surely shook things up. The song used the bass line of \"Under Pressure\" by Queen and David Bowie, and was one of the first songs to make hip-hop more mainstream - however, he garnered much controversy from other rappers such as Eminem who did not appreciate the way he had done his song. Some considered him to be a novelty pop act rather than a credible rapper (whatever a credible rapper is meant to be!).\r Malik24 served up this ice water before the next course. \n"}, {"text": "\"It's all because of you\nI'm feeling sad and blue\nYou went away\nNow my love is just a rainy day\nI love you so\nHow much you'll never know\nYou've gone away and left me lonely\"\n\nThese lyrics belong to a song by A Taste of Honey.

A Taste of Honey's version, using English lyrics, only reached number three on the US Hot 100 but topped the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and the US Billboard Soul chart. \r Tazman6619 finds both sukiyaki and honey delicious, but usually not together. \n"}, {"text": "Which country band hit it big with these lyrics in 2008?\n\n\"You know I like my chicken fried\nCold beer on a Friday night\nA pair of jeans that fit just right\nAnd the radio up\nI like to see the sunrise\nSee the love in my woman's eyes\nFeel the touch of a precious child\nAnd know a mother's love.\"", "correct": "Zac Brown Band", "options": ["Lonestar", "Alabama", "Lady Antebellum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZac Brown Band.\n\n\tThe Zac Brown Band released \"Chicken Fried\" as a single from their album \"The Foundation\".

Their name, The Guess Who, is said to have come about in 1965 after Quality Records attempted to build mystique and hype about their single 'Shakin' All Over', as their single was credited to 'Guess Who?'. In the music charts they were listed as 'Guess Who?' and so, eventually, that name stuck.\r I, for one, am relieved to hear that malik24 was talking about beverages -- not about dessert! \n"}, {"text": "\"You are making me crazy \nI'm in love but I'm lazy\nSo won't you please come home?\"\n\nThe Beatles sang this plaintive plea in 1968, as part of the \"White Album.\" What delicious-sounding pet name do they use for the object of their affection and the title of their song?", "correct": "Honey Pie", "options": ["Pumpkin", "Sugar", "Little Cabbage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoney Pie.\n\n\tProperly titled \"The Beatles,\" the \"White Album\" was a double record as memorable for its diverse mix of songs as for its featureless cover. \"Honey Pie,\" a tribute to the old-style music hall, was never released as a single, but Paul McCartney's heartfelt vocals and the soundtrack's gentle crackle make it memorable all the same. Some of the verses seem as though they could have been sung by the Beatles' own North American fans:\r \"Oh, honey pie, you are driving me frantic.\rSail across the Atlantic\rTo be where you belong!\"\r CellarDoor firmly believes that it's always time for dessert. \n"}, {"text": "Within Christina Aguilera's sugar-rush inducing song 'Candyman' (2007), which characters from an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel published in 1914 and a Disney film released in 1999 are mentioned in the first line of the lyrics?", "correct": "Tarzan and Jane", "options": ["Mulan and Mushu", "Beauty and the Beast", "Gisele and Prince Charming"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTarzan and Jane.\n\n\t\"Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine\rCandyman, candyman\rSippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine\rSweet sugar candyman\"\r 'Candyman' is said to be a highly sexualised song, as the song also mentions engaging in a session of inebriation at a club whilst having dalliances with the paparazzi in hopes of getting a headline the next day. The song's theme is somewhat based on 'Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy' (1941), and the imagery also is somewhat reminiscent of that time.\r Christina Aguilera is also known for songs such as 'Reflection' (sung in 'Mulan' (1998)), 'Hurt' (2006) and, perhaps most prominently, 'Beautiful' (2002), which has been said to be highly inspirational to those with low self-esteem. \r Malik24 has enjoyed this beautiful (and sugary) reflection. \n"}, {"text": "Which farm animal, also named in the title of the song, is giving Elvis Presley the blues?\n\n\"Well, I woke up this morning,\nAnd I looked out the door.\nI can tell that old _______\nBy the way she lowed.\"", "correct": "Milk cow", "options": ["Young buck", "Old bull", "Italian stallion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilk cow.\n\n\tThe song is called \"Milk Cow Blues Boogie\", a number that was originally recorded by Kokomo Arnold in 1934.

It is unclear what, exactly, the song is meant to mean; however, one perspective is that it accentuates women's confidence. There is an alternative interpretation, which is less savoury. However, the song was originally said to have gained a life of its own rather than being based on any particular circumstance.\r Kelis also earned another Grammy nomination for her album 'Kelis Was Here', and she has sung in a variety of different genres, generally in the region of R&B, pop and soul. \r Malik24 is offering a variety of milkshakes, but \"to the yard\" is not a flavor on offer tonight. \n"}, {"text": "Many singers sing about themselves, and Snoop Doggy Dogg is no exception. \"With so much drama in the L.B.C. / It's kinda hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G,\" he raps at the beginning of one of his most famous songs.
