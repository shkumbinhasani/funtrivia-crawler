{"id": "219852", "name": "\"M*A*S*H\" - \"Crisis\" Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "Colonel Henry Blake calls a meeting of senior surgical staff, plus Father Mulcahy. \"Starting right here and now,\" he says, \"we're all going to have to put our shoulders to the wheel, our noses to the grindstone.\" In short, the 4077th's supply lines have been cut. One of Henry's interlocutors is incredulous: \"Who did THAT?\" Who is the disbelieving officer who momentarily forgot they were at war?", "correct": "Frank Burns", "options": ["Father Mulcahy", "Margaret Houlihan", "Hawkeye Pierce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank Burns.\n\n\tIt was \"the other side, Frank,\" Henry wearily reminds him.\r There is, of course, much joking before the bad news is given. \"Welcome to the Henry Blake Clich\u00e9 Festival,\" Trapper announces, and Hawkeye tells Henry that if he wants to be taken seriously he should \"stop talking in samplers.\" But the situation is dire, as they discover when Radar reads out a partial list of supplies they'll have to do without for the time being: \"fruit, vegetables, assorted food, fuel oil, blankets, bandages, linen replacements, toilet paper, mail call, electrical parts, flares, winter clothing, playing cards, shuttlecocks . . .\" \n"}, {"text": "At Major Houlihan's suggestion, Henry puts the unit on Red Alert, distributing power among the senior officers. Whom does he place in charge of looking after the nurses?", "correct": "Major Houlihan", "options": ["Corporal O'Reilly", "Captain Pierce", "Captain McIntyre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor Houlihan.\n\n\tHawkeye offers to trade her his \"maintenance, general service and supplies\" duties for her \"nurse-looking-after,\" but, unsurprisingly, she demurs. Radar becomes the housing officer, which makes him a very popular man on base: in case they have to double or triple up to save heat, he gets to decide \"who sleeps with who.\" \n"}, {"text": "Father Mulcahy is placed in charge of morale, but Frank cruelly shoots down his first effort. Why?", "correct": "They're anticipating a food shortage, yet Father Mulcahy's Bingo players are marking squares with coffee beans.", "options": ["They're anticipating a food shortage, yet Father Mulcahy persists in handing out chocolate to improve morale.", "They're anticipating a shortage of medical supplies, yet Father Mulcahy is encouraging the soldiers to spread bandages all over Henry's tent as a prank.", "They're anticipating a fuel shortage, yet Father Mulcahy's first plan is to roast marshmallows over a bonfire."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey're anticipating a food shortage, yet Father Mulcahy's Bingo players are marking squares with coffee beans.\n\n\tPerhaps luckily for Father Mulcahy, Frank came just before Klinger was able to collect on his BINGO (it was \"N for Nazareth\" that put him over). Klinger tries to stick up for the chaplain, only to be criticized for his extravagant mink coat (\"I paid for it myself,\" he assures an apoplectic Frank). \n"}, {"text": "A little later, Frank has a pleasant surprise for Margaret Houlihan. What does he secretly bring to her tent?", "correct": "a baked ham", "options": ["a bottle of vintage wine", "a roast turkey", "a bar of Belgian chocolate"], "explanation": "\n\n\na baked ham.\n\n\t\"Where did you get it?\" she asks him, salivating already. He reminds her that he's the officer in charge of the food supply: \"I requisitioned it on a chain-of-command priority basis.\" \"You swiped it.\" \"Right.\" \n"}, {"text": "As the nights get colder and fuel supplies get shorter, Hawkeye, Trapper and Frank have to share their tent with several other soldiers. Seeing one of his new tentmates, Frank protests: \"Not on your nelly! You won't catch me sleeping with an enlisted man.\" About whom is Frank so upset?", "correct": "Corporal Klinger", "options": ["Father Mulcahy", "Private Walker", "Private Rizzo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorporal Klinger.\n\n\tHawkeye reassures Frank: \"Just wrap yourself in the flag and go to sleep.\" They're also sharing their tent with Father Mulcahy, Colonel Blake, and Corporal O'Reilly. \"This is quite a hotel you have here,\" says Father Mulcahy, still doing his part to boost morale. \"Why yes,\" agrees Hawkeye, \"this is where the Ritz hit the fan.\" \n"}, {"text": "At this point, all of the major male characters are stuck sleeping in the same tent due to the shortage of heating fuel. One of them admits casually that he snores, causing much consternation among the others. Who is the snorer?", "correct": "Colonel Henry Blake", "options": ["Corporal Klinger", "Corporal Radar O'Reilly", "Major Frank Burns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColonel Henry Blake.\n\n\tYes, Henry snores, a fact he volunteers while suggesting to Radar that he take the cot nearest the outside of the tent. The others beg him to tell them he's joking, but nothing doing: \"I could be on the Olympic snoring team. I snored the siding half off of my house. I even got a fan letter once from the seismograph people at Fordham.\" He suggests that, \"if it gets too bad\" for his tentmates, they could \"just do what my wife does . . . hold me close.\" Somehow this doesn't seem to improve matters . . . \n"}, {"text": "The situation just gets worse for our heroes: a large group of wounded soldiers arrive, but no supplies are sent with them. Henry calls Regimental HQ to try to persuade them to send the most critically needed goods. How does he try to get their attention?", "correct": "By reminding them that he has bought a lot of war bonds.", "options": ["By telling them that one of the wounded is a general's son.", "By asking Radar to play his bugle into the telephone.", "By reading to them from \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy reminding them that he has bought a lot of war bonds.\n\n\t\"Look, buddy, I bought a lot of war bonds,\" he says, \"and you are now talking to a pretty upset stockholder.\" By this time, most of Henry's desk has been dismantled and taken away to be burned for heat, and he reports that newspaper is being sold at a dollar a page to be used as toilet paper. (Later, we learn that desperate people are breaking into the fortune cookies for paper.) \n"}, {"text": "Corporal Klinger, perhaps desperate to escape the snoring, attempts to spend the next night in the nurses' tent. How does Major Houlihan realize he's there?", "correct": "Everyone says \"Good night, Major,\" and one of them is a baritone.", "options": ["He has hidden very well, but one fuzzy pink slipper remains visible.", "She trips over him on her way to the bathroom.", "She starts talking about \"that fool Klinger\" and he says, \"Yes?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nEveryone says \"Good night, Major,\" and one of them is a baritone.\n\n\tThe nurses are happy in their tent - Major Houlihan has just promised to officially commend them all for their \"true-blue American\" conduct during the crisis - and Klinger is naturally distressed to be sent back to the men's tent through the cold. \"Major Houlihan threw me out of the nurses' tent!\" he protests. \"She found out I was a man.\" Hawkeye believes it: \"You've got to get up pretty early in the morning to fool Major Houlihan.\" \n"}, {"text": "Predictably, a fight breaks out between the three surgeons. Trapper and Hawkeye have the advantage over Frank, since they're standing and he's trapped in his own hammock. What are they fighting over?", "correct": "Frank's hunting socks", "options": ["Frank's surgical abilities", "Frank's teddy bear", "Frank's snoring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank's hunting socks.\n\n\tTrapper and Hawkeye, always especially observant when it comes to possible transgressions by Frank, notice that he is sleeping without a blanket even though everyone else is freezing. He insists that he has hypothyroidism, but they continue their investigation and discover his warm feet, heated by his electric hunting socks. (\"I have a bra like that,\" Klinger remarks.) It soon degenerates into a wrestling match, with Frank insistent on keeping the socks and Trapper and Hawkeye equally insistent that he share them. \n"}, {"text": "Regimental HQ eventually comes through, sending a truckload of needed supplies - but something is still missing. The episode closes with Henry calling to replace what item(s), burned during the crisis?", "correct": "His office furniture", "options": ["His collection of alcoholic beverages", "The unit's rolls of red tape", "The unit's orders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis office furniture.\n\n\tEverything except the skeleton is missing; Henry makes his phone call seated atop a briefcase. \"During the recent crisis,\" he explains to the man on the telephone, \"people had an aversion to freezing, so they just burned everything that didn't move or salute.\" And now he finds it hard to get his work done, without his desk or chair or most especially his liquor cabinet (which must have made an impressive flame). Thanks for playing; I hope you've enjoyed the quiz! \n"}]}
