{"id": "399190", "name": "Boo! Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Name the Movie"], "questions": [{"text": "Which 2011 Adam Sandler movie about the misadventures of fraternal twins was nominated for a record-breaking twelve Razzie Awards?", "correct": "Jack and Jill", "options": ["Mr. Deeds", "Pixels", "Grown Ups"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack and Jill.\n\n\tAnd of the twelve Razzies it was nominated for, it won for all of them; \"Jack and Jill\" very quickly dropped onto IMDB's worst movies listing because it was, objectively, one of Sandler's worst-made films according to critics though, despite that, it earned almost $150,000,000 in the box office, nearly doubling its budget.  The movie also starred Katie Holmes and Al Pacino, both of whom technically won Razzies (though Sandler won both Best Actor and Best Actress for playing Jack and Jill).  The movie was an odd couple affair in which Sandler's Jack had some Thanksgiving hijinx with Sandler's Jill.  What an odd sentence to write. \n"}, {"text": "Nicolas Cage travelled to an island of Pagan worshippers to solve the mystery of his missing daughter in what 2006 film known for its bees?", "correct": "The Wicker Man", "options": ["Knowing", "Season of the Witch", "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wicker Man.\n\n\tAlthough the original \"Wicker Man\" film was a horror classic from 1973, director Neil LaBute brought it back in 2006 and boy did it flop.  In addition to barely recouping its budget, the movie was considered an all around failure, especially in regards to the absurd script and poor acting.  Much like the original film (and the novel it was based on), the movie involved one man's trip to an island home to Pagan sacrificers. This plot, however, has been overshadowed by the internet's choice to highlight a scene in which Nicolas Cage is attacked by a basket full of CGI bees-- part of the punishment for his sacrifice to restore the island's honey production. It's all very convoluted. \n"}, {"text": "Kirk Cameron led which 2014 film about 'putting the Christ back in Christmas' that received a 0% Rotten Tomatoes rating upon release?", "correct": "Saving Christmas", "options": ["Deck the Halls", "Surviving Christmas", "Christmas with the Kranks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaving Christmas.\n\n\tPart diatribe against the secularization of the Christmas and part narrative about Christmas itself, \"Saving Christmas\" was seen as a big misstep for the \"Growing Pains\" actor.  Cameron started the film by talking about all the things wrong with a modern Christmas and talking up the Biblical aspects before trying to save the season from the atheists.  In response to the universal criticism for the film, Kirk Cameron asked viewers to \"storm the gates\" of Rotten Tomatoes.  It was a bad move for him; he tanked the movie on the viewers' side too. \n"}, {"text": "A musical starring the first winner and runner-up of \"American Idol\", what 2003 movie was completed due to the stars' contractual obligation?", "correct": "From Justin to Kelly", "options": ["Dreamgirls", "Grease 2", "Cool as Ice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom Justin to Kelly.\n\n\tFeaturing Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini in a Fort Lauderdale-based Romeo and Juliet story, \"From Justin to Kelly\" ended up being a severe flop partly for its lazy music, but also its lacklustre script.  In the years after its release, \"From Justin to Kelly\" ended up getting nominated for ten Razzie Awards, winning one in 2005 for the 'Worst Musical of the Award's First 25 Years'.  The movie only earned back five million dollars of its twelve million dollar budget.  Clarkson's career in pop music flourished despite the movie; Guarini's didn't. \n"}, {"text": "Which 2010 independent horror film about an apocalypse brought on by global warming received a sequel known by the subtitle \"The Resurrection\"?", "correct": "Birdemic: Shock and Terror", "options": ["Cabin Fever: Patient Zero", "Pumpkinhead", "Feardotcom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBirdemic: Shock and Terror.\n\n\tSometimes, you can tell when watching a movie is going to be inadvisable.  \"Birdemic\" is almost exactly what you think it's going to be-- a film in which people are going to face off against too many birds.  It is that, but it's so much more.  Marketed as a 'romantic thriller', the movie seems to split itself down the middle-- the first half being a romantic meeting between the two lead characters and the last half being an eco-thriller featuring clip art bird attacks.  The movie was released independently in 2010 with the sequel, \"Birdemic 2: The Resurrection\" releasing in 2013. \n"}, {"text": "Released on Netflix, what Dylan Minnette teen thriller about a mother and son featured the classic \"there's a killer in the house\" trope?", "correct": "The Open House", "options": ["Little Evil", "When a Stranger Calls", "Rattlesnake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Open House.\n\n\t\"The Open House\" seemed to be the product of Netflix's algorithms since it combined \"13 Reasons Why\" actor Dylan Minnette, low-stakes PG thriller appeal, and the spookiness of possibly having someone in the creepy basement.  A dark film about a mother and son living in a home up for sale, it ended up being shoddily paced and dropped a lot of narrative threads to build up to an anti-climactic explanation. I recall going online after the movie to try and have the film explained to me; I couldn't figure out any answers from that either.  Director Matt Angel is likely best known for acting in several kids horror shows, most of which came from the mind of R. L. Stine. \n"}, {"text": "What 2019 film based on an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical had one reviewer saying it was \"one of the weirdest and most garish monstrosities to be birthed out of the Hollywood studio system in this century\"?", "correct": "Cats", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCats.\n\n\tI went and saw this movie during a Christmas matinee knowing that the reviews for the film were lacklustre.  Due to the already infamous nature of \"Cats\" as a musical, the media about the CGI graphics, and the all-star cast, I knew it would be a weird thing to see in the flesh.  I left the theatre shellshocked. Tom Hooper, who won Oscars for \"The King's Speech\", directed this adaptation of Webber's already quite-unfilmable play about cats introducing each other for two hours and though he roped in Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift, and several others, the film was a trip to uncanny valley.  Another critic stated: \"First off, full disclosure - I am not a cat person.Second off - after watching this frankly mortifying film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, I'm not altogether sure I am a movie person anymore either.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which of these movies, directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, featured parodies of Beowulf, Indiana Jones, Amy Winehouse, and Dr. Phil?", "correct": "Disaster Movie", "options": ["Extreme Movie", "Epic Movie", "Date Movie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDisaster Movie.\n\n\tDirectors and screenwriters of some of the lowest-rated 'comedies' of the 2000s and 2010s, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer made a name for themselves in the parody subgenre, effectively undoing all of the good karma generated by \"The Naked Gun\" series and the early \"Scary Movies\".  \"Disaster Movie\" was, as critics and viewers put it, the worst of the lot; it's frequently been the bottom movie on the IMDB Bottom 100.  The movie had something to do with collecting a crystal skull to save humanity, but along the way, a number of former \"MadTV\" cast members stumbled their way through tactless celebrity impersonations and pratfalls. It received six Razzie nominations. \n"}, {"text": "Though they appeared together in \"Talladega Nights\" and \"Step Brothers\", Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly won the Worst Picture Razzie for appearing together in what 2018 box office bomb?", "correct": "Holmes & Watson", "options": ["Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues", "Daddy's Home", "The Other Guys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHolmes & Watson.\n\n\tDespite appearing together in films to great box office success in the past, \"Holmes & Watson\" proved to be their biggest dud to date, barely making its money back at the box office and receiving scorn from critics and audiences alike for its low-brow, unfunny script.  Allegedly, the movie was hoped to head straight to Netflix in an attempt to dodge poor reception in theatres, but it was refused by the streaming service; it released on Christmas Day in 2018, just in time to make it eligible for the 2019 Razzies (where it picked up six nominations and four wins).  The movie put Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson on the trail of a new criminal, this one forming a murder plot on the Titanic and involving the Queen. \n"}, {"text": "Based on a series of apocalyptic Christian fiction novels, what 2014 Nicolas Cage film is about the end-times and involves the tricky landing of a plane?", "correct": "Left Behind", "options": ["Looking Glass", "Con Air", "Trespass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeft Behind.\n\n\tI could have loaded this quiz with a number of Nicolas Cage movies, but I had to narrow it down and include \"Left Behind\", a weirdly preachy film that made it clear that non-believers were going to have a rough go of the apocalypse when everyone was simply going to vanish if they believed in God and remain to pick up the pieces if they sinned or didn't believe. Nicolas Cage played an airline pilot in this movie and needed to land his plane in New York when a series said disappearances occurred.  The movie was meant to follow one of the books in the Tim LaHaye series and start a trilogy (the book series spanned more than a dozen novels); the movie was regarded as propagandist schlock. \n"}]}
