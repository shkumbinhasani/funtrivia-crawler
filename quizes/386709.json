{"id": "386709", "name": "Bible Literacy 5: Jacob's Children Quiz | Religion | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "  Old Testament / Tanakh", " Genesis"], "questions": [{"text": "Who was the mother of Reuben and Simeon? ", "correct": "Leah", "options": ["Zilpah", "Rebekah ", "Bilhah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeah.\n\n\tEven though Jacob worked for, and wanted to marry Laban's daughter Rachel, Laban gave his daughter Leah to Jacob instead. According to Laban, custom called for the oldest child to be married first. Reuben and Simeon were the first two children born to Jacob from his first wife, Leah. Upon entering the Promised Land, each one of Jacob's children was given a portion of land for them and their descendants. Because Reuben was the first born, he was given the birthright, but lost it when Jacob learned that his son had committed an indiscretion with Rachel's maidservant Bilhah. His birthright was then given to his nephews, Ephraim and Manasseh. When the Israelites entered Canaan, the tribe of Reuben settled east of the Jordan River where land was fertile. Unfortunately, it also left them open for attack. \r Jacob's second son, Simeon, never got his own tribal area. Instead, he and his descendants blended in with his brother Judah's tribe. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the mother of Issachar? ", "correct": "Leah", "options": ["Zilpah", "Rachel ", "Bilhah "], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeah.\n\n\tIssachar was the ninth child for Jacob and the fifth son for Leah. Not much is known about Issachar. When Joshua was issuing land to the twelve tribes once they were in the Promised land, he gave Issachar land for his tribe that extended from Mt. Tabor to Mt. Gilboa. Issachar's land was along a trade route, which benefited the tribe. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the mother of Naphtali?

", "correct": "Leah", "options": ["Rachel ", "Bilhah", "Zilpah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeah.\n\n\tLeah was the mother of Levi. Jacob's son was very strong willed. Because of his son's temperament, Joshua spread the tribe of Levi over Israel. Even though Jacob was wary of Levi's temperament, God saw Levi's hatred of idolatry and honored Levi and his people by giving them a city in each of his brother's territories.Levi had three sons, Gershon, Kohath and Merari, who shared Levi's territories. The Levites were given the job of constructing and deconstructing the tabernacle on their way to the Promised Land. When the tribes journeyed, Levi and his family travelled in the center. For money, the Levites were given tithes from the other tribes.\n"}, {"text": "Who was the mother of Joseph and Benjamin? ", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Leah", "Bilhah", "Zilpah", "Rachel "], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tJacob worked Laban's land for fourteen years in order to marry Rachel. After thinking she was barren, Rachel gave birth to Joseph and Benjamin. She died during the birth of the youngest son, Benjamin. When Benjamin moved into the Promised land with his family, his tribe moved in between his nephew, Ephraim, and his half-brother, Judah. The tribe of Benjamin was the smallest tribe of Israel. King Saul, Mordecai, and Queen Esther were all descendants of the tribe of Benjamin. \r Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, each had a tribe, so technically they were known as the tribe of Joseph. Joseph was given a double portion because of his half-brother's indiscretion with Bilhah which lost him the birthright of a double portion of land. Joshua was a descendant of Ephraim. After directing the tribes, Joshua settled into the land given to the tribe of Ephraim. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the mother of Judah? ", "correct": "Leah", "options": ["Zilpah", "Bilhah", "Rachel "], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeah.\n\n\tJudah was the fourth son born to Jacob and Leah. Jacob saw that his son was a strong leader and his tribe would become leaders as well. Judah's tribe would lead the other tribes in battle.

David and Jesus were descendants of the tribe of Judah. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the mother of Dan? ", "correct": "Bilhah", "options": ["Leah", "Rachel ", "Zilpah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilhah.\n\n\tDan was the son of Jacob and Rachel's servant Bilhah.

The tribe of Dan slaughtered the people of Laish near Jordan's headwaters and took over the city. Their location made them susceptible to attack. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the mother of Gad and Asher? ", "correct": "Zilpah", "options": ["Leah", "Bilhah", "Rachel "], "explanation": "\n\n\nZilpah.\n\n\tZilpah was a Syrian woman that Leah and Rachel's father, Laban, gave to Leah as a  maidservant upon her marriage to Jacob. When Leah had trouble getting pregnant, she gave Zilpah to Jacob to mother a child for him. Zilpah mothered two of Jacob's children, Gad and Asher. When Jacob's son, Gad, moved into the Promised Land, he and his descendants moved into the center of Canaan. Gad's tribe was quick to defend themselves, but easily attacked. They were the first tribe to be taken hostage by the Assyrians. \r Gad's brother, Asher, moved his tribe to the coast along Mt. Carmel, north of Tyre and Sidon. When he moved his tribe, Asher didn't push any of the Canaanites out (as instructed by Joshua), so he never had full control of all of his land; however, he did have the best oil due to the olive orchard on his land. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the mother of Zebulun?
