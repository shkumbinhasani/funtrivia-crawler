{"id": "247689", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Kids' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "After a marathon session of surgery, the doctors and nurses are completely pooped.  Frank suggested that he could sleep for a week.  Margaret doesn't like this idea, however, as she claims that Frank has promised to do what with her?", "correct": "Paint her toenails", "options": ["Brush her hair", "Walk along the local stream", "Read poetry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaint her toenails.\n\n\tAfter 17 straight hours of surgery, you'd think that even Margaret's toenails could wait, but she insists that poor Frank take care of her toes.  After overhearing this 'private' conversation, a bewildered Colonel Potter turns to Hawkeye for an explanation.  'His father was a world famous manicurist,' Hawkeye jests. \n"}, {"text": "Just when you'd think our friends at the 4077th would get a rest, Radar brings news that a local orphanage is being shelled, and that the children there need to be evacuated to our favorite M*A*S*H unit.  What is the name of the nurse who runs this orphanage?", "correct": "Meg Cratty", "options": ["Bessie Thompson", "Evelyn Winters", "Trudy Perkins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeg Cratty.\n\n\tThe character Meg Cratty makes her second appearance in a 'M*A*S*H' episode here, her first was in the second season episode 'The Trial of Henry Blake'.  In that first episode, Nurse Cratty was played by Hope Summers.  In this episode, she is played by Ann Doran.  Ann Doran appeared in literally hundreds of movies and TV shows.  One very notable role for her, Mrs. Carol Stark, mother of the James Dean character in 'Rebel Without a Cause'. \n"}, {"text": "Before the children arrive, Frank has an exciting little surprise to show Margaret.  It seems that he has received a Purple Heart.  Where on his body does Frank claim to have been injured?", "correct": "Eye", "options": ["Leg", "Arm", "Abdomen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEye.\n\n\tSpecifically, Frank claims to have gotten a shell fragment in his eye the month before when some snipers riddled the camp with bullets.  It turns out that the shell fragment was an eggshell fragment, treated by Hawkeye.  Frank refuses to give back the Purple Heart despite this deception. \n"}, {"text": "When the children are being taken off of a truck, one young girl, held by Margaret, repeats the phrase 'mama san, mama san' over and over again.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMore amusingly, it's Klinger who the child refers to as 'mama san'.  'She thinks I'm a woman,' a flattered Klinger proudly comments.  This does not stop the girl from calling Klinger 'mama san' throughout the rest of the episode. \n"}, {"text": "What fun story does BJ recount to a couple of children who are going to sleep in the Swamp?", "correct": "Androcles and the Lion", "options": ["The Red Shoes", "Goldilocks and the Three Bears", "Rapunzel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndrocles and the Lion.\n\n\tBJ is very animated when he tells the ancient Roman tale of Androcles, a slave who is repaid a favor from a lion.  Androcles removed a thorn from the sore paw of a lion, and late, when both are pitted against each other in a circus, the lion recognized his friend and did not attack. \n"}, {"text": "What every day common candy item does Meg Cratty warn BJ against, because it can potentially scare the children?", "correct": "Bubble gum", "options": ["Chocolate bars", "Pixie sticks", "Mints"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBubble gum.\n\n\tMeg Cratty claims that the children become scared when bubbles are blown with bubble gum, because they think it's a person's stomach coming up.  This seems like an absurd concept, and I'm skeptical that the children are *that* naive! \n"}, {"text": "In just about every tent in the camp, some of the children are placed for the evening.  In the Officer's Club, one little girl shows off an incredible skill.  What is it?", "correct": "Piano playing", "options": ["Dancing", "Juggling", "Reading in English"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPiano playing.\n\n\t'Hey, you're real good,' Klinger says, 'I'll be you know 'Chopsticks', huh?'  Of course, she is much more advanced than that.  Klinger stops her from playing because it's time for bed, but once he leaves the tent, she returns to the piano.  Later, Frank sees her playing and resentfully says, 'Oh, stop behaving like a child.' \n"}, {"text": "After all the kids are put to bed, one young lady stumbles into camp, injured and bleeding, she has been shot in the abdomen.  To make matters worse, she's pregnant.  Who does the Cesarean section on this unfortunate young woman?", "correct": "BJ", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Frank", "Potter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBJ.\n\n\tThe bullet in her lower abdomen has fortunately missed the baby, but it does require that she have immediate surgery, which includes removal of the baby by a Cesarean section.   Along with Nurse Cratty, BJ does the honors.  Happily, both the baby and the young woman make it. \n"}, {"text": "What lullaby does Radar very sweetly sing to a tiny girl that he has had to transfer to the supply tent after more wounded arrive?", "correct": "Bye-lo Baby", "options": ["Hush Little Baby", "Rock-a-bye Baby", "All the Pretty Little Horses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBye-lo Baby.\n\n\tThe song is very sweet, containing the refrain 'bye-lo baby', and then the chorus, 'Daddy still love you, though he's gone to war'.  One of the more tender and heartwarming Radar moments. \n"}, {"text": "Frank's paranoia has gotten the best of him.  Insisting that he has been stolen from, he makes a stink in the operating room.  Father Mulcahy wrestles him out of the OR and into the prep room to wash up.  The good Father claims at this point to have been quite the boxer.  What weight class was he in?", "correct": "Featherweight", "options": ["Flyweight", "Middleweight", "Lightweight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFeatherweight.\n\n\tBefore joining the Jesuits, Father Mulcahy was training to be a featherweight boxer.  'They wanted me in Willie Pep's stable,' Father Mulcahy proudly claims.  Happily, he is able to get Frank washed up and prepped for surgery, using his physical skills!\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
