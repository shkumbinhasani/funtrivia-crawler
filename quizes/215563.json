That's 21 miles of road a day! What is this famous roadway?\n\n\tThe longer question is much more interesting, and does not require the memorization of picky numerical data. Whenever you can, avoid asking numerical questions! \n"}, {"text": "Here's a question from a quiz on cats in movies.\n\"Pyewacket was the undoubted star in a film about witchcraft, love and spells. As the film follows a modern witch's attempt to snare the man she loves with a magic spell, the talent of the feline cast member is obvious. Describing the cat's role as a \"familiar\" is a poor ploy to highlight the mere supporting roles of Kim Novak and James Stewart.\" The answer is \"Bell, Book and Candle.\" What is the best way to rewrite this question in a more interesting manner?", "correct": "This question is fine as written", "options": ["What movie starred Pyewacket?", "What was the name of the cat in the movie \"Bell, Book, and Candle\"?", "Who was Pyewacket?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThis question is fine as written.\n\n\tThis is a very well-written question. Unlike the others, it may make you interested in actually seeing the film!\rThis question comes from the quiz \"Cat Call - Top Billing Please\" by Nannanut. Like all of the good questions used in this quiz, it comes from an editor's choice quiz. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a question from a quiz on pandas.\n\"When did the first living Giant Pandas come to the UK?\" The answer is \"December 1938.\" What is the best way to rewrite this question in a more interesting manner?", "correct": "In 1938, the first animal of this kind was exported to the UK. Beloved by the citizens, his antics cheered a country at war.", "options": ["What happened in London in December, 1938?", "This question is fine as written", "What animals came to the UK for the first time in 1938?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn 1938, the first animal of this kind was exported to the UK. Beloved by the citizens, his antics cheered a country at war.\n\n\tAgain, avoid those boring numerics whenever possible! What is interesting here is the animals and the place, not the date. That panda's name was Ming, by the way, and his nickname was Baby. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a question from a quiz on general trivia.\n\"What element has a chemical symbol Ca?\" The answer is \"Calcium.\" What is the best way to rewrite this question in a more interesting manner?", "correct": "Clavicles and chalk both contain this element with the symbol Ca- what is it?", "options": ["This question is fine as written", "What is the symbol for calcium?", "What does \"Ca\" stand for?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClavicles and chalk both contain this element with the symbol Ca- what is it?.\n\n\tThis gets a bit repetitive, I know :>)\rBut again, the more interesting your questions, the better your quiz will be! Element symbol questions are some of the most boring questions there are; they must be livened up. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a true/false question from a quiz on Iowa.\n\"Charles H. Holley died February 3, 1959.\" The answer is \"T.\" What is the best way to rewrite this question as a multiple-choice question in a more interesting manner?", "correct": "On February 3, 1959, a plane crashed into an Iowa cornfield, killing all aboard. Who was among its passengers?", "options": ["On what date did Charles H. Holley, otherwise known as Buddy Holly, die in a plane crash in Iowa?", "This question is fine as written", "Who died February 3, 1959,  in a plane crash in Iowa?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn February 3, 1959, a plane crashed into an Iowa cornfield, killing all aboard. Who was among its passengers?\n\n\tIf you are like me, your first reaction to this quiz would have been, \"Who the heck is \"Charles H. Holley\"? He's *much* better known as musician Buddy Holly. The question is meaningless without other information.\rIf we used the better-written question, of course the multiple-choice answer would be \"Buddy Holly,\" not \"Charles H. Holley.\"\r\"On what date did Charles H. Holley, otherwise known as Buddy Holly, die in a plane crash in Iowa?\" isn't the best answer, because it still calls for memorization of a number, rather than the more interesting fact of who died in the cornfield. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a question from a quiz on the United States.\n\"How many states were named after Indian tribes?\" The answer is \"12.\" What is the best way to rewrite this question in a more interesting manner?", "correct": "Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri all derive their names from what origin?", "options": ["12 states are named after what?", "This question is fine as written", "Indian tribes have contributed greatly to the history of the U.S, and many words come from Indian languages.

And see, the longest question isn't always the right answer. :>)\rBy the way, the information this question gives isn't quite correct; according to http://www.shgresources.com/resources/symbols/names/statenamesorign/, while several states derive their names from Indian languages, only Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri are actually named after tribes. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a question from a quiz on protest song lyrics.\n\"Oh, it seemed innocent enough. \"Did he ever return? No he never returned. And his fate is still unlearned.\" I sang along with the catchy tune as I rode in the car with my dad. But unknowingly, at the tender age of nine, I was being seduced into singing along with a protest song written to further the candidacy of a known communist! What social injustice was the Kingston Trio protesting in their 1959 folk song, \"MTA\"?\" The answer is \"A Boston public transit fare increase.\" What is the best way to rewrite this question in a more interesting manner?", "correct": "This question is fine as written", "options": ["What is the song \"MTA\" about?", "What song was written about a public transit fare increase?", "Who sang \"MTA\"?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThis question is fine as written.\n\n\tDoesn't this question make you curious about hearing the song?

Latex is being procured for use in the manufacture of a latex balloon.
