He died in 1950 in which city, the capital of Chile?", "correct": "Santiago", "options": ["Caracas", "Quito", "Lima"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantiago.\n\n\tArturo Alessandri first came to power in 1920 as part of the Liberal Alliance, defeating his conservative opposition Luis Barros Borgono despite losing the popular vote. As his time in power progressed he struggled with a heavily conservative congress, not enabling him to enforce any of the laws he wanted to pass and so he eventually resigned in 1924 and sought asylum in the US embassy. From this point on the country was under the rule of a military Junta known as the September Junta.\r However, not all members of the Junta agreed with the way the country was being run and so in a coup in January 1925 an interim liberal president, Pedro Dartnell, was appointed, until the return of Alessandri in March 1925. On his return to power he drafted a new constitution but despite this being passed in September 1925 he resigned again in October before finally resuming the position of president in 1932. He served out a normal 6-year term before losing power to Pedro Aguirre Cerda of the Radical Party in December 1938. \n"}, {"text": "B - Next we have Benazir Bhutto, the first woman ever elected to lead a Muslim state. Which country did she lead from 1988 to 1990 and then again from 1993 to 1996?", "correct": "Pakistan", "options": ["Saudi Arabia", "Bangladesh", "Libya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPakistan.\n\n\tBenazir Bhutto was born on the 21st of June 1953 and was the eldest child of former Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Zulfikar founded the democratic socialist Pakistan People's Party (PPP) in 1967, and served as its leader until his death in 1979. From 1979 until 1983 the party was led by his wife Nusrat before their daughter Benazir took over upon Nusrat's death.\r Benazir Bhutto was first elected into the position of prime minister in 1988 following a very large swing in voting towards the PPP and away from the military government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Throughout her first two years in power she struggled against the President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who still had the power to veto any policies put forward by the prime minister. In 1990, stories of corruption appeared in the media, discrediting Benazir Bhutto, and she was eventually dismissed by Khan in August of that year.\r Bhutto was elected for a second time in 1993, narrowly ousting Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League out of the position that he'd held since 1990. However, more charges of corruption again discredited Bhutto and she was dismissed by President Farooq Leghari in 1996. She went into exile in Dubai in 1998.\r She was attempting a return to power after having lived in exile for some years when she was assassinated in a motorcade in December 2007. \n"}, {"text": "C - For whom did Coolidge act as vice president, replacing him upon his death in 1923?", "correct": "Warren G. Harding", "options": ["Theodore Roosevelt", "William McKinley", "William Howard Taft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarren G. Harding\n\n\tWarren G. Harding served as president for around two and a half years after having been a senator of Ohio for the previous six years. He convincingly beat the Democratic candidate James M. Cox in the election of 1920, gaining over 60% of the popular vote and 37 of the 48 states at the time. His term as president is often called unremarkable and many polls have voted Harding as one of the worst of all time.\r Calvin Coolidge replaced Harding upon his death in 1923. However, he was somewhat unknown to the public, having not played a great role in the Harding administration. Many expected him to be voted out in the election of 1924 but it was another comfortable victory for the Republicans, with Coolidge receiving 54% of the popular vote. He chose not to run for a second full term in the election of 1928. \n"}, {"text": "D - Domingo D\u00edaz Arosemena was president of which Central American country, whose flag consists of a red rectangle, a blue rectangle, a red star and a blue star (with each in a different quadrant), between 1948 and 1949?", "correct": "Panama", "options": ["Nicaragua", "Honduras", "Costa Rica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPanama.\n\n\tDomingo D\u00edaz Arosemena had a long political history in Panama, serving as a major as early as 1910 and also as vice president to Harmodio Arias Madrid between 1932 and 1936. He eventually became president himself after being elected as the leader of the National Liberal Party in 1948. However he served for less than a year, retiring after suffering with a heart attack in 1949 and dying shortly afterwards.\r The blue and red on the national flag represent the Conservative and Liberal parties respectively, while the white represents peace between the two. The blue star symbolises purity and honesty, while the red represents authority and law. \n"}, {"text": "Skipping E and onto F - This Spanish leader was prime minister from 1938 until 1973 as well as having a more authoritarian rule. He took many titles including 'Caudillo de Espana' which roughly translates as 'Military Dictator of Spain'. Can you name him?", "correct": "Francisco Franco & Franco", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancisco Franco & Franco.\n\n\tBefore moving into politics, Francisco Franco was very prominent in the Spanish military, moving through the ranks at an early age he became the youngest general in Europe in the 1920s. He rose to power during the Spanish Civil War as the leader of the triumphant Nationalist faction, who overcame the Republicans in the three year conflict. \r From that point onwards, Franco went on to rule Spain as a dictator for almost forty years. In 1938, he fused the far-right Falange party and the Carlist monarchist parties to form 'Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista', which he then decreed as the only legal political party. He led Spain until his death aged 82 in 1975. \n"}, {"text": "G - One of the few British prime ministers who qualifies for this quiz is George Grenville, who served as prime minister from 1763-1765. His sister Hester was married to which other prime minister, now known as 'The Elder'?", "correct": "William Pitt", "options": ["Frederick North", "Benjamin Disraeli", "Henry Addington"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Pitt.\n\n\tGeorge Grenville was prime minister of the United Kingdom for a little over two years, from April 1763 until July 1765. He was the second prime minister elected during the monarchy of George III (the first being John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, the first ever Tory prime minister), and the 8th prime minister overall. He also held the post of the Chancellor of the Exchequer during his tenure. However, he did not get along well with the King, nor was he particularly popular in Parliament and so was dismissed without serving a full term.\r In between George Grenville and Pitt the Elder, Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham was prime minister. However, he lasted a little over a year before he was dismissed, meaning that Pitt became prime minister in July 1766. \n"}, {"text": "H - The second US president that we encounter is Herbert Hoover, who actually succeeded Calvin Coolidge in 1929. In which Midwestern state was Herbert Hoover born?", "correct": "Iowa", "options": ["Connecticut", "Nebraska", "Oregon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIowa.\n\n\tEarly in his career Herbert Hoover served as head of the US Food Administration. He was then United States Secretary of Commerce under both Harding and Coolidge, where he notably promoted relations between businesses and the government. In 1928, despite having never previously had elected office experience, he was awarded the position of Republican candidate for the upcoming election. \r The Republicans won 40 of the 48 states as a result of the economic bubble at the time. However, this bubble inevitably burst when there was a huge Stock Market crash in 1929, one of the primary reasons for the Great Depression that pervaded America and the rest of the world for the following decade. On a lighter note, to keep fit Hoover played a sport of his own invention (a mix between tennis and volleyball) every morning in the White House. \n"}, {"text": "I - Ion Iliescu, who served two periods as the president of Romania, from 1989 to 1996 and then again from 2000 until 2004, was a leader in the revolution of 1989 against which other Romanian leader?", "correct": "Nicolae Ceausescu", "options": ["Emil Constantinescu", "Nicolae Vacaroiu", "Traian Basescu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNicolae Ceausescu.\n\n\tNicolae Ceausescu was the last Communist leader of Romania, and was the Head of State between 1967 and 1989, taking the title 'President of the State Council' before creating the position of president in 1974 which is the title still used today. Despite having a fairly open relationship with Western Europe and the US in his early years, he is infamous for his brutal leadership of the country later in his rule. His treatment of the Romanian people triggered the December Revolution in 1989 which saw Ceausescu and his wife executed.\r Ion Iliescu was born in 1930 and became part of the Communist Party in 1953. However, he was gradually marginalized by Ceausescu, changing his Communist views, and after Ceausescu's death in 1989 he was elected as the leader of the National Salvation Front, which filled the political void left by the loss of the Communist Party. He was therefore the natural choice for president, and took the position on Boxing Day 1989, the day after Ceausescu was shot. Capital punishment was abolished in Romania on January 7th 1990. \n"}, {"text": "J - Janet Jagan was prime minister and then president of which relatively new South American country, which gained independence from the UK in 1966?", "correct": "Guyana", "options": ["Brazil", "Bolivia", "Suriname"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuyana.\n\n\tJanet Jagan was born in the United States and served as prime minister of Guyana from March 17, 1997 until to December 19, 1997, as well as occupying the position of president from December 19, 1997 to August 11, 1999. In Guyana, the prime minister is the Head of Government while the president is the Head of State. Janet was married to fellow Guyanese politician Cheddi Jagan, who also served as president during the 1990s (1992 - 1997) as well as taking on several other roles earlier in his career. These included the position of Premier of British Guiana from 1961 to 1964. \r Despite geographically being a part of South America, Guyana is also a part of the Caribbean Community, which has its headquarters at the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. \n"}, {"text": "K - Kyosti Kallio served as prime minister no less than four times for which Scandinavian country, known for its folklore, the 'Kalevala'?", "correct": "Finland", "options": ["Norway", "Sweden", "Denmark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinland.\n\n\tKyosti Kallio had a career spanning many areas of Finnish politics. He was originally part of the Diet of Finland as a member of the Estate of Peasantry, the lowest of the four Estates (the others being Nobility, Clergy and Burghers). This was the legislative assembly of the Grand Duchy of Finland for almost a century before the reform of 1906.\r After independence from Soviet Russia in 1917, Kallio took part in the debates about the future of the country. This partly concerned whether or not the country should proceed as a republic or a monarchy, with Kallio so strongly opposed the idea of a constitutional monarchy that he resigned from the Senate in 1918. After it was decided that Finland should become a republic in 1922, Kallio returned and occupied the position of prime minister until 1924. He then held the position a subsequent three times in his career, with his final stint as prime minister coming to an end in February 1937.\r While not occupying the position of prime minister, Kyosti Kallio was Speaker of the Finnish House of Parliament no less than six times. In 1937 he was elected to become the fourth president of Finland, a position he held until he resigned due to ill health in November 1940. \n"}, {"text": "L - Italian leaders love to be alliterative, covering five different letters. However we'll only look at two in this quiz, the first of which is Luigi Luzzatti. What city was he born in, also the birthplace of composer Antonio Vivaldi and explorer Marco Polo?", "correct": "Venice", "options": ["Florence", "Rome", "Verona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVenice.\n\n\tLuigi Luzzatti held the position of prime minister of Italy from March 31, 1910 until March 30, 1911. Although the Italian prime minister is the Head of Government, as is common in many political systems, the Italian PM has less power than their international counterparts. For instance, the Italian prime minister is unable to directly dismiss ministers and must first hold a vote to do so. \r Luzzatti was only the second Jewish man ever to hold the position of prime minister, the first being Alessandro Fortis, who occupied the post between 1905 and 1906. Both of these men served under the monarchy of King Victor Emmanuel III. He was a member of the House of Savoy, and his reign began in July 1900 upon the death of his father Umberto I. His time in power lasted 46 years, seeing Italy pass through both of the World Wars. \n"}, {"text": "M - Which man became president of Egypt on 30th June 2012 after defeating Ahmed Shafik and winning the popular vote with 51 .73%?", "correct": "Mohamed Morsi", "options": ["Mahmoud Mekki", "Mohamed Mubarak", "Muhammad Maguib"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMohamed Morsi.\n\n\tMohamed Morsi was first elected to political office in 2000, when he became an 'independent' Member of Parliament (as members of the Muslim Brotherhood could not run). In 2011, the Freedom and Justice Party was formed and Morsi became the first leader of the party. In the election of 2012 he narrowly defeated the independent candidate Ahmed Shafik to become the first Islamist to hold the position of Head of State in the Arab world.\r Mahmoud Mekki became vice president at the same time as Morsi's presidency began. However he resigned from the post in December 2012, after which the position was abolished. Muhammad Naguib, not Muhammad Maguib, was a key leader in the revolution of 1952 and served as the first president of Egypt after the country became a republic in 1953. Mohamed Mubarak is not an Egyptian political figure, although Hosni Mubarak was president for 20 years before being overthrown in 2011. \n"}, {"text": "Skipping N and onto O - Olusegun Obasanjo served as head of state of which African country shortly after a military coup in 1975? He also led the country as president from 1999 until 2007, and was succeeded by Umaru Yar'Adua.", "correct": "Nigeria", "options": ["Uganda", "Namibia", "Burkina Faso"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNigeria.\n\n\tOlusegun Obasanjo was born in 1937 and enlisted in the Nigerian Army in 1958 at the age of 21. Although he was not heavily involved in the military coup of July 1975, he was appointed to the position of vice president under the leader of the coup Murtala Mohammed. In 1976, there was a plot to assassinate Obasanjo, Mohammed and other military leaders in order to take control of the country, although this was ultimately unsuccessful as only Mohammed was killed and Olusegun Obasanjo survived.\r One of the important generals who was not assassinated was Theophilus Danjuma. Between him and Obasanjo the military eventually regained control of the country before appointing Obasanjo as the Head of State, as well as holding the rather impressive title 'Head of the Federal Military Government of Nigeria'. Nigeria returned to a civilian president in October 1979 with the election of Shehu Shagari. Olusegun Obasanjo went on to become president between 1999 until 2007. \n"}, {"text": "P - Next up is the the only Belgian in the quiz.

Later in life he was also a professor at the university. He was a member of the Catholic Party in Belgium and held several political posts, including Arts and Science Minister and Internal Minister, before eventually becoming prime minister in June 1925. However, he occupied the position for less than a year before being replaced by fellow Catholic Henri Jaspar in May 1926.\r Leuven is the capital of the Flemish Brabant province and is home to the headquarters of the world's largest brewer company Anheuser-Busch InBev, who produce many household named beers such as Budweiser, Beck's and Corona. Marktrock was first held in 1982 and attracted acts such as Snoop Dogg and Kanye West to the 2007 edition. \n"}, {"text": "Skipping Q and onto R - We have Ronald Reagan, who was in office from 1981 until 1989 when he was succeeded by George H.

Upon switching to the Republican Party in 1962 he said \"I didn't leave the Democrat Party. The part left me\". He then went on to become the Governor of California between 1967 and 1975 before challenging the incumbent Gerald Ford for the leadership of the Republican Party in the election of 1976. However, Gerald Ford held his place as leader of the Republican Party but lost the election to the Democrat Jimmy Carter. Reagan went on to be the Republican candidate for the following election, winning the Presidency and serving two full terms. \n"}, {"text": "S - The other Italian in this quiz is Sidney Sonnino, who was prime minister of Italy for two short periods early in the 20th century. He was one of the first statesmen ever to fly in a plane thanks to which aviating pioneer who visited Rome in 1909?", "correct": "Wilbur Wright", "options": ["Joseph-Michel Montgolfier", "Charles Lindbergh", "Chuck Yeager"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilbur Wright.\n\n\tSidney Sonnino was born in 1847 to a father of Jewish heritage and a Welsh mother. However, he was not raised in a Jewish environment as was brought up a Protestant. Before becoming prime minister, he led a varied life, carrying out political research in Sicily and then founding a newspaper in 1878. His career in politics began in the 1880s and he became Italy's Finance Minister in 1893. \r He had two brief periods in the position of prime minister, firstly in 1906, and then for four months from December 1909 to March 1910.

Ieremia Tabai became the first president of Kiribati on the 12th of July 1979 after the small island nation gained it's independence from the UK. During Tabai's time as president, Teatao Teannaki held the position of vice president. \r However, in 1991, Teannaki was narrowly elected to become leader of the National Progressive Party, the party from which both men came. This mean that Teatao Teannaki took over as president for the next 3 years before he lost to Teburoro Tito in the general election of 1994. Although Teannaki officially held the position of president during his tenure, many suggest that he was heavily leaned on by Ieremia Tabai, who was still present in government as Foreign Minister. \n"}, {"text": "Skipping U and onto V - Vaira Vike-Freiberga served as the first female president of which Baltic country, serving between 1999 and 2007?", "correct": "Latvia", "options": ["Estonia", "Russia", "Denmark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLatvia.\n\n\tVaira Vike-Freiberga was elected as the sixth president of Latvia in 1999, the second since the formation of the Republic of Latvia in 1991.

He spent several decades as an academic, including holding the post of president of Princeton, before becoming a politician. He was the Democrat candidate for the position of Governor of New Jersey in 1910 and won the election, defeating the Republican Vivian M. Lewis.

The League of Nations was essentially replaced by the United Nations at the end of the war. \n"}, {"text": "Skipping X and onto Y - Yuriy Yekhanurov was prime minister of Ukraine from 2005-2006.
