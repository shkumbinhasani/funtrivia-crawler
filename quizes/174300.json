{"id": "174300", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'It Happened One Night' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "The episode opens in the Swamp, where Hawkeye snoozes happily despite the chilling weather outside.  His gentle slumber is rudely interrupted by Radar, who informs Hawkeye that his shift in the post-op is about to begin.  Before heading to post-op, Hawkeye takes a detour to the mess tent where he finds Klinger complaining about a correspondence with which of the following individuals?", "correct": "General MacArthur", "options": ["His wife, Laverne", "Harry Truman", "General Eisenhower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneral MacArthur.\n\n\tIt seems that Klinger has sent a picture of himself wearing a garter belt to General MacArthur, in hopes of expediting his Section Eight.  Klinger suspects that MacArthur didn't even look at the picture, having received in return a photo of MacArthur smoking a pipe.  Hawkeye suggests that MacArthur got the better deal, which I happen to agree with...after all, it's obvious that MacArthur didn't have to look at Klinger in his garter belt. \n"}, {"text": "Radar's next duty is to wake up Margaret, always a daunting task.  After wading through her drying laundry Radar gently taps Margaret on her arm in an attempt to wake her.  Rather than awakening, however, Margaret smiles and addresses Radar by what term of endearment?", "correct": "Animal", "options": ["Snookums", "Monkey", "Babycakes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnimal.\n\n\tMargaret clutches her copy of the book 'Kindled Flame' while snoozing soundly when Radar enters her tent.  After his tapping and her 'animal' response, Radar says with a smirk, 'It's just me ma'am.'  Margaret is startled awake and angrily shouts, 'Are you crazy?  How long have you been standing there looking at me?'  Radar responds, 'Not long, really!  Just a little long. Honest!'  Margaret then shouts, 'Get out of here you little creep, pervert you!  Get out!  You're not the first one in this man's army to drool over me with your hot little non-com breath!'  Radar answers, 'I didn't!  I never breathe around you!'  Radar then becomes entangled in Margaret's various undergarments during his hasty retreat. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Margaret eventually converge at the post-op, where Frank has been waiting impatiently for them to relieve him.  Frank takes them around the tent to view the various patients.  They especially stop in from of BJ's patient, a certain Private Edwards.  What special problem makes Edward's case unique?", "correct": "He has already used up 10 units of whole blood", "options": ["He angrily refuses further treatment from the doctors", "He is not able to take any liquids or food", "He has a severe case of frostbite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has already used up 10 units of whole blood.\n\n\tEdwards has extremely low blood pressure (80 over 50) and has used up 10 units of blood, an excessively high amount.  BJ warns Hawkeye particularly about this case before Hawkeye leaves the Swamp at the beginning of the episode.  Something tells me that the Edwards' case will be revisited later in the show. \n"}, {"text": "Just as Frank exits the post-op, he hears a 'psst' coming from behind the door.  Much to his pleasure, it's Margaret with a tiny little love note.  After reading the note, what does Frank do that bothers Margaret just a little bit?", "correct": "He tears it up into tiny pieces", "options": ["He crumples it up and stuffs it in a garbage can", "He burns it with a match", "He sticks it in his mouth and eats it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe tears it up into tiny pieces.\n\n\tMargaret's note suggest something to the effect that she is 'dying to keep Frank warm'.  Frank is tickled to read the note, but tears it up into bits after having perused it briefly.  Margaret is quite irritated at this, claiming that the notes contain her 'feelings'.  She also adds that she has saved every note Frank has ever written to her, the wrong thing to say to a married paranoid! \n"}, {"text": "A certain young Private Jenkins has been stationed at the 4077th and one of his first duties is to serve as night watchman on this chilly evening.  Young Jenkins immediately gets himself into trouble, accidentally shooting which member of the outfit?", "correct": "Klinger", "options": ["Frank", "Radar", "BJ"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger.\n\n\tNearly every regular member of the regular 'M*A*S*H' suffered a bullet wound during the long run of the show and Klinger is no exception.  Fortunately for Maxwell Q. Klinger his bullet wound is merely a scratch, though by his histrionics you would think that he is drawing his last breath.  Klinger claims to see his life pass before him and says 'goodbye' to various members of his family.  Meanwhile, Hawkeye and Margaret become skeptical when they see the tiny wound, the former asking, 'Could you at least bleed?' \n"}, {"text": "During the incident with the love note between Margaret and Frank, Margaret informs Frank that she has kept every love note he has ever written her.  This doesn't sit well with Frank, and he decides to raid her tent in search of the letters he has written.  Naturally, Frank's paranoia provide the viewer with some good laughs.  At one point Frank discovers what men's clothing item that doesn't appear to fit him?", "correct": "Boxer shorts", "options": ["Undershirt", "Jockstrap", "Pants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoxer shorts.\n\n\tFrank's lustful onslaught of Margaret's tent leaves no dresser or drawer unturned.  In the first rummaging scene he only stops long enough to examine a pair of men's army green boxer shorts that are very obviously several sizes too big for Frank's waste.  Though his search momentarily falls into abeyance as he sizes himself with the shorts, Frank's jealousy is soon overcome by his paranoia, and the search begins anew. \n"}, {"text": "While the cold weather rages and Frank rummages, the area surrounding the 4077th is being bombarded by friendly fire.  Colonel Potter is awakened several times, chatting with various army officers in the hopes that the shelling will cease.  Which type of officer does Potter insist can't be trusted?", "correct": "Colonels", "options": ["Majors", "Lieutenants", "Generals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColonels.\n\n\tPotter first talks with an anonymous major, but gets no satisfaction as the shelling continues.  He then gets ahold of a certain Colonel Clayburn, whom he refers to as a 'jackass' following their brief telephone conversation.  The Colonel's ironic statement ('Damn colonels, can't trust any of 'em!') is made when the shelling continues even after his conversation with Clayburn.  Naturally, he is not including himself amongst the undependable masses of colonels. \n"}, {"text": "One patient requires immediate surgery during this frigid evening, but unfortunately the 4077th has run low on blood supply.  The doctors are about to begin a search for more of a certain blood type they require, but Klinger announces himself to be a match.  What is Klinger's blood type?", "correct": "B-positive", "options": ["O-negative", "AB-negative", "A-positive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nB-positive.\n\n\tAfter being treated for his massive shoulder wound (well, maybe not so massive), Klinger attempts to freeze himself to death by going out into the cold wearing only his boxer shorts.  He is returned to his hospital bed after chickening out in this Section Eight ploy, and overhears a conversation between BJ and Hawkeye about Private Edwards. BJ needs to open Edwards up again, but all of the B-positive blood has been used up.  Klinger heroically announces himself to be a match, proving once again that, though he desperately wants out of the army, he is always willing to make a brave effort when it counts. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the episode Margaret and Hawkeye have to deal with a very recalcitrant patient who constantly panics each time the shelling starts.  After finally sedating the patient after the young fellow bites Hawkeye's arm, Margaret and Hawkeye congratulate each other.  At that moment a can which has been heating on the furnace in the post-op explodes, spewing what foodstuff across the tent?", "correct": "Beans", "options": ["Stew", "Spaghetti sauce", "Clam chowder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeans.\n\n\tHawkeye and Margaret are virtually covered in the beans.  Hawkeye takes a bit off Margaret's nose and tastes it.  He proclaims, '1943...a very good year for beans.'  In the following scene, BJ is congratulated by Hawkeye and Margaret for successfully operating on Edwards (for the second time) as they walk Margaret to her tent. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret enters her tent after a grueling evening in the post-op, only to find Frank asleep on the floor and her tent a hideous mess.  What does Frank claim to have been searching for in his ransacking of Margaret's tent?   ", "correct": "A pencil", "options": ["His shoes", "A picture of Margaret", "A book"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pencil.\n\n\tFrank apparently has not found his love letters to Margaret, but he has become quite familiar with Margaret's pillow, which he embraces in his slumber.  Frank also holds paper in his hand, claiming to have wanted to write Margaret a note...thus his need for a pencil.  This is one of the last straws for Frank (the other being when he calls Margaret an 'old war horse' and 'army mule'!)  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will attempt my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
