{"id": "217336", "name": "Amazing NBA Scoring Feats Trivia Quiz | Basketball | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "  Basketball", "    NBA Records"], "questions": [{"text": "During the 1964-65 season, not one but two players on the Los Angeles Lakers scored over 2,000 points, marking the first time this accomplishment had been achieved.  Who were these two players?", "correct": "Jerry West and Elgin Baylor", "options": ["John Havlicek and Wilt Chamberlain", "Jerry West and John Havlicek", "Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJerry West and Elgin Baylor.\n\n\tDuring that year, West scored 2,292 points, followed closely by Elgin Baylor's 2,009.  The feat wasn't repeated until the 1972-73 season when Atlanta's Pete Maravich (2,063) and Lou Hudson (2,029) also both managed to surpass the magic 2,000 point plateau. \n"}, {"text": "When watching NBA games, it is a great pleasure to see a very close game that ends with a one or two point margin.  However, there is also a strange, almost sadistic pleasure in watching a game end with a huge, blowout margin.  Such a situation occurred on December 17, 1991, when the Cleveland Cavaliers crushed which new NBA team by 68 points?", "correct": "Miami Heat", "options": ["Charlotte Hornets", "Minnesota Timberwolves", "Vancouver Grizzlies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiami Heat.\n\n\tThe final score on that fateful night was 148-80, the largest blowout at that time in history.  On February 27, 1998, the Indiana Pacers massacred the Portland Trailblazers 124-59, a 65-point victory, just shy of the record! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these NBA players scored a disgusting 4,029 points in a single NBA season?", "correct": "Wilt Chamberlain", "options": ["Michael Jordan", "Hakeem Olajuwon", "Oscar Robertson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilt Chamberlain.\n\n\tWilt Chamberlain's 4,029 points scored during the 1961-62 season is all the more remarkable when you discover that it took him only 80 games to achieve it.  His scoring average for the season was 50.4 points per game.  Michael Jordan's highest career scoring average was a paltry 37.1 points per game during the 1986-87 season, when he scored a total of 3,041 points. \n"}, {"text": "During the 1981-82 season, one NBA team managed to score at least 100 points in every single game.  Which team was this?", "correct": "Denver Nuggets", "options": ["Houston Rickets", "Detroit Pistons", "Utah Jazz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDenver Nuggets.\n\n\tAh, the high flying, fast running 1981-82 Denver Nuggets.  That team broke so many scoring records, it is difficult to select the most amazing ones.  In my view, their 126.5 points per game was the team's most eye-popping achievement. \n"}, {"text": "Michael Jordan played a total of 15 NBA seasons.  How many times did his regular season scoring average dip below 20 points per game?", "correct": "0", "options": ["2", "3", "4"], "explanation": "\n\n\n0.\n\n\tMichael Jordan's lowest scoring average for a season was during his final year in the league (2002-03) when he averaged exactly 20.0 points per game.  His career scoring average during the regular season was 30.1 points per game.  Heck, he even managed to average 20.2 points per all-star game! \n"}, {"text": "It is difficult to find NBA scoring records that are not held by either Wilt Chamberlain or Michael Jordan.  One that pops out, however, is the remarkable accomplishment of which NBA player who scored 1,000 or more points for the 19th time in his career during the 1987-88 season?", "correct": "Kareem Abdul Jabbar", "options": ["George Gervin", "Moses Malone", "Rick Barry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKareem Abdul Jabbar.\n\n\tTalk about staying power.  Kareem averaged over 1,000 points per game for 19 consecutive seasons, only failing to garner the magic number during his final season (1988-89: 748 points).  He did receive some nice parting gifts during that final season, however, as he made his last round through the various NBA cities. \n"}, {"text": "Let us move toward some more ignoble scoring achievements now.  On April 6, 1997, which team managed to score only two points (yes, two points) in the third quarter against the Lakers?", "correct": "Dallas Mavericks", "options": ["Boston Celtics", "Seattle Supersonics", "Minnesota Timberwolves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDallas Mavericks.\n\n\tOuch.  The Lakers managed to win the game 87-80 over the hapless Mavericks.  On February 8, 2004 the Golden State Warriors shared the Mavericks' ineptitude, managing only a single basket (that is two points, folks) in the fourth quarter of a loss to the Toronto Raptors.  While the Dallas-Lakers game was at Los Angeles, the Warriors managed this feat at home in Oakland. \n"}, {"text": "In an April 10, 1999 game that many NBA fans probably relished, which former high-flying NBA team tossed in a measly 49 points against the Miami Heat?", "correct": "Chicago Bulls", "options": ["Houston Rockets", "Los Angeles Lakers", "Boston Celtics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChicago Bulls.\n\n\tYes, indeed, those reigning NBA champions the Chicago Bulls (less one Michael Jordan, of course) burned the nets during their 82-49 loss to the Heat.  Remarkably, two Bulls players, namely Tony Kukoc and Kornell David (who?) managed to reach double figures, scoring 10 and 13 points, respectively. \n"}, {"text": "Has it ever occurred in NBA history that a team has gone scoreless for an entire overtime period?", "correct": "yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nyes.\n\n\tYou bet it has, all too many times in fact.  Perhaps the saddest example of this accomplishment came on January 13, 1997, when the Charlotte Hornets routed the Denver Nuggets 2-0 in the overtime period of their game.  Certainly the Charlotte locker room was in a frenzy after that one. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most exciting games in NBA history occurred on December 13, 1983, when the Detroit Pistons outlasted the Denver Nuggets after three overtimes.  Final score: 186-184.  How many players scored 40 points or more during that game?", "correct": "4", "options": ["0", "2", "6"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4.\n\n\tFor Detroit, Isaiah Thomas scored 47 points, while John Long had 41.  The Nuggets also had two players with over 40 points, namely Kiki Vandeweghe with 51 and Alex English with 47.  That kind of defines the Nuggets of that era.  Exciting scoring contests but they just couldn't quite get over the hump and win it all. \n"}]}
