{"id": "219231", "name": "\"M*A*S*H\" - \"Five O'Clock Charlie\" Online Trivia | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "The episode opens at 4:57 pm (\"three minutes to Charlie\") as Radar is mobbed by people trying to place bets. Even Father Mulcahy wants in on the action, although he promises to donate any winnings to what charity?", "correct": "the Bible fund", "options": ["the Shriners", "Sister Margaret's orphanage", "the Red Cross"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe Bible fund.\n\n\tA flustered Radar responds \"Oh, me too,\" realizes his mistake, and awkwardly looks elsewhere while Father Mulcahy finishes writing his name and bet (on 40 yards). Unfortunately for the Bible fund, 40 yards was not the lucky distance. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Trapper prepare to watch Charlie in action, donning bathrobes, grabbing lawnchairs, and affecting terrible British accents. What does Hawkeye carry in place of a walking stick?", "correct": "a golf club", "options": ["a gun", "a lightsaber", "a tree branch"], "explanation": "\n\n\na golf club.\n\n\tHawkeye gets excellent mileage out of the golf club; it not only supports him on the short walk to the ammo dump, but is useful for intimidating Frank and pointing at Charlie. Trapper and Hawkeye also carry martinis, of course. \n"}, {"text": "As Charlie's plane wobbles toward the ammunition dump, the camp announcer welcomes him: \"Now in his sixth hit week, Five O'Clock Charlie, his airplane, and his\" what?", "correct": "astigmatism", "options": ["parachute", "well-wound wristwatch", "swell aviator's scarf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nastigmatism.\n\n\tAn astigmatism is a defect in the shape of the eyeball, in which the eye is shaped more like an American football than like a sphere. Since it causes distorted and blurry vision, it's a reasonable diagnosis for Charlie, who shows up at 5 o'clock every day to drop a bomb on the ammo dump ... and misses by dozens of yards every time. \n"}, {"text": "Naturally, Frank is apoplectic about Charlie's regular visits, and he demands an anti-aircraft gun. Who does he think should fire it when it arrives?", "correct": "Himself, since he has \"some gunnery experience\" from the R.O.T.C.", "options": ["Corporal Klinger, since maybe a more \"manly\" job will change his mind about wanting a discharge.", "Major Houlihan, since she has a keen eye and a cool grip.", "Colonel Blake, since after all he is in command."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHimself, since he has \"some gunnery experience\" from the R.O.T.C.\n\n\tFrank can be extremely persistent! During Henry's phone call with General Clayton (who wants to know how his bet turned out), he presents the Colonel with a book turned to the page of the gun he wants. Unfortunately, the book is turned upside down, so Henry inadvertently requests a \"nug\". General Clayton agrees to visit the 4077th the next day, to assess the situation. \n"}, {"text": "General Clayton arrives at the 4077th to determine whether or not they really need an anti-aircraft gun (and, of course, to watch Charlie -- after all, he has a bet!) With whom is he particularly anxious to \"discuss\" the matter?", "correct": "Hot Lips Houlihan", "options": ["Frank Burns", "Henry Blake", "Trapper MacIntyre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHot Lips Houlihan.\n\n\tFrank really does want to discuss the gun with the General, but Clayton has eyes only for Hot Lips. Apparently he has frequent \"discussions\" with her -- every time he visits the 4077th, in fact. They agree to meet in private later that night. \n"}, {"text": "Just after Five O'Clock Charlie's run, General Clayton decides that the 4077th does, in fact, need the gun. Why?", "correct": "Because Charlie bombs the General's jeep.", "options": ["Because Charlie actually comes close to hitting the ammo dump.", "Because Charlie shouts personal insults from the airplane.", "Because Trapper and Hawkeye make a persuasive argument."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause Charlie bombs the General's jeep.\n\n\tIt's fortunate that the jeep is unoccupied! Charlie isn't aiming for the Jeep, of course, but anything remotely in the area of his target is in danger. Clayton had previously ignored the argument that there was a war on -- \"I read the papers,\" he told Frank -- but now it's personal. \n"}, {"text": "Frank forms a platoon of Local Indigenous Personnel to help him operate the gun. How many people are in this platoon?", "correct": "3", "options": ["12", "1", "6"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tFrank names one the platoon leader, one the squad leader, and the third is, well, the squad. He also shows off his talent for casual racism here, while lecturing the platoon about Charlie's weaknesses: \"The enemy, very foolishly, attacks at the same time every day. There is no element of surprise! The man does not possess an ounce of cleverness, which shows you the limitation of Korean thinking ...\" Cue a bemused look from the Korean platoon leader, who we have just learned is fluent in English, French and Italian in addition to his native tongue. \n"}, {"text": "As he takes his platoon through a dry run with the gun, Frank pulls his pistol, only to find that Hawkeye and Trapper have replaced it with what?", "correct": "a small plunger", "options": ["a sunflower", "a candy cane", "a water gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\na small plunger.\n\n\tThis is a running gag throughout the episode: in the beginning, they replace Frank's pistol with a water gun (having sold the original gun in order to buy lawn chairs), and towards the end they replace it with a toy gun that displayed a \"BANG!\" flag when \"fired\". Frank is not amused, but this viewer sure is! \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Trapper, assisted by the dentist, decide to get rid of the ammo dump in order to prevent Frank from shooting down Charlie. What supplies do they need to make sure that Charlie cannot possibly miss on his next run?", "correct": "48 sheets and 18 gallons of Mercurochrome", "options": ["25 parachutes and 25 gallons of paint", "108 light bulbs and a generator", "3000 yards of reflective tape and a floodlight"], "explanation": "\n\n\n48 sheets and 18 gallons of Mercurochrome.\n\n\tThey take the sheets from a flustered Nurse Klein; she tries to insist that she can't possibly give them so many, but they tell her they've \"just met four dozen amazing women\". They use the sheets to make several large arrows pointing to the ammo dump; as a crowning touch they cover the dump itself with sheets, using the Mercurochrome to paint a gigantic bull's eye on the top. \n"}, {"text": "What eventually happens to the ammo dump?", "correct": "Frank's soldiers accidentally destroy it with anti-aircraft fire meant for Charlie.", "options": ["It remains at the same location until the supply is exhausted; it isn't replenished.", "Charlie finally manages to destroy it with a bomb.", "General Clayton agrees to move it away from the hospital."], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank's soldiers accidentally destroy it with anti-aircraft fire meant for Charlie.\n\n\tAlthough Hawkeye and Trapper have clearly marked the ammo dump for him, Charlie misses again and starts heading for home. Frank is frantically trying to help his soldiers aim and fire the anti-aircraft gun as Charlie retreats; Hawkeye \"helpfully\" confuses them by shouting random numbers as they try to get their bearings. Trapper, meanwhile, taunts Frank into giving the order to fire prematurely, despite the protests of the Korean platoon leader -- and there goes the ammo dump. I hope you've enjoyed this quiz even a hundredth as much as I enjoyed the episode! \n"}]}
