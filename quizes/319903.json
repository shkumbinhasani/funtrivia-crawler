{"id": "319903", "name": "Timothy Quiz | Christian People / Saints | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "Christian People / Saints", "New Testament People"], "questions": [{"text": "What does Timothy's name mean?", "correct": "One Who Honors God", "options": ["Lover of Women", "Keeper of Peace", "Disciple of Christ"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne Who Honors God.\n\n\tThe Greek name \"Timothy\" is Timotheoi.  It is pronounced \"tim-oh-thee-oy\". \n"}, {"text": "Before Paul chose Timothy to travel with him, where did Timothy call home?", "correct": "Lystra", "options": ["Jerusalem", "Uz", "Gadara"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLystra.\n\n\tTimothy lived in Lystra at the time of the apostle Paul's coming through during his second missionary journey.  He was, according to Acts 16:2, \"well reported on by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium\". \n"}, {"text": "Timothy's mother and grandmother, whom he lived with, were both Jews, but of what ethnicity was his father?", "correct": "Greek", "options": ["Hebrew", "Persian", "Egyptian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreek.\n\n\tHis mother's name was Eunice, and his grandmother's name was Lois (2 Timothy 1:5).  Eunice and Lois taught Timothy of the holy writings, which his father did not approve of.  His father's name was not mentioned anywhere in the Scriptures. \n"}, {"text": "When Paul left Beroea, whom did he leave to work with Timothy in caring for the congregation?", "correct": "Silas", "options": ["Apollos", "Herod", "Simon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilas.\n\n\tAccording to Acts 17:13,14, Silas stayed behind with Timothy when Paul was facing persecution.  Timothy and Silas did not stay in Beroea long, however, because Paul had somewhere else he wanted to send Timothy. \n"}, {"text": "While in Beroea, Timothy got word from Paul to travel somewhere else to help out the congregation.  Where did Timothy travel next?", "correct": "Thessalonica", "options": ["Philippi", "Galatia", "Corinth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThessalonica.\n\n\tIn his first letter to the Thessalonians, Paul told them that he had sent Timothy \"in order to make you firm and comfort you in behalf of your faith\".  The Scripture where Paul mentioned that Timothy would be coming to Thessalonica is found at 1 Thessalonians 3:1-3. \n"}, {"text": "While Paul was in Ephesus, he sent Timothy to preach in what congregation?", "correct": "Corinth", "options": ["Thessalonica", "Philippi", "Galatia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorinth.\n\n\tIn 1 Corinthians 4:17, Paul might have said he was sending Timothy to Corinth, but whether Timothy actually went to Corinth is unknown.  In 1 Corinthians 16:10, Paul says \"IF Timothy arrives\".  In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul never mentions of Timothy's having been there, as he had with all his other letters to the congregations where Timothy had previously served.  Had Timothy been to Corinth, it would have been before he left for Macedonia, where he was with Paul when Paul wrote the second letter to the Corinthians. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout his journeys, Timothy had frequent bouts of illness.  What ailment did Timothy suffer from?", "correct": "Stomach sickness", "options": ["Difficulty breathing", "Constant headaches", "Lightheadedness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStomach sickness.\n\n\tTimothy was constantly having stomach problems.  We know this because of 1 Timothy 5:23, which states \"Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness\".  This was from Paul's letter to Timothy. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these letters did Paul NOT mention Timothy in his salutations?", "correct": "Ephesians", "options": ["Philippians", "Colossians", "Thessalonians"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEphesians.\n\n\tEphesians 1:1 only mentions Paul in his greetings to the congregation in Ephesus.  Paul's letters to Philippi, Colossae, and Thessalonica all mention Timothy's name.  The Thessalonians also mention Silvanus, or Silas.  Timothy was also mentioned in the greetings to the letter to the congregation in the house of Philemon.  All greetings can be found in the first few verses of the letters to the congregations. \n"}, {"text": "Paul was imprisoned a lot more often than Timothy, but Timothy was imprisoned with Paul, some, too.  Where were they both imprisoned for a majority of the time?", "correct": "Rome", "options": ["Patmos", "Athens", "Sicily"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRome.\n\n\tIt is possible both Paul and Timothy were locked away elsewhere, but for the most part, they spent their imprisonment in Rome.  The Romans did not appreciate Paul and Timothy's preaching work, which is why they spent so much time there in prison.  John, who wrote John, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, and Revelation, wrote these books while imprisoned on Patmos. \n"}, {"text": "On his way to Macedonia, Timothy was accompanied by Paul, Silas, and one of the Gospel writers.  Who was a faithful companion of Paul and Timothy?", "correct": "Luke", "options": ["Mark", "Matthew", "John"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuke.\n\n\tLuke was a physician who wrote the books of Luke and Acts.  It makes sense, then, how Luke was able to write Acts, since most of Paul's account can be found in Acts.  Luke is referred to in Acts indirectly by using the words we and us.  Since he wrote Acts, it would stand to reason that he was with Paul and Timothy at the time he wrote about. \n"}]}
