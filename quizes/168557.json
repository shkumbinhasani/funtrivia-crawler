{"id": "168557", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Dear Sigmund' Quiz / Test | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 5 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "'Dear Sigmund' opens in the Swamp, where, you guessed it, the M*A*S*H-ites are playing a game of poker.  Which of these individuals is not part of the game?", "correct": "Colonel Potter", "options": ["Margaret", "Radar", "Sidney Freedman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColonel Potter.\n\n\tOf course, Sidney is playing (I hope you read the introduction to the quiz!) and, surprisingly, Margaret has joined in, a first for her on the series.  Colonel Potter is not present, and Frank Burns is also not to be found (Margaret probably chased him out.)  Sidney claims that he has come to the 4077th as a way to regain his health, and calls the place a 'spa'.  Don't let Hawkeye read that letter, Sidney! \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye is Dr. Freedman's first 'case' in his letter to Sigmund Freud.  As Sidney describes Hawkeye, the scene shifts to the post-op, where the crazed doctor has entered wearing a suit, a safari hat, and what items on his feet?", "correct": "Diving flippers", "options": ["Mukluks", "Snowshoes", "Tap-dancing shoes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiving flippers.\n\n\tSidney describes Hawkeye as having a 'personality that had split two for one' while making the rounds in post-op.  This is one of those scenes that separates the Hawkeye lovers from the Hawkeye haters, I would imagine. \n"}, {"text": "Sidney calls his next subject Klinger an 'interesting case'.  We are taken outdoors where everyone's favorite Lebanese corporal is making yet another attempt to convince Colonel Potter that he's crazy.  What is Klinger's Section Eight scheme for this episode?", "correct": "Klinger is 'hit by a chopper blade' and can only speak Arabic", "options": ["Klinger decides he will eat an entire jeep", "Klinger becomes Zoltan, King of the Gypsies", "Klinger gets 'amnesia', believing he's a salesman back in Toledo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger is 'hit by a chopper blade' and can only speak Arabic.\n\n\tKlinger calls Colonel Potter 'grandfather' and then says, 'may your pomegranates grow as big as the Queen's fanny', all in Arabic, of course.  When Potter doesn't buy this dodge, Klinger proclaims, 'May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your armpits', again in Arabic. \n"}, {"text": "The next section of Sidney's letter is dedicated to an apparent 'mad joker' who has played a rash of practical jokes on the camp.  How does the practical joker 'get' Colonel Potter?", "correct": "Puts black ink in Potter's binoculars", "options": ["Cuts out the fanny of Potter's trousers", "Puts shaving cream in Potter's toothpaste", "Puts a snake in Potter's bed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuts black ink in Potter's binoculars.\n\n\tAs you might have noticed, the other jokes listed occurred in other episodes.  In this episode, however, the joke is on Potter when he uses his ink-colored binoculars, resulting in black circles forming around his eyes.  Radar is extremely tickled, needless to say.  A joke is also pulled on Frank Burns, who unwittingly sits on a bench in the mess tent under which the legs have been sawed off. \n"}, {"text": "From this jocularity, the show becomes more subdued when Hawkeye encounters a limping young soldier, arriving by horse-cart, who performs what function in the war?", "correct": "Bomber pilot", "options": ["Minesweeper", "Interrogator", "Machine-gunner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBomber pilot.\n\n\tHawkeye finds that this young pilot is quite nonchalant about his work, not even having seen the people he bombs.  Hawkeye decides to teach the young man a lesson by bringing him into the OR, where he watches Potter perform surgery on a young girl who has been injured by a bomb.  When the pilot asks whose bomb did the damage, Potter responds, 'What difference does that make?'  The pilot responds, 'A lot.  It makes a lot of difference.' Potter retorts, 'Not to her.' \n"}, {"text": "Sidney is confronted by Hawkeye and BJ in the Swamp about his letter (which they naturally decided to read without permission) and about the fact that he has been at the camp for two weeks.  Following his explanation, Frank, who has overheard the conversation, responds to Sidney with ridicule.  As if by karma, Frank is then victimized by what sort of practical joke?", "correct": "Eggs in his helmet", "options": ["Chocolate in his pillow", "Oatmeal in his boots", "Chloroform in his cologne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEggs in his helmet.\n\n\tThe true reason for Sidney's stay at the 4077th involves a young patient who decided to kill himself.  Frank's unsympathetic response to Sidney's heart-to-heart chat with Hawkeye and BJ is paid back in kind when he places his helmet upon his head, only to find himself covered in crushed eggs.  This scene always disturbed me because in a later episode, eggs are seen as a rare and delicious commodity...what happened?! \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the 4077th personnel does Dr. Sidney Freedman describe as a 'natural therapist'?", "correct": "Mulcahy", "options": ["BJ", "Potter", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMulcahy.\n\n\tSidney marvels at Father Mulcahy's fascinating personality.  According to Dr. Freedman, the Father is 'shy and studious', but 'he's got a left hook that could stop a truck'.  Mulcahy convinces a young man who has just been in an ambulance accident, and doesn't want to get back in a moving vehicle, that he must get over his fear. \n"}, {"text": "Freedman describes Margaret as an interesting woman, disciplined but passionate.  The scene shifts to the Swamp, where Margaret is attempting to console the depressed Sidney.  The conversation is interrupted when Margaret spots what 'offensive' object on the bed next to the good psychiatrist?", "correct": "Athletic supporter", "options": ["Boxer shorts", "Nudist magazine", "Leather whip"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAthletic supporter.\n\n\tMargaret apparently intends to discuss Sidney's problem with him, but ends up describing her own problems with Donald.  She then spots the jockstrap next to Sidney on the bed and acts indignant about its presence.  Obviously, Margaret's pent-up anger is greater than she claims it to be! \n"}, {"text": "Nearing the end of the episode, Sidney finally discovers the culprit of all the practical jokes that have been plaguing the 4077th.  Who is behind these practical jokes?", "correct": "BJ", "options": ["Klinger", "Hawkeye", "Igor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBJ.\n\n\tBJ gains quite the reputation for his ability to perform practical jokes in the later years of 'M*A*S*H'.  His greatest practical joke is pulled on Frank in this episode, in my opinion.  He fills a ditch that Frank has been digging in case of an attack on the 4077th with water, and then prevails upon Sidney to shout 'air raid'.  When Frank hears the shout, he runs out of the Swamp and dives straight into the chilling water, much to our amusement.  Poor Frank... \n"}, {"text": "By the end of the episode, it appears that Sidney is cured.  The episode ends with a small soliloquy by Freedman while we watch which doctor, standing in a bucket of warm water, performing surgery?", "correct": "Potter", "options": ["BJ", "Hawkeye", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPotter.\n\n\tSidney's closing comments, 'They look every day into the face of death.  On the surface they may seem like other doctors and nurses...but underneath, Ah, Sigmund, underneath!'  The final part is spoken as the camera pans down to Potter's feet, soaking in a small tub of warm water.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff! \n"}]}
