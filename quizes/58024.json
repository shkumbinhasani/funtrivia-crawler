{"id": "58024", "name": "Greatest Scene - 'Holy Grail' Online Quiz | Monty Python | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Monty Python", "Holy Grail"], "questions": [{"text": "Late in the film 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' King Arthur and his knights approach a bridge which they must cross on their quest. What is the bridge called?", "correct": "The Bridge of Death", "options": ["The Bridge of Terror", "The Bridge of Doom", "The Bridge of Hell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bridge of Death.\n\n\tThe approach to the bridge is perilous...the knights must step slowly across a ridge of rocks. \n"}, {"text": "This bridge spans a steamy and terrifying chasm from which very odd noises emanate. What is the equally frightful name of this deadly abyss?", "correct": "The Gorge of Eternal Peril", "options": ["The Arroyo of Nightmarish Fatigue", "The Valley of Neverending Torture", "The Rift of Heinous Flatulence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Gorge of Eternal Peril.\n\n\tThe King and his knights now nervously approach the bridge... \n"}, {"text": "Approaching the bridge, who describes the 'rules of the game' that allow one to cross the rickety structure?", "correct": "King Arthur", "options": ["The Narrator", "Patsy", "Sir Galahad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKing Arthur.\n\n\tAs they approach the bridge the all-knowing (?) Arthur describes in detail what the knights must do to traverse the bridge safely...unfortunately, he still can't distinguish between 3 and 5! \n"}, {"text": "Nearly at the bridge, and facing the bridgekeeper, Arthur suggests that Robin cross the bridge. The brave (?) Sir Robin quickly realizes his trouble and nominates which other knight in his place?", "correct": "Sir Launcelot", "options": ["Sir Bedevere", "Sir Galahad", "Sir Not Appearing in this Film"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSir Launcelot.\n\n\tLauncelot bravely steps up to the Bridgekeeper, who asks him his questions three:\r Bridgekeeper: 'What is your name?' \rSir Launcelot: 'Sir Launcelot of Camelot!' \rBridgekeeper: 'What is your quest?' \rSir Launcelot: 'To seek the Holy Grail...' \rBridgekeeper: 'What is your favorite color?' \rSir Launcelot: 'Blue!' \rBridgekeeper: 'Alright, off you go!' \rSir Launcelot: 'Oh, thank you!' \r And off he goes, non-chalantly... \n"}, {"text": "'That's easy!' says Robin...and he bravely steps up to the bridgekeeper for his three questions. But Robin isn't so bright...which question stumps him?", "correct": "What is the capital of Assyria?", "options": ["What is your favorite color?", "What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?", "What is the meaning of life?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhat is the capital of Assyria?.\n\n\tRobin is not so lucky as Launcelot...he easily answers the first two questions, which are identical to the first two Launcelot is asked...he thinks he has it so easy! Then...the Assyrian stumper comes along and Robin is reduced to stunned silence. \r 'I don't know that...aaaaaaaaaugggghhhh!' \n"}, {"text": "Now it is Galahad's turn to approach the bridge. He does so with much trepidation! With which stumper does Galahad have trouble?", "correct": "What is your favorite color?", "options": ["What is your name?", "What is your quest?", "What is the way to the Hollywood Bowl?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhat is your favorite color?.\n\n\tAgain, Galahad easily conquers the first two questions, building courage as he goes along. But alas, Galahad is hit with a stumper just as Robin was....namely, 'What is your favorite color?' Poor, chaste Galahad, at first he thought it was 'blue', then he changed it to 'yellow'...his indecison cost him a trip into the chasm...and now we'll never know the true answer! \n"}, {"text": "Next at bat we have King Arthur. Always fearless in the face of perils the likes of revolutionary peasants, black knights with poor swordsmanship, and old women who live in the vicinity of Roger the shrubber, Arthur has no qualms about approaching the bridge! The bridgekeeper again assails him with the three questions. Which is the final question that Arthur is asked?", "correct": "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?", "options": ["What is the former name of the People's Front of Judea?", "What is your favorite color?", "What is the capital of Assyria?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhat is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?.\n\n\tArthur, being the brilliant ornithologist, stumps the bridgekeeper with his clever retort...'What do you mean, African or European?' The bridgekeeper replies, 'I don't know that!' and off he goes into the chasm! \n"}, {"text": "Which two knights survive this unbelievably silly scene at the bridge?", "correct": "Bedevere and Launcelot", "options": ["Galahad and Robin", "Galahad and Bedevere", "Launcelot and Robin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBedevere and Launcelot.\n\n\tAll told, of the six characters involved in the scene, half of them survive. Sir Robin and Sir Galahad are tossed into the chasm along with the bridgekeeper himself. King Arthur and Sir Launcelot make it across the bridge using their wit. Bedevere, that lucky sot, makes it across thanks to Arthur (Bedevere thinks the world is shaped like a banana, you know he would have screwed it up.) \n"}, {"text": "'How do you know so much about swallows?' Sir Bedevere now asks. How does Arthur answer this?", "correct": "You have to know these things when you are king, you know?", "options": ["I learnt about birds in grade school, of course!", "I was a bird watcher in my former career.", "Well, the swallow is our national bird."], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou have to know these things when you are king, you know?.\n\n\tOf course the well-schooled Python fan knows that Arthur is lying through is teeth. He only knows about swallows via the annoying conversation he is forced to endure in scene one of the film. Of course, they may have included courses in ornithology at king school back then...but I doubt it. \n"}, {"text": "In order to speed up the bridge-crossing scene, what gimmick is used?", "correct": "Intermission", "options": ["A word from our sponsors", "Death of the animator", "Fast motion cinematography"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIntermission.\n\n\tIntermission, but unfortunately not enough time to pick up a soda and popcorn. Incidentally, the music used during the intermission also appears at the very end of the film.\r Thank you for playing, you have passed the quiz of death! \n"}]}
