{"id": "53330", "name": "'Broken Bow' Part 2 Multiple Choice Quiz | Star Trek: Enterprise | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Star Trek: Enterprise", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Captain Archer is shot during this episode. Where is his injury?", "correct": "left thigh", "options": ["right thigh", "right calf", "left calf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nleft thigh.\n\n\tLooks like a nasty wound, and Archer limps for much of the remainder of the episode. \n"}, {"text": "Captain Archer's father apparently worked on the design of the ENTERPRISE. What was his first name?", "correct": "Henry", "options": ["Gene", "Jonathan", "James"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry.\n\n\tIt's mentioned at least once. Captain Archer remembers flying model craft with his father several times in the episode. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Phlox uses a mildly creepy method to cure Captain Archer's wound. What is it?", "correct": "an osmotic eel", "options": ["a Denubian leech", "an osmotic leech", "a Denubian eel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nan osmotic eel.\n\n\tLooked pretty disgusting, but it seemed to do the job. \n"}, {"text": "While Phlox was treating Archer's wound, Sub-Commander T'Pol took command of the ENTERPRISE. Approximately how long was she in command?", "correct": "6 hours", "options": ["4 hours", "24 hours", "12 hours"], "explanation": "\n\n\n6 hours.\n\n\tT'Pol, we learn, is ranking officer when Archer is out of commission, despite the fact that she seems to hold no official Starfleet rank. \n"}, {"text": "When Captain Archer enters his log, he does not preface it with the familiar 'Captain's Log.' What, instead, does he say?", "correct": "'Enterprise Starlog...'", "options": ["'Mission Log...'", "'Tactical Log...'", "'Enterprise Log...'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Enterprise Starlog...'\n\n\tSounds odd, but that's what he says. Maybe he'll go to 'Captain's Log' before the series ends...? \n"}, {"text": "Everyone on the ENTERPRISE seems to speak English, and we hear a number of familiar accents among the crew. Which do we NOT hear?", "correct": "Japanese", "options": ["Southern United States", "We hear all of these accents", "British"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapanese.\n\n\tCommander Tucker has a distinctive Southern U.S. accent. Lt. Reed is clearly British. Hoshi Sato is Japanese (although Linda Park, the actress playing her, is Korean), but she possesses no accent whatsoever -- she sounds, for all the world, like a midwestern U.S. citizen. \n"}, {"text": "When the ENTERPRISE crew arrives on the first inhabited planet it has ever encountered, the first establishment the crew visits seems to be the equivalent of an alien strip club. There are two exotic dancers who look very much alike, but are different colors. What colors do they sport?", "correct": "pink and blue", "options": ["blue and red", "orange and pink", "red and orange"], "explanation": "\n\n\npink and blue.\n\n\tAccording to the credits of the episode, the dancers are played by women with the same last name -- probably sisters or cousins. \n"}, {"text": "During a particularly turbulent moment, one member of the ENTERPRISE crew muses that perhaps someone should request seatbelts from Starfleet. Who makes this comment?", "correct": "Hoshi Sato", "options": ["Jonathan Archer", "Malcolm Reed", "Travis Mayweather"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoshi Sato.\n\n\tHoshi, recall, was not especially enthusiastic about joining a deep space expedition. \n"}, {"text": "The ENTERPRISE does not possess a tractor beam, as the starships of 'TOS,' 'TNG,' 'DS9,' and 'VOY' do. What does it have instead?", "correct": "grapples", "options": ["anti-grav emitters", "magnetic plates", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngrapples.\n\n\tENTERPRISE grabs its enemies the old-fashioned way -- it fires off grappling cables and tows them in manually. \n"}, {"text": "When Captain Archer's door chime is rung, what does he say?", "correct": "'Come in.'", "options": ["'Enter.'", "'It's open.'", "'Come.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Come in.'\n\n\tJust a regular joe, that Archer. =) \n"}, {"text": "Captain Archer is introduced in this episode to Starfleet's new weapon, the phase pistol. How many settings does it have?", "correct": "2", "options": ["4", "1", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tLt. Reed: 'Stun and kill.

To whom does she speak it?", "correct": "Hoshi Sato", "options": ["Captain Archer", "Ambassador Savol", "The Klingon refugee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoshi Sato.\n\n\tHoshi may very well be the only other person aboard ENTERPRISE who speaks the Vulcan language. \n"}, {"text": "What does T'Pol most likely say, the one time she speaks in her native language?", "correct": "'Thank you.'", "options": ["'You're welcome.'", "'A mistake.'", "'Utterly illogical.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Thank you.'\n\n\tWe don't get subtitles on this line, but since Hoshi responds -- in English -- with 'You're welcome,' it's a pretty safe bet that T'Pol said, 'Thank you.' \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first person in this episode -- and possibly in Starfleet history -- to be subjected to a transporter beam?", "correct": "Jonathan Archer", "options": ["T'Pol", "Travis Mayweather", "'Trip' Tucker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJonathan Archer.\n\n\tT'Pol orders Archer beamed out during an emergency, much to the chagrin of several crewmembers. Remember, everyone is still skeptical of using the transporter on organic material at this point! \n"}, {"text": "Captain Archer's final line states that one can not be afraid of what?", "correct": "The wind", "options": ["The unknown", "The future", "The stars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe wind.\n\n\tIt's a line that Archer's father used to say to him, as we're shown. \n"}, {"text": "Kind of a tough one here, as it's a subtle thing: in terms of how the ship is referenced, Archer's crew has the most in common with the crew of which series?", "correct": "'ST: Voyager'", "options": ["'ST: The Next Generation'", "'ST: The Original Series'", "'ST: Deep Space Nine'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'ST: Voyager'.\n\n\tInterestingly, Archer and his crew never call the ship '*the* ENTERPRISE' (as the crews of 'ST:TOS' and 'ST:TNG' do), but rather just 'ENTERPRISE.' This is also how Captain Janeway's crew referred to their ship -- it was never '*the* VOYAGER,' but instead just 'VOYAGER.' \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the alien enemy race encountered for the first time ever in this episode?", "correct": "Suliban", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuliban.\n\n\tThe Suliban promise to become a major threat in this series...but if that's the case, why did we NEVER hear of them in any of the other series, all of which take place well after this one?  Time will tell. \n"}, {"text": "Who directed this episode?", "correct": "James L. Conway", "options": ["LeVar Burton", "Jonathan Frakes", "David Carson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames L. Conway\n\n\tOdds are good that we'll see work from all of the other listed directors throughout the run of the series. \n"}, {"text": "And finally, what is the name of the theme song used for this episode?", "correct": "'Faith Of the Heart'", "options": ["'Out There'", "'Enterprise'", "'The Future Is Now'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Faith Of the Heart'.\n\n\tAs we see in the closing credits, the song was written by Diane Warren and performed by Russell Watson. Warren also wrote, among other tunes, 'I Don't Want To Miss a Thing,' the Aerosmith song used as the theme for the movie 'Armageddon.'  [NOTE: Sometime during the second season of \"Enterprise,\" the name of the song was officially changed to \"Where My Heart Will Take Me (Faith of the Heart)\"...but at the time the pilot aired, the song was simply called \"Faith of the Heart.\"  Check the closing credits of \"Broken Bow,\" and spare me the \"correction\" notice.] \n"}]}
