{"id": "307669", "name": "Road Blocks of \"The Amazing Race 1\" Online Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Although it was unaired, team members were required to do which of these tasks before arriving at the Pit Stop in Leg 1?", "correct": "Eat an ostrich egg", "options": ["Drive through the savannah to a route marker", "Rappel off a cliff", "Search for the Pit Stop from a clifftop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEat an ostrich egg.\n\n\tIn Leg 1 of the race, teams flew from New York City to South Africa to Zambia.  Though these flights and the tasks that followed were trying in their own rights, teams arrived at the Pit Stop at Songwe Village to find that they had to complete the first Road Block task of the race: to eat an ostrich egg yolk. Despite the fact that all of the teams completed the task, the Road Block itself never saw the light of day in the pilot episode (though there is evidence that the event took place throughout the arrivals at the Pit Stop).  Since the completion of the task didn't affect the players' rankings, it was cut for time purposes. It wasn't until season 6 that the ostrich egg task came back full-force, once again as a Road Block. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 2, team members were required to find the Pit Stop from the top of the Eiffel Tower.  Where was the Pit Stop?", "correct": "The Arc de Triomphe", "options": ["The Louvre", "Notre Dame Cathedral", "The Moulin Rouge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Arc de Triomphe.\n\n\tOnce teams flew from Zambia to Johannesburg to Paris, they had to make their way to the Eiffel Tower to complete the Road Block for the Leg.  This Road Block required that team members run up the stairs of the Eiffel Tower and use a five Franc coin to look through a telescope for a location marked by a flag.  At this location, the Arc de Triomphe, teams could find the second Pit Stop of the race.\rNotably, Lenny of Lenny and Karen decided that when he couldn't find the monument, he would take a chance and go to the Notre Dame Cathedral to search instead.  This fault dropped the team to ninth place, narrowly avoiding elimination.  David and Margaretta also hit a hitch when David accidentally didn't complete the task correctly.  They arrived at the Pit Stop in sixth, but departed in eighth after a time penalty. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 4, which team member did not complete the Road Block in the Amphitheater in Tunisia?", "correct": "Karyn", "options": ["Frank", "Emily", "David"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKaryn.\n\n\tDeparting from France in the beginning of Leg 4, teams made their way across the sea to Tunisia.  Completing the Detour task in Tunis, teams were required to head to El Djem (as per a clue in the form of a souvenir cigarette) to the Amphitheater of Thysdrus.  Once there, a Road Block required team members to take a torch and navigate the passageways and chambers of the Amphitheater where gladiators were once held in order to find a set of swords hanging over a 'bottomless' pit.  Once these swords were obtained, they would need to be taken to the Pit Stop overlooking the battle area and sheathed before teams could check in.\rDavid and Margaretta were last to arrive at the Pit Stop because of taxi troubles on the way to El Djem, and because of this, they were eliminated.  Because no Fast Forward was used, all teams were involved with this Road Block. \n"}, {"text": "At the Pagani Auto Factory in Leg 6, one team member was able to ride in an extremely fast car to the Pit Stop.  How did the other teammate make it to the Pit Stop?", "correct": "In a Smart car", "options": ["In a wagon", "On a bike", "In a gondola"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a Smart car.\n\n\tArriving by train in the town of Ferrara, teams could make their way to the Pagani Auto Factory to find the Road Block clue for this leg of the race.  In this Road Block, one team member would be able to take a Pagani sports car directly to the Pit Stop at Sant' Agata Bolognese.  The other team member, on the other hand, would need to take a Smart car and a map and navigate their way around the Italian countryside to find the village's town center.  Once there, they could drive directly to the Pit Stop and check in.\rLenny and Karen, who took a different Detour task from the rest of the teams in Rome, ended up arriving at this Pit Stop in last place.  Luckily though, they were spared by this non-elimination leg. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 8, team members had to find their clues in a temple devoted to the revering of which animal?", "correct": "Rat", "options": ["Bat", "Elephant", "Cow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRat.\n\n\tLeaving Italy in Leg 7, teams advanced to Delhi, India.  In Leg 8, teams had to travel to Jaipur and then take an extensive train ride to Deshnoke to find the Karni Mata Temple.  Once there, the Road Block task soon became evident.  Team members needed to travel through the temple looking for clues, all the while avoiding the numerous rats crawling around on the ground.  Brennan, Margarita, Emily, Kevin, and Joe all completed this Road Block task, finding their clues in a pot swarming with rats.\rAfter the Road Block, teams were told to make their way to the Pit Stop, Laxmi Niwas Palace in Bikaner.  The last team to arrive here, Nancy and Emily, were only two minutes behind Joe and Bill.  No one was eliminated in this leg of the race. \n"}, {"text": "Which team member walked amongst the tigers in Leg 9 in Thailand?", "correct": "Emily", "options": ["Kevin", "Margarita", "Brennan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmily.\n\n\tIn Leg 9, teams continued through India, then made their way to Thailand.  Arriving in Bangkok, teams soon made their way by many means to Kanchanaburi to a Buddhist monastery to find the Road Block.  The people selected for this task would need to don a specific outfit and walk across a ravine filled with chained tigers, many of which followed the players around (even swatting Drew in the leg), to find the clue at the end.  This clue told players to make their way to the Pit Stop, the Tiger Cave Temple in Krabi.  Emily, Frank, Rob, and Drew completed this Road Block task while Joe and Bill claimed the Fast Forward at the Temple of the Reclining Buddha in Bangkok earlier.\rIronically, while Nancy and Emily arrived at the Pit Stop in fourth place after finishing this Road Block, an earlier plan to not follow the Detour clue ended up giving them a voluntary twenty-four hour penalty.  Joe and Bill, who won the Fast Forward, inevitably continued the race because of this. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 10 in Thailand, team members had to find and use which of these objects?", "correct": "A snorkel", "options": ["A car", "A rope", "A bucket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA snorkel.\n\n\tAfter finishing the Detour in Leg 10, teams made their way to Bo Tor, Ao Luk (to Sea, Land, and Trek) to find the Road Block.  For this task, team members needed to get into a kayak and paddle it to a cave downriver to search for a mask and snorkel set.  After this, both team members could make their way back to the dock, and then take another boat to Chicken Island. Once there, the team member involved in the Road Block needed to dive underwater and find the clue itself on the sea floor.  After this, teams could head to the Pit Stop at nearby Pai Plong Beach.  Because of the time difference between many of the teams, some teams finished the tasks nearly eighteen hours after the others. \n"}, {"text": "In China in Leg 11, teams members needed to eat otherwise unusual foods.  Which of these was not required for the task?", "correct": "Peking duck", "options": ["Beetle larvae", "Chicken feet", "Squid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeking duck.\n\n\tAfter completing the Detour task of Leg 11, teams were given a shopping list for Hongqiao Market in order to purchase five beetle larvae, one squid, and two chicken feet.  Once this was done, teams needed to find cart #57 at Donghuamen Night Market and choose one member for the Road Block task.  In order to complete this, teams needed to have professional chefs cook a meal from the foods provided, and the selected members had to eat them to receive the clue.  Brennan, Margarita, Drew, and Bill completed this task and headed to the penultimate Pit Stop of the race at Tiantan Park's South Gate.\rKevin and Drew, who finished the Road Block in Beijing first, went to the wrong gate and were ultimately eliminated.  Joe and Bill, now in third, would depart twenty minutes shy of twenty-four hours after the second place team. \n"}, {"text": "How many people completed the Polar Dip Road Block task in Leg 13 in Alaska?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Three", "None", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tAfter a speedy Detour through the Alaskan forests, teams made their way to the frozen Fish Lake.  Once teams arrived here, one member needed to be selected to perform a Polar Dip, requiring that they strip down and jump into the lake to claim the clue.  Only Frank and Brennan are able to complete the task before moving on since Joe and Bill are so far behind that they can not catch up.  Before Joe and Bill begin Leg 13 (exiting Takosha Lodge for the Detour), the other two teams have crossed the finish line in New York City.\rAfter completing the Road Block, teams were told to go to Vincent Daniels Square in Queens, and then to proceed to the finish line at Flushing Meadows Park.\rRacers of future seasons would later experience an even colder Polar Dip in North Korea and other similar situations. \n"}, {"text": "Which player completed the most Road Block tasks during this season of \"The Amazing Race\"?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Emily", "Brennan", "Joe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tFrank performed eight of the twelve Road Blocks found in the duration of the first \"Amazing Race\" while Margarita only performed three.  Margarita ended up completing the camel-riding Detour task in Leg 5 (in the Tunisian Sahara Desert), the walk through Karni Mata Temple in Deshnoke in Leg 8, and the Chinese food Detour in Beijing in Leg 11.\rBrennan (of Rob and Brennan) completed seven Road Block tasks, Emily completed six before her and Nancy's elimination in Leg 9, and Joe completed six as well before he and Joe began the final leg (they did not participate in the Fish Lake polar dip Road Block.  Frank and Margarita, Rob and Brennan, and Joe and Bill all obtained Fast Forward clues during the race, so none of them had the ability to complete every single Road Block. \n"}]}
