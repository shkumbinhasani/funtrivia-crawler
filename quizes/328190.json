With a population density of 12,015 people/sq mile at the 2001 census, Portsmouth was the only British city with a higher density than London's 11,816/sq mile. Both of these cities are positively spacious when compared with the world's most densely populated city, Manila in the Philippines, which is home to more than 110,000 people/sq mile. \n"}, {"text": "If you landed at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, which Indian city would you be visiting?", "correct": "Mumbai (Bombay)", "options": ["Delhi", "Chennai (Madras)", "Kolkata (Calcutta)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMumbai (Bombay).\n\n\tFormerly named Bombay, Mumbai is the capital of the state of Maharashtra.

For every four climbers who reach the top of K2, one dies trying -- K2's death rate is 23.4% compared with 5.7% on Everest. (The death rate on Annapurna is an incredible 42.85%.)\rK2 is also one of the five amongst the 14 that have still not been climbed successfully during the winter months. Strangely, Annapurna has been successfully climbed in the winter. \n"}]}
