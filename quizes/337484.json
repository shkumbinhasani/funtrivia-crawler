Many compared the work of Spanish director Rodrigo Cort\u00e9s to early thrillers created by Alfred Hitchcock more than half a century earlier.  It earned almost $20,000,000 in its box office run, over ten times what it cost to make.\rThe film starred Ryan Reynolds as a truck driver deployed to Iraq for work.  Upon getting kidnapped by enemy forces, he was placed into a coffin and buried underground.  Much of the film involved his attempts to figure out how he could escape what might be his final resting place. \n"}, {"text": "Although a great deal of this 2006 thriller was filmed in jungles and on beaches, the climax of what movie, starring Josh Duhamel, took place in an underwater cave system?", "correct": "Turistas", "options": ["Borderland", "Monsters", "Hostel: Part II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTuristas.\n\n\tThis movie followed a group of twenty-somethings visiting the beautiful Brazilian coast in search of beach-side fun and lush jungles.  When they stumbled upon a rather idyllic spot on the oceanfront, they discovered that something was amiss as they were drugged, robbed, and left by the water.  Inevitably, they found that they were going to be used for something much more grave and frightening: their body parts.  In a climactic part of the film, some of the survivors fled into an extensive underwater cave system and were forced to suck air bubbles from the roofs of the chambers to survive.\r\"Turistas\" was directed by John Stockwell, also known for \"Top Gun\", \"Blue Crush\", and \"Into the Blue\".  Although the film starred Josh Duhamel, Melissa George, and Olivia Wilde, it failed to recoup its $30,000,000 budget, only returning about $7,000,000 at the box office.  Critical reception was also lacking as many compared it to the torture-themed \"Hostel\" films. \n"}, {"text": "In the second volume of this Quentin Tarantino film, 'The Bride' punched her way through the lid of a coffin and dug her way to the surface.  What movie was this?", "correct": "Kill Bill", "options": ["Inglourious Basterds", "Death Proof", "Pulp Fiction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKill Bill.\n\n\tOne of Quentin Tarantino's more famous films, \"Kill Bill\" was split into two volumes, due to its length, and it accumulated over $160,000,000 in the box office.  Starring Uma Thurman, the film followed a woman seeking vengeance against the people who attempted to kill her and her child.  The first volume also featured Lucy Liu and Vivica A. Fox, while the second included Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and David Carradine as Bill.\rIn the second volume of \"Kill Bill\", 'The Bride' (played by Uma Thurman) continued her revenge streak to attempt to bring down the final names on her hit list: Elle Driver, Budd, and Bill himself.  When she reached Budd's desert trailer, she was shot in the chest with a shotgun shell full of rocksalt and subsequently buried in a coffin at the grave of Paula Shultz.  Recalling her training at the hands of Pai Mei, she was able to break through the wood of the coffin and escape. \n"}, {"text": "Directed by Vincenzo Natali, what 1997 movie involved a group of unknown people who woke up to find themselves trapped in an expansive series of rooms containing deadly traps?", "correct": "Cube", "options": ["Nothing", "Splice", "Elevated"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCube.\n\n\tWhile the people in \"Cube\" tried to explore adjacent rooms in this sci-fi thriller, they discovered that there were deadly booby traps laid throughout, essentially invisible to the naked eye, which would only trigger when they walked in.  With escape on everyone's minds, they tried to work together but found themselves unable to trust each other.\rThe entirety of \"Cube\" was filmed in a single cube-shaped room with dimensions of fourteen feet cubed.  The unique premise ended up attracting genre fans and pleased a number of critics.  While the film only earned half a million in theaters, its lack of wide release and low budget created a success.  Director Vincenzo Natali later made \"Splice\" in 2010. \n"}, {"text": "Playing a mother and daughter forced to wait out a robbery in their own home, Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart starred in what 2002 thriller?", "correct": "Panic Room", "options": ["Red Eye", "The Resident", "The Sixth Sense"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPanic Room.\n\n\tDirected by David Fincher, \"Panic Room\" hit theaters in 2002 becoming his fifth feature film.  It didn't disappoint; in the box office it took nearly $200,000,000 and it found positive critical reviews.  Aside from Foster and Stewart, the movie also starred Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam as the criminals invading her new home.\rIn this 2002 film, set almost entirely within the same solitary house, a mother and daughter were awakened by robbers entering their home to claim millions in bearer bonds from a safe in their new residence's panic room, a room made of steel and concrete and designed to keep the occupants safe. \n"}, {"text": "Six women went on a cave exploration trip in this 2005 British film only to stumble upon hungry underground creatures.  What was this confining horror film?", "correct": "The Descent", "options": ["The Cave", "Sanctum", "Unearthed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Descent.\n\n\tIn perhaps one of the most tightly-constructed settings in horror history, the six characters of Neil Marshall's \"The Descent\" attempted to make their way through narrow tunnels, tight cave passages, and cramped spaces to finish their spelunking expedition.  When their way out caved in and they realized that no one would find them in this unmapped part of the system, things went from bad to worse.\r\"The Descent\" was a fairly popular, visceral film, as it grossed over $50,000,000 in the box office.  It also received highly positive reviews from critics becoming one of the better-received horror movies of the decade because of its tension and premise.  A sequel was released in 2009. \n"}, {"text": "In space, there's nowhere to go.  What 1979 film directed by Ridley Scott involved the crew of a transport ship and an otherworldly creature with acidic blood?", "correct": "Alien", "options": ["Event Horizon", "2001: A Space Odyessy", "Solaris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlien.\n\n\tReleased in 1979, \"Alien\" kick-started a series of outer space horror films.  The original, starring Sigourney Weaver, earned over $100,000,000 in the box office and received universal acclaim from critics (much like the second action-fueled entry in the series, directed by James Cameron, would do in later years).  \"Alien\" also won an Oscar for special effects.\r\"Alien\" followed the crew of the Nostromo as they were awakened from a sleep in stasis to investigate the surface of a nearby planet which, as they discovered, was populated by aliens.  When one sneaked onto their ship (in the stomach of one of the crewmates), there was nowhere to run. \n"}, {"text": "Filmed in a single room, what British thriller released in 2010 asked eight people to answer a simple question within eighty minutes?", "correct": "Exam", "options": ["The Experiment", "Primer", "Sleuth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExam.\n\n\tIn this movie, the eight characters were placed into a room to vie for a high-ranking job position.  They were told by a proctor that they would need to answer one simple question before one of them, who answered correctly, would get the job.  They could not spoil the papers they were given and they could not leave the room.  They also could not talk to the guard or the proctor.  Suffice to say, things got tense.\rThis film was released by IFC in 2010 and never left the film festival circuit outside the UK.  Despite this, it was modestly received by critics who praised its interesting story.  Director Stuart Hazeldine was better known for sci-fi screenplays (including \"The Knowing\" and \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\").  \"Exam\" was based on a similar Spanish film released half a decade earlier, \"The Method\", which also took place in a confined setting. \n"}, {"text": "Go outside and freeze or stay inside and risk coming face to face with an alien?  In what 1982 movie did Kurt Russell (and others) need to avoid an otherworldly creature and the elements outside?", "correct": "The Thing", "options": ["Virus", "Predator", "Whiteout"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Thing.\n\n\tDirected by John Carpenter, \"The Thing\" was notable for its science fiction storytelling and special effects.  Based on the 1951 movie \"The Thing From Another World\" (by Howard Hawks), \"The Thing\" took in just under $20,000,000 in the box office.  While this wasn't overly successful, it did find a dedicated audience on video.\rThe movie followed an Antarctica research facility and its encounter with an alien which could mimic host bodies entirely, replicating their appearances and mannerisms to take over and proliferate.  Kurt Russell starred, along with twelve other men who attempted to evade the creature unearthed from the freezing Antarctic tundra.  Throughout the movie, it was made clear that the characters must either face the creature in their claustrophobic, closed quarters, or the bitter, deadly cold of the wintry storm outside. \n"}, {"text": "In 2003, what film about sharks earned over $50,000,000 and was set almost entirely in the ocean?", "correct": "Open Water", "options": ["The Reef", "Adrift", "Deep Blue Sea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOpen Water.\n\n\tSure, it doesn't seem claustrophobic from the get-go, but imagine yourself dropped in the middle of the ocean with no chance of survival.  In \"Open Water\", a couple went scuba diving with a rather large group but failed to return home, having been overlooked upon a recount on the boat.  Much of the movie was spent following their subsequent time bobbing in the ocean (including sharks).  It was enough to make you need to get out.\r\"Open Water\" was independently made, and after its premiere at Sundance it was picked up for wide distribution where it made over $50,000,000.  The movie was based on a true story and was one of the more profitable movies released in the 2000 decade having been made for just over $100,000. \n"}]}
