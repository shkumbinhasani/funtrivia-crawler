{"id": "138419", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Springtime' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of this episode we see the doctors of the 4077th in a familiar setting, the operating room.  Most unusual, however, is the size of the patient upon whom Hawkeye must operate.  Which giant former Detroit Lion plays the part of Lyle, Hawkeye's patient and newfound friend?", "correct": "Alex Karras", "options": ["Dick Butkus", "George Halas", "Bobby Unitas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlex Karras.\n\n\tAlex Karras, the former Iowa Hawkeye and Outland Trophy winner (and runner-up for a Heisman Trophy), apparently fancied himself a great actor, and who could argue with him?  Just his performances in this episode of 'M*A*S*H' and as Mongo in 'Blazing Saddles' earn him credit as a good comic actor in my book (though I could do without the series 'Webster'!)  Karras plays Lyle, an incredibly large marine, and loyal Hawkeye Pierce-patient.  For the rest of the episode, Lyle follows Hawkeye around, making sure no harm befalls the reluctant doctor. \n"}, {"text": "While Lyle falls smitten for his heroic lifesaver Hawkeye, Radar also finds himself attracted to one of the camp nurses, a certain Lieutenant Simmons.  Simmons is played by which actress who got screenwriting credits for this episode and two others, before embarking on a rather extensive acting career?", "correct": "Mary Kay Place", "options": ["Hope Summers", "Linda Bloodworth", "Gwen Farrell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMary Kay Place.\n\n\tMary Kay Place co-wrote the script for this episode, along with 'Hot Lips and Empty Arms' from season two and 'Mad Dogs and Serviceman', also from season three.  She would go on to play a supporting role in the television series 'Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman' and later played parts in such films as 'Private Benjamin', 'The Big Chill' and 'Being John Malkovich'.  In this episode, she plays the girl with the 'fat glasses' with whom Radar is deeply smitten. \n"}, {"text": "After establishing the first two sub-plots, the scene shifts to an idyllic setting where we find star-crossed lovers Margaret Houlihan and Frank Burns reclining in the deep grass.  After flaring his nostrils for Margaret, by request, Frank lets off one of the all-time classic 'M*A*S*H' lines.  It goes as follows:  'Funny thing -- war.  Never have so many suffered so much so so few could be so happy.'  This classic line is playing on a quote by which of these famous individuals?", "correct": "Winston Churchill", "options": ["Mohandas K. Gandhi", "Abraham Lincoln", "Thomas Jefferson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinston Churchill.\n\n\tWinston Churchill's World War II quote goes, 'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.'  He was describing the Battle of Britain, and the sacrifices of the British RAF, in a speech made on August 20, 1940.  Frank Burns' quote was a little less noble in comparison, I would say, but a heck of a lot more amusing! \n"}, {"text": "The peaceful scene between Margaret and Frank is sadly broken up when Hot Lips notices Klinger nearby, reading a book of poetry.  Klinger, in turn, is interrupted by a galluping Radar, who has brought good tidings to the hirsute corporal in the form of a love letter from his girl in Toledo.  Who is the author of the poetry book that engrosses first Klinger, then Radar?", "correct": "Rupert Brook", "options": ["Andrew Marvell", "John Dryden", "Ezra Pound"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRupert Brook.\n\n\tRadar delivers Klinger a message from his girl Laverne.  After reading that she has agreed to marry him, Klinger runs off in a fit of joy.  Radar scoops up the book of poetry left by Klinger and proceeds to thumb through it.  Later, he will use this poetry to impress Lt. Simmons, though he gets the author's name wrong.  He calls the poet 'Ruptured Brook'. \n"}, {"text": "While flipping through Klinger's book of poetry, which verb seems to have the most enticing effect on Radar's psyche?", "correct": "Slaking", "options": ["Plying", "Nudging", "Quelling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlaking.\n\n\tRadar reads the following lines:\r 'They have known shame, who love unloved. Even then, \rWhen two mouths, thirsty each for each, find slaking...'\r  I have done some research and have discovered that this is an actual excerpt from a Brook poem called 'Love'.  The entire poem reads as follows:\r 'Love is a breach in the walls, a broken gate, \r      Where that comes in that shall not go again; \rLove sells the proud heart's citadel to Fate. \r      They have known shame, who love unloved. Even then, \rWhen two mouths, thirsty each for each, find slaking, \r      And agony's forgot, and hushed the crying \rOf credulous hearts, in heaven -- - such are but taking \r      Their own poor dreams within their arms, and lying \rEach in his lonely night, each with a ghost. \r      Some share that night. But they know love grows colder, \rGrows false and dull, that was sweet lies at most. \r      Astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder, \rBut darkens, and dies out from kiss to kiss. \rAll this is love; and all love is but this.'\r  Wow...slaking! \n"}, {"text": "We soon find Klinger accosting Colonel Blake, who is apparently attempting to perfect his golf swing but not having much luck.  Klinger begs desperately for the Colonel to allow him a two-week pass to return to Toledo and quickly wed his sweetheart, followed by a quick honeymoon.  Klinger then promises to return immediately to Korea, to which Henry responds, 'Everyone who believes that, ____________________.' (Fill in the blank with the correct phrase)", "correct": "Stand on their head", "options": ["Dance the quick step", "Wiggle their ears", "Fly to the moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStand on their head.\n\n\tI'm not sure why, but this stands out as one of the great Henry Blake lines.  It must be in the delivery.  Naturally, Klinger isn't allowed back to Toledo, but Henry arranges to have the wedding done through a telephone/ham radio connection. \n"}, {"text": "Returning to the 4077th, the scene shifts to the post-op, where Frank Burns is ridiculing a young soldier who his obstinately holding which type of animal?", "correct": "Cat & A cat", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCat & A cat.\n\n\tFrank's heartless tirade against the young soldier is broken up by Hawkeye, who quips, 'Frank, can I borrow your doctor's diploma?  They're a little short in the latrine.'  Hawkeye tries the more gentle approach to separate the kid from his cat, and succeeds.  However, once the cat has been released, the young soldier grabs Hawkeye.  Lyle, still in Hawkeye's debt, saves his favorite doctor...evening the score. \n"}, {"text": "The climactic scene of the episode occurs in Henry's office, where Klinger prepares to be wed to his longtime girlfriend Laverne.  We learn of her surname thanks to Father Mulcahy.  What is Laverne's last name?", "correct": "Esposito", "options": ["Shockley", "Abramowitz", "Popodopoulis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEsposito.\n\n\tApparently, Klinger likes Italian women (though, in the last episode he weds a Korean gal.)  Klinger wears a white wedding dress for the ceremony, prompting Margaret to comment, 'Disgusting!  You have your nerve, wearing white!', to which Klinger responds, 'Jealous?' \n"}, {"text": "During the wedding ceremony, the radio gives out, forcing Henry to go to drastic measures to regain the connection.  While in the process of re-locating Laverne, he is offered the recipe for which of the following dishes?", "correct": "Never-fail cornbread", "options": ["Tasty tuna casserole", "Delightful chocolate donuts", "Always hot fudge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNever-fail cornbread.\n\n\tAnother great Henry Blake line during his attempts to reconnect: 'Look lady, I'm a doctor trying to marry a soldier in the middle of a war!'  'That's sick!' is the response from the operator, who then offers her 'recipe for never-fail cornbread'.  A frustrated Henry answers, 'Lady, you are a piece of cornbread!' \n"}, {"text": "The wedding ceremony nearly completed, Frank Burns barges in and goes on another tirade, complaining of nuptuals, animals and idiots.  Hawkeye's pal Lyle comes to the rescue once again, threatening Frank Burns *not* to write up a report.  He gets a bit physical with Frank, causing Hot Lips to shout, 'You can't _______ an officer!'  (Fill in the blank)", "correct": "Twirl", "options": ["Rotate", "Spin", "Swing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwirl.\n\n\tLyle tosses Frank upon his shoulders and gives him a good 'twirl', after which Frank promises no report as he gathers his bearings on the floor.  Meanwhile, Henry relocates Laverne and the wedding is completed with a pair of 'I dos'.  Just in the nick of time, Radar wanders in...lipstick marks covering his face.  According to the young man, he has been 'slaked'!  I hope this quiz was enough to 'slake' you, thank you for playing!
