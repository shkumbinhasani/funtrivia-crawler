{"id": "146598", "name": "'Ben Hur', Part IV Trivia Game | Ben Hur . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Ben Hur"], "questions": [{"text": "Ben Hur's preparations for the great chariot race include a keen bonding experience with Sheik Ilderim's horses.  Ben Hur gets to know the horses quite well, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each.  Which of the horses does Ben Hur call his 'anchor'?", "correct": "Antares", "options": ["Rigel", "Aldebaran", "Altair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAntares.\n\n\t'Steady Antares,' Ben Hur says, 'like a rock.  You will be our anchor.'  Aldebaran is the swiftest of the horses, so Ben Hur instructs her to 'wait for the others'.  Rigel and Altair are given no specific instructions, but are equally adored by the Sheik and Ben Hur. \n"}, {"text": "Just before the big chariot race Sheik Ilderim gives Ben Hur an item for luck.  What is this thing that the sheik provides to his driver?", "correct": "A Star of David", "options": ["A small dagger", "A crucifix", "An Arab headdress"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Star of David.\n\n\tSheik Ilderim provides Ben Hur with 'The Star of David.  To shine out for your people and my people together, and blind the eyes of Rome!'  An extraordinary show of Arab/Jewish unity, I must say. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hur's chariot is lined up one away from the late arriving chariot of his rival Messala.  What sort of chariot is the dastardly Messala riding?", "correct": "Greek", "options": ["Egyptian", "Persian", "Parthian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreek.\n\n\tThe meaning of this becomes readily apparent when the camera focuses on the wheels, which contain a protuding set of blades, perfect for chopping up the spokes of the wheels on other chariots.  One may ask, isn't this against the rules?  But Sheik Ilderim has made clear that in the arena, there are no rules... \n"}, {"text": "After a turn around the track, the Roman Governor, Pontius Pilate announces the place of origin of each driver.  How many chariot teams are there in total at the beginning of the race?", "correct": "9", "options": ["10", "8", "11"], "explanation": "\n\n\n9.\n\n\tThe chariot teams are from: Alexandria, Messina, Carthage, Cyprus, Rome, Corinth, Athens, Phrygia and Judaea.  Naturally, Ben Hur is the Judaean driver, and Messala is the Roman driver.  The race begins with the dropping of a white cloth by Pontius Pilate (played by actor Frank Thring). \n"}, {"text": "The actor Charlton Heston, who portrayed Ben Hur, became an adept chariot driver in order to do much of his own racing during the film.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAre you kidding?  This is Charlton Heston we're talking about...of course he learned to drive a chariot!  Not only that, but he became quite adept at it, apparently, and much of the racing footage includes Heston himself driving the horses.  According to some sources, several Hollywood personalities came to Rome for the express purpose of getting a chariot ride with Heston while the filming commenced. \n"}, {"text": "Rounding one of the turns during the race, Ben Hur sees that his path is blocked by a broken chariot.  His horses are able to leap the damaged cart, and Ben Hur's chariot is launched over the top of the heap in the process.  What was the name of the legendary stunt man who performed this magnificent feat?", "correct": "Joe Canutt", "options": ["Alfredo Danesi", "Emile Carrer", "Mino Doro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe Canutt.\n\n\tThis is truly one of the most spectacular moments of the film.  Originally, it was not intended that Ben Hur (Canutt in this scene) would be launched completely out of the chariot, but when it happened in this manner, and Canutt was able to pull himself back into the chariot with little damage, Wyler chose to leave the scene intact.  Canutt only suffered a cut chin, reportedly the only injury incurred during the incredibly dangerous chariot sequence! \n"}, {"text": "During the great race, how many total chariots are destroyed and/or riders taken out of commission?", "correct": "6", "options": ["5", "3", "8"], "explanation": "\n\n\n6.\n\n\tThis is an area of discontinuity in the film.  A total of six riders, including Messala, are taken out during the race.  This means that only three riders should have finished the competition.  Oddly enough, however, a total of four drivers are shown finishing the race.  Another driver is added to the scene after the third chariot is taken out for some reason.  Odd. \n"}, {"text": "Is Ben Hur victorious in the chariot race?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tOf course he is!  After Messala made a close pass at his chariot, followed by some intense whipping, Ben Hur's chariot is entangled with Messala's.  The wheel comes off of Messala's cart and he is trampled by a trailing chariot.  The scene is truly gruesome, but one cannot feel much sorrow for the traitorous Messala. \n"}, {"text": "After the race, Ben Hur has one last confrontation with his dying rival Messala.  What are Messala's dying words?", "correct": "'The race is not over.'", "options": ["'You have won, Judah.'", "'You will never defeat me, Judah.'", "'The enemy is vanquished.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The race is not over.'\n\n\tThe cruel Messala informs Ben Hur that his mother and sister are still alive, and that they can be located in the Valley of the Lepers 'if they can still be recognized'.  He then says, 'It goes on, Judah.  The race is not over.'  This guy is a sick puppy! \n"}, {"text": "Messala informs Ben Hur that his mother and sister are dead.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAs mentioned just prior, Messala provides Ben Hur with the needed information to find his family.  Unfortunately, it is cruel information indeed.  Ben Hur's next step is to find his family, a sad task to be undertaken.  Please join me in part five, when we discover if Ben Hur is able to have a happy reunion.  Thank you for playing! \n"}]}
