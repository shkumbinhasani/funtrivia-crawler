His studies led him to create the first mercury thermometer in 1714, and he used this instrument to devise a temperature scale using what units bearing his name?", "correct": "Fahrenheit & degree Fahrenheit & degrees Fahrenheit", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFahrenheit & degree Fahrenheit & degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\tDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686 - 1736) was born in Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland) but spent most of his life in the Netherlands. His mercury thermometers, so much more accurate than the old gas models, revolutionized the understanding of temperature and pressure. \n"}, {"text": "Anders made most of his contributions to meteorology and astronomy, and was the first to realize that the auroras at the poles were caused by magnetism. He is famous today, however, for his temperature scale, now used by most of the world. Which temperature units, based on this scale, are named after him?", "correct": "Celsius & degree Celsius & degrees Celsius", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCelsius & degree Celsius & degrees Celsius.\n\n\tAnders Celsius (1701-1744), a Swede, belonged to a very scientific family: his father and grandfather were both astronomers, and his other grandfather was a mathematician. Among his many important realizations was the fact that the land of Scandinavia is slowly rising above sea level.\r Degrees Celsius are also known as degrees Centigrade, a name derived from the 100-point scale it uses (with 0 as water's freezing point and 100 as its melting point). Thanks to player amyny for this clarification. \n"}, {"text": "William worked largely on the dissipation and conservation of energy and patented some 70 inventions. Among his many accomplishments was supervising the 1866 laying of the first transatlantic cable, but his name endures in his scale measuring temperature from absolute zero. What units does it use?", "correct": "Kelvin & Kelvins", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKelvin & Kelvins.\n\n\tWilliam Thomson (1824-1907), knighted Lord Kelvin, was born in Belfast and educated at Cambridge and Glasgow. A Kelvin is the same in magnitude as a degree Celsius, but is considered a separate unit since it is measured from a different zero. And because it's an absolute unit, it isn't considered a 'degree' either - just a Kelvin. \n"}, {"text": "Pierre came from a family of scientists and spent the early part of his career studying crystallography and piezoelectric effects. Marie received her doctorate degree in physics the same year she won the Nobel Prize. What unit of radioactivity is named for this famous couple?", "correct": "curie & curies", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ncurie & curies.\n\n\tPierre Curie (1859-1906), a Frenchman, married Marie Sklodowska (1867-1934) in 1895. Their ensuing research partnership, in which they laid the groundwork of our modern understanding of radioactivity, is one of the most famous in science. The SI unit of radioactivity is the becquerel; a curie is equal to about 37,000,000,000 becquerels! \n"}, {"text": "James helped develop the law of conservation of energy, one of the most important in modern physics. A corollary to that law, stating that electrical conductors produce heat, bears his name, as does what international unit for energy?", "correct": "joule & joules", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\njoule & joules.\n\n\tJames Prescott Joule (1818-1889), an Englishman, verified the conservation of energy experimentally. Joule's Law, familiar to students of electronics, states that the power (energy per second) dissipated in an electrical circuit is equal to the resistance times the square of the current. \n"}, {"text": "Isaac's contributions to the sciences are legendary. He formulated laws that governed the field of mechanics until Einstein's theory of relativity, and these laws still provide a good understanding of basic mechanics. When the mathematics of his era proved inadequate for the physics he was doing, he derived an entire branch of mathematics. He is honored today in the name of what international unit of force?", "correct": "newton & newtons", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nnewton & newtons.\n\n\tIsaac Newton (1642 - 1727) independently developed calculus at about the same time as Gottfried Leibniz. His three laws of force are the foundation of mechanics. He was the first to realize that 'white' light is actually composed of a spectrum of colors, and he was the first to connect celestial motions with earthly phenomena through the theory of gravitation. As Alexander Pope wrote: 'Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night. God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.' \n"}, {"text": "Blaise did much of his work in mathematics, working with Fermat to formulate the theory of mathematical probability and doing additional work on conical sections. His chief contribution to mechanics, however, was his experiment proving that the level of mercury in a barometer is related to the atmospheric pressure. What unit of pressure is named in his honor?", "correct": "pascal & pascals", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\npascal & pascals.\n\n\tBlaise Pascal (1623-1662), a Frenchman, also wrote extensively on Christian philosophy, using the laws of probability to argue in favor of piety. \n"}, {"text": "James spent his life inventing and refining the modern steam engine, inventing such important techniques as the condensing steam engine, sun-and-planet wheels, and the centrifugal governor for speed regulation. What unit of power is given his name?", "correct": "watt & watts", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nwatt & watts.\n\n\tJames Watt (1736-1819) is generally credited as the father of steam power. His son James, a marine engineer, provided the Caledonia - the first English-built steamship - with her engines. \n"}, {"text": "Heinrich expanded Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic nature of light, proving that electricity can be transmitted in the form of electromagnetic waves. His name is used today for what unit of frequency, one of which is equivalent to a single cycle per second?", "correct": "hertz", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nhertz.\n\n\tThe discoveries of Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894), a German, enabled the invention of the wireless telegraph and the radio. \n"}, {"text": "Anders pioneered the science of the spectral analysis of stars, mapping the solar spectrum for the first time and discovering hydrogen in the atmosphere of the sun. He is remembered today in what unit of length, often used by astronomers to measure light waves?", "correct": "angstrom & angstroms", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nangstrom & angstroms.\n\n\tAnders Jons Angstrom (1814-1874), a Swede, was also the first to examine the spectrum of the aurora borealis - a spectrum is a measurement of the total light emitted by some source.
