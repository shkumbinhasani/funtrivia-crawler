{"id": "397173", "name": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Trivia Game | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "G", "Gn - Gz Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "The Guardians are brought to the Sovereign to protect which of these?", "correct": "Batteries", "options": ["Infinity Stone", "A migration", "Royal entourage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatteries.\n\n\tIn Missouri in 1980, Peter Quill's mother and father park at a Dairy Queen and sneak off into the forest to check on an otherworldly flower planted in the soil.\rThirty-four years later, on The Sovereign, Peter Quill is with his crew, the Guardians of the Galaxy, to protect a set of large batteries from an inter-dimensional being.  While the creature from space crashes down on the battery platform, the team goes to work fighting it while Baby Groot hooks up the tunes.  They only play until Drax crashes into the speakers and decides he needs to kill the beast from the inside, leaping into its mouth.  While he fights inside, the others create a plan to attack its neck wound from outside, allowing Gamora to disembowel it and free Drax from within.\rUltimately the mission is a success.  The Annulax Batteries are protected and the creature is destroyed with no casualties.  Their reward from the Sovereigns: Gamora's sister, Nebula, who tried to steal them herself.\rAs the guardians depart, Ayesha, the Sovereign leader, is asked about his heritage, and while he doesn't know where his father came from, he knows his mother was from Earth.  That said, the Ayesha believes him to be a hybrid with a reckless other side. \n"}, {"text": "The Guardians meet Ego on which planet?", "correct": "Berhert", "options": ["Xandar", "Knowhere", "Contraxia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBerhert.\n\n\tAs the Guardians depart with Nebula in tow, Rocket reveals that he actually nabbed some of the Annulax Batteries himself.  While Quill ponders his parents on the Milano, the ship is approached from behind by a remotely-piloted Sovereign drone fleet, there to collect their stolen items.  The chase pushes the Milano into a quantum asteroid field where, while Rocket and Quill bicker, the numbers are thinned and the ship takes a significant amount of damage, so much so that the rear of the craft is blasted off and Drax is forced to tether himself in and launch out the back to take down the final drone.  They make it out the other side of the field, but find themselves bombarded by the drones that went around, and when it looks like they're vastly outnumbered, something saves them, destroying all of the Sovereign crafts.  They make it through their jump-point and, in the most devastating and dangerous way possible, crash-land on the planet Berhert.\rWhile the Guardians argue about their destroyed ship and place blame all around, the person who saved them lands in the forest nearby and emerges from a rounded craft, revealing himself to be none other than Ego-- Peter Quill's father. \n"}, {"text": "Who does not initially join Ego in traveling back to his homeworld?", "correct": "Rocket", "options": ["Gamora", "Drax", "Peter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRocket.\n\n\tOn the planet Contraxia, Quill's former mentor, Yondu Udonta, celebrates with his crew before he's met by Stakar Ogord, his own former mentor, who's exiled him and the Ravagers of his crew for trafficking children across the galaxy for money.  Stakar departs, but Yondu's crew talks behind his back, concerned that their leader may be going soft.  That's when Ayesha, of the Sovereign people, comes by with a job.\rOn Berhert, Ego explains that he hired Yondu way back when to retrieve Peter from Earth when his mother passed away, but for some reason, he kept him instead of making the delivery.  He'd been trying to tack him ever since.  And now that they're reunited, he wishes to take Peter and his crew to the edge of the galaxy, where he's from, to explain everything.  Peter admits to Gamora, in secret, that he doesn't buy it, but Gamora suggests that Quill pursue what's being offered; if Ego is lying, they can kill him.\rQuill, Gamora, and Drax head off with Ego while Rocket and Groot stay back at the Milano to make repairs.  They leave Nebula at the ship. \n"}, {"text": "Mantis has which of these abilities?", "correct": "Empathy", "options": ["Technomancy", "Divination", "Celestial power"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmpathy.\n\n\tQuill, Gamora, and Drax take off with Ego and his associate, Mantis, who has the power of empathy and emotional manipulation.  While she shows off these capabilities to her new friends, she says that she mostly uses her powers to help Ego sleep since he spends his nights awake thinking about his progeny.\rBack on Berhert, Yondu and the Ravagers locate the Milano and surround it, but Rocket already has the one-up on them.  While he leaps through the trees, his traps make short work of most of the bounty hunters.  Yondu catches him anyways and, with his men around him, he claims that their plan is not to deliver Quill and the Guardians to Ayesha at all, but to take the batteries and sell them for a fraction of the initial reward to avoid getting pursued by Nova Corps.  The Ravagers hate the idea, feeling it to be selfish, and they suggest that a mutiny might be in order, but the fight comes to an end when Nebula, freed from the Milano by Baby Groot, comes in and puts Yondu and Rocket out of commission. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Peter's mother?", "correct": "Meredith Quill & Meredith", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeredith Quill & Meredith.\n\n\tEgo's ship lands on his home planet, a lush and verdant world no larger than Earth's moon.  It's there that Ego reveals to the others that he is a Celestial, similar to a god, and that the planet is, thus, his creation.  Over a million years, he learned to control the molecules around him and he continued building from there to make the planet.  He wanted more though, and sought life out in the universe, setting out to create what he thought biological life looked like so that he could experience what it was like to be human.  And he found life on other planets, sure enough.\rEgo met Quill's mother, Meredith, not long after, finding true love with her.  From that love, Peter was made.  When he heard of a man who held an Infinity Stone without dying, he knew that Peter was still out there.  Ego begs Peter to let him be the father that Meredith would've wanted him to be, and he teaches Peter how to manipulate molecules using Celestial powers.  It's all the proof Peter needs to believe.\rMantis and Drax talk alone, bonding as they talk frankly about their pasts.  Mantis uses her powers to understand Drax's grief and, seeing it, she tries to tell him something but finds herself interrupted by Gamora. \n"}, {"text": "All of Yondu's loyal men are killed.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOn the Ravager ship, Taserface takes over as the new captain as the Ravager men launch Yondu's supporters out of the airlock one by one.  Nebula stops them before they can kill Rocket-- Ayesha wants the honour, of course-- and asks for a few things before taking their finest warship and flying off to Ego's planet herself, first to fight Gamora and kill her and then second to go after her father, Thanos, for what he's done to her.\rRocket and Yondu end up locked away together where the latter, stating his regrets, wishes he didn't break the code and lose Stakar.  The two get Groot to help them out, using him to retrieve Yondu's spare head fin, even if it takes a bit of trial and error to figure out what exactly he needs to grab.  Yondu's last remaining loyalist helps out and he, Yondu, Rocket, and Groot stage a grand escape, killing the mutineers on their way out.  Though the Sovereign is alerted of the jailbreak, none of the Ravagers remain by the end, and neither does the ship.  They get out on Yondu's personal craft, taking a direct trip through hundreds of jumps to Ego's planet. \n"}, {"text": "Gamora and Nebula fight with one another, inevitably coming across which of these in a cave on Ego's planet?", "correct": "Skeletons", "options": ["Peter's mother", "Secret lab", "Old spaceships"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkeletons.\n\n\tGamora worries more about Ego and his planet and Quill takes it negatively, feeling that he finally found his family and Gamora set out to ruin it.  Heading out, Gamora is the only one around when Nebula arrives in the Ravager ship to battle.  Nebula crashes her ship in her rage giving Gamora the opportunity she needs to fight back and subdue her sister.  Despite the attempted murder, Gamora goes back to save Nebula, pulling her from the ship just before it explodes, and the two fight hand-to-hand until Nebula states that she finally won.  The argument leads to Nebula admitting that she only ever needed a sister-- not a combatant-- and they both apologize for what their father made them do.\rPeter, meanwhile, talks with his own father back in his room.  Ego tells him that as long as the light within the planet continues to glow, both of them will be immortal beings, but there's something else.\rMantis, listening in on Ego and Peter in their room, runs to tell Drax the truth: they're all in danger.\rIn the cave, Gamora and Nebula find countless bones, all skeletons of beings from other worlds. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name that Ego gives to his master plan?", "correct": "The Expansion", "options": ["The Distention", "The Purification", "The Completion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Expansion.\n\n\tEgo tells Peter that everything including his friends are limited; the two of them are eternal but there's more to do.  When Ego found life, it was disappointing.  He came to a realization at that time because his desire to find life was not to walk among it, but to grow over it.  He shows Quill his plan-- The Expansion-- in which he planted thousands of extensions of himself on planets around the universe.  When those extensions are activated, he will spread, covering everything.  The problem is that he needs two Celestials to perform the feat.  He coupled with thousands of beings in hope that one of his progeny would bear the Celestial powers but none did, and when Yondu, who he hired to deliver the children, dropped them off on his planet to do this, they were killed.  Peter was the first success.\rPeter worries about his friends, but Ego says that they're beyond such things.  Quill also asks about Meredith.  Ego came back to Earth to see her three times but couldn't stay or else his whole project would've gone under.  Instead, he placed a tumour in her to kill her and avoid being tempted to return.\rQuill, horrified that Ego killed his mother, shoots at him several times, but the Celestial being, reigning supreme on his own planet, immediately takes control and taps into his son's powers before crushing his Walkman.  Their powers are certainly more than enough to jump start The Expansion, and they do, just as Yondu and Rocket crash through the ceiling, crushing Ego in his palace. \n"}, {"text": "Who is required to place the bomb in the core of Ego's planet?", "correct": "Groot", "options": ["Peter", "Rocket", "Nebula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGroot.\n\n\tThe Guardians know that they have little time to waste on a reunion and Mantis informs them that Ego's brain is located in the caves beneath the planet.  Quill and Yondu argue about the good fortune that convinced Yondu to keep Peter (after he saw what was happening to the other deliveries), but the two of them work together to dive into the core using the ship's lasers, combining them all and cutting directly into the thick ore.\rAt the same time, the Sovereign's forces show up, and the Guardians have to split up to accomplish everything.  Drax, Gamora, and Mantis fall to the cave surface as Ego locates them all, and using Mantis' empathy powers, she forces Ego to fall asleep, if only temporarily.  Quill, Rocket, and Groot head to the core where Groot is left to learn how to use a bomb to destroy the planet (making use of the Annulax Batteries).\rOn Yondu's craft, Nebula uses her arm to power up the laser cutters and blast the Sovereign drones out of the sky.  The ship is destroyed, but all of the Guardians and their allies make it to the surface alive. \n"}, {"text": "Who saves Peter when Ego's world is destroyed?", "correct": "Yondu", "options": ["Gamora", "Rocket", "Groot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYondu.\n\n\tMantis is knocked out by some debris, losing her grip on Ego.  He awakens immediately after, but it gives Groot the opportunity to follow the light and deliver the bomb.  Drax takes Mantis to the surface to await Yondu's ship, but Ego lashes out.  Gamora falls through the planet, only getting saved by her sister as they ascend to the surface.  Rocket, Quill, and Yondu fight, meanwhile, as Ego still wishes to destroy all life in the universe.  Ego appears before his son and takes control, entrapping all of the Guardians before tapping into Peter's latent energy once more.  Worlds begin to wipe out.\rYondu is silenced, but before he is, he reminds Peter that he doesn't use his head to unleash his weapon.  With the Celestial powers within him, Peter lashes out, breaking free of his father and loosening the energy binding the others.  Groot at this time, is able to arm the bomb and hit the right button to set the timer.\rRocket comes back for Yondu, but Yondu stays back to help Peter.  As the timer counts down and Rocket returns to the ship, he has them take off to avoid risking more lives.  Peter keeps Ego down on his planet though, forcing him to remain as the bomb goes off, destroying him.  It causes the planet to collapse, and Ego and the Celestial light go with it.  As Peter kneels in the destruction, he's saved at the last moment by Yondu, who flies him into the sky and out into space.  Doing right by the boy he saved, Yondu gives him the only protective pack before freezing to death in the vast expanse.\rA funeral is held during which Peter admits that Yondu was his father more than anyone else.  Sometimes, he says, what you want is sometimes right there the whole time.\rGamora asks Nebula to help the Guardians but Nebula, assured of what she must do, leaves with the aim to kill Thanos.  They embrace before Nebula leaves.\rKraglin, Yondu's lone loyalist, hands Peter a Zune from Earth.  Peter, in return, gives him Yondu's arrow, repaired by Rocket.\rYondu is cremated and his ashes are launched into space.  The Ravagers, made aware of Yondu's sacrifice, arrive for the funeral, launching fireworks in memoriam. \n"}]}
