Rachel's only there to pick up work though she offers vocal coaching in case Quinn wants to up her A-game for Sectionals.  Quinn has other plans though; she wants to alert the school's higher-ups to the fact that Puck and Shelby Corcoran have been sleeping together-- she heard it from Puck himself.  Rachel says that Puck is 18 so it's completely legal, and even if Shelby does get fired, she'd just be making Beth's life all the worse...and if she does that, then she's really hit rock-bottom.\rWhile Will tries to get Finn to think about the Sectionals setlist, Finn thinks that they need to think about their roster-- they need star power when they step on the stage in their auditorium.  Sam Evans, he thinks, would be a good idea.  Will says that Sam moved away to Kentucky, but Finn reasons that it isn't that far away. \n"}, {"text": "When Rachel and Finn find Sam working for a strip joint, what is his stage name?", "correct": "White Chocolate", "options": ["Trouty Mouth", "Mister Package", "Stallion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite Chocolate.\n\n\tKurt is worried that his chances at NYADA are botched and Blaine says that he's worried about New Directions' chances at Sectionals, especially since he thinks Finn won't let him contribute ideas.  Over coffee at the Lima Bean, they're approached by the Warblers' Sebastian.  Sebastian starts to flirt with Blaine and notes the Warblers' Sectionals win.  When Blaine gets up for a coffee, Kurt and Sebastian swap insults, Kurt making it very clear that he does not like anything about him.  They keep their argument quiet when Blaine returns.\rRachel and Finn travel to Kentucky to locate Sam and they reach their final destination, an establishment known as Stallionz.  They attempt to reason that it's a dinner theater but when Sam emerges onstage it turns out that he's a male stripper.  Rachel asks Finn for a dollar and she approaches the stage. \n"}, {"text": "Do Sam's parents agree with his decision to return to Ohio?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tRachel and Finn have a talk with Sam backstage and he explains that while his dad got a construction job to pay the bills, he earns a lot of money onstage to pay for his and his siblings' luxuries.  His parents don't know.  Sam admits that he wants to go back to McKinley, but that his parents would never let him.  Finn convinces him to try, so they head to Sam's place.\rSam's parents are assured that Sam would be able to stay with either Rachel or Finn in Ohio and he'd be able to go to school with them and compete in Sectionals.  Both his mom and dad feel it's only fair to send him along because of what he's done for the family.  Sam is eager to return since it allows him to become a teenager again. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first to suggest that she and Sam should date again?", "correct": "Quinn", "options": ["Santana", "Mercedes", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn.\n\n\tPuck, Mike, Tina, Artie, and Kurt worry in the choir room; they're bringing along only a handful of their usual musicians and they're still downtrodden.  Quinn, however, says she knows for a fact that they're winning.\rWill brings good news.  Sam enters the room and says that true friends have helped him find his way back.  They start with the songs right away and pour some champagne in red plastic cups.  Sam hops onto the guitar and begins to sing Toby Keith's \"Red Solo Cup\".  After the song, Santana comes into the room excited to insult her ex-boyfriend...she even has a small notebook full of long-waiting put-downs.  Sam doesn't let it phase him.\rIn the halls, Quinn and Shelby pass in the halls and give each other an angry passing glance.  Quinn approaches Sam instead and suggests that they get back together, apologizing for not appreciating him the previous year.  Sam says that she has 'rich, white girl problems' and suggests that she enjoy her senior year to the fullest-- she only gets one. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Finn claim is the most well-rounded member of the New Directions (with Rachel out of commission)?", "correct": "Blaine", "options": ["Kurt", "Himself", "Sam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlaine.\n\n\tTina says that Mike should send a video of Mike's dancing to the universities he's applying for-- deadlines are this week.  Mike says that he already applied to Stanford for pre-med and she's surprised that he's not following his dreams.  He says that it's easier for everyone if he just does what his father wants.  That way, they'll be on talking terms again.\rIn the choir room, the guys worry about their showing at Sectionals, especially since they're running out of female teammates.  While practicing some new moves, Sam suggests that they use sexuality to sell their performance and while many of the guys feel like this is a strong asset, Blaine doesn't want to sell out.  Finn finds Blaine punching a bag in the locker room and he admits that he was jealous of Blaine when he first arrived at McKinley.  Finn apologizes and says that now that Rachel can't help them, Blaine is the most well-rounded member of New Directions.  They need his help to achieve the impossible this year. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Tina offer a copy of \"West Side Story\"?", "correct": "Mike's father", "options": ["Mike's mother", "Sam", "Sue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike's father.\n\n\tIn the halls, Sam grabs Mercedes' hand and she's surprised.  He says that he heard about her new boyfriend and she says that she'll always have a special place in her heart for him.  She suggests he move on and walks away but as he says he'll fight to get her back, she can't help but smile.\rTina visits Mike's father and leaves a copy of the school's production of \"West Side Story\".  She says that he needs to watch it and realize that his son loves to dance, and he shouldn't throw it all away.  He sits her down and tells her that children don't know everything; she'll experience too much rejection and heartache to be able to call performing her dream.  She says that it doesn't matter-- she was born to do it-- and so was Mike.\rWhen Sectionals arrives, Mike tells Tina that speaking to his father is making things worse.  He almost didn't let him come to the competition. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not a judge at this year's Sectionals?", "correct": "Sister Mary Constance", "options": ["Tickles the Clown", "Brandy Engelbert", "Judge Dorothy Saunders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSister Mary Constance.\n\n\tShelby and the Trouble Tones stop by the choir room to wish their competitors good luck and state that they have a contingency plan.  Should the Trouble Tones win the competition, they say, they will gladly allow any of the New Directions to join in time for Regionals.  The New Directions are a bit off-put by this and vow to beat them onstage.  Quinn steps forward and says they've got it in the bag-- Puck, of all people, will be their shining star.  Shelby is surprised by this bold claim.\rThe curtains open and Finn joins Rachel in the audience.  The judges for this year's ceremonies are introduced: From the local DMV, Brandy Engelbert, from the 11th District Court of Appeals, Judge Dorothy Saunders, and Western Ohio's top birthday clown (three years-running), Tickles. \n"}, {"text": "From which city do The Unitards hail?", "correct": "Defiance", "options": ["Toledo", "Canton", "Gahanna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDefiance.\n\n\tThe show begins with The Unitards hitting the stage.

She sings \"Buenos Aires\" from \"Evita\", a song Rachel says she should be singing instead.  Will and Emma are both a bit worried after the number is over and Rachel follows Quinn out of the auditorium.\rIn the halls, Rachel asks Quinn what she's doing and Quinn responds that she can do whatever she wants.  Rachel suggests that they wait until after the Trouble Tone perform to avoid ruining the work they put into it.\rIn the choir room, Quinn speaks to Shelby who remains calm throughout their talk.  Shelby says she's ending everything with Puck, whatever there is to end anyways, and she suggests that Quinn stop wasting her youth away.  She plans on enjoying her last few hours as a teacher at McKinley in case Quinn decides to act like a child and tell Principal Figgins the truth.\rThe Trouble Tones take to the stage with Santana and Mercedes singing a mash-up of Gloria Gaynor's \"I Will Survive\" and Destiny's Child's \"Survivor\".

Beginning with an upbeat performance of the Jackson Five's \"ABC\" with many of the performers taking on lead vocals, Tina and Mike are worried to see Mike's father take a seat in the audience.  As the song progresses, much of the crowd rises to their feet; Mercedes giggles over Sam's dance moves.  Quinn introduces the second song choice, Janet Jackson's \"Control\", which features more intricate dance moves.  Once again, the crowd rises.  This time, the lights go out as they head into a third and final song: Michael Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\" with each of the guys taking on a different role in the lead vocals.  When their setlist ends, the crowd gives a standing ovation-- even Mr. Chang.  Puck and Quinn hug each other.  Rachel applauds from the crowd during her first sat-out performance.\rEveryone in the group is thrilled by their showing onstage.  Mike's father asks to speak to him and Tina in the hall.  He finally realized that it's Mike's true path.  It's what he does and he does it well.  Mike realizes that he's already missed the deadlines for dance schools, but Tina claims that she already sent in his applications for him ahead of time. \n"}, {"text": "Which group wins the first place trophy at Sectionals?", "correct": "New Directions", "options": ["The Trouble Tones", "The Unitards", "It's a tie!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Directions.\n\n\tAll three groups head to the stage for the final results of their Sectionals performances and Tickles the clown announces.  Third place, it turns out, goes to The Unitards.  Kurt congratulates Harmony and says that she did very well.  She's thrilled-- she's only a sophomore, she says, and she's already this good.  Next year will be a bloodbath.  Finally the first place winners are rewarded with their trophy.  It's New Directions!\rRachel returns from the principal's office the next day and announces the end of her suspension; Quinn is in the waiting room.  She says she's not telling Figgins about Shelby; she realizes, thanks to Rachel's words, that she wants Beth to be happy, and the best way for that to happen is for Shelby to stay with her.  Quinn asks Rachel about Yale and says that she might apply for their drama program.\rIn the girls' bathroom, Quinn stops by to see Mercedes, Brittany, and Santana.  The girls don't want to return to New Directions to play second fiddle to Blaine and Rachel but Quinn says that she doesn't want to miss out on the best possible last year of high school.  Besides, she's already spoken to Mr. Schuester and Rachel and they both agreed that it would be great to have a Trouble Tones number for each competition to ensure that everyone gets their chance.\rIn the end, the New Directions go to the auditorium to celebrate with a song.  As they begin to sing \"We Are Young\" by Fun, Mercedes, Brittany, Santana, and Sugar join in, and the McKinley show choir is reunited at last. \n"}]}
