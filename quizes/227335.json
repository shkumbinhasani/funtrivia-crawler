{"id": "227335", "name": "10 Brokeback Mountain Questions |      Movies Trivia Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Brokeback Mountain"], "questions": [{"text": "When I first heard the buzz about \"Brokeback Mountain\", I assumed that the film was going to be set in the Old West (say, the 1870s). I was way off!  According to a title card we see at the beginning of the film, in what year does the plot begin?", "correct": "1963", "options": ["1973", "1953", "1943"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1963.\n\n\tAs Ennis Del Mar hops out of a truck, a title card tells us that it is 1963. By the end of the film, it's almost twenty years later, according to Ennis' dialogue. \n"}, {"text": "In which U.S. state is the titular Brokeback Mountain located?", "correct": "Wyoming", "options": ["Montana", "Texas", "Colorado"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWyoming.\n\n\tThe opening title card, in addition to giving us the year, also gives us a location: Signal, Wyoming. There are also numerous references in dialogue placing Brokeback Mountain, the setting for most of Jack and Ennis' liaisons, in Wyoming. \n"}, {"text": "Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) meet while working as a two-man sheep-herding team up on Brokeback Mountain. Which man clearly initiates their first romantic encounter?", "correct": "Jack & Jack Twist & Twist", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack & Jack Twist & Twist.\n\n\tOn a very cold night that finds the two men sharing a small tent, Jack takes Ennis' hand and draws his arm across his own torso in an attempt to \"spoon\". Ennis awakens and initially responds angrily, even violently...but Jack quickly makes his amorous intentions clear, and Ennis responds in kind. \n"}, {"text": "Within a few years of their meeting, both Jack and Ennis have taken wives and become fathers. Which is NOT the name of one of their children?", "correct": "Monroe", "options": ["Jenny", "Bobby", "Alma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonroe.\n\n\tEnnis and his wife Alma have two daughters, Alma (Alma Junior, technically) and Jenny. Jack has a son named Bobby.  \r Monroe is the name of the man who becomes the second husband of Ennis' ex-wife after their divorce. \n"}, {"text": "The father of Jack's wife Lureen (Anne Hathaway) is a very successful man. What does he do for a living?", "correct": "He sells farm equipment.", "options": ["He is an attorney.", "He is a politician.", "He owns a professional sports team."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe sells farm equipment.\n\n\tJack winds up working for his father-in-law, selling combines, tractors, and the like. Lureen also works in the family business, apparently as a bookkeeper. \n"}, {"text": "Jack and Ennis, despite being married to women, continue to see each other romantically over the years, usually back up on Brokeback Mountain, where it all began. What do they tell their wives that they are doing on these retreats?", "correct": "fishing", "options": ["hunting", "camping", "writing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfishing.\n\n\tThere's a pretty intense scene in which Ennis' ex-wife Alma calls him out on the fact that his \"fishing trips\" never resulted in any fish. She had, years eariler, witnessed her husband and Jack in a passionate embrace (without their knowledge), so she more or less knew all along what was going on. \n"}, {"text": "Some scenes in the film take place on holidays. Which holiday do we NOT see depicted?", "correct": "Valentine's Day", "options": ["Thanksgiving", "All of these holidays are depicted in the film", "Independence Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nValentine's Day.\n\n\tWe see Ennis kick around a couple of \"Hell's Angels\" types as the familiar fireworks of Independence Day play out in the background. Later in the film, we see the traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner play out in the lives of both Jack and Ennis.\r There's never a reference to Valentine's Day. \n"}, {"text": "Jack's father-in-law (Graham Beckel) doesn't like him very much.  In fact, he never calls him by his name in the film.  What dismissive nickname does he use for his son-in-law at least twice in the film?", "correct": "Rodeo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRodeo.\n\n\tL.B. Newsome calls Jack \"Rodeo\". His apparent disdain for the rodeo kind of confused me at first, since his beloved daughter Lureen also worked the rodeo circuit (in fact, that's where she met Jack!)...but I'm betting he figured that Jack, unlike his daughter, wasn't smart or cultured enough to be anything BUT a rodeo performer. \n"}, {"text": "Both Jack and Ennis are only children.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tEnnis makes a point of noting that he has at least one brother and one sister -- they more or less raised him after their parents died in a car accident.\r I don't recall whether Jack mentions having any siblings, but the scene in which Ennis meets Jack's parents doesn't seem to suggest that Mr. and Mrs. Twist have any other children. \n"}, {"text": "As the closing credits start to roll, a song begins to play.  Which country superstar sings it?", "correct": "Willie Nelson", "options": ["Hank Williams, Jr.", "Travis Tritt", "Garth Brooks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWillie Nelson.\n\n\tWillie Nelson performs \"He Was a Friend of Mine,\" a song that was actually written by Bob Dylan. \n"}]}
