{"id": "327392", "name": "\"Hairography\" Quiz / Test | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "When Will visits Jane Adams Academy, what is nearly stolen from him?", "correct": "His wallet", "options": ["His watch", "His tie", "His car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis wallet.\n\n\tSue comes up to will in the teacher's lounge and lets him know that she's still expecting the New Directions Sectionals setlist on her desk.  While Will assumed she wouldn't care about Glee Club anymore, he agrees to give the list to her.  Recently, Sue has been a bit bothersome by getting her Cheerios to spy on the club and asking for the competitors' addresses. When Will asks Emma what he should do in case Sue has been leaking the setlist, she suggests that he go to one of the competitors, Jane Adams Academy, and ask their director if any unfair stuff has been going on.  When Will arrives, it turns out that the school is for female child delinquents and looks more like a prison than a school. On the way into Ms. Hitchins' office, Will's wallet is taken by one of the students, but he gets it back.  When Will asks Ms. Hitchins about the setlist, she says that she and her girls wouldn't risk their club through cheating...besides, her school would probably win; they saw their Invitationals number. \n"}, {"text": "When the Jane Adams Glee Club performs for New Directions, what Destiny's Child song do they use?", "correct": "Bootylicious", "options": ["Survivor", "Jumpin' Jumpin'", "Independent Woman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBootylicious.\n\n\tTo make it up to Ms. Hitchens, he allows her Glee kids to use the auditorium at McKinley for a performance and a friendly scrimmage.  She accepts and Will gathers his kids into the audience to watch what they have to offer.  It turns out that their number is quite well-choreographed.  The girls of Jane Adams use Destiny's Child's song, \"Bootylicious\".  By the time the girls leave the auditorium, Will is more than worried. Rachel assures him that New Directions is better because the Jane Adams girls used 'hairography'.  In other words, they used smoke and mirrors, flailing their hair around to distract the audience from their mediocre singing and dancing. In the choir room, Will announces that their new number for Sectionals will be the title track from the musical \"Hair\".  To go with this, he has wigs for all of them.  Rachel is apprehensive saying that they don't need this gimmick, but Will is too worried to go without saying that they need to pull out all the stops. \n"}, {"text": "According to Terri's sister, Kendra, what type of drinks should Quinn avoid now that she's pregnant?", "correct": "Rum-based drinks", "options": ["Hot drinks in general", "Soda", "Coffee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRum-based drinks.\n\n\tQuinn, now feeling more of the effects of her pregnancy, is starting to trust Puck more as he's giving her acceptance and support in regards to the baby.  Although everyone can be distracted enough, Quinn feels like she's under siege, particularly from Terri and her sister, Kendra, who says it's okay for her to smoke and drink as long as she stays out of the hot tub and avoids rum (after all, she and Terri turned out fine).  Quinn decides that she should give Puck a test drive before making any decisions about her baby or boyfriend and plots to get Finn a distraction. How?  She contacts Kurt and proposes a makeover. He's instantly in on the idea as he says \"makeovers are like crack\".  When he discovers he's supposed to give Rachel the makeover, he hesitates as she's a bit of a challenge (she proves this by wearing a pantsuit to school) but he agrees. \n"}, {"text": "What does Terri buy to distract Will?", "correct": "A car", "options": ["A model train", "A vacation", "A crib"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA car.\n\n\tAt home, Terri and Will head to bed and while Will tries to be intimate, Terri is frightened that he'll discover that she's not pregnant.  She wards him off for now, but she's worried that he'll find out the truth soon.  She decides she needs more time but she has to find a distraction for him.  She surprises him the next day with a car, a blue bomber, like the one they drove to prom.  He loves it.  When they talk about it, Kendra brings Quinn over and Terri has to get Will out of the picture for a while.\rThe next day, Kurt gives Rachel her makeover.  She asks him why he's doing it for her and he explains that she needs to look better.  While she has amazing talent, all he can think about is her outfits and her personality which drive him away.  Instead, he wants her to have a look that makes all the guys do a double-take.  Rachel tells him her secret: she loves Finn.  When Kurt discovers this, he hides the fact that he also has a crush on Finn and he tells her that Finn likes 'loose' women.  The plan?  Give her a makeover like Sandy in \"Grease\".\rWhen Terri and Kendra speak to Quinn, it turns out that she has news that would displease them: she's keeping the baby. \n"}, {"text": "According to Mr. Rumba, why is he deaf in one ear?", "correct": "Scarlet Fever", "options": ["Boating accident", "Tuberculosis", "Chicken Pox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScarlet Fever.\n\n\tAt school, the director of the Glee Club for McKinley's other competitors, Haverbrook School for the Deaf, ends up stopping into Will's office to complain about a lack of courtesy.  While the Jane Adams girls were invited to perform, his deaf students were not.  Although Will has a hard time talking with Mr. Rumba because of a problem with deafness in one ear (from Scarlet Fever) they set up a scrimmage in the choir room on Monday.\rKendra and Terri try to figure out a plan for the baby.  While Quinn is no longer willing to give up her child, Kendra plans to convince her otherwise by paying her to babysit her kids.  She claims that five minutes alone with them would be enough to get her to reconsider.  The decision is to distract her with reality.  It's genius. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Will ask to teach the Glee kids about hairography?", "correct": "Brittany", "options": ["Santana", "Rachel", "Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrittany.\n\n\tRachel goes to school the next day with her new look and immediately distracts Finn, taking his attention and making him forget what he's going to say.  Rachel invites him over for Friday so that they can practice their hair number and he immediately agrees.  Finn heads down the hall to Quinn to ask if he can go out on Friday night and she says it's fine.  She has to babysit anyways.  When he leaves, she heads back down the hall to ask Puck if he would like to join her in looking after Kendra's kids.\rIn Glee Club, Will asks Brittany to lead the class in learning hairography.  She instructs them well by saying it's like getting tazered.  She also refers to it as 'cool epilepsy'.  During this, Will spots Sue watching from the window and rushes outside to confront her.  She admits to watching in on them because she's angry that he's using hairography; it distracts from real talent.  She says she wants the setlist on her desk the next day and he disagrees with her request.  She decides to reinstate herself as co-director in lieu of his decision. \n"}, {"text": "How many kids does Kendra have?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Five", "Four", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tWhen Finn goes to Rachel's to practice, she suggests they perform \"You're the One That I Want\" from \"Grease\" like they did during his first Glee rehearsal and she steps out of her bathroom dressed like Olivia Newton-John from the movie.  They start to sing, but Finn stops them saying that he liked her more before she started dressing differently.  In fact, he had this exact type of talk with Kurt a week earlier.  Finn decides to leave.\rMeanwhile, Puck and Quinn are tied up looking after Kendra's three obnoxious boys, literally.  While they struggle to untie themselves from two chairs, Puck fumbles texting on his phone.  He claims he was texting Mike Chang before they free themselves.  To get the kids to settle down, Quinn suggests that she sing to them while Puck plays guitar.  While the kids sit down, Quinn sings Madonna's \"Papa Don't Preach\".  By the time Kendra and Terri get home, the kids aren't only sleeping, but they took baths.  They're shocked by the obedience.  Quinn is convinced that Puck is willing to help out.\rWill talks with his brother-in-law about the new car and realizes that a car seat won't fit inside.  Although the car is a great distraction, a baby still needs a spot inside. \n"}, {"text": "What song do the kids from Haverbrook School of the Deaf sing for New Directions?", "correct": "Imagine", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nImagine.\n\n\tRachel confronts Kurt the next day at school claiming he set her up.  She soon comes to realize that he loves Finn too and Kurt responds saying that neither of them can have him since he and Quinn are having a baby together.  They're both just distractions.\rQuinn is confronted by Santana as well.  In this odd encounter, Santana tells Quinn to back off because she and Puck have been together for a while.  She also reveals that Puck wasn't texting with Mike Chang at all.  Instead, he was 'sexting' with her the whole time he was babysitting with Quinn.\rThis being Monday, New Directions shows their scrimmage number to the deaf choir from Haverbrook.  They end up mashing-up the theme from \"Hair\" with Beyonce's \"Crazy in Love\" and while the number is full of hairography, the kids watching them think they look kind of crazy.  When the kids from Haverbrook go up to do their number, a singing and signing of John Lennon's \"Imagine\", the raw emotion of the song overtakes the kids.  Slowly, the kids from McKinley weave their way into the choir and sing alongside the others. \n"}, {"text": "Sue does not receive the Sectionals setlist from Will.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tQuinn confronts Puck at his locker and discovers that Santana wasn't lying.  Puck says that he won't stop being who he is.  He'll make a good dad, but he won't resist his urges.  Quinn decides to give the baby to Terri anyways because it'll guarantee that the baby will have a good father in Will.  When Will gets home, Quinn hugs him on her way out.  Will has a surprise for Terri too; he got rid of his distraction.  He sold the second blue bomber for a down payment on a minivan so that their whole family can go for the ride.\rAt school, Quinn finds Finn and he admits what he was doing on Friday.  She thanks him for telling the truth and he says he wants to be with her and only her.  As they walk down the hall, both Rachel and Kurt stop to watch them pass by.\rWill apologizes to Sue in her office.  He didn't need to give the kids more 'showbiz'.  He hands her a copy of the setlist (which includes \"Proud Mary\" and a new number). \n"}, {"text": "Where does New Directions sing \"True Colors\"?", "correct": "In the auditorium", "options": ["In the choir room", "In Will's apartment", "In the school hallways"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the auditorium.\n\n\tWill tells the kids to forget everything they 'learned' from hairography and he gives them their new Sectionals number, Cyndi Lauper's \"True Colors\".  The number doesn't require theatricality- they simply sit on stools and sing.  Rachel thanks Mr. Schuester for playing it straight.\rWith the complete setlist in tow, Sue invites Ms. Hitchens and Mr. Rumba to her office to offer them a peek at what New Directions will be using in competition.  She also claims that she can pull strings to get New Directions to perform last, making it seem like they stole their numbers from the other schools.  Both directors show up and are shocked that Sue would even consider.  Sue suggests that they both make a decision never to let themselves get distracted from winning.\rIn the auditorium, Tina leads the group into a rendition of \"True Colors\".  No hair.  No theatrics.  No glamour.  Just vocals. \n"}]}
