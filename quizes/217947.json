{"id": "217947", "name": "Evil, Evil, Evil: Great Movie Villains Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Movie Villains"], "questions": [{"text": "Not often do villainous film roles translate into Oscars, but such was the case for Michael Douglas, who played which slithering bad guy in the 1987 film 'Wall Street'?", "correct": "Gordon Gekko", "options": ["Louis Lynch", "Harry Heinlein", "Frank Farmer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGordon Gekko.\n\n\tWho can forget the immortal line of Gordon Gekko, who said 'Greed is good'?  Gekko applies the rules of the Chinese political philosopher Sun-Tzu to his work.  There are winners and losers, business is a zero-sum game, and 'Every battle is won before it is ever fought.' \n"}, {"text": "One of the most frightening film images of all time comes from the movie 'The Shining' when Jack Nicholson peers evilly through a cracked and tattered door and shouts 'Here's Johnny!'  What is the name of the psychotic character, played by the brilliant Nicholson, in this film?", "correct": "Jack Torrance", "options": ["Dick Hallorann", "Delbert Grady", "Stuart Ullman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Torrance.\n\n\t'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.'\r Seemingly a normal guy at the beginning of the film, the vision of Jack Torrance slowly breaking down and becoming a demented madman is haunting indeed.  Jack seems like the big bad wolf when he shouts for his son to 'Come out, come out, where ever you are.' \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite movie villains is Ramses II, son of Seti and inheritor of the throne in the 1956 film 'The Ten Commandments'.  Which film actor played the jealous and colossally arrogant Ramses in this movie?", "correct": "Yul Brynner", "options": ["Eli Wallach", "Orson Welles", "Charles Laughton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYul Brynner.\n\n\tYul Brynner plays the pharaoh Ramses II to perfection in this film: he's over-the-top wicked.  One of his memorable lines: 'The city that he builds shall bear my name, the woman that he loves shall bear my child. So let it be written, so let it be done.'\r The performance of Anne Baxter as the bitter Nefretiri also deserves mention here. \n"}, {"text": "Several good (or evil) performances were submitted by actors and actresses in the two 'Kill Bill' films.  Who played the role of the heartless Bill in this two-part epic?", "correct": "David Carradine", "options": ["Michael Madsen", "Samuel L. Jackson", "Michael Parks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Carradine.\n\n\tCarradine was great as the nefarious Bill, but he is not the only bad guy to appear in the films.  Daryl Hannah is surprisingly enjoyable as Elle Driver and Michael Madsen submits his usual brutish performance as Budd.  Also very creepy is the performance of Chiaki Kuriyama as the killer schoolgirl ninja Gogo Yubari. \n"}, {"text": "In which Alfred Hitchcock film are there a pair of very calculated villains played by the smooth James Mason and the downright sinister Martin Landau?", "correct": "North by Northwest", "options": ["Psycho", "The Trouble With Harry", "Notorious"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorth by Northwest.\n\n\tAlfred Hitchcock was well-known for letting his 'bad guys' shine, and the performances of Mason and Landau are no exception in 'North by Northwest'.  The film follows the story of Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a man who has had his identity mistaken for that of a government agent.  He is pursued relentlessly by Mason and Landau, resulting in some spectacularly exciting scenes (for example, an attack from a killer airplane). \n"}, {"text": "In which film does a delusional U.S. air force general named Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) succeed in starting World War III through a mad scheme?", "correct": "Dr. Strangelove", "options": ["Mad Max", "Fail Safe", "On the Beach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Strangelove\n\n\tThough 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is supposed to be a comedy, the premise of the film, that a single army general could somehow manipulate protocols and the bureaucracy in order to set in motion World War III, is simply frightening.  \r As Ripper memorably says, 'War is too important to be left to politicians.' \n"}, {"text": "Hollywood has featured a number of corrupt lawmen, but perhaps none more so than prison warden Norton, played by Bob Gunton.  In which popular prison film does this insidious character appear? ", "correct": "The Shawshank Redemption", "options": ["Escape from Alcatraz", "The Great Escape", "The Green Mile"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption.\n\n\tNot only does Norton go through great pains to keep an innocent man named Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) in prison, he goes so far as to kill another prisoner who has exculpating information about Dufresne.  Norton is not the only villain in the film.  Clancy Brown does a fine job as Captain Byron Hadley, a prison guard, and Mark Rolston is terrifying as the brutal prison tough Bogs Diamond. \n"}, {"text": "Most people think of Lex Luthor when they are asked to name a Superman villain.  However, we should not overlook the performance of Terence Stamp from 'Superman II', when he plays which diabolical general?", "correct": "Zod", "options": ["Boog", "Non", "Ursa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZod.\n\n\tFor fans of the 'Superman' series of films with Christopher Reeve, who can forget the moment when the odious General Zod makes the following command: 'Kneel before Zod!'  Supporting Zod in his conquest of Earth are his mute flunky Non and the wicked (but somehow rather sexy) Ursa. \n"}, {"text": "'Mommie Dearest' is a film about a tormented Hollywood icon, Joan Crawford, who carries on an abusive relationship with her adopted daughter Christina.  Who portrays the devilish Crawford to perfection in this film?", "correct": "Faye Dunaway", "options": ["Diane Keaton", "Lauren Hutton", "Anne Bancroft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaye Dunaway.\n\n\tThe world may never know the truth about Joan Crawford's relationship with her children, the film (and book upon which it is based) was created after her death and hence she got to make no defense of herself, or her behavior.  \r However, one thing is for certain, Faye Dunaway's over-the-top performance as the Oscar-winning, classic Hollywood star is a knock-out.  One three word phrase sums it up: 'No wire hangers!' \n"}, {"text": "Which actress had the pleasure of playing the malicious Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 classic 'The Wizard of Oz'?", "correct": "Margaret Hamilton", "options": ["Clara Blandick", "Billie Burke", "Claire Trevor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret Hamilton.\n\n\tIn a movie where most of the cast was under five foot tall, Margaret Hamilton's performance as the malevolent Wicked Witch of the West was towering.  Lines such as 'I'll get you my pretty... and your little dog too!' and 'Who ever thought a little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness?' have been immortalized, thanks to Hamilton's wonderfully sinful performance.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it. \n"}]}
