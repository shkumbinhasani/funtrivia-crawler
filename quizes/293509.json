{"id": "293509", "name": "\"Sly 2\" - \"He Who Tames the Iron Horse\" (PS2) Online Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Sly Cooper Games", "Sly 2: Band of Thieves"], "questions": [{"text": "The location of the game used to be a popular spot for what kind of tourists?", "correct": "Rock Climbers", "options": ["Hawaiians", "Lumberjack Gamers", "Penguins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRock Climbers.\n\n\tDuring a scene, Bentley tells you the old wall hooks you find around were once used by rock climbers.  They are the leftover hooks the climbers did not dislodge from the ice. \n"}, {"text": "What is the title of the very first mission?", "correct": "Cabin Crimes", "options": ["Trout Take", "Cabin Capture", "Fish Frenzy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCabin Crimes.\n\n\tThe level begins in Jean Bison's cabin.  You must take reconnaissance photos of the three routes the Iron Horses take.  While you are doing this, you overhear where Jean Bison hides the blueprints.  They are in fishes mouths about the three cabin mantles, so you must get those, too, during this mission. \n"}, {"text": "Where is the vault located in this level?", "correct": "The cabin on the far left from the Safehouse", "options": ["The cabin on the far right from the Safehouse", "None of these", "Jean Bison's cabin; the middle one"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe cabin on the far left from the Safehouse.\n\n\tThe vault is located in the cabin to the far left.

The mission starts in Jean Bison's cabin, and the second one is the Ponderosa Cabin, no matter what.  You can hear Jean Bison say the name of the cabin when he is telling the other cabin to be on the lookout for Sly, although Jean Bison does not know it is Sly who stole the blueprints. The Ponderosa Cabin is far easier than the next one, as the only guards are birds, some being in the rafters.  If you get caught, you can fight them off.  The next one is much harder, because if you get caught, you can't fight off the four flashlight guards! \n"}, {"text": "What does Jean Bison want to buy from Arpeggio?", "correct": "The Clockwerk Brain", "options": ["The Clockwerk Bladder", "The Clockwerk Heart", "The Clockwerk Liver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Clockwerk Brain.\n\n\tYou can hear Jean Bison talking on the phone with Arpeggio while you steal the blueprints after taking recon photos.

The gas is used to blow off the locks on the trains.  You wear a vacuum pack which sucks in the gas as soon as you pop a balloon.  Since the gas is lighter than air, you bounce very high when you hit a balloon.  This mission uses the paraglide. \n"}, {"text": "Which Clockwerk part do you steal first?", "correct": "Right lung", "options": ["Left lung", "Stomach", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRight lung.\n\n\tYou begin by stealing the right lung, which Bentley does.
