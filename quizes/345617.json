As suspects were narrowed down, contestants were also removed from the game (via a 50% chance vote).  After several episodes, Angel Juarbe Jr. won the $250,000 prize in September 2001.  Tragically, he passed away during 9/11 in the World Trade Centers. \n"}, {"text": "In 1997, the first single from Sarah McLachlan's \"Surfacing\" album won her a Grammy, but what was its title?", "correct": "Building a Mystery", "options": ["Sweet Solution", "Mysterious Stranger", "Detective"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuilding a Mystery.\n\n\t\"Building a Mystery\" became one of Sarah McLachlan's biggest hits in the 1990s and her album, \"Surfacing\", became one of the top-selling Canadian records of the decade.  \"Building a Mystery\" was the album's first single (followed by \"Sweet Surrender\", \"Adia\", and \"Angel\") and it won a Grammy in 1998 on top of Canadian Juno Awards.\rThe success of this album and single bolstered attendance for McLachlan's 'Lilith Fair', a festival supporting female singer-songwriters.

With a sensational title and concept, it sold many copies upon its first release in magazine publications.  Poe, many say, created an exceptional work of proto-detective fiction using Dupin as the scrupulous investigator and instances of ratiocination to solve what many would believe to be an almost uncanny crime.\rIn the story, Dupin tries to solve the murder of two women in Paris.  When he discovers a non-human hair at the crime scene, he must prove the validity of a rather strange conclusion.\r\"Rue Morgue\" later had influence in the horror genre as well; a magazine called \"Rue Morgue\" was created in Canada in the 1990s.
