Exhausted, she made her way through the hallways, yelling for Mike.  Eventually, she came across something out of place-- another portal, this time a small, red window in which she could see flashlights being used.  When the coast was clear, she pushed her way through the entryway and used her powers to crumbled the wall around it, opening it up enough to let her in.  She ended up down a different hallway of the school.\rShe ended up walking to Mike's house to find government officials already there talking to the Wheeler family.  This forced her to hide in the woods instead, alone. \n"}, {"text": "Mike, Will, Dustin, and Lucas dress up as which of these for Halloween?", "correct": "Ghostbusters", "options": ["X-Men", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "The characters of 'Scooby-Doo'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGhostbusters.\n\n\tHopper serves Eleven breakfast as the two of them discuss Halloween.  Eleven, wearing a ghost costume, says she wants to go trick-or-treating but Hopper tells her they can't take the risk because risks are stupid and they're not stupid.  He worries that government agents are still in the area and if they find her, they will take her.  He gives her a compromise.  He can't let her trick-or-treat but he says he'll get off work early, buy some candy, and they can watch a scary movie together.  She agrees to this.\rAt the Byers household, Joyce sets Will up in his costume.  She's made him a Ghostbusters outfit.  In fact, all four of the guys are Ghostbusters.  They all head to school and, to their disappointment, no one is wearing costumes. \n"}, {"text": "Joyce finds a picture in Will's room of the creature from the Upside-Down.  Where does it appear his picture is set?", "correct": "At the Byers household", "options": ["In his fort in the woods", "At the arcade", "At school"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt the Byers household.\n\n\tJoyce finds a drawing that Will did the previous night recalling the horrifying beast he saw when he briefly transitioned into the Upside-Down on the front porch.  She calls Hopper over to look at the image and Hopper can only reiterate what the doctor said to them the day before about trauma.  He thinks that maybe it's a flashback of what he saw when he was there a year earlier, and he tells Joyce that they just need to get through the next few weeks and things will get better.  They share a cigarette and think about old times.\rAt the Department of Energy lab, a scientist walks into the Upside-Down with a case, emerging on the other side with a poor video feed to visit their remote command station and fix a fried piece of equipment.  When he does, the machinery in the lab lights back up. \n"}, {"text": "Who invites Max to go trick-or-treating?", "correct": "Dustin", "options": ["Billy", "Mike", "Will"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDustin.\n\n\tAt school, Nancy believes that she sees Barb in the library but it turns out to be someone else.  She confides in Steve that she just wants to tell Barb's parents the truth so that they don't spend their lives and money looking for her, but Steve tells her they can't risk their families by telling the truth.  He encourages her to come with him to the Halloween party to be normal teenagers for a night.\rIn the halls between class, Dustin and Lucas introduce themselves to Max and she calls them out as stalkers.  They invite her out trick-or-treating with them, but it's clear she doesn't really care to be around.  Nonetheless, they tell her to be at Maple Street at 7:00pm. \n"}, {"text": "According to locals, what keeps dying around Hawkins?", "correct": "Crops", "options": ["People", "Birds", "The American Dream"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrops.\n\n\tAt home, Eleven watches television, changing the channels with her mind, but at some point she hears something outside and finds a squirrel at the feeder.  This reminds her of when winter hit the previous year and she had to use her powers to kill small animals for food.  While she cooked a squirrel over a fire, a hunter found her.  She was able to knock him out, take his jacket and hat, and run.\rHopper returns to the police station to find that the pumpkins from another man's patch have rotted as well.  As it turns out, all of the farmers in the area are having problems with their crops.  Nothing is staying alive.\rAfter school, Max gets into the car and rides home with her step-brother, Billy.  On the drive, Billy speeds down the country roads and nearly hits the boys riding their bikes home in their Ghostbuster costumes.  She's able to swerve the car out of the way, but not before the boys can catch a look at her in the passenger seat. \n"}, {"text": "Will goes trick-or-treating with which of these in tow?", "correct": "A video camera", "options": ["A wagon", "A dog", "A pair of crutches"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA video camera.\n\n\tHopper heads out to the second pumpkin patch in as many days and asks to see how far the damages go.  To his surprise, it stretches out to the woods where some of the trees in the nearby woods also seem to be rotting.  He begins using marking flags to track the trail through the woods.\rJonathan and Will head out to meet up with Will's friends to go trick-or-treating, and while Jonathan is expected to follow along to make sure Will is safe, he decides to let Will go alone with his friends.  He gives Will Bob's video camera and heads out to the party for the older teens. \n"}, {"text": "What is Max's Halloween costume?", "correct": "Michael Myers", "options": ["Princess Leia", "Freddy Krueger", "Jason Voorhees"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Myers.\n\n\tAt the party, new kid Billy does a keg stand to receive the adoration of his new peers.  Of course, winning the best time on the keg stand means he dethrones Steve.  Nancy decides to drink more than she should to forget about things, but Steve stays relatively sober.\rBack at home, Joyce spends her evening with Bob listening to some Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton and dancing.  He suggests that maybe they should move out of Hawkins together.  His parents are moving out of their house in Maine and she can get away from the bad memories in Indiana.  She doesn't give a complete answer before the doorbell rings.\rThe boys, meanwhile, end up trick-or-treating and eventually come across Max dressed as a frightening Michael Myers.  She ends up having them come along with her. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Hopper use to communicate with Eleven when he's not around?", "correct": "Morse code", "options": ["Smoke signals", "Telepathy", "A phone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorse code.\n\n\tHopper continues tracking rotting trees into the night until he makes his way back to the pumpkin patch.  When he gets back, he realizes what he's forgotten; he's late to spend the evening with Eleven.\rEleven is back at home and she realizes how late Hopper is.  She remembers finding the box in the woods though-- the one he kept filling with Eggos after her disappearance.\rDustin and Lucas spend a good chunk of their time with Max and Will realizes how much it's bothering Mike who says she's ruining the best night of the year.  While Mike goes ahead, Will is bothered by some of the older kids and he ends up falling backwards, snapping into the Upside-Down against his will.  He yells for help, but this only seems to attract the attention of something gigantic looming in the distance.  He has no choice but to run for his life, hiding in the ruins of a nearby house until Mike finds him.  Mike offers to take him home; he's bored anyways. \n"}, {"text": "Steve gets drunk at the Halloween party.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tJonathan ends up going to the party (though he doesn't dress up) and he's called out on it as soon as he gets there by a girl named Samantha.  By the time he gets there, Nancy and Steve are arguing; Nancy is drunk and she spills a cup of punch on her shirt.  She goes to the bathroom to clean up and she calls him out on all of the lies that they've been keeping up since Barb died.  It's then that Steve confirms that Nancy doesn't love him, so he leaves the party without her.  Jonathan brings her home and puts her to bed.\rWill tells Mike about what's been happening to him with the Upside-Down.  Mike asks if he's seeing the demogorgon again, but the creature on the other side is much bigger and much more horrifying.  Will promises not to tell the others, and he thinks that if Eleven were around, she would understand. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin gets home from trick-or-treating to find something waiting for him, but where?", "correct": "In a garbage can", "options": ["In his garage", "In his bed", "In his closet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a garbage can.\n\n\tHopper finally makes it back to the cabin and does the knock to get in but the door doesn't open until he asks angrily.  Following a cord, he finds that Eleven is in her room with the TV and he apologizes, but waits in the living room alone with the candy.  He doesn't find out that Eleven is in her room wearing a blindfold.  She flips the channel to static and searches through the darkness to find Will on the walkie talkie in his basement.  She's able to get through to him, but he doesn't believe he hears her and she's forced to watch as he leaves, never knowing.\rDustin gets home after trick-or-treating, once again walking past the garbage can.  This time, however, it makes more concerning noises and he courageously decides to check it out.  Something is inside. \n"}]}
