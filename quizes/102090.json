{"id": "102090", "name": "Canine Genetic Disorders Quiz | Dogs | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Dogs", "Dog Health"], "questions": [{"text": "Only purebred dogs have problems with genetic disorders.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMost disorders are found in mixed breeds as well. If a dog inherits the correct genes for expression of a disorder, it will have that disorder, purebred or not. \n"}, {"text": "This disorder, found most often in the Bedlington terrier, is also known as Wilson's disease.", "correct": "Copper toxicosis", "options": ["Methemoglobinemia", "Iron deficiency", "Goiter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCopper toxicosis.\n\n\tThis error in copper metabolism causes toxic levels of copper to accumulate in the liver. Liver biopsies can detect the disorder. \n"}, {"text": "Found in many breeds, especially large ones, this is the most common inherited skeletal problem in dogs.", "correct": "Hip dysplasia", "options": ["Wobbler syndrome", "Legg-Perthe's disease", "Craniomandibular osteopathy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHip dysplasia.\n\n\tA malformation of the hip joint, hip dysplasia can produce signs varying from absence of symptoms to crippling arthritis. The disorder cannot be cured, but expensive surgery can help prevent further joint damage. \n"}, {"text": "Found primarily in small breeds, but also in a few larger breeds such as the flat-coated retriever, this skeletal abnormality is also known as \"slipping kneecaps.\"", "correct": "Patellar luxation", "options": ["Panosteitis", "Elbow dysplasia", "Osteomyelitis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatellar luxation.\n\n\tPatellar luxation can be treated by surgery that deepens the patellar groove so that the kneecap does not dislocate. \n"}, {"text": "This genetic abnormality is most common in white dogs. ", "correct": "Deafness", "options": ["Blindness", "Polydactyly", "Dwarfism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeafness.\n\n\tSome breeds with high incidences of genetic congenital deafness include the Dalmatian (about 30% are deaf in one or both ears), English Setter, Australian Cattle Dog and Bull Terrier. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following breeds does NOT have a high incidence of genetically-associated cancers?", "correct": "Beagle", "options": ["Bernese mountain dog", "Flat-coated retriever", "Boxer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeagle.\n\n\tAlthough cancer is the leading medical-related cause of death in dogs, beagles have a fairly low rate of cancer. The other three breeds have markedly higher rates of cancers. Over 80% of all deaths of flat-coated retrievers are caused by cancers of various types, especially hemangiosarcoma; a mutation in the p53 gene which normally suppresses tumor growth is suspected. Bernese mountain dogs have a very high rate of histiocytosis. Boxers have a high incidence of mast cell tumors, lymphomas and other cancers. \n"}, {"text": "This breed is subject to a genetic eye disorder that includes inadequate development of the blood vessels that nourish the retina, clefts in the optic disc, and retinal detachment. The effects on the dog range from no symptoms to blindness.", "correct": "Collie", "options": ["German shepherd", "Golden retriever", "Poodle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCollie.\n\n\tThis disorder is known as collie eye anomaly. Other related breeds, such as the border collie and Shetland sheepdog, may also have this condition. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the most common genetic eye defect in dogs has the acronym PRA. What does this stand for?", "correct": "Progressive retinal atrophy", "options": ["Peripheral retinal ablation", "Photo receptor anomaly", "Pupillary reflex anomaly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProgressive retinal atrophy.\n\n\tPRA disorders of several types are common in many breeds, including Irish setters, Siberian huskies, miniature schnauzers, golden retrievers, borzois and cocker spaniels. In all of these disorders, the retina degenerates. In some forms, this occurs early in the dog's life; in some forms it occurs late. This degeneration leads to total blindness. \n"}, {"text": "This is the most common endocrine system disorder in large-breed dogs. ", "correct": "Hypothyroidism", "options": ["Diabetes insipidus", "Pituitary dwarfism", "Hyperthyroidism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHypothyroidism.\n\n\tSeveral breeds, including the golden retriever and Doberman pinscher, have a high rate of hypothyroidism. Symptoms include lethargy, poor haircoat, dry skin, behavioral changes, and intolerance to cold. It can be treated with thyroid hormone replacement. \n"}, {"text": "This inherited bleeding disorder, named for the physician who discovered it, is found in many breeds of dogs. ", "correct": "von Willebrand's disease", "options": ["Hansen's disease", "Rett syndrome", "Plummer's disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nvon Willebrand's disease.\n\n\tThis disorder usually causes only mild symptoms, if any. Although affected dogs may have lengthened bleeding times and experience some problems such as nosebleeds, the disease is usually not serious. Affected breeds include the Doberman pinscher, Shetland sheepdog and golden retriever. \n"}, {"text": "This heart defect, most commonly seen in Newfoundlands and golden retrievers, can cause sudden death in an otherwise healthy dog.", "correct": "Aortic stenosis", "options": ["Tricuspid dysplasia", "Mitral valve insufficiency", "Sick sinus syndrome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAortic stenosis.\n\n\tThis disorder causes narrowing of the aorta, the main artery to the heart. This can lead to changes in the electrical rhythms of the heart that can cause sudden death. Some dogs will also show symptoms of heart failure. \n"}, {"text": "This disorder, most commonly seen in the Doberman pinscher and Great Dane, causes weakness and incoordination of the legs, starting with the rear legs and gradually progressing to total paralysis.", "correct": "Wobbler syndrome", "options": ["Cerebellar hypoplasia", "Fanconi syndrome", "Degenerative myelopathy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWobbler syndrome.\n\n\tAlso known as cervical vertebral instability, this disorder results from abnormalities in the neck vertebrae that lead to compression of the spinal cord. \n"}, {"text": "We are all familiar with seeing tiny dogs- often white toy poodles or Maltese- that tremble continuously. Is this caused by a genetic disorder?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThis is known as \"shaker dog syndrome\" or \"little white shaker syndrome\" and is usually seen in very small white dogs. Surprisingly, Valium is an effective treatment for many affected dogs. \n"}, {"text": "The most common inherited liver disorder in dogs is an abnormality of blood flow in the liver that leads to slow growth, neurological signs, vomiting, diarrhea and kidney stones. What is this disorder?", "correct": "Portosystemic shunt", "options": ["Hepatic lipidosis", "Gastric volvulus", "Chronic hepatitis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortosystemic shunt.\n\n\tPSS can be corrected by surgery. Affected breeds include Yorkshire terriers, miniature schnauzers and Irish wolfhounds. \n"}, {"text": "This disfiguring skin disorder affects Shetland sheepdogs and collies. The skin, especially on the face, tail tip, elbows, hips and toes, can be crusty, blistered and ulcerated, often resulting in permanent scarring. The underlying muscles can also be affected, causing atrophy. ", "correct": "Dermatomyositis", "options": ["Acanthosis nigricans", "Sebaceous adenitis", "Vitiligo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDermatomyositis.\n\n\tSome dogs recover, although they may bear disfiguring scars. Others, especially those with muscular involvement,  have so much damage to the facial region that they cannot eat or drink. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these breeds is subject to the most genetic disorders?", "correct": "German shepherd", "options": ["Golden retriever", "Poodle", "Collie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGerman shepherd.\n\n\tGerman shepherds are subject to over 100 genetic disorders, some found in no other breed. Some of the German-shepherd specific disorders include footpad softness, focal spinal muscular atrophy, giant axonal neuropathy, lumbosacral vertebral stenosis and juvenile hyperparathyroidism.   Some of the disorders found almost exclusively in the German shepherd include degenerative myelopathy, perianal fistulas, glycogen storage disease type III, pannus, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth with immunoglobulin A deficiency, hemivertebra, masticatory muscle myositis and pituitary dwarfism.  Some disorders with a high incidence in German shepherds include epilepsy, hip dysplasia, myasthenia gravis and elbow dysplasia. \n"}, {"text": "Now let's move on to how to prevent these disorders from occurring. First of all, is this a true statement?- If you wish to acquire a dog that is free of genetic disorders, then you are probably better off getting a purebred from someone who is just breeding one litter from their purebred but unregistered non-show dogs than from a breeder with show dogs, because the show dogs are likely to be inbred and have more problems.", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tShow breeders are far more likely to be knowledgeable breeders that health-test their dogs. In addition, it is impossible to trace the genetic lineage of non-registered dogs. \n"}, {"text": "Many pet stores sell puppies with guarantees against genetic disorders. These guarantees are helpful in ensuring a healthy pup.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn almost all cases, the \"guarantees\" are good for only one year. Most genetic disorders show up later in the dog's life. Due to poor breeding practices, pet store pups are a case of genetic Russian roulette. \n"}, {"text": "One of the best ways to prevent genetic disorders is to screen the parent dogs to make sure that they are free of heritable problems. In the United States, one registry that records dogs free of specific diseases is the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA). For which disorders does OFA maintain databases of disease-free dogs?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Cardiac disorders", "Hip dysplasia", "Hypothyroidism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tAlthough it was started as a registry to record dogs free of hip dysplasia, OFA has expanded to record dogs free of other disorders as well, including elbow dysplasia, patellar luxation, cardiac disorders, hypothyroidism, craniomandibular osteopathy and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. \n"}, {"text": "At what age will OFA certify a dog as being free of hip dysplasia?", "correct": "2 years", "options": ["6 months", "1 year", "3 years"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2 years.\n\n\tVets submit x-rays of the dog's hips, taken in specified positions, to OFA. Only dogs free of dysplasia are assigned an OFA rating of Fair, Good or Excellent and are given an OFA number. \n"}, {"text": "What US organization tracks dogs that are free of hereditary eye defects?", "correct": "CERF", "options": ["AVAR", "OFA", "AVMA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCERF.\n\n\tCERF stands for Canine Eye Registry Foundation. Dogs can obtain CERF clearance from certified veterinary opthalmologists beginning at age 6 months. Clearance must be renewed every year. \n"}, {"text": "What hereditary defect can be detected by BAER testing?", "correct": "Deafness", "options": ["Liver problems", "Blindness", "Cardiac defects"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeafness.\n\n\tBAER stands for \"Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response.\" In this painless test, young puppies have electrodes attached to the skin of their heads that can record brain waves caused by detection of sound. Deaf puppies will show no sound-activated brain waves. \n"}, {"text": "What defects are detected by use of a Holter monitor? ", "correct": "Heart rhythm irregularities", "options": ["Bleeding disorders", "Seizures", "Eye disorders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeart rhythm irregularities.\n\n\tA Holter monitor consists of electrocardiogram leads that are attached to the dog's chest and a small pack containing a tape recorder that records the dog's heart rhythms for an extended period. This can detect irregularities that occur sporadically that would not be detected in a one-time test. \n"}, {"text": "When you are buying a dog just to be a pet, health testing is not important.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOn the contrary! A good pet must be healthy! Don't be dissuaded- when you are looking for a dog, demand health testing! \n"}, {"text": "If you are planning on acquiring a purebred dog, which of the following should you do?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Ask to see genetic test results of parents and pups", "Do research on what genetic conditions the breed may have", "Verify test results online"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tBecome an educated buyer! Learn what tests are recommended for your breed and don't buy from a breeder who does not test. OFA and CERF databases are searchable online. We can prevent many of the terrible tragedies of canine genetic disorders- but only if we educate ourselves! \n"}]}
