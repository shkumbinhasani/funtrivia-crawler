{"id": "136811", "name": "Jem in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" Quiz | Literature | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors L-P", " Harper Lee"], "questions": [{"text": "On the very first page of the book the author tells us of Jem's reaction to his arm being broken at the age of thirteen. What was this reaction? ", "correct": "He was not upset once he knew it wouldn't affect him playing football", "options": ["He was very proud of the way he had gotten the injury", "He became very self conscious about the way it stuck out", "He used to boast about how he had stood the pain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was not upset once he knew it wouldn't affect him playing football.\n\n\tIt is only at the end of the book that the author tells us exactly how the injury to Jem came about. If you read the story for the second time, knowing what is going to happen, you realise that Jem seems to have inherited his father's level-headed approach to most things in life. \n"}, {"text": "How does Jem behave when he suddenly starts to remember his mother, who had died when he was six?", "correct": "He would sigh and then go off and play by himself for a while", "options": ["He would get angry and ask Atticus why it had happened", "He would start to cry and lose his temper with Scout", "He would pretend to be cheerful and go on playing with Scout"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe would sigh and then go off and play by himself for a while.\n\n\tJem is not really that demonstrative in his character. His reaction to the memory of his mother is muted. It is not really something that he can share directly with Scout, for she was too young to know her mother at all. On the other hand, Scout seems to have a sympathetic understanding of Jem's need to be by himself. \n"}, {"text": "How did Jem indicate to Scout that Dill was an \"acceptable\" friend for them to have?", "correct": "He told Scout to hush when she questions Dill  about his missing father", "options": ["He said that Dill had a nice name", "He praised Dill for the way in which he told the Dracula story", "He asked Dill to share his glass of lemonade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe told Scout to hush when she questions Dill  about his missing father.\n\n\tJem understands that Dill doesn't want to be questioned about his father.

She takes delight in all the melodramatic details of the Radley story. It is only later that Scout and Jem understand that her version of events is not always to be trusted. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Jem run onto the Radley lot and slap the side of the house even though he is convinced that Boo Radley is dangerous?", "correct": "Dill dares him to and Jem is too proud to run out on a dare", "options": ["Jem believes that he is protecting his little sister", "Dill says he will give him five dollars if he does it", "Scout persuaded him it would be a good idea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDill dares him to and Jem is too proud to run out on a dare.\n\n\tScout comments that Jem had never declined a dare in his life. He also feels that he has to uphold the honour of Maycomb people and of the Finch family. It takes Dill three days to wear him down so that he gives in to the dare. \n"}, {"text": "How does Jem behave when he finds Scout fighting with Walter Cunningham during the dinner hour of her first day at school?", "correct": "He tells her to stop and invites Walter home to dinner", "options": ["He loses his temper with Scout and calls her a bully", "He tells Walter off for fighting with a girl", "He warns them that the teacher will come out and catch them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe tells her to stop and invites Walter home to dinner.\n\n\tJem tells Scout quite reasonably that she is bigger than Walter. He then points out to Walter that Atticus and Walter's daddy are friends. He also points out that Scout won't attack him any more, and this proves to be the truth. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Scout believe that Jem didn't suffer from the Maycomb County School system as badly as she did?", "correct": "She believed that nothing could ever stop Jem from getting the books he wanted", "options": ["She thought Jem wasn't really interested in books", "She thought he wasn't as intelligent as she was", "She thought the teachers would treat him as their favourite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe believed that nothing could ever stop Jem from getting the books he wanted.\n\n\tScout was suffering from the fact that Maycomb County appears to have revised its educational system just as she started school. She considers that Jem was educated on a half \"Duncecap\" and half \"Dewey Decimal System\" basis and that nothing could ever crush his spirit for learning. She felt that she was on a treadmill. \n"}, {"text": "How did Jem react when Scout first told him she had been chewing the pieces of gum she had found in the knot-hole of the tree?", "correct": "He told her to spit them out right away", "options": ["He asked why she hadn't given one piece to him", "He looked at her closely expecting her to die", "He told her she should take them straight to Atticus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe told her to spit them out right away.\n\n\tJem tries to enforce the general rule that you don't just eat the things that you find. Later he worries because the gum came out of a tree on the Radley lot. He even uses the threat of Calpurnia in order to get Scout to obey him. This is unusual because they mostly settle their differences between themselves. \n"}, {"text": "What was Jem's first decision about what they should do with the Indian-head pennies?", "correct": "He decided to wait until school starts and ask everybody who they belong to", "options": ["He decided to ask Mr. Radley if they belonged to him", "He decided to immediately apply the law of \"Finders Keepers\"", "He decided to pass them directly to Atticus for safe-keeping"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe decided to wait until school starts and ask everybody who they belong to.\n\n\tJem is both careful and honest over the business of the pennies and the other objects he finds in the knot-hole of the tree.

Scout declared that Calpurnia said it was \"nigger-talk\" and that Dill shouldn't believe a word Jem said. However, though annoyed, it is pretty certain that Jem never meant his sister to go into the Radley lot. \n"}, {"text": "What did Jem use to borrow from Calpurnia without her knowing so that the three of them could play the Radley game?", "correct": "her scissors", "options": ["her broom", "her black shawl", "her kitchen knife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nher scissors.\n\n\tHe needed to the scissors in order to play out the scene in which Boo is reputed to have attacked his father.

She wants to play with the boys and she wants to dress like a boy. Thus she is always upset when Jem says she is becoming more and more like a \"girl\". It seems like an offence to her pride. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Jem believe that he must go back to the Radley lot to retrieve his trousers?", "correct": "He doesn't want to give Atticus a reason for \"whipping\" him", "options": ["He believes Miss Stephanie will find them", "He thinks that Dill will get into trouble if he doesn't", "He thinks that Boo Radley will get into trouble if he doesn't"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe doesn't want to give Atticus a reason for \"whipping\" him.\n\n\tJem realises that what he did that night was wrong and he doesn't want Atticus to have to punish him. It isn't that he fears the pain; he just doesn't want to lose respect in Atticus's eyes. Scout comments that this is when Jem and she first began to \"part company\" or to look at the world in different ways. \n"}, {"text": "What sort of phase did Jem go through in the sixth grade at school?", "correct": "He got fascinated by the Egyptians and adopted a funny walk", "options": ["He started to enjoy French and put on a silly accent", "He started to copy the war dances of African tribes", "He discovered a fascination for baseball and played constantly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe got fascinated by the Egyptians and adopted a funny walk.\n\n\tScout's education is constantly presented as year after year of boredom.
