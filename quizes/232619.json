In \"Pok\u00e9mon Blue or Red\", he'll let you choose between Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander, but in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", he'll simply give you Pikachu.  When you retrieve a package for him in Viridian City, you'll also be given the Pok\u00e9dex in order to record data about Pok\u00e9mon from all over the Kanto region of the game. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the creator of the Pok\u00e9mon storage system?", "correct": "Bill", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBill.\n\n\tBill can be found in his house on Route 25 to the north of Cerulean City.

He's supposed to be in the Pok\u00e9mon House at the entrance to the tower, but instead, he's trapped on the top floor of the haunted building.  Make your way past the Channelers, Gastlies and Cubones, and reach the top floor.  If you're playing \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", you'll find Jessie and James here, but usually, there'll just be some plain old Team Rocket members blocking your path.  When you get Mr. Fuji out of the castle, all will be well. \n"}, {"text": "During the game, your rival from the start will be a step ahead of you until the end.

Surge, Erika, Koga, Sabrina, Blaine, and Giovanni.

After each battle, you'll receive a new badge and a rare TM to use on a Pok\u00e9mon.  Each badge will do something different.  Some will allow Pok\u00e9mon at a certain level to obey you while some will allow your Pok\u00e9mon to use HMs outside of battle. \n"}, {"text": "What item must you return to the Safari Warden in order to receive HM04?", "correct": "Gold Teeth", "options": ["Pok\u00e9flute", "Lift Key", "HM01"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGold Teeth.\n\n\tIn Fuchsia City's Safari Zone, you may come across a pair of Gold Teeth near the Secret House containing HM03.  If you return this set of dentures to the Safari Warden in his house in Fuchsia City, he'll give you HM04 (Strength) and it can be used to push large boulders outside of battle.  Although this can be done on your first trip to the Safari Zone, you'll need to defeat the proper gym leader before you can use it outside of battle. \n"}, {"text": "What object is given to you by the President of Silph Co.?", "correct": "Master Ball", "options": ["Pok\u00e9dex", "HM05", "Silph Scope"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaster Ball.\n\n\tIf you manage to battle Giovanni and force him to leave the eleventh floor of the Silph Co.

Building, and Viridian City Gym.  Although he's the head of the crime syndicate, Team Rocket, he seems to have plenty of time to get around and battle trainers.  This important individual uses ground-type Pok\u00e9mon (and in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", a Persian).

This duo is first found in Mt. Moon, and they'll appear near Team Rocket throughout the entire game.
