{"id": "117399", "name": "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\" Part 3 Quiz | Movies | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Star Trek", "ST II: The Wrath of Khan"], "questions": [{"text": "Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) sets the stage for a sequel by placing his hand against the temple of the unconscious Doctor Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForrest Kelley) and speaking a single word.  What is the word?", "correct": "remember", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nremember.\n\n\tSpock says, \"Remember.\"  In \"Star Trek III: The Search For Spock,\" it's explained that Spock was transferring his \"katra,\" or spiritual essence, into McCoy's psyche for later retrieval. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following characters is still alive at the end of this film?", "correct": "Dr. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick)", "options": ["Captain Clark Terrell (Paul Winfield)", "Spock", "Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick)\n\n\tTerrell kills himself rather than obey Khan's command to kill Admiral Kirk.  Khan dies when the Genesis device is detonated.  Spock, of course, sacrifices his life to save the ENTERPRISE.  David Marcus, Kirk's son, is still alive when the credits roll...but he will meet an untimely demise in \"Star Trek III\" at the hands (well, blade) of a Klingon warrior. \n"}, {"text": "Once the Genesis device has been activated, Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) asks Dr. David Marcus how long the ENTERPRISE has to get away before the device explodes.  How many minutes does David tell Kirk that they have?", "correct": "four", "options": ["three", "six", "five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfour.\n\n\tDavid: \"We set the timer for four minutes.\"  Kirk does say to Scotty (James Doohan), \"I need warp speed in three minutes, or we're all dead\"...but David definitely states four minutes as the interval to detonation.  Apparently, the ENTERPRISE could get far enough away with just one minute of warp speed. \n"}, {"text": "What is the last word we hear Khan speak in the film?", "correct": "thee", "options": ["revenge", "Kirk", "away"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthee.\n\n\tKhan's last words are stolen from Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\": \"From hell's heart, I stab at thee...with my last breath, I spit at thee.\"  Then, the RELIANT -- with him on it -- goes \"boom.\" \n"}, {"text": "How many times during the course of the film is Lt. Saavik (Kirstie Alley), a junior officer, given \"the conn\" (the captain's chair) of the ENTERPRISE?", "correct": "3 & three", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n3 & three.\n\n\tCaptain Spock gives Saavik the conn as the ENTERPRISE is leaving spacedock early in the film.  Later, when Kirk invites Spock and McCoy to view the Genesis Project tape in his quarters, he too gives Saavik the conn.  Finally, at the end of the film, when Kirk heeds McCoy's request to come to Engineering (to watch Spock die, sadly enough), he rather off-handedly states, \"Saavik, take the conn.\"  That's three times. \n"}, {"text": "True or False: Spock failed the KOBAYASHI MARU test (which we see Saavik failing at the opening of the film) three times.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAs Spock is dying, he says to Kirk, \"I never took the KOBAYASHI MARU test.  What do you think of my solution?\"  It's a throwaway line, but one is forced to wonder how a captain in Starfleet with a service record as impressive as Spock's was never required to take the all-important KOBAYASHI MARU test. \n"}, {"text": "What is the last word that Spock says to Kirk as he is dying in Engineering?", "correct": "prosper", "options": ["Jim", "friend", "one"], "explanation": "\n\n\nprosper.\n\n\tSpock's very last words to Kirk are, appropriately, \"Live long...and prosper.\"  He then drops dead. \n"}, {"text": "Spock's body is launched toward the Genesis planet in a photon torpedo.  What is inscribed on the side of the torpedo?", "correct": "Mark VI", "options": ["Mark V", "Mark VII", "Mark IV"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMark VI.\n\n\tWe see \"Mark VI,\" in red, emblazoned on the side of the black torpedo several times, both in this film and \"Star Trek III: The Search For Spock.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which character is seen crying during the course of this film?", "correct": "Lieutenant Saavik (Kirstie Alley)", "options": ["Commander Montgomery Scott (James Doohan)", "They all cry", "Captain James T Kirk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLieutenant Saavik (Kirstie Alley).\n\n\tSaavik sheds a prominent tear during Spock's memorial service.  Uhura is standing right next to Saavik...but oddly, she doesn't cry at all, even though she's known Spock a lot longer than Saavik has -- and Saavik is part Vulcan! \n"}, {"text": "What music is played during Spock's memorial service?", "correct": "\"Amazing Grace\"", "options": ["\"Taps\"", "an unnamed Vulcan dirge", "No music is played during the service"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Amazing Grace\".\n\n\tScotty plays \"Amazing Grace\" on the bagpipes. \n"}, {"text": "Finish Kirk's quote to his son, David Marcus: \"I've cheated death.  I've tricked my way out of death...and patted myself on the back for my ____________.\"", "correct": "ingenuity", "options": ["insight", "cleverness", "genius"], "explanation": "\n\n\ningenuity.\n\n\tKirk goes on to admit that he has never truly *faced* death before...\"not like this.\" \n"}, {"text": "Kirk, before David's arrival, had poured himself a drink.  What does Kirk wind up doing with said drink?", "correct": "He offers it to David.", "options": ["He pours it out into the sink.", "He toasts Spock with it.", "He throws it against the wall."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe offers it to David.\n\n\tAs Kirk is putting his uniform jacket back on, he says to David, almost absent-mindedly: \"I poured myself a drink.  Would you like it?\"  David never responds to that question, and the drink is never seen or mentioned again. \n"}, {"text": "\"You know...he's not really dead.  Not as long as we remember him.\"  Which character says this about Spock as the film is about to end?", "correct": "McCoy", "options": ["Kirk", "Scotty", "Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMcCoy.\n\n\tMcCoy delivers this line, despite the fact that he and Spock were, on the whole, less than friendly...on the surface, at least. \n"}, {"text": "What is the last word that we hear Kirk speak in this film?", "correct": "young", "options": ["again", "Spock", "ahead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nyoung.\n\n\tMcCoy: \"You okay, Jim?  How do you feel?\"  Kirk: \"Young.  I feel young.\"  Quite the contrast to Kirk's admission, earlier in the film, that he felt old. \n"}, {"text": "And finally, for the first time ever, it is Spock, and not Kirk, who recites the familiar \"opening credo\" of the original \"Star Trek\" series at the end of the film.  For the record, the original \"credo\" read as follows: \"Space...the final frontier.  These are the voyages of the starship ENTERPRISE.  Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds...to seek out new life and new civilizations...to boldly go where no man has gone before.\"  When Spock speaks the \"credo\" at the end of this film, though, he makes a particular change.  What is it?", "correct": "He says \"life forms\" instead of \"life\"", "options": ["He changes \"final\" to \"next\"", "He says \"where no one\" instead of \"where no man\"", "He fixes the split infinitive \"to boldly go\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe says \"life forms\" instead of \"life\".\n\n\tThe change from \"no man\" to \"no one\" didn't happen until \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" hit TV in 1987...and no one has ever bothered to fix that damned split infinitive.\r Hope you had a good time! \n"}]}
