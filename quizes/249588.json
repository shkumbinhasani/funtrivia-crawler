{"id": "249588", "name": "'Dune' (Part III) Trivia Game | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Dune"], "questions": [{"text": "As he sleeps, Paul Atreides keeps having recurring visions.  Which of these images is not one that he sees during these seemingly prophetic dreams?", "correct": "A large worm moving through the desert", "options": ["A woman who says, 'Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.'", "Water dripping into a dark pool", "A lone moon in the night sky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA large worm moving through the desert.\n\n\tAll of these images are prophetic, and do come to pass later in the film.  In addition, he also envisions the character Feyd-Rautha making the bold claim: 'I will kill you!' \n"}, {"text": "Before the House of Atriedes embarks on their trip to the planet Dune, Paul is confronted by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, who insists on testing the lad.  In Paul's quarters, she produces a box and tells Paul to insert his hand.  What does she say he will find in the box? ", "correct": "Pain", "options": ["Only what he puts in there", "A key", "The truth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPain.\n\n\tPaul is at first reluctant to participate in the Reverend Mother's little test, but she draws him closer using 'the voice'.  No longer able to resist her, he bravely submits to the test.  She is impressed by his ability to recognize her use of 'the voice', and, at first, to resist it. \n"}, {"text": "As potential punishment if Paul removes his hand from the box, the Reverend Mother holds a deadly poison needle at his throat, ready to thrust it in at her whim.  What is this lethal device called?", "correct": "Gom jabbar", "options": ["Ghola", "Lasgun", "Cymek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGom jabbar.\n\n\tThe word 'jabbar' is derived from the Arabic word 'jabr', which means 'coercion'.  It is not clear as to the specific derivation of the word 'gom', Herbert could possibly have meant several things by it. \n"}, {"text": "What is the very first sensation Paul feels after placing his hand in the box?", "correct": "Itching", "options": ["Burning", "Freezing", "Stabbing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItching.\n\n\tAt first, he feels that his hand itches, then the heat begins and his hand feels a burning sensation.  As the burning becomes more intense, the Reverend Mother describes his 'flesh crisping -- falling off'.  All the while as Paul suffers, he thinks to himself, 'Fear is the little death.'  Paul lasts longer than any previous person who has gone through this test. \n"}, {"text": "From planet Caladan we are swept off to the home of the Harkonnen, namely Giedi Prime.  There, we see a twisted Mentat, namely Piter de Vries, making his way in a small transport to the palace of Baron Harkonnen.  What strange but effective actor plays the role of Piter de Vries?", "correct": "Brad Dourif", "options": ["Christopher Lloyd", "Meatloaf", "Mickey Rourke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrad Dourif.\n\n\tBrad Dourif, who you may recognize from films such as 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and 'Mississippi Burning', is completely bizarre as Piter de Vries, almost purposefully over-emoting in his role.  His eccentricity works though, within the insane context of the Harkonnens, who are each bizarre in their own way. \n"}, {"text": "We are now introduced to the sadistic and rather disgusting Baron Harkonnen.  In addition, we meet two other important members of the House of Harkonnen, namely Feyd and Rabban.  How are these two twisted individuals related to the Baron?", "correct": "Nephews", "options": ["Sons", "Brothers", "Uncles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNephews.\n\n\tGlossu Rabban, nicknamed 'The Beast', is played by American actor Paul L. Smith.  His other film appearances include 'Midnight Express', 'The In-Laws' and 'Popeye' (he played Bluto!)  His 'Beast' nickname was 'rewarded' to him in the book series after he killed his own father. \n"}, {"text": "What Russian name is the first name of Baron Harkonnen?", "correct": "Vladimir", "options": ["Ivan", "Alexei", "Andrei"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVladimir.\n\n\tBaron Vladimir Harkonnen is played by actor Kenneth McMillan.  He is a vile pederast whose bloated body is beset by disease.  David Lynch apparently wanted to make sure that the viewers found the Baron repugnant, and he did an awfully good job! \n"}, {"text": "What popular rock star of the 1980s takes a turn acting as the reptilian Feyd, a man obsessed with killing Paul Atreides?", "correct": "Sting", "options": ["Bono", "Ozzy Osbourne", "David Lee Roth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSting.\n\n\tSting's madcap, over-the-top performance as Feyd was actually quite impressive, but unfortunately did not launch him into movie stardom.  His next film, 1985's 'The Bride', was a box office bomb, and his acting career sputtered following it.  Fortunately for Sting, he can also sing! \n"}, {"text": "The House of Atreides finally makes the journey to Dune, prepared to take power from the Harkonnens there.  Upon arriving on Dune, the Duke meets with Duncan Idaho.  Who does Duncan Idaho say is truly in control of the planet Dune?", "correct": "The Fremen", "options": ["The Harkonnens", "The Emperor", "No one"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fremen.\n\n\tThe Fremen seem to be people native to Dune, and, according to Duncan Idaho, they are truly in control of the planet.  He also reveals that the Fremen actually exist in numbers much more vast than has been suggested. \n"}, {"text": "An important character is introduced to the Duke and his family soon after their arrival on Dune, namely Dr. Kynes.  What accomplished actor plays this mysterious Dr. Kynes?", "correct": "Max von Sydow", "options": ["Dustin Hoffman", "Edmund O'Brien", "Gene Hackman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMax von Sydow.\n\n\tYou may have heard of the Swedish actor Max von Sydow; you know, the guy who starred in movies such as 'The Seventh Seal' and 'Wild Strawberries' by Ingmar Bergman, or American-made movies such as 'The Greatest Story Ever Told', 'The Exorcist' and 'Needful Things'.\r In 'Dune' he plays Dr. Kynes, the 'Judge of the Change' and 'Imperial Ecologist'.  It's great to see him in this film! \n"}]}
