For breaking the rules, Will was barred from coaching.  Emma, despite having her wedding on the same day at around the same time offers to take the kids for him.\rMeanwhile, Rachel lets on that she thinks that Puck, Quinn, and Finn are acting weird about Quinn's pregnancy.  When she lets the others know, it turns out that Mercedes, who discovered the truth behind puck fathering the child, let everyone but Rachel in on the secret to prevent Finn from knowing.

They decide that \"Proud Mary\" in wheelchairs is an automatic in (from the episode \"Wheels\") and \"Don't Stop Believin'\" is in as well, but they need a ballad.  Rachel immediately steps up to pose a suggestion, but Mercedes stops her and Emma asks to let her have a shot. Belting out Jennifer Hudson's rendition of \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" from \"Dreamgirls\", they decide to add it to their setlist as the ballad portion of the performance.

Quinn tells the truth to him and he leaves frustrated.  He tells them that he's done with all of them and he's done with Glee.  Rachel later apologizes to Quinn, but Quinn sees no need to forgive her.  Rachel did what Quinn wasn't brave enough to do.

Instead, Jacob, the school's reporter, fills Finn's role and he's told he doesn't need to do anything but sway in the back.  The kids leave and Will reminds Emma that he'll have his cell phone at all times.  When they get to the theatre, Emma tells the kids that they have drawn the third performance slot meaning that they'll be the last to perform of the groups performing.

It turns out, however, that it's not for the best. \n"}, {"text": "When Sectionals is in progress, where does Will find Finn?", "correct": "The locker room", "options": ["At home", "The choir room", "The audience"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe locker room.\n\n\tWatching the Jane Adams Academy girls perform, the kids in New Directions are shocked to discover that they have used \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" and \"Proud Mary\" (complete with wheelchairs) in their routine.  When Will is told by Emma, she says that the kids are freaking out; Artie's even ramming himself into walls with his wheelchair.  Will decides that he knows what to do just as Sue walks by.  He confronts her immediately as she was the only one to have or know the setlist, so she had to have leaked it.  She claims he has no real proof and he vows to get back at her by exposing her.\rWill finds Finn in the locker room with his football stuff, cleaning up as football season's over.  Will tells the truth- things are looking pretty bad.  He gives him the advice that he can't always get what he wants, but sometimes he needs to get through it.

She quickly tells them off claiming that if they believed in their kids a bit more, they probably would've done extremely well without having to cheat in the first place.  When the kids go back to the auditorium to watch the Haverbrook School for the Deaf perform, they use \"Don't Stop Believin'\".  Rachel announces that they need to meet in the green room in five minutes.\rThe kids are quick to point the finger at Brittany and Santana for leaking the setlist through Sue.  Quinn confirms the suspicions that they were sent by Sue to spy on the club.  Santana denies leaking the songs because Glee actually is important to her and it's something she does enjoy despite her attitude.  Brittany, however, says she gave Sue the setlist but didn't know what she planned to do with it.  They decide that this is unimportant though- they need to find songs to perform, and quickly. \n"}, {"text": "What song, not performed in the episode, do the kids decide to end their performance with?", "correct": "Somebody to Love", "options": ["Lean on Me", "True Colors", "Walkin' on Sunshine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomebody to Love.\n\n\tWhile Rachel suggests that Mercedes use another ballad to start their performance, Mercedes tosses the idea back to Rachel as she's their most seasoned singer and the best choice to belt out a ballad on the fly.  Rachel humbly accepts as she'd been planning a number since she was four years old.  Quinn also suggests that they end with \"Somebody to Love\" by Queen, a song that New Directions performed for Invitationals in \"The Rhodes Not Taken\".  With everyone at loss for a second song, Finn walks in and provides the group with their final number. He asks Matt, Mike, Santana, and Brittany to throw together a quick dance routine for it and they set themselves to work. Jacob leaves the team willingly and Rachel thanks Finn for coming back.  When Puck asks if they're cool, Finn says that they aren't. \n"}, {"text": "How is Will able to experience New Directions' performance?", "correct": "Through his cell phone", "options": ["Via live satellite broadcasting", "From the audience", "From backstage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThrough his cell phone.\n\n\tEmma decides to call Will from her cell before the kids come out so that he can hear them perform from the choir room.  As the lights dim, Rachel prepares herself for her big moment.  She pulls the curtains at the top of the aisle and begins her number: \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" from \"Funny Girl\".  Heading through the audience, she makes her way to the stage before ending her number. The others enter the theatre via the aisles and Rachel introduces New Directions as they begin their second song: \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" by The Rolling Stones, the number Finn was inspired to provide.

One of the judges, a ditzy blonde who was fifth-runner-up in the Miss Ohio competition three years prior, can't help but insult the School for the Deaf.  Another judge, Rod Remington (who had a brief fling with Sue and who hosts the local news), goes into a brief explanation as to why he liked the disadvantaged teams better.  The third and final judge, there against her wishes, is unsure as to why she's even there.  She claims she doesn't know what a 'Glee Club' is and she'd never heard the term 'show choir' until her boss told her she had to fill in for him at the event.  New Directions tries to eavesdrop from outside the door as Ms. Hitchens comes along to apologize and set things straight.  Before she can tell the truth to the judges, they make their way out of the room with the results.\rWill dresses up and gets ready to attend Emma's reception and he bumps into Terri in their apartment.  She says she's been seeing a therapist, but Will can't find it in himself to love her the way he used to.\rArriving at the community centre for the wedding, Will finds the place empty.  Emma sits at a table in her wedding dress and tells him that Ken stayed home.  They didn't get married because they bumped the wedding for Sectionals and he understood that she was doing it for Will in the first place.   She admits her love for him and says that she resigned from her position at the school; her last day is Monday.  She can't bring herself to look at Ken because she hurt him and she can't look at Will without being heartbroken.  Will says that he just left his wife, but she reiterates that he 'just did'. \n"}, {"text": "New Directions took what place at Sectionals?", "correct": "First", "options": ["Second", "Third", "Fourth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFirst.\n\n\tIn Figgins' office, Sue, Will, and Figgins discuss the issue that occurred.  It turns out that Ms. Hitchens and Mr. Rumba both came forward to Figgins explaining that Sue gave away the setlist on pages with Cheerios letter heads reading 'From the desk of Sue Sylvester' and in her handwriting.  She denies that she was involved, but he can't change his mind because of the evidence.  Figgins tells Sue that she is no longer coach of the Cheerios.  Starting today, she is suspended from the school.  In addition, Figgins called the Ohio show choir board and told them the truth of the matter and Will is now back as the coach of Glee Club.  As Will heads back to the choir room, Sue stops him and informs him that she's taking a break, tanning at her condo in Boca, and coming back to fight.\rIn the choir room, the kids reveal that they won.  With a first place trophy to show for it, Will expresses his pride and reveals that the judges were unanimous.  He also informs them that they have Regionals to worry about.  Before they get started with practice, the kids reveal that they set up a number especially for him,  They perform a song and dance to \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" by Kelly Clarkson including a number of the dance moves and styles from their previous months of musical numbers.  Emma packs her office in boxes and Will rushes in to meet her but finds she is already gone.  Heading down the hall, he spots her departing and stops her.  Before she can leave, they embrace and smile. \n"}]}
