{"id": "198437", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Yankee Doodle Doctor' Quiz / Test | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "This episode opens with the filming of the introductory scene in what will become a documentary based on the daily life in a MASH unit.  General Clayton, who was featured in several early episodes, is set to appear as the host of the film.  We discover Clayton's first name at this point, what is it?", "correct": "Crandall", "options": ["Lowell", "Raymond", "Victor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrandall.\n\n\tHerb Voland appeared as General Crandall Clayton in three episodes of the first season of 'M*A*S*H' ('Yankee Doodle Doctor', 'Tuttle' and 'Cease Fire').  This was his first appearance on the show.\r After filming the introduction to the documentary, Clayton talks to his current director about the various surgical hospitals in Korea, highlighting the 4077th, commanded by his 'dear friend' Henry Blake, as the best. \n"}, {"text": "A Lieutenant Bricker is originally scheduled to direct the documentary on MASH units in Korea.  Henry escorts Bricker to the Swamp to meet the doctors, and Bricker immediately questions them on their cinematic experience.  At this point, Hawkeye does an awful imitation of which Hollywood hero?", "correct": "James Cagney", "options": ["Clark Gable", "Humphrey Bogart", "W. C. Fields"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Cagney.\n\n\tHawkeye's over-the-top performance as James 'You dirty rat!' Cagney receives rave reviews from Trapper, who claims that he's 'never seen Carmen Miranda done any better.'  Hawkeye responds to this snide remark with an even worse Jack Benny imitation ('Now cut that out!') \n"}, {"text": "Frank Burns claims that he did some acting in both high school and college.  Which famed Shakespeare role did Frank take in an amateur production in college?", "correct": "Romeo", "options": ["Hamlet", "Othello", "Macbeth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRomeo.\n\n\tFrank Burns as Romeo, I'd pay to see that one.  Frank claims also to have done amateur dramatics in high school, and that, 'for a while there, it was a toss-up whether [he'd] be a doctor or an actor.'  This leads to the inevitable response from Hawkeye, 'What finally happened?' (Personally, I think they could have had better writing there.) \n"}, {"text": "Finally, Hawkeye is selected to be the 'star' of the documentary, and Bricker immediately sets out to pursue the Swamp-dweller as he performs his grueling work at the 4077th.  In one triage scene, Bricker and his cameraman swarm around Hawkeye as he tries to diagnose a soldier's injuries.  Bricker is not wholly satisfied with the shot, however, and insists on what from Hawkeye?", "correct": "That he consult with another doctor", "options": ["That he put heavier intonation into his voice", "That he smile more broadly", "That he show his better side"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat he consult with another doctor.\n\n\tBricker also intrudes on Hawkeye as he performs surgery on a young soldier.  Trapper, also at the table, demands that the cameraman back off, but to no avail.  Hawkeye suggests that Trapper lift up the soldier's appendix so that the camera can get a better view. \n"}, {"text": "In the Swamp the title of the documentary 'Yankee Doodle Doctor' is revealed.  Which character from the show is apparently responsible for this marvelous title?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Margaret", "Hawkeye", "Trapper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tFrank has constructed some narration for the film, and just for a few laughs Hawkeye and Trapper request that he read it to them.  In his speech, Frank refers to doctors as 'saints in surgical garb' and finishes it up thusly: 'Every red-blooded American knows that if he is wounded, he will be in the strong, capable hands of a Yankee Doodle Doctor.' \n"}, {"text": "Following the filming, Hawkeye and Trapper feel that they have been had.  Rather than make a true documentary, they imagine that the film will simply be used for propaganda purposes.  How do they solve this little dilemma?", "correct": "They expose all the film to light", "options": ["They take some film of Bricker with one of the nurses and blackmail him with it", "They switch the film with some of Henry's 'personal' films", "They mail the film to Africa, with no return address"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey expose all the film to light.\n\n\tWhat especially galls both Hawkeye and Trapper is that the doctors are going to be presented as 'volunteers'.  They decide to break into the bin in which the film is stored and expose each reel to the light.  In so doing, Hawkeye does his best impression of Porky Pig, saying, 'Th-th-th-that's all folks!' \n"}, {"text": "With Bricker having abandoned the project, the responsibility for producing the documentary falls into the hands of that auteur of auteurs, Hawkeye Pierce.  The final version of the film is shown to the entire outfit, with General Clayton in attendance, near the end of the episode.  The footage includes which of the following wearing no shirt or pants (but underwear, thank goodness)?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Trapper", "Hawkeye", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tRadar, who is so bashful in later episodes, apparently has no problem appearing in his underwear in this film.  Perhaps because it is for a good cause?  Trapper and Hawkeye also appear with their pants down, but with their dress uniform tops. \n"}, {"text": "During the film, Hawkeye appears dressed as Groucho Marx.  Which of the Marx brothers does Trapper portray?", "correct": "Harpo", "options": ["Chico", "Zeppo", "Gummo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarpo.\n\n\tAlan Alda apparently loves to do his Groucho impression, employing it in several episodes, including this one.  Trapper's job of imitating Harpo is rather simply, since Harpo always communicated using a horn.  Nurse Cutler plays the straight man in this Marx brothers send-up. \n"}, {"text": "Later in the documentary, the doctors retire to the mess tent for 'some simple, wholesome pleasure'.  This includes drinking from which of the following items?", "correct": "Boots", "options": ["Bazookas", "Bedpans", "Bathtub"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoots.\n\n\tHawkeye, holding a woman's pump, announces, 'Gentlemen, I give you the war!'  He then drinks from the high-heeled shoe, while the rest of the men in the tent drink from army boots.  They all react with disgust after having drunk their champagne. \n"}, {"text": "After seeing the documentary, in which of the following ways does General Clayton react?", "correct": "Amusement, he wants a copy for himself", "options": ["Irritation, he wants Hawkeye to be put on report", "Disappointment, he feels his part was not substantial enough", "Outrage, he demands to see Henry in his office immediately"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmusement, he wants a copy for himself.\n\n\tGeneral Clayton is an alright fellow.  He asks that the documentary not be released, and that the comedy bits be burned, but not before he gets a copy for himself, claiming that 'we need something to laugh at once this is all over.'  \r Speaking of 'all over', so is this quiz.  Thank you for playing, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
