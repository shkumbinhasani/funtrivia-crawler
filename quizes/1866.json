Nitrogen in the air is not usable by plants. What is the most common process by which nitrogen is made available to plants?", "correct": "Bacterial action", "options": ["Photosynthesis", "Breakdown of water", "Lightning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBacterial action.\n\n\tMany plants have nodules on their roots where nitrifying bacteria live. \n"}, {"text": "What is an organism that breaks down dead organisms called?", "correct": "Decomposer", "options": ["Producer", "First consumer", "Second consumer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDecomposer.\n\n\tWithout decomposers, the Earth would be covered in many feet of dead stuff- yuck! \n"}, {"text": "Ultimately, all of the energy in all life cycles on land originally came from the ...", "correct": "Sun", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSun.\n\n\tYep.
