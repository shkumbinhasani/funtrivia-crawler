Once there, they would be able to find their marked cars and drive themselves one hundred fifty kilometers into the Alps to the town of Altdorf where, in the morning, they would receive their next clue from a William Tell impersonator in front of a monument of Tell erected in 1895.

Here, one member of each team needed to take a straight razor and shave a balloon all over within a sixty second time limit.

When they properly performed the flamenco for an instructor, they could receive their next clue. Caroline and Jennifer completed this option.  In 'Running with the Ballz', teams instead headed to a nearby city street to dress up in large, protective bull costumes.  They then had to travel through a marked course while getting assaulted by others in bull outfits, searching for posters which would form the phrase 'A Matador Never Thinks About His Death'.

This time around, Leo and Jamal used their U-Turn powers to force Jet and Cord to complete the 'Spanish Steps' Detour task.  In addition to this, Caroline and Jennifer used the Double U-Turn (for the first time) to send Brendon and Rachel back for the same task.  Unfortunately for them, Brendon and Rachel had already checked in at the Double U-Turn and were, thus, unaffected by the decision. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated in Spain in Leg 10?", "correct": "Jet and Cord", "options": ["Caroline and Jennifer", "Leo and Jamal", "Brendon and Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJet and Cord.\n\n\tAfter the Double U-Turn was attended to, teams were told to proceed on foot to their next Pit Stop, the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a in Seville, Spain.  Here, Dave and Connor won their second consecutive leg of the race (and fourth overall in this season), taking with them a trip for two to St. Croix courtesy of Travelocity. After faltering to find clues earlier in the leg, missing key components during the Detour, and being forced to perform a U-Turn, Jet and Cord arrived in fifth and last place and were, thus, eliminated once again, leaving four teams and removing the third of three third-time racers from the game. \n"}]}
