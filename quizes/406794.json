{"id": "406794", "name": "\"Take Me to Your Leader\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Double Feature"], "questions": [{"text": "In which state is Maria Wycoff abducted by aliens?", "correct": "New Mexico", "options": ["California", "Iowa", "Nevada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Mexico.\n\n\tPutting on a record while setting the table for dinner, Maria Wycoff sees the lights start to flicker.  The year is 1954 and she and her family live in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  While her son, Timothy, plays outside, a pair of dust devils materialize in the desert next to the house.  She only realizes something is horribly amiss when her record player scratches to a stop and begins playing backwards; the hands on the clock on the wall spin in reverse.  By the time she looks back outside to search for her son, all that remains is a blinding light from the sky. \n"}, {"text": "Charles Wycoff is killed in his own home by which means?", "correct": "His head explodes", "options": ["His heart stops", "He's shot", "He's thrown through a wall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis head explodes.\n\n\tRacing inside, Maria rushes to the phone and dials the operator only to hear her son's voice telling her not to be afraid.  She has reason to be, however, as she's lifted from the floor and held to the ceiling by an unnatural force.  Something that appears to be her son enters the home and asks her to take his hand.\r Maria's husband, Charles, returns home from work to find the house in shambles.  Maria, or something like her, is in the living room levitating inches above the floor.  With a quick motion of her hand, Charles' head explodes. \n"}, {"text": "President Eisenhower is enjoying which of these activities when he is informed of the UFO crash?", "correct": "Golf", "options": ["Swing dancing", "Baseball", "A nap"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolf.\n\n\tIn Palm Springs, California, Dwight D. Eisenhower plays a round of golf with friends and colleagues.  He's interrupted by one of his men and forced to leave the green behind for a few minutes.  There's been an incursion; something has flown into and been shot down over U.S. airspace near Everage Air Force Base.  He packs his things shortly after and the First Lady, Mamie Eisenhower, sends him on his way.\r What follows is a drive into the desert where the military brings him to the crash site.  The vehicle is still there, but they've identified a body and brought it aside for investigation.  What they find is a saucer-like craft.  As for the body, it looks like a child; Eisenhower has it sent to the base. \n"}, {"text": "Where does President Eisenhower find Amelia Earhart?", "correct": "In the desert", "options": ["At her home", "On a raft at sea", "Working in a library"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the desert.\n\n\tEisenhower, coming upon the crash site, lights a cigarette.  It's clear that whatever landed in the desert isn't Russian or Chinese, and whatever it is, the real question is likely 'why?'.  It's then that a soldier alerts him to something over the horizon.  Hiding out in the shade of a desert tree they find an unclothed woman shivering.  Eisenhower gives up his jacket to cover her and asks for her name and it's most surprising when she claims to be Amelia Earhart, but she disappeared in 1937.\r Eisenhower speaks to Amelia alone when they bring her back to the base for medical help, and it's then that he hears her story. \n"}, {"text": "To where was Amelia flying when she went missing?", "correct": "Howland Island", "options": ["Baker Island", "South Sandwich Island", "Easter Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHowland Island.\n\n\tIn 1937, Amelia and her navigator, Fred Noonan, set out to locate Howland Island in the Atlantic Ocean but despite their heading being true, they never found it.  They couldn't understand it, especially when all of the instruments in their plane malfunctioned inexplicably.  They were going down until the moment that everything went white; it was like they were flying into the sun.  And that's all she remembers.  As for the markings on her body, she attributes them to needles.  Those who took her took her blood and put things inside her.  Eisenhower asks who did this to her, but she can't seem to answer and she can't comprehend that she has returned to the United States decades past when she left it.\r While Amelia is sedated, Eisenhower struggles to understand why she hasn't aged in twenty years.  Complicating matters further is the fact that her blood test results have returned; she's two months pregnant. \n"}, {"text": "When medical examiners cut open the body found at the crash site, do they find human organs within?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe remaining order of business during Eisenhower's visit to the Air Force Base is the matter of the body recovered from the crash site, and the tests performed on this are moments from proceeding.  As doctors begin to cut into this otherworldly being, they find it's completely inhuman and devoid of all internal organs.  As the lights begin to flicker, the men performing the autopsy are attacked by an amorphous, sentient blob that attaches to them and causes their heads to explode.\r Eisenhower, protected by his men only in numbers, moves to leave the building before his guards are killed by Maria Wycoff, who has found her way to the site.  The President has his men lower their weapons as she levitates forward and speaks.  He asks her to stop and for her to listen, but she responds that it is he who will listen to them. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these pairs of friends is dating?", "correct": "Cal and Troy", "options": ["Cal and Kendall", "Kendall and Jamie", "Jamie and Troy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCal and Troy.\n\n\tIn the present day, a group of college students meet up together at a Japanese restaurant after being apart for quite a while, though they've been friends since their youths.  With summer coming, they finally have the chance to reunite, and it begins with a sake and dinner.  Cal, Kendall, Troy, and Jamie are all living their lives and moving up in the world; Cal and Troy admit that they're finally dating; Kendall struggles with her mother's cancer diagnosis; Jamie met a guy but a recently discovered medical condition forced her to break it off.  Fortunately, they'll be able to share the summer.\r It takes an hour before they're all just staring at their phones. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these clubs does Kendall admit she joined at school?", "correct": "Luddite Club", "options": ["Low-Tech Club", "Amish Club", "Social Awareness Club"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuddite Club.\n\n\tKendall decries her friends for being so reliant on their phones.  It's part of this reliance on tech that she decided to join the Luddite Club at Harvard and took a class called '50 Years of Technology'.  She slept with her professor then, considering him attractive because of his lack of anxiety.  Her friends try to reason with her-- she wants to be a doctor and she's going to need technology for that.  This being said, she tries to remind them of a camping trip they took when they were 8-- no phones allowed.  It was the best time they'd ever had together.  They all agree it's a good idea.  They'll get a bedouin tent near Joshua Tree and have a Luddite summer.\r All four leave their phones at home and get comfortable out in the wilderness doing little more than spending time together. \n"}, {"text": "In the desert, Cal, Kendall, Troy, and Jamie come across which of these animals, mutilated?", "correct": "Cow", "options": ["Coyote", "Vulture", "Camel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCow.\n\n\tOne day during their trip, the foursome head out on a trek to a nearby pond with the intent to swim in the hot sun, but when they get to the spot it's expected to be, they discover that there's nothing but open desert.  As the wind blows across the rocks, all four get a whiff of an awful odour.  It's when they investigate around the hills that they find a field of dead and mutilated cattle; the cows have been bisected and there's no blood.  As Kendall places her hand on one of the bodies, its eyes open to stare at her and it moos.\r The four pack their things quickly, hop into their vehicle, and rush out of the desert as night begins to fall.  They're still an hour away from the nearest town when the car dies in the middle of the road.  That's when they're met by a blinding light.  Something emerges from it to meet them and its tentacles secure them in place before they black out. \n"}, {"text": "Considering Cal, Kendall, Troy, and Jamie, how many find themselves testing positive for pregnancy upon returning from the desert?", "correct": "All four", "options": ["One", "Three", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll four.\n\n\tCal, Troy, and Kendall reawaken in different seats in their car to find that they can't remember what happened save for a bright light, and it takes a few moments before they realize Jamie is missing.  As they drive down the road they nearly hit her.  Instead, they carry her back into the vehicle and rush home.\r Kendall calls her professor, Adam, and tries to sort out what happened.  Adam thinks that one of the boys may have slipped the group roofies but Kendall doesn't think this is the case.  She has to drop the phone when she's hit with a wave of nausea.  Jamie, similarly, has been throwing up all afternoon; she's reminded of morning sickness she had when she got pregnant at 19.  They don't know it quite yet, but both Cal and Troy have been feeling the same nausea.\r Kendall and Jamie try home pregnancy tests-- they're both pregnant.  When they boys show up at her place, Kendall asks them to humour her...and sure enough they're pregnant as well. \n"}]}
