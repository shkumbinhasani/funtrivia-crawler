After the Micro Machines, the dropped paint cans, and the tripwire, they discovered none other than a rabid raccoon!  The boy, of course, got away through the attic window.\n\nHmmm...something's not right -- that never happened in the final cut of the movie.  What 1990 movie could this have happened in?", "correct": "Home Alone", "options": ["Hook", "Uncle Buck", "Panic Room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHome Alone.\n\n\tIn this particular scene, Marv (played by Daniel Stern) actually would've nabbed Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin) by the ankle as he was fleeing to the attic to escape.  Instead of opening the door to find a raccoon, he found his brother's tarantula and placed it on top of Marv's head, allowing for his escape.  This was one of many different 'traps' set up by Kevin in an attempt to protect himself and his house from burglary, while accidentally left home alone on Christmas Eve.\r \"Home Alone\" was an exceedingly popular family film directed by Chris Columbus and produced by John Hughes.  It made over $475,000,000 in the box office and was followed by a similarly-popular sequel, \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\", which featured much of the same cast. \n"}, {"text": "The Griswolds have already destroyed the turkey, burnt the tree and chased a squirrel around the house. To top it off, Clark didn't get his bonus.  Imagine his surprise when he looks outside to see Cousin Eddie with his boss and when he opens the door he's greeted by a Grizzly Bear!\n\nOkay -- maybe that never happened.  What 1989 movie featured all of these events except the rabid animal?", "correct": "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation", "options": ["The Santa Clause", "Vegas Vacation", "Scrooged"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.\n\n\tTowards the end of this 1989 Christmas classic starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo, Cousin Eddie (played by Randy Quaid) kidnapped Clark's boss as a Christmas present, in order to get back at him for a poor Christmas bonus decision (signing Clark up for the jelly-of-the-month club).  Everyone learned a valuable lesson (I guess) and the wacky Christmas antics involving an uncle on fire, a senile great aunt, a house full of Griswolds, and a dog named Snot ended with \"God Bless America\", of course.\r There was no bear in this film but there was a fairly rambunctious squirrel which jumped on Julia Louis-Dreyfus's character, Margo the fed-up neighbour.\r \"Christmas Vacation\" was the third in a series of \"National Lampoon\" outings with the Griswold family and perhaps one of the most popular and lasting.  Director Jeremiah Chechik would later film \"Benny & Joon\" starring Johnny Depp.  There were no bears in that one either. \n"}, {"text": "Beatrix Kiddo was taught well by her master, Pai Mei, and when the time came for her to exact her revenge, she hit the precise pressure points of the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique.  Little did she know, the man who betrayed her, shot her, and left her for dead, the father of her child, was actually an angry African lion.  One pounce was all it took.\n\nWhich 2004 film about a bride's vengeance starred Uma Thurman but not a single lion (at least not in the final cut)?", "correct": "Kill Bill Vol. 2", "options": ["Hysterical Blindness", "Paycheck", "Pulp Fiction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKill Bill Vol. 2\n\n\tThe second of a two part film by director Quentin Tarantino, \"Kill Bill\" starred a massive ensemble cast and followed the story of Beatrix Kiddo, 'The Bride', who was killed by her ex-employer and ex-lover (and his assassination squad) while she held her wedding rehearsal in a mid-western chapel.  The two installments of the film followed her plan for revenge, starting with Bill's underlings (and her ex-colleagues) and winding up with the final battle against Bill himself.\r There may have been an angry, venomous snake in there at one point (a black mamba to be exact) but there were no lions.\r The first volume of the two may have been more popular in the box office (and with cult followings) but the second was similarly stylized.  'The Whole Bloody Affair' has been frequently seen amongst Tarantino's most famous works. \n"}, {"text": "A fire crew heads to an apartment building for an emergency in the middle of the night only to discover that something else is amiss and people are getting sick.  Before long, the place is locked down by the CDC and the residents need to fend for themselves.  They soon discover that the cause for alarm is rabid squirrels!\n\nWell...in 2008 this found-footage horror remake actually featured infected individuals and not squirrels.  What was its name though?", "correct": "Quarantine", "options": ["Survival of the Dead", "Hostel", "28 Weeks Later"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuarantine.\n\n\t\"Quarantine\", based on the original Spanish film \"[REC]\", was released in 2008 and starred Jennifer Carpenter (of \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\") and Jay Hernandez (of \"Hostel\").  Director John Erick Dowdle would go on to direct M. Night Shyamalan's \"Devil\" in 2010. \"Quarantine\" earned over $40,000,000 in the box office.\r Rabid squirrels though?  Not in this movie.  Not even in most other movies.  Weird, eh?\r While this brief synopsis didn't really focus on a scene, \"Quarantine\" was a seemingly-realistic account filmed on a news station camera.  Carpenter's character, Angela Vidal, was sent along with the firefighters for a news piece and got caught up in the horrifying ordeal at the apartment building.  It started with one sick girl but the infection took hold and began transforming tenants into psychopaths.  A sequel, \"Quarantine 2\", went straight-to-DVD in 2011. \n"}, {"text": "In a climactic scene of this 2009 horror film, Katie is awakened and dragged out of her bed by a rabid wolf which pulls her out of the bedroom and down the hall before her boyfriend, Micah, is able to wrestle her from its grip.\n\nWhat movie instead opted to omit the wolf from the film entirely, instead deciding to pull Katie out of bed with an invisible force?", "correct": "Paranormal Activity", "options": ["Boogeyman", "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", "Drag Me to Hell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParanormal Activity.\n\n\tIn one of the more tense moments of this cinema-verite-style film, the paranormal hauntings in a Katie and Micah's home escalated to such an extreme that a demonic force pulled her out of bed and into the closet down the hall (presumably to the attic).  While Katie was spared in this instance, it was clear, especially from a bite to her side, that whatever force was in the house was growing stronger by the day and was coming to claim her for whatever purposes it needed.\r Of course, you can just green-screen things out these days.  The wolf didn't do too well with test audiences (especially without any foreshadowing or reasoning behind the attack) so instead of rabid canines, the final cut included invisible demons.\r It was a wise decision.  Due to the tension, clever camera tricks, and interesting approach to a modern-day ghost story, \"Paranormal Activity\" surpassed box office expectations by word of mouth (and internet) alone to become the most profitable independent horror film ever made.  It earned nearly $200,000,000 in the box office and was followed by similarly-popular sequels. \n"}, {"text": "\"I'll never let go, Jack.  I promise.\"  Rose's words come out hoarse as hypothermia begins to set in.  She grasps Jack's hands with what little strength she has as the voices around her in the water begin to hush.\nAll of a sudden, an angry whale breaches the surface of the water, rising above the two lovers and crashing down on them both.\n\nWhat 1997 movie could have ended like this?", "correct": "Titanic", "options": ["Jaws", "The Perfect Storm", "Deep Impact"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTitanic.\n\n\tLikely left on the cutting room floor, this scene from the movie was eschewed in favour of a more poignant, suspenseful ending in which Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack died of hypothermia and Kate Winslet's Rose survived the sinking of the Titanic by using a whistle to signal a passing lifeboat.\r As you could see, they left out the giant whale.\r It was probably for the best anyways.  \"Titanic\" became the highest-grossing movie ever made and it won a dozen Academy Awards (including 'Best Picture').  Both Winslet and DiCaprio became A-list stars while director James Cameron one-upped his box office earnings with 2009's \"Avatar\". \n"}, {"text": "Tackling a hard-hitting journalism story about McCarthyism, Edward R. Murrow concludes his moments on-camera with his signature catchphrase before the end of his show, \"See It Now\".  Shortly after the cameras turn off, Murrow is tackled to the ground by a rabid Saint Bernard and the movie ends.\n\nIn what 2005 George Clooney-directed film did this not actually occur?", "correct": "Good Night, and Good Luck", "options": ["Guilty by Suspicion", "Anchorman", "The Manchurian Candidate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGood Night, and Good Luck.\n\n\tThis film followed the goings-on of CBS in the 1950s, an era faced with Senator McCarthy and the Hollywood Blacklist.  Edward Murrow (played by David Strathairn) and his colleague Fred Friendly (George Clooney) faced off against changing tides in the television journalism industry, inter-office politics, and Cold War propaganda in this Oscar-nominated film.\r Suffice to say, rabid animals were not in this one either by the time they sent it to theaters.  That rabid Saint Bernard would have to wait another day.\r \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" did not win any of the six Academy Awards it was nominated for, but Clooney's second directed film didn't go unnoticed by critics. \n"}, {"text": "Standing, waiting in Central Park for her mystery man to turn the bend with his dog, Kathleen Kelly is eager to see the man she fell in love with and she anticipates none other than Joe Fox.  Instead, she's attacked by a rabid fox which bounds around the corner and beelines for her thigh.\n\nNot true-- instead, Meg Ryan encountered Tom Hanks' character (and not a real fox) in what 1998 Nora Ephron rom-com?", "correct": "You've Got Mail", "options": ["Joe Versus the Volcano", "Sleepless in Seattle", "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou've Got Mail.\n\n\tIn the third pairing of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks (after \"Joe Versus the Volcano\" and \"Sleepless in Seattle\"), both characters initially rivaled one another.  Joe Fox's Fox Bookstores threatened Kathleen Kelly's Shop Around the Corner and forced her mother's timeless children's bookstore out of business.  What the two of them found was not rabid foxes however, but love.  As it turned out, both of them had been falling in love on the internet, conversing via AOL chats.\r The film was immensely successful, rabid animals or not, and it earned over $250,000,000 overall.  It also starred Greg Kinnear and Parker Posey. \n"}, {"text": "John Anderton, having successfully replaced his eyes to avoid capture, returns to the Pre-Crime headquarters in order to kidnap one of the precognitive psychics responsible for revealing his crime.  When he pulls the precog out of the water it turns out that she is not a human at all, but instead an angry crocodile!\n\nThere's no doubt in my mind that this was a deleted scene from what 2002 Steven Spielberg sci-fi film?", "correct": "Minority Report", "options": ["Jurassic Park", "AI: Artificial Intelligence", "The Adjustment Bureau"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinority Report.\n\n\tIn this movie, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) ran the pre-crime division of the FBI in the year 2054 and while the division was run successfully for a certain time, Anderton found himself pre-witnessed as one of the murderers seen by the pre-cogs, a trio of siblings with the power to see into the future.  This film dealt with fate, tragedy, and technology and became an important exemplar in the neo-noir subgenre.\r But crocodiles?  That never really happened.  They must've left those scenes on the cutting room floor.\r Directed by Steven Spielberg, \"Minority Report\" was a hit in the box office earning over $350,000,000 overall and received wide critical praise.  The scene in the question involved Anderton's retrieval of a pre-cog from the FBI headquarters so that he could stop what he was predestined to do. \n"}, {"text": "Johnny Castle rises from his seat during the final show of the year and heads across the room to state that \"nobody puts rabies in the corner\".

Sure enough, there is a mauling.\n\nWhat 1987 film was released with a more sensible, romantic version of this scene which, clearly, didn't make the final cut?", "correct": "Dirty Dancing", "options": ["Footloose", "Flashdance", "The Breakfast Club"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDirty Dancing.\n\n\tThe winner of a Golden Globe, a Grammy, and an Oscar, \"Dirty Dancing\" was a romantic classic released in 1987 and it was followed up by a prequel, \"Havana Nights\", in 2004.  The original film made over $200,000,000 in the box office and catapulted the careers of Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze.\r This particular scene (sans the rabid dog) was found towards the very end of the film, right before the final dance featuring Johnny and Baby.  The line \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\" was part of 'AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes' as well. \n"}]}
