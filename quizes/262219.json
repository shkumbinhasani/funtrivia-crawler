{"id": "262219", "name": "\"Firefly\": \"Jaynestown\" Online Quiz | Firefly | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Firefly"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Jaynestown\" begins with some standard cute flirtation between Simon and Kaylee, but it isn't long before our title character makes an appearance, enraging Simon as only he can do. \"You're like a trained ape - without the training!\" the good doctor exclaims. What is Jayne doing to provoke such an outburst?", "correct": "Having ransacked the infirmary in search of medical tape, he is now attaching a gun to his stomach.", "options": ["Having hated what was served for lunch, he is going through the kitchen and systematically destroying the Brussels sprouts.", "Having cut himself while working out, he is tearing apart the infirmary in search of painkillers.", "He is stretched out on Simon's bed, cutting open his mattress in search of hidden treasure."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHaving ransacked the infirmary in search of medical tape, he is now attaching a gun to his stomach.\n\n\tJayne has a moment of smug satisfaction at Simon's loss of temper (\"So you had to tear my infirmary apart?\" \"Apparently.\"), but it lasts only until Mal arrives to point out that he'd specifically ordered that no guns be brought to the surface. (Canton, it appears, is a gun-free zone.) Jayne protests -- \"I was in Canton a few years back, and I might have made me a coupla enemies thereabouts\" -- but Mal is unmoved. We get a shot of Jayne's face as he begins to strip the tape from his abdomen, and Simon could not have wished for a better revenge. \n"}, {"text": "The crew's mission is to the town of Canton on Higgins' Moon. Canton, an unsightly and smelly town inhabited by indentured laborers called \"mudders,\" is an exporter of a mundane but useful product. What is it?", "correct": "Mud (or clay) for ceramics", "options": ["Iron ore for steelmaking", "Sod for laying deluxe football fields on the central planets", "The super-strong silk of a local spider called a \"muddal\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nMud (or clay) for ceramics.\n\n\tThe first thing our intrepid crew notices is the smell -- \"I vote we do this job really really fast,\" Wash proposes, speaking for his crewmates. But the smell is only a signature of Canton's mud-based economy. Kaylee, as usual, knows a great deal about it; she quiets Simon's disbelief by observing that even \"Serenity's got more than a few ceramic parts in her.\" A little later, when Simon is posing as an interested buyer, the site foreman goes into more detail about the mud's amazing properties: \"... You add the right catalysts, kiln it proper, this stuff is stronger'n steel ten times over, at half the weight.\" No wonder it's so popular! And it's cheap, too: \"We got over two thousand workers, mostly indentured, pay 'em next to nothin', so we can pass the savings directly on to you, the customer ...\" The indentured workers nearby do not look thrilled by this arrangement. \n"}, {"text": "The touchdown near Canton gives rise to numerous complaints from the crew, mainly touching on the place's terrible smell. Mal is unmoved; they have work that needs to be done. What is the mission?", "correct": "To collect contraband from a middleman named Kessler and deliver it off-world", "options": ["To steal a valuable artifact from the home of Canton's Magistrate", "To rescue a man named Kessler, son of a wealthy smuggler", "To capture a muddal spider and bring it to interested competitors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo collect contraband from a middleman named Kessler and deliver it off-world.\n\n\t\"Kessler's our man,\" Mal explains soon after landing, \"he's holding the goods we're to deliver. We go in, we make contact. Easy peasy.\" But when has anything been easy peasy for this crew? Soon enough, they learn from a local smuggler that Kessler is no more, having been executed by the foreman and his gang on suspicion of handling contraband. The goods are still safe in their hiding place, but it won't be easy to get them off-world. \n"}, {"text": "Simon poses badly as a magnate interested in Canton's products, but miraculously enough their cover is not blown. Then they walk through the town's main square - and come upon an \"eerie ... piece of work.\" The people here clearly remember Jayne from his previous visit. What is in the town square?", "correct": "A heroic statue of Jayne Cobb, nearly life-size", "options": ["A heroic painting of Jayne Cobb, his foot on an oppressor's head", "A large \"Wanted\" sign offering a sizeable reward for the head of Jayne Cobb", "A life-sized dartboard in the shape of Jayne Cobb, with the local police practicing their marksmanship"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA heroic statue of Jayne Cobb, nearly life-size.\n\n\tAfter a moment of shocked silence that spans the opening credits, Mal is the first to speak. \"You want to tell me,\" he asks, in slow and measured speech, \"how come there's a statue of you, here, starin' at me like I owe him somethin'?\" Jayne demurs, Mal insists, and finally it emerges that Jayne has no idea why anyone would build a statue to commemorate a failed robbery years ago.His crewmates, however, will not allow the opportunity for teasing to pass. \"This must be what going mad feels like,\" Simon posits. Wash believes that \"They've really captured him, though, you know? Captured his essence.\" Kaylee adds, \"He looks sort of angry, don't he?\" Says Wash, \"Kinda what I meant.\" \n"}, {"text": "On to Inara's subplot! She lands her shuttle on the grounds of an opulent mansion that seems a world away from the squalor of Canton. For whom has she been hired?", "correct": "Fess Higgins, son of the Magistrate", "options": ["Rance Burgess, local strongman", "Magistrate Higgins, local potentate", "Atherton Wing, man-about-town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFess Higgins, son of the Magistrate.\n\n\tMagistrate Higgins -- owner of the moon, and victim of the robbery Jayne had tried and failed to pull off -- meets Inara himself in front of his mansion. Having a very narrow definition of what makes a man a man, he has hired Inara to make one out of his twenty-six-year-old son, Fess. The father is not optimistic: \"I have a feeling it will take all your arts to deal with this particular problem.\" Naturally, once the Magistrate has been removed from the situation, Inara easily develops a rapport with Fess. \n"}, {"text": "A few lucky crew members are staying behind on the ship: Zoe's \"holding down the fort\" while Book watches River. \"Should be able to keep my eye on a flock of one,\" he says confidently at the beginning of the episode - but his confidence is clearly misplaced. What does he happen upon River doing?", "correct": "Armed with a pencil, she is \"fixing\" his Bible.", "options": ["Armed with a wrench, she is \"fixing\" Serenity's engine.", "She is tearing the labels from the supply of canned food.", "She is using copious amounts of hair gel to mimic Book's hairstyle."], "explanation": "\n\n\nArmed with a pencil, she is \"fixing\" his Bible.\n\n\t\"Bible's broken,\" River explains brightly. \"Contradictions, faulty logistics--it doesn't make sense ... So we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden -- eleven inherent metaphoric parallels already there ... Noah's ark is a problem ...\" She's having a great time, but Book is not best pleased.After she tears out a page, he launches into a sermon about how faith \"is not about making sense,\" but she is having none of it. The two of them tug at the torn pages; finally, Book lets her have them. (Later, in a sweet beginning to a funny scene, River comes to return them: \"I tore these out of your symbol, and they turned into paper -- but I want to put them back, so --\") \n"}, {"text": "Still disturbed by the sight in the town square and looking for their contact, the away team settles in for terrible drinks at a dirty local bar when something even more astonishing happens. What aspect of local culture so unsettles our heroes?", "correct": "A busker with a guitar begins singing that famous ditty, \"The Hero of Canton, the Man They Call Jayne.\"", "options": ["The bartender accuses a patron of \"pulling a Jayne\" and throws him out of the bar.", "The trivia for the bar contest revolves exclusively around Jayne.", "Local youths begin dancing the time-honored moves of the \"Jayne Hop.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nA busker with a guitar begins singing that famous ditty, \"The Hero of Canton, the Man They Call Jayne.\"\n\n\tThe first verse of the song (which prompts Simon to correct his earlier statement: \"No, THIS must be what going mad feels like\") is worth repeating here: \"He robbed from the rich, and gave to the poor, stood up to The Man, and gave him what for / Our love for him now ain't hard to explain, the hero of Canton, the man they call Jayne!\"\r As the story told in the song continues (with the bar patrons singing along more and more excitedly to the chorus), Jayne realizes what's going on. He'd stolen vast amounts of cash from Magistrate Higgins, plus a hover-plane to transport it in -- but he didn't make a clean getaway, and was hit by anti-aircraft fire. In a desperate (and ultimately successful) attempt to stay in the air, he ditched everything he could to try to save weight -- the seats, the fuel reserve, the life support, and finally the money. That money must have landed in the middle of town -- and the mudders managed to keep it. \n"}, {"text": "Soon enough, word gets back to Magistrate Higgins (owner of this little moon) that Jayne Cobb has returned - and he has a plan to get rid of him without angering the people who look up to Jayne as a hero. Who does the Magistrate unleash on Jayne?", "correct": "Stitch Hessian, the partner whom Jayne betrayed", "options": ["Hitch Prussian, the assassin with a contract on Jayne", "Rich Tension, the victim of Jayne's previous heist", "Mitch Question, a ninja with no particular grievance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStitch Hessian, the partner whom Jayne betrayed.\n\n\tWell, it turns out that the account of the robbery that Jayne gave his crewmates (see Question 7) wasn't entirely accurate. You see, he had a partner in this robbery: Stitch Hessian. And before he tossed the money overboard, he tried to make up the weight by tossing Stitch. Poor Stitch, one-eyed and injured from his thirty-foot fall, has been living in a box in the Magistrate's prison ever since then. \r The Magistrate, assisted by the foreman, goes out and frees Stitch the very night that Jayne Cobb is spotted in town. He returns Stitch's clothes, belongings, and even his gun -- and tells him, pointedly, that his old partner is around. Stitch's intentions are clear. \n"}, {"text": "Looking for Jayne, the Magistrate's henchman comes across a crew member who has been left alone in the bar. Who does he take hostage?", "correct": "Simon", "options": ["Kaylee", "Inara", "Mal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSimon.\n\n\tSimon, Kaylee, and Jayne have stayed in the bar all night. After Mal and Wash returned to the ship to plan their next move with Zoe and Book, Jayne spent the evening with his adoring public, learning the words to his own theme song; Kaylee and Simon spent the evening a bit tipsy, flirting sweetly. But when Mal returns in the morning, Simon puts his foot in his mouth while trying to defend Kaylee's honor, and the hurt engineer orders him to stay in the bar and have breakfast while Jayne addresses the town and the others use the diversion to collect the contraband.Simon is thus alone when Stitch (surprisingly strong for having spent years in a box!) arrives, looking for a lever to use on Jayne.Stitch beats the doctor up and drags him to the town square, facing off with Jayne Cobb. \n"}, {"text": "At last the tension builds to a dramatic showdown. Jayne and the Magistrate's henchman face off across the town square, a crowd of mudders listening to their every word. After some chit-chat, the henchman gets down to business and fires his mean-looking shotgun at Jayne. What happens next?", "correct": "A hero-worshipping mudder leaps in front of Jayne and takes the bullets.", "options": ["Jayne ducks behind a statue, which takes the force of the blast.", "Nothing; the henchman's gun is loaded with blanks.", "A hero-worshipping mudder knocks the henchman's arm; the blast is wildly mis-aimed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA hero-worshipping mudder leaps in front of Jayne and takes the bullets.\n\n\tJayne's and Stitch's conversation makes clear to everyone that Jayne is not a hero -- but a young mudder man, who had befriended Jayne the previous night, takes a bullet for him anyway and dies. Stitch's surprise at this event is all the opening Jayne needs to take him down, after which he stares in horror at the corpse of his friend. He cannot stand to be thought of as a hero after this; he topples his own statue in the town square. \"All of you!\" he yells to the crowd. \"You think someone's just gonna drop money on you, money they could use? There ain't people like that! There's just people like me.\"\r The crew returns to the ship and lift off (with some help from Fess, who releases the ship from Port Control and explains to his angry father that he must be a man after all). Mal finds Jayne brooding in the cargo bay, trying to make sense of it all; he figures \"they're probably stickin' that statue right back up,\" despite everything that's happened. He's haunted by shame and guilt. Says Mal, quietly, \"Ain't about you, Jayne. It's about what they need.\"\r Jayne pauses, absorbing this information. \"Don't make no sense,\" he says at last. \n"}]}
