As Mrs. Darling begins to realize her children maturing, she listens as they talk about imaginative things.  The most prominent of these unreal thoughts tends to be of a boy named Peter Pan, a boy she remembers from her own childhood whose presence evokes memories in her mind.  One night as Mrs. Darling puts her children to bed, she witnesses Peter entering their house through the window and smiling at her.  In fright, she screams and Peter falls backwards out the window.  As she goes to check to see if the boy is okay, she realizes that Nana, the family dog (and nurse of the children) has snatched the boy's shadow in her mouth.  Rather than leave it out for the boy, she places it in a drawer, forgetting it until the following week.\rThe next week, Mr. and Mrs. Darling prepare for a party and set the children up to go to bed.  In order to persuade the youngest child, Michael, to take his medicine, Mr. Darling pretends to take his own, instead pouring it into Nana's water dish.  The dog dislikes the drink and the kids console their nurse.  Rather than leave the dog be, Mr. Darling takes her outside (regretting this later) and ties her up in the yard.  Wendy tells her mother that Nana is not barking in sadness, but in danger.  Despite this, Mrs. Darling and her husband carry on to the party, leaving the children in bed with the lamplight to keep them company.  Little do they know though, that Peter Pan sits on the roof of their house. \n"}, {"text": "Upon entering the Darling household to retrieve what he had lost, whom does Peter end up waking first?", "correct": "Wendy", "options": ["John", "Nana", "Michael"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWendy.\n\n\tPeter brings Tinker Bell, his fairy companion, in through the Darling nursery window to find his shadow and they locate the lost shadow within a large dresser in the room.  Peter, excited, accidentally slams the door shut on Tinker Bell and traps her inside as he attempts to adhere his shadow to his boots with soap.  The events wake up Wendy and she offers to help him by sewing the shadow back onto his feet.  The two talk, at which point she offers him a kiss.  He notes that he will know what one is when she gives it to him, but instead of kissing him, she gives him a thimble.  He gives her an acorn button which she later places around her neck.  It is at this moment that Peter realizes that Tinker Bell is missing.  Releasing her from the chest of drawers, she ends up flying around the room insulting Wendy for being a \"great, ugly girl\".\rPersuaded by Peter's mentions of Neverland and his evident necessity to have Wendy join himself and the Lost Boys to give them a 'mother', Wendy asks to fly with him to the second star to the left and straight on until morning.  She also wakes up her two brothers to bring them on the voyage and they narrowly avoid being caught by Nana and the servant, Liza.  Peter shows them how to fly by thinking happy thoughts and the four of them (and Tinker Bell) are off into the the night sky before Nana returns with the Darling parents to find the nursery empty. \n"}, {"text": "What, according to Peter, allows you to fly?", "correct": "Fairy dust", "options": ["Updrafts", "Nothing will allow a normal child to fly; they must hold his hand", "Love"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFairy dust.\n\n\tAs the four depart from London now able to fly thanks to their fairy dust (from Tinker Bell), the children reach the sea and fly onwards for what seems to be days.  Peter plays tricks with them as they get tired and lose track of time, often going off to speak to the stars or swim with the mermaids, but he eventually comes back to the children every time.\rAfter their journey, the four arrive at the island and the children realize it's the Neverland from their imaginations; everything they'd believed as make-believe had come true.  As the sun begins to set, they realize that the island is quite foreboding, and they begin a descent.  Peter warns the Darling children that pirates abound and are watching the island, now being led by Captain Hook.  John and Michael are soon afraid, knowing that Captain Hook is one of the meanest pirates of them all.  Peter assures them that he's killed tons of pirates all around the island.  It's at that point that the pirates shoot off their cannon, Long Tom, at the children, splitting them up.  Peter flies out to sea while John and Michael stay hidden in the forest.  Wendy, meanwhile, is shot over the canopy of the forest with Tinker Bell.  Unsure of what to do, she follows Tink, not knowing how much she is disliked by the fairy. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Captain Hook seem to be afraid of?", "correct": "Crocodiles", "options": ["Lions", "Bears", "Tigers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrocodiles.\n\n\tAs Peter returns to the island, it comes to life.  The Lost Boys search for Peter while the pirates and their captain, James Hook, search for the boys.  In turn, the pirates are being hunted by the Piccaninny tribe, and they are being hunted by the beasts of the island.  Finally, one giant crocodile follows them all.  Captain Hook notes that the crocodile swallowed a ticking alarm clock, and that this will always alert him as to its proximity, so he's safe.\rWhen Hook and the pirates stop for a rest, the Captain sits on a toadstool and discovers that it rests on top of a chimney.  It is then that they realize that they are situated on top of the Lost Boys' house.  They plan to leave a trap for them later on.\rWendy begins her descent over the forest and Tinker Bell alerts the Lost Boys that she is coming, but that they should shoot her down since she's a 'bird'.  The boys comply thinking that it was Peter's idea and one pierces Wendy with an arrow.  When Pan arrives to see this, they realize that the arrow was stopped by the acorn button he gave her (as a 'kiss') earlier in London.  They decide to build a house around her.\rWhen Wendy awakens, she finds the Lost Boys, John, Michael, and Peter waiting for her outside the makeshift house and she agrees to be their mother. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the daughter of the Redskin chief?", "correct": "Tiger Lily", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTiger Lily.\n\n\tAs days and nights go by, the boys (and even Wendy) begin forgetting their parents.  However, the Darlings, Peter, and the Lost Boys begin having their adventures.  With Wendy being a mother, they still have their fun and camaraderie, but now there's a system to the things that they do.\rOn one particular instance, the group decides to spend the day at the Mermaid Lagoon.  The group had decided to rest after their midday meal on Marooner's Rock when Wendy and Peter realiz that the pirates had been planning to use the rock.  As they all jump into the lagoon, they notice that two pirates have captured Tiger Lily, the Redskin Chief's daughter, and placed her onto the rock to drown.  Peter tricks them though, masking his voice as Captain Hook's and telling them that they must let her go.  When the real Captain Hook arrives, he realizes what has happened and a battle ensues.  The boys defeat the pirates this time, but Peter is wounded and Wendy is too exhausted to move from Marooner's Rock.  Peter uses Michael's kite to fly her back to the island and stands tall on the rock to meet his fate as the water begins to rise. \n"}, {"text": "How does Peter escape Marooner's Rock after battling the pirates?", "correct": "By using a bird's nest", "options": ["By swimming", "By flying", "By stealing a boat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy using a bird's nest.\n\n\tWhile Peter Pan faces death by drowning on Marooner's Rock in the middle of the Mermaid Lagoon, he is spotted by a Never bird which gives him a nest to swim back in.  The large bird then uses Peter's hat for its eggs and floats off.  Peter returns to the cave to tell the others of his story and they all stay up late.\rFor saving Tiger Lily, Peter is made 'The Great White Father' by the Redskins and they have dinner in celebration with the island natives.  The children pass around the peace pipe, dance, and feast.  By the end of the dinner (during which nearly everybody argues and Wendy has to maintain order), Wendy begins telling the Lost Boys one of her favourite stories- one that Peter dislikes intensely. \n"}, {"text": "What instrument signals the end of the Redskin battle?", "correct": "The tom-tom", "options": ["The flute", "The panpipe", "The bell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe tom-tom.\n\n\tWendy tells her story about the Darling family and their trip to Neverland, including all of the Lost Boys, Peter Pan, and their adventures.  At the end of the story, she tells the Lost Boys about how they will eventually grow up and return home to find the window still open for them.  Soon, the Darling children realize how much they miss home and they make plans to leave for London as soon as possible.  They also decide to bring the Lost Boys with them, thinking that their parents would gladly adopt them.  Peter agrees to let the boys do what they want and forces Tinker Bell to take them over the sea.\rBefore they leave though, a battle breaks out in the Redskin camp.  The pirates overtake the natives, and while Tiger Lily and others get away, the pirates realize that they can signal the end of the battle by playing on the tom-tom.  They inevitably capture all of the children as they emerge from their cave to depart. \n"}, {"text": "Who drinks Peter's medicine after it has been poisoned?", "correct": "Tinker Bell", "options": ["Wendy", "Peter Pan", "Michael"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTinker Bell.\n\n\tWhile the pirates depart with the children in tow, Peter Pan sleeps in his bed.  Captain hook takes this opportunity to slide in through Slightly's tree and poison the medicine waiting for Peter Pan.  When Peter awakens, Tinker Bell returns and tells the boy that Wendy and the others have been taken.  Peter prepares for battle and nearly drinks his medicine, but Tinker Bell, knowing that it had been poisoned, drinks it for him and suffers the consequences.  Peter, realizing what he has done, yells out to the girls and boys of the world, telling them all to believe in fairies.  This inevitably heals Tinker Bell, saving her life.\rOn the Jolly Roger, the boys are asked to join the crew.  When they realize they must forget their family and country, they rebel and Hook says that he will send them all over the plank.  When Hook hears the ticking of an alarm clock though, he cowers, fearing death in the form of a crocodile.  This gives the kids a chance to look over the edge of the boat, and they find Peter Pan. \n"}, {"text": "Peter defeats Captain Hook by tricking him into walking the plank.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe ticking turns out to be Peter who made the noise upon finding the crocodile in the woods and discovering that the clock had run its way out.  Peter tricks the pirates, defeating many of them within the cabin of the ship and switching himself and Wendy (who is tied to the mast).  When Hook hypothesizes that Wendy, being a girl, may have brought bad luck to the ship, he decides to throw her overboard.  When he reaches the mast, Peter reveals himself and the battle begins.  Many of the Lost Boys defeat the pirates (only two survive by going overboard and reaching the island) and Peter defeats Hook by hitting him in the ribs with his sword.  As Hook falls over the railing of the ship, he is left for the crocodile waiting below.\rThe children celebrate by taking the ship and making it their own.  Nonetheless, the Darlings and the Lost Boys wish to return home and they set out for London the following day. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Wendy's daughter?", "correct": "Jane", "options": ["Margaret", "Rose", "Vanessa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJane.\n\n\tThe Darlings, having missed their children dearly, leave the window open and anticipate their return.  Peter and Tinker Bell are first to arrive in London though, and as it turns out, they plan to bar the window shut and hope for the Darling children to go back to Neverland with him.  When he sees Mrs. Darling crying in the next room, he realizes that he can't stop the children and he lets them return home.  The Darlings reunite and Wendy inquires as to the addition of the Lost Boys to the family.  While Mr. and Mrs. Darling agree to take the Lost Boys into their family, Peter notes that he will not stay.  Mrs. Darling agrees to let Wendy help him once a year for spring cleaning, an idea which he is excited about, and he departs saying he'll never forget her.\rAs time goes by, Wendy returns to Neverland once more for spring cleaning.  Peter has already forgotten Tinker Bell and Captain Hook, but he remembers Wendy.  More time passes, however, and Peter doesn't return.  The Lost Boys and the Darling siblings grow up and Wendy has a child named Jane whom she tells her story to.  One night, Peter returns to bring Wendy back to Neverland for spring cleaning, but he discovers that she is no longer young.  Instead, he invites Jane to join him as his new mother and they fly out the window together while Wendy looks on.  In turn, Jane's daughter (and the daughters after that) join Peter in Neverland, and this continues so long as Peter is young. \n"}]}
