What was his real first name before he was \"killed\" and \"reborn\" as Remo?", "correct": "Samuel", "options": ["Macon", "Edward", "William"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSamuel.\n\n\tOfficer Samuel Edward Macon -- whose name we learn at his funeral -- is targeted for recruitment by the mysterious organization CURE.  His death is faked, and he is given plastic surgery to alter his appearance. \n"}, {"text": "Conn \"Mac\" MacCleary (J.A. Preston) is the person who gives Remo his new name.  Mac comes up with the name on the spot after seeing the words \"Remo\" and \"Williams\" somewhere in the hospital room where Fred Ward's character is recovering.  What provided Mac with his sudden inspiration for the new name?", "correct": "a bedpan", "options": ["a magazine cover", "a newspaper headline", "a heart rate monitor"], "explanation": "\n\n\na bedpan.\n\n\tAn imprint on the bottom of a bedpan Mac examines states that the name of the company that manufactured it is \"Williams.\"  The company is apparently headquartered in Remo, Arkansas. \n"}, {"text": "\"Remo,\" according to what Mac reads, is actually the name of a city.  In what state would one find it?", "correct": "Arkansas", "options": ["Arizona", "Montana", "Nevada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArkansas.\n\n\tAgain, the words \"Remo, ARK\" are imprinted on the bottom of the bedpan.  (Anyone know if this is a real city?  I can't find any reference to it online...) \n"}, {"text": "What does Mac bring as a gift to the newly-named Remo in his hospital room?", "correct": "a fruit basket", "options": ["a Whitman sampler of chocolates", "balloons", "flowers"], "explanation": "\n\n\na fruit basket.\n\n\tAs Mac is leaving the room, he even says to Remo, \"Enjoy the fruit.\" \n"}, {"text": "Mac tells Remo that the organization to which he belongs -- and into which Remo has just been recruited, whether he likes it or not -- follow a credo Mac refers to as \"the eleventh commandment.\"  Finish it: \"Thou shalt not ________________________.\"", "correct": "get away with it & get away with it. & get away with it!", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nget away with it & get away with it. & get away with it!\n\n\tI found that line pretty funny. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the top-secret organization that Remo now finds himself a member of?", "correct": "CURE", "options": ["HALO", "HARP", "It's never revealed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCURE.\n\n\tHarold Smith mentions the name of the organization several times throughout the film.  Oddly enough, even though the word is written in all capital letters, it's not actually an acronym.  As anyone who's read the \"Destroyer\" novels (on which this film was based) could tell you, CURE doesn't \"stand for\" anything.  (HARP, by the way, is the name of the satellite that CURE investigates throughout most of the film.) \n"}, {"text": "Mac personally escorts Remo to the headquarters of their organization.

I wonder, though -- why doesn't he count Chiun?  Or the three punks who were obviously hired by Mac to set up Officer Macon in the first place?  Are these people just considered freelance?  Hmmm... \n"}, {"text": "When Remo first lays eyes on Chiun (Joel Grey), the man who will become his mentor, what is Chiun doing?", "correct": "writing calligraphy", "options": ["eating rice", "playing the piano", "watching a soap opera"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwriting calligraphy.\n\n\tChiun is holding a small paint brush; on the floor in front of him is a large piece of parchment containing calligraphic symbols. \n"}, {"text": "From what country does Chiun hail?", "correct": "Korea", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKorea.\n\n\tChiun says this at *least* five times throughout the film -- he's extremely proud of his heritage. \n"}, {"text": "Chiun, quite the verbally abusive taskmaster, compares his new student Remo to more than one kind of animal at certain times in the film.

What is the name of the (fictional) soap that he is obsessed with watching?", "correct": "Beyond the Night", "options": ["Secret Hospital", "Passion and Desire", "Tomorrow Is Today"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeyond the Night.\n\n\tAt the very end of the film, Chiun is in a desperate hurry -- not just to evade the enemy, but to get home in time to watch his favorite show! \n"}, {"text": "Chiun explains to Remo that among his martial arts \"tricks\" is a technique that, if applied properly, can bring a woman to \"total ecstasy.\"  This unusual technique involves touching what part of a woman's body?", "correct": "her wrist", "options": ["her knee", "her elbow", "her toe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nher wrist.\n\n\tChiun says something about tapping the inside of a woman's wrist in time with her pulse...but he neglects to give Remo any further details.

Guess he knows what he's talking about.  =) \n"}, {"text": "When Remo first meets Major Rayner Fleming (Kate Mulgrew), he compliments her on her uniform.  He then comments on a particular part of said uniform.  Finish the line: \"Great ___________.\"", "correct": "buttons", "options": ["shoes", "hat", "medals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbuttons.\n\n\tMajor Fleming finds this quite amusing.  Captain Janeway (\"Star Trek: Voyager\") probably would have flattened him where he stood, though.  =) \n"}, {"text": "Remo is disturbed to learn that the organization to which he now belongs is *so* secret that, if a serious threat of exposure were to arise, specific contingency plans to end the lives of all agents would be enacted immediately.

And, as Smith says to Remo rather coldly, \"Your slanty-eyed pal?  Chiun?  He's got your number.\"  Chiun later confirms, with sadness, that this is true -- he would kill Remo if ordered to do so. \n"}, {"text": "Mac's left arm is artificial, as he lost his real arm after getting too close to an anti-personnel mine.

The Grove personnel actually set Mac up in a hospital bed of sorts -- keeping him alive, presumably, to torture him for information.  The moment that Mac is first left alone, though, he uses a scalpel to sever his life support tubes, choosing to commit suicide rather than risk exposing CURE. \n"}, {"text": "The finale of this film takes place at a U.S. Army weapons testing facility.  What is it called?", "correct": "Mount Promise", "options": ["Mount Hope", "Mount Valor", "Mount Charity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMount Promise.\n\n\tHarold Smith says this to Remo, and we even see the sign at the entrance to the facility. \n"}, {"text": "George Grove's primary assassin, known only as Stone, has a distinctive physical characteristic.
