{"id": "168280", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Abduction of Margaret Houlihan' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "The show opens in post-op, where Margaret very commonly looks over several wounded young soldiers.  Making her way outside, after her shift, she encounters a provocatively dressed Klinger.  Both are confronted by a young Korean girl who needs Margaret's help.  What is the problem?", "correct": "Her mother is giving birth", "options": ["Her brother, a South Korean soldier, has been wounded", "Her grandmother has received some burns", "Her father was injured while plowing a field"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer mother is giving birth.\n\n\tWhen Margaret runs off to help the young girl's mother, Klinger requests that if anything should happen to her he receive her clothes.  Klinger is then relieved by Goldman, who promptly undoes Klinger's bra.  According to Klinger, 'I usually don't let guys do this on the first date.' \n"}, {"text": "Potter requires Margaret's assistance in post-op, so he dispatches Radar to go find her.  Naturally, Radar goes to the Swamp to locate Hot Lips (or perhaps, for comedic reasons?), but only finds Hawkeye playing basketball with Frank's shirt.  B.J. enters the Swamp and is immediately accosted by Radar about Margaret's location.  B.J. says that he doesn't know a Major Houlihan, but he knows where you can get a 'Minor Houlihan'.  Where can a person get one of these?", "correct": "A geisha house in Tokyo", "options": ["A little hotel in Sausalito", "\"I\" Corps", "The Pink Pagoda in Seoul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA geisha house in Tokyo.\n\n\tFrank is awakened by this banter, and naturally becomes hostile towards poor Radar.  According to Frank, 'Any mindless baboon can see that she's not here, including me!  Now get out!' \n"}, {"text": "Frank becomes adamant about finding Margaret, imagining that she has been abducted by 'Chinese heathens'.  Being the macho fellow that he is, he pulls out his handgun to assist his mission.  However, his plan backfires, literally, and he accidentally shoots which 4077th dweller?", "correct": "B.J.", "options": ["Radar", "Hawkeye", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nB.J.\n\n\tWe don't see Frank shoot B.J., rather, the scene shifts to Hawkeye showering.  In the distance, a gunshot goes off, bringing the entire camp towards the Swamp.  Of course 'M*A*S*H' nuts know right away that Frank's gunplay would cause trouble.  Luckily, B.J.'s leg is only grazed by the bullet discharged from Frank's piece.  Frank whines to Potter that he was only cleaning his weapon, and that he thinks Margaret has been captured by the Chinese.  Potter responds, 'I see, and naturally you shot Captain Hunnicutt!' \n"}, {"text": "Potter and Radar converse further about Margaret's disappearance.  Radar announces that Margaret is nowhere to be found in the camp, but he has yet to check the nurses' shower.  Potter insists that he check there too, a request which Radar resists strongly.  According to Radar, what makes him breathe funny?", "correct": "Nudidity", "options": ["Nakedosity", "Non-dressedment", "No-clothesness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNudidity.\n\n\tRadar is well-known for making up words, especially under pressure.  Forced to check the nurses' shower, he comes in with his hand covering his eyes.  An angry Nurse Baker insists that Hot Lips is not in the tent, which satisfies Radar.  Radar is also satisfied with a brief peek between his fingers! \n"}, {"text": "Because Margaret is missing without a trace, Potter requests that 'intelligence' be brought in to further investigate her disappearance.  Naturally, Colonel Flagg arrives!  Flagg enters Radar's office dressed as a Chinese double-agent.  What is this agent's name?", "correct": "Ling Chow", "options": ["Fang Zhu", "Wong Wei", "Liu Bang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLing Chow.\n\n\tRadar recognizes Flagg right away, which is naturally disturbing to our favorite master of disguise.  When queried about this, Radar responds, 'Well, you don't look anything like you, sir.  And since you're a master of disguises, I figured you're the only one who couldn't look like you that much.'  Flagg responds to this convoluted explanation by saying, 'I'll by that...for now.'  He then threatens Radar with the 'Malaysian Chest Implosion Torture'. \n"}, {"text": "After a confrontation with Radar, Flagg next regales Colonel Potter with his nonsensical banter.  After Potter makes a joke, Flagg claims that there's no point in making jokes because he has trained himself not to laugh or smile using a cattle prod and the distinguished films of what comedic team?", "correct": "The Three Stooges", "options": ["The Marx Brothers", "Laurel and Hardy", "Abbot and Costello"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Three Stooges.\n\n\tAccording to Flagg, he watched 100 hours of 'The Three Stooges', and every time he felt the need to smile, he jabbed himself in the stomach with a cattle prod.  Let's hope the cattle prod wasn't electrified! \n"}, {"text": "Flagg next confronts the boys in the Swamp.  Of course, Hawkeye and B.J. are both perversely insubordinate, responding with entirely smart-alecky answers to Flagg's questions.  After one wiseacre response too many, Flagg consults his apparent torture manual, threatening B.J. with what sort of physical violence?", "correct": "The biting off of his left ear", "options": ["The removal of his spleen through his nostril", "The shaving off of his sideburns with a kitchen knife", "The amputation of both his big toes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe biting off of his left ear.\n\n\tWhen Flagg inquires about B.J.'s injured leg, B.J. responds that he 'cut himself shaving'.  Flagg then asks B.J. where Houlihan is, to which B.J. answers, 'I think it's near Dublin'.  Flagg responds thusly: 'That's insubordination.  You do that to me one more time and I'm entitled to...(flipping through his notebook)...bite off your left ear.  Just food for thought.' \n"}, {"text": "Flagg approaches the cowardly Frank next, making it known that Frank is his prime suspect.  He catches our favorite snivelling Major reading what 'subversive' magazine?", "correct": "Reader's Digest", "options": ["T.V. Guide", "Life", "Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReader's Digest.\n\n\tFlagg tells Frank that reading 'Reader's Digest' won't look good on his record, which perplexes Frank.  Flagg explains that 'when you eliminate the third, fifth and sixth letters' then it becomes 'Red's Digest'.  He then calls Frank 'Comrade' and 'Pinko'.  This is Frank we're talking about here! \n"}, {"text": "After a cute session in which Colonel Potter, with the assistance of the 'pregnant' Radar, teaches a class to Korean women on giving birth, we discover Colonel Flagg in Potter's office chatting with Hawkeye and B.J.  During the conversation, Flagg announces to the doctors that he is what force of nature?", "correct": "The wind", "options": ["Gravity", "Light", "An Earthquake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe wind.\n\n\tAt the end of the episode, his mission complete, Flagg insists that all the M*A*S*H dwellers close their eyes for his departure.  He then procedes to dive out the window of Colonel Potter's office.  Hawkeye looks out the wind and quips, 'The wind just broke its leg.' \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Flagg has concocted a 'brilliant' plan to locate Margaret, which he describes in detail to Potter and the gang.  Which of these clear-headed proposals is not part of Flagg's master plan to find Margaret?", "correct": "A box of scorpions", "options": ["A squadron of copters for an air-to-ground search", "A platoon of rangers to parachute into North Korea, to shoot anything that moves", "Offshore artillery from the Navy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA box of scorpions.\n\n\tThe other three proposals are all part of his grand scheme to locate Margaret.  The box of scorpions is 'personal'...a gift for a friend.  Luckily, Margaret turns up on her own and Flagg is allowed to disappear in his own particular idiom.
