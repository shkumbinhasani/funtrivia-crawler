Also not uncommon is the banter eminating from the lips of our half-crazed medical friends while they operate.  Among the chatter we see Frank Burns become extra snippy with the nurse who helps him.  Following the O.R. session, Burns insists on putting this nurse on report.  Who is the target of his ire?", "correct": "Ginger", "options": ["Dish", "Cutler", "Kellye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGinger.\n\n\tFrank decides that he wants to file insubordination charges against Ginger Bayliss because she handed him the wrong type of surgical thread.  This confrontation is a set-up for the fireworks to come later in the episode between Frank and the rest of the doctors. \n"}, {"text": "Amidst the controversy sparked by Frank, Radar arrives with a telegram from General Hammond congratulating Henry Blake for the high efficiency rating at the 4077th.  Following this, Hammond appears personally at the M*A*S*H in order to award Henry with a Special Citation of Merit.  What 'class' is this citation?", "correct": "4th", "options": ["1st", "3rd", "2nd"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4th.\n\n\tOnly the best for Henry Blake.  Henry proceeds to deliver one of the lamest acceptance speeches in the history of humankind.  At one point, he does admit that Radar is 'actually in command' of the 4077th...which gets a laugh. \n"}, {"text": "During Henry's acceptance speech for his award, he reveals his hometown.  From which of these charming midwestern town does Henry hail?", "correct": "Bloomington, Illinois", "options": ["Madison, Wisconsin", "Fort Wayne, Indiana", "Kalamazoo, Michigan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBloomington, Illinois.\n\n\tAnyone who knows Henry Blake knows about his pride in Illinois, where he attended college and medical school.  \r Fortunately for the gang, General Hammond is generous enough to interrupt Henry's speech in order to announce that Henry is 'needed elsewhere'.  He is being assigned to Tokyo Medical Headquarters for 'administrative and training duties'. \n"}, {"text": "Henry has been assigned by General Hammond to Tokyo.  As a parting gift to Henry, what lovely item do Hawkeye and Trapper provide for their beloved former chief officer?", "correct": "A bra", "options": ["An army boot", "A bedpan", "A roll of toilet paper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA bra.\n\n\tThe bra is a 'prescription for [Henry's] health', and Hawkeye suggests he 'have it filled in Tokyo'.  Henry insists that he will miss the two doctors and that they are 'the two finest cutters' he's ever been around.  It is at this same moment that Trapper and Hawkeye also discover that Frank will be their new C.O. \n"}, {"text": "With Henry away, Frank Burns is more than ready to establish a new order at the 4077th.  One of his first acts as new C.O. at the 4077th is to confiscate the Swamp's still.  He orders a military policeman to take the still, only to be threatened by Trapper with what item?", "correct": "Flyswatter", "options": ["Tennis racket", "Monkey wrench", "Rolled up newspaper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlyswatter.\n\n\tTrapper, holding the flyswatter, issues this threat: 'You watch it buddy, this thing could go off!'  Frank orders the M.P. to draw his weapon, to which Hawkeye responds, 'He's got the drop on us Tex.  We can't do a thing.' \n"}, {"text": "Not only do the surgeons at the 4077th have North Korea and China to deal with, they now have Frank Burns to boot.  They dicuss amongst themselves various ways to rid themselves of good old Ferret Face.  What is Ugly John's suggestion?", "correct": "Remove Frank's appendix", "options": ["Push Frank into a chopper blade", "Get Frank sent back to the States", "Toss Frank into the latrine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRemove Frank's appendix.\n\n\tOther's suggest the chopper blade and the Stateside solutions, but Ugly John is the one who comes up with the appendix removal plan.  The doctors claim that this is not very imaginative, which is ironic considering that there are two later episodes during the series where Hawkeye and friends actually remove healthy appendices (In the third season episode 'White Gold', they remove Colonel Flagg's appendix, while in the seventh season episode 'Preventative Medicine', Hawkeye removes a Colonel's healthy appendix despite BJ's protests.) \n"}, {"text": "It is decided that Trapper and Hawkeye will journey to Tokyo to retrieve Henry by massaging his ego.  When we first see the two doctors with Henry, what are the three of them doing?", "correct": "Bathing", "options": ["Playing cards", "Golfing", "Drinking"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBathing.\n\n\tHenry certainly is living it up in his new cushy job at the Tokyo Medical Headquarters.  While he chats and soaks with Hawkeye and Trapper he is massaged with soap.  'Pleasures of the flesh,' Hawkeye remarks.  Later, Trapper and Hawkeye work on Henry's ego while a young woman works on his back with her feet. \n"}, {"text": "Later, Trapper and Hawkeye dine with Henry Blake while being serenaded by some geishas.  Their lovely sushi meal is interrupted, however, when Leslie calls from the 4077th.  After chatting with Henry, she asks for Hawkeye who discusses Radar's sudden downward health turn.  What sort of problem is Radar suffering from, according to the doctors?", "correct": "Abdominal pain", "options": ["Chest pains", "Depression", "Loss of memory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbdominal pain.\n\n\tAt first, Hawkeye doesn't let on that the problem case he discusses on the phone is actually Radar.  Trapper later 'accidentally' reveals that Radar is the patient in question, much to Hawkeye's faux annoyance.  It doesn't take long to convince Henry to return to Korea with them. \n"}, {"text": "Henry insists on returning to the 4077th to see after Radar's condition.  In the process, he claims to a specialist in which of these areas?", "correct": "Diagnosis", "options": ["Internal medicine", "Triage", "Brain surgery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiagnosis.\n\n\t'I was the best diagnostician in Bloomington,' claims Henry.  Hook, line and sinker, think Hawkeye and Trapper.  Henry asks the boys to reserve a chopper at the airport and the three of them are off across the Sea of Japan. \n"}, {"text": "Back at the 4077th, Radar lies in a hospital cot, moaning away.  Henry is quick to examine the young man, that is, until Frank enters.  Frank claims that Radar is gold-bricking.  What example does he use to prove that Radar is perfectly fit?", "correct": "He saw him eat a quart of ice cream at lunch", "options": ["He participated in the daily foot inspection earlier in the afternoon", "He saw him at the company cockroach race that morning", "He accompanied Frank on a 4-mile march at dawn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe saw him eat a quart of ice cream at lunch.\n\n\tRadar responds to Frank's accusation by saying, 'I was so sick I didn't know what I was doing.'  The jig is up when Frank and Henry have a confrontation, followed by Henry's threat to call General Hammond.  Radar jumps out of bed to call General Hammond, blowing the entire ruse.  However, as a result of the circumstances, Henry is convinced that he should stay at the 4077th.  \r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my many other 'M*A*S*H'-related quizzes. \n"}]}
