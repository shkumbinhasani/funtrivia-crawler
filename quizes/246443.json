Potter was both a good leader and a caring fatherly figure.  Do we ever learn what the 'T' stands for in his name during any episode?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIndeed, what the 'T' stands for is still a mystery, though there has been a lot of speculation.

Oddly enough, prior to establishing Missouri as the home of Colonel Potter, he mentions something about living in Nebraska. \n"}, {"text": "Along with his wife, Sherman Potter is very proud of the rest of his family, and mentions a number of family members during the show.  What was Colonel Potter's daughter's name?", "correct": "Evy", "options": ["Colleen", "Teresa", "Violet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvy.\n\n\tEvy has a child, and is married to a man named Bob Wilson, who we actually get to meet in the eleventh season episode 'Strange Bedfellows'.

His first full episode was called 'Change of Command', though we get a brief glimpse of him in the episode just prior, namely 'Welcome to Korea'.  Harry Morgan also showed up as a completely different character, a certain General Steele, in the third season episode 'The General Flipped at Dawn'. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter served in the U.S. Army during World War II, but not World War I.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn World War I, he enlisted in the army, though he claimed that he was underage.

Though he claimed to be 62 in the episode 'Pressure Points', this conflicts with other claims he made in different episodes.  In one episode, he suggests that he enlisted early in the army so he could be in the cavalry during World War I, but if he was really 62 he would have been around 25 when World War I started.  Ah well, no matter, 62 sounds like a good age! \n"}, {"text": "How did Colonel Potter leave the 4077th in the very last episode, namely 'Goodbye, Farewell and Amen'?", "correct": "On his horse", "options": ["In a bus", "In a jeep", "In a chopper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn his horse.\n\n\tColonel Potter left his horse Sophie in Korea before returning to the states, but not before giving her one last ride out of the 4077th, the fitting end to his grand command and an eight year tour-of-duty on the best TV show of all time! \n"}]}
