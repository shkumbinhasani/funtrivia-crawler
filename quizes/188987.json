{"id": "188987", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - Margaret Houlihan Quiz / Test | M*A*S*H - Characters and Actors | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "M*A*S*H - Characters and Actors"], "questions": [{"text": "Margaret Houlihan is one of my favorite characters from 'M*A*S*H'.  This is due, in no small part, to the actress who portrays her.  What is the name of the actress who played Margaret on the television series?", "correct": "Loretta Swit", "options": ["Terri Garr", "Sally Kellerman", "Cloris Leachman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoretta Swit.\n\n\tAs fans of 'M*A*S*H' may know, Sally Kellerman did a marvelous job of portraying Hot Lips Houlihan in the 1970 movie version of 'M*A*S*H'.  However, on the small screen it was Loretta Swit who took her turn as the voluptuous and brilliant head nurse at the 4077th.  \r A couple interesting things about Loretta Swit: She was actually the first choice to star as either Cagney or Lacey in the television show by that name, but couldn't get out of her contract at FOX (she would have left after the eighth season of the show) AND she was once married to an actor named Dennis Holahan (talk about life resembling art). \n"}, {"text": "Margaret Houlihan was one of only two characters (the other being Hawkeye) to appear in both the pilot episode and the final, two-hour episode of 'M*A*S*H'.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOh no, a tricky question!  Actually, Father Mulcahy appeared in both the pilot episode and the final episode, though two different actors portrayed the character.  George Morgan played Mulcahy in the pilot episode (his only appearance on the show), while William Christopher was Mulcahy in the last episode (and all other episodes in between). \n"}, {"text": "During the run of the series, Margaret Houlihan often touts her background as an 'army brat'.  At which of these military bases was Margaret born in the 1920s?", "correct": "Fort Ord", "options": ["Camp Williams", "The Presidio", "West Point"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFort Ord.\n\n\tMargaret's upbringing seemed somewhat difficult, having to move from place to place at the whim of the U.S. army.  Her father was a military man and her mother an army nurse.  \r By the way, Fort Ord is an actual army base located not far from Monterey, California. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret mentions her parents and a sister during the run of the show.  Her father's name is mentioned a number of times throughout the series, what was it?", "correct": "'Howitzer' Alvin Houlihan", "options": ["Hank 'The Tank' Houlihan", "Louis 'Gun' Houlihan", "'Bullet' Barney Houlihan"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Howitzer' Alvin Houlihan.\n\n\tMargaret's father is a Colonel in the United States army.  His nickname comes from the famous howitzer short gun used for firing shells at long distances on the battle field.  The name is from the Czech for 'catapult'. \n"}, {"text": "Which relative of Margaret's, if any, appeared in an episode of 'M*A*S*H'?", "correct": "Her father", "options": ["Her sister", "Her mother", "None of her relatives appeared on the show"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer father.\n\n\t'Howitzer' Al appeared in the season nine episode 'Father's Day', and was portrayed by actor Andrew Duggan.  In this episode, a series of misunderstandings, along with the unmilitary behavior of Hawkeye and BJ, creates a rift between Margaret and her father.  However, by the end of the episode there is an understanding between the two and they part on good terms.  \r The names of both Margaret's mother and sister are never mentioned during the run of the series, nor do we ever see either of them. \n"}, {"text": "While Margaret spent the first four seasons of the show 'M*A*S*H' in an awkward relationship with Frank Burns, by the fifth season she had met a new man that she would eventually marry.  What is the surname of Margaret's eventual husband?", "correct": "Penobscott", "options": ["Rayvenholm", "Shenovsky", "Popadopolis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPenobscott.\n\n\tMargaret first announces her engagement to Lt. Col. Donald Penobscott in the season five episode 'Margaret's Engagement', and she is married to him in the final episode of the fifth season, entitled 'Margaret's Marriage' (Terribly clever episode titles, don't you think?).  Donald appears twice on the show, once in 'Margaret's Marriage' (actor Beason Carroll) and once in the sixth season episode 'The M*A*S*H Olympics' (actor Mike Henry).  Following that episode, Margaret's marriage became sour, and she proceeded to file for divorce from Donald. Her divorce papers are finalized in the year seven episode 'Hot Lips is Back in Town'. \n"}, {"text": "After Margaret's divorce from Donald, she becomes romantically involved with another army soldier, this time a sergeant.  What is the name of this fellow who appeared in three separate episodes?", "correct": "Jack Scully", "options": ["Brad Reiter", "Tim Johnson", "Wayne DeLancey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Scully.\n\n\tJoshua Bryant appeared in several 'M*A*S*H' episodes as Jack Scully, a macho army sergeant who takes his turn at wooing Margaret.  He first appears in the seventh season episode 'A Night at Rosie's', where he has taken refuge while AWOL from his unit.  He also appears in the season eight episodes entitled 'Guerilla My Dreams' and 'Stars and Stripes'.  In the end, Scully and Margaret part ways. \n"}, {"text": "Here's one for those who truly pay attention.  In the sixth season episode 'Patent 4077' we discover that Margaret's wedding ring has the following inscription: 'Over Hill, Over Dale, Our Love Will Never Fail'.  When Klinger misplaces Margarets ring during the episode, he has it replaced by a local Korean metalworker.  Which word in the inscription is incorrectly spelled on the replacement ring?", "correct": "Never", "options": ["Hill", "Dale", "Love"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNever.\n\n\tThe replacement ring's inscription reads: 'Over Hill, Over Dale, Our Love Will *Ever* Fail'.  When Margaret discovers what Klinger (and the also complicit Hawkeye and BJ) has done she is furious.  By the end of the episode, she comes to her senses and appreciates Klinger for the good sentiments. \n"}, {"text": "In the episode 'C*A*V*E' we discover that the intrepid Margaret Houlihan actually does have a phobia.  What is it that she fears?", "correct": "Loud noises", "options": ["Open spaces", "Dark places", "Enclosed places"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoud noises.\n\n\tWhile Hawkeye admits to an acute fear of enclosed spaces (otherwise known as 'claustrophobia'), Margaret reveals that she has an extreme fear of loud noises (the somewhat more obscure 'ligyrophobia').  This comes as a big surprise considering that Margaret has spent her entire life connected to the army.  And her father fired howitzers! \n"}, {"text": "An easy one to end the quiz with: What was Margaret Houlihan's rank in the army throughout the run of the series?", "correct": "Major", "options": ["Captain", "Lieutenant", "Lieutenant Colonel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor.\n\n\tIn the episode 'Hot Lips is Back in Town' she is offered a position on General Lyle Weiskopf's staff and a promotion to lieutenant colonel, but she turns this down when she discovers that the promotion is predicated on her performance as the General's lover and not her expertise.  Incidentally, it was at General Weiskopf's party in Tokyo where we discover the first signs of trouble between Margaret and Donald in the episode 'Fade In, Fade Out'.\r Thank you for playing this quiz.  I hope you have enjoyed it and will try more of my 'M*A*S*H'-related quizzes (and perhaps some of my other stuff as well). \n"}]}
