{"id": "222317", "name": "A Day at the \"Met\" Quiz / Test | Thematic Fun | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun", "Thematic Alphabet Fun"], "questions": [{"text": "As you walk in the main entrance, a mosaic inscription above the door catches your eye. \"Ill MET by moonlight,\" it reads in careful curled letters, recalling one of the most famous quotations to include the word \"met.\" The line comes from what scene in the Shakespeare canon?", "correct": "Oberon speaks to Titania in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\"", "options": ["Tybalt speaks to Romeo in \"Romeo and Juliet.\"", "Macbeth speaks to MacDuff in \"Macbeth.\"", "Demetrius speaks to Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nOberon speaks to Titania in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\"\n\n\tAct II, Scene 1 of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" begins with exposition: there's trouble in the world of the fairies. Puck, loyal to the fairy king Oberon, and an unnamed fairy loyal to Queen Titania, discuss how a disagreement over custody of a favored changeling has led the royal couple to despise each other.Then the principals encounter each other in a forest glade, and insults fly! \"Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania,\" Oberon begins. Titania accuses him of being jealous, Oberon accuses her of not knowing her place as his wife, and the conversation goes downhill from there. Can this marriage be saved? (Since the play is a comedy, the answer is \"yes,\" but only after several acts' worth of hijinks.) \n"}, {"text": "Just past the coat check, you spot a large display of weights and measures. Rulers, graduated cylinders, thermometers, brass weights and a stopwatch combine to explain the METric system, which is now the most commonly used system of measurement in the world. There are only a few countries left that don't use metric -- but which was the first to adopt it?", "correct": "France", "options": ["Spain", "China", "United States of America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrance.\n\n\tCommissioned by Louis XVI and implemented by his successors in the French revolutionary government, the metric system was intended to eliminate the need for large numbers of units with complicated conversion factors. Instead of oh-so-easy systems like 12 inches to a foot and 5280 feet to a mile, metric users can simply move around zeroes and decimal points: 1000 millimeters to a meter and 1000 meters to a kilometer. Other metric units include the kilogram (for mass) and the second (for time; the only non-decimalized metric unit). Based on physical quantities (like the boiling point of water and the circumference of the Earth), the metric system is especially convenient for scientific use.\r By the turn of the millennium, only three countries were not using the metric system: Liberia, Myanmar, and the United States of America. \n"}, {"text": "As you enter the biology exhibit, you realize that we owe our very beginnings to MET. Every person's first cell was created by the fusion of two gaMETes: an ovum, or egg, from the mother, and a sperm cell from the father. Each parent has two complete sets of chromosomes in his or her genetic code; how many sets of chromosomes are encoded in a single gamete?", "correct": "1: Approximately half the parent's genetic material", "options": ["2: All the parent's genetic material", "It depends on whether the gamete is a sperm cell or an egg cell", "3: All the parent's genetic material, as well as a backup copy"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1: Approximately half the parent's genetic material.\n\n\tNormal cell division in the body -- the process which makes new hair and skin cells, for example -- is via mitosis: the new cell gets an exact copy of both sets of chromosomes in its parent. Both cells are diploid: they have two sets of chromosomes. Gametes, however, are haploid cells: they're produced via a process of cell division called meiosis, where each daughter cell gets half the genetic material of the parent cell. Combine two gametes and you get a full set of chromosomes: the first building block of a person!\r The word \"gamete\" comes from an ancient Greek word meaning \"spouse,\" which seems appropriate. It's incredible how much science you can understand, just by knowing some Greek and Latin! \n"}, {"text": "Passing into an exhibit on famous people, you notice a bust of Klemens von METternich scowling down at you. You recall that he was an important diplomat and politician -- in fact, your history books all referred to an \"Age of Metternich\" between Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo and the revolutions of 1848. From what country did this statesman come?", "correct": "Austria", "options": ["Switzerland", "Hanover", "Prussia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAustria.\n\n\tMetternich (1773-1859), born to a man who was both a count and a diplomat, was intrigued by politics from the beginning. Several ambassadorial stints in his youth (to the Congress of Rastadt, Savoy, Berlin and Paris) familiarized him both with the prominent international issues of the day and with the people who made things happen on a continental scale.\r He became Austria's Foreign Minister in 1809 at a time when the country was gravely threatened by Napoleon's ambitions. He played Russia and Napoleon's France against each other with admirable aplomb, also maintaining a watchful eye on Prussia (which would go on, some sixty years later, to unite the states of Germany under its hegemony). Always concerned with the balance of power, it was his consent that made the Bourbon Restoration possible in France, and it was his vision of a Europe governed by the actions of the Great Powers that prevailed. He spent the next decades aligning those Powers so as to squelch revolutionary movements; his career ended with the widespread revolutions of 1848.\r At once a symbol of consummate diplomacy and of government oppression, Metternich's influence continues to be felt in international politics today. You wander to the next exhibit certain that Metternich earned this showcase! \n"}, {"text": "You pass by a bust of METhuselah, the oldest man described in the Bible, and stop in front of the photograph of someone who died far too young. This black Chicago child was 14 in the summer of 1955 when, visiting relatives in Mississippi, he was kidnapped and brutally murdered by local racists -- for the \"crime\" of whistling at a white woman. Widely publicized images of his mangled body energized the nascent American civil rights movement. Who was this child, whose death inspired songs, poems, plays, and novels?", "correct": "Emmett Till", "options": ["Emmett Mobley", "James Hammett", "Irvin Metcalf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmmett Till.\n\n\tEmMETt Till had gone with his cousins one afternoon to the general store run by the Bryant family. The fourteen-year-old allegedly flirted with Mrs. Bryant and may have whistled at her -- and for that, she, her husband, and his brother decided that the child deserved a horrible death. He was kidnapped in the middle of the night from his uncle's house, brutally beaten, shot in the head, and thrown in the river, his body weighed down with a fan. When his body was found, his mother insisted on having an open-casket funeral so that the world could see what had been done to her child.\r Till's murderers were acquitted by an all-white jury after a 67-minute deliberation (which included a break for soda pop \"to make it look good\"); a few months later, they confessed in full to Look Magazine. (They could not be tried again due to the Constitutional protection against double jeopardy.) To their deathbeds, neither of them expressed any remorse for their unspeakable crime. Till continues to be remembered and mourned as one of the American civil rights movement's earliest and most heartbreaking martyrs. \n"}, {"text": "A 1969 photograph of a very ordinary baseball team heads the last exhibit in the Hall of People. After a mediocre season start, the club came from nowhere to sweep the pennant race and take the World Series; their pitcher was later involved in a commercial saying, \"If [we] can win the World Series, America can get out of Vietnam.\" What was the name of this consistently underrated New York team?", "correct": "New York Mets", "options": ["New York Yankees", "New York Giants", "Brooklyn Dodgers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York Mets.\n\n\t\"Mediocre\" doesn't really begin to describe the start of the New York METs' 1969 season: on opening day they lost to a brand-new expansion team (the ill-fated Montreal Expos), and their record through May was 21 wins and 23 losses. By the end of the season, however, the Mets had managed to 100-62: their first winning year in the history of the franchise (they started playing in 1962). The Orioles were heavily favored to win the year's World Series, but the Miracle Mets' luck hadn't yet run out; they won the Series four games to one.\r Tom Seaver, the Mets' main pitcher, was the player who appeared in the anti-war ad. \n"}, {"text": "You step into a large booth on the second floor. Footage of a Black Sabbath concert is showing on a projection screen, and through headphones you can listen to bands from Judas Priest to Rage Against The Machine. That's right: this room is devoted to heavy METal music. Which of the following has NOT been proposed as a possible explanation for the origin of the term \"heavy metal\"?", "correct": "It was scornfully uttered by a roadie, upset at the weight of the gear he had to haul from the truck to the concert stage.", "options": ["\"Heavy metal\" was descriptive of the musical mood, and the use of heavy metals in two band names -- Iron Butterfly and Led Zeppelin -- clinched the name.", "It may be a reference to heavy manufacturing in Birmingham, England, where several early metal bands hailed from.", "Sandy Pearlman, looking for an occult symbol for the band whose albums he produced, used the alchemical symbol for lead -- a heavy metal."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was scornfully uttered by a roadie, upset at the weight of the gear he had to haul from the truck to the concert stage.\n\n\tHeavy metal (or simply \"metal\") music, a genre that evolved in the late 1960s and early 1970s from blues, hard rock and classical influences, tends to feature sound distortions, high volume, and a central role for drums and guitars -- especially bass guitars. No one is entirely certain at this point who first described such music as \"metal,\" though the three answers given above are popular theories; the term's first appearance in print seems to have been in the rock-and-roll monthly magazine Creem: \"Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book\" (Mike Saunders's review of the album \"Kingdom Come\" by Sir Lord Baltimore).\r Heavy metal remains a popular genre, though you note that the exhibit doesn't contain as much information as it should about the many subgenres that have arisen over the last several decades. It doesn't even mention thrash metal! Not even the Met is a perfect museum, it seems. \n"}, {"text": "Near the elevators is a small chemistry exhibit with a nice display on a famous fuel. Each molecule is devised of one atom of carbon combined with four hydrogen atoms; the result is the main component of natural gas, and (more distressingly) is a significant greenhouse gas. What is this chemical compound, also known as \"marsh gas\"?", "correct": "Methane", "options": ["Methanol", "Methotrexate", "Formaldehyde"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMethane.\n\n\tThe simplest alkane in existence, methane's appeal as a fuel arises from its clean burning process: CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O. At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, it's a colorless and odorless gas, which is part of what makes natural gas leaks so dangerous (methane makes up 97% of natural gas by volume); the telltale smell we now associate with natural gas is actually an additive, inserted into commercial natural gas to make leaks detectable by ordinary people. \r Although methane burns more cleanly (releasing less CO2) than other fuels, it's dangerous in its own right as a greenhouse gas: one ton of methane has about 23 times the effect on atmospheric temperature as one ton of carbon dioxide. \n"}, {"text": "Your eye falls on a stunning picture: a trail of light stretching across a starry sky. It's a coMET! These balls of ice pass by the Earth during a highly elliptical orbit across the solar system; the beautiful tail is produced by heat and light from the sun. The explanation of comets was a major victory for astronomers. What was the first comet whose return was successfully predicted?", "correct": "Halley's Comet", "options": ["Comet Hale-Bopp", "Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9", "Comet McNaught"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalley's Comet.\n\n\tThe comet - widely considered a powerful portent, whether for good or for evil - was a mystery for thousands of years. In the tale of Gilgamesh, they are described as stars falling from the heavens. Aristotle believed that comets were examples of spontaneous combustion in the atmosphere (an explanation that he also used for meteors and the northern lights). Even after Tycho Brahe's 1577 proof that comets were more distant from the earth than the moon was, confusion persisted. Early Copernican astronomers believed that only planets orbited the sun; comets must therefore pass between the planets in straight lines. \r Newton settled the issue mathematically, proving that comets must have orbits governed by gravity, but it took Edmund Halley to provide the final empirical proof. Looking back over old astronomical records, he realized that the comets appearing in 1531, 1607, and 1682 shared very similar paths - and that he could account for the differences by including the gravitational effects of passage close to Jupiter and Saturn. His work led to the prediction of the comet's return to within a single month, and its arrival on schedule confirmed the application of Newton's laws to non-planetary bodies. \n"}, {"text": "As you leave the building, your attention is drawn to one last display: a small television displaying scenes from a famous Nintendo video game. \"METroid\" is a series of games following the adventures of bounty hunter Samus Aran; the screen is showing the very first of these games, released in 1986 for the Famicom Disk System. What genre best describes \"Metroid\"?", "correct": "Science fiction", "options": ["Sword and sorcery", "Martial arts", "Military"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScience fiction.\n\n\tSamus Aran burst onto Famicom gamers' screens in the summer of 1986, later expanding her reach with Nintendo releases in the U.S. (August 1987) and Europe (January 1988). Clad in an extraordinarily powerful cybernetic suit, Samus wanders the labyrinthine planet Tebes, fighting Space Pirates and seeking to neutralize their rumored biological weapon (the Metroids). Players who finished in a certain amount of time got a surprise finish: Samus, in a radical departure from contemporaneous action games, is revealed to be a woman, and appears in a bikini! \r \"Metroid\" was the first entry in a tremendously popular series; on Nintendo, it generated over nine sequels and various remakes for seven different game systems. Often, the original game was available as a bonus level that could be unlocked with dedicated play. And for those who just could not get enough of Samus, the magazine \"Nintendo Power\" ran several serial \"Metroid\" comic strips. \n"}]}
