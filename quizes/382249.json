Lacking receipt is another way of saying \"I'm not getting any\".\r There are numerous stories about this number and how it came into being including that the band's lack of satisfaction came from an incident at a concert at the Jack Russell Stadium in Clearwater, Florida on May 6, 1965. The Stones were only four songs into their gig when an altercation occurred between punters and the police, bringing the show to an end. That night Keith Richard would roll out of bed, turn on his tape recorder, play the riff and go back to sleep. When he presented the tape to the band they heard the riff and, later, Keith snoring.\r Much thanks to Pollucci19 for writing this question and to Looney_Tunes for the song! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these songs by The Avons is a cover of a song originally performed by Paul Evans?", "correct": "Seven Little Girls (Sitting In the Back Seat)", "options": ["My Grandfather Clock", "We're Only Young Once", "Dance On!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven Little Girls (Sitting In the Back Seat).\n\n\tThe Avons were a vocal pop group initially comprised of sisters Valerie and Elaine Murtagh, later joined by Raymond S.
