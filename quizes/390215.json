When asked where it hurts, he yells that it burns everywhere.\rHopper is brought to the Hawkins lab where he's hosed down by lab techs.\rOn the drive, Dustin gives Steve all the info he needs to assure him that he has a creature from the Upside-Down hiding in his cellar.  When they get back to Dustin's house, Steve brings the bat with him and they open the doors to head inside.  The coast seems clear; they can't see Dart from the door, so they descend inside.  Steve finds another shed skin and, in the corner, a tunnel burrowed through the corner of the cellar stretching deep beneath Hawkins.\rA car pulls up to the Byers household and enters the front door.  Inside, men from the Hawkins lab take photos of the tunnel system map. \n"}, {"text": "Murray chalks up Jonathan's lack of relationship to which of these?", "correct": "Trust issues", "options": ["His fear of ending up like his father", "His mother's problems", "Economical worries"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrust issues.\n\n\tJoyce argues with Dr. Owens and his team about Will's appointments saying that Will made it very clear for weeks that things were wrong leading up to his recent episode.  Joyce wants Will to be transferred to a real hospital and asks what they're treating him for, but no one speaks up.\rNancy, Jonathan, and Murray begin making copies of their tape and sending them out to the proper news outlets.  Murray tells them to stay the night since it's already late and the two make a fuss about where they'll each sleep.  He seems very capable of pulling lies from Nancy and Jonathan both, reading their problems easily enough, and he suggests they just share the guest room.  It's awkward enough, but they both decide not to...until they both kiss. \n"}, {"text": "Lucas finally reaches Dustin on the walkie-talkie.  Where does Dustin ask him to meet up?", "correct": "Junkyard", "options": ["Quarry", "School", "Library"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJunkyard.\n\n\tThe next morning, Lucas finds out that Dustin had been trying to get to him on the walkie-talkie for a day.  As it turned out, Dustin and Steve had stayed up all night; he gets back to Lucas immediately when Lucas turns on his walkie.  Dustin gives him a quick briefing of the situation (mainly saying that Dart is a Demogorgon) and tells him to bring his things out to the junkyard to meet with him and Steve as they try to locate him.\rAt the lab, Hopper and Owens suit up and descend into the ground in the basement, taking a makeshift elevator to the bottom of the shaft to find that the tunnels have greatly expanded under their very noses.  As Owens says, there's a bit of a complication in continuing to set fire to the spreading force.\rThe complication is, of course, Will. \n"}, {"text": "After a short time in the hospital, Will claims to forget who of these?", "correct": "Bob", "options": ["Mike", "Jonathan", "Joyce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob.\n\n\tJoyce has no choice but to reveal the entire truth to Bob in the hospital since, now, he's knee-deep in whatever weird things are happening in Hawkins.  The two of them discuss the paperwork Bob will need to fill out when Will wakes up from his nap.  In a weird moment, Will has to ask who Bob is; he doesn't remember him at all.\rMurray makes breakfast for Nancy and Jonathan, smugly asking about how they slept.  Nancy gives her mother a call to say she'll be heading home, but Jonathan can't get a hold of his family.  Murray sends them off with a bottle of vodka and a bottle of water and tells them not to reach each him again.\rLucas heads to Max's house to invite her along, claiming he has proof to back up his stories to her.  She hides the visit from Billy and sneaks out her bedroom window to come along. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Owens implies that Will's reactions involving the creature from the Upside-Down are which of these?", "correct": "A virus", "options": ["A relationship", "A symbiosis", "A psychological disorder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA virus.\n\n\tDr. Owens asks Will some questions in front of a number of doctors and, via camera, some scientists, specifically getting to the bottom of how much Will remembers and doesn't.  While he seems to remember his mother and Mike, he doesn't remember Dr. Owens's visits or Hopper.  He also says that he remembers being hurt the previous night, not by doctors, but by soldiers. Will says it upset the creature.  Dr. Owens performs a test on Will shortly after, burning a cut vine and finding a link between it and Will.  What is unusual, he says, is that the virus inside Will seems to be communicating to him. The good news is that a virus can be cured.  Joyce is nonetheless worried that Will could forget everything. \n"}, {"text": "What type of shampoo does Steve claim to use?", "correct": "Faberge", "options": ["Dimension", "Perma Soft", "Finesse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaberge.\n\n\tDustin and Steve walk the train tracks through the forest, tossing meat from buckets while talking about 'that moment' when you feel something special for a girl.  They talk about how Nancy is different from the other girls and Steve tells Dustin to stay away from Max since she'll only break his heart and he's too young for that.  They don't notice that they're crossing the same track of dead trees that Hopper marked earlier in the week.\rHopper heads to his car and tries to use his radio to contact Eleven, but she's not there.\rLooking at Will's brain scans in a conference room, Dr. Owens finds that abnormalities are spreading; his colleagues suggest continuing the burn on the foreign matter. \n"}, {"text": "What does Jonathan find when he returns home?", "correct": "A Polaroid cartridge", "options": ["A flamethrower", "A ransom letter", "A demogorgon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Polaroid cartridge.\n\n\tIn the hospital, while Joyce gets anxious, Will has memories of the soldiers burning the tunnels and spies guards with guns down the hallway.  Mike asks what he remembers and Will admits to him that he thinks he knows how to stop the monster.\rDustin and Jonathan make it to the junkyard and drop the remainder of their meat before Lucas and Max arrive.  Lucas and Dustin argue over whether or not they should have told Max anything, but they have to stop and get back to work.\rJonathan and Nancy get back to Jonathan's place to find the house littered with Will's tunnel map.  Jonathan finds the image of the monster on his desk and, on the ground, a Polaroid cartridge. \n"}, {"text": "Max moved to Indiana after which of these events? ", "correct": "Her parents divorced", "options": ["Her family went bankrupt", "Her father died", "Her step-brother got out of jail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer parents divorced.\n\n\tIn the labs, Dr. Owens tries something new by laying all the photos of Will's tunnel system out on a table.  Will points at a specific spot on the map, a convergence of several tunnels, and tells the doctors that the monster doesn't want him to see there because it must be important.  The soldiers immediately head inside.\rAt the junkyard, Jonathan and the kids set up their plan with the kids organizing the scraps and Jonathan laying down a trail of gasoline.  They barricade the doors and windows of the scrapped bus and wait until nightfall.  Up on the roof of the bus, Max apologizes to Lucas for being mean like her step-brother, but since her parents' divorce and her mother's decision to move to Indiana for a fresh start, she's been in a bad mood. \n"}, {"text": "Steve and the kids are able to lure the demogorgon to them.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe demogorgon eventually makes it to the junkyard and, with a loud shriek, it emerges from the fog in the distance.  It doesn't seem to take the bait though.  Steve realizes that the creature might be sick of cow meat and hands Dustin the lighter while he heads out with his bat to lure it closer.  It's a trap though. Lucas barely notices that more demogorgons wait off to the side, preparing to flank in from the right.  Steve barely makes it back into the bus where they can barricade themselves in.  But as one leaps onto the roof and prepares to jump in the hatch in the ceiling, something calls the creatures away. Steve realizes they're going somewhere. \n"}, {"text": "What is found by the soldiers at the spot Will specifies on his map?", "correct": "The graveyard", "options": ["The Upside-Down", "The nerve center", "The laboratory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe graveyard.\n\n\tIn the tunnels, the soldiers finally make it to the part of the labyrinth specified by Will on the map, and when they do they emerge into the part of the system that Hopper found himself in the previous day-- the room littered with bones.  The soldiers say there's nothing there, but it's clear there's something in the thick fog.\rIn his room, Will apologizes.  It made him do what he did.  Mike immediately realizes that the whole excursion was a trap but is unable to communicate down to the control room where, inside, Owens and Hopper watch as the soldiers are killed one by one by the demogorgons.  Will tells Joyce that they have to leave; the demogorgons are almost there.\rIn the control room, Hopper watches as the demogorgons ascend the elevator wires and emerge from the hole in the ground. \n"}]}
