The movie is a love story between two very different people and the animals in their lives.This movie was difficult to make, went way over budget, and was complicated by the fact that Grant was terrified of the leopard. One of the most significant scenes in the movie involved Cary Grant wearing a fancy woman's negligee. When he is asked why is wearing it he replies \"Because I just went gay all of a sudden!\" and jumps in the air.It is believed that this may be the first time this term was used as a slang for homosexuality, in a major motion picture. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following movies was the last film directed by Howard Hawks?", "correct": "Rio Lobo", "options": ["Bringing Up Baby", "The Air Circus", "Red Line 7000"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRio Lobo.\n\n\tFeaturing John Wayne and Jack Elam, \"Rio Lobo\" (1970) was Hawks last movie.

The other two movies were \"Rio Bravo\" (1959), and \"El Dorado\" (1966). All three films featured Hollywood icon John Wayne in the lead role.As he often did, Hawks filmed this movie in Panavision so that he could make the most out of background and show more details.
