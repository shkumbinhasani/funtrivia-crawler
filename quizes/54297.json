He has also directed episodes of several popular TV series, including 'Ally McBeal,' 'Providence,' and 'The Practice.' \n"}, {"text": "Who composed the score for 'Somewhere In Time'?", "correct": "John Barry", "options": ["Bill Conti", "Jerry Goldsmith", "John Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Barry.\n\n\tBarry has scored over a hundred motion pictures, including quite a few installments of the 'James Bond' series. \n"}, {"text": "The first scene of the film takes place just after the performance of a play written by Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve). What is the name of that play?", "correct": "'Too Much Spring'", "options": ["'Somewhere In Time'", "'Wisdom Of the Heart'", "'Bid Time Return'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Too Much Spring'.\n\n\tWe later see a framed program from this play stating that it premiered on May 19, 1972 at Millfield College. \n"}, {"text": "Blink and you miss it, but a supporting member of the 'ER' cast appears briefly in the scene described in the last question. Who is it?", "correct": "William H. Macy", "options": ["John Aylward", "Michael Ironside", "Frances Sternhagen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam H. Macy\n\n\tMacy, who played Dr. David Morgenstern on 'ER,' appears as a critic in the opening scene. He has no discernible lines, but is clearly identifiable as the guy with the red sweater tied around his neck, standing closest to Christopher Reeve. The closing credits of the film also state that 'Cheers' alum George Wendt is in the same scene somewhere, but I'm damned if I can spot him, and I've seen the movie at least 25 times! \n"}, {"text": "In the same scene, Richard introduces his girlfriend to someone in the crowd. What is his girlfriend's name?", "correct": "Shelly", "options": ["Elise", "Diane", "Deborah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShelly.\n\n\tWe're never told what became of Shelly, but when we next see Richard eight years later, he has just broken up with a different woman entirely. \n"}, {"text": "We see a number of different time periods throughout the movie. Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "1976", "options": ["1980", "1972", "1912"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1976.\n\n\tWhen we first see Richard and the 'old' Elise at Millfield College, it is 1972. When next we see Richard, a title card tells us that it is 'eight years later' -- the year that the film was released, 1980. He then travels to 1912. \n"}, {"text": "When Richard meets Elise McKenna for the first time (from his point of view, while he is still in college), she speaks exactly one sentence to him. What is it?", "correct": "come back to me", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ncome back to me.\n\n\tIt is also the only line spoken in the film by Susan French, who played the 'old' Elise. Coincidentally, French was born in 1912, the very year to which Richard Collier travels in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Richard, a Chicago native, winds up at the Grand Hotel (on Mackinac Island, Michigan) quite unintentionally. Where was he actually headed?", "correct": "He didn't have a set destination", "options": ["Dayton, Ohio", "Detroit, Michigan", "Albany, New York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe didn't have a set destination.\n\n\tRichard's agent asks him where he's going, and Richard responds with, 'I have no idea.' \n"}, {"text": "As Richard is driving out of Chicago, we can hear on his car radio a mention of a baseball game. Which teams are playing?", "correct": "The White Sox and the Yankees", "options": ["The Cubs and the Brewers", "The Cubs and the Mets", "The White Sox and the Tigers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe White Sox and the Yankees.\n\n\tRichard doesn't seem especially interested in the game. \n"}, {"text": "When Richard and Grand Hotel bellhop Arthur first meet (from Richard's point of view), how old is Arthur?", "correct": "75", "options": ["77", "70", "67"], "explanation": "\n\n\n75.\n\n\tArthur states that he was five years old when his father first took a job at the Grand Hotel in 1910. Since it's 1980 when this scene takes place, Arthur is 75. (One is forced to wonder why, after all those years, Arthur has risen only to the position of bellhop!) \n"}, {"text": "In a rather mystical moment, Richard seems to react to the 'presence' of Elise McKenna's framed portrait in the Grand Hotel's Hall of History before he actually sees it. What item is he looking at when this moment occurs?", "correct": "a framed newspaper article", "options": ["a photograph of the man who first owned the Grand Hotel", "a guest book from many years past", "a model of the Grand Hotel"], "explanation": "\n\n\na framed newspaper article.\n\n\tWe never get close enough to see the words of the article, but it's clearly framed on the wall in front of Richard as he stiffens and turns his head slowly to see the image of his true love for the first time. \n"}, {"text": "After Richard sees the picture of Elise, he has trouble concentrating on much of anything else, and even has trouble sleeping. When he awakes one night and checks his watch, what words can be seen on the t-shirt he's sleeping in?", "correct": "'Team Atlantic'", "options": ["'Millfield College'", "'Millfield Maulers'", "'Team Pacific'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Team Atlantic'.\n\n\tNo explanation is ever given for the t-shirt, an odd one for a Chicagoan to be wearing. Perhaps Richard got his graduate degree on the East coast? \n"}, {"text": "Tough one: What is the license plate of Richard's convertible?", "correct": "UV 9783", "options": ["VW 9873", "UV 9873", "VW 9783"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUV 9783.\n\n\tYeah, I know...that was kind of a mean question. Hey, sue me. =) \n"}, {"text": "Richard's research into the life of Elise McKenna eventually leads him to Laura Roberts, Elise's assistant at the time of her death. The actress playing Miss Roberts was previously featured in which Alfred Hitchcock film?", "correct": "'Shadow Of a Doubt'", "options": ["'Lifeboat'", "'Saboteur'", "'Suspicion'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Shadow Of a Doubt'.\n\n\tTeresa Wright starred opposite Joseph Cotten in 'Shadow Of a Doubt,' the film Hitchcock often named as his favorite among his works. It's a spectacular film -- go check it out! \n"}, {"text": "Another tough one. According to Richard's research, where was Elise McKenna born?", "correct": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "options": ["Los Angeles, California", "London, England", "Aberystwyth, Wales"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah.\n\n\tWe see a blurb VERY briefly in the theater magazine Richard finds at the local library that discloses this information. (But if she was born and raised in the U.S., why does Elise sound British...?) \n"}, {"text": "On what day was Elise McKenna born?", "correct": "November 11, 1885", "options": ["November 22, 1885", "November 22, 1890", "November 11, 1890"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNovember 11, 1885.\n\n\tAgain, we can see this information in the theater magazine Richard reads. This means, of course, that Elise was 86 the night she gave Richard the watch...and then, went home and died. \n"}, {"text": "Richard learns that Elise read 'Travels Through Time,' a book by his philosophy teacher in college, over and over. What was that teacher's name?", "correct": "Finney", "options": ["Sullivan", "McKay", "Flanagan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinney.\n\n\tThe book jacket lists him as 'G. Finney.' We never do learn what the 'G' stands for. It's been rumored that Richard Matheson (who wrote both the novel 'Bid Time Return' and the subsequent screenplay 'Somewhere In Time') named Finney after Jack Finney, the noted science fiction author who wrote, among other things, 'Time and Again,' a classic time travel yarn. \n"}, {"text": "When Richard asks his former teacher if time travel is possible, the teacher tells Richard that he once attempted to employ an autohypnotic technique to transport himself back to a certain year while he was in an old-style hotel in Venice. What year was this teacher's intended destination?", "correct": "1571", "options": ["1671", "1621", "1521"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1571.\n\n\tFinney visited the Hotel DelVecchio in 1971, and imagined himself traveling back 400 years. Did he actually get there? Finney remains unsure, much to Richard's consternation. \n"}, {"text": "Part of Richard's preparation for his trip through time is a haircut. Who cuts his hair?", "correct": "Richard does it himself", "options": ["the barber in the Grand Hotel", "Arthur, the bellhop", "a barber in town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard does it himself.\n\n\tRichard is more talented than I am -- the last time I tried to cut my own hair, a 911 call was necessary. \n"}, {"text": "Once properly dressed and coiffed for his trip to the past, Richard practices his intended first words to Elise McKenna in the mirror. What are they?", "correct": "'Good evening, Miss McKenna. You don't know me...but you will.'", "options": ["'Good evening, Miss McKenna. You have no idea how far I've come to be with you.'", "'Good evening, Miss McKenna. I'm Richard Collier. I believe you sent for me.'", "'Good evening, Miss McKenna. I believe this watch belongs to you.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Good evening, Miss McKenna. You don't know me...but you will.'\n\n\tRichard does not, in fact, say these words to Elise when he finally meets her in 1912. He does, however, say 'You have no idea how far I've come to be with you' during their first dance together, several hours after their first exchange. \n"}, {"text": "What room does Richard learn, via the dusty guest book he gains access to in the present (from his point of view), is 'supposed' to be his room number in the past?", "correct": "416", "options": ["316", "420", "320"], "explanation": "\n\n\n416.\n\n\tHe is almost accidentally given room 420 by the desk clerk, but a second clerk realizes at the last second that room 420 is actually reserved for someone else. Richard says 'Bingo!' when he gets the 'right' room, which thoroughly confuses the desk clerk. \n"}, {"text": "As Richard is trying to hypnotize himself into making the trip through time, he finds that an object in his room is impeding his progress, since it is a part of the modern world. What is it?", "correct": "a tape recorder", "options": ["a pop art painting", "an electric lamp", "a penny"], "explanation": "\n\n\na tape recorder.\n\n\tRichard initially records his autosuggestive commands and plays them back to himself over and over, not realizing that the recorder itself is a constant (if subconscious) reminder of the present. Once Richard shoves the tape recorder under the bed and simply speaks the suggestions to himself aloud, he is able to make the journey without incident. \n"}, {"text": "Our first hint that Richard has in fact succeeded in his journey to the past is a particular sound. What is it?", "correct": "the whinny and hoofsteps of a horse", "options": ["a town crier", "a barbershop quartet", "a dinner bell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe whinny and hoofsteps of a horse.\n\n\tIn an interesting parallel moment, when Richard later finds himself yanked back to the present, we hear the honking horn of a car. (Cars are not actually allowed on Mackinac Island...but hey, it's a movie.) \n"}, {"text": "An unforeseen problem with Richard's successful arrival in the past is that the room where he 'lands' is occupied. He is alerted to the presence of the half-dressed woman in the room by her impromptu singing. What song is she singing?", "correct": "'You Made Me Love You'", "options": ["'This Land Is Your Land'", "'Camptown Races'", "'I Love To Tell the Story'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'You Made Me Love You'.\n\n\tShe never sings any actual lyrics, but the melody is immediately recognizable to anyone who has heard the song. Another minor gaffe: it's 1912, but 'You Made Me Love You' wasn't popular until 1913, when it was performed by Al Jolson. \n"}, {"text": "My second 'Somewhere In Time' quiz will appear shortly -- we're not even halfway through the movie yet, after all! -- but in the meantime, a final question. As stated above, Richard Collier has arrived in a room that is *occupied* in the past. What are the names of the husband and wife staying in the room in question upon his arrival?", "correct": "Rollo and Maude", "options": ["Otto and Maude", "Otto and Claudia", "Rollo and Claudia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRollo and Maude.\n\n\tThey each call each other by name while Richard is hiding behind furniture, ducking into the closet, and trying desperately to get out of the room without being detected! \n"}]}
