{"id": "219454", "name": "The Adventures of Mrs. Pollifax Online Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors D-G", "G"], "questions": [{"text": "Mrs. Emily Pollifax's adventures begin in \"The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax,\" wherein she presents herself at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to apply for a job as a spy. Amazingly, they happen to need an innocent-looking courier just like her. Who is the man who hires her, and for whom she works for the rest of the series?", "correct": "Carstairs", "options": ["Mornajay", "Farrell", "Moneypenny"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarstairs.\n\n\tCarstairs and his estimable assistant, Bishop, appear in every book. They provide exposition as the missions unfold, increase tension as they fret about the impossible trouble in which Mrs. Pollifax invariably finds herself, and, last but not least, indulge in comic relief. Bishop's taste for chocolate eclairs is legendary, and in nearly every book Mrs. Pollifax's ingenious and lucky solution leaves them dazzled and confused.\r This meeting marks a turning point in Mrs. Pollifax's life. Before, she had been so bored and lonely as a widowed, pensioned mother of two grown children that she had considered suicide while watering her geraniums on the roof of her apartment building. After meeting Carstairs, her life gets a bit more interesting: in 14 books, the thought never crosses her mind again. \n"}, {"text": "Mrs. Pollifax's first mission takes her to Mexico City, where she is to collect some critical information compiled by an agent in Cuba. As usual, some powerful people (in this case Chinese communists) don't want to see this happen, and she and another CIA agent are kidnapped and transported to what poor nation in the Balkans?", "correct": "Albania", "options": ["Yugoslavia", "Greece", "Lithuania"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlbania.\n\n\tMrs. Pollifax first meets her fellow captive when she awakes from being drugged; they are bound back-to-back and she considers him rather disreputable. Luckily for her, this turns out to be the steadfast John Sebastian Farrell, a good friend who will turn up many more times throughout the series. On this occasion, however, he is injured soon after their capture, and it is up to Mrs. Pollifax to guide him and another mysterious captive through Albania (disguised as peasants) and into the Adriatic, where they are picked up by a Greek fishing vessel.Mrs. Pollifax's escapes are in many ways the espionage equivalent of Rube Goldberg devices. \n"}, {"text": "Luckily, Mrs. Pollifax manages to escape her first adventure, even inadvertently bringing back the desired microfilm. Where is the microfilm hidden?", "correct": "In a deck of cards", "options": ["On the size label of her shoes", "In a book of solitaire games", "On a map"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a deck of cards.\n\n\tIt's a good thing that Mrs. Pollifax likes to be prepared. Her contact is Se\u00f1or DeGamez, the proprietor of the Parrot Bookstore in Mexico City. She decides to check things out several days before the appointed rendezvous; he recognizes her and decides to give her the microfilm ahead of time, suspecting that his movements are being followed.He persuades her to buy a book explaining hundreds of solitaire games, and makes a gift of a deck of cards. In Albania, her captors go over the book from top to bottom looking for the microfilm, but they never think to examine the playing cards with which she's keeping herself occupied. \n"}, {"text": "After her successful first mission, it isn't long before the CIA calls on Mrs. Pollifax again. Her second adventure, chronicled in \"The Amazing Mrs. Pollifax,\" takes her to Turkey in search of whom or what?", "correct": "The spy Magda Ferenci-Sabo, defecting from the Communists", "options": ["A classified manuscript by Iraqi novelist Dib Assen", "A feared international assassin, code-named Aristotle", "The kidnapped son, Hafez, of the King of Zabya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe spy Magda Ferenci-Sabo, defecting from the Communists.\n\n\tAgents from all around the world are arriving in Istanbul to search for Ferenci-Sabo, who had gone to the British Consulate to seek asylum and then disappeared overnight. Most of them believe that she is a Communist spy, now defecting -- but Carstairs and the CIA know that she is actually a double agent, her true loyalty to the West, and they want to take care of her as one of their own. Naturally, this means sending the resourceful Mrs. Pollifax. \n"}, {"text": "In Istanbul, Mrs. Pollifax tracks down Colin Ramsay in order to deliver a message from his sister, her seatmate on the plane. He turns out to be a resourceful and reliable friend. How is this young British expatriate making his living in Turkey?", "correct": "By shooting documentary pictures for his uncle", "options": ["By translating ancient Turkish texts for archaeologists", "By waiting tables at a hip cafe", "By crafting elaborate wood inlays for tabletops"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy shooting documentary pictures for his uncle.\n\n\tHer seatmate on the airplane, a model, begs Mrs. Pollifax to deliver a ring to her brother; apparently they've made a game of trading it back and forth. Colin, 25, is in Turkey partly to flee the expectations of his family: the Ramsays' achievements have always been \"incredible\", and he doesn't feel up to snuff. His actions supporting Mrs. Pollifax in this caper, however, prove him to be pretty incredible after all. \n"}, {"text": "Mrs. Pollifax's superiors at the CIA have given her the number of one Dr. Henri Belleaux, an Istanbul academic who is highly trusted by the governments of both Turkey and the U.S. When Mrs. Pollifax visits his house to get help, however, she learns that he cannot be trusted. What tips her off that he's an enemy \"sleeper\"?", "correct": "There are two men drugging their kidnap victim in an upstairs bedroom.", "options": ["She finds the dead body of her co-agent in his garden.", "He attempts to kill Mrs. Pollifax.", "She overhears him plotting to overthrow the government."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThere are two men drugging their kidnap victim in an upstairs bedroom.\n\n\tMrs. Pollifax and Colin seek Dr. Belleaux's help at a desperate moment: her co-agent Henry has been murdered, and although they were able to find and briefly protect Magda, she's been kidnapped again. But when they arrive at his home, they discover that Magda's kidnappers are in an upstairs bedroom, drugging her.Not exactly what they'd expected in the home of such an upstanding man! They rescue Magda, but are pursued throughout Turkey by Dr. Belleaux and his henchmen; Mrs. Pollifax's instincts are right on target (as usual), and he is a Soviet sleeper sent to recover Magda and her information. And he doesn't particularly care what happens to the people trying to save her! \n"}, {"text": "Many near-misses and false starts later, Mrs. Pollifax, Colin Ramsay, and their traveling companions find themselves in hiding, trekking across the Turkish desert to an airport in the company and protection of what nomadic people?", "correct": "Gypsies (Rom)", "options": ["Bedouins (Bedu)", "Uighurs", "Huns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGypsies (Rom).\n\n\tMagda had befriended this troop of gypsies on her previous trips, and it is with them that she has left the treasure she won't leave Turkey without: her grandson, who also bears an amulet containing secrets on microfilm. Dr. Belleaux nearly manages to turn them against Mrs. Pollifax, but Anyeta Inglescu, the queen of the gypsy troop, meets with her and decides to trust her. On her subsequent adventures, Mrs. Pollifax often thinks back to the psychic gypsy queen who saved her life. \n"}, {"text": "We next find Mrs. Pollifax being sent to Bulgaria, an adventure described in \"The Elusive Mrs. Pollifax,\" in order to deliver a few items to a Bulgarian resistance group. What is she delivering?", "correct": "American passports", "options": ["Lawyers, guns and money", "Embarrassing information concerning a Bulgarian general", "Top-secret maps of the political prison, the Panchevsky Institute"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican passports.\n\n\tA few days earlier, members of this resistance group had saved the life of a CIA agent by alerting him that the secret police were onto him, and then smuggling him out of the country. All they ask in return is 8 U.S. passports, which Carstairs sends Mrs. Pollifax to deliver. Unbeknownst to her, the suits \"upstairs\" have also asked that she smuggle in several much more sensitive documents, which are furtively sewn into the lining of her coat. In Bulgaria, she is naturally quite surprised when a covert American agent repeatedly attempts to steal the coat to get the documents. \n"}, {"text": "Naturally, her seemingly simple Bulgarian mission quickly accumulates an impressive set of complications. Most urgent is the fate of one Philip Trenda, who had spoken to Mrs. Pollifax briefly in an airport and who has now been arrested by the secret police. Who is he?", "correct": "A young American tourist, son of a wealthy Bulgarian emigrant", "options": ["An elderly American tourist who knows a dark secret about a Bulgarian general", "A young American tourist who has spoken out against the oppressive Bulgarian regime", "A middle-aged American tourist who emigrated from Bulgaria decades previously"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA young American tourist, son of a wealthy Bulgarian emigrant.\n\n\tPhilip Trenda's father emigrated from Bulgaria with very little cash, but once in America he shortened his name (from Trendafilov) and became a very successful businessman. Now Philip is in trouble: on the orders of an ambitious general, he has been arrested so as to extract a substantial ransom from his father. And the general has no plans of releasing him alive after the money is delivered . . . \n"}, {"text": "No spy series would be complete without at least one impostor, and Mrs. Pollifax realizes that just such a man is posing as Philip when the Bulgarian police \"release\" him. She suspects that the conspiracy is even more insidious than she has realized. There's only one thing she can do now to help both Philip and the resistance group; what is it?", "correct": "She stages a massive jailbreak.", "options": ["She bribes a high government official to release Philip and stop pursuing the resistance group.", "She leads the members of the resistance in a revolution, after which they can release Philip at their leisure.", "She sets fire to the park outside the prison, destroying evidence leading to the resistance group and allowing Philip to escape in the confusion."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe stages a massive jailbreak.\n\n\tPhilip is being held at the Panchevsky Institute, a high-security prison for political offenders. Several members of the resistance movement are there as well. With the help of the resistance, and of Philip's aunt (who works in the kitchens of the Panchevsky Institute), Mrs. Pollifax plans an elaborate jailbreak, after which the American passports can be distributed to the various freed prisoners.\r I highly recommend the Mrs. Pollifax books; they may not be high literature but they're lots of fun. I hope you've enjoyed this quiz; thank you for playing! \n"}]}
