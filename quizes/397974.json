{"id": "397974", "name": "Long Time No See Quiz | Entertainment | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Entertainment by Themes"], "questions": [{"text": "It took more than fifty years before Ayn Rand's controversial novel was finally made into a trilogy of films in the 2010s.  Which of these works suffered production problems for years before appearing in theaters?", "correct": "Atlas Shrugged", "options": ["The Fountainhead", "We the Living", "Anthem"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtlas Shrugged.\n\n\tAlthough Ayn Rand's works have been popular for their political views and philosophical points, they've been divisive texts, and bringing any of them to the big screen in any way has always been a trying process.  \"Atlas Shrugged\" was originally shopped to studios in the early 1970s (the book released in 1957) but it languished time and time again because of the scope of the project and the inability for studios to latch onto casts and crews for any significant time. At points, Angelina Jolie, Anne Hathaway, and Julia Roberts were all up for the same role.  Ultimately, the book was adapted over three critically panned movies releasing between 2011 and 2014, each with different casts and directors. None of them made a profit. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these video games, in development for fifteen years (since the days of the Nintendo 64!), was regarded as dated by critics due to its misogynistic story, graphics, and sense of tedium?", "correct": "Duke Nukem Forever", "options": ["Ninja Gaiden", "Far Cry 5", "Sonic Unleashed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuke Nukem Forever.\n\n\tAlthough a lot of video games suffer poor reboots from generation to generation, \"Duke Nukem 64\", while obviously cheesy and dated in in its own right, was somewhat of a cult classic on the Nintendo 64 and definitely one of the few Mature-rated titles on the popular console.  It took fifteen years before fans got another taste, mostly due to internal conflicts (the game had half-a-dozen different development teams by the end) and game engine changes. What resulted was commonly regarded as a mess, both due to lousy controls and gameplay and offensive content.  Interestingly, many reviewers had to compare it to the original version on the PC and N64, stating that held up to that game, the new one was inferior despite the time gap. Ironically, the poor sales and release of \"Forever\" caused the final developers at Gearbox Software to shelve the series indefinitely. \n"}, {"text": "It took Stephen King twenty-two years to finish which series of seven books, commonly regarded as his magnum opus, and another thirteen for its first film adaptation?", "correct": "The Dark Tower", "options": ["The Stand", "The Shining", "It"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dark Tower.\n\n\tThere's a long story behind all of this.  Stephen King started his \"Dark Tower\" series in the early 1980s and the tone shifted as wildly as the page count.  By the time the fourth book, \"Wizard and Glass\", released in 1997, he'd gone through a lengthy period of drug addiction.  It wasn't until six years later that the fifth, sixth, and seventh books were released in quick succession to round out the series. He would release an eighth (between books 4 and 5) in 2012.  Many regarded \"The Dark Tower\" to be rife for adaptation, but for years and years, directors (J.J. Abrams, Ron Howard, etc.) and lead actors (Javier Bardem, Viggo Mortensen, ETC.) signed on without any result. Ultimately, the first shot at a film would show up in 2017 starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey.  It was critically-panned. \n"}, {"text": "It took thirty years for this sequel to arrive in theatres after its predecessor, but it ended up getting nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards despite the wait.  Which of these films could it be?", "correct": "Mad Max: Fury Road", "options": ["Blade Runner 2049", "Terminator Genisys", "Prometheus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMad Max: Fury Road.\n\n\t\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\", the third film in the Australian-made \"Mad Max\" series, was released in 1985, and \"Mad Max IV\" would have been released sooner if the script and production didn't fall into Development hell due to money issues, rights issues, and at one point, the September 11th attacks (which gutted the economy).  When Mel Gibson dropped out of the series, further delays were made. And then the Iraq War complicated things.  Locations weren't scouted until 2009, it never filmed until 2012, and the movie wasn't in theatres until 2015 due to extensive special effects work.  It paid off; the movie was critically lauded, made over $375,000,000 internationally, and won six of its ten Oscar nominations. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these hard rock albums, released in 2008, was put out by Guns 'N' Roses after fifteen years without an original music release?", "correct": "Chinese Democracy", "options": ["Death Magnetic", "Black Ice", "Fear of the Dark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChinese Democracy.\n\n\tIt's hard to figure out which element of \"Chinese Democracy's\" creation proved to be the most crippling.  After the release of both \"Use Your Illusion\" albums in 1991, Guns 'N' Roses had an album of covers before the band fell to pieces.  \"Chinese Democracy\" took fifteen years because most of the members of Guns 'N' Roses left (only Axl Rose and Dizzy Reed stayed with the name) and because it was re-recorded several times, ultimately costing more money to make than any rock album ever made (the final price tag was more than $13,000,000 USD in 2008).  Axl Rose would go on as a touring member of The Rolling Stones and AC/DC in the years to follow; Guns 'N' Roses would reunite in 2016 for a multi-year tour as well. \n"}, {"text": "Johnny Depp, John Hurt, Ewan McGregor, and Michael Palin were all attached in roles, bu it took nearly three decades for which of these Terry Gilliam films to make it to the big screen (without any of them)?", "correct": "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote", "options": ["Brazil", "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus", "The Brothers Grimm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote.\n\n\tThe interesting thing about this film's long and sordid creation process is that it was partially chronicled in a documentary.  In 2002, the film \"Lost in La Mancha\" took a closer look at the failure that was Gilliam's first attempt to bring his long-expected film to the big screen with Johnny Depp and Jean Rochefort. Ultimately, the film starred Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce.  The movie was expected to release in 2018 (a year earlier than it did), but it was marred by legal battles and studio issues; one producer took Gilliam to court, alleging that the rights to the film were his.  Nonetheless, it still debuted as the final film at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018.  It was nowhere near recouping its budget. \n"}, {"text": "Although originally planned to release on the PlayStation 3 in 2011, it took five years (nine from the start of development) for which of these fantasy video games to show up on the PlayStation 4?", "correct": "The Last Guardian", "options": ["Gears of War", "Planet Coaster", "Patapon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Last Guardian.\n\n\tThe follow-up to Team Ico's popular PS2 title \"Shadow of the Colossus\", \"The Last Guardian\" showed up at E3 in 2009 not appearing on a console for more than seven years due to technical issues and a need for a more robust development team.  As a result, Sony brought in their in-house team and pushed the release to the more powerful PS4, improving the graphics and art direction.  The game itself followed a boy and a fantastical winged creature known by the name Trico.  Though it sold less than anticipated, it was commonly regarded as a successful artistic endeavour. \n"}, {"text": "The Beach Boys released which of these collections in 2011, finally allowing fans to play songs from recording sessions held in the mid-1960s?", "correct": "The Smile Sessions", "options": ["Lost & Found", "The Pet Sounds Sessions", "The Capitol Years"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Smile Sessions.\n\n\t\"The Smile Sessions\" are particularly notable because the set contains songs that might have been used on the band's release that was meant to follow \"Pet Sounds\".  Over the years, however, they weren't released due to a general dissatisfaction with the end result, and it led Brian Wilson to release his own version of the album in 2004 (named \"Brian Wilson Presents Smile\").  Ultimately, Capitol Records dredged up the old recordings, releasing them both as a nineteen-track album and as a four hundred minute, comprehensive study, ultimately making one of the most universally high-regarded box sets in rock music. From the start of recording to the release of the set, forty-six years had passed. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Quentin Tarantino releases, originally written in 1998, was shelved for nearly a decade because an ending couldn't be decided on (though ultimately it ended with the death of Hitler)?", "correct": "Inglourious Basterds", "options": ["Once Upon a Time in Hollywood", "Django Unchained", "Pulp Fiction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInglourious Basterds.\n\n\tInstead of finishing his remake of the 1978 Italian film \"The Inglorious Bastards\", Tarantino moved onto both volumes of \"Kill Bill\" and the \"Grindhouse\" offering \"Death Proof\", returning to \"Inglourious Basterds\" in 2007 and filming for a 2009 release after mulling over the film's end (involving a major fire in a Parisian movie theatre and the untrue death of Adolf Hitler).  Multiple scripts were made over that time, and it probably worked out for the better in the end; Christoph Waltz got his first Oscar for his role in the film (he would get another for \"Django Unchained\") and the movie was nominated for seven more awards at the same ceremony (including Best Picture and Best Director). \n"}, {"text": "Although this Stephen King book appeared on shelves in 2009, he actually started it in 1972 as a book called \"The Cannibals\".  What was its title upon release?", "correct": "Under the Dome", "options": ["The Tommyknockers", "Revival", "The Outsider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnder the Dome.\n\n\t1972 pre-dates the majority of King's novels and, interestingly, \"The Cannibals\" took several forms before becoming \"Under the Dome\".  That said, the length of the book exploded; the manuscript for \"The Cannibals\" that showed up ten years after the first was more than four hundred pages (at a time when King had already released his first 1000-plus page novel, \"The Stand\").  \"Under the Dome\", on final release, capped out at 1,074 pages. The book followed the story of a small town that found itself trapped in an invisible dome.  It was only a short time before it became a TV show, so even if it took more than forty years to show up as a book, it seemed the ball was rolling when it finally published. \n"}]}
