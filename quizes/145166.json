(Hurry, there's not much time before the authorities get here. By the way, pleasure to meet you.) You look around, startled. A lady with long red hair and a yellow and red outfit walks into view. She is strikingly beautiful. She walks up to Scott and kisses him. This is the mutant known as....", "correct": "Jean Grey", "options": ["Marvel Person", "Mindtalker", "TeleGirl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJean Grey.\n\n\tJean Grey was the First mutant Professor X brought in.

On the way in, you saw a sign saying \"Professor Xavier's Insitute for Higher Learning\". As you walk out of the jet, you see a bald man in a hovering chair. A voice appears in your head, like before, saying (Welcome, I see you're admiring the school. Allow me to introduce myself. I am the founder of this school,...)", "correct": "Professor X", "options": ["Doctor X", "King X", "Mr X"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProfessor X.\n\n\tProfessor Charles Xavier, the most powerful mutant on the planet, has Telepathic abilities and is also the founder of the X-Men and all the X-Teams.

His motto, which he teaches to every mutant who comes into his school, is \"Never consider humans inferior\" \n"}, {"text": "As the professor leads you into the school, you see an African-American woman wearing a grey outfit with a cape get out of the  jet. There are heavy black clouds around and it looks like raining, but with a wave of her hand, she pushes the clouds away and the sun comes out. Scott says \"I don't believe you've met Ororo Munroe, also known as...\"", "correct": "Storm", "options": ["Weatherwoman", "Meteorologist", "Raindancer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStorm.\n\n\tOroro Munroe, played by Halle Berry in the movies.

She even lost her powers for a while after taking a mutant inhibitor meant for Rogue. \n"}, {"text": "As you walk into the school, there is a \"BAMF\" sound and a smell of Sulfur and Brimstone. A blue skinned demonic-looking man appears out of nothing, hanging upside down from a doorway. He speaks with a german accent. \"Ah, Professor, you have brought our new student here. Good to meet you, I am Kurt Wagner, also known as...\" ", "correct": "Nightcrawler", "options": ["Duskwalker", "Devilman", "Demonstalker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNightcrawler.\n\n\tNightcrawler is one of my favourite ever characters, due to the sheer irony of his character- He is a devout catholic, he has even trained for the priesthood, but he looks like a devil, and the sulfur and brimstone smell that accompanies his teleports are often associated with the devil. He was a circus acrobat before joining the X-Men, and he is incredibly acrobatic and agile. His power is the ability to teleport from one place to another. He can also disappear in shadows. \n"}, {"text": "After greeting Kurt, a five foot tall man with sideburns and two wickedly pointed hair spikes walks in. He wears a yellow costume with a mask hanging from the back of his neck. Removing a cigar from his mouth, he offers his hand, drawling \"Hey Bub, Good to meet yer. Name's Logan, but I'm known as...\"", "correct": "Wolverine", "options": ["Sabretooth", "Bobcat", "Wolfenstein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWolverine.\n\n\tWolvie, as he's affectionately known is a five foot tall, Canadian, muscular, stocky killing machine. He is quite possibly Marvel's most popular character. He's my favourite! His powers are a Mutant Healing factor, which allows him to heal from almost any wound instantly, bone claws which pop out from between his knuckles, and highly developed senses.He's tough, brave and lives by honour, as trained by the Samurai. He has been a Spy, a Soldier, a Samurai and a Science experiment. The Canadian government implanted the world's strongest metal, Adamantium, into him, covering all his bones, giving him an indestructible skeleton, and his bone claws become knives.He also had memory implants done, so he cannot remember too much about his past. It is this mystery and his eternal struggle against his animal nature which makes him so endearing to fans. His true age is also unknown, as his healing factor retards his aging. But it is known that he is over 100 years old. \n"}, {"text": "The professor says, \"Maybe one of you could show our young guest to his room? And afterwards, take him to the danger room and give him a training run?\". A young girl suddenly appears through a wall, running, saying, \"You called, professor?\". \"Yes, i did, Kitty. Maybe you could give our newest member here a tour?\" Professor X replied. \"Sure thing, Prof! Come on, let's go. My name's Kitty Pryde and I'm also known as...\"", "correct": "Shadowcat", "options": ["Catwoman", "Nightcat", "Darkcat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShadowcat.\n\n\tKitty Pryde joined the X-Men as a teenager, with the mutant ability to alter her molecular structure. This allows her to walk through anything and walk on air. She is also a highly trained martial artist and accomplished Genius. She was actually at Berkely College at the age of 16. She has a close bond with Wolverine. \n"}, {"text": "Kitty walks you down a hallway, saying \"Well, it's good to have you here! I'm taking you to the lab first, it's such a cool place! All the interesting gadgets and research going on there.\" As Kitty keeps talking, you see a beautiful blonde man down the hallway. He is tall, but the most striking feature of this man are the two wings that protrude from his back. He walks over, flashes a dazzling smile, and says \"Hello, how are you? My name is Warren Worthington III, otherwise known as...\"", "correct": "Angel", "options": ["Pilot", "Fly Guy", "Airman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAngel.\n\n\tWarren Worthington III, Angel, has also been called Archangel for a time, when he was evil and with Mr Sinister's team. But he was a founding member of the X-Men, along with Jean Grey, Cyclops, Beast and Iceman. He once commited suicide because he lost his wings in battle and felt that life was no longer worth living. He was brought back to life, and became Archangel. He has been involved with many women, but perhaps his most memorable relationship was with Bettsy Braddock, aka Psylocke. When mutants started mutating again, Angel found that he gained a new power, the power to heal people. \n"}, {"text": "You walk down another hall, and Kitty presses a button next to a door. The door opens, and there's an elevator. You get in, and the lift goes down several floors. You hop out when it stops, and walk into the hugest science lab you've ever seen, bigger than anything seen on TV or movies. Working at a desk is a blue furred animal looking humanoid, slightly bigger than a man. His body is insanely muscular and athletic. Suddenly, Kitty says \"Hi Hank! Meet our Newest member!\" The man turns around, and to your surprise, it's wearing glasses! \"Well, delighted to make your acquaintance. I was just working on a Molecular Transmitter. Oh, pardon me, I'm Dr Henry P. McCoy, people here call me Hank, or by my code name, which is....\"", "correct": "Beast", "options": ["Wildman", "Animal", "Bluewolf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeast.\n\n\tOne of the original X-Men, Beast wasn't always blue furred, he once tested one of his experiments on himself, which changed his appearance.

McCoy is also a worldwide recognised scientist, and is regularly in the lab working on something or other. He also cured the Legacy Virus. He has an on again/off again relationship with a reporter, Trish Tilby. \n"}, {"text": "After looking around the Lab for a while, Kitty decides that's enough, and leads you back to the elevator. You go upstairs and Kitty says \"I'll show you where the bedrooms are, I'm not sure where you'll be sleeping, but I'll show you the area where we all sleep.\" You walk into a really long hall with lots of doors. Out of one door a huge, muscular, tall man steps out. \"Hi Peter!\" Kitty exclaims, and you could swear she blushed when she saw him. The man smiles, and holds out his hand. His grip is surprising gentle for such a big man. Peter says in a gentle voice tinged with a russian accent, \"Hello Kitty. This gentleman with you must be our newest member. Hello, I am Pietor Rasputin, people call me Peter or by my code name, ....\"", "correct": "Colossus", "options": ["Monstrosity", "Hercules", "Giant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColossus.\n\n\tPietor Nikolayvich Rasputin is a Russian farmer who one day discovered he had the ability to turn his body into solid steel. He is incredibly poetic and gentle, and loves nothing more than doing farming work around the school. He once left the X-Men to join Magneto, but rejoined later on when he realised what he had done.He has a sister and a brother who both have mutant abilities, but he deeply regrets the death of his little sister, lilyana, which he believes is his fault. To \"redeem\" himself, even though everyone but him thought he had to redeem himself, he gave his life to cure the Legacy Virus, which was what killed his little sister.His death was a surprise to all of us, and he is sorely missed. \n"}, {"text": "After having a chat with Peter, Kitty leads you further down the hall, and a voice appears in your head. (Hello, Professor X here. Your room is on your right. You'll be sharing a room with someone who I think you'll like very much.) Kitty says, \"Got that? Ok, here's your room.\" You walk into the room and there's a blonde teenager typing on his computer. He looks up and sees you, flashes a grin and says in a Southern accent, \"Hey! I'm Sam Guthrie and I'll be your roommate! Did you have a good trip over? That Blackbird is a sweet ride, eh?\". He seems really enthusiastic and happy, and Kitty interrupts his talking to say \"Sam, you show our guest around, and take him to the danger room when you're finished.\" Turning to you, Kitty says \"Ok, it was great to meet you, we'll catch up later, ok? Have fun!\". Kitty turns around and walks through the wall, waving. Sam speaks up \"Ok, folks round here call me Sam, but my code name is...\"", "correct": "Cannonball", "options": ["Chatterbox", "Firefly", "Boomer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCannonball.\n\n\tSam Guthrie is a highly energetic, happy mutant. His powers are the ability to become a living rocket, and a force field that surrounds him when he flies. He was originally with the New Mutants before becoming a full member of the X-Men. He's from Kentucky, and very well liked among the team. (Thanks to savgmouse for the corrections!) \n"}, {"text": "While Sam is chatting away , he leads you to the kitchen, \"in case you get hungry\". Inside there's a man who pours some Pepsi into a glass and touches the glass and ice appears in the glass! Sam pipes up \"Hey Bobby, how you doing? We've got our newest recruit here.\" Bobby holds out a cold hand, saying \"Well, pleased to meet you. I'm Bobby Drake, but people call me...\"", "correct": "Iceman", "options": ["Blizzard Boy", "Snow Guy", "Cold Feller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIceman.\n\n\tIceman was one of the original X-Men, and has many powers relating to ice. He can shoot snow from his hands, turn things into ice, create ice shields, even manipulate the temperature of the area surrounding him. He's the joker of the pack, and up until recently, when his powers were acquired by someone else, he didn't even know how powerful he was. \n"}, {"text": "\"And here's the Danger room. You'll be doing a workout, soon as Remy finishes\". You stand and watch, as robots and holographic enemies surround a tall, lean man holding a long pole. He pulls some cards from his sleeve, and just holding them, they look like they're on fire, only the fire is dark pink. He throws the cards and each one of the three cards hits a different enemy, causing an explosion! He whips his stick around, hitting enemies, throws more cards and 5 minutes later, all the enemies have been beaten. Remy steps out of the room, and in a cajun accent, says \"Is that all there was?\". He walks over to you holding out his hand \"You're the new guy? Well, I'm Remy, but people call me....\"", "correct": "Gambit", "options": ["Cardman", "Joker", "Jack of Spades"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGambit.\n\n\tGambit is an ex-thief, and was once the leader of the Thieve's Guild. His past is surrounded in mystery, but he devotes his life to the X-Men, believing that the good he does will redeem his shady past. He's one of my favourite characters, by the way! \n"}, {"text": "Just before you go in, A woman's voice in a Mississipi accent says \"Hey Remy, have fun? Is that the new guy?\". You turn around, and a beautiful brunette with a white curl at the front holds out her hand, saying \"I'll be in there with you, just in case. I think you'll be fine, though.\" She's wearing a green bodysuit with yellow trim, and brown gloves. You walk into the Danger room, feeling a little scared. You look up, and see all the X-Men watching from the window. You feel a hand on your shoulder, and the woman says \"Don't worry about it. You'll be fine. By the way, My name's....\"", "correct": "Rogue", "options": ["Marvel Girl", "White Stripe", "Psylocke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRogue.\n\n\tRogue is perhaps one of the most mysterious of all x-men. Not much at all is known of her past, not even her real name is known (Despite the movie saying otherwise!). We do know that she is Nightcrawler's Stepsister and Mystique's foster daughter. She has the power to absorb mutant's powers temporarily and use them for herself. Once she absorbed so much of one mutant's powers she ended up keeping them, which were superstrength and the ability to fly. At some stage or another she has absorbed most of the X-Men's powers. \r Anyway, I hope you liked the tour, I wanted to put a few more characters in here but didn't have the room, i didn't think anyone would be able to put up with so many questions! \n"}]}
