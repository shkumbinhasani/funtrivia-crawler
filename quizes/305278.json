On the advertisement, the speaker says that with Dimoxinil, he can grow as little or as much hair as he wants. Of course, to get the free brochures, Homer needs to send five dollars to Hair City, Utah and the Dimoxinil Headquarters.  Homer heads upstairs and tosses out his ineffective hair growth products and the following day he heads to the Springfield Mall's Hair Clinic to pick up his six months-supply of Dimoxinil (with which he gets a free t-shirt).  When he realizes how much it is though, he is forced to leave it behind. \n"}, {"text": "Who suggests that Homer use the Nuclear Plant's money for the Dimoxinil?", "correct": "Lenny", "options": ["Karl", "Smithers", "Mr. Burns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLenny.\n\n\tAt work the next day, Homer complains that he'd get much more respect from people and work if he had more hair.  After lunch, Lenny states that Homer should just exaggerate on some of the plant's medical insurance forms and get the company to pay the thousand dollars required for the hair product.  Returning to the Hair Clinic, Homer says that he wants to go through with the medical forms. While the doctor is initially against it, he quickly turns on the radio and tells Homer to meet him in a nearby alleyway, alone.  Both swap what they have and Homer brings home the Dimoxinil to try that night.

He claims that no one on the floor has any reason to get promoted, but he points out Homer Simpson who Smithers notes looks more 'dynamic and resourceful' than he used to.  Mr. Burns quickly decides to promote Homer because of his look to Junior Executive.  While sorting through radioactive material, Homer is told via PA system that he will be assigned to a better job and that he has three minutes to say goodbye to his friends and colleagues before meeting Mr. Burns in a separate part of the plant. \n"}, {"text": "Homer hires the mysterious Karl as his secretary.

When he calls Marge, Homer tells her about the issue and she simply suggests he hire a qualified applicant. When Karl appears in the office, Marge, over the phone, says that he sounds good and to hire him.  After giving an enigmatic first impression, Karl is quickly given the job and the two of them go suit shopping.

While some of the board members suggest layoffs (to wake up the idiots) and adding caffeine to the water coolers in the break rooms, Mr. Burns says that he hired Homer to be more in touch with the average worker.  Homer goes onto a rant about the fish sticks in the plant cafeteria before mentioning a lack of tartar sauce per serving.  Mr. Smithers tries to cut Homer off, but Burns hears him out.  He approves of the idea and Homer's tartar sauce increase results in 15% more productivity and highly decreased accidents on the job.\rSmithers later deduces that the accidents that Homer would have done on the job accounted for the decrease in the job transfer.  As well, the output is equal to the productivity held when Homer was on his last vacation. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Burns, upon seeing the results of Homer's idea, gives him the key to which door?", "correct": "The Executive Washroom", "options": ["The Manager's Lounge", "The Employee Records Lounge", "The Core"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Executive Washroom.\n\n\tMr. Burns ignores Smithers' proof and decides to give Homer 'The Key' which allows entry to the plant's Executive Washroom.

He pays Smithers with a thousand dollar cheque and says that he will leave the job.  Smithers, who thought that he would be getting rid of Homer for good, is surprised by this.  When Homer asks why he did it, Karl admits that it was something he was born to do.  On the drive home, Homer comes to terms with losing Karl, but he remembers that he still has his hair, and in a sense, his power. \n"}, {"text": "Who accidentally destroys Homer's bottle full of Dimoxinil?", "correct": "Bart", "options": ["Marge", "Lisa", "Maggie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBart.\n\n\tShortly after Homer remembers he still has his hair, Bart enters his room, excited by the idea that he can grow his own beard with Dimoxinil.  He splashes a bit on his face as Homer walks in and catches him in the act, scaring him and making him drop the entire bottle.  Homer chases Bart around the house into the living room until he catches him and wrings the boy's neck. Bart gets out of it by feigning love for his father and Homer tells him that for the rest of his life, he'll be haunted by his father's failure, his crippling of the family, and the fact that he'll probably be bald in the future because of its hereditary nature.

He gives Homer the advise he needs in order to perform and sends him on his way with a smack on the behind.  When he hits the stage, Mr. Burns doesn't even recognize him without hair and the crowd soon thins out despite the important information he gives.  They reason that since he's bald, they shouldn't be told by him how to run the plant.  Smithers summons him to Mr. Burns' office.\rBurns suggests that he should fire Homer on the spot, but he decides to keep him in his old job because he also suffered from male-pattern baldness.  That night, Homer is worried about his condition, but Marge reminds him that the family still loves him and that he can provide for them.  She also says that she always loves him no matter if he's bald or not. \n"}]}
