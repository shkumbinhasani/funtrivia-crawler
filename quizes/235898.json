{"id": "235898", "name": "Spelling It Out - \"Banjo-Kazooie\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Banjo-Kazooie Games", "Banjo-Kazooie"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of the mole that teaches you techniques throughout the game?", "correct": "Bottles", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBottles.\n\n\tBottles is first met at Spiral Mountain and he has a molehill right outside Banjo's house.  It isn't discovered until \"Banjo-Tooie\" that Bottles has a home with his family in Jinjo Village.  Throughout this first adventure though, Bottles will appear in various worlds as a mentor who teaches the bear and bird how to make use of their skills and items.  Bottles will also record Note scores. \n"}, {"text": "Which item do you learn to use in Treasure Trove Cove?", "correct": "Red Feathers", "options": ["Gold Feathers", "Eggs", "Notes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed Feathers.\n\n\tIf you find Bottles on the crow's nest of the Salty Hippo in the second world, he'll teach you to use the Red Feathers and Flight Pad to fly.  The Gold Feathers are given the first time in Clanker's Cavern when you learn the Wonderwing.  The first time you use the Wading Boots will probably be in the waters of Bubblegloop Swamp, and the Turbo Shoes (aka Turbo Trainers) will likely be your final skill learned.  It's also the only skill learned in Gobi's Valley. \n"}, {"text": "Which character will only give you a Jiggy in the winter in Click Clock Wood?", "correct": "Eyrie", "options": ["Gobi", "Gnawty", "Nabnut"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEyrie.\n\n\tOver the seasons, you can watch Eyrie the eagle grow and change.

Nabnut will give you a Jiggy in autumn and Gobi helps you get a Jiggy (against his will) in summer and autumn.  Although you can help Gnawty in summer, you can't actually reach his Jiggy until autumn.  You can also claim it in winter. \n"}, {"text": "There are one hundred of which item in each stage?", "correct": "Notes", "options": ["Jiggies", "Eggs", "Mumbo Tokens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNotes.\n\n\tMusical Notes are used to open Note Doors which can be found in Grunty's Lair.
