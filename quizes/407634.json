Though they believed they wiped them from the planet, one emerges in the present day in what city?", "correct": "London", "options": ["Tokyo", "New York City", "Cairo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLondon.\n\n\t\"In the beginning, before the six Singularities and the dawn of creation, came the Celestials.  Arishem, the Prime Celestial, created the first sun and brought light into the universe.  Life began, and thrived.  All was in balance.  Until an unnatural species of predator emerged from deep space to feed on intelligent life-- they were known as Deviants.  The universe was plunged into chaos.  To restore the natural order, Arishem sent Eternals-- immortal heroes from the planet Olympia-- to eliminate the Deviants.  Eternals had unyielding faith to Arishem until one mission, led by the Prime Eternal, Ajak, changed everything...\"\r As their starship travels around the sun, the Eternals awaken and prepare themselves for their mission.  Meeting each other for the first time, they gaze upon Earth in the year 5000 BC and then descend to the surface, landing in Mesopotamia to save early civilization from otherworldly beings that emerge from the sea.  It is from this first contact that they remain on the planet to protect its people.\r In London in the present day, Sersi heads to the Natural History Museum, arriving late for her lecture, one that boyfriend Dane has been heading in her absence.  She dives into her discussion on apex predators as an earthquake tears, unexpectedly, through the city.  That night, while she celebrates Dane's birthday, something emerges from the Thames.  She, of course, has no choice but to reveal her true nature to him when she and her fellow Eternal, Sprite, need to use their powers to stop the Deviant.  Ikaris, fortunately, is nearby to assist before the Deviant escapes back into the river. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these inventions, created by Phastos, did the Eternals bestow upon humanity when they protected the city of Babylon?", "correct": "The plough", "options": ["The wheel", "The steam engine", "The typewriter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe plough.\n\n\tSersi reveals everything to Dane, explaining it was never their mission to protect humanity from anything save for Deviants.  Though they believed they wiped the Deviants out centuries ago, they've been waiting even longer for word from the Celestials that they could return home.  Sersi and Dane part ways; it's clear they can't be together forever.\r Sersi, Sprite, and Ikaris theorize that something is happening to Earth.  The planet-wide quake and the Deviant, able to heal itself and target the Eternals, is an aberrance and a sign of something terrible.  They realize they need to find the others and bring them back into the fold, even though they haven't spoken in centuries.  They elect to visit Ajak first; she'll know what to do.\r It was in the year 575 BC in Babylon that Ajak spoke with Arishem of the Eternals' successes.  She was told, then, not to grow attached to Earth.  It was Arishem's insistence that they focus solely on the mission.  Nonetheless, the Eternals operated as they willed, introducing critical inventions and telling stories to advance civilization from within while also living their own lives.  It was then that Ikaris expressed his love for Sersi and the two commenced a romance for the ages.  In the year 400 AD, in the Gupta Empire, Ikaris and Sersei would be married in a traditional human ceremony with the other Eternals watching on. \n"}, {"text": "In the event of Ajak's passing, who bears the responsibility of speaking directly with Arishem?", "correct": "Sersi", "options": ["Ikaris", "Thena", "Sprite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSersi.\n\n\tTravelling to South Dakota at the onset of a coming storm, Sersi, Ikaris, and Sprite arrive at Ajak's home to find their fellow Eternal having already been attacked and killed by a Deviant.  It's the first time in seven thousand years that an Eternal has died fighting the enemy.  While Sersi mourns over her body, the Celestial sphere inside of Ajak emerges from the fallen Eternal and places itself into Sersi, granting her the ability to speak directly to Arishem on Ajak's wishes.  She is warned: it is almost time.\r In the year 1521 AD, in the city of Tenochtitlan, the Eternals faced their final major battle before the pyramids there.  They believed this to be the final wave.  While a war raged around them, the Eternals argued about the advances of humanity and Thena, before their eyes, succumbed to Mahd Wy'ry, a condition that caused her to retaliate against her fellow companions, nearly killing them.  Once the dust settled and Thena reverted to her normal self, Ajak concluded that the only way to avoid recurring episodes would be to bring her back to the ship and use their technology to wipe her mind, freeing her from the burden of past memory that caused the affliction.  The Eternals chose to let Thena keep her memories with Gilgamesh electing to protect her.  Ajak, acting as leader, let the Eternals stand down and find their own purposes; with the Deviants gone, there would be nothing else they needed to do.  And when they reunited somewhere down the line, they could tell her about the things they found. \n"}, {"text": "Kingo, now a movie star, works in which country?", "correct": "India", "options": ["The United Kingdom", "The United States", "Uganda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndia.\n\n\tIn Mumbai, India, Kingo performs in a Bollywood performance (of 'The Legend of Ikaris') while Sersi, Sprite, and Ikaris watch on.  He only takes their arrival seriously when they reveal Ajak's death to him.  It's fortunate for Kingo; he's able to use his private jet to fly the others to reunite with the other Eternals and, using his valet, film a documentary about the group.\r When the plane arrives in Australia, the Eternals find more Deviants in the Outback surrounding Gilgamesh and Thena's residence.  The news of Ajak's death is shocking, but Thena has already been shaken by the Deviants' return; it takes reminders, illusions, and fighting to bring her back to her normal self from her most recent episode.\r Over dinner, the six reunited Eternals (and Kingo's valet, Karun), laugh and joke about their circumstances and the state of the world.  Sersi, distracted, leaves them be.  She speaks to Gilgamesh about Centuri-Six, a planet Thena spoke of, destroyed in a cataclysmic event, and they draw parallels to the events starting to occur on Earth.  The problem is that Sersi can't figure out how to speak to Arishem with the new abilities granted to her.  Gilgamesh suggests that maybe she's trying to hard and that all she needs to do is listen. \n"}, {"text": "Arishem planted the seed for which Celestial within the Earth?", "correct": "Tiamut", "options": ["Eson", "Ashema", "Valknar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTiamut.\n\n\tWith Gilgamesh's advice, Sersi is finally able to reach Arishem and inform the Celestial of Ajak's death and the reappearance of the Deviants which, per the encounter in London, seem to have obtained Ajak's healing powers.  Arishem claims this to be a side effect of the Emergence, the true purpose of the Eternals' mission on Earth: to bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.\r Every billion years, new Celestials must be born.  Arishem plants Celestial seeds into host planets across the universe and Earth was chosen to host Tiamut, deep in the planet's core.  To grow, a Celestial seed requires vast amounts of energy derived from intelligent life, and once the planet reaches the population threshold, as it did when the Blip was reversed by the Avengers, the Celestial within becomes ready to emerge.  The Eternals, sent to destroy the Deviants, did so to prevent human life from being culled by this outside force (thus stopping Tiamut's growth).  Though it will cause the destruction of the planet and the end of the human race, it was always the plan.  The end of one life is the beginning of another, Arishem explains.  The universe is a cycle of creation and destruction.  The Celestials create suns to make new galaxies and continue this necessary process; without it, the universe would darken and die.\r The Eternals have done this before, as Sersi discovers.  Arishem planted memories of their home planet, Olympia, but in truth they were created by Arishem in the World Forge and their memories were erased, planet after planet, as they completed their tasks.\r Arishem also created the Deviants to serve the purpose of protecting the worlds, but there was a flaw in their creation that allowed them to evolve as predators; he created the Eternals to be incapable of evolution to remedy that mistake.  Arishem asks Sersi, as the new Prime Eternal, not to fail. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the Eternals is killed by the Deviants during their fight in the Amazon?", "correct": "Gilgamesh", "options": ["Druig", "Phastos", "Makkari"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGilgamesh.\n\n\tSersi reveals the truth to her fellow Eternals and believes that they have to stop the Emergence; if they can delay Tiamut's birth, they can protect Earth for just a bit longer.  Their first step is to head to the Amazon Jungle to search for Druig who, taking care of a remote Amazonian tribe, welcomes his former companions in to argue with them.\r While the group ponders the sides they must take as the Emergence draws closer, Sersi asks Ikaris why they separated.  Their conversation is interrupted, however, when the Deviants ambush the village and force the Eternals into action.  As Ikaris encounters a Deviant he feels he's fought before, Gilgamesh steps in to fight and Thena, overcome by memories, has another bout of Mahd Wy'ry that causes her to lash out against her fellow Eternals.  Only Gilgamesh is able to calm her.\r During the battle, Sersi finds that she is able to manipulate a Deviant into a new shape and form to protect herself, something she was never able to do before as her powers only allowed he to transform in-organic things.  While she and the others quell the beasts in the village, Thena struggles to keep herself conscious.  She's powerless to help as Gilgamesh is killed by the Deviant in his presence.  It takes his powers and memories and takes on a new form, vowing to kill them all for what the Celestials have done to its kind.\r After Gilgamesh succumbs to his wounds, the Eternals bid him farewell, his body is burned on a pyre, and Thena spreads his ashes in the Amazon. \n"}, {"text": "Phastos lost his faith in humanity when which watershed moment in history occurred?", "correct": "The bombing of Hiroshima", "options": ["The Vietnam War", "9/11", "The Crusades"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bombing of Hiroshima.\n\n\tAs the Eternals depart from the Amazon, Sersi and Druig consider the possibility of using Druig's mind control powers to prevent Tiamut from causing the Emergence, but his power doesn't seem great enough.  Sersi realizes that, perhaps, the only way to solve their problem is to find Phastos, though she's reminded that he gave up on humans long ago.\r In 1945, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Phastos visited the blast site and came to terms with the fact that his technology led to such devastation.  There, he confided in Ajak that humanity, perhaps, wasn't worth saving, just like Druig insisted.\r Sersi and Ikaris reunite with Phastos at his suburban home and brief him on their findings.  It takes Phastos' husband, David, to convince him that he needs to do what he can to save their son.  It's the only reason he follows the Eternals to an archaeological dig in Iraq, formerly Babylon, and the spot where they hid away their spaceship, the Domo.  It's there that they find Makkari, still waiting to go home and having hidden there for centuries with a chamber of books and cultural artifacts.\r Returning to his lab on the Domo, Phastos theorizes that if, like the Deviants, they can pull energy from each other, they can form a powerful collective force (which he coins a 'Uni-Mind') that can, potentially, power one of them up enough to stop the Emergence.  With that, they can buy time to solve the issue set in front of humanity.  They leave the ruling to Sersi.  After all, Ajak chose her to lead. \n"}, {"text": "The point of Emergence, as Makkari discovers, is where on Earth?", "correct": "A volcano", "options": ["A city", "A sinkhole", "A canyon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA volcano.\n\n\tIt becomes eminently clear that the Eternals don't have a unified stance on what to do about the Emergence, especially with the haughty choice between protecting the Earth and protecting the Universe.\r Six days earlier, in South Dakota, Ikaris spoke to Ajak and learned that the Emergence, an event he learned of years before (leading him to separate from Sersi to hide the truth) would only be a week away.  Ajak suggested they tell Sersi to give them all a chance to save humanity; she began to doubt Arishem's mission when she lived amongst humankind, seeing what they could do in times of duress.  When humanity brought themselves back from the Blip with the snap of a finger, she was inspired by their resilience.  The cost of Arishem's design wasn't worth it.\r Unfortunately, Ikaris disagreed with her.  Though she insisted they bring the team back together, he brought her to Alaska and showed her the first sign of the Deviants' return in their being thawed from the deep ice.  And though he was loyal to Ajak for so long, he couldn't let her defy Arishem.  It was he who let the Deviants kill her, allowing them to absorb her power before taking her body back to South Dakota to be found.  He didn't know it would allow the Deviants to evolve and that he would encounter them again in the Amazon.\r There is too little time to get all the answers.  In the Domo, Sersi feels the beginning of the Emergence and warns the others.  Makkari uses her speed to rush around the globe searching for the site of the Emergence, determining it to be in an Indian Ocean volcano.  Ikaris, to the shock of the others, reveals that he knew the truth all along; he simply wanted to protect the others from the Deviants but let the Emergence proceed as planned.  He admits to killing Ajak, further dividing the group.  Only Sprite sides with him as they depart while Kingo, unable to make a decision about who to help, heads out on his own. \n"}, {"text": "The Emergence is stopped when Sersi turns the Celestial rising from the Earth into what substance?", "correct": "Marble", "options": ["Water", "Rose petals", "Sand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarble.\n\n\tWhen Phastos discovers that Sersi has the power to change Deviants, it appears that they have a backup plan.  It takes Thena's words to convince Sersi that Ajak's bestowed gift was meant for her.  After all, Sersi has always loved humankind, and as Gilgamesh told her, \"you protect the ones you love; it is the easiest thing to do.\"  Phastos removes Ajak's stone from Sersi's body in an attempt to repurpose it for the Uni-Mind, and when he succeeds they depart for the Indian Ocean.\r They fly to the point of Emergence to find Ikaris and Sprite already waiting for them.  While Thena holds off Ikaris in the Domo, the rest align their powers with the Uni-Mind, feeding them into Druig, and starting the process of quelling the eruption at hand.  Ikaris realizes their plan quickly, stopping them and grounding the ship, and this commences a massive eruption as Tiamut awakens.  Sersi realizes that she must try to stop this herself as she asks the others to keep Ikaris occupied.  They don't realize as the Deviants appear from the ocean to intervene.\r While Thena takes on the leader of the Deviants and wins, succumbing once more to Mahd Wy'ry but using Gilgamesh's voice to bring her back to sanity, Phastos is able to keep Ikaris bound by the beach.  It allows Sersi to advance to the volcano where, encountering an apparition of Ajak, she's stabbed in the back by Sprite, who claims she was always envious of her fellow Eternal for being able to live as one of the humans as she never could.  Now, she claims, they can start over wherever Arishem sends them next.  Druig, coming to, manages to knock out Sprite, allowing Sersi to turn her weapon to water and continue up the peak.\r As the Emergence begins to create tsunamis and cause the Earth to heave around the volcano, Tiamut starts to rise from the sea.  The ground gives away beneath Sersi as she realizes what she can do and, reaching down, she begins to transform Tiamut into marble.\r Though Ikaris breaks free from his bindings and rushes to stop Sersi, he changes his mind when he looks down and recalls his love for her.  He joins the other Eternals in empowering the Uni-Mind and, with their strength combined, Tiamat is frozen in place.  The Emergence is stopped. \n"}, {"text": "Who of these Eternals is not claimed by Areshim to determine if humanity survives the Celestials' final judgment?", "correct": "Ikaris", "options": ["Sersi", "Phastos", "Kingo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIkaris.\n\n\tWhen the Emergence ceases, Ikaris apologizes to Sersi for his actions, before flying into space.  He gazes back towards Earth before leaving it entirely, plunging himself into the Sun.\r The Eternals discover that they only survived by connecting to Tiamut, in the Uni-Mind, as it emerged from the planet.  By using Tiamut's power with their own, they were able to stop the Emergence.\r Sprite, emerging worse for wear with her own plans foiled and with Ikaris having left, is told by Sersi that there might be another option for her.  If she wishes for the humanity she seeks, they can use the energy of the Uni-Mind to strip her of her immortality.  It's a choice that she doesn't think twice about.\r Two weeks later, at Ajak's home in South Dakota, the Eternals prepare for the next phase of their lives.  Druig and Makkara join Thena in returning to the Domo and heading out into space.  Their goal is to search for other planets and tell other Eternals the truth about their natures.\r In London, Sersi and Kingo send Sprite off to school to live her new life.  Sersi can only wonder if they did the right thing; Kingo insists that she did because she followed her heart.  Sersi is met by Dane and the two chat over a stroll through the park.  She knows that she can't pretend to be human anymore and he vows that he doesn't care what she is, Eternal or not.  He does have a secret to reveal, however, about his family history.  His opportunity to tell her is cut short, though, when Arishem heads to Earth and plucks her, Kingo, and Phastos from the planet.  They stand accused of destroying a Celestial for the people of Earth, and only their memories will determine if humanity is worthy of being destroyed as a result.  He vanishes, with the trio, into a singularity. \n"}]}
