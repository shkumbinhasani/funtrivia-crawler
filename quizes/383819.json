{"id": "383819", "name": "\"The Original\" Quiz | Westworld - Season 1 (The Maze) | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Westworld", "Season 1 ("], "questions": [{"text": "How do Newcomers arrive in Westworld?", "correct": "By train", "options": ["By elevator", "By boat", "By horse and carriage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy train.\n\n\tA woman, Dolores, sits naked in a stark chamber.  A fly walks across her left eye and she's asked if she's ever questioned her reality.  She has not.\rDolores would go about her days appreciating the natural splendour, and treating Newcomers with respect.  After all, at one point, everyone was new to the world.\r A train of Newcomers arrives at the station and eager Newcomers make their way to the platform, finding their freedom in a western-era locale.  They all paid a lot of money to be there; the immersion is immense.\r A man arrives at the local saloon, quickly grabbing a drink and meeting with the local prostitutes.  He's not interested in their immediate gratification though.  When he spies the beautiful Dolores leaving a shop outside, his attention is drawn and he follows her, helping her with her horse.  They've met before; he came back.  He grabs his horse and follows her across the landscape, back to her house. \n"}, {"text": "Teddy, as it is discovered, is a citizen of Westworld.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDolores and the man, Teddy, return to her house by nightfall and are surprised by the sound of bandits on her homestead.  A man stands over Dolores' father and shoots him; he's already killed her mother.  They don't realize Teddy behind them, and he fires shots at them when they don't expect it.  They're not alone though; a man in black approaches as Dolores cries over her father's body and laughs that she doesn't recognize him, even after thirty years of visits.  He also recognizes Teddy, and wonders why the powers that be have paired them off.  Teddy pulls his gun for a stand-off, but the bullets don't work on the mysterious man in black.  Despite all efforts, the man in black drags Dolores away and shoots Teddy in the chest, leaving him to die.  He paid, after all.\r Dolores is asked if anything would change about her views of the Newcomers, considering what she was told.  She says no.  Everyone, she says, loves the Newcomers. \n"}, {"text": "What name is given by Westworld programmers to the artificial beings in the park?", "correct": "Hosts", "options": ["Androids", "Placeholders", "Townsfolk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHosts.\n\n\tA new day begins in Westworld.  Dolores wakes up in bed.  Teddy wakes up on the train, coasting through the arid landscape outside town.\r Elsewhere, a futuristic laboratory continues work on androids; animals and people.  Two scientists watch an anomaly; a prostitute android is brought in for observation and they spot something-- a small finger movement-- that isn't in the original code for her programming.  It must've been Dr. Ford, they posit, since the action would be derived from the internal memory of the android which, while purged at the end of every day, may still be lingering, only slightly, to allow these unique subtleties to bleed through.\r The head programmer is called away.  A host in cold storage is acting restless, and the security team fears a critical failure.  The problem is, the hosts aren't updated in cold storage.  Nonetheless, the security head dons his heavy armour..and gun. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the second android ever created for Westworld?", "correct": "Old Bill", "options": ["Lazy Joe", "Steely Dan", "Tex"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOld Bill.\n\n\tCold storage, a lengthy elevator ride into the basements, is flooded due to a faulty cooling system, and the head programmer, Bernard, is told to stay back while the security team advances.  They enter the storage room to find countless of decommissioned hosts standing in uniform lines.  In the back of the room they find Dr. Ford, the owner of Westworld, speaking to Old Bill, one of the oldest hosts in the line, over a drink.  Bernard compliments Ford on the new gestures in the hosts as Bill puts himself way.\r Dolores heads out to town; Teddy disembarks from the train.  He spots her from the window of the saloon.  He doesn't help her today; he's taken aside by a group of Newcomers looking for a tour.  When she drops a can from her bag, Dolores is instead greeted by the man in black who, confusingly to her, says he can't stop by in the evening since he has plans.  She carries on with her day. \n"}, {"text": "Bernard suggests that two hundred androids have received their latest update in the field.  This is equivalent to what percent of all Westworld denizens?", "correct": "10%", "options": ["100%", "40%", "2%"], "explanation": "\n\n\n10%.\n\n\tA man and his wife take up the local sheriff on an offer to search for a murderer holed up in the local mountains.  When they find his latest victims, the Newcomer asks how long they'll take and doesn't get too much of a response.  The host starts to malfunction, unable to comprehend or speak.\r In the labs, Bernard has a full diagnostic performed on the host due to its aberrant behaviour.  Unfortunately, it's not yet possible to determine if the latest update to the hosts is responsible, though the update was performed on 10% (or two hundred hosts) of the Westworld population.  It's suggested that they pull all of them for examination, despite this being a major strain on the innumerable interconnected storylines constantly running in the park.  Bernard says that the damaged host's core code is intact; he literally can't hurt a fly. \n"}, {"text": "What does Dolores' father find in the soil near his livestock pen?", "correct": "A photograph", "options": ["A newspaper", "A flash drive", "A foot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA photograph.\n\n\tTeddy brings his group of Newcomers out to a house in the middle of canyon country.  While they romp about with the local prostitutes, they discuss what comes next-- they can follow him to the next level of the adventure or, if they want, just take him out to the canyon to shoot him.  Teddy sits outside; it's not clear if he hears.  A fly lands on his face and he pays no attention.\r Dolores, with her day free, heads down to the river to paint the horses.  A family of Newcomers passes by and she introduces them to the local animals.  A small boy suggests that she's \"one of them\", and that she's \"not real\".  She suggests they get back before dark; there's bandits in the hills.\r Out at the ranch, Dolores' father finds something hidden in the soil next to a pen.  When Dolores gets home, they look at it together; it's a picture of a woman in a futuristic, urban environment.  Neither can make heads or tails of it. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name given to the additional code placed into the programming by Dr. Ford?", "correct": "Reveries", "options": ["Memories", "Stimuli", "Tweaks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReveries.\n\n\tSome of the workers overseeing Westworld concern themselves with the updates being performed on the hosts.  Perhaps, they think, the hosts could stand to be a little less lifelike to remind visitors that they aren't completely real people; the lines are almost blurring.  This would also allow for faster rollout on new hosts.\r Nightfall comes to Westworld and the staff of the local saloon packs it in.  As the croupier leaves the bar out the back door, he's followed and murdered by the man in black.\r Bernard is called aside after finishing work on the sheriff.  Something major is happening in the park.\r A host named Walter has shot and killed numerous patrons of a saloon, terrorizing the guests inside.  As he pours milk on all of the bodies in the building, he makes it outside to one final corpse before he's stopped altogether.  The Westworld security team and Bernard have arrived to take stock and perform damage control.  Bernard tells them that Walter has turned on people before...by design...and it's likely an issue with the recent update, so there should be nothing to worry about if they roll back the programming on the 10%.  The hosts, however, don't seem to be staying in their loops.\r Bernard is forced to talk to Dr. Ford about the issue, and both discuss the Reveries placed into the code, since they may be what's causing the issues.  Ford claims that evolution is only natural.  The mistakes occasionally need to be indulged. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the outlaw who brings his band into town in an impromptu storyline?", "correct": "Hector", "options": ["Mick", "Lee", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHector.\n\n\tThe croupier wakes up in the canyons; the man in black has removed all but three litres of the host's blood, and he needs answers.  The croupier (Kissy, as he's known), stumbles to the edge of a cliff, before the man in black tells him that it's time to dig deeper and reach the next level.  He begins to scalp the host.\r Dolores wakes up and begins her day.  Oddly, her father is still in his seat from the previous night, mumbling about the photograph and questions he can't ask or answer.  He urges her to leave, since Hell and all of its Devils are here, with them, and he whispers in her ear.  Dolores yells for her mother and rides off to get a doctor.\r Reaching the doctor's office in town, Dolores finds the building locked up.  Teddy spies her from the saloon and the two embrace-- he came back, after all.  At the same time, a group of hooded figures ride into town on horseback.  A new narrative has been formed to compensate for the significant lessening of hosts in the field, and a dark figure known as Hector-- the man in the mountains-- is arriving a week early to spark a storyline.  He does.  In a bloodbath.\r Hector breaks into the saloon to take hostages while his band shoots all passers-by, including Teddy, who dies in the street as Dolores watches. \n"}, {"text": "What phrase is used to deactivate the park's androids?", "correct": "'a deep and dreamless slumber'", "options": ["'the time to rest is now'", "'a verdant meadow'", "'enter sandman'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'a deep and dreamless slumber'.\n\n\tHector's group grabs a safe from the top floor of the saloon and pulls off the heist with minimal effort; a horse pulls the safe out of town; his crew stands on the front patio of the building.  He's taken aback, however, when he's shot in the neck and killed by a Newcomer who, pulling out his gun, and with his wife behind him, is simply ecstatic with his experience.  Lee, the park's creative director, is severely disappointed, watching from the labs.\r Dolores sobs as Teddy bleeds out in the street.  She knows their paths are bound together.\r That night, the tourists take photos with the bodies of the bandits.  One of Bernard's programmers finds Dolores, still waiting over Teddy's body, and tells her that she will fall into 'a deep and dreamless slumber', deactivating her.\r In the labs, Bernard states that one host was definitely out of sorta, though most of the rest were perfectly fine.  The problematic host is Dolores.  When she's brought online, Ashley, the security head, is brought in to interrogate her, specifically about her reality and her father.  The picture is discussed, but she says it did not look like anything to her. \n"}, {"text": "Oddly, Dolores' father, recalling old coding, is able to recite which of these?", "correct": "Shakespeare quotes", "options": ["Movie scripts", "Beat poetry", "Pop song lyrics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShakespeare quotes.\n\n\tFull diagnostics are performed on the hosts and Dr. Ford is brought in to speak to Dolores' father who, still, shows issues.  Ford has the host re-access his old configuration, but as soon as Dolores is brought up, he slips back into his problematic state.  Mr. Abernathy is distraught, and still feels he needs to warn his daughter.  Dr. Ford asks the host to access his current build, but the host affirms that it is his goal to meet his maker...perhaps to enact revenge.  After shutting down the host, Bernard says that before the android played Mr. Abernathy, he was a sheriff in Westworld and a cultist in a horror narrative known as 'The Dinner Party' where, amongst other things, he quoted Shakespeare and other great poets.  While Abernathy's odd comments to Dr. Ford were off-script for Dolores' father, they fit for his original programming.  Fragments of prior builds are slipping through, likely because of the Reveries.\r Ashley asks Dolores what her father whispered to her.  He said: \"These violent delights have violent ends.\"  It means nothing to her.  Ashley asks if she's ever lied.  She says \"no.\"  He then asks if she'd ever hurt a living thing.  \"No,\" she says.  \"Of course not.\"  Ashley tells his assistant that Dolores is the oldest host in the park, and despite frequent updates, is basically as good as a new host.\r Mr. Abernathy is not repaired.  He's replaced by another host and placed into the cooling storage areas in the basements of the lab.\r In the desert, the man in black carries Kissy's scalp, inside of which is a maze-like image.\r Teddy awakens on the train into town.\r Dolores wakes up in bed.  She heads to the patio and her father, now a new host, awaits her.  As she admires the beauty of her surroundings, a fly lands on her neck.  She swats and kills it. \n"}]}
