It is made from me!  It's got peanut butter cups and fudge in it, or so the packaging says.  I think it's really pieces of moose in there!\n\nWhat flavor of ice cream might this be?", "correct": "Moose Tracks", "options": ["Moose Prints", "Moose Trails", "Moose Hooves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoose Tracks.\n\n\tMoose Tracks is a popular flavor of ice cream, made of vanilla ice cream with peanut butter cups and \"Moose Tracks fudge\".  There are also several different variations of Moose Tracks ice cream.  Extreme moose tracks is chocolate ice cream with fudge cups and Moose Tracks fudge.  Mint Moose Tracks is chocolate ice cream with mint cups and Moose Tracks fudge. \n"}, {"text": "You know, it seemed like a harmless dessert when I first saw it, but when I heard what it was called, it was dreadful!  As a moose, I would not even look at the stuff, let alone taste it.  It is made with ladyfingers, mascarpone, and coffee, but I think there's moose in there, too.\n\nDo you know what dessert I am freaking out about?", "correct": "Tiramooseu", "options": ["Mooseaka", "Moose creme", "Mooselle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTiramooseu.\n\n\tTiramisu is a popular Italian dessert.  It is a very elegant and delicious dessert, and it is actually extremely simple to make.  You first take ladyfingers (store bought or homemade) and quickly dunk them in room temperature strong coffee or espresso.  Then you pour a cream mixture made with an Italian cream cheese called mascarpone over the top of the lady fingers.  You can make as many layers of this as you wish.  Top it with a sprinkle of cocoa powder and chill until you're ready to serve (and by \"chill\" I mean put the dessert in the fridge, not relax on the sofa). \n"}, {"text": "I don't mind eating at ice cream parlors, but there is one store in particular that I will not eat at.  The name of it makes me think there are moose in the ice cream!  They sell burgers too, though.  But they're probably elk burgers.\n\nWhat's that chain called again?  I can't bear to say it myself.", "correct": "Deery Queen", "options": ["Caribou Queen", "Muntjac Queen", "Elk Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeery Queen.\n\n\tDairy Queen, as it is rightfully called, was founded in 1940.  It is a fast food and soft-serve restaurant.  Dairy Queen, sometimes abbreviated to DQ, is well known for their ice cream known as the Blizzard.  DQ brags that it is so thick of an ice cream that you can flip the dessert upside-down and it will not come out of the cup. \n"}, {"text": "Some people like to drink malts, and I'm perfectly fine with that.  But as a moose, I don't like my fellow cervidae to be blended into a creamy drink any more than the next guy!\n\nThis creamy drink has my knickers in a knot.  What is it?", "correct": "Chocolate Melkshake", "options": ["Vanilla Mooseshake", "Chocolate Deershake", "Caramel Frapucchino"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate Melkshake.\n\n\tA chocolate milkshake is made from chocolate (whether powder or chocolate sauce or melted chocolate), milk (sometimes chocolate milk for extra chocolatey goodness) and ice cream (for an insanely chocolatey deliciousness, use chocolate ice cream).\r Chocolate: \"Now, if this drink was a chocolate elk-milk shake, that would be delicious.  I don't mind drinking an elk's milk.  But I distinctly remember hearing the waitress at the diner say it was a a chocolate mELKshake.  And that, my good friends, scares me to death.\" \n"}, {"text": "I'm a male moose, so I would never in a million years eat this next Turkish treat.  It's made with filo pastry, nuts, and syrup or honey, and that sounds delightful.  But the name leads me to believe there are moose chunks in it, and I won't stand for that.  I'm going to sit down.  I'm woozy.\n\nWhat's the dessert that's making me lightheaded?", "correct": "Bucklava", "options": ["Layered Moose Cake", "Turkish Deerlight", "Slavelk Nut Roll"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBucklava.\n\n\tBaklava is a delicious dessert with Ottoman Turkish origins.  It is made with thin filo pastry with nuts and honey.  Many layers are stacked on top of each other and the dish is baked.\r A similar treat (and one of my families secret recipes) is the Slavic Nut Roll.  Though it is not made in layers, and instead is made in a roll, it has a similar flavor and same basic ingredients. \n"}, {"text": "I love to eat cookies.  But they must be cooked.  I can never eat a raw cookie!  That would be cannibalism.  And my wife would not appreciate me eating her.\n\nI've always hated eating raw cookies, because you humans call them what?", "correct": "Cookie Doe", "options": ["Cookie Cow", "Cookie Cervidae", "Cookie Bat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCookie Doe.\n\n\tCookie dough is the basic mixture created to make cookies.  Once you bake them, of course, it is no longer cookie dough; and instead is just cookies.  Some people (myself included) like to eat raw chocolate chip cookie dough.  In fact, this is so popular, there is actually chocolate chip cookie dough flavored ice cream (but don't tell Chocolate Moose, he would be heartbroken). \n"}, {"text": "You evil, evil, evil humans!  How could you eat one of our young?  Why, baby deer have done nothing to hurt you.  I thought you liked them, what with all the \"Bambi\" stuff.  But I guess not.  You like to dip mini cheesecakes, fruits, and other assorted desserts in the chocolate and baby deer mixture.  EVIL!\n\nSalami_swami seems to think this dessert is melty and delicious, but I think it's pure evil.  What is it?", "correct": "Fawndue & Fondue & Fawn due", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFawndue & Fondue & Fawn due.\n\n\tChocolate: \"Fawndue?  Fawndue?  You humans are evil.  What is more; you eat your own children.  BABY food?  Cannibals!\"\r Chocolate is quite irate with us humans; I'll let him calm down a bit.\r There are many types of fondue.  Some restaurants are even dedicated to a fondue meal.  First, a cheese fondue is served as an appetizer.  The cheese mixture can be used to dip all sorts of items, including breads.  The main dish, and also the \"original\" fondue, is a bowl of hot oil.  Of course, fondue is fondue because it is a dip of some sort heated from underneath.  The oil is hot enough to cook things; ravioli, steak pieces, and chicken, to name a few.  But my favorite is to dip muenster cheese in it for just a moment.  Finally, chocolate fondue is served for dessert.  A hot, melty, chocolatey sauce is made and heated in the fondue pot, and all sorts of desserts, including fruit, are dipped in the chocolate.  Delicioso (but not to Chocolate Moose). \n"}, {"text": "I went to a carnival, thinking that, with a petting zoo, this place would be harmless to moose and elk alike.  But I was mistaken.  As I was eating fried butter and cotton candy, I noticed something.  As I stood in line, waiting to get my apple turnover, I heard someone order a fun elk cake, and then, I heard someone order a doughnut-like dessert.  Oh, you humans just love the taste of us, don't you?\n\nYou tell me; what did that person order that makes me sad?", "correct": "Apple Fred Deer", "options": ["Apple Dumpling Deer", "Apple Roe Deer", "Apple White-tailed Deer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApple Fred Deer.\n\n\tFritters are common fair and carnival food, as most fried foods are.  Fritters come in many different varieties, including the apple fritter.  Of course, Chocolate the Moose is a bit on edge; and misheard the dish as a chocolate f-red deer.\r He didn't like hearing someone order a fun elk cake (funnel cake) either. \n"}, {"text": "I love drinking a nice tea with my desserts.  I had asked the waiter for an assortment for me to select from, and to my dismay, your moose-y eating habits have found its way into my favorite drink, too.  You people freak me out.\n\nDo you know what flavor of tea has made me uneasy?", "correct": "Honey Caramelk Chamomile", "options": ["Squirrel Gray", "Sheepy Time", "Kangaroolong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoney Caramelk Chamomile.\n\n\tHoney Caramel Chamomile is a flavor of tea that is very sweet and comforting on a cold night.  As chamomile is caffeine free, it is a great drink to drink near bedtime.  It's also a great dessert tea.\r Chocolate Moose was also scared to see Deerjeeling tea as an option. \n"}, {"text": "Now you've done it.  This is the worst dessert of all.  It's not just made out of moose, it's made out of me in particular! *Chocolate the Moose faints*\n\nSalami_swami: \"Chocolate Moose seems to have confused his name with some other dessert.  What is the proper name of 'chocolate moose'?\"", "correct": "Chocolate Mousse", "options": ["Chocolate Mouse", "Chocolate Moose", "Chocolate Moosse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate Mousse.\n\n\tChocolate mousse somewhat resembles a whipped pudding.  It is a French word that means \"lather\" or \"foam\".  The dessert is very light, fluffy, and creamy.\r Since mousse is a word meaning lather, or foam, it is also used to describe a hair product; which Chocolate the Moose uses to keep his fur from sticking up. \n"}]}
