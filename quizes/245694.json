Is it true that Frank works on a young Korean boy who 'can't be 5-years old'?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tHawkeye is on the case, assisted by Trapper.  Later, after inquiring about the young boy, they find that there is no sign of the child's family. \n"}, {"text": "Trapper especially seems to be enjoying the young Korean boy.

Ultimately, we find out that Henry is using the wrong map when he claims that Trapper is now safely in downtown where?", "correct": "Berlin", "options": ["Rome", "London", "New York City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBerlin.\n\n\tUnbelieveably, Henry is using a World War II surplus map to guide Trapper through the minefield.
