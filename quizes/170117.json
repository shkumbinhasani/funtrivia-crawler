{"id": "170117", "name": "The Film History of Bill Murray Quiz / Test | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed L-R", " Bill Murray"], "questions": [{"text": "Following several years as a performer on 'Saturday Night Live', Murray took is first step towards movie stardom in 1979.  It was then that Murray filled the lead role in the wacky Ivan Reitman-directed comedy 'Meatballs'.  What was his character's given name in 'Meatballs'?", "correct": "Tripper", "options": ["Trapper", "Tupper", "Topper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTripper.\n\n\tAmong discerning filmgoers 'Meatballs' will never be confused with 'Citizen Kane', but it's worth watching simply to observe Bill Murray's performance as Tripper Harrison, a counselor at a crazy summer camp.  Remember the chant, 'It Just Doesn't Matter'? \n"}, {"text": "An all-time favorite for lovers of cheesy comedies everywhere, the 1980 film 'Caddyshack' featured Murray as the beloved Carl Spackler, groundskeeper and sworn enemy of pesky gophers.  Who does not co-star with Bill Murray in Caddyshack?", "correct": "Dan Aykroyd", "options": ["Rodney Dangerfield", "Chevy Chase", "Ted Knight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDan Aykroyd.\n\n\tIn a holistic sense, the plot for this film (and much of the dialogue) is incredibly inane, but the individual performances make it a comedy classic.  None of the performances is more memorable than Murray's turn as Carl Spackler.  Who can forget his famous Dalai Lama speech?  'Do you know what the Lama says? Gunga galunga...gunga, gunga-galunga.'  Rumor has it that he improvised that speech and more for this film (nor really a rumor, actually!  Murray apparently always improvises.)  Pure comic genius! \n"}, {"text": "Bill Murray made us all laugh once again as John Winger, a down-and-out cab driver who finds new life in the U.S. army.  What was the title of the film described here?", "correct": "Stripes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStripes.\n\n\tAgain working with Ivan Reitman, and co-starring his director from 'Caddyshack' Harold Ramis, Murray puts it all on the screen for his fans--the smarm; playing it dumb but lovable, and actually making the audience care for his otherwise shiftless character John Winger.  In the classic words of Winger, 'We're America, we're ten and one!' \n"}, {"text": "Murray's first monster box office hit was the 1984 comedy 'Ghostbusters', featuring the loveable Bill alongside Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis and Annie Potts.  What is the surname of his character in this entertaining classic?", "correct": "Venkman", "options": ["Stantz", "Spengler", "Zeddemore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVenkman.\n\n\tMurray portrays Dr. Peter Venkman, though I had a hard time being convinced that this clown actually had the patience to acquire a Ph.D.  Again, Ivan Reitman directs Murray in a role that was initially meant to go to the late John Belushi.  Though I'm a huge Belushi fan, I'm not sure that he would have been able to pull of such a cutesy role.  Murray was perfect! \n"}, {"text": "One of Bill Murray's early dramatic roles was that of Larry Darrell in the film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel 'The Razor's Edge'.  Murray garnered his first Academy Award nomination for this role.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIndeed, he was not recognized by the academy.  In fact, Murray's first Oscar nomination did not come until his 2003 performance in 'Lost in Translation'.  'The Razor's Edge' is an interesting film, and Murray provides a good performance.  He also wrote the screenplay, showing off his diverse talents. \n"}, {"text": "One of Bill Murray's most outrageously funny performances was in the 1986 comedy/musical 'Little Shop of Horrors', where he played Arthur Denton, a masochist with a special affinity for pain inflicted by...?", "correct": "Dentists", "options": ["Enraged animals", "Cacti", "Tennis players"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDentists.\n\n\t'Little Shop of Horrors' was a musical adapted to film, and unfortunately it did not entirely click with fans.  In my opinion the show was stolen by two actors, Steve Martin, who played the sadistic Orin Scrivello, D.D.S., and Bill Murray, who portrayed Arthur Denton, a masochistic dental patient. \n"}, {"text": "In 1991 Bill Murray played the role of Bob Wiley, the extremely dysfunctional and neurotic patient of Dr. Leo Marvin, portrayed by Richard Dreyfus, in the film 'What About Bob?'.  Frank Oz directed the film, the second time the two had teamed up as director and actor.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe first time had been in the film 'Little Shop of Horrors'.  This pairing was more successful comedically, with Bill Murray once again showing off his extensive acting repertoire in this role as an enormously insecure (but loveable) hypochondriac.  Remember the line, 'Baby step to four o'clock. Baby step to four o'clock.'? \n"}, {"text": "My personal, all-time favorite Bill Murray film is the wonderful 1993 romantic comedy 'Groundhog Day'.  Not only does Murray perform sharply as Phil Connors, a television weatherman, he is also surrounded by an excellent supporting cast.  Who portrays his leading lady, Rita, in the film?", "correct": "Andie MacDowell", "options": ["Geena Davis", "Teri Garr", "Barbara Hershey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndie MacDowell.\n\n\tCertainly 'Groundhog Day' would not have worked without Bill Murray's crafty acting, but would it have survived without the demure Andie MacDowell as well?  I think not! \n"}, {"text": "In another wonderful cameo, Bill Murray nearly steals the show in the 1996 film 'Kingpin' as the sleazy character Ernie McCracken.  Around what professional sport did this movie revolve?", "correct": "Bowling", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowling.\n\n\tPerhaps the greatest bowling film ever produced, 'Kingpin' was directed by the Farrelly brothers and starred Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Vanessa Angel, alongside Bill Murray.  Aside from his scene stealing performances, Murray also sported the all-time worst comb-over in the history of mankind. \n"}, {"text": "Bill Murray is the favorite of several directors, including Wes Anderson.  In which film did Bill Murray first team up with Anderson as actor and director?", "correct": "Rushmore", "options": ["The Life Aquatic", "Bottle Rocket", "The Royal Tenenbaums"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRushmore.\n\n\tThe 1998 film 'Rushmore' was only the first of several collaborations between Murray and Anderson.  Murray has also appeared in 2001's 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and the 2004 film 'The Life Aquatic', both directed by Anderson.  His roles in these Anderson films are more dramatic, but one can't watch Bill Murray without cracking a smile, even in his deepest moments.  Let's hope for many more films to come from Mr. Murray.
