A common problem in felines, trichobezoars have also been found on rare occasions in humans, especially with young girls who have the nasty habit of chewing or sucking on their hair!  Anyone who has a really nasty trichobezoar story please feel free *not* to let me know about it! \n"}, {"text": "It seems that each great city of Europe has an equally fantastic cathedral.

The eidetic imagery experiment entails having a subject stare at a picture with a number of details for several seconds before it is removed from view.  The subject is then asked to describe and identify elements of the picture.  People with very high retention rates of imagery (and language) are said to 'eidetikers'.  This very small portion of the population has the distinct advantage of never having to study for tests! \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following names would be most associated with a scientific device known as a 'Punnett Square'?  \n", "correct": "Gregor Mendel", "options": ["Isaac Newton", "Galileo Galilei", "Archimedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGregor Mendel.\n\n\tThink of a square divided into four equal sections, kind of like a small checkerboard.  Within each square are listed the four different genetic combinations of two parents, in the form of capital and lower case letters.

Cincinnatus, the general in question, was called upon to lead Roman troops into battle even though he previously had resigned from the Roman senate in shame.  Nominated as dictator with extraordinary powers, he fulfilled his mission and then relinquished his new-found powers. Many compared George Washington to Cincinnatus...craving power, both could easily have attempted to declare themselves king, but they apparently understood Lord Acton's precept about 'absolute power corrupting absolutely'! \n"}, {"text": "What would eventually become the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935 was founded in 1908 by the attorney general serving under Teddy Roosevelt.

The French call it a 'casserole', while the Chinese traditionally have seen it as a celestial chariot of sorts.  In medieval Europe it was a horse-drawn wagon, and the English traditionally refer to it as a plough.  I always saw it as a letter 'P'. \n"}, {"text": "One of the best-loved authors of the 20th century, John Steinbeck, told of an incident wherein his dog chewed up the original manuscript of one of Steinbeck's most cherished classics.

It seems that the critics panned his work, guaranteeing in Steinbeck's eyes that the work was potentially a classic!
