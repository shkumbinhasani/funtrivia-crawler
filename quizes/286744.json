{"id": "286744", "name": "Spelling It Out - \"Twilight Princess\" Online Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "Where is the bulk of the \"Twilight Princess\" storyline situated?", "correct": "Hyrule", "options": ["Koholint", "Termina", "Labrynna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyrule.\n\n\tHyrule, being a staple of the \"Legend of Zelda\" series, is not an unknown place for players, though magically, the land seems to shift every time a new game is played.  This incarnation of the land of Hyrule is vast, and Link needs to reach all of the far corners of it in order to save Princess Zelda and defeat the final boss.  The land is split into large provinces.  Link begins in Ordon Province and proceeds through Faron, Eldin, Lanayru, Desert, and Peak Provinces on different occasions.  Most of these large provinces are linked together by the extensive Hyrule Field (though not all of them) which surrounds Hyrule Castle, situated smack-dab in the middle of it all.\rHyrule has appeared in many other games from the series including, what may possibly be the most popular title, \"Ocarina of Time\" and 'A Link to the Past\" (as well as others).  Termina is from \"Majora's Mask\", Labrynna is featured in \"Oracle of Ages\", and Koholint is visited in \"Link's Awakening (DX)\". \n"}, {"text": "In which province can Link find Kakariko Village?", "correct": "Eldin", "options": ["Ordon", "Desert", "Lanayru"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEldin.\n\n\tKakariko Village, featured once again in \"Twilight Princess\", is often depicted as a joyous city populated by many.  It's not the same in \"Twilight Princess\".  Link first visits the village in the twilight, as a wolf, and must search for parasites to fill his Vessel of Light.  Upon entering the main building, Link and Midna find the children of Ordon Village (save Ilia) in the care of Renado, the village's overseer. After restoring the area, Link will encounter the local spirit, Eldin, and he will be able to navigate the dusty town, visiting its few shops (one of these is opened by Malo, from Ordon Village) and interacting with the three locals and the children. When Ilia is found in Hyrule Castle Town, she and the Zora prince travel by caravan to Kakariko Village to be in the care of Renado as well.  When Link obtains certain items from the Hidden Village, he will bring them back to the village for Ilia.  Eldin Province is also home to Death Mountain, Goron Mines, and the Bridge of Eldin, which is destroyed shortly after Link crosses it for the first time. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Telma's cat?", "correct": "Louise", "options": ["Rusty", "Purlo", "Beth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLouise.\n\n\tIn Hyrule Castle Town, Link will encounter Telma's Bar numerous times as it leads directly into the hidden passages under Hyrule Castle and it's a hotspot for gossip and adventure-seekers.  Telma, being quite the leader, houses Ilia here during her amnesia, and drives the caravan carrying Ilia and Prince Ralis to Kakariko Village.  It's evident that she has a thing for Kakariko's leader, Renado.\rLouise, Telma's cat (note the reference to \"Thelma and Louise\"), is quite the character herself, allowing Link to access valuable information and locations while in wolf-form.  Because of Link's ability to talk to animals in this form, Louise is an important ally when the search comes up with nothing.  Link can also talk with numerous cats outside Gengle's house in Hyrule Castle Town. \n"}, {"text": "One of these can be found at the end of Snowpeak Ruins, after defeating the boss.  Another is after the boss in City in the Sky.  What item is it?", "correct": "Mirror Shard", "options": ["Broken Key Shard", "Piece of Heart", "Fused Shadow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMirror Shard.\n\n\tAfter defeating the Arbiter's Grounds, Link will arrive at the Mirror Chamber on top of the dungeon.  The mirror frame here will hold the first Mirror Shard of the game, and in order to obtain the other three pieces, Link must defeat the bosses of Snowpeak Ruins, Temple of Time, and City in the Sky, respectively.  Once these four shards are placed back into the frame, Link can travel to the Palace of Twilight to imbue his Master Sword with the power of Light.  After the game is complete, Midna will travel back into the mirror and destroy it, breaking it into tiny, unrepairable fragments.\rBroken Key Shards are needed to open the boss door of the Goron Mines, Fused Shadows are found after completion of the first three dungeons of the game, and Pieces of Hearts are scattered around Hyrule.  Heart Containers are given following the defeat of any of the game's bosses (save Ganondorf). \n"}, {"text": "Who is the boss of the Temple of Time?", "correct": "Armogohma", "options": ["Argorok", "Darknut", "Blizzeta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArmogohma.\n\n\tArmogohma, the Twilit Arachnid, is a confusing creature.  Due to the fact that most of this creature is covered in a protective casing, Link can not use many of his normal weapons to defeat the creature.  However, one specific weak point, an eye in the middle of its back, will be enough to bring the creature down to the ground with an arrow.  Once the Armogohma is on the ground, Link must use the Dominion Rod, found by defeating Darknut in the top chamber of the temple, to control the statues in the corners of the room and smash the armor on the creature.  Once the armor is broken, there's not much left to do.  Link just needs to defeat the eye, and without its armor, it's pretty much powerless.\rCompletion of this boss battle results in the penultimate shard of the Mirror of Twilight, which sets Link one step closer to entering the Palace of Twilight. \n"}, {"text": "When Link gives Yeto the Ordon Goat Cheese in Snowpeak Ruins, what item can be used as a result?", "correct": "Superb Soup", "options": ["Good Soup", "Delicious Soup", "Simple Soup"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuperb Soup.\n\n\tAs Link makes his way through the fifth dungeon, Snowpeak Ruins, you may notice that there's a lack of hearts throughout the dungeon.  There will not be any way for Link to regain his lost health if he is harmed in any way.  The way to combat this, though, is through Yeto's soups.  As Link searches the different sections of the dungeon for the Bedroom Key, he will, instead, come across various Ordonian foods.  Yeto begins with a Simple Soup, which cures two hearts, but after giving him the Ordon Pumpkin, a Good Soup will result, and Link will be able to heal four hearts per drink.  When Ordon Goat Cheese is used, it results in the Superb Soup, which will heal eight hearts per sip.  Link needs an empty bottle to use the soup.\rAs soon as Link defeats Blizzeta, the boss of this dungeon, it will transform back into Yeto's wife, Yeta, and their love will allow the room to be filled with hearts. \n"}, {"text": "Whose memo allows Link to use the cannon at Lake Hylia to access Gerudo Desert?", "correct": "Auru's", "options": ["Fyer's", "Shad's", "Hena's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAuru's.\n\n\tAuru can be found at Lake Hylia when his services are required.  Essentially, he writes up the item known as Auru's Memo in order to give Link access to the cannon owned by Fyer on Lake Hylia.  Although the cannon is primarily used to reach Falbi's Flight-By-Fowl on the cliffs overlooking the lake, the Memo allows for Link to be shot into Desert Province, adjacent to the lake.  In doing this, Link is able to continue the quest to the Arbiter's Grounds, the fourth dungeon of the game.\rShad is found in Kakariko Village.  Using the Ancient Sky Book given to Link by Impaz, and all of the Sky Characters needed to power the Dominion Rod, Shad recites the incantation needed to repower the item, and allow Link to find the Oocca Cannon.  If Link brings this to Fyer, he can repair it and send Link to the City in the Sky.  Hena manages the fishing hole near Zora's Domain. \n"}, {"text": "Which character from Ordon Village gives Link the Fishing Rod early in the game?", "correct": "Uli", "options": ["Rusl", "Talo", "Ilia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUli.\n\n\tThe Fishing Rod is the first of many equippable items obtained in the game, and although its basic premise is the same (cast and catch), Link is able to upgrade the lure that is placed onto the end of it.  Crafted by Colin early in the game, Link gets the Rod when it's most needed.  Using the rod from the dock in town, Link needs to catch a couple fish, one of which must be taken by Pergie's cat and taken back to the shop so that Link can purchase the Slingshot.  The Rod is given to Link by Uli, Colin's mother, outside their house.\rLink can use the Fishing Rod in numerous waterways and lakes in the game, but true fishermen go to the fishing hole near Zora's Domain for the real action.  This hideout is filled with different climates for fish to swim in, and for a small fee, Link can hire a boat to go out in.  Here, Link catches the largest fish in the game, he can hook onto a Piece of Heart, or he can just spend some time relaxing.\rThe Fishing Rod, for Wii players, utilizes the motion-sensitive technology of the Wii Remote, allowing players to actually cast their line with a swift flick. \n"}, {"text": "Who was once the Zora Queen?", "correct": "Rutela", "options": ["Agitha", "Iza", "Luda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRutela.\n\n\tRutela and her husband were killed by Zant and her people encased in ice within the pools of Zora's Domain.  Her son, Prince Ralis, escaped the peril but ended up in the hands of Telma and Ilia in Hyrule Castle Town.  Due to his worsening condition, they were forced to travel by caravan to Kakariko Village to be in Renado's care.  After Renado is able to heal Ralis, he can be found within a grave in Kakariko Graveyard.  Before Link heads to Peak Province, he needs to capture the Reekfish in Zora's Domain.  He needs to call upon the help of Prince Ralis, who gives him a Coral Earring.  This item becomes the hook of Link's Fishing Rod, and allows him to catch the fish to smell its scent.\rThis is the only instance in the game where Link requires a new hook.  Throughout the rest of the game, although the lure can change based on where and what Link wants to fish, the hook remains the same. \n"}, {"text": "What nine-letter location, character, enemy, or item is spelled out with the first letter of the previous nine answers?", "correct": "Helmasaur", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHelmasaur.\n\n\tHelmasaurs are encountered for the first time in the Lakebed Temple, the third dungeon of the game, and in order to defeat them, it's best for Link to utilize his new Clawshot, which is found in the same dungeon.  Because of the Helmasaur's facial plating, Link will be unable to strike the creature at the front and sides.  There is no blocking the charge of the Helmasaur.\rWhen Link reaches the City in the Sky dungeon, a similar enemy, the Helmasaurus, is encountered for the first time.  Despite the fact that this dungeon is situated on platforms in the sky, these large beasts seem to have no qualms with moving about.  Like Helmasaurs, these will have a defensive plate protecting their fronts, and because of their sizes, they will be a greater cause of harm to Link if he doesn't avoid it.  The Clawshot won't work on this enemy because of its size, but being a seasoned swordfighter, it should be easy to dodge and swipe back around at its unprotected rear. \n"}]}
