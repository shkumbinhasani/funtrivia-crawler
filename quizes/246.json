Lead poisoning doesn't even begin to cover it. (In fairness to Caligula, some of these stories -- especially the one about incest -- may have been fabricated or exaggerated.He had many enemies, and they wound up writing the history books. It's generally pretty well accepted that Caligula was probably a madman, and certainly a terrible emperor, whether or not the more lurid tales are true. Some scholars now believe that his madness was precipitated by a bout of encephalitis or meningitis.) \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the horse who, legend says, served as consul?", "correct": "Incitatus", "options": ["Bucephalus", "Pegasus", "King of the Wind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIncitatus.\n\n\tThe \"mane\" problem, of course, was with all the \"neigh\"sayers ... \n"}, {"text": "The emperor Nero tried several times to kill his mother -- for example, he sent her to sea on a sabotaged boat with assassin sailors -- but only succeeded several years later, when she told the assassins sent for her to stab first at her womb, whence her ungrateful son had been born.

The boat attempt failed partly because Agrippina, having been a pearl diver, was an excellent swimmer, and partly because her best friend claimed she was Agrippina, so that the sailors killed her and let the real Agrippina escape. (Thanks to all who pointed out that the fiddle had not exactly been invented yet when Rome burned.) \n"}, {"text": "On the subject of crazy emperors: one of the Julian emperors was said to have taken up an unusual hobby near the end of his reign.

Without capital to rebuild (no veterans plans in those days), they had to sell their farms; the new landholders elected to use slave labor rather than hire free veterans.Consequently, there were massive numbers of landless poor, who were always unhappy and frequently rioting. The Gracchus brothers had the crazy idea of enacting a size limit to large estates, and giving the extra land to the poor. This was unpopular with the wealthy Senators, who supected that the Gracchi were merely grandstanding in an attempt to accumulate personal power and prestige.Today the brothers are often regarded as populist heroes, although their true motivations are lost to history. \n"}, {"text": "What emperor was a Stoic philosopher and wrote 'Meditations'?", "correct": "Marcus Aurelius", "options": ["Augustus", "Antoninus Pius", "Diocletian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius.\n\n\tMarcus Aurelius, last of the 'Good' emperors, made the terrible mistake of appointing his incompetent son Commodus as his heir. \n"}, {"text": "Emperors in Rome had a personal, 9000-man guard which would occasionally murder them and appoint new emperors in their place.

To this day, though, we can't read Etruscan writing, despite their alphabet's similarities to our own -- their language has yet to be deciphered. The story of the Romans and the Etruscans is fascinating, since the Etruscans once ruled over Rome in the time of the kings - but then the tide turned, and the Etruscan civilization vanished through war and assimilation. \n"}]}
