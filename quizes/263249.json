{"id": "263249", "name": "Animals of \"Twilight Princess\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "Like in many other \"Zelda\" titles, Epona once again returns to give Link a hand.  Who gives you the horse call in this game?", "correct": "Ilia", "options": ["Malo", "Rusl", "Renado"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIlia.\n\n\tAfter you obtain a charm that Ilia gave to Impaz in the Hidden Village, you can return it to her to help her regain her memories.  When she gives it back to you, you can use it to summon Epona in many locations along your quest.  Epona is first found near the very beginning of the game, and she is needed on many occasions.  The horse is a very crucial tool in defeating the Bulblin Lord on the Bridge of Eldin and the Great Hylian Bridge.  Epona can also be called with the horse grass found in the fields and paths of Hyrule. \n"}, {"text": "When you journey through the Forest Temple, which animals do you require the assistance of?", "correct": "Monkeys", "options": ["Dogs", "Wolves", "Cuccos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonkeys.\n\n\tIn order to cross the large canyon that splits the Forest Temple in half and obtain the Gale Boomerang, you'll need to rescue four monkeys that can be found in the various chambers of the dungeon.  More monkeys are also found throughout the last half of the dungeon, and you need their help once again to cross a large seemingly-bottomless pit that was coincidentally placed between the door to the boss chamber and the rest of the temple. \n"}, {"text": "Using a certain type of grass/weed, you can summon which of these birds to help you in Ordon Village?", "correct": "Hawk", "options": ["Condor", "Cucco", "Songbird"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawk.\n\n\tAlthough the hawk can be summoned in various points in the game, it is needed in order for you to leave the village.  You summon the hawk in order for it to retrieve a small cradle on a pedestal of land in the middle of a body of water.  This is the fault of the monkeys, who seem to have been involved in an Ordonian crime wave.  This crib is given to Uli, who in turn gives you the Fishing Rod. \n"}, {"text": "A certain cat is needed in order for you to claim your slingshot early in the game.  What must you do to get it to return home?", "correct": "Catch it a fish from the river.", "options": ["Chase it around town, leading it to the door of its house.", "Acquire catnip from the nearby meadow and have it follow you home.", "Pick it up and carry it home."], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatch it a fish from the river.\n\n\tThe local shopkeeper is disappointed that she scolded her cat, and since the moment, it hasn't come home.  This ultimately makes her decide that she'd rather not earn a profit and she closes down her shop.  Set out with the newly acquired Fishing Rod, courtesy of Uli, and go to the dock in town to catch a fish (once or twice).  The cat will instantly take the fish back home to make her owner feel better, and you can buy your Slingshot for a meager thirty rupees. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the helpful bird found outside the Forest Temple that will sell you various liquids?", "correct": "Trill", "options": ["Plumm", "Ruki", "Oocca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrill.\n\n\tTrill is quite the odd, little bird as he sells his wares outside the first dungeon of the game.  Although his shop only consists of potion and lantern oil, you can always stop by for a refill if you have an empty bottle.  Trill can't forcefully make you pay, so it's possible to leave without paying the full cost, but if you do this and choose to return, he will have to attack you.  Plumm is Trill's sibling, and he's found taking care of the Fruit-Pop-Flight mini-game at Lake Hylia.  You can only visit this in wolf-form, though. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these tasks does not require that Link be in wolf-form?", "correct": "Capturing a Golden Bug", "options": ["Visiting Jovani for the first time", "Defeating a Poe", "Teleporting to various Warp Portals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCapturing a Golden Bug.\n\n\tLink first becomes a wolf when he enters the twilight covering the Faron Woods.  When Link takes the Master Sword, it's possible for him to accomplish tasks that would have been impossible before, as it allows you to transform between wolf and human form at any time.  Over sixty Poes must be destroyed in the game, and two requirements need to be fulfilled before any of this can be done. First, you must be a wolf, and second, it must be nighttime.  Jovani, whose soul was taken by Poes, can only be visited while you are a wolf as you need to dig into his house.  Warping can only be done in wolf form, but bug catching for Princess Agatha can only be done when Link is a human. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Telma's cat?", "correct": "Louise", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLouise.\n\n\tLouise is a sly, little feline who looks over Telma's Bar in Hyrule Castle Town.  When you're in wolf form, Louise will be kind enough to gossip with you and provide helpful hints.  It's Louise that allows you to go through Telma's Bar via a secret entrance that allows you to cross the ceiling unnoticed and reach Hyrule Castle, and it's also her who stole the Wooden Statue from Doctor Borville.  Unfortunately, this was taken from her by some Bulblins outside the Bar. \n"}, {"text": "In order to cross the Faron Woods and return to the Sacred Forest for the second time, you need the Golden Cucco.  Who gives you this?", "correct": "Rusl", "options": ["Talo", "Uli", "Beth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRusl.\n\n\tAfter you complete the Snowpeak Ruins, head back to the entrance of the Forest Temple (where Trill's shop is) and find Rusl.  Here, he will give you an elusive Golden Cucco that can be used to float across the endless expanses of nothingness that surround the area.  Once you reach the actual Sacred Woods, the Cucco will disappear forever, as you'll never need him again in the game.  You'll later be able to create a Warp Portal in the Sacred Grove outside the Temple of Time. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Jovani's cat?", "correct": "Gengle", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGengle.\n\n\tMuch like Jovani, Gengle is transformed into jewels and rupees by the fiendish Poes, but when you begin to obtain their souls, Gengle is the first to return to normal (although at this point, Jovani is still gold).  They give you a bottle of Great Fairy Tears in return for your services.  If you collect all sixty Poe souls, you will be able to fill your wallet anytime you visit their house.  Evidently, Gengle is the leader of the group of cats outside Jovani's house. \n"}, {"text": "How many cats do you need to find in the Hidden Village to claim the Heart Piece?", "correct": "Twenty", "options": ["One", "Twenty-five", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwenty.\n\n\tAfter you clear the Bulblins out of the Hidden Village and save the sole resident, Impaz, you can look around for a bit and find a lonely Cucco and a Wolf Statue behind one of the buildings.  If you return later, the village will be overrun by cats (making Impaz one of those odd cat ladies...).  Talk to the Cucco as a wolf and you can begin a mini-game to claim a Piece of Heart. \n"}]}
