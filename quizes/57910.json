{"id": "57910", "name": "'Justice League' Animated: 'Secret Origins' Quiz | Television | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television H-K", "Justice League"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the seven Justice Leaguers do we see first in the episode?", "correct": "Batman", "options": ["Superman", "Flash", "Wonder Woman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatman.\n\n\tWe see Batman spying on some unusual activities at a WayneTech facility in Metropolis. Superman arrives on the scene just a few minutes later. \n"}, {"text": "For a brief period early in the episode, the plot seems to have been inspired by one of the live-action 'Superman' movies. Which one is it?", "correct": "'Superman IV: The Quest For Peace'", "options": ["'Superman II'", "'Superman: The Movie'", "'Superman III'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Superman IV: The Quest For Peace'.\n\n\tSuperman addresses the 'World Assembly' (obviously a stand-in for the real-life United Nations) and states that he plans to eradicate every nuclear missile in the world. A nearly identical declaration was made by the Man of Steel in 'Superman IV: The Quest For Peace,' and much of the subsequent plot (using that word loosely) focused on nuclear disarmament in general, and Superman's plan to enforce it in particular. \n"}, {"text": "The actor providing the voice of Flash is also (as of November 2001) involved in another television show featuring superhumans. What show is it?", "correct": "'Smallville'", "options": ["'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'", "'Dark Angel'", "'Roswell'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Smallville'.\n\n\tMichael Rosenbaum, the voice of Flash, can be seen weekly as Lex Luthor on the WB series 'Smallville,' which focuses on the teenage years of Clark Kent, the future Superman. \n"}, {"text": "Two Justice Leaguers have first names that are very similar. Which ones are they?", "correct": "Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter", "options": ["Flash and Green Lantern", "Martian Manhunter and Flash", "Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen Lantern and Martian Manhunter.\n\n\tGreen Lantern's real name is John Stewart (although I'm not sure they mentioned his last name in this episode). The Martian Manhunter introduces himself by giving a translation of his Martian name, J'onn J'onzz. J'onn's name is apparently pronounced much like the French 'Jean,' something I never caught in the comic books...which would be hard to do, I guess. =) \n"}, {"text": "Which Justice Leaguer was NOT meeting all of the others for the very first time in this episode?", "correct": "Hawkgirl", "options": ["Wonder Woman", "None of these", "Martian Manhunter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkgirl.\n\n\tWe're shown that Wonder Woman has left the confines of Themiscrya (a.k.a. 'Paradise Island') for the first time ever, and since she's new to 'Man's World,' she's a stranger to the rest of the team. Martian Manhunter had been held prisoner since first arriving on Earth, so he too was meeting everyone for the first time once Superman and Batman freed him. The other five heroes clearly know each other. \n"}, {"text": "Wonder Woman makes two references to the same Greek goddess. Which one is it?", "correct": "Hera", "options": ["Hestia", "Aphrodite", "Athena"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHera.\n\n\tHera, Zeus' wife (and sister -- it's a long story), is generally known as 'the queen of the gods.' When Wonder Woman says, 'Hera, give me strength,' she's really reaching out to the top brass, there...but hey, if you're gonna pray, pray big. \n"}, {"text": "Flash's great speed allows him to do a number of amazing things. Which feat does he NOT perform in this episode?", "correct": "Vibrate the molecules of his body apart and pass through solid matter", "options": ["Create a windstorm with his arms", "Defy gravity", "He does all of these things"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVibrate the molecules of his body apart and pass through solid matter.\n\n\tFlash runs straight up the side of a building at one point, as he is moving more quickly than gravity can sufficiently affect him. He also whips his arms around at great speed, causing a windstorm to disperse toxic gas used against Green Lantern. Flash did not pass through solid matter in this episode, even though the comic books depict him doing so all the time (with occasionally explosive results, but never mind). \n"}, {"text": "When in full costume, how many of the seven Justice Leaguers have visible pupils IN THIS EPISODE?", "correct": "3", "options": ["8", "0", "all of them"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tThe masks worn by Batman and Flash obscure their pupils -- all we see are white spaces. The Martian Manhunter doesn't seem to have pupils; his eyes are just solid red. When Green Lantern is using his power, his eyes turn completely green, and no pupils are visible. (NOTE: In most subsequent episodes, Green Lantern DOES have pupils, which turn green when he's powered up...but it didn't work that way in 'Secret Origins,' and that's the episode being discussed in this quiz.) Superman and Wonder Woman's pupils can be easily seen, as neither of them wears a mask; and the eye-holes of Hawkgirl's mask do allow us to see her actual eyes, pupils included.So that's three. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the main television reporter keeping tabs on the events of the episode?", "correct": "Snapper Carr", "options": ["Jimmy Olsen", "Jack Ryder", "Steve Lombard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnapper Carr.\n\n\tIn the comics, a character named Snapper Carr was actually the Justice League's 'mascot.' Will we be seeing more of Snapper on the show, or was his appearance just a one-time inside joke? Time will tell. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following items did we NOT see Batman draw from his utility belt and put to good use?", "correct": "a gas mask", "options": ["explosive batarangs", "brass knuckles containing a taser charge", "We see him use all of these items"], "explanation": "\n\n\na gas mask.\n\n\tAlthough there's some toxic gas thrown around here and there during the episode, we never see Batman using a gas mask. Those knuckles, by the way, are very cool. =) \n"}, {"text": "We see Hawkgirl, but not her perennial partner Hawkman. Why not?", "correct": "We're never told", "options": ["Hawkman has lost his powers", "Hawkman has died", "Hawkman has returned to his home world of Thanagar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe're never told.\n\n\tHawkman's name is never even mentioned in the episode. The 'behind-the scenes' answer to this question is that the powers-that-be wanted there to be more than one woman on the team, so they dumped their original idea of using Hawkman in favor of his distaff partner. Fine by me. \n"}, {"text": "How many members of the League were definitely NOT born on the planet Earth?", "correct": "3", "options": ["7", "0", "1"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tMartian Manhunter is from Mars. Hawkgirl explains that she is from a planet called Thanagar. Superman, of course, was born on Krypton. Flash, Green Lantern, and Batman are all native earthlings, and even though Wonder Woman was conceived through supernatural means, that conception did indeed occur on Earth (albeit a part of it that's awfully hard to get to). \n"}, {"text": "Both Batman and Superman have been featured in previous animated series helmed by 'Justice League' producer Paul Dini. Are Batman and Superman voiced in 'Justice League' by the same actors who provided their voices in their previous solo series?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tKevin Conroy reprises his role as the voice of Batman, but Tim Daly, who provided Superman's voice in the animated 'Superman' series, does not contribute to 'Justice League.' Superman's new voice is supplied by George Newbern, who played the fiancee in 'Father of the Bride' (1991) and had a short stint on the 1998-99 season of 'Friends' as Danny, the 'Yeti' neighbor who briefly romanced Rachel until his unusual relationship with his sister freaked everyone out. \n"}, {"text": "We see Martian Manhunter employing a number of superhuman abilities in this episode. Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Telekinesis", "options": ["Telepathy", "Intangibility", "Shape-changing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelekinesis.\n\n\tJ'onn communicates telepathically, changes his shape, and renders his body incorporeal several times throughout the episode. He never displays (nor does he have) the ability to move physical objects with the power of his mind. \n"}, {"text": "What planet is the alien invasion force featured in this episode originally from?", "correct": "It's never revealed", "options": ["Thanagar", "Mars", "Krypton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's never revealed.\n\n\tJ'onn J'onzz reveals that, although Earth astronauts unwittingly unleashed these aliens while visiting Mars, the aliens themselves were not from Mars originally. They arrived on Mars a thousand years earlier, and had been engaged in a very long war with the native Martians, but it's made clear that the aliens come from somewhere else entirely. J'onn: 'No one knew where they came from.' \n"}, {"text": "Batman postulates that the invading aliens must have a weakness that can be exploited, and he's eventually proven right. What is this weakness?", "correct": "sunlight", "options": ["the bacteria in Earth's atmosphere", "fire", "water"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsunlight.\n\n\tDirect sunlight literally burns the flesh of the aliens. \n"}, {"text": "How much time lapses between the prologue (in which astronaut J. Alan Carter makes his discovery on Mars) and the action that takes place in the 'present center' of the episode?", "correct": "two years", "options": ["three years", "It's never said", "four years"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwo years.\n\n\tJust before Batman discovers the aliens at the WayneTech facility in Metropolis, we see a title card that reads 'two years later.' That seemed like an awfully short amount of time for the alien impersonating Carter to get back to Earth from Mars *and* get himself elected as a U.S. Senator...but maybe that's just me.  \r (Could J. Alan Carter's name be an oblique reference to Edgar Rice Burroughs' pulp character Jon Carter, Man of Mars...?) \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the leader of the invading alien force?", "correct": "The Imperium", "options": ["The Supremor", "The Primary", "The Ultimate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Imperium.\n\n\tWhen that thing shoved writhing, slimy tentacles under J'onn's skin...ugh. Creepy, man. \n"}, {"text": "Technology from what planet is used in the construction of the Justice League's new 'Watchtower Satellite'?", "correct": "Earth", "options": ["Mars", "Thanagar", "Krypton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarth.\n\n\tIn earlier comic book incarnations, the League's satellite is made of Kryptonian and Oan technology, but here in the cartoon it's a product of WayneTech, Batman's corporation. No mention of alien technology is made. \n"}, {"text": "As Superman finishes his speech that basically invites the assembled heroes to remain together as a team, many of the heroes accept his offer by standing in a circle and joining hands. Which two heroes never participate in this circle?", "correct": "Batman and Martian Manhunter", "options": ["Martian Manhunter and Hawkgirl", "Hawkgirl and Green Lantern", "Green Lantern and Batman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatman and Martian Manhunter.\n\n\tSuperman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and Hawkgirl gather around and join hands. Batman remains across the room, but does state that he'll help the League when he can. It is then that they realize that Martian Manhunter is standing alone in another area of the satellite -- he wasn't even present when the other heroes made their little gesture, and they don't repeat it once J'onn joins them. \n"}]}
