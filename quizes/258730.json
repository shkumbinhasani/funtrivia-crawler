Mantle went to 12 World Series in his career with the Yankees, winning seven of them.  He hit three each in 1956, 1960, and 1964.  Mickey won the AL MVP in 1956, 1957, and 1964.  He also batted for the Triple Crown in his 1956 MVP season. \n"}, {"text": "Which Mets pitcher in 1970, set a Major League record for striking out 10 consecutive batters in a game?", "correct": "Tom Seaver", "options": ["Phil Niekro", "Ferguson Jenkins", "Milt Pappas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Seaver.\n\n\tThe others never pitched for the Mets.  April 1970 saw 'Tom Terrific' fan 19 San Diego Padres.  His consecutive 10 broke the record of 9 by Mickey Welch of Philadelphia Athletics in 1884.  Seaver went 20-10 with 289 strikeouts in 1970. \n"}, {"text": "The Oakland Athletics won 90 games and went to their third consecutive World Series in 1974.  What was strange about this team?", "correct": "They didn't have a .300 hitter in the season", "options": ["The team went through six catchers in the season", "They didn't have a 15-game winner in the season", "Nobody hit over 20 home runs in the season"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey didn't have a .300 hitter in the season\n\n\tNot only did they not have a .300 hitter, the team had the second lowest team average in the league in 1974.  Catfish Hunter went 25-12 and won the Cy Young award.  Although Vida Blue went 17-15 along with Ken Holtzman going 19-17, the Athletics had the lowest ERA as a team.  Oakland had four players that hit 20+ home runs in the season, including Gene Tenace, a steady catcher for the Athletics from 1969-1976.  Oakland won their third straight series against the Dodgers in 1974. \n"}, {"text": "This pitcher threw the first perfect game on the road in American League history.  It would begin a 34-year drought until Don Larsen threw his in 1956.  Who was this pitcher in the 1920s to throw this perfecto?", "correct": "Charlie Robertson", "options": ["Frankie Frisch", "Roger Peckinpaugh", "Pie Traynor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlie Robertson.\n\n\tRobertson was the only pitcher listed.  On April 30, 1922, Robertson of the Chicago White Sox threw the American League's fourth perfect game since 1904.  Charlie went 14-15 in the 1922 season.  The game saw Ray Schalk catching behind the plate.  It was Schalk's record fourth no-hitter that he had caught in his career. \n"}, {"text": "In the first 100 years of Major League baseball, only one pitcher threw a no-hitter in his first professional start.  Who was this American League pitcher?", "correct": "Bobo Holloman", "options": ["Bob Gibson", "Vernon Law", "Sandy Koufax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBobo Holloman.\n\n\tThe others listed were all career National League pitchers with one team.  Holloman debuted with the St. Louis Browns in 1953 and no-hit the Philadelphia Athletics.  It was Bobo's only season in the Major Leagues.  In 1967, rookie Bill Rohr of the Red Sox almost duplicated Holloman's feat.  With two out in the ninth innning in a game against the Yankees, Rohr gave up a single to Elston Howard, spoiling his no-no. \n"}, {"text": "Which team won the first ever National League Championship Series (NLCS) played in 1969?", "correct": "New York Mets", "options": ["San Diego Padres", "Cleveland Indians", "Montreal Expos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York Mets.\n\n\tBoth the Padres and Expos lost 110 games in 1969, and Cleveland was in the American League.  Expanding to 12 teams and splitting into two divisions, the new playoffs were on in 1969, with the Mets defeating the Braves three games to none.  1969 was coined as the year of the 'Amazing Mets'.  They went on to win the World Series over the Orioles in five games, after losing game one. \n"}, {"text": "What occurred in the National League from 1901-1906, that likely will never be duplicated again?", "correct": "A pitcher threw 188 consecutive complete games", "options": ["A perfect game was thrown by three different teams twice in every season", "The World Series was played in the same ballpark in those six seasons", "Every NL team hit a grand slam in each season"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pitcher threw 188 consecutive complete games.\n\n\tHome runs were not a commodity in early baseball.

In 1902 and 1903 with the Cubs, Jack started and completed 33 games in both seasons.  From 1904-1906, Taylor kept his streak alive while pitching for the St. Louis Cardinals. \n"}, {"text": "Pitcher Fred Chapman went into every baseball record book for accomplishing what?", "correct": "Being the youngest pitcher to play at the age of 14", "options": ["Was the first player in history ever fined for profanity during a game", "Was the first player that died as a result of an on-field incident", "Was the first football Heisman winner to play professional baseball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeing the youngest pitcher to play at the age of 14.\n\n\tFred Chapman pitched for the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association in 1887.  Born on November 24, 1872, he debuted on July 22, 1887.  He pitched five innings in that game, the only appearance of his career.  \r In 2009 the SABR (Society for American Baseball Research) announced that the pitcher who played his one and only game on July 22, 1887 for Philadelphia Athletics was Frank Chapman born in November 1861; and not Fred Chapman born in November 1872. It was a case of mistaken identity. \n"}, {"text": "New York Giant Mel Ott set a few records in his career, but the one he set in 1929 was a strange one for the books.  What happened on the final day of this season?", "correct": "He was walked intentionally five times", "options": ["He threw a no-hitter and was the first pitcher to hit a grand slam", "He struck out 18 batters while also walking 19 in the game", "He threw a perfect game and hit for the cycle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was walked intentionally five times.\n\n\tOtt was not a pitcher.  Going into the final game of the 1929 season and the second game of their doubleheader against the Phillies, Mel was one home run shy of tying for the league lead.  Who led the league at the time?  Chuck Klein of the same Phillies.  The Phillies pitching staff showed support for their own outfielder by walking Ott every at-bat.  Klein won the home run crown by hitting 43 in the season, and watched Ott helplessly finish second with 42.  Mel would still go on to win the home run crown six times, and retire with 511. \n"}, {"text": "In 2000, and for the first time in Major League history, no team finished above .600 or below .400 in the season.
