{"id": "382668", "name": "\"The Monster\" Trivia Game | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stranger Things"], "questions": [{"text": "Does Jonathan go through the gate in the tree?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhile Jonathan searches for Nancy, she's trapped on the other side with no way back, her only exit sealing back up upon her entry.  Jonathan finds the tree, fortunately, but Nancy is a bit stuck; the creature spots her and gives chase.  She makes it to the tunnel and reaches out and, luckily, he's able to grab her before it closes up entirely.  He watches as it seals closed, possibly ever to open again. \n"}, {"text": "After dropping Nancy off at home, where does Jonathan go?", "correct": "None of these; he stays at her house", "options": ["Home", "Back to the woods", "To his dad's place in the city"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these; he stays at her house.\n\n\tSteve and his friends head out to the woods to go look for Nancy since she never came over.  He ends up parking out front and climbing the roof to her window only to find her with Jonathan inside, having just returned from their odd encounter.\rJoyce and Hopper discuss their findings and Hopper makes note of the bedroom beneath the lab which must've been occupied by a child.  Based on the drawing they determine that it never housed Will, but it may have been the kid Hopper was looking for earlier who others say was at Benny's diner the day he died.\rNancy, taking a shower, recalls the nightmares she encountered and, returning to her room, finds Jonathan rolling out a sleeping bag.  She allows him to stay; she doesn't want to be alone.  She invites him to stay in the bed though. \n"}, {"text": "Nancy reasons that the monster is a predator and, thus, could be lured out with which of these?", "correct": "Blood", "options": ["Pheromones", "A whistle", "Noise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlood.\n\n\tThe next morning, Mike angrily takes down Eleven's fort, kicking it furiously.\rHopper ends up making a call from a payphone and drives off with Joyce.\rBack in Nancy's room, Jonathan wakes up to find Nancy already up, writing in a journal.  She didn't sleep because of what she saw.  Her thought is that, perhaps, Will and Barbara were trapped there and, possibly, eaten.  She thinks that maybe rather than searching for another gate, they can lure it out with blood.  If the theory works they can do something about it. \n"}, {"text": "According to Dustin, who wasn't at fault during the fight in the auto yard?", "correct": "Dustin", "options": ["Eleven", "Mike", "Lucas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDustin.\n\n\tMr. Clark receives a visit from someone he doesn't know, but who's definitely been showing up around town.  She claims to be a member of the Indiana A/V Club, spreading word for some new workshops, and when she asks if he knows anyone from his school who may be interested in the topic, he kindly notes that he knows a few kids.\rDustin heads to Mike's house to calm his friend down and states that he needs to be the one to extend an apology since he pushed Lucas first.  They need to go find Lucas, then they need to go find Eleven.\rEleven wakes up in the woods, having fallen asleep and stayed in hiding all night. \n"}, {"text": "What does Eleven steal from a supermarket?", "correct": "Waffles", "options": ["Bread", "Milk", "Cookies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWaffles.\n\n\tAt the Wheeler house, Karen goes upstairs to get Nancy for breakfast and, when she breaks into her room, finds the sleeping bag on the floor, but no one around; they left out the window.\rMike and Dustin head to Lucas' house, and when they arrive Mike extends a handshake.  Lucas agrees to shake, but only on the condition that they don't search for Eleven.  All three of the boys are at a bit of an intersection with this though, since some feel they all need to stick together but they don't know about Eleven's viability as a member of their group.  Lucas decides to go to the gate alone.\rEleven ends up walking back into town, ending up at a supermarket and receiving looks from all the patrons.  Walking the aisles she remembers another sensory deprivation experiment in which she was encouraged to locate the thing in her vision.  The police are called when she walks out with boxes of Eggo waffles, smashing a window to make her exit. \n"}, {"text": "What is Eleven's real name?", "correct": "Jane", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJane.\n\n\tHopper and Joyce reach their destination-- the house of Teri Ives.  Her sister reaches the door and informs them that Teri isn't really in a state to talk, and hasn't been for five years.  Teri refuses to speak, even when they bring up Dr. Brenner.  Her sister explains that Teri was a part of the MKUltra program with the CIA.  They gave her drugs and put her into isolation tanks during her time there to 'expand the boundaries of her mind'.  She didn't know she was pregnant at the time...but she miscarried in the third trimester. Nonetheless, Teri believes her daughter will come back to her, after twelve years, and that she has powers. \n"}, {"text": "What odd item do Nancy and Jonathan purchase at the hunting store?", "correct": "Bear trap", "options": ["Tent", "Rifle", "Flare gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBear trap.\n\n\tAs Lucas leaves his house, the man from the power company waves to him.  He reaches the fence for the restricted area, realizing, as per his compass, that he'll need to get inside to get closer.\rMike and Dustin talk about Lucas being jealous because Eleven came into the picture, but their conversation about friendship is cut short when they ride past the supermarket to see the chaos.\rJonathan and Nancy, meanwhile, head to the hunting store to purchase supplies.  Amongst them are a gas can, ammunition, and a bear trap. \n"}, {"text": "A fistfight between Steve and Jonathan ends with which of these?", "correct": "Jonathan in cuffs", "options": ["Steve receiving stitches", "A dead body", "A burned down building"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJonathan in cuffs.\n\n\tWhile Nancy and Jonathan load his trunk with their new purchases, a high schooler drives by and says he can't wait to see her movie.  This confuses the two until Nancy realizes there must be something wrong at the movie theater.  She arrives to find her name scrawled on the marquee in a derogatory fashion, clearly a prank from Steve.\rShe finds him and the others in the alley next door and slaps him in the face.  Steve comments that he's done with Nancy and, before they know it, there's a fist fight between him and Jonathan.  The cops are around the corner in no time and Jonathan is cuffed and put into a cop car. \n"}, {"text": "What does Lucas find in the perimeter of the Hawkins lab property?", "correct": "Power trucks", "options": ["An electromagnet", "A monster", "A cemetery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPower trucks.\n\n\tOn their way out of the Ives household, Joyce takes one last look at Teri and leaves with Hopper.  In the car they get a call on the radio from the station; Jonathan is in their custody.\rAt the station, Flo, the secretary, suggests that Nancy and Jonathan are likely in love because only love makes people do something that stupid.  While she brings out the ice, it becomes apparent that Nancy will be able to leave, but Jonathan likely won't since he assaulted a police officer during the scuffle.\rIn the woods, Mike and Dustin shout for Eleven who, in fairness, is nearby.  They're met instead by their bullies who, now with a knife, chase them through the trees.\rLucas finds an anomaly in his search.  Reaching the corner of the fence he finds that the compass turns inward.  Climbing a tree and donning his binoculars he finds a number of power company trucks parked out front of the lab. \n"}, {"text": "To save Dustin, Mike is told to jump off a cliff.  Does he jump?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe boys run and find a road, but end up getting themselves cornered by the side of a cliff.  Dustin is held at knifepoint, but Mike is told his friend will be spared if he jumps off the edge and into the water of the gorge, surely a fatal fall.  He stands at the edge and actually makes the leap, but when the boys look over, he's held in place...and lifted back to the road.  Eleven pushes one bully down and breaks the other's arm with her mind before they run off.  She collapses soon after.\rIn a memory, Eleven walks through the darkness to see the creature in the distance, feeding on something.  Reaching out to touch it she grabs its attention and, in doing so, creates a crack in the wall of the lab.\rWhen she wakes up, she tells Mike that she's sorry.  She opened up the gate.\rThe boys, now with Eleven in tow, head back out of the woods and back home.  They're watched by the man in the power truck though.  Lucas watches as they drive off to the suburbs, making it out in time to intercept. \n"}]}
