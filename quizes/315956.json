I cannot believe the size of that chin, or that nose!  I think he was the host of \"The Tonight Show\" from 1992 to 2009.  I wonder who this comedian could be?", "correct": "Jay Leno", "options": ["David Letterman", "Conan O'Brien", "Johnny Carson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJay Leno.\n\n\tJay Leno was born on April 28, 1950.  He began hosting \"The Tonight Show\" in 1992, and hosted until 2009.  He replaced Johnny Carson as host and was, in turn, replaced by Conan O'Brien.  In September of 2009, he began hosting a primetime comedy show, with much of his same comedic skits from \"The Tonight Show\".  Appropriately, it was called \"The Jay Leno Show\".  Leno has also guest starred in several different television shows, including \"Home Improvement\" and \"The Nanny\".  He is well known for having a large chin, and others also believe he has a large nose as well. \n"}, {"text": "Oh, great, I found my way into another sandwich!  From here, all I can see is this guy's chin.  There seems to be a little scar there.  I think, if I remember correctly, there was a movie where they show the main character when he was a kid, and it showed how he got most of what he was known for, including that scar.  I do believe River Phoenix played him as a young teenager.  Who is this actor?", "correct": "Harrison Ford", "options": ["George Clooney", "Sean Connery", "Tom Cruise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarrison Ford.\n\n\tHarrison Ford was born on July 13th, 1942.  He was most known for playing Han Solo from the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, and as the main character from the \"Indiana Jones\" trilogy.  The first \"Indiana Jones\" film, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", was released in 1981.  In 1984, the second of these films was released, and in 1989, the third of the original trilogy was released. It wasn't until 2008 that the fourth of the movie series came out, and it brought back an old love interest of Indy's, Marion.  Marion was also his love interest from the first movie.  In \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", we saw River Phoenix play Indy as a teenager. Here was where we saw young Indy get his famous hat and whip, how he became afraid of snakes, and even how he got the scar on his chin.  He got the scar by trying to tame a lion using the whip.  Sean Connery played Indy's father in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Wow, look at that nice black, wavy hair.  I bet the ladies went crazy over him.  He had a weird thing going on with his lip, though.  He had it extending up, or something.  He seemed to have been pretty famous.  I just have one question, though.  Why did he choose a peanut butter sandwich with fruit over me?  Who might this have been?", "correct": "Elvis Presley", "options": ["Marty Robbins", "Frank Sinatra", "Bruce Springsteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElvis Presley.\n\n\tElvis was born in 1935, and died in 1977.  Elvis Presley was known as the greatest rock and roll singer of all time.  Therefore, he was often called \"King of Rock and Roll\".  Of course, he did not only sing rock and roll.  He also sang R&B, blues, pop, gospel, country, and rockabilly.  He was well known for his hair, lip, clothing, and dance moves, in addition to his singing. Some of his songs included \"All Shook Up\", \"Hound Dog\", \"Jailhouse Rock\", and \"Teddy Bear\".  Of course, you could go on for hours listing his songs.  He was also famous for eating fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches. \n"}, {"text": "Hmmm, I thought this guy was darker skinned.  Oh well, he was a great singer, anyway.  It did feel odd to have him hold me with both hands, because only one had a white glove on it!  How bizarre.  But for some reason, I felt like dancing like a zombie...  Who could have eaten me now?", "correct": "Michael Jackson", "options": ["John Lennon", "Louie Armstrong", "Jimi Hendrix"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Jackson.\n\n\tMichael Jackson was born in 1958, and died in 2009.  When Michael was a kid, he was in the Jackson Five.  There were two theories as to why he got lighter skinned.  One, a rare disease that causes the skin to turn lighter, and two, plastic surgery.  Of course, some suggest that both may have been causes of Michael Jackson's famous \"race change\".  Michael Jackson was often called the \"King of Pop\", and had hits such as \"Thriller\", noted to be an expensive music video with a very famous zombie dance, \"Beat It\", and \"Billie Jean\".  He had also popularized different dance steps, including the robot and the moonwalk, and, of course, the zombie dance. \n"}, {"text": "Whoa!  Those were some fuzzy eyebrows, and that was a huge mustache...  Oh wait, they were fake.  Hey, with those spectacles, it reminded me of a pair of goofy glasses I had at home...  Aah, wait, don't eat me!\n\nWho was well known for his eyebrows, mustache, and glasses, which have become a popular \"mask\" today?", "correct": "Groucho Marx", "options": ["Zeppo Marx", "Chico Marx", "Harpo Marx"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGroucho Marx.\n\n\tThese Marx's were all brothers.  Zeppo was in a total of five Marx Brothers movies, while the other three were in all thirteen.  They had another brother, Gummo, who was not in any movie.  Groucho was born in 1890, and died in 1977.  Chico was born in 1887, and died in 1961, Harpo was born in 1888 and died in 1964, Zeppo was born in 1901, the only to be born in the 20th century, and died in 1979. Gummo was born in 1893 and died in 1977.  Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Zeppo, and Gummo were not any of their real names, however.  For instance, Harpo played the harp, therefore, his \"name\" was Harpo.  Groucho, who's real name was Julius, was famous for his glasses and his thick, painted on eyebrows and mustache.  A pair of glasses with a plastic nose, a huge mustache and large eyebrows attached were made because of Groucho, and were appropriately called the Groucho Marx glasses.\r Did anybody else notice that \"Harpo\" spelled backwards is \"Oprah\"?  Just saying... \n"}, {"text": "You know, I'm pretty sure this singer had a thing for his hair.  He especially had a thing for his hair in his younger days.  He even had a song about wanting his mullet back!  But I certainly didn't want him to be the jaws of my defeat.  I was a lonely salami that wanted to keep living.  Who is Hannah Montana's daddy?", "correct": "Billy Ray Cyrus", "options": ["Aaron Tippin", "Alan Jackson", "Tim McGraw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus.\n\n\tBilly Ray Cyrus was born in 1961.  His daughter, Miley Cyrus, who was the alter ego of Hannah Montana, was born in 1992.  Billy Ray Cyrus was well known in the 90s for many songs, especially \"Achy Breaky Heart\".  When this song was released, his daughter was also born.  What an awesome year that had been for Cyrus!  In 2006, he released his album \"Wanna Be Your Joe\".  In \"I Want My Mullet Back\", Cyrus sang of wanting to be in the older times, from having his old girlfriend, to having his old hair and old car back. He also sang many of his songs from this album with his daughter, Miley, including \"Stand\". \n"}, {"text": "Wow, look at that nose.  It isn't just big, it is oddly shaped, too.  It seemed a lot of people tended to make fun of this singer because of her nose, and quite a bit of people did not like her singing.  Of course, Fran Fine from \"The Nanny\" just loved her.  You know, I think she starred in \"Yentl\".  Now I want to start singing \"Evergreen\", which won her a Grammy in 1977 for the Song of the Year!  Who is this star?", "correct": "Barbra Streisand", "options": ["Tina Turner", "Celine Dion", "Aretha Franklin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarbra Streisand.\n\n\tBarbra Streisand was born in 1942.

This guy is holding me with very sharp, scissor-like hands!  But he looks like a pirate.  He is wearing a red bandanna on his head, and he has a lot of jewelry in his hair.  He seems to be wearing a lot of makeup on his eyes, too.  I expect him to say \"Arrr!\", but instead he keeps saying \"Savvy?\"  That is so weird.  But based on his face and hands, I would say he is wearing two different costumes, each for a character from a different movie.  Who might this be?", "correct": "Johnny Depp", "options": ["Jackie Chan", "Jamie Foxx", "John Travolta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Depp.\n\n\tJohnny Depp, who was born in 1963, is known for playing odd characters.

Oh yes!  \"You can't handle the truth!\"  It seemed this actor was very famous for those dark sunglasses he was wearing.  I wonder what he looks like without them.  What DO his eyes look like?  Here's Johnny!  Who might be eating Salami now?", "correct": "Jack Nicholson", "options": ["Clint Eastwood", "Dustin Hoffman", "Gene Kelly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Nicholson.\n\n\tJack Nicholson was born in 1937.

This guy has a really big head...and I mean huge!  I think on his self titled show, a lot of people made fun of its massive size.  On the show, his son, Max, was diagnosed with a similar kidney disease that he himself had, if I remember correctly.  His show was on ABC, then moved to 'Nick at Nite' in the US with reruns.  On his show, he also had a wife named Angie, a daughter named Carmen, and a mother with the same name as his grandmother, Benita.  Who is this comedian?", "correct": "George Lopez", "options": ["Drew Carrey", "Tim Allen", "Jeff Foxworthy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Lopez.\n\n\tGeorge Lopez's show, \"George Lopez\" aired from 2002 to 2007 on ABC.  It was moved to 'Nick at Nite', where repeats were shown along with other sitcoms, such as \"Home Improvement\" and \"Family Matters\".  It was in 2000 that Sandra Bullock told Lopez that there was a need for Hispanic sitcoms, which was why his show \"George Lopez\" began two years later. Sandra Bullock occassionally guest starred as a clumsy employee of the Power Brothers Plant, the fictional airplane parts factory on the show.  George Lopez has also written a best-selling autobiography entitled \"Why You Crying\".  He has also appeared in several movies, including the 2005 \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\".
