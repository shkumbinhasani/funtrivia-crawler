{"id": "359060", "name": "Dead Space 2 Multiple Choice Quiz | Dead Space | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games D-F", "Dead Space"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Dead Space 2\" is set on 'The Sprawl', a location orbiting which celestial body?", "correct": "Titan", "options": ["Mars", "Ganymede", "Earth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTitan.\n\n\tAt this point in the timeline, planet-cracking has become the norm to attain minerals in space.  Titan, one of Saturn's moons, was the first satellite to be cracked and, in the wake of this event, the Sprawl spacecraft remained active as a permanent residence orbiting the last fragments of the moon.\rAfter the...erm...issue on the USG Ishimura (as seen in \"Dead Space\"), Isaac was brought to the Sprawl, now a research facility and home base for planet-cracking operations.  Why?  He doesn't know.  By the time he awakens from cryo-sleep and drug-induced hazes, Necromorphs have already overrun the station. \n"}, {"text": "Heading to Cassini Towers to meet with Daina, Isaac ends up getting stuck inside what crashing vehicle?", "correct": "Train", "options": ["Space shuttle", "Bus", "Go kart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrain.\n\n\tWakin' up was hard to do for poor Isaac Clarke.  After his escape craft was found floating in space after the events of \"Dead Space\" he was brought to the Sprawl, a large craft orbiting Titan for further investigation.  He spent three years there participating in strict tests.  He is awakened after the Necromorphs begin to take over and, after fleeing the asylum, he is told by a woman named Daina Le Guin to head through the residential areas to find her-- she has something he needs to stop the psychological effects of the marker from Aegis VII.  I guess it doesn't help that he's seeing ghostly images of Nicole everywhere...\rAfter passing through Titan Heights and reaching a tram station (obviously not a clear path), Isaac needs to travel to Cassini Heights to find Daina.  This is, of course, marred by a gunship attack (from Director Hans Tiedemann's craft) ultimately leading him to the Church of Unitology.  You know.  The one that religiously follows the marker.  All the while, Isaac is given cryptic messages from Nolan Stross, another person whose been in contact with a marker. \n"}, {"text": "In Chapter 5, Daina reveals herself to be which of these?", "correct": "A Unitologist", "options": ["A government agent", "A computer program", "A hivemind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Unitologist.\n\n\tUgh...aren't the people who seem helpful always backstabbers?  Amongst the cast of characters in \"Dead Space 2\", Daina sets herself up as an early friend and an early enemy-- she's killed at the end of the first third of the game.  Nonetheless, she serves to show Isaac why he was brought to The Sprawl anyways-- to give the Unitologists all the info they would need to proliferate and converge.\rNot all of the Sprawl citizens are evil though-- Nolan Strauss, though a bit crazy, seems to have Isaac's best interests in mind; Ellie Langford does too, but it takes  while for her to warm up to Isaac considering the tendencies of everyone else around her. \n"}, {"text": "In Chapter 6, Isaac proceeds from Cassini Towers into what frightening locale?", "correct": "A school", "options": ["A shopping mall", "A church", "A graveyard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA school.\n\n\tHeading to the Church of Unitology to meet with Daina, Isaac ends up continuing his trek beginning with a search through the chambers and antechambers and continuing down into the crypt and cryo chambers beneath the structure.  This culminates with a meeting with Daina and her goons who hold onto Isaac and plan to put him into cryo-sleep to create new markers at a later date, spreading convergence.  The meeting is interrupted, however, when a gunship shoots through the windows, killing the guards and leaving Isaac to face off against the Tormentor inside and out in space.  When he blasts through the creature he ends up back in Cassini Towers...again.\rWhen Isaac regains his composure, Nolan Strauss tells him to head to the Government Sector but, after taking a trip through the Sprawl's disturbing primary school, Nolan ends up in the hands of Ellie.  Time is running out to get through the Government Sector though, so there's no time to waste. \n"}, {"text": "One of the earliest new enemies in the game, what collective group of Necromorphs mutated from children on the Sprawl?", "correct": "The Pack", "options": ["The Corruption", "Nests", "Cysts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Pack.\n\n\tWhen Isaac took on the Necromorphs on the USG Ishimura he only had to deal with certain types derived from the mining staff and operators onboard.  Now, on the Sprawl, a whole new host of enemies awaits the hero from children to miners to researchers to sacrificial Unitologists.  Early on, when Isaac heads to the shopping center near Cassini Towers, he ends up meeting The Pack for the first time. These creatures, low-to-the-ground, attack Isaac with their claws and in large groups.  They don't take much to kill, but darn it, they're annoying.  They come out in droves in the elementary school, go figure. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout Chapters 7, 8, and 9, all feature which type of environments requiring Isaac to use RIG thrusters?", "correct": "Zero-G", "options": ["Superheated", "Airless", "Underwater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZero-G.\n\n\tChapter 7 of the game takes Isaac, Ellie, and Strauss through Titan Station's Solar Array and Fuel Processing Area on their way to the Government Sector and, unsurprisingly, it turns out to be one of the most dangerous sections yet.  By realigning the dishes towards the center unit while floating in the Zero-G environment of space, he can power up the station once again.  Unfortunately this is used against the protagonists later on in Chapter 9 when the beams of the array are realigned to destroy their tram rail.  This is preceded by the customary Zero-G float through the grinding, chopping, and flame-shooting bowels of the fuel processing center.  It's not a safe place.\rWhen the tram becomes unusable, Isaac decides that the only way to reach the Government Sector after this point is by taking a detour through none other than the USG Ishimura.  Of course. \n"}, {"text": "Which weapon makes its debut appearance in \"Dead Space 2\"?", "correct": "Javelin Gun", "options": ["Plasma Cutter", "Pulse Rifle", "Line Gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJavelin Gun.\n\n\tWhile all of the weapons used in the original \"Dead Space\" were used primarily for mining purposes on the surface of the Aegis VII (and the USG Ishimura), some of the introduced weapons in \"Dead Space 2\" are simply handy additions to Isaac's arsenal (should you opt to use them).  The Javelin Gun, for instance, is what it is-- it shoots high-powered javelins, impaling enemies and taking off limbs. The Detonator leaves explosive mines for enemies to run into while the Seeker Rifle allows you to fire homing shots.  Many weapons including the Ripper, the Contact Beam, and the Force Gun make their reappearances in this game. \n"}, {"text": "When Isaac has to revisit the USG Ishimura, which section of the ship is not encountered?", "correct": "The Hydroponics Deck", "options": ["The Cooling Core", "The Medical Deck", "The Bridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hydroponics Deck.\n\n\tWhen Isaac has no choice but to make his way through the USG Ishimura he ends up crossing through the Cooling Core, the Medical Deck, and the Bridge in his journey to sever the gravity tethers holding the nightmarish mining ship to Titan Station.  While Isaac uses an escape pod to return to Titan, Ellie is attacked by Strauss, still hallucinating.  Now, en route to the Government Sector, Isaac has to head through the Mining Complex to save Ellie.\rHeading through the Mining Complex, Isaac has no choice but to kill Strauss to save himself.  He later finds Ellie, missing one eye, deeper into the facility.  The two, luckily, get a break when they find a giant mining machine which they use to reach the Government Sector...finally.  Once there, Ellie locates a docked gunship and Isaac, afraid of losing someone else, turns on the craft and sends her away from Titan Station. \n"}, {"text": "To access knowledge of how to destroy the Marker, Isaac must do which of the following?", "correct": "Have a needle inserted through his eye into his brain", "options": ["Perform a full frontal lobotomy", "Remove his genetic code", "Become a Necromorph and, through blood transfusions, revert back to a human form"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHave a needle inserted through his eye into his brain.\n\n\tOnce Isaac starts navigating his way through the Government Sector he has no choice but to cut the power to get past Tiedemann's men (the type of men with laser scopes).  This, of course, releases all of the Necromorphs into the previously cordoned-off sector, slaughtering everyone unimportant and transforming them into more dangerous foes. When Isaac finally reaches the Marker, Tiedemann informs him that none of this was supposed to happen; things are getting out of hand.  Isaac opts to use a nearby Noontech Diagnostic Machine to insert a needle into his eye (and into his brain) to help information in his brain emerge and, ultimately, help him destroy the Marker he helped create. What follows is a race down to the Marker.  This includes several confrontations with unkillable Necromorphs, most of which you must incapacitate by chopping in half and using Stasis to stall.  Eventually, when Isaac begins hallucinating again, you know you're close. \n"}, {"text": "In the final battle of the game, who of these turns out to be a traitor?", "correct": "Nicole", "options": ["Tiedemann", "Ellie", "Strauss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNicole.\n\n\tIn the end of the final chapter, Isaac will race towards the Marker, finally coming across a slowly transforming Tiedemann and his Javelin Gun.  Although Tiedemann will get a few shots off, Isaac will wrestle him down and put an end to the human antagonist.  When this is done, he'll head to a vision of Nicole who will thank Isaac for all he's done and reveal the truth-- the Marker brought him here to kill him and complete the final stage of its rebirth, the death of its creator.  The final battle is in Isaac's mind; he must face off against both Nicole's image and the Marker (and Necromorphs), destroying its beating heart.  When this is done, the threat on Titan will begin to collapse around him and he'll crumble to the ground.\rIt's not over though.  Ellie breaks through the ceiling in her gunship forcing Isaac to chase it down in Zero-G.  When he makes it inside, with Ellie's help, the two can finally escape. \n"}]}
