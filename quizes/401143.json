{"id": "401143", "name": "People of Progressive Rock Quiz | Bands and Musical Acts | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "Bands and Musical Acts", "Supergroups and Artist Movement"], "questions": [{"text": "One of the founding members of Yes, this bassist was the only member who was never fired and never quit the group (barring their brief disbandment in the early 80s) until his death in 2015; somehow, he still found time for side projects including such people as Steve Hackett, Billy Sherwood, and Jimmy Page. What's his name?", "correct": "Chris Squire", "options": ["Billy Squier", "Mike Rutherford", "Peter Banks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChris Squire.\n\n\tChris Squire played bass and sang backing vocal for Yes from their founding in 1968 until his death in 2015; he was posthumously inducted with them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017. Geddy Lee of Rush filled in on bass for their performance of \"Roundabout.\" Squire formed the group Squackett with Genesis' Steve Hackett, XYZ (Ex members of Yes and Zeppelin) with drummer Alan White and Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. Billy Sherwood worked with Squire on The Chris Squire Experiment and Conspiracy before being personally asked to replace him in Yes when his health declined. \n"}, {"text": "The second drummer for Genesis famously took over singing duties for Peter Gabriel when he parted ways with the band to begin a solo career - as it happened, he, too, later left the band for the same reason. He also played a bit for George Harrison, Thin Lizzy, Brian Eno, and, of course, Peter Gabriel. Who is he?", "correct": "Phil Collins", "options": ["Bill Bruford", "Alan White", "Neil Peart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhil Collins.\n\n\tPhil Collins and Peter Gabriel, while working on the latter's third solo album, accidentally developed the method of gated reverb in percussion recording which Collins would use to great effect on \"In The Air Tonight\" the next year. George Harrison acknowledged Collins' efforts on \"All Things Must Pass\" when it was remastered in 2000, Thin Lizzy's album \"Johnny The Fox\" featured Collins on drums throughout, and Brian Eno had Collins on the album \"Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)\". \n"}, {"text": "Following the release of their 1978 album \"Tormato\", Yes lost their lead singer and keyboardist; luckily for the remaining members, they came in contact with Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, a singer and keyboardist who happened to be familiar with Yes. What was the name of Horne and Downes' band, of which they were the only members?", "correct": "The Buggles", "options": ["The Crickets", "The Bangles", "Traffic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Buggles.\n\n\tThe Buggles are best remembered for their hit single \"Video Killed The Radio Star;\" famously, it was also the first video to air on MTV. Horn and Downes joined Yes on their 1980 album \"Drama\" before the group disbanded entirely; Horn would produce Yes' comeback album \"90125\" three years later, while Downes went on to join Asia (though he has worked with Yes since). \n"}, {"text": "Greg Lake and John Wetton were both members of King Crimson and Asia, but neither band ever featured both musicians at the same time.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tGreg Lake was King Crimson's lead singer on their debut album; he later founded Emerson, Lake, and Palmer with Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer. John Wetton was invited to join as bassist shortly after Lake's departure and, ten years later, served as Asia's bandleader - in late 1983, Wetton either left or was fired from Asia (accounts differ) and Lake replaced him as a favor to drummer Carl Palmer just in time for the \"Asia in Asia\" concert; Wetton rejoined after Lake quit. \n"}, {"text": "Though Rush formed in 1968, they didn't release their debut album until 1974. Their first lineup consisted of drummer John Rutsey, guitarist Alex Lifeson, and this bassist, who only ever played their first show before quitting. He later joined Ocean for their 1971 hit \"Put Your Hand In The Hand\" and Red Rider for their 1981 hit \"Lunatic Fringe.\" What's his name?", "correct": "Jeff Jones", "options": ["Geddy Lee", "Kim Mitchell", "Tom Cochrane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeff Jones.\n\n\tFollowing their first performance, Lifeson called Geddy Lee to join for their second. The period between 1968 and 1975 in Rush's career is as interesting as it is tumultuous; thankfully, they never changed their lineup again after that. Rush and Red Rider played a concert together in the summer of 1981, and I'd kill to know what it was like backstage. \n"}, {"text": "More than 20 musicians have appeared on this British band's albums credited as members; their live performances, though, have included musicians as diverse as Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath and Phil Collins of Genesis. The only member to appear on every studio release is vocalist, guitarist, and flautist Ian Anderson. What band is this, known for \"Aqualung\" and \"Thick As A Brick?\"", "correct": "Jethro Tull", "options": ["Yes", "Deep Purple", "Porcupine Tree"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJethro Tull.\n\n\tJethro Tull started out their career playing gigs around England and changing their name every time; whenever a venue invited them back to play again, they decided, the name they'd used there would be permanent. Their manager, who suggested the lucky name, was very into agriculture, so they're forever stuck being named for the inventor of the horse-drawn seed drill. \n"}, {"text": "This former member of Roxy Music went on to produce for Talking Heads, pioneer the genre of ambient music, and compose the Windows startup theme. What is his name? He's got a lot of middle names - for everyone's sake, do not include them in your answer.", "correct": "Brian Eno & Eno", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrian Eno & Eno.\n\n\tOther members of Roxy Music included John Wetton and Phil Manzanera. Brian Eno produced \"Remain In Light\" and \"Speaking In Tongues\" for Talking Heads in the 80s, and his 1978 album \"Music For Airports\" was the first to be explicitly called \"ambient.\" Microsoft commissioned him specifically for the Windows startup theme, for which he composed more than 80 options... on a Mac. \n"}, {"text": "Originally the lead singer of The Nazz, this musician is best remembered for his solo hits \"I Saw The Light\" and \"Bang The Drum All Day.\" He also produced albums for such artists as Hall & Oates, Meatloaf, and XTC. One of his lesser known projects is the progressive rock band Utopia (though they, too, had their pop hits later on). What is his name?", "correct": "Todd Rundgren", "options": ["Tony Banks", "Marvin Lee Aday", "Robert Fripp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTodd Rundgren.\n\n\tAfter leaving The Nazz, Todd Rundgren released one album with the group Runt before definitively becoming a solo artist; every subsequent re-release of that album has credited Rundgren as the artist and \"Runt\" as the album name. Rundgren produced Meatloaf's debut \"Bat Out of Hell\" in 1977, putting the singer in the public eye; he's also produced for Patti Smith, Badfinger, Sparks, and Grand Funk Railroad. \n"}, {"text": "In 1994, this Swiss keyboardist embarked on the \"Coming Home America Tour\" during which anyone with $800 and a venue could book him for a show from his website. In 1974, he'd played for Yes on their album \"Relayer\" and then joined the Moody Blues when Yes fired him to make room for Rick Wakeman. What's his name?", "correct": "Patrick Moraz", "options": ["Oliver Wakeman", "Tony Kaye", "Tony Banks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatrick Moraz.\n\n\tPatrick Moraz didn't catch a clean break from either of the famous groups he played with - as mentioned above, he was fired from Yes as soon as Wakeman expressed an interest in returning (he, too, caused a messy breakup in 1973), and he would sue the Moody Blues for wrongful dismissal in 1991 when they claimed that he was a hired musician and not a permanent member despite having been listed as one on their albums since the 70s; they never again brought on a permanent keyboardist and went so far as to edit Moraz out of band photos. Talk about petty! \n"}, {"text": "Pink Floyd's David Gilmour is credited with discovering this artist and producing her first album in 1978; her debut single, \"Wuthering Heights,\" was the first song written and performed by a female British solo artist to debut at #1.

What's her name?", "correct": "Kate Bush", "options": ["Patti Smith", "Annie Lennox", "Stevie Nicks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKate Bush.\n\n\tBush's 1985 album \"Hounds of Love\" was the first by a British female solo artist to reach or debut at number one; at the time she released it, she was not yet 30.

In 2014, Bush began performing concerts for the first time since 1979. \n"}, {"text": "Along with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, this musician was a member of the Traveling Wilburys. He produced Petty's \"Full Moon Fever,\" Harrison's \"Cloud Nine,\" and Orbison's \"King of Hearts,\" along with albums for Paul McCartney, Regina Spektor, Brian Wilson, and others. He is best remembered, though, as the big-haired, sunglasses-wearing bandleader of the Electric Light Orchestra. What is his name?", "correct": "Jeff Lynne", "options": ["Alan White", "John Lennon", "Roger Taylor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeff Lynne.\n\n\tThe Wilburys came about as a result of the studio wanting a B-side to a single from \"Cloud Nine;\" a series of coincidences brought the quintet together, and the studio insisted that their song, \"Handle With Care,\" be released as an A-side with an album to support it. Lynne is credited with the name, stemming from a joke he and Harrison shared in the studio - errors in the recording were often met with Lynne saying \"we'll bury it in the mix,\" leading to such mistakes (and then the band) being called Wilburys.The Electric Light Orchestra is best remembered for \"Mister Blue Sky,\" \"Evil Woman,\" and other such pop hits, though they also created such progressive rock concept albums as \"Time\" and \"Eldorado.\" \n"}, {"text": "Before embarking on a \"project\" of his own, this man produced Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon\" and Al Stewart's \"Year of the Cat;\" he also famously worked as an engineer on The Beatles' \"Abbey Road.\" While the band with which he is most famously associated bears his name, he only ever performed vocals on one song through a vocoder (\"The Raven,\" from \"Tales of Mystery and Imagination,\" 1976). What is his name?", "correct": "Alan Parsons", "options": ["Todd Rundgren", "Billy Sherwood", "Phil Spector"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlan Parsons.\n\n\tThe only two regular members of the Alan Parsons Project were Parsons himself and collaborator Eric Woolfson. While Parsons only ever sang half of one song (sharing vocals with Leonard Whiting, who is better remembered for having played Romeo in 1969's \"Romeo and Juliet\"), Eric Woolfson sang lead vocal on many of the group's biggest hits, including the title track of Eye In The Sky. \"Sirius,\" the opening track from the same album, can be heard to this day in commercials and at sporting events - it was Ricky Steamboat's entrance theme through most of the '80s. \n"}, {"text": "Yes' 1991 album \"Union,\" the result of a merger between the bands Yes and Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (the four of whom were former Yes members), saw four of the band's five founding members reunited for the first time since 1970: Jon Anderson, Tony Kaye, Bill Bruford, and Chris Squire. The fifth founding member had left the band following their second album and been replaced by Steve Howe. What was his name?", "correct": "Peter Banks", "options": ["Jason Cropper", "Peter Gabriel", "Tony Banks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter Banks.\n\n\tPeter Banks played with Chris Squire in The Syn and Mabel Greer's Toyshop, both of which are considered precursors to Yes. It is unclear whether Banks played the encore Tony Kaye invited him to on the 1991 Union tour, though he claims to have been told that Steve Howe did not want him to play, which Howe denies. Banks quit the band in 1970 following the incorporation of orchestral strings into their instrumentation. \n"}, {"text": "This drummer's work with Steely Dan and Boz Scaggs made him one of the most acclaimed session musicians of the 1980s, drumming for Pink Floyd on their song \"Mother,\" Jon Anderson's album \"In The City of Angels,\" Roger Hodgson's album \"Hai Hai,\" and Roger Waters' song \"It's A Miracle,\" among many, many others. Name him, the original drummer for Toto.", "correct": "Jeff Porcaro", "options": ["Steve Lukather", "Don Henley", "Ginger Baker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeff Porcaro.\n\n\tPorcaro's most discussed drum track has always been \"Rosanna\" from Toto IV for its effectiveness and its difficulty. Before his death at the age of 38, he also worked with Rod Stewart, Cher, Madonna, Paul McCartney, and Michael Jackson (that's him on \"Beat It\"), among still many others. \n"}, {"text": "From Genesis' formation in 1967 up to 2019, two members never quit the band and were never fired. One of them is keyboardist Tony Banks; who is the other,  the guitarist who also served as the bandleader of Mike and the Mechanics?", "correct": "Mike Rutherford & Rutherford", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike Rutherford & Rutherford.\n\n\tPeter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, and Phil Collins, the most famous members of Genesis' progressive-rock era, all departed from the band at one point or another; of these three, only Collins has returned as a member. Founding guitarist Anthony Phillips left in 1970 following the release of the album \"Trespass\" and never returned; Hackett, too, left following 1977's \"Seconds Out.\" Founding drummer John Silver didn't make it past the first album. \n"}]}
