{"id": "387948", "name": "10 Average Questions about It", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Stephen King", "IT"], "questions": [{"text": "Which member of The Losers Club does not return to Derry?", "correct": "Stanley Uris", "options": ["Beverly Marsh", "Ben Hanscom", "Richie Tozier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStanley Uris.\n\n\tOver the course of a night, six of the seven members of the Losers Club are contacted by their seventh because, after twenty-seven years, it's time for them to reunite and face the horrible thing that they last encountered in their youths.  As the murders recommence in Derry, Maine, each of those receiving the call realizes that they seemed to have blocked out that time in their lives, more than two decades earlier, when they came face-to-face with an evil that seemed unbeatable. Stanley Uris certainly thought so; he kills himself, committing suicide in his Atlanta house by slitting his wrists in his bathtub to avoid going face-to-face against It. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the bully responsible for terrorizing The Losers Club?", "correct": "Henry Bower", "options": ["Belch Huggins", "Victor Criss", "John Merrill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry Bower.\n\n\tThe start of the Losers Club seemed to be after the death of Bill's brother, Georgie, and after the children of Derry, at least those in the club, started encountering It for the first time.  Ben remembers times between his fleeing from school bully Henry Bower when he saw something on the frozen river in Derry-- not a clown, like many of the others, but a mummy, travelling unnaturally fast on the ice towards him as he ran.  And while Ben may have been one of the first to have issues with Henry, all of the others seemed to as well. \n"}, {"text": "Where did the boys of the Losers Club build the dam?", "correct": "The Barrens", "options": ["The school", "The Junkyard", "Bill's house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Barrens.\n\n\tBen ran into Bill and Eddie for the first time when they were in the Barrens as he was fleeing from Henry Bowers and the bullies.  Because of their decision to hide him, he decided to help them build their dam in the creek in the woods, using his engineering knowledge (for which he would later become famous) to successfully divert the stream.  Mr. Nell, a local Irish cop, later found them and informed them of the damage they could be doing to the local sewer system.\r Eddie, meanwhile, explored the abandoned house at 29 Neibolt Street only to encounter It for the first time, seeing It in the form of a leper under the patio. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Bill's slingshot?", "correct": "Bullseye", "options": ["Blade", "Silver", "Bullet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBullseye.\n\n\tThe events in Derry continued to unfold at an alarming pace as the Losers Club united.  Bill and Richie realized the severity of their situations when they looked through Georgie's photo album.  Ben, Richie, and Beverly beat Henry Bowers after a trip to the movies, but Bev couldn't seem to face the blood that bubbled up from her bathroom sink. Bill and Richie headed to the house on Neibolt Street and encountered It in person, only beating it with Bill's slingshot (Bullseye) and Richie's sneezing powder.  Meanwhile, Stan found It in the Standpipe during a birdwatching expedition, only escaping by shouting bird names at the creature. \n"}, {"text": "The Losers Club reunites in Derry at which of these locations?", "correct": "Asian restaurant", "options": ["Abandoned property", "Library", "Clubhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsian restaurant.\n\n\tThe Losers Club reunites in their adulthood at the Jade of the Orient restaurant in Derry (missing only one).  Although Mike Hanlon, who called them all back to Maine, is aware of what they had to do to stop It many years before in 1958, the others do not yet recall the sordid events of their past.  Mike doesn't rush them though in case it tips them over the edge like it did for Stanley. But they need to act fast, they realize, since there have already been nine murders on this round of the cycle.  Despite the fact that their circle is broken by Stanley's death, they might be enough to weaken or kill It.  As they depart though, they realize that It knows they're back in Derry; they open their fortune cookies to find horrifying things inside. \n"}, {"text": "Bill ends up finding his old bike, Silver, in which location?", "correct": "A secondhand store", "options": ["A garage", "The school", "His old house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA secondhand store.\n\n\tThe six head off to their most memorable spots in Derry to see what they can remember, and most of them find that It is lurking nearby.  Ben sees It in the library while Eddie sees It at a baseball diamond.  Bev returns home and hallucinates that the house is not quite abandoned.  Richie returns to the town's Paul Bunyan statue, where he first saw It, and It appears before him again.  Bill, however, finds a pawn shop called Secondhand Rose and repurchases his old bike, Silver, and brings it back to Mike's house.  Mike just happens to have everything he needs to fix it.\r All six realize that they probably can't defeat It as they are now, but It wants them to try.\r Elsewhere, Henry Bowers is convinced to escape prison and return to Derry.  Bev's abusive husband, Tom, tracks her back to Derry.  At the same time, Bill's wife, Audra, flies to Maine against his wishes. \n"}, {"text": "How many of the kids saw the coming of It in the smokehole?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Seven", "One", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tMike was added to the Losers Club in July 1958, filling in the circle after being chased by Henry Bowers' gang and into the path of the other Losers.  What ensued was a vicious rock fight involving Henry's M80s, but the Losers ended up victorious, filling out what they felt was their true circle with their seventh member.\r In the coming days, they would dig out a fort in the Barrens and gather with Mike's father's old photo album, realizing that It's history stretches further back than they imagined.\r Richie's story brings them back to the day they built the smokehole, suffering through the intense smoke they created in the hopes that they would see a vision and know how to defeat It.  Both he and Mike were the only ones to withstand the noxious smoke, realizing that It was something from before time itself, having arrived in the 'Ago' times. \n"}, {"text": "Who shot It with the silver slugs?", "correct": "Beverly", "options": ["Richie", "Bill", "Stan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeverly.\n\n\tAs August neared, the children got closer and closer to their confrontation with It.  Eddie, however, had a different confrontation when Henry Bowers and his group attacked him when he was on his own, breaking his arm.  The children nonetheless rebound from this attack, setting their plans into motion and combining their efforts to cast die molds and create silver slugs they can shoot using Bill's slingshot-- Bullseye. They have Beverly do this, since she has the best aim.  After a particularly horrifying event witnessed by Beverly in the scrapyard (in which bully Patrick Hocksetter was attacked by winged leeches in an abandoned fridge), the seven headed to the house on Neibolt Street, found success in their attack, and retreated, knowing that their final encounter was yet to come. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills Henry Bowers in the present day?", "correct": "Eddie", "options": ["Ben", "Mike", "Bill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEddie.\n\n\tThe remaining members of the Losers Club realize that the ancient Ritual of Ch\u00fcd is commencing once again as Beverly remembers her part of the story.  On the final day of their youth, as they would come to realize, Bev was chased out of her house by her abusive father, clearly possessed by the mind of It, and then into the path of the Bowers Gang.  She did not know that Henry had just killed his father with a switchblade, having been pushed over the edge by It as well.  The Losers Club came to find that this would be the final act.  They headed into The Barrens with the Bowers Gang in pursuit, making their way into a tunnel and downward through the darkness toward the pumping station, It's home.  Victor and Belch would barely make it through, and Henry would never catch up to them.\r In the present day, as the others head back to their rooms at the Derry Town House, Mike, remaining in the library, is attacked and nearly killed by an escaped Henry Bowers.  Henry continues on to the town house and makes his way to Eddie's room on the sixth floor, but Eddie manages to get the upper hand, killing Henry with a Perrier bottle after his arm is broken, just like when he was a kid.  The remaining five have no choice but to descend into the tunnels to confront the nightmare below. \n"}, {"text": "Although the final form of It can not be fully conceived, it is likened to which of these?", "correct": "Spider", "options": ["Dinosaur", "Turtle", "Eyeball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpider.\n\n\tThe five Losers Gang members, now without Mike amongst them, head to the tunnels they visited as children just behind Tom and Audra, both of whom were brought to It's chambers before them.  While Tom is killed instantly upon seeing It's true form, Audra is pushed over the brink, going catatonic.  The others eventually reach this final chamber though, finding It to be almost spider-like in appearance, and remembering that It was once pregnant.\r Recalling their past, they remembered that Bill was the only one to engage in the Ritual of Ch\u00fcd with It, being pulled into the far reaches of the cosmos and, almost to the deadlights, before he was warned to finish It off once and for all.  They didn't, though they were close.\r In the present day, Bill begins the ritual, but fails to latch on.  This, however, gives Richie the upper hand, and he snags on with the element of surprise, saving Bill from being cast elsewhere.  To distract It, Eddie pays the ultimate price, using his aspirator to spray into It's mouth.  This works, but Eddie's arm is bitten off and he dies shortly after.\r While Bill and Richie continue into the depths of It's lair and defeat the Eater of Worlds once and for all, Ben finds It's eggs and destroys them all.\r As kids, the seven escaped, but only after losing their innocence and vowing, in a blood circle, to return when the time was right, forgetting everything shortly thereafter.  As adults, they departed and soon forgot once again.  One by one they lost their memories of the horrible things that happened to them in Derry though, with one last ride on Silver, Bill was able to bring Audra back from the deadlights, allowing her to forget It ever happened.\r Derry would be safe from evil for now... \n"}]}
