My Captain!\"? ", "correct": "Abraham Lincoln", "options": ["Jefferson Davis", "Horace Greeley", "U.S. Grant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbraham Lincoln.\n\n\tLincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865.  Whitman who had lived in Washington D.C. during much of the Civil War was a great admirer of the President.  The poem was published in New York's 'Saturday Press' in November of 1865.

", "correct": "John Brown's Body", "options": ["Frederick Douglas: A Hero", "Benedict's Revenge", "We Shall Overcome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Brown's Body.\n\n\tBefore the war John Brown led a bloody insurgency to try to abolish slavery. President Lincoln reportedly called him \"a misguided fanatic\". After a failed attempt to free and arm slaves in Harper's Ferry, Virginia (Now West Virginia) he was captured and hanged in 1859. Recognized as one of the 19th century's most controversial figures, many Northerners regarded Brown as a hero. No one knows for sure how the song and its catchy tune came about. In fact some historians believe that the original song was not about John Brown the abolitionist but about a Scottish soldier of the same name who served in the 12th Massachusetts Regiment.The song's lyrics were orally passed on from camp to camp therefore changes to the words were frequent. Eventually it became one of the Union Army's most popular marching songs. Part of the lyrics was \"John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave; His soul's marching on!\" \n"}, {"text": "In 1861 Julia Ward Howe wrote a famous hymn using the tune of a song sung by Union soldiers honoring a controversial abolitionist.

The lyrics first appeared publicly when they were published in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" in February 1862. The hymn has since become a national classic. \n"}, {"text": "One of the Civil War's bloodiest battles was fought in a Southwest Tennessee field on April 6-7, 1862. Although the Union won the battle over 23,000 men from both sides were wounded or killed. Shortly after this bloody encounter, famed author Herman Melville remembered this event in a poem. What was the name of this poem? ", "correct": "Shiloh, a Requiem", "options": ["Onward Yanks to Chattanooga", "Victory at Vicksburg", "The Battle of Nashville"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShiloh, a Requiem.\n\n\tMelville was not present at the Battle of Shiloh but many historians believe he got his information from a narrative found in \"The Cincinnati Gazette\".  His most famous work is the novel \"Moby Dick\".  In 1866 he published a collection of poetry about the Civil War. \"Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War\" was not a commercial success but Melville dedicated it to \"the memory of the three hundred thousand who in the war for the maintenance of the Union fell devotedly under the flag of their fathers\".  Unlike \"Shiloh, a Requiem\" many of his other Civil War poems were reportedly based on personal eyewitness accounts.\n"}, {"text": "\"Taps\" is a famous American bugle call that had its origins in the US Civil War. At what event are you most likely to hear this song?", "correct": "At  a military funeral", "options": ["When a US President enters a room", "On the Fourth of July", "At a military victory parade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt  a military funeral.\n\n\tUnion Brigadier General Daniel Butterfield is credited with the creation of Taps as a bugle call. Butterfield, along with brigade bugler, Oliver Wilcox Norton, either composed or revised an earlier bugle call in order to create the now poignant and popular tune.  They did this after a tough and bloody day of fighting in 1862 near Harrison's Landing, Virginia.  Reportedly Butterfield thought the previously used bugle call was too formal and wanted something else to honor his soldiers. While it was probably used at military funerals prior to 1891 it was officially mandated to be used at military funerals in that year. Although several sets of lyrics have been written the most popular are \"Day is done, gone the sun, From the hills, from the lake,\rFrom the sky. All is well, safely rest, God is nigh.\" \n"}, {"text": "The Confederates often revised nursery rhymes to make fun of the Union Generals.

Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Pope and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson.\n\n\tThis revision of the nursery rhyme \"Little Bo Peep\" was quoted by the Confederates after Stonewall Jackson, with the help of Lt. General James Longstreet, forced Union Major General John Pope's troops to retreat during the Second Battle of Manassas in August of 1862.  This and other rhymes were collected by Lizzie Daniel, who was a young girl living in Richmond during the Civil War. She gathered a small collection of these rhymes and in 1893 included \"Mother Lincoln's Melodies\" in a published work entitled \"The Confederate Scrapbook\".  Other people mentioned in these rhymes include Abraham Lincoln, General's Grant and Lee, William Seward (Lincoln's Secretary of State), and Ambrose Burnside.\n"}, {"text": "This song was a favorite of Confederate soldiers.

What food would you often hear them singing about?", "correct": "Goober Peas", "options": ["Fried Chicken", "Grits and Greens", "Pinto Beans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoober Peas.\n\n\tGoober Peas are peanuts.

The Georgia Militia cracking goober peas. Peas, peas, peas, peas Eating goober peas. Goodness, how delicious, Eating goober peas.\"   Versions of the lyrics differed some from state to state and the song apparently was not published until 1866. While the song was fun to sing it did reveal the dire straits facing the Confederate soldiers during the last days of the war. Cut off railroad lines and Union advances had almost wiped out their food supply leaving them hungry. \n"}, {"text": "In 1898 Wallace Rice wrote a poem celebrating the fact that many Union and Confederate Civil War veterans were now fighting side by side.
