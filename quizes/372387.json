As a FunTrivia newbie, I was almost lost amongst all the endless possibilities to write about, along with all the different challenges giving me more ideas. \n\nYou could say I felt like this eight-letter word when I started out, a word defined as somebody external to an event or group.", "correct": "outsider", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\noutsider.\n\n\tS.E.

My template must go through this six-letter word first before it can be placed online.", "correct": "editor", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\neditor.\n\n\tThank you to all the volunteer editors for all the hard work they do and for putting up with all my garbage!\r With the digital revolution, editors don't necessarily have to be humans anymore. Editors have been developed as software and on the Internet to edit all forms of documents, not just text, but photos, programming code, or audio! \n"}, {"text": "In due time, my quiz was edited and returned saying that it was almost acceptable, but one question seemed to be an outlier, unrelated to the others. \n\nJust like here, in order to keep the story going, here's a word that doesn't fit in the story.

What if the quiz gets rejected again? What if the editor doesn't like my quiz?

All my fretting goes for nowt when my quiz is placed online.

The verb has to be conjugated to fit with various nouns or pronouns, so rarely appears in literature written as \"adorer\". \n"}, {"text": "With my confidence through my roof and a stadium full of screaming fans (okay, maybe a bit of an exaggeration there), the quiz factory that is me started up. Geography, General, History, one by one I conquered another category with a quiz.

When the show premiered in 2009, it was the most watched show in A&E history. \n"}, {"text": "When my imagination for potential quizzes began to wane, I wandered my way over to the author challenges and the Author's Lounge. The inspiration given there pushed me into categories and topics I never would have voluntarily gone to, and put new spins on subjects that interested me.\n\nAdding another letter gets a word that means \"the most dedicated, passionate members of a group\", possibly describing me in the quiz writer's world.", "correct": "hardcore", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nhardcore.\n\n\tHardcore can have other meanings on FunTrivia - you can participate in the hardcore version of the Global Challenge.

This isn't the end of my quiz-writing career, and it'll go into my profile as just another one of my quizzes.\n\nThe memoir quiz won out over a book deal as none of the publishers seemed to respond to my emails (I wonder why?). Anyway, for this last question add a letter to get a specific kind of book with a flexible spine. ", "correct": "hardcover", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nhardcover.\n\n\tHardcover books tend to cost more than their paperback counterparts due to the complex spine that allows the book to stay open.
