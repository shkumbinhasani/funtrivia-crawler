{"id": "199398", "name": "Top Movies of 2000 Trivia Game | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "2000s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "This film has it all.  Great acting by Geoffrey Rush, Kate Winslet, Michael Caine and Joaquin Phoenix, the fine direction of Philip Kaufman, a provocative and titillating story and magnificent dialogue.  What is the name of this film that centers around the bizarre and sometimes frightening exploits of the infamous French author the Marquis de Sade? ", "correct": "Quills", "options": ["Justine", "Marat/Sade", "Cruel Passion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuills.\n\n\tIf you have not seen this film, rent it...but beware, it is not for the faint of heart.  Rush is both compelling and repulsive as The Marquis de Sade, and his marvelous performance is joined by those of Winslet as a young laundress named Maddy, Phoenix as the repressed Abbe du Coulmier and Caine as the evil Dr. Royer-Collard. \n"}, {"text": "Another film wrapped around the real life story of a disturbed individual, this one focuses on the bizarre circumstances surrounding the filming of F. W. Murnau's classic horror piece 'Nosferatu'.  What is the title of this film that stars John Malkovich as Murnau and Willem Dafoe as the creepy but wonderful actor Max Schreck?", "correct": "Shadow of the Vampire", "options": ["Blood for Dracula", "Living in Oblivion", "A Symphony of Horror"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShadow of the Vampire.\n\n\tDirected by E. Elias Merhige and written by Steven Katz, 'Shadow of the Vampire' attempts to document the making of the 1922 German horror classic 'Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror'.  Willem Dafoe is ridiculously good as Max Schreck, a man who apparently took this film role as Count Orlock/Dracula far too seriously.   Malkovich's performance as the frustrated director nicely accompanies Dafoe's onscreen eccentricity. \n"}, {"text": "Guy Ritchie fans should have no problem with this next selection.  In 2000, the British wunderkind directed which film about a group of thugs and slugs who engage in a wrangle over a giant diamond that has come missing in a jewel heist?", "correct": "Snatch.", "options": ["Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", "Swept Away", "Revolver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnatch.\n\n\tAside from Ritchie's typically intense direction and dialogue, this film also happens to contain a number of entertaining performances, including some from familiar faces like Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro.  Just be sure that you have the special subtitles on when you watch the film...the Brad Pitt character is very difficult to understand! \n"}, {"text": "Sadly, the list of films in this quiz is largely English language-centric, but there are a couple of foreign favorites added for your pleasure.  One of these is the film 'Chunhyang', a wonderfully poetic story of love and song.  From which country did this film emerge in 2000?", "correct": "Korea", "options": ["Vietnam", "India", "Iran"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKorea.\n\n\t'Chunhyang' will give any viewer a very interesting perspective on traditional Korean society, and also includes several examples of old-style Korean music called 'pansori'.  The film is directed by Kwon-taek Im, whose film career began all the way back in 1962! \n"}, {"text": "Moving along, we have another non-English language title, this time, a Chinese language film beautifully directed by Ang Lee.  Featuring Zhang Ziyi, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh, this film features a quest for a priceless jade sword and a love story to boot.  Which film title fits this description?", "correct": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "options": ["Hero", "Dragon Inn", "The House of the Flying Daggers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\n\n\tCalled 'Wo Hu Cang Long' in Mandarin, this film is beautifully shot by Ang Lee.  True fans of Hong Kong martial arts film know that this is not the best kung fu flick of all time, but the cinematography alone (and the appearance of Chow Yun-Fat) make it worthwhile to watch. \n"}, {"text": "Your humble quizmaker seems to be a big fan of biopics, because this is the third entry of that genre in this quiz.  Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden star in which film based on the tortured life of an 20th century American Abstract Expressionist artist?", "correct": "Pollock", "options": ["De Kooning", "Rothko", "Motherwell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPollock.\n\n\t'Pollock' was truly a breakthrough performance by Ed Harris, who not only played the title role but directed the film as well.  For Marcia Gay Harden, the film was a career blockbuster, as the actress won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock's devoted wife.  It certainly doesn't hurt that actors such as Jennifer Connelly, Bud Cort, Val Kilmer and John Heard, among others, also make appearances. \n"}, {"text": "The Coen brothers were at it again in the year 2000 with yet another submission into their film oeuvre.  Perhaps the most artistic of their films, this film relates the story of three escaped convicts who embark on an odyssey to retrieve some buried loot.  What is the title of this ambitious effort?", "correct": "O Brother, Where Art Thou", "options": ["Miller's Crossing", "The Big Lebowski", "Barton Fink"], "explanation": "\n\n\nO Brother, Where Art Thou.\n\n\tThe word 'odyssey' in the question was a reference to the fact that this Coen brothers' film was loosely based on the Homeric epic of that title.  George Clooney is featured alongside the usual Coen brothers' players, John Turturro, John Goodman and Holly Hunter in this film that will have you humming bluegrass tunes for days. \n"}, {"text": "Set in France, this beautiful film features the acting of Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche, and tells the story of a woman who helps bring some life to a rigidly moralistic community through the creation of her dainty little confections.  Which of these film titles matches the information provided?", "correct": "Chocolat", "options": ["Like Water for Chocolate", "Life is Sweet", "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolat.\n\n\tDepp plays an itinerant musician named Roux, while Juliette Binoche is Vianne Rocher, the maker of chocolate treats with seemingly magical powers.  Alongside these two appear Alfred Molina, Carrie-Anne Moss, Lena Olin, Leslie Caron and Judi Dench.  Lovely performances from a talented cast in a truly delectable film. \n"}, {"text": "Here's one you may not have heard of, but should see.  In 2000, Brad Anderson directed a charming little film starring Vincent D'Onofrio and Marisa Tomei as lovers from different periods of time (D'Onofrio from the future, Tomei from the present) who come together to form an extremely neurotic relationship.  What is the name of this little gem with an intelligent plot and very engaging dialogue?", "correct": "Happy Accidents", "options": ["Wonderland", "The Machinist", "Next Stop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHappy Accidents.\n\n\t'Happy Accidents' is really a worthy watch.  The performances by Marisa Tomei as Ruby Weaver and Vincent D'Onofrio as Sam Deed alone make it worth your time.  Add in a plot with lots of twists and a surprise ending (and, a cameo appearance from Anthony Michael Hall!) and you have yourself a mini-classic. \n"}, {"text": "I probably would not have included this film but for the hilarious repartee that occurs between two characters, one a young man named Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller) who wishes to propose to his girl friend Pam Byrnes, and the other the fearsome father of the girl, Jack Byrnes, an ex-CIA agent whose trust level is virtually nil.  Endless wacky events ensue as Greg gets himself in deeper and deeper trouble with the hilariously intimidating Mr. Byrnes.  Which of these films could possibly fit the above description?", "correct": "Meet the Parents", "options": ["Reality Bites", "Analyze This", "How to Deal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeet the Parents.\n\n\t'Meet the Parents' is not exactly a film masterpiece, but the tension within the film between the De Niro and Stiller characters is incredibly amusing to behold.  In addition, the lines delivered by the Owen Wilson character, Kevin Rawley (former fianc\u00e9 of Pam Byrnes) are really quite funny.  Consider this a guilty pleasure.\r Thank you for giving this quiz a try, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other movie quizzes.  Please feel free to provide me feedback (keep it nice) regarding these film selections. \n"}]}
