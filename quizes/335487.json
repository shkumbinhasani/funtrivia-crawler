{"id": "335487", "name": "Wakeboarding Quiz | Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", " Sports Other"], "questions": [{"text": "Wakeboarding was invented as a combination of three other sports.  Which was not a sport used in the making of wakeboarding?", "correct": "Skateboarding", "options": ["Water skiing", "Surfing", "Snowboarding"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkateboarding.\n\n\tWhile wakeboarding may resemble skateboarding in a way, it was not developed using the sport as a basis.  Wakeboarding resembles water skiing because it is a water sport, and you are often pulled by a motor boat, just like with water skiing.  It is similar to snowboarding because it has one single board that moves forward, and you jump over slopes and such to do tricks.  It also is a lot like surfing, because you ride on the waves with a single board, though the waves in wakeboarding are much smaller. \n"}, {"text": "Wakeboarding is called wakeboarding for a reason.  You take the board over \"wakes\".  What are wakes?", "correct": "Waves made by a boat", "options": ["Waves made from strong winds", "Waves made from the wakeboard", "Waves formed from mini-earthquakes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWaves made by a boat.\n\n\tMotor boats leave little waves behind them as they travel through the water, which are known as wakes.  In wakeboarding, you use these little waves to jump to perform tricks in the air.  Or, if you prefer, you can ease over the wakes and not get any air, if you don't want to crash. \n"}, {"text": "Wakeboarding was actually invented in New Zealand, but under a different name.  Because of the sports wakeboarding resembles, what was wakeboarding originally named?", "correct": "Skurfing", "options": ["Skiwaking", "Surfwaking", "Skisurfing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkurfing.\n\n\tSkurfing is a combination of the words \"ski\" and \"surfing\".  Skurfing used a skurfboard, which was later called a skiboard.  Eventually \"skiboarding\" became known as \"wakeboarding\". \n"}, {"text": "Most wakeboards have a bend or curve in their shape.  This bend actually has a name.  What is it?", "correct": "Rocker", "options": ["Wakeboard Curve", "Spoon", "U-Line"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRocker.\n\n\tThe two most common types of rockers are the continuous rocker, which is a smooth curve throughout the entire board, and the three-stage rocker.  The three-stage rocker is similar to that of a skateboard, with the two ends flipped up slightly, but it doesn't bend near as much as a skateboard does. \n"}, {"text": "What does it mean to 'pop off' the wake?", "correct": "Use the wake a ramp to get air", "options": ["Drink soda while on the wake", "Wipe out because of a huge wake", "Grind on the edge of the wake as if it was a pipe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUse the wake a ramp to get air.\n\n\tHow fast you are moving towards the wake, how tight the rope is, and what board you are using all affect the height of the pop off the wake that you get.  For instance, if you are cutting into the wake very sharply, the boat is going 30 miles an hour, and you are using a three-stage rocker, you'll get much more air than if you are slowly moving towards the wake with very loose ropes, and the boat is only going 10 miles an hour. \n"}, {"text": "Do wakeboard have fins?", "correct": "Sometimes", "options": ["Never", "The wakeboard itself is called a \"fin\"", "Always"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSometimes.\n\n\tWakeboards comes in all different shapes and sizes, with fins or without fins.  It really depends on the rider's personal preference what kind of fins he wants on the board, or if he wants fins at all.  Fin types include long based fins, moulded fins, multi-finned set-ups, canted side fins, and cupped side fins. \n"}, {"text": "You may be familiar with a nosegrab, where you grab the front part of the board.  But what is it called when you grab the side of the board where your heels face, when your hand is between your feet?", "correct": "Melon", "options": ["Tailgrab", "Slob", "Roast beef"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMelon.\n\n\tThe nosegrab is when the front hand grabs the front of the board, while a tailgrab is when the back hand grabs the back of the board.  But, the feet don't point towards the nose.  The feet are sideways, so when you grab the heel side of the board with your front hand, this is called a melon.  The indy is when you grab the toe side with your front hand.  When your back hand goes through your legs to grab the heel side, this is called a roast beef.  A slob is when the front hand grabs the toe side in front of the first foot, not in-between the two feet like an indy. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most common tricks to perform with a wakeboard is called fashion air.  How do you perform \"fashion air\"?", "correct": "When in the air, curl the wakeboard towards your butt, keeping the knees pointing down", "options": ["Wiping out after a cool looking trick; a very fashionable exit", "Spin your body 360 degrees while in the air, moving your hands on the bar to avoid getting tangled", "Flipping in the air"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen in the air, curl the wakeboard towards your butt, keeping the knees pointing down.\n\n\tFashion air is a simple trick, though, like any trick, it takes time to learn.  When you hit a wake and get air, you can curl your wakeboard towards your butt, keeping your knees pointing down towards the water.  As you land, you return your feet to the original position they began in for a smooth landing. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not something you can do while on a wakeboard?", "correct": "Spread both legs apart", "options": ["Flip the board around 360 degrees while it is still on the surface of the water", "Ride the board sideways", "Do a front flip"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpread both legs apart.\n\n\tSince a wakeboard is similar to a snowboard, your legs are attached to the same thing, and therefore, cannot move apart, unlike water skiing, where each foot is on its own board, enables the legs to spread.  You can ride the board sideways, though it is more difficult and more easily causes wipeouts.  You can also move the board around 360 degrees while not in the air. In fact, this trick is called the \"surface 360\". \n"}, {"text": "All wakeboards must be solid color, due to pigmentation of the board materials.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWakeboards can be all sorts of different colors.  There is no need for a wakeboard to be solid.  Wakeboards are usually made out of foam or honeycomb, and can easily be painted any color or design. \n"}]}
