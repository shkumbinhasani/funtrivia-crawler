{"id": "339003", "name": "\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\" Trivia Game | 'Glee' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "For the Cheerios' \"California Gurls\" number, what happens to be included in the choreography?", "correct": "BMX biking", "options": ["Circus acrobatics", "Live animals", "Live singing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBMX biking.\n\n\tSue and the Cheerios are practicing for their big number for the cheerleading Regionals qualifier in the gymnasium.  While everyone dons a blue wig (a la Katy Perry) they perform their choreographed piece involving BMX biking on ramps, flaming setpieces, and pyrotechnic bras.  Unfortunately, Sue's not too thrilled.  She actually states that she's bored by the routine.  To remedy this, she asks all of the Cheerios to place silicone falsies in their breasts.  Quinn says that everyone's frustrated.  The number never seems to be good enough unless it's good enough for Sue despite the fact that it's the most elaborate number any cheer team ever seems to have performed.  Sue agrees that maybe something needs to be done about that.\rThe football team, meanwhile, is excited about their own prospects.  They're a shoe-in for the championship title for the first time in the school's history.  During the final huddle, however, Karofsky starts to make fun of Kurt and the Glee Club, and Finn, noticeably bothered, is too distracted to catch the ball during the game; they lose. \n"}, {"text": "Sue gets the idea to purchase a cannon for her cheerleading routine from which of these?", "correct": "A cartoon", "options": ["Becky", "A dream", "A sarcastic remark from Santana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cartoon.\n\n\tIn the locker room, the Glee Club boys are at odds with the rest of the team.  Karofsky leaves the locker room angry.  Sue, meanwhile, writes in her journal about the incapability to top herself.  When she watches a cartoon in her office, she realizes that the only option is to purchase the A950 cannon, a device which she is told has a 70% chance of catastrophic failure.  This does not deter her.\rIn the teacher's lounge, Will and Beiste discuss the team's lack of chemistry with one another and decide that they need to find a way to get them to join together quick, otherwise they'll lose the title they worked so hard to attain.  Will asks Beiste to trust him and they invite the football team into the choir room. \n"}, {"text": "Which female singer performs in the duet of \"Need You Now\"?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Quinn", "Tina", "Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tWhen the kids are told that the football team is temporarily joining Glee Club, everyone is outraged.  Will states that having the football team in the room is the way to rid the team of their ignorance and get everyone together.  This way, they'll win the big game.  Karofsky says that Beiste is probably bluffing, but she informs him that there is no choice.\rWhen Finn complains that the football team has no idea what they do in Glee Club, Will says that they'll need to show them.  As a result, Rachel and Puck perform a duet (with Puck on guitar) of Lady Antebellum's \"Need You Now\".  After a great performance, one of the football guys makes a joke about Puck's singing and a fight breaks out between both sides. \n"}, {"text": "Who is told that they will be shot out of Sue's cannon?", "correct": "Brittany", "options": ["Santana", "Quinn", "Will"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrittany.\n\n\tLooking over the school trophy cabinet, Puck and Finn both realize that they'll need to be friends again to work together and win the championship.  Meanwhile, Sue presents her 'sue-clear' weapon to the Cheerios.  The cannon, already in the football field, is much to Sue's liking.  She tells Brittany that she will be doing the honours and being shot out of the cannon during the big performance at the cheerleading championships next week.  Brittany claims that she's not ready to die, at least not until \"One Tree Hill\" gets cancelled.  When they shoot a Brittany-like dummy out of the cannon as a test run, it bursts into several charred pieces.\rWill and Figgins catch wind of Sue's probably-fatal cannon idea and she's told that there is no way it can be done without signed consent from the person going into the cannon; the school's insurance is through the roof.  Enraged, Sue starts destroying the secretary's office before her fury leads into the hall.  When Will tells Beiste about what happened later on, Sue's anger moves to the locker room.  She claims that she's sending a message.  She also says that the Cheerios will now be performing their routine on the same night as the football game, so McKinley's down one halftime show. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these people suggests that the Glee Club and football team perform a warm-up number?", "correct": "Karofsky", "options": ["Will", "Rachel", "Coach Beiste"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKarofsky.\n\n\tWill and Beiste consider Sue's choice to move the championship as positive and they tell the Glee Club and football team that they will be performing the half-time show together in order to promote unity and teamwork.  The Cheerios in Glee Club have a choice, Will says, of going to the cheer meet or staying with the club to perform a halftime show consisting of a \"Thriller\" performance (mashed up with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Heads Will Roll\").\rThe practices for the performance prove to be difficult to manage, but when Will convinces the kids to put more 'afterlife' into their roles, they get the hang of things.  After the practice, Will takes Karofsky aside and tells him that if he pursued something like Glee Club, he'd be one of the most talented guys in the school.  He asks him to consider it.  While everyone tests out their zombie make-up, Karofsky makes the suggestion to Finn that they perform a warm-up number. \n"}, {"text": "Brittany, Santana, and Quinn all hand in their resignation from New Directions.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn the bathroom, Quinn, Santana, and Brittany all discuss what to choose- Cheerios or Glee Club- before Sue emerges from one of the stalls to hand them all waivers asking that they permanently quit the Glee Club in favour of the cheerleading championships.  For Brittany, she also hands over a drawing supposedly made by the human cannon suggesting how much it misses her.  All three hand in their resignation to Will.\rWhen Finn finds out that Quinn has quit New Directions, he tries to convince her that Sue isn't worth her time.  Sam gets involved saying that Finn shouldn't be bothering his girlfriend and that perhaps a change in leadership should be on the way in Glee Club.  Will breaks them apart before things get rough.\rFor the guys' warm-up number, the football team, in zombie make-up, performs The Zombies' \"She's Not There\" in the auditorium.  Will is impressed with all of them for knocking it out of the park. \n"}, {"text": "The football team ends up on the receiving end of a Slushie facial given by which of these?", "correct": "The hockey team", "options": ["New Directions", "The Cheerios", "The opposing football team"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe hockey team.\n\n\tThe football team, more together than usual after their number, ends up walking down the hall in their make-up only to run into the hockey team.  After a short bout between them, the football team gets their first Slushie facial, realizing what it's like to be on the receiving end.  In the locker room, the footballers decide to quit Glee Club.  Beiste stops them immediately and says that if they quit Glee Club, they're off the football team.  It doesn't matter though - everyone but the guys from New Directions opts out.\rAt Dalton Academy, Kurt, Blaine, and the Warblers enjoy a lazy afternoon practicing a new possible number for Regionals, Destiny's Child's \"Bills, Bills, Bills\".  Over coffee, Blaine and Kurt meet up with Rachel and Mercedes.  They discuss the problems at McKinley and the guys say that they still support the team. \n"}, {"text": "How many of the New Directions girls join the football team?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["One", "Seven", "Eight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tDuring coffee, Blaine lets it slip that most high school regulations actually allow for a fewer amount of players on the football team, so while the actual team has bailed, they only need four more people.  In the choir room, the Rachel, Mercedes, Tina, and Lauren offer their services.  According to the rules, the girls are allowed to play to meet the regulation team size.  They also have permission slips, so when the ball is thrown, according to Rachel, they'll just lie on the ground to avoid getting hurt.  Beiste says it'll have to do.\rIn Sue's office, Sue reminds Brittany that if she doesn't sign a consent form to be shot out of the cannon, the cannon's family will go hungry.  Persuaded by the plight of the poor cannon, she signs. \n"}, {"text": "Does Karofsky perform during halftime?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhen game night arrives, the girls show up in their uniforms ready to go.  Of course, the first two quarters of the game don't turn out too well.  Mercedes is worn out; Tina wants to play.  Tina ends up getting up and picking up the ball at one point and she's tackled to the ground.  When Mike rushes to her aid, they find that she's fine, but bruised.  Finn makes a decision.  First, he puts Sam in as quarterback for the rest of the half.  Second, he tells Puck that he needs to convince the guys from the football team to come back for the second half.  Thirdly, he needs to retrieve the cheerleaders.\rBefore Sue's bus leaves for the competition, Brittany takes her time looking at the cannon and considering her mortality.  Santana claims it'll be worth it.  When Finn shows up, he says that they need to come back.  Sue doesn't care about the girls, and they don't need their reputation when they're happy.  All three girls decide to quit Cheerios, leaving Sue without her star performers.\rIn the locker room, Puck tells the guys that this is their moment to actually win one.  In the end, everyone but Karofsky opts into the halftime show to get back into the game.\rWhen the team and New Directions hit the field, the performance goes off without a hitch.  Karofsky, watching from the stands, realizes what they're doing for the crowd and joins them with a smile on his face.  When the team comes in from halftime, Beiste tells them to keep the zombie make-up on for the second half. \n"}, {"text": "For losing the cheerleading championship, Sue receives the title 'Loser of the Year'.  Who does she not beat out for this title?", "correct": "Rebecca Black", "options": ["Tiger Woods", "Mel Gibson", "Dina Lohan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRebecca Black.\n\n\tIn the second half of the game, the zombie make-up helps the team intimidate their competition, leading them to a championship win from behind.  McKinley wins their first championship in decades (while the team, cheerleaders, and crowds should \"Brains!\").\rIn an interview with Katie Couric, Sue discusses her devastating loss at the cheerleading championships forcing her to lose what would have been a seventh consecutive championship title.  As a result she's received the title 'Loser of the Year' beating out other candidates including the economy, Mel Gibson, the housing market, Dina Lohan, Tiger Woods, and others.\rAt school, it's revealed that Finn took home the MVP Award.  When he talks to Karofsky about joining Glee Club, he says it would be on the condition that he apologize to Kurt at Dalton Academy.  Karofsky says he doesn't want to be in Glee Club, after all, he's on top right now.  When he leaves, Quinn congratulates Finn on a job well done and commends his leadership.  As a thank you for helping her do the right thing, she gives him a kiss. \n"}]}
