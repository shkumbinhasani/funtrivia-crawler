{"id": "219019", "name": "Proof Online Quiz | P | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "P", "Pn - Pz Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "As the film opens, the protagonist Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is sitting on a sofa well after midnight, watching television as rain spatters on the roof and windows. What day is it?", "correct": "Her birthday", "options": ["Independence Day", "Easter Sunday", "Thanksgiving Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer birthday.\n\n\tPrompted by her father -- a ghost? a memory? a hallucination? -- she goes to the refrigerator and removes a bottle of champagne that he had bought for her. It actually isn't champagne at all, but wine, which she drinks anyway. Catherine is not exactly at her best; she and her sister will bury their father in only a few hours. \n"}, {"text": "A young man -- an aspiring professor of mathematics named Hal Dobbs (Jake Gyllenhaal) -- is in the house, looking through Catherine's father's writings. As he leaves for the night, he invites Catherine to watch him play a gig with his band, and she becomes angry. What does she accuse him of stealing?", "correct": "her father's notebooks", "options": ["her sister's photo albums", "her mother's engagement ring", "her wine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nher father's notebooks.\n\n\tCatherine's father Robert (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant mathematician, slid into dementia and became a graphomaniac. He wrote obsessively, filling the house with scores of notebooks of scribbled nonsense. Hal Dobbs, his former Ph.D. student, has been searching these notebooks after his death to discover whether his mind ever cleared enough to make one more contribution to mathematics.\r Catherine is torn between her belief that her father never recovered enough to work again, and her borderline paranoia that Hal is stealing her father's work to claim as his own. After she calls the police on him, she does find that he has taken a notebook, but it holds no mathematics: Hal was going to present it to her as a gift, since it contains a beautiful note about her. \n"}, {"text": "On the morning of their father's funeral, Catherine's older sister Claire (Hope Davis) arrives in Chicago. She is clearly worried about Catherine. Why?", "correct": "She fears that Catherine has inherited their father's madness as well as his talent.", "options": ["She dislikes Catherine's boyfriend.", "She is concerned that Catherine's grades will drop.", "She doesn't think that Catherine eats enough."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe fears that Catherine has inherited their father's madness as well as his talent.\n\n\tNeither sister really likes or understands the other, but they do love each other. From the moment Claire arrives she goes into Mom mode, from buying Catherine a dress for the funeral to giving her a new shampoo (\"You'll love it -- it has jojoba\"). Underlying it all is the knowledge that their father's madness began at age 26, and that Catherine is now 27 and often behaves irrationally. \n"}, {"text": "At the funeral, Catherine makes an unplanned and hostile speech. She begins by asking the mourners where they were during her father's illness, describes his dementia in graphic detail, and ends with the wrenching line \"I'm glad he's dead.\" Why is she so much more resentful than Claire?", "correct": "Because it was Catherine who dropped out of college to take care of their father.", "options": ["Because Claire has a much sunnier disposition, and always sees the best in everyone.", "Because Catherine has always blamed everyone else for everything.", "Because Catherine's childhood was much more difficult, as we learn through flashbacks."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause it was Catherine who dropped out of college to take care of their father.\n\n\tBy the time of their father's final relapse into dementia, Claire had already moved to New York. By no means did she abandon her father and sister; she worked long hours to pay both her own rent and also the mortgage on the family home in Chicago. But, as Catherine points out later, Claire \"had a life.\" Catherine believed their father would do better in his own home than in an institution, and so Catherine had to become completely devoted to her father's well-being. \n"}, {"text": "Claire throws a party at the family home on the night after the funeral. Catherine hates the idea of a party, and retreats to a quiet corner to talk with whom?", "correct": "Hal Dobbs", "options": ["An unnamed theoretical physicist", "Claire", "Professor Bhandari, an old teacher of hers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHal Dobbs.\n\n\tHal and Catherine overcome the awkwardness of the previous evening, joking about mathematicians. Catherine shows off her knowledge of prime numbers with a casual reference to Germain primes, developed in the 19th century by Sophie Germain, whose parents punished her for her interest in mathematics and who spent the first several years of her career writing under a male pseudonym. The attraction between Hal and Catherine is palpable, and she invites him to spend the night with her. \n"}, {"text": "The next morning, Catherine gives her mathematician friend the key she wears around her neck, and directs him to a drawer in her father's desk where he finds a proof. She claims she wrote it, but Claire thinks their father wrote it. What is the evidence that their father wrote the proof?", "correct": "It's written in a notebook just like the ones he used, he had a better education, and the handwriting looks just like his.", "options": ["It's written in a notebook just like the ones he used, and every page is dated (a habit of his).", "The notebook is signed with his name.", "The handwriting looks just like his, and the doodles in the margins are in his style."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's written in a notebook just like the ones he used, he had a better education, and the handwriting looks just like his.\n\n\tCatherine gives the key to Hal because she believes she can trust him, but he doesn't know her well enough to trust her claim that she wrote the proof (which he describes as important enough to warrant press conferences and a rethinking of prime number theory). After all, it's her father who's the proven genius (even if he was insane); she hasn't even finished her bachelor's degree! \n"}, {"text": "What is the evidence that Catherine wrote the proof?", "correct": "Her handwriting looks like her father's, she had access to the same books and materials that he did, and he had not produced anything else that was lucid during his illness.", "options": ["She had a better education, he had not produced anything else that was lucid during his illness, and he would never have doodled bunny rabbits in the margins.", "At the end of the notebook, there is a note from her father congratulating her on her achievement.", "The notebook is signed with her name."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer handwriting looks like her father's, she had access to the same books and materials that he did, and he had not produced anything else that was lucid during his illness.\n\n\t\"You've seen the other notebooks!\" Catherine reminds Hal. \"You know there isn't anything in there!\" Her father hadn't done any real work during his years of madness, and his most important work was done decades ago in his twenties. Hal agrees that sometimes people's handwriting closely resembles that of their family members (a fact which I can personally attest to), but he just thinks it's more realistic that her father would have written it. Claire suggests that Catherine prove her claim by reproducing the proof from memory, but that's impossible: it's over 40 pages long! \n"}, {"text": "Hal spends several days with a department's worth of mathematicians, working through and verifying the proof. In the meantime, Claire has extended her stay in Chicago so that she can complete what task?", "correct": "Packing up the family house so that she can sell it.", "options": ["Locating an excellent Chicago mental institution to house Catherine.", "Visiting with old friends from high school.", "Completing the registry for her upcoming wedding."], "explanation": "\n\n\nPacking up the family house so that she can sell it.\n\n\tClaire is the one who paid the mortgage, so she owns the house. She's made a life in New York, though -- she's planning to get married soon -- and so she is selling the house back to the University of Chicago, which has wanted it for a long time. Catherine is distraught by this idea -- \"I live here!\" she points out -- but there's nothing she can do. Claire offers to go apartment-hunting with her in New York, where she can watch over her sister; she also thinks she'll be able to get better mental health care for her there.She loves Catherine and worries about her, but has no idea how to express her concerns without offending her. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Hal conclude that Catherine must have written the proof?", "correct": "The pages aren't dated, in contrast with Catherine's father's undisputed notebooks, and the proof is too \"hip\" to have been written by the aging mathematician.", "options": ["There are several notes partway through the proof that must have been written by Catherine, like grocery lists and lists of college courses.", "He notices that some of the i's are dotted with hearts, which is out of character for Catherine's father.", "He finds another notebook with Catherine's father's unsuccessful attempt at the proof."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe pages aren't dated, in contrast with Catherine's father's undisputed notebooks, and the proof is too \"hip\" to have been written by the aging mathematician.\n\n\tHe runs to the house to tell her, as soon as he's verified the proof and realized that she wrote it, but she tells him it's too late: \"You should have trusted me.\" By this time, we've already learned through flashbacks that she had written it. Her father, excited at the return of his mathematical capabilities, had been trying to solve the same problem concurrently -- but it was a cruel illusion, and the proof he wrote was really a disjointed ramble. \"Let x equal the quantity of all quantities of x,\" he wrote. \"Let x equal the cold ...\"\r This was the moment when Catherine realized that his madness had returned after a remission of almost a year; this was when she dropped out of college to take care of him, working on her own version of the proof in her spare time and using \"hip\" mathematical concepts developed long after her father had finished his education. \n"}, {"text": "How does \"Proof\" end?", "correct": "Catherine sits with Hal on the University of Chicago campus, explaining her proof to him line by line.", "options": ["Catherine sits with Claire on an airplane to New York, brooding over the notebook with her proof.", "The notebook with the proof lies at the base of Catherine's father's tombstone. A drop of rain falls.", "Hal works in his office late at night, writing up the proof for publication under Catherine's name."], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatherine sits with Hal on the University of Chicago campus, explaining her proof to him line by line.\n\n\tCatherine, depressed and sullen, goes to the airport with Claire to fly to New York. But she has the notebook with her proof, given to her at the last moment by Hal, and as she holds it she realizes that her life is not over despite her fragile psyche. She flees the airport, ignoring Claire's protests, and finds Hal at the University of Chicago.\"You can't prove I wrote it,\" she tells him. He notes that they can prove she was capable of writing it, and so they sit on a bench outside and begin to work through it. I found it a beautiful ending to a deeply moving film. I hope you've enjoyed this quiz! \n"}]}
