{"id": "336199", "name": "Fractured American Idol 2011 Online Quiz | Fractured TV | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "TV Wordplay", "Fractured TV"], "questions": [{"text": "Steep fen tie lure", "correct": "Steven Tyler", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteven Tyler.\n\n\tA new judge this year (along with JLo) Steven Tyler is best known for his musical career with his band, Aerosmith. In my opinion, Tyler is a fabulous judge--lively, warm, sincere, and fun to watch. He could be a little more articulate, but, oh well. I admire his successful struggles with drug addiction. For me, this is the best panel of judges so far. I thought I would miss Simon Cowell, but I don't. \n"}, {"text": "Shame stir been", "correct": "James Durbin", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Durbin.\n\n\tOne of my favorites. I was shocked when this sweet heavy metal rocker did not make it to the Top Three. \n"}, {"text": "Hey Leigh Ryan heart", "correct": "Haley Reinhart", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHaley Reinhart.\n\n\tI love Haley's deep, growly voice and her bluesy/jazzy/rocky taste in music. Was she or wasn't she \"involved\" with Casey Abrams? After James was booted off the show, I wanted Haley to win. Alas, she was booted off the next week. Top Three is good, though. \n"}, {"text": "Low wren gnaw lane awe", "correct": "Lauren Alaina", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLauren Alaina.\n\n\tLauren has a really strong, beautiful voice. I like how funny she is sometimes, too. Her style of music (country) isn't my fav, but she sings it beautifully. I think she may have been a touch too young for the competition, because she got her feelings hurt really easily. \r She seemed really happy to come in second. She kissed the winner, Scotty, on the mouth. \n"}, {"text": "Quay sea yay Brahms", "correct": "Casey Abrams", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCasey Abrams.\n\n\tCasey is a wonderful, inventive musician and he seems like a sweet, quirky, caring person (and funny, too). I was sorry when \"America\" booted him off fairly early. Was he or wasn't he \"involved\" with Haley? \n"}, {"text": "Pall muck dawn hulled", "correct": "Paul McDonald", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul McDonald.\n\n\tNow, I have to reveal that my husband hates Paul's voice. I don't, and I think he is way cute, but I think he left the show at about the right stage (though, in my humble opinion, he shouldn't have stayed longer than Pia). \n"}, {"text": "Pea yaw tossed caw know", "correct": "Pia Toscano", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPia Toscano.\n\n\tOh my God, what a strong, gorgeous voice she has! She should never have left the show as early as she did. However, I sometimes found her performances the teensiest bit boring. \n"}, {"text": "Fee Ahmed key awe", "correct": "Thia Megia", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThia Megia.\n\n\tBeautiful girl with a beautiful voice. Maybe she needs a little more pizzazz in her performing style. \n"}, {"text": "Scut tea mock career he", "correct": "Scotty McCreery", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nScotty McCreery.\n\n\tI love Scotty's DEEP voice and his sense of humor. He needs to get a little more (life) experience under his belt before he can sing love songs convincingly, though. He's definitely bound for country music stardom.\r And he won the whole shebang. Who knew? \n"}, {"text": "Stuff fawn no land go knee", "correct": "Stefano Langone", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStefano Langone.\n\n\tStefano sings wonderfully and seems like a sincerely lovely person. But... for him for me, he's a little bland, still. I think he'll develop into a more interesting singer as he ages, though. \n"}]}
