{"id": "272043", "name": "Bosses of \"Twilight Princess\" Trivia Game | Zelda Games | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "What weapon does the Forest Temple mid-boss use in battle?", "correct": "Gale Boomerang", "options": ["Clawshot", "Slingshot", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGale Boomerang.\n\n\tThis boss, named Ook, is the crazy baboon that cuts down the bridge in the middle of the ravine in the Forest Temple.  If you manage to defeat him in his chamber (which can only be accessed with the help of some relatively strong monkeys), then you can claim the Gale Boomerang for yourself.  It is later revealed that Ook was being controlled by an odd Twilit bug that had nestled on his back.  Ook later returns to help you during the boss battle in the final chamber of the temple. \n"}, {"text": "What is the classification of Diababa, the boss of the Forest Temple?", "correct": "Twilit Parasite", "options": ["Twilit Baba", "Twilit Deku", "Twilit Plant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwilit Parasite.\n\n\tIn the final chamber of the Forest Temple, you can begin a battle with this large plant creature that seems to have spawned from a regular Deku Baba.  Start the battle by giving the two large mouths some Bomblings from around the area, and when the Diababa returns for the second half of the fight, use the Bomblings that Ook swings by you.  To get them to the Diababa, you'll need to aim your Boomerang at both Ook's bomb and the creature to send it to both.  When the boss goes down, use the sword to destroy it once and for all. \n"}, {"text": "You must fight the Bulblin Lord on the Bridge of Eldin to save Colin.  Which is a place where you fight this character again?", "correct": "The Great Hylian Bridge", "options": ["Peak Province", "Lake Hylia", "Hyrule Castle Town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Great Hylian Bridge.\n\n\tThese battles are done on horseback, and are quite similar to a jousting match.  In the first battle, the Bulblin Lord has taken Colin across the field north of Kakariko Village, and you need to fight him on the Bridge of Eldin.  In the second battle, you'll be escorting Telma, Ilia, and Prince Ralis across the southern portion of Hyrule towards Kakariko, but you'll be stopped at the Great Hylian Bridge for a second battle. In order to defeat the Bulblin Lord, you need to swing your sword at the precise moment as the enemy passes by.  This will knock him off the bridge and let you safely pass.  The Lord Bulblin is found in numerous other places in the game. \n"}, {"text": "The mid-boss of the Goron Mines, Dangoro, is a Goron.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThis Goron warrior guards the item crucial to completing this dungeon, the Hero's Bow.  In order to defeat this guardian, you need to sword the beast until he curls into a ball and proceeds to try and run you over.  Luckily, you have the Iron Boots now.  Put them on and catch the Goron. With your strength, throw him into the lava surrounding the battlefield to hurt him.  After a few tosses into the pit, you'll be finished the battle, and he will let you proceed claiming that you will be the one to calm Darbus. \n"}, {"text": "What hot-headed Twilit creature does the Goron Mine boss, Darbus, become during his boss battle?", "correct": "Fyrus", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFyrus.\n\n\tFyrus is Darbus' evil form, the Twilit Igniter.  In this battle, Darbus will be an ashy figure that bursts into flames and runs around with chains around his arms and legs.  Use the Hero's Bow to shoot the odd gem in between his eyes, and then take a hold of the chains he drags behind while you're wearing the Iron Boots.  When Fyrus is knocked to the ground, take out your sword and begin the final stages.  Keep repeating this until the gem on his head breaks, and the battle ends. \n"}, {"text": "How many spaces in the Vessel of Light will be filled when you capture the light from the elusive Twilit Bloat?", "correct": "One", "options": ["Three", "Two", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tAlthough this odd creature is the only one of its kind in the game, and although it's clearly oversized, the Twilit Bloat will only contribute the final bit of light in the final Vessel of Light in the game.  Once you've ventured around Lanayru Province, you can fight this creature on top of Lake Hylia on a series of floating platforms. When this feeder of darkness is caught on its stomach, hop on top, and remove all of its tendrils.  This is the perfect opportunity to make use of Midna's area of effect.  Once this boss has been defeated, the twilight will lift itself from Lanayru Province and you can finish on your way to the Lakebed Temple. \n"}, {"text": "What equippable object do you claim after defeating the Deku Toad of the Lakebed Temple?", "correct": "Clawshot", "options": ["Water Bomb", "Dominion Rod", "Spinner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClawshot.\n\n\tThis obscure boss it quite large (compared to real toads for that matter) and its major attack will be to leap into the air and fall onto you from the ceiling.  When it's on the ground, your target is the tongue of the toad.  Use bombs in order to subdue the Deku Toad and sword away when you get the chance.  Upon completion of this battle, you will receive the object that you sought after in the temple; the Clawshot.  This will allow you to reach the handles that turn the stairwell (and water guiding system) in the main foyer of the temple. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these objects is not required for the battle against Morpheel?", "correct": "Water Bombs", "options": ["Clawshot", "Zora Armor", "Ordon Sword"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWater Bombs.\n\n\tThe only other objects which are mandatory for this battle are the newly-acquired Clawshot, the Iron Boots and your sword.  During this battle, you'll be underwater the whole time, so the Zora's Armor is required.  First, you'll start off against the eye of the beast.  Use the Clawshot and avoid the tentacles in order to get a few good hits against it.  When you've finished it off, the real battle will begin. Morpheel's true form will emerge and swim around the arena.  Using the Clawshot, hitch a ride on top of the creature and sword away.  After the battle, you'll be dropped off at Lanayru's spring where Zant will be waiting. \n"}, {"text": "Where do you battle the Skull Kid?", "correct": "Sacred Forest", "options": ["Faron Woods", "Temple of Time", "Forest Temple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSacred Forest.\n\n\tAs soon as you howl for the stone at the entrance of the Sacred Woods, your battle with the Skull Kid begins.  He'll run around the woods with his Puppets after you and you'll need to follow him around unlocking new pathways.  When your whole route opens up, you'll emerge in a new grove where you'll need to fight the mini-boss and his hordes of foes.  After you manage to get a few hits in, he'll let you pass to the ruins of the Temple of Time.  When you have to return for the second time, you'll need to oppose him once again in nearly the same battle. \n"}, {"text": "How many different Poes take the light from the lobby of the Arbiter's Grounds?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Five", "Two", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tAll four of these Poes need their souls to be captured in order for you to complete your journey through the Arbiter's Grounds.  Once all four lights are returned to the Grand Ceremonial Hallway, you can proceed to the real mini-boss of the dungeon.  The fourth Poe of this game is similar to the fourth Poe Sister from \"Ocarina of Time\" and \"Majora's Mask\", Meg.  This Poe will divide into four different Poes and you'll need to defeat the correct one to finish the battle. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the mid-boss that guards the Spinner in the Arbiter's Grounds?", "correct": "Death Sword", "options": ["Death Shot", "Death Hammer", "Death Shield"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeath Sword.\n\n\tIn this chamber, a skeletal being will use his swordsman skills in order to prevent you from getting the equippable item of this area: The Spinner.  The boss isn't that hard though.  For one, you can't see the boss in human form, so switch to your wolf form to see it.  Simply gnaw away at it until it can be see by human eyes.  When this happens, transform into Link and use a combo of the Hero's Bow and your Sword in order to bring it down for once and for all.  If you're able to maneuver good with your sword at this point in the game, then the battle should be a piece of cake. \n"}, {"text": "What term best describes the final boss of the Arbiter's Grounds?", "correct": "Twilit Fossil", "options": ["Twilit Skeleton", "Twilit Demon", "Twilit Skull"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwilit Fossil.\n\n\tThe Twilight Fossil that Link meets in the final chamber of the Arbiter's Grounds is the one and only Stallord, who rises from the sands to wreak havoc on Link and end his quest for the Mirror of Twilight.  When Link is in this battle, it will begin with Stallord in the ground.  Using the Spinner, you need to avoid the Staltroops and get a couple blows in on Stallord's spine. When he finally succumbs to this, the battle continues as only his head begins a fight and a large pillar rises to the ceiling.  Once again, you need to use the Spinner and work your way around the tower, avoiding fireballs and jumping at the beast when necessary. After this battle is over, you can make your way up to the Mirror Chamber on top of the dungeon. \n"}, {"text": "What weapon is guarded by Darkhammer?", "correct": "Ball and Chain", "options": ["Spinner", "Dominion Rod", "Clawshot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBall and Chain.\n\n\tThe Ball and Chain is found in a rather narrow chamber containing the mid-boss of the Snowpeak Ruins, the Darkhammer.  Darkhammer uses the power of his blunt hitting device (oddly, not a hammer, but the very item you are to obtain) to bar you from advancing.  Luckily, with the Clawshot and the sword techniques at your disposal, you can get a few swipes at Darkhammer's backside and you can walk away unscathed with your prize.  Obviously, the object may weigh you down before it helps you out. \n"}, {"text": "In which room of the Snowpeak Ruins do you fight Blizzeta?", "correct": "The bedroom", "options": ["The chapel", "The kitchen", "The lobby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bedroom.\n\n\tYour whole trip through Snowpeak Ruins will be in search of the Bedroom Key (although you're usually led off track by goat cheese, pumpkins, and the like).  However, once you reach the chapel of the Ruins, you should be able to find the key for yourself.  Yeta will lead you inside and transform into the Twilit Ice Mass, Blizzeta before you can get a hold of the Mirror Shard on the wall. During this battle, you will begin by hitting Blizzeta with the Ball and Chain, but when she starts reaching the ceiling, you'll need to avoid the stalagmites she drops onto you.  Just keep beating away the ice and avoiding the avalanche of attacks and Yeta will return to normal. \n"}, {"text": "Darknut, the mid-boss of the Temple of Time, guards the Big Key.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLike most mid-bosses, Darknut is guarding the weapon of the dungeon.  In this case, he protects the elusive, yet ominously powerful Dominion Rod.  The tricky thing about this boss is the fact that it's only a bit difficult the first time you face it.  Why exactly?  Well, by the time you reach the top of Hyrule Castle, numerous Darknuts will have fallen. In fact, the Darknut is one of the seemingly-preferred enemies guarding the hallways of the castle.  Simply make use of your sword skills, get the hits in on the back, and wear away at the armor of the warrior.  When its armor is removed, it will be able to run, so simply swipe at it and avoid the fierce blows. \n"}, {"text": "During the battle with Armogohma, where can the statues be found?", "correct": "In the corners of the room", "options": ["At the entrance of the room", "In the center of the room", "On the ceiling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the corners of the room.\n\n\tThese statues are required in order for you to finish off this creature.  Once you've taken the statue to the lobby of the Temple of Time, you can descend into the basement and fight a rather large, armored spider.  This Twilit Arachnid will first try scuttling around the roof.  Use the Hero's Bow and knock it to the floor. When the opportunity arises, lead it to the corner of the room and use the Dominion Rod to force the statue to be under your command.  When this happens, you can smash the spider.  When you've defeated the arachnid, it will turn into numerous smaller spiders that you can easily pick off for a clean victory. \n"}, {"text": "How many Aeralfos do you fight to obtain the Double Clawshot?", "correct": "One", "options": ["None", "Two", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tAlthough there are many of these creatures within the City in the Sky, only one guards the weapon of the dungeon.  To defeat one of these, simply Clawshot its shield when it brandishes it (before swooping in to attack) and pull it to the ground.  This is when you sword it to a pulp.  That's basically it for this somewhat easy mini-boss.  Like the Darknuts, the Aeralfos will appear in many places throughout Hyrule Castle once its barrier has been taken down.  Having the Double Clawshot will not give you an advantage over this enemy. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the boss of the City in the Sky?", "correct": "Argorok", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nArgorok.\n\n\tThe Argorok of the City in the Sky is classified as the Twilit Dragon, and while it has terrorized you through the dungeon, now's the chance to really do some damage.  Using the Double Clawshot, you need to ascend the towers surrounding the arena (overlooking the city).  At the top, Clawshot onto the Argorok's tail and pull it to the ground with the Iron Boots as a deadweight. When its armor has broken off enough, you'll find a weak spot on the back of the creature; then things get a bit tougher.  Peahats will rise from the ground and fly above the towers, so ascend to their level and Clawshot around the arena (all the while avoiding the fire being shot at you).  When you get a good shot at its back, latch on and sword away. After it's dead, you can finally finish with the Mirror of Twilight. \n"}, {"text": "During the fight with Zant, where is the final location where you battle him?", "correct": "Hyrule Field", "options": ["Temple of Time", "Hyrule Castle", "Ordon Village"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyrule Field.\n\n\tAfter running through the Palace of Twilight, you can go into battle with the False King of the Twilight, Zant.  This battle will allow you to revisit many of the previous boss battles, and while you will return to many dungeons, you will only be facing Zant as he attempts to mimic the other Twilit creatures. In the very last portion of the battle, Zant will teleport you outside the south gates of Hyrule Castle Town.  Within a small arena, you will need to avoid Zant's numerous attacks and use the Master Sword of Light to finish him off for good.  When the battle is over, you'll return to the Palace and Midna will do away with him. \n"}, {"text": "During the battle with Ganondorf, who does he take under his control?", "correct": "Princess Zelda", "options": ["Midna", "Epona", "Link"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincess Zelda.\n\n\tWhen you reach the throne room of Hyrule Castle, Ganon will first take control of Zelda, who will attack you much like Phantom Ganon and Ganondorf from \"Ocarina of Time\"- with the deflective energy balls.  After this, Ganon will mutate into a Dark Beast.  During this battle, he'll teleport through the room and you'll need to shoot him in the forehead with an arrow. Sword its belly when it's on the ground.  After this battle, Midna will force you and Zelda to evacuate and the castle will be destroyed.  Out in Hyrule Field, Ganondorf will return on horseback and you'll need to help Zelda use Light Arrows to knock him off. After this, the final battle will begin, and you'll need to use your swordsmanship skills in order to defeat him for once and for all and ultimately save the land of Hyrule. \n"}]}
