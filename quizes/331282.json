Who was she?", "correct": "Jessie's Girl", "options": ["Long Tall Sally", "Peggy Sue", "Rhonda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJessie's Girl.\n\n\tRick Springfield could for sure get any girl--even if he wasn't really Dr. Noah Drake.  \"Jessie's Girl\" was released on March 17, 1981. \n"}, {"text": "I'm pretty sure Ian made this the only cross-eyed girl to ever get mentioned in a song of any kind.
