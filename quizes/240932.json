Quiz / Test | Animals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Dogs", "Dog Breeds"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Designer dogs\" are real breeds, not just mixed-breed dogs.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe definition of a \"breed\" is a population of animals which, when you breed two of that population together, will produce animals that look like the parents. If you breed two beagles together, for example, you'll always get more beagles- not poodles or Labradors. See Q. 2 for more info on why \"designer dogs\" are not breeds.\rA \"mixed-breed\" is any dog that is a mix of breeds. That is what designer dogs are...a less genteel term for their genetic status is \"mutts.\" \n"}, {"text": "In almost all cases, \"designer dogs\" are produced by breeding dogs of two different breeds together- such as a Labrador and a Poodle- rather than breeding two designer dogs together- such as a Labradoodle and a Labradoodle. Why?", "correct": "Because since they are not true breeds, the offspring of two \"designer dogs\" will be extremely variable", "options": ["Because they will have more puppies if two purebreds are bred together", "Because the parents cannot be registered if they are \"designer dogs\"", "All of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause since they are not true breeds, the offspring of two \"designer dogs\" will be extremely variable.\n\n\tThis is why \"designer dogs\" are not breeds. A Labradoodle bred to a Labradoodle will produce some puppies that look just like Labs, some that look like Poodles, and some in-between. They do not \"breed true.\" \n"}, {"text": "Today's Labradoodles are descended from dogs bred for blind people that required low-allergy dogs, and Labradoodles are still being used for this purpose today. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlthough Guide Dogs Victoria, in Kew, Australia, did attempt to breed a Labrador-Poodle cross in the 1970s due to a request for an allergen-free guide dog, the program was soon abandoned because the offspring did not make predictable, consistent guide dogs. The present website for Guide Dogs Victoria does not indicate that they currently breed any dogs except Labrador and Golden Retrievers. The present Labradoodle craze was instead started by several Australian puppy farms who bred the dogs for profit, not guide-dog work. \n"}, {"text": "Labradoodles and Goldendoodles do not shed and have easy-to-care-for coats.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tA survey of \"doodle\" owners conducted by a website designed to promote the breed admitted that 65% of Labradoodles and 51% of Goldendoodles did shed. Most Labradoodles and Goldendoodles that I have seen have very cottony, soft, open coats that mat and tangle with a vengeance and require extensive and expensive professional grooming. \n"}, {"text": "What is the primary motivation behind most breeding of \"designer dogs\"?", "correct": "Profit", "options": ["Creating healthier dogs through breeding only genetically-tested animals", "Creating dogs that are physically better specimens, through breeding only show-winning parents", "Creating better working dogs through breeding only dogs that can perform well"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProfit.\n\n\tLet's face it. Designer dogs are bred for money. They are not breeds; there are no conformation shows for them. They are susceptible to MORE genetic disorders, not fewer, as they combine the genetic problems of two breeds. And they are not bred for working ability, but those cute fluffy puppies may sell for over a thousand dollars each... \n"}, {"text": "\"Designer dogs\" have \"hybrid vigor,\" which makes them healthier than purebreds.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAs veterinarian Dr Zammit said in reference to \"designer dogs,\" \"There is a concept called 'hybrid vigour' where you cross two different breeds and you get an animal that is stronger and sounder but to do that you have to start with the right genetic material to begin with - and that's not happening.\" Most reputable breeders of healthy, quality purebreds will not sell dogs to breeders who intend to produce \"designer dogs.\" So the breeding stock for most \"designer dogs\" programs are animals that have had no health testing, have never been shown, have never earned any working titles, and are very unlikely to be healthy, quality animals. \r In addition, \"hybrid vigor\" has never been proven in the dog. \n"}, {"text": "A look through any classified service, such as Craigslist, will show that many Labradoodles, Goldendoodles and other \"designer dogs\" soon lose their homes and are offered up for adoption. Why?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["They have a much higher activity level than expected", "They were bought on impulse, and the buyers do not have enough time for them", "They are not allergen-free"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tA recent search for \"labradoodle\" on Craigslist in the United States Pets sections found 23 up for adoption. Some of the reasons: \"my husband is EXTREMELY allergic to him,\" \"does not get along with my Irish wolfhounds,\" \"needs a lot of exercise,\" \"needs someone to play with him,\" \"Needs lots of play and exercise time,\" \"won't come when called.\" Overall, though, the most common excuse for rehoming was \"don't have enough time.\" \n"}, {"text": "What is true about crossing two different breeds to produce a \"designer dog\"?", "correct": "None of these is necessarily true", "options": ["The resulting puppies will have the best characteristics of each parent", "The puppies will be healthier than either parent", "The puppies will have better temperaments than either parent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these is necessarily true.\n\n\tDespite all the hype about \"designer dogs,\" they are not healthier or more mentally sound than a similar-appearing mixed-breed dog saved from a pound. \n"}, {"text": "What, according to many shelters, is NOT a result of the \"designer dog\" craze?", "correct": "People adopting more dogs from shelters because they look just like designer dogs", "options": ["People buying puppies because they are trendy", "People acquiring puppies that they do not have the time to care for", "People buying more puppies from pet stores, thus supporting puppy mills"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeople adopting more dogs from shelters because they look just like designer dogs.\n\n\tThe \"designer dog\" craze has led many people to acquire a dog just because the mix has a cute name or because some vapid starlet showed one off on TV. Unfortunately, this type of impulse buying is often done at pet stores, thus supporting the horrifically cruel puppymill industry. Despite their high price tag, designer dogs look just like dogs that are languishing in pounds and shelters all over the USA. http://www.grumpybumpers.com/dogs/ has a *wonderful* little quiz on telling \"designer dogs\" from shelter pooches- check it out! \n"}, {"text": "If you need a dog with certain physical or mental characteristics (such as no shedding or being calm around children,) what is the best way to ensure getting such a dog?", "correct": "Adopt a purebred known for those characteristics from a rescue or responsible breeder", "options": ["Get whatever puppy the pet store recommends", "Get a designer dog bred for these characteristics", "It's impossible; don't bother trying"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdopt a purebred known for those characteristics from a rescue or responsible breeder.\n\n\tDog breeds have been bred for hundreds of years to have uniform characteristics- it's what makes them *breeds.* Responsible breeders who do all required health testing and evaluations of their dogs, or rescues who work with and know their dogs well are your best source for a dog that must have certain characteristics. Don't get caught in the very expensive and tragic trap of thinking that a \"designer dog\" will be the magic solution to any canine problem. \n"}]}
