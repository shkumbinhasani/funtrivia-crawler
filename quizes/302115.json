Winning Best Film at the Fantasia and Toronto After Dark Film Festivals and placing first on numerous critics' listings, the film was one of the most well-received over any genre for the year.\rThe film centers on two young children.  Oskar, a twelve-year-old boy from Stockholm, has his share of bad problems from his parents' uncaring nature to bullying.  When he meets Eli, things change though.  This little girl harbors a deep secret that allows Oskar to get his way.  Soon, a young love blossoms, and the two are inseparable.  When Eli's vampyric tendencies start to become more evident, it's up to the two of them to determine what means most. \n"}, {"text": "Marcus Nispel directed the remake, but who directed the original \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"?", "correct": "Tobe Hooper", "options": ["John Carpenter", "Tom Holland", "Michael Bay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTobe Hooper.\n\n\t\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", originally released in 1974, was made for under $150,000, but grossed over $30,000,000 at the box office.  The movie is renowned for delivering what you expect: a massacre.  Until \"Halloween\" was released, less than a decade later, it was one of the most profitable horror films released.  It wasn't until Michael Bay announced the Platinum Dunes production company that the film was remade in 2003.  Being the first in a string of classic horror remakes (which Platinum Dunes specializes in), the remake grossed $107,000,000 in its box office run while its sequel (actually, a prequel known as \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning\") was released three years later, gaining half that total.  Marcus Nispel, the director of the remake, would later go on to direct the remake of \"Friday the 13th\" for Platinum Dunes in 2009.\r\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" is about a group of friends traveling through Texas.  When their car runs out of gas, the fun begins.... \n"}, {"text": "What was the subtitle of the fourth \"Friday the 13th\" film?", "correct": "The Final Chapter", "options": ["A New Beginning", "Jason Lives", "Jason Takes Manhattan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Final Chapter.\n\n\tIronically, the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise gained a good $32,000,000 from Jason's fourth bout of spree killings and this attempt at killing the franchise actually spawned numerous more sequels.  \"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter\" followed yet another group of sexually-charged, ambiguous teenagers at Camp Crystal Lake, shortly after the events of \"Part 3\".  Eventually, it's up to a young Corey Feldman to shave his head to save his sister.  \"The Final Chapter\" was followed by a revival of the series in 1985, one year later and starred the same character played by Feldman.\r\"Jason Lives\" and \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" were the sixth and eighth installations respectively. \n"}, {"text": "The 1992 film, \"Candyman\", was based on which Clive Barker short story?", "correct": "The Forbidden", "options": ["Revelations", "Book of Blood", "Dread"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Forbidden.\n\n\t\"Candyman\", released in 1992, starred Virginia Madsen (later known for her work in \"The Number 23\", \"The Haunting\", and \"The Haunting in Connecticut\" and her Oscar nomination for \"Sideways\") and Tony Todd (who also appeared in \"Wishmaster\" and the Clive Barker-inspired episode of \"Masters of Horror\", \"Valerie on the Stairs\").  Directed by Bernard Rose and written by Clive Barker, the film was quite successful in the box office and was followed by two sequels in 1995 and 1999.\rThe film follows a graduate student, Helen, who is formulating a thesis on urban legends.  When many interviewees remind her of the 'Candyman' legend, she soon finds that the stories may be true, and the Candyman himself stops at nothing to try and perpetuate his name and continue the legend.  When Helen ends up in one of the rougher neighbourhoods of Chicago, she finds herself fighting gangs and the supernatural, and she begins questioning her own sanity. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Hills Have Eyes\" was remade in 2006.  The director of the original \"Hills Have Eyes\" film also directed which other movie?", "correct": "Scream", "options": ["The Thing", "Mirrors", "Gremlins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScream.\n\n\tOriginally directed by Wes Craven (later known for \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Scream\", both released in subsequent decades), \"The Hills Have Eyes\" centered around a group of deranged, mutant cannibals and a family caught in a battle against them.  Craven also produced a sequel eight years later in 1985, but has since disowned it, claiming he only did it for the money.\rIn 2006, Alexandre Aja wrote the script for the \"Hills Have Eyes\" remake and it was filmed and released, reaching #1 in the UK box office.  A sequel to this film (coincidentally written by Craven) was released the following year due to the film's success. \n"}, {"text": "What was the subtitle of the second \"Urban Legends\" movie?", "correct": "Final Cut", "options": ["Bloody Mary", "Folklore", "Evil Within"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinal Cut.\n\n\tWhile the original \"Urban Legend\" film, released in 1998, was quite successful in the box office, \"Final Cut\" wasn't necessarily as popular (nor well-received).  Although \"Final Cut\" did manage to reclaim its budget and then some, it wasn't as popular as the original for a number of reasons.\r\"Final Cut\" revolves around a group of film students.  As they work on a film (coincidentally about urban legends - go figure) they soon realize that someone wearing a fencing mask is killing off most of the cast and crew.  Before they know it, they need to watch their backs or else they'll be the next cut (ha ha).\r\"Final Cut\" was released in theaters in 2000 and was followed in 2005 by another sequel, \"Bloody Mary\".  While \"Bloody Mary\" had the same franchise backing it, the movie had little to do with the original two (ie. cast, story, etc.), even deciding to remove the slasher element which had made the first two successful in a decade of popular slasher films. \n"}, {"text": "What is the sequel to the Ridley Scott sci-fi/horror film, \"Alien\" (1979)?", "correct": "Aliens", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAliens.\n\n\tOriginally released in 1986, \"Aliens\" was released to critical acclaim with many praising the script, atmosphere, effects, and style take by director James Cameron (also known for \"Titanic\" and \"Terminator\").  The film stars Sigourney Weaver, the only human survivor from the original \"Alien\" movie, as she volunteers to travel with a group of marines to investigate a space colony after it has lost contact with Earth.  When she arrives, an emotional, yet deadly battle with a colony overrun by aliens ensues.\rJames Cameron's script for the film was only greenlit on the basis that \"Terminator\" would be a hit due to the fact that the original \"Alien\" film, despite making $104 million in the box office, didn't garner enough money for a sequel.  \"Aliens\" later broke that box office total and became the most acclaimed entry in the \"Alien\" canon.  Sigourney Weaver also received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress based on her role in the film. \n"}, {"text": "2009's \"The Unborn\" starred Odette Yustman and which other actor?", "correct": "Gary Oldman", "options": ["Jensen Ackles", "Liev Schreiber", "Michael Madsen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGary Oldman.\n\n\t\"The Unborn\" was the first horror film released in 2009, and surprisingly, it wasn't a remake, sequel, or shaky-cam film like nearly everything released in 2008.  Released by Platinum Dunes as its first non-remake film (it previously released \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", \"The Hitcher\", and \"The Amityville Horror's\" remakes in prior years, and was followed by the \"Friday the 13th\" remake the next month), \"The Unborn\" tread on new ground by focusing on a mythical demon creature known from Jewish folklore as the dybbuk.  The film stars Odette Yustman, who appeared in \"Cloverfield\" the previous January, and Gary Oldman, known for his role in the 1992 adaptation of \"Dracula\" as the titular character himself.\r\"The Unborn\" grossed over $35,000,000, in what is considered an otherwise lackluster month in annual movie releases, debuting in third place behind \"Gran Torino\" and \"Bride Wars\".  Although the film wasn't viewed by critics as a good movie, its gross revenue still doubled its budget, and that's a relative success. \n"}, {"text": "Which 1999 film's tagline is \"In every mind there is a door that has never been opened\"?", "correct": "Stir of Echoes", "options": ["White Noise", "The House on Haunted Hill", "The Haunting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStir of Echoes.\n\n\t\"Stir of Echoes\" may have been one of the biggest horror sleeper hits of 1999.  Although the film didn't receive as much hype as other horror films of the year (eg. \"The Blair Witch Project\"), \"Stir of Echoes\" is a tension-driving supernatural thriller, directed by David Koepp (also known for \"Secret Window\" starring Johnny Depp).  The movie follows Kevin Bacon's character.  Soon after he's hypnotized, he begins experiencing weird, unnatural events in his house, culminating to the discovery that a girl may have been murdered in his own home.  When he discovers that his son sees the same things, he realizes that to save his sanity he must solve the mystery.\rEight years after the film's initial release, a sequel was produced for TV.  \"Stir of Echoes 2: Homecoming\" starred Rob Lowe, and although the film stayed under the same series, it featured few elements from the original works. \n"}, {"text": "\"Black Christmas\" was originally made in 1974.  Where was it filmed?", "correct": "Toronto", "options": ["Chicago", "Vancouver", "New York City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToronto.\n\n\t\"Black Christmas\" is considered to have been the first 'slasher' film ever released.  This classic holiday-horror was filmed in a Toronto sorority house in the 1970s and it features Andrea Martin (known for comedic roles on \"SCTV\") and Margot Kidder.  \"Black Christmas\" revolves around the days before Christmas and an escaped mental patient who has taken refuge in the attic of the sorority house.  As the girls start disappearing one by one, things really get serious.\rGrossing $4,000,000 originally, the film gained cult status because of its nature and fueled a fire of holiday-themed horror films such as \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\" and \"Jack Frost\".  Director Bob Clark also produced the popular Christmas movie \"A Christmas Story\" many years later, contrasting his work on this film and earlier work on \"Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things\".\r\"Black Christmas\" was remade in 2006, grossing $26 million.  Despite being critically panned, the film was quite successful.  It varied drastically from the original but held the same premise, even featuring Andrea Martin once more. \n"}]}
