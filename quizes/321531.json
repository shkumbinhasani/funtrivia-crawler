{"id": "321531", "name": "How To Read A Tire Online Trivia | Transport | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Transport", " Auto World"], "questions": [{"text": "When reading a tire size of P215/65R/15 95H, what does the 'P' represent?", "correct": "Passenger Tire", "options": ["Phlat Tire", "Pretty Tire", "Pirelli Tire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPassenger Tire.\n\n\tWhen a tire size begins with a \"P,\" it indicates the tire is a \"P-metric\" size. \"P\" rated tires are made to be fitted on vehicles that are primarily used as passenger vehicles. Passenger vehicles include cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and light duty pickup trucks.  P-metric sizes began in the 1970s and they are the most commonly used tire today. \n"}, {"text": "Reading a tire size of P215/65R/15 95H, what does the '215' represent?", "correct": "Width of the tire in millimeters", "options": ["Cost of the tire", "Diameter of the tire", "The date of manufacture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWidth of the tire in millimeters.\n\n\tThe 215 indicates this tire is 215 millimeters across from the widest point of its outer sidewall to the widest point of its inner sidewall when mounted and measured on a specified width wheel. This is also referred to as the tire's section width. \n"}, {"text": "Reading a tire size of P215/65R/15 95H, what does the '65' represent?", "correct": "Aspect ratio", "options": ["Expected life of tread (miles x 1000)", "Depth of tread", "Number of sipes per tire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAspect ratio.\n\n\tThe 65 indicates that this tire size's sidewall height (from rim to tread) is 65% of its section width. The measurement is the tire's section height, and also referred to as the tire's aspect ratio. The higher the number, the taller the sidewall. \n"}, {"text": "Reading a tire size of P215/65R/15 95H, what does the 'R' represent?", "correct": "Radial tire", "options": ["Radical tread", "Round tire", "Robust tread"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadial tire.\n\n\tThe R in the size indicates that the tire has a Radial construction.  In radial tires the body plies \"radiate\" out from the imaginary center of the wheel. Radial tires represent 98% of all tires sold. \n"}, {"text": "Reading a tire size of P215/65R/15 95H, what does the '15' represent?", "correct": "Diameter of rim", "options": ["Inflation pressure", "Depth of tread", "Pounds of torque on lug nuts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiameter of rim.\n\n\tThe 15 indicates the tire and wheel diameter.  You must match the diameter of the rim to the diameter of the tire. \n"}, {"text": "Reading a tire size of P215/65R/15 95H, what does the '95' represent?", "correct": "Load index", "options": ["Factory of manufacture", "Maximum inflation pressure", "Maximum operating temperature"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoad index.\n\n\tThe load index is the tire size's relative load carrying capabilities. In the case of the tire here the 95 identifies the tires ability to carry approximately 1,521 pounds.  Some other examples of load index/load carrying are; 82/1047, 88/1235, 102/1874 & 108/2205. \n"}, {"text": "Reading a tire size of P215/65R/15 95H, what does the 'H' represent?", "correct": "Speed rating", "options": ["Type of material used", "Heck if I know", "Heaviness of vehicle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpeed rating.\n\n\tSpeed ratings were established to match the speed capability of tires with the top speed capability of the vehicles to which they are applied.  Despite the tire manufacturer's ability to manufacturer tires capable of high speeds, none of them recommend the use of their products in excess of legal speed limits. The most common tire speed rating symbols, maximum speeds and typical applications are shown below:\r L 75 mph  Off-Road & Light Truck Tires \rM 81 mph   \rN 87 mph  Temporary Spare Tires \rP 93 mph   \rQ 99 mph  Studless & Studdable Winter Tires \rR 106 mph Light Truck Tires \rS 112 mph Family Sedans & Vans \rT 118 mph Family Sedans & Vans \rU 124 mph  \rH 130 mph Sport Sedans & Coupes \rV 149 mph Sport Sedans, Coupes & Sports Cars \rW 168 mph Exotic Sports Cars \rZ 186 mph Exotic Sports Cars \n"}, {"text": "In the US, who determines the standards of tire manufacture?", "correct": "Department of Transportation", "options": ["Consumer's Union", "U.S. Tire Counsel", "Individual manufacturers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDepartment of Transportation.\n\n\tThe U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Uniform Tire Quality Grade Standards (UTQG) were set up to provide customers with helpful information to help them purchase tires. These numbers are based on their relative treadwear, traction and temperature capabilities. When looking at UTQG ratings it is important to realize that the Department of Transportation does not conduct the tests. These ratings are assigned by the tire manufacturers based on their own test results or companies hired to do the tests. \n"}, {"text": "Most everyone knows the Michelin Man, but perhaps you don't know that he has an official name. What is it?", "correct": "Bibendum", "options": ["Barney", "Micah", "Puffy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBibendum.\n\n\tThe company's 'mascot' is Bibendum (aka \"Bib the Michelin Man\" or the \"Michelin Man\").  He was first seen in 1894.  Andre Michelin commissioned the image of 'Bib' after his brother Edouard noted that a display of stacked tires resembled a human form. \n"}, {"text": "Tires were invented by Benjamin Franklin Goodrich.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tCharles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber in 1844, used for the manufacturing of tires.\rIn 1888, John Dunlop invented the pneumatic tires (air-filled) but these were designed for bicycles. \rIn 1895, Andre Michelin was the first person to use pneumatic tires on an automobile, although his initial attempts were not successful. \rIn 1911, Philip Strauss invented the first successful pneumatic automobile tire, which was a combination of tire and an inner tube filled with air. \rThe Goodyear Tire Company patented the first tubeless tire in 1903, although it was not until years later that it was first used on the 1954 Packard. \rIn 1908, Frank Seiberling invented grooved tires with improved road traction. \n"}]}
