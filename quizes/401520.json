{"id": "401520", "name": "Stargate Origins: Catherine Quiz | Stargate Universe | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stargate Universe"], "questions": [{"text": "Who was cast as Catherine Langford for this series?", "correct": "Ellie Gall", "options": ["Janet Fraiser", "Amanda Tapping", "Samantha Carter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEllie Gall.\n\n\tGall was new to the \"Stargate\" shows, though her character was not. The character had appeared in both the \"Stargate\" (1994) movie and multiple episodes of \"Stargate: SG1\". She was played by Viveca Lindfors in the movie and Elizabeth Hoffman (season 1), and Elizabeth Hoffman (season 2) of the television show. \rKelly Vint Castro appeared in a flashback of the movie as the character as a child. \r For the web series, which launched in 2018, Gall played the character as a young adult. \rGall had played a main role in the TV series \"Mind Over Maddie\" prior to being cast as the lead of this series. \n"}, {"text": "What group of people knew how to use the Stargate, in modern times, before Catherine and her dad figured it out?", "correct": "Nazis", "options": ["Native Egyptians", "Time Travellers", "The Swiss Guard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNazis.\n\n\tProfessor Langford and his daughter were taken hostage by the Nazis while still in Egypt and he was forced to travel through the Stargate. Eventually, Catherine overpowered a guard and recruited her friends to help her go through the gate again to rescue her father.\rThis was vastly different from the established history of the Stargate and how it was first activated on Earth in modern times. The history had been established in 10 seasons of \"Stargate: SG-1\", 5 seasons of \"Stargate: Atlantis\" and 2 seasons of \"Stargate: Universe\", with more than 350 hours of backstory. \n"}, {"text": "How long had Catherine and her father been investigating the Stargate after it was discovered? ", "correct": "10 years", "options": ["3 weeks", "5 days", "9 months"], "explanation": "\n\n\n10 years.\n\n\tAfter 10 years of research, money was drying up and they were preparing to leave Egypt. They had figured out little about the Stargate at that time, only that it was metal whereas all the other artifacts from that time period were stone. They thought at the time it was melted meteorite but didn't really know. \n"}, {"text": "What did Catherine do just before pushing James through the Stargate?", "correct": "Kissed him", "options": ["Shot an alien", "Voided her stomach", "Screamed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKissed him.\n\n\tShe had already pushed Wasif (Shvan Aladdin) through the gate. She and James (Philip Alexander) had a moment together, and she kissed him.  He said it was unexpected, and she responded that they might not get another chance before pushing him into the wormhole generated by the gate.  Despite them leaving at different times, they all appeared on the alien planet within a second or two of each other. \n"}, {"text": "What alien race was on the other side of the Stargate?", "correct": "Goa'uld", "options": ["Asgard", "Tok'Ra", "Wraith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoa'uld.\n\n\tThis split from the established continuity of the other three live-action series and all three movies as well, exposing that Earth's Stargate was up and running decades earlier than it was otherwise known.\rBoth groups that went through the gate met Goa'uld symbiotes on the other side. They were led by Aset (Salome Azizi) who was nursing a child in the series. The child was a Harcesis, which is the human offspring of two Goa'uld symbiotes and carries the genetic knowledge of both lines of Goa'uld. Only one other is known to have even been born within the continuity of the series. \n"}, {"text": "The people of the alien planet believe that their gods walk among them.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tCatherine and one of the planet's natives, Kasuf (Daniel Rashid) had a discussion about how on Earth the gods don't walk among the people. Kasuf told her that he believes her gods still loved her. \rShe tried to convince him that his gods were lying to him, but he didn't yet believe her. (That storyline was key to the \"Stargate\" movie and other TV series.) \n"}, {"text": "What planet did Catherine, et. al. travel to?", "correct": "Abydos", "options": ["Dakara", "Chulak", "Lantea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbydos.\n\n\tAbydos is a big part of the \"Stargate\" mythos, also having been the planet that was first visited in the pilot of \"Stargate: SG-1\" and the \"Stargate\" movie. It is one of the most visited planets in the original series' first few seasons.\rThe visiting of this planet, further complicates the overall timeline of the other series, as it would take away the surprise of when the team travels to the planet in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Why did the people who captured Catherine and her friends start to treat them better?  ", "correct": "She had the 'Eye of Ra'.", "options": ["She was revealed as a woman.", "She nursed one of them back to good health.", "She defended them from an attack."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe had the 'Eye of Ra'.\n\n\tCatherine accidentally showed her captors a necklace. The necklace had the \"Eye of Ra\" on it, which was the symbol of the Goa'uld who posed as the god of their planet. Once the captors assumed they were friends of Ra's they started to treat them with respect. \n"}, {"text": "Wilhelm Br\u00fccke was given the gift of immortality by one of the aliens he came across.  ", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tBr\u00fccke, played by Aylam Orian, negotiated a treaty with Aset for a rock (Naguadah) with immense powers. One of those powers was to run some Goa'uld technology that granted everlasting life. However they weren't given the actual technology, and Br\u00fccke ends up dying before the end of the series. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Catherine find the seventh symbol needed to return to Earth?", "correct": "In a cave", "options": ["In a journal", "Randomly on the gate", "From Wilhelm Brucke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a cave.\n\n\tCatherine was taken to a cave that had many paintings while she and Kasuf were talking. In the cave she found the full gate address to return home. After getting the address, she destroyed that small piece of the drawing so that no one else could get the symbols.\r At the end of the 10th episode, in order to return things to the full continuity of the existing canon, the Goa'uld wiped the memories of the adventure from the surviving Earthlings and issued hidden orders for Catherine to go back and assemble a team that would one-day destroy Ra. That is exactly what happened over the course of the \"Stargate: SG-1\". Ra came down and killed the Goa'uld for not telling him about the Stargate being in use again, and also killed nearly all of the people in the village, only Kasuf was shown to survive. \n"}]}
