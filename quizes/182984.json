Which of these individuals is described here?  ", "correct": "Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger", "options": ["Max Schultze", "Carl Wilhelm Scheele", "Heinrich Schwabe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErwin Schr\u00f6dinger.\n\n\tSchr\u00f6dinger was born in 1887 and died in1961, both life events occurring in Vienna.  He rose to fame in the late 1920s/early 1930s with several publications on quantum/wave mechanics.  His most famous contribution to physics is his eponymous equation, which can be read about here:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%F6dinger_equation.  His name is also attached to a thought experiment known as  Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat.  Details on this can be found here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%F6dinger%27s_cat. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the founder of the Greco-Roman tradition of thought was Socrates, a 5th century luminary of ancient Athens.  Which of the following is not true about Socrates?  \n", "correct": "He was the teacher of Aristotle, another philosophical great", "options": ["He was tried and found guilty of heresy and corrupting the youth of Athens", "He fought in several battles during the Peloponnesian War", "No writings by Socrates exist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was the teacher of Aristotle, another philosophical great.\n\n\tSocrates lived from 470 to 399 B.C., most of that time being spent as a teacher and philosopher.  He taught a number of extraordinary pupils, including Plato and Xenophon (Aristotle was, in turn, a pupil of Plato).  In his younger years, Socrates fought for Athens in the Peloponnesian War, nearly dying in the Battle of Delium. Most famous for his 'Elenchos' (Socratic Method), Socrates was known to engage in verbal question and answer sessions with friends and enemies alike, and he usually got the best of his opponent!  Socrates never wrote down his ideas, leaving that task for his pupils.  Much of Plato's works are seemingly the recordings of the dialogues of Socrates. The trial and execution of Socrates is recorded in Plato's 'Apology'. \n"}, {"text": "Known as the founder of the planned parenthood movement in the United States, Margaret Sanger pioneered the introduction of birth control methods, especially for poor women.  What was Sanger's profession?  ", "correct": "Nurse", "options": ["School teacher", "Lawyer", "Secretary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNurse.\n\n\tMargaret Sanger lived from 1879 to 1966, and during most of her years she advocated for the reproductive rights of women in the United States and across the world.  After being forced to leave the United States in 1914 as a result of public outcry over her distribution of informational pamphlets on reproductive rights, Sanger published 'What Every Girl Should Know', a book which introduced young women to sexuality, menstruation and a host of other related topics.  After returning to the United States, Sanger founded both the American Birth Control League (1921) and Planned Parenthood of America (1942).  Some of Sanger's views were rather controversial, including some discussions in her writings on eugenics.  Nonetheless, her influence on the rights of women in America (and worldwide) has been profound. \n"}, {"text": "Several years before Galileo made his famed experiments involving falling bodies, this Dutch philosopher performed similar experiments disproving Aristotle's assertion that heavier bodies fall faster than light ones.  Who was this fellow, relatively unknown to us today?  ", "correct": "Simon Stevin", "options": ["George Stahl", "Baruch Spinoza", "Gustav Sp\u00f6rer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSimon Stevin.\n\n\tWhile Galileo's famed experiment atop the Leaning Tower of Pisa (most likely, it did not happen there!) occurred in 1589, Stevin's similar experiment took place in 1586.  Hence, Stevin had proven Aristotle's assertion about the inequality of fall rates depending on mass several years prior to the great Pisan scientist.  Stevin's greatness does not end there, however.  Stevin is also responsible for the law of equilibrium on inclined planes, the 'hydrostatic paradox' (related to pressure on a column of liquid) and a formal proof of the impossibility of perpetual motion.  Stevin also introduced the decimal system into popular use in the sciences, and is known as the 'Father of Hydrostatics' (largely because of the hydrostatic paradox).  He also invented sliced bread (okay, I made that one up). \n"}, {"text": "Also known as the Bhagavatpada Acharya, this late 8th, early 9th century Indian philosopher revived Hinduism at a time when it was struggling with Buddhism for supremacy in much of south Asia.  What was this enlightened individual's name?   ", "correct": "Sankara", "options": ["Siddhartha", "Sakyamuni", "Shivaji"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSankara.\n\n\tSankara, whose dates are not certain but lived during the late 700s, early 800s A.D., promoted a pure form of Vedic Hinduism at a time when Buddhism was at its zenith in south Asia.  Through Sankara's reformist influence, Hinduism was given a fresh face that had mass appeal for spiritualists, clergy and laymen alike.  It is very likely that without Sankara's influence, Buddhist spirituality would continue to threaten Hinduism today in India. \n"}, {"text": "Often called the 'Father of Economics', Adam Smith was an intellectual giant of the 18th century.  In which country was Mr. Smith born?  ", "correct": "Scotland", "options": ["England", "Ireland", "Wales"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScotland.\n\n\tAdam Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland in 1723.  He studied at Oxford before becoming a professor at Glasgow University.  His greatest work of literature was his 'Wealth of Nations', but Smith first became famous after the publication of his 'Theory of Moral Sentiments'.  In these works Smith laid out his ideas on human society, politics and, most importantly, economics.  The profound influence of his ideas on future philosophers, political scientists, politicians, sociologists and economics cannot be underestimated.  Many of his ideas are alive and strong to this very day, particularly in countries that employ liberal/capitalist economic systems. \n"}, {"text": "If Adam Smith is the 'Father of Economics', William Shakespeare might well be called the 'Father of Modern English Literature'.  This great of the late 16th, early 17th century is enjoyed by millions of literature lovers throughout the world.  What is the proper term for this love of William Shakepeare's literature?  ", "correct": "Bardolatry", "options": ["Shakesolatry", "Hagiolatry", "Avonolatry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBardolatry.\n\n\tShakespeare was called 'The Bard' ('bard' is a generalized term meaning 'poet'; when capitalized, it especially references Shakespeare).  The influence of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets, and more importantly, his 38 plays on the English language has been profound and long lasting.  Arguably, no single author has had more influence on a language than has Shakespeare on the English language.  And, by golly, his plays sure are entertaining! \n"}, {"text": "Unfortunately, sometimes bad guys make lists of important and influential people.  Case in point, Joseph Stalin, the dictator who ruled the Soviet Union with an iron fist for nearly 30 years.  Born Josif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili, he chose the name 'Stalin' as a sign of strength.  What does the name Stalin mean?  ", "correct": "Man of steel", "options": ["Iron man", "Concrete", "The Rock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMan of steel.\n\n\tStalin became Secretary General of the Soviet Communist Party in 1922, and achieved sole power of the political and military machinery in the Soviet Union by the early 1930s.  Under Stalin's virtual dictatorship millions suffereed and perished.  His style of politics greatly influenced Mao Zedong in China, among a number of other dictators. \n"}, {"text": "This man was the first president of Indonesia, and the founder of the Indonesian state.  What was the name of this key figure in the history of that country?  ", "correct": "Sukarno", "options": ["Suharto", "Sulu", "Sulawesi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSukarno.\n\n\tAfter leading the Indonesian independence movement against the Dutch, the colonial rulers of the 'East Indies' for centuries, Sukarno became president of the newly formed nation of Indonesia in 1945.  While Sukarno was corrupt in many respects, he did help create some cohesion among the many disparate cultures represented on the thousands of islands that make up the nation of Indonesia.  His rule was ended in 1967 after a coup by General Suharto, but his influence on his country (and the region) cannot be denied. \n"}, {"text": "Probably the first genuine 'emperor' in history was this monarch, who united Mesopotamia under his rule in approximately 2335 B.C.  What was his name?  ", "correct": "Sargon", "options": ["Strabo", "Shalmaneser", "Solomon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSargon.\n\n\tSargon of Akkad ruled Mesopotamia from (approximately) 2335 to 2280 B.C.   During his reign he united the Sumerian Empire with Syria and parts of Persia under one rule.  The precedent Sargon provided of empire building was followed in generations to come by other rulers, each trying to top his predecessors.  \r My apologies to those who might have chosen the following individuals for their lists: Ignaz Semmelweiss, William B. Shockley,\rJoseph Smith, Sophocles, Sun Yat-sen, Carl Scheele, Theodor Schwann, Matthias Schleiden, Seneca, Herbert Spencer, Benedict Spinoza, Christophe Sholes, Upton Sinclair, Solomon, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Suharto, Suleyman, Thomas Sydenham, Strabo, Strato and Saladin.  There are simply too many great 'S's in history!  I might just have to make an 'almost made it' quiz in honor of these folks.\r I hope that you enjoyed this quiz and learned a thing or two.  I invite you to try the other quizzes in this series, as well as others on my quiz list. \n"}]}
