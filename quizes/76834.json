{"id": "76834", "name": "For 'Blues Brothers' Diehards, Part 4 Online Quiz | Movies | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", " The Blues Brothers"], "questions": [{"text": "Jake Blues (John Belushi) and Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) are handed an unpleasant surprise after playing their first impromptu gig with their reunited band: the club owner informs them that not only will he not be paying the band, but the band actually owes the club owner money! How much money does the band owe the owner?", "correct": "$100", "options": ["$200", "$300", "$400"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$100.\n\n\tAs Bob (of Bob's Country Bunker) explains: 'The gig pays $200, and you boys drank $300 worth of beer.' The difference, then, is one hundred dollars. \n"}, {"text": "Jake only managed to land the reunited band's first unusual gig by pretending that the Blues Brothers Band was The Good Ole Boys. From what state do The Good Ole Boys hail?", "correct": "Tennessee", "options": ["Missouri", "Texas", "Oklahoma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTennessee.\n\n\tWhen The Good Ole Boys' mobile home finally pulls into the lot of Bob's Country Bunker, the words 'Direct from Nashville!' can be seen on the side of the vehicle.  Nashville is in Tennessee. \n"}, {"text": "In almost every single film directed by John Landis, the phrase 'see you next Wednesday' can be either heard or seen. Where does this phrase appear in 'The Blues Brothers'?", "correct": "It's printed on a billboard", "options": ["It's written on a picket sign at the anti-Nazi demonstration", "It's spoken by Jake", "It's spoken by the Reverend Cleophus James"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's printed on a billboard.\n\n\tAs Jake and Elwood buzz past a speed-trap, we see that the police car is hiding behind a billboard containing the words 'See You Next Wednesday.' John Landis is an almost maniacal Stanley Kubrick fan, so he latched on to this seemingly throwaway phrase spoken by the parents of astronaut David Poole in '2001: A Space Odyssey.' \n"}, {"text": "The Blues Brothers Band manages to score a major gig at the Palace Hotel. According to Elwood's incessant P.A. announcements, on what road would one find the Palace Hotel?", "correct": "Route 16", "options": ["Interstate 80", "Route 66", "Route 55"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoute 16.\n\n\tStated several times. \n"}, {"text": "How much is the cover charge for the Blues Brothers Band's big show at the Palace Hotel?", "correct": "two dollars", "options": ["one dollar", "five dollars", "three dollars"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwo dollars.\n\n\tElwood (over the P.A.): 'That's a lot of entertainment!' Jake: 'For two dollars.' Elwood (over the P.A.): 'For two dollars.' \n"}, {"text": "Jake and Elwood's major contribution to the marketing of their big show is driving around the state, announcing the show via a makeshift P.A. system mounted atop the Bluesmobile. At one point, the boys take stock of the counties they have driven through thus far. Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Cook County", "options": ["Dupage County", "Lake County", "McHenry County"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCook County.\n\n\tJake: 'So far, we've covered Lake, McHenry, and part of Dupage County.' Kind of odd that they never mention their stomping ground, Cook County...but then, Curtis (Cab Calloway) and the kids from the orphanage seem to have that part of town taken care of, via word of mouth and posters. \n"}, {"text": "Thanks to a rather complex series of events, Elwood winds up impersonating a gas station attendant. After he fills up the tank of 70's supermodel Twiggy's car, how much does he charge her?", "correct": "$94", "options": ["$104", "$74", "$84"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$94.\n\n\tElwood: 'That'll be...ninety-four dollars.'

Which of the following words or phrases can NOT be seen on any of these signs?", "correct": "Club Ambrosia", "options": ["The Radium Club", "Savoy", "The Cotton Club"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClub Ambrosia.\n\n\tThe signs are presumably meant to represent the myriad clubs where Calloway performed throughout his career. \n"}, {"text": "After obtaining a table at the Palace Hotel Ballroom, parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) orders a round of drinks for himself and the state troopers accompanying him. What rather esoteric drink does he obtain for every man at the table?", "correct": "orange whip & an orange whip & three orange whips & orange whips", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\norange whip & an orange whip & three orange whips & orange whips.\n\n\tAn Orange Whip contains orange juice, crushed ice, Dream Whip, and (I'm not kidding here) a package of instant vanilla pudding. Kind of an odd choice there, hmm? \n"}, {"text": "When Jake and Elwood finally take the stage, Elwood has a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist. What's in it?", "correct": "a harmonica", "options": ["We never find out", "a pair of sunglasses", "sheet music"], "explanation": "\n\n\na harmonica.\n\n\tOnce on stage, Elwood opens the briefcase, retrieves the harmonica, and un-cuffs himself from the empty briefcase. \n"}, {"text": "Which song is NOT performed by the band at the Palace Hotel Ballroom?", "correct": "Gimme Some Lovin'", "options": ["Everybody Needs Somebody To Love", "Sweet Home Chicago", "All of these songs are performed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGimme Some Lovin'.\n\n\tThe only time in the movie that we hear even part of 'Gimme Some Lovin' is when the band tries to open their set with it at Bob's Country Bunker. They're shut down immediately by the crowd, so we never hear them perform the whole song at any point in the film. \n"}, {"text": "As Jake and Elwood are trying to sneak out of their Palace Hotel show, they are approached by a man who offers them a record deal. For what company does this man work?", "correct": "Clarion Records", "options": ["Center Stage Records", "Keynote Records", "Spotlight Records"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClarion Records.\n\n\tAt first, the boys think that the Clarion Records representative is a mafioso. \n"}, {"text": "The record executive offers Jake and Elwood an advance on the spot if they agree to make an album for him. How much does the man offer them?", "correct": "$10,000", "options": ["$5,000", "$15,000", "$20,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$10,000.\n\n\tPlenty of money to pay the Cook County Assessor, Ray's Music Exchange, and the band members. \n"}, {"text": "In the storm drain, Camille (Carrie Fisher) finally reveals why she's been trying to kill Jake:  he stood her up at the altar. According to Camille's dialogue, how many guests were left in the lurch at the would-be wedding?", "correct": "300", "options": ["250", "350", "400"], "explanation": "\n\n\n300.\n\n\tAnd yet Jake still manages to disarm Camille -- both figuratively and literally -- with a single moment of eye contact. \n"}, {"text": "An easy one to close out this second-to-last 'Blues Brothers' quiz: According to Elwood, how many miles from Chicago is the Palace Hotel?", "correct": "106", "options": ["96", "100", "90"], "explanation": "\n\n\n106.\n\n\tElwood: 'It's 106 miles to Chicago. We got a full tank of gas; half a pack of cigarettes. It's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses.' \r Jake: 'Hit it.' \r The final installment in this gargantuan quiz is coming soon, so keep your eyes peeled! \n"}]}
