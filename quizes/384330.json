{"id": "384330", "name": "The Ultimate Gerald's Game Quiz | Stephen King", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Stephen King", "Gerald's Game"], "questions": [{"text": "In what state does the book take place?", "correct": "Maine", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaine.\n\n\tJessie Burlingame and her husband, Gerald, are up on Lake Kashwakamak, Maine for a possible overnight getaway when Gerald's idea of a sexual game results in her being handcuffed to the bedpost.  She's not really into the idea of it and, rather than go through with anything, she makes it clear that she's not interested in these types of kinky scenarios. Gerald doesn't really hear anything of it though, and proceeds to force himself on her until she kicks him in the groin.  When she does though, he falls to the ground, hitting his head on the floor.  She realizes she may have killed him.  This is, of course, a bit of an issue. She's still cuffed to the bed, and no one's around to help her. \n"}, {"text": "What is the former name of the dog that appears in the cabin?", "correct": "Prince", "options": ["Fido", "Spot", "Cujo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrince.\n\n\tGerald's body never rises from the floor while Jessie tries to figure out what's just happened to her.  She feels regret for what she's done and tries to come to terms with the events that have unfolded by speaking to the voices in her head while working at tugging her cuffs free of the crossbeams (which doesn't work).  Another issue emerges in the form of a stray dog named Prince who, following the smell of Gerald's blood from outside the house and in through a broken door, enters the room to find some much-sought-after food. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Jessie have on her headboard?", "correct": "Glass of water", "options": ["Notepad", "Photographs", "Eyeglasses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlass of water.\n\n\tJessie, afraid, throws a heavy ashtray off the headboard at the dog and it seems to frighten it a fair bit, but it's not enough.  Prince begins to eat at Gerald, tearing off a piece of him just out of Jessie's sight from the bed.  She has no choice, cuffed to the bed, but to watch what's happening.  As the dog departs, at least temporarily, she tries to keep her mind off other repressed traumas in her life, particularly the summer she had at Dark Score Lake, the year she hit puberty.\r Realizing how thirsty she is, Jessie fights to grab the glass of water on the headboard, finding it difficult with her hands cuffed.  Fortunately, she's able to slide the shelf around on the brackets above, inevitably allowing the wet glass to slide into her hand...but her chains are too short to drink it. \n"}, {"text": "Jessie hears several voices in her head throughout the story.  Which is not one of them?", "correct": "Gerald", "options": ["Ruth", "The UFOs", "Goodwife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGerald.\n\n\tAfter putting back the glass, Jessie gets an idea-- she can use the thick magazine subscription card on the headboard to fashion a straw and get to her water from her short distance.  She's successful in this, and puts the rest back for later, just in case.  Before falling asleep she also comes to terms with the voice in her head, that of her old roommate from college-- Ruth-- though it's clear that it's not actually Ruth in her head. While Jessie sleeps, Prince returns to the house but senses a certain darkness and retreats into the nearby woods.  Jessie faces it first-hand when she awakens.  There's a figure in the corner, almost like a man, and it grins at her before opening a travel case filled with bones and trinkets. The figure is gone by morning. \n"}, {"text": "What event occurred when Jessie and her family visited Dark Score Lake?", "correct": "Eclipse", "options": ["Earthquake", "Flood", "Meteor shower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEclipse.\n\n\tWhile she sleeps, Jessie remembers what prompted the events leading to the eclipse on Dark Score Lake so many years ago.  Instead of joining her mother and siblings elsewhere to watch the event, she convinced her Dad to stay at the cabin to watch the sun slide behind the moon.  After her parents' argument, her idea came true. On the day they went out to watch it on the balcony, her father instructed her on how to view the eclipse before an altogether inappropriate event occurred, greatly affecting Jessie for the rest of her life, though she would never know the extent of it until she was much older. Awakening from the dream, Jessie remembers everything that happened after that. \n"}, {"text": "Jessie discovers that the bed is too heavy for her to move while she's still on it.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tJessie realizes, after waking up, that it's getting more difficult to move her arms.  Having slept in the cuffs, a good deal of strain was placed on her limbs and the loss of blood has numbed them.  When she gets feeling back, she finishes off the rest of her water (easier this time) and continues recalling her traumatic experiences at Dark Score Lake, particularly her father's emotional manipulation to prevent Jessie from revealing what he really did to her during the eclipse. She ultimately believes that she can't tell her mother, for fear of being to blame.  Still trapped on the bed, Jessie considers trying to reach the phone across the room, but finds that the bed is too heavy. She doesn't have many options, as it would seem. \n"}, {"text": "What name does Jessie give to the figure in her bedroom?", "correct": "The Space Cowboy", "options": ["The Wanderer", "The Man in Black", "The Crimson King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Space Cowboy.\n\n\tJesse falls asleep once more, partly due to her own inactivity in the bed, and believes she may have dreamed about the man in the corner of her room again, knowing that he may be the grim spectre of death seeking her soul.  She doesn't know if he was a dream or not, but considers him to be otherworldly, some sort of cosmic stranger. She nicknames him the 'Space Cowboy' from Steve Miller's song \"The Joker\".  She also sees something in the room with her, on the floor.  There's a muddy footprint next to Gerald's body, and what seems to be a pearl earring she never owned.  She considers using a jar of face cream on the shelf to try and slide her hand out of the handcuffs, but this plan fails when the jar slips from her hand. A voice of her younger self tells Jessie to think back to the eclipse, and when she does, she realizes an escape.  Her escape: the glass.  She'll need to cut herself with the drinking glass, but it's better than the alternative. \n"}, {"text": "How many pairs of handcuffs is Jessie able to open using the keys?", "correct": "One", "options": ["Three", "None", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tJessie, knowing she simply needs to get the job done, breaks the glass swiftly on the headboard and begins her work.  She cuts around the wrist and tries to use the blood to lubricate the hand and, pulling, she begins to tear through the cuff.  Of course, this pull begins to tear the flesh from her hand, and the only way out is to perform the degloving procedure. She must, and she successfully pulls free of the handcuff as most of her deformed hand comes free.  She gets to her feet and, with some leverage, begins to pull the bed, still cuffed by one arm to the frame.  She reaches the dresser and, carefully, unlocks the left cuff, finally freeing herself from the bed altogether. \n"}, {"text": "Jessie attempts to escape the cottage in which of these?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Boat", "Ambulance", "Taxi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tJessie drinks from the tap in the bathroom and wraps a makeshift tourniquet around her mangled arm before popping a few Aspirin for the blinding pain.  Realizing she needs to get out before nightfall or else face the Space Cowboy again, she tries the phone and finds it dead.  Finding there to be no other option, she hastily puts on some clothes and heads for the door, intending to drive out to the highway, but she collapses on the bed.\r She awakens about an hour later and it's dark outside.  Fearing the Space Cowboy she heads out to leave the cottage but finds him awaiting her in the study.  She pulls herself away and out to the Mercedes, barely able to get it started and to drive out to the highway, and when she does she looks into the rearview mirror to see the spectre of death sitting behind her.  The car crashes and she falls unconscious. \n"}, {"text": "Jessie discovers that there was, in fact, someone alive with her in the cabin while she was cuffed to the bed.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tJessie survives the incident in the woods, awakening the next morning with no one in the back seat of her car and being found and rushed to the hospital.  The police question her and believe her when she says she doesn't remember some of the more ludicrous details of her time in the cabin.  Several months later, after a tough rehabilitation, she decides to write a letter to Ruth. She tells her the truth: she believes her Space Cowboy is still watching her at all times.  She describes the aftermath of the event in her letter as well as the lingering questions in her mind before mentioning Raymond Andrew Joubert, the man who may have been in the house with her-- the Space Cowboy. All evidence pointed to him being the man from the cabin, and with the help of one of Gerald's colleagues, she was able to see him in court, confront him, and spit in his face.  Jessie sends off the letter, finally coming to terms with the horrors of her life, and sleeps restfully. \n"}]}
