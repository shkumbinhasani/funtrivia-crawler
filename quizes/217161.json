Featuring the coming-of-age story of the 14th Dalai Lama, the film is evocative of so many emotions.  What is its title?", "correct": "Kundun", "options": ["Tenzin", "Llamo", "The Lama"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKundun.\n\n\t'Kundun' features the acting of an almost entirely non-professional Tibetan cast (with the exception of the bit Chinese parts, which are played by professional actors).  The role of the Dalai Lama is played by four young men of varying ages.\r Not surprisingly, the movie was shot in Morocco, not Tibet.  Scorsese was banned from Tibet after the film was issued to the public. \n"}, {"text": "Featuring Jack Nicholson as a neurotic writer, Helen Hunt as a struggling waitress and Greg Kinnear as an unfortunate artist, which film of 1997 meandered its way through the lives of these three people?", "correct": "As Good as It Gets", "options": ["High Art", "Happiness", "What Dreams May Come"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs Good as It Gets.\n\n\tFor their acting efforts in the film, Nicholson and Hunt both won Academy Awards.

Who ably directed this fascinating film?", "correct": "Steven Spielberg", "options": ["Milos Forman", "James L. Brooks", "Francis Ford Coppola"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteven Spielberg.\n\n\tPerhaps the best part of 'Amistad' happened to be the acting, particularly the efforts of Djimon Hounsou as Cinque and Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams, the former U.S. president.  Spielberg was even able to convince former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun to appear as Associate Justice Joseph Story in the film! \n"}, {"text": "Directed by Mike Newell, this film features Johnny Depp as an FBI agent who has infiltrated the Mafia hierarchy.

Alongside her is featured Robert Forster as the very low-key Max Cherry, bail bondsman.  The cast also features Samuel Jackson as the creepy Ordell Robbie, Robert De Niro as the burnout criminal Louis Gara, Bridget Fonda as surfer, wastoid Melanie and Michael Keaton as ATF agent Ray Nicolette.  In addition, check out one of Chris Tucker's over-the-top performance as the junkie Beaumont Livingston. \n"}, {"text": "For many, the best film of 1997 was 'L.A.

Aside from Crowe, Spacey and Pearce, Danny DeVito and James Cromwell also appeared.

Surprisingly most of the lines in the film were indeed scripted. \n"}, {"text": "An animated masterpiece of almost unsurpassed beauty, 'Princess Mononoke' first hit theaters in 1997.
