Hopper says that that's his fault and admits to having hidden her the whole time.  He takes Mike into another room, alone, and lays out everything, apologizing even though Mike is furious with him.\rOut in the living room, Dustin and Lucas welcome Eleven back and Max tries to introduce herself only to get the cold shoulder.  Eleven instead hugs Joyce and heads into the bedroom to see Will.  Eleven admits to already knowing since she saw him in the blackness.  Joyce asks if she can close the gate for them.\rDown at the entrance to the gate, the demogorgons await their next move. \n"}, {"text": "Hopper, trying to find a new spot for Will, tells Joyce and Jonathan to take him to which location?", "correct": "His cabin", "options": ["Chicago", "The police station", "The lab"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis cabin.\n\n\tMrs. Wheeler reads a romance novel by candlelight in the bath while her husband sleeps in his chair in front of the television.  He doesn't hear the doorbell ring continuously, so she has to get it.  When she does, it's Billy, who immediately starts flirting with her.  She assumes he's there for Nancy, but he's actually there for Max and he was told that Lucas and the others frequently hang out at the Wheeler household.  Instead, she gives him the address for the Byers'.\rHopper worries, meanwhile, that the group of them won't be able to get back into the lab to close the gate.  Eleven insists she can do it, but even if she does, as Mike says, they risk killing Will since he's a part of the Mind Flayer's army.\rJoyce is taken aback by the suggestion that Will could die and immediately thinks about how to rid her son of the virus within him.  She quickly realizes that they've been giving it what it wants the whole time-- access to cold, for instance-- and they decide to make his body uninhabitable.  To do this, Hopper sends Jonathan and Joyce out with Will, directing them to his cabin since it's a place Will has never been.\rSteve tells Nancy to go with Jonathan.  She tries to apologize, but Steve is over it; he may have been a lousy boyfriend, but he seems to have found a calling as a babysitter.  Hopper, meanwhile, leaves with Eleven to go to the lab.  Steve stays with the kids. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin, claiming that scientists will want to study the demo-dog in the Byers household, tells Steve to put it where?", "correct": "In the fridge", "options": ["In a bed", "In his car", "In a box"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the fridge.\n\n\tOn the drive to the lab, Hopper asks Eleven where she's been and she admits she went to see her mother.  She admits she shouldn't have left; Hopper admits he should have been there and apologizes for himself, saying he's like a black hole in one of Sarah's picture books.  Eleven asks who Sarah is, and it becomes apparent he's never told her about his daughter in all their time together.\rBack at the Byers house, Dustin forces Steve to cram the dead demo-dog into the kitchen fridge to leave it for scientists to analyze.  Mike worries about Eleven and Steve tells him there's nothing they can do without risking their lives, but that doesn't phase the kids.  Instead, they formulate a plan to go in through Hopper's entry-hole in the pumpkin patch and to the hub under the lab to set a fire and distract the hivemind, giving Eleven an opportunity to close the gate.  Steve says no, but that's when a car can be heard revving up in the driveway. \n"}, {"text": "Who ends up knocking out Billy during his fight in the Byers house?", "correct": "Max", "options": ["Lucas", "Steve", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMax.\n\n\tMax looks out the window to find Billy driving up the laneway and realizes he'll kill her and Lucas if he finds them there.  Steve heads out to intercept and send Billy away, but the kids make it clear they're there and a fight ensues.  Billy ends up barging in and grabbing Lucas, but Steve starts throwing fists and hitting back.  Steve ends up on the floor before long, but Max ends the fight by jamming a syringe of sedatives into her step-brother's neck and knocking him out cold.  She grabs the nail bat and threatens him until he says he understands not to mess with her or her friends.  She grabs Billy's keys and tells them they need to head out.\rJoyce, Nancy, and Jonathan finally reach Hopper's cabin and set up everything they need, tying Will to the bed and getting all of the heating devices they can to start flushing the Mind Flayer out of his system.\rHopper and Eleven reach the lab to the sounds of the Demogorgons in the distance.  Eleven worries since her memories of the building are terrifying and Hopper tells her he'll do the heavy lifting before they head in. \n"}, {"text": "Who drives the kids to the pumpkin patch?", "correct": "Max", "options": ["Steve", "Mrs. Wheeler", "Billy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMax.\n\n\tThe kids toss Steve into Billy's car having bandaged some of his battle wounds and he awakens to find Max behind the wheel and Lucas navigating their way to Hopper's hole.  He screams at the kids to stop the car, but they continue on and make it to the pumpkin patch.  She reminds them-- she's the zoomer.  Steve makes it clear they're not going into the hole, but Dustin says he's just in a bad mood; they have to help their fellow party member, and if he needs to keep them safe because he promised Nancy, they have his things in the car.  They outfit themselves and descend into the tunnel.\rMeanwhile, Will wakes up in Hopper's cabin, appearing to be sweating out the Mind Flayer.  He screams that it hurts and begs to be let go but Joyce, remembering Bob, cranks up the heat. \n"}, {"text": "In the tunnels, who's blasted in the face with the Upside-Down's spores?", "correct": "Dustin", "options": ["Mike", "Max", "Lucas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDustin.\n\n\tIn the lab, Hopper and Eleven navigate the corpse-laden hallways of the upper floors, descending into a stairwell until Hopper comes across Dr. Owens wounded in a corner.  Hopper moves in to help and Eleven makes her presence known, to Owens' shock.  Hopper admits he's been harbouring her and suggests that maybe, when everything is over, he could help her out a bit.  They end up making it to the control room in the basement as Hopper advances with his gun in hand.\rIn the tunnels, Steve and the kids continue onward and Dustin is blasted in the face by the spores of one of the pustules on the ceiling.  Fortunately, his goggles and facemask protect him.  They all make it to the hub on the map and start drenching it in all manner of flammable liquids.\rThings continue to heat up in Hopper's cabin as Jonathan urges his mother to let Will go.  Nancy stops him though, and they watch as something scales up Will's neck and empowers him to break the ties around his wrists.  He lashes out as his mother with his free hand and begins to strangle her.  He only lets go when Nancy grabs a fire poker from the stove and places it against his hospital gown. \n"}, {"text": "Dustin is able to subdue Dart using which of these?", "correct": "Chocolate", "options": ["Music", "Heat", "A hug"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate.\n\n\tIn the tunnel, Steve grabs his lighter and sparks a flame just in time.  It has an effect almost instantly and he and the kids are forced to flee as the tunnel's tentacles spread word through the hivemind.  On the way out, Mike is snagged by one of the tunnel's tentacles.  In Hopper's cabin, the creature releases itself from Will's body and flees into the night.  Jonathan turns off the heaters.  In the lab, Hopper watches as the demo-dogs descend into the tunnel in the floor.  He and Eleven get the word from Jonathan that Will is okay and says to close the gate.  They hop into the shaft and descend towards the bottom, eventually stopping to begin the closing process.  Eleven tries her best to seal the gate, but a shadow from the other side looms.\rIn the tunnels, Steve takes the nail bat to the tentacle trapping Mike as the kids are found by a demo-dog.  Surprisingly, Dustin is able to identify it as Dart and, telling the others to trust him, he pulls a Three Musketeers bar from his bag.  After eating its nougat, Dart lets them pass without harm and Dustin says his goodbye. \n"}, {"text": "Is Eleven able to close the gate?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tEleven remembers the horrifying things that happened to her in the past, and that memory allows her to start sealing the gate once and for all.  It doesn't stop the demo-dogs from pursuing the kids through the tunnels though.  Steve sends Max, Lucas, and Mike up through the hole in the pumpkin patch, but he's too late to send Dustin and himself up.  It turns out to be okay though; the demo-dogs run right past.  Mike realizes that Eleven must be at work.\rShe is.  In the shaft, her work continues to close up the tunnel and block off the Mind Flayer, but it attracts the demo-dogs and Hopper has to start using his gun, switching weapons repeatedly as he runs through his ammunition.\rSomething horrifying emerges from the gate and reaches out towards Eleven, but she fends it off, lifting off the floor and telekinetically forcing it back while she finally seals the gate.  As she does this, power surges through Hawkins.  The demo-dogs' link to the hivemind is severed.  Hopper grabs Eleven as the two remain suspended in the tunnel in the dark. \n"}, {"text": "Eleven is allowed to have a night out for which of these events?", "correct": "A school dance", "options": ["A birthday party", "A concert", "A vacation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA school dance.\n\n\tOne month later, the Hawkins lab is sealed off as a restricted area.  Murray Bauman watches as the military drives off, vacating the premises.  Jonathan and Nancy's tape leaks out and Barb's family gets closure, albeit from an untrue story, but closure nonetheless.  Hopper heads to the bar for a talk with Dr. Owens and receives a birth certificate for Jane Hopper.  Owens says to give it a year to be safe, but Hopper asks for his adopted daughter to have one night out before then.  It is, after all, the Hawkins Middle School Snow Ball.\rAs the ball nears, Joyce teaches Will to dance while Jonathan films.  At the Wheeler house, Mike ends up on several Polaroid photos he mother takes.  Lucas practices talking to Max by talking to himself in the mirror.  Max lets her mother do her hair.  Dustin looks for his hair spray while his mother looks after their new cat, 'Tews'.  Steve drops him off at the dance after a pep talk. \n"}, {"text": "Eleven and Mike share a kiss together.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDustin makes it into the dance to find the others already there.  They make fun of his hair before Cyndi Lauper's \"Time After Time\" starts to play, giving Lucas the opportunity to ask Max to dance.  She calls him a stalker and pulls him to the dance floor, inevitably giving him his first kiss.  Will is asked to dance as well, even if he's called 'zombie boy'.  Dustin heads over to a group of girls and confidently walks over to ask the popular girls to dance, but finds rejection after rejection until Nancy dances with him.  This, of course, gets the other girls' attention, and Nancy tells him to wait a few years before the girls will be falling over each other to get him.\rOutside, Hopper finds Joyce waiting at her car and offers her a cigarette.  He puts an arm around her and tells her that things will get easier.\rAs the song changes to The Police's \"Every Breath You Take\", Mike spies Eleven entering the gymnasium.  He tells her she looks beautiful and the two figure out how to dance together before sharing a quick kiss.\rAs the dance continues on in the middle school gymnasium, the Mind Flayer hulks over the Upside-Down's version of Hawkins Middle School and watches it intently. \n"}]}
