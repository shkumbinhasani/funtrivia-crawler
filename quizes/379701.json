Over the next 18 months, the album returned to the top spot on eight occasions, spending a total of 33 weeks at number one. It also topped charts around the world and it would eventually become the best-selling album of the entire 1970s. Whose album was this?", "correct": "Simon & Garfunkel", "options": ["Led Zeppelin", "The Beatles", "The Rolling Stones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSimon & Garfunkel.\n\n\tRecorded in November 1969 and released on Columbia records in January 1970, \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" was the fifth and final studio album by Simon & Garfunkel. Despite the enormous success of this album, both critical and commercial, the duo decided to part company later in 1970. \r The album won two Grammy Awards, plus four more for the title single which topped the UK singles chart for three weeks in March 1970 and the Billboard Top 100 chart in the USA for six weeks from late February. The album also included another single, \"The Boxer\", which has subsequently become a classic although it failed to top any singles charts. Both \"Cecilia\" and \"El Condor Pasa (If I Could)\" were also released as singles. \r Of the alternatives, The Beatles' final two albums both topped the UK album chart in 1970: \"Abbey Road\" made it to number one in December 1969 and remained there for six weeks, and \"Let It Be\" was number one for three weeks in May-June 1970. Led Zeppelin's second album, \"Led Zeppelin II\", gave those future rock legends their first number one album on both sides of the Atlantic in February 1970 and \"Led Zeppelin III\" repeated the process in November. The Stones topped the UK chart for two weeks in September 1970 with \"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert\". \n"}, {"text": "The break-up of The Beatles produced solo projects from all four former members. Three of the four produced albums that topped the UK chart in 1971.

The album included the worldwide number one single \"My Sweet Lord\". \r This would be the only Harrison studio album to top the UK chart, although he did return to number one in January 1972 with \"The Concert for Bangladesh\", a live collaboration with Bob Dylan and others. His fourth studio album, \"Living in the Material World\", topped the USA, Australian and Canadian album charts but stalled at number two in the UK. \r Of the alternatives, Paul and Linda McCartney topped the UK album chart in June 1971 with \"Ram\". \"Imagine\" by John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band topped the chart in October-November 1971. Only Ringo Starr failed to produce a number one solo album: his first studio album, \"Sentimental Journey\" (in 1970) and his third, \"Ringo\" (in 1973) both reached number seven, his best chart position in the UK. \n"}, {"text": "Released in September 1971, \"Electric Warrior\" reached number one in the UK album chart in mid-December and stayed there throughout January 1972. Although this was the only studio album by this English rock band to make it to number one, they did have two further chart-toppers in 1972 with compilation albums.

Rex\n\n\tOriginally named Tyrannosaurus Rex when they were founded in 1967 as the vehicle for the talents of vocalist and guitarist Marc Bolan, the group shortened their name to T. Rex in 1970. Their eponymous debut album using the revamped name reached number seven in 1970 and spawned the singles \"Ride a White Swan\" (number two) and the first of their four chart-topping singles, \"Hot Love\".\r The singles, \"Get it On\" (their second UK number one and their only US Top Ten single) and \"Jeepster\" (number two in the UK) both came from \"Electric Warrior\". Their final two singles, \"Telegram Sam\" and the band's biggest hit, \"Metal Guru\", both came from the 1972 album \"The Slider\", which reached number four in the UK album chart. \r T. Rex topped the UK album chart twice more in 1972, with the release of \"Prophets, Seers & Sages/My People Were Fair\", a compilation double album that topped the chart briefly in May 1972, and with \"Bogan Boogie\", another compilation album that spent three weeks at number one in May-June 1972. \r Of the alternatives, English folk-rock group Lindisfarne scored their only number one album with \"Fog on the Tyne\" in March 1972. Rock legends Deep Purple scored their only UK number one album (and the first of only two Top Ten albums in the US) with \"Machine Head\" in 1972.

Their third studio album, \"Slayed\" topped the UK album chart for twice (although only for a total of three weeks) in early 1973. The album also spawned the group's third number one single, \"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\", as well as \"Gudbuy T'Jane\", which reached number two. \r The group had previously reached number two in the UK album chart in 1972 with the live release, \"Slade Live!\".

Keyboard-player Rick Wakeman famously ordered and ate a Chinese takeout on stage whilst the rest of the group played just one track from this album.\r The next four Yes albums would also climb into the Top Ten in the UK, although of those four only \"Going for the One\" (in 1977) topped the chart.\r Of the alternatives, The Carpenters had scored four Top Five albums in the US in the first four years of the 1970s, but achieved their first number one on the east side of the Atlantic in 1974 with the compilation \"The Singles: 1969-1973\", the best-selling album of the year.

Who is this singer?", "correct": "Rod Stewart", "options": ["Max Boyce", "Elton John", "Jim Reeves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRod Stewart.\n\n\t\"Atlantic Crossing\" was Rod Stewart's sixth studio album and also his fifth consecutive UK number one. \"Every Picture Tells a Story\" had topped the charts in both the UK and the US in 1971, and \"Never a Dull Moment\", the compilation album \"Sing it Again, Rod\" (1973) and \"Smiler\" (1974) had all reached number one in the UK. \"A Night on the Town\" would also top the chart in 1976, the last of his studio albums to do so until \"Time\" in 2013 although he did record another number one with \"Greatest Hits Vol 1\" in 1979.\r The cover of the Sutherland Brothers song from \"Atlantic Crossing\" that rocketed to number one in the UK singles chart was \"Sailing\". A second single from the album, \"This Old Heart of Mine\", reached number four. \r Of the alternatives, Elton John entered 1975 at the top of the UK album chart with \"Elton John's Greatest Hits\", which had perched at number one since November and remained there until early February. This followed three consecutive number one releases with \"Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player\" and \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" in 1973 and \"Caribou\" in 1974.

The single from the album, released in October 1975, was \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and it seems remarkable today that the record company didn't want to release it and radio stations refused to play it because it was too long. In a 2012 poll by ITV, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" topped the voting to find \"The Nation's Favourite Number One\".\r Of the alternatives, Led Zeppelin topped the chart twice in 1976, with \"Presence\" and the live album \"The Song Remains the Same\", numbers six and seven in a remarkable run of eight consecutive number one albums. ABBA topped the chart in 1976 with a \"Greatest Hits\" compilation, which is amazing really after releasing only three previous albums (two of them number ones).
