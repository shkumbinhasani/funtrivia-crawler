Good luck!\n\nWhich 3-letter word meaning 'close to the ground' can be found in the colourful CLOWNFISH?", "correct": "Low", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLow.\n\n\tClownfish are very brightly coloured - mainly orange with a few white stripes. In the ocean, clownfish live with other sea creatures called anemones. The anemones are poisonous to other fish so they make a good place for the clownfish to hide. You may have seen some clownfish in the 2003 Pixar film 'Finding Nemo', in which both Nemo and his dad Marlin are clownfish. \n"}, {"text": "What 3-letter word meaning 'a mode of transport' can be found inside the COMMON CARP?", "correct": "Car", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCar.\n\n\tThe common carp is a freshwater fish, meaning that it lives in rivers and lakes and not in the open sea (where the water is much saltier).

This means that if you want to keep a Siamese fighting fish as a pet, you should make sure to only have one in a single tank. \n"}, {"text": "What 3-letter word meaning 'to throw something very far' can be found in the funny-looking BLOBFISH?", "correct": "Lob", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLob.\n\n\tBlobfish are not the most attractive fish in the world, though they probably know that given the name that humans have given them.

If you keep goldfish as pets, make sure not to leave them in the dark as they lose their golden colour. \n"}, {"text": "What 5-letter word meaning 'beneath' can be found in the humble FLOUNDER?", "correct": "Under", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnder.\n\n\tThe flounder is a type of flatfish that like to spend their time near the ocean floor. They can use the colouring of the sea floor to hide themselves and then catch their dinner by surprise.

Real flounders are a lot flatter than Flounder! \n"}, {"text": "What 3-letter word meaning 'friend' can be found in OPALEYE?", "correct": "Pal", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPal.\n\n\tThe opaleye, also known as the rudderfish, is actually an ocean-dwelling species of a family of fish called chubs.
