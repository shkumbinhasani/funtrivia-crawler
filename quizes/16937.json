{"id": "16937", "name": "'Star Trek' Goofs Quiz / Test | 'Star Trek' - Themed Quizzes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Star Trek Universe", "'Star Trek' - Themed Quizzes"], "questions": [{"text": "'TNG' episode 'Starship Mine' and movie 'Generations': What substance is Commander Riker ignorant of in the movie, despite it being the focus of the episode cited?", "correct": "trilithium", "options": ["corbomite", "latinum", "synthehol"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntrilithium.\n\n\tA highly unstable substance, it's a by-product of warp engines. \n"}, {"text": "TNG episode 'Relics' and movie 'Generations': What has Scotty somehow forgotten when he's retrieved from the Jenolen's transporter buffer?", "correct": "Capt. Kirk's death", "options": ["His American Express card", "His name", "His right middle finger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCapt. Kirk's death\n\n\tUpon hearing that Riker and LaForge are from the Enterprise, Scotty exclaims that Kirk must've brought it out of mothballs to come find him. Yet he was witness to what was recorded as Kirk's death when the Nexus ripped the section from the Enterprise-B that Kirk was in. (BTW, James Doohan *is* missing a finger. He lost it during WWII.) \n"}, {"text": "TOS episode 'Where No Man Has Gone Before': What does Spock give Kirk in the Rec Room that he shouldn't have been able to?", "correct": "smile", "options": ["Slurpee", "handshake", "high-five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsmile.\n\n\tHe smiles when discussing Earth emotions. Although Vulcans do have emotions, they mask them most of the time. He shouldn't have smiled during such a trivial conversation. However, his happy outburst at the end of 'Amok Time' was justified. \n"}, {"text": "TOS episode 'Space Seed' and movie 'The Wrath of Khan': Who knows Khan even though he arguably shouldn't?", "correct": "Chekov", "options": ["Dr. David Marcus", "Capt. Terrell", "Kirk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChekov.\n\n\t'Space Seed', the episode that TWOK was based on, aired in the first season of TOS. Chekov didn't appear until the second season. However, there's a convoluted explanation: The 7th episode of the 2nd season, 'Catspaw', is stardated 3018.2. Chekov appears in it. 'Space Seed' is stardated 3141.9. So Chekov could've been an unseen crewman, and Khan *did* memorize quite a bit of info about the Enterprise before his insurrection. \n"}, {"text": "Movie 'The Voyage Home': What is the mistake with the Finnish whaling boat?", "correct": "Finland has never hunted whales", "options": ["it was too small to handle humpback whales", "it has an alarm bell, which whaler don't use because it'd scare their prey", "it changes color"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinland has never hunted whales.\n\n\tThe crew was speaking Finnish, albeit crudely. \n"}, {"text": "TNG in general, also episode 'Dark Page': What type of accent does Deanna have?", "correct": "it's never stated", "options": ["Indian", "Greek", "Betazed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nit's never stated.\n\n\tThe goof with this? Both of her parents, Lwaxana (Majel Barrett) and Ian (Amick Byram) speak 'unaccented'. (He is seen and heard in a mental flashback.) Actress Marina Sirtis is Greek, but normally speaks with an English accent. What her Troi accent is supposed to be is only known to her. \n"}, {"text": "TOS vs. other productions: The Klingons looked mostly humanoid in TOS. But the Klingons have cranial and dorsal ridges in 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and all subsequent productions. How was this explained?", "correct": "Genetic Manipulation", "options": ["Two different 'races' amongst Klingons. The ridged ones achieved prominence after TOS.", "Never explained", "Military Klingons were surgically altered for covert missions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenetic Manipulation.\n\n\tThe first time they had a chance to, in DS9 ep 'Trials and Tribble-ations', Worf just basically said that he didn't want to talk about it.  It was later explained in the prequel series 'Enterprise' as genetic manipulation. \n"}, {"text": "TNG, DS9: What is O'Brien's rank?", "correct": "Chief Petty Officer", "options": ["Commander", "Lieutenant", "Ensign"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChief Petty Officer.\n\n\tAt first, he was just address as Conn (his position). Then in a 2nd season, he was addressed as lieutenant by Riker just before transporting somewhere (O'Brien even had two pips). But then after Worf's father addressed O'Brien as chief, that's been his rank. \n"}, {"text": "TOS ep 'Metamorphosis' and movie 'Star Trek: First Contact': Why is Zefram Cochrane so much older in the movie (set in the 21st century) than in the TOS ep (set in the 23rd)?", "correct": "radiation exposure", "options": ["cosmetic surgury", "Vulcans gave him anti-aging medicine", "optical illusion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nradiation exposure.\n\n\tThe official line is that Cochrane was only about 35 in the movie, and was just aged from his exposure to the radioactive substances he was exposed to in constructing his FTL ship. 'Later', when he met the Companion on Gamma Canaris N, she healed him and made him younger too. \n"}, {"text": "Movie 'The Wrath of Khan': Scotty's nephew, Peter, was a new member of the Enterprise's engineering staff. Peter was mortally injured during their first battle with Khan. What important thing could Scotty have done that might have saved his life?", "correct": "taken him to Sick Bay", "options": ["ordered him out of Engineering", "told his sister not to let him join StarFleet", "given him Vulcan regeneration pills"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntaken him to Sick Bay.\n\n\tAfter the battle, as damage reports are coming in, Scotty dramatically appears on the Bridge holding the burned and bloody Peter. You'd think a loving uncle would've taken him to Sick Bay first. \n"}]}
