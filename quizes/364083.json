Which elfin, Belgian born actress, in one of her earliest roles, plays the part of Chiquita?  ", "correct": "Audrey Hepburn", "options": ["Eartha Kitt", "Jean Harlow", "Zsa Zsa Gabor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAudrey Hepburn.\n\n\tIn one of her earliest film roles, Audrey Hepburn only appears for a very brief moment, less than twenty seconds in fact; just long enough to be handed a small quantity of banknotes by Holland and told to 'run along and get yourself a little birthday present', before she kisses him on the cheek and leaves. Although Hepburn appears on this sole occasion during the film, due to its eventual success it is considered that her appearance as Chiquita was her first major film role.  Hepburn went on to become one of the most famous actresses of her time, with perhaps her most famous roles being Princess Ann in the 1953 film 'Roman Holiday' and Holly Golightly in the 1961 romantic comedy 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'.  Other actors in minor roles that went on to have successful careers in later years were Robert Shaw, who appeared as a young forensic technician and BBC children's television presenter Valerie Singleton who presented 'Blue Peter' for many years during the 1960s and 1970s but received no credit for her part in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Arthur Pendlebury, destined to become Holland's accomplice, is doing what when they first meet?

After introducing himself and then helping Pendlebury to move his belongings into the building, Holland is invited to have a look around Pendlebury's business premises.During this visit to Pendlebury's place of work, the final hurdle in Holland's plan to carry out his plans for a bullion robbery, disappears when Pendlebury tells him that he has a means of exporting goods abroad; 'By Jove, Holland, it's a good job we're both honest men!'... 'It is indeed Pendlebury', states Holland as he stares knowingly at his new accomplice. \n"}, {"text": "Which brand of cigarettes can be purchased from the vending machine that can be seen in the entrance foyer of the Balmoral private hotel; the hotel in which Holland and Pendlebury are living?  ", "correct": "Craven 'A'", "options": ["Marlboro", "Lucky Strike", "Player's Navy Cut"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCraven 'A'.\n\n\tCraven 'A' was a popular brand of cigarettes, in the United Kingdom especially, during the 1940s and 1950s.

During their holiday they make a visit to the Eiffel tower only to discover that, due to an error in translation the marked crates had been opened and that six of the golden towers had been sold to a party of English schoolgirls who had just left. Both Holland and Pendlebury chase the school party down to the street but fail to catch them; they both realise that they must now return home and retrieve the purchased souvenirs. \n"}, {"text": "After their farcical encounter with French customs at Calais, Holland and Pendlebury trace the schoolgirls back to their school in London.

The young lady hands over her tower which becomes the subject of a police demonstration into forensic science. The tower is taken and placed in a sample of nitric acid; one of the few substances that will dissolve any metal except pure gold.  As the golden gift fails to dissolve, the police realise what they have in their possession.  The tower is snatched in desperation by Pendlebury who attempts to escape with it, closely followed by his accomplice Holland, both being hotly pursued by a number of police officers. \n"}, {"text": "During the final car chase, the antennas of the damaged police cars and that of the civilian involved, a ruddy-cheeked farmer, are wrapped around each other.
