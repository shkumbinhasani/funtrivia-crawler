", "correct": "Primate", "options": ["Butterfly", "Cat", "Snake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrimate.\n\n\tWith less than 2,000 individuals left, the golden lion tamarin is one of the most endangered monkeys in South America. This tiny arboreal primate has lost over 95% of its native habitat, an occurrence that is unfortunately all to familiar for the wild animals of the South American rainforest. The golden lion tamarin lives in, kinship groups, and are known to move from place to place each day.

This unique looking dog might be considered South America's answer for the North American coyote. This unusual-looking short legged dog will scavenge alone as well as hunt in packs. They are capable of bringing down any of the large species of animals indigenous to South America when pack hunting.They have long bushy fur similar to that of the domestic chow chow, with a brown fur that is lighter on the belly. For many years it was only known by outsiders from cave fossils, and is the only member in its genus \"Speothos\". Its closest relative is the maned wolf which although taller, is much lighter in weight and can be found in some of the same areas.Both are endangered species who are threatened by habitat loss and loss of prey animals for consumption. \n"}, {"text": "Found in South American rivers, which of the following is a small, freshwater fish known for its sharp teeth?", "correct": "Piranha", "options": ["Barracuda", "Pike", "Mako"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPiranha.\n\n\tAlso known as caribes, the piranha is world famous for its huge appetite. There are many subspecies of piranha that live in the Amazon basin and the rivers that make up this very rich ecosystem. Though not a large fish, their voracious appetite and extremely sharp teeth allow a school of these fish to make short work of any large animal unfortunate enough to fall into their midst.Sadly, ignorance and curiosity have led to people importing these fish into areas that are far from their indigenous habitat. When these owners realize they cannot meet the needs of this carnivorous fish, they release them into the freshwater rivers, lakes and ponds in their area where they are now wreaking havoc. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is the best description of a colocolo?", "correct": "A small spotted cat", "options": ["A skinny sharp toothed fish", "A bright green and red parrot", "A black and white striped horse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA small spotted cat.\n\n\tThe beautiful colocolo is a small spotted wild cat that also has stripes for added decoration to its already magnificent fur.

They usually only give birth to one or two kittens which is the norm for most wild cats and have a life span in the wild of approx 12 years. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following South American animals is most closely related to the American alligator?", "correct": "Black caiman", "options": ["Abronia lizard", "Green iguana", "Turnip-tailed gecko"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack caiman.\n\n\tAll options all reptiles found in South America, but it is the caimans who belong to the family Alligatoridae whose only other family member is American alligators. There are several varieties of caiman, also spelt cayman, but the black caiman is the largest and can grow to lengths of 15 ft (4.5m). At one time this animal was very numerous but was hunted almost to the point of extinction for its valuable hide.The darker color of the black caiman absorbs heat as well as providing camouflage while this deadly carnivore is hunting. The other options are all smaller lizards found in the rainforests who are all fighting their own wars against loss of habitat. \n"}, {"text": "Most South American sloths are considered folivores meaning that they like to eat which of the following options?", "correct": "Leaves", "options": ["Ants", "Nuts", "Worms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeaves.\n\n\tA folivore is an herbivore that gets most of its nutrition from leaves.

They can be found in forests with altitudes from sea level up to 8,000 ft (2,500m). They are omnivores who will eat whatever is available. Even with these adaptations, continued destruction of the South American rainforest has the potential to decimate their populations. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is a venomous South American snake?", "correct": "Bushmaster", "options": ["Sidewinder", "Puff Adder", "Black Mamba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBushmaster.\n\n\tThe bushmaster is the largest of the snakes known as pit vipers.

Fuertes's Parrot was declared extinct in 1911 and was found to still be living in Colombia in 2003. All three birds are still considered to be critically endangered as are many other forms of South American wildlife. \n"}]}
