{"id": "314772", "name": "The Muggle Side of Harry Potter Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "Harry Potter"], "questions": [{"text": "The Muggle world and the wizarding world may be mostly separate, but they can't help meeting when a witch or a wizard is born into a Muggle family. Which of the following magical people was NOT Muggle-born?", "correct": "Sirius Black", "options": ["Hermione Granger", "Lily Potter", "Justin Finch-Fletchley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSirius Black.\n\n\tThe Blacks were a \"pure-blood\" family; Sirius, Harry's godfather, knew their heritage didn't make them superior to anyone else, but the rest of the Blacks were another story! Hermione was born to a pair of Muggle dentists. Justin's family had wanted him to go to Eton (a famous Muggle school, for those who don't know), but he was soon able to explain the advantages of having a wizard in the family. As for the family of Lily Potter, Harry's mother -- well, it's hard to get more Muggle than her sister Petunia! \n"}, {"text": "The simple fact of sharing the planet makes some formal discussions necessary between wizards and Muggles. According to \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,\" with which Muggle(s) does the Minister of Magic officially consult?", "correct": "The Prime Minister", "options": ["The House of Lords", "The captain of Manchester United", "The dons of Magdalen College"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Prime Minister.\n\n\tAs explained by Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic until just after the events of \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\" \"The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day. We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.\" Meetings are arranged via the intermediary of an ugly, magical portrait on the wall of the Prime Minister's office.It appears that, initially, the Minister of Magic may have been meant to be subordinate to the Muggle Prime Minister -- for example, the wizards have to tell the Prime Minister whenever they want to import \"highly dangerous creatures\" like dragons -- but, by Harry Potter's time, they were essentially two parallel governments.After all, as Fudge explained, the Prime Minister \"was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community.\" \n"}, {"text": "The signs of wizarding civilization are hidden in plain sight, in the unexamined nooks and crannies of Muggle life. Every year on September 1, countless wizarding families descend on a single Muggle site, where they see their children off on their way to Hogwarts school. From where in London does the Hogwarts Express depart?", "correct": "King's Cross Station", "options": ["Piccadilly Circus", "Paddington Station", "Kew Gardens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKing's Cross Station.\n\n\tThe Hogwarts Express, a bright scarlet steam train, collects its passengers from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at King's Cross Station. When he had to catch this train for the first time in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" poor young Harry was terribly confused by the platform number: all he could see were Platforms Nine and Ten! Luckily, the Weasley family -- obviously a magical lot -- happened by at just the right moment, and explained the secret.\"All you have to do,\" Molly Weasley told him, \"is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten ... Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.\" He took it at a run, and the barrier melted away ... and a world of magic was revealed. \n"}, {"text": "Muggles are a constant source of fascination to many wizards. One Muggle fan, the father of a friend of Harry's, was always pestering him to explain some Muggle miracle, like telephones or postboxes. Who was this man, who loved tinkering with Muggle machines and once made a Ford Anglia fly?", "correct": "Arthur Weasley", "options": ["Amos Diggory", "Lucius Malfoy", "Xenophilius Lovegood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArthur Weasley.\n\n\tArthur Weasley, Ron's father, worked for many years at the Ministry of Magic's Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. His job was to protect Muggles from seemingly ordinary but enchanted objects. Whenever such things escaped into the world at large, it meant cover-ups, Memory Charms, and hours of overtime.\r Given his career, Mr. Weasley's hobby of tinkering with Muggle objects caused great frustration to his family. \"If he raided OUR house,\" his son Fred observed in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,\" \"he'd have to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.\" \n"}, {"text": "Dementors, soulless shapeless creatures that suck the hope and joy out of the world, are among the wizarding world's most frightening inhabitants. But when witches and wizards are recovering from a close encounter with dementors, they reach for a remedy that can be found in any Muggle corner shop. What is it?", "correct": "Chocolate", "options": ["Aspirin", "Butterbeer", "Cough drops"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChocolate.\n\n\tWe first encounter dementors in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\": employed as prison guards by the Ministry of Magic, they were involved in the search for Sirius Black. Professor Lupin described them vividly: \"They glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence ... Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you.\" Ordinary chocolate helps: it builds a feeling of warmth that conquers the dementors' chill. \n"}, {"text": "Sadly, wizards' attempts to learn from Muggles don't always go well. In \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\" a magical healer experimented on Arthur Weasley's snakebite injury with unfortunate results. With what Muggle remedy did he attempt to close Mr. Weasley's wounds?", "correct": "Stitches", "options": ["Rhinoplasty", "Antibiotics", "Skin grafts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStitches.\n\n\tAugustus Pye, a Trainee Healer at St. Mungo's, got the idea just before Christmas, and the Muggle-mad Mr. Weasley was a willing guinea pig. But the stitches didn't work any better than magical methods had, and poor Mr. Weasley was left to explain things to his rather more skeptical wife. \"It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,\" she told him, \"but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be THAT stupid...\" \n"}, {"text": "Wizards often use Muggle things to disguise their most precious possessions. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gameskeeper, had lost his right to use magic after he was expelled from school -- but that didn't stop him. In what ordinary object did he hide his old school wand?", "correct": "A flowered, pink umbrella", "options": ["A large pair of spectacles", "A lion-headed cane", "A hippogriff-feather quill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA flowered, pink umbrella.\n\n\tHagrid's career as a Hogwarts student ended decades before Harry's time, when Tom Riddle (the future Lord Voldemort) framed him for opening the Chamber of Secrets and unleashing the murderous creature within. After his expulsion, his wand was broken in half and he was forbidden to use magic ever again, but he hid the pieces in his trusty umbrella and bent the rules a bit during his employment at Hogwarts. He cast Engorgement Charms on his pumpkins and made Harry's cousin grow a pig's tail -- the usual things, really. \n"}, {"text": "At the beginning of \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,\" Harry was in quite a fix. The Dursleys had locked him up to keep him away from Hogwarts, and using magic to free himself would only get him expelled! Luckily, when his friends arrived to break him out, they knew a Muggle trick or two. Who picked the lock and freed Harry?", "correct": "George Weasley", "options": ["Hermione Granger", "Ron Weasley", "Hagrid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Weasley.\n\n\tThree of the Weasley brothers -- Ron and the twins, Fred and George -- turned up outside Harry's window late one night, having \"borrowed\" their father's enchanted, flying car. To avoid running afoul of the laws on underaged magic, George used a hairpin to pick the lock on Harry's bedroom door and retrieve his school things. While his brother worked, Fred explained the rationale: \"A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick, but we feel they're skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.\" \n"}, {"text": "Muggle objects save lives! Colin Creevey, a Muggle-born boy a year behind Harry, survived \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" because of his \"ordinary Muggle camera.\" Since he was looking through the viewfinder, he was turned to stone instead of being killed. What was the terrible creature that would kill you if you looked it directly in the eye?", "correct": "A basilisk", "options": ["A sphinx", "An acromantula", "A boggart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA basilisk.\n\n\tThe basilisk was released from the Hogwarts basements by Ginny Weasley, who was in the thrall of Lord Voldemort's shade. The enormous snake was supposed to kill the Muggle-born students at the school; Hermione's research revealed that it \"has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death.\" Luckily, none of the students it attacked got a direct look: like Colin, they saw it only through something or reflected from something, so they were Petrified, not killed. In the wizarding world, Petrification is, fortunately, a curable condition. \n"}, {"text": "Harry Potter's last living relatives, the Dursleys, were far from the best of Muggles, yet they gave the wizarding world one of its greatest gifts. For as long as young Harry could call his blood relations' house a home, he had some measure of protection against Voldemort. When was this charm set to expire?", "correct": "On Harry's seventeenth birthday", "options": ["On Harry's wedding day", "On Harry's graduation from Hogwarts", "After ten years"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn Harry's seventeenth birthday.\n\n\tThis protective charm was set in motion by Albus Dumbledore, when he lay the newly orphaned baby on the doorstep of his last relatives in the world. The Dursleys were neglectful and cruel, even to the point of locking the young boy in the cupboard under the stairs -- but the houseroom was enough for the charm, even without the love. The charm could never have lasted beyond Harry's coming-of-age on his seventeenth birthday, but, in \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" Harry and his allies broke it a few days early in an effort to get the jump on Voldemort. \n"}]}
