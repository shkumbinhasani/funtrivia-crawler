{"id": "97237", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Showtime' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of the episode we find our favorite M*A*S*H residents enjoying the performance of a trio of female singers.  Following their performance they are introduced to us as the ______ sisters.  (Please fill in the blank)", "correct": "Miller", "options": ["Andrews", "Johnson", "Osmond"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiller.\n\n\tThe Miller Sisters are played by Marilyn King, Jean Turrell and Joan Lucksinger.  Honestly, they perform rather well, giving a good rendition of an early 50s singing trio.  They are introduced by Joey Forman, who plays a seemingly unsuccessful comedian called Jackie Flash.  Forman was a bit part actor who may be recognized by fans of 'Get Smart' and/or 'The Joey Bishop Show'. \n"}, {"text": "Surprisingly, and at long last, Trapper is featured as the lead character in the operating room (early on it was nearly always Hawkeye).  The young soldier that Trapper operates on has been wounded in which area of the body?", "correct": "Chest", "options": ["Leg", "Abdomen", "Head"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChest.\n\n\tIn a strange turn of events, Trapper gets to play medical hero in this episode, perhaps Larry Gelbart and the other creators realized that they had been somewhat unbalanced with the two main characters, giving Hawkeye all the glory, so they made this attempt to even things a bit.  Ironically, Trapper is working on a chest case, normally Hawkeye's specialty.  I think it's safe to say that there was some confusion as to what should be done with the Trapper character in the early years, and this perhaps helped lead to the departure of Wayne Rogers after season 3. \n"}, {"text": "While Trapper, Margaret and Ugly John sweat it out in the O.R., Colonel Blake and Radar are dealing with a problem of their own in Blake's office, namely how to get a hold of the Colonel's wife in the hospital where she is in labor.  Eventually she gives birth...but to a boy or a girl?", "correct": "boy & a boy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nboy & a boy.\n\n\tColonel Blake's wife has a son, 7 lbs, 2 ozs and 21 inches long!  Naturally Henry is very proud of his new son, his first (he already had two daughters) but at the same time he's spiteful of the fact that he cannot hold his son in his arms.  Radar rectifies this at the end of the episode by convincing a Korean woman to lend Henry her baby boy to hold for a short while.  Radar did a lot of 'little' things for people during the series...what a swell fellow...I hated to see him go after the 8th season. \n"}, {"text": "Is it true or false that Colonel Blake is the only regular M*A*S*H character whose wife gives birth during the course of the series?  (With 'course of the series' meaning, that character's time on the show!)", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tYou may dispute this, imagining that perhaps B.J.'s daughter Erin could have been born during the fictional time of the series run, but by the time B.J. arrives on the show, his wife has already long since given birth.  Trapper and his wife are also parents, but again, these kids were born prior to Trapper's arrival on the series. Colonel Potter's daughter also gives birth during the run of the show, but of course...that ain't his wife!  Speaking of Colonels' wives...Henry calls his wife 'Mildred' in this episode, oops!  I guess later on they changed her name to Lorraine.  They seemed fond of the name Mildred on this show, Trapper's old girlfriend (or fling?) in Chicago was called Mildred and so was Colonel Potter's wife. Hmm...I think I'd better get some help for this M*A*S*H addiction... \n"}, {"text": "With half the gang in the O.R. and the Colonel and Radar busy calling Henry's wife, Hawkeye finds himself alone with Father Mulcahy in the mess tent eating some army slop.  Sitting near Hawkeye is Captain Kaplan, the camp dentist, who has just received his orders to return home.  Kaplan is rather paranoid about his return home, believing that nearly anyone or anything nearby might 'jinx' him.  Which of these behaviors does he not display during this episode?", "correct": "Avoiding eating for fear of food poisoning", "options": ["Avoiding opening his travel orders for fear of a paper cut", "Spraying the steering wheel of his jeep with disinfectant", "Avoiding using the latrine for fear of infection"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvoiding eating for fear of food poisoning.\n\n\tKaplan, played by Harvey J. Goldenberg appeared in one other episode, 'Major Fred C. Dobbs', as the camp dentist.  If you recall during that episode, he had a very odd laugh... \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters makes his/her final appearance on 'Showtime'?", "correct": "Ugly John", "options": ["Ho Jon", "Spearchucker", "Lt. Dish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUgly John.\n\n\tHo Jon, Spearchucker and Lt. Dish were all dumped earlier on in the first season, it seems that the producers wanted to whittle down the ranks of the cast a bit and finalize things for the 2nd season.  John Orchard, the actor who played Ugly John, the anesthesiologist, does make one more appearance on M*A*S*H during the 8th season, in an episode called 'Captains Outrageous'.  In that episode he plays an officer called Captain Muldoon who regularly takes bribes from Rosie in return for protection against the MPs. \n"}, {"text": "While it was normally the case that Trapper and Hawkeye would torture Frank with endless practical jokes during the early seasons of M*A*S*H, in this episode Frank pulls a series of pranks on Hawkeye.  Which of these was not one of the brilliant schemes concocted by Frank in order to 'get' Hawkeye?", "correct": "Rigging the sink in the O.R. so that no water would come out", "options": ["Rigging a bucket of water to fall on Hawkeye's head", "Rigging the still so that water would spray Hawkeye's face", "Rigging the faucets in the showers so that the levers wouldn't work properly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRigging the sink in the O.R. so that no water would come out\n\n\tStrangely, all of the pranks involved water...is there something Freudian that I'm missing?  At any rate...another change of pace for the first season, I suppose that the writers once again wanted to even the score a bit during this episode.  Surely Frank needed to get some revenge against Hawkeye for all the nasty little shenanigans that he and Trapper pulled on Frank! \n"}, {"text": "Aside from the trio of sisters and the comedian, an acoustic band performs, and Radar is featured playing with this band.  At which musical instrument does Radar (aka Gary Burghoff) prove quite adept in 'Showtime'?", "correct": "Drums", "options": ["Bass", "Piano", "Accordian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrums.\n\n\tRadar pulls off a drum solo that is quite amusing, I must say...he really goes to work on them.  If memory serves me correctly, he is featured at least one other time playing the drums, but I can't recall in which episode. \n"}, {"text": "Back to Captain Kaplan, our paranoid camp dentist.  Does he make it out of camp safely during this episode, despite his paranoid attempts to protect himself?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tOf course he doesn't, this is a comedy after all!  While attempting to drive his way out of camp he accidentally steps on the gas pedal in place of the brake!  The intended driver of the jeep, who becomes his passenger, is not harmed but Kaplan suffers a broken arm and a broken leg.  He jinxed himself! \n"}, {"text": "Naturally, Hawkeye could not just sit back and allow Frank to have all the laughs at his expense.  Near the end of the episode, Hawkeye retaliates with a big prank of his own, victimizing poor Frank once again.  How does Hawkeye get his revenge?", "correct": "Pulls the tent around the latrine while Frank is doing his business", "options": ["Pulls the tent pole out from under Margaret's tent while Frank is visiting", "Places Frank in a box with airholes, carrots and lettuce", "Places Frank's arm in a cast with a hook at the end"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPulls the tent around the latrine while Frank is doing his business.\n\n\tAll of these other pranks occurred, but not in this episode!  I hope you enjoyed this hodge-podge quiz, but beware...it won't be the last... \n"}]}
