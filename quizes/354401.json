In the hotel are countless zombies, ready to attack and slash whatever comes near them.  Let's only hope you can survive.\n\nWhich video game would fit the description?", "correct": "Left 4 Dead 2", "options": ["Call of Duty 2", "Halo 2", "Assassin's Creed II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2.\n\n\tThe survival horror video game \"Left 4 Dead\" was released in 2008 (xBox360 and PC); its sequel released in 2009.  You can choose your weapons.  A pistol is good if you do not want to get too close to the vicious zombies, but you can run out of ammo, which is, of course, a deadly thing to happen.  Other melee weapons can be used, such as a hatchet, a crowbar, a frying pan, or what have you, but, of course, this means you'll be much nearer the bloodthirsty villains of the night. \n"}, {"text": "After some horrifying slashing, it was nice that you were transported to a nice little home, sitting on the roof, staring at the night sky.  Of course, you were curious why mushrooms that give sun pieces were growing everywhere, but once you saw the zombies crawling in, you realized you needed a few peashooters.\n\nWhich video game would this be?", "correct": "Plants Vs. Zombies", "options": ["Death by Botany", "Undead Empire", "Dr. Mario's Zombie Attack"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlants Vs. Zombies\n\n\tThe award-winning 2009 game \"Plants Vs. Zombies\" (originally released for the PC, but later for Apple devices, PS3, and xBox360) gained much success.  Though zombies can be frightening creatures, the game made light of a dark subject and had players planting a garden to protect their brains.  During the night, though, one cannot collect sun to buy plants, so it is necessary to have sunshrooms that give off little sun pieces (sun is used as \"currency\" to purchase plants to fight the zombie horde). \n"}, {"text": "Standing in the forest, you come across a truck.  On it is a note; only seven remain.  But a snap is heard, and your flashlight dims even greater.  You turn around, and a tall figure without a face stares back, and you run.  Panting, you slow down, and you hear the figure get closer.  He catches you; game over (or perhaps, did you win?)\n\nThough very simplistic, this game achieved status as one of the most bone-chilling of all time.  Which one?", "correct": "Slender: The Eight Pages", "options": ["Friday the Neverending 13th", "Nightmare on Elm Street: The Video Game", "Dark Nights"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlender: The Eight Pages.\n\n\tIn 2012, an indie-developed survival horror game was released for the PC, entitled \"Slender\" (later called \"Slender: The Eight Pages\").  Though the graphics weren't lifelike, and the antagonist was rather cartoonish, upon release the game was deemed one of the most frightening to play.  The music soundtrack was scary, and the light static when Slender Man is seen was chilling.  The gameplay is simple; find eight notes in the forest before being caught by Slender Man and before your flashlight loses its battery.\r The Slender Man of the game was based on a real life myth. \n"}, {"text": "While tending to your sugar cane, the sky darkens, and you hear a strange noise from behind.  You immediately know what it is and dash for your house; you must sleep in your bed until this monster is away.  Unfortunately, you don't quite make it, and the creeper blows a giant hole into the side of your house.  The next day, you reluctantly begin the rebuild.\n\nWhich video game is described above?", "correct": "Minecraft", "options": ["Spacecraft", "Warcraft", "Starcraft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinecraft.\n\n\t\"Minecraft\" was released for the PC in 2011 and gained quick success.  The idea was simple; you can explore a pixel world, mining for minerals, digging dirt, chopping wood, and building whatever you want with the materials you collect.  You can also forge weapons and cook food.  Of course, if you have the monster setting on, all things that go bump in the night start to emerge.  If you do not find safety, terrible things can happen.  The quickest way to get rid of monsters is to sleep in a bed; if you can get there before creepers reach your house and blow it up! \n"}, {"text": "As you travel through Dawnguard, it begins getting dark.  A cave in the distance; looks as good as any to keep away from wolves and thieves.  Upon entering the cave, however, you see it is inhabited by three large trolls.  Perhaps not the best place to stay, as you are only level eight.  Exiting the cave, one of the greatest monsters of all flies ahead, a dragon.  You are ill-prepared, but this is \"Elder Scrolls V\", so you head off to fight the wyrm.\n\nWhich game is the subtitle of \"Elder Scrolls V\", which includes the DLC (downloadable content) of Dawnguard?", "correct": "Skyrim", "options": ["Oblivion", "Morrowind", "Daggerfall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkyrim.\n\n\tAll options are different games in the \"Elder Scrolls\" series, but \"Skyrim\", upon its release in late 2011 (for the PC, PS3, and xBox360), gained some of the best success for the series.  The tremendously detailed, enormous world was enjoyable to explore, and the quests were interesting as well.  When the game was released, many a gamer spent hours and hours exploring the immense world of Skyrim, looking for opportunities to harvest dragon souls. \n"}, {"text": "Traveling through the large castle, you have nothing but your whip to attack any vampire that might sneak out and attack you.
