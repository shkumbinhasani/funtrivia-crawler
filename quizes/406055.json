{"id": "406055", "name": "10 Resident Evil 3: Nemesis Questions | Resident Evil Trivia Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis"], "questions": [{"text": "The opening of the game will see the presumed death of what former S.T.A.R.S. member as he and Jill attempt to escape the chaos?", "correct": "Brad Vickers", "options": ["Chris Redfield", "Enrico Marini", "Barry Burton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrad Vickers.\n\n\tWhile Raccoon City descends into chaos, Jill Valentine awakens in her downtown apartment.  The outbreak has already begun, but the hordes of undead are second on the list of worries since Umbrella's Project Nemesis has set out to kill the remaining members of S.T.A.R.S.  She'll scramble to escape her building and Brad Vickers, the only other S.T.A.R.S. member left in Raccoon City, will sacrifice himself to save her as she races onward to the roof of a nearby parking building. It won't be an escape, however-- the unstoppable Nemesis will destroy her escape route and she'll only be saved when Carlos, a member of the UBCS (Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service) takes her to safety in the subway. \n"}, {"text": "While in the Uptown region, Jill will need to activate the circuit breakers at the Power Substation.  How many circuits does she need to flip?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Two", "Three", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tJill needs to get the subway running again, but doing this is more complicated than she would hope since she needs to put out fires (literally and figuratively) while she searches around the buildings in the region fighting off both Zombies and Zombie Dogs.  She'll find a Fire House in the Kite Bros. Railway Building and head onward to the Power Substation to flip circuit breakers (and destroy the spider-like creatures there), but then she'll need to dodge Nemesis en route back to the Railway Building, set a train route, and then head back to the subway proper to reunite with U.B.C.S.  She will...to an extent. Nemesis will catch up and force her to take an alternate route into the sewers; she can meet up with Carlos later. \n"}, {"text": "Jill's trip through the Sewers will culminate in a battle against Nemesis during which he'll wield which of these?", "correct": "Flamethrower", "options": ["Zombie bodies as weapons", "Rocket Launcher", "Dual Pistols"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlamethrower.\n\n\tJill will have a temporary reprieve from Nemesis in the Raccoon City Sewers, but don't assume it's a rest stop.  Instead, she'll have to face off against what Umbrella scientists might have smuggled out of the labs (let's just say they're big and angry and hungry and weak to fire).  Once she opens the proper doors and makes her escape, Nemesis won't waste time in finding her, and it will result in a chase up through a to-be-demolished building (as it's set on fire).  At the top, she'll need to kite around the roof, blow up Nemesis' flamethrower fuel tank, and make her escape as the place starts to burn down. It means tumbling over the side of the structure, but it's safer off the edge rather than on the top. \n"}, {"text": "Jill will escape Nemesis (temporarily) and make her way back through Downtown Raccoon City, arriving at what important location previously seen in \"Resident Evil 2\"?", "correct": "Kendo's Gun Shop", "options": ["Raccoon City Orphanage", "The Spencer Mansion", "Raccoon University"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKendo's Gun Shop.\n\n\tEven though Jill will escape Nemesis-- only for a bit-- she'll still need to make her way back through the Downtown area and reunite with Carlos at the subway.  This will require that she pass by some classic locations in the Raccoon City streets including the RPD Building and Kendo's (to grab some ammo and weapons upgrades).  Nemesis, having survived the earlier encounter, outfits himself with a rocket launcher and pursues Jill further, at least until she reunites with Carlos and they descend into the subway at the last minute. It's a dangerous decision.  After Carlos sends Jill with Mikhail and Nicholai, Nemesis derails the train, killing Mikhail on the way through. The train is detonated while Nicholai escapes; Jill is knocked out-- but she's temporarily safe. \n"}, {"text": "Carlos will head to the Raccoon City Police Department to contact Dr. Bard.  He ultimately will, but from which room?", "correct": "S.T.A.R.S. Office", "options": ["Chief Irons' Office", "Jail", "Secret Office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nS.T.A.R.S. Office\n\n\tCarlos heads to Raccoon City Police Department alongside Tyrell Patrick to get connected with Dr. Bard, a man who may have insight into the cure for all that's going on in the city.  In theory they should be able to find him in the S.T.A.R.S. Office on the top floor of the building, but getting up there is the tough part. Not only does this visit predate Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield's visit to the R.P.D. Building, but there seems to be a much higher presence of Lickers in the halls.  When you finally get through to the right room, the answers come in the form of a video call.  Dr. Bard is trapped in a nearby hospital, and his recommendation is to send in S.T.A.R.S.  That's not the greatest idea. \n"}, {"text": "Emerging from the Subway Tunnels, Jill will contend with Nemesis again but this time she'll have which of these at her disposal?", "correct": "Mine Rounds", "options": ["Tripwires", "Heat Ray", "Gatling Gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMine Rounds.\n\n\tJill leaves the wreckage of the subway train and make her way through the (somehow) zombie-infested maintenance corridors beneath the city streets and out to the river.  In crossing a bridge she'll manage to cross paths with Nemesis (again-- why won't he die?!) and it will result in a much larger fight with an evolved form of the creature in front of the city's clock tower. The hits will be harder and the battle a bit more open than the last one, but if you bring your Grenade Launcher and make use of Mine Rounds you'll have a better chance of bringing Nemesis down on the ground.  Success will mean that Jill gets away, but barely; Nemesis will poison her with a sharp spike and she'll be found, stuck behind a portcullis, by Carlos nearly half a day later. \n"}, {"text": "The hospital visited in \"Resident Evil 3\" is named to memorialize which of these Raccoon City figures?", "correct": "Oswell E. Spencer", "options": ["Police Chief Brian Irons", "Rebeccas Chambers", "Albert Wesker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOswell E. Spencer\n\n\tThe Hospital is one of the least-safe places in the city, it would seem, and when Carlos finds Jill, poisoned and alone near the clock tower, he'll rush her there for recovery.  The visit there will involve a great manner of navigating the barricaded hallways dealing with zombies and, for the first time, hearty foes known as Beta Hunters which can kill Jill/Carlos with minimal effort. The first order of business is to find a vaccine for Jill and, while she recovers, defend her from a horde.  When she's back in fighting shape, Jill will have her shot at exploring the building.  An emergency alert will let any living people know that they need to get out of the city or, else, they'll be eradicated in a missile strike. The clock is ticking. \n"}, {"text": "Who will watch Jill as she collects the Fuses in the hospital's underground warehouse?", "correct": "Nicholai", "options": ["Wesker", "Birkin", "Carlos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNicholai.\n\n\tThe next stop is the Storage Facility/Warehouse beneath the Spencer Memorial Hospital where Carlos has headed to locate Dr. Bard's vaccine stockpile.  Jill will descend below the building to find a massive Umbrella complex there, and hiding away behind protective glass will be Nicholai, waiting for her to try and make a move. The move is a wide one since Jill will blow the elevator fuses in an effort to reach him and she'll need to spend her time collecting replacements in the warehouse.  By the time she gets them, he'll have moved on.  She'll reunite with Tyrell and head deeper beneath the city...but not before Tyrell is killed by Nemesis at the lab entrance. \n"}, {"text": "What colour is the Vaccine Jill creates in the NEST 2 Lab?", "correct": "Purple", "options": ["Red", "Green", "Yellow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPurple.\n\n\tOne of the final to-dos of the game is obtaining a vaccine for the T-Virus which Jill can trade off to stop the missile strike from wiping survivors off the face of Raccoon City, and in the last area of the game, she'll descend into the NEST 2 Lab beneath Spencer Memorial Hospital.  The goal here is to simply find the two Vaccine components in the lab, bring them back to the synthesizer, and make the vaccine. As if that wasn't tough enough, Nemesis will find a way back to Jill and cause a hassle the moment she accomplishes her task, and it will become clear that the only way past this unstoppable force is through it. \n"}, {"text": "The final boss fight against Nemesis involves killing the creature with which of these?", "correct": "Electricity", "options": ["Vaccine", "Acid", "Fire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElectricity.\n\n\tThere will be two components to the final boss battles against Nemesis.  The first occurs when Nemesis breaks through the Lab and pursues Jill to an open arena surrounded by power structures.  She, with Carlos' help, will need to wear down the creature with firepower and electrical shocks before drowning it in a harsh solvent and escaping to chase Nicholai (who's taken the Vaccine).  There'll be a short opportunity to save and reload before the actual final battle in which you need to use a massive electrical weapon to bring down the beast once and for all.  If you bring down Nemesis, you'll also be able to chase Nicholai to the roof.  You'll lose the Vaccine, but Jill and Carlos will be able to get onboard a helicopter leave Raccoon City safe and sound.\r Raccoon City will be wiped off the a map and the threat won't quite be over, but this battle will be done. \n"}]}
