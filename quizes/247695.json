{"id": "247695", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The More I See You' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "Hawkeye and BJ sit in the Swamp, engaged in their usual snappy banter.  Suddenly the arrival of a jeep carrying two new nurses disturbs the tranquility at the 4077th.  Even more disturbed is Hawkeye, who sees an old girlfriend step out said jeep.  It's his old flame, Carlye!  \n\nWhat Emmy-winning actress plays Carlye in this episode?", "correct": "Blythe Danner", "options": ["Candice Bergen", "Shelley Long", "Terri Garr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlythe Danner.\n\n\tBlythe Danner, who won two Emmys for her role as Isabelle 'Izzy' Huffstodt in the TV series 'Huff', and who has appeared in films such as 'Husbands and Wives' and 'Meet the Parents', plays Hawkeye's greatest love in this film, Carlye.  She's really very good in this episode, her only one with 'M*A*S*H', it's a shame that she couldn't stay! \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Carlye met some years back, during Hawkeye's surgical residency.  In which city did Hawkeye serve his residency?", "correct": "Boston", "options": ["Washington", "New York", "Providence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston.\n\n\tWhile Hawkeye reveals these important nuggets of information to BJ, he hides his face so that Carlye cannot see him in the Swamp.  At least at first, he is unwilling to face the woman with whom he was apparently once very smitten! \n"}, {"text": "Along with Carlye is another nurse, freshly arrived at the 4077th.  What is the name of this second nurse, a brunette with a very cheerful demeanor?", "correct": "Becky Anderson", "options": ["Frances Thompson", "Sherry Abel", "Ginger Baker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecky Anderson.\n\n\tBecky Anderson is played by actress Mary Jo Catlett in this episode.  Catlett would appear in one more 'M*A*S*H' episode, namely 'The Nurses', but as Nurse Walsh.  She has appeared in numerous other movies and TV shows, but I best remember her as the Housekeeper Pearl Gallagher on 'Diff'rent Strokes'. \n"}, {"text": "Later that day, Hawkeye and BJ pay a visit to Carlye and her friend, bearing gifts and clever quips.  Which of these items is not among those that the two doctors generously bestow upon the two charmed nurses?", "correct": "Flyswatter", "options": ["Toilet paper", "Canned ham", "Shampoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlyswatter.\n\n\tAmong the gifts are cigars, canned hams, soap, shampoo ('Because we couldn't find real poo', BJ jokes) and toilet paper, which doubles as the official 4077th stationery.  When Hawkeye and BJ leave, an enthralled Becky says, 'I love him.'  When Carlye asks 'Which one?', Becky replies, 'I don't care.' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye finally has a chance to chat with Carlye alone later that day.  One of my favorite jokes comes after Carlye mentions to Hawkeye in an icebreaking line: 'You were right about the food here.'  What is Hawkeye's amusing response?", "correct": "Yeah, I'll never understand how the cook got off at Nuremburg.", "options": ["Fortunately, the mess hall is right next to the latrine, for easy access.", "Don't worry, it grows on you.  Unfortunately, it grows like moss.", "If we used this camp's food as a weapon, the war would be over in a week."], "explanation": "\n\n\nYeah, I'll never understand how the cook got off at Nuremburg.\n\n\tAt the outset of their conversation, Hawkeye is all jokes and jests, with very little seriousness.  He is obviously having a difficult time with Carlye's appearance at the camp.  He only slows down when Carlye suggests that he is trying too hard. \n"}, {"text": "Carlye reveals during their conversation that she has gotten married, much to Hawkeye's chagrin.  Her maiden name was Breslin, but what is her married name?", "correct": "Walton", "options": ["Simmons", "Yancey", "Zabriskie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalton.\n\n\tCarlye has married a man named Doug Walton, a lieutenant in the U.S. military.  In his civilian life, Doug is in advertising.  So far, they have no children. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Carlye were with each other for about a year and a half.  Did Hawkeye ever ask Carlye to marry him during that time?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThis was a sore spot for Carlye.  She wanted marriage and commitment, but the only thing Hawkeye could seem to commit to was his work.  She did not want to play second fiddle to scalpels and sponges. \n"}, {"text": "In an amusing side story, Colonel Potter is doing paintings of various personnel at the 4077th.  While painting Radar, the lad does some very amusing impressions.  What animal does Radar imitate very well?", "correct": "Turtle", "options": ["Gorilla", "Lion", "Eel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurtle.\n\n\tGary Burghoff did numerous, excellent impressions during his time on 'M*A*S*H'.  Here, he does a remarkable turtle impression that really makes you giggle.  It must be seen to be believed.  Afterwards, he does his impression of Al Jolson, but only speaking, not singing (to Potter's disappointment). \n"}, {"text": "It turns out that Carlye and Hawkeye cannot co-exist at the 4077th, and she puts in for a transfer.  Hawkeye attempts to convince her to stay, but to no avail, she is set to leave.  Incidentally, was Carlye the one who left Hawkeye the previous time they were together?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tHence, this marks the second time that Carlye will leave poor Hawkeye.  Now married, she is unwilling to start afresh with Hawkeye.  She is especially convinced when Hawkeye is unable to even ask her to marry him.  Instead, he 'proposes himself into a corner', as she puts it. \n"}, {"text": "Towards the end of the episode, Colonel Potter is seen painting Klinger.  What type of athlete is Klinger posing as in this, another of Potter's quaint little paintings?", "correct": "Discus thrower", "options": ["Basketball player", "Tennis player", "Long distance runner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiscus thrower.\n\n\tKlinger poses as a discus thrower, a la the ancient Greek sculpture by Myron.  This painting can subsequently be seen hanging on the wall in Colonel Potter's office in numerous episodes.  While Klinger poses, Father Mulcahy enters the office.  He complains to Colonel Potter about the new Bibles that say 'Thou shalt commit adultery'.  Colonel Potter chuckles, commenting, 'Well, that's the new army, Father.'\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
