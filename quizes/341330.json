{"id": "341330", "name": "\"Born This Way\" Multiple Choice Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "Who hits Rachel in the face during dress rehearsal?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Quinn", "Puck", "Santana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tWill congratulates New Directions on their win at Regionals but informs them that they'll need to step up their dance skills before heading to Nationals in a few weeks.  When the kids start their 'booty camp', Finn accidentally hits Rachel in the face, breaking her nose.  While at the doctor's office, the doctor tries to convince her to take on a nose job to fix a deviated septum while she's in.  When he states that it may actually improve her high noses, she considers the proposal.\rThe Glee Club is surprised by her interest in having a nose like Quinn's.  Santana takes the opportunity to note that she's sure everyone in New Directions has something about themselves they want to change and recommends that they get their problems fixed to make their lives better.  Will criticizes this approach though as their most hated qualities are often their most interesting.  The kids aren't convinced; they know that being different at McKinley means that they'll get bullied for it. \n"}, {"text": "Whose idea is it to pair up with Karofsky to become Prom Queen?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Brittany", "Lauren", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\tWill decides that he wants to help the kids feel more comfortable with themselves while he helps Emma clean her grapes.  When he brings up her insecurities about her OCD, she asks him not to call it that (instead calling herself 'Neat Freak').  He suggests that they finally come to grips with her condition and she resists it.  This gives him a great idea though-- teach the kids with the help of Lady Gaga.\rSantana contemplates getting Brittany back by winning the role of Prom Queen at this year's junior prom.  She thinks about campaigning alongside Sam but because of his lack of popularity at McKinley she decides to skip over him as an option.  Instead, she spies Karofsky down the hall and believes that he's a good option...at least until she witnesses him checking out Sam.  She's distracted while at the coffee shop with Tina, Mercedes, Kurt, and Blaine until she realize that the key to fixing all of the problems is by using Karofsky to win Prom Queen.  This, in turn, will allow Kurt to return to McKinley, bringing more power to New Directions for Nationals and making her the hero. \n"}, {"text": "Lauren once won a pageant.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWill states that this week's theme is 'Acceptance', specifically for who they are as individuals.  Everyone in the club needs to sing a song about their best and worst qualities to come to accept themselves.  In addition, they'll be performing a group number to Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\".  Emma is also present for this revelation; she's in the room to help them with new t-shirts.  Each of these new shirts will have a phrase or word featuring the thing that the kids dislike most about themselves so that they can wear them with pride.  Emma then reveals that hers says 'GINGER', which sort of goes against Will's initial idea to have her come to terms with her OCD.\rLauren is the next girl to admire the Prom Queen crown.  While Puck says that it's not that great, Lauren claims that she won Miss Tiara Toddler when she was a child (her talent was baby pull-ups).  She was on her way to becoming Miss Ohio before she gained her weight.  While she watches Quinn put up campaign posters, Puck tells her that the two of them will change the norm and be king and queen together.\rAt the doctor's office, Rachel has Quinn come along for her appointment so that they can use her nose as an example.  By taking shots of Quinn's nose, they can see what it would look like on a composite.  While this occurs, Quinn and Rachel duet to a mash-up of TLC's \"Unpretty\" and \"West Side Story's\" \"I Feel Pretty\", using the number as their performance for the assignment of the week. \n"}, {"text": "In this episode, Finn dances alongside which New Directions member to the song \"I've Gotta Be Me\"?", "correct": "Mike", "options": ["Sam", "Quinn", "Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike.\n\n\tQuinn finds Lauren in the halls at school putting up her own campaign posters and attracting the attention of the less-slim girls.  The two of them argue over their campaigns and Quinn vows that it's become personal before storming off.\rSantana takes Karofsky to the coffee shop and reveals that she knows his secret.  Her plan is to hide their sexualities together and become a couple so that they can rule the school as the most powerful couple and win Prom King and Queen.  Then, Karofsky can move on and become what she calls a 'late-in-life gay'.  If he doesn't join forces with her, she vows to simply let the secret slip out.\rFinn is angry with Quinn for encouraging Rachel to get a nose job since the point behind 'acceptance' is to come to terms with self-image issues.  In class, Finn proves the usefulness of the lesson by dancing with Mike Chang (despite his horrible dancing skills) to Sammy Davis Jr.'s \"I've Gotta Be Me\". \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the new bully protection club at McKinley High?", "correct": "The Bully-Whips", "options": ["The Hall Monitors", "The Guardian Angels", "The New Deflections"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bully-Whips.\n\n\tAfter Finn's number, Rachel brings up the nose job idea and Tina is the one to speak up saying it's not a great idea; in fact, Rachel's not accepting herself has led Tina to realize that she's a great person despite her disliking her Asian eyes...in fact she's better because of them.  Rachel still feels as though the opportunity is about taking hold of her destiny.  Finn tells her not to do it-- she's beautiful.\rWill wants to talk to Emma about the assignment and his disappointment with her shirt option.  They're trying to teach the kids a lesson and she didn't follow through.  He confronts her with unwashed fruit and she continues to deflect, so he lays it out for her; he thinks that she performs her guidance job so well because she's afraid of getting to her own issues.\rFiggins brings Karofsky to the choir room and an apology is made despite the kids' protests.  When he reveals that Santana showed him the errors of his ways, everyone is surprised, especially when she admits that she did it for the team and for Kurt and that she fell in love in the process.  The two of them have also banded together to form the Bully-Whips, a group dedicated to eradicating bullying at McKinley.  Karofsky also makes it clear that he wishes to talk to Kurt to fix any issues. \n"}, {"text": "Kurt suggests that he and Karofsky open a school chapter of which social organization at McKinley?", "correct": "PFLAG", "options": ["GLADD", "ILGA", "GLF"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPFLAG.\n\n\tFiggins mediates a conversation between the Hummels and the Karofskys to ensure that an agreement and an apology are made.  Burt is extremely hesitant to let his son return to McKinley with a bully like Karofsky around, but since the Bully-Whips came into being, things have been safer.  Kurt asks to speak to Karofsky alone and it is allowed.  Kurt knows something's wrong and he states that Dave owes him the truth.  He admits that it's Santana's plan and Kurt is slightly surprised.  Kurt suggests a few options but decides that the best one is to return to McKinley, support the anti-bullying campaign, and join Dave in opening a chapter of PFLAG at the school, much to Karofsky's frustration.\rPuck enters the girls' washroom to speak to Rachel alone and suggests that she not get her nose job because it's been passed down through the Jewish people for generations.  He asks her for an hour of her time the following day to convince her to change her mind and she accepts. \n"}, {"text": "As a farewell to Kurt, the Dalton Academy Warblers sing a song in their choir room.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe New Directions gather at the school's outside steps in anticipation of good news and they're amazed to see Kurt return to McKinley High after his lengthy tenure at Dalton Academy.  The point of their meeting at the steps is to receive goodbyes from Blaine and the Warblers.  Of course, their goodbye comes in the form of song: \"Somewhere Only We Know\" by Keane.  The number is punctuated by Blaine's playing on the piano and Kurt's tears as he's welcomed back to his school.\rReturning to the auditorium for the first time since he left, Kurt indulges in his own number from \"Sunset Boulevard\" to mark his return and pleasure at rejoining his friends and family in New Directions. \n"}, {"text": "What is Quinn's actual first name?", "correct": "Lucy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLucy.\n\n\tLauren, passing Quinn in the school halls, slips the name Lucy into a remark and gets her attention.  Sitting her down in an empty classroom, Lauren reveals that she did some investigating to size up her competition and found that not only did Quinn attend another school district before attending McKinley, but she went under her actual first name, Lucy (switching to her middle name later on), was overweight, and got a nose job.  Quinn reveals that it's all true.  In middle school she was nicknamed Lucy Caboosey, she felt terrible about herself, and she had no friends.  When she lost some of her weight she kept going, got a nose job, and changed the way she looked to find self-confidence.  Quinn asks what Lauren plans to do but it's too late-- Lauren already posted 'Vote for Lucy Caboosey' posters around the school.\rAt the mall, Puck reveals that his plan was to bring Rachel to Kurt for a 'Barbravention' and to state that Streisand became a big female star by redefining beauty, and if Rachel gets her nose job, she'll be disappointing the Barbra legacy.  Kurt has Puck play a song and a flash mob commences to the tune of Duck Sauce's \"Barbra Streisand\". \n"}, {"text": "What happens as a result of Lauren's plan to ruin Quinn with her horrible secret?", "correct": "Quinn becomes a more popular candidate for Prom Queen", "options": ["Quinn finds humiliating facts about Lauren and reveals them to the school", "Lauren gets suspended from the race for Prom Queen", "Lauren becomes a more popular candidate for Prom Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn becomes a more popular candidate for Prom Queen.\n\n\tEmma attends a session with her new therapist and as soon as she sits down she's told the hour is over-- she spent all but two minutes disinfecting her seat.  What can be said for sure is that Emma has an extreme case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  It's treatable with behavioral techniques and medication and there's no reason why she can't overcome it.  Emma's illness is masking who she's supposed to be and she feels ashamed for it.  The therapist writes her a prescription for an SSRI and suggests she return in a week.\rFinn speaks to Quinn about the campaign and he reveals that he loves her despite what she thinks about her old self.  He keeps an old picture of her in his wallet because he thinks it's the only one where he can see her for the beautiful person she truly is.  Walking down the halls at school, Quinn is praised by overweight girls for overcoming her weight problem and finding her beauty.  Lauren apologizes for the approach she took and says that Quinn is ahead in the polls by 40%.  Quinn says that she has a lot of respect for Lauren as well because she's proud of who she is and doesn't need a nose job to show it. \n"}, {"text": "Who does not participate in the episode's closing number?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Kurt", "Quinn", "Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\tBrittany decides to show Santana her shirt for the \"Born This Way\" number and is reads \"I'M WITH STOOPID\" with an arrow pointing upwards.  Santana also reveals that hers says \"BITCH\" because of her attitude.  Brittany is disappointed with this because it doesn't reveal the true secret that she doesn't accept about herself.  Brittany shows her the shirt she made for her and it says \"LEBANESE\".  She says that all the things she said about loving her the week earlier made her feel so proud, but Santana says that she won't do it because she's with Karofsky and because Brittany never responded that she loved her back.  Brittany says that she does love her, and clearly more than Santana loves herself.\rEmma sits in her office with the bottle of medication and contemplates her issues.  She takes the pill.\rIn the auditorium, Will says that he's proud of the class for being so accepting of themselves and reveals his own shirt which reads \"BUTT CHIN\".  Rachel also arrives to reveal that her shirt says \"NOSE\"-- she's decided not to go through with the surgery.  Only Santana is missing as the group performs \"Born This Way\", each revealing their own shirts.  As the kids finish their performance, Emma arrives to join in and show her own shirt: \"OCD\".  Santana and Karofsky sit in the audience watching the number; she wears \"LEBANESE\". \n"}]}
