The dwarfs couldn't bear to put Snow White into the ground so they put her in a glass coffin and kept her in their house. The prince heard about the princess and made his way to the house. He kissed Snow White and she woke. The prince took Snow White back to his castle where they lived happily ever after (I assume). \n"}]}
