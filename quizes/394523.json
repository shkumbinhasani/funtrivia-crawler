{"id": "394523", "name": "\"The Morning After\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Apocalypse"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these does Emily find in her room?", "correct": "Snakes", "options": ["Rats", "Insects", "Birds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnakes.\n\n\tAs Emily prepares for bed, all of the candles in her room blow out.  She relights one of them to find that the door to her wardrobe has opened on its own, and when she checks inside she's shocked to find several snakes.  She screams and Timothy runs to her aid, closely followed by Ms. Mead who, delighted with the mysterious serpents, states that they'll likely be a good meal if they aren't loaded with radiation.  The next night, sure enough, snake soup is served despite concern from some of the outpost denizens.\rDuring the meal, Emily asks about the mysterious person who arrived at the outpost the day before.  Ms. Venable doesn't divulge the info, saying they will all find out in due course.  As the diners pull the lids off their individual meals, they find that the snakes inside are still alive. \n"}, {"text": "According to Michael, what is the alternative outpost, designed to protect the inhabitants should all others fall?", "correct": "The Sanctuary", "options": ["The Watchtower", "The Bunker", "The Lighthouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sanctuary.\n\n\tMichael Langdon finally introduces himself to the main inhabitants of Outpost Three, meeting in the library and having Ms. Venable step aside.  He informs all that humanity is on the brink of failure and his arrival is crucial.  Three other compounds in the United States have been overrun and destroyed and contact has been lost with the six international compounds operated by The Cooperative. The people inside have been massacred.  There is, however, a failsafe known as The Sanctuary, and there, some of them will continue living, safe from all who may attack, so that humanity may survive.  However, he has been sent to determine if any of them are worthy, and to do that he will spend several days conducting a line of questioning for each of them, referred to as 'cooperating', and that will help him decide. If they stay, he will give them a vial which, if ingested, will put them into a permanent sleep after one minute.  Problem solved. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Gallant admits to disliking his grandmother.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMr. Gallant volunteers for cooperation first and foremost and Michael Langdon makes it clear that there is no gaming of the system.  The interview starts with a question about Gallant's sexual orientation but soon progresses to questions about anger and Evie.  It is very apparent that Gallant hates his grandmother for the shame and criticism he's received in the past. Langdon admits that he has a file that contains all of their secrets and he urges Gallant to admit the things he's done to him.  Gallant admits that in the past, Evie hosted gay luncheons and he rebelled against her during those.  The talk seems to lead to sexual tension, but Langdon ends their cooperation soon after, insisting that they continue at another time. \n"}, {"text": "Who conspires to leave Outpost Three early?", "correct": "Emily", "options": ["Coco", "Evie", "Mallory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmily.\n\n\tTimothy and Emily contemplate their options.  Emily wants to steal two rad-suits and some food and take their chances on the road.  If Langdon made it on his own, they can do it together.  Emily suggests they check his room for clues as to where the Sanctuary is.\rThat night, Gallant is interrupted by a knock on his door and it turns out to be a man in a latex gimp suit.  He lets him in.  Soon after, Evie walks in on her grandson and the man in the latex suit but they don't notice her spying.  She straightens herself up and continues on her way with that knowledge in mind. \n"}, {"text": "Timothy and Emily discover that Michael Langdon has access to which of these?", "correct": "Email", "options": ["A car", "Cell service", "Drugs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmail.\n\n\tEvie meets with Ms. Mead in her room immediately after finding Gallant with the rubberman, suggesting that while it would be unfortunate if her grandson were not selected to go to The Sanctuary, it could open up a vacancy.  Ms. Mead is obviously interested in this news.\rTimothy and Emily wait for Langdon to leave his room, and when he does they enter to find a working laptop on the bed.  There they find a series of emails, all regarding Cooperative activities and the overrunning of the other Outposts.  One of these emails states that Ms. Venable has acted out of turn, punishing sexual activity with death, and there is a plan in place to kill them before departure.  Timothy and Emily don't notice the rubberman watching them from the ceiling. \n"}, {"text": "It becomes apparent the Ms. Venable has an injury on what part of her body?", "correct": "Back", "options": ["Leg", "Stomach", "Arm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBack.\n\n\tLangdon confronts Ms. Venable in her office, insisting that his drafting of the Outpost regulations did not include abstinence.  He tells her a story of an encounter he had with people outside in the fallout.  He was begged to kill her and her children, but he refused, instead carrying on.  The story is followed immediately by discussion about who should go to The Sanctuary, but it's clear that Ms. Venable dislikes all of the inhabitants of Outpost Three. Michael tells Venable to take off her dress for a physical examination.  She refuses, but he insists that he wants to see her shame, and she won't get a second chance. She lets him undo her dress, exposing the deeply painful injury underneath, but he tells her that she has not passed the cooperative examination. \n"}, {"text": "Michael Langdon claims that he was not in the rubberman suit.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMs. Mead searches after Ms. Venable and does up her dress as they depart.  Ms. Mead states that while Evie doesn't know the identity of the second person in the room, they were dressed head-to-toe in the rubber suit.  Venable quickly jumps to Langdon as the only possible suspect but nonetheless, they tie up Gallant and whip him to extract information.  Later on, Michael Langdon finds Gallant hanging there, but Langdon doesn't seem to know anything about a rubber suit; he wasn't there.  He also reveals that Evie reported him for what happened before he frees him from his bonds. \n"}, {"text": "In the music room, what song plays, prompting Dinah to be nostalgic about an old TV show?", "correct": "\"Time in a Bottle\"", "options": ["\"The Morning After\"", "\"You've Got a Friend\"", "\"Make Your Own Kind of Music\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Time in a Bottle\".\n\n\tIn the music room, Dinah Stevens waxes on the music emanating from the player.  She looks back nostalgically, but Coco interrupts her to complain about Jim Croce's \"Time in a Bottle\", insulting Evie and Dinah both for being too old.  Gallant rejoins the others after his being freed and he pours himself a drink of water while his grandmother watches on in surprise.  She tells him that there should be no hard feelings; she needs to wait until the Ten Little Indians die off so that she can claim a spot in The Sanctuary for herself and his lifetimes-worth of mistakes should make him ineligible. \n"}, {"text": "How many times has Mr. Gallant been in rehab?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Two", "One", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tEvie continues, saying that Gallant's mistakes always had to be cleaned up on her dime-- several stints in rehab, several salon closures, and other similar failures.  Although humanity is in a sorry state, her life of culture and arts is worth fifty of her grandson's lifetimes, and if she's brought into The Sanctuary, she can be the bridge between the old world and the new.  The world, she says, deserves better than her grandson.  Love for him, unfortunately, is just not in her nature.\rTimothy and Emily, realizing that the rules in Outpost Three are arbitrary, wonder about all the lies they don't know about.  The two of them, deciding to fight back, commit to their relationship, all the while unaware that they're still being watched by the rubberman.  Later, they're discovered by Ms. Mead and taken away. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Gallant kills who of these Outpost dwellers in his bed?", "correct": "Evie", "options": ["Coco", "Stu", "Andre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvie.\n\n\tMr. Gallant, alone in the music room later on, is shocked when the radio changes from \"Time in a Bottle\" to Fleetwood Mac's \"Gold Dust Woman\".  Looking in the doorway he sees the rubberman leaving and follows him through Outpost Three to his room.  Gallant allows the rubberman to take him to bed, but he grabs a pair of scissors from his nightstand and plunges them down into the covered man as the door opens, revealing Michael Langdon watching him.  When Gallant looks down, he realizes that he'd been hallucinating; he killed Evie instead.\rTimothy and Emily are met by Ms. Venable and they inform her that they know she's making up the rules.  They also note that Langdon has a working laptop in his room.  Venable has them led away for punishment at the hands of Ms. Mead and they're quickly brought to the decontamination chamber to be executed, but in the ensuing fight, Timothy knocks out one of the guards and shoots Ms. Mead.  Mead's other lackey manages to subdue the two of them though, and her boss turns the corner to check on her wound alone.  She doesn't let anyone know that she's not altogether human. \n"}]}
