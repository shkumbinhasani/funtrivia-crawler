{"id": "400662", "name": "\"Homer the Heretic\" Quiz | 'Simpsons' - Season 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Simpsons", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "Homer stays home from church for the first time.  What is the final straw that convinces him to stay in?", "correct": "He rips his pants", "options": ["The car won't start", "There's a marathon on TV", "He's too sick to go"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe rips his pants.\n\n\tWaking from a pleasant dream of being in the womb, Homer finds that he's late for church.  Marge tells him he needs to go and that she's tired of having the same argument every Sunday, but it's clearly too cold outside to leave.  Homer, unpleased, tries to do up his pants only to rip them.  It's because of this that he stays in, warm and toasty, while Marge angrily drives herself and the kids. \n"}, {"text": "What's not an ingredient in Homer's patented space age moon waffle?", "correct": "Garlic powder", "options": ["Caramel", "Batter", "Liquid smoke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarlic powder.\n\n\tThough Homer enjoys a leisurely morning at home, rising from his toasty bed at his own pace, the rest of the family (and the others at the church) suffer with -11 degree weather and a lack of furnace.  While Homer makes breakfast and sits in front of the TV with a mug of coffee, the churchgoers find themselves iced into the building. \n"}, {"text": "The first day Homer skips church is the day he declares the best of his life, in his mind beating which of the following?", "correct": "His wedding day", "options": ["The day won a beer", "The day Lisa was born", "The day he went to the carnival"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis wedding day.\n\n\tHomer manages to win a radio contest and watch TV for hours before the family comes home; the rest of the Simpsons are by far the last to leave church when their vehicle won't start.  Eventually they get back, but not before Homer, finding a lucky penny, declares this Sunday the best day of his life, even beating his wedding day.  He owes it all to skipping church and he vows to stop going altogether. \n"}, {"text": "Homer dreams that he speaks to God.  Does God allow him to skip out on going to church?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tMarge, frustrated with Homer's attempt at making a moon waffle, asks him why he would give up his faith so swiftly, but Homer explains that he doesn't think God would mind if one man worshipped from his own home instead of headed to church every Sunday.  Besides, he says, what if they picked the wrong religion?  That night, Marge prays for Homer while he beckons her to bed.  He falls asleep before she finishes and he dreams of God coming to see him, allowing him to follow through on staying home. \n"}, {"text": "In an attempt to convince Homer back to the church, Marge invites who over for dinner?", "correct": "Reverend Lovejoy", "options": ["Ned Flanders", "Grandpa", "Lenny"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReverend Lovejoy.\n\n\tWith the alleged advice of God, Homer takes to his new way of life, spending the cold winter days wandering around in his bathrobe.  Lisa asks why he's taking on a life of blasphemy; he suggests that she shouldn't worry since he can just recant his sins on his deathbed.\rAll of this is why Marge invites Reverend Lovejoy over for dinner.  When Homer talks about his dream, the Reverend tries  to remind Homer of particular verses in the Bible.  None of it really helps. \n"}, {"text": "Moe allegedly follows which religious belief?", "correct": "Snake handling", "options": ["Voodoo", "Mormonism", "Jediism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnake handling.\n\n\tHomer continues his streak of living and worshipping the way he wants, even calling into work and claiming he has fake religious holidays to attend (like the Feast of Maximum Occupancy, taken from a sign in Moe's Tavern).  When he tries to convince Moe to join his religion, Moe admits to being born a snake handler; he'll die a snake handler. \n"}, {"text": "Homer, in an attempt to escape the Flanders and their singing, drives himself where?", "correct": "Onto a garbage barge", "options": ["Off a cliff", "Solitary confinement", "Shelbyville"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnto a garbage barge.\n\n\tIt isn't long before word of Homer's divergence from 'the flock' spreads around the community.  Ned is particularly interested in bringing homer back to his senses, bringing his family over to sing religious tunes at his doorstep (and chasing him down in his vehicle with their guitar).  Homer's barely able to escape their singing, driving his car onto a garbage barge to get away. \n"}, {"text": "Marge lets Homer know that if he continues not to attend church, she'll have to teach the children that their father is which of these?", "correct": "Wicked", "options": ["Evil", "A problem", "An idiot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWicked.\n\n\tThe next Sunday morning, Marge has to gather the kids and get them ready for church and, in doing so, she asks Homer one last time to join them or else, as she says, she'll have to keep reminding them that their father is wicked.  Homer quickly opts out; there's a program on TV teaching viewers how to make their own ladders.  He's sure of his choice.  He stays in, mostly naked on the couch, reading smutty magazines instead. \n"}, {"text": "Homer manages to set the house on fire with which of these?", "correct": "Cigar ashes", "options": ["The oven", "A magnifying lens", "The barbecue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCigar ashes.\n\n\tWhile home, Homer receives yet another caller to his door, this time tangential to his aversion to church, because it's Krusty the Clown, going door-to-door looking for donations to the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns.  Since it's a religious ask, Homer says no outright.  Instead, he goes to the Kwik-E-Mart where Apu, worshipping Ganesha during work hours, asks him to make his purchases and leave.\rIt's why, when Homer gets home, he lights a cigar and falls asleep on the couch, inadvertently setting the house ablaze. \n"}, {"text": "Who is not a part of the Springfield Volunteer Fire Department?", "correct": "Ned", "options": ["Krusty", "Apu", "Barney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNed.\n\n\tHomer wakes up too late, rising from the couch to find the house already well ablaze.  As he falls to overwhelming smoke inhalation, Apu sees the blaze from the Kwik-E-Mart and calls in the others from the Springfield Volunteer Fire Department.  Ned Flanders, seeing the destruction from next door, breaks through the door to save his neighbour, getting him out through an upstairs window just as the fire truck arrives.\r Homer comes to realize, as his family returns home and the blaze is extinguished, that his neighbours, regardless of their faith, came to his aid in his time of need.  Reverend Lovejoy asks if he'll come back to church and Homer says he will...even though he sleeps through the whole sermon.\rIt's okay though, in another dream, God tells Homer that nine out of ten religions don't make it through their first year. \n"}]}
