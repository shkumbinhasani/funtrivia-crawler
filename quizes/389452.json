{"id": "389452", "name": "\"It\": Chapter One Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "   Movies H-K", "I"], "questions": [{"text": "Georgie is attacked and killed when he chases which of these into a storm drain?", "correct": "A paper boat", "options": ["An action figure", "A balloon", "A cat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA paper boat.\n\n\tWhile the events taking place in Derry, Maine in 1989 commence before Georgie's attack, they certainly come to a head when Georgie Denborough chases his paper boat down a rainy street, losing it down a storm drain.  The clown in the storm drain, which only he sees, is charming enough to convince him to reach in and grab the boat his brother made, but that's when it attacks, latching onto his arm and biting it off before pulling him in for the rest of the meal.  The authorities never find his body or the bodies of the other missing children in Derry that summer. \n"}, {"text": "Bill Denborough suffers from which of these afflictions?", "correct": "Stutter", "options": ["ADHD", "Blindness", "Deafness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStutter.\n\n\tBill Denborough has a stutter from the very beginning of the story though it worsens after the disappearance of his brother, Georgie.  While his parents urge him to move past his brother's death, he holds himself responsible for not being there when he went missing, and much of his fears materialize in the form of his brother whenever It is around.  Somewhat of a natural leader in the Loser's Club, his confidence grows the more he finds it necessary to confront the evil lurking in Derry. \n"}, {"text": "What is Richie Tozier's greatest fear?", "correct": "Clowns", "options": ["Dying", "Bats", "Darkness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClowns.\n\n\tWhile Richie is the last of the Loser's Club to encounter It in the flesh, he makes it clear to the others that he suffers from a fear of clowns - coulrophobia.  This is particularly frustrating since It's typical form is that of a dancing clown.  Richie's major face-off with It occurs in the house on Neibolt Street when he finds a room of clown dolls and It itself.  He also tends to be a bit of a loud-mouth throughout the film. \n"}, {"text": "Bev lives with which family member?", "correct": "Father", "options": ["Aunt", "Mother", "Grandmother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather.\n\n\tBeverly Marsh joins the Loser's Club after most of the boys have already united against their bully, Henry Bowers.  It becomes clear as the film goes on that her home life with her father is less than normal as the abuse she faces on a regular basis doesn't let up.  Beverly seems to have the most issues with It in her own apartment and she's forced to kill her father to avoid harm. When this happens, however, she's captured by the very thing all of the kids swore to fight against, and their plan has to go into action at a moment's notice.  In the end, she moves in with her aunt in Portland, being the first to leave Derry. \n"}, {"text": "Ben Hascomb spends his summer in which of these locations?", "correct": "Library", "options": ["Camp", "His job", "Summer school"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLibrary.\n\n\tBen Hascomb, the new kid in Derry, has a thing for Bev but she doesn't really see it until late in the film.  His encounters with It begin in the library when, during a session researching the fire that killed many in the town, he was lured into the stacks in the basement with easter eggs.  Ben's research is one of the key components in finding It's lair, and it's his kiss that pulls Bev back from the place It placed her.  As Bev finds out, Ben also seems to have a soft spot for New Kids on the Block. \n"}, {"text": "Stan Uris follows which faith?", "correct": "Judaism", "options": ["Buddhism", "Christianity", "Islam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJudaism.\n\n\tStan first encounters It at his father's synagogue.  Heading into the office he faces his fear when an abstract painting of a woman falls to the floor and manifests before him.  He has to face his fear head-on when the Loser's Club advances towards It's lair, and the encounter leaves him severely shaken, likely to influence him in the future.  Stan seems to be one of the least brave of the group, often thinking, rationally, that they should steer clear of It entirely.  This is, perhaps, because he nears the day of his bar mitzvah, and it closer to becoming an adult. \n"}, {"text": "Eddie breaks which of these body parts?", "correct": "Arm", "options": ["Leg", "Back", "Tailbone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArm.\n\n\tEddie Kaspbrak doesn't seem to want to be a mamma's boy, but his overbearing mother seems to have a stranglehold on his life, ensuring that he's always aware of the dangers of life and that he takes his medication even though it's all mostly placebos.  His encounters with It take place outside the old house on Neibolt Street, and when he eventually goes inside with the rest of the Loser's Club, It breaks his arm, leading him to remain in a cast for the rest of the film.  He ultimately defies his mother to spend time with his friends and battle evil. \n"}, {"text": "Mike Hanlon's parents were killed by which means?", "correct": "Fire", "options": ["Tornado", "Flood", "Supernatural entity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFire.\n\n\tMike is the last to join the Loser's Club, but one of the earliest to encounter It in Derry.  One of the few black kids in town, he's an obvious target for Henry Bowers' gang of bullies, and the others come to his rescue by throwing themselves into a rock fight in the Barrens to protect him.  He reveals that his parents died in a horrible fire (which he survived) and It tries to use that to its advantage.  Mike is also responsible for killing Henry Bowers by knocking him into the well on the Neibolt property. \n"}, {"text": "The Loser's Club most commonly encounter It when it takes on a particular form.  What is the name of 'The Dancing Clown'?", "correct": "Pennywise", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPennywise.\n\n\tIt is commonly in the form of Pennywise, a clown that evokes a certain amount of dread, especially since children can tell that something just isn't right about him.  Pennywise appears to all of the children in the film at some point, and it's in this form that he faces off against the kids one last time (as children, at least).  The truth is, Pennywise is almost a form of evil incarnate, and he can shapeshift to suit whatever need (though usually that need is to amass food... and that food is children). \n"}, {"text": "The kids corner It, but where do they find It's lair?", "correct": "In the sewers", "options": ["In the school", "In the Barrens", "In a cave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the sewers.\n\n\tWhat the Loser's Club finds is that It's attacks happen along the routes taken by Derry's sewer system and that there's an old wellhouse beneath the abandoned house on Neibolt Street.  While the sewer also connects to the Barrens and other spots around derry, it's through the old well that they start making their way to It's lair within (to save Bev when she's taken).  Ultimately, they're able to band together and, unafraid, take It on, sending him deeper down for another 27-year slumber. They vow that should the murders happen again, they shall return to finish him once and for all.  And then they go their separate ways. \n"}]}
