{"id": "329694", "name": "See You Later, Alligator! Quiz | Reptiles and Amphibians | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Reptiles and Amphibians", "Crocodiles"], "questions": [{"text": "Which one of the following do alligators NOT have?", "correct": "Vocal cords", "options": ["Stomach", "Teeth", "Lungs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVocal cords.\n\n\tAlligators have all of these things except for vocal cords. In spite of this they are known to make sounds, usually by using the water around them. Overall, they like the silent approach! \n"}, {"text": "In which of the following U.S. states would you be most likely to see an alligator?", "correct": "Florida", "options": ["California", "Ohio", "Montana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlorida.\n\n\tThe American alligator lives in the southeastern states of the U.S. with the heaviest population living in Florida. They can be found in every state that borders the Gulf of Mexico and have been found as far north as North Carolina. \n"}, {"text": "There are two species of alligator. One is the American alligator. What is the name of the other species?", "correct": "Chinese Alligator", "options": ["Canadian Alligator", "Australian Alligator", "French Alligator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChinese Alligator.\n\n\tThe Chinese alligator is not quite as large as its cousin the American alligator. American alligators have been known to grow to 14 ft. (4.4m), while the Chinese alligator only grows to about 5 ft.(1.5m). Found in the far eastern areas of the Yangtze River, these beautiful animals are critically endangered, with estimates of fewer than 200 individuals left in the wild. \n"}, {"text": "Why does the average American alligator carry 10-15 pounds of rocks in its stomach?", "correct": "To help with digestion", "options": ["They eat them to sharpen their teeth", "For buoyancy", "They absorb minerals from the rocks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo help with digestion.\n\n\tThe proper term for these rocks is gastroliths and they help with digestion. They are used by animals that lack grinding teeth (molars) to break down the food that has been eaten. Many dinosaurs used them, as do modern alligators, crocodiles, seals and some types of birds. \n"}, {"text": "Usually, what color are an American alligator's eyes?", "correct": "Green", "options": ["Red", "Blue", "Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen.\n\n\tMost of the time an alligator's eyes are an olive green in color. There are slight variations between the amount of green and brown found in each individual's eyes. When lights or camera flash are reflected off their eyes they appear bright red! \n"}, {"text": "Where does an alligator lay its eggs?", "correct": "A mounded nest of fresh vegetation", "options": ["In the water", "In the sand", "The don't lay eggs, they give birth to live young"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA mounded nest of fresh vegetation.\n\n\tA female alligator will lay her eggs in a large mounded nest of vegetation that has been freshly dug up. They take great care to build the nest in an area that is not prone to flooding. If a nest gets flooded, the eggs will die within 12 hours of being submerged. The average gator nest rises 3.5 ft. (just over 1 meter) and is twice as wide. It usually holds about 40 eggs. \n"}, {"text": "In 2006 \"National Geographic\" magazine showed a photograph of an alligator that had been eaten by which other reptile, possibly causing the latter's death? ", "correct": "Burmese python", "options": ["Komodo dragon", "Nile crocodile", "American cobra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurmese python.\n\n\tThe photo showed a 13 ft.(4.0m) long Burmese python which had eaten a 6 ft. (2.0m) long alligator. The photo appeared to show that this mighty meal was too much for the snake and it burst open. Alternate theories have purported that the snake itself had become a meal for an even larger alligator who observed it lying motionless while it tried to digest its huge meal. While what exactly occurred is still debated, what is obvious is that the head of the snake was bitten off or popped off when it exploded. \n"}, {"text": "Why do alligators like to lie in the sun?", "correct": "Temperature regulation", "options": ["Hardens their hide", "Allows sun birds to pick mites from their skin", "Aids reproduction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTemperature regulation.\n\n\tAlligators, like all reptiles, are cold blooded. That is, they rely on the sun to help with temperature regulation. When too hot they will retreat to the water to cool themselves again. They are most active when the temperatures are between 82-92 degrees Fahrenheit. They will become dormant when temperatures dip below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. \n"}, {"text": "Alligators are omnivores.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlligators eat meat only and are thus considered carnivores. Alligators are opportunistic feeders. They will lurk quietly until a prey animal comes close enough to grab. They will eat fish, turtles, frogs, and small mammals. They have even been known to grab other larger animals such as deer and pet dogs that come too near. \n"}, {"text": "How do the snouts of alligators and crocodiles differ?", "correct": "Alligators have broader snouts", "options": ["Crocodiles have broader snouts", "Alligators have much shorter snouts", "Crocodiles have large green warts on their snouts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlligators have broader snouts.\n\n\tAlligators have much broader snouts. They are also slightly flatter on top. This is the quickest way to tell the two animals apart if you run into one. This is usually not a problem as the only place that they both live is Everglades National Park in Florida. \n"}]}
