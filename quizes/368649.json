{"id": "368649", "name": "Chemistry Trivia Quiz | Chemistry Mix | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Chemistry", "Chemistry Mix"], "questions": [{"text": "If an isotope of boron has a mass number of eleven, how many neutrons does it have?  ", "correct": "6", "options": ["4", "5", "7"], "explanation": "\n\n\n6.\n\n\tBoron has five protons. A neutral boron atom would also contain five neutrons, but isotopes are elements where the amount of neutrons differ from the amount of protons. \n"}, {"text": "Which scientist discovered the electron?", "correct": "J. J. Thomson", "options": ["J. J. Thomson ", "Bohr ", "Ernest Rutherford", "Robert Millikan "], "explanation": "\n\n\nJ. J. Thomson\n\n\tThomson discovered electrons as a result of his cathode ray tube experiments. He did this by firing currents through glass pipes filled with gas and recorded the electrical charge. \n"}, {"text": "What would happen if a chemist mixed pure sodium with water?", "correct": "The products would catch fire and explode", "options": ["No reaction occurs ", "The sodium would evaporate ", "The products would catch fire and explode ", "Sodium chloride forms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe products would catch fire and explode.\n\n\tWhen solid sodium is placed in water it skids across the top until a small explosion occurs. The products of the reaction are sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. \n"}, {"text": "If a strip of red litmus paper is placed into a solution and the paper turns blue, what is true about the solution?", "correct": "It is basic", "options": ["It is neutral ", "It is radioactive ", "It is acidic ", "It is basic "], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is basic.\n\n\tLitmus paper is one way to test the pH of a solution. Blue litmus paper is used to test acidity and turns red if the solution is acidic. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following elements is the most electronegative?  ", "correct": "Fluorine", "options": ["Hydrogen ", "Fluorine ", "Boron ", "Lithium "], "explanation": "\n\n\nFluorine.\n\n\tFluorine is the most electronegative element. If two atoms have a large difference in electronegativity they will form an ionic bond. A bond formed between two atoms with similar charges will be covalent. \n"}, {"text": "Based on periodic trends, when you move left to right across a family on the periodic table ionization energy decreases. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIonization energy, which is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom, generally increases across a family. Periodic trends can be used to compare two elements based on other characteristics such as size and electronegativity. \n"}, {"text": "Based on the ideal gas law, and a constant temperature, what happens to the volume of a gaseous system when the pressure decreases?", "correct": "Increases", "options": ["Decreases ", "Depends on the gas ", "Remains the same ", "Increases "], "explanation": "\n\n\nIncreases.\n\n\tThe Ideal Gas Law states that pressure times volume is equal to moles times 0.0821 times temperature(PV=nRT). If you know three of the four conditions of a gaseous system you can use this equation to find the fourth. \n"}, {"text": "To determine the amount of valence electrons an element has, look at the last digit of the element's what?", "correct": "Group", "options": ["Family ", "Group ", "Mass number ", "Atomic number "], "explanation": "\n\n\nGroup.\n\n\tValence electrons are the electrons in the outer sub-shell of an atom. The further away you get from the center of atom the more valence electrons the atom can hold. This is why larger atoms have more valence electrons then smaller atoms. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following ions is generally considered insoluble? ", "correct": "Carbonate", "options": ["Carbonate ", "Potassium ", "Sodium ", "Ammonium  "], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarbonate.\n\n\tWith a few exceptions, compounds that contain the carbonate ions will not dissolve in water and will form a precipitate (solid) in a chemical reaction. Sodium, potassium, and ammonium are all aqueous and will dissolve in solution. \n"}, {"text": "A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tActivation energy is the minimum amount of energy required to start a chemical reaction. A catalyst lowers activation energy by providing an alternate pathway for the reaction. \n"}]}
