The dark brown Uncle Sam bear has red and white striped feet and a red nose, and the white Uncle Sam bear has red feet with stars on them and a blue nose.

Interestingly, black panthers are actually leopards, and if you get close enough, you can see spots on their fur, very dark gray spots.

A female deer is known as a doe, and the male is known as a buck.  Baby deer, or fawns, have white dots on their back, which disappear as they age.  They are there so when they lie on the forest ground, it looks like they are dirt with sun spots that are shining through the trees, so they aren't detected as easily by predators, like grizzly bears.\r \"She's very shy as you can see\rWhen she hides behind a tree\rWith big brown eyes and soft to touch\rThis little fawn will love you so much!\" \n"}, {"text": "I don't want to make questions too easy on you, so we skip \"X\", where there is only the alphabet Beanie Baby appropriately named \"X\", and move right on to \"Y\"!
