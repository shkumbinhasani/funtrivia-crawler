What is its name?", "correct": "Solitaire", "options": ["Blackjack", "Freecell", "Hearts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSolitaire.\n\n\t\"Solitaire\", the world-famous one-man card game, is perhaps one of the most universally-owned computer games.  First released on the 3.0 Operating System in 1990, the game has barely changed since its introduction.  Players can play indefinitely by replaying a deck over and over, or they can have a single deck which can not be flipped during play.  As well, the player can also determine the amount of cards flipped per turn (one or three) and the design on the top of the deck.  This game, along with \"Hearts\", \"Freecell', and \"Spider Solitaire\" have made their way through the Operating Systems and are now standard on any new Windows system.\rThe game is also known as \"Klondike\", and the deck is produced in a completely random order. \n"}, {"text": "Another Windows game, this time first appearing in Windows 3.1, is also a standard on the Operating System, and it's the oldest non-card-based game to hold that title.  Which game is it?", "correct": "Minesweeper", "options": ["Space Cadet 3D Pinball", "Mahjong", "The Incredible Machine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinesweeper.\n\n\tThe game has an essentially simple premise- don't hit the mines.  Quite simply, your objective is to find squares on a playing field that are not inhabited by mines.  To do this, you click your way around.  When a coloured number appears, it indicates the number of mines surrounding that particular square (either above, below, to the sides, or diagonally), and using this, you can begin navigating.  As soon as one of said mines is clicked, the game is over.  Changing the difficulty of this game will create a bigger playing field with plenty more mines. \n"}, {"text": "This virtual table tennis game has been around since 1972.  What is the name of this popular Atari game which sparked the arcade era?", "correct": "Pong", "options": ["Table Tennis for You", "Virtual Tennis", "Powerball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPong.\n\n\t\"Pong\", created by Atari, was quite the simple game, though many non-players recognize it from the seventies.  Essentially, two players (or one against the computer) move their paddles up and down in an attempt to hit a small blip at their opponent.  If the opponent misses, then a point is given to the winning player; just like real table tennis!\rWithin a year of the game's creation, thousands of arcade systems were shipped across North America, and tons were hooked.  A few years later, the game was sent on home consoles.  The game later spawned many other classics such as \"Breakout!\", also by Atari, which involved one paddle, one blip-of-a-ball, and numerous coloured blocks that needed to be hit and removed from the field.\rAs video games progressed, \"Pong\" somewhat fell by the wayside, but everyone remembers the classic as it was one of the most simplistic games since the market for video gaming began. \n"}, {"text": "What colour was the original Pac-Man?", "correct": "Yellow", "options": ["Red", "Blue", "Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYellow.\n\n\t\"Pac-Man\" was created by Namco in 1980 and became a video gaming/arcade gaming hit.  If you can't remember the coin-operated arcade version of this game, then perhaps you've played it elsewhere.  A manifestation of this game can be found on various systems.\rThe game follows Pac-Man as he navigates a rather large and pointless maze for dots.  Hindering his task are four angry ghosts (Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde), who will wander around and attempt to hit Pac-Man.  If they succeed, Pac-Man loses a life.  Not all is lost though.  If Pac-Man reaches one of the four glowing dots on each stage, he will manage to transform the ghosts into their helpless, edible forms.  Eating these will allow Pac-Man to gain extra points, as will fruits that appear in random places along the way.\rFans will know that the game ends at the 256th level.  The game has appeared in many movies and TV shows as well. \n"}, {"text": "In what game does Jumpman need to save Pauline from her captor?", "correct": "Donkey Kong", "options": ["Mappy", "Jungle King", "Joust"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDonkey Kong.\n\n\t\"Donkey Kong\" first showed up in arcades in 1981, and since then, its main characters have grown to be some of the most popular gaming characters ever created.  Donkey Kong, first off, spread into its own gaming franchise.  Despite the fact that he began as an antagonist, players found more depth in the DK world when he became the playable character.  As well, Jumpman quickly transformed into Mario, and spawned one of the best-selling gaming series in the world.  Both have continued to clash, and occasionally, work together over time.\rThe original \"Donkey Kong\", on the other hand, featured Jumpman as he navigated ascending levels as the giant ape at the top produced new obstacles.  Upon reaching the final level, Mario would be able to free Pauline, the captive princess, and the evil ape would no longer reign over the tower.  The game \"Mario Vs. Donkey Kong\" (GBA), released in 2004, brought the feud back to Nintendo's handheld systems.  A sequel, \"March of the Minis\", was created for the DS as well. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the final boss of \"Super Mario Bros.\" (NES)?", "correct": "Bowser & King Koopa", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowser & King Koopa.\n\n\t\"Super Mario Bros.\" is one of those games that non-gamers tend to relate to.  Quite simply, it's one of the most popular, best-selling games created.  The game has spurred the development of numerous sequels as well as a feature film and a TV show in the 90s.  The game follows 'Super Mario' the plumber as he crosses numerous worlds to follow the evil King of Koopas, Bowser. See, as luck would have it, another damsel is in distress.  In this case, Princess Toadstool is in trouble, and Mario needs to cross eight worlds to reach the final castle containing the boss.  This formula transcribes onto future games in the series as well, but the sequel following this game (\"Super Mario Bros.2\"), has the Princess as a playable characters and a different final boss.  Both titles (and many others in the series) were ported to the Wii's virtual console early in the system's life due to their prominence in Nintendo's gaming library. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Tetris\", how many separate blocks are in each falling block (or tetrad)?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Three", "Five", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tOriginally created in Russia in 1985, \"Tetris\" has fallen through time (literally as well) to become one of the most well-know and seemingly basic games to be released.  Quite simply, four-block 'tetrads' fall from the top of the screen into a large ten-block-wide basin.  The player's job is to use the randomly generated tetrads (seven in total) to form solid horizontal rows.  When this is one, the player gains a point bonus and that row is removed, thus dropping the higher blocks.  However, this gets faster, and those who aren't quick enough will have to drop the tetrads in inconvenient places.  If a player stacks the blocks too high, it's game over.\rOver the years, \"Tetris\" has been made over into many variations.  One such popular incarnation was \"Dr. Mario\" for the NES.  The Nintendo 64 brought \"Tetris\" to the 3D world with \"Tetrisphere\" while the Nintendo DS showcased Nintendo-themed variants in \"Tetris DS\" in 2006.  \"Tetris\" is also available for the Ipod. \n"}, {"text": "In the games of this series, players could 'catch 'em all' to become the master of certain powerful creatures.  What gaming series spurred numerous sequels, hundreds of species, and millions of trainers worldwide?", "correct": "Pokemon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPokemon.\n\n\tNintendo and Game Freak first introduced \"Pokemon\" (in their \"Red\" and \"Blue\" iterations) in 1996 and the game quickly caught on.  Fueled by a popular kids TV show and Trading Card game, the Game Boy games took off.  Since its debut, various sequels and spin-offs dotted the release history of Nintendo's consoles and handhelds.  Furthermore, the games resulted in numerous peripherals for Nintendo 64 including the Transfer Pak (for the Game Boy games) and the Voice Recognition Unit (VRU) for the game \"Hey You, Pikachu!\".  This is the only game on the system to make use of the microphone.\rIf that isn't enough, the show, games, and cards also resulted in crazed fans on a mission to catch every piece of merchandise from stuffed toys to figurines.  Quickly, the game became a top-seller, and it appeared in the \"Guinness Book of Records\".  After \"Pokemon Diamond and Pearl\" were released on the Nintendo DS, nearly 500 different Pokemon species (and evolutions) had been created and captured. \n"}, {"text": "Fifteen million people, in total, have subscribed to this PC game.  In which constantly expanding game can players be a member of the Alliance or the Horde to fight for their faction?", "correct": "World of Warcraft", "options": ["Guild Wars", "Everquest", "Runescape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld of Warcraft.\n\n\t\"World of Warcraft\" first hit the MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) scene in 2004, and with a past of excellent online games, players were happy with Blizzard Entertainment's new offering having been fans of \"Starcraft\", \"Warcraft\", and \"Diablo\" (all for PC).  Essentially, the player creates their character's race and class, and follows them around the rather extensive World of Warcraft in a quest to level, raid, pillage, plunder, explore, and fight.  Although the game frequently updates with patches online, official expansions (\"Burning Crusade\", for example) have also been released to extend level caps and expand the maps.\rPlayers become fairly attached to their characters which have the ability to work solo or in teams to accomplish goals.  The game accommodates this as well.  Players can share experience and loot as they see fit, and oftentimes, skills and abilities held by certain players will be beneficial to others (for example, a Mage can create food, or a player with knowledge in Alchemy can make potions).  For years, \"WoW\", as it's commonly known, became one of the most popular online games ever created. \n"}, {"text": "Most people have seen this game in popular culture, or they've rocked out on the peripherals required for it.  \"Guitar Hero\" has had numerous sequels and has garnered many fans and awards.  How many fret buttons are on a single guitar?", "correct": "Five", "options": ["Six", "Seven", "Eight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive.\n\n\tOriginally, \"Guitar Hero\" was solely for the Playstation 2, but as its popularity grew, the game spread onto the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Wii, PC, and mobile phone.    Millions of these games have sold over the years, and with it, millions of guitars have popped up around the world without strings.  The player must hit the coloured buttons designating the frets on the guitar's neck,and at the same time, use a strumming bar to execute the actual note or chord.\rThe game takes immortalized classic rock songs as well as recent indie hits and allows everyday players to 'rock out'.\rFollowing the success of numerous \"Guitar Hero\" games, Harmonix Music Systems developed \"Rock Band\" for various systems.  This game makes use of two guitars (one for guitar, one for bass), a microphone (originally created for \"Singstar\") and a drum set (originally created for \"Beatmania\").  Four people could play at a time and the versions for next-gen systems could download new songs. \n"}]}
