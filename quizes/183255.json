As for the nickname Trapper, the meaning behind it is explained in the film and I won't repeat the seedy story here.  Suffice it to say, Mr. McIntyre is a real ladies' man. \n"}, {"text": "Trapper John shares a hometown with another character from the series.  Which of these 'M*A*S*H' characters is from the same locale as Trapper?", "correct": "Winchester", "options": ["Klinger", "BJ", "Mulcahy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinchester.\n\n\tBoth Trapper John and Charles are from Beantown (let's hope Charles isn't reading this!)  While Charles is a true Boston blueblood, McIntyre seems to be more middle class.  It was in Boston that Trapper and Hawkeye first met, prior to arriving in Korea (again, this is information from the movie.)  Trapper was schooled and did his residency in his hometown, also pre-Korea. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these actors did not play Trapper in either a television series or in the 'M*A*S*H' film?", "correct": "Tom Skerritt", "options": ["Elliot Gould", "Wayne Rogers", "Pernell Roberts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Skerritt.\n\n\tElliot Gould originated the Trapper John character in the 1970 film version of 'M*A*S*H', while the character was played by Wayne Rogers in the first three seasons of the television series.  The character was revived and given his own series called 'Trapper John, M.D.' in 1979.  Trapper John was played by Pernell Roberts in this series, which aired until 1986.  In this series the Trapper John character has considerably matured, and encounters a younger version of himself in Gonzo Gates, a veteran of a M*A*S*H unit during the Vietnam War. \n"}, {"text": "Though you wouldn't know it from his behavior on the series, Trapper John is a married man.  What is Trapper's wife's name?", "correct": "Louise", "options": ["Mildred", "Lorraine", "Laverne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLouise.\n\n\tLike Frank Burns, Trapper's wife is named Louise.

Rogers elected to leave the series after the third season, as he felt that his character's role was diminishing and that there was little chance that the trend would reverse.  The producers sued Rogers for breach of contract, but it turned out that Rogers had never actually signed a contract so the case was thrown out of court! \n"}, {"text": "In the third season episode 'Adam's Rib' we discover that Trapper is indeed a ladies' man.  What is the name of his former lady friend from Chicago?", "correct": "Mildred Feeney", "options": ["Gloria Arbus", "Cokie Wells", "Babette Newstrom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMildred Feeney.\n\n\tAccording to Trapper, Mildred was a three-night stand.  She must have been a memorable date because Trapper was easily able to recall her telephone number.  Hawkeye exploited Mildred's undying love for Trapper to help ship his 40 pounds of ribs from Chicago to Korea. \n"}, {"text": "In an episode during season two, Trapper decides to adopt an apparently orphaned Korean boy.

When Hawkeye confronts him with the problem, he admits that he's suffering from the ulcer.  Hawkeye sees this as a positive, suggesting that this is Trapper's ticket home.  However, Trapper discovers that he will not be shipped home as a result of the ulcer, but rather will have to spend time in a hospital in Tokyo (or be treated at the 4077th).  He elects to stay. \n"}, {"text": "During the run of the series, many different episodes revolved around letters home from the various characters.
