{"id": "44807", "name": "They Might Be Giants - 'Flood' Quiz / Test | Music | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music T-Z", "They Might Be Giants"], "questions": [{"text": "What year was 'Flood' made, according to one of the songs on it?", "correct": "1990", "options": ["1989", "2000", "1991"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1990.\n\n\tIt's in the 'Theme from Flood': 'It's a brand new record for 1990 - They Might Be Giants' brand new album, 'Flood.'' The word 'record' is a pun here - it also refers to the ocean levels 'rising up.' \n"}, {"text": "According to 'We Want a Rock,' what does everybody want besides a rock to wind a piece of string around?", "correct": "prosthetic foreheads on their real heads", "options": ["to throw the crib door wide", "to stop the ones who want a rock to wind a piece of string around", "to burn the playhouse down"], "explanation": "\n\n\nprosthetic foreheads on their real heads.\n\n\t'Someone in this town wants to stop the ones who want a rock to wind a piece of string around, but everybody wants a rock to wind a piece of string around.' The same goes for prosthetic foreheads on their real heads. \n"}, {"text": "'Istanbul was Constantinople', and 'even old New York was once New Amsterdam.' Why did they change it?", "correct": "People just liked it better that way.", "options": ["It's nobody's business but the Dutch.", "They knew it would make a good song.", "To avoid its reputation as colonial delight on a moonlit night."], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeople just liked it better that way.\n\n\t'Even old New York was once New Amsterdam. Why they changed it I can't say - people just liked it better that way!' Later the lyrics note that the change to Istanbul is 'nobody's business but the Turks.' \n"}, {"text": "In the song 'Minimum Wage,' what sound immediately follows the spoken words?", "correct": "a cracking whip", "options": ["a squeegee on a windshield", "the jingle of a cash register", "a feedback loop"], "explanation": "\n\n\na cracking whip.\n\n\tThe only lyrics are 'Minimum wage! Yaaah!', followed by a whipcrack and then about a half minute of instrumental music. Some liner notes evidently claim that the song is 12 seconds long, but it's always seemed longer to me and to most discographers ... \n"}, {"text": "'There's something beside the shoreline, coming up from the shipwreck, moving across the beachhead, making as if to say' ... what?", "correct": "'Women and men'", "options": ["'I'd like to change your mind by hitting it with a rock, though I am not unkind.'", "'Hot Cha, where are you?'", "'The thing that bothers me is someone keeps moving my chair.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Women and men'.\n\n\tThe song is called 'Women and Men.' The other quotes are all lyrics from this album, including the songs 'Someone Keeps Moving My Chair' and 'Hot Cha.' 'Whistling in the Dark' contains the quote about changing your mind. \n"}, {"text": "In Track 6, the singer complains to a friend of his about 'your ______ friend,' whom he'd met at a party. What kind of friend is it?", "correct": "racist", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nracist.\n\n\t'This is where the party ends - I can't stand here listening to you and your racist friend.' At the end of the song, when the racist friend has apologized, the singer observes: 'Can't shake the devil's hand and say you're only kidding.' \n"}, {"text": "In the song 'Particle Man,' Particle Man has a fight with Triangle Man. Who wins?", "correct": "Triangle Man & Triangle & Triangle wins", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTriangle Man & Triangle & Triangle wins.\n\n\tTriangle Man also defeats Person Man, while Universe Man keeps himself above the fray. \n"}, {"text": "In 'Birdhouse in Your Soul,' what kind of bird is in the outlet by the light switch?", "correct": "blue canary", "options": ["green canary", "yellow sparrow", "red parakeet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nblue canary.\n\n\t'Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch, who watches over you.' \n"}, {"text": "'There's only one thing that I like, and that is ...' what?", "correct": "'whistling in the dark'", "options": ["'sapphire bullets of pure love'", "'Hot Cha'", "'a rock to wind a piece of string around'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'whistling in the dark'.\n\n\tThe other choices are lines from other songs. 'Whistling in the Dark' is quite surreal. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these things might 'they' NOT be, according to 'They Might Be Giants'?", "correct": "short", "options": ["frying up a stalk of wheat", "Dr. Spock's back-up band", "rain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nshort.\n\n\tAnother surreal song.
