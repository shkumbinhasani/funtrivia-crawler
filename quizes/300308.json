{"id": "300308", "name": "\"Guild Wars\"...But Only PvP Quiz | Guild Wars 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Guild Wars", "Guild Wars 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Regarding the basic idea of Player vs. Player, is it possible to face off against players in instanced environments (eg. Old Ascalon, Jahai Bluffs, etc.)?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAlthough the game does wholeheartedly support PvP interactions in game, so much so as to offer numerous alternatives, \"Guild Wars\" in turn differs from game like \"World of Warcraft\" as it does not allow players to attack other players in PvE (Player vs. Environment) locations or towns.  Because of this, it is quite difficult to face off against players in 1 on 1 battles, though it can be done as long as players don't expect to do so on the beaten path.  Players can do this through their own guild, or if they're lucky, through a timed battle elsewhere in the game. \n"}, {"text": "What is the final battle location of Heroes' Ascent?", "correct": "Hall of Heroes", "options": ["Forgotten Shrines", "The Vault", "The Underworld"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHall of Heroes.\n\n\tHeroes' Ascent is a strictly-PvP environment in which players can take any character (at level 20) and play in groups of eight, one against another, to capture the ultimate prize that is the Hall of Heroes reward.  Getting there is difficult though as often, there are many other teams of eight vying for their chance to win the ultimate reward as well. Many battle arenas, from the Underworld, to the Fetid River, to the Courtyard, and the Hall of Heroes itself, players can test their mettle as a group to win as a random team or as a guild group.  Each consecutive battle won will result in Fame points, which in turn result in a 'Hero' title. At every third level of this title, the player character (though the title is account-wide) can perform a specialized reward emote. \n"}, {"text": "Players of the Kurzick alliance can play for Kurzick faction in Alliance Battles.  What other faction can they claim at the same time?", "correct": "Balthazar", "options": ["Kurzick", "Luxon", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalthazar.\n\n\tWhen a player jumps into any Alliance Battle, they'll be on one of the two warring sides, the Kurzick and Luxon sides, and this will reflect guild choice.  While the Kurzick side resides in Echovald Forest, the Luxons reside in the Jade Sea, and both of these factions will cross as the players fight alongside each other in Harvest Temple/Unwaking Waters, and beyond. The higher alliance faction your guild has, the more highly-esteemed they are, allowing for towns and outposts to be owned by said alliances.  The largest Kurzick town is House Zu Heltzer while the largest Luxon town is Cavalon.  Alliance faction can also be used to obtain Amber and Jade, each of which are used to create faction-specific armor sets. \n"}, {"text": "Which Alliance Battle location favours Luxon troops most?", "correct": "Kanaai Canyon", "options": ["Ersatz Coast", "Grenz Frontier", "Saltspray Beach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKanaai Canyon.\n\n\tThere are five possible locations for Alliance Battles in Cantha.  The location with the highest Luxon favour will be Kanaai Canyon, featuring a large Luxon base surrounded by Kurz forces.  The Kurzick equivalent of this location is the Ancestral Tombs.  The Ersatz Coast is a Luxon favored area while Grenz Frontier is for Kurzick benefit. Saltspray Beach is dead even, with a symmetrical playing field.  Alliance Battle locations are always determined by faction control in Cantha.  If Luxons take control of Kurzick outposts, for example, the arena will shift in order to give Kurzicks a fair advantage. This will also affect PvE environments as well, restricting basic services if you are in a town that is not owned by your faction.  Alliance Battles are only reachable through a guild hall. \n"}, {"text": "Balthazar faction can be used to unlock items and skills from the Priest of Balthazar.  What else can it do directly?", "correct": "Be used to obtain Zaishen Keys", "options": ["Be used to access the Underworld and Fissure of Woe", "Place an alliance-based town in your favour", "Improve your guild ranking"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBe used to obtain Zaishen Keys.\n\n\tBalthazar Faction is a bit more difficult to obtain than the other two alliance factions solely because it relies on the result of certain battles.  Every time a player character accumulates five thousand Balthazar faction, a Zaishen Key is an optional reward given by the Priest of Balthazar (who can be found in various locations).  This key can in turn be used on the Zaishen Chest on the Battle Isles, and every time a key is used it goes towards another title track. Balthazar faction can also be used to gain PvP player rewards.  If you give a Priest of Balthazar a certain amount of this faction, you can unlock skills, both elite and regular, heroes, and option item upgrades. \n"}, {"text": "What is the main objective of a Guild vs. Guild battle?", "correct": "Kill the Guild Lord", "options": ["Defeat the opposing party in a bake sale", "Defeat all members of the opposing team", "Capture the flag to accumulate the most points in an allotted amount of time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKill the Guild Lord.\n\n\tGuild vs. Guild battles (GvG) are primarily used to up the rank of your guild as a whole.  Teams consist of at least four members of the guild in some capacity and four members of any background (NPC or player, in the guild or not), and the main objective is to kill the opposing team's Guild Lord, which is cleverly nestled within the enemy base (usually guarded by other NPCs).  Adding to the mix is an impartial flag that will be in the dead center of the map.  This flag, when captured and returned to the Guild Lord, will reward that team with a morale boost every two minutes.\rDue to the lack of guilds that usually participate at one given time, lower-ranked guilds will often find themselves opposing higher-ranked guilds.  Regardless of the result, each match will affect the guild's overall ranking.  This ranking takes into account both the wins and losses of your team. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these cities does not contain an arena instance designated for PvP?", "correct": "Ventari's Refuge", "options": ["Ascalon City", "Yak's Bend", "Kamadan, Jewel of Istan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVentari's Refuge.\n\n\tAlthough the options for the Ascalon Arena, Shiverpeaks Arena, and Sunspear Arena are only available for lower-leveled players, they are PvP nonetheless, and because of the fact that they are still located on the basic world maps, they do donate a fair portion of explorable area to any cartographer title tracks. These arenas are 4 vs 4 locations and parties are formed through random means, and only when eight players are available.  Both the Sunspear Arena and the Shiverpeaks Arena are also available in Random and Team Arenas though this will not contribute to the cartography track.  Ventari's Refuge originally contained an arena named Koga's Fort, but this was removed in a later update along with the arena located in Droknar's Forge in the Southern Shiverpeaks. \n"}, {"text": "Which arena is not playable during a Random Arena match?", "correct": "Deldrimor Arena", "options": ["D'Alessio Arena", "Shiverpeak Arena", "Sunspear Arena"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeldrimor Arena.\n\n\tDeldrimor Arena closed permanently in 2006 and while it hasn't been used in Random Arenas, it used to be accessible from Droknar's Forge in the Southern Shiverpeaks for a Priest Annihilation arena.  The only other arena like this is the Seabed Arena near Zos Shivros Channel in the Luxon territory of the Jade Sea.\rAll of the other arenas listed (as well as many others) are involved in the random shufflings of the Random Arena circuit.  Five consecutive wins in Random Arenas will result in one Gladiator Point (which contributes to the Gladiator title track).  Once a player reaches four hundred Gladiator Points, they'll be able to display the title in their Hall of Monuments.\rAll Random Arena matches are played as a two team battle with each team containing four players. \n"}, {"text": "How many heroes can one have in their party during a Hero Battle?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["None", "One", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThis same rule applies for most other instances in PvE as well.  During a HvH battle, players will face off against one other player with three heroes.  In order to win the battle, the player must score morale points either by capturing shrines around the battle arena or by defeating another player and their heroes.  The first player to twenty points will win the match, or whichever player has the most points after ten minutes will win.\rEach point won results in twenty Balthazar Faction, and if a player competes in a Hero Battle ranked match, they will win a Victory Point for their ranking.\rHero Battles are accessible from Battle Isles, but players need \"Nightfall\" or \"Eye of the North\" to access it due to the inclusion of heroes. \n"}, {"text": "Which skill does not have a PvP version?", "correct": "Ward Against Enemies", "options": ["Chilling Victory", "Splinter Weapon", "Light of Deliverance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWard Against Enemies.\n\n\tAlthough the Elementalist spell, Ward Against Enemies, doesn't have a PvP version of itself, Ward Against Foes (an Earth Magic spell), does.  Many skills have near-duplicate, PvP versions due to the fact that it balances players out a bit more in battle.  In the specific case of Ward Against Melee, the ward duration is shortened.\rAlthough many would defining the fine-tuning of skills as nerfing, it allows for the game to be a bit more dynamic in a sense as players will need to rebuild their skill sets to better suit them in an ever-changing battlefield.\rSplinter Weapon is a Ritualist spell, Light of Deliverance is an elite Monk Healing Prayer, and Chilling Victory is a Wind Prayer attack for Dervishes.\rAll professions have at least one PvP/PvE split skill. \n"}]}
