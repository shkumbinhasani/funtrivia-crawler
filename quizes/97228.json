{"id": "97228", "name": "Mixed 'M*A*S*H' Queries Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "M*A*S*H"], "questions": [{"text": "In the episode called 'Showtime' during the first season, Henry Blake's wife has a child.  Which other character's wife gives birth during their time on the show?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["B. J.", "Klinger", "Trapper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tSadly, I began with something of a trick question.  Henry was the only one whose wife gave birth while he was serving in Korea, a baby boy.  Sadly...he never got to meet this child!  None of these other characters' wives had children during their time on the show, though both Trapper and B. J. were fathers.  B. J.'s daughter Erin was already born by the time he arrived at the M*A*S*H.  As for Trapper's kids, they were born, as far as we know, prior to the pilot episode!  Klinger never had a child on the show...but that would have made a pretty funny plot, don't you think? \n"}, {"text": "Two characters were married and divorced while on the show, but which ones?  ", "correct": "Margaret and Klinger", "options": ["Margaret and Henry", "Hawkeye and Klinger", "Henry and Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret and Klinger.\n\n\tWe all know about Margaret's ill-fated marriage with Donald, but perhaps less attention was drawn to Klinger's equally unhappy marriage with Laverne.  Happily, in the last episode Klinger is married again, to the Korean woman Soon-Li.  Charles was once 'married' on the show, but we find that the 'marriage' was actually a farce.  Personally...I think Margaret should have stuck with Scully! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters did not appear in both the pilot episode (the first) and the final episode?", "correct": "Klinger", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Father Mulcahy", "Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger.\n\n\tThough a different actor, George Morgan, portrayed Father Mulcahy in the pilot episode, the character was certainly a part of the show...if you will recall, he wins the raffle to accompany Lt. Dish to Tokyo.  William Christopher does not appear as Father Mulcahy until the third episode.  Klinger appears first in the 4th episode, while both Hawkeye and Margaret made it through the entire series...11 years! \n"}, {"text": "During season 8, an episode called 'Guerilla My Dreams' aired in which a North Korean woman appears at camp wounded and in need of surgery.  After repairing her injuries, Hawkeye is confronted by a belligerent South Korea army officer who insists on taking her to be tried and executed as soon as possible.  Naturally, Hawkeye and the rest of our friends attempt to sneak the woman out of camp while Winchester plays chess with the officer, marvelously played by Mako.  Charles, ever the egoist, can't stand the fact that he is being beaten at chess and attempts to distract his opponent, who in turn refers to Charles' ploys as the 'Winchester gambit'.  Which of these was not a part of Charles' desperate attempt to annoy this officer?", "correct": "Whistling Mozart's requiem", "options": ["Requesting tea", "Hammering and drumming the table", "Creaking his chair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhistling Mozart's requiem.\n\n\tPoor Charles, despite his machinations, he still loses his queen...but we never see the final outcome of the game, the Korean officer discovers Hawkeye's plot and takes the woman...but not before Hawkeye refers to him as a 'son of a ....'!  Very powerful episode... \n"}, {"text": "In the episode 'Too Many Cooks' the M*A*S*H-ites discover a certain Private Conway (played by Ed Begley, Jr.) who can't seem to handle a gun, but can prepare a wonderful meal even with army provisions!  What is the name of the first dish he concocts?", "correct": "Spam parmesan", "options": ["C-rations a la mode", "Goat l'orange", "Mystery meat mousse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpam parmesan.\n\n\tThe spam parmesan is so delightful that even Charles is taken in by its incredible scent.  After Conway decides to return to his outfit as the new cook, Klinger decides to take over in his stead...and produces his 'goat a la king'...yeck! \n"}, {"text": "In the second to last episode of the series, 'As Time Goes By', Margaret decides to bury a time capsule at the campsite, so that future generations could return and remember.  What is Father Mulcahy's contribution to the time capsule?", "correct": "Boxing gloves", "options": ["A Bible", "Helicopter fan belt", "Radar's teddy bear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoxing gloves.\n\n\tThe good father adds boxing gloves to the mix, suggesting that future generations clear up their disagreements in the boxing ring rather than the battlefield.  Hawkeye submits the broken fan belt from a helicopter, in honor of a heroic chopper pilot, and Radar's teddy bear in honor of the kids who 'came to Korea as boys, but returned as men'.  So far as I know, no Bible was added. \n"}, {"text": "How many times does Margaret's husband Donald Penobscott appear on the show?", "correct": "Twice", "options": ["Never", "Four times", "Once"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwice.\n\n\tFor some strange reason unbeknownst to me, two different actors play Donald during his two appearances on the show!  In the first appearance in the episode called 'Margaret's Marriage' Donald is played by Beeson Carroll, while in his second and final appearance in 'The M*A*S*H Olympics' he is played by Mike Henry.  I thought that the first Donald (Carroll) was more of the clever, preppie variety, while the second Donald (Henry) was a bit more of a thick-headed jock.  If anyone knows why the change occurred (from the 5th to the 6th season) please let me know! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters never has surgery performed on him/herself during the show's run?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Colonel Potter", "Radar", "Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tThe good Father once again comes through without a scratch, although in the end he does lose his hearing.  Colonel Potter buys some shrapnel in the backside which requires surgery to remove.  Radar sees the operating table a couple of times, most memorably when he is injured while going to have fun down at Seoul at Hawkeye's suggestion...leading to a very unhappy confrontation between the two characters.  Margaret also requires an operation at one point to remove her appendix...something that she insists be done by Hawkeye rather than Frank Burns! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the television coorespondent who interviews the various M*A*S*H characters in the episode called 'The Interview' (of all things)?", "correct": "Clete Roberts", "options": ["Robert Mandrake", "Ralph Simpson", "Harris Bullware"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClete Roberts.\n\n\tThis hour long episode, filmed in black and white and directed by Larry Gelbart himself, was one of the most memorable of the series.  Clete Roberts plays himself in the episode. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters was on the show for the shortest stint?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Radar", "Potter", "B. J."], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tSurprisingly, the guy you loved to hate...Frank Burns, only appeared on the show for five seasons.  Colonel Potter, Radar and B. J. all lasted eight seasons...Radar the first eight and Potter and B. J. the final eight.  My personal favorite character, Charles Emerson Winchester, was on the show for six years...I love that stuffy but sensitive fellow! \n"}]}
