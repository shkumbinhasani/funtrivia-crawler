{"id": "199622", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Edwina' Quiz / Test | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "This episode opens with suspenseful music and close-ups of the nervous dwellers at the 4077th.  Is there an air raid?  A sniper?  Have the North Koreans broken through the battle lines?  Even more fearsome yet, a nurse named Edwina is approaching the mess tent for her surprise birthday party.  \n\nWhen the cake is presented to Edwina, she blows out the candles.  In her usual fashion, some of the frosting flies off the cake and hits which of these chaps directly in the dog tags?", "correct": "Trapper", "options": ["Klinger", "Hawkeye", "Henry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrapper.\n\n\tTrapper is, unfortunately, standing directly in the line of fire, and Edwina's incredibly powerful lungs ensure a pasty party for his dog tags.  Even worse, Radar gets a splotch of frosting on his glasses, though if you will notice, in the next shot his glasses are miraculously clean...oops! \n"}, {"text": "Edwina is obviously a very popular member of the camp, despite her awkwardness.  She receives a number of lovely gifts from her friends at the 4077th, including a girdle from the nurses.  What special property does this girdle have, according to Nurse Cutler?", "correct": "Bullet proof", "options": ["Flame retardant", "Doctor enticing", "Belly repressing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBullet proof.\n\n\tEdwina receives some brass polish from Hawkeye and Trapper, a framed copy of the Ten Commandments from Frank and Margaret and a girdle from the nurses, bullet proof according to Cutler.  We are not told whether it is to protect her from the enemy or from herself. \n"}, {"text": "Henry Blake attempts to make a speech, but this is mercifully drowned out by the denizens of the 4077th who sing 'For She's a Jolly Good Fellow'.  What unusual thing occurs as the chorus for this song is being sung?", "correct": "Edwina runs out of the mess tent in tears", "options": ["Edwina passes out cold", "Edwina slips and falls on her birthday cake", "Someone steals Edwina's birthday gifts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdwina runs out of the mess tent in tears.\n\n\tJust at the most robust moment in the chorus, Edwina runs from the tent shouting 'I'm sorry'.  Even more frightening, she runs with knife in hand.  It could have been worse, however.  Henry could have been allowed to continue his speech.  Hawkeye blames Henry's speech, abortive as it was, for driving Edwina out. \n"}, {"text": "We discover following the party that Edwina is not happy.  During a conversation with Nurse Cutler, Edwina reveals a number of things about her life.  Which of these is not one of them?", "correct": "Her husband divorced her while she was in Korea", "options": ["Her ex-boyfriend's name was Seymour Chomkey", "She was engaged for almost two years", "She joined the army as a nurse in order to meet a man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer husband divorced her while she was in Korea.\n\n\tEdwina claims to be 28-years old, and has never had the comforts of a loving husband.  Seymour Chomkey could have been the fortunate Mr. Edwina, but he was drafted and stopped contacting the poor girl after only a month.  Edwina claims that, once he stopped writing, she decided to leave for Korea in order to find a relationship (strange reasoning, if one considers it a bit!) \n"}, {"text": "Radar has developed a new hobby while in Korea, or so he claims.  Which of these devious activities has become the pastime of the barely post-pubescent Corporal O'Reilly?", "correct": "Peeking in the nurses' showers", "options": ["Collecting nylons from the nurses' laundry lines", "Thumbing through the results of the nurses' physicals", "Making surprise inspections in the nurses' tent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeeking in the nurses' showers.\n\n\tRadar is really ill-behaved in these early episodes of the show.  In this episode, unfortunately, his deviant behavior leads to a stiff poke in the eye.  Trapper's diagnosis for Radar's ocular illness is the following: 'You put a heat compress on it and you start lookin' in the mens' shower for a few days.'\r Radar reveals during this conversation that the nurses have decided to boycott the men in the camp until someone accepts a date with Edwina. \n"}, {"text": "The nurses of the 4077th learn that Edwina has been given the cold shoulder by the men at the camp.  In retribution, they decide to collectively return the favor.  Does Henry Blake's ladyfriend Leslie partipate in this cruel boycott?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tEven Henry is forced to submit to this group ban on hanky-panky that has been organized by the clever and ruthless Nurse Cutler.  Poor Henry resorts to cold showers to stave off his suffering during this time of need. \n"}, {"text": "No longer able to take the terrible torture caused by the lack of feminine attention he has been receiving, Hawkeye Pierce makes a noble gesture and willingly volunteers to take Edwina out on a date.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNoble?  Pshaw!  There is nothing noble about Hawkeye's 'volunteering' for the duty of dating the hazardous Edwina Ferguson.  Rather, Hawkeye 'wins' the honor of this dreaded appointment through the drawing of straws.  Hawkeye draws the shortest straw among the men chosen to take part, asking feebly if they should not 'make it two out of three'. \n"}, {"text": "After much pomp and circumstance, including a very intricate dressing ceremony for both Hawkeye and Edwina, their much ballyhooed date begins.  In which of these exotic locales do the two of them attempt to enjoy each other's pleasure?", "correct": "The Swamp", "options": ["The mess tent", "The VIP tent", "The supply tent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Swamp.\n\n\tHawkeye and Edwina are both carefully dressed in Asian-style garb and perfumed.  Hawkeye is then dispatched to the nurses' tent, from whence they return to the stately trappings of the Swamp.  Along the way, Hawkeye is bestowed the greatest honor by Henry Blake, a salute. \n"}, {"text": "Edwina's date with Hawkeye goes rather miserably, with the former inflicting pain on the latter with every cloddish move.  This does not prevent the beleagured but good-hearted Hawkeye from delivering a kiss on Edwina's lips before the date is through.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tGood old Hawkeye.  After being splashed with gin, socked in the eye, burned on the tush, cut on the feet with glass and bumped on the shoulder, he is able to settle things down to the point where a gentle kiss on Edwina's lips is possible.  She repays him by knocking Hawkeye on the head with a stovepipe.  Maybe she didn't like his kissing style? \n"}, {"text": "Edwina is ably played in this episode by the later-to-become famous television personality Marcia Strassman.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMarcia Strassman made her fame on the television show 'Welcome Back, Kotter', but before that she appeared on two episodes of 'M*A*S*H' ('Requiem for a Lightweight' and 'Edwina') as Nurse Cutler.\r Nurse Edwina Furguson was portrayed in this episode by Arlene Golonka, in her only 'M*A*S*H' appearance.  Golonka has made many guest appearances on television shows, and may be most recognizable in film with her appearances in 'Hang 'em High', 'Airport '77' and 'The In-Laws'.\r Thank you for trying this quiz.  I hope you enjoyed it and will come back to try some of my many other 'M*A*S*H'-related quizzes. \n"}]}
