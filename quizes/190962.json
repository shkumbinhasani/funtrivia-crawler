His first directorial effort to be produced fully after the war brought him some notoriety overseas.  This is a story about a young woman named Yukie whose father loses his job as a professor, and her boyfriend is executed for his political beliefs.  What is the name of this film that is entitled 'Waga Seishun ni Kuinashi' in Japanese?", "correct": "No Regrets for Our Youth", "options": ["They Who Step on the Tail of the Tiger", "Judo Saga", "The Most Beautiful"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo Regrets for Our Youth.\n\n\t'No Regrets for Our (or 'My') Youth' was Kurosawa's first film to question the fascism he had most recently been living under.  The film also features kissing, something that wasn't allowed in Japanese cinema prior to the end of the war (the U.S. occupation force, aka SCAP, insisted that Japanese film mimic western film in this sense). \n"}, {"text": "Arguably Kurosawa's first great masterpiece was the 1950 tale called 'Rash\u00f4mon'.  This film featured the same story told by four separate people, each of whom tell very different tales.  Yet again, Kurosawa teams up with which actor, with whom he worked in sixteen different films?", "correct": "Toshiro Mifune", "options": ["K\u00f4z\u00f4 Nomura", "Masayoshi Nagasawa", "Yoshio Nakahira"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToshiro Mifune.\n\n\tThis marked the fifth collaboration between Mifune and Kurosawa, among a total of sixteen different films in which they worked as an actor-director team.  Rash\u00f4mon, which was given the English title 'In the Woods' (people still call it 'Rash\u00f4mon', even in the English speaking world), was remade into an American western called 'The Outrage' in 1963, a film that starred Paul Newman in the Mifune role. \n"}, {"text": "Most film critics consider the 1954 classic 'The Seven Samurai' (Shichinin no Samurai) to be Kurosawa's greatest single work.  The film has been remade several times in other countries, most notably in 1960 as 'The Magnificent Seven' by which American director?", "correct": "John Sturges", "options": ["Sam Peckinpah", "John Ford", "Anthony Mann"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Sturges.\n\n\tSturges rendition of this Kurosawa classic that features seven samurai protecting a small village from ravaging bandits is quite good, but doesn't quite stand up to the original.  The Sturges version featured actors such as Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn, all as gunfighters hired to protect a small Mexican village. Kurosawa's film features Toshir\u00f4 Mifune once again, this time alongside notable Japanese film stars such as Takashi Shimura and Seiji Miyaguchi.  By the way, one alternate English title that was used early on for 'The Seven Samurai' was 'The Magnificent Seven'. \n"}, {"text": "Kurosawa was very keen on adapting the works of Western authors to the silver screen.  Upon which Shakespeare play was Kurosawa's film 'Kumonosu J\u00f4', aka 'Throne of Blood' based?", "correct": "Macbeth", "options": ["Julius Caesar", "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "As You Like It"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMacbeth.\n\n\tThis was the first of two film adaptations of Shakespeare from Kurosawa.  Once again, the acting of Toshir\u00f4 Mifune is featured in this film, that takes place during the Japanese medieval times.  Especially watch for the performance of Isuzu Yamada as Lady Asaji Washizu (the Lady Macbeth role). \n"}, {"text": "The 1958 film entitled 'Kakushi Toride no San Akunin', aka 'The Hidden Fortress', about two thieves who escort a princess across enemy lines on a mission they don't understand, inspired which of these exciting American films?", "correct": "Star Wars", "options": ["The Princess Bride", "Entrapment", "The Wild Bunch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Wars.\n\n\tThe 1977 blockbuster classic 'Star Wars', by George Lucas, was roughly a remake of Kurosawa's 'The Hidden Fortress', though the stories do diverge at many critical moments.  Lucas claims that the most inspiring aspect of 'The Hidden Fortress' for him is that the story is told through the eyes of the two thieves, much as Star Wars roughly follows the adventures of two robots, R2D2 and C3PO. \n"}, {"text": "In 1960, Kurosawa created a very cynical view of Japanese corporate society with his film 'Warui Yatsu Hodo Yoku Nemuru'.  What is the English title for this rather dark film?", "correct": "The Bad Sleep Well", "options": ["Evil Lurks", "The Dark Side", "The Demons Within"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bad Sleep Well.\n\n\t'The Bad Sleep Well' is a tale obviously inspired by Shakespeares' 'Hamlet', though the bard is not featured among the writing credits.  In this film, a young corporate-type attempts to expose the corruption occurring within his company.  Clearly, Kurosawa was disturbed by the growing unscrupulousness within the post-war business environment in Japan, and this was his protest. \n"}, {"text": "In 1961, Kurosawa returned to samurai society in his filming of 'Yojimbo', the story of a samurai warrior who is hired as a bodyguard by two rival factions in a small village.  This film inspired another classic film called 'A Fistful of Dollars' by Sergio Leone.  Who was featured in the lead role in the Leone version?", "correct": "Clint Eastwood", "options": ["Charles Bronson", "James Coburn", "Steve McQueen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClint Eastwood.\n\n\tOnly Eastwood could provide such a tolerable rendition of the Sanjuro Kuwabatake character, played once again by Toshir\u00f4 Mifune in 'Yojimbo' (or 'The Bodyguard').  Leone was rather quick to pick up on this story, making his 'A Fistful of Dollars' (or 'Per un Pugno di Dollari') just three years later in 1964.  'Yojimbo' has been remade a number of other times as well, most notably as 'Django' by another Italian filmmaker, Sergio Corbucci. \n"}, {"text": "Kurosawa's film career was long in decline by 1980, when he created the film 'Kagemusha'.  Part of the reason that this film was able to be made relied on the fact that Kurosawa received funding support from two American directors.  Which two directors supported this project as executive producers?", "correct": "George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola", "options": ["Steven Spielberg and Lawrence Kasden", "Michael Cimono and Martin Brest", "Milos Forman and William Wyler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola.\n\n\tLucas and Coppola were both big fans of Kurosawa and both stepped in to help bring 'Kagemusha' (aka 'The Shadow Warrior') to the screen during the time when Kurosawa's career was clearly at a low point.  The story takes place during the late 16th century, chronicling a period in which a clear power shift was taking place among the Japanese elite.  It focuses on the story of Shingen Takeda (Kagemusha), one of those vying for power. \n"}, {"text": "This 1985 film by Kurosawa was probably his grandest production, featuring amazingly filmed battle scenes.  Roughly based on Shakespeare's 'King Lear', to which of the great Japanese film director's works do I refer? ", "correct": "Ran", "options": ["High and Low", "Dersu Uzala", "Red Beard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRan.\n\n\tOnce again back in the limelight after the international success of 'Kagemusha', Kurosawa embarked on this great project that was finally completed by 1985, and is known to us as 'Ran'.  For this film, once again, Lucas and Coppola (along with Steven Spielberg) helped provide the funding for its completion.  \r The story is roughly based on 'King Lear', Kurosawa's second film directly based on the bard's work (or third, if you count 'The Bad Sleep Well').  Unlike in 'King Lear', however, the three children of the king are male rather than female. \n"}, {"text": "One of the final films of Kurosawa's career was his haunting 'Yume', aka 'Dreams', from 1990.  This surrealistic film featured an appearance by which Hollywood director as Vincent van Gogh?", "correct": "Martin Scorsese", "options": ["Sidney Pollack", "Terry Gilliam", "Tim Burton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartin Scorsese.\n\n\t'Dreams' was probably Kurosawa's most personal and certainly his least coherent work, in terms of story.  Kurosawa literally features his own dream sequences in this haunting and beautiful film.  Another fan of Kurosawa's work, Scorsese appears in this film as Vincent van Gogh in one dream sequence, fitting considering that van Gogh was on the cusp of the modern art movement. \n"}]}
