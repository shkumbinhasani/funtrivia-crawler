{"id": "346842", "name": "Tumbling Down Rabbit Holes Quiz | Mixed Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Mixed Literature", "Specific Subjects & Themes"], "questions": [{"text": "Frank Beddor wrote a series of novels that were based on Lewis Carroll's classic novels, and the stories claimed to have been the \"real\" adventures of Alice.  What was the name of this trilogy, which was also the name of the first of the three novels?", "correct": "The Looking Glass Wars", "options": ["Alice of the Dreamland", "Seeing Redd", "ArchEnemy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Looking Glass Wars.\n\n\tFrank Beddor wrote \"The Looking Glass Wars\" in 2006.  The sequel, \"Seeing Redd\", was released in 2007, and in 2009, \"ArchEnemy\", the final novel of the trilogy was released.\r The novels focus on Beddor's interpretation of what really happened in the world of Wonderland.  For one thing, Alice Liddel's name was actually Alyss Heart, and she was a princess.  She found a portal to our world, where she grew up as Alice Liddell.  Beddor gave all the old characters new identities.  The Mad Hatter was a milliner named Hatter Maddigan.  Even Lewis Carroll was given a role in the novel.  In the novel, he was not known as Lewis Carroll; but as his birth name Charles Dodgson.  When Alyss found her way to our world instead of her own, she met a man, who turned out to be Dodgson, and she befriended him.  She told him of her early childhood, which he believed to be made-up stories from this little girl's mind.  He cheered her stories up a bit and published them as \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking Glass\".  This actually quite upset those who really lived in Wonderland, and created an interesting twist in the novels. \n"}, {"text": "\"Otherland\" was based on many novels, including those written by Lewis Carroll.  It is a futuristic science fiction tetralogy, written by whom?", "correct": "Tad Williams", "options": ["Vlad Williams", "Brad Williams", "Chad Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTad Williams.\n\n\tTad Williams wrote the \"Otherland\" series, which was based on many novels.  In this series, he writes his own interpretations of several classic novels.  These include \"Through the Looking Glass\", \"The Iliad\", \"The Odyssey\", \"War of the Worlds\", and \"The Wizard of Oz\".  His novels also bear a striking resemblance to the \"Lord of the Rings\" series of novels by J.R.R. Tolkien.\r In the novel, the Red Queen is mentioned, the chess-board is often used, and the evil men often become Tweedledee and Tweedledum.  The first in the series, released in 1996, was \"City of Golden Shadow\".  In 1998, the second was released, entitled \"River of Blue Fire\".  \"Mountain of Black Glass\" came next, in 1999, and finally, in 2001, \"Sea of Silver Light\" was released. \n"}, {"text": "Keith Sheppard wrote a novel about Alice from Lewis Carroll's stories.  He wrote, not a re-telling of the story, but of an additional adventure Alice apparently had some time after those that took place in Carroll's novels.  He even stayed true with Carroll's writing style.\n\nWhat is the lengthy title of his novel?", "correct": "Wonderland Revisited and the Games Alice Played There", "options": ["Alice Returns to Wonderland For The Final Time", "The Untold Stories of Alice's Adventures After Wonderland", "Does Alice Ever Age?

She plays many games with the people of Wonderland. \n"}, {"text": "Andrzej Sapkowski wrote a short story in 1997 called \"Zlote popoludnie\".

What was the name of his sciency (you heard me, \"sciency\") novel?", "correct": "Alice in Quantumland", "options": ["Alice in Scienceland", "Alice in Physicaland", "Alice in Mechaniland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlice in Quantumland.\n\n\tIn 1994, \"Alice in Quantumland\" was released by Robert Gilmore.

In the book Alice Lee meets many of the same characters Carroll used, but also meets new characters that Richards introduces. \n"}, {"text": "Alice finds her way to Wonderland by falling into a rabbit hole.  Oops!  She probably thought she'd fall to her death.  Have you ever realized, though, that Alice accidentally discovering Wonderland was the inspiration of many other classic novels?\n\nAll of the girls listed below accidentally found their way to a new world, but only three of them brought company.  Which of these stays most true to the story of Alice, due to the fact that she went into this world ALONE?", "correct": "Coraline Jones", "options": ["Wendy Darling", "Dorothy Gale", "Lucy Pevensie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoraline Jones.\n\n\t\"Coraline\" was written by Neil Gaiman in 2002.  The novel is about a girl, Coraline Jones, who discovers a secret passageway in her home that leads to an entirely new world.  The book has even been directly compared to Lewis Carroll's books.\r Wendy Darling, of course, took her two brothers with her to Neverland, which they accidentally discovered when Peter Pan entered their room and insisted he make them jump out their window...  Dorothy Gale magically entered Oz when she went through the twister, and she also brought Toto with her.  Lucy Pevensie went through the wardrobe, and returned to bring her three siblings to show her the wonderful world of Narnia she had accidentally discovered.\r Admit it, you had never realized how similar \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Peter Pan\", and \"Chronicles of Narnia\" were to \"Alice in Wonderland\", did you?  I know I had never known they were inspired by Carroll's novels! \n"}]}
