The manuscript itself was presented by a man who, twenty years earlier, received it from his sister's governess-- a woman he found to be generally very reliable in the way of information.  When it was received, he read it.\r The story pertained to the arrival of a governess at Bly Manor.  Upon being met by the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, she was also introduced to one of the two children in her care, a beautiful girl by the name of Flora.  The second child would be met upon his return to the manor in two days. \n"}, {"text": "According to Mrs. Grose, what fate befell the governess' predecessor?", "correct": "She passed away.", "options": ["She married.", "She was hired elsewhere.", "She was injured."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe passed away.\n\n\tIn her first days at Bly Manor, the governess received a letter from Miles' school stating that his presence was no longer welcome as he has acted as 'an injury to others'.  In asking Mrs. Grose for reassurance, the governess discovered that her predecessor, while great with the kids, left unexpectedly during her vacation and never returned, having died in her time away.\r While walking outside in the evening, the governess, still yet to meet the master of the house, paused to see a figure staring at her from the upper window of one of Bly Manor's towers.  All sounds seemed to hush around her as they gazed at each other.  He never stopped watching, even as he moved around. \n"}, {"text": "Mrs. Grose claimed that Peter Quint once fulfilled which role at Bly Manor?", "correct": "Valet", "options": ["Handyman", "Chef", "Security"], "explanation": "\n\n\nValet.\n\n\tWhen the governess returned to Bly Manor and recommenced teaching the children, everything seemed to continue on without need for concern.  This was true until one day, while retrieving a pair of gloves from the dining room, she witnessed the face of a man staring at her through the window.  She rushed outside to check on this trespasser but turned the corner to find that he wasn't there.  In discussing this event with Mrs. Grose, they determined that it must have been the handsome, red-haired former valet of the estate, Peter Quint.  But that couldn't be true.  After all, he was dead. \n"}, {"text": "Where did the governess first see Miss Jessel watching her and Flora?", "correct": "By the water", "options": ["Along the road", "In the tower", "In the bedroom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy the water.\n\n\tThe Governess wondered why her pupils never brought Peter up in conversation as it was clear, at least in her mind, that he was aiming to appear before them.  It took more investigation, mainly by consulting Mrs. Grose, for her to determine that Quint allegedly died when he slipped and fell, drunk, on the icy road to town.  Worried for the children, the governess decided to take on the role as their protector herself.\r It was shortly after this that the Governess witnessed another spectre, this time a woman staring at her and Flora from across a lake.  In telling Mrs. Grose about this instance, she came to realize that the figure watching, this time, was none other than Miss Jessel, the woman who took charge of the children before her. \n"}, {"text": "Frequently, the governess witnessed Flora looking out her bedroom window.  Who, as it turned out, was she watching in the middle of the night?", "correct": "Miles", "options": ["Mrs. Grose", "Peter Quint", "Miss Jessel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiles.\n\n\tMrs. Grose was, eventually, more forthcoming with the details surrounding Peter Quint and Miss Jessel, explaining that the former used to spend time with Miles and the latter with Flora before the issues that removed them from the house.  Unfortunately for the governess, the knowledge couldn't prepare her for an encounter, late at night, on the stairs of Bly Manor. Holding nothing more than a candle, she turned to find Peter Quint on the stairs, and the two of them stared at each other until he disappeared.  Following this, the governess went to check in on Flora and found she was missing from her bed, instead looking out the window. She would end up looking out her window again the following night, and this time the governess saw that she was staring out at none other than her brother, Miles, standing in the lawn. \n"}, {"text": "The governess recommends that the children be removed from Bly Manor to save them from the haunting there.  Does this removal actually occur?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe governess followed up with Miles after finding him standing out in the yard in the night and asked him why he was doing this, fearing that he and Flora were in contact with Quint and Jessel, but Miles explained that he wanted to prove to her that he could be bad and planned it as a joke with his sister.  This didn't quite satisfy his teacher's curiosity as she continued to believe that the children would be destroyed by the haunting figures.  She would later suggest to Mrs. Grose that they write to their employer to have the children taken away from Bly Manor altogether and spare them from the danger.\r As autumn came along, this never happened; they continued their lessons and she was unable to bring herself to ask the children if they were communicating with ghosts. \n"}, {"text": "The governess determined that she should write a letter to whom, inquiring about Miles' potential return to school?", "correct": "His uncle", "options": ["The head of the institution", "His father", "The mayor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis uncle.\n\n\tAs time passed, Miles asked more and more as to whether or not he would be able to return to school and questioned whether or not his uncle even cared about his studies.  The governess had little to say on this as she believed he simply didn't.  The governess returned to the house after a walk with the intent to leave Bly Manor altogether, but upon finding the ghost of Miss Jessel in the schoolroom, she believed with great conviction that she needed stay to protect her charges. She later told Mrs. Grose that Jessel spoke to her, claiming to want the children for herself, and with that she decided to pen a letter to the children's uncle asking for answers. \n"}, {"text": "The governess determined that, somehow, others could not often see the spectres around Bly Manor.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOn the evening of her renewed conviction, the governess started to write her letter but passed by Miles' room in the night.  Awake when she entered, he claimed to like Bly Manor very much but wanted to leave.  He insisted on his uncle arriving to hear his concern.  Shortly thereafter she did finish the letter but held off on having it sent, believing that her situation with the children was improving.\r One day, while Miles played the piano, the governess discovered that Flora had disappeared and asked Mrs. Grose to assist in locating her.  They ultimately found her near the lake, sitting in a clearing there.  Looking closely at the surrounding trees, the governess was able to see Miss Jessel watching...but no one else saw her. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these recommendations did the governess make when Flora started to fall ill?", "correct": "Remove her from the manor", "options": ["Allow her to wander the grounds", "Commit her to bedrest", "Bring the closest physician to the manor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRemove her from the manor.\n\n\tThough the governess saw Miss Jessel watching Flora from the trees near the lake, she pointed it out to Mrs. Grose and Flora to determine that they were unable to see the figure.  While Grose and Flora returned to the manor, all normalcy returned to the area outside and, upon her own retreat, the governess found that there was no real change to anyone's attitude towards the events.\rThe situation turned shortly thereafter, though.  When Flora fell ill, she started to fear the governess' presence.  Mrs. Grose decided to heed the governess' words and take Flora from the house to return her to her uncle, if only to protect her from Quint and Jessel for a short time.\r The governess also discovered that the letter she wrote for the children's uncle, left on a table in the manor, was taken but never delivered.  Though the letter only contained a request for an interview and nothing of particular detail, the governess believed that Miles took it to hinder her. \n"}, {"text": "Who does the Governess force to see Peter Quint?", "correct": "Miles", "options": ["Flora", "Mrs. Grose", "Ms. Jessel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiles.\n\n\tMrs. Grose did depart with Flora, and with haste, and it left the governess alone in Bly Manor with Miles.  They shared dinner before finally talking at length about the predicament and it appeared that Miles knew more than he was letting on, indicating that they were alone, but with \"The Others, though they don't really count.\"  Miles planned to tell her everything and they reestablished confidence. When she asked about the letter, he admitted to taking it, worried that she wrote about him (which she never did).  As it turned out, her was forced out of school for expressing his opinions to people he liked (who subsequently told the staff).  It was during this revelation that Peter Quint appeared at the window. The governess, pointing him out to Miles to help him see that which had apparently been unseen to him, forced him to come face-to-face with the spectre...and in fright, Miles died in her arms. \n"}]}
