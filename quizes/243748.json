{"id": "243748", "name": "Wii Sports Quiz | Wii Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games T-Z", "Wii Sports"], "questions": [{"text": "The first game on the menu is Tennis.  To move your player on the screen, you simply need to move the Wii Remote to the left or right.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlthough the concept of tennis may seem difficult for the average video game character, the \"Wii Sports\" version of tennis is much easier to control.  To move the Mii character, players don't need to do a thing.  The avatar will move according to where the tennis ball is aimed.  Depending on how fast the character is running for the ball, they may trip or fall, launching them through the air and missing the ball. \n"}, {"text": "What is the maximum number of players in a multiplayer Tennis game on \"Wii Sports\"?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Two", "There is no multiplayer mode for this game", "Eight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tTennis can support up to four players; two on each team.  You don't need four players to play though.  If one player begins the game on their own, they can choose to be the front and back character, or they can choose random computer-generated Miis to help them in the game.  Regardless of which character you are, the camera view will always be facing the opposing side to give you a better view of the field.  This allows for a simple dual-screen view when playing in multiplayer mode. \n"}, {"text": "How many innings can be played in a game of \"Wii Sports\" Baseball?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "Nine", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tIn the second sport of the game, players can see how they fare in baseball.  Players can either be a pitcher or they can be up to bat in this game, so only two players can be in the game.  The hitter simply needs to swing the remote to hit the ball, making the sport extremely realistic.  Once a ball is hit, depending on how far away it lands, your Mii will be placed on one of the three bases. \n"}, {"text": "In Baseball, what happens when you hold the B button during a pitch?", "correct": "You throw a curveball", "options": ["You throw a fastball", "You don't throw the ball", "You throw a splitter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou throw a curveball.\n\n\tWhile holding the B button during a pitch can allow the Mii to throw a curveball, holding the A button will produce a screwball and holding both buttons makes a splitter.  Creating a fastball involves the speed at which you throw the ball with the remote.  If one of these balls is caught either within the centre diamond or without hitting the ground, a player will be out.  If a player gains five points more than their opponent, the game will immediately end. \n"}, {"text": "How is it possible to get a star design on your bowling ball in the Bowling segment of the game?", "correct": "Achieve pro status in the sport", "options": ["Press the 2 button at the character select screen", "Have a 'Twilight Princess' memory file stored on your Wii hard drive", "Simply select the ball pattern before playing the game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAchieve pro status in the sport.\n\n\tPro status can be earned in any of the five sports by reaching over 1,000 points.  Each game has its own method of gaining or losing these points, and some of them have extra bonuses that can be earned.  To change the colour of your bowling ball in this sport, simply press any direction of the control pad on the Wii remote.  The ball can be blue, red, green, or gold. \n"}, {"text": "In the Bowling game, only two players can participate in the multiplayer version.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tUp to four different players can be supported on one Wii remote.  Also, the nunchuck attachment is not needed at all for this game.  If you happen to accidentally let go of the bowling ball too early in this game, you can toss it into the crowd behind you.  On the other hand, accidentally tossing the ball into the lanes beside you will make the spectators laugh. \n"}, {"text": "In the Golf portion of the game, how many holes can be played (at the most) in one round?", "correct": "Nine", "options": ["Eighteen", "Three", "Twenty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine.\n\n\tAlthough players can have their choice of three-holed Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced modes, they can also participate in a nine-hole course comprised of the three difficulties.  All nine holes are based on the course found in the 1985 NES game \"Golf\", which is also featured in \"Animal Crossing\", \"WarioWare: Twisted\", and on the Game Boy Advance 'E-Reader' attachment. \n"}, {"text": "Which aspect of the Golf game featured on \"Wii Sports\" can a player not alter?", "correct": "The direction of the wind", "options": ["The golf club", "The direction of the shot", "The strength of the shot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe direction of the wind.\n\n\tIn order to play Golf, you need to choose a club (usually, the default club is best for the situation), point in the right direction (accomplished by using the control pad), and shoot the ball by swinging the club back.  If you shoot too hard, you may accidentally shoot the ball off to the side or off course.  The direction of the wind can not be changed, as well as its speed, but it can be combatted if you change the direction of the shot. \n"}, {"text": "While playing the Boxing segment of the game, who is known as the 'Grand Master'?", "correct": "Matt", "options": ["Mark", "Carl", "Chris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt.\n\n\tMatt will be your final opponent of the game, and once he's beaten, you will be an official pro of \"Wii Sports\" Boxing.  To beat him, you will not only need stamina, but you'll need to use the blocks, punches, and dodges that will be strengthened throughout the course of the game.  Watch out though!  If you knock an opponent down, that doesn't mean they're out! \n"}, {"text": "After defeating the Grand Champion of the Boxing game, what coloured punching gloves can you use?", "correct": "Silver", "options": ["Gold", "None of these", "Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilver.\n\n\tAfter defeating Matt, you have a choice between a regular set of boxing gloves, or you can press the 2 button before beginning the game to switch them out for the silver pair.  As you progress on your way to pro status, you'll notice that the crowd of Miis around the boxing ring will increase, and possibly show Miis from your parade.  The same thing happens in Tennis as well!  Boxing is the only game on \"Wii Sports' to require the nunchuck attachment. \n"}]}
