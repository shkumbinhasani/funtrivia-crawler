Trivia Quiz | Music | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "Musical Instruments", "Guitar"], "questions": [{"text": "Along with the 'flat-top', what name is given to the alternative style of acoustic guitar?", "correct": "Arch-top", "options": ["Round-top", "Cone-top", "Wooden-top"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArch-top.\n\n\tThe basic flat-top guitar with a round sound hole is the style of guitar that everybody readily recognises.  The flat-top style covers classical guitars with nylon strings as well as the folk style guitar with steel strings.  Arch-top guitars were a later development designed with the intention of greatly increasing the volume and projection of the instrument. Many of the bands that existed during the early decades of the 20th century featured guitar players that used instruments such as these, which were so powerful that no external amplification was required.  Early pioneers of the arch-top instrument included manufacturers such as John D'Angelico, Epaminondas Stathopoulos - founder of the 'Epiphone' brand and, of course, Gibson guitars. \n"}, {"text": "There is little evidence of any instrument known as a 'guitar' existing before the 15th century.  Before being referred to as 'strings', what term was used to describe the strings on early instruments?", "correct": "Courses", "options": ["Paths", "Routes", "Tracks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCourses.\n\n\tThe earliest surviving instruments, which we would recognise as guitars, date from the late 16th century although it is certain that instruments of this nature existed before then.  Early guitars were frequently strung with only four courses of strings; however, each course may have consisted of one, two or even three strings. By the turn of the 17th century the five course guitar had become commonplace and two strings per course had become the standard.  Many early instruments also have frets made from gut that were simply tied to the fingerboard with securely fixed metal frets appearing at the end of the 18th century. It was also at around this time, at first in Italy and France, that the first six course, singly stringed guitars started to appear. \n"}, {"text": "For which style of instrument are makers Hermann Hauser, Ignacio Fleta, Masaru Kohno and Greg Smallman known?", "correct": "Classical", "options": ["Solid body electric", "Jazz", "Electro-acoustic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClassical.\n\n\tThey are all classical guitar makers of great renown.  Hermann Hauser I (1882-1952) was, and is still, considered to be one of the greatest luthiers in the history of the instrument.  His company produced a wide range of stringed instruments, all impeccably constructed and used until 1970, by Andres Segovia, one of the greatest guitar players in history. Ignacio Fleta (1897-1977) started working in Barcelona in 1927 and was known for his wide waisted instruments and for his habit of varnishing the inside of his guitar bodies with the aim of 'brightening' the sound.  Masaru Kohno (1926-1998) was a Japanese luthier who started building instruments in 1948.  In 1960 he studied guitar making in Spain under the luthier Arcangel Fernandez and set up his own business in Tokyo in the late 1960s.  Steve Howe of British progressive rock band 'Yes' is a high profile user of Kohno instruments. Finally, Greg Smallman is an Australian builder with an impressive reputation for innovation and quality.  He is one of the very few builders to use composite materials in his instruments, often with an extremely thin soundboard.  The virtuoso player, John Williams, is a user of Smallman guitars. \n"}, {"text": "The signature jazz guitars, the 'Tal Farlow', the 'Barney Kessel' and the 'Johnny Smith', were the products of which guitar company?", "correct": "Gibson", "options": ["Rickenbacker", "ESP", "Charvel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGibson.\n\n\tMany of today's producers have a number of 'signature' models within their ranges which have been developed with direct input from the players themselves or have been used by and endorsed by a particular artist.  As one of the early pioneers and leaders in the jazz guitar field it is clear that the Gibson Company would have an association with a number of top players. All three of these wonderful instruments were produced in very limited numbers, only 215 of the 'Tal Farlow' guitar were built during a five-year production run and the 'Barney Kessel guitar was only built for a total of ten years starting in the early 1960s and was recognisable by its 'bow-tie' fingerboard inlays. The 'Johnny Smith' was marketed by Gibson as an improvement over the New Yorker model by John D'Angelico - I am sure that some would argue that last point!  \n"}, {"text": "Your new plaything is fitted with a 'Floyd Rose'.  What style of instrument are you most likely to be holding in your hands?", "correct": "A Superstrat", "options": ["A Dobro", "A Guitar synthesizer", "A thin-line electric acoustic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Superstrat.\n\n\tThe vibrato units generically referred to as a Floyd Rose, appear almost exclusively on solid body electrics. These instruments are robust enough to withstand the forces exerted by these fittings.  They are aimed primarily at rock and metal players as this style of playing demands fairly heavy duty equipment!  The Floyd Rose style vibrato unit is used in conjunction with a 'locking nut' at the headstock end of the neck which helps to maintain the correct string tuning. The actual vibrato unit itself locks in place when the handle is in the vertical position and only enables 'whammy bar' techniques to be performed once the player has gripped the handle. It may well be possible to fit a Floyd Rose to many styles of guitar but, to be honest, who would be daft enough to fit, or attempt to fit, a Floyd Rose to an ES335?  Kerry King, maybe? \n"}, {"text": "Many of us have, at some time, come across the Fender Telecaster.  By what name was this guitar known on its release in 1950?", "correct": "The Broadcaster", "options": ["The Stratocaster", "The Baretta", "The Jazzmaster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Broadcaster.\n\n\tThe world's first commercially available solid bodied electric guitar was the Fender Broadcaster.  In 1951 Fender was forced to change its name as rival manufacturer Gretsch had filed prior rights to the Broadcaster name for a range of their drum kits, and so, the Telecaster was born and still remains in production today some 60 years later. The Telecaster is a fabulous guitar, as at home playing the blues, as it is playing jazz, country or rock 'n roll... a truly universal instrument.  The Fender Stratocaster was released in 1954 and is possibly the most recognisable body shape of any guitar ever built, the Jazzmaster is another Fender instrument introduced in 1957 as Fender's top-of-the-range guitar, but was withdrawn from production in around 1980.  The Baretta is a product from the Kramer Company and, as a 'superstrat' type, is aimed squarely at rock and metal players. \n"}, {"text": "Used until the Fender Company was sold to CBS in the mid 1960s, what term was used to describe the style that the Fender logo was written in on their guitar headstocks?", "correct": "Spaghetti", "options": ["Sans Serif", "Wingdings", "Linguine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpaghetti.\n\n\tThe original Fender logo became known as the 'spaghetti' logo and can be an effective method of roughly dating Fender instruments.  After the company was taken over by CBS in 1965, the logo became larger, appeared only as black lettering and was far more noticeable.  Along with the changes to the logo, Fender guitars also changed the headstock design to a wider style that remained in production until around 1971.  This headstock style was extended right across the Fender range and appeared on all models except the Telecaster, with one exception - The Telecaster Deluxe was the only model in the Telecaster range (ignoring custom built instruments) that was fitted with the wider style headstock.\n"}, {"text": "The 'Tennessean', the 'Country Gentleman', the 'Viking' and the 'White Falcon' are all products from which US guitar maker?", "correct": "Gretsch", "options": ["Aria", "Rickenbacker", "Ibanez"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGretsch.\n\n\tQuite simply, Gretsch build beautiful guitars.  All are big-bodied, and have become very fashionable over the last few decades.  Dating any Gretsch guitar can be fraught with difficulty and, more often than not, it is easier to identify a classic Gretsch guitar by the fittings and finish than by any serial number!  Gretsch guitars ceased production in 1981 but resumed again in 1985.  High profile users of these fine instruments included Malcolm Young of Australian rockers, AC/DC and Dave Stewart of British electro-pop band, Eurythmics. \n"}, {"text": "Which guitar innovator is responsible for the development of the headless bass guitar?", "correct": "Ned Steinberger", "options": ["Grover Jackson", "Joseph Raymond Butts", "Jack Bruce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNed Steinberger.\n\n\tFirst appearing in the early 1980s, the headless bass was the culmination of around 10 years of work by Ned Steinberger, an industrial engineer.  He was of the opinion that the most important part of a bass guitar is the neck, all other constituent parts playing minor roles.  He also considered that the secret to a bass guitar's tone and sustain was its solidity and, with this in mind, he designed guitars with bodies made from an inflexible moulded resin, strengthened with carbon fibre. The resulting instruments produced bright tones with virtually no 'dead spots'.  The headless design also meant that the tuning keys would need to be incorporated into the bridge unit. Headless basses are still produced today, however, they are far less popular than they were three decades ago. \n"}, {"text": "You are intrigued by a device fitted to your friends Fender Telecaster.  Allowing the player to change string pitch, and emulating the sound of a pedal steel guitar, what is this device known as?", "correct": "B-Bender", "options": ["Neck-Bender", "Air-Bender", "Chord-Bender"], "explanation": "\n\n\nB-Bender.\n\n\tThe 'B-Bender' is a device invented during the 1960s by two members of the band 'The Byrds' - Clarence White and Gram Parsons.  A series of levers and springs make a connection between the bridge unit and the front strap button.  Pulling the guitar down on its strap will raise the pitch of the 'B' string.  Another similar, but simpler device, known as a palm pedal, acted on either the 'B' or 'G' strings and was operated by pushing the edge of the hand against a pair of levers behind the bridge unit. \n"}]}
