{"id": "226921", "name": "Hardest \"CSI\" Season 3: Part II of IV Trivia Quiz | CSI: Las Vegas | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "CSI: Las Vegas", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Episode 7, \"Fight Night\", contains one of the funniest bits I've ever seen on the show: namely, the familiar transition from the end of the \"teaser\" (the short opening segment of the show) to the start of the opening credits and theme song is actually *interrupted* by the ringing of a cell phone! Whose phone stepped all over the familiar synthesized chord leading into \"Who Are You\" by The Who?", "correct": "Grissom's", "options": ["Warrick's", "Catherine's", "Jim Brass'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrissom's.\n\n\tGrissom did his familiar \"deliver the cute closing line/pun of the teaser\" bit, and we got to hear that synthesizer build to its usual crescendo...but then, Grissom's phone rang, cutting off the start of the theme song! \r I think this was the writers' way of pointing out that this would not be a typical episode, crowded as it was with three crime scenes instead of the usual two (or even, in some cases, one). \n"}, {"text": "Episode 8, \"Snuff,\" once again reminds us that Grissom is a studied entomologist. What kind of insects rear their ugly heads in this episode?", "correct": "fire ants", "options": ["tsetse flies", "gull wasps", "cockroaches"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfire ants.\n\n\tBrass informs Grissom that a corpse has been found, and it is covered in fire ants. Gil and Dr. Robbins are later forced to examine the body while dressed in protective suits...but Gil, oddly, admits that he EATS fire ants (specifically, he \"puts them on [his] eggs\"). \n"}, {"text": "\"Snuff\" also includes a guest-appearance by Pamela Gidley as Dr. Terry Miller, the \"face expert\" who gets called in as a consultant from time to time. Gil asks her to reconstruct the face of the skull that has been recovered. Once she finishes her work, it's apparent that there is something unusual about the victim. What is it?", "correct": "The victim had Down's Syndrome.", "options": ["The victim was a dwarf.", "The victim was not human.", "The victim had a harelip."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe victim had Down's Syndrome.\n\n\tTerry was able to tell, based on the physical structure of the skull, that the victim had had Down's Syndrome. This revelation made it far easier for Grissom to locate the murderer.\r Incidentally, this episode marked Terry Miller's fifth and final (as of February 2006) appearance on \"CSI\". She was originally introduced as a possible love interest for Grissom, but the news of her recent marriage in this episode kind of put the kibosh on that idea. \n"}, {"text": "The \"A\" story in \"Snuff\" dealt with a murder committed during the making of a snuff film -- a pornographic production that ends with the murder of one of the performers. Catherine and Sara wind up nailing Douglas Sampson, the man responsible for this horrific act. The actor playing Sampson is a blood relative of a much more famous film actor. Which one?", "correct": "Tom Cruise", "options": ["Alec Baldwin", "Ben Affleck", "James Caan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Cruise.\n\n\tWilliam Mapother is the first cousin of Thomas Cruise Mapother III, better known as Tom Cruise. Mapother later continued his \"look how creepy I am\" repertoire on the hit series \"LOST\". \n"}, {"text": "In the teaser of episode 9, \"Blood Lust,\" a young man is run over by a cab. It's later revealed, though, that even if the cab incident hadn't happened, the young man would have been dead in a few minutes anyway. What would have been his cause of death, had he never encountered the cab?", "correct": "a knife wound", "options": ["a bullet wound", "a heart attack", "a brain aneurysm"], "explanation": "\n\n\na knife wound.\n\n\tTodd Branson was fatally stabbed by his mother's boyfriend. He staggered away from the altercation, but was basically dying on his feet. The hit from the cab only shaved a few minutes off of his life. \n"}, {"text": "Quite a few people wind up dying in \"Blood Lust.\" Which scenario did NOT occur in this episode?", "correct": "A woman killed her ex-husband.", "options": ["A boy killed his mother's boyfriend.", "A man killed his girlfriend's son.", "A mob killed a complete stranger."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA woman killed her ex-husband.\n\n\tStuart Bradley stabbed the elder son of his girlfriend, Todd Branson. Todd's younger brother Eric shot Stuart. Once cabbie Rajeeb Khandelwahl accidentally ran over the dying Todd Branson, a large group of onlookers dragged Rajeeb out of his cab and beat him so  severely that he died a few hours later.\r None of the murders committed in this episode involved women, either as killers or victims. \n"}, {"text": "Which \"extreme sport\" is highlighted in episode 10, \"High and Low\"?", "correct": "para-gliding", "options": ["bungee-jumping", "snowboarding", "rock climbing"], "explanation": "\n\n\npara-gliding.\n\n\tIt seemed at first to be a case of a man who jumped off of the roof of a building, but Jimmy Maurer actually died at about 15,000 feet, and then fell out of his para-gliding rig.\r (I have to take issue with the science in this episode: a human body that falls that far will be reduced to liquid, basically, upon impact...but Jimmy's body is only \"banged up.\" There should be nothing left but goop and clothes!) \n"}, {"text": "The \"B\" story of \"High and Low\" focuses on a feud between neighbors. What is the transgression that led Frank Kraft to murder his neighbor, Roger Edmonds?", "correct": "Roger killed Frank's dog.", "options": ["Roger blew leaves into Frank's yard.", "Roger destroyed Frank's beloved mulberry tree.", "Roger stole Frank's cable."], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoger killed Frank's dog.\n\n\tFrank and Roger kept one-upping each other in terms of un-neighborly behavior, but the straw that broke the camel's back occurred when Roger ran over Frank's eternally barking dog with his car. Frank shot Roger dead almost immediately after finding the corpse of his beloved pet. \n"}, {"text": "Episode 11, \"Recipe For Murder,\" primarily focuses on a homicide that took place in the kitchen of an upscale restaurant. What kind of cuisine was served at this restaurant?", "correct": "French", "options": ["Indian", "Italian", "Japanese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrench.\n\n\tCatherine explains to Grissom that Debreff (pronounced \"dough breff\") is a five-star restaurant. \n"}, {"text": "The \"B\" story in \"Recipe For Murder\" features the death of a very troubled young woman.

By the end of the episode, what explanation is given for the young woman's death?", "correct": "Her father killed her.", "options": ["Her mother killer her.", "Her boyfriend killed her.", "She killed herself, just as the initial analysis suggested."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer father killed her.\n\n\tLinda Damen was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and frequently acted inappropriately and even violently. Her parents wanted her to get psychiatric help, but Linda refused to check herself into a facility. Linda's father, in desperation, drugged his daughter and slit her wrist, hoping to cause a superficial wound that would suggest a suicide attempt -- this way, he and his wife could legitimately have her committed, citing \"threat to self\" as cause.\r Unfortunately, Linda's father cut too deeply, and Linda bled out. \n"}, {"text": "In episode 12, \"Got Murder?\", what kind of animal is responsible for providing the CSI team with its first piece of evidence in the first murder they investigate?", "correct": "a bird", "options": ["a dog", "an insect", "a reptile"], "explanation": "\n\n\na bird.\n\n\tSome birdwatchers spot a raven with an eyeball in its mouth and contact the authorities.

What kind?", "correct": "a reptile", "options": ["a dog", "a bird", "an insect"], "explanation": "\n\n\na reptile.\n\n\tA used car salesman utilizes the venom of one of his pet snakes (a monacled cobra, to be exact) to kill one of his co-workers. \n"}, {"text": "Episode 13, \"Random Acts of Violence,\" opens with the tragic (and accidental) murder of a little girl.
