{"id": "387270", "name": "Ships of the Line Quiz | Star Trek Universe | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Star Trek Universe", "'Star Trek'  - Ships"], "questions": [{"text": "In which TV shows was the featured ship throughout the run of the show called \"Enterprise\"? \"Star Trek\"", "correct": "\"Star Trek\", \"Star Trek\" (animated), \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", and \"Star Trek: Enterprise\"", "options": ["All shows except \"Star Trek: Voyager\"", "All shows", "Only \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Trek\" (animated)"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Star Trek\", \"Star Trek\" (animated), \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", and \"Star Trek: Enterprise\".\n\n\tEven though the USS Enterprise-D was in the first episode of DS9, that was its only appearance.\r \"Star Trek: Voyager\" was mainly focused on the USS Voyager (NCC-74656) that was pulled to the Delta Quadrant of our galaxy, 75,000 light-years away from Earth. \n"}, {"text": "In which \"Star Trek\" shows did they feature a ship called Defiant in at least one episode?", "correct": "\"Star Trek\", \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\", and \"Star Trek: Enterprise\"", "options": ["\"Star Trek\" and \"Star Trek\" (animated)", "only \"Star Trek\"", "only \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Star Trek\", \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\", and \"Star Trek: Enterprise\".\n\n\tThe first Defiant was a Constitution Class was a class 1 heavy cruiser, the same as the USS Enterprise (\"TOS\").  It had become trapped in an interphase between our dimension and an unknown dimension.  The phasing process created irrational behavior in the crew, and they had killed each other or committed suicide.  Kirk was trapped there for a while, when they could only beam one person at a time back.  Eventually, Kirk was rescued, but the Defiant was lost.\r It later was revealed that the Tholians of the mirror universe had sent a distress call through an interphasic rift that they'd created.  It is what initially attracted the Defiant, where it was not only transported to the mirror universe, but also back in time over 100 years.  The Tholians captured the now crewless Defiant, and took it to one of their drydocks.  The mirror version of Jonathan Archer found out about it, led a mission to seize it, and flew it back to Earth.  Before they arrived, the mirror Hoshi Sato poisoned Archer and took command of the Defiant.  With a ship that had technology a century advanced that Earth, she then laid claim to the Empire.\r The 24th century starship Defiant (NX-74205) was a Defiant-class prototype ship that was assigned to Deep Space Nine when its original purpose as an anti-Borg ship was abandoned.  It was equipped with a Romulan cloaking device, which was to be used only in the Gamma Quadrant, to aid in intelligence gathering about the Dominion and the Founders.\r It served several years for the space station, but ultimately was destroyed with 310 other Starfleet ships during Second Battle of Chin'toka.  Another Defiant-class ship, the Sao Paulo, was assigned to Deep Space 9.  Captain Sisko received special dispensation to rename it Defiant.\r The first Defiant of \"DS9\" also made an appearance in \"Star Trek: First Contact\".  Worf was in command, joining the attack against a Borg cube that was poised to attack Earth. \n"}, {"text": "The Galileo shuttlecraft was featured in episode(s) of which \"Star Trek\" series?", "correct": "\"Star Trek\" and \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"", "options": ["\"Star Trek\" and \"Star Trek\" (animated)", "Only \"Star Trek\"", "\"Star Trek\", \"Star Trek\" (animated), and \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Star Trek\" and \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\n\tThe shuttlecraft Galileo was assigned to the USS Enterprise, given the hull number NCC-1701/7, implying that there were at least 7 shuttles assigned to the Enterprise.\r In \"Star Trek: The Animated Series\", there is an episode - \"The Slaver Weapon\" - that features a shuttle, but it is called \"Copernicus\" and is of a different type than the Galileo.\r The Enterprise-D's shuttles were named after real-life scientists and astronauts, notably Ellison Onizuka and Christa McAuliffe.  And, in the final episode, a prequel scene is shown, where Lt. Yar is piloting a shuttle with Capt. Picard as a passenger.  As they approach the USS Enterprise in its construction moorings, a crewman from the Enterprise calls them, referring to them as \"shuttlecraft Galileo\" and directs them to shuttle bay 2.  (Thanks to darrenr for this tidbit of trivia.) \n"}, {"text": "The USS Equinox was featured in a two-part story of what \"Star Trek\" series?", "correct": "\"Star Trek: Voyager\"", "options": ["\"Star Trek\"", "\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"", "\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Star Trek: Voyager\".\n\n\tThe Equinox was another Starfleet vessel pulled to the Delta Quadrant by The Caretaker, before Voyager had been seized.  Being a smaller ship and more devastated by the trip, Equinox's captain and crew were not as inspired to maintain their Starfleet virtues of non-interference.  They had found a way to harness the bodies of interdimensional beings, which contained a substance that boosted their warp drive.\r Voyager caught up to them as they were being attacked by the interdimensional beings.  Not knowing the Equinox's misdeeds, Voyager helped the crew of the Equinox, until they turned on them and left Voyager to the mercy of the aliens. \n"}, {"text": "In the \"Star Trek\" episode \"The Immunity Syndrome\", an all-Vulcan crew of a starship was killed by a giant (11,000 mile) single-celled creature.  What was the name of their starship, which was the same class as the USS Enterprise?", "correct": "USS Intrepid", "options": ["USS Exeter", "USS Excalibur", "USS Potemkin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUSS Intrepid.\n\n\tThough telepathic, Vulcans are rarely shown using this ability without a mind meld or other direct contact.  But in this episode, the sudden death of over 400 Vulcans assigned to the Intrepid cause Spock to sense their deaths, even over interstellar distance. \n"}, {"text": "Starships named Lexington, Excalibur, Hood, and Potemkin are featured in what \"Star Trek\" episode?", "correct": "\"The Ultimate Computer\"", "options": ["\"Court Martial\"", "\"Mirror, Mirror\"", "\"Turnabout Intruder\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Ultimate Computer\".\n\n\tThe M-5 multitronic computer is installed on the USS Enterprise to see how it could handle nearly all the operations of a starship.  It is resented by Kirk, as it makes him feel useless; this is inflamed by Commodore Wesley jokingly calling Kirk a \"dunsel\", a Starfleet Academy term for something that is useless.\r The computer begins to malfunction, by first not recognizing a drone-ship as non-threatening and destroying it, then attacking other Starfleet vessels during a war game exercise with phasers at full power instead of low power, killing many crewmembers on those ships.\r Kirk manages to talk to M-5 and make it feel guilty, thus it shut itself off and disabled the Enterprise's defenses.  Fortunately, Commodore Wesley calls off the attack, and M-5 is uninstalled.\r (episode, \"The Ultimate Computer\") \n"}, {"text": "In DS9, runabouts are used quite a bit.  Larger than shuttlecraft, but smaller than starships, they were used for most off-station travel that was relatively nearby.  \n\nCaptain Sisko would name the new runabouts that were assigned to DS9 after rivers on Earth.  Which of the following was NOT the name of one of DS9's runabouts?", "correct": "USS Colorado", "options": ["USS Rio Grande", "USS Yangtzee Kiang", "USS Ganges"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUSS Colorado.\n\n\tThe Rio Grande river system is either the fourth or fifth largest in North America (depending on how river lengths are measured).  Much of its length forms the Texas border with Mexico.\r The Ganges has the third largest discharge of Earth's rivers.  It flows through India and Bangladesh.\r The Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng (spellings vary) is the third longest river on Earth, the longest river entirely within one country (China), and has the 6th largest discharge.\r There are seven Colorado Rivers in the world today, two of which are in the United States.  The more notable one starts in the state of Colorado, and drains a watershed that encompasses seven US and 2 Mexican states.  Though it has a large upstream input, the heavy agricultural use of it causes it to not even reach its mouth on the north end of the Gulf of California. \n"}, {"text": "The USS Enterprise-D had a large number of shuttles that either appeared on-screen, or were seen listed on displays (*if* you recorded the show with a high-definition device).  They were named after famous scientists and astronauts.\n\nOf ones seen, which of the following was NOT a shuttlecraft of the Enterprise-D?", "correct": "Grissom", "options": ["McAuliffe", "Goddard", "Onizuka"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrissom.\n\n\tThe Onizuka and McAuliffe were named after Challenger shuttle astronauts who died in the January 1986 disaster.\r The Goddard was named after the pioneer of modern rocket propulsion in the United States, Dr. Robert Goddard.\r USS Grissom (not a shuttle, but a science ship) was named after Virgil Grissom, an American astronaut who died in a fire in the Apollo I capsule.  He was the second American to fly in space, and the first NASA astronaut to fly into space twice.  The Grissom was the science vessel assigned to study the Genesis planet.  They were destroyed (accidentally) when the Klingon Kruge wanted it disabled as he was trying to get information about Project Genesis.
