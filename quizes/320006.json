Who sang this song originally?", "correct": "Beyonce", "options": ["Madonna", "Lady GaGa", "Rihanna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeyonce.\n\n\tThe episode opens in Kurt's bedroom in the basement of his father's house.  Setting up his iPod and a handheld camera, he, Tina, and Brittany perform Beyonce's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\" for themselves.  Their rendition ends abruptly when Kurt's father comes downstairs and wonders what they're doing...and what he's wearing.  He explains that all the jocks at school wear unitards now as they keep sweat away from the body; it's 'jock chic'.  Brittany and Tina cover for him, saying that he's the kicker of the football team at school as he's the shortest player in the game.  Kurt goes along with it, claiming the girls are there for conditioning training.  Kurt's dad is satisfied with the response and tells his son to make sure he gets a ticket for his first game.\rMeanwhile, Terri and Will get pregnancy 'tips' from Terri's sister, Kendra, who nearly accidentally reveals the fact that Terri isn't pregnant.  Terri manages to divert Will's attention by asking her for a BLT and she tells her sister the truth, she was diagnosed with a hysterical pregnancy and she's been wearing a pad to make it look real.  Terri comes close to revealing the truth to Will, but Kendra stops her, saying that dishonesty fuels a marriage and that they just need to find her a new baby to cover up the fact. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Sue's news segment?", "correct": "Sue's Corner", "options": ["Champions", "Chat with Sue", "Success with Sue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSue's Corner.\n\n\tWill goes into the staff room for lunch the following day at school and sits with Emma and Ken.  Emma, who claims that she's a local news junkie, tells the guys that she saw a news segment the previous night in which Cheerios captain, Sue Sylvester, ranted about 'caning children' for a good minute before signing off with \"and that's how Sue sees it\".  Sue enters the staff room at this point to explain that she'd been handing out her resume for the job with WOHN and signing autographs after the segment.  Before departing for a satellite interview, she insults the three of them.\rAt Glee Club, the students are handed a new song by Mr. Schuester.  Rachel is worried with the song choice as she doesn't get to have the solo for a song she claims she had a distinct connection with since she was one year old.  Instead, Will gives Tina the part, her first solo.  Rachel storms off. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Kurt approach for a spot on the school football team?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Puck", "Will", "Ken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tKurt goes to Finn for a favor: a spot on the football team to impress his dad. Finn pulls through, and as the team attempts to go through their drills (failing on most accounts due to Ken's subpar training) Kurt walks onto the field.  Finn warns him that he needs to roll with the punches of the team and not take his own direction with it, but Kurt insists that he's like a rum-chocolate souffle- if he doesn't get warmed up, he won't rise. As a result, he gets his \"Single Ladies\" music ready.  Puck talks to Finn about inviting Kurt to join stating that he doesn't belong, but Kurt steps in at the huddle and tells everyone he's auditioning for the 'role' of kicker anyways. When the crucial moment arrives, Kurt hits play on his boom box, begins dancing to Beyonce, makes his kick, and performs a field goal- the first the team's had in many games.  He's automatically allowed on the team. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Quinn say that Finn got her pregnant?", "correct": "In a hot tub", "options": ["At a ski lodge", "At his house", "In the locker room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a hot tub.\n\n\tSue is approached by the President of WOHN who informs her that the station is questioning her future on the news show.  Since some of her students have defected to Glee Club, they are concerned that she won't win Nationals in the next year.  As he departs, Sue tries to figure out another way to plot the demise of Glee.\rFinn, meanwhile, finds Quinn in the school hallways and he approaches her as she's been giving him the silent treatment.  She finally reveals what's been troubling her: she's pregnant.  Finn is shocked and asks if it's his and she says that it is, of course.  When he asks when she got pregnant, she claims it was when they were in the hot tub at her house, even though they were wearing swimsuits. \n"}, {"text": "What song by Celine Dion does Rachel use to audition for \"Cabaret\"?", "correct": "Taking Chances", "options": ["My Heart Will Go On", "Because You Loved Me", "The Power of Love"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTaking Chances.\n\n\tSue decides to visit the school's old Glee coach, Sandy, who's evidently feeling trapped and isolated after being fired by the school.  She suggests that he take the school's arts administrator position in order to dismantle Mr. Schuester's Glee club from the inside.  Though Sandy's worried that Principal Figgins may impede on this, Sue says she's got it covered (as she'd already blackmailed him by threatening to release a commercial for anti-embolism stockings he made for Mumbai Air).  Their plan: take away the Glee Club's lynch pin, Rachel, by opening auditions for \"Cabaret\".  The bulletin board posting for this states that those auditioning must perform a Celine Dion song, so she chooses \"Taking Chances\".  After the audition, she's delighted to know that she has Liza Minnelli's role.\rWill speaks to Figgins about the situation and Figgins claims his firing Sandy was a rash decision on his part.  Though Will knows it was Sue's doing, there's not much he can do about it.  Will speaks to Rachel asking her to come back to Glee, but she says that Will shouldn't put her down to make Tina feel better.  Although she knows she's valued, she knows she's the best one in the club. \n"}, {"text": "Who suggests to Will that he teach the football team how to dance?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Kurt", "Ken", "Emma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tMr. Schuester sets Tina up with her solo, \"Tonight\" from \"West Side Story\", and she performs it beautifully, but she says that she doesn't want to do the performance, especially if Rachel will quit.  As she leaves, she says she'll take one for the team.  Before Will can leave, Finn nervously walks in and begins to cry on his shoulder.  Will takes him for a meal and talks with him about the Quinn situation, saying that he can help him with what he needs.  Finn simply notes that the guys who had kids when they were in high school never really left town.  Instead they trapped themselves in dead end jobs.  Upon reading one of the books from the library (which, as Finn says, \"just lends out almost all its books\") he found out that some football players have taken up dance, and after Kurt's ability to kick a field goal to Beyonce, he thinks that teaching the football team some moves may result in their winning a game.  Additionally, it may persuade some of the team to join Glee Club so that they can hit the minimum requirements for Sectionals.\rAt home, Will tells Terri about Quinn and Finn's predicament.  After mentioning the name of the student, Terri begins to smile about the situation. \n"}, {"text": "Finn is the real father of Quinn's child.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWill, Finn, and Ken all advocate dancing to the football team who are resistant to the idea at first but, as Ken says, they really have nothing to lose.  The team suits up and heads to the Glee Club room where they begin to learn the moves from \"Single Ladies\".  When it appears that they really have no clue, Kurt steps in and leads the team shortly before they all head to the showers.\rAs they leave, Finn tells Puck that Quinn's pregnant and keeping the baby which prompts Puck to confront her in the school hallway.  The two of them argue for a moment since Finn has never had sex with Quinn and Puck was her first partner, but she can't trust Puck to be a good father.  She calls him a \"Lima Loser\" since he'll never make anything of his life and she rushes out into the rain to get to her car.\rShe finds Terri waiting there, which surprises her since they've never met.  Terri notes that she can't be more than six weeks along judging by her looks and that she clearly hasn't been taking prenatal vitamins.  As she hands them to Quinn (because if she doesn't take them, \"her baby will be ugly\"), Quinn asks her what she wants.  Terry simply smiles at her. \n"}, {"text": "What colour are the McKinley High School football team jerseys?", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Black", "Blue", "Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tAs the big football game begins, the guys don their red outfits and decide that they can't do the \"Single Ladies\" dance during the game as it would make them a farce.  As the guys hit the field, Kurt waits on the sidelines and he watches his Dad sit down in the stands.  As the game progresses, it reaches a score of 0-6 for the home team and Finn makes a call for a time-out with a single second to spare. Before the timer restarts, the guys perform the \"Single Ladies\" dance, shocking both the crowd and their opponents.  This gives them the edge that they need in order to utilize the remaining time and they make the touchdown with Finn throwing and Puck receiving. The crowd goes wild. \n"}, {"text": "Does Kurt make the final goal during the football game?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIt's not over yet, though.  Kurt still needs to go up and perform a touchdown conversion to win it for McKinley High.  With the crowd on their feet and his father watching, Kurt lets his music play and he makes the kick, winning the game for the team (their first victory in ages).  Kurt's raised onto the shoulders of the team while his father cheers from the stands and Puck watches as Finn kisses Quinn on the sidelines, and he walks away.\rAt home, Kurt's father states that he's impressed with his son and very proud.  Kurt gains enough courage at that moment to tell his father that he's gay.  Kurt's father takes it well.  As he says, he knew that his son was gay since he was three because all he wanted for his birthday was a pair of sensible heels.  Despite the fact that he's a bit uncomfortable with the idea, he's proud anyways if that's who he is. \n"}, {"text": "How many football players join New Directions at the end of this episode?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Five", "Four", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tAt school, Finn hands his baby blanket to Quinn saying that he wants their baby to have it because his father gave it to him.  She thanks him for it as Puck walks by.\rMr. Schuester welcomes New Directions' newest members, Puck, Mike Chang, and Matt Rutherford, all from the football team.

She decides to leave Glee to pursue \"Cabaret\" with Sandy and Sue.\rThe episode ends with Kurt feeling proud of who he is, Rachel beginning to practice for Sandy, Sue performing \"Sue's Corner\", Will watching from home, and Quinn worrying about her situation. \n"}]}
