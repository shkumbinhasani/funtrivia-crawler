{"id": "43740", "name": "Le Subjonctif Quiz | Languages | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", "Languages", "French"], "questions": [{"text": "First let's make sure we've got all of our terms straight. Which of the following English statements uses the subjunctive?", "correct": "I insist that you be ready at eight.", "options": ["I would like to watch.", "I wish I was an astronaut.", "I want you to wash the dishes."], "explanation": "\n\n\nI insist that you be ready at eight.\n\n\t'I wish I were...' is also a commonly-used expression using the English subjunctive. In general, though, the English subjunctive is practically extinct. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following French phrases is ALWAYS followed by the subjunctive?", "correct": "Je souhaite que ...", "options": ["Je dois ...", "Parce que ...", "J'ai moins que ..."], "explanation": "\n\n\nJe souhaite que ...\n\n\t'Je souhaite que' means 'I wish that', and 'parce que' means 'because.' 'Je dois' means 'I must' and 'j'ai moins que' is 'I have less than' and is the beginning of a comparison. \n"}, {"text": "To find the subjunctive stem of most French verbs, you take the stem of which present-tense conjugation?", "correct": "third-person plural", "options": ["first-person singular", "infinitive", "second-person plural"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthird-person plural.\n\n\tThus, the verb 'choisir' - whose third-person plural conjugation is 'ils choisissent' - has the subjunctive stem 'choisiss-': que je choisisse, que tu choisisses, qu'il choisisse, que nous choisissions, que vous choisissiez, qu'ils choisissent.\r For some irregular verbs, both the third-person and first-person plural conjugations provide a subjunctive stem. Take the verb 'boire.' Its conjugation in the subjunctive mood is: que je boive, que tu boives, qu'il boive, que nous buvions, que vous buviez, qu'ils boivent. Notice that the 'que nous' and 'que vous' entries take the first-person plural stem, whereas the rest of the conjugation takes the third-person plural stem! \n"}, {"text": "As always, a few verbs are irregular. What's the subjunctive stem of 'savoir'?", "correct": "sach-", "options": ["savr-", "saur-", "sav-"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsach-.\n\n\tQue je sache, que tu saches, qu'il sache, que nous sachions, que vous sachiez, qu'ils sachent. Saur- is the future stem of savoir, which means 'to know.' \n"}, {"text": "What is the subjunctive stem of 'etre'?", "correct": "soi- or soy-", "options": ["ser- or serr-", "s- or c-", "et- or ed-"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsoi- or soy-.\n\n\tQue je sois, que tu sois, qu'il soit, que nous soyons, que vous soyez, qu'ils soient. Ser- is the future stem of etre, which means 'to be.' \n"}, {"text": "J'exige que vous (etre) ponctuel. Should the verb 'etre' be in the subjunctive or indicative mood?", "correct": "subjunctive & subjonctif & subj & s", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nsubjunctive & subjonctif & subj & s.\n\n\tJ'exige que vous soyez ponctuel: I urge you to be on time. Commands take the subjunctive. The indicative mood is the everyday one: Je serai heureuse. Je joue au Frisbee. And so on. There are many tenses -- present, future, past, past imperfect, and so on -- within each mood. \n"}, {"text": "Je n'esp\u00e8re pas que vous (avoir) des probl\u00e8mes. Subjunctive or indicative?", "correct": "subjunctive & subjonctif & subj & s", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nsubjunctive & subjonctif & subj & s.\n\n\tJe n'esp\u00e8re pas que vous ayez des probl\u00e8mes: I do not hope that you have problems. Esp\u00e9rer (to hope) usually takes the subjunctive when used negatively or in a question; when used positively and without doubt, it typically takes the indicative. Interestingly, souhaiter (to wish) always takes the subjunctive. \n"}, {"text": "Il est triste que sa tante (etre) morte. Subjunctive or indicative?", "correct": "subjunctive & subjonctif & subj & s", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nsubjunctive & subjonctif & subj & s.\n\n\tIl est triste que sa tante soit morte: It's sad that his aunt died. When you say that it's (any adjective) that (anything), then (anything) is always in the subjunctive. Je suis fachee que l'egalite ne soit pas un fait. C'est ironique que le gendarme ait pris votre livre, 'The Day They Came to Arrest the Book.' \n"}, {"text": "Suppose that you want to place a verb in the subjunctive mood -- but the verb refers to something that will occur in the future. What must you use?", "correct": "subjunctive mood, present tense", "options": ["transitional mood, future tense", "subjunctive mood, future tense", "indicative mood, future tense"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsubjunctive mood, present tense.\n\n\tThere is no future tense in the subjunctive mood. The same is true in English: it's 'I insist that you be at the movies at eight,' not 'I insist that you will be at the movies at eight.' The transitional mood doesn't exist either. \n"}, {"text": "Verbs following the phrase 'il faut' are ALWAYS in the subjunctive mood.", "correct": "false & f", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nfalse & f.\n\n\tVerbs following 'il faut que' are always in the subjunctive mood. But general instructions, with no specific subject, often leave out the 'que' and put the verb in the infinitive. 'Il faut cacher l'argent' is 'It is necessary to hide the money,' but 'Il faut que vous cachiez l'argent' (note the subjunctive) is 'It is necessary that YOU hide the money.' I hope this makes the subjunctive clearer! \n"}]}
