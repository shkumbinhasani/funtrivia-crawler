Coupvray is twenty-five miles away from Paris. Louis was born to Monique and Simon-Rene Braille. Monique was a homemaker while Simon-Rene worked with leather. \n"}, {"text": "Me: \"Mr. Braille, if you don't mind my asking, how did you lose your sight?\" \nMr. Braille: \"I don't mind you asking at all.

A female healer in the village bathed his eye, but Louis lost his sight in the injured eye and eventually an infection in his sightless eye moved to his good eye and damaged it. Louise Braille was blind by the age of four. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Braille: \"You are asking very good questions, my dear.

The school was started by Valentin Hauy in 1784. Father Palluy, who taught Louis after he became blind, had a letter written to the school for Louis's admittance. Louis was given a full scholarship. \n"}, {"text": "Before I could ask my next question, the waitress brought our tea to the table. I waited until she left to ask the question.\n\nMe: \"Mr. Braille, how old were you when you developed your system of reading and writing for the blind?\"\n(taking a sip of his cup of tea that I ordered him)\nMr. Braille: \"I believe I was. . .", "correct": "fifteen.\"", "options": ["sixteen.\"", "fourteen.\"", "fifteen.\" ", "thirteen.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nfifteen.\"\n\n\tLouis used a system of cells with six dots each to represent the alphabet. On the letters A-J, Braille was represented with dots on the first two rows. The letters K-T consisted of dots on rows one and two and one dot on row three. Lastly, U-Z had dots on rows one, two, three. \n"}, {"text": "Me (checking my notes and clearing my throat): \"Mr. Braille, I see in my notes that you left out a letter when creating your writing for the blind.

When a friend mentioned to Louis that there was no 'w' in his alphabetic writing for the blind, Louis added a 'w'. After tweaking his system, Louis took it to the new school director Doctor Pignier. The new director was amazed at what Louis had done. Louis would later add math, music, punctuation, and contractions to his code. \n"}, {"text": "We ordered more tea and I turned the page of my notebook for more questions.\nMe: \"Mr. Braille, after you graduated the blind school, what did you do?\" \n(Mr. Braille cleared his throat and smiled.)\nMr. Braille: \"I graduated in 1828 and then ...", "correct": "I became a teacher at the Royal Institute for Blind Youth.\"", "options": ["I visited the United States with my family.\"", "I went back to work with my father at his leather workshop.\"", "I worked in a cafe in Paris until I had enough money to go home.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nI became a teacher at the Royal Institute for Blind Youth.\"\n\n\tLouis Braille graduated from the Royal Institute for Blind Youth in 1828. After graduation, Louis became a part time teacher. With his salary, he purchased a piano for his room. With five years at the Royal Institute for Blind Youth as a part time teacher, Louis Braille became a full time teacher. \n"}, {"text": "Me: \"You sound like a very accomplished teacher, Mr. Braille, and very well loved by your students.

His first book was published in 1829. In 1834, Louis took his method of reading and writing for the blind to the Paris Exposition of Industry. \n"}, {"text": "(Mr. Braille wanted dessert so he ordered us a chocolate croissant and after the waitress left I opened my notebook once again and asked another question.)\nMe: \"Mr. Braille, you designed a machine that would help the blind write letters.

This machine would help blind people write letters to people with sight. Pierre Foucault designed the raphigraphe, but gave Louis all the credit since it was Louis that developed the new writing style for the blind. \n"}, {"text": "(I finished half of my croissant before returning to my questions.)\nMe: \"Mr. Braille, it was always the intention of the Royal Institute for Blind Youth to move into a newer building for the health and safety of the blind students. However, that never came about, did it?\"\nMr. Braille: ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLouis Braille moved into the rundown school as a child in 1819.

After leaving the school, he returned home where his health seemed to improve. The improvement was short-lived and Louis died on January 6, 1852, two days after his forty-third birthday. Before his death, he left a note asking that a box in his room be burned without being opened. The box contained IOU's from the students that Louis had never collected. \n"}]}
