{"id": "385948", "name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Quiz | Reptiles and Amphibians | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Reptiles and Amphibians", "Turtles and Tortoises"], "questions": [{"text": "It's obvious where the \"red-eared\" part of their name comes from, but why is \"slider\" included in their name?", "correct": "They can quickly dislodge from rocks and logs and slide into the water.", "options": ["They were once used as pucks in ice hockey", "When cooked the meat is slippery", "They can retract, or slide, into their shells"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey can quickly dislodge from rocks and logs and slide into the water.\n\n\tThey are part of the order Testudines along with more than 250 other species. Among those species they can slide into water the quickest of all of them, to avoid predators or just to go for a swim.\r This may or may not be part of the reason they were chosen to mutate into ninjas in the comics and other media. The red-eared portion is why all four members of the team wore red masks initially though. \n"}, {"text": "Which gender of the red-eared slider turtle is generally larger?", "correct": "Female", "options": ["Male", "It depends on environment, neither gender is generally larger", "They are asexual"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFemale.\n\n\tWhen red-eared sliders are young, it is hard to tell their gender apart as both genders look nearly identical. As the turtles age, however, the females tend to grow larger than the males of the same age. Males are generally in the 10 centimeter range, and females around 15 centimeters at full growth. The males also tend have longer claws which help in the mating process.\r The exact opposite of this played out with the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" in the live action show \"The Next Mutation\". The show introduced a female turtle who was significantly smaller than the original four male turtles. \n"}, {"text": "Why do red-eared slider turtles lie out in the sun a lot?", "correct": "They can't regulate their own body temperature", "options": ["They need sun rays to clean their shells", "They put food on their shells and cook it in the sun", "They typically don't lie in the sun much as it's bad for them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey can't regulate their own body temperature.\n\n\tRed-eared Sliders have no internal body temperature regulators. For that reason they are mostly found in temperate to warm climates. They sit out in the sun when they are cold and dive in the water when they are hot. \n"}, {"text": "Red-eared sliders don't hibernate. Instead they do something similar known as what?", "correct": "Brumate", "options": ["Hydrate", "Burninate", "Hyphenate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrumate.\n\n\tTo brumate, or be in the act of brumation is to go into a period of dormancy. While it physically appears to be similar to hibernation, the metabolic processes involved are different. During brumation the turtle can still function, albeit it much slower than usual.\r Burninate is what the internet comic character Trogdor does! \n"}, {"text": "How old are red-eared sliders when they reach sexual maturity?", "correct": "5 years", "options": ["6 months", "18 months", "1 year"], "explanation": "\n\n\n5 years.\n\n\tThe males of the species will court females before they reach sexual maturity, but they can't produce offspring before they are at or near five years old. Some are closer to six years old before they are able to reproduce. When held in captivity, males may appear to be courting other males or other pets, but it is generally thought to be a sign of dominance and not homosexuality within the species. These displays often lead to fights if not prevented by the pet owner.\r Several times in the \"TMNT\" comics, movies and television shows they are shown to have an interest in female characters. Of course they are also almost always depicted as teenagers unless there is a flashback or flashforward segment. \n"}, {"text": "How many eggs are typically laid by red-eared slider turtles after mating?", "correct": "It depends on body size and varies greatly", "options": ["1", "150", "They don't lay eggs; they are live-birth animals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt depends on body size and varies greatly.\n\n\tDepending on the body size of the female, they typically lay between 2 and 30 eggs in at a single time.\r While preparing to lay eggs the female often changes her diet to eat different things, and also tends to eat less than when she isn't gestating eggs.\r In the \"TMNT\" series they are almost always depicted as either pet shop turtles, or as someone's pets. That's how they get away with not having up to 30 mutant turtles running around. \n"}, {"text": "Following their popularity with the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" children around the world got red-eared slider turtles as pets. Of the countries listed, which one deemed them an invasive species and outlawed them?", "correct": "Australia", "options": ["Mexico", "Canada", "Russia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAustralia.\n\n\tThe problem of children and adults alike getting tired of their pet turtles and releasing them in the wild was so bad in the late 1980s and early 1990s that the country as a whole had to ban their import and sale.\r It was during this same time that the Playmates toy line for the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" introduced \"Walkabout\", a walking talking kangaroo from Australia, though that likely wasn't related. \n"}, {"text": "What is the diet of a red-eared slider turtle?", "correct": "Omnivorous", "options": ["Legumivorous", "Herbivorous", "Carnivorous"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOmnivorous.\n\n\tAn omnivore is a species that eats both plants and animals to stay alive. The general diet for red-eared slider turtles is aquatic plants, but they also eat small bugs and other proteins if there isn't enough plant life to survive on.\r This is replicated in the comics, television series and movies as the \"Ninja Turtles\" all eat pizza in large amounts. The pizzas often have both meat and vegetables on them. \n"}, {"text": "When do the turtles generally retract their head and limbs inside their shells?", "correct": "When they sense danger", "options": ["When they sleep", "Whenever they aren't walking or swimming", "When they eat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen they sense danger.\n\n\tThe species typically leaves its head and other extremities outside the shell to help soak up warmth and sunlight but has the ability to retract inside the shell as a defense mechanism.\r Their shells, much like those of the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", act as a protection and barrier from attack. \n"}, {"text": "Which U.S. state was the first to outlaw the sale of red-eared slider turtles because they were mating with yellow-bellied sliders and causing issues with the local population?", "correct": "Florida", "options": ["Utah", "Maine", "Wyoming"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlorida.\n\n\tFlorida is the only state on the list that would offer a suitable climate for the red-eared slider to survive in the wild.\r In Florida the population was mating with the other turtle subspecies causing turtles with mixed color patterns, red-ears and yellow bellies.\r Florida outlawed the sale of \"wild type\" red-eared sliders, but not those born into captivity.\r In the \"TMNT\" universe, a cross-mating like that couldn't happen because the turtles are heroes and would never be depicted as having \"yellow bellies\", or being cowards. \n"}]}
