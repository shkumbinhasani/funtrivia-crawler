{"id": "349005", "name": "The Last, But Not Least Quiz | Miscellaneous Animal Trivia | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", " Miscellaneous Animal Trivia", "Endangered Species"], "questions": [{"text": "The last specimen of which now extinct animal died at the Hobart Zoo in 1936?", "correct": "Thylacine", "options": ["Bhulan", "Boto", "Susu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThylacine.\n\n\tThe last thylacine, who was named \"Benjamin\", died at the Hobart Zoo after being left outside during extreme weather. This unique animal was the world's  largest carnivorous marsupial. The thylacine died out after a major hunting campaign was instituted by the Tasmanian government between 1888-1909 who believed the animal caused harm to livestock.  A systematic annihilation of the species ensued.  The thylacine is also known as the Tasmanian tiger. \n"}, {"text": "Believed to have been extinct since the 1960s, where was the last Yallara seen in the wild?", "correct": "Cooncherie Station, Australia", "options": ["Antananarivo, Madagascar", "Alamogordo, New Mexico, U.S.", "Cheboksay, Russia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCooncherie Station, Australia.\n\n\tThis native Australian marsupial has often been compared to a rabbit and lived in the desert areas in the central part of the country. Less than 20 specimens were ever collected once they were discovered in 1887. This nocturnal animal was described as being aggressive in spite of their docile appearance. This is an example of the extinction of a native species due to the introduction of a new species. Numerous small mammals have become extinct around the world due to the introductions of rats, rabbits, or cats into an new area. \n"}, {"text": "The last known Barbary lion in the wild was killed by a hunter in which North African mountain range?", "correct": "Atlas Mountains", "options": ["Langkloof Mountains", "Maloti Mountains", "Asbestos Mountains"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtlas Mountains.\n\n\tThese magnificent lions were used by the Romans in their infamous fights in the Coliseum in Rome. Few photographs of these beautiful animals exist and most descriptions of the time describe them as being very large and some sites claim that they were the largest of the subspecies of lions. The lack of food in the area led to these animals living a solitary existence rather than in prides as is seen in other subspecies.They were native to the far northern regions of Africa and roamed the Atlas Mountains. There have been modern claims by various zoos that they have a Barbary lion, but DNA testing has debunked these claims.Some have shown to have DNA that was indicative of having a possible ancestor that was a Barbary lion. Attempts to \"breed back\" these selected lions are underway. The other three mountain ranges are found in Southern Africa. \n"}, {"text": "The last specimen of which of the following antelopes died in the Paris Zoo in 1923?", "correct": "Bubal Hartebeest", "options": ["Gemsbok", "Nilgai", "Blackbuck Antelope"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBubal Hartebeest.\n\n\tThe Bubal Hartebeest were, at one time, a very important domesticated antelope in areas of Northern Africa. It's beautiful lyre-shaped horns have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs. This beautiful animal was hunted into extinction by French colonials who would shoot whole herds for sport. This adaptable animal was able to live in the various geographies found in Northern Africa.They were even mentioned in the bible where they were referred to as \"Yachmur\" (1 Kings 4:23). At one time they were so numerous and so important to the local populations that the ancient Egyptian had a hieroglyph that meant \"baby hartebeest\". \n"}, {"text": "The last Round Island Burrowing Boa was seen in 1975 on which of the following island nations, which was also home to the extinct Dodo bird?", "correct": "Mauritius", "options": ["Madagascar", "Malta", "Mali"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMauritius.\n\n\tIsland species are especially vulnerable to extinction. Numerous species native to Mauritius have gone extinct in the past two centuries. The last Round Island Burrowing Boa was seen in 1975 and it has not been spotted since, in spite of intensive searches attempting to locate survivors. This burrowing snake was usually about one meter (39 in) long and is assumed to have dined on the numerous local lizard species.The introduction of goats and rabbits to Mauritius around 1840 resulted in major damage to local vegetation. The palm forest habitat, where this boa lived, deteriorated. This is another example of the destruction that introduced species can cause to island flora and fauna. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following was a zebra-like animal which became extinct on August 12th, 1883, at a zoo in The Netherlands?", "correct": "Quagga", "options": ["Quahog", "Quokka", "Quetzal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuagga.\n\n\tThe quagga was hunted into extinction for its unusual hide. This variety of plains zebra was brown and white as opposed to black and white. It also only had stripes on the front half of its body. The last quagga was shot in the wild in the late 1870s. There is only one known photograph taken of a living quagga, which was taken at the London Zoo in 1870. In 1883 the very last quagga died at the Natura Artis Magistra zoo in Amsterdam. \n"}, {"text": "The introduction of the European fox to the country of Australia has caused, or contributed greatly to, the extinction of over a dozen native species.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSadly, this is true and some estimates quote the number of extinct species to be closer to 20. Australia was home to some of the world's most unique species and the introduction of foxes, rats, and rabbits have decimated many animal populations that are indigenous to nowhere else on the planet. The fox is implicated in the extinction of the Eastern-Hare wallaby in 1890, the pig-footed bandicoot in the 1950s and the Toolache wallaby in 1939, just to name a few. \n"}, {"text": "What was the main cause of extinction of the Javan Tiger last seen in 1972?", "correct": "Habitat loss", "options": ["Natural disaster", "Disease", "The introduction of the brown bear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHabitat loss.\n\n\tThe Javan tiger died out from loss of habitat when the population of Java increased and their habitat was claimed by man for the cultivation of food. As the population of the island increased the population of the tiger decreased. The islanders undertook the deliberate destruction of this subspecies by hunting with guns and poisoning.In the early 19th century Javan tigers were common and the local peoples believed them to be reincarnations of their dead ancestors. So their behavior at the beginning of the 20th century was unusual. While the last Javan tiger was sighted in 1972, it is possible that the species lingered into the very early 1980s. The loss of habitat and agricultural encroachment seen on the island of Java is echoed on islands all over the globe and is responsible for the increased loss of animal species.\n"}, {"text": "Declared extinct in 2000 the Pyrenean Ibex was what kind of animal?", "correct": "Goat", "options": ["Bird", "Cow", "Pig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoat.\n\n\tCelia that last natural Pyrenean Ibex was killed by a falling tree in 2000.  This species was, at one time, very common in areas of Spain, Portugal and France. Both sexes sported magnificent back-swept horns and short grayish brown fur.This is a case where naturalists are not sure why this magnificent wild goat died out. Most agree that it was a combination of over-hunting, inbreeding, and disease all played a role. In 2009 an attempt to clone this animal using a domestic goat as a surrogate led to the birth of a baby which survived for seven minutes before dying. \n"}, {"text": "In 2011, the western black rhinoceros was declared extinct.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWestern black rhinoceros lived in the savannas of Cameroon for centuries. They were herbivorous browsers and were hunted to extinction. A lack of serious preservation efforts and rampant poaching caused the extinction of this magnificent animal. In 2000 the last ten members of this subspecies were seen and no subsequent sightings have occurred. What is even more tragic is that all subspecies of rhinoceros may be extinct within the 21st century unless major protection efforts are undertaken and supported by the local governments in which these unique animals live. \n"}]}
