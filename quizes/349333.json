{"id": "349333", "name": "Survivor: Palau Quiz | Survivor: Palau | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Survivor", "Survivor: Palau"], "questions": [{"text": "How many castaways were a part of \"Survivor: Palau\"?", "correct": "Twenty", "options": ["Eighteen", "Twelve", "Sixteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwenty.\n\n\tMore than any other \"Survivor\" to date, \"Palau\" featured a total of ten men and ten women battling to win a million dollar grand prize.  Arriving in a single boat, the castaways were told that they would be heading to their home on a nearby beach.  In the first few minutes they were told that they would land on their beach to find two immunity necklaces, one for the first man on the beach and one for the first woman. It would be completely up to them to decide how to obtain it.  The winners of this task were Ian and Jolanda, both of whom would be responsible for selecting the tribes on Day 2 consisting of nine members each. This would, inadvertently, eliminate one man and one woman from the game. \n"}, {"text": "When the time came to split into tribes, half went to Koror and half went to what other tribe?", "correct": "Ulong", "options": ["Balboa", "Lopevi", "Pagong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUlong.\n\n\tOn Day 2 the tribes were set-- nine went with Jolanda to Ulong and nine went with Ian to Koror in a schoolyard-style picking process.  Ulong received blue buffs while Koror took brown and Wanda and Jonathan went home having not been picked to join either group.  When tribes had been decided, Jeff informed them that they would all be sharing the same beach, at least for the time being.  It took less than one more day before the tribes started to live in different locations; Koror decided to move to a second beach (infested with rats). \n"}, {"text": "On Day 12, both tribes eliminated one member.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOn Day 12, both Ulong and Koror arrived at the beach for their Reward Challenge; this involved collecting bottles from the bottom of the sea floor.  When all was said and done, Ulong received the reward, beef stew and root beer.  Unfortunately, they needed to vote out a member at Tribal Council for the first time to enjoy the meal. Unanimously, they voted out Willard.  Immediately after, Koror arrived for their fifth consecutive Tribal Council where Ibrehem was voted to win individual immunity (by members of Ulong) and Angie was eliminated following a tie vote.  Ulong was able to attend this ceremony while enjoying their reward. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the final member of Ulong?", "correct": "Stephenie", "options": ["Bobby Jon", "Ibrehem", "James"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStephenie.\n\n\tConsidering Koror's endless immunity streak, it was inevitable that Ulong would continue to return to Tribal Council, voting off another tribe member every few days.  On Day 21, the final two members of Ulong headed to Tribal Council after a seventh consecutive loss to compete to stay in the game.  This involved a fire-building challenge between Stephenie and Bobby Jon which was won by the former.  Bobby Jon went home without a vote against him in that ceremony while Stephenie went back to camp alone.  This was the first time in \"Survivor\" history to see such a defeat. \n"}, {"text": "There was no merge in \"Survivor: Palau\".", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOn Day 22, Stephenie received mail at the Ulong tree mail box containing a single sealed canister and a map to the Koror beach.  Heading on over she discovered that inside the canister was a brown buff-- the game would become an individual one and the teams would not be merging.  Since Koror won every Immunity Challenge and wiped out the Ulong tribe, Stephenie would be inducted into their group. They would not make a new tribe name or flag and everyone would remain with a brown buff under Koror.  Stephenie was at a great disadvantage, but lasted another week before being voted out.  This was the first time in \"Survivor\" history in which there was no merge. \n"}, {"text": "The first to quit the Immunity Challenge on Day 26 (for the final eight) was forced to go to which of these locations?", "correct": "Exile Island", "options": ["Redemption Island", "Isle of Lost Souls", "Paradise Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExile Island.\n\n\tThe first person to remove themselves from the Immunity Challenge on Day 26 would be in for a certain shock.  For this challenge, the final eight castaways needed to keep themselves under a metal cage top, fighting the tide to keep breathing.  The last one to stay under the cold water would win immunity.  The first out of the task, however, would be exiled on an island, alone, for the evening with nothing but a few supplies (including flint and steel).  Janu quit the challenge only six minutes into the task and spent the night in solitude. \n"}, {"text": "Which castaway quit \"Survivor: Palau\"?", "correct": "Janu", "options": ["Stephenie", "Gregg", "Jenn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJanu.\n\n\tOn Day 27, returning from her night on Exile Island, Janu opted to quit the game when she arrived at Tribal Council feeling that she did not want to spend any more time with the people at Koror.  This, in turn, spared Stephenie from getting eliminated for being the final original Ulong member.  Unsurprisingly, many of the people in Koror didn't want her to stay around due to her tendency to annoy them; they were only keeping her around as insurance.  She was the only one to quit the game throughout its duration and she became the second member of the jury. \n"}, {"text": "During the \"Survivor: Palau\" auction on Day 28, how many castaways received letters from home?", "correct": "Five", "options": ["Four", "Three", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive.\n\n\tAs is customary during \"Survivor\" auctions, the castaways each received $500 for bidding in the challenge.  For the most part, the castaways bid on delicious foods.  The catch this time was that all of the foods would be mystery items (including spaghetti, meatballs, and garlic bread, an ice cream sundae, and double cheeseburgers, fries, and soda).  In addition to this, five castaways received letters from home (all but Jenn and Ian).  After the next Reward Challenge, the tribe members would have a chance to meet up with their loved ones. \n"}, {"text": "The final three, competing for the final immunity of the game, participated in the challenge for approximately how long?", "correct": "Twelve hours", "options": ["Five minutes", "Two hours", "Six hours"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelve hours.\n\n\tIn the final Immunity Challenge on Day 38, the final three were led to a small bay to perform a lengthy endurance task focusing specifically on their will and their longing to win.  Perched on three buoys, they would need to balance as long as they possibly could; the last one to remain on their buoy, swaying in the water, would win the final Immunity, securing their spot in the final two. This challenge lasted five minutes shy of twelve hours.  Because it lasted as long as it did, an elimination was made on the spot without a Tribal Council ceremony (for the first time in \"Survivor\" history). \n"}, {"text": "Who became the Sole Survivor of \"Survivor: Palau\" winning the million dollar prize?", "correct": "Tom", "options": ["Katie", "Ian", "Jenna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom.\n\n\tIn the very last Tribal Council on Day 39, the seven jury members asked questions and cast their votes to either Tom or Katie.  While Coby voted for Katie, everyone else on the jury (Janu, Stephenie, Gregg, Caryn, Jenn, and Ian) all voted for Tom, winning him the million dollars and a new Chevrolet truck. Tom was voted for by most because of his tendency to be honest with the other players, for contributions to life on the island, and for winning a number of challenges, leading Koror to victory and keeping himself immune to votes; Karen was considered to have ridden too many coattails during the game and alienated others outside her alliance. \n"}]}
