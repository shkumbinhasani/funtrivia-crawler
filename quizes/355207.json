{"id": "355207", "name": "British (GNAS) Target Archery [2] Quiz | Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", " Sports Other", "Archery"], "questions": [{"text": "Each archer, depending on the round being shot, will shoot a maximum of 6 arrows per 'end' split into two groups of three arrows each.  Under GNAS rules how much time is an archer permitted to shoot three arrows?", "correct": "Two and one half minutes", "options": ["Five minutes", "Six minutes", "Three and one half minutes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo and one half minutes.\n\n\tEach archer is allowed two and one half minutes to shoot three arrows.  Should an archer exceed this time allowance, the presiding judge will issue a warning in the first instance and, if the archer persists, they will then be asked to leave the shooting line and will not be permitted to compete again that day. Time allocations are rigidly enforced during top-level competition, but we British have a somewhat more relaxed approach, especially at club tournament level, and unless it is absolutely clear to the judges that any stalling is a deliberate, delaying tactic intended to unsettle the opposition, it is rare to see an archer asked to retire. \n"}, {"text": "You stand astride the shooting line, arrow nocked; you begin to draw your bowstring.  As you raise your bow and come toward your anchor point, your fingers slip on the bowstring and, shocked, you send the arrow hurtling into the ground two metres in front of where you stand.  Can you still shoot this arrow or another from your quiver?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAs you stand there on the shooting line, you will have noticed a line marked on the ground at a distance of 3 metres forward of the shooting line.  This line is known, unimaginatively, as the 3 metre line.  Should any arrow or part of any arrow, fall within this area, then the arrow may be shot again.  On this occasion you may shoot another arrow in its place. When this occurs you must immediately bring the fact to the attention of a judge, usually by stepping back from the shooting line and raising your bow above your head.  It is often the case that the judge will allow you to draw another arrow from your quiver to shoot in its place. Should you not have another arrow available, the judge will allow you to go forward and retrieve your arrow, but only after everyone else on the line has finished shooting.  Safety is of paramount importance and you should never go forward of the shooting line without the express permission of a judge.  Any arrow that lands forward of the 3 metre line is deemed as shot and is irretrievable for scoring purposes. \n"}, {"text": "The senior presiding judge at a shoot may appoint any number of archers to assist himself or herself with the running of the event.  By what name are these appointees referred to?", "correct": "Field Captains", "options": ["Target Captains", "Field Marshalls", "Shoot Controllers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nField Captains.\n\n\tAny number of archers may be asked to act as field captains and these are often the more experienced archers present, whether they are shooting that day or simply assisting with shoot administration.  Field captains are usually tasked with ensuring that the target stands and bosses are correctly positioned and spaced, at the correct height and are in a safe condition. It is also often found that one archer from each target is appointed as a target captain who is responsible for ensuring that the scoring is carried out accurately.  The judges rely on archers to be honourable and not to try to enhance their scores. In my 40 years of involvement in the sport, I have never had cause to question an archer's scorecard. \n"}, {"text": "Your arrow has cut the narrow black line that separates the red and the blue areas of the standard target face.  Do you score the higher (red) or lower (blue) number of points with this arrow?", "correct": "Higher (red)", "options": ["Set number of points agreed before the shoot begins", "No score", "Higher (red) ", "Lower (blue)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHigher (red).\n\n\tAny black separating line on the face of a target is always deemed to lie within the higher scoring zone.  This applies equally to the finer lines that divide areas of the same colour and are used to score in FITA competitions.  These arrows are referred to as 'line-cutters' and always score the higher number of points. \n"}, {"text": "You arrive at a GNAS record status tournament scruffily dressed in military style camouflage clothing.  Will you be permitted to shoot even though you have paid your entry fee?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn recent years, GNAS have relaxed the requirements of the dress code.  Prior to 2004 very strict dress codes were in place for both gentlemen and ladies.  The only colours that were permitted to be worn were green and white unless the archer was a member of a national squad, in which case they were expected to wear the squad colours whilst shooting. After a number of concerns with an ageing membership and a lack of young blood being enticed into the sport, GNAS decided to allow each and every club in the United Kingdom to register a set of shooting colours that their members could wear in competition. The wearing of club colours is not compulsory and many members still prefer to wear the traditional green and white whereas club colours have become very popular with the younger members of GNAS. \n"}, {"text": "The principal round, shot by gentleman archers under GNAS rules, is known as the 'York Round'.  Lady archers shoot a round which takes its name from a city and county in the English/Welsh borders region that gave its name to a breed of cattle.  By what name is this round known?", "correct": "Hereford", "options": ["Salisbury", "Oxford", "Coventry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHereford.\n\n\tThe 'York' round consists of 12 dozen arrows, in total, 6 dozen being shot at 100 yards, 4 dozen at 80 yards and 2 dozen at 60 yards, all at a 122cm target face.  The Ladies 'Hereford' round consists of the same number of arrows shot at 80, 60 and 50 yards respectively.  It is not unusual for gentleman and ladies to shoot either round except in competition where the rules are applied rigidly. \n"}, {"text": "Whilst shooting, a spectator wanders onto the field.  Which word, from the following, must be called by anyone present as a warning to cease shooting immediately?", "correct": "Fast!", "options": ["Whoa!", "Yikes!", "Hold!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFast!.\n\n\tWhenever an event occurs that may prove dangerous to an archer, spectator or bystander, the word 'fast' is to be called as loudly as possible.  It can be called by any person present, not necessarily by the presiding judges and it may be called by any number of people, the more the better in fact.  On hearing 'fast' all archers are to cease shooting immediately, lower their bows, remove any nocked arrows from the bowstring and place all arrows back into the quiver. It is forbidden to resume shooting until the senior judge present has declared that it is safe and clear to continue.  Any archer who disobeys this rule will be asked to leave the field immediately and will not be permitted to shoot again that day.\n"}, {"text": "A traditional style of shooting in the United Kingdom, especially in England, consists of archers shooting at an upright flag or an angled target on the ground.  What is this type of shooting known as?", "correct": "Clout shooting", "options": ["Punch shooting", "Slap shooting", "Kick shooting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClout shooting.\n\n\tThere are two forms of clout shooting that take place in the United Kingdom.  The first, the GNAS Clout, consists of a 12\" square flag set into the ground at which the archers shoot.  Gentlemen shoot at a distance of 180 yards, Ladies shoot at 140 yards and junior archers shoot at distances of between 180 yards and 80 yards depending on their gender and age grouping. The flag, or clout, may be surrounded by scoring rings marked on the ground, but where this is not possible a thick, non-stretching rope or chain, over 12 feet in length and marked at 18\", 3, 6, 9 and 12 feet is attached to the flag. As this is walked around the flag, arrows are withdrawn from the ground and placed on the rope/chain where each archer will call his score.  The second form of clout shooting is the BL-BS (British Longbow Society) Clout.  A 30\" diameter target is laid on the ground and angled at 45\u00ba and the archers shoot at this.  As a general rule GNAS clouts are shot 'one-way', whereas BL-BS clouts are shot 'two-way'.  It is of the utmost importance that any archer who wishes to shoot the clout makes a declaration, prior to shooting, that they have received instruction in the art of clout shooting. \n"}, {"text": "Fixed at ninety feet above ground on the tower of the local church is a frame upon which are perched one cock, four hens and twenty-four chicks.  Which unusual, and exciting, style of fun-shoot are you about to take part in?", "correct": "Popinjay", "options": ["Archery darts", "Burntwood round", "Archery golf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPopinjay.\n\n\tNot as popular in the United Kingdom as it is on the continental mainland, Popinjay shooting is nevertheless a great fun way to spend a day shooting.  More usually the frame upon which the birds are perched, is erected atop a mast or on a high wall but in days gone by the local church steeple or tower was a popular venue. Archers shoot at the 'birds', usually from directly underneath, using a single arrow fitted with a rubber pile, around 1\" in diameter known as a blunt.  Here in the West Country our birds are often quite resplendent, their bodies being made from foam rubber highly decorated with natural feathers which we collect whilst out walking. There is a scoring system of 5 points for the cock, 3 points for a hen and one point for a chick.  The bird must be hit and fall to the ground to score.  More often than not though, scoring is simply ignored and the archers will just have a great fun day of shooting! \n"}, {"text": "What is usual, within the rules of the GNAS, with regard to shooting with the longbow?", "correct": "Two way shooting is permitted", "options": ["Only archers over the age of 50 shoot", "Tudor period costume is compulsory", "Ladies are not permitted to shoot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo way shooting is permitted.\n\n\tMany of the rounds as designated by the GNAS are shot by longbow archers and it is traditional that these rounds are shot 'two-way'.  Two rows of targets are set up facing each other at the distance specified.  The longbow archers will shoot from one row of targets, advance forward and score those arrows, then turn around and shoot back at the other row of targets.  This continues until the round is completed. \n"}]}
