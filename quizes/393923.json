This leads him to a small limestone cave populated by a colony of bats and, unfortunately, those bats carry a particularly virulent strain of rabies.  They scratch him deep enough to cause concern.\rAt the same time, Vic, Donna, and Tad live out their lives in the town of Castle Rock.  Vic and Donna seem to have a rocky relationship while Tad, only four years old, seems to be afraid of something hiding in his closet.  Vic has to head out of town for a week of work for his ad agency and things are unassuming...for now. \n"}, {"text": "What part in Donna's car likely needs to be replaced?", "correct": "Carburetor", "options": ["Engine", "Battery", "Muffler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarburetor.\n\n\tThe goings on in Castle Rock start to get a bit more interesting when Donna's lover, Steve Kemp (a local poet and tennis player) stops by unannounced and she ends their affair.  He decides to exact a bit of revenge, closing up shop and sending an anonymous note to Vic to let him in on his wife's horrible secret.  Vic is none the wiser in the meantime, and actually believes his and his wife's relationship to be more positive than usual when he's working on her car, finding that the needle valve in the carburetor isn't working properly.  He suggests they drive it up to Joe Camber's place, but they forget to do so.\rCharity Camber, meanwhile, contemplates heading to Connecticut to visit her sister and her nieces and nephews.  She plans to bring Brett, her son, but worries that Joe would never let something like that happen. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Charity buy to convince her husband to let her and Brett go to Connecticut?", "correct": "Chainfall", "options": ["Forklift", "Hydraulic jack", "Wood chipper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChainfall.\n\n\tCharity, as it seems, wins the local lottery and the $5,000 prize, so it comes down to a bit of bartering for her to be able to convince Joe that it's worth it for her and Brett to head to Connecticut for a little while.  To do this, she purchases a J\u00f6rgen chainfall, an item for the garage that Brett suggests, and she barters with their son's time to convince Joe to let them go.\rVic, meanwhile, plans to head out with Roger for twelve days before he gets the anonymous letter at his office.  That night, he and Donna have a serious conversation about her anxieties and the affair and while it appears that their marriage has taken a hit, it's not enough to break them apart completely.  Either way, he still plans to take his work trip, distracted as he may be.\rThe situation, meanwhile, gets worse for Cujo as the rabies sets in. \n"}, {"text": "Who is Cujo's first victim?", "correct": "Gary", "options": ["Joe", "Steve", "Evvie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGary.\n\n\tWith their last weekend past, Vic finally departs on his work trip with Roger, leaving Donna and Tad at home to fend for themselves for almost two weeks.  He promises to call every other night.  Donna, meanwhile, finally remembers her car issues and decides to bring it to Joe Camber's herself.\rCharity and Brett Camber, meanwhile, head to the Greyhound station and Brett neglects to tell anyone about Cujo, who he found out in the fields that morning, and the sickness that seems to have taken over him.  Cujo nearly attacked the boy, but recognized him at the last minute.  Brett and Charity decide to ask Joe to check on the dog that night when they call back home; they don't realize that Joe planned to go to Boston with his buddy, Gary.  Unfortunately, Gary becomes Cujo's first victim. \n"}, {"text": "Tad brings which of the following with him on the trip up to the Camber place?", "correct": "'The Monster Words'", "options": ["A box of animal crackers", "A matchbook", "His asthma inhaler"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Monster Words'.\n\n\tReady to head to Boston, Joe ends up stopping by Gary's house to find the carnage that unfolded when Cujo stopped by.  After finding Gary's body inside, he goes to call the police but, in the heat of the moment, he's found by Cujo and killed as well.  Charity and Brett, meanwhile, make it to Connecticut with little hassle.\rDonna decides to drop the Pinto off at the Camber house and leaves a note on the scratchpad in the kitchen, but she intends to go it alone until Tad, making a fuss, begs to come along, being too afraid to let local girl Debbie babysit him with the monster in his closet.  He brings his dad's 'Monster Words' with them, feeling like he should pocket them before he goes.  They arrive at the Camber property though they clearly aren't there, and the Pinto breaks down once and for all in front of the barn.  That's when Cujo emerges, trapping Donna and Tad inside the vehicle. \n"}, {"text": "Brett Cambers, as it seems, suffers from which of these?", "correct": "Somnambulism", "options": ["Narcolepsy", "Forgetfulness", "Asthma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomnambulism.\n\n\tDonna and Tad spend most of an evening in front of the barn at the Camber household, fearing the obviously rabid dog in front of them.  The Pinto is still unable to move, and Donna tries so hard to get it to start that she realizes the battery is dying.  She honks the horn a number of times, but they're too isolated to do anything about it.  She remembers that the Cambers had a package in their mailbox and hopes that, at the very least, the mailman will come by to check in on the house, if not someone else.\rThe phone rings inside the Camber house at one point, and it's Brett, calling his father to make sure he's taking care of Cujo.  He doesn't know his father is dead.  That night, Charity watches as her son sleepwalks for the first time in several years, heading to the kitchen and pretending to feed Cujo in the night.\rVic, meanwhile, convinces Roger that they need to perform a daylight burial of the Sharp Cereal Professor, the mascot so clearly slighted by their ad campaign issues.  He is, of course, occupied by this work. \n"}, {"text": "Does the mailman drop off the Cambers' mail while Donna and Tad are trapped on the property?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tDonna and Tad spend the Monday night in the Pinto anticipating that the mailman will arrive on Tuesday morning and put an end to their nightmare in some way.  Unfortunately, George Meara, the mailman for the area, isn't slated to visit the Camber house since Joe called in and canceled the mail for a couple of days before he was expected to leave.  So the two spend the rest of Tuesday in the car, fighting the horrible summer heat and eating what little food they packed for the ride.\rSteve Kemp, meanwhile, decides to return to Castle Rock to ensure his message got through to the Trentons.  He breaks into their house, smashes their furniture and belongings, and wipes out the message on Donna's scratchpad before leaving again.\rIn Connecticut, Charity decides that, in order to ease Brett's worries about Cujo, she'll call the neighbours to check in. \n"}, {"text": "Who calls the police regarding Donna and Tad?", "correct": "Victor", "options": ["Steve", "Roger", "George"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictor.\n\n\tThe second night falls upon the Camber household and Donna, fearing her increasing weakness, decides to open the car door while Tad is asleep and make a dash for the house when she feels that the coast is clear.  It's not though; Cujo, hiding on the ground in front of the car, waits to attack and leaps at her when she gets far enough from her door.  She tries to get back into the car when the dog lunges for her and she does succeed to an extent, but she gets bitten in the stomach and leg before she can get the door closed.\rIn Connecticut, Charity calls the neighbours, Alva and Bessie Thompson, but gets no real answer from them about whether or not Joe is around and feeding Cujo.  She tells Brett they'll call a different neighbour in the morning.\rVic, still out of town, begins to worry when he calls home several times to no answer.  On Roger's convincing, he decides to call the police back home so that they can check in on the house. \n"}, {"text": "Donna and Tad are plagued with which of these additional factors while trapped in their car?", "correct": "Intense heat", "options": ["Bugs", "Constant flooding", "Carbon monoxide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIntense heat.\n\n\tDeputy Roscoe Fisher heads to the Trenton household on Wednesday to find that the place has been vandalized and when he calls it in, Sheriff Bannerman manages to get into contact with Vic about the situation.  This results in a late night drive for Vic; he heads back to Maine while Roger proceeds to the meeting the next day.  Ultimately, Roger and Vic are kept on with the Sharp Cereal deal for another two years.\rCharity finally gets a hold of Alva Thompson who, though he agrees to check in on Cujo, never gets around to solving any problems due to the overwhelming summer heat (and an air conditioner problem that kills dozens of his chickens).\rIn Maine, Detective Masen takes over the case and, when Vic returns to Castle Rock, explains that there are a number of leads including, fortunately, the missing Pinto which Vic explains could be at the Camber place.  Sheriff Bannerman heads up to the Camber place alone to check on the thread and, of course, comes face to face with Cujo.  It doesn't end well for the Sheriff. \n"}, {"text": "Donna ultimately takes down Cujo with which of these implements?", "correct": "Baseball bat", "options": ["High-heeled shoe", "Gun", "Tire iron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaseball bat.\n\n\tTaking the opportunity when Cujo is dealing with Sheriff Bannerman, she places Tad in the back seat of the car and makes a run for the baseball bat in the grass nearby.  Cujo, noticing, comes in for the attack but Donna takes a few swings and gets the upper hand in the fight, ultimately beating Cujo down until the baseball bat breaks.  She finally kills the rabid beast before Vic pulls up in his car to find the horrible scene.  Vic goes to help Tad from the car but finds that the boy has died.\rShortly after, in Connecticut, Charity receives word that Joe has been killed by Cujo.\r In the months that follow, Donna recovers from the event in question, receiving rabies shots for several weeks until deemed cured.  She and Vic remain together, though they have to remove Tad's belongings from the house to cope.  Charity and Brett remain in Castle Rock.  Eventually, Brett gets a new dog.\r Cujo's ashes are disposed of.  Although in the end he did bad things against his will, he was always a good dog.  No one ever found the cave that Cujo stumbled upon. \n"}]}
