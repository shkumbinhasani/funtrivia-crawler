{"id": "383507", "name": "\"My Roanoke Nightmare\" (Chapter 1) Quiz / Test | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Roanoke"], "questions": [{"text": "What state did Matt and Shelby live in before moving to North Carolina?", "correct": "California", "options": ["New York", "Florida", "Massachusetts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalifornia.\n\n\tAn episode of 'My Roanoke Nightmare' airs and, on it, various people outline their true stories about their involvement with the mysterious goings-on of Roanoke.  Shelby and Matt discuss their happy lives together, remembering when they lived in Los Angeles and celebrated their good fortunes together.  Unfortunately, they were approached by a gang that night and, in a rite of initiation, one punched Matt in the face, sending him to the emergency room for surgery. While Matt showed signs of improvement soon after arriving in the ER, Shelby miscarried their baby.  They left Los Angeles and headed east where Matt grew up.  They went to North Carolina. \n"}, {"text": "How did Shelby and Matt come into owning their North Carolina house?", "correct": "In an auction", "options": ["It was inherited", "They bought it from a realtor", "They won it in a game show"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn an auction.\n\n\tDeciding they weren't city people was easy for Shelby and Matt; soon after reaching North Carolina they took to the environment.  One day, however, walking into the woods for a picnic, they found themselves in front of a beautiful, old farmhouse-- three bedrooms; two storeys; a basement-- built in 1792.  It was for sale, and they decided it was meant to be.  As much as they couldn't seem to afford it, it seemed, when they stayed around for a local auction they found that the property, including the ten acres of forest around the building, was going for as low as $20,000.  Despite locals claiming it was a bad purchase, they walked away with a new house for $40,000-- most of their savings. Matt knew he was home; Shelby felt some form of danger.  Neither knew what was watching them from the woods. \n"}, {"text": "During a storm, Shelby believed she saw which of these falling from the sky?", "correct": "Human teeth", "options": ["Frogs", "Blood", "Bones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHuman teeth.\n\n\tSoon after moving into their new house, Shelby and Matt were bothered by horrible noises in the night.  Matt went outside to investigate and found a mess...and something in the mists.  He went back to bed believing it to be nothing but the local hillbillies, attempting to force them out due to their prejudices.\rOne day, Shelby was surprised to find, during a storm, that something was striking the windows quite hard.  It seemed like hail, but when she went outside to look, it was human teeth.  When Matt returned home, there was no evidence of any such occurrence. \n"}, {"text": "What was Matt's profession?", "correct": "Travelling salesman", "options": ["Lawyer", "Doctor", "Musician"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTravelling salesman.\n\n\tMatt had to head out to Raleigh for work, hoping to secure a new contract as a travelling salesman.  Shelby was okay with this, needing alone time to realign herself.  One windy night, while making dinner for herself, she was spooked by slamming window covers, but the real fright came when two female figures walked across the hall of her own house in front of her.  She headed into the room the two women entered and turned on the lights, but found no one inside.  She seemed to be alone. \n"}, {"text": "Shelby was attacked by unknown assailants in which of these?", "correct": "The hot tub", "options": ["The pantry", "The bathroom", "The cellar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe hot tub.\n\n\tThinking the sight of the women to be a bit of a hallucination, Shelby took a glass of wine and went out to the hot tub to relax.  There, floating alone in the circular tub, she closed her eyes moments before a hand grabbed her face and pushed her under the water.  As she struggled, more hands reached into the tub in the attack, keeping her down.\rShelby called Matt and he made it home in an hour (despite the trip to Raleigh taking two hours) to find a local cop investigating.  Shelby claimed to have been assaulted by people in old costumes with pitchforks and torches, but there was no sign of anybody being around the property.  When she emerged from the water, no one was around the hot tub.  It was then that Shelby realized she didn't want to live in the house, but she didn't tell her husband. \n"}, {"text": "Of what relation is Lee to Matt?", "correct": "Sister", "options": ["Mother", "Brother", "Father"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSister.\n\n\tThat night, Matt woke up to hear the sounds of a squealing pig outside.  Grabbing a fire poker, he headed out to investigate only to find a dead, bloodied pig laying on the front stoop.  He buried the pig without telling Shelby the following morning, but believed it came from the hillbillies.  The next day, he installed a security camera system linked to his phone and headed back to Raleigh, but not before asking his sister, Lee, to stay with Shelby for the duration of the trip. Lee, a former detective, was shot while on the job in a crack den and has, since, become addicted to pain medication. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Lee's daughter?", "correct": "Flora", "options": ["Julia", "Angela", "Bella"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlora.\n\n\tLee was a good cop, dedicated to the job, but was cut from the force when, after a high-speed chase with a serial rapist, a colleague searched her squad vehicle to find an empty bottle of pain medication on the passenger seat.  Shortly after that, Lee's husband asked for a divorce and full custody of their young daughter, Flora.\rIt was the evening Lee arrived, and while making dinner, Shelby heard a noise in the hall.  She noticed the knife she put down had disappeared upon her return and she found it stabbed into her meat on the stove.  She believed it to be Lee.\rDuring a quick conversation, Lee asked Shelby not to drink during her stay, considering her issues with sobriety.  In return she would give protection, especially since she was still carrying a gun. \n"}, {"text": "What did Shelby and Lee find in the basement of the house after their argument?", "correct": "A television", "options": ["A painting", "A zombie", "A pig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA television.\n\n\tOn her night at the house, Lee awakened to loud noises and her bedroom door opening.  She believed it to be Shelby but was surprised when a wine bottle rolled across the door through the darkness.  She was angered by this and went to confront her sister-in-law, sparking an argument.  At the same time, Matt, still in Raleigh, received an alert from his security app and checked it to find people with torches advancing onto his property. Lee stopped the argument when she heard the front door open and, heading into the hall, she followed her suspicions to a noise in the basement.  Both went down, and when they did, they found a television on, playing a home movie. \n"}, {"text": "The recording found by Shelby and Lee depicted a man with a wolf's head.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe home movie depicted something horrifying; it was something with the head of a pig, but on two legs.  When the television cut out, so did the power.  Something slammed the door to the basement, and they were trapped in the dark as figures moved by the windows.  In Raleigh, Matt headed out, hoping to make it home as soon as possible to save his family. Finding a flashlight, Shelby and Lee decided to head upstairs into the house and, when they did, they found rudimentary figurines made of sticks and twine strung up throughout the main hall and stairwell.  Matt returned home and worried about the vandalism (terrorism in his opinion) and decried the fakery behind the video tape before he and Lee both fought to convince Shelby that they couldn't leave; they couldn't let people run them out of their home. \n"}, {"text": "What did Shelby hit with her car?", "correct": "A woman", "options": ["A deer", "A dog", "Something unknown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA woman.\n\n\tMatt, convinced that they needed to stay in the house, didn't do anything to help soothe Shelby's fears, so she ended up hopping into their car and driving away from the property then and there.  Unfortunately, in her flight from the house, she looked down to answer her phone and collided with a woman standing in the middle of the road. Doing the right thing, she stopped the car and got out with a flashlight to check on the person but, to her shock, they ended up simply standing up and walking into the misty woods.  She followed fifty feet into the forest but lost the victim...before getting lost herself. That's when she stumbled on the clearing...a meadow topped by a web of hanging stick figurines.  She started to run for it, but tripped on a branch and there, sprawled on the ground, is when she felt the very woods breathing beneath her.  Getting up and running once again, she emerged in a clearing surrounded by people holding torches.  A man emerged from the woods behind her...his head partly cut off...and she screamed. \n"}]}
