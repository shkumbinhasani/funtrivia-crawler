The Arabs are said to have received the concept of zero via Persia, via India.  The Mayans also independently developed the concept of zero in their mathematical system. \n"}, {"text": "The Romans used 'cranes' for building purposes.  ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tCranes were worked by treadmills employing human labor, and functioned with a system of pulleys.

Which month was the first on this less than accurate early calendar?  ", "correct": "Martius", "options": ["Januarius", "Junius", "Februarius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartius.\n\n\tMartius later became 'March' in the Julian calendar.  The months in order for the pre-Julian calendar were:  Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quinctilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, December, Januarius and Februarius.  During the per-Julian calendar period, the remaining days of the year (61 in all!) were unnamed, and were simply called 'intercalans'.  \r The later 355 day calendar with January (Iannarils) and February (Februarias) was established during the reign of Numa Pompilius.  The remaining days were called 'Intercalans' or 'Mercedonius'.  The 355 day calendar was still quite complicated, and during the rule of Julius Caesar the calendar that we label Julian was developed by Sosigenes, and included 365 and occasional leap years. \n"}]}
