While Goku brings a six-foot-long fish back home for dinner, she collides with it in her car, prompting their first greetings.  Bulma, it turns out, is searching for the seven Dragon Balls to call upon the Eternal Dragon and be granted a single wish.  She already has two, and when she finds Goku she discovers that he has one in his possession, having been given it by his now-deceased grandfather.  Discovering Goku's powers and taking advantage of his naivety, she convinces him to come along with her to hunt down the remaining four Dragon Balls...and off they go.\r Of course it's only a short amount of time before they run into a dinosaur...\r Elsewhere, Emperor Pilaf seeks the Dragon Balls in a quest to rule the world.  He comes across one, but needs six more to complete his objective. \n"}, {"text": "Goku and Bulma are met by a giant turtle.  Where do they need to take him?", "correct": "The sea", "options": ["The top of the nearest mountain", "To a zoo", "To the finish line"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe sea.\n\n\tAfter setting up camp (in a Dyno-Camp-created house), Goku and Bulma have a bit of time to relax and get to know one another, showing the latter that there's more to her new travel companion than meets the eye.  Heading out to catch a real meal, Goku inadvertently stumbles across Emperor Pilaf's lackeys looking for a Dragon Ball in a dangerous location.  They're forced to return without any new developments while Pilaf continues to tout around.\r The next day, Goku finds a lost tortoise while breaking rocks for his morning work-out and, discovering that the creature got lost on his way to the sea (after getting into a race with a hare and taking a wrong turn) decides to help him out by taking him home, one hundred miles away.

Although his first decision is to offer up his magic carpet, it turns out it's at the cleaners.  Instead, he hands over his Nimbus Cloud, a spectral cloud that allows anyone who is good and pure of heart to ride it.  As it turns out, Goku is the only one of them who can hop on.  Bulma also asks for a gift and, not knowing its value, he gives her the three-star Dragon Ball around his neck. Coincidentally, Pilaf and his henchmen are searching Master Roshi's house for the Dragon Ball at the same time. Too little, too late. \n"}, {"text": "What is Oolong's true form?", "correct": "Pig", "options": ["Boy", "Dragon", "Cat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPig.\n\n\tArriving at a village home to one of the Dragon Balls, Goku and Bulma come across a terrible shape-shifting creature by the name of Oolong who has been taking young girls and making them into his wives.  Disguising Goku as one of the young girls in town, they plot to fool Oolong...and succeed using the Nimbus Cloud.\r Bulma and Goku bring Oolong along with them to the Diablo Desert, feeling that they can use his powers to their advantage.  Instead he tries to steal Bulma's Dyno-Capsules when their boat breaks down and, later, attempts to steal the Dragon Balls from them for his own nefarious wishes. \n"}, {"text": "In the Diablo Desert, Goku and Bulma come across the Desert Bandit known by what name?", "correct": "Yamcha", "options": ["Chi Chi", "Puar", "Roshi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYamcha.\n\n\tHeading into the Diablo Desert, the trio comes across Yamcha, the Desert Bandit, who fights Goku when the group refuses to give up their Dyno-Capsules.  When Goku reveals his Power Pole in a fight, knowing it was originally Gohan's, he uses his Wolf's Fang Fist attack to kill the boy but, inadvertently, gets distracted by Bulma and leaves, too shy to remain.\r Yamcha and Puar decide to take the Dragon Balls so that the former can wish to be less afraid around women.  As such they end up following from just far enough behind not to be noticed...until they strike...and retreat...repeatedly...in an attempt to let the others find the Dragon Balls first. \n"}, {"text": "Who teaches Goku the Kamehame-Ha?", "correct": "Master Roshi", "options": ["Emperor Pilaf", "The Ox King", "Krillin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaster Roshi.\n\n\tGoku, Bulma, and Oolong end up reaching Fire Mountain on the other side of the Diablo Desert and discover that one of the Dragon Balls is in the Ox King's Castle on top (though it's guarded by a wall of flames).  What they discover is that the mountain was set ablaze, and they also find that the King's daughter was sent to visit Master Roshi and retrieve the Bansho Fan, a magic device able to put it out. Goku is sent to find her, and the two end up going together to discover that Master Roshi has actually thrown out the fan.  To make things right Roshi instead heads back with them to put it out with his Kamehame-Ha, accidentally destroying the mountain in the process. Goku ends up learning the move shortly after (and is offered a place to train with Master Roshi) and Bulma locates the Dragon Ball in the wake of the mountain's razing, leaving them with one last one to find. \n"}, {"text": "The group visits a small town to fill the gas in their car, and Bulma wears an accessory that frightens the local townpeople.

Arriving in a town on their way to the seventh Dragon Ball Bulma accidentally gets herself noticed by locals for wearing black rabbit ears, much like the local gang headed by a rabbit named Master Carrot (who has the ability to turn people into carrots by touching them).  Helped by Yamcha and Puar, Goku is able to defeat the enemies with his Power Pole and send them to the moon. Yamcha and Puar come to the rescue yet again en route to Emperor Pilaf's Castle after the Bulma's Dragon Balls and Dyno-Capsules are stolen. \n"}, {"text": "Who ultimately comes into possession of all seven of the Dragon Balls?", "correct": "Emperor Pilaf", "options": ["Goku", "Bulma", "Yamcha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmperor Pilaf.\n\n\tWhen Goku, Bulma, and Oolong finally unite with Yamcha and Puar, they reach Emperor Pilaf's Castle and then get trapped in its dungeons and gassed, allowing Emperor Pilaf to steal the final Dragon Ball from Goku's possession and, inadvertently, send them into a complicated human pinball game.  This final Dragon Ball is all Pilaf needs to complete the ritual, and with that he's able to summon the dragon Shenron, just as Goku is able to use Kamehame-Ha to help them escape their prison.  But what can be done? \n"}, {"text": "Which of these ends up being the wish granted by Shenron the Dragon when the Dragon Balls are used?", "correct": "Oolong gets a pair of underwear", "options": ["Emperor Pilaf is crowned Supreme Ruler of the World", "Bulma gets a boyfriend", "Goku gets his grandfather back"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOolong gets a pair of underwear.\n\n\tPuar and Oolong escape the prison first, transforming into bats to stop Emperor Pilaf from starting the ritual.  It is, however, too late, and Shenron descends from the skies to fulfill one wish.  Although Pilaf plans to wish for world domination, Oolong manages to intercept the wish, asking for a pair of underwear. The resulting wish scatters the Dragon Balls across the world, leaving them inert for a year and sending Shenron away.  Pilaf, angered by this and the escape of his prisoners, sends his lackeys and the guard dogs after the others and traps them in a great glass room, set to be set ablaze by the sun by morning. \n"}, {"text": "Goku transforms into a giant ape when which of these happens?", "correct": "He stares at the moon", "options": ["He's dropped into water", "His tail is pulled", "He says the magic words"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe stares at the moon.\n\n\tTrapped and unable to escape Pilaf's sun chamber, Puar notes that a full moon is outside and Goku says that his grandfather used to tell him of a horrible creature that would come out during the full moon, so he was never to look at it.  In fact, Gohan was killed by the creature.  When Goku looks at the moon this time though, he transforms into a giant ape, breaking everyone out of their prison but going rampant and destroying the entire castle.  Transforming Puar into a pair of scissors, the only way to stop Goku, Yamcha finds, is to cut off his tail, the source of the power.  He's successful in doing so, saving them all.\r In the end, Goku heads out to train with Master Roshi while the others, recognizing their compatibility, head to the West City.  In a year, he'll be able to seek out his grandfather's Dragon Ball. \n"}]}
