But over the years, some repressive governments -- notably Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia -- have forced winners to say \"NO\" to the Nobel. What Russian writer, author of \"Doctor Zhivago\" among other works, was forced by his government to decline the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature?", "correct": "Boris Pasternak", "options": ["Joseph Brodsky", "Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn", "Mikhail Sholokhov"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoris Pasternak.\n\n\tPasternak (1890-1960), a Moscow native, began his creative career as a composer of classical music, but switched to poetry early on. \"Doctor Zhivago\" was his first and only prose novel. He initially accepted the 1958 Nobel prize in a telegram reading \"Immensely thankful, touched, proud, astonished, abashed,\" -- but four days later he rejected it in another telegram, citing \"the meaning this award has been given in the society to which I belong.\" There is no doubt that his change of heart was inspired by Soviet authorities.\r The other three listed names are all Russian winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Joseph Brodsky (1987) had resided in the United States for 15 years at the time he received his prize; he had been exiled from the USSR for \"social parasitism.\" Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1970) wrote extensively about life in the gulags, and was exiled from the Soviet Union a few years after receiving the Nobel prize. Mikhail Sholokhov (1965) wrote several historical epics about the Don region of Russia; his writings displayed the \"correct\" politics (he was a member of the Communist Party), and so he did not suffer the repercussions that so many other Russian writers did.\r The only other twentieth-century government to force its citizens to decline the Nobel Prize was Nazi Germany, which forced three winners (Richard Kuhn, Chemistry 1938; Adolf Butenandt, Chemistry 1939; Gerhard Domagk, Medicine 1939) to forgo the honor. \n"}, {"text": "Two comic strip characters found NO respite when facing off against the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons, created in a Frankenstein-style snowman-building experiment gone horribly awry. The strips from this storyline were part of a newspaper comic that ran for ten years featuring what protagonists?", "correct": "A six-year-old boy and his stuffed tiger in \"Calvin and Hobbes\"", "options": ["Two young women, roommates in \"Apartment 3-G\"", "An anthropomorphic pig and a wiener dog in \"Liberty Meadows\"", "A boy and his security blanket in \"Peanuts\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nA six-year-old boy and his stuffed tiger in \"Calvin and Hobbes\".\n\n\t\"Calvin and Hobbes,\" an incredibly popular strip written and drawn by Bill Watterson, was syndicated in newspapers from 1985-1995. In this storyline, the irrepressible Calvin brings a snowman to life with an appeal to the snow gods, but trouble arises when the snow goon turns out to be both evil and capable of building other snow goons to help him in his wicked plans. The snow goons are finally defeated when Calvin and Hobbes sneak out of the house at midnight to freeze them in place with water from the hose.\r This storyline, with others, was published in the collection \"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons.\" A comprehensive, three-volume hardbound collection, \"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,\" was released just in time for Christmas in 2005. \n"}, {"text": "People in trouble with the law will often plead \"NOlo contendere\", or \"NO contest\": they do not admit (or deny) committing the crime, but they accept punishment for it. One of the most famous people to make this plea was Richard Nixon's first vice president, in answer to the charges of tax evasion which had forced his resignation. Who was this man, who summed up the spirit of \"nolo contendere\" as \"I didn't do it, and I'll never do it again\"?", "correct": "Spiro T. Agnew", "options": ["Nelson A. Rockefeller", "Gerald R. Ford", "John N. Garner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpiro T. Agnew\n\n\tAgnew, born Spiros Anagnostopoulos in 1918, rose incredibly quickly once he decided to turn his attention to politics from the law. In 1962, he ran for county executive of Baltimore County; only seven years after his first election, he resigned as governor of Maryland to take office as vice president of the United States. His quick embrace of civil rights helped him as he rose.\r Agnew's fall was just as sudden. An honest political official must say \"NO\" to bribes; after the 1972 election, accusations arose that Agnew had repeatedly said \"yes\" as governor of Maryland, to the tune of $29,500. In October 1973, Agnew resigned and pleaded \"nolo contendere\" to tax evasion charges, in a deal which spared him from a trial on the charges of bribery. For the rest of his life he held a grudge against Nixon, whom he believed had released the accusations to distract attention from the Watergate scandal. \n"}, {"text": "The history of women in academia is, sadly, filled with people saying \"NO.\" This brilliant mathematician had a four-year struggle before she was permitted to teach at the University of Gottingen; only fourteen years later, she lost her job again as Nazi racial laws came into effect. Who was this woman, who essentially founded the science of abstract algebra and changed the face of theoretical physics with her work on symmetries and conservation laws?", "correct": "Emmy Noether", "options": ["Hanna Neumann", "Ida Schottenfels", "Mary Weiss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmmy Noether.\n\n\tEmmy Noether, daughter of mathematician Max Noether, was not in the habit of taking \"no\" for an answer. When Erlangen, the university where her father taught, told her they could not accept women as students, she sat in on classes and worked on her own; when they finally admitted her in 1904, she earned her doctorate in only three years. In 1915, she sought a professorship at Gottingen, only to have some of the professors argue that it would be unfair to the country's soldiers to expect them to learn from a woman after their return home.  Her strongest backer, Professor David Hilbert, observed that he could not see how her gender could possibly be a factor: \"after all, the university senate is not a bathhouse.\" She was finally allowed to teach in 1919.\r As the Nazis solidified their power, Noether decided to flee Germany in 1933, and again her stubbornness paid off. Despite her incomparable contributions to mathematics and physics, only one American university -- the women's college Bryn Mawr -- was willing to offer her the teaching job she needed to obtain a visa. She taught there for two years before dying of an illness in 1935. \n"}, {"text": "In a parliamentary system, a successful motion of NO confidence can be used to bring down a government, either by its resignation or by a new general election. Now enshrined in the conventions or constitutions of over a dozen countries, this principle is nevertheless rather young. Who was the first Prime Minister brought down by a vote of no confidence?", "correct": "Frederick, Lord North (United Kingdom)", "options": ["Stanley Baldwin (United Kingdom)", "James Scullin (Australia)", "Arthur Meighen (Canada)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrederick, Lord North (United Kingdom).\n\n\tIn 1782, after American rebels and the French navy defeated the British army in the Battle of Yorktown, an angry Parliament voted that they \"can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers.\" Accordingly, Lord North (1732-1792) presented George III with his resignation, and a precedent was born.\r North had become Prime Minister in 1770 after a three-year term as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1774, in retaliation for the Boston Tea Party, his government introduced four punitive measures known in the American colonies as the \"Intolerable Acts.\" Ranging from the closing of Boston harbor to a requirement that colonists house British soldiers when needed, these acts did not dampen the revolutionary fervor. North's tenure ended when it became clear that the revolution would be successful. \n"}, {"text": "NOvocaine -- the trade name for procaine, a local anesthetic -- replaced cocaine around the turn of the last century and has in turn been largely replaced by lidocaine. In the meantime, though, its use has become virtually synonymous with what branch of medicine?", "correct": "Dentistry", "options": ["Rheumatology", "Cardiology", "Orthopedics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDentistry.\n\n\tNovocaine, which belongs to the amino ester group, was first synthesized in 1905 by Alfred Einhorn. It was a great improvement over cocaine, but its faults (both wearing off too quickly and causing an allergic reaction in a small number of patients) eventually took it out of the anesthetic business. Its place in popular culture is secure, though.In 2001, a dark comedy centered on a lying dentist was called \"Novocaine\"; Steve Martin and Helena Bonham Carter starred. The drug's trade name also turns up in the lyrics or titles of a surprising number of pop songs, by artists from Green Day to Weird Al Yankovic. \n"}, {"text": "NOh is an ancient form of opera. With a bare stage and only a few  characters (often wearing masks), emphasis is placed on the body language of the actors and the poetry of the chanted lyrics. From what land does this theatrical tradition come?", "correct": "Japan", "options": ["Korea", "Norway", "Peru"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\tNoh grew out of long folk traditions, combining ritual dancing with majestic songs and poetry. The man widely recognized as its founder, Zeami Motokiyo (1363-1443), had formed a close childhood friendship with the shogun, and that powerful patronage gave the art both the ambition and the space to grow. Today, five troupes choose from among about 250 plays, though at the height of Noh there were over a thousand; a typical performance lasts between half an hour and two hours. \n"}, {"text": "NOva Scotia, Canada's second-smallest province, looked very attractive to early explorers. In fact, it was the site of the very first permanent western-hemisphere European settlement north of Florida, which is unfortunately too long a slogan for the license plates. Where was this settlement, and who settled it?", "correct": "Port Royal (French)", "options": ["Vinland (Danish)", "Port Royal (English)", "Cape Breton (French)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPort Royal (French).\n\n\tIn 1605, a small French expedition established a town at Port Royal, off the Bay of Fundy; it would become the capital of the French colony Acadia. The land was almost immediately disputed by the English, and the next hundred and forty years must have been very confusing: the peninsula of Nova Scotia changed hands five times, through war and through treaties. Port Royal itself was repeatedly burned and resettled, until the 1755 expulsion of all 12,000 Acadians settled the question decisively and cruelly.\r Nova Scotian license plates have carried the motto \"Canada's Ocean Playground\" from 1972 onward. \n"}, {"text": "In a heartbreaking novel by Daniel Keyes, a mentally retarded man is given an experimental treatment that makes him a genius -- but when his new mental powers begin to fade, he is told that there is NO way he can keep them. What is the name of this book, the basis of the 1968 movie \"Charly\"?", "correct": "Flowers for Algernon", "options": ["Death Be Not Proud", "No Exit", "No Shortcuts to the Top"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlowers for Algernon.\n\n\tBefore operating on Charly, his doctors had tried the procedure on a mouse named Algernon, whose rising intelligence they measured by the time he took to solve mazes. Charly's story is told through \"progress reports,\" journal entries for the benefit of the research study. As the treatment begins to work, we can see the results in the reports, as he gradually masters spelling and grammar and as his arguments grow more sophisticated. Algernon, his predecessor, is always on his mind.\r Short, powerful, and beautifully written, \"Flowers for Algernon\" is a favorite of high school English classes. Keyes won a Hugo award for the 1959 short story; the novel-length expansion, published in 1966, won him a Nebula. Cliff Robertson, star of the movie adaptation \"Charly,\" earned an Academy Award for Best Actor for his work. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. NO was the first of the James Bond movie villains, facing off against Agent 007 in the 1962 movie of the same name. Who played the dashing, dapper British spy in this outing?", "correct": "Sean Connery", "options": ["Barry Nelson", "Roger Moore", "George Lazenby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Connery.\n\n\tThe wildly successful James Bond began his existence as a character in Ian Fleming's novels, written between 1952 and his death in 1964. Although he appeared in a 1954 television production (\"Casino Royale,\" in which Barry Nelson starred), most consider \"Dr. No\" to be his first official live-action adventure. Sean Connery would go on to star in another five official films; he was eventually replaced by George Lazenby, followed by Roger Moore, followed by Timothy Dalton, followed by Pierce Brosnan, followed by Dan Craig ... it seems that Bond is a role an actor just can't say NO to.\r Dr. Julius No, played by Joseph Wiseman, will always have a place in the hearts of Bond enthusiasts. A brilliant scientist with prosthetic metal hands, he turned to a life of crime after both the USA and the USSR declined to offer him a job. Sometimes saying NO comes at a cost! \n"}]}
