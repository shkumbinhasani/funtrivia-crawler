Koufax was Jewish, and opening day conflicted with Yom Kippur.  Don Drysdale had to start the series, and the mix-up was blamed for throwing the pitching rotation out of kilter.  The Dodgers were skunked by the Orioles.  Sandy was inducted into the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibilty in 1972. \n"}]}
