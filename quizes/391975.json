Near the beginning of the film, Mr. Perlman tests Oliver's knowledge by deliberately making an etymological mistake - Oliver passes the test with flying colours. At the time that the film is set, Elio is 17 and Oliver is 24. \n"}, {"text": "Elio doesn't particularly like Oliver when he arrives at the house. Which of the following is one of the main reasons for this?", "correct": "Elio has to give up his bedroom to Oliver.", "options": ["Elio's parents ask him to make Oliver breakfast.", "Oliver likes to play loud techno music in the garden.", "Oliver borrows Elio's bike and punctures a tyre."], "explanation": "\n\n\nElio has to give up his bedroom to Oliver.\n\n\tElio is most certainly not smitten when Oliver first arrives at the house.

During a break in the game, Oliver comes over to get some water, and massages Elio's shoulders. Both characters are topless, and it is the first physical contact between the two of them. \n"}, {"text": "In one of the most memorable scenes of the film, Elio watches Oliver dancing enthusiastically at a local disco before he joins him on the dance floor. What song is playing during this scene?", "correct": "'Love My Way' by The Psychedelic Furs", "options": ["'I Love Rock 'n Roll' by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts", "'Physical' by Olivia Newton-John", "'Eye of the Tiger' by Survivor"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Love My Way' by The Psychedelic Furs.\n\n\tThe scene starts with a shot of Oliver's shoes as he dances to the music, before cutting to a wider shot that shows him completely losing himself on the dance floor. Elio is initially smoking a cigarette and watching the disco, but decides to get up himself after watching Oliver. \r The three incorrect answers were the top three songs from Billboard Hot 100 end of year chart in 1982 (the year 'Love My Way' was released).

Despite the fact that their relationship is growing, Oliver tries to discourage Elio from letting it go any further. \n"}, {"text": "As their relationship develops, Elio and Oliver become increasingly intimate.

After they have slept together, Elio and Oliver spend more and more time together. Later in the film they go on a three-day trip to the city of Bergamo, encouraged by Elio's parents. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the film, Elio and Oliver establish a stable long-term relationship.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tUnfortunately for both Elio and Oliver, Oliver has to return to the United States to complete his studies.
