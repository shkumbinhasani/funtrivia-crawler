{"id": "390350", "name": "\"The Mind Flayer\" Multiple Choice Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stranger Things"], "questions": [{"text": "Will is sedated only after he fails to recognize who of these?", "correct": "His mother", "options": ["Bob", "Hopper", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis mother.\n\n\tHopper watches as the first demogorgon pulls itself out of the makeshift elevator shaft and begins bashing into the polycarbonate windows separating the creature from the lab techs.  Soon, several of them emerge behind and start smashing their way in, catching an elevator with some of the lab techs and eating them on the way up.\rUp in Will's recovery room, the others hear the gunshots.  Mike tells Joyce and Bob that they need to put Will to sleep since he's a spy, but Will screams that his friend is lying.  Joyce is only able to do what's necessary when Will has to think before he can recognize her as his mother.  She apologizes as she jabs him with the sedative.\rHopper arrives with Dr. Owens soon after.  They have to escape somehow.  Locking themselves in a security room, they hide as the power in the labs shuts off. \n"}, {"text": "Who is forced to go out looking for Max when she's discovered missing from her room?", "correct": "Billy", "options": ["Her mother", "Her stepfather", "Steve"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly.\n\n\tMax's mother and stepfather return home to find Max missing and her bedroom window open.  When they check in on Billy, he's getting ready for a date.  Billy claims that he doesn't need to babysit Max-- she's 13-- and he can't look for her because he's getting ready for a date.  It's not an answer his father wants to hear, so he gets slapped in the face and given a lesson about respect.  Billy is told that he will cancel his date and go find his step-sister.\rMax is still out with Dustin, Lucas, and Steve, heading back down the train tracks.  When Dustin reveals that Dart ate his cat, Lucas argues that he broke the rule of law and put the party in danger.  Dustin rebuts with the fact that Lucas told Max the whole story.  Their argument comes to an end when Steve hears something in the woods. \n"}, {"text": "The Hawkins Lab computers are programmed in which language?", "correct": "BASIC", "options": ["C++", "PERL", "Java"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBASIC.\n\n\tSteve and the kids take their flashlights into the woods and find themselves overlooking the woods from a cliffside.  Using his binoculars, Lucas spies the lab in the distance with its lights out.\rInside, Dr. Owens tells the others that in the event of a power outage, the building's doors go into fail-safe lockdown, meaning there's no way out unless someone resets the breakers in the basement, then manually resets the computers.  Hopper volunteers to go, but Bob says that he'll need to go along since he knows the computers' programming scheme (in BASIC).  The two of them arm themselves out in the hallway before Bob heads out. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Bob use to distract the demogorgons in the lab?", "correct": "Sprinklers", "options": ["Dead bodies", "Fire alarm", "Automatic doors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSprinklers.\n\n\tJonathan and Nancy end up making it to the Hawkins Lab to find the lights out and the guards missing.  Trying the gate, they find there's no way in.  Nancy hears something in the woods and the two go to check it out only to find Steve and the kids.  No one is really sure what's going on, but a noise from inside the lab makes it a bit more apparent.\rIn the basement of the lab, Bob searches around until he finds what appears to be the right hallway.  He finds the main power breakers and flips them all back on.\rOutside, the others see the power come back on, but the gate outside still won't work...at least not until Bob opens all of the locks in the compound.  Before he leaves, he turns on a sprinkler system to lure away the demogorgons on his trail, but he forgets the gun he brought on the table. \n"}, {"text": "Does Bob make it out of the Hawkins lab?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tDr. Owens tells Hopper to take Joyce and the kids and leave while he stays behind to watch for any surprises.  They get out, but Joyce decides to satay back and wait for Bob.  Bob is actually being guided out of the maze corridors by Owens who, fortunately, is able to get Bob into hiding spaces when need-be.  When Bob exits the closet though, he accidentally knocks over a broom, attracting one of the creatures and needing to break into a run.  He makes it to Joyce in the lobby, but one of the creatures leaps on him from the side.  They have no choice but to run.  \rOutside, Jonathan and Nancy pull up in their car and peal out as fast as possible.  Hopper gets the kids into his vehicle on the way. \n"}, {"text": "What, according to Dustin, is the goal of the 'Mind Flayer'?", "correct": "To enslave other races", "options": ["To consume", "To blot out the sun", "To gain infinite knowledge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo enslave other races.\n\n\tBack at the Byers household, Jonathan apologizes to Will's unconscious body on the couch while Hopper calls in the issue.  He tells the others that they will need to stay in the Byers house and wait for help before checking in on Joyce in her bedroom.\rWhile the others wait and worry, the kids mourn the loss of Bob who, as it turned out, founded Mr. Clarke's AV Club in school.  That's when Mike realizes, everything is kind of like Mr. Clarke discussed in class about hiveminds.  The shadow monster in the Upside-Down infected Will like a hivemind organism, and if they can take it down they can take down everything else.  That's when Dustin draws the parallels; it's like the Mind Flayer in 'Dungeons and Dragons', a creature that uses psionic powers to enslave races of other dimensions.  It wants to conquer.  Hopper can barely believe it.  He asks Dustin how to stop it and Dustin says you need to raise an army of undead since they have no brains.  It is a game, after all. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Hopper and Mike determine is a good place to interrogate Will?", "correct": "In a shed", "options": ["In the labs", "At the police station", "In the Upside-Down"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a shed.\n\n\tJoyce agrees with the boys despite Hopper's obvious reservations; she wants to kill the Mind Flayer.  That said, none of them know how to kill the thing.  Mike disagrees though, since Will knows the creature inside and out, and if he doesn't know where he is, then the creature won't either, and they can work with that.  Hopper and Mike head out to the shed on the Byers property and start clearing it out.\rNancy commends Steve for helping the kids, saying it was a really cool thing for him to do.  Dustin, meanwhile, apologizes to Lucas for everything about Dart and says that if Lucas wants Max to take his spot int he party, she can.  Inside the house, Mike tells Max that even though she knows the truth, she understands why they wouldn't want her in the party.\rSoon, everyone is pitching in to create Will's mock-interrogation room, certainly something befitting a spy, and they strap him in.  Once the interrogation room is set up, Hopper awakens Will which the scent of bleach, bringing him back to consciousness instantly. \n"}, {"text": "Who is not brought in to interrogate Will?", "correct": "Steve", "options": ["Jonathan", "Mike", "Joyce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve.\n\n\tInside the house, while everyone else waits for the results of the interrogation, Max asks Lucas if Will will send the demogorgons after them once he figures out where they are.  Lucas assures her he wouldn't find out.  If he can though, it's judgment day.\rOut in the shed, Joyce assures Will that they just want to talk to him, and Hopper shows him a picture of the shadow monster that he doesn't recognize.  He thrashes around yelling to be let go, but Joyce stays resolute.  She asks him what March 22nd is, saying it's his birthday when he can't answer.  When he was eight, she got him crayons and he let his imagination soar.  She was so proud of his drawings.  Jonathan asks him if he remembers the day their dad left, but the two of them built Castle Byers that night.  Mike asks if he remembers when they met; it was the first day of kindergarten.  They never stopped being friends. \n"}, {"text": "What word does Will tap out in morse code, indicating he's still present in his mind?", "correct": "HERE", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHERE.\n\n\tThe interrogation doesn't work the way they expect.  Will hears the others' stories, but insists that they should let him go, not responding with emotion like the rest of them.  Hopper, however, sees past the lack of response and notices Will tapping on his chair and, keeping that sequence in mind, he realizes the boy is tapping out the word 'HERE'.\rJonathan grabs his boombox and plays 'Should I Stay or Should I Go' for Will, bringing up a story about their love of music; Will brings back stories of their 'Dungeons of Dragons' campaigns; Joyce talks about his kind acts.  All during this, Hopper relays his morse code back to the others in the house and they're able to spell out the phrase 'CLOSE GATE'. \n"}, {"text": "What clues the monster in to its whereabouts, leading it to Will?", "correct": "A phone", "options": ["A walkie-talkie", "A chair", "A picture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA phone.\n\n\tNo sooner do they get the phrase 'CLOSE GATE' out of Will does the phone in the kitchen ring, giving whatever's in Will the opportunity to hone in on its location.  Nancy rips the phone out of the wall, but it's too late.  Out in the shed, something travels through the tunnels under Hawkins and Joyce has to knock her son out again with another tranquilizer.\rEveryone unties Will before they head out; Hopper grabs some weapons before telling the kids to stay way from the windows.  He hands Nancy a gun.  Lucas nocks his slingshot.  Outside, the demogorgons surround them.\rSomething flies through the window.  It's a dead demogorgon.\rOutside, something unlocks the door.  Eleven steps in. \n"}]}
