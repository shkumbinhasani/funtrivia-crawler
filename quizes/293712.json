In the course of rescuing the princess, Lone Starr and Barf must avoid their creditor, Pizza the Hut (Dom DeLuise), master The Schwartz, and escape the self-destructing Mega Maid.\r As well as \"Star Wars\", some other movies parodied in \"Spaceballs\" are \"Jaws\", \"Indiana Jones\", \"Rambo\", \"Rocky\" and \"Transformers\". \n"}, {"text": "In which 1989 movie would you find characters with the unlikely names of Ouiser, Spud and Drum?", "correct": "Steel Magnolias", "options": ["Soapdish", "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers", "Six Days, Seven Nights"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteel Magnolias.\n\n\tSet in a small town in Louisiana, \"Steel Magnolias\" focuses on the lives of a group of female friends.  M'Lynn's (Sally Field) daughter Shelby (Julia Roberts) gets married and faces a high risk pregnancy.  Anelle (Daryl Hannah) moves to the town and commences work in Truvy's (Dolly Parton) beauty parlor.  Clairee (Olympia Dukakis) is dealing with being widowed and the only person who can stand the caustic Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine).  Through love and loss the women cope with their lives while remaining as delicate as magnolias and as strong as steel.\r \"Steel Magnolias\" was written originally as an off-Broadway play by Robert Harling and was based on his experiences after the death of his sister. \n"}, {"text": "Released in 2004, which movie dubbed itself as a \"rom zom com\", or romantic zombie comedy? ", "correct": "Shaun of the Dead", "options": ["Serial Killer", "Sin City", "Shades of Darkness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShaun of the Dead.\n\n\tShaun (Simon Pegg) is about to turn 30 and things are not going well.  His girlfriend broke up with him, his colleagues at the electrical store don't respect him, his room-mates do not get along and he has major issues with his stepfather Phillip.  For Shaun it is an unfortunate time for the country to be taken over by zombies.\r Simon Pegg who co-wrote \"Shaun of the Dead\" with Edgar Wright, is well known for including references to \"Star Wars\" in his work.  Peter Serafinowicz, who plays Shaun's roommate in this movie is also the voice of Darth Maul in \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\". \n"}, {"text": "Which 1954 movie starring Audrey Hepburn was remade in 1995 with Julia Ormond in the title role?", "correct": "Sabrina", "options": ["She", "Secret Admirer", "Selena"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSabrina.\n\n\tThe 1995 remake of \"Sabrina\" inevitably suffered from the comparisons to the original starring Hollywood legends Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden.  Both movies stay true to the plot of a chauffeur's daughter who is so obsessed with the rich playboy David Larabee that her father sends her away to study in Paris (at culinary school in the original, and at the magazine \"Vogue\" in the remake). On her return to America, a more confident Sabrina catches the eye of both David and his more sensible workaholic older brother Linus. \r Bogart got the role of Linus in the original \"Sabrina\" after Cary Grant was unable to accept the role due to scheduling conflicts.  Bogart was notoriously unhappy during the making of the film, and did not get along with his co-stars, or the director.  Hepburn and Holden got along very well indeed, and began a brief, though much publicised affair during filming. \n"}, {"text": "The opening scene of which 1996 tongue-in-cheek horror movie featured Drew Barrymore making popcorn?", "correct": "Scream", "options": ["Scary Movie", "Saw", "Scarface"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScream.\n\n\tDrew Barrymore featured only briefly in the first of the \"Scream\" series, before she met an untimely (and fairly gruesome) death at the hands of the masked killer.  A year after her mother's brutal death, Sidney (Neve Campbell) becomes the target of the killer and her friends all become suspects as the hunt for the killer's identity is on.  In true horror movie tradition, people are classified as potential suspects or victims according to their actions.\r \"Scream\" relies heavily on references to other horror movies, and was directed by \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" director Wes Craven.  In its turn \"Scream\" was heavily parodied in the \"Scary Movie\" series. \n"}, {"text": "Stephen King's short story \"The Body\" was the basis for which 1986 movie?", "correct": "Stand By Me", "options": ["Signs", "Sabotage", "Small Soldiers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStand By Me.\n\n\tFour young boys set off to find the body of a local teenager.  What they don't realise is that along the journey they will each have to face their own demons.  Chris (River Phoenix) must face being stereotyped as a loser by the local community due to his family's history of producing criminals and alcoholics.  Gordie (Wil Wheaton) has been cruelly treated by his father since the death of his promising older brother.  The overweight Vern (Jerry O'Connell) has grown up timid and shy after being the target of bullies for much of his life, and Teddy (Corey Feldman) has been physically scarred by his unstable father.  The bond the four boys share help each of them face their problems.\r It is difficult to watch this movie without realizing that the untimely death of River Phoenix was a tragic loss to the acting world. \n"}, {"text": "Released in 2007, which dark musical starred Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter?", "correct": "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street", "options": ["Show Business", "Saturday Night Fever", "Sleepy Hollow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\n\n\tBarber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to Fleet Street after being falsely accused of a crime by Judge Turpin, who is attracted to the beauty of his daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener).
