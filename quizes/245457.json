{"id": "245457", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Dear Dad' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "In this episode, Hawkeye introduces his father to the quirky behavior of his friends at the 4077th.  Take Radar, for instance, who keeps sending packages home to Iowa.  What items are in Radar's parcels?", "correct": "Parts of a jeep", "options": ["Small mammals", "Korean ceramic pieces", "Dried army rations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParts of a jeep.\n\n\tIn the early episodes of 'M*A*S*H' Radar is so mischievous, isn't he?  Radar is in the process of mailing a jeep home 'piece by piece'.  Hawkeye and Trapper uncover Radar's plan after taking a fluoroscope of one of his boxes.  When Henry inquires about a package he helps Radar tie up with ropes, Radar claims that the box is full of toys for orphans. \n"}, {"text": "Father Mulcahy is also introduced to Hawkeye's dad in this episode.  When Hawkeye compliments the good Father on his Christmas tree, by what nickname does he call the Padre?", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Irish", "Pappy", "Mulky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tIn the movie and book versions of 'M*A*S*H', Father Mulcahy's nickname is 'Dago Red', referencing the color of his hair.  This is the only example of the nickname 'Red' being used for Father Mulcahy in the TV version.  I guess it didn't make sense calling Mulcahy 'Red' when he didn't have red hair. \n"}, {"text": "Henry Blake is next on Hawkeye's agenda.  Hawkeye discusses with his father a recent lecture Henry delivered to 4077th personnel.  What is the topic of this rather uncomfortable (for Henry) lecture?", "correct": "Marital Sex and the Family", "options": ["Venereal Diseases", "Temperance in the Temperate Zones", "The Evils of Drinking"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarital Sex and the Family.\n\n\tHenry stands in front of two large posters with full-body outlines of a man and woman while delivering his extemely awkward lecture.  Radar seems fascinated, but the rest of the men giggle and guffaw, including Hawkeye and Trapper who aren't even required to attend! \n"}, {"text": "Who is listed as a volunteer following this nutty PA announcement: 'The following men have volunteered for this afternoon's 10-mile fitness hike'?", "correct": "Nobody", "options": ["Just Hawkeye", "Frank and Hot Lips", "Just Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNobody.\n\n\tThis is one of several gag PA announcements Hawkeye overhears during the episode.  This device was used much more often during the early seasons of 'M*A*S*H', and to good effect. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye paints a pretty picture of his tentmate Trapper in this episode.  What is Trapper's 'thriving, lucrative practice on the side', according to Hawkeye?", "correct": "Giving vaccinations to local children", "options": ["Giving check-ups to older Koreans", "Delivering babies", "Teaching good hygiene practices to local nurses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGiving vaccinations to local children.\n\n\tOn a given day, Trapper can collect 50 or 60 smiles, according to Hawkeye.  Trapper is also shown having delivered a 'bouncing baby veal', from which he has collected a 'fee' of one gallon of milk. \n"}, {"text": "In the post-op ward, we see an altercation between Frank Burns and Klinger.  What clothing item worn by Klinger is at the center of the argument?", "correct": "Bandanna", "options": ["Tiara", "High heeled shoes", "Mink stole"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBandanna.\n\n\tKlinger is oddly presented out of his usual uniform (that is, women's clothing) and in army fatigues.  However, he does wear a red bandanna around his neck, a good luck gift from his mother.  Frank insists that Klinger give him the bandanna, and gets knocked out for his troubles. \n"}, {"text": "Frank and Hot Lips are next to get the Hawkeye treatment.  Frank is shown sneaking into Margaret's tent and putting his hands over her eyes.  He gives Hot Lips three guesses as to who he is.  Which of these is not one of them?", "correct": "Dwight Eisenhower", "options": ["Clark Gable", "General MacArthur", "Dr. Schweitzer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDwight Eisenhower.\n\n\tAfter her three guesses, a delighted Frank responds, 'Right, all three times!'  Margaret then brings up rumors of peace talks, to which Frank responds, 'Don't even think it!' \n"}, {"text": "Little do Frank and Hot Lips realize that Hawkeye and Trapper have been in Margaret's tent, and they have created several little surprise jokes for the hapless couple.  Which of these is not a prank set up by the Swamp rats?", "correct": "Plastic snake in Margaret's bed", "options": ["Pudding in Margaret's pillow", "Endlessly burning candle", "Sawed off bed posts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlastic snake in Margaret's bed.\n\n\t'Why can't people leave us alone?' asks Margaret.  'You'd think they're all my wife', says Frank.  'Oh, Frank', responds a sobbing Margaret.  All the while, with chaos reigning in Margaret's tent, Hawkeye and Trapper wish each other a lovely night's sleep. \n"}, {"text": "In 'Dear Dad', Trapper dresses up as Santa Claus, much to the delight of the local kids.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, Hawkeye gets to play the role of Saint Nick, but the festivities are halted when Henry insists Hawkeye go to treat a wounded kid in a foxhole.  Trapper offers to go, but Henry insists it be Hawkeye the chest cutter.  \r Oddly enough, in the movie it's Trapper who is the heart surgeon. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the episode, Hawkeye goes through the list of characters on the show.  Which of these characters is not mentioned among them?", "correct": "Ugly John", "options": ["Ginger Bayliss", "Klinger", "Father Mulcahy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUgly John.\n\n\tThough Klinger and Father Mulcahy weren't listed in the opening credits at this point, they still got mention as 'regulars' in this early episode.  Ginger Bayliss, played by Odessa Cleveland, also got mention here, though her participation on the show would essentially end after season two.  Ugly John (John Orchard), who appeared several more times during the first season, unfortunately didn't get a mention.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it! \n"}]}
