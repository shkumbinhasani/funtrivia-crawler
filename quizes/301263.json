{"id": "301263", "name": "January Saints Trivia Game | Christian People / Saints | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "Christian People / Saints", "Saints by the Calendar"], "questions": [{"text": "The second of January is the feast day of a man who never heard of the Catholic Church. After all, he lived thousands of years before Christ! Yet he is a natural patron saint, since the Bible says he was the first to suffer a fate that unites humanity - that is, the Bible says that he was the first person ever to die. Who is this patron of dying people, whom the Book of Genesis tells us was also the world's first murder victim?", "correct": "Abel", "options": ["Seth", "Adam", "Cain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbel.\n\n\tChapter 4 of Genesis tells how Cain, jealous of God's pleasure in his brother Abel's offering, led Abel to a field and killed him there. Cain's crime, and his lack of remorse, doomed him to wander the earth until his own death. Abel, meanwhile, was remembered as the first innocent victim of evil - a fact that some interpreted as making him the first martyr.In Matthew 23:35, Christ Himself referred to Abel's \"righteous blood\" when lamenting the fates of prophets through the ages - and when Christ thinks someone is righteous, it's hard to argue! Like other Old Testament figures believed by Catholics to be in Heaven, Abel is not typically called by the title \"Saint\" except on his feast day. \n"}, {"text": "St. Basil of Caesarea, celebrated on various days of January depending on what church's calendar you're looking at, was a bishop and theologian who wrote extensively on the mystery of the Holy Trinity. In what other area did this Great Hierarch and Doctor of the Church make formidable contributions?", "correct": "Monastic life", "options": ["Hymn writing", "Medicine", "Bible translation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonastic life.\n\n\tSt. Basil, born in AD 330 in what is now Turkey and also known as St. Basil the Great, came from a holy family. His grandmother, St. Macrina the Elder, is another January saint, celebrated on the 14th as the patron of widows; both of St. Basil's parents and four of his brothers and sisters were canonized as well.St. Basil himself was a theologian and philosopher, and (eventually) an important supporter of the Nicene Creed, which holds that the three members of the Holy Trinity - the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost - are equally divine. But his monastic rules are one of his most lasting contributions.He insisted on balancing prayer and work, and on moderation in the strict and self-mortifying practices of monks and hermits. His rules form the basis of Eastern monasticism, and inspired St. Benedict in the rules he devised for the West. He is celebrated on January 1 and January 30 in Eastern Orthodoxy; on January 2 by Roman Catholics; and on January 15 by Copts; a busy man, he also has a feast day in June. \n"}, {"text": "The very first native-born North American to be canonized is celebrated January 4, the anniversary of her death in 1821. She converted to Catholicism after the death of her husband and devoted herself to charity in the state of Maryland, where she founded a religious order (the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph's) and helped kick off the Catholic school movement in America. Who was this holy woman?", "correct": "St. Elizabeth Ann Seton", "options": ["St. Catherine of Siena", "St. Katharine Drexel", "St. Frances Xavier Cabrini"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Elizabeth Ann Seton\n\n\tSt. Elizabeth Seton's conversion to Catholicism did not please her Episcopalian family, and her resulting financial troubles were what led her to establish her first girls' school. As time went by, however, she found that she had a calling to education, and she founded the Sisters of Charity - America's first homegrown women's religious community - in part to help run her schools, although they were also involved with hospitals and orphanages.Mother Seton's 1975 canonization is a source of great pride in New York City (where she was born) and in Emmitsburg, Maryland, where she spent most of her later life. \n"}, {"text": "In Western churches, the Feast of the Epiphany is celebrated on the 6th of January. This holiday, whose name comes from the Greek for \"to show\", commemorates the visit of three magi to the infant Christ. These men are never named in the Bible, but what names are they given in Western tradition?", "correct": "Balthasar, Caspar, and Melchior", "options": ["Simon, Matthias and Thaddeus", "Herod, Pontius, and Caiaphas", "John, Isaiah, and Ezekiel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalthasar, Caspar, and Melchior.\n\n\tAs recounted in the Gospel of Matthew, wise men appeared in Jerusalem after Jesus's birth, inquiring where they might find the \"King of the Jews\" - they had \"seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him\" (Matthew 2:2). Unfortunately for everyone, they asked this question of King Herod, who thought of himself as King of the Jews, and their innocent inquiry eventually resulted in a massacre of children Jesus's age.\r The Bible does not give their names - in fact, it never even says that there are three of them, but it does say that they gave three gifts (\"gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,\" as listed in Matthew 2:11), and so the number has become enshrined in tradition. The first text giving their names as Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar dates from the sixth century, and their names have been fixed in Western legend since that time; the traditions of the various Eastern Orthodox churches disagree on the subject. There is also debate as to precisely where they came from - with Persia, Babylon and China being popular choices - and what their occupations were. Were they kings, astrologers, or even, perhaps, Zoroastrian priests? Regardless, they are counted as the first men of power (either religious or worldly) to worship Jesus Christ, and are therefore held in high esteem. \n"}, {"text": "On January 12, we celebrate St. Bernard of Corleone, a Sicilian who spent his youth in violent pursuits. In fact, he joined the Capuchin Friars primarily because he needed asylum from swordsmen intent on revenge! Why did his enemies wish him harm?", "correct": "He had fatally wounded a popular opponent in a duel.", "options": ["He thought he had made them an offer they could not refuse. They could.", "He had broken the heart of the duke's younger sister.", "He had spoken in favor of Copernicus's heretical ideas about the earth going around the sun."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe had fatally wounded a popular opponent in a duel.\n\n\tBorn a shoemaker's son in 1605, the young St. Bernard loved fencing and dueling. Though these activities were not exactly encouraged by the church, he was reported to have been pious in his own way. He often took the side of elderly and poor people in quarrels, sparing them from the more violent methods of settling disputes, and he donated money to local churches for their upkeep.However, his religious life really began after he killed a man in a duel, and the man's friends and family came looking for payback. At first he joined the Capuchin Franciscans purely for asylum; then, as the magnitude of his sins sank in, he asked to join their ranks.He imposed severe penances on himself, including lack of sleep, scourging, and a particularly cruel form of fasting: he would smell delicious morsels and then deny himself even a taste. His healing miracles, especially of animals, led to his canonization as a saint in 2001. \n"}, {"text": "St. Sebastian, a famous martyr from Roman times, is celebrated on the 20th of January. His persecutors' first attempt at killing him failed due to a miracle cure; how was he finally executed?", "correct": "He was clubbed to death.", "options": ["He was shot with arrows.", "He was beheaded.", "He was poisoned."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was clubbed to death.\n\n\tLegend tells us that St. Sebastian was a Roman soldier, a member of the Praetorian Guard under the Emperor Diocletian. Around the year 287, the Emperor discovered that his soldier was not only a Christian, but an active evangelist, converting local officials (including a jailer who proceeded to release all his prisoners). The furious Diocletian ordered him shot to death, and this is how we typically see St. Sebastian depicted in art - a shirtless man, head thrown back in pain, pierced with many arrows. Yet this was not the end of Sebastian's story: he was found by St. Irene of Rome, widow of the martyr St. Castulus, and cured. (His sudden immunity to arrows is thought to be the basis of his patronage of plague sufferers.)\r After such a close brush with martyrdom, some would have pursued a more quiet life in Christ, but this was not for St. Sebastian. At his first opportunity, he accosted the Emperor and shouted at him to stop his persecution of Christians. Diocletian was impressed, but only enough to order the saint's immediate execution. This time he was clubbed to death, and this time the execution took. \n"}, {"text": "On January 23, St. John the Merciful (also known as the Almsgiver) has his feast. As Patriarch of Alexandria between the years 606 and 616, he founded churches, improved religious education, and fought corruption among officials both worldly and spiritual. But the most telling stories about him concern the people he consistently referred to as his \"lords and masters.\" Who were they?", "correct": "The poor", "options": ["The memory of the apostles", "The local hermits", "His superiors in the Church"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe poor.\n\n\tLuke 6:20 quotes Jesus as saying, \"Blessed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.\" St. John the Merciful took these words to heart. If the Kingdom of Heaven belonged to the poor, then they would be his lords and masters there, and he owed them a duty of service on Earth. His fight against corruption was primarily motivated by its unfairness to the poor, and he imposed a strict system of weights and measures in order to prevent merchants from taking advantage of their poorest customers.His alms, too, were impressive: on taking control of his church, he took all the gold coins in the treasury and gave them to local hospitals and monasteries.There is a famous story where a friend of his gave him a valuable and beautiful blanket for his bed; he used it for one night in order to please his friend, and then sold it to give the proceeds to the poor. His friend bought it, and gave it to him again. After the cycle was repeated a few times, St. John remarked, \"We will see who tires first!\" (According to legend, it was not St. John.) He died around 619 in his homeland of Cyprus, after the Persian occupation of Alexandria. \n"}, {"text": "St. Francis de Sales, celebrated January 24, was a seventeenth-century priest and bishop whose patience and stubbornness served him well. His fame arises from the tracts he wrote to explain the joys of Catholic spirituality to ordinary people. What is the name of his most famous such work, a 1609 treatise that grew out of letters to a woman who wished to become more devout?", "correct": "Introduction to the Devout Life", "options": ["The Monk's Ladder", "The Interior Castle", "Confessions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIntroduction to the Devout Life.\n\n\tMadame de Charmoisy was married to one of the Duke of Savoy's ambassadors, and she was dissatisfied with life at court. It distracted her too much, she felt, from the love of God, and she turned to St. Francis de Sales for help. The resulting book is written in five parts and opens up a theological world that had previously been accessible only to priests, monks and nuns.\r St. Francis de Sales's entire career was distinguished by his drive to make Catholic teachings more widely accessible. He is credited with devising one of the first sign languages when a deaf man came to him wanting to learn more about the faith, and he and St. Jane de Chantal founded an order of nuns (the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary) for women who desired a contemplative and holy life, but did not have the strength or constitution for the strict and austere practices that were then in fashion. He was canonized in 1665, only 33 years after his death. \n"}, {"text": "This man, celebrated on January 26, was an early Christian bishop and a companion of St. Paul. (In fact, it was St. Paul himself who circumcised him!) St. Paul wrote him two letters, which now form part of the New Testament, advising him on how to deal with false teachers and other problems in his church. Who was this man, a Bishop of Ephesus?", "correct": "St. Timothy", "options": ["St. Philemon", "St. Bartholomew", "St. Onesimus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Timothy\n\n\tSt. Paul met St. Timothy - who was already a Christian - in Lystra. St. Timothy's mother was Jewish and his father was Greek; St. Paul, who opposed circumcision for Gentiles, circumcised the partly Jewish St. Timothy so that he would be better accepted by the people he preached to. Chapter 16 of the Acts of the Apostles tells of their meeting and their travels together through Phrygia, Galatia, Mysia, Troas and other sites. Tradition holds that St. Paul made St. Timothy the Bishop of Ephesus in AD 65, and that he was martyred 15 years later after objecting to a pagan ceremony.\r St. Paul's letters to St. Timothy, which appear in the New Testament after his letters to the Thessalonians, are rich with details about the organization of the early church. St. Paul laid out the job requirements of bishops and deacons and gave advice on dealing with various problems; in 2 Timothy 3 he noted that St. Timothy could always turn to the scriptures that he had known so well since childhood. \n"}, {"text": "January 28 is the feast of another theologian and Doctor of the Church. This man, famed for both his astounding mind and impressive weight, attempted to combine the theology of St. Augustine with the philosophy of Aristotle in his unfinished \"Summa Theologica.\" Who was this Dominican, who emphasized faith and reason as two necessary and complementary paths to the truth?", "correct": "St. Thomas Aquinas", "options": ["St. Berno of Cluny", "St. Ambrose", "St. John of the Cross"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas\n\n\tSt. Thomas Aquinas, born an Italian nobleman in 1225, had a difficult time following his calling. His family wanted him to become a respectable abbot, but the teenage St. Thomas wanted desperately to be a Dominican monk, begging on the streets to keep body and soul together. His family was so anxious for him to turn aside from the Dominicans that they kidnapped him and held him prisoner in the family castle for two years! They were unable to change his mind and he did join the Dominicans, but he spent his adulthood in respectable academia. He died of exhaustion at 49, before completing his greatest work, and is revered as the \"universal teacher.\"\r Thank you for joining me in this look at the saints of January! I hope you've enjoyed the tour. \n"}]}
