{"id": "62796", "name": "Salt Lake City Online Trivia | States | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "States U-W", "Utah"], "questions": [{"text": "A monument lies near the northeast corner of the city, at the mouth of Emigration Canyon, with a quote signifying that 'This is the Place!' Who was the founder of Salt Lake City that made this utterance?", "correct": "Brigham Young", "options": ["Joseph Smith", "John Fremont", "Jim Bridger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrigham Young.\n\n\tBrigham Young became president of the Mormon church following the death of its founder, Joseph Smith. You may still visit Brigham Young's Salt Lake home, called the 'Lion House', situated in the downtown area. Incidentally, frontiersman Jim Bridger may have been the first Caucasian man to visit the site on which Salt Lake was built, and is also rumored to have been the first person of European descent to have viewed the Great Salt Lake. \n"}, {"text": "Salt Lake City was named for the Great Salt Lake, situated at the northwest side of town and extending up into northern Utah. Is it true or false that the Great Salt Lake is the saltiest lake in the world?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis is certainly false, the Dead Sea holds this distinction (despite its name, the Dead Sea is in fact a lake). However, the Great Salt Lake is the saltiest lake in the United States and is definitely worth a visit when you come to Salt Lake City. The lake is so salty that enough buoyancy is provided for one to float on its surface. The lake is populated primarily by one inhabitant, brine shrimp, being too saline to harbor any larger organisms such as fish. The lake is mined for both the brine shrimp and the salt itself...you may notice a Morton Salt plant nearby. \n"}, {"text": "Salt Lake City is bounded on both the west and the east by mountain ranges. The world famous Wasatch mountains are situated at the east, but what smaller range limits the Salt Lake valley to the west?", "correct": "Oquirrh Mountains", "options": ["Box Elder Mountains", "House Mountains", "San Juan Mountains"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOquirrh Mountains.\n\n\tThe Oquirrh Mountains house the world famous Bingham Canyon copper mine, the largest open pit mine in the world. Many claim the Great Wall of China to be the only man-made object that can be seen from space, this is a myth. However, it is not a myth that the Bingham Canyon mine can be observed from well above Earth's atmosphere. The mine can be visited and it is well worth the trip. The trucks used to haul the mined materials, primarily copper ore, are fitted with the largest tires in the world...quite a sight! \n"}, {"text": "Several world famous ski resorts are within an hour of downtown Salt Lake City, including Park City, Deer Valley, Solitude, and Brighton. The latter two can be found up Big Cottonwood Canyon. Which two resorts may be found up Little Cottonwood Canyon?", "correct": "Snowbird and Alta", "options": ["Sundance and The Canyons", "Brian Head and Powder Mountain", "Wolf Mountain and Snowbasin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnowbird and Alta.\n\n\tAll of the above mentioned are Utah ski resorts, but only Alta and Snowbird lie up Little Cottonwood Canyon. You must try the skiing there some day, I do not think it is an idle boast that Utah's license plates read 'The Greatest Snow on Earth'! \n"}, {"text": "Downtown Salt Lake boasts the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, otherwise known as the Mormons. The Salt Lake Mormon temple, the Tabernacle and other interesting and important Mormon buildings are located within one city block downtown that is known as what?", "correct": "Temple Square", "options": ["Mormon Mecca", "Latter-day Saints Center", "Holy Block"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTemple Square.\n\n\tTemple Square is obviously worth a look when visiting Salt Lake City, especially if you are a fan of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I recommend visiting the visitor's centers on the north and south sides of the square as well. You'll certainly be accosted by friendly young Mormon folk, offering you tours and guidance...and it is most likely that they will not try and convert you at that time! To the West of the square you will find the Mormon History Museum, also worth a look! \n"}, {"text": "Salt Lake City has only a few very tall buildings.  Perhaps the most famous of these is called by the imaginative name 'Mormon Church Office Building'.  This was the long-time tallest building in Salt Lake, but is it still?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe Mormon Church Office Building, standing 28 stories and 420 feet high, is the second tallest in Salt Lake City after the Wells Fargo Center (422 ft, 24 stories - formerly called 'American Stores Building'). The Church Office Building is the 'corporate headquarters', so to speak, of the Mormon church, and contains the world famous geneology library that has been compiled by the Mormon church. The building is very oddly shaped, with two large wings on either side of the main building, both containing engraved world maps. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these roads is the 'main drag' of the Salt Lake valley, extending all the way from the downtown area to the distant southern suburb, Draper?", "correct": "State Street", "options": ["West Temple", "Main Street", "North Temple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nState Street.\n\n\tState Street has served as a vital artery for the city since its inception. Main Street is also an important road, now containing a substantial stretch of Salt Lake's light rail system, but it is secondary to State Street. North Temple and West Temple bound Temple Square in those directions. State Street also serves as the main drag for kids who 'cruise' the street on Friday and Saturday nights...try to avoid it at those times! \n"}, {"text": "There is only one university situated within the boundaries of Salt Lake City. Which one would that be?", "correct": "University of Utah", "options": ["Utah State University", "Brigham Young University", "Weber State University"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUniversity of Utah.\n\n\tThe University of Utah is situated in the northeast corner of the Salt Lake valley. Elevated somewhat above the rest of the valley, it lies on the foothills of the Wasatch range. One can get a terrific view of the valley from several of the buildings on campus, including the Rice-Eccles football stadium. Rice-Eccles stadium will be host to the opening ceremonies for the 2002 winter Olympic games. \n"}, {"text": "Salt Lake City proper has a population of 174,348, according to the 1998 estimate. Which of its neighboring suburbs has the next highest population in the valley, as of the year 2000?", "correct": "West Valley City", "options": ["Taylorsville", "Sandy", "West Jordan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWest Valley City.\n\n\tWest Valley City was recently the 3rd Utah city to surpass the 100,000 mark in population. As suggested by its name, it is located in the western portion of the Salt Lake valley! Behind West Valley City we have Sandy, which also recently surpassed the 100,000 mark in population. Sandy is located to the south of Salt Lake and I know the town well, having gone to high school there! Incidentally, the second largest city in Utah in terms of population is Provo, located one valley south of the Salt Lake valley, with a population of approximately 110,000, as of the year 2000. Brigham Young University can be found in Provo, but not much else! \n"}, {"text": "Here's an easy one, if one regards my username. Which NBA team plays its games in the Delta Center, located in downtown Salt Lake City?", "correct": "Utah Jazz & Jazz & The Utah Jazz & The Jazz", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nUtah Jazz & Jazz & The Utah Jazz & The Jazz.\n\n\tThe Jazz have not been scintillating during the 2001-2002 basketball season, but one day they will again be great! \n"}]}
