A newlywed couple, Teresa and Leo, arrive at the ruins of the Briarcliff Manor, once a sanitarium for the criminally insane.  This is the last stop on their 'haunted honeymoon tour', a decision they made since Teresa is a big horror buff; Leo's just along to take pictures.  Teresa explains that Briarcliff was built as a tuberculosis ward in the 1900s; forty-six thousand people died within its walls. They sent the bodies through an underground tunnel to improve patient morale and they called it the death chute.  The couple heads upstairs to find a reference to a serial killer named Bloody Face scrawled on a brick wall. Leo ties Teresa up in an electrotherapy chair before they hear a noise.  When they find a door leading to a dead end room, Teresa makes Leo take a video on his phone through a slot in the door.  That's when something grabs his arm and doesn't let go.  She screams as Leo falls back missing one arm. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Kit Walker work?", "correct": "Gas station", "options": ["Convenience mart", "Factory", "Record shop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGas station.\n\n\tThe year is 1964.  Kit Walker works at a local gas station and closes up as his workday comes to an end.  As he prepares to leave, the lights and radio flicker out.  Frightened, he rushes into the station to find his gun but runs into some of the local guys instead.  He takes his gun back from them as they urge him to come along and scare another guy.  When he resists, they allude to his new 'maid', leaving Kit uneasy.\rWhen Kit gets home, he greets Mrs. Walker, his new wife, who also happens to be African-American.

When electrical feedback cuts out the radio, Kit sees a bright light outside.  He gets a shotgun and checks to see if the guys are outside, but he's surprised instead by more bright lights and an ear-piercing, inhuman noise.

When she pulls up to the building she's greeted by one of the inmates who asks her to play.  Sister Mary Eunice arrives to say that the girl is dangerous-- she drowned her baby and sliced its ears off-- before taking her up the Asylum's stairway to heaven to Sister Jude's office.\rInside, Jude is shaving the hair of a nymphomaniac inmate, Shelley, who requires corrective punishment for her actions.  Sister Mary Eunice leaves with Shelley before Lana can chat with Sister Jude.  Although Lana says she's there about the bakery, their discussion clearly takes a turn towards the inner workings of the asylum proper.  Sister Jude says that mental illness is a rationalization of sin.  She also talks about Monsignor Timothy Howard's views for the institution and his philosophy which involves Productivity, Prayer, and Purification.  Sister Mary Eunice comes in to tell Sister Jude that their newest patient has arrived.  Lana inadvertently reveals that she's actually there to get a story on their inmates, particularly the one being admitted-- the killer known as Bloody Face, who's already decapitated several women.  He's being admitted by the authorities until he is deemed fit to stand trial.  When he leaves the police car, he's revealed to be Kit. \n"}, {"text": "According to Sister Jude, all monsters are which of these?", "correct": "Human", "options": ["Deadly", "Mad", "Hungry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHuman.\n\n\tKit is hosed down and brought to a bed to be sedated and restrained.  When he awakens, Sister Jude is sitting by his bed and she admits to him that he's there purely for storage's sake.  He'll be repenting his crimes while he awaits trial, but he'll also be judged by God.  Kit claims that there is no God considering what he's seen.  Jude says he's a monster before leaving.\rJude heads to the common room and meets several of the other patients.  Shelley tries to present herself to Kit while Grace, another inmate, makes herself a friend by warning Kit that he needs to follow the rules (and there are many of them) or else be punished.  She says she can be trusted because she's not crazy.  Kit gets into a fistfight with another patient before Sister Jude comes in.

She says she's on kitchen detail and offers him a cigarette through the window.  When he asks why she's being so nice, she says that what you put into the world comes back to you.  He asks why she's there and she says that they think she killed her family with an axe.\rSister Jude finds Sister Mary Eunice crying in the common room and discovers that Willy, one of the inmates, was sick and taken away in the night.  The blame falls on Dr. Arthur Arden, who'd never informed Sister Jude.  She heads downstairs to speak to him in his lab and he says that he has a certain amount of authority considering the Monsignor's deal to pull him out of retirement.  Also, considering the changing times, his scientific advances are of the utmost importance; he shows her a plant, a new hybrid created by bombarding it with gamma rays.  Sister Jude is less than impressed and considers them to be travesties to God.  She questions him about the people who've disappeared under his care and he says they died-- they were all cremated after illness.  Sister Jude finds it interesting that all of the dead inmates didn't have families. \n"}, {"text": "Lana's girlfriend, Wendy, has which occupation?", "correct": "Schoolteacher", "options": ["Attorney", "Reporter", "Nurse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSchoolteacher.\n\n\tLana spends dinner with her girlfriend, Wendy, and discusses the Briarcliff story.  It means a lot to Lana because it could be her ticket to a huge job with a real, national paper ad possibly a Pulitzer Prize.  Wendy recommends that she go for it.  They start to kiss, but decide to close the blinds first; their lifestyle is especially difficult to maintain since Wendy is a schoolteacher.  Nonetheless, they remain optimistic about the story.\rSister Jude, meanwhile, prepares coq au vin for dinner with Monsignor Howard and she prays throughout.  Before dinner, she dons red lingerie and perfume.  Over the meal, Sister Jude is almost flirtatious but she remains restrained.  She asks about their vision together (madness as a spiritual crisis; an absence of God) and questions his choice to bring in Dr. Arden.

She asks what more they could want if not to save souls and he says that they could run this asylum and meet all their goals-- they could be asked to be Cardinal of New York and she could be Mother Superior to thousands of nuns as his right hand.  He could be the first Anglo-American Pope.  Sister Jude takes off her habit and reveals her red lingerie to the Monsignor before Sister Jude recovers from an apparent daydream.\rSister Mary Eunice tells Dr. Arden that 'they' are getting hungrier and he tells her to head to the forest next to the asylum with some meat.  When she drops the bucket off for an unknown creature she runs into Lana and tells her that they need to leave immediately.\rDr. Arden pulls a traumatized Kit from his cell and injects him with a sedative.

She comes across Shelley and discovers that Kit is in solitary but she's forced to hide in a cell when Sister Jude comes along with a flashlight to make her rounds.\rDr. Arden wheels Kit into his lab for a surgical procedure (sans anesthesia).  He informs Kit that he runs the institution.  He says it's his time, a time of science, and he seeks to find the devil in his occipital lobe.  He needs to examine his brain to better understand.

Dr. Arden finds an abnormality in his neck and cuts it out to reveal a small, black disk,  It opens up to reveal legs before running away.\rLana waits until Sister Jude leaves before finding a room at the end of the hall, the same room that Teresa and Leo would find in the present day.

Sister Jude says that there's been an accident and she will need to recover there for a while.  When Lana says that people will be looking for her, Sister Jude says that's not the case.

Sister Jude reasoned that Wendy would never want to expose her students (or anyone else) to Lana's 'inversion' and recommended that she sign Lana over to her care to prevent the word getting out about their relationship.  Sister Jude tells Lana that something inside her must have realized she needed help.  She shows the papers as Lana cries and screams for help.\rSister Jude gets her hands on Dr. Arden's keys and investigates the room at which Lana was found.  When she opens the door she finds Arden inside, cleaning the walls.  An awful odour plagues the room; she says that something's been living there but he responds that the room's been empty for years and he needs it for storage space.  He takes his keys back and heads down the hall.  Sister Jude vows to uncover the truth.\r In the present time, while Leo bleeds out, Teresa finds her way down to the death chute.  Before she can reach the end, she finds herself face-to-face with none other than Bloody Face. \n"}]}
