{"id": "248405", "name": "Alphabetical Horror Films - A Multiple Choice Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Sigourney Weaver starred as Ellen Ripley in which 1979 horror movie set onboard the Nostromo?", "correct": "Alien", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlien.\n\n\t\"Alien\", directed by Ridley Scott, became one of the most successful horror films of the seventies, and shot star Sigourney Weaver to fame.  In the movie, the Nostromo discovered a signal from a nearby planet and when one crew member investigated the area, he was attacked by a creature which leapt out of a giant egg. After it hatched from his chest cavity, the crew had to try to capture or kill the creature in their ship before it killed them first.  The movie spawned sequels (three of which starred Weaver, who reprised her role as the strong-willed Ellen Ripley), comic books, video games, and various other \"Alien\" items. In 2003, the American Film Institute rated Ellen Ripley as the eighth greatest film hero. \n"}, {"text": "Based on a book written by Jay Anson, which film, starring Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George, was remade in 2005?", "correct": "The Amityville Horror", "options": ["American Gothic", "Autopsy", "Alive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Amityville Horror.\n\n\tTold to be based on real events, the story of \"The Amityville Horror\" was an odd one.  A family moved into their beautiful new house to experience odd phenomena.  Soon, they realized that the previous owners of the house were murdered.  The movie and book soon spread into a large series of both novels and films.  The remake featured some changes from the original, and was generally disliked by the author of the story, who sued the filmmakers.  Both the original and the remake were generally popular in the box office.  The sequels were not. \n"}, {"text": "The main character of this 2000 film, Patrick Bateman, was played by a man who would later play the role of Batman.

For the majority, the movie took place in the 1820s, and followed a family whose daughter was possessed by a spirit known as 'Kate'.  The family blamed the Bell Witch for this, though there was some suspicion as to whether or not the patriarch of the family, John Bell, was responsible. \n"}, {"text": "The 1981 film \"An American Werewolf in London\" has developed a small cult following over the years.

The \"Evil Dead\" gave Bruce Campbell his most popular role in the movie industry. \n"}, {"text": "Basically, during this 1986 film, a group of teenagers went to an island cottage for spring break, where they ended up being killed off by Buffy St. John, the deranged twin sister of their friend, Muffy.  What film was this?", "correct": "April Fools Day", "options": ["Alice", "Appointment with Fear", "The Axe Master"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApril Fools Day.\n\n\t\"April Fools Day\" followed teens who went to an island for spring break (coincidentally on April 1st), and although they often played pranks on each other during the film, things got really weird when they were being killed off.

After the revelation, one of her friends ended up pranking her by slitting her throat.

They soon discovered that the place was a location where predators would become host bodies for aliens, and then survivors would hunt the resulting offspring down.  Of course, the humans who arrived made their journey at the worst possible moment, and they were caught in the brawl that ensued. \n"}, {"text": "In 1997, Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube teamed up to fight off Jon Voight and a giant snake in the film \"Anaconda\".
