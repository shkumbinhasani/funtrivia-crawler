{"id": "111070", "name": "The People in Billy Joel's Lyrics Quiz | Music | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music H-K", " Billy Joel"], "questions": [{"text": "In a track from Billy's first solo album, \"Cold Spring Harbor\" (1971), he states that a certain woman is \"the best place to go\" when he cries.  What is this person's name?", "correct": "Judy", "options": ["Elizabeth", "Elisa", "Janet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJudy.\n\n\t\"Why Judy Why\" opens with the line \"Of all the people in the world that I know, you're the best place to go when I cry.\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"Piano Man\", the chart-topping hit from the 1973 album of the same name, Billy mentions the names of several people. Who is NOT one of them?", "correct": "George", "options": ["John", "Davy", "Paul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge.\n\n\tAccording to the lyrics, John is a bartender; Paul is a real estate novelist (whatever that is) \"who never had time for a wife\"; and Davy is \"still in the navy, and probably will be for life.\"  No one named George is referred to in the song. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Ballad of Billy the Kid\" (also on \"Piano Man\"), Billy refers to both the real Billy the Kid and a more modern version of the gunslinging outlaw. Several U.S. locales are mentioned in this song.  Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Tombstone, AZ", "options": ["They are all mentioned", "Long Island, NY", "Wheeling, WV"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTombstone, AZ.\n\n\tWilliam Bonny, a.k.a. Billy the Kid, was from Wheeling, West Virginia; the first line of the song refers to this fact. In the last verse of the song, Billy mentions a kid from Oyster Bay, Long Island, which is in the state of New York.  There's no mention of Tombstone in the song. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Streetlife Serenader\", the almost-title track from the 1974 album \"Streetlife Serenade\", Billy mentions a particular U.S. president.  Which one?", "correct": "Eisenhower", "options": ["Kennedy", "Nixon", "Truman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEisenhower.\n\n\tBilly refers to the streetlight vocalist featured in the song as a \"child of Eisenhower...new world celebrator.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Roberta\", another track from \"Streetlife Serenade\", is sung directly to a woman named Roberta. What does she do for a living?", "correct": "She is a stripper", "options": ["She is a waitress", "She is a teacher", "She is a singer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe is a stripper.\n\n\tThe line \"Roberta, you say you know me/But I see only what you're paid to show me\" is an early indication that Roberta is a stripper.  A later line, \"I'd ask you over, but I can't afford you\" seems to suggest that Roberta may dabble in prostitution, as well. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following people is NOT mentioned in \"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\", originally featured on 1975's \"Turnstiles\"?", "correct": "Tommy", "options": ["Johnny", "They all are", "Bobby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTommy.\n\n\tThe song opens with the line \"Bobby's driving through the city tonight.\" A later line informs us that \"Johnny's taking care of things for a while.\"  No Tommy in sight.  \r A live version of this song was featured on the all-live \"Songs From the Attic,\" and that version of the tune was popular enough to be included on Billy's first greatest hits album, as opposed to the original studio cut from \"Turnstiles.\"  Most fans are therefore more familiar with the live version! \n"}, {"text": "\"James\", also on \"Turnstiles\", seems to be about a childhood friend of Billy's who is no longer a part of his life.  What profession does Billy hope that James has taken up?", "correct": "writer", "options": ["scuptor", "actor", "painter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwriter.\n\n\tBilly asks, \"Will you ever write your masterpiece?\", and later, \"When will you write your masterpiece?\" \n"}, {"text": "Sergeant O'Leary is a character featured in \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\", from 1977's \"The Stranger.\"  The police officer moonlights as a bartender at a bar called Mister Cacciatore's.  On what street is this bar located?", "correct": "Sullivan Street", "options": ["Finnegan Street", "Mulligan Street", "Hannigan Street"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSullivan Street.\n\n\tThe line is: \"He works at Mister Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street, across from the medical center.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Scenes From an Italian Restaurant\", also from \"The Stranger\", tells the tale of a certain married couple.  What are their names?", "correct": "Brenda and Eddie", "options": ["Linda and Eddie", "Brenda and Freddy", "Linda and Freddy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrenda and Eddie.\n\n\t\"Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies and the king and the queen of the prom...\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Only the Good Die Young\", another crowd-pleaser from \"The Stranger\", is sung to a woman named Virginia.  What is Virginia's religious affiliation?", "correct": "Catholic", "options": ["Atheist", "Jewish", "Protestant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatholic.\n\n\tThe song opens with, \"Come out, Virginia/Don't let me wait/You Catholic girls start much too late.\"  Several other Catholic references are peppered throughout the song. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Zanzibar\", a track from 1978's \"52nd Street\", Billy makes references to real-life professional athletes.  Which sport is NOT referred to in any way in this song?", "correct": "football", "options": ["boxing", "They all are", "baseball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfootball.\n\n\tThe song opens with \"Ali dances, and the audience applauds/Though he's bathed in sweat, he hasn't lost his style\" -- an obvious nod to Muhammad Ali, whose fancy footwork has often been compared to dancing.  Later, the line \"Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game, but the Yankees grab the headlines every time\" is a clear reference to baseball player Pete Rose.  No football players are mentioned in the song. \n"}, {"text": "Another song from \"52nd Street\" is called \"Rosalinda's Eyes.\"  What real-life woman in Billy's life is or was named Rosalinda?", "correct": "his mother", "options": ["his grandmother", "his first girlfriend", "his first wife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhis mother.\n\n\tRosalind was Billy's mother. The song is about a down-on-his-luck musician who finds inspiration, approval, and hope in Rosalinda's eyes. Makes sense to me, all things considered. \n"}, {"text": "One of the songs on \"Glass Houses\" (1980) is about Billy's being utterly obsessed with a former lover, to the extent that he is unable to start a new relationship.  What is this woman's name?", "correct": "Leyna", "options": ["Elizabeth", "Carla", "Rosalinda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeyna.\n\n\t\"All For Leyna\" contains such disturbing lines as \"I don't want anyone new, 'cause I'm living it all for Leyna.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Sleeping With the Television On\", also from \"Glass Houses\", is sung directly to a particular woman. What's her name?", "correct": "Diane", "options": ["Carla", "Leyna", "Christie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiane.\n\n\tThe song opens with, \"Well, I've been watching you waltz all night, Diane.\"  Her name is mentioned later, as well.  Who is Diane?  Got me. \n"}, {"text": "\"Laura\", the second track on 1982's \"The Nylon Curtain\", is a landmark of sorts for Billy Joel. Why?", "correct": "It contains an expletive that he had never used before in song", "options": ["It was written by someone other than Billy Joel", "There are no lyrics", "Someone other than Billy Joel plays the piano in the song"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt contains an expletive that he had never used before in song.\n\n\t\"Laura\", written by Joel, does have lyrics, and Billy plays the keyboards himself. The Funtrivia-friendly line \"Here I am, feeling like a fool\" contains, in the actual song, an expletive (right before \"fool\") that is unprintable on this site...but use your imagination.  It's perhaps the \"worst\" of all the \"bad\" words.  It's the only time the word is heard in all of Billy's albums. \n"}, {"text": "Also on \"The Nylon Curtain\" is the Vietnam War dirge \"Goodnight Saigon.\"  Which of the following names does NOT belong to one of the Marines referred to in the song?", "correct": "Morrison", "options": ["Charlie", "Baker", "They are all referred to in the song"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorrison.\n\n\t\"Remember Charlie? Remember Baker? They left their childhood with every acre.\"  There's a later reference to The Doors (led by Jim Morrison), but no Marine named Morrison is mentioned in the song. \n"}, {"text": "\"Christie Lee\", on 1983's \"An Innocent Man\", is about a jazz saxophonist who gets his heart broken by a manipulative woman.  Her name is the title of the song, but what's HIS name, as far as Billy remembers?", "correct": "Joe", "options": ["John", "Al", "Bill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe.\n\n\tActually, Billy states that he doesn't remember the man's real name; the closest he gets to identifying him is, \"The man's name I don't remember/He was always Joe to me.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Keeping the Faith\", the final track on \"An Innocent Man\", contains a reference to a relative of Billy's. Which one?", "correct": "his father", "options": ["his mother", "his sister", "his brother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhis father.\n\n\t\"I took a fresh pack of Luckies and a mint called Sen-Sen/My old man's Trojans and his Old Spice aftershave.\"  No other relations are mentioned in the song. \n"}, {"text": "Billy refers to a rather large number of real people by name in \"We Didn't Start the Fire\", from 1989's \"Storm Front.\"  Harry Truman is the first person he names.  Who is the LAST person he names in the song?", "correct": "Bernard Goetz, subway vigilante", "options": ["Sally Ride, astronaut", "Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" personality", "George Bush, U.S. President"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBernard Goetz, subway vigilante.\n\n\tThe third-to-last-line in the song is, \"Foreign debts, homeless vets, AIDS, crack, Bernie Goetz.\"  The final two new lines -- \"Hypodermics on the shores, China's under martial law/Rock and roller cola wars, I can't take it anymore\" -- do not contain any names, so Goetz is the last person named in the song. \n"}, {"text": "\"Leningrad\", also on \"Storm Front\", features a Russian clown who made Billy's daughter Alexa laugh. What is this man's name?", "correct": "Viktor", "options": ["Dmitri", "Mikhail", "Vanya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViktor.\n\n\tThe song opens with \"Viktor was born in the spring of '44,\" and his name is mentioned a few more times in the rest of the song.\r Hope you enjoyed the quiz! \n"}]}
