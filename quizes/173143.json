Perhaps the greatest actor-director team from Hong Kong has been John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat, who collaborated on a number of films, including the 1992 'Lashou Shentan'.  Also featuring Hong Kong heart-throb Tony Leung, what is the name of this action-thriller with a stunning set of sequences filmed in a hospital?", "correct": "Hard-Boiled", "options": ["City on Fire", "God of Gamblers", "The Killer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHard-Boiled.\n\n\tChow Yun-Fat plays Tequila (Yuen), while Tony Leung portrays his friend, an undercover cop named Alan.  This film and the 'Better Tomorrow' trilogy are probably the best collaborations between Chow and Woo.  However, my favorite Cantonese language films featuring Chow Yun-Fat are 'Full Contact' (Xia dao Gao Fei), directed by Ringo Lam, and the very funny 'God of Gamblers' series.
