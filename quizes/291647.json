Although the Phillies were skunked four games to none, this was the Phillies' first World Series appearance since what season?", "correct": "1915", "options": ["1908", "1929", "This was their first-ever appearance in 1950"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1915.\n\n\tThe Phillies franchise began in 1883, and they had never been in a championship series until the 1915 World Series, which they lost to the Red Sox of Boston.  The Phillies never had any momementum against the Yankees in the 1950 series.  The Phillies could muster only 12 strikeouts in the entire series against the New York bats.  Granny Hamner topped the Philadelphia roster with .429 average, the only one to bat over .300.  Gene Woodling led the Yankees with a .429 average of his own.  Yogi Berra and Joe DiMaggio hit the only two home runs in the series. \n"}, {"text": "The 1951 World Series beginning was still echoing, \"The Giants win the pennant!

Who was the World Series MVP?", "correct": "There wasn't one", "options": ["Willie Mays", "Allie Reynolds", "Joe DiMaggio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThere wasn't one.\n\n\tThe others never won a World Series MVP, mainly because the award did not begin until 1955 when Dodger pitcher Johnny Podres won the inaugural award.  The Yankees blew out the Giants in game five with a 13-1 win, then finished them off with a 4-3 win in game six. \n"}, {"text": "With three consecutive World Series titles under their belt, the 1952 Yankees moved on to play their crosstown rival Dodgers from Brooklyn.  The series would go seven games, with only one game being won by more than two runs.  Each team alternated wins.  First the Dodgers, then Yankees, then Dodgers, etc, until game seven was won by the Yankees 4-2.  Johnny Mize of the Yankees hit three home runs in the series.  Which Dodger hit four home runs?", "correct": "Duke Snider", "options": ["Roy Campanella", "Gil Hodges", "Nobody hit four home runs in the series"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuke Snider.\n\n\tThe others were Dodgers, but they didn't hit any home runs in the series.  Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle also hit two for the Yankees, but to take away Mize's limelight, Snider hit one in games one and five, then two in game six.  Snider totaled eight RBIs in the series, falling short by one of tying a series record set by Danny Murphy and Lou Gehrig.  Duke's four home runs in a World Series tied the record of Gehrig and Babe Ruth. \n"}, {"text": "The 1953 World Series would be a repeat of the previous season, pitting the Yankees against the Dodgers.

With one out, Billy Martin's single to centerfield scored Bauer, and the Yankees had won their fifth consecutive World Series title. \n"}, {"text": "The 1954 World Series was missing something big.  Missing was the New York Yankees, and after five consecutive appearances, this time it was another American League team who had a shot at the promised land to go up against the National League representative.  Which American League team was it?", "correct": "Cleveland Indians", "options": ["Philadelphia Athletics", "Detroit Tigers", "Chicago White Sox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCleveland Indians.\n\n\tThe series was not 'New Yorkless', as the Giants won the NL pennant.  Why was this series so memorable some might ask?  It was because the Indians won an amazing 111 games in the season, the most since the 1906 Chicago Cubs.  The Indians were heavy favorites to easily dispose of the Giants, but the series proved that anyone can beat anyone on any given day, and many days at that. The Giants not only won, but they skunked the star-studded Indians four games to none.  The Indians had seven players who hit home runs in double-figures during the season, but could only muster three in the series.
