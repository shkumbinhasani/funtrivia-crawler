{"id": "404893", "name": "\"Dead By Daylight\" DLC - Chapters XI-XX Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games D-F", "Dead by Daylight"], "questions": [{"text": "Chapter 11: \"Demise of the Faithful\"\nThis Chapter introduced a new map in what previously-used realm?", "correct": "Red Forest", "options": ["Crotus Prenn Asyulm", "Autohaven Wreckers", "Coldwind Farm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed Forest.\n\n\tRed Forest previously only highlighted the Mother's Dwelling map introduced with The Huntress early in the game's life.  \"Demise of the Faithful\", however, marked the release of The Plague, an infectious Killer with the ability to purge 'corruption' on Survivors, forcing them to heal their ills at marked fonts found on each map (not unlike Jigsaw Trap boxes or Alarm Clocks).  The map introduced with this expansion was the Temple of Purgation, known for its massive multi-level temple structure. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 12: \"Ghost Face\"\nNo Survivor was released alongside this Chapter.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThis Chapter brought the highly-anticipated \"Scream\" Killer into the game, but due to work on the proceeding Chapter, only a Killer was slotted into the release (along with changes to cosmetics going forward).  With similar mechanics to both The Pig and The Shape, Ghost Face utilizes stealth to down foes, charging his power to bring Survivors to the Exposed condition with the aim of downing them in one hit.  Ghost Face has one weakness though; if Survivors spot him peeking out at them, they can mitigate his power. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 13: \"Stranger Things\"\nThe Demogorgon, this Chapter's Killer, as two abilities.  The first is a Shred attack, the second is the ability to make which of these?", "correct": "Portals", "options": ["Dream Snares", "False Totems", "Tendrils"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortals.\n\n\tBringing new mechanics into the game, The Demogorgon was part of an ambitious Chapter inspired by the Netflix series \"Stranger Things\" that brought both the otherworldly creature and Survivor duo Steve and Nancy into the realm of the Entity.  Demo, capable of slashing out with his claws, has a short, charged burst attack that can shred Survivors or pallets, but he also has a fair bit of maneuverability on the map since he can create portals on the ground to teleport himself to other portals laid elsewhere. The portals also tend to give him temporary stealth if placed carefully and tactically. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 14: \"Cursed Legacy\"\nThe Oni, this Chapter's Killer, is related to which earlier Killer?", "correct": "The Spirit", "options": ["The Huntress", "The Nurse", "The Legion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Spirit.\n\n\tKazan Yamaoka, The Oni, is The Spirit's distantly related grandfather (think five or six generations of separation).  The \"Cursed Legacy\" Chapter, like \"Shattered Bloodline\" a while before it, featured a map set on the Yamaoka Estate (this time the Sanctum of Wrath) and leaned into an Asian aesthetic.  Besides The Oni, the Chapter marked the arrival of Survivor Yui Kimura, a tenacious character whose perks lean into fighting back. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 15: \"Chains of Hate\"\nWhich of these was not a Survivor perk introduced alongside Zarina Kassir in this Chapter?", "correct": "Solidarity", "options": ["Red Herring", "For the People", "Off the Record"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSolidarity.\n\n\tSolidarity is actually a Jane Romero perk introduced in \"Demise of the Faithful\".  All the rest, however, go to Zarina Kassir, the new Survivor released alongside The Deathslinger in the \"Chains of Hate\" Chapter.  Showing up alongside the Dead Dawg Saloon map, the Deathslinger was a brief respite from more melee-attuned Killers.  Using a grappling gun to chain up and reel in Survivors, he could inflict wounds on anyone trying to escape, sneakily sniping in on people with a minimal terror radius. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 16: \"Silent Hill\"\nA Survivor can protect themselves from Rites of Judgment by doing which of the following?", "correct": "Crouching while passing through its trail", "options": ["Mending", "Weaving away from the Killer", "Shining a flashlight on it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrouching while passing through its trail.\n\n\tBringing the first Chapter of the game to be based entirely on another horror gaming property, the \"Silent Hill\" Chapter introduced Pyramidhead, The Executioner, into the fog.  With the massive Great Knife as his weapon, the Executioner is able to attack with range and create Rites of Judgment, paths along the ground that cause players to be affected by a status ailment that puts them at further risk when downed.  This Chapter's survivor, Cheryl Mason, was featured in \"Silent Hill 3\".  This Chapter also introduced the map at Midwich Elementary School. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 17: \"Descend Beyond\"\nFelix Richter is a resourceful Survivor introduced alongside what new Killer in this Chapter?", "correct": "The Blight", "options": ["The Alchemist", "The Corruption", "The Archivist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blight.\n\n\tFelix Richter is interestingly back-to-basics as far as Survivors go because his perks are often passive and don't require much forethought to use in any given match since they give bonuses for injuries on other Survivors, provide auras, and enhance charged item use.  The Blight, meanwhile, is a crafty Killer who utilizes the alchemical Blight compound to gain a burst of speed, bouncing into obstacles and chaining said bounces to charge at Survivors on the map. Interestingly, this was the first Chapter of the game that did not release with a new map or realm as it marked the start of a graphical overhaul (called 'Realm Reborn') that resulted in all past maps being updated in full. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 18: \"A Binding of Kin\"\nWhat is the name of Charlotte's smaller sibling?", "correct": "Victor", "options": ["Herman", "Caleb", "Talbot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictor.\n\n\t\"A Binding of Kin\" brought a new type of Killer(s) into the fold by introducing the world to The Twins.  Players would be able to control Charlotte as the main Killer, but periodically they could unleash and control Victor, her small twin, able to pounce and latch onto Survivors to harm and hinder them.  They were released alongside \u00c9lodie Rakoto, whose perks highlight her tenacity and craftiness in the fog. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 19: \"All-Kill\"\nThis Chapter's Killer and Survivor hail from which nation?", "correct": "South Korea", "options": ["Singapore", "Japan", "China"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSouth Korea.\n\n\tThe Survivor, Yun-Jin Lee, and the Killer, The Trickster, are both South Korean characters, both sharing much of the same origin story before having been brought into the realm of the entity.  Yun-Jin's relentlessness and ability to fend for herself come out in her perks while The Trickster acts as one of the rare true projectile-oriented Killers, able to throw Blades that he collects from lockers not unlike the Huntress with Hatchets. \n"}, {"text": "Chapter 20: \"Resident Evil\"\nThis Chapter introduced which classic \"Resident Evil\" foe to the game?", "correct": "Nemesis", "options": ["Mr. X", "Albert Wesker", "Lady Dimitrescu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNemesis.\n\n\tIn one of the largest franchise gets for \"Dead By Daylight\", \"Resident Evil\" was a highly anticipated Chapter release that saw the introduction of \"Resident Evil 3's\" Nemesis as the Killer, and both Jill Valentine and Leon S. Kennedy as Survivors.  All appearing on the massive multi-floor Raccoon City Police Station map, it was a new high point for the game, releasing with a new peak player total.  This also marked the first instance in which computer-controlled elements could appear on the map; Survivors could interact with zombies, for better or for worse, on any map visited by The Nemesis. \n"}]}
