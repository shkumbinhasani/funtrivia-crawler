Who was this Yankee great?", "correct": "George H. Ruth", "options": ["Stephen J. Ruth", "Baberiel Johnston II", "Robert B. Mazoni"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge H. Ruth\n\n\tGeorge Herman Ruth began his career as a Boston Red Sox pitcher in 1914.  In 1915, Ruth went 18-8, then 23-12 in 1916 while making a name for himself not only on the mound, but also with his bat.  After throwing a 24-13 record in 1917, many other baseball eyes were on him.  After the 1919 season, the world was shocked when the Red Sox sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees. The Yankees were not interested in Ruth's arm, but his bat made him more appetizing.  Although appearing in only one game from the mound for the Yankees in 1920, Ruth proved his bat was to be something that would have to be dealt with. He hit 54 home runs while appearing in 142 games for New York. He broke the previous season home run record of baseball with his own 29 that was hit with Boston in 1919.   The rest would be history in the infamy of baseball. \n"}, {"text": "This catcher who tragically died in an aircraft crash in 1979, had numerous nicknames including, \"Tugboat\", \"Squatty Body\", and \"The Wall\".
