{"id": "332630", "name": "The Professional \"Modern Warfare 2\" Player Multiple Choice Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Call of Duty Games", "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Sleight of Hand\" is one of the most popular Tier 1 Perks, and cuts reload time by half, a life-or-death difference in heavy gunfire. What advantage does \"Sleight of Hand Pro\" give the player? ", "correct": "Faster Aiming Down the Sights", "options": ["Stronger Riot Shield Melee", "Faster Knife Lunge Recovery", "No Falling Damage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaster Aiming Down the Sights.\n\n\t\"Sleight of Hand Pro\" is unlocked after getting 120 kills with \"Sleight of Hand\". Faster Aiming down the Sights is very useful for scoped rifles or guns with a visual aid, such as the red dot sight, as players need to be able to aim in order to get the full advantage of their weapon's attachment. In harsh fire fights, \"Sleight of Hand Pro\" can create a fast transition between aiming and reloading. \n"}, {"text": "\"Steady Aim\" is a tier 3 perk that is useful for players that fire from the hip often (shooting without aiming). \"Steady Aim Pro\" can be considered most useful for players that do what? ", "correct": "Use Scoped Rifles", "options": ["Use Grenade Launchers", "Use C4", "Employ Stealth Classes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUse Scoped Rifles.\n\n\t\"Steady Aim Pro\" is unlocked after a player kills 80 enemies while firing from the hip, and its effect is the ability to hold breath longer when scoped. This is extremely important for sniper rifles because steadying the scope requires the shooter to hold his breath, and \"Steady Aim Pro\" allows him to do so for extended periods of time, increasing accuracy and allowing him to achieve otherwise very difficult kills.With the exception of non-sniper rifles with a zoom scope attachment, the pro version is extremely incompatible with the original when using any single weapon. For this reason, \"Steady Aim Pro\" can only reach its full potential in a class with a primary Sniper and a secondary shotgun or machine pistol.\n"}, {"text": "\"Danger Close\" is a perk best suited for launchers, as it increases explosive damage. \"Danger Close Pro\", similarly increases damage inflicted on the enemy, but what kind?", "correct": "Killstreak Reward", "options": ["\"Danger Close Pro\" actually reduces explosive damage to the user.", "Sniper Rifle", "Knifing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKillstreak Reward.\n\n\t\"Danger Close Pro\" is unlocked after getting 100 Kills with Explosives using \"Danger Close\". With this pro perk, killstreak rewards become more powerful, and this is particularly useful for killstreaks such as the predator missile, stealth bomber, and AC-130, all three of which have the potential to get one hit multi-kills. Pave Lows and Chopper Gunners also become significantly more impressive. \n"}, {"text": "Many players use the heartbeat sensor in order to detect their enemies. Due to this, the \"Ninja\" perk has become useful to players interested in stealth classes, as any player with \"Ninja\" will not appear on enemy heartbeat sensors. \"Ninja Pro\" provides an added degree of stealth, but how?", "correct": "Player's footsteps become quieter", "options": ["Player becomes more camouflaged", "Player's weapon becomes silenced", "Player has the ability to \"pose\" as an enemy for a limited amount of time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlayer's footsteps become quieter.\n\n\t\"Ninja Pro\" is unlocked after the player kills 50 enemies at close range using \"Ninja\", and it allows the player to make almost no noise when walking or sprinting. While many may find this pro version perk to be useless, many console users use headsets in order to hear footsteps, and \"Ninja Pro\" offsets this advantage, and turns the enemy's headset against them, as they will be very dependent on it as a source of information. \n"}, {"text": "\"Hardline\" is a very popular perk among newer players, as it allows them to get killstreak rewards with one less kill. (Example: UAV can be called in after 2 kills instead of 3). This perk allows the game to be more fun for relatively inexperienced players who struggle to achieve significant killstreak rewards. \"Hardline Pro\" can also be helpful by allowing the player to do what?", "correct": "Get deathstreak support with one less death", "options": ["Get a better chance at a higher killstreak reward in a Care Package", "Get killstreak rewards with two less kills (with the exception of the UAV)", "Get to choose 4 killstreak rewards instead of 3"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGet deathstreak support with one less death.\n\n\t\"Hardline Pro\" is unlocked after the player calls in 40 killstreak rewards with \"Hardline\". Deathstreak support, which is \"help\" that the game gives players that die several times without getting a kill, become available with one less death. Deathstreaks include Copycat (the ability to copy the killer's class), Painkiller (Increased Health for 10 seconds after spawning), Martyrdom (Releasing a frag grenade upon death), and Final Stand (Getting a chance to kill the enemy even after fatal damage is inflicted). \n"}, {"text": "Another popular perk is \"Cold Blooded\", where the user is not intentionally affected by enemy killstreaks or thermal vision. \"Cold Blooded Pro\" adds a degree of stealth by not allowing the enemy to see what?", "correct": "The crosshair or red name when aimed at the player", "options": ["The player when completely prone", "The player's head", "The player when using a predator missile, chopper gunner, or AC-130"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe crosshair or red name when aimed at the player.\n\n\t\"Cold Blooded Pro\" is unlocked after the player destroys 40 killstreak rewards with \"Cold Blooded\", and is useful for \"playing dead\", as a completely prone player can appear to be dead from a distance if the cross-hair is not available to enemies. In addition, if an enemy feels that a player is hiding in a bush or behind a thin wall, the tendency would be to aim towards these areas with hopes of catching the red crosshair, but \"Cold Blooded Pro\" protects from this offensive strategy, and when combined with \"Ninja Pro\", the player becomes virtually undetectable except with the naked eye. \n"}, {"text": "\"Commando\" is a perk that increases the melee distance of knifes and riot shields so much that knifing can defeat assault rifles in relatively close quarter fights. What advantage does \"Commando Pro\" offer rushing players? ", "correct": "No Falling Damage", "options": ["Faster recovery from melee lunges", "Faster bomb planting/defusing", "Increased handgun damage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo Falling Damage.\n\n\t\"Commado Pro\" is unlocked after the player gets 20 melee kills with \"Commando\", and can sometimes save the player from death when jumping off cliffs and buildings when escaping enemies. \"Commando Pro\" allows the user to jump down with no consequences and can be useful when a player wants to shift his position drastically in a short period of time to either escape an enemy or flank another. \n"}, {"text": "Love Grenade Launchers but desperately want to silence your weapon? Luckily \"Bling\" is a perk that allows the player to have two attachments to the primary weapon, allowing players to double the effectiveness of one weapon. \"Bling Pro\" increases this advantage by doing what? ", "correct": "Allowing the player to have two attachments on the secondary weapon", "options": ["Allowing the player to have three attachments on the primary weapon", "Allowing the player to carry two different types of equipment", "Allowing the player to carry double the amount of equipment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAllowing the player to have two attachments on the secondary weapon.\n\n\t\"Bling Pro\" is unlocked when the user kills 250 enemies with a \"bling\" weapon, and therefore allows him to customize two attachments on the secondary as well. \"Bling Pro\" can be very useful for players who have gotten used to using a specific type of vision aid (ACOG scope or Red-Dot Sight) but feel the need to have a silenced weapon, a grenade launcher, or a heartbeat sensor. \"Bling Pro\" gives the player a \"free\" visual aid while preserving the other advantages the weapon may have. \n"}, {"text": "\"Scrambler\" jams any enemy radar near the user. It can be both an advantage, confusing the enemy, or a disadvantage, alerting the enemy of the player's proximity. However, \"Scrambler Pro\" adds only an advantage, by rendering which enemy equipment almost useless? ", "correct": "Claymores", "options": ["C4", "Frag Grenades", "Tactical Insertions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClaymores.\n\n\t\"Scrambler Pro\", similarly to \"Ninja Pro\" is unlocked after achieving 50 close range kills with \"Scrambler\". Enemy claymores will detonate at a delay when a player with \"Scrambler Pro\" triggers them, and this can be a very useful tactic for killing snipers or campers who do not watch their back because of their comfort at the availability of their Claymore mine. Also, claymore users typically rely on the sound of the claymore exploding and manage to kill their attacker before he gets to them, even if the claymore does not manage to kill him. \"Scrambler Pro\" erases this advantage as well. \n"}, {"text": "\"Lightweight\" allows the player to move 7% faster, but what underrated effect does the pro version provide? ", "correct": "The ability to aim faster after sprinting", "options": ["The ability to climb stairs faster", "The ability to switch weapons faster", "The ability to throw back grenades faster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe ability to aim faster after sprinting.\n\n\t\"Lightweight Pro\" can be unlocked after the player has sprinted 30 miles using \"Lightweight\" and is a very good complement to \"Marathon\" which allows unlimited sprint. \"Lightweight Pro\" allows faster aim after sprinting and although many may find this insignificant, it is a difference of life and death in rush games such as \"Capture the Flag\" and \"Search and Destroy\", especially the former since most players will be using speed classes in hopes of capturing a flag.In the event that both the enemy and the player are running, \"Lightweight Pro\"'s faster aiming will result it in being on par with an enemy equipped with \"Stopping Power\", but also with the added speed! \n"}]}
