{"id": "373003", "name": "The Letters Spell the Answer Quiz | Word Play | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", " Word Play", "Letter Quizzes"], "questions": [{"text": "Each clue comes in several parts. First, you must solve two clues found within a sentence. These will be clues indicating words that differ by only one letter. The first word will be one letter longer than the second. The answer, however, does not contain either of the words you solve from the clues. Rather, the answer will simply be the one letter that differs. For example, if the clue reads \"the GLUE was spilled in the GOOSE LIVER SPREAD\", the words indicated would be \"PASTE PATE\". However, the answer to type into the box would simply be the letter \"S\". But be warned: not all the answers are quite as simple as this one (fortunately, though, some are easier).\n\nThe MAGICIAN'S QUICK MOVEMENT was so MINUTE you could not tell where the card vanished to.\n\nRemember, the words in all capitals need solving first, and the words differ by only one letter. That letter is the answer, not the two words.", "correct": "E", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nE.\n\n\tSLEIGHT - SLIGHT = E\r For a magician, especially a close-up one, to be any good, he must master many techniques including such tricks as the Elmsley count and the false shuffle. However, nothing is quite as important as learning sleight of hand. Even the slightest of movements can be caught by the human eye, so it is imperative that the magician learn the ways of manipulation so as to make the slightest sleight he might. \n"}, {"text": "REUSING A PART OF A SONG IN A NEW RECORDING can be very pleasant; such as when I heard part of \"Hide and Seek\" in \"Whatcha Say\". It puts me in a good mood so I feel like planting a YOUNG TREE.\n\nRemember, the words in all capitals need solving first, and the words differ by only one letter. That letter is the answer, not the two words.", "correct": "M", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nM.\n\n\tSAMPLING - SAPLING = M\r Sampling is a music technique that involves using a part of a previous song in a new one. For instance, in Jason Derulo's 2009 song \"Whatcha Say\", the main chorus of the song is actually taken from Imogen Heap's 2005 song \"Hide and Seek\". Listen to both tracks if you wish to hear exactly how Jason Derulo \"sampled\" Imogen Heap's song.\r A sapling is, of course, a young tree. \n"}, {"text": "When I finally got into the ROUTINE of picking apples in the SMALL ORCHARD, the harvesting season was over.\n\nRemember, the words in all capitals need solving first, and the words differ by only one letter. That letter is the answer, not the two words.", "correct": "O", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nO.\n\n\tGROOVE - GROVE = O\r Of course, to water my COPSE, I used a NARROW TRENCH that stretched through the garden to water all my trees at once. The groove came in handy while working in the grove. \n"}, {"text": "I got very cold at the CINEMA, because the FURNACE stopped working while I was there. \n\nRemember, the words in all capitals need solving first, and the words differ by only one letter. That letter is the answer, not the two words.", "correct": "T", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nT.\n\n\tTHEATER - HEATER = T\r I usually get cold in a movie theater, so I always bring a jacket. But when the heater stopped working, I had wished I brought a heavier coat! \n"}, {"text": "MATCHING my socks had become much easier once I finished REDUCING the number of socks I owned.\n\nRemember, the words in all capitals need solving first, and the words differ by only one letter. That letter is the answer, not the two words.", "correct": "I", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nI.\n\n\tPAIRING - PARING = I\r I used to own nothing but black socks. Since they were all the same color and size, they were very easy to pair. However, once they all wore down, I had to buy new socks. I bought a bunch of multicolored socks, and because I store all my socks in a drawer mixed together, I found it difficult to find a pair. Later, I pared down my sock stockpile, and it became easier for me to pair two socks together every morning. \n"}, {"text": "As I listened to the lengthy CONTRACT BID, I wished he would just get to the MAIN POINT.", "correct": "C", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nC.\n\n\tPITCH - PITH = C\r Pitch has, of course, dozens of meanings. In this particular case, I was listening to a contract bid to cover the sloped roof with tar. Yes, it was in fact a pitch to pitch a pitched house. After what seemed like hours of talking, it seemed that the salesman would never reach the core, the pith, of his pitch. \n"}, {"text": "I would have to take the nasty medicine BY MOUTH if I were to ever RECOVER MY STRENGTH.\n\nRemember, the words in all capitals need solving first, and the words differ by only one letter. That letter is the answer, not the two words.", "correct": "O", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nO.\n\n\tORALLY - RALLY = O\r If I were to make it to the concert later that week, I would need to rally my strength once again. Seeing as I was ill, the doctor gave me medicine to be taken orally. Even though it was flavored orange to make it taste a little better, I could hardly swallow the vile vial. I felt I needed to rally a group of supporters just to choke the drench down. \n"}, {"text": "Because of their love of shiny objects, I often think it would be fun to put a TIARA on a RAVEN.\n\nRemember, the words in all capitals need solving first, and the words differ by only one letter. That letter is the answer, not the two words.", "correct": "N", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nN.\n\n\tCROWN - CROW = N\r Have you ever seen  a crow in a crown? I most certainly have not, but I should suppose it would be quite the sight! And then, if a group are all wearing royal headwear, wouldn't that make them an \"assassination\" of crows instead of a murder? (pun pun pun) \n"}, {"text": "Whilst playing a CARD GAME SIMILAR TO BRIDGE, I was doing marvelously well; but that didn't do me one IOTA of good since the other team was doing even better.", "correct": "S", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nS.\n\n\tWHIST - WHIT = S\r As it so happens, it does not matter how good you are at a card game if your opponents are just a smidge better. I guess you could say my wit of whist was a whit less than the wittier whisters.\r As a bonus clue, if you noticed, \"whist\" is just one letter less from the very first word of the clue, \"whilst\". \n"}, {"text": "Let us try something a bit different for the final question. If you take the answers to the first nine questions, you will notice that they spell a nine-letter word. However, in the spirit of this quiz, that is, of course, not the final answer. In order to discover the final answer, you must remove one of these letters, and then you get a 1991 hit by Mariah Carey. What is the name of the song, which is also a word for feelings like sadness and fear?\n\nEither the full word or simply the letter dropped from the answers.", "correct": "Emotions & C", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmotions & C.\n\n\tMariah Carey sang \"Emotions\" in 1991, and the song can be found on her album of the same name. \"Emotions\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Carey's fifth single to do so. This was quite a feat, in fact, because it was also her fifth single. This marked a new record; Mariah Carey became the first person to have her first five singles all become number one hits.\r The answers to the first nine questions spelled EMOTICONS. Removing the C, then, gave us the answer \"EMOTIONS\". Alternately, if you guessed the answer to be C, you were also correct - since the quiz asked for just the dropped letter, the answer \"C\" was also acceptable. \n"}]}
