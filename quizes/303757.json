{"id": "303757", "name": "Complicated Bible Verses Quiz | The Bible | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "The Bible", "Bible Word Play"], "questions": [{"text": "Ok, for this quiz, I will make Scriptures a bit more complicated.  For instance, the Scripture that says \"Jesus gave way to tears,\" can be made more difficult to understand.  I could say \"The Almighty's offspring squalled.\"  A bit more difficult, isn't it?  Ok, here is the first question.\n\n\"Inasmuch as the deific being was infatuated with the macrocosm in mass quantities, the deific being benefacted to us his transcendent excogitated shaveling.\"\n\nThis is only the first half of what Scripture?", "correct": "John 3:16", "options": ["1 John 3:16", "2 John 3:16", "3 John 3:16"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn 3:16.\n\n\tJohn 3:16 states: \"For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.\"  The first half of this Scripture, up through the word \"son,\" can be translated as what was written above.  That is much more complicated that we would EVER want to see in the Bible, isn't it? \n"}, {"text": "\"This betokens supertemporal existence, those ones' consumption of educational pieces of information about yourself, the transcendent befitting deific being, and about the single unit which you yourself gave to us, the Almighty God's stripling.\"\n\nWhat could this Scripture possibly be talking about?", "correct": "Taking in knowledge of God", "options": ["Living with Jesus in heaven", "Preaching the good news of God's kingdom", "The faithful and discreet slave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTaking in knowledge of God.\n\n\tBelieve it or not, I had just quoted John 17:3!  This Scripture says \"This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true god, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.\"  What a difference between those two phrasings of Scripture! \n"}, {"text": "\"At the incipiency, the deific being generated the empyrean and the globe.\"\n\nThis shouldn't be too bad.  What book of the Bible is this verse from?", "correct": "Genesis", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenesis.\n\n\tThis is actually the very first Scripture of the Bible, Genesis 1:1!  This Scripture simply states that \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\"  Of course, this is much simpler than saying that \"At the incipiency the deific being generated the empyrean and the globe.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Due to this fact the ophidian responded 'You yourself will, on the contrary to what you were told, forever keep on living.'\"\n\nWhat?!  What do you think this Scripture might be telling us?", "correct": "Satan is saying to Eve she will not die if she eats the forbidden fruit", "options": ["Satan is tempting Jesus to jump off the tower, so an angel will catch him and he will not die", "Satan is causing Job's livestock and children to die", "Satan is causing death to all who worship God"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSatan is saying to Eve she will not die if she eats the forbidden fruit.\n\n\tThis Scripture is a shorter verse found in Genesis 3:4.  This is the Scripture that says, \"And the serpent said, 'you will positively not die.'\"  Verse five continues on, \"'For God knows that in the very days of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be open and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"You yourself are permitted to be against manslaughter.\"\n\nYou may be able to tell what this Scripture is right away.  But what VERSE is this commandment in?", "correct": "Exodus 20:13", "options": ["Exodus 20:15", "Exodus 20:16", "Exodus 20:14"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExodus 20:13.\n\n\tYou may be aware that the Ten Commandments are located in Exodus 20.  You may have had a tough time figuring out the order of these commandments, and which verses they are in!  Exodus 20:13 simply states \"You must not murder.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Attract yourself nearer to the deific being, and the deific being will attract himself nearer to you yourself.\"\n\nThis is quite a common Scripture, but what exactly is it talking about?", "correct": "Drawing close to God", "options": ["Coming to Jesus so he can give you life's waters free", "Having peace and understanding", "Learning about and loving your God"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrawing close to God.\n\n\tThis Scripture I have obscured simply states, \"Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.\"  This is found in James 4:8.  The full Scripture reads: \"Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.  Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Also the deific being will erase each saline droplet from amongst those ones' ocular organs, to allow expiration to have no existence from now on, along with these, also not grieving, and also not commotion, not even a throe will have existence from now on.  The quondam items will have perished from the earth.\"\n\nWell, that was long!  What was this Scripture, do you think?", "correct": "Revelation 21:4", "options": ["Revelation 22:4", "Revelation 21:3", "Revelation 22:3"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRevelation 21:4.\n\n\tRevelation 21:3, 4 are very common Scriptures.  The verse focused on in this question is verse 4.  It says \"And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning, nor outcry, nor pain be anymore.  The former things have passed away.\"  Verse three begins with \"With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: 'Look!  The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples.  And God himself will be with them.'\" \n"}, {"text": "\"And the deific being proceeded to announce: 'We shall produce this anthropological being to appear as we do.\"\n\nWhat Scripture is this?  Do you know?", "correct": "Genesis 1:26", "options": ["Genesis 3:16", "Genesis 4:22", "Genesis 2:32"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenesis 1:26.\n\n\tThis Scripture is Genesis 1:26, where God says he is making man in his own image.  The full Scripture reads: \"And God went on to say: 'Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every moving animal that is moving upon the earth.'\" \n"}, {"text": "This is my favorite Scripture!\n\n\"Delectate in the aspiration.  Remain indefinitely in existence in oppression.  Proceed in invocation.\"\n\nWhat Scripture is that from, do you think?", "correct": "Romans 12:12", "options": ["Mark 4:4", "Psalms 119:119", "Isaiah 27:27"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRomans 12:12.\n\n\tRomans 12:12 states: \"Rejoice in the hope.  Endure under tribulation.  Persevere in prayer.\"  What a wonderful Scripture, do you not agree? \n"}, {"text": "\"Approach my body, each and every one of you who happens to be drudging and down-trodden, and I myself will vivify you.\"\n\nWhat a great Scripture to end with!  What is this saying, though?", "correct": "Jesus is saying he will help us carry our yoke", "options": ["Jesus is saying he is going to make you an animated cartoon", "Jesus is saying he will make us more lively", "Jesus is saying that he will resurrect us to give us life once more"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJesus is saying he will help us carry our yoke.\n\n\tMatthew 11:28 is this Scripture.  This Scripture tells us \"Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you.\"  Not only is Jesus saying he will help us carry our yoke, he is saying he will make it more enjoyable, and give us life's water to drink, free. \n"}]}
