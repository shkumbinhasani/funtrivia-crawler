As the curator thanks all of the curious patrons for attending, she reveals the first of two new installations-- Paul, the Illustrated Seal Boy.\rFortunately, this is just a fantasy in Stanley's mind.  He tells Maggie, in the motel in Jupiter, that he has the tanks ready and they just need to preserve and claim their corpse specimens.  She'll stay on the inside while Stanley keeps Elsa on the hook.  Maggie just doesn't want to murder anyone.  It's okay though, Stanley claims, since the freak show will be having a run of bad luck. \n"}, {"text": "Stanley claims to work for which of these?", "correct": "WBN", "options": ["Warner Brothers", "RKO", "MGM"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWBN.\n\n\tAwakening the day after Halloween, Gloria heads downstairs into the dining room to find Dora's body.  It becomes quickly apparent that she knows Dandy is responsible for killing the maid, and she tells him that she'll have to clean up his mess, as usual.  When she sends him off to his room, she doesn't notice his demeanour change as his back is turned.\rStanley arrives at Elsa's tent for a drink and a discussion about her future.  He promises that he works for WBN in television and she asserts that television isn't her dream.  Then again, however, it may be the future of media.  Elsa vows that motion pictures will remain, and she stays tentative on the deal. \n"}, {"text": "Maggie, giving Jimmy a palm reading, warns him against which of these?", "correct": "A shadowy man", "options": ["Trusting Elsa", "The lustre of greed", "Bad weather"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA shadowy man.\n\n\tJimmy worries as he practices his lines outside by the carousel moments before Maggie interrupts.  There's a full house in the big top tent so he's more nervous than usual, especially since they're there to see him, the local hero.  Maggie tries to calm Jimmy by reading his palm, but she uses the opportunity to warn him that there's a man in his future, a shadow, who he needs to stay away from.  She urges him to head north to New York, but he decides not to heed the fortune.\rWhen Jimmy heads backstage, Ethel worries that Dell is nowhere to be seen.  When he investigates his trailer, Desiree is home alone, drinking and remembering her nostalgic past. \n"}, {"text": "Who's booed offstage during their freak show performance?", "correct": "Elsa", "options": ["Dell", "Jimmy", "Bette/Dot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElsa.\n\n\tJimmy takes the time to comfort Desiree as she cries in her kitchen.  Jimmy, sinking into his own despair, complains that he couldn't do anything to save Meep, and it must've been all his own fault.  Des reminds him that he's one of the good guys as he leans in for a kiss.  To both of their surprise, they're both interested, and it's not long before they go further...until Des is severely hurt and Jimmy yells to the other freaks to get an ambulance. Ethel sends Jimmy to the stage to emcee while she brings Des to the doctor.  Jimmy does maintain his composure and introduces Elsa before her rendition of \"Life on Mars\" but, surprisingly, it's Elsa who has problems onstage, being unable to look past the unamused crowd, even cutting out her own music. Jimmy has to bring her offstage as the crowd throws popcorn at her.  Stanley takes the opportunity to remind her of his deal. \n"}, {"text": "Where was Desiree born?", "correct": "Philadelphia", "options": ["Topeka", "Baltimore", "New York City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\n\tEthel brings Des to her personal doctor, much to Des' surprise (as she's never been to a doctor before, what with her condition).  Des has to disclose that she was fooling around with Jimmy before she started bleeding, and though the doctor assumes that she was simply having her period, he soon discovers that she's not quite a hermaphrodite. This comes as a shock to Des who, having grown up as a boy in Philadelphia, ended up growing other parts, eventually becoming the Desiree she is today.  Her man parts were, quite possibly, created by excess testosterone and were never fully-functioning while her third breast was likely a result of the body's need to make more estrogen. The bleeding she experienced, she is told, was a miscarriage; she's more than capable of carrying a child. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Dora buried?", "correct": "In the garden on the Mott grounds", "options": ["In a cemetery plot", "She isn't; she's cremated", "In the swamp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the garden on the Mott grounds.\n\n\tBack at the Mott Estate, Gloria and Dandy tend to their new narcissus garden, dug by gardeners to sink twelve feet deep.  Of course, Dora's body rests at the bottom.  Dandy apologizes to his mother, but she says she knew it was only a matter of time; Dandy has the same sickness his father did, and it's typical of the affluent since cousins marry cousins to protect the money and the estates intact.  The inbreeding causes it.  Dandy asserts that he needs to express himself, and if she allows him to be an actor, he can do that.  They'll figure something out.\rBack at the freak show, Elsa dresses herself in anticipation of her publicity photos, but when she heads out to the car to meet with Stanley, he's already driving off with Bette and Dot. \n"}, {"text": "Stanley takes Bette and Dot out for a picnic.  Do they eat his pink cupcakes?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tStanley has a bit of a vision.  Taking the twins out for a picnic to discuss their future in TV, he offers them pink cupcakes, baked fresh and injected with poison.  Bette eats the cupcake, but Dot holds out.  It doesn't matter though; it's too late.  Bette, unable to breathe well, gets sicker and sicker until Dot is the only one alive.  Stanley, watching them on their deathbed, smothers her.  Their heads and upper torso are placed in formaldehyde and displayed at the museum.  He claims it was pneumonia that took them.\rOf course, this is only a vision.  When asked to eat the cupcake, neither accepts.  Both need to watch their figure, as Dot says, since they're going to be on TV. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Dell's secret fling?", "correct": "Andy", "options": ["Josh", "Mitch", "Joel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndy.\n\n\tDandy, working out in his room, practicing his acting, realizes that his powers are limitless.  The clown, he realizes, was put on Earth to guide him, but he will outlast the clown because he's more cunning and powerful.  He heads out to the local gay bar to pick his next victim.\rAt one of the tables, Dell has a drink with his secret fling, Andy, and they both argue.  Since Andy likes his job and Dell is married, it seems apparent that they can't be together.  When Dell leaves, Dandy sits down and makes a proposition. \n"}, {"text": "Desiree decides to leave Dell, opting to live where instead?", "correct": "Ethel's caravan", "options": ["Elsa's tent", "In a motel", "With Jimmy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEthel's caravan.\n\n\tAt the freak show, Elsa walks in on Bette and Dot discussing their prospective opportunity.  Elsa sides with Bette, saying that she wants the best for them and the best is Hollywood.  In fact, as Elsa lies, Stanley told her to mentor the girls.  In the morning, Elsa says, they have a private fitting with a seamstress in Jupiter.\rAs the lights shut down, Dell makes his way back to the trailer to find Des, back from the doctor's office.  She tells him the good news: she's 100% woman and she can have babies.  Dell, however, doesn't seem thrilled.  It's okay anyways since Des found out the truth from Ethel-- he's Jimmy's father.  Des announces that she's leaving him to live in Ethel's caravan, and soon she'll have surgery to remove her extra parts. \n"}, {"text": "Elsa, promising to bring Bette and Dot to a seamstress, brings them where instead?", "correct": "The Mott Estate", "options": ["To an abandoned shack", "Prison", "The airport"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mott Estate.\n\n\tDandy, feeling adventurous, brings Andy out to the clown's abandoned bus and tells him to strip down.  When Andy turns around, however, Dandy is wearing Twisty's face mask and brandishing a knife.  The fight doesn't take long; a few stabs later, Andy is incapacitated and Dandy is delighted.  He proceeds to hack up the body...with Andy still alive...and burn it away in a bath of acid.\rThe next morning, Gloria receives a call from Regina Ross, Dora's daughter, who never received her weekly call from her mother and is now concerned.  Gloria insists that Dora is simply busy and will call, perhaps in a month, when she has free time.  Regina is uncomfortable enough to ask to hang up.  When Gloria puts down the phone, Dandy returns, covered in blood.\rDell heads into town to speak to Desiree's doctor about the possible surgery.  Enraged, he breaks the doctor's hands and threatens his family.\rElsa, driving towards Jupiter, brings Bette and Dot to the Mott household instead.  She has a business proposition in mind. \n"}]}
