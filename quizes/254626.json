Lombardi won a MVP with the Reds in 1938, and Fisk was a 1972 Rookie of the Year with the Red Sox.  All the statistics (not just those shown) were pretty much offsetting for both Bench and Berra, but the fact that Yogi had all those top five MVP ballots, even with his star-studded Yankee team, carried him to this roster.\rSeasons played:   Bench 17, Berra 19, Fisk 24, Lombardi 17\rHits:             Bench 2048, Berra 2150, Fisk 2356, Lombardi 1792\r.300 seasons:     Bench 1, Berra 3, Fisk 2, Lombardi 10\rCareer Avg:       Bench .267, Berra .285, Fisk .269, Lombardi .306 \rHome runs:        Bench 389, Berra 358, Fisk 376, Lombardi 190\rRBIs:             Bench 1376, Berra 1430, Fisk 1330, Lombardi 990\rSeason MVPs:      Bench 2, Berra 3, Fisk 0, Lombardi 1\rTop Five MVPs:    Bench 4, Berra 7, Fisk 2, Lombardi 1\rRookie of Year:   Bench yes, Berra no, Fisk yes, Lombardi no\rCatching errors:  Bench 97, Berra 110, Fisk 155, Lombardi 143\rTop 10 Slugging:  Bench 5, Berra 9, Fisk 4, Lombardi 8\rWorld Series:     Bench 4, Berra 14, Fisk 1, Lombardi 2 \n"}, {"text": "With room for only one pitcher on this all-time roster, I selected this left-hander who won 20+ games in a season 13 times in his career, including six consecutive seasons.

In addition, strikeout records did not begin until 1910, more than halfway through Wagner's career.  Also, in baseball's early days, ballparks were not built for the home run ball.

Most parks today, 400 feet is approximately the centerfield line, with some foul lines at 330 feet. \n"}, {"text": "With a bevy of baseball immortals who have played in the outfield, this was an extremely difficult task, until taking 11 left fielding  greats and comparing their accomplishments in their career side by side.
