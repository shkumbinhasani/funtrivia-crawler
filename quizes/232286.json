{"id": "232286", "name": "I Was a 'Smash Brother' Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games Q-S", "Super Smash Brothers Games"], "questions": [{"text": "\"I was a hidden 'Smash Brother' in the N64 game, and in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", I was one of the default characters.  Using my baseball bat and yo-yo in Smash-A attacks, my opponents will never see what's coming.  Which 'Smash Brother' am I?\"", "correct": "Ness", "options": ["Roy", "Young Link", "Luigi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNess.\n\n\tNess, from the popular SNES game \"Earthbound\" was one of the four hidden characters in the game \"Super Smash Bros.\", but unlike Jigglypuff and Luigi, he became playable in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\".  This character uses his powerful PSI moves (like PK Fire and PK Thunder) to inflict damage on opponents with the B-button, and he has the ability to heal himself with down-B when others use projectiles or certain powers against him (eg. Pikachu's Thunder attack or Fox's gun). \n"}, {"text": "\"I originally came from the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series of games, and I did not appear in the first \"Super Smash Bros.\" game.  In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", I was a hidden character, and my attacks often caused me to inflict damage on myself.  Which 'Smash Brother' was I?\"", "correct": "Pichu", "options": ["Mewtwo", "Pikachu", "Jigglypuff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPichu.\n\n\tPichu is one of the many hidden characters in the game, and one of the three hidden \"Pok\u00e9mon\" characters (of four in total).  To obtain Pichu, one must either play 200 vs. matches or beat event stage #37 (\"Legendary Pok\u00e9mon\").  Pichu will damage himself a couple of percent for every electric-type attack that he uses and he's the lightest character in the game.  This causes Pichu to be very fast, but he's also the likeliest to be knocked off of the battlefield. \n"}, {"text": "\"In this game, you can see me outside of my F-Zero racer and in the battle arena.  Although I was often perceived as a fast character, some of my attacks and movements were compared to Ganondorf's in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\".  Which 'Smash Brother' was I?\"", "correct": "Captain Falcon", "options": ["Falco", "Fox", "Samus Aran"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Falcon.\n\n\tCaptain Falcon began as a secret character in the N64 game, but progressed to become one of the default characters in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\".  Captain Falcon is described as the fastest character though many of his attacks (like Falcon Punch) are quite slow despite the fact that they can be powerful.  Ganondorf has many of the same types of attacks, but he's described as one of the slowest characters in the game.  Captain Falcon first came from the \"F-Zero\" series which has spanned many of Nintendo's systems starting with the SNES. \n"}, {"text": "\"I'm was probably the most mysterious of the bunch, often bringing bacon and numbered signs onto the playing field.  Either you could obtain me after 1,000 vs. matches, or you could have gotten every character first.  Which 'Smash Brother' was I?\"", "correct": "Mr. Game and Watch", "options": ["Mewtwo", "Kirby", "Dr. Mario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Game and Watch\n\n\tEither way, Mr. Game and Watch is probably going to be the last character you obtain in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\".  Either you can go through an endless thousand vs. matches, or you can get all twenty-four characters before him and beat the break the targets games with a combined total of 12 minutes.  Mr. Game and Watch is from the handheld Game and Watch system, and you can unlock both a Game and Watch level and the character himself. \n"}, {"text": "\"Due to my appearance, I may have seemed weak on the battlefield, but one of my moves could throw you off the arena.  The only problem was that I fell asleep every time I used it!  Which 'Smash Brother' was I?\"", "correct": "Jigglypuff", "options": ["Kirby", "Luigi", "Pichu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJigglypuff.\n\n\tJigglypuff will most likely be the earliest unlockable character you'll acquire in the game since all you need to do is beat a single-player adventure on any difficulty (in both \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\").  Jigglypuff may look weak,  but this character will deal some powerful blows if she gets in a few hits.  She also has the ability to sing.  If Jigglypuff uses her Rest technique efficiently, even the strongest player won't have a chance since it will fling opponents right across the battlefield. \n"}, {"text": "\"Using my bow and fire arrows, I was able to slash and bash my opponents off of the playing field.  After a hard battle, there was nothing like giving a little cheer and drinking a bottle of fresh milk.  Which 'Smash Brother' was I?\"", "correct": "Young Link", "options": ["Dr. Mario", "Link", "Zelda/Sheik"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoung Link.\n\n\tThe Young Link character was modeled after the Link that players become in the beginning of \"Ocarina of Time\" and throughout \"Majora's Mask\" (both for N64).  He features many techniques similar to the regular Link's but there are some subtle differences like the fire arrow.  To unlock Young Link as a character, you need to play Classic mode with ten of the original (default) characters of the game.  You must include Link and Zelda in this total.  Either that, or you can play 500 vs. matches. \n"}, {"text": "\"During battles, I used the Super Mushroom as my symbol.  Luckily, players never needed to unlock me, and if I ever got into a pickle, Toad could always protect me.  Which 'Smash Brother' was I?\"", "correct": "Peach", "options": ["Bowser", "Mario", "Luigi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeach.\n\n\tPeach was one of the few female characters introduced in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", and in the first \"Super Smash Bros.\" game, Samus was the only female character.  Peach can used Toad to block harmful attacks if she needs the protection, and she can also use her parasol to glide to safety.  In one attack, she will pull an object from the ground, much like players did in \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" (NES), and she'll throw it at an enemy. \n"}, {"text": "\"Although I was one of the slowest characters on the battlefield, I was one of the strongest.  With my dark magic powers, I could knock an opponent off the screen in one powerful punch.  Although I had a sword in other games, it was not used in this series.  Which 'Smash Brother' was I?", "correct": "Ganondorf", "options": ["Roy", "Link", "Marth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGanondorf.\n\n\tGanondorf is one of the most infamous characters from the \"Legend of Zelda\" series, and his dark powers allowed him to rule over the land of Hyrule in \"Ocarina of Time\".  In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", he can be unlocked through an event match, and he features many moves similar to Captain Falcon's (this is why he's called a clone character).  Despite nearly identical moves, Ganondorf is a stronger opponent.  However, Ganondorf is one of the slowest characters in the game, and it's a huge disadvantage. \n"}, {"text": "\"I was unlocked in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", but to do this, players had to use Mario and finish the single player classic mode without continuing.  Which 'Smash Brother was I?\"", "correct": "Dr. Mario", "options": ["Kirby", "Luigi", "Marth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Mario\n\n\tOver the years, Dr. Mario has starred in many of his own games on different systems, but in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", he may be out of his league.  With attacks like Mario's, Dr. Mario is somewhat of a clone character, but he stays true to his series and throws pills rather than fireballs.  To unlock Luigi, one must complete the first level of adventure mode with a 2 in the seconds column of the timer, and then they must beat Luigi in the following level. \n"}, {"text": "\"I appeared in a game alongside another one of my fellow 'Smash Brothers', and I never appeared in the first installment of the series.  Using my laser gun, I could shoot enemies from a distance, though I was quite quick with close-combat as well.  Which 'Smash Brother' was I?\"", "correct": "Falco", "options": ["Samus", "Fox", "Captain Falcon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalco.\n\n\tFalco is from the \"Star Fox\" series (along with the character, Fox), and he's known as the best pilot.  In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", Falco is quite speedy, but Fox's laser gun shoots much faster than Falco's.  To unlock Falco, a player must beat 100-Man Melee mode.  An easy way to do this is to use Donkey Kong to smash the ground during the whole match with his Down-B move.  If you're not skilled with Donkey Kong, you may have a tough time battling Falco after this. \n"}]}
