{"id": "305894", "name": "\"Dollhouse\": \"Ghost\" Quiz | Dollhouse | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Dollhouse"], "questions": [{"text": "In the first scene of the show, a nervous young American woman - the future Echo - is pacing frantically as a calm Englishwoman tells her she has a chance to start over. What is the \"real\" Echo's name before she becomes a doll?", "correct": "Caroline", "options": ["Davina", "Eliza", "Sierra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaroline.\n\n\tCaroline (Eliza Dushku) is clearly in a desperate situation; she insists that she was just trying to help people, and it's clearly gone terribly wrong, although we get no sense of just who or what is after her. Adelle DeWitt (Olivia Williams) has clearly seen situations like this before. She's trying to get Caroline to sign some sort of a contract, and tells her it's her best chance: she can have a \"clean slate.\" \r Caroline is not impressed: \"You ever try and clean an actual slate?\" she argues. \"You always see what was on it before.\" Of course, a slate can be wiped clean - but, as we'll discover later, the same does not appear to be true of the human mind. \n"}, {"text": "Some unspecified amount of time later, the woman we know as Echo is riding a motorcycle at night. She falls off, foolishly removing her helmet to give TV viewers a good look at her face (kids: don't try this at home!), and then races after her friends. Where are they going?", "correct": "Into a restaurant where a birthday party is being held", "options": ["Away from the shadowy figures trying to recruit Echo into the Dollhouse", "To a deserted highway that's a great location for drag races", "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInto a restaurant where a birthday party is being held.\n\n\tThe restaurant is lavishly decorated with East Asian art and a \"Happy birthday\" banner. Strangely, no one seems to react much when the motorcyclists come riding straight in - this dramatic entrance is apparently par for the course. Echo wastes no time getting into a rather provocative dress so that she can dance with Matt, the birthday boy.It quickly becomes clear that they're in the early stages of a relationship, and she's surprised and pleased when he gives her a little gold heart on a chain. So it's all the more odd when, after he leaves for a drink, she gets up and walks away - out of the restaurant, down the street, and into a black van waiting at the curb. \n"}, {"text": "Excited and bubbly at having found \"something real\" in the man she spent the weekend with, Echo is looking forward to her \"treatment.\" This seems to consist of lying down in a dentist-style chair and being zapped - we see Echo's memories played back in reverse, all the way back to infancy. What does Echo say after the treatment?", "correct": "\"Did I fall asleep?\"", "options": ["\"When can I see him again?\"", "\"Do you think he likes me?\"", "\"Who am I?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Did I fall asleep?\".\n\n\tWe see later that this is her response after every treatment - she's been programmed to follow a script. Topher Brink (Fran Kranz), the scientist who developed the technology used by the Dollhouse to wipe the dolls' personalities, does his work - cleaning her slate after every engagement - and, as the docile and incurious mind-wiped Echo comes back up, she asks, \"Did I fall asleep?\" Topher replies, \"For a little while,\" and she leaves, satisfied.\r Topher is clearly uninterested in Echo as a human being; she's merely a convenient vessel for what he obviously thinks of as his genius. We see here, though, that her handler, Boyd Langton (Harry Lennix), is much more protective of her and concerned about how the Dollhouse is using her - too concerned, perhaps? \n"}, {"text": "We soon cut to the reason for Echo's next assignment. A small girl, about ten years old, is kidnapped from her home as she's on the phone negotiating TV privileges with her father. Soon, the father is in Adelle's sunny office, asking for help in the form of an \"Active.\" What role does he want the Active to fill?", "correct": "Negotiator", "options": ["Detective", "Bodyguard", "Search-and-rescue commando"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNegotiator.\n\n\tGabriel Cristejo (Kurt Caceres) is a desperate man. A Mexican businessman, he and his daughter Davina live in a well-patrolled U.S. mansion in part to avoid the risk of kidnapping - so this is a longtime nightmare come true. He's willing to pay the money (five million dollars) that the kidnappers have asked for; he's willing to obey their instructions not to go to the police; but, terrified of losing his daughter, he seeks a negotiator who will make things go \"like clockwork.\" Adelle, while warning him of the risks, says that they can provide. \n"}, {"text": "The next major character we meet is Paul Ballard, an FBI agent persuaded that the fabled \"Dollhouse\" is real, and represents the very worst in human trafficking. How do his immediate superiors regard his efforts to track down the Dollhouse?", "correct": "They think that he is indulging in paranoid fantasies.", "options": ["They worry that he will get the Bureau into an untenable geopolitical situation.", "They warn him that some very high-ranking figures in the government want the investigation squelched.", "They support his investigation fully, assigning him half a dozen agents to help."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey think that he is indulging in paranoid fantasies.\n\n\tThe meeting with his superiors is not going well for Agent Ballard (Tahmoh Penikett) - and in case we were having trouble telling from the dialogue alone, the scene is interspersed with quick cuts to Ballard fighting hard in a boxing ring. He's been on the \"Dollhouse\" case for over a year, and he doesn't have much to show for it. (In fact, as one of his superiors drily notes, despite harassing lawmakers and disrupting other investigations, \"The only legal action you've successfully followed through on is your divorce.\") The other agents believe that the Dollhouse does not exist; it's an urban legend, and Ballard's intense inquiries are starting to interfere with other, more believable investigations. They're only letting him continue because someone higher up believes in the Dollhouse, too, but they're warning him to ease up on the investigation. \r Of course, this is television, and their warnings naturally go unheeded. \n"}, {"text": "Back at the Dollhouse, Echo has been primed with a new personality for her role. She believes her name is Eleanor Penn, and her look is now distinctly no-nonsense. Boyd is surprised that she has to wear glasses now. What other disadvantage has Topher given her?", "correct": "Stress-induced asthma", "options": ["A pronounced limp", "An allergy to shellfish", "A smoking habit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStress-induced asthma.\n\n\tApparently, \"Eleanor Penn's\" nearsightedness comes along with her new personality imprint, which changes the way her brain processes the information coming from her eyes. The stress-induced asthma works in a similar way. Each one is a souvenir from one of the many personalities that Topher wove together to create Eleanor, the perfect negotiator (despite Gabriel Cristejo's initial doubts on seeing her). As we'll see later in the episode, it might have been a good idea for Topher to do some more filtering. \n"}, {"text": "We're back to Agent Ballard, who is at a nightclub with a Plan. He's watching a glib young Russian man who he thinks has connections with the Borodin crime family, and follows him to the bathroom in order to have a private conversation - at gunpoint. What does Ballard demand that the young man do?", "correct": "Find out where the Dollhouse is and inform Ballard", "options": ["Assassinate the man who runs the Dollhouse", "Steal bookkeeping records related to the Dollhouse", "Help Ballard volunteer to become a Doll"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFind out where the Dollhouse is and inform Ballard.\n\n\tComing up behind the young man - whose name is Anton Lubov, and who is played by Enver Gjokaj - when he's in a vulnerable position, Agent Ballard holds a gun to the back of his neck and begins by insisting that he say the word \"dollhouse.\" Unsurprisingly, Lubov cooperates: \"Dollhouse! Dollhouse! It's fun to say. Dollhouse!\" Knowing that the Borodin family is involved with human trafficking and that Lubov is involved with the Borodins, Ballard believes that Lubov can get the information he needs and help him crack the case.\r Ballard likes to call Lubov by his last name, which is more interesting than it might seem. It might be what Ballard does to everyone, or it might be a way to assert dominance - since Lubov is most commonly seen in Russia as a woman's first name. Curious, that ... \n"}, {"text": "Time passes, and arrangements for an exchange are made with the kidnappers. Echo and the girl's father stand at a dock and hand over eight million dollars - and then Echo realizes that the handoff is going to go wrong. What tips her off?", "correct": "She recognizes one of the kidnappers.", "options": ["She sees blood on a kidnapper's shoe.", "She realizes that the girl on the boat is not Davina Cristejo.", "She sees a bomb on the boat."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe recognizes one of the kidnappers.\n\n\tOne of the personality profiles that went into creating Eleanor Penn was from a woman who was herself kidnapped as a girl, at the age of 9 - and she recognizes one of Davina's kidnappers as the man who abused her terribly during that time. He'd killed his co-conspirators to take the girl for himself, hurt her for months, and left her for dead in a river. Seeing him again, Echo is sure that the self-styled \"Ghost\" intends the same thing for Davina. \r Unfortunately, her stress-induced asthma kicks in as soon as she recognizes her abuser. She grabs for her inhaler, drops it, can't function - but when Gabriel tries to help her, she manages to tell him not to let them back on the boat, because they aren't going to return the girl. He tries to stop them, but is shot, as is the lead kidnapper; Boyd, whose primary mission is always to preserve the Dollhouse's secrecy, swoops in to extract Echo. \n"}, {"text": "On the way back to the Dollhouse for her treatment - and what a time to have your mind wiped! - Echo pulls herself together and starts trying to figure out how they can find Davina. She realizes that the child must have known one of the kidnappers already. Who does this kidnapper turn out to be?", "correct": "Davina's science teacher", "options": ["Davina's uncle", "One of the Cristejos' security guards", "Gabriel's secretary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavina's science teacher.\n\n\tEarlier in the episode, Echo had managed a phone call with the kidnappers, and they put Davina on the line. The little girl had mentioned that one of the kidnappers wore a mask whenever he was with her - leading Echo to surmise that he must have been concealing his face out of concern that he would be recognized. One of the kidnappers had also mentioned a schoolteacher. When this insight is shared with the Dollhouse higher-ups, they put their considerable intelligence-gathering team into play and discover that Davina's science teacher has not been to work in over two weeks. Interesting!\r Boyd is deeply worried that \"Eleanor Penn's\" personality will be erased before the child can be saved, and he makes an emotional appeal to Adelle to let Echo remain Eleanor for a little while - after all, he points out, she likes to say that the Dollhouse exists \"to help people.\" When he arrives in Topher's lab to find Echo just rising from the chair, he fears the worst - until, in a very nice touch, she reaches for her glasses. Perhaps she was wiped and re-imprinted (with a touch less asthma, maybe?); perhaps it was just a placebo treatment; we never find out. \n"}, {"text": "Once they've established the identity of one of the kidnappers, they realize where Davina has been taken - to a remote shack on property owned by his sister. A determined Echo bangs on the door and warns two of the criminals that their comrade plans to kill them. What does she do to persuade them that they should listen to her?", "correct": "She tells them that they've put Davina in the refrigerator.", "options": ["She shows them a copy of their comrade's badge - he's a federal agent.", "She shows them an additional two million dollars in cash.", "She threatens them with a machine gun."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe tells them that they've put Davina in the refrigerator.\n\n\tApparently, the Ghost's modus operandi is to get involved with the kidnapping of a young girl; wait until his companions are distracted, usually by counting the money; and then kill the fellow kidnappers and make off with the girl. But there was one, Echo explains, whom \"he dumped in the river before he was sure she was dead\" - and this girl, who eventually committed suicide, is the part of \"Eleanor Penn\" that remembers her abuse at the Ghost's hands and provides the detail about keeping the child in the refrigerator.\r The Ghost hits her, but she is unfazed: repeating the line he once taunted her with, she tells him, \"You can't fight a ghost.\" The other two kidnappers, persuaded by her tale, turn their guns on him, and Echo runs to the refrigerator to free Davina. They're almost out the door when another Doll - Sierra, whom we saw receiving her initial personality wipe earlier in the episode - shows up with a full combat team and kills the other kidnappers.\r Job well done, Echo and Sierra return to the Dollhouse for their \"treatments,\" and we learn that Davina's father looks likely to survive. And that's a wrap! Thank you for joining me for Episode One of \"Dollhouse\"; I hope you've enjoyed the ride! \n"}]}
