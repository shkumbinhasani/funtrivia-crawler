{"id": "335168", "name": "\"Audition\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "According to Brittany, how was her summer vacation spent?", "correct": "Lost in the sewers", "options": ["Teaching squirrels how to sing showtunes", "In the back of a Mexican pick-up truck", "She can't remember"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLost in the sewers.\n\n\tComing back from the summer break, Jacob Ben Israel plans to post a video on his blog about 'Glee's Big Gay Summer'.  He begins by interviewing Rachel and Finn, who are still an item after their revelations of love during Regionals.  Will is asked about his lackluster song choices from relatively bad genres while Puck is asked about his remaining feelings for Quinn. Quinn is asked about her 'bastard child' while Santana says that her summer was uneventful.  Brittany sets the record straight about her summer vacation- she was lost in the sewers.  Tina and Mike Chang try to cover up their blossoming relationship and Will is asked to stop rapping. Kurt gets a slushie in the face before the video comes to an end.  Seems like not much has changed. \n"}, {"text": "According to Sue, some of the girls waiting to sign up for Cheerios try-out did which of these things?", "correct": "Worshiped a possum carcass as their lord", "options": ["Seized up at the last moment in fear", "Accidentally knocked over the Glee sign-up sheet", "Transferred from a Russian circus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorshiped a possum carcass as their lord.\n\n\tIt being the beginning of the year, students are signing up for extracurricular activities and despite there being a lot of people interested in Chemistry Club and Fruit Sculpture Club, no one really wants into New Directions, even without try-outs.  The Cheerios sign-up sheet, on the other hand, has had a line-up forming since late July.  Sue received a court summons for child endangerment; apparently, some of the girls worshiped a possum carcass as their lord while one ate a pigeon.  Nevertheless, she anticipates tons of applicants for herself and not Glee Club because no one wants to join a club that anyone can get into.  She also states that she's glad she and Will are friends because she doesn't need to bring down New Directions- Will is doing that on his own.\rPrincipal Figgins calls Sue and Will into his office to notify them that he will be cutting their budgets by 10% to give money to the football team and athletics department.  Over the summer, Coach Tanaka had a nervous breakdown and was replaced by Ms. Shannon Beiste, the new gym teacher.  Beiste won several consecutive football championships and she's an asset to the usually-mediocre McKinley High team.  Sue tries to assert her dominance, but finds it's hard to get through to her new opposition. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the only Glee Club member not to return from New Directions' first year?", "correct": "Matt", "options": ["Mike", "Blaine", "Noah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt.\n\n\tOn Glee Club's first meeting, Will reads comments on Jacob Ben Israel's and everyone recognizes the negativity still associated with their group.  Unfortunately, so does everyone else, and despite the fact that the gang has bonded over the year, they need another member to meet the minimum requirement for any of the competitions; Matt, one of the footballers from the previous year, transferred to another school and they only have eleven people. Because Nationals are in New York this year, the group decides to bring a new song out of their arsenal to perform in front of the school.  Putting on their hip-hop attire, New Directions hits the school with their rendition of Jay-Z and Alicia Keys' \"Empire State of Mind\".  Although it seems that a few students are interested, the song doesn't get the response they all hope for. \n"}, {"text": "What country is Sunshine Corazon from?", "correct": "The Philippines", "options": ["China", "Japan", "Taiwan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Philippines.\n\n\tWill is concerned about the lack of interest in Glee Club, but Sue clues him in on what may be a larger issue.  With Beiste in picture, budgets will get slashed left and right and she needs to be stopped.  Both agree to set their sights on toppling her.\rMeanwhile, Finn puts up sign-up forms for Glee Club in the locker room to find a new student singing in the showers (like Will found him singing in the first episode of season 1).  While the new kid sings Poison's \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\", Finn starts thinking of ways to recruit him.  Rachel's sign-up sheets are a little less about Glee Club and more about herself.  She puts some up in the girls' bathroom and meets with Sunshine Corazon, a foreign exchange student from The Philippines (where, according to Rachel, it's always sunny) who seemed interested during the gang's song in front of the school.  Soon, both of them have a singing battle in the bathroom to Lady Gaga and Beyonce's \"Telephone\"...until Sue comes in and tells them to shut up.  Sunshine considers the singing fun, but Rachel is surprised she can actually sing quite well and leaves, telling her not to tell anyone about what happened. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Mike and Tina fall in love over the summer?", "correct": "Asian camp", "options": ["Chinese restaurant", "Summer school", "Sheets 'N' Things"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsian camp.\n\n\tIn the locker room, Beiste isn't thrilled about the Glee sign-up sheets and tells everyone they're cut from the team; they all have to start fresh and prove their worth.  This happens just as a pizza delivery guy walks in with twenty-five 'everything pizzas' and she is forced to pay.  It turns out that this was a prank brought on by Sue and Will, but it kind of backfires.  Beiste pays the cost willingly and feeds the football team...and then offers slices to Sue and Will.\rArtie speaks to Finn about getting on the football team.  It turns out that Mike and Tina fell in love over the summer while counseling at Asian camp and she broke it off with Artie.  Now, to get her back, Artie feels he needs to be on the team and get abs.  Finn is hesitant to get him to join because of the wheelchair, but Artie reasons that if he were pushed in his heavy, metal wheelchair, he'd be like a battering ram.  This piques Finn's interest and he decides to help.  Shortly after this, they meet Sam Evans, the new boy, who they have perform with them.  He decides to perform \"Billionaire\" by Travie McCoy and Bruno Mars with the other guys backing him up.  After their jam session, he decides to come back. \n"}, {"text": "Who is immediately cut from the football team by the new coach?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Mike", "Sam", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tRachel approaches Kurt and Mercedes about Sunshine and states her plan.  She claims that adding her to Glee forces everyone else to run the risk of not having solos, so she paid Karofsky and the bullies to slushie them outside their lockers to scare her out of joining.  Rachel thinks this is the noble thing to do, but the others think it's awful and selfish.  Rachel apologizes and gives 'directions' to the try-outs to poor Sunshine.\rIn the staff room, Sue and Will purposely go out of their way to deny Beiste a seat.  When Will goes out of his way to stop her, she comments that he heard he was a cool, down-to-earth guy who would accept her as a new friend, but she was wrong.  In the locker room, Beiste cries before the guys come in.  Finn suggests Artie for the team, but she thinks he's purposely making fun of her.  She cuts Finn from the team immediately. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these students received breast augmentation surgery over the summer?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Quinn", "Brittany", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\tIn the gymnasium, Sue has her cheer tryouts and Quinn steps up to reapply for her position on the squad.  While Sue is initially hesitant, Quinn makes an offer she can't refuse and is let back on the team.  The next person to apply turns out to be Finn (because he wants to be something), so Sue informs Will.  Will, Finn, and Beiste end up in Figgins' office discussing the cut.  Beiste argues that she's allowed to make a snap judgment about Finn the same way Will made a snap judgment about her, so he apologizes for what he did so that she won't take it out on Finn.  Nothing comes of the meeting, though.\rIn Sue's office, Santana is sat down to discuss her recent enhancement surgery and Sue's no-plastic policy.  Santana claims that she simply wanted people to notice her more, but Sue puts her on the bottom of the pyramid (so that her \"exploding sandbags\" will cushion everyone's falls) and gives the head cheerleader spot to Quinn.  Quinn tries on her new uniform and she finds her spot back on top. \n"}, {"text": "Sue forces which Glee member to lie to try to get Coach Beiste in trouble?", "correct": "Brittany", "options": ["Finn", "Mercedes", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrittany.\n\n\tWhen Quinn walks down the halls in her new uniform, she's attacked by Santana who knows it was her that told Sue about the boob job.  The two fight each other until Will breaks them up.  Will and the kids wait in the choir room for people to show for try-outs, but no one comes, not even Sunshine or Sam.\rIn the Principal's Office, Figgins has a meeting with Sue, Brittany, and Beiste when Will walks in.  It turns out that Sue convinced Brittany to claim that Beiste touched her inappropriately.  Will convinces Brittany to tell the truth so that she doesn't ruin Beiste's life.  After the meeting, Sue calls Will weak before he's stopped in the hall by Mike and Tina. \n"}, {"text": "Who gets the quarterback position in the end of the episode?", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Puck", "Finn", "Artie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tThe newly partnered Mike and Tina tell the truth about what Rachel did to Sunshine.  Evidently, rather than give directions to the choir room for the try-outs, Rachel directed their prospective member to a crackhouse.  Rachel once again claims she did it for everyone else's sake.  She's asked to make it right and she apologizes to Sunshine, telling her to meet everyone in the auditorium the next day.\rFor her audition, Sunshine takes the stage to perform the song \"Listen\" from \"Dreamgirls\".  The performance is very well-received by the Glee Club who accepts her right off the bat.  Rachel is still visibly shaken by the quality of Sunshine's voice and stage presence, but she can't deny the power behind her.\rWill finds Beiste in the staff room the next day and apologizes for his actions.  After everyone still shied away from joining Glee Club, he realized that they were still outsiders, but that was no excuse for his actions.  Sue also claims to want to make a piece offering (in the form of dog poop cookies) but, when he realizes that Will is turning on her, she cuts off their friendship.\rIn the locker room, Finn asks Sam why he didn't show for the audition.  It turns out that everyone talks negative about Glee and he doesn't want to join, so Sam stayed away to ensure that he would get popular.  It turns out he also made the team...in Finn's old spot. \n"}, {"text": "Does Sunshine join New Directions?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWill finds Sunshine at her locker and officially welcomes her, but he's stopped by Dustin Goolsby, the new coach of Vocal Adrenaline (last year's champions).  It turns out they offered her a condo and green card for her mother in exchange for her spot on their team.  She took the offer because while she wanted to join McKinley's Glee Club, she was worried about Rachel making her life horrible.  It was also soon discovered that Sue was the one who made the call to Carmel High and got Sunshine noticed by Vocal Adrenaline.\rFinn discusses the problem with Rachel.  She screwed it up.  She tells Finn to break up with her and get it over with, but he won't do that; he's also unpopular now, so he knows how it feels.  He does say she needs to apologize for the sabotage, even if she claims she did it for the team.  She needs to own up because she clearly did it for herself.  Before she can apologize, she decides she needs alone time, so she heads to the auditorium to close the episode with \"A Chorus Line's\" \"What I Did For Love\".  Artie watches on as Tina and Mike show their love for one another, Quinn stands tall while Santana shows her discomfort on the bottom, and Rachel enters the choir room. \n"}]}
