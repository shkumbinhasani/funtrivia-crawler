{"id": "285220", "name": "Citizens of \"The Curious Village\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games L-P", "Professor Layton Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Who is Professor Layton's antagonist?", "correct": "Don Paolo", "options": ["Inspector Chelmey", "Deke", "Baron Reinhold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon Paolo.\n\n\tThroughout the bulk of the mystery investigated by Professor Layton and his assistant, Luke, Don Paolo is disguised as the famous Inspector Chemley, in town to solve a murder mystery.  When Layton's confrontation with the impostor inspector comes to a climax, Don Paolo rips off his mask, reveals himself, and escapes out the window in Reinhold Manor. Don Paolo doesn't return until the end of the game to attack Layton and Luke in the cottage on the top of the tower in the north end of town.  Using a device constructed with odds and ends in the luxurious cottage, Layton is able to escape with the Reinhold heiress and fly down to the streets of St. Mystere. In doing this, he also destroys Don Paolo's attack ship.  Although Don Paolo vows to return, Layton is safe until then.  People may recognize Paolo by his stereotypical 'evil mustache'. \n"}, {"text": "If riddles disappear from St. Mystere, who can Layton visit to complete them?", "correct": "Granny R", "options": ["Aunty R", "No one; he misses out on them", "Mother R"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGranny R.\n\n\tGranny R's house is in the town square, and although Layton and Luke can't access it immediately, it will be introduced after the first few chapters of the game.  When Layton and Luke enter her residence, they will find her standing outside a small shack.  After a short introduction, Granny R will allow you to enter the house within the house and play whatever riddles you may have missed along the puzzle route.  If you happened to play them all throughout the quest, then there won't be anything inside, but if you've missed a substantial amount of riddles, then there can be multiple rooms inside the shack.\rOther than for this reason, Granny R never seems to leave her house, and despite the fact that she houses riddles, she never has an original one that she gives to Layton. \n"}, {"text": "Who is Claudia's owner?", "correct": "Lady Dahlia", "options": ["Ingrid", "Agnes", "Beatrice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLady Dahlia.\n\n\tAfter the death of Baron Reinhold, Reinhold Manor was placed into the hands of Lady Dahlia, Reinhold's second wife.  Although Lady Dahlia was supposed to be a spitting image of Reinhold's first wife, the Baron's daughter never took to her, and was placed in the cottage at the top of the tower.  Lady Dahlia was the one who sent out for Professor Layton in the first place, asking him to be the one to search for the treasure behind the Golden Apple. As the main objective progresses, it turns out that Lady Dahlia is stubborn and demanding, and Professor Layton and Luke must go out in search of her cat, Claudia, when she runs away at the sound of the rumbling tower. By the time Claudia is returned (at the end of the second chapter), something else has happened, and the duo is thrown off the Golden Apple's trail once again. \n"}, {"text": "Who was responsible for abducting the citizens of St. Mystere?", "correct": "Bruno", "options": ["Simon", "Gerard", "Gordon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBruno.\n\n\tBruno, it is determined, is probably one of the only residents of St. Mystere who is not actually a robot.  When Layton and Luke first encounter the character, he is stuffing one of the townspeople into a large sack and carrying them off.  After a chase, they manage to lose Bruno, who later turns up in the basement of the forbidden tower. This solves a few mysteries of the town, namely the abductions and the mystery behind the actual citizens.  It turns out that they were all robots, and Bruno was the one repairing them when they began to wear down.  The rumbling in the tower is also explained.  When Bruno takes one of the citizens in for a tune-up, the machinery in the tower's basement fires up and causes the noise. Having served the late Baron Reinhold for as long as he did, Bruno holds pride in his work- every one of the residents of St. Mystere save the Golden Apple. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Baron Reinhold's daughter?", "correct": "Flora & Flora Reinhold", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlora & Flora Reinhold.\n\n\tFlora, revealed to be the Golden Apple of St. Mystere, is found in a few locations during the game.  Professor Layton and Luke first find her in the northern streets of town after reaching the tower entrance, but before entering the park to the west.  After she flees the scene, they don't see her again until they reach the top of the tower and find her amongst the luxuries of the mysterious cottage. After Don Paolo attacks the tower, Professor Layton has to create a device to get them safely to the ground, and when they land, he discovers how to find the secret treasure of the Golden Apple.  By pressing on a specific piece on Flora's portrait in the entrance of Reinhold Manor, a secret passage opens leading to the Baron's wealth. Flora decides not to take it and leaves St. Mystere with Layton and Luke so as to preserve the town and its people. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the butler of Reinhold Manor?", "correct": "Matthew", "options": ["Sylvain", "William", "Zappone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatthew.\n\n\tMatthew has been the butler of Reinhold Manor since before Flora's birth, and he and Ingrid are seen in pictures with Lady Violet many years before Lady Dahlia was introduced in St. Mystere.  Since the Baron's death, Matthew has been tending to the needs of Lady Dahlia.  During the game, Matthew leads the sleuths to Lady Violet's grave and has them directed through the manor.  Matthew was the first of Bruno's robots to be created.\rWhile Matthew tends to the manor, Sylvain tends to the park and sewers on the other side of town.  Zappone is talked to briefly in the game in order to get a lead on a certain part of the story.  He can be found in the northern part of town while Sylvain is found in both the park and the sewers depending on how far along you are in the game. \n"}, {"text": "Who do Layton and Luke witness being abducted?", "correct": "Ramon", "options": ["Pavel", "Jarvis", "Archibald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRamon.\n\n\tLuke and Layton first speak with Ramon outside Reinhold Manor, and most of his riddles involve riddle crossings (since he allows passage across the river passing in front of the manor itself).  After the initial meeting, Ramon becomes visibly ill, leading to his disappearance.  Layton and Luke find Ramon in the northern portion of town being abducted by Bruno, and are even more mystified when he returns to his job the next day. As it turns out, Ramon was simply in for repairs having been worn down over time.  Bruno had been fixing him.  The abduction leads to the mysteries of the abductions, the tiny cogs (one of which is left behind at Simon's 'death' and the abduction), and the mystery behind Ramon's odd reappearance. All of these are solved when Layton and Luke fall into the basement of the mysterious tower. \n"}, {"text": "Who operates St. Mystere's inn?", "correct": "Beatrice", "options": ["Martha", "Agnes", "Crumm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeatrice.\n\n\tBeatrice is the friendly innkeeper who allows Layton and Luke to stay in her inn for free.  Seeing as the crank for the town's only drawbridge is stolen early on in the visit, Layton and Luke gladly accept her offer.  By completing riddles around town, Layton and Luke can obtain furniture and decorative items with which they can furnish their temporary rooms.  In doing this, Layton will unlock new riddles upon the player's finishing of the game.\rBeatrice also alerts the duo to the fact that a new tenant is added to the building after their arrival,  Unfortunately, by the time they return to the inn, the person is gone.  It isn't until late on in the story that they discover the temporary resident was Don Paolo, also trapped in town due to the incident with the drawbridge crank.  The one responsible for the crank, as it turns out, is Bruno, who kept Layton and Luke in St. Mystere to determine if they're right to be the guardians of the Golden Apple. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Inspector Chelmey's wife?", "correct": "Amelie", "options": ["Amelia", "Amy", "Amber"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmelie.\n\n\tWhen the fake Inspector Chelmey tries to frame Professor Layton and Luke for the murder of Simon, Layton realizes that the fake Chelmey called his wife Amy, whereas his wife's name is really Amelie's.  Layton and Luke discovered this in a newspaper article about Chelmey found in the north end of town (behind the clocktower).  After revealing this, Don Paolo escapes unmasked.\rAas it turns out, Inspector Chelmey has been in London the whole time, and has nothing to do with St. Mystere.  As well, it turns out that Simon was not murdered.  Don Paolo found Simon 'dead' and used it to prevent Layton from searching for the Golden Apple.  It is later revealed that Simon malfunctioned.  After being fixed by Bruno, Simon is fine.  Simon provides another of the mysterious tiny cogs in a separate mystery. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the explorer found in various places around St. Mystere?", "correct": "Pavel", "options": ["Archibald", "Marco", "Rodney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPavel.\n\n\tAlthough Pavel is not one of the citizens of St. Mystere, he is as confusing as the rest of them.  Claiming to have journeyed to St. Mystere in is travels, he is seen in some usual places, not knowing how he got there in the first place.  The first location where he is found is actually within the sewers of St. Mystere, and he tells Layton and Luke where to find Sylvain, the park and sewer operator. After entering the tower in the north end of town, Layton and Luke find Pavel once again.  This is made even more perplexing by the fact that the tower and all ascending floors are blocked by difficult puzzle-related locks. Pavel explains that he found his way to one of the higher floors by wandering through the sewers.  After these two encounters, Layton and Luke don't see Pavel anymore.  It is assumed he escaped the siege on the tower. \n"}]}
