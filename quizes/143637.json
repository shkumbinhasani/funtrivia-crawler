{"id": "143637", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Welcome to Korea' (Part 1) Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "At the very beginning of 'Welcome to Korea' there are featured two quotes.  The second quote, by General Raymond W. Bliss, referring to the Korean War, reads 'A terrible place'.  The first quote reads 'I will go to Korea' and was spoken by which of these individuals?", "correct": "Dwight Eisenhower", "options": ["Harry Truman", "Douglas MacArthur", "Richard Nixon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDwight Eisenhower.\n\n\tIn his 1952 campaign, Eisenhower promised that he would visit Korea, and would look for a possible end to the war.  Raymond W. Bliss served as surgeon general of the Army during the Korean War, and was largely responsible for building the system of hospitals that achieved a high degree of success (the death rate for soldiers was only 2% during the Korean War, as compared with over 4% during WWII). \n"}, {"text": "Since Henry Blake has left the 4077th, Frank Burns has assumed command, and as may be guessed, he is relishing the role.  In the initial scene, Frank enters Radar's office and wakes the young corporal for reveille and morning assembly.  Radar scrambles to assemble his things, including which item that he has stored in his filing cabinet under 'K'?", "correct": "Clipboard", "options": ["Bugle", "Key ring", "Earmuffs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClipboard.\n\n\tAs any long-time fan of 'M*A*S*H' knows, Radar isn't the greatest speller in the world.  He does properly place his bugle under the letter 'B', which I find rather commendable. \n"}, {"text": "Naturally, with the morning assembly comes a confrontation between Frank Burns and Klinger, who happens to be wearing a lovely floral hat.  How does Frank threaten Klinger vis-\u00e0-vis his wearing of improper attire?", "correct": "He threatens to promote Klinger", "options": ["He threatens to tell Klinger's mother that he's a transvestite", "He threatens to personally drive him up the the front", "He threatens to submit commendations on Klinger's superior military acumen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe threatens to promote Klinger.\n\n\tOf course we all know that the worst possible thing that could happen to Klinger would be an extension of his service and/or an addition to his military duties.  Frank mentions only hats and brassieres during his threat.  So far as I understand it, Larry Gelbart and the writers tried to fit in as many 'bra' jokes as possible during the early years. \n"}, {"text": "Attending the assembly are most of the denizens of the 4077th.  Which of the following is/are not in attendance at the beginning of this happy get-together?", "correct": "Hawkeye and Trapper", "options": ["Just Trapper", "Just Hawkeye", "All are in attendance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye and Trapper.\n\n\tHawkeye shows up halfway through the event, arriving in a makeshift rickshaw, but he does not 'attend'.  He makes a mockery of Frank's mock military discipline before heading off to the shower for a soak.  In the shower he discovers via Radar that Trapper has left for the states. \n"}, {"text": "Soon after the assembly, Radar informs Hawkeye that Trapper has received his discharge papers and that he will be heading stateside.  What has Trapper left with Radar to give Hawkeye, as a way of saying goodbye?", "correct": "A kiss", "options": ["A firm handshake", "A recorded message", "A written note"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA kiss.\n\n\tRadar hates the mushy stuff, but plants a generous smooch on Hawkeye's soaked right cheek.  I think the writers decided that the character Trapper would leave abruptly, with virtually no sentiment, very much in the fashion of Wayne Rogers' departure.  How sad... \n"}, {"text": "Off to Frank's office goes Hawkeye, with a request to go off in search of Trapper.  His request is denied, but he leaves anyway with Radar, who is ordered to pick up the new 4077th doctor at which place?", "correct": "Kimpo", "options": ["Ouijongbou", "Pusan", "Inchon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKimpo.\n\n\tKimpo was a U.S. Air Force base during the Korean War.  Kimpo is now the international airport for the South Korean capital Seoul.  By the time Hawkeye and Radar reach Kimpo, Trapper has left...and B. J. has arrived. \n"}, {"text": "On the way to the airbase, Hawkeye and Radar are pulled over by military police at a checkpoint along the road.  With Radar playing sick, Hawkeye announces to the M.P. that Radar is suffering terribly from which ailment?", "correct": "Neurapraxia", "options": ["Goiter", "Cephalgia", "Hyperhydrosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeurapraxia.\n\n\tAccording to Hawkeye, neurapraxia is a 'temporary loss of nerve function' that causes the victim to 'foam at the mouth' and 'crawl on the ground, try(ing) to bite his nose'.  And naturally, it's very contagious.  Naturally, only the first part of his description is true, but the M.P. doesn't want to take any chances.  Off to Kimpo! \n"}, {"text": "Unfortunately, Trapper is already on his way home by the time Hawkeye and Radar reach the airbase.  By how many minutes did they miss Trapper, according to Hawkeye?", "correct": "10 minutes", "options": ["1 day", "1 hour", "5 hours"], "explanation": "\n\n\n10 minutes.\n\n\tWhile Radar goes to locate B. J., Hawkeye goes to check out the records of departures at the airbase.  He discovers that Trapper has left just 10 minutes prior to their arrival at Kimpo. \n"}, {"text": "In order to introduce B.J. to Korea, Hawkeye insists that a drink is necessary.  The two doctors are accompanied into an officer's club with Radar.  What temporary new military rank does Hawkeye assign Radar? ", "correct": "Corporal captain", "options": ["Sergeant general", "Private colonel", "Major lieutenant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorporal captain.\n\n\tHawkeye gives Radar a 'field promotion' for 'being brave and near-sighted above and beyond the call (of duty)'.  One colonel in the officer's club doesn't like the newfangled idea of this 'corporal-captain' rank...no sir, he doesn't like it at all! \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and B.J. order bourbons and water in the officer's club, while Radar orders the 'usual' Grape Nehi.  How does Radar respond when the bartender asks, 'Does the, uh, captain want a straw'?", "correct": "We don't use straws in combat, fella.", "options": ["I drink my Grape Nehi straight up, fella.", "I never allow my men to use straws, fella.", "A straw never saved a man's life on the front line, fella."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe don't use straws in combat, fella.\n\n\tThis is one of my very favorite Radar lines.  His delivery here is very John Waynesque, I must say.  After receiving their drinks, they give B.J. a 'welcome to Korea' toast, and a new 'M*A*S*H' era is officially born.  Thanks for trying this quiz, I invite you to try part II (and to try some of my other 'M*A*S*H' episode quizzes as well.) \n"}]}
