{"id": "405922", "name": "\"RuPaul's Drag Race\" - All Stars 6 Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "RuPaul's Drag Race"], "questions": [{"text": "How many queens competed in this season of the show?", "correct": "Thirteen & 13", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThirteen & 13.\n\n\tThough the last several \"All Stars\" seasons of the show featured a total of ten returning queens, this sixth season featured the largest competing cast of the bunch with thirteen queens spanning seasons dating all the way back to season 2.  Three of the queens also appeared on earlier \"All Stars\" seasons, making a redemption run for the crown.  Notably, this season of the show was filmed during the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps accounting for the longer run of episodes and more significant size of cast. \n"}, {"text": "This season saw the return of which lip sync format/mechanic?", "correct": "Lip Sync Assassins", "options": ["Lip Sync For Your Life", "Lip Sync Roulette", "Pairs Lip Syncs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLip Sync Assassins.\n\n\tIntroduced in \"All Stars 5\", the Lip Sync Assassin mechanic was introduced to replace the Lip Sync For Your Legacy, wherein the top two queens each week faced off for the chance to eliminated one of their fellow queens.  Instead, the single top queen would be brought to the main stage to face off against a past contestant famous for strong lip syncs. If the competing queen won, they'd eliminate one of the bottom queens; if the Lip Sync Assassin won, then the group's vote would decide who was eliminated.  This season saw ten such assassins appear on the main stage, some of whom hadn't performed a lip sync on the show since season 2. \n"}, {"text": "The season's first episode saw the return of the typical All Star Variety Extravaganza.  Which of these queens did not perform a song for their talent?", "correct": "Scarlet Envy", "options": ["Ginger Minj", "Jan", "Silky Nutmeg Ganache"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScarlet Envy.\n\n\tThe queens were brought into the workroom on day one and expected to bring forth their best talent to kick off their run through the competition (as is customary for an \"All Stars\" season).  As with most years, the show featured a number of queens using the main stage as a platform to showcase their singing or lip syncing, often for new singles. A small handful, however, showcased unique talents-- Scarlet Envy performed a burlesque bubble act; Ra'Jah O'Hara sewed a dress onstage; Trinity K. Bonet performed comedy.  Yara Sofia won the episode with her comedic song and dance and faced off against Coco Montrese for the final lip sync. The group voted to send Serena ChaCha packing. \n"}, {"text": "What theme was used for this season's fashion ball?", "correct": "The colour blue", "options": ["Candy", "Sports", "Money"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe colour blue.\n\n\tThis season's fashion ball episode came early as twelve queens walked the runway in the second episode, each presenting three separate looks on the main stage.  The Blue Ball saw three distinct looks.  The first of these, Blue Betta Work, had the queens bring their own garments to represent blue collar workers. The second, Blue Jean Baby, was denim-only, once again having queens don the tough material.  The final, which queens had to make in the workroom with assorted blue items, was Blue Ball Bonanza.  Ra'Jah O'Hara won this challenge and faced off against Lip Sync Assassin and Season 11 sister Brooke Lynn Hytes to Janet Jackson's \"Miss You Much\".  Both queens won the lip sync but both had the same lipstick, so Jiggly Caliente was sent packing. \n"}, {"text": "This season's Rusical was themed around which of these entertaining events?", "correct": "Superbowl Half-Time", "options": ["The Olympics", "The MET Gala", "The Academy Awards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuperbowl Half-Time.\n\n\tFollowing the third episode acting challenge, the top ten queens were tasked with mimicking famous Superbowl halftime performers in the 'All Stars 6 Hall of Fame Half-Time Show' for which they had to lip sync to classic RuPaul songs remade in the styles of their particular artists.  This episode was won by Jan who, playing Lady Gaga, beat out Trinity K. Bonet's Beyonce. The win allowed her to go head-to-head against Jessica Wild in the Lip Sync For Your Legacy (to Britney Spears' \"Womanizer\").  She lost, which meant Yara Sofia was sent home.  Had she won, her sole vote for A'keria C. Davenport would have sent her home instead. \n"}, {"text": "This season featured an acting challenge in which the queens acted as characters based on those featured in which TV series?", "correct": "American Horror Story", "options": ["Sex and the City", "The Golden Girls", "Grey's Anatomy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican Horror Story.\n\n\tMost seasons of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" feature a dedicated acting challenge, and while the script might not always be to-notch, the queens have to work with what they're given to camp up a comedic take on an existing TV show property.  This season's acting challenge focused on \"American Horror Story\", taking characters from the earlier seasons and replicating them (to an extent) with the queens' personal twists.  Kylie Sonique Love's version of Fiona Goode won her the challenge and she performed Christina Aguilera's \"Dirrty\" against Manila Luzon, winning and sending A'Keria C. Davenport home. \n"}, {"text": "This season's Snatch Game of Love featured how many competing queens?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Eight", "Ten", "Twelve"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tWhile the normal season Snatch Game can feature any number of queens, the \"All Stars\" Snatch Game of Love generally only has six queens in two sets of three, forcing them to engage with a small number of competitors in improvised segments all while impersonating a celebrity of their choosing.  Ginger Minj's Phyllis Diller won out over the others (including Kylie's Dolly Parton), giving Ginger a second win for the season. She took home a $30,000 prize for besting Heidi N. Closet in the lip sync (to Sheena Easton's \"Sugar Walls\") and subsequently sent Pandora Boxx out of the competition over Trinity K. Bonet. \n"}, {"text": "This season featured a 'game within a game'-- the Rudemption Lip Sync Smackdown.  Which queen competed in seven back-to-back lip syncs?", "correct": "Silky Nutmeg Ganache", "options": ["Scarlet Envy", "Yara Sofia", "Jiggly Caliente"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilky Nutmeg Ganache.\n\n\tAs each queen was eliminated from the show, they were surprised by RuPaul upon leaving the workroom.  Instead of going straight home, they were given one more chance to prove themselves in a lip sync battle against the following week's eliminated queen with the final queen standing being able to return to the competition.  With this, Silky Nutmeg Ganache, the third queen eliminated, steamrolled over seven consecutive performances before losing to the final queen, Eureka O'Hara, who was allowed to rejoin the final five in the penultimate challenge. \n"}, {"text": "The final episode saw the final four queens create lyrics to \"This Is Our Country\", a song by RuPaul and what country singer?", "correct": "Tanya Tucker", "options": ["Taylor Swift", "Dolly Parton", "Kacey Musgraves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTanya Tucker.\n\n\tAs the field of thirteen queens winnowed down to the final four, Ru asked them to do the typical finale challenge of featuring on the podcast \"What's the Tee?\", creating original lyrics to one of her songs, and performing in a music video.  This season's offering was \"This Is Our Country\", a new RuPaul country song featuring music legend Tanya Tucker.  Following this, the queens headed to the main stage to walk the runway in their All Star Hall of Fame Eleganza Extravaganza before the final critiques. \n"}, {"text": "Which queen was crowned the winner of \"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars\" season 6?", "correct": "Kylie Sonique Love", "options": ["Eureka!", "Ra'Jah O'Hara", "Ginger Minj"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKylie Sonique Love.\n\n\tAll four finalists performed on the main stage after their final critiques after changing into one last look.  To end of the season, each queen performed individually, lip syncing to Lady Gaga's \"Stupid Love\" for the judges.  Although Kylie Sonique Love slipped on her discarded outfit during the performance, it may have been her immediate, reflexive recovery that helped her secure the win as she was crowned the winner of \"All Stars 6\" and the new entrant into the Drag Race Hall of Fame. Kylie became the first U.S. transgender winner of the show, taking with her the $100,000 cash prize, the crown, the scepter, and a one year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics. Ra'Jah O'Hara, Eureka!, and Ginger Minj were all co-runners-up. \n"}]}
