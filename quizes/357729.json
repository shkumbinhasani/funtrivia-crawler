{"id": "357729", "name": "Words Without Words [2] Quiz | Brain Teasers | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", " Word Play"], "questions": [{"text": "Without using the letters in the word SIN, what is one of the Seven Deadly Sins?", "correct": "Wrath", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWrath.\n\n\tThe Seven Deadly Sins, as noted by the Bible, are Gluttony, Sloth, Envy, Greed (or Avarice), Lust, Pride, and Wrath.  All of them reflect different moral and ethical vices considered questionable in Christian life though it's safe to say that regardless of faith or beliefs, it's best to stray away from them.  Because 'Greed' is also known by the name 'Avarice', the only possibility would be 'Wrath' since all of the other sins contain one of the three letters banned from the question. \n"}, {"text": "Without using the letters in the word STATES, what is one of the fifty American States?", "correct": "Ohio & Wyoming", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOhio & Wyoming.\n\n\tOf the fifty American States, only two do not contain any of the four banned letters-- A, E, S, and T.  Ohio, found near the southern tip of Ontario, Canada, does not share any land borders with the northern country but does rest on Lake Erie, one of the five Great Lakes.  Containing Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland, it's a major state population-wise.  Wyoming, meanwhile, is out to the west; it's the least-populated State and it borders the Rocky Mountains.  Most of the state is ranch land, National Parks, and foothills. \n"}, {"text": "Without using the letters in the word GASES, what is one of the Noble Gases on the Periodic Table?", "correct": "Krypton", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKrypton.\n\n\tThe Periodic Table keeps all of its Noble Gases on the right-hand side.  With their electron shells filled, the Noble Gases have low reactivity simply because they have no need to be.  There are only six: Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon, and the only one not to contain A, E, G, or S is Krypton, element number thirty-six.  Krypton, like Neon, is used in the creation of fluorescent light.  It is fairly impractical, however; you're more likely to find and use Neon.  Krypton is radioactive. \n"}, {"text": "Without using the letters in the word NUMBER, what is the first multiple of ten that can be counted to?", "correct": "Fifty & 50", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFifty & 50.\n\n\tA multiple of ten is created when you multiply any number by ten.  It's fairly easy to catch this one-- any multiple of ten will end with a zero.\rThis one is as easy as counting up.  Since ten, twenty, thirty, and forty all contain an N, R, or E, fifty marks the first multiple to beat the rule.  In Roman numerals, the number fifty is represented by L. \n"}, {"text": "Without using the letters in the word HITCHCOCK, what is a post-WWII film made by the famous director Alfred Hitchcock?", "correct": "Frenzy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrenzy.\n\n\t\"Frenzy\" was Hitchcock's penultimate feature film.  Released in 1972, the movie was the typical fare for the master of suspense.  Set in London, it involved a serial killer whose identity was actually revealed towards the start of the film.  As the movie progressed, the viewer would follow along with the killer as he attempted to cover his tracks.  It was one of Hitchcock's two films released in the 1970s before his death in 1980.\r If you were to count pre-war films in the mix, you'd only add a couple more to the list: \"Murder!\" (1930) and \"Mary\" (1931). \n"}, {"text": "Without using the letters in the name BONO, what is a studio album by Irish rock group U2?", "correct": "War", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWar.\n\n\t\"War\" was the third album release by U2 following their successful early hits on \"Boy\" and 'October\" in 1980 and 1981 respectively.  Featuring the songs \"New Year's Day\" and \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", \"War\" ended up making U2 a prominent group in the 1980s.  It went quadruple platinum in the United States alone and created staples in the band's popular live line-ups. It reached number one in the UK and became the album that knocked \"Thriller\" off the top of the Albums Chart.  It would be their most successful album until \"The Joshua Tree\", at which point it seems they hit their stride with a consistent string of universally-acclaimed album releases (\"Rattle and Hum\", \"Pop\", \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\", \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\", \"No Line on the Horizon\", etc.). \n"}, {"text": "Without using the letters in the word BARD, what is a famous tragedy by William Shakespeare?", "correct": "Othello", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOthello.\n\n\tShakespeare wrote over a dozen tragedies in the English Renaissance and his name will forever be remembered in the field of literary and stage history for the contributions he made.  Amongst his famous tragedies, stories featuring death and sympathetic characters, are \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"MacBeth\", \"Julius Caesar\", \"Hamlet\", and \"King Lear\".  \"Othello\" is the only one without the four letters of B-A-R-D in the name; all of the others have the letter A (except \"Cymbeline\").  Shakespeare also wrote sonnets, comedies, and histories. \n"}, {"text": "Without using the letters in the word CANADA, what is the only provincial/territorial capital city that can be written?", "correct": "Whitehorse", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhitehorse.\n\n\tThe other capital cities in Canada (east to west, then northbound) include St. John's, Charlottetown, Halifax, Fredericton, Quebec City, Toronto, Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Victoria, Whitehorse, Yellowknife, and Iqaluit.  Whitehorse, the capital of the Yukon Territory, is the only one to match the requirement. The largest city of all the territories, it's still quite small but is notable for its history in mining.  Due to its relative isolation, it's quicker to travel to either Juneau or Anchorage (in Alaska) than it is to go to any other capital in Canada.  The closest, Yellowknife, is at least a day and a half away under the best conditions and you have to go south through two provinces to get there. \n"}, {"text": "Without using the letters in the word DUNGEON, what is one of the six ability scores your character can have in the \"Dungeons and Dragons\" role-playing game?", "correct": "Charisma", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharisma.\n\n\tThe six ability scores found in the game are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  While the first three directly affect your power, defensive game, and vitality in the game, the latter three are much more important for non-melee classes.  An intelligent character, for an example, will have more knowledge and language proficiency; a wise character will be more perceptive; a charismatic character will be able to speak with people better, whether for good or evil. If your character casts magic spells, one of these ability scores is a must; it just depends on the class you play. Those with high Charisma scores are considered better-looking, more charming, and better adept at handling non-battle situations with other people simply with their manner and speech. \n"}, {"text": "Without using the letters in the word ASIA, what is a country situated entirely within the Asian continent?", "correct": "Yemen", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nYemen.\n\n\tFunnily enough, the only correct answer is the Middle Eastern nation of Yemen; all other Asian nations contain either the vowel A or I.  Had the question asked for *any* Asian nation (including ones not completely occupied by Asia), Turkey would have been another option.  Fortunately, however, part of that country is occupied by Europe.  It is situated on the border of two continents (in the city of Istanbul).\rYemen is at the southern tip of the Middle East on the coast of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.  It's considered one of the oldest inhabited regions on the planet. \n"}]}
