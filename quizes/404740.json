It's August 23rd, a special day, but neither of them can figure out why.  As Vision heads to work, Wanda is welcomed to Westview by their neighbour, Agnes.  Wanda deduces that they must be celebrating their anniversary.\r Vision, working at a computational services company, can't seem to figure out what it really is they do there...but he appears to be really productive at it.  His boss, Mr. Hart, reminds him of the dinner they planned to have that evening and it becomes apparent that it's the event he and Wanda forgot.\r The evening goes along with as many hi-jinx as would be expected.  With magic and some clever covering up of their missteps (and some help from Agnes), Wanda and Vision manage to have a successful dinner...even if Mr. Hart chokes on it for a moment.  Vision has to use his powers to clear the blockage, and even then the Harts aren't the wiser.\r Throughout the dinner though, something is concerning.  Neither Wanda nor Vision can remember where they came from...or how they met...or why they don't have children.  As the Harts depart for the night, they ponder how odd a couple they really are.\r ...while someone watches them from their television set. \n"}, {"text": "\"Don't Touch That Dial\"\n\nWhich of these causes Vision to malfunction during the Talent Show for the Children?", "correct": "A stick of gum", "options": ["Wine", "A solar flare", "A beesting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA stick of gum.\n\n\tWanda and Vision are awakened in the middle of the night when Wanda hears a noise outside.  It's the 1960s, and Vision has been hearing news about some bad eggs in town.  No matter.  When they find out it's just the sound of a tree branch on their window (using magic!) there's not much to think about.\r There's plenty else to worry about.  Vision and Wanda have been planning an act for the Westview Talent Show (for the Children), and they need to appear as normal as possible out in public.  The town doesn't seem to notice anything amiss, but Wanda and Vision notice plenty out of order.  Wanda attends local committee meetings alongside Agnes and another neighbour, Geraldine, but periodically continues to notice splashes of colour in the otherwise black-and-white, 1960s town of Westview.  The banging noise doesn't stop either.  It doesn't appear to be coming from the trees.\r The magic show goes well, but only when Wanda uses her magic to stop Vision from outright revealing his powers a handful of times.  When the duo returns home having won the accolades of the townspeople, they walk in the front door and Wanda finds herself quite pregnant.  As the noises sound outside again, they head to the street to investigate and find a man, clad in a beekeeper's outfit, emerging from the manhole in the street.  Wanda, saying no to this, rewinds to the moment they discovered the pregnancy.\r ...and that's when their world floods with colour before their very eyes. \n"}, {"text": "\"Now in Color\"\n\nWanda finds herself rapidly advancing through stages of pregnancy, and it's discovered that she's giving birth to which of these?", "correct": "Twin boys", "options": ["A girl", "Twin girls", "A boy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwin boys.\n\n\tIn their colourful 1970s home, Wanda and Vision prepare for the new addition to their family.  After a house-call with a Bermuda-bound doctor (verifying that she is in fact four-month pregnant), Vision notices the neighbours acting just a bit too weird.  He returns to the house to find Wanda more pregnant than before.  They move on to decorating the nursery, but the baby starts kicking.  It all goes so fast.  Soon, they're arguing about the child's name-- maybe Tommy, maybe Billy.\r Wanda has contractions within the same day and the event causes Wanda's powers to overcharge the power grid; their whole block goes dark.  Wanda wonders if the recent events have led their neighbours to suspect them of something wrong.  Vision worries that it goes as far back as dinner with the Harts, but the thought seems to be stopped and rewinded just in time to lead into Wanda's labour.  Vision rushes out to get the doctor before he leaves town.\r Geraldine shows up at the house and lets herself in looking for a bucket-- all of her pipes burst-- and it puts her into the right place at the right time to help deliver not one, but two children.  One they name Tommy, the other they name Billy.\r As Vision brings the doctor back home, he comments that he hopes the doctor will still take his vacation.  Unfortunately, it's looking unlikely.  \"Small towns,\" the doctor says, \"are so hard to escape.\"  Vision hears the idle gossip from the people of the neighbourhood; they're talking about Geraldine.  Everyone is a bit confused.  After all, she's new in town and no one quite knows what she does or what she's doing there.  She doesn't seem to have a home in Westview.\r Inside the house, Wanda tells Geraldine that she was a twin as well.  She had a brother named Pietro.  Geraldine knows though; he was killed by Ultron, she remembers.  Wanda spies a necklace around Geraldine's neck depicting a sword and demands she tell her who she really is.  She's gone by the time Vision heads back into the house.\r Wanda doesn't note where Geraldine has gone when Vision reenters, but she's been cast out of Westview altogether.  She emerges from a wall of static and is picked up by special forces. \n"}, {"text": "\"We Interrupt This Program\"\n\nDr. Darcy Lewis is brought into the Westview investigation due to her expertise in which of these fields?", "correct": "Astrophysics", "options": ["Hostage negotiation", "Space travel", "Television repair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAstrophysics.\n\n\tWhen Monica Rambeau rematerialized after the events of the Blip, she awakened in a hospital to find that she had been gone for five years and things had clearly changed.  Working for S.W.O.R.D. (the Sentient Weapon Observation Response Division), she picked the pieces of her life back up and resumed her duties despite the circumstances.  Her mother, Maria Rambeau, who was known for her work with Captain Marvel, passed away during the five year period and it was on her request that Monica remain on missions firmly planted on Earth.  As such, Maria was assigned to join the FBI in Eastview, New Jersey for an investigation.\r When Monica arrived and joined Jimmy Woo on the scene, she determined that there was a missing persons report for someone in Witness Protection.  Local law enforcement, despite standing in front of a sign for Westview, insisted that Westview didn't exist.  No one inside could be contacted; no one believed it was there.  And no one can seem to get inside; the town won't let them in.\r Maria, grabbing a helicopter drone from the back of her vehicle, flew it into the town only to see it disappear.  When she moved towards it to investigate, she found the barrier, an energy field, and was pulled inside.  This, of course, led to a larger investigation; within a day, the town was surrounded by special forces.\r Among the forces sent to examine Westview was none other than Darcy Lewis, who was brought in as a leading astrophysicist.  As S.W.O.R.D. sent agents in through the sewers, Darcy determined that it was possible to get a glimpse into Westview via an old television set through which she could watch a television show called 'WandaVision' starring none other than Wanda Maximoff and Vision, who died five years earlier in the fight against Thanos.\r The investigation deepened as Jimmy and Darcy deduced that the people in Westview were none other than actual residents in the town that Westview was.  Amongst them was Monica, playing a woman named Geraldine, blending into the environment.  Jimmy and Darcy attempted to communicate with Wanda during one moment in the second episode (through a radio), and though they didn't know whether or not they got through, it was apparent something happened.\r When Geraldine helped deliver Wanda's twins, the situation changed.  While, in Westview, Wanda sent Monica out of Westview for mentioning Ultron, viewers immediately saw a cut to credits, missing what actually occurred in the town.  Monica was expelled, but not before Wanda used her powers to send her away.  In the moment, Wanda had a brief glimpse at reality, seeing Vision as he was when the Mind Stone was pulled from him.\r Monica's return, of course, reaffirms that Westview is under Wanda's complete control. \n"}, {"text": "\"On a Very Special Episode...\"\n\nWanda and Vision become the owners of a dog that they let the boys keep.  What is its name?", "correct": "Sparky", "options": ["Spot", "Rover", "Biscuits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSparky.\n\n\t'WandaVision' moves into the 1980s and Tommy and Billy, aging rapidly, are taken care of by their doting parents and the help of Agnes, the ever-present neighbour.  One of the scenes, Agnes' entry, somewhat derails and Agnes, confused, asks if Wanda wants her to take the scene from the top.  They all ignore the screw-up...especially when the boys age several years a few minutes later.\r Monica, back on the outside of Westview, is tested after her return.  All she remembers is the immense grief she felt when Wanda cast her away.  During a mission briefing, it becomes apparent that Wanda is not completely trusted by S.W.O.R.D.  In fact, Director Hayward cites her to be a terrorist, much to Monica's chagrin.  Nine days ago, Wanda stormed the S.W.O.R.D. labs, took Vision's body, and as it would seem, she resurrected him against his wishes.  Monica, realizing the situation is getting out of hand, considers reentering the field of Wanda's influence (which Darcy has taken to calling 'the hex' due to its hexagonal shape), and something Darcy says causes her to want to investigate the clothes she came back in.  As it turns out, Wanda is able to reshape reality; all of her '70s-inspired wardrobe choices are made of the kevlar vest she went into Westview wearing.\r The situation progresses quickly in Westview; the boys age up to ten years old.  While Agnes shows up with a doghouse for an unexpected dog (they name Sparky), Wanda starts to slip in hiding her powers.  At the computational services building, Vision hooks up his computer and opens an email sent from S.W.O.R.D. that has managed to get through.  Vision uses his powers to snap his coworker, Norm, back into reality and for a brief moment, he conveys that Wanda is taking over his thoughts and won't let him go free.\r Director Hayward sends a drone into Westview in an attempt to bring down Wanda from the inside but Wanda, conscious of this attempt to break in, finally breaks through the wall to communicate to S.W.O.R.D. in person (while she puts 'WandaVision' on standby).  When she emerges from the hex, she keeps her message simple: they only get one warning to stay out of her home.\r In Westview, Sparky goes missing.  Wanda and the boys find him at Agnes' place, but he died eating her azalea bushes.  Wanda stops them from aging to deal with their grief, insisting that the urge to run from their feelings might be powerful, but they need to deal.  The boys argue that she fixed Vision, but she says there are rules in life.  No one can reverse death.\r At home Vision asks Wanda the important questions about their life in Westview and he notes that he knows what Wanda was doing with Norm's mind.  He asks that she not just change everything again and shift into a new, distracting era.  She can, though, and she intends to.  He tries to talk over her end credits and their argument breaks through the television trope.  Vision can't figure out who he is or who he was before Westview and Wanda continues to talk him off the ledge, but there are severe problems-- Billy and Tommy are the only kids in town, for instance.  She doesn't know how Westview started, and Vision tells her it's all wrong.\r ...and that's when the doorbell rings.  Wanda didn't make it ring.  Neither of them knows who it is.  But when Wanda answers the door it's her brother, Pietro Maximoff...but not as he or anyone else remembers him.  Darcy, watching from her television, realizes she's recast him. \n"}, {"text": "\"All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\"\n\nWhen Westview expands, it catches who of the following in its borders?", "correct": "Darcy", "options": ["Hayward", "Monica", "Jimmy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarcy.\n\n\t'WandaVision' pushes into the late 1990s.  Tommy and Billy plan for Halloween but both of them are a bit leery of their uncle's appearance in their lives partly because he's a bit of a man-child and partly because Wanda seems to be acting weird towards him.  The expectations of the show are starting to slip; Wanda can't seem to control her expectations of Vision either, since he's off joining the efforts of the neighbourhood watch instead of trick-or-treating with the family.  Pietro takes it upon himself to look after the boys, at least for the night.\r Outside the hex, Director Hayward lays into Monica and the others for their attempts to avoid the inevitable-- that Wanda must be stopped.  He forces Monica, Darcy, and Jimmy out, but the trio are able to break free of their captors, disguise themselves, and go rogue.\r Wanda and Pietro get some time to chat with one another and she asks the burning question of why he looks different from the Pietro she knows.  He asks her the same, claiming that if he found Shangri-La, he wouldn't want to be reminded of the past either.  When he heads off with the boys to pull pranks and steal candy, Wanda discovers that Vision wasn't on-duty for the neighbourhood watch.  She doesn't know where he is.  The truth is that he's wandering Westview alone, finding the cracks in in the facade of 'WandaVision'.  In his absence, Wanda continues to determine more about why Pietro is there, and it likely has something to do with her grief.  He, at the very least, understands his role in Westview.\r Digging through the S.W.O.R.D. base's secure network, Darcy discovers that Director Hayward has been tracking Vision specifically.  They know how many people are in Hayward and that they're barely moving.  It's because, as Vision discovers inside, they appear to be low on Wanda's scope of priorities.  He wanders the streets near the edge of town to find entire cul-de-sacs of frozen locals.  He finds a car, frozen at an intersection near the edge of town and in it he locates Agnes, dressed as a witch and beset with a bout of amnesia.  He snaps her out of her trance and she recognizes him as Vision, begging for help.  He can't remember being a part of the Avengers, despite her urging, and she comes to conclude that she, like the others (and Vision), must be dead.  Wanda won't even let them think about leaving.\r While Darcy investigates Monica's personnel file, she discovers that the bloodwork has come back...concerning.  Though Monica wants to reenter the hex, her passing through the barrier twice has rewritten her cells on a molecular level.  It's changing her.\r As Vision heads to the edge of the hex, he reaches through the barrier and pushes through to the other side as S.W.O.R.D. agents await him.  The problem is that as Vision steps through, he begins to disintegrate.  Billy, able to sense his father's pain (while Tommy exhibits super speed), alerts Wanda of the events and she expands the hex to save him...and she catches Darcy in its perimeter.  Monica and Jimmy drive off, avoiding getting caught inside, while Hayward runs away.      \r And Westview gets just a bit bigger. \n"}, {"text": "\"Breaking the Fourth Wall\"\n\nMonica gains powers of her own when she passes through the hex barrier which time?", "correct": "The third", "options": ["The fourth", "The first", "The second"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe third.\n\n\t'WandaVision' moves into a late-2000s single-camera comedy setting after the events of the Halloween spooktacular, and with that Wanda insists on a stay-at-home single-day quarantine to prevent herself from getting involved in further hi-jinx.  This being said, there are glitches which occur throughout the day as Wanda and others notice items transforming into different things before their very eyes.  To have the day to herself, Wanda lets Agnes look after the boys.\r S.W.O.R.D., meanwhile, sets up a new base the next day, situating itself eight miles away from Westview in light of the hex's expansion.  Inside that expansion, Vision awakens to find himself outside the circus tent that was, formerly, S.W.O.R.D. headquarters.  Darcy appears to be amongst the performers and he choses to team up with her, deciding to snap her out of Wanda's control and abscond with a funnel cake truck to drive through town.  Their trip is cut short, however, when it appears Wanda doesn't want Vision to make it home.\r Monica and Jimmy link up with other uncompromised S.W.O.R.D. members, en route discovering that Hayward sought to bring Vision back online.  Knowing that they need to tell Wanda, they load into a specialized space rover vehicle believed to be capable of surviving entry into the hex.  She suits up and drives into the barrier, but it proves unable to maintain its form, so Monica walks through on foot, emerging into Westview...changed.  The third crossing transforms her on a cellular level.  She can see Westview for what it really is.\r Monica arrives at Wanda's house and it leads to a quick confrontation.  Wanda forces Monica out of the house with her powers, but Monica, now empowered by the crossings, is able to fight back with powers of her own.  Agnes, watching from the window next door, stops the fight by inviting Wanda in for a chat.\r The chat is a quick one.  Wanda remembers that Agnes took the twins for the day but they're nowhere to be found.  When she asks, Agnes suggests that they're probably in the basement, but when she checks, they're not there.  Instead, Wanda finds what appears to be an ancient chamber containing runic symbols, odd curios, and a single radiant tome.  Agnes reveals her true nature once Wanda is sealed away-- her real name is Agatha Harkness and it's been her running 'WandaVision' behind the scenes all along.\r Monica, not taking Agnes' suggestion to leave, decides to investigate the house on her own.  When she peers into the basement she finds the same passage that Wanda located, but she's caught by Pietro. \n"}, {"text": "\"Previously On\"\n\nWhich of these did Vision leave for Wanda before he died?", "correct": "The deed to a house", "options": ["Boxes of old TV shows on DVD", "A wedding ring", "His body"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe deed to a house.\n\n\tIn the year 1693 in Salem, Massachusetts, Agatha Harkness was brought into the woods, tied to the stake, and forced to admit to being a witch.  Unable to control the powers, she begged for mercy from her coven before they blasted her with energy.  To their surprise, she reversed their attempts, aging them in their place.  She was the last witch standing on that night.\r In the basement of Agatha's Westview house, Wanda finds herself trapped by runes as Agatha grills her for her true identity and power.  She tried to bring Fake Pietro in to help her understand the truth, but she only got so far.  It was magic on autopilot, far beyond even her own capabilities.  Agatha, trying to get to the bottom of this, decides to force Wanda to relive some past experiences...using the children as motivation.\r Their trip commences with a visit to Wanda's childhood-- TV night with her family as they prepare to watch a classic show on DVD.  But at the same time, war wages on outside.  The Maximoffs start an episode of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" moments before a bomb destroys their apartment.  Pietro and Wanda survived, even managing to discover their powers in the nick of time to prevent another Stark Industries missile from exploding in front of them.\r The next memory is Wanda's time in incarceration for joining an anti-freedom terrorist organization.  Wanda, as a volunteer, encountered the power of Loki's staff first-hand.  She was the only one to survive the Infinity Stone's power though she saw something in its light and it amplified her abilities.\r Wanda is next sent to the Avengers' compound, the first home she and Vision shared.  It was there that she and Vision, watching a classic episode of \"Malcolm in the Middle\" together, mused on the notion of love and grief.  With her family dead and Vision killed not once but twice, it appeared that Wanda, wanting Vision back, acted out of love.\r In another memory, Wanda appears to enter S.W.O.R.D.'s labs hunting for Vision.  She encounters Director Hayward for the first time on this visit and he insists on showing her the work they've been doing.  He admits the truth as she watches; they're dismantling the most sophisticated sentient weapon ever made.  It's their legal and ethical obligation, not to mention that she has the power to bring him back to life.  This was the moment when Wanda broke through the windows and reached out for her soulmate only to find that she could not feel him any longer.  She departed without him.\r Returning to her vehicle, Wanda found a letter waiting for her on the passenger seat of her car.  She drove directly to the small town of Westview, pulling up at the house she would reside in when it was built.  The letter contained the property deed, purchased by Vision, for their dream home.  In her grief, she constructed the hex in a burst of energy, building their home but bringing Westview with her.  It was with this power that she recreated Vision, falling immediately into the 1950s fantasy she adored, carelessly ignoring the artifice of the television production before her.\r Agatha congratulates Wanda on recognizing the truth before vanishing out to the street and parading the children before her.  The children, Vision, the whole life she made, was created out of nothing.  And that makes her the Scarlet Witch.\r In the S.W.O.R.D. remote lab, Director Hayward prepares for launch as his scientists use Wanda's energy, stored in their attack drone, to bring Vision back online. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Series Finale\"\n\nThe Scarlet Witch is known to derive her magic from which of these?", "correct": "Chaos", "options": ["Love", "Space and time", "Fire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChaos.\n\n\tIn an attempt to protect her boys, Wanda fires a blast of magic at Agatha, knocking her to the ground, but Agatha is counting on that sort of thing; she takes powers from people she claims are undeserving.  While the twins run away, it gives the two women a chance to battle.  Agatha manages to escape at a critical moment, but Wanda is met at that moment by a copy of Vision, appearing to her in all white, poised to put an end to her.  She's only saved by this new foe when her version of Vision returns.\r And so they set off to protect their home.  While Vision takes to the sky to fight his manufactured doppelg\u00e4nger, Wanda pursues Agatha.  Inside Agatha's house, Monica is held captive by Agatha's fake Pietro.  Outside the hex, Jimmy Woo is captured by Hayward.  He manages to escape in due time and call his back-up in Quantico.\r Agatha, battling Wanda through Westview, tells Wanda of her truth as written in the Book of the Damned, the Dark Hold.  The Scarlet Witch is not born; she is forged.  She has no coven nor need for incantation.  Her power exceeds that of the Sorcerer Supreme.  It's her destiny to destroy the world.  It's then that Agatha releases the citizens of Westview from Wanda's hold, forcing her to come to terms with the consequences.\r In Pietro's man-cave, Monica finds a bill marked for Ralph Bohner, the actual owner of Agatha's house, and she determines that he's been an actor controlled by her (via a magical necklace) the whole time.  She gets the upper hand in a quick fight and breaks the spell.\r From their home, the twins realize that they need to help Wanda and they rush to the Westview town square.  They don't make it in time as Wanda, informed that her grief is poisoning the residents of the hex, struggles to avoid harming the people she's trapped.  In her eagerness to let them go, she breaks down the walls of the hex and yells at them to run.  Unfortunately, it gives Hayward and his forces the chance to get in and it has a harsh effect on Vision who, still fighting, feels his powers waning. He crashes to the ground and dissolves before Wanda's eyes as the boys arrive, falling to pieces.\r In grief, she closes the hex once again, only moments before Woo's men arrive from Quantico.  It gives Agatha the perfect opportunity to drain more of Wanda's powers, white vision the chance to float back to the battleground, and S.W.O.R.D. to get into position in the town square.  And the battle continues. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Series Finale\"\n\nWhich of these is Agatha's fate?", "correct": "She's trapped in Westview", "options": ["She's sent to prison", "She is killed", "She succeeds in stealing Wanda's powers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe's trapped in Westview.\n\n\tWanda and Vision resume their fights while the boys are left to face off against S.W.O.R.D.  They manage to stop the agents int heir tracks, but they forget about Hayward, who emerges from his vehicle and opens fire on them.  Monica, having escaped Agatha's house, makes it just in time to stand in the way and use her powers to block the bullets.  Hayward tries to escape in his truck, but he's T-boned by Darcy, still driving the funnel cake truck stolen from the carnival.\r Both Visions, fighting their way into a library, engage in a debate about the Ship of Theseus which leads both to contemplate who might be the real Vision.  Though they both realize neither of them might be, they both seek to achieve a form close to the original.  Wanda's Vision accesses the mind of S.W.O.R.D. Vision, implanting the memories in his mind and bringing him to the new truth that he is the restored version.\r Wanda finally catches up to Agatha on the rooftops of Westview and uses her powers to send the witch back to the moment in Salem when she was tied to the stake.  Though Wanda takes her there to teach a lesson, it backfires as the coven rises from the ground and decries her as a harbringer of chaos, tying her to the stake as her powers manifest.  Agatha asks her for her powers, and in return she will correct the issues to allow her and her family to live in Westview in peace.  As they return to Westview, Wanda seems to make attempts to hand her powers over altogether.  She doesn't want them.  Everyone else has no choice but to stand by as her very lifeforce is torn from her.\r Agatha makes an attempt to use her newfound energy to cast the spell that will put an end to Wanda, locking her in her flawed dream town once and for all, but to her surprise, Wanda's picked up on a lesson used against her earlier.  As the runes take form on the walls of the hex, the magic flows back into Wanda, transforming her into her final form as the Scarlet Witch and bringing an end to Agatha's attack.  And for all Agatha did to claim the power, Wanda plans to keep the witch in Westview, stuck there playing the role of the nosy neighbour just like she set out to do.  With a quick tap, Agatha transforms into her townsperson self, none-the-wiser and trapped within, there if Wanda ever needs her.\r As Wanda takes her family home, she brings down the hex, shrinking its walls down as the sun sets on Westview.  They walk up the steps to their house and head inside to tuck in the boys.  They say their last goodbyes as Wanda thanks the twins for choosing her to be their mom.  Downstairs, looking around the home she created for her family, Wanda turns out the lights.  Vision asks her one last question before the hex comes to an end-- 'what is he?'.  She responds that he is the piece of the Mind Stone still in her.  He is wire and blood and bone.  He is her sadness, her hope, and most of all her love.  He replies that he's been a voice with no body and then a body but not human...and now a memory made real.  Who knows what he might be next?\r Wanda finds herself in the lot of their dream home in Westview, still standing in the unbuilt foundation.  She takes a walk through to the town square.  Though the citizens watch as she departs, she knows that their understanding wouldn't change how they see her.  Monica tells her it does for her; she's lost people too, and would give anything to get them back.  Wanda leaves, ascending to the sky and heading out of Westview in pursuit of the knowledge she lacks to understand her power. \n"}]}
