There, one member of each team needed to descend into the caves and perform an archaeological dig, searching for coloured fragments in a sandbox before using them to build a traditional face mask.

Once submerged, participants could feel around in the mud for a satchel containing a large gemstone and, if it happened to be a green emerald, they could bring it to the women at the nearby lake and then swim out to collect their next clue. This task was done by Brodie, Dana, Ashley, Korey, Rachel, Blair, Joslyn, Cole, Brittany, Hagan, and Cameron. \n"}, {"text": "At the Palace of Nations in Leg 4, team members needed to identify how many national flags to get their clue?", "correct": "Ten & 10", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTen & 10.\n\n\tReaching the Palace of Nations on the grounds of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, one member of each team needed to get acquainted with the flags of the world by using a provided map and locating those belonging to the ten founding members of the United Nations-- Belarus, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, India, Liberia, The Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Turkey, and Uruguay-- and providing copies of those flags to the judge.

In addition to needing to get enough momentum to take off in the deep snow, team members needed to keep their eyes peeled for a yeti waving a French flag at the bottom of their take-off point and communicate this information to the attendant waiting with their partners at the end of the flight.  After this, they could head to the next Pit Stop. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 6, which racer completed the Road Block in Armenia, successfully performing an oil change?", "correct": "Sheri", "options": ["Rachel", "Ashley", "Blair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheri.\n\n\tHeading out into the Armenian countryside on a highway near Mount Ararat, the seven racing teams needed to choose one racer per grouping to select a Lada and bring it up onto a mechanic's ramp for servicing.  With provided instructions and tools, they needed to drain the car's oil, replace the oil filter, and replenish the vehicle with new oil to get their next clue and direct their handiwork to the next Pit Stop at the Temple of Garni.  Sheri notably completed this task, but her struggle with the oil filter dropped herself and Cole from the front of the pack to last place. \n"}, {"text": "Teams had to finish a traditional Georgian ballet dance in the Leg 7 Road Block.

Ending off a lengthy two leg streak of tasks with no formal Pit Stop, this tough dance challenge involved visiting the Rustaveli National Theater to complete a dance to the approval of the institution's choreographer. \n"}, {"text": "The Express Pass was used during the Road Block in Leg 8 (in Dubai).", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tBecause they won Leg 6, Brodie and Kurt came into possession of the coveted Express Pass and were able to use it to skip the Road Block encountered at Atlantis The Palm in Leg 8.  For this task, team members descended into a shark tank in the Aquaventure Water Park in Palm Jumeirah.  There, participants collected a cylindrical puzzle that they could bring to the surface and solve to get their next clue.  Brodie, who elected to complete this Road Block, used the Express Pass to stay ahead of the other teams.  They ended up winning the leg as a result. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 9 (in Bali), all twelve remaining racers completed a Road Block task.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tFlying to the island of Bali in Leg 9, the six remaining teams hit the beaches, finding one physically demanding Road Block task pertaining to the salt industry and then traveling further along the route to find a surprise second Road Block task.

If they could identify the Pyramids of Egypt, the Colosseum, the Taj Mahal, Notre-Dame Cathedral, the merlions of Singapore, and St. Peter's Square they would find the stamps they needed and, if placed correctly in their passport book, they could trade it in for their next clue. Tyler, Dana, Burnie, and Sheri were elected to take this trip in order to even out the Road Block totals for each pairing. \n"}, {"text": "There were two Road Blocks in the final leg of the race.  The second was a memory task completed in which of these locations?", "correct": "Winery", "options": ["Harbor", "Museum", "Canyon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinery.\n\n\tWhile teams started Leg 12 with a Road Block that involved jumping off the side of a building, the last task of the game forced the remaining teammates (who didn't complete the leap) to complete the typical memory challenge for the race.  In this final challenge, team members were given numerous wine barrel lids with letters written on them and told to provide the correct order of cities visited on the race based on hashtags provided in their clues from the previous eleven legs.  If they could get them all correct, they could run to the finish line. \n"}]}
