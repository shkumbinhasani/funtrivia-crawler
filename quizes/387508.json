{"id": "387508", "name": "Horror Haikus [2] Quiz | Horror Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Let the Right One In\",\nBut American remake.\nWhat was its title?", "correct": "Let Me In", "options": ["The Lost Boys", "Dracula", "Near Dark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLet Me In.\n\n\tBased on a novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, \"Let the Right One Come In\" was regarded, upon its release in 2008, as one of the more renowned vampire films ever released.  It came as no surprise when, in 2010, an American remake was made starring Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz as a young boy and a not-so-young girl. Surprisingly, the remake ended up being fairly faithful to the original story, also being fairly well-received in the long-run.  Moretz became somewhat of a genre scream queen while director Matt Reeves (who also did \"Cloverfield\") went on to reboot the \"Planet of the Apes\" series. \n"}, {"text": "A bad STD.\nThe metaphorical foe,\nBut what horror film?", "correct": "It Follows", "options": ["Maniac", "Cooties", "Species"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt Follows.\n\n\tA slow-burn indie horror film from 2014, \"It Follows\" hit the festival circuit in Cannes, quickly attaining a cult following and critical appraise for its tone, creepy atmosphere, and metaphorical take on sexually-transmitted diseases.  A girl in the film, after sleeping with her boyfriend, found herself to be followed by a ghostly spirit of some sort; the only way to survive the encounters was to pass it on to the next person.  Film star Maika Monroe also appeared in Adam Wingard's film \"The Guest\". \n"}, {"text": "In which of these films\nDoes Ethan Hawke write a book\nThen meet a Bughuul?", "correct": "Sinister", "options": ["The Conjuring", "Insidious", "Husk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSinister.\n\n\tSent to theaters in 2012, this mystery-but-soon-ghost-story starred Ethan Hawke as a true crime writer who, along with his family, moved into the house of a family found murdered in their backyard.  What followed was his quick investigation into an exceedingly-more-paranormal crime than supposed, leading him to be another in a long chain of supernatural murders involving children and a Pagan deity known only as Bughuul.  The movie was popular enough to warrant a sequel which, when released in 2015, was panned by critics. \n"}, {"text": "Does Black Phillip speak?\nYou can find out if he does\nIn what creepy film?", "correct": "The Witch", "options": ["The Sacrament", "The Woods", "The House of the Devil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Witch.\n\n\tReleased in 2015, \"The Witch\" was the feature-length directorial debut of filmmaker Robert Eggers who set his movie in the Puritan days of early New England and followed a family living on the outskirts of a forest, struggling to survive the harsh times while also worrying about the fury wrought upon them by their God in the form of what may or may not have been a witch in the woods.  Genre newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy subsequently found roles in \"Morgan\" and the M. Night Shyamalan film \"Split\" in 2016. \n"}, {"text": "What's outside the door?\nIt might be apocalypse,\nBut in what movie?", "correct": "10 Cloverfield Lane", "options": ["You're Next", "Citadel", "The Bay"], "explanation": "\n\n\n10 Cloverfield Lane.\n\n\tIn this film starring John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and John Gallagher, Jr., a trio of people ended up in a bunker beneath an old farm.  Winstead, who barely survived a car crash, was brought into the bunker to discover that the world may have ended outside.  What she found, however, was that it may have been just as dangerous inside the bunker as it could have been outside in this psychological thriller from J.J. Abrams' \"Cloverfield\" franchise.  Director Dan Trachtenberg later filmed the 'Playtest' episode of \"Black Mirror\" on Netflix. \n"}, {"text": "Lost under Paris.\nIn which of these four movies\nAre the catacombs?", "correct": "As Above, So Below", "options": ["Underworld", "Get Out", "The Tunnel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs Above, So Below.\n\n\tWhile this 2014 found-footage film didn't get too much attention upon release, opinion of it smoothed out over time.  The movie, actually filmed in the Catacombs of Paris, was directed by John Erick Dowdle (known for \"Devil\" and \"Quarantine\") and saw a group of urban explorers head into the tunnels looking for Nicholas Flamel's Philosopher's Stone only to find what could only be described as a trip into Hell ripped straight from Dante's \"Inferno\". \n"}, {"text": "Short films aplenty,\nAll of them tape-recorded,\nCompiled in what film?", "correct": "V/H/S", "options": ["The ABCs of Death", "Southbound", "Holidays"], "explanation": "\n\n\nV/H/S.\n\n\t\"V/H/S\", a series of short films, all done in the found-footage style as though being watched on cassette tapes, was first released in 2012, appearing at Sundance to acclaim from the horror community for its varied styles and tales.  Bringing together several emerging directors (including Adam Wingard, Ti West, and David Bruckner), five different stories, framed by one additional narrative, created the first movie in the series, brought together by horror fansite Bloody Disgusting.  Two sequels followed. \n"}, {"text": "It's a board game film\nBut, y'know, a ghost story.\nWhat's its sequel called?", "correct": "Ouija: Origin of Evil", "options": ["The Final Destination", "Ghost Game", "Annabelle 2"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOuija: Origin of Evil.\n\n\tThe original \"Ouija\" horror film, released in 2014, was critically panned for positing the question, 'What if Hasbro's popular board game could actually kill you?'  So naturally, because of high box office earnings, Hasbro decided to continue asking this question, roping in \"Oculus\" and \"Absentia\" director Mike Flanagan and releasing \"Ouija: Origin of Evil\", a surprisingly cohesive film looking into the origins of the ghost in the first movie.  Since the first movie exists, you can imagine how it panned out. \n"}, {"text": "Remade shot-for-shot,\nWhat Eli Roth gore movie\nFeatured a virus?", "correct": "Cabin Fever", "options": ["The Strain", "Hostel", "Bug"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCabin Fever.\n\n\tWhile Eli Roth's debut film \"Cabin Fever\" was released in 2002, it only took 14 years before someone decided a shot-for-shot remake was necessary and relevant instead of continuing a long streak of straight-to-video sequels that weren't really going anywhere.  So we got a remake, literally note-for-note, which saw a new (or the same?) group of people heading to a cabin in the woods for a getaway only to get a flesh-eating virus spread through the local water.  Eli Roth produced the film, directed by someone named Travis Z, and it scored a rare 0% on Rotten Tomatoes.  The original scored 63%. \n"}, {"text": "A ghost-hunting team\nLost in an institution.\nWhich is the movie?", "correct": "Grave Encounters", "options": ["Autopsy", "Absentia", "Session 9"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrave Encounters.\n\n\tAnother found-footage offering, this Canadian movie from the Vicious Brothers placed what was allegedly a ghost-hunting TV crew in a reportedly-haunted asylum, forcing them to determine the truth behind the hauntings there in a single night.  What followed was their final episode, which saw them locked away in a building of purely supernatural design, unable to escape as creatures of other planes lashed out.  The original came out in 2010; a sequel was later released in 2012. \n"}]}
