{"id": "366000", "name": "\"Protect the Coven\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Coven"], "questions": [{"text": "Delphine brought her first victims with her from Paris.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tArriving in New Orleans for the first time after living in Paris for years, Delphine LaLaurie moved into her manor with her daughters, something she found insufferable.  The year was 1830, and she needed something to occupy her time.  Borquita suggested crochet; Delphine hated the idea.  When Borquita caught a chicken in the yard and refused to kill it for dinner, Delphine, knowing that kitchen help wouldn't arrive until the day after, had to kill it herself. As the blood flowed through her hands she got a taste for her new hobby.  Up in the attic, a slave broke his leg trying to stack boxes and Delphine, relishing in the opportunity, decided to tie him up and bleed him out. This was her first victim. \n"}, {"text": "Where is the coven when Queenie returns to them?", "correct": "A funeral", "options": ["A church sermon", "In the greenhouse", "A movie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA funeral.\n\n\tThe coven, including Kyle, head to the graveyard to bury Nan who, as Fiona claims during the eulogy, drowned in the tub.  The others are not aware that she and Marie murdered her as an offering for Papa Legba.  As they begin to depart, Queenie drives up with Delphine on a leash; both of them survived the massacre at Laveau's salon and Queenie was able to use her magic to reattach LaLaurie's head and hand to her body.  There is a great amount of dissent amongst all of the women present and they head back to the academy.  Misty, who could have resurrected Nan, remains missing.\r In Atlanta, Delphi Trust covers up the massacre led by Hank Foxx, Renard's son.  He complains that his son will not be remembered by anyone else, and oddly, they need the witches to rebuild their corporation.  When they do, they'll strike back. \n"}, {"text": "Delphine, now back at the academy, ends up torturing who of the following?", "correct": "The gardener", "options": ["The electrician", "The plumber", "The butler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe gardener.\n\n\tDelphine, now back to being a maid at Miss Robicheaux's, serves Fiona and Marie while they plan their meeting with Delphi Trust.  As she cleans up for the others, she ends up finding ways of getting back at her tormenters, inevitably serving them literal refuse for dinner.  Marie Laveau constantly threatens her, planning to scatter her parts around the city to avoid seeing her come back together again. When she isn't serving them all, she's plotting and contemplating what drove her all those years ago.  When a gardener comes in having cut himself digging up fig trees, she takes charge, bringing him up to Spalding's old attic room, tying him up, and cutting him to pieces. \n"}, {"text": "Who is first to discover the truth about Nan's death?", "correct": "Zoe", "options": ["Madison", "Cordelia", "Queenie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZoe.\n\n\tZoe, still unsure about the circumstances surrounding Nan's drowning, heads to the bathroom, lights candles, and performs a seance with Kyle.  There, she sees Fiona and Marie reflected in the bathtub, implicating them directly.  When she tells Madison, there's little sympathy; Zoe tells her that they should've left her dead.  What follows is an argument over Kyle and the two come to blows (with magic).  Kyle ends up saying that he loves Zoe and Myrtle has to come in to stop the battle.  Madison selfishly states that when she's the new Supreme, they'll all have to bow to her anyway. \n"}, {"text": "What does Spalding want from Delphine in exchange for his assistance?", "correct": "A doll", "options": ["Money", "Life", "Revenge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA doll.\n\n\tFiona redresses herself after an evening with the Axeman while he plays the saxophone.  He talks about taking her to a farm, the only ray of light in his dark world for many years, so that they can spend the rest of their days there together.  She laughs about the idea; it's not her type of life.  He says that she'll, otherwise, need to kill the next Supreme if she wants a chance at living on.  When they do, he'll give up the axe and she'll give up the coven.  She agrees to the deal, but only if he does one thing for her.\r Delphine, disappointed that her victim isn't responding, realizes that Spalding has been watching her.  He commends her for her work on the body and reveals that he was murdered.  He also says that she needs to find her purpose or, else-wise, release.  He has a way though: Marie Laveau has to die.  Spalding feels that Fiona is confused, and the only way to protect her is if he can find a way for Laveau to die, so they have a common goal.  He will provide her with the means if she retrieves an item for her...a doll. \n"}, {"text": "Cordelia, in an attempt to protect the coven, blinds herself.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tCordelia, trying to find a way to contribute to the upkeep of the coven in the face of danger, heads to Queenie's room to speak to her privately.  She finds that Queenie is extremely angry, even though she left the coven on her own accord.  Cordelia's husband shot her, but she survived the silver bullet to the brain so she feels like she may very well be the next Supreme.  Cordelia says that she just wants to help the girls, but Queenie insists she's as weak as ever and sends her out.\rCordelia, distraught, heads to the greenhouse and mixes a concoction.  Rubbing the mixture around her eyes, she takes a pair of pruning shears and plunges into each eyeball, blinding herself once again in a last-ditch effort to regain her second sight. \n"}, {"text": "What does Spalding give to Delphine to stop Marie Laveau?", "correct": "Benadryl", "options": ["Ginger", "Wolfsbane", "Silver bullets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBenadryl.\n\n\tFiona rushes home to find Myrtle protecting Cordelia's room.  Cordelia is in pain, but she's resting.  Myrtle asserts that the girl is a hero-- she blinded herself once again in a selfless attempt to save the coven from its own destruction.  Fiona is accused of being a liar and a threat before she heads out.\r Up in the attic, Delphine makes her delivery.  It cost a lot, but she got Spalding the doll he wanted.  He mans up on the potion she needs to render the voodoo queen defenseless: a few capsules of Benadryl.  He urges her never to say the name. \n"}, {"text": "To save her from any danger, Myrtle gives Zoe tickets to which destination?", "correct": "Florida", "options": ["California", "Mexico", "New York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlorida.\n\n\tMyrtle calls Zoe to the greenhouse while she plays her theremin because there's a matter of grave importance.  She hands over her most-valued possession, an item from jeweler Joel Arthur Rosenthal, and tells her to hock it for cash; she and Kyle need to flee from the coven immediately to avoid Fiona's wrath.  She hands over bus tickets and insists that she leave immediately, hopping on a bus and taking a trip to Florida.  They embrace as Zoe goes to pack. \n"}, {"text": "What happens to Delphi Trust?", "correct": "They are killed", "options": ["They agree to a life-long truce", "They do not arrive in New Orleans", "They attempt to kill the witches"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are killed.\n\n\tThe representatives of Delphi Trust arrive at the aforementioned location along with Marie and Fiona (who order drinks from their waiter...The Axeman) as the men of Delphi begin to spell out their deal.  In exchange for pulling their foundation out of bankruptcy, they want to strike a one hundred year truce with the witches, effectively ending witch-hunting in their lifetimes. Fiona doesn't agree with this; she wants an eternal truce, Renard's expensive house, and a private jet for Marie.  The representatives don't appreciate the joke and Fiona reneges on this, instead offering that they die.  This is when The Axeman strikes, killing all but Renard and leaving him to talk to Fiona who, in a moment, takes the axe from her lover and strikes him in the neck with one fatal blow.\n"}, {"text": "Who is ultimately able to knock out Marie Laveau?", "correct": "Spalding", "options": ["Myrtle", "Delphine", "Fiona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpalding.\n\n\tMarie and Fiona celebrate over drinks before the latter heads out to spend the night with The Axeman.  Delphine decides that it's the perfect time to enact her revenge.  Using the Benadryl in the drinks, she takes a knife and plunges it into the voodoo queen's chest but, surprisingly, she's unfazed (as she is immortal)...after all, Benadryl is just an antihistamine.  Delphine runs downstairs with Marie in pursuit but, as the witch reaches the top of the stairs she's knocked out from behind by Spalding who says that she can not die-- she's immortal-- but she is out of his hair.  Delphine will just have to ensure she can't come back.  Spalding, meanwhile, takes the baby she stole as his own living doll.\r Zoe and Kyle pack their belongings and, after some convincing, Zoe is able to persuade her boyfriend to head to the bus station with her.  With all of their things, and each other, they hop on the bus to Orlando and leave New Orleans, and the coven, behind. \n"}]}
