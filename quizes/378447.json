{"id": "378447", "name": "The Oddball Couple Quiz | Something in Common | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", " People Themed Groups"], "questions": [{"text": "In which monster movie, starring Lon Chaney Jr and Bela Lugosi, did Bela play a character named Bela?", "correct": "The Wolf Man", "options": ["Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man", "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein", "Ghost of Frankenstein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wolf Man.\n\n\tIn \"The Wolf Man\" Bela played a gypsy named Bela, who killed a woman after becoming a wolf and bit Talbot, played by Lon Chaney Jr.  Talbot killed the wolf with a silver-handled cane and the wolf turned back into Bela, which made Talbot be suspected of murder.  Of course, this is the famous movie in which Talbot (Lon) later became \"The Wolf Man\" and started killing people under each full moon.  The old gypsy woman told him Bela had been cursed until Talbot had killed him with the cane.  Eventually, Talbot's father killed him with the same cane. \n"}, {"text": "In which movie, starring our couple, did Frankenstein's monster want a little girl's brain to be put inside the monster?", "correct": "Ghost of Frankenstein", "options": ["Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein", "The Wolf Man", "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGhost of Frankenstein.\n\n\tIn the movie \"Ghost of Frankenstein\", which gets its title from one scene in which a son of Dr. Frankenstein supposedly talks to his father's ghost, the monster knows his brain isn't right so he kidnaps a little girl and wants the doctor to replace his brain with the little girl's brain.  The movie was a continuation of \"Son of Frankenstein\". In this movie the monster woke up and the townspeople saw him with a little girl. Three doctors, including another Dr. Frankenstein, decide to do experiments on the monster.  Before seeing the movie, I read a book about the story, and thought it was one of the crazier Frankenstein stories. \n"}, {"text": "What part did Bela Lugosi play in \"Son of Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "Ygor", "options": ["Dr. Frankenstein", "The monster", "The burgomeister"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYgor.\n\n\tBela Lugosi played Ygor, the crooked-necked criminal who was friends with the monster in \"Son of Frankenstein\", with Boris Karloff as the monster.  He also played Ygor in \"Ghost of Frankenstein\" when Lon Chaney Jr played the monster, who could not speak, so Ygor had to translate what the monster wanted, much like Chico did with Harpo. \n"}, {"text": "Whose brain did end up in the monster by the end of \"Ghost of Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "Ygor's", "options": ["Jack the Ripper's", "The little girl's", "Dr. Frankenstein's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYgor's.\n\n\tI know it's the same answer twice, but it couldn't be helped. Ygor wanted to be big and strong like the monster, and convinced another doctor to put his brain into the monster, who spoke with Bela's voice at the end of the movie.  However, Dr. Frankenstein explained that the monster was a different blood type, and rejected Ygor's brain, making the monster go blind. \n"}, {"text": "What did Bela play in \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\"?", "correct": "Frankenstein's monster", "options": ["The wolf man", "The mad doctor", "Ygor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrankenstein's monster.\n\n\tAfter having his brain and voice put into the monster in \"Ghost of Frankenstein\", it was decided Bela should play the monster this time with Lon returning as the wolf man.  The movie was filmed with the monster speaking in Bela's voice. The monster was blind, but audiences laughed when the monster spoke with Bela's accent, although Bela played the part, so the movie was edited with references of the monster's blindness and speech being deleted. \n"}, {"text": "Who played Dracula in \"House of Dracula\"?", "correct": "John Carradine", "options": ["Bela Lugosi", "Lon Chaney Jr", "Boris Karloff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Carradine.\n\n\tConsidered for the part of Dracula in the first movie, when the part went to Bela, John Carradine again played Dracula as he had in \"House of Frankenstein\" with Lon again playing as the wolf man, but there was no fight between Dracula and the wolf man in those two movies, and they really didn't even meet each other.  John Carradine played Dracula three times, and did many classic movies, including \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and \"Johnny Guitar\".  He had three sons who became actors: Robert, David, and Keith. \n"}, {"text": "Who played Dracula in \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "Bela Lugosi", "options": ["Lon Chaney Jr", "John Carradine", "Boris Karloff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBela Lugosi.\n\n\tIt was a bit of a reunion, with Lon and Bela together again, but this time they fought as the wolf man and Dracula, while the monster threw a woman doctor through a window.  The story involved Dracula, acting like a mad scientist, looking for a different brain to put into the monster.  He decided Lou Costello's brain might be easier to control.  I always thought the TV show \"The Munsters\" was the result of putting Lou's brain in Frankenstein's monster, and showing what might happen if the monster married Dracula's daughter. \n"}, {"text": "Who played Dracula in \"Son of Dracula\"?", "correct": "Lon Chaney Jr", "options": ["John Carradine", "Bela Lugosi", "Boris Karloff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLon Chaney Jr.\n\n\tAlthough it was called \"Son of Dracula\", everyone acted like Lon was Dracula, although he called himself Alucard (\"Dracula\" spelled backward).  Right about the time Boris stopped playing Frankenstein's monster and Bela stopped playing Dracula, Lon stepped in to try those parts.  The most interesting scene was when a man shot Dracula, but the bullet hit the man's girl friend, who was hiding behind Dracula at the time. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these movies did Lon Chaney NOT play as the mummy?", "correct": "The Mummy's Hand", "options": ["The Mummy's Curse", "The Mummy's Tomb", "The Mummy's Hand ", "The Mummy's Ghost"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mummy's Hand.\n\n\tLon Chaney Jr played as the mummy in \"The Mummy's Tomb\", \"The Mummy's Ghost\", and \"The Mummy's Curse\".  Tom Tyler played as the mummy in \"The Mummy's Hand\", and, of course, Boris Karloff, who was only wrapped up in the opening scene, played as the mummy in \"The Mummy\".  Tom Tyler became a Western movie star, and some of his scenes were repeated in some on the sequels to \"The Mummy\".  You could say the forties movies really were not sequels, but retold the story from the first movie, and dragged it out to four movies. \n"}, {"text": "What were Frankenstein's monster and the wolf man doing when the doctor found them in the movie \"House of Frankenstein\"?", "correct": "They were frozen and sleeping.", "options": ["They were fighting.", "They were running.", "They were throwing rocks at the villagers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey were frozen and sleeping.\n\n\tAt the beginning of \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\", Larry Talbot, played by Lon, had found Frankenstein's monster frozen, underground.  At the end of that movie they were drowned when the dam was exploded with dynamite by the barkeep who wanted to kill the monsters.  Assuming they drowned but were somehow frozen, Dr. Niemann (Boris Karloff) found Talbot, still in the form of the wolf man, and Frankenstein's monster frozen underground.  This time Glenn Strange (the bartender in \"Gunsmoke\") played as the monster. \n"}]}
