{"id": "389371", "name": "Hardest The Families of Genesis Trivia Quiz | Old Testament / Tanakh | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "  Old Testament / Tanakh", " Genesis"], "questions": [{"text": "Adam and Eve had three children (at least). We all know Cain and Abel, but who was their third son?", "correct": "Seth", "options": ["Samuel", "Samson", "Silas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeth.\n\n\tThe name Seth means either anointed or compensation. In a way, Seth was compensation for the death of Abel. Abel was killed by Cain in Genesis 4:8. In the NIV it says, \"Now Cain said to his brother Abel, 'Let's go out to the field.' While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.\" You can first read about Seth in Genesis 4:25 which says, \"Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, 'God has granted me another child in place of Abel since Cain killed him.'\"(also NIV)\r  (Ilona_Ritter) \n"}, {"text": "Genesis states that there were two different Lamechs who became fathers in genealogies. One Lamech was Noah's father (Genesis 5:30). Based on Genesis 4:19-26 (New American Standard Bible) which of these was NOT a child of the other Lamech? ", "correct": "Jeremiah", "options": ["Jubal ", "Naamah ", "Tubal-cain "], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeremiah.\n\n\tChapters 4 and 5 of Genesis provide information about these two entirely different men named Lamech and their families. The first Lamech was a descendant of Cain. This Lamech became, as far as we know, the world's first polygamist. He married two women, Adah and Zillah. Adah gave birth to Jubal and Jabal, two sons who ironically have very similar names. As for Zillah, she had a son, Tubal-cain, and a daughter, Naamah.  \r Now, the second Lamech was a descendant of Seth. We don't know the name of this Lamech's wife because the Bible doesn't tell us. However, their child was Noah, the righteous man who survived the global flood, according to Genesis 6 and 7. Lamech became the grandfather of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. \r (Ced-uh) \n"}, {"text": "In the story of the Flood (Genesis 6-8), God promised to save Noah and his family.  According to the NIV Bible, of the eight people who entered the ark, how many are explicitly named?", "correct": "4", "options": ["8", "2", "6"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4.\n\n\tSee Genesis 7:13.  The people were: Noah, his wife, his three sons, Ham, Shem and Japheth and the sons' wives.  Neither Noah's wife nor his sons' wives are mentioned by name. Noah's sons are named in chapter 6 verse 9.\r (cal562301) \n"}, {"text": "Most people know that Methuselah lived to 969 years old - the oldest person in recorded Bible history. But what about Methuselah's ancestor Adam, the first man? How long did Adam live before he died?", "correct": "930 years", "options": ["962 years", "365 years", "912 years"], "explanation": "\n\n\n930 years.\n\n\tAdam, Methuselah's great-great-great-great-great grandad, did indeed live 930 years. Of the incorrect choices, it was Enoch that made it to the age of 365 years before God took him out of this world without Enoch experiencing death. The King James version of The Bible was used for this question; Genesis 5:3-28.\r (rreddman95) \n"}, {"text": "Jacob, the father of Joseph, died in Egypt. In what land did Jacob command Joseph to bury him?", "correct": "Canaan", "options": ["Beulah", "Goshen", "Samaria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanaan.\n\n\tJacob instructed Joseph to bury him in the family burial plot in Canaan. Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah and Leah were also buried there.\r (rredman95) \n"}, {"text": "In Genesis 32 of the NIV, what name did Jacob give to the place where he wrestled with an angel?", "correct": "Peniel", "options": ["Reuel", "Bethel", "Shabal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeniel.\n\n\tSee verse 30. Jacob says that he saw God face to face and his life was spared. In Hebrew this name means 'face of God'.\r Bethel is the place where Jacob had the dream about a ladder going up to heaven and angels ascending and descending on it (see chapter 28).\r Reuel and Shabal are two of the descendants of Esau listed in Genesis 36.\r (cal562301) \n"}, {"text": "After Joseph was in Egypt and became Pharaoh's right-hand man he married one of the Egyptians there. What was her name? (KJV)", "correct": "Asenath", "options": ["Abigail", "Azrael ", "Anna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsenath.\n\n\tAsenath's name means \"Peril or misfortune\". Joseph and Asenath had two sons. The first born was Ephraim and the second was Manasseh. You can read about this in Genesis 41:45-50 and then in Genesis 46:20-22.\r Later on, the Bible says Jacob was dying he blessed his two grandchildren. However, like Isaac did with Jacob and Esau, he gave Manasseh the younger son the best blessing. He said to Manasseh, \"And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.\" KJV You can read all about this in Genesis chapter 48. \r (Ilona_Ritter) \n"}, {"text": "Genesis 25 states that Abraham had a son by his other wife, Keturah, and his name was Midian. Which of these was a son of Midian? ", "correct": "Ephah", "options": ["Ephah ", "Nebaioth", "Esau ", "Mishma "], "explanation": "\n\n\nEphah.\n\n\tKeturah was Abraham's second main wife; he evidently married her after Sarah died. If you count Hagar, Ishmael's mother, as a wife, then Keturah would be his third wife. However, Genesis 25:12 identifies Hagar as Sarah's maid. Some people consider Hagar Abraham's wife based on Genesis 16:3. \r At any rate, Keturah bore Abraham six sons, more than any other woman did. \r Genesis 25:2, New American Standard Bible:\r\"She bore to him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.\" \r Genesis 25:4:\r\"The sons of Midian were Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the [grand]sons of Keturah.\" \r Midian and his children were the ancestors of the Midianites. Moses' wife, Zipporah, was a Midianite. See Exodus 2:15. \r (Ced-uh) \n"}, {"text": "There's no shortage of dysfunctional families in Genesis. Take Judah, for example, one of the sons of Jacob, grandson of Isaac and great-grandson of Abraham. He had twin sons named Perez and Zerah by his own daughter-in-law. What was her name?", "correct": "Tamar", "options": ["Dinah", "Serah", "Bath-shua"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTamar.\n\n\tThe account is in Genesis 38. Briefly, Judah had three sons - Er, Onan and Shelah. It was Er who married Tamar but produced no sons by the time of his death. According to the custom of the time (levirate marriage), Tamar was passed to Onan so that a son of the union could be counted as a son of Er. Onan, too, died without producing a son (distasteful details omitted) so Tamar expected to be passed on to Shelah. Judah, however, was reluctant to lose a third son, so stalled matters for a long time. Tamar grew impatient and, disguised as a prostitute, enticed Judah. The fruits of that union were Perez and Zerah. Perez became an ancestor of Jesus, as recorded in Matthew 1:3 and Luke 3:33.\r Of the incorrect alternatives, Dinah was Judah's sister, Bath-shua was his wife and Serah was his brother Asher's daughter and therefore his niece.\r (Watchkeeper) \n"}, {"text": "Genesis 14 relates the Battle of the Nine Kings, after which Abraham's nephew Lot is kidnapped along with his family and possessions. Abraham musters a small army which includes three brothers who are allied to him, pursues the enemy and frees Lot. The three brothers are named below, but who is the interloper?", "correct": "Phicol", "options": ["Aner", "Mamre", "Eshcol"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhicol.\n\n\tThe three brothers, Mamre, Eshcol and Aner, are named in Genesis 14:13 & 14:24. \r Phicol was commander of Philistine king Abimelech's army, mentioned in separate incidents in Genesis 21 and 26.\r (Watchkeeper) \n"}]}
