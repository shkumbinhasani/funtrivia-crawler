Although I had never hit 40 home runs in a season before, I popped for 61 in 1961, breaking Babe Ruth's record of 60 in 1927.  It created the biggest asterisk in baseball because I did it in a 162-game season while the Babe did it in a 154-game season.  Who am I?", "correct": "Roger Maris", "options": ["Mark McGwire", "Willie Stargell", "Sammy Sosa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoger Maris.\n\n\tThe others hadn't begun their careers yet in 1961.  Maris won the American League MVP for his efforts in 1961, but few know that he also won the MVP in 1960 over Yankee teammate Mickey Mantle and Orioles' Brook Robinson.  Maris' home run mark and the asterisk was erased from baseball in 1998 when Mark McGwire of the Cardinals hit 70 home runs of his own in the season.  Ironically, Maris retired as a Cardinal in 1968. \n"}, {"text": "I died in 1946, and rolled over in my grave when my name was used as a slang term for a component of the male anatomy.  I won three Triple Crowns in my career as a result of my arm.  My arm made my name and no other part of the body.  I was also a two-time MVP.  I spent my entire 21-season career with the Senators, but went to only two World Series.  Who am I that was the second pitcher in history to reach 400 wins in their career?", "correct": "Walter Johnson", "options": ["Warren Spahn", "Cy Young", "Christy Mathewson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalter Johnson.\n\n\tJohnson played his entire Major League career in a Senators' uniform from 1907-1927.  He also won the seasons MVP in 1913 and 1924.  His other Triple Crown season in 1918, there was no MVP award given out.  Walter was a 1936 Hall of Fame inductee in its inaugural session along with the great Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Ty Cobb, and Christy Mathewson.  Johnson's only World Series ring came in 1924 against the New York Giants.  He retired in 1927 with 417 wins in his career, second only to Cy Young's 511. \n"}, {"text": "I had a big mysterious pitch in baseball that tailed in many different directions.  Unfortunately, it was later named the 'spitball'.  I was the first pitcher in history to win the Cy Young award in both the American and National League.  In 22 seasons, I was a Giant, Indian, Ranger, Padre, Yankee, Brave, Mariner, and even a Kansas City Royal.  My Cy Young awards came in 1972 and 1978.  Who am I?", "correct": "Gaylord Perry", "options": ["Joey Jay", "Bill Monbouquette", "Gene Conley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGaylord Perry.\n\n\tThe others listed never played for the Indians or Padres, or played in the 1970s.  After 10 loyal seasons with the Giants of San Francisco, the team traded Gaylord along with Frank Duffy to the Indians for pitcher Sam McDowell.  Perry paid the Giants back by going 24-16 and winning the AL Cy Young award the following season. After playing for some seasons with the Rangers, Texas traded Gaylord for Dave Tomlin who had only seven at-bats in the 1977 season, and cash to the San Diego Padres in 1978.  Perry again paid his previous team back by winning the Cy Young award again by going 21-6.  Perry was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1991. \n"}, {"text": "After never hitting more than 31 home runs in a season, I emerged with a big bat by hitting 57 in 2001 with the Diamondbacks.  Almost 1/3 of my hits in the season were home runs, but I still finished third in home runs with 57.  Who am I?", "correct": "Luis Gonzalez", "options": ["Jeff Bagwell", "Shawn Green", "Larry Walker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuis Gonzalez.\n\n\tThe others never played for the Diamondbacks.  Gonzalez in his 12th season in the Majors, banged out 57 home runs but still took a backseat to Mark McGwire who hit 70 and Sammy Sosa's 64.  Gonzalez had 198 hits in the season and batted .325 along with his 142 RBIs. \n"}, {"text": "I had a big bat in 1930.  This was the season that I created most of my career highs in the Major Leagues.  As a member of the Cubs, I hit 56 home runs, the only time in my career that I reached the 40-plateau.  I also hit a career high .356 along with 191 RBIs.  The only reason that I did not win the National League MVP was because they did not award it in the 1930 season.  Who am I that was a 1979 Hall of Fame inductee?", "correct": "Hack Wilson", "options": ["Jimmy Piersall", "Joe Adcock", "Lew Burdette"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHack Wilson.\n\n\tThe others would not make their Major League debuts for another 20+ seasons.  After finishing eighth in the MVP voting in 1929, baseball did not vote on an MVP in 1930, so Lewis Robert 'Hack' Wilson missed out on his immortality in baseball.  Wilson played for only 12 seasons.  He wore the uniforms of the Giants, Cubs, Dodgers, and Phillies, retiring in 1934. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout my 21-season career I was accused of having a big head.  Even after retiring in 1987 with Oakland, I just couldn't shake my arrogant past because I always had a big month in October.  I retired with 563 home runs and was inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame all by myself in 1993.  Who am I?", "correct": "Reggie Jackson", "options": ["Steve Garvey", "Ozzie Smith", "Tony Gwynn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReggie Jackson.\n\n\tThe others listed never played for the Athletics and never hit over 300 home runs in their career.  Ironically, in Reggie's last season in 1987, he handed over the Athletics' torch to rookie Mark McGwire who hit a record 49 home runs.  Jackson's 'Mr. October' nickname came as a result of him stepping up in the playoffs and hitting big home runs.  In the 1977 World Series against the Dodgers, Reggie was in a Yankee uniform.  He hit a home run in game four, game five, then three in game six.  The Yankees won the series four games to two, and Jackson was the World Series MVP. \n"}, {"text": "My big bang came with my arm in 1968.  I won 31 games in a season, the first time since someone won that many in 1934.  Unfortunately, my 1968 season was the beginning of my end.  Although I won 24 games in the 1969 season with the Tigers, my next season was 3-5, then 10-22.  After that, it was jail time for me.  Who am I?", "correct": "Denny McLain", "options": ["Jim Maloney", "Bob Gibson", "Sandy Koufax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDenny McLain.\n\n\tMcLain was on top of the world with teammate pitcher Mickey Lolich.  However, McLain crashed after the 1969 season, allegedly being involved with drugs and the betting bookies.  Denny was banned from baseball after the 1972 season and spent some time in jail.  The previous pitcher that won 30 games in a season was Dizzy Dean of the Cardinals, who went 30-7 in 1934, winning his own NL MVP award. \n"}, {"text": "At the age of 29, I set a baseball record for winning 59 games in the 1884 season.  This was mainly due to many rule changes in baseball, and too many records were set between 1884-1889 before baseball changed their ways again.  At any rate, I started 73 games in the season and went 59-12 with 441 strikeouts.  This is why Major League baseball did not begin their official stats under consistent rules until 1920.  Who am I? ", "correct": "Charley Radbourn", "options": ["Jimmie Dykes", "Kiki Cuyler", "Tom Zachary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharley Radbourn.\n\n\tThe others would not appear in professional baseball for another 30+ years.  Amazingly, but figuring the rules set-up in the late 1800s were for the pitchers, Charley, nicknamed 'Old Hoss', won 309 games in only 11 seasons in his career.  He won 48 in the season prior in 1883, but never again reached the 35-plateau for wins after 1884.  In 1884 in his stellar season, his Providence Grays won the National League pennant. 1884 saw a major rule change that allowed pitchers to throw over-hand and release the ball above the waist.  Charley took great advantage to this.  Radbourne was a 1939 Hall of Fame inductee. \n"}, {"text": "Although I hit 184 home runs in five full seasons, I wasn't recognized until I hit 52 in my sixth, then 57 home runs in my seventh season.  In 2003, I hit another 47 as a Ranger before the Yankees recognized me, then became a member of the pinstripes in 2004.  Who am I that had to switch from the shortstop position, to a Yankee third baseman?", "correct": "Alex Rodriguez", "options": ["Ron Cey", "Brooks Robinson", "Mike Schmidt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlex Rodriguez.\n\n\tThe others retired from baseball prior to 1990.  A-Rod played his first seven seasons with the Seattle Mariners before being signed as a free agent in 2001 by the Texas Rangers.  In 2004, the Rangers traded Rodriguez with cash to the Yankees for Alfonso Soriano.  With the Yankees, A-Rod gave way his shortstop position to Derek Jeter and played third base. \n"}, {"text": "First came Ty Cobb with his record-setting 96 stolen bases in a season in 1915.  Then came Maury Wills of the Dodgers in 1962, becoming the first player to break the 100 stolen base barrier.  However, I made it more amazing when I broke Wills' record by stealing 118 bases at the amazing age of 35 in 1974.  I had some big feet in that season.  Who am I?", "correct": "Lou Brock", "options": ["Vince Coleman", "Eric Davis", "Tim Raines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLou Brock.\n\n\tThe others never stole more than 10 bases in a season after turning the age of 35, which made Brock's record even more special.  Lou Brock was with the Cardinals in his 14th season of baseball when he broke this remarkable base stealing record in 1974.  Brock played his entire 21-season career with the Cubs and mostly Cardinals, retiring in 1979. \n"}]}
