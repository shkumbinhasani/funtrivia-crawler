In an effort to curb the amount of recyclable materials being tossed out with general waste, the Blue Box was introduced in the mid-eighties.  Most of all recyclable materials can be placed inside from glass and plastic to cardboard and paper.  These are collected separately from garbage pick-ups.  Some areas in Canada's major cities also use Green Boxes for compost and recycling. \n"}, {"text": "Kyle shall examine the properties of the Yellow Box.\nThe Yellow Box is actually the name of a specific plant in the Eucalyptus family.  Where can Yellow Box be found?", "correct": "Australia", "options": ["Brazil", "Fiji", "Madagascar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAustralia.\n\n\tBox Eucalyptus plants typically have short, stringy bark as opposed to more rough trunks like others in their family.  For the most part, Eucalyptus trees are only native to Australia, and the Yellow Box is no exception.  In fact, White Box, Grey Box, Red Box, and Black Box are other species of eucalyptus trees found throughout the continent. Yellow Box, also known by the name 'Eucalyptus Melliodora' is found primarily in the southeast regions of Australia (ie. New South Wales).  There are hundreds of different types of Eucalyptus trees in the world, the majority of which are found in the Oceanic regions. \n"}, {"text": "Now, witness Kyle pop a copy of Red Box into the CD player.\nIn which decade did the British band Red Box form?", "correct": "1980s", "options": ["1990s", "2000s", "1970s"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1980s.\n\n\tRed Box, a British band which formed in 1983, was moderately well-known in the mid-eighties for their song \"Lean on Me (Ah-Li-Ayo)\" from their debut CD, \"The Circle & the Square\".  The single reached #3 on the UK Pop Charts before sliding back down while the CD, released in 1986, reached the tenth position on the UK Albums chart.  The band also released an album in 1990 known as \"Motive\" though it didn't gain any notice in a year when music styles began changing.  It took nearly two more decades before Red Box began working on a new CD. \n"}, {"text": "Kyle begins to play a copy of \"The Orange Box\".\nWhich video game series is \"The Orange Box\" a part of?", "correct": "Half-Life", "options": ["Doom", "Metroid", "Mortal Kombat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalf-Life.\n\n\t\"Half-Life\", created by Valve in 1998, became a forerunner for first-person shooters and physics-based engines as it progressed.  Known for its graphical capabilities, the games have become quite popular, selling millions of units over its lifespan.  \"The Orange Box\" was a treat for fans.  Playable on the Xbox 360, the Playstation 3, and the PC, \"Orange Box\" included \"Half-Life 2\", \"Episode 1\", \"Episode 2\", \"Team Fortress 2\", and \"Portal\" (perhaps the most famous on the set).  The set was one of the most critically-acclaimed games of 2007 receiving consistently perfect scores from reviewers. \n"}, {"text": "Now, Kyle shall demonstrate the Green Box.\nWhen one refers to a product as being 'green' (such as a box), what does it normally mean?", "correct": "It's a recyclable product; it doesn't harm the environment", "options": ["The product was made as a result of lumber trade", "It's made with materials that were originally green", "Under certain light, the product will turn an unhealthy shade of green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's a recyclable product; it doesn't harm the environment.\n\n\tIf, for example, a box is referred to as 'green', it may mean many things.  While the term 'being green' may be quite vague in terms of purchased goods, many consumers in modern times go out of their way to purchase them because they're more eco-friendly and place less stress on the environment.  This could mean that the product is made of completely recycled material, in which case in can be broken down after use to be remade into a new product, or it could mean that the product was made of materials which won't biodegrade for hundreds of years, placing damages after use. A number of companies pride themselves on going green as it appeals to more environmentally-conscious crowds. As such, many green products may also be more expensive (like purchasing organic foods as opposed to synthetic). \n"}, {"text": "Now, Kyle will take you on a refresher of the Black Box.\nIn which type of vehicle will a black box typically be found?", "correct": "Airplane", "options": ["Car", "Bus", "Boat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAirplane.\n\n\tThe Black Box of an airplane is also known as the Flight Recorder which is placed into the plane to record flight data and cockpit noise in the case that anything happens to go wrong during flight (ie. a crash).  Such a piece of equipment is made with near indestructible materials that are high-heat resistant/pressure resistant.  Contrary to popular belief, the Black Box of an airplane is usually not black; it's yellow or orange to ensure its discovery should the plane go down.  The Black Box is usually in the rear of the plane. \n"}, {"text": "It sure sounds much more delicious when Kyle brings out the Chocolate box.\nWhat line follows \"Life is like a box of chocolates\"?", "correct": "\"You never know what you're gonna get.\"", "options": ["\"I sure do enjoy chocolates.\"", "\"I'm allergic.\"", "\"Would you like a bite?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"You never know what you're gonna get.\"\n\n\tWinning 'Best Picture', 'Best Actor', 'Best Director', and three other Academy Awards in 1995, \"Forrest Gump\" was a critically acclaimed film, later appearing consistently on the IMDB Top 250.  Directed by Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks, the film revolves around a man, Forrest, who has a low IQ, but seems to have been instrumental in many of the events in the United States over the latter half of the twentieth century. The film gave Tom Hanks his second Academy Award win (the first being for \"Philadelphia\" the previous year.  Hanks was also nominated for 'Best Actor' in \"Big\", \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"Cast Away\". \n"}, {"text": "Maybe Kyle should tell you all about the Mahogany Box.\nIs it safe to make coffins out of mahogany?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tMahogany, along with many other types of wood, have been used for coffins and caskets for centuries.  Nowadays, of course, the coffin industry relies on more aesthetically-pleasing coffins for the recently deceased, but nonetheless, coffins made of various woods, metals, and other materials are still for sale (though they're quite expensive...then again, I guess you only need one, right?).  Again, the growing concern for eco-friendly products persists, and you can also purchase coffins made of materials that are also safe for the environment.\rMahogany boxes may not be your best bet anyway.  Any sealed boxes will speed up putrification of the body...ironically, you need more airflow when you're dead. \n"}, {"text": "Maybe there's no box at all!\nWhat type of performer is synonymous with the 'trapped in an invisible box' trick?", "correct": "Mime", "options": ["Puppeteer", "Ventriloquist", "Ballet Dancer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMime.\n\n\tThe Mime is perhaps one of the most frightening creations ever conceived.  Conceived centuries ago, the art of 'miming' was perfected by French street performers over the years.  The 'Trapped in a Glass Box' technique typically involves a mime placing their hands in front and to the sides to mimic flat surfaces in all directions closing them in.  The hip hop dance style known as 'popping' pulls some of its influences from mime due to the actions and moves made which require specific angular movements and theatrical expression. Silent film actors typically used mime to portray certain characters before the use of sound was brought to film in the late 20s. \n"}, {"text": "What's that?  Another Blue Box?\nA Blue Box is another term for a Police Box in the UK.  What British TV show made use of one of these?", "correct": "Doctor Who", "options": ["Blake's 7", "Red Dwarf", "Firefly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoctor Who.\n\n\tPolice Boxes still appear in certain places in the UK, and in the case of BBC's popular science fiction series, \"Doctor Who\", the Doctor makes use of the TARDIS, a time machine which is in the form of a classic police box. The TARDIS has also appeared since the early days of the show and has since become one of the most well-known elements and plot devices from this show (which has been airing for decades).  Since its inception, the interior of the TARDIS has changed to accommodate for more modern viewers and technologies. The Doctor explains that the machine is broken, and as such it always remains in the form of the police box. \n"}]}
