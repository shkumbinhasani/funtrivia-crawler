{"id": "131355", "name": "\"Winter Holiday\" by Arthur Ransome Quiz  | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Kid Lit Authors L - Z", " Arthur Ransome"], "questions": [{"text": "What are Dick and Dorothea doing in the old barn up on the fellside before they start \"signalling to Mars\"?", "correct": "They are looking at the stars.", "options": ["They are building a hut.", "They are helping to get a sledge ready.", "They are getting turnips from a special store."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are looking at the stars.\n\n\tDick has got a book about astronomy and he is trying to find all the major stars that can be seen from the northern hemisphere in the winter months. Unfortunately the book is also filled with lots of distracting poetry as well as the star charts Dick wants to use. \n"}, {"text": "Where are the Swallows (John,Susan, Titty and Roger) staying on this holiday?", "correct": "Holly Howe Farmhouse", "options": ["Dixon's Farm", "Beckfoot", "A small cottage in Rio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHolly Howe Farmhouse.\n\n\tFor Nancy all the houses have become Eskimo settlements. In winter there can be no sleeping outside even when you are on a polar expedition. Dick begins the signalling by using the lantern and the Swallows down at Holly Howe flash their torches back from the bedroom. Unfortunately Dick doesn't know morse code and can't read their message. \n"}, {"text": "Which two of the eight children end up getting their feet wet in the tarn which hasn't yet frozen over?", "correct": "Nancy and Peggy", "options": ["John and Susan", "Dick and Dorothea", "Titty and Roger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNancy and Peggy.\n\n\tJohn and Susan are far too sensible to get their feet wet in this way and they would make sure that Titty and Roger would keep well back from the edge of the tarn. It is the Amazons, impetuous as ever, who think nothing of trying the ice and falling through. \n"}, {"text": "When the tarn freezes and they finally start skating which of the 8 children proves to be the best?", "correct": "Dick", "options": ["Dorothea", "Nancy", "Peggy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDick.\n\n\tThe Swallows and the Amazons are stunned to see Dick take to skating as easily as breathing. Nancy and Peggy have skated before during other cold winters in the past but Dick has practised nearly every day at the indoor rink near his home. \n"}, {"text": "What do the Swallows and Amazons call the stone hut with the corrugated iron roof?", "correct": "The Igloo", "options": ["Polar Base Number 1", "The Dog's Dinner", "The Heald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Igloo.\n\n\tOf course when they first see it Dick and Dorothea realise it can only look like a real igloo when it has snow piled on top of it. \n"}, {"text": "Who is in command of the rowing boat when Dick and Dorothea make their first boat journey with the others to Beckfoot?", "correct": "Peggy", "options": ["John", "Nancy", "Susan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeggy.\n\n\tThis is the moment that we first get the suspicion that all is not well with Nancy. Peggy has to take the place of her elder sister and John does not take command because it is a Beckfoot boat. Nancy is at home with a \"jaw-ache\". \n"}, {"text": "Which adult does Mrs. Blackett ask them to hold up on the snowy road?", "correct": "The doctor", "options": ["Mr. Dixon", "Captain Flint/Uncle Jim", "Mr. Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe doctor.\n\n\tThe difference between Peggy and Susan is shown in the way the ambush is arranged. To Peggy it is the opportunity for a dramatic surprise and she wants to leap out of hiding. For Susan it is a situation that might become fraught with danger with a lot of them on a narrow snowy road. \n"}, {"text": "What illness does Nancy develop that means that all the rest of them have to go into quarantine and not go back to school?", "correct": "mumps", "options": ["measles", "chicken pox", "German measles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmumps.\n\n\tSelf-sacrificing Nancy declares that this is the very best thing that could have happened. The other explorers will now be able to use the time and make a proper polar expedition instead of going back to school before the whole lake freezes over. \n"}, {"text": "Who rescues the Cragfast sheep from the high ledge?", "correct": "Dick", "options": ["John", "Roger", "Susan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDick.\n\n\tDicks climbs up, ties a rope round the sheep and lowers it down to Dorothea, Titty and Roger. In gratitude Mr. Dixon makes a small sledge just for Dick and Dorothea. \n"}, {"text": "What is the new name that Nancy gives them for Wild Cat Island as the lake freezes in round it?", "correct": "Spitzbergen", "options": ["Bear Island", "The Orkneys", "Maddon's Rock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpitzbergen.\n\n\tEven the maps in the endpapers of the books make the usual Lake territory look different. Spitzbergen is marked as is the usual Long Island and the new Cache Island. \n"}, {"text": "What was the single word that Nancy had sent with the key that the doctor had taken to the others?", "correct": "Fram", "options": ["Titanic", "Discovery", "Scott"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFram.\n\n\tThe key was the key to the houseboat and the \"Fram\" was the name of the boat used by the explorer Nansen. It got frozen into the polar sea. Even though she is laid up with mumps Nancy is still planning the adventures for the others. \n"}, {"text": "What was the problem of trying to sail the sledge like an ice yacht?", "correct": "It was impossible to tack into the wind or to steer it.", "options": ["The wind was never strong enough to move it.", "The runners of the sledge caused too much friction.", "They didn't have a sail of a suitable size."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was impossible to tack into the wind or to steer it.\n\n\tThe sledge isn't really broad enough in the beam for it to provide much resistance when the wind came from the sides. A wind directly behind would suit a square sail such as the one that was fitted to the sledge Dick and Dorothea used. \n"}, {"text": "Why can't they read the semaphore message that Nancy sends in her picture when they first try to do so?", "correct": "She's deliberately put it backwards.", "options": ["She has made a mistake in the semaphore code.", "The picture gets wet and obscures some of the figures.", "Only Dick knows the semaphore code."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe's deliberately put it backwards.\n\n\tThey all know the semaphore code and Dick is the first one to realise that the waving figures are meant to represent letters in different words. However, it takes a while for them to understand that the sentence has been reversed. A signpost in the picture in fact shows the right way to read it. Even then they misunderstand Nancy's meaning. \n"}, {"text": "Who do Peggy, John, Susan, Titty and Roger find on board the houseboat the morning after the night the \"D\"s were meant to sleep there?", "correct": "Captain Flint", "options": ["Nancy", "Mr. Dixon", "Mr. Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Flint.\n\n\tNancy and Peggy's Uncle Jim (Captain Flint) had come home early from his continental holiday because he had heard the lake was frozen. He found Dick and Dorothea on board his houseboat and took them back to Dixon's farm. The following day he pretended to Peggy and the others that he had hanged the trespassers. \n"}, {"text": "Why do Dick and Dorothea set off for the North Pole before everyone else?", "correct": "Dick sees a flag at Beckfoot which is the sign to start.", "options": ["Roger gives them the wrong information.", "They want to go there all by themselves.", "They have further to go than the others."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDick sees a flag at Beckfoot which is the sign to start.\n\n\tIt's really all Nancy's fault. She had forgotten that a flag at Beckfoot meant to start for the pole. Thus Dick and Dorothea set off in good faith and are the first to arrive there in the blizzard. \n"}]}
