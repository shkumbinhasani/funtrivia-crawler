Form a layer of bread in a dish and soak with wine and the salted blood of the swan.  Season with pepper, salt and cloves, add the chopped giblets and sauce and serve with the roasted bird. \n"}, {"text": "In medieval England this pot meal was prepared using chicken, rice, ground almonds and red aniseed comfits.  Today, a dish of the same name is more familiar to diners as a sweet dessert, namely what?", "correct": "Blancmange", "options": ["Posset", "Sticky Toffee Pudding", "Rice Pudding"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlancmange.\n\n\tA far cry from what we refer to as blancmange today, in the 14th and 15th centuries 'blank maunger' was a hearty savoury pot dish with a hint of aniseed to add a little sweetness and depth of flavour.  The dish was fashionable and highly favoured during this period as it was said to symbolise purity.  \r Comfits are small confections more familiar to us today in the form of liquorice torpedoes.  For many centuries these small candies were made using dried fruits, nuts and other spices, aniseed being particularly popular, although they were also prepared using coriander and caraway seeds.  Confections known as kissing comfits appeared during the 16th and 17th centuries and were used as breath fresheners using ingredients such as musk and ambergris as flavourings. \n"}, {"text": "Despite its name, outside of religious holidays the dish Herbolace was prepared using onions, herbs, whole egg and which minced meat?", "correct": "Pork", "options": ["Venison", "Guinea Fowl", "Mutton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPork.\n\n\t\"Take Oynouns and erbes and hewe hem small and do \u00fees to gode broth and aray it as \u00feou didest caboches. If \u00feey be in fyssh day make on the same maner with water and oyle and if it be not in Lent alye it with zolkes of Eyren and dresse it forth and cast \u00feer to powdour douce\".\r Also known as Herbelade, the ingredients for this dish varied as to whether it was being prepared during the week or on a Friday or religious holiday especially during Lent when both meat and fish were substituted with 'zolkes of eyren' or egg yolks but in the main Herbolace was made using minced pork.  \r In the recipe you may have also noticed the term 'caboches' which was the medieval English word used to describe cabbage leaves, implying that Herbolace was a form of stuffed leaf of the type that would be encountered today in the dish known as dolmades. \n"}, {"text": "Loseyns was a dish of meat, broth, pasta and various cheeses.  It is generally considered to be the medieval English version of the popular modern dish, Lasagne?", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\t\"Take gode broth and do in an erthen pot, take flour of payndemayn and make \u00feerof past with water.

And lay \u00feeron loseyns isode as hoole as \u00feou mizt and above powdour and chese, and so twyse or thryse, and serue it forth.\"\r There is no disputing the fact that Loseyns as a dish bears a great resemblance to Lasagne, although this dish is not as recent a development as we think; similar dishes are known to have existed as far back as the time of the Roman Empire in the 1st Century CE.  Similarly, it is also believed that the name of this dish stems from the earlier Lossenges which was made with distinctly shaped pasta sheets. \n"}, {"text": "In the name of the vegetable dish Drawen Beans, to what characteristic of this dish does the old English word 'drawen' refer?", "correct": "Consistency", "options": ["Colour", "Dressing", "Flamb\u00e9ed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConsistency.\n\n\t\"Take benes and see\u00fe hem and grynde hem in a morter and drawe hem up with gode broth an do Oynouns in the broth grete mynced an do \u00feerto and colour it with Safroun and serue it forth.\"\r In old English the term 'drawen' was believed to have referred to its very thick consistency.  The recipe itself requires the chef to grind soaked beans add them to stock which is then thickened using roughly chopped onions and finally coloured and flavoured with saffron. \n"}, {"text": "\"Take Chiryes at the Fest of Seynt John the Baptist and do away the stonys grind them in a morter\"... From which ingredient of the dish Chireseye does this recipe from 'Forme of Cury' instruct the chef to remove the stones?", "correct": "Cherries", "options": ["Apricots", "Plums", "Peaches"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCherries.\n\n\tThis pudding or sweet dessert known as Chireseye was a cold puree of cherries blended with wine, butter and sugar which was thickened with breadcrumbs.  A modern version of this dish is known as Ripe Tart which takes its name from the village of Ripe in the southern county of Sussex.  Ripe Tart is very similar in appearance to the modern Bakewell Tart, the stoned cherries enveloped and baked in a batter made from sugar, egg and ground almonds.  Chireseye was usually served decorated with edible flowers; in the case of the 'Forme of Cury' recipe these being clove gilly-flowers.  It is certain that back in the fourteenth century, an ingredient as exotic and expensive as clove gilly-flowers would have been imported from the Near East, with the most likely source being Turkey.\r The recipe continues:  \"Feyr gres or boter and bred of wastrel ymyid and of sugur a good party and a portion of wine and wan it is well ysodyn and ydressyd in dyschis, stik therein clowis of Gilofr and strew ther'on sugur.\" \n"}, {"text": "Spinee, or Spynee, was a thickened, creamy dish of almond milk and breadcrumbs flavoured with the flowers of which common shrub native to the British Isles?", "correct": "Hawthorn", "options": ["Honeysuckle", "Dog Rose", "Elderflower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawthorn.\n\n\tThis simple but very flavoursome dessert is a combination of almond milk, breadcrumbs, honey and sugar.  The hawthorn flowers with which this dish was decorated on serving were usually arranged in such a way as to resemble a rose flower and have been described as having a very subtle apple-like flavour... I have prepared this dish in accordance with this recipe and it tastes delicious!  \r \"Take and make good thick Almond milk as tofore, and do therein of flour of hawthorn and make it as a rose and serue it forth.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Take blaunchid Almaundys, kerf hem long, smal, scharpe.

Which common mammal, native to the British Isles, did the yrchin resemble once prepared?", "correct": "Hedgehog", "options": ["Field Mouse", "Weasel", "Bat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHedgehog.\n\n\tCareful scrutiny of the method and the positioning of the almonds may have provided a clue to the answer to this question.  The description of the prepared almonds, cut long and sharp resemble the spines found on the Hedgehog, everybody's favourite garden visitor.  \r \"Take groundyn Porke, and knede it with Spicerye, with pouder Gyngere, Salt and Sugre; \u00feen sewe hem with a fayre \u00ferede, and putte hem in a Spete as men don piggys; take blaunchid Almaundys, kerf hem long, smal, scharpe.

As with Herbolace, the filling would have been dependent on the day of the week or on the religious calendar.\r Recipes for a 'fleshe day' required the chef to \"take there meat of Pork and carve it all to pieces and hens therewith and do it in a pan and fry it and make a coffin as to a pie small and do therein.  Do thereupon yolks of eggs, hard, powder of ginger and salt, cover it and fry it in grease. Otherwise bake it well and serve it forth.\"\r On those 'fysshe days' the method was very similar; the greater part of the filling consisted of Turbot, Haddock, Codling or Hake flavoured with dates, raisins, pepper and salt. On occasion these little fish pies might also be stewed or baked in a mixture of wine, sugar and ginger before being served. \n"}]}
