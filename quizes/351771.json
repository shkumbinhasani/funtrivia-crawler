John Ratzenberger voiced Hamm, the piggy bank, in all three of the films. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps Craig T. Nelson has something to say about the matter.

Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr was voiced by Craig T. Nelson. \n"}, {"text": "Maybe Kevin Spacey would like to fess up as appearing in all of the Pixar films.\n\nOf course, he denies the claim.

Sully was voiced by John Goodman. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps Ellen Degeneres would like to admit she found her way into minor roles in every Pixar film?

For every person who saw the film, who didn't love Dory?  Her forgetful antics were truly entertaining; as she forgot where she was going, who she was with, and why she was there.  What excitement we had when she could remember \"P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney\".  The wonderful Dory was voiced by Ellen Degeneres. \n"}, {"text": "Maybe Peter O'Toole was in every Pixar film listed in the quiz.  But, just like the rest of them, he claims he was not in but one film.\n\nHe voices which character from \"Ratatouille\"?", "correct": "Anton Ego", "options": ["Linguini", "Remy", "Mustafa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnton Ego.\n\n\t\"Ratatouille\" was released in 2007, and stars a rat who wants to become a chef.

Anton Ego is a harsh food critic who tastes Remy's ratatouille.  He was voiced by Peter O'Toole. \n"}, {"text": "We'll ask Bob Peterson if he is in every film created by Pixar.

She had died, so he felt he needed to move there out of respect for her.  Dug is a dog that this old man (named Carl, by the way) meets along the journey.  Those who saw the movie fell in love with this dog, who could talk because of a collar his master made... squirrel... for him (sorry, cheesy \"Up\" reference there).  Dug was voiced by Bob Peterson. \n"}, {"text": "We have our nine suspects.  Each claims not to be in every single Pixar film created from 1995-2012, but one of them is lying.  In fact, one of these actors/actresses is considered Pixar's \"good luck charm\", and is used in every single film during this period.\n\nWho is our culprit that has infiltrated Pixar?", "correct": "John Ratzenberger & Ratzenberger", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Ratzenberger & Ratzenberger.\n\n\tAha, it was John Ratzenberger who found his way into every film.  Pixar has used his voice for many characters in their films, some fairly major, but most very minor (so minor that you might miss it if you aren't paying attention).\r He plays the following characters from Pixar films:\r Hamm - \"Toy Story\" 1, 2, and 3\rP. T. Flea - \"A Bug's Life\"\rAbominable Snowman - \"Monsters, Inc.\"\rSchool of fish - \"Finding Nemo\"\rThe Underminer - \"The Incredibles\"\rMack - \"Cars\" and \"Cars 2\"\rMustafa the waiter - \"Ratatouille\"\rJohn - \"WALL-E\"\rTom the foreman - \"Up\"\rGordon the guard - \"Brave\" \n"}]}
