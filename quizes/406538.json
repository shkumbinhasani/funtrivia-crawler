(Corny joke over). \r Here is the list:\rAdam - man\rSeth - appointed \rEnosh - mortal\rKenan - sorrow\rMahalalel - the blessed God\rJared - shall come down\rEnoch - teaching\rMethuselah - his death shall bring\rLamech - the despairing \rNoah - rest, comfort\r When I look at these names as a Bible-believing Christian I see the following message when words are added: Man (is) appointed mortal sorrow. (But) The blessed God shall come down teaching (that) his death shall bring the despairing rest and comfort.  (This is a Christian view of a message found in these names. Of course not everyone may believe it as perhaps throughout the years the meanings could have changed). \n"}]}
