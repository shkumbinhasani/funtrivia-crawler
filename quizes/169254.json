Of course he finds much more on the way. \n"}, {"text": "In terms of stardom and notoriety, there is no doubt that Brad Pitt's big coming out party was in his role as what character in the 1991 film 'Thelma & Louise'?", "correct": "J.D.", "options": ["B.J.", "T.R.", "A.C."], "explanation": "\n\n\nJ.D.\n\n\tBrad's portrayal of the young, cowboyish love interest of the Geena Davis character, Thelma, officially established him as a Hollywood star.  J.D. steals Thelma's life savings after a sexy encounter between the characters.  Some fans argue that Brad Pitt stole the film with his relatively bit performance. \n"}, {"text": "For which of these films did Brad Pitt portray the title role of a childish, pompadour-wearing, Ricky Nelson-worshipping musician?", "correct": "Johnny Suede", "options": ["Johnny Mnemonic", "Johnny Handsome", "Johnny Guitar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Suede.\n\n\tThis 1991 Pitt vehicle, which also featured an appearance by Samuel Jackson, was not Brad Pitt's best work.  But, fortunately for Pitt, it was released in the same year as 'Thelma & Louise' and hence largely went forgotten. \n"}, {"text": "Brad Pitt starred as one of the Maclean brothers in the 1992 film 'A River Runs Through It'.  Who directed this rare film about fishing?", "correct": "Robert Redford", "options": ["David Anspaugh", "Martin Brest", "Ron Shelton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Redford.\n\n\tBased on an autobiographical story by Norman Maclean, this beautiful film also featured Craig Sheffer (as Norman Maclean) and Tom Skerritt as Reverend Maclean, the father of the Maclean boys.  Brad's character was named Paul Maclean. \n"}, {"text": "In 1993 Brad Pitt put on another scene-stealing performance as Floyd in the film 'True Romance'.  Who did not appear in this film, alongside Brad?", "correct": "Harvey Keitel", "options": ["Gary Oldman", "Christopher Walken", "Christian Slater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarvey Keitel.\n\n\tIt would be impossible to suggest that Pitt 'stole the show' in this film, simply because there were so many excellent performances.  Gary Oldman's performance as Drexl Spivey, Walken's turn as Vincenzo Coccotti and Slater's portrayal of the lead character, Clarence Worley, were also quite memorable.  The film also featured good performances by Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Samuel Jackson, Bronson Pinchot, Michael Rapaport, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore...wow! \n"}, {"text": "Does Brad Pitt play the role of the Vampire Lestat in the 1994 film 'Interview with the Vampire'?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tBrad Pitt portrays Louis de Pointe du Lac, the main character of the cult-classic novel written by Anne Rice.  Lestat is portrayed interestingly by Tom Cruise.  Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater also play key roles in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Brad Pitt is featured as Detective David Mills in the 1995 thriller 'Se7en', directed by David Fincher.  Has Brad Pitt appeared in any other Fincher-directed film?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed, he has.  Fincher also directed the 1999 film 'Fight Club', featuring Pitt alongside his alter-ego, played by Ed Norton.  In 'Se7en', Pitt is cast alongside the excellent actors Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Brad Pitt films was based on a true story?", "correct": "Seven Years in Tibet", "options": ["Meet Joe Black", "Legends of the Fall", "Twelve Monkeys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven Years in Tibet.\n\n\tThe film 'Seven Years in Tibet' was based on the autobiographical book written by Austrian mountain climber Heinrich Harrer, a man who befriended the Dalai Lama during the 1940s.  The movie is beautifully directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, but it doesn't quite stand up against the Martin Scorcese-directed 'Kundun', which I preferred. \n"}, {"text": "Which Brad Pitt film features the legendary acting talents of both Robert de Niro and Dustin Hoffman?", "correct": "Sleepers", "options": ["The Dark Side of the Sun", "Spy Game", "Ocean's Eleven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSleepers.\n\n\tBrad Pitt joins an all-star cast with his portrayal of the adult Michael Sullivan, one of four men who, as a boy, was abused terribly in a boys detention center.  Though the film never made it to 'blockbuster' status, I think it's quite a good film and worth the watch...especially for the performance of Kevin Bacon. \n"}, {"text": "One of Brad's most entertaining roles was in the 2000 Guy Ritchie film 'Snatch.'.  What sort of person did Pitt portray in this film?", "correct": "A boxing gypsy", "options": ["An American drug-runner", "A Russian gangster", "A London hoodlum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA boxing gypsy.\n\n\tBrad Pitt's 'gypsy' accent is almost indecipherable in this film, which is perfectly acceptable so far as I am concerned.  The key was not to understand what Brad's character (Mickey O'Neil) says, but rather to observe the manner in which he delivers his lines.  Supposedly, Guy Ritchie created this character specifically to annoy those who complained about the difficulty in understanding the speech of his films' characters.  Let that be a lesson to you!  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other stuff. \n"}]}
