{"id": "131586", "name": "'The Matrix', Part 3: Before We Reload... Online Trivia | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies L-P", " The Matrix"], "questions": [{"text": "Just prior to meeting with the Oracle, we see Morpheus' crew eating in the mess hall of the Nebuchadnezzer.  According to Dozer the food they consume is 'a single-celled protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins and minerals.'  According to Mouse, this food reminds him of which breakfast treat?  ", "correct": "Tastee wheat", "options": ["Cream-o-wheat", "Wheat germ", "Wheaties"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTastee wheat.\n\n\tThe crew is rather cruel to Neo during this scene, Mouse claiming that the goop they eat is like 'runny eggs' and Apoc suggesting it has the consistency of 'a bowl of snot'.  Mouse also suggests that it reminds him of 'Tastee Wheat'.  Switch points out that Mouse has technically never tried Tastee Wheat, which elicits further philosophic discussion from Mouse.  I sure hope that I, technically or otherwise, never have to try Tastee Wheat after having seen this film... \n"}, {"text": "Neo's first return to the Matrix occurs at this juncture in the film.  On the way to visiting the Oracle, Neo gazes wistfully at his former home, realizing that many formerly familiar sights and smells are now only fleeting impressions of his once enslaved mind.  At one point during the drive, he longingly recalls which food item?  ", "correct": "Noodles", "options": ["Lasagna", "Pot stickers", "Spaghetti"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNoodles.\n\n\tNeo spots a restaurant that he remembered had 'really good noodles'.  He realizes with a pained expression, however, that digital noodles have no flavor.  The ever optimistic Trinity interprets the situation in a different way...'The Matrix cannot tell you who you are.'  Nor can it tell you which noodles to enjoy... \n"}, {"text": "Before meeting with the Oracle, Neo is ushered into a room full of children doing extraordinary things.  The woman who escorts Neo in to see the children refers to these youths by what collective term? ", "correct": "Potentials", "options": ["Savants", "Enlightened", "Illuminati"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPotentials.\n\n\tSeveral of the 'Potentials' are featured doing extraordinary things such as levitating blocks, bending spoons with their mind and reading Chinese literature (maybe the most difficult thing of all!)  The 'spoon boy', as I shall call him, is the only one who talks with Neo.  In a very Buddhist sense, he informs Neo that 'there is no spoon.' \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps to Neo's surprise, the Oracle appears simply as a kindly old lady.  Kindly though she may be, she has wisdom to impart, and does so for Neo's benefit.  At one point, she prompts Neo to look at a wooden plaque positioned above her kitchen door frame.  What phrase appears on this plaque?  ", "correct": "Temet Nosce", "options": ["Ecce Homo", "Carpe Diem", "Caveat Emptor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTemet Nosce.\n\n\t'Temet nosce' is a Latin phrase meaning 'know thyself'.  This is a direct reference to the ancient Greek Oracle at Delphi, where the phrase 'gnothe seauton' could be found inscribed.  ('Gnothe seauton' is the phrase in its original Greek; perhaps it would have been a more correct rendering to have used the Greek rather than the Latin...but who's counting?) \n"}, {"text": "Aside from leaving the Oracle's abode with increased awareness of his self and his mission, what item does Neo also take with him?  \n", "correct": "Cookie", "options": ["Vase", "Spoon", "Plaque"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCookie.\n\n\tNeo bends the spoon, breaks the vase and reads the plaque...but all remain in the Oracle's possession.  He does leave with a delicious cookie, which is of the oatmeal variety (yuck...give me chocolate-chip!) \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  The Oracle specifically tells Neo that he is not 'the One'.  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAs a matter of fact, the Oracle says nothing of the sort, and certainly not in direct terms.  Rather, I like to think that she did tell him he was 'the One', but in a convoluted manner.  It is Neo who says, 'I'm not the one,' to which the Oracle responds, 'Sorry kid, you got the gift...but it looks like you're waiting for something.'  She then refers to his 'next life'.  The fact that she announces that he's 'got the gift' and that he's 'waiting for his next life' suggests that, in fact, he is the One but that he does not yet know himself (referring back to the Oracle's motto.)  Hence, it seems that the One cannot be told directly that he is a messiah, he must discover it for himself. Naturally, Neo does just this later in the film! \n"}, {"text": "Returning to the strange mansion from whence they first entered the Matrix, Neo, Morpheus and friends soon discover that they are in grave danger.  The first clue to their danger is a 'deja vu' Neo has, involving which creature?  ", "correct": "Cat", "options": ["Rat", "Dog", "Wombat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCat.\n\n\tOkay, so wombat was an improbable choice...but they did film in Australia.  According to Trinity, the phenomenon we refer to as 'deja vu' is in fact a 'glitch in the Matrix'.  Glitches only occur when 'they change something', the 'they' meaning the Agents, I would suspect. \n"}, {"text": "Soon our friends find themselves under siege, as the Agents and their subservient shock troops ambush Morpheus and crew in the mansion.  Which of the crew is the first to die?  \n", "correct": "Mouse", "options": ["Dozer", "Apoc", "Switch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMouse.\n\n\tMouse is the first, and only, member of the crew to die in the mansion itself.  Despite being equipped with two machine guns, Mouse is mowed down by a bevy of fire from several machine-gun toting policemen.  I might add that Mouse is a terrible shot... \n"}, {"text": "True or false: Neo's 'death' and 'rebirth' aside, the agents (Smith, Jones and Brown) fail to have a direct hand in the deaths of any of the crew members during the film.\n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAs a matter of fact, the Agents are terribly ineffective killing machines, not managing to kill a single crew member.  It must be mentioned though that Agent Smith nearly does Neo in at the end of the movie, but Neo managed to cheat death...after all, he is the One.  Five of the crew members do die during the film.  Mouse, as noted above, is killed by the police.  Apoc, Switch and Dozer are all done in by Cypher, and Tank returns the favor by killing off Cypher.  By the end of the film, only Morpheus, Trinity, Tank and Neo remain... \n"}, {"text": "Most of the crew are able to escape the mansion via the walls and the sewer, though several do not make it back to the 'real world'.  Which of the following crew members does not manage to escape the mansion, falling into Agent custody?  ", "correct": "Morpheus", "options": ["Apoc", "Trinity", "Switch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorpheus.\n\n\tI thought I'd provide an easy question to finish this quiz off!  Technically, Cypher leaves the mansion in police custody too, though we all know by now that he is the informant.  Trinity, Neo, Switch and Apoc all escape through the wall and into the sewer, but only the former two return from the Matrix thanks to Cypher's invidious machinations.  Speaking of thanks, thank you for trying this quiz...please give its counterparts a try if you haven't already! \n"}]}
