{"id": "303595", "name": "Seeing Toronto by Subway Quiz | Canada | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Canada", " Ontario"], "questions": [{"text": "Sheppard West!  Sheppard West Station!\n\nIn which region of Toronto can one find Sheppard West, formerly known as Downsview?", "correct": "North York", "options": ["Mississauga", "Vaughan", "Etobicoke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorth York.\n\n\tNorth York is home to York University's Keele Campus and reaches one of the northern-most points of the city.  This location also makes use of York Region's transit system and grants access to the county to the north of Toronto.  Located on Sheppard Avenue, Downsview Station, for many years, was one of the most northerly access points for commuters in the north and northwest portions of the Greater Toronto Area.\rBecause of this terminal's location, people can drive directly east on Sheppard avenue to reach the Sheppard-Yonge Station, one of the more popular stations on the main Yonge-University-Spadina line (because of its connection to the Sheppard Line branching directly to the east).\rLocated outside Sheppard West Station, sightseers can visit Downsview Park, a site which has hosted many different events such as concerts (Edgefest, for example). \n"}, {"text": "Dundas!  Dundas Station!\n\nWhat famous location is no more than a block away from Dundas Station?", "correct": "Eaton's Centre", "options": ["Art Gallery of Ontario", "Toronto City Hall", "York University (Glendon Campus)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEaton's Centre.\n\n\tDespite the fact that Eaton's itself declared bankruptcy in 1999, it was acquired by Sears Canada in the following years and the name 'Eaton's Centre' stuck to the shopping center.  Timothy Eaton himself was probably one of the most prominent faces in North American retail for many decades, particularly during the Second World War.\rDundas Station is located at Yonge and Dundas.  One of the stations at this location lays directly beneath the Eaton's Centre while the other is located at the Atrium on Bay.  Other locations close by include the once prosperous site of Sam the Record Man (now demolished, but kept as a Heritage Site) and a number of halls from Ryerson University. \n"}, {"text": "Museum!  Museum Station!\n\nWhich museum can be found when you go topside at this station?", "correct": "The Royal Ontario Museum", "options": ["The Museum of Canadian Television, Film, and Theatre", "The Canadian Museum of Natural History", "The Modern Museum of Art"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Royal Ontario Museum.\n\n\tHeading southbound from Downsview Station, Museum is the eleventh stop on the western half of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway loop.  This station can be found on the corner of Bloor Street and Avenue Road and it opens up to face the ROM, Canada's most-visited museum.  In 2006, the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal was built as part of the Renaissance ROM expansion project, adding many more exhibits and reshaping the entire building (while keeping many of the older, popular aspects of the museum itself).\rIn addition, the McLaughlin Planetarium can be found adjacent to the ROM building.  Although this structure hasn't been used for its intended purpose for over a decade, it was built in 1968 and contains all the necessary equipment to observe the night skies. \n"}, {"text": "Queen's Park!  Queen's Park Station!\n\nWhich location is commonly found topside at this station?", "correct": "The Hospital for Sick Children", "options": ["Chinatown", "The Bata Shoe Museum", "The Ontario Science Center"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hospital for Sick Children.\n\n\tLocated at College St. and University Avenue, Queen's Park Station is named after Queen's Park, Toronto's Legislative Building, itself.  In addition, many of the buildings surrounding Queen's Park are of the medical nature, and one can find Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, Princess Margaret Hospital, Mount Sinai, and others.\rThis station is located between Museum Station to the north and St. Patrick Station to the south.  It can be found on the Yonge-University-Spadina Line's western half. \n"}, {"text": "Yorkdale!  Yorkdale Station!\n\nWhat can be found at this station?", "correct": "A shopping centre", "options": ["A museum", "Massey Hall", "Casa Loma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA shopping centre.\n\n\tYorkdale Station is directly connected to the Yorkdale Mall, one of the higher-class malls in the Greater Toronto area and home to many flagship locations for clothing manufacturers.  Yorkdale Station on the western half of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line, only two south of Downsview Station.\rBecause of the station's unique design and architecture, it's classified as one of Toronto's Heritage Buildings.\rSince its opening in 1964, the Yorkdale Shopping Centre has become one of Toronto's largest and the most profitable in all of Canada.  Typically, Yorkdale is given many shopping outlets that appear for the first time in Canada (eg. Yorkdale featured the first Apple Store). \n"}, {"text": "Kipling!  Kipling Station!\n\nIn which compass direction of the subway system is this station?", "correct": "West", "options": ["East", "North", "South"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWest.\n\n\tKipling Station is the terminus station of the Bloor-Danforth's western end.  This station, much like the other terminus stations on the TTC lines is mainly for commuter use.  Additionally, Kipling is mainly used by travelers and tourists due to its proximity to Pearson International Airport.  Mississauga, one of Canada's largest municipalities, is at the end of this part of the line and this station typically acts at a gateway for many GTA residents to the downtown core.  Riders on this half of the Bloor-Danforth line can transfer onto the Yonge-University-Spadina line at St. George Station.\rOn the contrary, the eastern terminus of the Bloor-Danforth line is Kennedy Station, but this in turn connects to the Scarborough Rapid Transit line.  Though technically part of the subway system, this transit operates separately from Kennedy Station to McCowan Station. \n"}, {"text": "Eglinton!  Eglinton Station!\n\nHow many stations are situated on Eglinton Avenue?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["One", "Four", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tTwo of these stations, Eglinton and Eglinton West, are on the Yonge-University-Spadina line.  Eglinton on the eastern half of the loop is close to the TVO building and the Canada Square Center while Eglinton West (and St. Clair West Station just down the track) is close to Casa Loma.  A third, Kennedy Station, is the furthest east of all the subway stations on the TTC system.\rAside from Eglinton and St. Clair, Lawrence Station also has a western counterpart.  All of the western stations at this point on the loop tend to be more for residential citizens and commuters as opposed to tourist spots.  While each has specific architecture and art installations to set their station apart from the rest, there may be few attractions.  On the contrary, the stations situated on Yonge Street (south of Finch Station) tend to be more commercialized and feature streetside shops and boutiques.  Until one hits Spadina Station on the western side, there are few attractions excluding Yorkdale Station. \n"}, {"text": "King!  King Station!\n\nFrom here you can reach Commerce Court.  Which bank is associated with this location?", "correct": "CIBC", "options": ["Bank of Montreal", "Royal Bank", "Toronto Dominion Bank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCIBC.\n\n\tKing Station is on the lower portion of the Yonge-University-Spadina line at the intersection of King and Yonge.  Because this station is located directly in the downtown core (like Queen, Osgoode, and St. Andrew Station), its proximity to the major Canadian bank buildings is clear.  Commerce Court specifically refers to the location at which one can find the CIBC building though many other towers (for Royal Bank, TD, Scotia, etc.) can be found in the near vicinity.  In addition, the station is connected to the underground PATH shopping centre which runs under most of Downtown Toronto.  King Station is on the eastern half of the major line.\rKing's opposing station, St. Andrews, is on University Avenue.  This location is relatively close to Roy Thomson Hall (home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and concert hall), the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the Princess of Wales Theatre. \n"}, {"text": "You may notice that the intercom isn't announcing our current station.  Which of these stations is not found on the TTC subway route?", "correct": "Lower Bay", "options": ["Wellesley", "Glencairn", "Bessarion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLower Bay.\n\n\tLower Bay Station once existed on the TTC route map, but due to complications that arose from its positioning and initial use, the station was closed down.  Originally, the station was created under the fully-operational Bay Station (connecting St. George and Bloor-Yonge Station on both the Yonge-University-Spadina and Bloor-Danforth Lines, both North-South and East-West), but due to the fact that turning the subway train to a different direction would prove impractical, it was shut down.  Since then, however, the station has been used for movie sets and can be transformed to look like any subway station around the globe.  It's probably for the best anyways.  After the closing of Lower Bay Station, the Yonge-University-Spadina line extended north past St. George Station to Downsview over the coming decades.\rA Lower Queen Station was also planned, but the idea was scrapped for feasibility purposes. \n"}, {"text": "Union!  Union Station!\n\nUnion Station is the southern-most station on the Yonge-University-Spadina line.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tUnion Station, quite possibly the most popular station on the subway/transit line in Toronto, is the southernmost station in the city.  Located in Downtown Toronto, the building rests at Front Street in the heart of the downtown core.  Its structure is directly connected to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (and eventually, you'll come across the CN Tower) and it's also the lowest station on the extensive Yonge-University-Spadina line.  At this station, all trains will turn northbound, heading towards either Downsview Station to the west or Finch Station to the east.\rUnion Station is also the hub for many other transportation means to get citizens across Canada.  ViaRail can take patrons to Pacific Central Station in Vancouver or Halifax Railway Station via Montreal.  In addition, trains can take customers across the border to New York.\rThe station opened in 1927.  It has since become Canada's busiest station. \n"}]}
