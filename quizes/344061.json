{"id": "344061", "name": "All Signs Point to \"Skyward Sword\" Online Trivia  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games T-Z", "Zelda Games"], "questions": [{"text": "After the third dungeon of \"Skyward Sword\", Zelda gives Link the Goddess Harp.  In which other game does Link play the harp?", "correct": "Oracle of Ages", "options": ["Ocarina of Time", "The Minish Cap", "Spirit Tracks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOracle of Ages.\n\n\tA major part of the GBC game \"Oracle of Ages\" is Link's ability to travel back and forth between two different time periods in the world of Labrynna, each hundreds of years apart.  To do this, Link needed to use Nayru's Harp of Ages, an item which could learn three different songs, each one giving Link easier ways to access the different time periods.  With the first song, Link can only travel on special pads around the world.\r In \"Skyward Sword\", the Goddess' Harp is used to find secrets and hidden stones/items as well as access gateways to the Silent Realm.  Link learns a number of songs on it from the Isle of Songs.  It's played by holding the A button and strumming in the air.\r Coincidentally, the harp is given to Link by Zelda, who throws it to him before she is taken away.  In \"Ocarina of Time\", Link receives the Ocarina of Time under similar circumstances; Zelda is fleeing Hyrule Castle and she tosses it into the moat for Link to retrieve. \n"}, {"text": "When visiting the Lanayru Sand Sea, Link must operate a boat owned by a robot skipper.  In which of these other games is controlling and traveling by boat a major aspect of gameplay?", "correct": "Wind Waker", "options": ["Majora's Mask", "Phantom Hourglass", "Twilight Princess"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWind Waker.\n\n\tIn \"Wind Waker\", Link must travel across the expanses of the Great Sea in a boat known as the King of Red Lions.  This, for some, was a tedious task; many ages of coasting with the winds can take a lot of time but visiting all of the islands and collecting all of the treasure in the game is rewarding in itself!  Until Link obtains the proper baton techniques to fly from island to island, he'll be sailing away his days.\r In the Lanayru Sand Sea of \"Skyward Sword\", a literal ocean of sand, Link must use a Timeshift Stone to transfer the boat back in time.  Doing so will create a circle of water around the boat which can be floated on.  No sails are required. \n"}, {"text": "The Sand Ship, the fifth dungeon of the game, is home to Stalfos and Bokoblins.  In the Shadow Temple of another \"Legend of Zelda\" game, Link needed to board a ship to fight Stalfos as well.  Which game was it?", "correct": "Ocarina of Time", "options": ["A Link to the Past", "Minish Cap", "Oracle of Seasons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOcarina of Time.\n\n\tIn \"Ocarina of Time\", depending on your approach to the dungeons, the Shadow Temple was either the fourth or fifth temple Link could visit as an adult.  This temple, full of hidden floors and walls only detectable by the Lens of Truth, Wallmasters and Floormasters (still the creepiest anythings ever), and the buggest justification for Hover Boots, included one sequence on a large wooden boat hurtling down a shadowy river.  If Link could defeat the Stalfos onboard, the ship would dock further downstream and be used as a bridge between the final area of the dungeon and the boss room containing Bongo Bongo.\r There may be fewer Stalfos in \"Skyward Sword\", but Scervo, the mini-boss of the Sand Ship, must be fought in order for Link to obtain his Bow.  Like with the Stalfos of \"Ocarina of Time\" (and later, \"Majora's Mask\") the sword is the best weapon to use in these battles. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these games is bug catching, featured in \"Skyward Sword\", a prominent sidequest?", "correct": "Twilight Princess", "options": ["Link's Awakening (DX)", "Majora's Mask", "Oracle of Seasons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwilight Princess.\n\n\tIn \"Twilight Princess\", bug catching can either be tedious or rewarding.  There are only twenty-four bugs in the entire game and all of them stand out in gold against an otherwise dark, atmospheric backdrop.  But the Hyrule of \"Twilight Princess\" is expansive and the bugs are tricky to reach.  You collect these for Agitha, a girl in Hyrule Castle Town, who gives you larger and larger wallets and rupees as rewards (which is nice).  You don't need a net to catch these bugs.  A net is used, however, to catch bugs in \"A Link to the Past\".\r In \"Twilight Princess\", bug catching is done to upgrade potions in the Skyloft Bazaar.  Although you can simply purchase a potion to put in one of your bottles, upgrading may come in handy later in the game.  Using three types of bugs, your health potion could go from filling eight hearts to filling all of your health (with Health Potion+).  Some bugs are harder to find than others.  Beetle sells you the Bug Catching Net and it can be upgraded in the bazaar.  It's also used to catch birds (for their feathers) and tumbleweeds (which can be frustrating). \n"}, {"text": "In both \"Link's Awakening\" and \"Skyward Sword\", Link uses a Scale to swim.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn \"Link's Awakening\", Link uses the Flippers (found in the Angler's Tunnel) to swim in the fourth and fifth dungeons of the game; he does not receive a Scale in order to swim.  He does, however, use a Scale as the last item in the trading sequence.  Link does, however, use a Silver and Golden Scale in \"Ocarina of Time\".  Both enable Link to swim downwards...at least until he receives the Zora Tunic as an adult.  Both are found around Lake Hylia.  A Zora's Scale is also used in \"Oracle of Ages\".\r In \"Skyward Sword\", Link receives the Water Dragon's Scale after completing the first of four Silent Realm trials (in Faron Woods).  The Scale enables him to swim until he runs out of breath; it plays a major role in the fourth dungeon, the Ancient Cistern. \n"}, {"text": "In which of these games does Link receive a precursor to the Gust Bellows?", "correct": "Minish Cap", "options": ["Link's Awakening (DX)", "A Link to the Past", "Four Sword Adventures"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinish Cap.\n\n\tThe Gust Jar is an early item in \"Minish Cap\" (GBA) found in Deepwood Shrine; Link can use this jar to blow air at enemies, taking their armor off or thrusting them into dangerous obstacles, or he can use it to aid in transportation.\r The Gust Bellows of \"Skyward Sword\" is found in the Lanayru Mining Facility, the third major dungeon of the game.  It can be used to spin pinwheels and switches and to fight off enemies with the same designs (eg. Armos).  Using the Gust Bellows may require a bit of creativity.  In some instances, Link will need it in order to reach far-away platforms or to rotate large towers. \n"}, {"text": "Beedle, the floating shopkeeper, first appeared in which of these games before \"Skyward Sword\"?", "correct": "Wind Waker", "options": ["Adventure of Link", "Ocarina of Time", "Majora's Mask"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWind Waker.\n\n\tIn \"Wind Waker\", Beedle appears on tiny dinghy around a number of different islands in the Great Sea.  Selling items at prices high and low (eg. the Hyoi Pear and All-Purpose Bait), Beedle provides a service unseen on most islands (excluding, perhaps, Windfall Island).  Beetle also flies a hot air balloon in \"Spirit Tracks\".\r In \"Skyward Sword\", Beedle maintains a shop floating above Skyloft which Link can visit if he hits the bell underneath and signals for a rope to lift him up.  Although some of his items can be expensive, some, like Wallet upgrades and Adventure Pouches.  Beedle also maintains a floating island out in the sky which he attends to at night. \n"}, {"text": "In which earlier game does Link receive the Double Clawshots?", "correct": "Twilight Princess", "options": ["Majora's Mask", "Spirit Tracks", "Link's Awakening (DX)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwilight Princess.\n\n\tAlthough Link receives one Clawshot in Lakebed Temple, the third dungeon of the game, he also receives a second in the City in the Sky, the sixth dungeon, enabling him to shoot at successive targets and traverse the far-between platforms far above Hyrule.  The duo of Clawshots count as one item.\r In \"Skyward Sword\", Link receives the Double Clawshots after completing the second Silent Realm Trial (in Lanayru Desert).  These are used to reach the Lanayru Sand Sea and, subsequently, the Sand Ship, the fifth dungeon. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these earlier games did not feature Gorons?", "correct": "A Link to the Past", "options": ["Majora's Mask", "Four Sword Adventures", "Oracle of Seasons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Link to the Past.\n\n\t\"A Link to the Past\" (SNES) would be too early for Gorons; they first appeared in \"Ocarina of Time\" on Death Mountain.  They would continue to appear in games as a fan favourite, usually in burly, rocky roles.  In many games, Gorons are synonymous with bombs, mountains, caves, and rocks.\r In \"Skyward Sword\", Gorons appear very rarely-- a few Gorons are found here and there, mostly intrepid explorer-types informing Link about ancient lore, odd items, and the like.  One Goron in particular assists Link in reaching both the Lanayru Sand Sea and the Lanayru Gorge.  Zoras, another famous species from the series, does not appear in \"Skyward Sword\". \n"}, {"text": "In \"Skyward Sword\", Zelda is guarded by a Sheikah named Impa.  In which earlier game is Impa a sage?", "correct": "Ocarina of Time", "options": ["Wind Waker", "Spirit Tracks", "Phantom Hourglass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOcarina of Time.\n\n\tIn \"Ocarina of Time\", Impa is Princess Zelda's personal bodyguard and she whisks the young girl off on a horse when Ganondorf infiltrates Hyrule Castle.  Seven years later, Impa plays a larger role in Link's quest as the sage of the Shadow Temple; she hands over the Shadow Medallion after Link defeats Bongo Bongo.  Impa also appears in \"Oracle of Seasons\" as Din's guardian.\r In \"Skyward Sword\", Impa looks over Zelda when she falls from the sky, taking her from temple to temple and then back in time at the Temple of Time.  In the end of the game, Link discovers that Impa has been guarding the Sealed Temple for hundreds of years. \n"}]}
