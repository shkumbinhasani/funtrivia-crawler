Celiac is an autoimmune disease based in the small intestine. \n"}, {"text": "What does a person with Celiac need to avoid?", "correct": "gluten", "options": ["meat", "rice", "potatoes"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngluten.\n\n\tGluten is a protein composite found in wheat and other sources. Gluten comes from the Latin word \"gluten\" which means glue. \n"}, {"text": "Celiac is easy to diagnose.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tCeliac is often misdiagnosed in people as lactose intolerance. This is in part because Celiac is not as well known and since lactose products (milk) and gluten (wheat) often go together doctors often thought the person was having trouble digesting the lactose in milk. \r Also, people often test negative for Celiac with the blood test. Many times it is a false negative. They then have to do another test. \n"}, {"text": "What is the test commonly used to test for Celiac other than a blood test?", "correct": "endoscopy", "options": ["x-ray", "colonoscopy", "CT scan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nendoscopy.\n\n\tAn upper endoscopy is the common test given to test for Celiac.

This allows doctors to see what is going on inside, and to know if your small intestine is not doing its job. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following can contain gluten?", "correct": "An item whose ingredients say \"modified corn starch\"", "options": ["An item whose ingredients say \"natural flavors\"", "All of the above", "An item whose ingredients say \"maltodextrin\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn item whose ingredients say \"modified corn starch\".\n\n\tThis is one of the things that makes having a gluten-free diet challenging for people with Celiac. While wheat is easy enough to know that the item is dangerous. These other words mean it could contain gluten but it might not. A person with severe Celiac has to avoid all these items until they know for sure. \n"}, {"text": "Eating at restaurants can also be a challenge for someone with Celiac. What is a major concern when eating at a restaurant?", "correct": "cross-contamination", "options": ["nothing, restaurants are completely safe", "the food won't taste good", "you can only eat the hamburgers"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncross-contamination.\n\n\tCross-contamination is a concern for people with severe Celiac. If for example the cook is making something involving wheat flour and then makes your food, the gluten on their hands can contaminate your food. For some this is not an issue, but for others this cross-contamination is enough to make a person very sick. \n"}, {"text": "Can dating be a potential problem?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tA person with Celiac can actually be made sick if their partner is not gluten free. The reason is that even kissing a person who has had gluten can cause cross-contamination. This can be fixed by having the person brush first if they have eaten anything with gluten. Of course sometimes, during a romantic moment a person may not always think to tell the person \"go brush before you kiss me\" and therefore could run the risk of getting sick. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following candies is gluten free?", "correct": "M&M's", "options": ["Kit Kat", "Twix", "Milky Way"], "explanation": "\n\n\nM&M's.\n\n\tAll varieties of M&M's with exception of the pretzel M&Ms are gluten free. \n"}, {"text": "Which website is used often by people with Celiac?", "correct": "celiac.com", "options": ["gf.com", "wheatbad.com", "lotsofwheat.com"], "explanation": "\n\n\nceliac.com\n\n\tCeliac.com is a popular website for people with Celiac.

Because it is an autoimmune disorder the more gluten a person has with Celiac the worse they become. It is progressive, and therefore it's possible if a person goes too long with eating gluten it could eventually kill them. This is rare as in most cases once a person is diagnosed and starts the gluten free diet they start to improve, although they will still get very sick if they accidentally eat gluten. There are different forms of the illness some include: nausea, diarrhea, pain in the sides, extreme fatigue, and seizures. \n"}]}
