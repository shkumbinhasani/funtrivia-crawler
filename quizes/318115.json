{"id": "318115", "name": "Waiter, There's a Fly in My Soup Quiz | Brain Teasers | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", "Hidden Words", "Hidden Words by Theme"], "questions": [{"text": "Waiter, I'm confused. Lou set the table, Amy took our drink order, John said he'd be right back and now they're all ignoring us. Who do I complain to?", "correct": "louse", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nlouse.\n\n\t\"LOU SEt the table ...\" Lice (the plural of louse) are wingless parasites living off various species of birds and mammals. Young children often pick up head lice at school; parents experienced in such outbreaks know all about the various anti-louse combs and shampoos. \n"}, {"text": "Waiter, I saw aspic on the menu. I thought this place was vegetarian!", "correct": "wasp", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nwasp.\n\n\t\"... I saW ASPic on the menu...\" Aspic is a meat gelatin, into which all sorts of goodies -- like fruits or vegetables -- can be placed. Alternatively, it is sometimes used as a glistening (and shelf-life-extending) glaze. Wasps, meanwhile, are carnivores that often immobilize their insect victims with a sting. They are unlikely to be found dining in a vegetarian establishment. \n"}, {"text": "Waiter, this cocktail is awful! Tell the bartender to pick one flavor: peach or nettle.", "correct": "hornet", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nhornet.\n\n\t\"... peacH OR NETtle.\" The stinging nettle, which grows all over the northern hemisphere, is far more appetizing than its name might suggest, and nettle cordials are sold commercially in the U.K. (Peach liqueurs are more common, of course, and I've never heard of a combination.) Hornets are stinging, social insects not known to have a taste for alcohol. \n"}, {"text": "Waiter, this borscht is terrible -- it's barely pink! It needs more beet, less sour cream, and less garlic.", "correct": "beetle & beetles & bee", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nbeetle & beetles & bee.\n\n\t\"... It needs more BEET, LESs sour cream ...\" Borscht is a beet soup from Eastern Europe, often served with sour cream for a deep pink color and rich flavor. It isn't meant to be made with beetles, which are insects with hard front wings that they fold over their back wings when on the ground. Famous beetles include the scarab (sacred to the ancient Egyptians) and the immense Goliath beetle (weighing in at 100 grams or 3.5 ounces as a larva), but not Ringo -- he's a Beatle. \n"}, {"text": "Waiter, this was supposed to be a hot stew. Even if the thermos quit on you, you cannot serve soup this cold!", "correct": "mosquito", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nmosquito.\n\n\t\"... Even if the therMOS QUIT On you ...\" A thermos is supposed to keep a liquid at its original temperature for quite a while, but food should probably be served promptly if the thermos is broken. Mosquitoes are a worse nuisance, though: the female of the species is quite literally a bloodsucker, and has been known to spread diseases like malaria and the West Nile virus. \n"}, {"text": "Waiter, how long has this honey been out? It's disgusting!", "correct": "honeybee & bee & honey bee", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nhoneybee & bee & honey bee.\n\n\t\"... has this HONEY BEEn out? ...\" Honey is a syrupy sweetener, made by (appropriately enough) the honeybee. Bees feed on the nectar from flowers; back at the hive, they make it into honey. Once harvested, honey is delicious and long-lasting, but is usually served without the honeybee. \n"}, {"text": "Waiter, the squid is supposed to be well-done. Why do I hear wiggling noises from my plate?", "correct": "earwig", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nearwig.\n\n\t\"... Why do I hEAR WIGgling noises ...?\" Curiously, the words \"earwig\" and \"wiggle\" are related: the Old English word \"wicga,\" or \"insect,\" refers to movement. Despite their long, narrow bodies and suggestive name, earwigs do not actually attack people through the ears, although they do go after some food crops (notably ears of corn). \n"}, {"text": "Waiter, if this fruit was locally hand-picked from a wee village farm, why does it have a supermarket decal?", "correct": "weevil", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nweevil.\n\n\t\"... from a WEE VILlage farm ...\" Many upscale restaurants advertise special relationships with local farms, which provide them with fresh, seasonal fare of a higher caliber than what you might find in grocery stores. Weevils -- a type of beetle whose voracious larvae have been blamed for numerous agricultural catastrophes -- are not usually part of the deal. \n"}, {"text": "Waiter, I asked for cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. What is this, a jello custard?", "correct": "locust", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nlocust.\n\n\t\"... a jelLO CUSTard?\" Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is a creamy custard that is seared with a blowtorch before serving, for a crispy crust. Jello is a gelatin pudding, often fruit-flavored, that would not work at all well as part of a custard. The dessert is even less appetizing with locusts, grasshopper-like insects famed for descending in large numbers on crops, and leaving a wasteland. Not for nothing were these ravenous creatures worthy of being a Biblical plague! \n"}, {"text": "Waiter, the bill is wrong! See this term itemizing our drinks? How do two Coca-Colas cost $100?", "correct": "termite & mite", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ntermite & mite.\n\n\t\"...See this TERM ITEmizing our drinks?...\" Termites, very social insects, are particularly famous as pests whose predilection for wood can seriously damage human buildings. Roasted or fried termites are a popular treat in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, but do not typically turn up unannounced on the bill. \n"}]}
