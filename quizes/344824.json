{"id": "344824", "name": "A Shadow's Silhouette Online Quiz | The Unexplained | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  The Unexplained", "Cryptozoology and Monsters"], "questions": [{"text": "The Altamaha-ha is a cryptid that is said to lurk in the Altamaha River in Georgia.  Though it is quite large and is said to have the snout of a crocodile, it is actually believed to be a harmless creature.  ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Altamaha-ha is described as a large sturgeon that swims like a dolphin.  It supposedly has a crocodile-like snout.  Some speculate that the Altamaha-ha is actually an ocean cryptic creature (called cryptid throughout the rest of the quiz) that simply comes to the river to spawn.  That still means there is an unknown creature lurking in the ocean.  Of course, the ocean is vastly unexplored, so the possibilities of ocean cryptids is endless.\r Altamaha-ha \"sightings\" and stories usually involve the creature bumping into people who are swimming in the river.  However, even though the majority of stories involve contact with people and the creature, no \"attacks\" have ever been recorded.  Because of this reason, the Altamaha-ha is viewed as a harmless cryptid. \n"}, {"text": "There is a large serpent cryptid that was given the name Bessie, a play on the ever-famous Nessie.  Bessie is said to reside in one of the Great Lakes, but which one?", "correct": "Lake Erie", "options": ["Lake Michigan", "Lake Huron", "Lake Ontario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLake Erie.\n\n\tLake Erie is said to be the home of Bessie, which is described as a very large snake-like creature at least an entire foot in diameter, and 30 to 60 feet in length.  Many sightings have been reported, interestingly three of which all occurred in 1817, and several more in the 1890s.\r Like many other marine cryptids, descriptions of the beast do vary.  Some claim they saw arms on it, some say the head was dog shaped, and still others claim there are fins.  Others believe it to appear simply as a giant snake. \n"}, {"text": "A very famous photograph of a certain lake monster is known as the Mansi Photograph.  In which lake does the \"monster\" in the photograph supposedly lurk?", "correct": "Lake Champlain", "options": ["Lake Tahoe", "Lake Mead", "Lake Titicaca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLake Champlain.\n\n\tThe Lake Champlain Monster, known often as Champ or Champie, allegedly lives in Lake Champlain, a lake on the Vermont-New York and Quebec, Canada border.  Hundreds of people claim to have seen Champ at some point in time, but there are two stories that are the most well-known.  The first is the Mansi photograph, taken in 1977, which appears to show the head, neck, and right flipper of some type of creature.  Some have claimed it was just a piece of driftwood.  The other was a two minute long video showing something swim towards the shore.  The video was only two minutes long because, as the man who took the video claimed, the cell phone was losing battery.  He said he never saw the creature leave the water, which is why he believes that theories of it being a deer, moose, or dog is inaccurate.  The video was taken in 2005.\r Sounds were recorded in 2003 of a strange whale-like or dolphin-like echolocation sound.  Though no previous whale or dolphin was known to live in the lake, people speculate that Champ is actually an undiscovered species of whale or dolphin.  The Mansi photograph, therefore, has often been dismissed simply as a whale's fluke (tail), and the whale was trolling. \n"}, {"text": "There is a tale that states that some fish in northern regions of North America have grown fur!  The claim is that they grew fur to adapt to the colder climates.  What kind of fish is often described to be \"fur-bearing\"?", "correct": "Trout", "options": ["Cod", "Herring", "Salmon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrout.\n\n\tFur-bearing trout supposedly lurk in the Great Lakes, Canada, Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado.  It is said that due to the very cold waters in these regions, a certain trout species has evolved by growing fur to keep warm.  One theory suggests that four jugs of hair tonic was spilled in the Arkansas River.\r No evidence of any true fur-bearing trout exists.  The alleged sightings of these fish actually began as a misunderstanding in the 17th century.  More recent \"sightings\" began in the 1930s.  One possible explanation for these \"furry fish\" is a type of fungus that sometimes grows on fish in a tuft-like manner, and it can resemble fur.  Usually, the \"fur\" is only seen on a fish that has died and washed ashore. \n"}, {"text": "In 1983, a 15-year-old boy discovered a carcass of an unknown creature, and made sketches of its appearance.  He did not take a sample of the large carcass, however, making the story quite suspicious.  This happened in the Gambia, but what was the creature called?", "correct": "Gambo", "options": ["Gamby", "Gamboni", "GamGam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGambo.\n\n\tGambo was discovered by Owen Burnham and his family in 1983.  Owen, who loved wildlife, took measurements of the beast, and also drew a couple of sketches showing the massive thing.  He claimed not to have a camera, however, so did not take a picture (no camera, on vacation, but had a notepad with colored pencils and measuring tape; peculiar).  He told stories of the beast, and his sketches show what appears to be a prehistoric animal still surviving in the waters of Gambia. However, since no sample was taken, the story seems a bit sketchy (pun intended).  There are many \"explanations\" for Owen's discovery, one being that he made the story up entirely. \n"}, {"text": "There are three different cryptids that are said to lurk in Canadian lakes.  Two of them received names based on the other's name.  Which of these was the first to be named?", "correct": "Ogopogo", "options": ["Igopogo", "Gargopogo", "Manipogo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOgopogo.\n\n\tOgopogo (or Naitaka) was first spotted in the 19th century in Okanagan Lake in British Columbia, Canada.  The first modern-day sighting took place in 1926, where supposedly 30 cars of people witnessed the event.  Igopogo (also called Kempenfelt Kelly) supposedly lurks in Lake Simcoe in Ontario, Canada.  Manipogo, named after both Ogopogo and its supposed location, Manitoba Lake in Manitoba, Canada, was first spotted in the 1940s. \n"}, {"text": "Memphre is yet another Canadian lake monster that is described as looking very similar to the Loch Ness Monster.  In what lake is Memphre said to lurk?", "correct": "Memphremagog", "options": ["Memphreg", "Memphretisiliogogogoch", "Memphrebogart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMemphremagog.\n\n\tMemphre is supposedly a snake-like creature that lives in Lake Memphremagog in Quebec, Canada.  Though it has gained some notoriety, including being featured on a Canadian colored quarter in 2011, it is still not near as famous as another Canadian cryptid: Ogopogo. \n"}, {"text": "The Twilight Dragon of Payette Lake has a much easier-to-say nickname.  What is it?", "correct": "Sharlie", "options": ["Goblin Serpent", "Chuck", "Peppermint Patty Payette (Triple P)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSharlie.\n\n\tThe Twilight Dragon of Payette Lake is known also as Slimy Slim as well as the much easier and quicker to say Sharlie.  Sharlie supposedly lurks in Payette Lake in Idaho, USA.  The first \"sighting\" of the creature was in 1920, when workers thought they saw a log in the water, but then the log started to \"move\".  In 1954, a contest was held to name the Twilight Dragon of Payette Lake, which is when it got its nickname of Sharlie.  Quite a number of sightings of the creature occurred between 1956 and 2002. \n"}, {"text": "Two marine cryptids lurk the waters in a certain country.  They are known as Isshii (Issie) and Kusshii (Kussie), both a play on the Loch Ness Monster's nickname, Nessie.\n\nWhere do these cryptids supposedly call home?", "correct": "Japan", "options": ["Mexico", "France", "South Africa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\tThe names Isshii and Kusshii were both a play on \"Nessie\", the most famous marine cryptid of them all (well, that and the Kraken).  Issie (Isshii) lurks in the waters of Lake Ikeda on Kyushu Island in Japan, and Kussie (Kusshii) lurks in Lake Kussharo on Hokkaido.  In a 2001 film called \"Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack\", Issie is purported to simply be the larva that will soon grow into Mothra. \n"}, {"text": "Although this cryptid was originally given the bizarre description of having three eyes, a long tongue, extremely sharp teeth, and a towering stature, in modern times the description was dulled down a bit... Now it has similar traits to that of a seal.\n\nWhich Canadian lake does Mussie call home?", "correct": "Muskrat Lake", "options": ["Muscle Lake", "Mustard Lake", "Mussagog Lake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMuskrat Lake.\n\n\tMussie (yet another marine cryptid whose nickname is derived from that of Nessie's) supposedly lives in Muskrat Lake, which is just 75 miles northwest of Ottawa, Canada.  Mussie's story dates back to about 300 years ago, with the \"discovery\" that Samuel de Champlain made.\r Muskrat Lake was originally part of the Champlain Sea, before the water receded, leaving Muskrat Lake behind.  This occurred some 6,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age.  That means that it would have been at least that long ago that a sea monster could have arrived in Muskrat Lake; and then got stuck when the waters receded.  This is definitely a possibility, as three species of ice age shrimp have been found in the lake.  There is potential for a much larger creature to have been left behind in the deeper parts of the lake. \n"}]}
