I think you know by now I'm not being flip, but doing meatball surgery you either develop a thick skin or you wind up in the Tokyo Giggling Academy.\"  In reality, this is actually the third 'Dear Dad' type episode.  There was the first one, entitled 'Dear Dad', and the pilot episode featured a 'Dear Dad' narrative as well. So this could actually have been entitled 'Dear Dad...Three', an episode that actually aired in season two.  By the way, this was a very popular theme for M*A*S*H, letters home.  In the fourth season there was a 'Dear Mildred' (Potter), 'Dear Peg' (B.J.), and 'Dear Ma' (Radar).  Sidney Freedman was featured in 'Dear Sigmund' in the fifth season, while a North Korean operative was featured in the season seven episode 'Dear Comrade'.  Mulcahy he also had his chance in the seventh season with 'Dear Sis' while in season eight Klinger wrote to his 'Dear Uncle Abdul'.
