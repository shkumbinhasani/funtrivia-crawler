{"id": "322478", "name": "\"World of Warcraft\" - Elwynn Forest Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "World of Warcraft - Locations", "Vanilla WoW Locations"], "questions": [{"text": "All Human players begin their journeys at what location in Elwynn Forest?", "correct": "Northshire Abbey", "options": ["Ammen Vale", "Coldridge Valley", "Shadowglen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorthshire Abbey.\n\n\tImmediately after creating your new Human character, you'll appear in front of the Abbey and commence your starter quests.  The Abbey, found in the middle of the forest at the end of a path, contains many low-level NPC characters whose sole purpose is to help you through the baby steps of the game.  Within the Abbey, players can converse with people in the Main Hall, Hall of Arms, and a Library Wing.  Merchants and traders can be found at caravans outside the Abbey while a Resurrection Shrine can be found to the side of the structure. \n"}, {"text": "What type of creatures can be found in and around Echo Ridge Mine?", "correct": "Kobolds", "options": ["Murlocs", "Dire wolves", "Humans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKobolds.\n\n\tThe Echo Ridge Mine is found to the northwest of Northshire Abbey, and players will make their way through it as part of their Human starter quests.  In addition to fighting the Kobold crew in and around this Mine, players can also defeat wolfs in the nearby forests and the Defias Brotherhood in Northshire Vineyards to the east. This area is home to Garrick Padfoot, whose head must be claimed for one of the later quests.  Players in this area are only likely to reach level 5 before moving on.  There are only few quests of note in the region and staying to level would be time-consuming if continued. \n"}, {"text": "Heading south from the Human starting area, players will reach a village down the path.  What is the name of this town?", "correct": "Goldshire", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoldshire.\n\n\tGoldshire is the first stop for new Human players as it contains many of the early essential trainers (ie. First Aid, Cooking, etc.).  In addition, there are many class and profession trainers for players not quite ready to make their way to the main Human city nearby.  Goldshire contains an inn, merchants, and several quest-giving NPCs.  The inn, known as Lion's Pride Inn, is often regarded as one of the most well-known inns in all of the \"World of Warcraft\".  The woods around Goldshire are filled with enemies between levels 5 and 8. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not a location in Stormwind City?", "correct": "Elder Rise", "options": ["The Park", "Old Town", "Cathedral Square"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElder Rise.\n\n\tElder Rise is an area found in Thunder Bluff, the Horde city home to the Tauren.  Players heading to Stormwind will instead find a city situated on the shores of the Great Sea.  In the northwest corner of the city, players can find Stormwind Harbour.  In addition to this, a number of different areas of the city are neatly organized to accommodate players of any class and profession. One can spread themselves out to visit the Mage Quarter, the Dwarven District, Cathedral Square, Old Town, Stormwind Keep, the Trade District, and The Park if they so choose, or connect to other major Alliance cities. \n"}, {"text": "What location rests just off the shores of Crystal Lake?", "correct": "Tower of Azora", "options": ["North Point Tower", "Ember Spear Tower", "Scarlet Tower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTower of Azora.\n\n\tThe Tower of Azora, found slightly east of the creepily-named 'Crystal Lake', is a mage's tower containing a number of quest-giving and merchant NPCs and a trainer or two.  Since the tower is found in a low-level zone, many of the quests revolving around it won't go higher than level 8.  All of the goings-on found here are east down the path from Goldshire.  On the top floor of the tower, one can find the Eye of Azora, a crystal ball that triggers a cinematic for Alliance players. \n"}, {"text": "Stonecairn Lake does not contain any islands.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tStonecairn Lake, found in the eastern end of Elwynn Forest, contains a single large island comprised of a number of mythical stones.  Possibly a reference to another Blizzard game, \"Diablo II\", the stones have magical capabilities.  The Defias Brotherhood has also taken a firm grip on the land, and they populate the entire region.  No paths lead directly to Stonecairn Island, so you'll need to go off-road.  It's easy to find though- simply follow the river north. \n"}, {"text": "What is true about Eastvale Logging Camp?", "correct": "It's Alliance-friendly", "options": ["It's infested with Murlocs", "It's Horde-friendly", "It's a ghost-town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's Alliance-friendly.\n\n\tEastvale Logging Camp is found at the eastern edge of Elwynn Forest, and it is the first location at which Human characters can upgrade their Riding Profession (Humans ride horses, normally).  Eastvale is also home to a set of quests for the region, taking characters up toward level 10, the end of the range for the zone.  To get to Eastvale, one can simply follow the path from Goldshire east.  If you get to Ridgepoint Tower on your right, you've gone too far.  The entire area is home to Alliance quest-givers- nothing within the bounds of the village is deadly unless you bring it there.  :) \n"}, {"text": "What can be found at Forest's Edge?", "correct": "Westbrook Garrison", "options": ["Fargodeep Mine", "The Stonefield Farm", "The Maclure Vineyards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWestbrook Garrison.\n\n\tForest's Edge is at the western-most edge of the Elwynn Forest map, bordering another zone and connecting directly to it.  Westbrook Garrison is at the north end of this area at a fork in the road, and players coming here for quests will find that the fortress is inhabited by Stormwind Guards (the type you'd see in Stormwind City).  Hilariously, a 'Morale Officer' can be found inside the Garrison...selling alcoholic beverages.\rA wanted poster for 'Hogger' can also be found at the path out front. \n"}, {"text": "Which bordering region is to the east of Elwynn Forest?", "correct": "Redridge Mountains", "options": ["Burning Steppes", "Westfall", "Duskwood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRedridge Mountains.\n\n\tSmack-dab in the center of Azeroth, Elwynn Forest is in between a number of different zones, most of which accommodate new Human players all the way up to level 30.  Westfall (to the west, heh) is the lowest from level 10-20 while Redridge Mountains, directly to the east, range from level 15-25.  Duskwood is to the south, and players need to cross the river marking the border of Elwynn Forest in order to access it.  The only bridge is in the southeast.  Burning Steppes does not connect directly to Elwynn Forest though it does border to the northeast. \n"}, {"text": "Only one instance can be found in Elwynn Forest.  What is its name?", "correct": "The Stockade", "options": ["Gnomeregan", "Ragefire Chasm", "Deadmines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Stockade.\n\n\tThe Stockades, like Ragefire Chasm, is found within one of the game's major cities; while Ragefire Chasm is found in Orgrimmar in Durotar, The Stockade finds its home in Stormwind City's Depths.  Ragefire Chasm is typically known as the game's lowest-level dungeon.  The Stockades takes a step up from it though.  Rather than the level 13-16 range seen in Orgrimmar, The Stockades range from level 22-30.  Bazil Thredd, a member of the Defias Brotherhood, is known as the final opponent you'll face in the Stormwind Stockades. \n"}]}
