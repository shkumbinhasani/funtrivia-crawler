{"id": "81104", "name": "Early Scientists of Alexandria Quiz | People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "Scientists & Inventors", " Scientists"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the Ptolemy kings of ancient Egypt built the great library in Alexandria? \n", "correct": "Ptolemy II Philadelphus", "options": ["Ptolemy I Soter", "Ptolemy IV Philopator", "Ptolemy III Euergetes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPtolemy II Philadelphus.\n\n\tWith the founding of the library and a museum in Alexandria by\rPtolemy II, the great tradition of learning began in Alexandria as intellectuals came from\rthroughout the world to partake in the learned atmosphere. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these cities was the greatest rival of Alexandria as a seat for scholarly affairs?", "correct": "Pergamum", "options": ["Ephesus", "Antioch", "Ecbatana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPergamum.\n\n\tThe Ptolemys were so jealous of their own success that they placed an\rembargo on the export of papyrus, from which we get the word 'paper'.  In Pergamum,\rbecause there wasn't access to papyrus, scientists developed an alternative medium,\rmembranum pergamentum, from animal skins.  We get the word 'parchment' from this\rname. \n"}, {"text": "One of the first scholars to be called to Alexandria was this famous author of the\n'Elements of Geometry'.  Name that scholar!", "correct": "Euclid", "options": ["Diosthenes", "Ptolemy", "Thales"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEuclid.\n\n\tEuclid's 'Elements' was not the first\rtextbook on geometry.  The first was written by Hippocrates of Chios (not to be confused\rwith the famous physician, Hippocrates of Cos) a century or so before.  Euclid's work,\rhowever, gained such prominence that parts of it were still being used up until the\rmodern era. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these fellows has been called the 'Copernicus of Antiquity' because of his\nheliocentric outlook on our solar system? ", "correct": "Aristarchus", "options": ["Eudoxus", "Theophrastus", "Strabo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAristarchus.\n\n\tAristarchus, who was from the\risland of Samos, came to teach at Alexandria soon after Euclid.  He is credited with\rbeing the first scientist to propose that the earth revolves around the sun. \n"}, {"text": "Herophilus of Chalcedon, an early anatomist, was one of the first scientists to dissect a\nhuman body publicly.  He also proposed all of the following innovative ideas about the human body save which one?", "correct": "The heart was the center of the circulatory system", "options": ["Veins and arteries perform different functions", "The brain is the seat of human intelligence", "Arteries pulsate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe heart was the center of the circulatory system.\n\n\tHerophilus was indeed a great\rscientist, but failed to fully grasp the function of the heart, and hence never came to\runderstand the physiology of the circulatory system. \n"}, {"text": "Another early anatomist, which fellow hypothesized that every organ in the human body\nwas a complex of a tripartite system of vessels - veins, arteries and nerves - that branched\ninto ever more minute vessels until too small for the human eye to see? ", "correct": "Erasistratus", "options": ["Cliomenes", "Sosigenes", "Aratus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErasistratus.\n\n\tErasistratus was another of the great scientists originally from the Aegean isles, Chios in\rhis case.  He made many fantastic discoveries and hypotheses, some useful, for example\rthat the cerebrum and cerebellum were separate portions of the brain, and some\rfantastical, such as his supposition about pneuma (or 'vital spirit') entering the lungs and\rheart through the air we breathe. \n"}, {"text": "For which Syracusan king was Archimedes working when he made his great discoveries\nabout the specific weights of metals?", "correct": "Hiero", "options": ["Dionysius", "Cephalus", "Cronion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHiero.\n\n\tHiero requested that Archimedes measure\rthe weight of crown somehow in order to discover whether or not it was of pure gold. \rArchimedes realized how he might follow through on Hiero's request while in his bath,\robserving the displacement of water that occurred when he plunged in.  So excited was\rthe great scientist that he lept from the bath, stark naked, and ran out of his house\rscreaming 'Eureka! Eureka!'.  He had truly found it... \n"}, {"text": "A quiz on ancient scientists couldn't be taken seriously without at least two questions on\nArchimedes, so here's another one.  About what device was Archimedes referring when\nhe said, \"Give me but a place to stand, and I can move the world.\"?", "correct": "Lever", "options": ["Balance", "Wedge", "Screw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLever.\n\n\tArchimedes\rdid not discover this simple machine, but his work on describing the mathematical\rprinciples behind the function of a lever expanded its theoretical applications immensely. \n"}, {"text": "Which great Alexandrian scholar wrote the 'Conics'? ", "correct": "Apollonius", "options": ["Heracleides", "Philolaus", "Callipus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApollonius.\n\n\tApollonius of Perga\r(not Pergamum!) showed that, using a plane, all three types of conic sections, the ellipse,\rthe parabola and the hyperbola, could be derived from the same cone. \n"}, {"text": "Eratosthenes, librarian and genius, is most remembered for having calculated with a high\ndegree of accuracy the earth's circumference.  He is also known for a device which\nelicited the prime numbers, which has been attached to his name by posterity.  What is\nthis device called?", "correct": "Sieve", "options": ["Abacus", "Bones", "Grate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSieve.\n\n\tEratosthenes also developed the first world map using\rlongitude and latitude lines, among his many other great projects.
