{"id": "406746", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 28\" [3] Online Trivia | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 28"], "questions": [{"text": "Before starting the fifth leg of the race in Chamonix, France, all teams received which of the following?", "correct": "Winter gear", "options": ["A U-Turn vote", "Snowshoes", "A video call from home"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinter gear.\n\n\tTeams started Leg 5 having bundled up in new winter gear in a Chamonix hotel and they hit the ground running to search for one of eight vehicles in the nearby streets for one in a list of provided license plates.  With this vehicle they could instruct their driver to travel to Les Grands Montets Gondola Station to find their next clue.  Ascending nearly 11,000 feet into the mountains in a gondola, teams could reach the peak and one member of each could collect their clue dangling across a suspension line above a precipice. \n"}, {"text": "During their Detour, teams had to transport a backpack containing which of these?", "correct": "Baguette", "options": ["Sweater", "Wine", "First aid gear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaguette.\n\n\tBoth Detour tasks were held high above Chamonix while the teams were perched on the Mont Blanc Massif.  For the first of these options, 'Dynamite', teams needed to navigate the peak via ferrata, collecting two sticks of dynamite from their starting point and delivering them to mountaineers along with a baguette provided to them before their ascent of the mountain.  If they could scale this circuit and return to the starting point they could get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which was the only team to complete the 'Campsite' Detour task in Chamonix in Leg 5?", "correct": "Burnie and Ashley", "options": ["Dana and Matt", "Scott and Blair", "Brodie and Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurnie and Ashley.\n\n\tIf teams didn't want to scale the cliffs of Mont Blanc they instead had the opportunity to hunker down.  In 'Campsite', teams headed to a marked plateau where, using a marked example, they had to create a mountain campsite nestled in the snow, properly pitching their tent and accompanying equipment to the approval of a local mountaineer.  Only Burnie and Ashley attempted this task which, to their disappointment, took much longer than the other at their exhausting altitude. \n"}, {"text": "Which Alpine activity did team members participate in during the Road Block in Leg 5?", "correct": "Paragliding", "options": ["Snowboarding", "Snowmobiling", "Rappeling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParagliding.\n\n\tCompleting their Detour task, teams descended the mountain they were on and returned to their waiting vehicles.  Their climbing days weren't over, however, as they then had to head across Chamonix to Planpraz Gondola Station to find their next clue box.  Here, one member of each team embarked on their Road Block task, putting the wind beneath their wings as they ascended to the top of Aiguilles Rouges and paragliding over the Alps. Launching at more than 7,000 feet up, participants tandem glided to the landing spot while looking out for a yeti along the way.  If they could answer a question about the yeti (and the flag he waved) they would receive their next clue. Brodie, Korey, Matt, Rachel, Blair, Erin, Ashley, and Sheri were selected for this task. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated in France at the end of Leg 5?", "correct": "Erin and Joslyn", "options": ["Zach and Rachel", "Sheri and Cole", "Burnie and Ashley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErin and Joslyn.\n\n\tOnce team members reunited at the end of the paragliding Road Block, they opened their clues to be directed to the fifth Pit Stop sitting in front of the statue of Michel-Gabriel Picard in Place Balmat.  Tyler and Korey overtook Brodie and Kurt during the Road Block and checked in in first place (for the second time during the race).  For their win they took with them a trip for two to Boracay in the Philippines courtesy of Travelocity. Although several teams struggled with this last task, it was Erin and Joslyn who completed the Road Block last and they fell to the back of the pack.  They were eliminated in eighth place overall. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 6, teams made their way to Armenia, finding their first clue in Yerevan in which of these destinations?", "correct": "Yerevan Opera Theater", "options": ["Yerevan Ballet Theater", "Yerevan Cathedral", "Yerevan Olympic Stadium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYerevan Opera Theater.\n\n\tLeaving snowy Chamonix, France in the late evening, teams opened their first clue for Leg 6 and headed to the airport to catch a flight to Yerevan, the capital city of Armenia.  Upon their arrival, they could make their way by taxi to the Yerevan Opera Theater where their next clue box would be waiting.  It was here that they needed to wait for the box office to open for a morning performance, but in the meantime they would be warned that an Express Pass would be handed to the winner of the leg, valid until the end of Leg 9. \n"}, {"text": "To get their Detour clue in Leg 6, teams had to visit the Yerevan Cascade.  What is this landmark?", "correct": "A staircase", "options": ["A funicular", "A waterfall", "A skyscraper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA staircase.\n\n\tEntering the Yerevan Opera Theater, teams received their clue, hidden in the hands of the theater's janitor, and were instructed to head on foot to the Yerevan Cascade, a massive staircase in the city's center.  Teams needed to climb all the way to the top of the landmark, five hundred and seventy-two steps up.  Once they snagged the clue, they would be able to select their Detour task, 'Thread' or 'Bread', taking them deeper into the work and culture in Yerevan. \n"}, {"text": "Which Detour task was completed by more teams in Armenia (in Leg 6)?", "correct": "'Thread'", "options": ["'Head'", "'Bread'", "'Shred'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Thread'.\n\n\tIn 'Thread', teams needed to make their way to the Megerian Carpet Factory, joining the local carpet weavers by completing a row of two hundred stitches on an intricate carpet while in 'Bread', teams stopped at the Parvana Restaurant to make traditional Armenian bread, lavash, creating fifteen proper pieces in an underground oven to trade for their next clue.  Sheri and Cole, Dana and Matt, Zach and Rachel, Tyler and Korey, and Scott and Blair all completed 'Thread' while Brodie and Kurt while Burnie and Ashley completed 'Bread'. \n"}, {"text": "Team members worked with cars in the Leg 6 Road Block, replacing which of these for their task?", "correct": "Oil", "options": ["Windshield", "Seating", "Engine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOil.\n\n\tLeaving Yerevan after their Detour tasks were complete, teams needed to head to Republic Square and catch the #13 bus out of the city, taking themselves to the first bus stop on the H3 after the town of Hatsavan.  Once there, they would find a roadside stall and their next clue, a Road Block.  For this task, one member of each team needed to assist local vehicle-owners, bringing a Lada up onto a roadside ramp to perform an oil change using provided tools and instructions. Once they completed the maintenance they could take their car to the Pit Stop.  Kurt, Sheri, Burnie, Zach, Matt, Scott, and Tyler participated in this one. \n"}, {"text": "Leg 6 ended with a non-elimination Pit Stop, but who arrived last?", "correct": "Sheri and Cole", "options": ["Dana and Matt", "Tyler and Korey", "Scott and Blair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheri and Cole.\n\n\tCompleting the Road Block, teams were able to use the cars they'd serviced to go to the sixth Pit Stop of the race, the Temple of Garni.  Brodie and Kurt arrived in first, returning to the front of the pack and taking their third win of the race.  Because they led the pack this leg, they also won the Express Pass which, in this race, could be used in Leg 7, Leg 8, or Leg 9, at their discretion, to skip one task. Sheri and Cole fell to last despite a lead throughout the leg (due in part to a tough oil filter during the Road Block).  They were fortunate, however, as Leg 6 wasn't only a non-elimination leg, but a keep-on-racing leg. \n"}]}
