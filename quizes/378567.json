{"id": "378567", "name": "British Cinema - \"Ba Gum!\"  It's 'Hobson's Choice' Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "   Movies H-K", "Hobson's Choice"], "questions": [{"text": "The role of Henry Hobson is played by actor Charles Laughton.  In the opening scene we see him arriving home in the early hours of the morning after supposedly attending a meeting of which secretive organisation?", "correct": "Masonic Lodge", "options": ["Chamber of Commerce", "Golf Club", "Temperance Movement"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMasonic Lodge.\n\n\t\"It's a good job your Mason's meeting is only once a month!\" scolds a disgruntled Maggie, the eldest of Hobson's three daughters who has just been awoken by her father's noisy return home.  An arrogant and bombastic character, Henry Hobson is the proprietor of an established and successful shoe and boot-making business in the northern town of Salford. He runs the business with the help of his daughters, Maggie, played by Brenda de Banzie, Alice, played by Daphne Anderson, and Vicky, played by Prunella Scales.  Both Alice and Vicky are courting local businessmen; however, their father flatly refuses to pay settlements, a type of dowry, thereby leaving them both in a position where they cannot marry.This state of events becomes very important to the plot later in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Under what circumstances do we first meet the shoe and boot maker William Mossop, the character played by John Mills?", "correct": "Being congratulated by a customer", "options": ["Working behind the counter in Hobson's shop", "Spying on the three Hobson girls", "Running for a bus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeing congratulated by a customer.\n\n\tMrs Hepworth, a very well heeled (if you'll excuse the pun) and important local personage, arrives unannounced at Hobson's premises and wishes to speak with the tradesman that made the pair of boots that she is wearing.  The fawning Hobson, believing that he is about to receive a complaint about the quality of the workmanship, is promptly told to shut up by Mrs Hepworth.  Maggie summons the boot-makers through the hatch in the shop floor.\r \"Now, listen to me my man.  I'm particular about what I put on my feet, I've tried every shop in Manchester and these are the best made pair of boots I've ever had. Now, you make my boots in future... Do you hear that Hobson?\" asks Mrs Hepworth, handing bootmaker Will Mossop her card of introduction.  \r Immediately after she leaves, Hobson begins to complain about the fact that Mrs Hepworth had the temerity to praise one of his tradesmen directly.  Referring to Will as a \"treasure\", Maggie scoldingly puts her father in his place. \r In actual fact, John Mills was selected for the part of Will Mossop at the eleventh hour.  The actor originally cast in the role, Robert Donat, had to decline the part due to asthma. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the public house in which Henry Hobson spends most of his time and a lot of his money?", "correct": "The Moonrakers", "options": ["The Woolpack Inn", "The Nag's Head", "The Slaughtered Lamb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Moonrakers.\n\n\tHobson spends most of his time with his small circle of friends, all local businessmen, in the tap room of The Moonrakers.  The delusional Hobson also believes that he is a popular figure locally and especially within his social circle. In reality, the veneer of their friendship is rather thin as we shall see later in the tale during a scene in which Hobson falls out with them all after telling them a few home truths. \n"}, {"text": "During Will and Maggie's first meeting at Peel Park, Salford, Maggie presents Will with something that is customary for courting couples to carry whilst walking out on a Sunday.  What is this item?", "correct": "The Holy Bible", "options": ["A portion of fish and chips", "Cinema tickets", "A nosegay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Holy Bible.\n\n\tIn a move that would have been unprecedented during the time in which this film is set, Maggie tells Will Mossop, in no uncertain terms, that she intends that they are to be married.  Shocked by her forthrightness, Will tries to come up with any excuse as to why they cannot be wed.  Ignoring this, Maggie instructs Will that he is to meet her at Peel Park on Sunday where they will embark on their first walking out. Maggie meets Will at the foot of a flight of steps and taking his hand, she presses into his a copy of the good book before they start their walk.  Peel Park, a grand Victorian open space in its heyday, first opened on the 22nd of August 1846. It lies on the flood plain of the River Irwell in Greater Manchester. \n"}, {"text": "During a visit to Will Mossop's lodgings, an argument breaks out between Maggie and his supposed fianc\u00e9e.  Will leaves the building and stands outside whilst the argument continues.  Looking up, Will's eye is drawn to a banner being carried during a Temperance parade.  What dire warning is emblazoned on this banner?", "correct": "Beware the Wrath to Come", "options": ["Pankhurst is Innocent!", "Mine's a Pint", "Eat at the Salford Emporium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeware the Wrath to Come.\n\n\tThe film takes place during the period when the British Temperance Movement was at the peak of its popularity. Clearly it wasn't as popular with the working classes as it was with those members of the upper and middle social classes who had established it!  Whilst Maggie, Ada Figgins and her harridan of a mother argue about Will's future in their squalid parlour, a slightly bemused Will waits outside for Maggie. As the parade approaches Will looks up at the banner and reads its message before taking a gulp of air as an expression of concern moves across his face.  As they leave Maggie slips into a darkened alleyway and asks Will to kiss her. Although Will is sorely tempted to do so, he finds it impossible to kiss her in broad daylight! \n"}, {"text": "Maggie and Will succeed in raising the grand sum of one hundred pounds in order to start up in business on their own.  From what source do they obtain this money?", "correct": "Mrs Hepworth, the satisfied customer", "options": ["From a wallet found in the street", "A loan from the Manchester and Salford Bank", "A payday loan company"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMrs Hepworth, the satisfied customer.\n\n\tAfter Maggie reveals to her father that she intends that she and Will are to be married, an argument ensues.  The following morning, as was customary, Hobson intends to beat any amorous feelings that Will Mossop has for his daughter out of him with a heavy leather belt.  After Hobson strikes Will Mossop for a second time both he and Maggie carry out their threat to leave and set up in business on their own. Mrs Hepworth believes that Will and Maggie offer a safe and secure investment opportunity and lend the pair the money to start up their business. The pair offer to repay Mrs Hepworth with the full amount back plus 20 percent within the year. When asked what security they can offer, Maggie responds with, \"Him, he's the security. He's the best boot maker in Lancashire.\"  That evening, after denigrating his daughter and Will in the lounge bar of the Moonrakers, the arrogant Hobson is, once again, put in his place when another drinker reveals that he had been paid to print and deliver 500 flyers advertising Will and Maggie's new business.  \n"}, {"text": "In perhaps the most well remembered scene in the film, an inebriated Henry Hobson finds himself in the street outside his local hostelry.  As he slumps against a street lamp in order to prevent himself from falling, what is it that catches his eye reflected in a puddle of water?", "correct": "The moon", "options": ["The local floozy", "A burglar forcing entry to his shop", "Maggie and Will stealing a kiss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe moon.\n\n\tAfter Hobson leaves the Moonrakers under something of a dark cloud after voicing his drunken opinions about his friends, he wanders into the street outside and stumbles.  Preventing himself from falling, he supports himself using a lamp post and, as he steadies himself he notices the reflection of the moon in a puddle.  As Hobson makes his way across the street the reflection of the moon moves from puddle to puddle encouraging the inebriated Hobson to playfully chase it.\r Incidentally, the term 'floozy' is a rarely used word used to describe a woman of similar social standing to an American hooker. \n"}, {"text": "For what offence, or offences, does Hobson receive a court summons from Beenstock and Sons, the corn chandlers?", "correct": "Trespass and damage", "options": ["Loitering", "Affray", "Drunk and disorderly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrespass and damage.\n\n\tWhilst making his way back home after the puddle jumping incident, Hobson removes a safety chain and falls into the basement grain store of his neighbour and supporter of the Temperance Movement, Mr Beenstock.  As a result, Hobson receives a summons to answer a charge of trespass and damage.  This provides daughter Maggie with an ideal opportunity to manoeuver her father into allowing her sisters to finally achieve their aims of marrying. Maggie knows that her father will not want his personal business made public in the local press and proposes that he allow his daughters to marry their paramours, who just happen to be young Freddy Beenstock, played by Derek Blomfield, the son of the plaintiff, and Mr Albert Prosser played by Richard Wattis, the local solicitor and legal professional acting for the plaintiff. Needless to say, the humbled Hobson has no option but to accept Maggie's proposal and the terms under which Hobson's prosecution will remain out of the public domain... a real Hobson's Choice! \n"}, {"text": "Waking up on New Year's Day, Henry Hobson is horrified to see what he believes to be a swarm of insects circling above his bed.  As he sits up in bed rubbing his eyes, is he horrified to see what creature leaning over the bed frame staring at him?", "correct": "A giant mouse", "options": ["A unicorn", "A parrot", "A praying mantis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA giant mouse.\n\n\tHobson tries his best to look after himself but not eating properly and his continuing over-indulgence in alcohol takes its toll on his health. Hobson, now suffering from the DT's or delirium tremens, is shocked to see a large mouse looking at him from over the foot of his bed.  Hobson's remaining employee, Tubby who is played by future Coronation Street veteran Jack Howarth, calls the doctor and it is during his examination that we have one of the best one-liners in the film.  The doctor, played by fine Scottish actor John Laurie, is concerned that Hobson is not looking after himself properly.\r \"Have you a wife, Mr Hobson?\" the doctor asks.  Hobson, whose wife had died many years earlier, remains silent and gestures upwards with a pointed finger.  \"In bed?\" asks the doctor again.  \"Higher than that,\" replies Hobson.\r Brilliant. They don't write them like that anymore! \n"}, {"text": "The film ends with Will and Maggie Mossop accepting their old positions at Hobson's shop with an increase in their salaries and free accommodation?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAfter the refusal by Hobson's two youngest daughters to stay at home and look after their ailing father - they are both now married and youngest daughter Vicky is expecting her first child - Will and Maggie agree to return to her father's home and look after him.  However there are to be one or two conditions attached. Firstly Maggie demands that her father makes her husband a full partner in the business with Hobson taking the role of a sleeping partner, receiving a percentage of the profits but having no say in how the business is run.  Will Mossop, now a confident and successful businessman in his own right, demands that the business title is changed to exclude her father, a suggestion to which Maggie will not agree to.  The three of them eventually settle on renaming the new business 'Mossop and Hobson' and, as the film closes the three of them make their way out of the shop and head off to Albert Prosser's to have a Deed of Partnership drawn up. \n"}]}
