{"id": "187869", "name": "Mixed NBA Basketball #6 Quiz | Basketball | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "  Basketball", "NBA Challenge"], "questions": [{"text": "One of the rarest events in NBA statistical history is the 'quadruple-double', when one player has double digit figures in four statistical categories (e.g. points, rebounds, assists, steals or blocks).  Which of these players never achieved this rare feat in an NBA game?", "correct": "Michael Jordan", "options": ["Nate Thurmond", "David Robinson", "Hakeem Olajuwan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Jordan.\n\n\tHis Airness is good, but he has never achieved such greatness.  In fact, through the 2003-04 NBA season only four players had ever achieved this goal.  Nate Thurmond had 22 points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists and 12 blocks in a game on October 18, 1974 with the Chicago Bulls, the first recorded quadruple double in NBA history. Alvin Robinson matched this feat with the Spurs on February 18, 1986 by recording a 20 point, 11 rebound, 10 assist and 10 steal night versus Phoenix.  On March 29, 1990, Hakeem Olajuwan (then spelled 'Akeem') had 18 points, 16 rebounds, 10 assists and 11 blocks for the Rockets against Milwaukee. David Robinson recorded the fourth quadruple double in NBA history on February 17, 1994 with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 blocks against Detroit.  Jason Kidd scored a rather embarrassing quadruple double (though this would not be recognized as an 'official' quadruple double by the NBA) when he scored 18 points, had 12 rebounds and 10 assists and recorded 14 turnovers in a game against the Knicks on November 18, 2000.  \n"}, {"text": "Which NBA team played a number of their 'home' games in Las Vegas during the 1983-84 season?", "correct": "Utah Jazz", "options": ["Los Angeles Lakers", "Seattle Supersonics", "Phoenix Suns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUtah Jazz.\n\n\tA ha...Another stealth Jazz question!  1983 was a shaky year for the Jazz.  Having difficult times with funding the franchise, owner Sam Battistone resorted to desperate measures.  Aside from trading one of their top young stars to Denver (Danny Schayes) for Rich Kelley and cash, the Jazz had also dumped their previous first round pick, Dominique Wilkins, on Atlanta for John Drew and cash (can you imagine a team with Wilkins, Stockton and Malone together?)  The Jazz also scheduled 11 home games in Las Vegas for the 1983-84 season in hopes of raising quick cash. Sadly, this led to one of the most memorable moments in NBA history, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar breaking the all-time scoring record for an individual player, in Las Vegas rather than Salt Lake. On the bright side, the team remained in Utah! \n"}, {"text": "Which former NBA player was charged with manslaughter in 2002 for the death of a limousine driver?", "correct": "Jayson Williams", "options": ["Orlando Woolridge", "Larry Johnson", "Xavier McDaniel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJayson Williams.\n\n\tJayson Williams, an NBA funnyman and a good rebounder to boot, played for both the New Jersey Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers during his career.  Though he played for nine seasons in the NBA, he is now better known as the defendent in a highly publicized murder trial.  In February of 2002 a limousine driver named Costas Christofi was killed  at Williams' estate in Alexandria, N.J.  The trial ended in an out-of-court settlement in 2004, but Williams' reputation was permanently stained. \n"}, {"text": "The largest crowd in NBA history was assembled on March 27, 1998 at which of these arenas in order to see Michael Jordan play, presumably, for the last time?", "correct": "Georgia Dome", "options": ["Alamodome", "Pontiac Silverdome", "Target Center"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorgia Dome.\n\n\tOn March 27, 1998, a crowd of 62,046 NBA fans attended a game between the Chicago Bulls and the Atlanta Hawks, eclipsing the previous record crowd of 61,983 for a game between Detroit and Boston at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1988.  I guess the fans in Atlanta thought they were seeing the last of Michael Jordan there, but alas not... \n"}, {"text": "Larry Brown's NBA championship with the 2003-04 Detroit Pistons was the first basketball championship of his career, college or pro.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLarry Brown played for five ABA teams, helping the Oakland Oaks win a championship in the 1968-69 season.  He coached a number of teams as well during his career prior to the 2003-04 season with Detroit.  These included Carolina and Denver of the ABA, the Nets, Spurs, Clippers, Pacers and 76ers of the NBA and UCLA and Kansas in the college ranks.  His previous championship came in 1988 with the Kansas Jayhawks. \n"}, {"text": "Which NBA team only lost a single home game in the 1985-86 season?", "correct": "Boston Celtics", "options": ["Utah Jazz", "Houston Rockets", "Milwaukee Bucks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston Celtics.\n\n\tDuring the 85-86 season the Boston Celtics lost only a single game at home, scoring an amazing 40-1 home win/loss record.  For the season, the Celtics went 67-15 and won the NBA championship by defeating the Houston Rockets 4-2 in the finals. \n"}, {"text": "Yao Ming, the #1 draft pick in the 2002 NBA draft, was the first non-U.S. born player to be drafted in the top position in the NBA draft.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNot even close, actually.  Mychal Thompson, drafted #1 in 1978 by Portland, was born in the Bahamas.  The #1 draft pick in 1984, Hakeem Olajuwan, was born in Nigeria.  The following year, Patrick Ewing was drafted #1 by the New York Knicks; he was born in Jamaica.  Like Olajuwan, the #1 draft pick in 1998, Michael Olowokandi, was born in Nigeria.  However, Yao Ming is considered to be the first 'international player' drafted #1 (meaning, never having played in the United States in college or otherwise). \n"}, {"text": "Hakeem Olajuwan was one of the 'Twin Towers' featured in the Houston Rockets' line-up in the mid-1980s.  Who was the other 'tower'?", "correct": "Ralph Sampson", "options": ["Sam Bowie", "Jack Sikma", "Swen Nater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRalph Sampson.\n\n\tOlajuwan teamed with Ralph Sampson to form arguably the greatest 1-2 big man tandem in NBA history (though San Antonio Spurs fans might argue that Tim Duncan and David Robinson deserve that distinction).  Sampson, who would typically play the power forward position, stood 7' 4\" tall, while Olajuwan, the center, stood 7' 0\".  Despite their imposing collective height, they never won a championship together. \n"}, {"text": "How many times in a row did the Lakers lose to the Celtics in the NBA finals before finally defeating their arch nemesis in the 1984-85 season finals?", "correct": "8", "options": ["1", "6", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n8.\n\n\tThe Lakers lost to the Celtics in the finals in the following seasons: 1958-59 (still in Minneapolis), 1961-62 (now in Los Angeles), 1962-63, 1964-65, 1965-66, 1967-68, 1968-69, 1983-84.  They finally broke the jinx against the Celtics by winning game six 111-100.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the finals MVP that year. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first player to have his number retired for the Minnesota Timberwolves, a franchise that began play in the NBA in 1989?", "correct": "Malik Sealy", "options": ["Stephon Marbury", "Sam Mitchell", "Tom Gugliotta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMalik Sealy.\n\n\tIf you'll recall, Malik Sealy sadly passed away in an auto accident in the year 2000.  He played for the Pacers, Clippers, Pistons and Timberwolves in a career in which he average 10 points per game.  Sealy only played two seasons with the Timberwolves.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you learned a thing or two and will try some of my other NBA-related quizzes! \n"}]}
