{"id": "59538", "name": "The Empire of Genghis Khan Trivia Game | History | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "       Asian"], "questions": [{"text": "Son of a tribal chieftain, Genghis Khan nonetheless had to struggle from childhood - not only for political power, but also for survival. Why was his father's prestige useless to him?", "correct": "His father had been assassinated by a rival tribe.", "options": ["His father had never been more than a figurehead.", "His father was hated and resented by his people.", "His father had disowned him."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis father had been assassinated by a rival tribe.\n\n\tOriginally named Temujin ('blacksmith'), Genghis was the third son of the minor chieftain Yesugei. He was 9 when his father was poisoned by the neighboring Tatars. Since Yesugei's followers then fled, the child had to become partly responsible for keeping his family from starvation. \n"}, {"text": "Genghis's first task was to unite the various tribes of the Mongolian steppe under Mongol rule, which he accomplished by means of a shifting web of alliances and conquests. In what year was he acclaimed as ruler of all Mongolia?", "correct": "1206", "options": ["1213", "1200", "1194"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1206.\n\n\tA kuriltai, or assembly of nobles, declared Genghis the supreme Khan - or ruler - after he had defeated the Tatars, the Naimans, the Merkits, the Keraits, and allied himself with the Qonggirats by marrying their Princess Bortei. It was probably at this time that the forty-year-old Temujin took the name Genghis Khan: 'oceanic ruler.' \n"}, {"text": "As Genghis looked to expand his power beyond the steppes of Mongolia, neighboring powers either bolstered their defenses or tried to join his supporters. One people in particular were quick to ally themselves with him, and they were rewarded with high positions in the Mongol government. Even their alphabet was adapted to write Mongolian. Who were these people of western China?", "correct": "the Uighurs", "options": ["the Hsi-Hsia", "the Keraits", "the Song"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe Uighurs.\n\n\tThis alliance worked out very well for the Uighurs, who sat near the top of the new empire as all their neighbors - the Keraits of the Mongolian steppes, the Hsi-Hsia in northern China, the Song Dynasty in southern China, and countless others - were swallowed up by the Mongol juggernaut. \n"}, {"text": "At this time, China was divided into three kingdoms: the Jin in the northeast, the Hsi-Hsia in the northwest, and the Song Empire in the south. Genghis Khan, tempted by Chinese wealth, began his invasions soon after he had secured his power in Mongolia. Which of the three kingdoms was the first to fall, in 1209?", "correct": "Hsi-Hsia", "options": ["None of these - the first didn't fall until 1213", "Song Empire", "Jin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHsi-Hsia.\n\n\tHsi-Hsia, a kingdom ruled by the Tangut people, wasn't able to put up much of a fight. Genghis made the kingdom a vassal state, requiring tribute and soldiers. As his armies marched west, though, the Hsi-Hsia refused to provide soldiers for him any longer. As soon as his western enemies were subdued in the 1220s, Genghis got his revenge, slaughtering most of the Tangut citizens and utterly destroying the ruling and intellectual classes. \n"}, {"text": "In 1214, the Mongols forced another Chinese kingdom to abandon one of their capital cities. Which kingdom had this unfortunate city been a part of?", "correct": "Jin", "options": ["Song Empire", "None of these - Genghis Khan never took another capital city.", "Hsi-Hsia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJin.\n\n\tThe Jin, first invaded in 1211, lost their central capital in 1214 (their eastern capital had fallen in 1212). The Jin fled to their southern capital, and finally fell in 1234 to a son of Genghis Khan. While Genghis Khan and his successors wanted very badly to conquer the prosperous Song Empire, no one managed to do it until Kublai Khan, Genghis's grandson, in 1279. Kublai founded the Yuan Dynasty, and China has never been disunited since. \n"}, {"text": "As Genghis Khan's reputation grew, his remaining neighbors grew anxious. One neighbor, the Shah of Khwarazm in central Asia (around modern-day Afghanistan), made a fatal mistake in 1218 as a result of this fear. What was it?", "correct": "He first executed a band of Mongol traders on suspicion of spying, and then killed the Mongol ambassadors sent to seek justice.", "options": ["In his haste to give tribute to the Mongols, he utterly lost their respect.", "He sent a long letter to Genghis Khan which asserted that he had no reason to fear bullies.", "He had a Mongol ambassador slain as a spy, and then ordered all Mongols within his domain to be slaughtered."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe first executed a band of Mongol traders on suspicion of spying, and then killed the Mongol ambassadors sent to seek justice.\n\n\tAlthough the traders probably really were spies, Genghis Khan had to respond to their execution - and when his ambassadors were executed as well, the insult to his sovereignty was more than he could accept. \n"}, {"text": "What happened because of the Khwarazm Shah's mistake?", "correct": "Khwarazm was brutally conquered, and more than twenty cities were utterly wiped out.", "options": ["Khwarazm suffered under trade sanctions imposed by the Mongols.", "Though more than twenty of its cities were utterly destroyed, Khwarazm itself remained free.", "An elite Mongol force assassinated the Khwarazm Shah and replaced him with a pro-Mongol."], "explanation": "\n\n\nKhwarazm was brutally conquered, and more than twenty cities were utterly wiped out.\n\n\tIt took the armies of Genghis Khan only a few years to conquer Khwarazm completely. The Khwarazm Shah fled to an island in the Caspian Sea while the Mongols destroyed such cities as Samarkand, Nishapur, Bokhara, and Herat. All Genghis had needed was an excuse to invade. \n"}, {"text": "The Mongol army was organized into units called tumens, which traveled separately but could converge into armies. How large an army was Genghis Khan able to assemble when all his tumens joined?", "correct": "100,000 horsemen", "options": ["25,000 horsemen", "50,000 horsemen", "1,000,000 horsemen"], "explanation": "\n\n\n100,000 horsemen.\n\n\tEach tumen consisted of 10,000 horsemen, each with four horses for remounts. Also part of the tumen were the families of the warriors, as well as the livestock necessary to feed such a throng. Moving through the countryside like a small city, the tumens were slow on the march (moving perhaps five miles in a day) but formidable in battle. \n"}, {"text": "As Genghis aged, he had to tackle the problem of succession and find some way of keeping his sons from killing each other after his death. Among how many sons did he divide his lands?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Five", "Two", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tThese sons were Jochi (d. 1227), Chaghatai (d. 1242), Ogodei (d. 1241), and Tolui (d. 1231) - although Jochi died before his father did, his sons received the lands that would have gone to him. Genghis's apportionment of the Mongol lands did not last long, but after a number of civil wars the four khanates were relatively stable. They were the Chaghataid Khanate in central Asia, the Ilkhanate in Persia, the Khanate of the Golden Horde in Russia, and the Khanate of the Great Khan (in what is now Mongolia and China), whose khan nominally ruled over the others. \n"}, {"text": "Which of his sons did Genghis pick as heir to his empire?", "correct": "Ogodei, the third son", "options": ["Tolui, the fourth son", "Jochi, the eldest", "Chaghatai, the second son"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOgodei, the third son.\n\n\tThe Mongols did not practice primogeniture - instead, the heir to the empire was picked by the previous Great Khan. Genghis was respected enough that, when he died in 1227, his choice was honored by all his family, and the system worked as it was supposed to - but every succession after that was marred by vicious civil wars between the various family houses. The sons of Tolui went so far as to wage a genocidal campaign against their own cousins, the descendants of Chaghatai and Ogodei. \n"}]}
