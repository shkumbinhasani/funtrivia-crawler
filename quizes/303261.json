{"id": "303261", "name": "Beanie Babies A-Z Quiz Series - Final Chapter 2  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Beanie Babies"], "questions": [{"text": "Perhaps one of my favorite Beanie Babies of all time falls under the letter \"K\".  His name is quite interesting, as some of his letters are capitalized that normally shouldn't be.  Which of these is a Borders exclusive?", "correct": "KnOWLedge", "options": ["KooWEE", "KangaROO", "KaleidosCOPe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKnOWLedge.\n\n\tKnOWLedge is a snowy owl, thus, the letters \"OWL\" in \"knowledge\" are capitalized.  He is a Borders exclusive, which means that he can only be bought at Borders, a book store chain second in size only to Barnes and Noble.\r \"Most every book that I embrace \rWill take me to a special place \rTales of knights or ladies fair \rPick up a book and join me there!\" \n"}, {"text": "My favorite \"L\" happens to be my third favorite breed of dog.

It is recommended that you groom them more than the average dog; it does not hurt them if you don't, but their coats won't be near as smooth and silky and poofy.  Bichon frise is pronounced \"bishawn frizzay.\"\r \"\"YIP,\" means I want to play with you \rWhen I say, \"YAP,\" I'm happy, too\r\"ARF,\" implies that this is fun\rAnd \"BARK\" is \"Join in everyone\"!\" \n"}, {"text": "Finally half way through the alphabet, but not quite half way through the Final Chapter series!  Moving on to \"M\", which of these is, yes, you guessed it, a puppy, that holds a Hershey's Kiss?", "correct": "Morsel", "options": ["Morgan", "Morray", "Morning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorsel.\n\n\tMorsel is a puppy that looks exactly like Bounds, Chaser, and Diggidy, except he is a light brown color and holds a Hershey's Kiss.  He is a Walgreen's exclusive, which, if you remember from KnOWLedge, means he can only be bought at Walgreen's!\r \"Here's a Morsel just for you\rA little tidbit that's sweet, too\rSo tempting that you can't resist\rDon't look now, but you've been kissed!\" \n"}, {"text": "You may faint from shock when I tell you that a picked a rabbit over a Siberian husky, but I did.  Which of these is a rabbit that starts with the letter \"N\"?", "correct": "Nibbly", "options": ["Nanook", "Nip", "Nutty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNibbly.\n\n\tNip is a golden colored cat, and Nutty is a squirrel.

What is it?", "correct": "Oats", "options": ["Oranges", "Oval Office", "Origami"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOats.\n\n\tOats is a horse who eats oats.  Common foods that horses eat are barley, wheat, and oats.

What is the name of this injured puppy?", "correct": "Pads", "options": ["Patti", "Prickles", "Peking"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPads.\n\n\tPrickles is a hedgehog, Patti is a platypus, and Peking is a panda bear.

In my opinion, it is cuter this way.  What is this duck's name?", "correct": "Quacker(s)", "options": ["Quacks", "Quacking", "Quackowackoramalamadingdong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuacker(s).\n\n\tQuackers was one of the very first Beanie Babies ever made, originally without wings, then named Quacker.  The S was added to the name by mistake, so they added wings to it so it would not be the same as Quacker.  They quickly became synonymous with each other, and, just like the names Tabasco and Snort, are interchanged between the one with and the one without wings.  Fortunately, there are no Beanie Babies named Quackowackoramalamadingdong.\r \"There is a duck by the name of Quackers\rEvery night he eats animal crackers\rHe swims in a lake that's clear and blue\rBut he'll come to the shore to be with you!\" \n"}, {"text": "My favorite \"R\" is rather quite interesting and unique.  It does not mention what animal it is, but rather, the scientific name for the family it is in.  This is because this family looks so similar between each species that you can make it whatever you want!  Who is this?", "correct": "Runner", "options": ["Racetrack", "Ringo (No, not Starr!)", "Ringwald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRunner.\n\n\tRunner is a mustelidae.

Members of the mustelidae family include minks, mongoose, weasels, and ferrets!\r \"A ferret, mongoose, weasel or mink \rWhat am I...what do you think? \rFind a book, look and see \rI'm whatever you want me to be!\" \n"}, {"text": "My favorite \"S\" is an animal similar to my favorite \"R\", but stands on all fours instead of just two.  Which of these is another mustelidae, the animal who appeared in the \"R\" question as well?", "correct": "Shiloh", "options": ["Spectacular", "Summit", "Snowdrop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShiloh.\n\n\tI had an extremely difficult time figuring out my favorite \"S\" Beanie Baby.  Snowdrop looks EXACTLY like KnOWLedge, one of my all-time favorite Beanie Babies.  Summit is similar, but he has a lot silkier of a chest.  I learned by making this quiz that I like black footed ferrets more than snowy owls!  Shiloh is a black footed ferret.  Shiloh comes with no poem. \n"}, {"text": "Moving on to the letter \"T\", I found a Beanie Baby I like even more than the letter \"K\" and the letter \"S\"!  Which of these is a lynx?", "correct": "Tracks", "options": ["Tigerlily", "Tracker", "Tyger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTracks.\n\n\tTracker is a basset hound, Tyger is Yorkshire terrier puppy, and Tigerlily does not exist.
