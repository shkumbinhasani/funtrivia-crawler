Jerry thought it over in his head and decided that it really shouldn't matter if he walked over and consoled her or not.

She decides to invite the Korean manicurists to the opening of \"Rochelle Rochelle\" to see Bette Midler perform as an apology and Jerry goes to see Gennice. Gennice gets a telegram saying that her grandmother has just died and she doesn't think anything of it.  Jerry finds this odd since she cries over everything else, so they don't see each other again. The Korean manicurists find out that Bette isn't performing, so they continue to ban Elaine, and Gennice messes up on stage because her shoelace is untied, so she cries. \n"}]}
