{"id": "355019", "name": "Halo: Combat Evolved Quiz | Halo: Combat Evolved | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Halo Games", "Halo: Combat Evolved"], "questions": [{"text": "The player's first sighting of Master Chief occurs on which spacecraft?", "correct": "The Pillar of Autumn", "options": ["Spirit of Fire", "Dawn Under Heaven", "Commonwealth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Pillar of Autumn.\n\n\tThe game commences with the Master Chief awakening from cryosleep aboard the under-attack Pillar of Autumn and the entire first level consists of traveling through the ship fighting off Covenant forces on your way to the escape pods.  Unfortunately, the Pillar of Autumn comes crashing down; the player revisits it, crashed on the surface of the Halo, in the tenth and final level of the game known as \"The Maw\".  The Pillar of Autumn was commissioned by the United Nations Space Command and sent through space to draw Covenant forces away from the home planet, Earth. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these human weapons holds the least amount of ammo at any given time?", "correct": "SPNKr Rocket Launcher", "options": ["MA5B Assault Rifle", "M6D Pistol", "M90 Shotgun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSPNKr Rocket Launcher.\n\n\tThe Rocket Launcher is one of the strongest weapons to be found in the game; a human creation, this high-powered shot explodes on contact and can bring down enemy vehicles much easier than if you were to use a regular gun.  On the same token, the launcher can only contain two rockets at one time, so even if you have ammo stockpiled you'll need to reload frequently.  Other human weapons include the small M6D Pistol, the standard MA5B Assault Rifle, the rarer M90 Shotgun, and the 10x aim S2 Sniper Rifle.  These weapons are only used by human forces and some enemies of the Flood. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Covenant weapons is unusable in \"Halo\"?", "correct": "Energy Sword", "options": ["Needler", "Plasma Pistol", "Plasma Rifle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEnergy Sword.\n\n\tAlthough Elite Covenant units can use the Energy Sword, it is not usable by Spartans or human characters until the second game in the series.  The same can be said for the Fuel Rod Gun (at least in the campaign) which is typically carried by Hunters.  The Covenant guns you can use in this game are the Plasma Pistol, Plasma Rifle, and Needler.  The selection broadens in the second game in the series.\rAlthough the Needler has ammo you can pick up from the ground and fallen enemies, the Plasma Pistol and Rifle have built-in battery packs; you need to replace the gun to get new ammo. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following grenade types can stick to enemies?", "correct": "Plasma Grenades", "options": ["Fragmentation Grenades", "All of these options", "Timed Grenades"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlasma Grenades.\n\n\tThere are only two types of grenades in this game, Fragmentation Grenades and Plasma Grenades.  You can only carry four of each type at any given time.  Frag Grenades are human-made.  When you toss one it will bounce around as it is like a regular grenade.  This can be a bit tricky for aim, especially since the explosion is close-range.  The Covenant-made Plasma Grenades are a bit more fun-- these can stick to walls or enemies and cause carnage, especially if you're attacking a moving target.  Only the Flood and human casualties will drop Frags; Covenant drop Plasmas. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Covenant forces typically carries a plasma shield?", "correct": "Jackal", "options": ["Hunter", "Grunt", "Elite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJackal.\n\n\tThese four enemies are the bulk of Covenant forces in the game.  Grunts, the smallest, are often disposable and carry smaller weapons (Plasma Pistols and Needlers); they also appear in greater numbers.  Jackals use Plasma Rifles and shoot from behind plasma shields (which can be broken!).  Elites are human-sized and attack with a variety of weapons, occasionally in close range.  Hunters are bulky Covenant forces with powerful guns, few weak points, and excessive amounts of body armor.  They are, of course, at war with humankind; take care not to trust them. \n"}, {"text": "The Flood first appear in what campaign level?", "correct": "343 Guilty Spark", "options": ["Truth and Reconciliation", "The Betrayal", "Keyes"], "explanation": "\n\n\n343 Guilty Spark.\n\n\tThe first half of the game consists entirely of traveling along the Halo rescuing Captain Keyes and determining the origins and purpose of the Halo itself.  When Master Chief and co. head to an underground facility in the sixth stage of the game, 343 Guilty Spark (named after an AI device), they unearth a race of parasites, The Flood, who can infect and spread through any lifeform.  The remainder of the game is a race to prevent The Flood from escaping, first by using the Halo to destroy them and then, upon discovering the purpose of the Halo, destroying it instead. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these vehicles is human-made?", "correct": "Scorpion", "options": ["Banshee", "Wraith", "Ghost"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScorpion.\n\n\tThe Scorpion is also known as the M808B Main Battle Tank and it's capable of holding one driver and four soldiers on its sides, one for each corner.  This makes it the playable vehicle with the largest capacity; it's followed by the human-made Warthog which contains a driver, a passenger, and a gunner in the back on either a machine gun or single-blast turret. The Covenant actually use more vehicles; the Ghost is a single-unit device with front-shooting guns; it's the fastest land vehicle in the game.  The Wraith is an unplayable tank (at least in this game) which shoots a high-powered plasma blast. The Banshee is an air unit with turrets and a single-shot blast which takes time to recharge. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of the game, Master Chief and Cortana are able to destroy the Halo.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn the end of the final level, The Maw, Master Chief heads to the Pillar of Autumn to activate a self-destruct sequence which would rupture the Halo, destroying it and all of the Flood and preventing it from acting as a super-weapon designed to wipe out all life in the galaxy.  After a climactic final race off the ring, Master Chief escapes in a ship and heads out into space alone (well...with Cortana).  In the next game, however, he discovers that there's more than one Halo out there. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these multiplayer stages does not appear in \"Halo\"?", "correct": "Headlong", "options": ["Blood Gulch", "Sidewinder", "Battle Creek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeadlong.\n\n\tAside from the single player campaign, \"Halo\" boasts a good deal of multiplayer split-screen or online co-op (though the online version is long-defunct).  Allowing for up to four players on the same console, it's the perfect opportunity to shoot 'em up or capture flags for a victory.  Many maps feature an array of guns and power-ups; some even include vehicles.\rBlood Gulch reappears, remade, in the multiplayer section of \"Halo 2\" under the name 'Coagulation'.  Battle Creek also reappears as 'Beaver Creek'.  Headlong debuted in \"Halo 2\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of these items/weapons can only be found in the multiplayer PC version of \"Halo\"?", "correct": "Flamethrower", "options": ["Battle Rifle", "Overshield", "Active Camo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlamethrower.\n\n\tAlthough online multiplayer of the original \"Halo\" was taken offline many years ago, the PC version allowed for two unique guns not featured in the original campaign, the Flamethrower and the Fuel Rod Gun (used by Covenant Hunters).  The Flamethrower was best used in close-range combat while the Fuel Rod Gun shot large blasts of plasma at enemies near and far.  Aside from these, the games also sported Overshields for extra protection, Active Camo for stealth, an entire arsenal of weapons, and vehicles from Ghosts to Warthogs for teams and individual play. \n"}]}
