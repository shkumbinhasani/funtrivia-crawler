What are the best things from the list to add to a traditional stir fry?", "correct": "Vegetables", "options": ["Cheasecake", "Cheese and milk", "Anything with a high sugar content"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVegetables.\n\n\tStir fries are traditionally some type of meat or pasta and lots of veggies. Take the leftover pasta, toss it in a large pan with whatever veggies you have laying around and fry in some type of oil until the veggies are cooked. Instead stir fry! \n"}, {"text": "What product would best be used to make croutons?", "correct": "Day-old French bread", "options": ["Moldy cheese", "Fresh wheat bread", "Week-old pizza crust"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDay-old French bread.\n\n\tDay-old French bread is perfect for crouton making, especially if it was left in the air to get stale.

Mix eggs, milk, mozzarella cheese, onion, butter, garlic, oregano, and salt together in a large bowl; pour over pizza pieces. Pop it in the over for about 30 minutes.\r The other three dishes require massively changing the pizza into something different, and then cooking with it again. \n"}, {"text": "Hmm, I have leftover rice and chicken. Using only water and some spices what can I make? ", "correct": "Soup", "options": ["Pie", "Chicken pancakes", "Lemon rice potato cakes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSoup.\n\n\tAmong the options provided, chicken soup is the easiest of the dishes to prepare, and the only that can be gotten to with just water and spices on top of those leftover ingredients.

But anyone who likes both spaghetti and pork chops can use leftover chops to make the meatsauce for a spaghetti dish. I first tried this dish when I was about 13 and have had it every few months since. Literally just substitute the pork chops (cut into strips or cubes) for the more traditional hamburger or sausage. \n"}, {"text": "Let's make a tasty dessert.
