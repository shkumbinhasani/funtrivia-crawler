{"id": "343772", "name": "Six for Sunday Dinner Quiz / Test | 0-10 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "0-10", "6"], "questions": [{"text": "The doorbell rang promptly at 5:00pm, an hour earlier than I anticipated 'six's' arrival.  Asking 'six' to come inside, I graciously held the door.\n\"That's a lovely three-piece suit,\" I said, trying to compliment my guest.  It didn't go too well; 'six' doesn't like the other numbers very much.\n\nWhich of these is not typically part of a three-piece suit?", "correct": "Shoes", "options": ["Trousers", "Waistcoat", "Jacket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShoes.\n\n\tWhile not always in fashion, the three-piece suit is a wardrobe selection consisting of a matching jacket and trouser combination (which one would typically refer to as the two-piece suit) as well as a waist coat worn under the jacket.  The waist coast was introduced into wardrobes in the seventeenth century and has been worn by both men and women ever since.  You may remember that John Travolta wore one in \"Saturday Night Fever\" back in 1977.\r Speaking of Saturday night, I should've picked it instead of Sunday to hold the dinner.  Sunday is commonly regarded as either the first or last day of the week (the first or the seventh).  It's not the sixth.  Well, that was dumb of me. \n"}, {"text": "I took the liberty of showing 'six' around my cozy abode.\n\"It's nothing big,\" I said. \"It could comfortably fit a family in here.  Would you like to take a seat?\"\nI pointed at the loveseat and he scoffed at the furniture.\n\nHow many people are normally meant to fit on a loveseat?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Four", "Five", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tAlso called a two-seater, the loveseat is traditionally a shorter couch consisting of only two cushions.  Because the couch is a more intimate setting for a couple, the word 'love' is added to the equation.  Couches or sofas can normally seat more than one person, so a loveseat would fall into that category, but a seat for six?  That's a tall order.\r So what?  Does he want the whole sectional to himself?  A sectional is a couch split into two parts in order to fit into a corner.  These usually consist of four or more seats. \n"}, {"text": "'Six' looked at my movie selection in what seemed like disgust.  It wasn't until I checked later that I realized 'six' didn't like a specific Brad Pitt/Morgan Freeman movie on my shelf.\n\nWhich one of these was likely the responsible for 'Six's' distaste?", "correct": "Se7en", "options": ["Thr3e", "8ight", "4our"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSe7en.\n\n\t\"Se7en\", released in 1995, was the second film directed by David Fincher who would later be known for \"The Social Network\", \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\", and the American remake of \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\".  It earned over $300,000,000 in the box office and became one of the year's top-grossing movies.  Considered a classic in the thriller genre, it starred Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey.  The movie followed two cops solving a serial killing based on the seven deadly sins.\r Unsurprisingly, 'six' asked me if I had a copy of M. Night Shyamalan's \"The Sixth Sense\".  This is when I noticed a particular trend in 'six's' interests... \n"}, {"text": "\"What are these trophies for?\" 'Six' looked at a cabinet on my wall; surprisingly there were six of them inside.\n\"Bowling,\" I responded.\n\"Six-pin?\" 'six' asked.\nI could see it in 'six's' face before I even mentioned that there were more than six pins.\n\nHow many pins are used in Duckpin Bowling?", "correct": "Ten", "options": ["Nine", "Twelve", "Thirteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTen.\n\n\tBowling, as many know, is a game played in lanes with heavy balls and a set of pins at the opposite end of the straight path.  The goal is to knock them down as effectively as possible.  While ten-pin bowling is the most common in the United States, other countries (like Canada) play five-pin bowling with smaller bowling balls or (like European nations) nine-pin bowling.  Duckpin Bowling uses shorter, fatter pins and smaller balls, but more throws down the lane.  It's otherwise very similar to ten-pin bowling.\rAnd who's ever heard of six-pin bowling anyways?  'Six' really needs to get with the game. \n"}, {"text": "I decided it was time to cut my losses and move directly to dinner, so I brought 'six' to the dining room.  What was silly is I'd planned a seating arrangement around nine people.\n\nWhen is a group of nine people referred to as a 'nonet'?", "correct": "When they're all musicians", "options": ["When they're all siblings", "When they're are actually sheep, not people", "When they're royalty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen they're all musicians.\n\n\tWhile a group of seven would be a septet and a group of eight would be an octet, a group of nine people would simply be called 'a nine'.  This pattern continues; a group of ten is simply 'a ten'.\rA 'nonet', however, still functions as a term when used to describe a collective of nine musicians.  Likewise, nonet is a literary term used to describe the amount of lines in a work of poetry (similar terms include sestet, octet, etc.).  Hooray for quantification!\r Sure, I'd only planned for 'six' to join me but no anger should be necessary if my dining room is suited towards larger groups.  Perhaps a sextet next time? \n"}, {"text": "\"Can I get you a drink?\" I asked.  I regretted it soon after.\n\"How about some soda?\" Six replied and looked at me.  Somehow he knew that I only had one brand.\n\nWhich of these would've been the only choice I had to offer?", "correct": "7-Up", "options": ["4-Down", "9-Across", "3-Plus"], "explanation": "\n\n\n7-Up.\n\n\t7-Up is a brand associated with Pepsi (along with Dr. Pepper, Canada Dry, and Snapple) and it's characterized by a lemon-lime flavour, much like its Coca-Cola-brand equivalent, Sprite.  As is to be expected of soft drinks, 7-Up has had many variations over the decades, some of which involve odd combinations like Cherry 7-Up, Orange 7-Up, and dNL, which was a lime-lemon flavour loaded with extra caffeine.  dNL didn't do too well and didn't last long in the energy craze of the mid-2000s.  Oddly, 7-Up first hit store shelves mere days before the Great Depression struck...though it clearly survived.\r 'Six' would have to settle for water it seemed. \n"}, {"text": "Dinner was served soon after I got 'six' a drink; we had calamari.  I noticed that 'six' didn't really like the meal.  Too much food, apparently.\n\nA squid has two tentacles, but how many other arms does it have?", "correct": "Eight", "options": ["Ten", "Nine", "Eleven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight.\n\n\tSquid, the main ingredient of calamari, is an underwater creature with ten appendages-- two are tentacles and eight are arms-- and one can grow to colossal sizes!  Fried squid, or calamari, was a dish originating in Southern Europe though its popularity expanded to Asia as well, particularly because of an abundance of seafood in East Asia.  Fried calamari rings may be the most popular; squid is fried for a short time and served as an appetizer.\r If 'six' was thinking about only eating six-legged creatures, I neither knew how to prepare insects nor did I want to.  Just grin and bear it! \n"}, {"text": "I offered some 'petit fours' to the guest and was immediately turned away.  'Fours' isn't even English in this case!\n\nWhich of these would be considered 'un petit four'?", "correct": "A puff pastry", "options": ["A cut of beef", "A cup of tea", "A mint"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA puff pastry.\n\n\t'Un petit four' is French for 'a small oven'.  While the plan is never really to serve someone an entire oven, the name refers to a small after-dinner treat, somewhat like a dessert.  It can come in the form of a small pastry or a light biscuits.  The name comes from the small ovens used to make them hundreds of years ago.  It has nothing to do with the number four.\r My suggestion for 'six': loosen up and take the stinkin' pastry.  There was only so much catering I was willing to do for this number. \n"}, {"text": "I left a back-up dessert (always a smart idea), a cake, to bake a bit longer in the oven and decided that it was only polite to offer coffee to my guest.\nBefore I could bite my tongue, I asked \"one cream, or two?\".  I could feel 'six's' piercing glare through the wall.\n\nIf you were to purchase a 'double-double' from a Canadian coffee shop, how many teaspoons of cream would you receive?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Four", "None; there is no cream in a 'double double'", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tA double-double, made popular by the Tim Hortons coffee shops scattered across Canada, is a coffee containing two teaspoons of cream and two of sugar.  In 2010, Tim Hortons spread worldwide and while upwards of three thousand franchise locations can be found in Canada alone, they can also be found in the United States and overseas.  More than half of all of the coffee in Canada is sold by Tim Hortons locations.\rIf a double-double is too strong for you, you may consider a triple-triple; three teaspoons of cream and sugar.\r If I were to make 'six' a coffee with six of each, the drink would be more cream and sugar than coffee.  Give me a break! \n"}, {"text": "The clock struck 7:00 in the other room and at the same time, the fire alarm started to sound.  The cake!  I rushed to the kitchen and found that the oven was on fire.  'Six' decided to leave; the fire department decided to visit.\n\nWhat criteria determines if a blaze is a 'Five-Alarm Fire'?", "correct": "The number of units sent to stop the fire", "options": ["The amount of fire alarms pulled at the scene", "The height of the flames", "The extent of the damages"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe number of units sent to stop the fire.\n\n\tThe alarm system depends entirely on the man-power and resources used to quell the blaze.  If several different fire engines and fighters are called to a scene, the alarm will be raised.  When different alarms are sounded, additional units are called; the first and second alarms usually sent out the largest amount of units while later alarms can require back-up from other firehouses.  A five-alarm fire, thus, is the most dangerous.\r The fire department put out the fire; presumably, 'six' departed because there is no such thing as a six-alarm fire.  Why wait, right? \n"}]}
