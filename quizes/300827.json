{"id": "300827", "name": "Kyle and Salami Play Co-Op 4 Quiz / Test | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Well Salami,\" Kyle began. \"I have to admit that you do play a fair amount of games, but if I may, I'd like to give you this one.\"\n\"Which is that?\" Salami asked.\n\"Well, it's kind of an obscure title. You play Danger Dan and Evo and you need to save Earth in the form of robo-animal hybrids.\"\n\"Sounds...weird- to say the least.\"\n\nWhat is the name of this game?", "correct": "Space Station Silicon Valley", "options": ["Wetrix", "Milo's Astro Lanes", "Iggy's Reckin' Balls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpace Station Silicon Valley.\n\n\tAlthough all four of these games are quite random titles for the Nintendo 64, only \"Space Station Silicon Valley\", a game of complete randomness in its own way, is the one starring Danger Dan and Eva. Having been sent to the space station they are required to stop it from crashing into Earth, and the only way to do this is by defeating, then inhabiting the bodies of the world's various animal/robot hybrids (a fox on wheels and booster mouse come to mind in early levels, but different environments call for different requirements). The game may have gained a cult following and been popular critically, but it wasn't too popular in terms of sales.The company responsible for \"Space Station Silicon Valley\" changed its name later on and eventually contributed to the world of gaming as Rockstar North, the creators of \"Manhunt\", \"Lemmings\", and \"Grand Theft Auto\". \n"}, {"text": "\"That sounds like a fun game, Kyle.  I will definitely have to try it, but I can't leave without giving you a game in return!\"\n\"Cool.  What game do you have in mind, Salami?\"\n\"Well, you have always wanted to try this series of a boy from the Pupanunu tribe.  He saves the tribe.  I think I accidentally bought two copies of this game, so you can have one!\"\n\"Thanks, Salami.  I can't think of what that one is right now.  What is that game again?\"\n\"You know, I will have to check.  I best be starting you with the first one.  I don't remember what that one is called.\"\n\nWhat is the first game called in the \"Tak\" series?", "correct": "Tak and the Power of Juju", "options": ["Tak and the Guardians of Gross", "Tak 2: Staff of Dreams", "Tak: The Great Juju Challenge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTak and the Power of Juju.\n\n\t\"Tak and the Power of Juju\" was released in 2003 as the first of the video game series.  It was unknown that Tak would be such a successful character.  It eventually led to the second in the series, that is, \"Tak 2: Staff of Dreams\".  This was released in 2004.  After even more success, \"Tak 3\" became a two player co-op game. \"Tak: The Great Juju Challenge\" was released as the third game in the series in 2005.  In 2008, the fourth of the series was released, \"Tak and the Guardians of Gross.\"  Both \"Tak\" and \"Tak 4\" are rated 3+, while \"Tak 2\" and \"Tak 3\" are rated E10+.  Hmmm, it makes you wonder why \"Tak 2 and 3\" are a bit more violent, doesn't it, Kyle?  Interestingly enough, this video game has even spawned an animated full length television series. \n"}, {"text": "\"I've got an idea, Salami,\" Kyle said. \"I have too much on my plate for games right now, so I'll get you to play one for me.\"\n\"Uh...\" Salami began.\n\"You don't need to ask questions,\" Kyle interrupted. \"Just know that I thank you for it.\"\n\"What's the game about?\"\n\"Well...onions...sometimes pellets...and I guess there's one space captain in there too.\"\n\nWhat game is Kyle lending to Salami?", "correct": "Pikmin", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPikmin.\n\n\t\"Pikmin\", released in North America in 2001, quickly became a title to reckon with on the Gamecube lineup. In terms of creativity and quaint cleverness, the game was all about it. The player controls Captain Olimar, who has accidentally crashed on a distant planet. When he lands he comes across odd creatures known as Pikmin which he must use (and control with a whistle) to recover all of the parts of his ship...some of which are quite important and some of which (like a massaging seat) aren't quite as necessary. Due to the game's unlikely popularity, \"Pikmin 2\" was released with numerous new features, a multiplayer option, and two new Pikmin. This sequel was released on the Gamecube in 2004.\rDue to the success of the games, Olimar became an unlockable character in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\". Using a unique style of fighting with Pikmin, Olimar is a drastic change from many characters in the game as he has a need to use his creatures at essentially all times. \n"}, {"text": "\"Kyle, you have always liked green.  You also like spy games and whatnot.  Correct?\"\n\"Sure, why not?  Green is a nice color, and spy games are fun.\"\n\"Well, I will lend you this game.  It is about Jade, who wears green lipstick and whatnot, who goes by the name 'Shauni.'  She must stop the Alpha Sections, who are also green.  This game is mostly green.\"\n\"Cool I will definitely have to try it.\"\n\"Yeah, and you can also collect pearls and whatnot.\"\n\"Salami?\"\n\"Yes, Kyle?\"\n\"Stop saying whatnot.\"\n\nWhat game are Kyle and Salami referring to this time?", "correct": "Beyond Good and Evil", "options": ["The Jaded Palace", "Green Bay Packers", "The Emerald City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeyond Good and Evil.\n\n\t\"Beyond Good and Evil\" is a PS2 game.  Jade and her uncle, who is a pig, Pey'J, must stop the Alpha Sections.  But when Pey'J is captured by the Alpha Sections, Jade must rescue Double H, or HH, and together, THEY must stop the Alpha Sections and save the Hillyans from total destruction.  The Alpha Sections are an organization that are evil, they rescue people, but for every one person they save, they capture ten. They make it seem like they are the good guys, and the IRIS network are what you need to worry about.  The IRIS, in which Jade is a member, need to stop the Alpha Sections before it is too late! \n"}, {"text": "\"Well Salami,\" Kyle began. \"I'd like to lend you the next game, but I don't want to have to lug over the peripherals.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Salami asked.\n\"Well, as much as \"Float On\" and \"Nine in the Afternoon\" would be great to rock out to right now, I just don't know if a four-drum set is the best to carry over for you.\"\n\nWhich music-based game is Kyle suggesting Salami play?", "correct": "Rock Band 2", "options": ["Guitar Hero III", "Rock Band AC/DC Track Pack", "Guitar Hero: World Tour"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRock Band 2.\n\n\tWhile all of the \"Rock Band\" titles and \"Guitar Hero: World Tour\" all come with the drum feature, \"Float On\" by Modest Mouse and \"Nine in the Afternoon\" by Panic at the Disco are exclusive to \"Rock Band's\" second installment across all platforms. Although many songs are understandably enjoyable and downloadable through the online marketplaces of the Xbox 360 and PS3, the two songs listed are part of the game's exclusive track listing and therefore do not need to be downloaded or purchased through a track pack for Wii or PS2.\rThe four-drum set bit notified in the question implies that it's an earlier drum set. After the release of \"Guitar Hero: World Tour\", drum sets were provided with cymbals, and the look of the drum set was changed. \n"}, {"text": "\"Kyle, you know what games I just love?\"\n\"Hmmm, you will either say Spyro, Crash, or Sly, won't you?\"\n\"You know me too well, Kyle.  You have often mentioned wanting to try these games...  Well, now is your chance.  I have a Spyro game here that I would like you to have.  It involves Sparx and his friends more than Spyro, but you never actually play Sparx.\"\n\"What?!\"\n\"What I am saying is that the game is about dragonflies.\"\n\nWhat game is Salami referring to?", "correct": "Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly", "options": ["Spyro: A Hero's Tale", "Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage", "Spyro: Year of the Dragon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpyro: Enter the Dragonfly.\n\n\t\"Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly\" is a side game, not part of the original Spyro trilogy.  \"Spyro the Dragon,\" \"Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage,\" and \"Spyro: Year of the Dragon\" are of the original trilogy.  In \"Enter the Dragonfly,\" Spyro must save the baby dragonflies.  They are found throughout all the levels, ten in each. You find them throughout the level, and to get them, you either complete side quests or minigames, or, if you find them out in the open, blow bubbles on them to capture them.  There are a total of 80 dragonflies, and you must capture them all to continue on to the final battle against Ripto. He tried capturing the dragonflies to make himself a dragonfly wing cape, but he broke his sceptor, scattering the dragonflies all over the dragon realms! \n"}, {"text": "\"Well Salami,\" Kyle said.  \"I want to give you a real treat, so I'll give you the Wii Zapper.\"\n\"Uh... no game?\" Salami asked, confused.\n\"Well, yes.  I'll give you the one that came with it.\"\n\nWhich game was originally released with the Wii Zapper (in North America)?", "correct": "Link's Crossbow Training", "options": ["Ghost Squad", "Gun", "Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLink's Crossbow Training.\n\n\tReleased one year after the release of the Wii console, \"Link's Crossbow Training\" was the first game made exclusively with the Wii Zapper in mind, though since it's debut, many other games including \"Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles\" and \"Call of Duty: World and War.\"  \"Link's Crossbow Training\" itself sold approximately three million units (along with Zappers\" in its first year of sales, and while there have been numerous knock-off brain guns on the market, the Zapper has proven most popular. \"Link's Crossbow Training\" follows the protagonists of the \"Legend of Zelda\" series through different exercises, all of which involve the crossbow function in some way, shape, or form. Although the game has been notably short, it excels in what it's meant to do: train players with the Zapper.  Its refined gameplay and mechanics make it ideal for anyone who needs the least bit of help, or those who want to hone their skills to be more than your average 'duck hunter.' \n"}, {"text": "\"Kyle, I am running out of games you might actually like,\" Salami said, a bit upset.\n\"That's ok, Salami.  I will try games I normally wouldn't pick for myself.\"\n\"Well, I mean, you might like this one, since it is a trivia game.  But it is simply a game show video game.  You like trivia, obviously.  So this game, hosted by a man named Alex, which revolves around knowledge of all sorts, would be a good game for you.\"\n\nWhat game show is Salami talking about, which was created by Merv Griffin?", "correct": "Jeopardy", "options": ["Wheel of Fortune", "Family Feud", "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeopardy.\n\n\t\"Jeopardy!\" is a long running TV game show from the 70s to the present.  It has been hosted by Alex Trebek for over 25 years.  The show has been made into several video games over the years on many different consoles.  The one Salami is talking about happens to be the 2004 PS2 version.  Now, \"Jeopardy!\" can even be played in the classroom with \"Classroom Jeopardy!\" or on the cell phone. \"Wheel of Fortune\" was also made by Merv Griffin, but does not revolve around trivia.  Besides, it is hosted by Pat Sajak, and not an Alex!  \"Family Feud\" has had many hosts, none of which have ever been named Alex. \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" als ohas never had a host who went by the name of Alex. \n"}, {"text": "\"That's it. I have one more for you,\" Kyle said.\n\"Go on...\" Salami urged.\n\"Well, if you're up for something different, pop this game into your PS2.\"\n\nThe name of which PS2 (and Wii) game, where a player character is a wolf, literally translates to 'Great God'?", "correct": "Okami", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOkami.\n\n\t\"Okami\", despite selling obscurely few copies during its initial run on the PS2, was a critically renowned game for its time. Released around the launch of the Playstation 3 console, the game uniquely combined Japanese art and storyline with strong gameplay techniques. When the game was re-released on the Wii in 2008, it was updated to use the Wii's motion-sensitive controls and it attracted a different console's crowd. In this case, the game quickly became one of the highest-scoring games (non-first-party) for the console.\rThe game bears many similarities to \"Twilight Princess\" in the \"Zelda\" series. For instance, both protagonists are wolves. The creator of \"Okami\" stated (regarding his game) that he was strongly influenced by the \"Zelda\" series. Despite this, the game is uniquely original and bears little physical resemblance. \n"}, {"text": "\"Well, I guess that's it,\" Salami said.\n\"Umm, Salami?  I don't mean to be rude, but I gave you 5 games, and you only gave me 4.  Would you mind giving me one last game?\"\n\"Oh, sure, Kyle.  I didn't realize that.  Take this game.  I have a few copies of it, plus the complete saga.\"\n\nWhich Lego game involves episode 1-3 of a certain movie made Lego, plus a bonus level of episode 4?", "correct": "Lego Star Wars I", "options": ["Lego Star Wars II", "Lego Batman", "Lego Indiana Jones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLego Star Wars I.\n\n\t\"Lego Star Wars\" was the first of the Lego video game series.  You can play several characters in each of these levels.  The story mode takes you through each movie of the first three \"Star Wars\" movies using the characters who were in the movie.  In Free Play, you can bring in any character you want.  For instance, you can play with Darth Maul in episode 2!  \"Lego Star Wars II\" was later added, about the 4-6 episodes. Eventually, these were put into one video game, called \"Lego Stars Wars: The Complete Saga.\"  The first game was changed a bit to make it more like the second.  \"Lego Indiana Jones\" came next in the Lego video game series. It follows the first three movies, but the fourth movie is not included in the game.  \"Lego Batman\" came later.  It follows all the Batman movies, and although it is an extremely popular game, it has not sold nearly as many as the \"Lego Star Wars\" I, II, or Complete Saga, or even the Indiana Jones. \n"}]}
