{"id": "116314", "name": "Daredevil Quiz for Experts |     Movies", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Daredevil"], "questions": [{"text": "Most superheroes are distinguished by their abilities, not by their disabilities. Daredevil, however, is different. What is his disability?", "correct": "He is blind.", "options": ["He is paralyzed from the waist down.", "He is deaf.", "He is tone-deaf."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is blind.\n\n\tDaredevil (Ben Affleck) was blinded as a 12-year-old. The driver of a truck, trying to avoid hitting the child, sideswiped a barrel of toxic substances instead; the resulting spray destroyed the boy's vision. Luckily for him, however, his remaining senses were sharpened - to the point that he can use his sense of hearing as a kind of radar, and can \"see\" someone by the sounds that falling raindrops make on their body. \n"}, {"text": "What is Daredevil's alter ego?", "correct": "Matt Murdock, \"the blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen.\"", "options": ["Scott Smith, \"the blind policeman from Queens.\"", "Matt Murdock, \"the deaf lawyer from Hell's Kitchen.\"", "Scott Smith, \"the paralyzed policeman from Harlem.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt Murdock, \"the blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen.\"\n\n\tAfter observing the nonchalance of the justice system regarding his father's murder, the 12-year-old Matt resolved to \"help those who no one else would.\" Thus, he becomes partner (with his best friend Franklin Nelson (Jon Favreau)) in a pro bono law practice by day, representing clients no one else cares about. When justice is not done in the courtroom (his sharpened sense of hearing allows him to hear the quickening heartbeat of a lying witness), he returns as Daredevil by night, to administer a rather more violent form of justice ... with no possible appeal. \n"}, {"text": "When Daredevil was still a child, his father was murdered by the man who would later become the Kingpin. Why?", "correct": "Daredevil's father, a boxer, refused to throw a fight.", "options": ["Daredevil's father, a banker, refused to hide Kingpin's assets from the IRS.", "Daredevil's father, a boxer, intervened in one of Kingpin's crimes.", "Daredevil's father, a firefighter, was unsuccessful in trying to save Kingpin's home."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaredevil's father, a boxer, refused to throw a fight.\n\n\tYoung Matt's father had once been a great boxer, but alcoholism ended his career and he became a dockworker and petty criminal working for the crimelord Fallon. Matt happened upon one of his father's \"side jobs\" while walking home from school; it was while he was running from this sight that he was blinded.The two of them promised each other that they would remake themselves and never give up; the elder Murdock began his boxing career anew, and Matt learned Braille and decided to go to law school. Told by Fenton to throw a match, Matt's father just could not let down his son; so he won it, and was murdered shortly thereafter by Wilson Fisk.(Fisk was then another petty employee of Fenton; years afterward he became the Kingpin, the citywide crime lord of New York.) \n"}, {"text": "How does the Kingpin \"sign\" his murders?", "correct": "He leaves a single red rose with the victim.", "options": ["He leaves a single red carnation with the victim.", "He writes his initials in flaming gasoline.", "He leaves a single playing card with the victim."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe leaves a single red rose with the victim.\n\n\tIt's Daredevil who writes his intials (DD) with gasoline, waiting for someone to discard a cigarette and set his signature ablaze. The Kingpin's signature is very important to the plot; it's how Daredevil realizes who was responsible for the death of his father. \n"}, {"text": "Unlike many superheroes, Daredevil is deeply religious. What is his faith?", "correct": "Roman Catholic", "options": ["Hindu", "Lutheran", "Jewish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoman Catholic.\n\n\tFriends with a priest named Father Everett (Derrick O'Connor), Daredevil goes to Confession regularly. His discussions with Father Everett regarding the morality of vigilante justice provide an ethical framework for the film, and a climactic battle in his cathedral is one of the most memorable moments of the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Of course, Daredevil falls in love over the course of the movie. The object of his affection is Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), the beautiful daughter of a billionaire lackey of Kingpin's. What impressive skill does Elektra demonstrate?", "correct": "Martial arts", "options": ["Pottery", "Interpretive dance", "Opera singing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartial arts.\n\n\tElektra's father, she tells Matt Murdock, \"didn't want [her] to be a victim.\" So he had her study with a different sensei every year since she was five years old. She and Matt fight - in a friendly sort of way - in a playground after he asks for her name, each impressing the other. \n"}, {"text": "Meanwhile - even as Daredevil is falling in love - a reporter is hounding the police, seeking to prove that Daredevil really exists - and trying to find out the hero's real identity. What's the name of this reporter, who finds his answers after bribing a city forensic assistant?", "correct": "Ben Urich", "options": ["Frankie Nelson", "Jose Quesada", "H. L. Mencken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen Urich.\n\n\tUrich, seldom seen without his cigarette (which he uses in one scene to light Daredevil's initials, giving the lie to the official police position that there is no proof the superhero even exists), ends up discovering Daredevil's identity as Matt Murdock - and deleting the resulting article, so that Daredevil will be able to continue his activities undisturbed. The actor, Joe Pantoliano, is known for his roles as Teddy in \"Memento\" and the treacherous Cypher in \"The Matrix.\" \n"}, {"text": "Halfway through the movie, Colin Farrell is introduced as Kingpin's assassin of choice. What is the name of his character, who \"can turn anything into a weapon\"?", "correct": "Bullseye", "options": ["King of Darts", "Fatal", "Hitman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBullseye.\n\n\tBullseye - who, disturbingly, has a bullseye literally carved into his forehead - can fling even playing cards, pencils, and paper clips with enough force to seriously injure or kill. It is he who kills Elektra's father, and he who is Daredevil's foe in the longest-running battle towards the end of the film. \n"}, {"text": "After they've fallen in love, Elektra gets Daredevil's alter ego a ticket to a ball. He goes, accompanied by his partner at work. What does Elektra wear?", "correct": "A low-cut silver dress.", "options": ["A high-collared black dress.", "A low-cut lavender dress.", "A high-collared red dress."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA low-cut silver dress.\n\n\tMatt Murdock's friend tells him \"I wish I could give you my eyes for tonight;\" Elektra, meanwhile, tells him that she simply wanted to look beautiful for him, even though he can't see her. The evening, however, ends unhappily with the murder of Elektra's father before her eyes - and her mistaken belief that Daredevil did it. \n"}, {"text": "The movie begins with a wounded Daredevil clinging to something high above the city. What is he holding onto?", "correct": "The steeple of the cathedral.", "options": ["A radio antenna.", "The fire escape for his rooftop apartment.", "A gargoyle on the roof of the cathedral."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe steeple of the cathedral.\n\n\tHe then attempts to rappel down inside the cathedral, but is too hurt to control his fall properly; found by Father Everett, his life (the first three-quarters of the movie) flashes before his eyes. His death scene is interrupted by the arrival of Bullseye, at which point Daredevil arises to do battle - thanks to a healthy mix of adrenaline and action-movie scriptwriting. It's an interesting device and an entertaining movie, although it's the goriest PG-13 I've ever seen. I hope you've enjoyed this quiz! \n"}]}
