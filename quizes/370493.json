Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Words for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "To put them in alphabetical order, in what order would you place apple, crayon, ball, dog?", "correct": "apple, ball, crayon, dog", "options": ["dog, apple, ball, crayon", "apple, dog, crayon, ball ", "ball, dog, crayon, apple"], "explanation": "\n\n\napple, ball, crayon, dog.\n\n\tTo figure out alphabetical order you look at the first letter. Then you go from A-Z so since apple starts with A it is first, the ball because B is next in the alphabet, then crayon because C is next in the alphabet, and then finally dog because D is the fourth letter of the alphabet. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes the letters that start the words you want to put in order aren't consecutive (that means one letter right after another). In what order do these words go: butterfly, elephant, helicopter, giraffe?  ", "correct": "butterfly, elephant, giraffe, helicopter", "options": ["helicopter, giraffe, elephant, butterfly", "butterfly, elephant, giraffe, helicopter ", "giraffe, butterfly, elephant, helicoptor", "elephant, butterfly, helicopter, giraffe "], "explanation": "\n\n\nbutterfly, elephant, giraffe, helicopter.\n\n\tThe same rule applies even when the letters are not consecutive. In this case the letters go a, B, c, d, E, f, G, H where the capital letters are the letters that start the words you need to put in alphabetical order. \n"}, {"text": "Now let's look at words who start with the same first letter. How would you put these words in alphabetical order: watch, worm, when, wild?", "correct": "watch, when, wild, worm", "options": ["worm, wild, when, watch", "watch, when, wild, worm ", "wild, worm, watch, when", "when, wild, watch, worm "], "explanation": "\n\n\nwatch, when, wild, worm.\n\n\tWhen the first letter is the same you look at the second letter of the alphabet.

How would you place these words in alphabetical order: paper, pan, pace, party?", "correct": "pace, pan, paper, party", "options": ["party, paper, pan, pace", "pace, pan, paper, party ", "paper, pan, pace, party", "pace, party, paper, pan "], "explanation": "\n\n\npace, pan, paper, party.\n\n\tThis time you have to look at the third letter and then follow the rules to put them in alphabetical order. This is the same no matter how many letters are the same at the start of a word. \n"}, {"text": "Suppose you want to alphabetize your books. You would usually do this by the author's last name, as a library might. What is the correct A,B,C order of the following authors: Roald Dahl, Dr. Seuss, Don Freeman, Judy Blume?", "correct": "Blume, Dahl, Freeman, Seuss", "options": ["Don, Dr, Judy, Roald", "Seuss, Freeman, Dahl, Blume", "Roald, Judy, Dr, Don"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlume, Dahl, Freeman, Seuss.\n\n\tRemember, we alphabetize by last names, so we would look at Blume, Dahl, Freeman and Seuss to figure out who came first, second, third and fourth. \rAll of these choices are real authors:\rRoald Dahl wrote \"Matilda\" and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" \rDr. Seuss wrote \"The Cat in the Hat\"\rDon Freemen wrote \"A Pocket for Corduroy\" \rJudy Blume wrote \"Superfudge\". \n"}, {"text": "Alphabetization works the same way for proper nouns such as places of locations.

Edinburgh is in Scotland. London is in England, and Tokyo is in Japan. \n"}, {"text": "If we want to put people in alphabetical order we normally would use the last name, but if we only know the first names we can put those in alphabetical order.

", "correct": "Bethany, Carolyn, Logan, Marten", "options": ["Logan, Marten, Bethany, Carolyn", "Marten, Logan, Carolyn, Bethany", "Carolyn, Logan, Marten, Bethany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBethany, Carolyn, Logan, Marten.\n\n\tAs you can see it does not matter what we are alphabetizing, the rules are always the same. We always start with A and end with Z. \n"}, {"text": "Which word from the choices below comes first alphabetically?", "correct": "olive", "options": ["queen ", "x-ray", "zebra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nolive.\n\n\tOlive would come first because that part of the alphabet goes: o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. Zebra would be last since z is the last letter of the alphabet. \n"}, {"text": "What two words would go in the middle alphabetically if you had the list: fielder, pitcher, catcher and hitter?", "correct": "fielder , hitter", "options": ["hitter, pitcher", "pitcher, catcher", "catcher, fielder "], "explanation": "\n\n\nfielder , hitter.\n\n\tThese are all  baseball terms.

If you have a lot  of items, such as books, CDs, DVDs, video games etc. knowing how to alphabetize can make it easier to find these items. I have hundreds of CDs which I have alphabetized, so I can easily find which CD I want when I want it. \n"}]}
