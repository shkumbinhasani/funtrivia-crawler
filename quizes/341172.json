{"id": "341172", "name": "\"Original Song\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of Rachel's follow-up to \"My Headband\"?", "correct": "Only Child", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly Child.\n\n\tAt Dalton Academy, Blaine bursts into the Warblers' room singing Maroon 5's \"Misery\" and everyone joins in on the number.  Kurt feels like the song is not only expected, but a bit dull.  At the end of the song, Blaine exclaims that it'll be their opener at Regionals.  Kurt speaks to him honestly; the group doesn't feel like the Warblers most of the time.  Because of the amount of solos Blaine gets, it feels like 'Blaine and the Pips'.  Been there, done that.\rAt McKinley, Rachel presents Finn with her second original song, a follow-up to \"My Headband\" about being an only child called \"Only Child\".  Finn says that it's better than \"My Headband\", but it's not really good enough for Regionals. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Warblers' mascot who passes away in this episode?", "correct": "Pavarotti", "options": ["Boccelli", "Charlotte", "Boyle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPavarotti.\n\n\tQuinn watches Rachel singing from the hall and concerns herself with her and Finn's business-- after all, without Finn she may never take home the prom queen crown.  Because they say you should keep your friends close but your enemies closer, Quinn decides to be Rachel Berry's new best friend to ensure that Finn doesn't stray away.\rKurt, while sitting in front of the mirror at home, whistles along with the Warblers' bird Pavarotti until his pet's whistling stops.  When he attends the next Warblers' meeting at the school, he wears all black and sings \"Blackbird\" by The Beatles, dedicating it to the deceased bird. \n"}, {"text": "New Directions receives a cease and desist letter from which band?", "correct": "My Chemical Romance", "options": ["Jimmy Eat World", "Queen", "Journey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Chemical Romance.\n\n\tWill has bad news for New Directions.  They've received a cease and desist letter from My Chemical Romance barring them from performing \"Sing!\" at Regionals.  Mercedes thinks it was Sue and Will tells her it was; he went to speak to her about it and she says she notified the band, the drummer of which she claims to have had an affair with many years ago.  She also notes that this is the preemptive strike for 'World War Sue' since Will took away her Cheerios.\rRachel takes this opportunity to bring up original songs again and while most of the group initially thinks to shoot the idea down, Quinn backs her.  Inevitably, everyone agrees to write their own original songs for contention at Regionals and Rachel and Quinn decide to band together. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the song that Santana writes for Sam?", "correct": "Trouty Mouth", "options": ["Squid Face", "Fish Eyes", "Salmon Lips"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrouty Mouth.\n\n\tBrittany tells Santana that she misses spending time with her; Santana's angry, however, because Brittany wants to be with Artie.  Their conversation is cut short by Sue, who insults them and watches as they open their lockers to a wall of dirt.  Brittany claims that she doesn't even remember putting the dirt in there.\rAt Dalton Academy, Blaine expresses his distaste for their Regionals setlist since he's the only one singing.  When they put it to a vote, the Warblers decide to open with a duet.  Another vote solidifies Kurt's voice singing alongside Blaine's for their opening number, much to his surprise.\rIn the choir room, Will hands out rhyming dictionaries and Santana stands up to perform her own original song, \"Trouty Mouth\", which is dedicated to Sam.  He stops her before the song ends in embarrassment. \n"}, {"text": "Puck writes a song dedicated to Lauren.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tPuck has also jumped the gun to write his own original song and it's dedicated to Lauren as a follow-up (and an apology) for when he sang \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" for Valentine's Day.  Picking up a guitar he sings \"Big Ass Heart\".  Although the song is a fun one for the group, it's put aside for Regionals-- they're looking for something a bit more epic.\rQuinn takes the opportunity to talk to Finn about prom night and suggests that they get elected as prom king and queen and begin their campaign after Regionals.  When he shows hesitation, Quinn gets aggressive.  Rachel overhears the entire conversation. \n"}, {"text": "According to Tina, Sue called the Ohio government posing as her in order to change her name to which of these?", "correct": "Tina Cohen-Loser", "options": ["Asian Glee Girl", "Tina Lose-At-Regionals", "Tina Arena"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTina Cohen-Loser.\n\n\tAt Dalton Academy, Kurt puts the finishing touches on a self-made casket for Pavarotti.  Blaine informs Kurt that he's chosen their opening number and Kurt asks why he chose him to sing the duet.  Blaine tells Kurt that he's been looking for him forever and when he sang \"Blackbird\", he had that moment where he realized how much he actually liked him.  At that moment, Blaine and Kurt have their first kiss.\rMercedes presents her original song back at McKinley and her offering, \"Hell to the No\" is an upbeat number that everyone enjoys.  Will, however, says that despite how good it is, it doesn't have the epic, identifiable quality they need.  He tells the kids that they need to get in touch with a side of them brought on by hurt as that's where the greatest songs come from.  The kids find this easy-- Sue's been taking extra efforts to harass them over the past week.  Getting some buzzwords written down, they set out to work on the perfect song. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Sue admit to doing before the competition?", "correct": "Forging the cease and desist letter", "options": ["Making room in the school for her impending trophy", "Letting the air out of Will's tires", "Spiking the school water supply"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForging the cease and desist letter.\n\n\tIn the auditorium, Rachel arrives late for her and Quinn's songwriting session.  Rachel asks for the truth about Quinn and Finn and she gets a response back; they've been going out together for several weeks.  Before long, the conversation becomes an argument and Quinn tells Rachel that she needs to grow out of her fantasy life because Finn is with Quinn and that's the way it's meant to be.  Rachel decides that she'd rather not write a song with Quinn and heads home to compose it on her own.\rSue seems chipper when she visits Will.  She admits to him that she forged the cease and desist and never slept with My Chemical Romance's drummer (she slept with the drummer of Jimmy Eat World instead).  She also says that her setlist is comprised of songs custom-tailored to the interests of the judges at Regionals. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these professions is not represented on the Regionals judging panel?", "correct": "School teacher", "options": ["TV personality", "Tea Party candidate", "Nun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSchool teacher.\n\n\tFinally, Regionals arrives and the judges are introduced.  On the panel this year are mainstay Rod Remington, Tea Party candidate Tammy-Jean Albertson, and former exotic dancer/now-Carmelite nun/author Sister Mary Constance.  As New Directions sits down in their seats, Aural Intensity, Sue's team, hits the stage with the song aimed at the judges, Sonseed's \"Jesus is my Friend\".  The blatant attempt at wooing the panel is fairly obvious and it seems to work for Tammy-Jean Albertson and the crowd.\rBackstage, the Warblers prepare for their number and Kurt is worried about his first solo in front of an audience.  Blaine assures him it'll be fine.  When they head to the stage, Kurt and Blaine duet to Hey Monday's \"Candles\".  The song proves to be a popular one with the audience as they give a standing ovation.  Immediately after, Blaine leads the group into their main number, P!nk's \"Raise Your Glass\", which gets the audience on their feet.  Overall it's a solid set. \n"}, {"text": "Which team wins the competition at Regionals?", "correct": "New Directions", "options": ["The Warblers", "Aural Intensity", "It's a tie again!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Directions.\n\n\tBackstage, before their performance, Rachel tells Finn that she means every word she sings in her song.  She takes to the stage to perform her solo, self-written number, \"Get It Right\", a song which showcases her true emotions and brings the audience to a standing ovation before she hits the last note.  After her performance, she introduces the club as they perform their main number, the group-written \"Loser Like Me\".  At the end of the song, Mike wheels a slushie machine onto the stage and the group aims their cups at the audience, showering them in confetti.\rThe judges take to their sequestered area and they discuss the performances.  While Ms. Albertson supports Aural Intensity hands-down, Sister Mary detests the obvious pandering claiming that she didn't even like pandering when she was a stripper.\rThe votes come in though, and the lieutenant governor's wife comes out to read the result.  After coming out drunk, she announces that the winner is none other than New Directions!  They grab their trophy in celebration as Sue walks over to the woman and punches her in the face. \n"}, {"text": "Which New Directions member wins the MVP Award handed out by Will?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Mercedes", "Finn", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tBlaine and Kurt head out to bury Pavarotti.  The two of them are disappointed about both the death and the loss at Regionals.  Nevertheless, things are okay.  The two of them got each other at the end of the day.  They hold hands as they depart.\rAt the choir room, Will gets a call from Holly Holliday congratulating the group on their Regionals win (from her vacation at a meditation retreat).  Will also congratulates their teamwork but announces that they will also be starting a new tradition.  After every competition they'll hand out an MVP Award.  By a unanimous decision, Rachel is rewarded with a gold star of her own.  She thanks them for making her feel special and they celebrate their victory, the last step on the road to Nationals. \n"}]}
