{"id": "190958", "name": "The Film History of Jessica Lange Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed L-R", "L - People Themed"], "questions": [{"text": "Jessica Lange first appeared in film in the late 1970s.  Which of these blockbuster films featured her first appearance?", "correct": "King Kong", "options": ["Star Trek: The Motion Picture", "Jaws", "The Towering Inferno"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKing Kong.\n\n\tJessica Lange took the role of the Fay Wray character in the 1976 remake of the 1933 horror classic 'King Kong'.  In this version (not nearly as good as the first, in my opinion), directed by John Guillermin and also featuring Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin, Jessica plays the helpless but beautiful Dwan, the object of the great beast's primal desire. \n"}, {"text": "Who directed Jessica Lange in her second film appearance, a little number called 'All That Jazz' from 1979?", "correct": "Bob Fosse", "options": ["Carl Reiner", "Norman Jewison", "Lindsay Anderson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob Fosse.\n\n\tBob Fosse, the Oscar-winning director of 'Cabaret', took a chance with the young Jessica Lange in this autobiographical film that also featured the acting talents of Roy Scheider and John Lithgow.  The choice paid off as Jessica delivered a sexy performance as Angelique (the angel of death), which helped revitalize her young career after the relatively unsuccessful (critically) 'King Kong'. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Hollywood big-shot actors starred opposite Jessica Lange in the 1981 remake of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice'?", "correct": "Jack Nicholson", "options": ["Dustin Hoffman", "Robert Redford", "Paul Newman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Nicholson.\n\n\tBased on the James Cain novel and David Mamet screenplay, 'Postman' was a well-acted film, considering the talents assembled, but not the biggest critical success of all time.  Lange played the role of the adulterous Cora, portrayed by Lana Turner in the original version from 1946. \n"}, {"text": "1982 was really Jessica Lange's year to sparkle.  She received an Best Supporting Actress Oscar that year for her role in which of these films?", "correct": "Tootsie", "options": ["The Best Little Girl in the World", "Sweet Dreams", "Country"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTootsie.\n\n\tIn 'Tootsie' Jessica shone as Julie Nichols, a nerve-wracked soap opera actress and single mom.  She played very well opposite Dustin Hoffman, regardless of his gender.  That year, she beat out several fine actresses, including Teri Garr, also nominated for her performance in 'Tootsie'. \n"}, {"text": "In 1982, Jessica Lange was also nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her performance in the biopic 'Frances'.  What was the last name of the actress she portrays in this dramatic tour de force?", "correct": "Farmer", "options": ["Hodgsen", "Sullivan", "Marx"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFarmer.\n\n\tThough the events of Frances Farmer's life have been disputed (including the supposed lobotomy she received at a mental institution), this in no way diminishes Lange's terrific performance in this film.  Lange portrays the 1930's Hollywood actress with a great sense of depth and nuance, and her acting nomination was well deserved.  Incidentally, Jessica Lange is one of only a handful of actors and actresses to be nominated for both a Supporting and Lead Acting Oscar in the same year (others include: Sigourney Weaver, Al Pacino, Emma Thompson and Holly Hunter). \n"}, {"text": "Which is not a true statement about Jessica Lange, in relation to the 1991 film remake of 'Cape Fear'?", "correct": "She was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role", "options": ["She reprises the role originally played by Polly Bergen", "She was directed by Martin Scorsese", "She appears as the onscreen wife of Nick Nolte"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.\n\n\tIn the original version from 1962, Polly Bergen played Peggy Bowden, wife of Sam Bowden (played by Gregory Peck).  In the 1991 version, Jessica Lange plays the role of Leigh Bowden, wife of Sam Bowden (portrayed by Nick Nolte).  Martin Scorsese directs this high-powered cast in the remake that saw Robert De Niro nominated for a Best Actor Oscar and relative newcomer Juliette Lewis nominated for a Supporting Actress Award.  Unfortunately, Lange was not recognized by the Academy for her performance in this film. \n"}, {"text": "Jessica Lange starred in two films in the early 1990s alongside Robert De Niro.  One was the aforementioned 'Cape Fear', but what was the other?", "correct": "Night and the City", "options": ["Everybody's All-American", "Men Don't Leave", "Music Box"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight and the City.\n\n\t'Night and the City' was an interesting, character driven drama directed by Irwin Winkler.  Alongside De Niro and Lange in this film appeared Eli Wallach, Alan King and Jack Warden.  It was a remake of the 1950 film noir of the same name, featuring Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney. \n"}, {"text": "Jessica's performance in the 1994 film 'Blue Sky' garnered the actress her first Oscar award for Best Lead Actress in a film.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tYou bet it did!  This was, of course, her second Oscar (after her Supporting Actress Oscar from Tootsie), but her first win in a leading role.  An interesting note about this film, it was completed in 1991 but not released to the big screen until 1994 as a result of the bankruptcy of Orion.  Thus, rather than going up against Jodie Foster for 'Silence of the Lambs', Lange was pitted against Foster for 'Nell'.  Apparently, the Academy liked 'Silence' better than 'Nell'. \n"}, {"text": "Which highly stylistic director worked alongside Jessica Lange in the 1999 art piece 'Titus'?", "correct": "Julie Taymor", "options": ["Richard Linklater", "Wes Anderson", "David Lynch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJulie Taymor.\n\n\tJulie Taymor of Broadway's 'Lion King' fame (and also the director of 'Frida') took her wonderful skills to the big screen for this eye-popping rendition of Shakespeare's 'Titus Andronicus'.  Jessica plays Tamora alongside Anthony Hopkin's Titus and Alan Cumming's sinister Saturninus.  This is not the film to watch if happy endings are your bag...but if you love a visual treat, I highly recommend it. \n"}, {"text": "In which film did Jessica Lange work with the bizarre and mercurial director Tim Burton?", "correct": "Big Fish", "options": ["Planet of the Apes", "Batman", "Nightmare Before Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig Fish.\n\n\tJessica Lange plays Sandra Bloom, mother of the Billy Crudup character Will Bloom, in this visually appealing piece from Tim Burton.  \r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try more of my quizzes in the future. \n"}]}
