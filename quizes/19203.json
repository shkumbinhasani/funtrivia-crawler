{"id": "19203", "name": "Quiz on the Elements | Chemistry | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Chemistry", "Mixed Elements"], "questions": [{"text": "The elements located in groups 3 through 12 of the periodic table are known as which of these?", "correct": "transition metals", "options": ["metalloids", "alkali metals", "halogens"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntransition metals.\n\n\tAs with all metals, the transition elements are both ductile and malleable, and conduct electricity and heat. The interesting thing about transition metals is that their valence electrons, or the electrons they use to combine with other elements, are present in more than one shell. This is the reason why they often exhibit several common oxidation states. \n"}, {"text": "What type of metals can explode if they are exposed to water?", "correct": "alkali metals", "options": ["metalloids", "alkaline earth metals", "transition metals"], "explanation": "\n\n\nalkali metals.\n\n"}, {"text": "The elements in group 17 of the periodic table are called halogens. What does this term mean?", "correct": "salt-forming", "options": ["smelly", "light-forming", "reactive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsalt-forming.\n\n"}, {"text": "Why are noble gases inert, for the most part?", "correct": "their outer shell of electrons is full", "options": ["they are gases", "they're stuck up", "they have variable oxidation states"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntheir outer shell of electrons is full.\n\n\tThese elements were considered to be inert gases until the 1960s, because their oxidation number of 0 prevents the noble gases from forming compounds readily. However, molecule-ions have been detected, either noble gas only compounds or noble gase-halogen compounds. \n"}, {"text": "What toxic element causes people exposed to it to develop garlic-like breath?", "correct": "tellurium", "options": ["xenon", "uranium", "vanadium"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntellurium.\n\n\tWorkmen exposed to as little as 0.01 mg/cubic meter of air, or less, develop \"tellurium breath,\" which has a garlic-like odor. \n"}, {"text": "What element was the bane of the airship Hindenburg?", "correct": "hydrogen", "options": ["oxygen", "helium", "chlorine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhydrogen.\n\n\tIn the 1930's, the US was the only producer of helium, which is lighter than air at standard temperatures and pressures. Germany had asked to purchase some for their fleet of airships, but the US was wary of what use they could put it to. Instead, Germany used hydrogen gas, which is lighter than helium, but highly reactive, as opposed to the basically inert helium. \n"}, {"text": "Five elements are either named for, or share names with, the eight major planets in our solar system. Name one of these elements.", "correct": "Mercury & Uranium & Neptunium & Phosphorus & Tellurium", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercury & Uranium & Neptunium & Phosphorus & Tellurium.\n\n\tTellurium is after the Latin word 'tellus', which means Earth. Phosphorus is after the Greek name for the morning star, which is actually the planet Venus. Uranium and Neptunium are named directly from the planets Uranus and Neptune. Both Mercury the planet and mercury the element were named for the Roman god. \n"}, {"text": "The village of Ytterby has given its name to several elements originally discovered there. In which country is it located?", "correct": "Sweden", "options": ["Norway", "Denmark", "Finland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSweden.\n\n\tThe mine in Ytterby, on the Swedish island of Resaro, was the source for yttrium, erbium and ytterbium, among others. \n"}, {"text": "What metal has the highest melting point?", "correct": "Tungsten", "options": ["Iron", "Platinum", "Copper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTungsten.\n\n\tTungsten is used as the filament in incandescent light bulbs. \n"}, {"text": "What element is the most abundant in Earth's atmosphere?", "correct": "Nitrogen", "options": ["Xenon", "Oxygen", "Hydrogen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNitrogen.\n\n\tIt composes 78 percent of the atmosphere at ground level (as N2). Oxygen, as O2, composes 21 percent. All other gases, elemental or compounds, compose the remaining 1 percent. \n"}]}
