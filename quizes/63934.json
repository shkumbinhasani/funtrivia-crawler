How much is in the case?", "correct": "$2,000,000", "options": ["$1,000,000", "$3,000,000", "$750,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$2,000,000.\n\n\tThe money is ostensibly to be presented by Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) to Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) as a token of their new partnership. \n"}, {"text": "Michael asks Fredo to show Senator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin) and several other guests 'a good time' while in Cuba. Fredo brings the crowd to what seems to be an underground nudie show, featuring a bound woman, a donkey, and a local man famous for being remarkably well-endowed. By what nickname is this man known?", "correct": "Superman", "options": ["Don Quixote", "El Cid", "Paul Bunyan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuperman.\n\n\tThe audience gasps when 'Superman' opens his robe. 'That's why they call him Superman,' muses Fredo. It is during this scene, by the way, that Michael learns -- thanks to a conversational slip-up by Fredo -- that his older brother betrayed him to Hyman Roth. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most powerful moments in the film -- and, some would say, in the whole of American cinema -- occurs when Michael gives Fredo the 'kiss of death' and states: 'I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!'  What time is it when this momentous proclamation is made?", "correct": "midnight", "options": ["7:00 PM", "noon", "It's never said"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmidnight.\n\n\tMichael and Fredo are at a New Year's Eve party during this exchange. The year 1959 is less than a minute old when Michael delivers this anguished message to his older brother. \n"}, {"text": "Flashing back to young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) in New York: which of his children is stricken with pneumonia?", "correct": "Fredo", "options": ["Connie", "Michael", "Sonny"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFredo.\n\n\tCarmella Corleone says, 'Poor little Fredo -- he's got pneumonia.' Connie was not yet born when this sequence took place...and given how young Fredo seemed to be, Michael might not have been born yet, either. \n"}, {"text": "Vito shoots Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) dead in the doorway of the Don's own home. How many times does Vito shoot Fanucci?", "correct": "three", "options": ["two", "one", "four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthree.\n\n\tVito puts one in Fanucci's heart, then one in his face. Fanucci drops to the floor and dies almost instantly after the second shot...but Vito, ever thorough, puts his gun in Fanucci's mouth and fires it one more time. That's three. \n"}, {"text": "Back in the present center, the Corleone family is in the spotlight of a congressional hearing on Mafia-related affairs. Who is the FIRST person called to testify before the bevy of congressmen?", "correct": "Willi Cicci", "options": ["Frank Pentangeli", "Al Neri", "Michael Corleone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilli Cicci.\n\n\tWilli Cicci (Joe Spinell) is the first person shown answering questions at the congressional hearings. Both Michael and Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) are later called as well.  Al Neri (Richard Bright), however, is never shown testifying. \n"}, {"text": "Here's one I didn't catch until listening to Coppola's commentary...but watching the scene, I can't see how I missed it for all these years. One of the congressmen seated near Senator Pat Geary is played by a contemporary of Francis Ford Coppola's. Who is it?", "correct": "Roger Corman", "options": ["Martin Scorsese", "John Cassavetes", "Paul Schrader"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoger Corman.\n\n\tCorman, the legendary B-film producer-director who mentored an impressive number of directors in the 1960's and 1970's (including Coppola), is credited as 'Senator No. 2 in Congressional Mafia Hearings.'  How I missed that the first 20 or 30 times I saw this film is beyond me.  (Don't tell anyone, okay?) \n"}, {"text": "After killing Don Fanucci, Viro Corleone becomes a Don himself. The first time we see him throw his new weight around is when he tries to keep a friend of his wife's from being evicted from her apartment. What is the main reason that the landlord wants to kick Signora Colombo (Saveria Mazzola) out of the apartment?", "correct": "She has a dog", "options": ["She refuses to have sex with him", "She is consistently late with the rent", "Her husband is a belligerent alcoholic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe has a dog.\n\n\tThe landlord initially rebuffs Vito's request, but once he noses around and learns who Vito really is, he falls all over himself to appease the new Don. \n"}, {"text": "Senator Pat Geary, now beholden to the Corleone family, delivers a brief statement defending Italian-Americans and Italian nationals just before he excuses himself from the congressional Mafia hearings. Which of the following historical figures does he NOT name in his bid to support the Italian people?", "correct": "Leonardo da Vinci", "options": ["Enrico Fermi", "Christopher Columbus", "He names all of these people"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonardo da Vinci.\n\n\tThat statement felt rather forced to me...and the chairman of the hearings seemed to share my sentiment, as he treated it with almost complete dismissal. \n"}, {"text": "We knew that Michael Corleone was a war hero from watching 'The Godfather,' but during his testimony at the congrssional hearings, he names one of the decorations that he earned during his World War II service. What medal does Michael mention having received?", "correct": "The Navy Cross", "options": ["The Purple Heart", "The Bronze Star", "The Silver Star"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Navy Cross.\n\n\tThe Navy Cross is second in precedence only to the Medal of Honor. We're never told in the film(s) exactly how Michael earned that medal, but the Navy Cross is awarded only to 'officers and enlisted personnel of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps who distinguish themselves by extraordinary heroism, not justifying the award of the Medal of Honor, in military operations against an armed enemy.' \n"}, {"text": "Frank Pentangeli, thanks to the machinations of Hyman Roth, thinks that the unsuccessful attempt on his life by the Rosato brothers was ordered by Michael Corleone, which seems to be why he agrees to testify against Michael in the congressional hearings. Michael gets Frank to reverse his decision just by bringing Frank's brother over from Sicily, and sitting next to him in the 'courtroom.' What is the name of Frank Pentangeli's brother?", "correct": "Vincenzo", "options": ["Paolo", "Antonio", "Roberto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVincenzo.\n\n\tThe chairman of the congressional hearings, upon hearing Frank reverse his testimony, somehow knows immediately to ask Michael to identify the man seated next to him -- clairvoyance if I ever saw it, since Frank never gives the slightest indication that said man is the reason for his reversal. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) -- Michael's attorney, Consiglieri, and adopted brother -- answers the congressman's question, identifying the man as Vincenzo Pentangeli, Frank's brother. \n"}, {"text": "In 'The Godfather' (1972), Francis Ford Coppola's infant daughter Sofia played Connie's son during the pivotal baptism scene. In 'The Godfather Part II,' another of his children played a role -- this time, one of Vito Corleone's children in a 'past' segment. Which Corleone child was played by young Roman Coppola?", "correct": "Sonny", "options": ["Fredo", "Michael", "Connie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSonny.\n\n\tRoman played Santino 'Sonny' Corleone in the 'latest' of the Vito Corleone segments.  He had (artificially) curly hair -- like James Caan -- and wore a sailor suit. \n"}, {"text": "Don Vito Corleone returns to Sicily late in the film, and one of his goals is to exact revenge on Don Francesco Ciccio, the man responsible for the deaths of his father, mother, and brother. Who introduces the adult Vito to Don Ciccio?", "correct": "Don Tommasino", "options": ["Peter Clemenza", "Giuseppe Genco", "Sal Tessio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon Tommasino.\n\n\tDon Tommasino (Mario Cotone) -- whom observant viewers will recognize as the man who would one day act as 'sponsor' to Michael during his exile to Sicily in 'The Godfather' -- clearly has close ties to the Corleone family.\r After Vito murders Don Ciccio, Tommasino is shot in the back during their escape, which is why he spends a good deal of 'The Godfather' in a wheelchair. Continuity -- ain't it fun? \n"}, {"text": "One of the most remarkable things about Robert De Niro's Oscar-winning performance as Don Corleone is that almost none of his dialogue was in English -- and De Niro didn't speak Italian before being cast in the movie! He does sneak in a few lines in English, though. Which of the following is NOT one of them?", "correct": "'I believe in America.'", "options": ["'Michael -- wave good-bye.'", "'I'm gonna take care of everything.'", "'I'm gonna make him an offer he don't refuse.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'I believe in America.'\n\n\tVito's first line in English, 'I'm gonna take care of everything,' is spoken to Tessio and Clemenza, when Vito proposes the plan to pay Don Fanucci less than was asked. The 'offer' line is also in reference to Fanucci, just before Vito presents him with the shorted amount of money. Vito's last line in the film is to his infant son Michael, as their train is leaving Corleone, Sicily.\r 'I believe in America' is the first line of dialogue in 'The Godfather,' and it is spoken -- in English -- by Bonasera, the mortician. \n"}, {"text": "Finish this quote from Michael, as he responds to Tom Hagen's accusation that he feels the need to 'wipe everyone out': 'I don't feel I have to wipe everyone out -- _____________________, that's all.'", "correct": "just my enemies & only my enemies", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\njust my enemies & only my enemies.\n\n\tThe actual quote is 'just my enemies,' but I thought I'd be nice and allow for 'only my enemies,' as well.  It's a fabulous line either way... and notice that Michael is eating an orange as he says it. \n"}, {"text": "The presence of oranges frequently acts as a harbinger of death in the 'Godfather' films. Which of the following scenarios is NOT accurate?", "correct": "Fredo eats an orange just before he gets into the rowboat where his life will end.", "options": ["Michael eats an orange as he is discussing the plan to kill Hyman Roth upon his return from Israel.", "All of these scenarios are accurate.", "Don Fanucci buys oranges just before he is shot dead by Vito Corleone."], "explanation": "\n\n\nFredo eats an orange just before he gets into the rowboat where his life will end.\n\n\tThere are a good dozen other 'oranges = death' moments in the three 'Godfather' films...but I made up the Fredo one.  No citrus in sight during that scene. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the last family member Fredo Corleone speaks to before he is murdered?", "correct": "his nephew, Anthony", "options": ["his sister, Connie", "his brother, Michael", "his mother, Carmella"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhis nephew, Anthony.\n\n\tFredo and Anthony were all set to go fishing together, but Connie calls out to Anthony and states that Michael wants to take his son to Reno immediately.

Apparently, Frank took Tom's words to heart. \n"}, {"text": "How, exactly, does Frank Pentangeli kill himself?", "correct": "He slits his wrists", "options": ["He hangs himself", "He overdoses on sedatives", "He shoots himself in the head"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe slits his wrists.\n\n\tThe FBI agents wonder why Pentangeli is taking so long in the bathtub, break down the bathroom door, and discover him dead in the tub, his wrists slit. \n"}, {"text": "There's a rather fascinating 'flashback' scene at the very end of the movie that hearkens back to the days -- and cast -- of 'The Godfather.'  Which character does NOT appear in this scene?", "correct": "Vito Corleone", "options": ["Carlo Rizzi", "Sal Tessio", "Sonny Corleone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVito Corleone.\n\n\tAt the set-up for the birthday party for Vito Corleone, we see all of the brothers -- Sonny (James Caan), Fredo, Tom, and Michael -- Sonny's friend Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), whom he introduces to Connie (Talia Shire) for the first time; and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda), who brings the cake. Despite Coppola's pleading, Marlon Brando simply refused to appear in 'The Godfather Part II,' even for just the one scene. \n"}]}
