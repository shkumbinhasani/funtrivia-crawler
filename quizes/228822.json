{"id": "228822", "name": "\"CSI\" Season 4, Part II of IV Quiz | CSI Series | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "CSI Series", "CSI: Las Vegas"], "questions": [{"text": "Episode 7, \"Invisible Evidence\", opens with an interesting conundrum.  As a member of the CSI team is testifying in court, it comes to light that a mistake in the processing of a knife found at the crime scene has rendered it inadmissible in the case against an accused murderer.  Which member of the team -- the one who discovered said evidence -- is in the witness box when this fact is revealed?", "correct": "Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan)", "options": ["Nick Stokes (George Eads)", "Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox)", "Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarrick Brown (Gary Dourdan).\n\n\tThe error was actually the fault of the uniformed officer who worked with Warrick at the crime scene.  As a result of said error, the knife that Warrick collected and processed winds up being reclassified as \"invisible\" to the jury. \n"}, {"text": "By the end of \"Invisible Evidence\", it is revealed that, had the \"inadmissible\" knife been allowed to stand as primary evidence, the wrong man would have been convicted, letting the true killer walk free.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe man originally accused of the murder of Rachel Lyford was completely innocent.  The real killer had planted the murder weapon in his car -- a fact that would never have been discovered if the CSI team hadn't been forced to re-open the case and look for entirely new evidence.  In other words, if the uniformed officer hadn't screwed up the original search warrant, Warrick Brown would have been partially responsible for sending the wrong man to jail and letting a murderer go free! \n"}, {"text": "\"Invisible Evidence\" marks the first appearance of Rory Atwater, the new Sheriff in town (literally).  Which character actor plays Sheriff Atwater?", "correct": "Xander Berkeley", "options": ["Romy Rosemont", "Skip O'Brien", "James Marshall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nXander Berkeley.\n\n\tBerkeley, possibly best known from the hit TV series \"24\", plays Rory Atwater, who apparently defeated the previous sheriff, Brian Mobely (Glenn Morshower), in an off-screen election. \n"}, {"text": "Episode 6, \"After the Show\", is centered around a killer who seems to be dangerously insane and intensely focused.  This killer winds up devoting the majority of his attention to a particular member of the CSI team, eventually agreeing only to speak to that one person.  Who is it?", "correct": "Catherine", "options": ["Sara", "Warrick", "Gil Grissom (William Petersen)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatherine.\n\n\tHoward Delhomme (Martin Donovan), a professional photographer who both works with and occasionally kills female models, seems to have a thing for beautiful women.  It's no surprise, then, that he fixates on Catherine Willows.  Once he lays eyes on her, Delhomme demands that she become his sole contact, much to the chagrin of Nick and Sara, who were originally assigned to handle the case all by themselves! \n"}, {"text": "At one point in \"After the Show\", the suspected killer expresses his thoughts by way of a written message while he is in police custody.  What is TRUE about this message?", "correct": "It is written in his own blood.", "options": ["Neither", "It is written in the ancient language of Aramaic.", "Both"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is written in his own blood.\n\n\tOnce he is left alone in an interrogation room, Howard Delhomme manages to pry free the metal edging of a table, slash open his own hand, and write \"I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone\" on the wall (in English) in his own blood.  Creepy! \n"}, {"text": "One of the victims in \"After the Show\" was not only murdered, but raped with a foreign object.  What object was used to violate said victim?", "correct": "a gun", "options": ["a vase", "a bottle", "a flashlight"], "explanation": "\n\n\na gun.\n\n\tHoward Delhomme raped model Julie Walters with his gun, a fact that was made evident when her cervical tissue was found on the gun sight of the firearm registered to Delhomme. \n"}, {"text": "In episode 9, \"Grissom Versus The Volcano\", the CSI team winds up investigating a man whose marital status is...different from the norm.

What is the profession of her husband, who is initially suspected of killing her?", "correct": "singer", "options": ["athlete", "doctor", "soldier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsinger.\n\n\tMyles Rueben (Randy J. Goodwin) is a highly successful singer; in fact, one of his most popular songs is called \"Amelia\", which he wrote in honor of his beloved wife.  (He had nothing to do with her death, by the way:  Amelia killed herself.) \n"}, {"text": "I was surprised to see that one of the suspects in the brutal murder being investigated in episode 10, \"Coming of Age\", was played by one of the former teen stars of \"Beverly Hills 90210\".

The truth is that Ashley and a couple of her schoolmates simply decided to murder an unpopular kid at their school.  There was no rape, and Ashley's brother was never even involved.\r Sara tells Ashley that she will do everything in her power to see that she is punished for what she has done.  Ashley:  \"Good luck. I dress up real nice -- couple barrettes, little lace collar, two dead parents.  I'll be the saddest little girl in the world.\"  BRRRRR! \n"}, {"text": "Episode 11, \"Eleven Angry Jurors\", is a classic \"locked room\" mystery.  One of the twelve members of a cranky, sequestered jury is found dead in the deliberation room.  According to the indefatigable Dr. Albert Robbins (Robert David Hall), the juror died from an acute allergic reaction that caused his throat to close up and cease supplying oxygen to the lungs -- in other words, anaphylactic shock.  What, exactly, set this man's allergies into fatal overdrive?", "correct": "a bee sting", "options": ["shellfish", "cat dander", "peanuts"], "explanation": "\n\n\na bee sting.\n\n\tFor a while, the CSI's are convinced that an exposure to peanut shells or peanut butter killed jury foreman Chris Gibbons...but that's all a red herring.

Which member of the team rocks the boat a bit by re-examining evidence originally collected by the head honcho?", "correct": "Nick", "options": ["Catherine", "Warrick", "Sara"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNick.\n\n\tNick worked the original case with Grissom, which is the only reason I can come up with to explain why Brass would ask Nick to re-open the case -- Brass is much closer to Catherine and Warrick, after all...and they're both \"senior\" CSI's, compared to Nick! \n"}, {"text": "Gil Grissom spends most of episode 12, \"Butterflied\", being uncharacteristically distracted (and even emotionally involved!) because the female murder victim he is investigating bears a strong physical resemblance to Catherine. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDebbie Marlin (Erinn Carter) looks a LOT like Sara Sidle; Catherine even says to Sara, \"If I didn't know better, I'd think it was you on that [autopsy] table\".  This resemblance, and Grissom's discomfort with it, gave the \"shippers\" (the fans who clamor for Grissom and Sara to indulge in a romantic relationship) quite a bit of grist for their mill! \n"}, {"text": "An ambitious robbery occurs in episode 13, \"Suckers\".
