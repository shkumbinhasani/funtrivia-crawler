The official line, however, is that she was a beautiful, devoted, and talented nun and entrepreneur, who made her mother's dairy prosper despite often giving away its produce; founded countless convents throughout Ireland; founded the 'double monastery' (for both monks and nuns); and went to great lengths to avoid marriage. Who is this remarkable woman, whose feast is celebrated on February 1?", "correct": "St. Brigid of Ireland", "options": ["St. Moira", "Our Lady of Limerick", "St. Ursula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Brigid of Ireland\n\n\tBrigid is said to have been born the illegitimate daughter of a pagan king in 423.

Immediately after she had sworn her vows, she was again made beautiful. \n"}, {"text": "February 3 is a good day to get tonsillitis: the saint celebrated on this day is the patron of illnesses of the throat.

Persecuted by the agents of the eastern Roman emperor, Blaise is said to have hidden in a cave where he tended to and healed the wild animals - perhaps he was the first veterinarian! Of course, he was eventually caught and martyred, but that's all in a day's work for an early bishop. \n"}, {"text": "February 9 might be a good day to have that cavity filled - it's the feast day of an aged deaconess, the patron of dentists.
