{"id": "287108", "name": "Nightmare on Quiz Street | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Which film franchise (from the following choices) is the first to have a movie set in outer space?", "correct": "Leprechaun", "options": ["Friday the 13th", "Child's Play", "Halloween"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeprechaun.\n\n\tThe 1997 film \"Leprechaun 4: In Space\" is the movie in question, taking Warwick Davis' titular character, his puns, and his cursed gold onto a spaceship and beyond to marry a space princess.  The movie is unbearably cheesy, filled with giant spider creatures, rather large leprechauns (paradoxical, I know), and more.  The first \"Leprechaun\" film featured Jennifer Aniston in her first starring role.  Released in 1992, the film was moderately successful, profiting in the box office and spawning many sequels (most of which were straight-to-video).\rJason Voorhees, on the other hand, was launched into space in 2002, marking the tenth film in the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise.  The film fared poorly in comparison to other films in the series, but also managed to draw in a profit.  The last act of the film sees Jason reincarnated, after being defeated by a rather flexible android; this time infused with metal,  Jason goes on a rampage, destroying most of the ship while the crew spouts one-liners and fights to survive.  The film was followed by \"Freddy vs. Jason\" in 2003, then a remake of the original film produced by Michael Bay. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the character killed in the famous \"Psycho\" shower scene?", "correct": "Marion", "options": ["Lila", "Melanie", "Janet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarion.\n\n\tIn perhaps one of the most defining moments of horror film history, Janet Leigh's character of the 1960 film, \"Psycho\", is killed by Norman Bates in her motel shower.  A plethora of intense close-up shots depicting Marion Crane's death brought this film into the history books, and while the film was nominated for Special Effects in the Academy Awards for that year, it lost out to \"Cleopatra\".  The movie, based on the Robert Bloch book of the same name, was followed by three sequels, one of which was directed by Norman Bates' actor, Anthony Perkins, and one of which was helmed by master horror director, Mick Garris (also known for many Stephen King adaptations such as \"Salem's Lot\" and the made-for-TV rendition of \"The Shining\").  All four films featured Anthony Perkins starring as the deranged Norman Bates. The Gus Van Sant remake of the film, released in 1998, starred Vince Vaughan as Norman Bates and Anne Heche as the ill-fated Marion Crane. \n"}, {"text": "The Japanese film 'Ju-On' has had numerous sequels in its home country.  In 2004, the movie was remade for American audiences.  What is its American name?", "correct": "The Grudge & Grudge", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Grudge & Grudge.\n\n\tStarring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr (in the American remake), \"The Grudge\" is based around the idea that when a soul is killed in a violent, brutal way, it seeks vengeance and will curse the location at which it is killed.  Following a tragic death, Karen, a social worker from America, is hired to help a family that has just moved into a house in Tokyo.  When those inside are seen by the spirit of the former owner's spirit, each one finds that they can't escape her wrath.  \"The Grudge\" was followed by two sequels; both of which continued where each left off.\r\"Ju-On\" has had five iterations in Japan and has continued to be a fairly successful film franchise.  The original two \"Ju-On\" films, both released in 2000 direct-to-video, were followed by three theatrical installments following their success in stores.  The first theatrical version (\"Ju-On: The Grudge\"), was released in 2003.  All five releases were directed by Takashi Shimizu, who also released the first two American versions. \n"}, {"text": "Which is not a film in Dario Argento's \"Three Mothers\" trilogy?", "correct": "Phenomena", "options": ["Mother of Tears", "Suspiria", "Inferno"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhenomena.\n\n\tAlthough \"Phenomena\" is an Argento classic, \"Suspiria\", \"Inferno\", and \"Mother of Tears\" are the trilogy of which is spoken.  The trilogy begins with \"Suspiria\" in 1977 and involves an evil witch in a German dance studio.  \"Inferno\", released in 1980, involves a brother and sister duo delving into the mystery of the Mother of Darkness.  \"Mother of Tears\", released in 2007, starred Dario's daughter as a student who must set out to defeat the final of the three mothers before she ends the world with her powers.\r\"Phenomena\" is an important film in itself, being the first to star a young Jennifer Connelly.  The film was produced in 1985 and also starred Donald Pleasance.\rAll four of these films under Argento's belt were also written by him. \n"}, {"text": "The 2008 American film \"The Eye\" starred Jessica Alba.  In which country was the original \"The Eye\" made?", "correct": "China", "options": ["Canada", "Japan", "Korea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChina.\n\n\tWritten and directed by brothers Danny and Oxide Pang in 2002, \"The Eye\" was a strikingly original feature about a woman, blind from a young age, who receives an eye transplant.  Despite the miracle of sight she begins to see horrible, supernatural images.  As it turns out, the deceased donor of her new sight organs could foresee prophecies of death, and now she can too.\r\"The Eye\" was followed by a number of sequels and both an Indian and American remake (the latter of which starred Jessica Alba).  The Pang Brothers are also known for their work on the Thai and American versions of \"Bangkok Dangerous\" and the 2007 American horror film, \"The Messengers\".\rWhile the American films \"Bangkok Dangerous\" and \"The Messengers\" reached Number 1 in the box office, their remake of \"The Eye\" became the duo's first American release to not top the chart; it came in second behind \"Hannah Montana's Best of Both Worlds\" 3D concert during its initial theatrical run. \n"}, {"text": "The made-for-television remake of \"The Shining\" was critically panned, but which well-known director filmed the original in 1980?", "correct": "Stanley Kubrick", "options": ["Mick Garris", "John Carpenter", "William Friedkin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStanley Kubrick.\n\n\t\"The Shining's\" author, Stephen King, was initially upset by Kubrick's work on the original version of the film.  The 1997 remake by Mick Garris (who also created the TV anthology \"Masters of Horror\") took the novel into greater consideration, covering themes and topics not found in the original film.  Mick Garris has also adapted numerous other Stephen King works including \"Desperation\", \"Riding the Bullet\", \"Sleepwalkers\", and \"The Stand\".  Despite being a well-established director in his field, he has also proven himself in writing, having created two episodes of \"Masters of Horror\" and the 1989 sequel to \"The Fly\".\rStanley Kubrick directed the original \"The Shining\", and although it didn't stay true to the author's work, it was critically acclaimed and has frequently appeared on IMDB's Top 250 films.  The film stars Jack Nicholson.\rJohn Carpenter, a well-known face in the horror genre as well, directed the adaptation of Stephen King's 1983 novel, \"Christine\". \n"}, {"text": "What was horror director Eli Roth's first feature film?", "correct": "Cabin Fever", "options": ["Hostel", "Cell", "Thanksgiving"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCabin Fever.\n\n\t\"Cabin Fever\" quickly became a lucrative venture for Eli Roth.  Having spent only 1.5 million on the actual film, Roth quickly earned thirty million in the box office.\rThe film centers around five friends who take a weekend to hang out at a cabin in the woods.  Unfortunately, a flesh-eating disease has polluted the waters nearby, and as some of their party begin to get sicker and sicker, they realize that everyone might be infected, and that everyone's at risk.  When the townspeople find out, they find themselves on the run.\rEli Roth later went on to film \"Hostel\" and \"Hostel: Part 2\" due to the success he had with the theatrical run of \"Cabin Fever\".  Both films became fairly popular.  \"Hostel\" earned eighty million and debuted at Number 1 in the box office while \"Part 2\" followed-up with thirty million, opening in sixth in its debut week. \n"}, {"text": "Lance Henriksen did not appear in which of these films?", "correct": "In the Mouth of Madness", "options": ["Pumpkinhead", "Alien Vs. Predator", "The Pit and the Pendulum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness.\n\n\tLance Henriksen, best-known possibly for his role in \"Aliens\" and \"Alien 3\", played the role of Bishop, the android, in both of those movies.  He later reprised the role of his human form in \"Alien Vs. Predator\", the mash-up of the two franchises, in which his character travelled to Antarctica to investigate subterranean ruins, occupied by Aliens hunted for sport by the Predators.  Ironically, they arrived at the site on the night of the hunt...which only happens once a century.\rHenriksen appeared in \"Pumpkinhead\" in 1989 as a main character (no, not Pumpkinhead) who summons a demon to kill some rowdy kids.  He also appeared in Stuart Gordon's \"The Pit and Pendulum\" in 1990 as the evil inquisitor, Torquemada.\rJohn Carpenter's \"In the Mouth of Madness\" originally starred Sam Neill.  It was released in 1995, but flopped at the box office. \n"}, {"text": "Which remake was released first?", "correct": "The Fog", "options": ["Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "Black Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fog.\n\n\tOriginally released in 1980 and directed by John Carpenter, \"The Fog\" is set on the American west coast in the town of Antonio Bay.  When a mysterious fog envelops the small fishing town, the residents find that there's something there killing them off.\rThe film was remade in 2005 (and directed by Rupert Wainwright, known for \"Stigmata\"), but it was critically panned.  It starred Maggie Grace, Selma Blair, and Tom Welling.\r\"Friday the 13th\" was remade and released in February 2009.  It was produced by Michael Bay, known for \"Transformers\".  \"Halloween\", also a John Carpenter original, was remade by Rob Zombie in 2007.  \"Black Christmas\", possibly the oldest of these four films (originally released in 1974), was also remade in 2006. \n"}, {"text": "Which film was not written or directed by Clive Barker?", "correct": "Wizard of Gore", "options": ["Lord of Illusions", "Candyman", "Hellraiser"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWizard of Gore.\n\n\tClive Barker is a popular name in the horror literature world.  Most well-known for his \"Books of Blood\" and \"The Hellbound Heart\", Barker brought movies into a much deeper level of gore and terror.  \"Hellraiser\", released in 1987 (and followed by numerous sequels), was based on Barker's novel, \"The Hellbound Heart\".  \"Candyman\", appearing in one of the many \"Book of Blood\" anthologies, was released in 1992 and starred Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd while \"Lord of Illusions\" was released in 1995 (though it wasn't quite as popular).  In 2008, Barker approved the screenplays for \"Midnight Meat Train\" (which was released after a limited run in theatres that year) and \"Book of Blood\", both from his first installation in the anthology.\r\"Wizard of Gore\" is synonymous with the horror genre as it features many scenes of unnecessary torture and gore.  It was released in 1970 while a remake was released by Dimension Extreme (starring Crispin Glover) in 2006. \n"}]}
