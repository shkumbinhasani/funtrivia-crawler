Long known as the hippie hangout of San Diego, this place boasts a Dog Beach and an annual Christmas parade of surfers.", "correct": "Ocean Beach", "options": ["Pacific Beach", "Imperial Beach", "Mission Beach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOcean Beach.\n\n\tOB, as locals call it, is eclectic- and proud of it! You can find everything from the OB People's Food Co-Op to In Harmony Herbs and Spices to The Green Store. \n"}, {"text": "Heading east on I-8, we come to Interstate 5 and head south. We exit on Highway 75 and cross a beautiful bridge. We now enter one of the most exclusive communities in San Diego. Where are we now?", "correct": "Coronado", "options": ["Fairbanks Ranch", "Del Mar", "La Jolla"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoronado.\n\n\tCoronado isn't really an island, it's a peninsula. The most famous landmark here is the Hotel Del Coronado. \n"}, {"text": "Going back to I-5, we continue heading south. We come to one of the largest cities in San Diego County, home to a vibrant Latino culture and to the Arco Olympic Training Center. Where are we now?", "correct": "Chula Vista", "options": ["National City", "Imperial Beach", "Nestor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChula Vista.\n\n\tChula Vista means \"beautiful view\" in Spanish. There are many great Mexican restaurants here. The Olympic center is located near Otay Lakes, a surprisingly quiet and peaceful place. \n"}, {"text": "We now continue south on I-5 to the Mexican border. On the Mexican side is the town of Tijuana. What town is on the US side?", "correct": "San Ysidro", "options": ["Spring Valley", "National City", "Chula Vista"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Ysidro.\n\n\tSan Ysidro is not a large town, especially compared to sprawling Tijuana.

Just past its junction with I-805, we come to a quiet community that, although urbanized, projects a rural atmosphere. Many backyards have horses, and a network of trails laces the community. Where are we?", "correct": "Bonita", "options": ["Spring Valley", "Lemon Grove", "Elfin Forest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonita.\n\n\tBonita is an anomaly- it is surrounded by the very urban cities and communities of Chula Vista, National City and San Diego, yet it retains its rural character. Homes here usually command a premium price. \n"}, {"text": "We continue on the 54 to its junction with Highway 94 and continue eastward. We come to a small town whose main attraction is Simpson's Nursery- many acres of plants, a small petting zoo, antique car museums, picnic grounds and more. It's hard to believe that you are less than 25 miles from downtown San Diego! Where are you?", "correct": "Jamul", "options": ["Alpine", "Descanso", "Guatay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJamul.\n\n\tI live in Jamul. It's the closest rural area to the City of San Diego. I wake up to my rooster crowing and my goats demanding their breakfast, not to traffic and radios! Most homes here are on over an acre of land, and many people own livestock. The one traffic light in town has a crossing button for horseback riders! \n"}, {"text": "From 94, we turn south on Highway 188 to a tiny town on the Mexican border.

Where are we?", "correct": "Tecate", "options": ["Tijuana", "Otay", "Dulzura"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTecate.\n\n\tThe Mexican town is home to the Tecate brewery. It's a pleasant town to visit, not at all touristy- you can hang out under the trees in the zocalo (town square) in the middle of town, nibble pastries from the panaderia and watch the world go by. \n"}, {"text": "We continue east on 94 to a very small town that boasts a railroad museum. On weekends, we can ride an old steam engine to the Mexican town of Tecate and back. Where are we?", "correct": "Campo", "options": ["Dulzura", "Dehesa", "Mount Laguna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCampo.\n\n\tYou are in the mountains now- most of Campo is covered with oak trees. \n"}, {"text": "Presently, 94 joins up with I-8.

Where are we?", "correct": "Boulevard", "options": ["Jamul", "Borrego Springs", "Spring Valley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoulevard.\n\n\tThis is a high desert town. From here, it's all downhill to the desert. \n"}, {"text": "Let's head up I-8 and take the Sunrise Highway exit to a tiny mountain town with mostly seasonal occupants. Where are we?", "correct": "Mount Laguna", "options": ["Julian", "Palomar Mountain", "Alpine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMount Laguna.\n\n\tThis is the most popular spot for winter recreation in San Diego, as it's one of the few spots in the county that usually gets some snow every year. \n"}, {"text": "Continuing north on the Sunrise Highway, we make our way through the forest to Highway 79. Here is the most touristy town in San Diego- home to knick-knack shops and apple pies galore. The Apple Festival is celebrated every fall here. Where are we?", "correct": "Julian", "options": ["El Cajon", "Tecate", "Ramona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJulian.\n\n\tVery few apples are actually grown in Julian. It was originally a gold mining town, and you can still visit the old mines. \n"}, {"text": "Continuing on Highway 79, we then take Highway 78 east, down to the desert floor. There is a small town here, but few can bear living here in the summer, when temperatures routinely top 110 degrees.

We come to a small town known best for its mission and its bread- Dudley's Bakery, to be exact. Where are we?", "correct": "Santa Ysabel", "options": ["San Ysidro", "Chula Vista", "Escondido"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSanta Ysabel.\n\n\tDudley's sells hundreds of loaves a day. Perhaps their most famous breads are date-nut and cheddar cheese. \n"}, {"text": "We continue south on 79 to its junction with Highway 67 to the largest of the backcountry towns of San Diego, and one of the fastest-growing. ", "correct": "Ramona", "options": ["Julian", "Santee", "Jamul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRamona.\n\n\tRamona is also known as \"The Valley of the Sun\" because it's located above the fog line and below the snow line (usually!) \n"}, {"text": "Continuing south on 67, we come to a town whose main claim to fame is a series of manmade lakes- one of the first in the US to be filled with water from a sewage treatment plant.", "correct": "Santee", "options": ["El Cajon", "Del Mar", "Lakeside"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantee.\n\n\tThe first lakes were built in the 1960's and were featured in \"Reader's Digest.\" \n"}, {"text": "We continue south on 67 to rejoin I-8. We are in another of the largest towns in San Diego County, home to the annual \"Mother Goose Parade\" on Thanksgiving weekend. Where are we?", "correct": "El Cajon", "options": ["Santee", "La Mesa", "Spring Valley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEl Cajon.\n\n\tOnce a quiet lower-middle class community, El Cajon has been hit hard by urban blight and is attempting to revitalize its once-busy downtown area. \n"}, {"text": "We continue west on 8 to Interstate 15 and head north. We come to a city that is known outside of San Diego County primarily for its role in two crimes- the killing of Cara Knott by Highway Patrol officer Craig Peyer in 1986 and the kidnapping and killing of 7 year old Danielle Van Dam in 2002. ", "correct": "Poway", "options": ["Escondido", "Rancho Bernardo", "Vista"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoway.\n\n\tIn the 1980's, Poway was a fairly rural area, but now it is more like a bedroom community for San Diego. Although Danielle Van Dam was not kidnapped in Poway, much of the testimony centered around participants in the case meeting at Dad's Steakhouse in Poway. \n"}, {"text": "Continuing north on 15, we come to the northernmost city along I-15 in San Diego County, known primarily for agricultural crops such as citrus and avocadoes. Where are we now?", "correct": "Fallbrook", "options": ["Vista", "Escondido", "Oceanside"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFallbrook.\n\n\tFallbrook is a little over an hour's drive from downtown San Diego. \n"}, {"text": "From 15, we take Highway 76, the \"Highway to the Stars.\" Climbing up some of the tallest mountains in San Diego, we reach a small mountain town that is home to a state park and a world-famous observatory.
