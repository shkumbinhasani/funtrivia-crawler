Can you tell me what it is?", "correct": "blue whale", "options": ["great white shark", "giant squid", "orca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nblue whale.\n\n\tYou are quite right; it's the blue whale.  Why, I do say, that is one big baby! Did you know that by 2010 the blue whale was considered an endangered species? This is why we must take care of our oceans; after all, we want these big animals to be around for a long time. \n"}, {"text": "Next we move on to celebrities.  Why, just the other day I saw the strangest thing.  I was in a celebrity's house looking for clues, and inside a walk-in closet I saw the celebrity sound asleep!

In which country would I find it?", "correct": "Thailand", "options": ["Tunisia", "Taiwan", "Turkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThailand.\n\n\tI'd hate to have that on a spelling test.

In order to compensate for the difference and keep on track, leaders decided to eliminate eleven days of that year. \n"}, {"text": "Let us explore world.

Illinois has a law forbidding people to dance barefoot. Another interesting law from Illinois states that a theatre manager in Winnetka can kick you out of his theatre if your feet stink.  Hmm...maybe that's why I can't dance barefoot.  (Sniffs his foot) They could stand to be cleaned again. \n"}, {"text": "Oh, my favorite category: literature.  My favorite writer, of course, is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, my creator.  I was quite upset with him at one point, however, when he had the nerve to have me done in.

He eventually stopped conducting because he couldn't tolerate this situation.  He did go on to become one of the greatest composers, however. \n"}, {"text": "Religion is always an interesting topic.

What type of sport is croquet?", "correct": "Lawn game", "options": ["Court game", "Street game", "Tabletop game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLawn game.\n\n\tCroquet can be a simple lawn game or a competitive sport.

I used elementary logic my dear Trivians; that is how I knew you would ask.  Croquet is a French term that means crooked stick. \n"}]}
