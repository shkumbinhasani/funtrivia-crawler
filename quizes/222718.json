These party members are led by Mario, the famous plumber.  In the beginning of the game, Mario, Princess Toadstool and Bowser are thrown in different directions by Smithy's sword, Exor, as it crashes into the Factory.  Eventually, Bowser and Toadstool also join the party, but first, Mario must meet up with Mallow and Geno in Mushroom Kingdom and Forest Maze respectively.\n\nWhat's wrong with this paragraph?", "correct": "Exor doesn't crash into the Factory.", "options": ["Geno is first met in Rose Town.", "Mallow is added to the party after Bowser is.", "Princess Toadstool is actually named Princess Peach in this game."], "explanation": "\n\n\nExor doesn't crash into the Factory.\n\n\tIn the very beginning of the game, Princess Toadstool is taken to Bowser's Castle, and after battling Bowser on the chandeliers, Exor crashes into Bowser's Castle.  The Factory is actually within the dimension within the sword.  As Mario progresses through the different areas, he meets Mallow outside Mushroom Kingdom and you have to help him stop Croco from escaping with a Frog Coin, and he meets Geno in Forest Maze after he comes to life at the inn in Rose Town. Bowser is added to the party outside Booster Castle while Princess Toadstool also joins the party in Mushroom Kingdom (but only after you save her in Marrymore).  Princess Toadstool wasn't known as Princess Peach (or just Peach) until \"Super Mario 64\" was released. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the game, there are many equippable weapons and armor for the party members.  In the very beginning of the game, Mario will be able to obtain the Hammer after defeating the Hammer Bros.  Throughout the rest of the game, you can find weapons for each party member in different locations and shops.  If a weapon isn't attached to a character, they fight unarmed.  In fact, Bowser starts out with a weapon while all of the rest of the characters are added to the group without a weapon.  A powerful weapon and armor set are the Lazy Shells which can be found in Rose Town.\n\nWhere did I mess up here?", "correct": "Bowser starts out unarmed.", "options": ["If there are no weapons attached to a character, they use other characters' weapons.", "The Hammer is found in Bowser's Keep.", "The Lazy Shells are found in Nimbus Land."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowser starts out unarmed.\n\n\tThe only character which starts out with a weapon is Princess Toadstool although you can buy her a new weapon soon after you add her to the party.  In fact, she is also wearing a dress (that's her armor) which can be upgraded nearly immediately.  The Hammer can be found immediately after you save Toad from the Hammer Bros on Mushroom Way and the Lazy Shells are in the sky over Rose Town. To get to them, you need a Seed from Bean Valley and Fertilizer from Nimbus Land.  These two items have great defense and attack power, but they can possibly bring down your Mg. Attack and Mg. Defense Powers.  \n"}, {"text": "Sure, status inflictions stink.  I mean, no one really likes them.  After all, Megasmilax can turn party members into Mushrooms and Belome can transform people into Scarecrows.  There are a couple of ways to get around this though.  By finding accessories throughout the game, players can prevent status changes during battle.  Getting poisoned a lot?  Use the Antidote Pin for that!  The Antidote Pin will prevent you from taking any poison damage.  Tired of turning into a scarecrow?  Use the Trueform Pin.  After all, the Trueform Pin will prevent you from becoming both a Scarecrow and a Mushroom.  Not many of these come cheap, but some sell for extravagant prices.  For example: The Amulet found in Marrymore will sell for 200 coins!\n\nI know I messed up in there somewhere.  What's the error I made?", "correct": "The Amulet isn't found in Marrymore.", "options": ["The Amulet sells for 500 coins.", "The Trueform Pin only stops you from becoming a Scarecrow, not a Mushroom.", "The Antidote Pin is actually called the Poison Pin."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Amulet isn't found in Marrymore.\n\n\tStatus inflictions are ugly things.  With these, enemies can seriously hinder you.  Some of these inflictions include Poison which will slowly decrease your health, Mute which will prevent you from using Y-Button Special attacks, Sleep which will obviously put you to sleep, and the Scarecrow and Mushroom effects.  The final status infliction causes Fear.  Fear will drastically decrease a party member's attack and defense powers.\rOf course, not all accessories protect from these.  Some, like the Jump Shoes will raise Mario's Jump attacks, and the Amulet (which is found in Booster's Tower) will raise your luck.  Some, like the Zoom Shoes and Feather, will increase your speed. \n"}, {"text": "There are a lot of weird and unique enemies in this game.  Some of these are familiar to Mario fans while others may be rather new.  For example, one is likely to find Goombas and Koopas early in the game on Mushroom Way, but players are unlikely to see them in Land's End because it's much farther into the game.  Some really weird ones may include Raspberry and Bundt.  These enemies are actually bosses, but what's different about them is that they're two pieces of a large wedding cake.  You can fight them in Marrymore when you're saving Princess Toadstool.  Another odd enemy is Yaridovich.  I'm not really sure what he is, but he's fought in Seaside Town, and some of his moves, like Water Blast, are extremely powerful.\n\nDid you spot the error?  What did I do wrong?", "correct": "Koopas aren't found on Mushroom Way", "options": ["Bundt and Raspberry aren't found in Marrymore", "Yaridovich doesn't use the Water Blast attack", "Yaridovich is not in Seaside Town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKoopas aren't found on Mushroom Way.\n\n\tTechnically, Koopas aren't really found at all in this game (excluding Magikoopa).  On Mushroom Way, you'll definitely find some Goombas and Spikies, but instead of Koopas, you'll find their flying relatives, Sky Troopas.  They're relatively easy to beat, because after all, they only have 10 HP.  Throughout the game, you'll run into plenty of flying Troopas including some who will help you climb the cliff wall in Land's End.  Bundt, Raspberry, and Yaridovich are all bosses in the game. Two are found in Marrymore, while one is in Seaside Town.  Yaridovich is quite a strong boss, and if you're at a low level, then you won't fare well. Yaridovich has attacks that will damage your party members a lot and he also has a move that will create a clone of himself.  If you manage to distinguish which Yaridovich is the clone and which isn't, he'll usually shift back to his normal self.  It doesn't hurt to use items in this battle, and Pick Me Ups are good almost anywhere. \n"}, {"text": "Items are extremely useful in this game.  The first items you'll come across are the ever-popular Mushrooms which are found in many Mario games.  Toad will hand them to you as you leave Mario's Pad and head to Mushroom Kingdom.  As you make your way around the map, new items will start to appear.  For example, the Pick Me Up, first found in Mushroom Kingdom, will revive a defeated party member, and it only costs 5 coins!  What else?  Pure Water will defeat any ghost enemies like Big Boos or Shadows (both of which are in Kero Sewers).  Able Juice can first be bought in Rose Town and it cures all status effects like Mute, Poison, and Fear.  As you progress, better Mushrooms and Syrups (for FP) can be found.  Upgrades like Mid and Max Mushrooms are more expensive, but they'll fill more health, and the same goes for Maple and Royal Syrups which will also fill more and more Flower Points.\n\nDid you catch that one?  I know there's an error in there.  What did I say wrong?", "correct": "Able Juice can be bought earlier in the game", "options": ["Toad doesn't give you Mushrooms at Mario's Pad", "Royal Syrup should actually be Max Syrup", "Pick Me Ups can't be bought; they're found in your travels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAble Juice can be bought earlier in the game.\n\n\tAble Juice, along with Pick Me Ups, Mushrooms, and Honey Syrup can all be bought for low prices at Mushroom Kingdom's shop.  These prices remain the same throughout the land, but as different items are upgraded, they have higher prices.  If you decide to sell an item, they usually sell for about half of the price that they were bought for.  In some towns, item shops also sell weapons, armor, and accessories, but this is not always the case.  For example, Seaside Town sells things in separate areas making the place look like a large strip mall.\rAlthough many items are bought in shops, that doesn't mean that everything can be found there.  A lot of items can be found in chests, and some can even be found on the ground.  For example, if you go to the Forest Maze, you can pick an inventory full of Mushrooms to sell.  Not only can you find random items, but some can be earned from battling certain people.  Some items, like membership cards, can't be sold.  Instead, they stay in their own little area on the menu. \n"}, {"text": "As party members progress through the levels, they will start gaining more and more special moves.  Many of Mario's moves are Fire or Jump related, while many of Princess Toadstool's moves have to do with healing and status effects.  In fact, Princess Toadstool has no attacks which damage the enemy at all.  Bowser learns the least amount of special attacks in the group (only four).  Many of Mallow's attacks are weather related (like Thunderbolt or HP Rain), while Geno has many abnormal attacks like Geno Beam, Geno Whirl, and Geno Blast.  In fact, all of Geno's special attacks begin with the name 'Geno'.  It's odd, after all, Geno isn't really the character's real name!\n\nWhat did I do wrong this time?", "correct": "Princess Toadstool has one special attack that does damage", "options": ["Bowser has the second-least amount of special attacks", "Geno Blast isn't an actual attack", "Geno is the character's actual name; he says so in the Forest Maze"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincess Toadstool has one special attack that does damage.\n\n\tPrincess Toadstool's final special attack, Psych Bomb, is the only one of her special attacks that damages the opponent, but alas, it is learned so late in the game that it really doesn't matter too much.  She learns it at level 18.  Bowser's four moves are Terrorize, Poison Gas, Crusher, and Bowser Crush.  Two of his moves are mainly used for status inflictions.  Geno Blast is an actual attack.  Geno's attacks include Geno Beam,  Geno Boost, Geno Whirl, Geno Blast, and Geno Flash (in that order).  Geno Boost is the only one which doesn't directly damage enemies.  Instead, it raises a party member's attack power, and if you time it right, the defense power as well.\rAh right, let me explain the name part as well.  The spirit inside of the Geno doll is actually that of a guardian of the Star Pieces which broke off of the Star Road.  When Mario was knocked out by Gaz's Geno doll in the Rose Town Inn, the guardian decided to insert itself into the doll.  After defeating Bowyer in the Forest Maze, players will learn that the character's actual name is something along the lines of %$#&@*, but since it's hard to pronounce, the character says that he wouldn't mind being called Geno, after the doll. \n"}, {"text": "In the game, there are many different locations across the land that you can visit.  You head in a clockwise circle around the map and visit basically every place in order to accomplish every goal.  There are seven towns from Mushroom Kingdom to Nimbus Land, and there are many locations that seem like dungeons like the Sunken Ship and Belome Temple.  In order to reach the Sunken Ship, you must head to the Sea, and you must travel through Monstro Town to reach Belome Temple.  Another neat area is Barrel Volcano, located near the end of the game.  In this area, there are many enemies to fight and you can visit Hinopio.  There are also two boss battles in this area.\n\nWhere is my mistake?", "correct": "You need to travel through Land's End to reach Belome Temple", "options": ["There's only one boss battle in Barrel Volcano", "There are less than seven towns on the map", "You must head counter-clockwise on the map"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou need to travel through Land's End to reach Belome Temple.\n\n\tAlthough there are a also many different areas across the land, many areas also look the same.  For example, Booster Pass looks a lot like the first half of Land's End.  In the final portion of Land's End, you'll need to navigate your way through quicksand to reach Belome's Temple on your way to Monstro Town. After Nimbus Land, you can visit Barrel Volcano.  In this volcano, you can fight the first boss, the Czar Dragon, for your sixth star, and then, when the Axem Rangers steal the star, you can fight them on the edge of the crater.  What about towns?  As you move clockwise around the map, you can visit Mushroom Kingdom, Rose Town, Moleville, Marrymore, Seaside Town, Monstro Town, and Nimbus Land. \n"}, {"text": "Although there are five main characters in the game, there are numerous supporting characters.  Without them, our heroes would surely be doomed.  For example, had Gaz not been at Rose Town Inn with her Geno doll, then we certainly would've had a more difficult time fighting Bowyer in the Forest Maze.  Had we not met and fought Johnny in the Sunken Ship, then Yaridovich could've escaped in Seaside Town.  Who knows what would've happened if we hadn't have had Toad by our side in Mushroom Way!  We could've been Goomba fodder!  Sure, maybe they never really helped us, but Raz and Raini were an important couple too.  When we meet them in Seaside Town, they're being held hostage in the shed by Yaridovich.\n\nI know I screwed up in there again.  What did I mess up with?", "correct": "Raz and Raini are in Marrymore", "options": ["Actually, that paragraph looks about right.  No errors there!", "Gaz and the Geno doll are in Mushroom Kingdom", "We don't fight Johnny in the Sunken Ship, we fight him in Seaside Town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaz and Raini are in Marrymore.\n\n\tRaz and Raini are the newlyweds in Marrymore who get kicked out of their own wedding ceremony by Booster when you chase him into the town in pursuit of Princess Toadstool.  Gaz is also an important character, because after all, if she hadn't shot us, Geno may never have become a party member.  Johnny is also an important character. Although we fight him as a boss, he becomes an ally after we obtain the star and he prevents Yaridovich from escaping.  Once we beat Yaridovich, we can get the Shed Key to save the residents of Seaside Town.  Toad is quite important in the beginning of the game.  If you're a beginner, Toad will teach you about the menus, Timed Hits, and attacks. Plus, Toad will give you items along the way if you happen to save him a few times.  Toad can possibly give you your first Flower Tab.  Toad also appears at the end of the final area, Factory, to sell items to you.  This way, you can stock up for the final battle against Smithy. \n"}, {"text": "What good would an RPG be without bosses?  \"Super Mario RPG\" is full of them.  Although your first boss fight is technically about Bowser, it's a given that you will win it.  All you need to do to beat him is take out the Kinklink of the chandelier!  As the game progresses, the bosses obviously get harder.  Belome, found in both Belome Temple and Pipe Vault, is an odd enemy.  He'll turn characters into scarecrows, put them to sleep, and make clones after a while.  Nearly each of the seven stars is also guarded by a boss.  Mack will be in Mushroom Kingdom, and Bowyer will be in Forest Maze.  One enemy, Johnny, will become an ally after you fight him for a star.  The Czar Dragon in Barrel Volcano guards the sixth star of the game.\n\nWhat is my mistake this time?", "correct": "Belome isn't found in Pipe Vault", "options": ["The Czar Dragon guards the fifth star", "Bowyer and Mack are mixed up; Bowyer's in Mushroom Kingdom while Mack is in the Forest Maze", "During the Bowser battle, the Kinklink is actually called 'Pulley'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBelome isn't found in Pipe Vault.\n\n\tBelome is first found in the Kero Sewers, right after you defeat Mack in Mushroom kingdom to get the first of seven legendary stars.  During the first battle, Belome won't clone anyone, but he still has the power to transform you into a scarecrow.  If you pick up that Trueform Pin that you can get after you defeat the Pandorite in the sewers, then you can be safe from any of those status changes.  In the second battle in Belome Temple (where else?), focus will be shifted away from scarecrows and onto sleep effects.  Belome will use sleep moves like Aurora Flash and Light Beam to put your characters to sleep, then eat them, and then clone them into new 'mini-bosses' which will use more special and primary attacks.  Belome will also guard a treasure in his temple, and the key is lodged on the rooftop of a house in Monstro Town.  A bit of an earthquake might just dislodge it...\rA boss guards nearly every star.  \rMack is in Mushroom Kingdom.\rBowyer is in Forest Maze.\rPunchinello is in Moleville Mines.\rJohnny guards a star in the Sunken Ship, but you turn it over to Yaridovich in Seaside Town.\rAnother star is earned after defeating the Czar Dragon, Axem Rangers, and Blade at Barrel Volcano.\rThe seventh star is guarded by Smithy in the Factory.\rWhat did I miss?  The fourth star is found on Star Hill.  No bosses included. \n"}, {"text": "The end of the game is great, and I'm sorry I spoiled it for a question.  After you defeat the horrible enemies, trials and bosses of Bowser's Castle, you'll fight Exor.  Exor is the giant sword that crashed into the castle.  During the battle, you'll need to watch Exor's brain, left and right eyes, and the Exor piece itself.  You can't actually attack the Exor piece until you've stunned some of the other pieces first.  Once it's defeated, you'll go to the Factory.  Along the way, you'll have a chance to reunite with old bosses like Mack, Bowyer, and Yaridovich as they head off the assembly line.  When you get deeper into the factory, you'll finally defeat the last bosses before you reach Smithy.  Along the way, Toad will come along with some items and he'll sell them to you.  During the Smithy battle, you'll start in the factory and you'll need to watch out for his Smelting machine.  If you don't destroy it, it will help Smithy produce some helpful allies for himself.  In his second stage, Smithy's head will take several forms, but after inflicting thousands of Hit Points, he'll finally lose.  Geno's spirit will head back to the heavens, the Star Road will be saved, and the rest of the gang can head back home to their lives.  Cue the parade, roll the credits.\n\nThe ending may have been memorable, but did you remember enough to notice my error?  Where did I go wrong this time?", "correct": "During the battle against Exor, you don't fight his brain", "options": ["Smithy's head won't take several forms, his whole body will", "Toad won't sell you items in the factory.  Croco will instead", "Mack and Bowyer won't be fought in the factory, but Yaridovich will"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuring the battle against Exor, you don't fight his brain.\n\n\tDuring the battle against Exor, you'll fight the left and right eyes and his mouth.  Each of these will be regarded as enemies and they will all have evil new attacks.  When you finally reach the Factory area, you'll need to use your control skills, your battle skills, and your logic skills.  You'll fight many new bosses and be pushed to the limits to defeat them.  For instance, Countdown will be found early in the area, and possibly three more bosses will be found.  When you get to the 'brighter' area of the factory, you'll fight the Manager and soforth of the factory along with Gunyolk.  Gunyolk will have that infamous Blaster Beam attack that Blade had on Barrel Mountain, and like before, it will do serious damage.\rDuring the battle against Smithy, use your items only when necessary, bring Pick Me Ups, and in his second form, attack his head.  I strongly advise you to use the Lazy Shells in this case since they help tremendously.\r Well, finally, my errors have been seen and fixed, and I can send this one to the queue.  Another quiz complete!  Thanks for your help and knowledge! :) \n"}]}
