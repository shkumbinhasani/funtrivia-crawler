It is a dominant gene, so any animal with one copy of this gene won't have horns. However, if a goat has two copies of this gene, not only will it not have horns, but it may be a hermaphrodite- it may have some of the sexual structures of both male and female goats.\" \n"}, {"text": "You want to write a quiz on human parasites.
