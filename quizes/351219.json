{"id": "351219", "name": "Survivor: Micronesia - Fans vs. Favorites Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Survivor", "Survivor: Micronesia"], "questions": [{"text": "How many castaways from earlier seasons returned for \"Survivor: Micronesia\"?", "correct": "Ten", "options": ["Twelve", "Eight", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTen.\n\n\tArriving on a small island in Micronesia in the pouring rain, ten fans of \"Survivor\", self-proclaimed experts on the show, arrived on a welcome mat to discover that they would be competing against ten castaways from previous \"Survivor\" seasons all the way back to the \"Pearl Islands\".  In addition, they would need to cross to another island (in the storm) to get their boat and a hidden Individual Immunity Idol-- there would be one on each boat for each tribe and the person who claimed it would be immune from their first Tribal Council. This was claimed by Yau-Man and Kathy on Malakal and Airai, respectively. \n"}, {"text": "Who, to the surprise of many, was the first 'favorite' voted out?", "correct": "Jonny 'Fairplay'", "options": ["Yau-Man", "James", "Eliza"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJonny 'Fairplay'.\n\n\tOn Day 3, the 'Fans' of Airai won in an upset over the 'Favorites' of Malakal during the Reward/Immunity Challenge and claimed the idol and a flint.  As a result, Malakal headed to their first Tribal Council with makeshift alliances in tow.  To the surprise of everyone else, notorious player Jonny 'Fairplay' asked specifically to be voted out so that he could spend time with his pregnant wife before the birth of his daughter.  The tribe complied, voting him out unanimously; he received more votes than anyone else in a single Tribal Council during this game. \n"}, {"text": "For the first time, Exile Island allowed for which of these?", "correct": "Two people to be sent at a time", "options": ["A camp to be built", "The exiled tribe member to bring their luxuries", "Challenges to be held on its shores"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo people to be sent at a time.\n\n\tThis season, Exile Island was set in a beautiful inlet on a relatively small beach.  At the same time, the area would be faced with rising tides the further on in the day.  For the first time, two people would be sent to Exile Island every week until the merge.  The winners of each Reward Challenge sent a member of the opposing tribe to Exile Island before selecting one of their own as well.  Exile Island was marked by a single wooden structure rising from the beach.  This contained a single clue to a Hidden Immunity Idol. \n"}, {"text": "Who was pulled from the game on Day 15 for an injury sustained to their knee?", "correct": "Jonathan", "options": ["Joel", "Mikey", "Yau-Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJonathan.\n\n\tCompeting in a Reward Challenge on Day 12, Jonathan of the Malakal tribe ended up hurting his leg.  While this wasn't seen as an issue at the time (as others had sustained injuries, particularly Ami, Chet, and Parvati), the pain in his knee worsened over the next few days, clearly impacting his ability to walk at the next Immunity Challenge and after.  On Day 15 he was told to evacuate the island by medical professionals as his wound had become infected and required immediate treatment.  Despite this, an Immunity Challenge was still held on Day 17 and Chet was ousted from Malakal.\rJames was also removed from the game, but on Day 30 for an infection in one of his fingers which would require medical help if he did not leave the competition. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 19, Kathy of the Airai tribe did which of these?", "correct": "Quit the game", "options": ["Found an Immunity Idol", "Caught a shark", "Broke her wrist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuit the game.\n\n\tHaving spent nineteen days in poor conditions (with three nights on Exile Island) and several nights with no sleep because of the rain, Kathy opted to evacuate herself from the game becoming one of only a few in \"Survivor\" history to willingly leave.  Even though Kathy left Airai, the proceeding challenges went on uninterrupted and Malakal lost the next Immunity Challenge.  They voted out Tracy in the following Tribal Council and nine people were ousted from the game in only twenty days. \n"}, {"text": "When the final ten players reached the merge, they took on what new tribe name?", "correct": "Dabu", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDabu.\n\n\tOn Day 22, with only half the castaways remaining in the game, the ten survivors ended up merging and living at Malakal beach, the original 'Favorites' beach.  After a feast, the group decided on Dabu for their name (though it had no real meaning) and they painted their flag with the new tribe colour, beige.  After this point in the game, the castaways competed in individual challenges and only one person was sent to Exile Island after each Reward Challenge.  By this point, only four 'fans' remained in the game and six 'favorites' had the numbers. \n"}, {"text": "Which castaway used a fake Immunity Idol at Tribal Council?", "correct": "Eliza", "options": ["Jason", "Ami", "Tracy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEliza.\n\n\tBecause Ozzy ended up claiming the Hidden Immunity Idol on Day 9, Exile Island would be for nothing more than the trip itself and sending others on their way between challenges.  When Jason showed up six days later he followed the clues and found nothing more than a stick intentionally left behind by Ozzy as a fake idol.  When the tribes merged, Jason showed the idol to Eliza and, while she knew it was a phony, she used it at the proceeding Tribal Council and it was thrown onto the fire.  She was eliminated as the first jury member at the same vote. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the only person to use the Hidden Immunity Idol to negate votes during the entire game?", "correct": "Amanda", "options": ["Cirie", "Jason", "Chet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmanda.\n\n\tAs the game progressed and actual Hidden Immunity Idols started disappearing from play as later castaways were blindsided and voted out, new idols were hidden in their place.  Amanda was the only one to locate an idol on Exile Island and use it in a subsequent Tribal Council.  When she did so on Day 33, she saved herself from elimination and negated four votes set against her.  As a result, Alexis was voted out instead.  This was the last Hidden Immunity Idol found in the game.  Ozzy's left the game without being used and Jason's was not used either. \n"}, {"text": "What tribe member notoriously decided to give away their Individual Immunity late in the game, resulting in their elimination?", "correct": "Erik", "options": ["Eliza", "Natalie", "Alexis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErik.\n\n\tOn Day 36, during the Tribal Council of the final five, \"Survivor\" had one of its biggest blunders.  When the five headed to Tribal Council, the four remaining women tricked Erik into giving Natalie his well-earned Immunity Necklace because they claimed it would give good favour to the jury.  What he didn't know was that they had also planned to vote him out immediately after.  While the jury watched, stunned, Erik had his torch snuffed out in fifth place and, for the first time in \"Survivor\" history, the final four consisted of all women. \n"}, {"text": "Who won this season, becoming the Sole Survivor of \"Survivor: Micronesia\"?", "correct": "Parvati", "options": ["Natalie", "Amanda", "Cirie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParvati.\n\n\tOn Day 39, only two castaways remained-- Amanda and Parvati-- as Nicole and Cirie had been voted out in two earlier Tribal Councils.  This was the first time in several seasons (since \"Exile Island\") that the final Tribal Council consisted of two finalists.  The eight jury members cast their votes and ultimately, Parvati Shallow won out over Amanda Kimmel five votes to three. Parvati received votes from Cirie, Natalie, Alexis, Jason, and Eliza while Amanda received hers from Erik, James, and Ozzy.  Parvati originally placed sixth in \"Cook Islands\" while Kimmel placed third in \"China\".  The final three (which included Cirie) would return for \"Heroes vs. Villains\" in 2010. \n"}]}
