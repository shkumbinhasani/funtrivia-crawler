{"id": "223688", "name": "How Much Is That Puppy in the Window- Really? Quiz | Animals | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Dogs"], "questions": [{"text": "Where do most puppies sold in pet stores in the United States come from?", "correct": "Puppy mills- facilities that breed dogs for profit", "options": ["Puppies bred by the pet stores themselves", "Private breeders who do not own a kennel", "Kennels owned by the pet stores"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuppy mills- facilities that breed dogs for profit.\n\n\tEstimates by several animal welfare groups are that 90 to 98% of puppies sold in pet stores come from kennels that breed puppies for profit, otherwise known as \"puppy mills.\" \n"}, {"text": "Many pet stores claim that their puppies do not come from \"puppy mills,\" but from \"licensed breeders.\" What is the difference?", "correct": "There is none", "options": ["Puppy mills do not need to provide health information on their dogs, licensed breeders do", "Puppy mills are not registered with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA,) licensed breeders are", "Puppy mills produce hundreds of litters annually, licensed breeders produce only a few"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThere is none.\n\n\tPet stores try to sugar-coat the sources of their puppies. \"Licensed breeder\" sounds much more clean and humane than \"puppy mill.\" But, in reality, the two entities are the same- puppy mills, in order to be legal, *must* register with and be licensed by the USDA in order to sell their puppies to retail outlets. Thus, anyone selling to a pet store is a \"licensed breeder.\" \n"}, {"text": "Legally, can a pet store in the United States turn away an unsuitable owner for a puppy?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tPet store puppies are merchandise, and are treated legally like any other merchandise. Thus, if a customer wishes to buy a puppy on impulse, but obviously has absolutely no puppy experience, lives in an apartment, works full-time, and cannot afford to care for the dog, the pet store cannot refuse to sell the person a puppy, or else they can be sued. \n"}, {"text": "What method do many U.S. pet stores use to urge their employees to sell more puppies?", "correct": "Commission sales", "options": ["Telling customers in great detail about the source of the puppies", "Donating to humane societies for each puppy sold", "Telling customers in great detail about the characteristics of the breed of the puppies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommission sales.\n\n\tUnder the commission system, employees receive a cash commission for every puppy sold. Thus, the employees are encouraged to \"push\" puppies, even to people unsuitable for owning a stuffed toy, let alone a dog. Pet stores realize that the impulse buyers are their bread and butter. \n"}, {"text": "What disease is most prevalent among pet store dogs?", "correct": "Kennel cough (bordetella)", "options": ["Rabies", "Distemper", "Parvovirus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKennel cough (bordetella).\n\n\tKennel cough, a respiratory illness, is rampant in dogs kept in crowded and stressful conditions. While adult dogs can usually fight off the illness without severe consequences, it can be fatal in young puppies with underdeveloped immune systems. Pet store employees are trained to tell customers that the sick puppies \"just have a little cold,\" and the sick pups are rarely isolated- they cannot be sold if the public cannot see them! \n"}, {"text": "What side-effect is the most notable consequence of rearing puppies in small cages?", "correct": "They can be nearly impossible to housebreak", "options": ["They do not learn to exercise", "They are afraid of crates", "They are possessive of small spaces"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey can be nearly impossible to housebreak.\n\n\tHousebreaking a puppy relies on its natural instinct to keep the den clean. When puppies are kept in cages, they must eliminate where they eat and sleep, a most unnatural behavior. They lose their instinctive desire to be clean, and are extremely difficult to housebreak. \n"}, {"text": "Quite a few studies have been done on the correlation of dog behavioral problems and puppy source. Which of the following is *not* more common in pet store dogs than in dogs obtained from other sources?", "correct": "Destructive chewing", "options": ["Dominance-related aggression", "Fears and phobias", "Separation anxiety"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDestructive chewing.\n\n\tA study by Dr. Andrew Jagoe, reported in \"The Domestic\rDog: Its Evolution, Behaviour and Interactions with People\" edited by James Serpell, found that the above severe behavioral problems were more common in pet store puppies, and that, overall, pet store pups had more behavioral problems than dogs from any other source. This is probably related to early weaning, traumatic early experiences, and lack of socialization. \n"}, {"text": "Most pet stores in the United States sell puppies.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tA survey by the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, the lobbying arm of the pet industry, found that only about 25% of pet stores sell puppies. \n"}, {"text": "Anyone who breeds puppies for profit must, under US law, register with the US Department of Agriculture and be inspected periodically.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBreeders must register only if they sell pups to retail channels, and then only if they derive a substantial portion of their income from breeding. Puppy mills that sell directly to the public, either in person or through Internet sales, are exempt from what little regulation now exists. \n"}, {"text": "Kansas is the home state of many of the most notorious puppy mills. Which of the following is illegal in Kansas?", "correct": "Photographing a dog breeding facility without the permission of the owner", "options": ["Breeding a dog on every heat cycle for its entire life", "Keeping dogs in cages with wire floors", "Shooting non-productive dogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhotographing a dog breeding facility without the permission of the owner.\n\n\tFaced with mounting criticism of the puppymills in its state, the Kansas legislature reacted in a truly absurd fashion- rather than changing the treatment of dogs, it made it illegal to document such treatment. \n"}, {"text": "Puppies sold in pet stores must be registered with a legitimate registry, such as the American Kennel Club.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, since the AKC began requiring minimal inspections of mass breeding facilities to ensure that proper AKC paperwork was completed, puppy mills began creating their own \"registries\" such as the American Canine Association and the Continental Kennel Club to provide puppies with \"papers.\" Animal advocates have succeeded in registering everything from stuffed animals to toasters with these \"registries.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which United States county has the largest concentration of puppy mills?", "correct": "Lancaster County, Pennsylvania", "options": ["Pawnee County, Kansas", "Lincoln County, Missouri", "Yell County, Arkansas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLancaster County, Pennsylvania.\n\n\tAmish farmers, more usually known for their horse-drawn vehicles and drab clothing, are infamous within the animal welfare community for their puppy mills. Many of these mills sell directly to consumers, and are thus not even USDA-registered.\r As the story \"Amish Puppy Industry Draws Charges of Cruelty\" http://www.newhouse.com/archive/murray112805.html documented:\r\"Perhaps 60 fluffy white dogs were tucked in rabbit hutches stacked a story high and several dozen feet across.\r Scores of others filled dozens of pens stacked two-high on both sides of an alleyway. The sight of human visitors ignited a fury of yelps, and the dogs pawed their mesh cages.\"\r And, as one Amish farmer said, \"\"They (the outsiders) see their animals like people, give them the run of the house and let them jump on the bed at night -- and that's fine,\" John Stoltzfus said. \"I've nothing against that. But out here, we're farmers, and our animals are animals.\" \n"}, {"text": "What state produces the most puppymill pups?", "correct": "Missouri", "options": ["Kansas", "Arkansas", "Pennsylvania"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMissouri.\n\n\tAccording to www.nopuppymills.com, 52% of petstore pups come from Missouri and 23% from Kansas. \n"}, {"text": "What is the most common breed of dog in U.S. puppymills?", "correct": "Yorkshire terrier", "options": ["Maltese", "Labrador retriever", "Boston terrier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYorkshire terrier.\n\n\tIn general, small dogs are more common in puppymills, as more can be raised in a small space. Dogs that are \"free-whelping\"- that deliver their pups without veterinary assistance- are also preferred. \n"}, {"text": "Statistics show that over 20% of dogs in pet stores are said to be born on a Monday, when the law of averages should show 14%. What is the theory about why this happens, according to www.nopuppymills.com?", "correct": "Puppymills are lying about the ages of the puppies", "options": ["Puppymills mainly breed on weekends", "No one sees puppies born over the weekend, they are seen for the first time on a Monday", "Puppymills forget when the puppies were born, and \"Monday\" is the first answer that comes to mind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuppymills are lying about the ages of the puppies.\n\n\tThe theory is that, in order to sell well, puppies must be small and cute. Federal law says that they should not be sold or transported until they are eight weeks of age. Puppies of this age are not small enough or cute enough. Since the puppy brokers usually pick pups up on Mondays, it is easiest to falsify the age by saying that the pup just turned eight weeks old on that Monday. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following *is* required, under the U.S. federal Animal Welfare Act, of people raising dogs for profit and selling them to retail channels?", "correct": "Not selling puppies before age 8 weeks", "options": ["Not keeping dogs in solitary confinement", "Not breeding dogs on every heat", "Exercise opportunities for every dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNot selling puppies before age 8 weeks.\n\n\tThe AWA provides very minimalist regulations. Under the AWA, breeding a dog on every heat is perfectly legal, and exercise does not need to be provided if a cage is at least twice as long as the dog is, plus 12 inches. \n"}, {"text": "Most puppies are sold directly from the puppy mill to the pet store.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, most puppies are sold to \"brokers,\" who gather together large numbers of pups, then sell them to pet stores. This adds even more stress to the lives of puppies, as they are thus shipped at least twice more. \rIn the United States, the largest broker is the Hunte Corporation, located in Missouri, the state that has more puppymills than any other. According to http://www.showmetheozarks.com/Templates/UpdatedStandardHeader.aspx?PostingID=537, the owner, Andrew Hunte, claims that God told him to create a puppy brokerage, and their website prominently features a Christian fish symbol. Hunte brokers over 1000 puppies a week, sending them to pet stores as far away as Japan. \r Hunte has been investigated for dumnping dead puppies and contaminating water- see http://www.petstorecruelty.org/Hunte%20Corp.htm \n"}, {"text": "The United States government provides financial assistance to puppy mills.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Hunte Corporation, for example, received a 3.5 million dollar loan from the USDA in 2000, and a $900,000 guaranteed rural development loan in 2001 from the USDA for purchasing equipment. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes, private individuals do sell puppies to pet stores. These puppies are good choices for family pets.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\t\"Private breeders\" may not rear their pups in excrement-filled cages, but their puppies are still prone to a myriad of problems. The purchaser has no way to check out the parents, know the backgrounds of the puppies, check their socialization, or otherwise do much investigation into their pasts. \n"}, {"text": "Which is not a usual fate of breeder dogs at puppymills when they are no longer needed?", "correct": "Being donated to rescue groups that find them good homes", "options": ["Being killed", "Trained for racing dogs", "Being sold at auction to other puppymills"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeing donated to rescue groups that find them good homes.\n\n\tWhen a puppy mill no longer needs a dog, it has no financial incentive to keep the dog alive. Thus, it is either killed (often by being shot) or trucked to an auction and sold to the highest bidder. I was informed by the staff of Puppymill Awareness Day, http://www.awarenessday.org/main.htm, that some millers in Lancaster are now \"donating\" their \"spent\" breeder dogs to rescue, but unfortunately, this is not a common practice. \n"}, {"text": "What happens to puppies in pet stores that do not sell before they grow too big to be cute?", "correct": "All of these can happen", "options": ["They are treated as \"sale merchandise\" and their prices are dropped until they sell", "They are shipped back to the puppymill to be used as breeders", "They are sent back to a broker and sold at auction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these can happen.\n\n\tPet stores demand a cute, tiny \"product.' If a pup gets too big, it is no longer \"cute.\" These pups are often returned to the dealer, which either sells the pups at auction, or ships them back to the originating mill, which can then use them as breeders. Sometimes, the prices are discounted deeply to try and \"move\" the pup. \n"}, {"text": "How big does the U.S. Department of Agriculture require a dog's cage to be, to be its legal lifetime living quarters?", "correct": "Six inches longer than the length of the dog from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail", "options": ["At least six feet long and three feet wide", "Dogs may not be kept in cages for their entire lives", "At least five times the length of the dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix inches longer than the length of the dog from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail.\n\n\thttp://www.kimtownsend.com/csusda.htm shows a very good diagram of this, with graphic illustrations of what it means to the dogs. \n"}, {"text": "Under U.S. law, dogs with painful physical defects, such as open sores, tumors, or severe wounds, must be removed from breeding programs.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe Animal Welfare Act has no such requirement, and dogs rescued from puppy mills often have horrific injuries. \n"}, {"text": "What tactic do unethical pet stores *not* use to encourage people to buy their puppies?", "correct": "Giving people honest information about the origin of their puppies, and the characteristics of the breeds that they sell", "options": ["Encouraging impulse buying by placing a cute, fluffy puppy in someone's arms", "Encouraging impulse buying by setting up interactions with the puppies", "Playing on people's sympathies for the puppies being in tiny cages"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGiving people honest information about the origin of their puppies, and the characteristics of the breeds that they sell.\n\n\tPet store owners know that impulse buyers are their main buyers, thus they set up situations to encourage such impulse buying, such as asking people if they want to hold a puppy, or allowing children to be \"puppy walkers.\" In addition, they know that people feel sorry for pups in small cages, and they encourage these sentiments, so that people will want to \"rescue\" the pup- in reality, just putting profit into the owner's pockets, and another puppy into the cage. \n"}, {"text": "As far as animal welfare groups are concerned, which of the following is an acceptable way to acquire a dog from a pet store?", "correct": "From a rescue group or shelter that runs adoptions at the pet store.", "options": ["From a puppy mill", "From a local breeder who sells puppies to the pet store", "From a puppy broker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom a rescue group or shelter that runs adoptions at the pet store.\n\n\tHere are some resources for learning more about pet shops and puppy mills:\rhttp://www.puppymillrescue.com/puppymill.htm\rhttp://www.stoppuppymills.org/\rhttp://www.nopuppymills.com/\rhttp://www.prisonersofgreed.org/\rhttp://www.puppymillprotest.org/definition.htm\rhttp://www.malteseonly.com/lemon.html\rhttp://www.turner.com/planet/promotions/puppies/prisoners.html\rhttp://www.awarenessday.org/main.htm\r This quiz was inspired by some notes I sometimes receive on some of my quizzes, stating that not all pet stores are bad places to buy puppies.
