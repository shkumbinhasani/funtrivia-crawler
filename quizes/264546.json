Philadelphia, PA) was initially given the singular honor of being the first man to reach the North Pole.  But it was actually his long-time colleague and navigator, Matthew Henson (b. Nanjemoy, MD), who Peary sent ahead as a scout when they were very close to the pole.  Henson overshot the North Pole, then traced his steps back, where he saw that his scout party's tracks had indeed made it to the pole.\r Henson, an African-American, was victim of the racism of the early 20th century, and not given credit for being party of the team that had reached the North Pole (much less being the first one actually there).  \r Finally, in 1944 Congress awarded Henson a silver medal, identical to that which was awarded to Peary years before.  Additionally, Presidents Truman and Eisenhower honored him. \n"}, {"text": "How many Eisenhower Interstate System highways (those numbered I-##) serve Charles County?", "correct": "0", "options": ["1", "2", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n0.\n\n\tNo Eisenhower Interstate System highways serve Charles County.
