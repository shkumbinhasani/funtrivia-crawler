Kinda boring...but hey, these characters were named in 1939.  Writers were more boring then.  =) \n"}, {"text": "Dick's parents were killed due to sabotage on the part of a gangster who was blackmailing the circus where the Graysons worked.  The last name of said gangster began with what letter of the alphabet?", "correct": "Z", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nZ.\n\n\tAnthony \"Boss\" Zucco was responsible for the death of two-thirds of The Flying Graysons: he ordered his men to tamper with the ropes of the trapezes, and, since John and Mary were working without a net, when the ropes broke, they fell to their deaths. \n"}, {"text": "Dick Grayson debuted as Robin, the Boy Wonder, in issue no. 38 of \"Detective Comics\" in 1939.  In what calendar year did he finally abandon that identity and take up the name \"Nightwing\"?", "correct": "1984", "options": ["1978", "1992", "1988"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1984.\n\n\tIn \"Tales of the Teen Titans\" no. 44 (July 1984), after having resigned as Robin a few months before, Dick returned to the super-hero scene with a whole new look, attitude, and name. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following heroes does NOT know that Nightwing's real name is Dick Grayson?", "correct": "Huntress", "options": ["Oracle", "Superman", "The Flash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHuntress.\n\n\tSuperman, a longtime confidant of Batman, knows that Dick was Robin; in fact, it's revealed in \"Nightwing Secret Files and Origins\" no. 1 (October 1999) that Dick took the name \"Nightwing\" from an ancient Kryptonian legend that Superman had once told him about!  Oracle, DC Comics' most reliable information broker, was once the first Batgirl...and since she and Dick have worked together for years -- and have been romantically involved, on and off -- she definitely knows his real name.  The Flash was once Kid Flash, Dick's compatriot in the original Teen Titans; since they're best friends, they've known each other's secret identities for years.\r The Huntress (Helena Bertinelli), despite having been...um...intimate with Nightwing, has no idea what his real name is. \n"}, {"text": "With which of the following heroines has Nightwing never been romantically involved?", "correct": "Troia (formerly Wonder Girl)", "options": ["Starfire", "Huntress", "Oracle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTroia (formerly Wonder Girl).\n\n\tDick was involved with Barbara Gordon years ago, when she was the first Batgirl, and they reunited in the 90's.  (Babs now goes by the name \"Oracle.\")  Dick and Princess Koriand'r of Tamaran (a.k.a. Starfire) were involved for many years during their tenure in the Teen Titans -- in fact, they were actually married for a short time.  Nightwing and the Huntress indulged in a brief, passionate, unsuccessful affair in the \"Nightwing/Huntress\" mini-series of 1998.  \r Dick and Donna Troy (a.k.a. Wonder Girl, Darkstar, Troia, etc.) have been very close friends for years, but they have never been romantically involved, much to the chagrin of certain readers. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following jobs has Dick Grayson never held?", "correct": "Martial arts instructor", "options": ["Police officer", "Landlord", "Bartender"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartial arts instructor.\n\n\tEven though no one in his apartment building knew it, Dick actually owned the Bludhaven building in which he and his immediate neighbors lived; this made him, by definition, a landlord, until the building was destroyed.  \r He has also worked as a bartender in Hogan's Alley, a Bludhaven watering hole frequented by corrupt police officers; and he later joined the Bludhaven police force in an attempt to attack corruption from within.  Despite his phenomenal combat skills, though, Dick has never been formally employed as a martial arts instructor. \n"}, {"text": "On occasion, Nightwing finds himself opposed by \"Batman villains\" from Gotham City, but he just as regularly faces a \"rogues' gallery\" all his own in Bludhaven.

Brutale made his debut in \"Nightwing\" no. 22.  Dudley Soames -- the corrupt Bludhaven cop who would become Torque in \"Nightwing\" no. 27 -- was first seen in \"Nightwing\" no. 1.  \r The boy who would grow up to be the adult assassin Shrike, however, first appeared in the \"Robin\" Year One\" mini-series of 2000. \n"}, {"text": "Nightwing once beat the Joker to death with his bare hands.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDick thought that the Joker had killed Robin III (Tim Drake) in \"Joker: The Last Laugh\" no. 6 (January 2002), so he rather uncharacteristically lost his temper and literally beat the Joker to death.  If no one had supplied the Joker with medical assistance, the clown prince of crime would have died right then and there...but Batman, of all people, revived the Joker with CPR.  He was only dead for a minute or two, but dead he most certainly was. \n"}, {"text": "Jason Todd, the second young man to become Robin (after Dick became Nightwing) was killed by the Joker.

He tried this technique on Bludhaven P.D. Inspector Dudley Soames; however, an enthusiastic group of surgeons got to Soames before he died, and managed to save his life.  Unfortunately, his head is now permanently \"backwards.\"  Soames got his hands on some special glasses that let him see \"behind\" him (well, in *front* of him, really!), and started calling himself Torque. \n"}, {"text": "We all know that Nightwing was once Robin, but he has gone by some other names as well.  Which of the following identities has Dick Grayson NEVER used?", "correct": "Vigilante", "options": ["Batman", "Renegade", "The Target"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVigilante.\n\n\tIn late 1994, Bruce Wayne asked Dick to stand in for him as Batman for a few months, and he agreed.  Years later, after being framed for murder as Nightwing, Dick came up with an all-new identity, The Target, so he could clear his name and continue to fight crime in Bludhaven without being hounded by the police (see the 2001 one-shot \"Nightwing: The Target\").  In 2005, Dick dumped his Nightwing identity again, changing his costume, working with Deathstroke the Terminator, and calling himself Renegade.\r Several people have used the alias \"Vigilante\" in DC Comics, but Dick has never been one of them. \n"}, {"text": "A severely troubled young man in Bludhaven, infuriated by injustice and inspired by Nightwing, became a masked vigilante as well.

In 2003, Nightwing became a charter member of the all-new Outsiders.\r Infinity, Inc. was mostly composed of the children of the original Justice Society of America.  Dick has never been a member of that team. \n"}]}
