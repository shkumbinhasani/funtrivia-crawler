In the beginning of the film, an entire family of tapirs are seen playing in a tar pit, and the dad yells to his children, \"Come on kids, you can play extinct later!\"  In another scene, one of the young tapirs randomly says, \"Sometimes, I throw up!\"  The other animals look at her, and continue their conversation.  Unfortunately, the tapir does not play a large role in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Quite a number of people will recognize Geoffrey the Giraffe as being the mascot for Toys R Us.  However, do you know what his name was before it was changed to Geoffrey the Giraffe?", "correct": "Dr. G. Raffe", "options": ["George the Giraffe", "It was Geoffrey from the beginning", "Giraffiti"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. G. Raffe\n\n\tDr. G. Raffe made his first appearance in the early 1950s on paper advertisements for Toys R Us.  He finally reached television sets in 1973.  In 1975, Geoffrey's wife Gigi was introduced, as well as two children: Junior and Baby Gee (used for Baby's R Us ads).  In 1999, though, his family was taken out of the spotlight, and Geoffrey became a kid himself to appeal to the child population even more than a grown giraffe with family.  In 2001, he was transformed again to become a real-life giraffe instead of a cartoon, and became a cartoon once again in 2007.\r He has most certainly had his fair share of transformations! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these mattress companies uses a sheep as its mascot?", "correct": "Serta", "options": ["Simmons", "Sleep Number", "Tempur-Pedic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSerta.\n\n\tSerta was created in 1931, with the merge of several companies, though it did not receive its name until 1933.  It took a long time for the famous Serta \"Counting Sheep\" to appear; it was in 2000 that they were introduced.  They became famous rather quickly, though, and in 2008 they were named the Advertising Icons of the Year. \n"}, {"text": "Coffee is a big business; there seems to be a shop around every corner.

Of course, it was not easy for him; all the horses made fun of him for entering a horse race.  What is the movie called?", "correct": "Racing Stripes", "options": ["Seabiscuit", "Madagascar", "Zebra Days"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRacing Stripes.\n\n\t\"Racing Stripes\" was released in 2005.  Stripes, the young zebra (Muniz), wanted nothing more to run in the Kentucky Derby.  The young horses never thought he could do it; his legs were shorter, and he was simply not cut out to run in a horse race.  His owner, Channing (Hayden Panatierre), was also given flak on the human side of things.  No one thought she could ride a wild zebra, especially not in a professional horse race.\r Of course, nothing would stop the pair, and the zebra did indeed race.  But as to whether he won or not, I'll let you watch the movie to find out. \n"}, {"text": "Many are familiar with the loveable warthog by the name of Pumbaa.

He also appeared \"The Lion King II\" (he was a favorite among fans, how could you leave him out?) as well as \"The Lion King 1 1/2\", which was the same story from Timon and Pumbaa's viewpoint.\r Poor Pumbaa suffered from horrible gas, though, which turned away everyone, including his family.  Timon did not care, however, because he was only a meerkat, and just about anything will eat a meerkat.  Therefore, he welcomed the stench, as it kept away even the most vicious of animals. \n"}, {"text": "Sly Cooper is a popular video game character, and he has many friends he meets along the way.

What is the name of his machine?", "correct": "Gazelle", "options": ["Reindeer", "Oryx", "Gemsbok"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGazelle.\n\n\tThe Gazelle was created by Tony Little as a full-body workout machine, though it mainly focuses on the legs.

This allows you to make it as intense as you see fit.  There are also handles to hold on to, if you want an arm workout as well. \n"}, {"text": "In the animated film \"The Emperor's New Groove\", the emperor turns into a llama.
