Who was the little girl?", "correct": "Pebbles", "options": ["Rockette", "Stoney", "Gravella"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPebbles.\n\n\tPebbles Flintstone is the daughter of Fred and Wilma Flintstone, all characters from the popular television show \"The Flintstones\".  Though the show never mentions a time or place of Pebbles' birth, it is reported by the producer that she was born at the Rockapedic Hospital in 10,000 BC.  This is interesting because most versions of the show are set at around 1,000,000 BC. \n"}, {"text": "March 9: On this day in 1959, a new toy swept the nation, and girls everywhere instantly fell in love with this new toy.  Later, this date would be used as the toy's official birthday.

This hobbit, played by Sean Astin, was a gardener.

You never know what you're gonna get.\" \n"}, {"text": "June 20: In 1901 a child was born.  However, in the 21st century, he is a 17-year-old boy.

As a vampire, Edward Cullen maintains the body of a 17-year-old, even though he's really been alive for much longer (vampires are immortal, after all).  Edward Cullen was played by Robert Pattinson in the \"Twilight\" saga films. \n"}, {"text": "July 1: In 1899, a very special archaeologist was born.

Who is this golden guy?", "correct": "Spongebob Squarepants", "options": ["Bart Simpson", "Homer Simpson", "Kyle Isalive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpongebob Squarepants.\n\n\t\"Spongebob Squarepants\" first aired on Nickelodeon on May 1, 1999.  In the show, Spongebob is known as being an adult who has failed his driver's test thousands of times.  However, in one episode, he is given a license (his teacher is fed up with him) and his birth date reads 1986.  This would mean that he was only 13 years old in the first episode of the show.  Perhaps, at the bottom of the ocean, 13 years is a longer time than it is above land. \n"}, {"text": "July 31: This world-famous character was born on July 31, which happens to be the same birthday as his creator.  Which character, who dons glasses, has this birth date?", "correct": "Harry Potter", "options": ["Severus Snape", "Ron Weasley", "Hermione Granger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Potter.\n\n\tHarry Potter was a character created by JK Rowling.  He appears in seven books (the \"Harry Potter\" series) as well as eight movies (again, the \"Harry Potter\" series).  He was given the birthday of July 31, as it was the birthday of JK Rowling, Daniel Radcliffe, and Richard Griffiths.  It was learned later, however, that Radcliffe's birthday was actually the 23rd, and it was just a publicity stunt to say it was the 31st.  There is contradiction as to what year Harry was born in, however.\r McGruff said it best when he answered the question \"When is Harry Potter's birthday?\" in this link.\r http://www.funtrivia.com/askft/Question64032.html \n"}, {"text": "200 BBY: On this date in the Star Wars Universe, a certain character was born on Kashyyyk.  He lived to be 204 years old.  Who was he?", "correct": "Chewbacca", "options": ["Yoda", "Han Solo", "Darth Sidious"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChewbacca.\n\n\tChewbacca was born in 200 BBY.  BBY stands for \"Before the Battle of Yavin\", which is used in the Star Wars Universe in a similar way that we use BC and AD.  Therefore, Chewbacca was born in 200 BBY, and 200 years later, it was year 0, which was the Battle of Yavin.  He lived for 4 years after this, and died in 4 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin).  Darth Sidious (Palpatine) was born in 82 BBY and died in 4 ABY (though his clones later died in 10 ABY and 11 ABY).  Han Solo was born in 29 BBY (though it is unknown what his death date was).  Yoda lived to 900 years old, as he was born in 896 BBY and died in 4 ABY.\r A day in the \"Star Wars\" Universe lasts a standard 24 hours, but each year lasts 368 days.\r As an interesting side note: \"Star Wars III\" kills off a large amount of Jedi in 19 BBY.  Obi-Wan Kenobi survived the Jedi attack in this year, and died in year 0.  However, he was only 57 at the time (though in the movies he appeared much older).\r Source: Wookieepedia, the official \"Star Wars\" Wiki. \n"}]}
