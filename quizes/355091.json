When he picks up the line, it's Barney calling from his place.  He just wanted to call about a brand new barbecue joint that's opened up in Springfield, Greasy Joe's Bottemless Bar-B-Q Pit.  The amazing part?  It's all you can eat!  Homer heads downstairs to ask Marge about the possibility of going on Saturday night and she decides to call her sisters to look after the kids.  She does, however, show a bit of worry as Homer said he'd limit his pork servings to six per week. \n"}, {"text": "Patty and Selma are able to look after the kids while Homer and Marge go to dinner, but only after which event?", "correct": "A wedding", "options": ["A christening", "A funeral", "A bar mitzvah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA wedding.\n\n\tWhen Marge calls her sisters at the DMV, they say that unfortunately, they have plans on Saturday evening to go to a colleague's wedding.  While Marge understands and prepares to leave it, her sisters say that they'll probably be out of there early on.\rWhen Saturday rolls around, Selma feels horrible.  Their colleague may have ended up with her instead of his new wife had Patty not been rude to him, forcing him out of her seat in the break room at work.\rThat evening, when Selma sings Lisa to sleep, it becomes clear that she's looking for a man and eager to find true love. \n"}, {"text": "According to Marge, who chose a life of celibacy?", "correct": "Patty", "options": ["Selma", "Grandpa Simpson", "Mrs. Bouvier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatty.\n\n\tWhen Marge and Homer return home after a filling meal, Homer has no choice but to call Barney.

That night, Marge wakes Homer up from his slumber to recall the possibility of a favour (for when he took the reins of their last vacation plans and went somewhere only he wanted to go).  She says that she wants him to find Selma a husband and Homer finds himself confused about which sister is which.  When she differentiates between the two, Homer assumes that Selma is celibate, but it's actually Patty who's celibate; Selma had celibacy thrust upon her.\rHomer agrees to the plan. \n"}, {"text": "Using sodium tetrasulfate, what does Bart spell out on the schoolyard lawn?", "correct": "BART", "options": ["EAT MY SHORTS", "COWABUNGA", "YOU SUCK"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBART.\n\n\tIn class, Bart and Martin team up to complete a science lab for Mrs. Krabappel and both receive a beaker of sodium tetrasulfate.

Bart gets an idea.\rAt work, Homer goes into 'man search mode' and tries to sort through the pros and cons of his co-workers, people at the Kwik-E-Mart, and elsewhere.

When Skinner forces Bart to call his father he ends up calling Moe's Tavern (where Homer is anyways) and prank calls asking for 'Homer Sexual'.  This leads to a fair bit of yelling before Skinner sets the record straight and brings Homer in for a chat. Skinner proposes that Bart fix Groundskeeper Willie's award-winning schoolyard by replanting the grass seeds.  Homer doesn't really listen to this though.  Instead Homer analyzes Skinner and figures that he's a good suitor for Selma.

Over their meal, Selma is visibly distraught while Patty is clearly uninterested.  When Patty is invited to a screening of \"Space Mutants: Part V\" the following night, Selma forces her to accept.

Groundskeeper Willie feels as though Bart will be back soon.\rThat evening, Skinner shows up at the Bouvier sisters' apartment with a box of candy and arrives to find Patty dressed up and ready to get the night over with.
