The title is only sung once, in a line that says \"obey Insect\". So no, it's not a song about a bug.\r Fun Fact: Voivod was formed in Jonquiere, Quebec, Canada. \n"}, {"text": "\"Apollo 2000 is ready for lift off\".\n\nDo you know the name of the song with these lyrics?", "correct": "Project X", "options": ["Project Q", "Project Z", "Project C"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProject X.\n\n\t\"Project X\" was the second track of the 1995 album \"Negatron\". The song is about people going to live in space because of the earth's destruction (Voivod is a metal band, after all, so destruction is a common theme), which is a mission apparently called \"Project X\".\r Fun Fact: The band's first successful album was 1989's \"Nothingface\", peaking at 114 on the Billboard 200 chart. \n"}, {"text": "\"Side effects of tunnel vision\".\n\nPerhaps you recognize the Voivod song with these lyrics?", "correct": "Nanoman", "options": ["iPodman", "Shuffleman", "Appleman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNanoman.\n\n\t\"Nanoman\", the third track from Voivod's 1995 album, makes no sense if you read the lyrics, so I won't even attempt to tell you what it is about. No really, it makes no sense. An empty cash register makes more cents (groan).\r Fun Fact: The 'character' found on many Voivod album covers is named Korgull. \n"}, {"text": "\"Whispering voice, is this the end?\"\n\nWhich song by Voivod do these lyrics belong to?", "correct": "Reality?", "options": ["Science Fiction!", "Romantic Comedy!", "Fantasy?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReality?.\n\n\t\"Reality?\" is the fourth track of the \"Negatron\" album, and is about how bad life really is, and what torment might be found beyond.\r Fun Fact: Original band members went by the names Piggy, Snake, Blacky, and Away. \n"}, {"text": "\"Speeding ion cruising along\".\n\nIf you paid attention to the name of the Voivod album this song is on, the answer should be easy.  What song is this?", "correct": "Negatron", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNegatron.\n\n\tOf course! The song is \"Negatron\", which, uncoincidentally, appears on the Voivod album \"Negatron\". It is the fifth track on the album. I was a bit surprised reading the lyrics; the song actually is about a negatron (or electron).\r Fun Fact: Snake's real name is Denis B\u00e9langer. He is the lead vocalist. \n"}, {"text": "\"Conflict, country vs. country\".\n\nThis is just one line of a long list of things that would exist on what?", "correct": "Planet Hell", "options": ["Bad World", "Unliveable Earth", "Ugly Land"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlanet Hell.\n\n\t\"Planet Hell\", the sixth track on the album \"Negatron\", is about the horrible things that would exist in a horrible future world (though most exist now).\r Fun Fact: Deceased guitarist, Denis D'Amour, is nicknamed Piggy. \n"}, {"text": "\"A shooting star crashing down\".\n\nThis song is not actually about a star; but a what?", "correct": "Meteor", "options": ["Meteorite", "Comet", "Flying Potato"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeteor.\n\n\tI am sure there is a song out there about a flying potato, but this song is actually about a meteor crashing to the earth and leaving a desolate wasteland behind. It is fitting, then, that the song is called \"Meteor\".\r Fun Fact: Blacky, the bass player, is really named Jean-Yves Th\u00e9riault. \n"}, {"text": "\"Living in a daze beyond belief, withdrawn from all that I know\".\n\nWhat kind of conspiracy is mentioned in the title of this song?", "correct": "Cosmic Conspiracy", "options": ["Cationic Conspiracy", "Comic Conspiracy", "Chocoholic Conspiracy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCosmic Conspiracy.\n\n\t\"Cosmic Conspiracy\", the eighth track from Voivod's \"Negatron\", is, not surprisingly, about a conspiracy. Why it's cosmic I'll never know. Interestingly, though, they only song \"conspiracy\" once, but \"cosmic\" twice; though they do not sing the two words together.\r Fun Fact: Michael Langevin, known as Away, was the band's original drummer. \n"}, {"text": "\"You'll never be the same, normal viewing distance\".\n\nWhat device is a hazard according to this song by Voivod?", "correct": "Television", "options": ["Toaster", "Computer", "iPod"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelevision.\n\n\tThe television rots the brain, wires your mind, and is, generally, viewed as a bio-hazard in the Voivod song \"Bio-TV\". In the song, television is considered \"harmful beyond belief\".\r Fun Fact: other members of the band include (but are not limited to): E-Force, Chewy, and Jasonic. \n"}, {"text": "\"I was born in the USA, I'm deformed by my DNA\".\n\nThis song is called \"DNA\". According to the song, what does DNA stand for?", "correct": "Don't No Anything", "options": ["Do Not Ask", "Deoxyriboneucleic Acid", "Daily Newspapers Annoy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon't No Anything.\n\n\t\"D.N.A.
