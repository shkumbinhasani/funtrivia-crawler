They began in the National Association before the National League even existed.  What was the franchise's first team name?", "correct": "White Stockings", "options": ["Blue Shoes", "Marlins", "Wranglers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite Stockings.\n\n\tThe franchise began in 1871 in the National Association as the Chicago White Stockings.  The team went defunct after the season, then came back in 1874 and 1875.  The NA league folded after the 1875 season.  The franchise then joined the new National League in 1876 with the same team name of White Stockings. With player-manager Al Spalding at the helm, the White Stockings won the very first National League pennant over the second place Hartford Dark Blues.  There were eight teams in the inaugural National League season.  In 1880, this Chicago franchise changed their name to the Colts, but went back to the White Stockings name in 1889.  1890 saw a new name, the Orphans, and that lasted until 1902, when after the season they changed their name to the Cubs. \n"}, {"text": "In which year did the Cubs go to their first Major League World Series?", "correct": "1906", "options": ["1978", "1880", "1949"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1906.\n\n\tThe Major Leagues began in 1901, and the first World Series was held in 1903.  The Cubs were the first team to go to three consecutive World Series 1906-07-08.  Under player-manager Frank Chance, they went to four in five seasons.

When he did it, he won 47.  Which decade did this occur in?", "correct": "1870s", "options": ["1920s", "1990s", "1950s"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1870s.\n\n\tThe name Al Spalding might have helped along with the high number of 47 wins(somewhat common for pre-1900 baseball).  Spalding won 47 in the first year of the National League in 1876 for Chicago.  Al won 55 the year before, but it was with the Boston Red Stockings of the National Association.  After Spslding's 47 wins for Chicago, John Clarkson went 53-16 for the White Stockings in 1885.  Clarkson won over 30 games for the White Stockings three times, but after Spalding's 1876 feat. \n"}, {"text": "When did the franchise move into the infamous ballpark of Wrigley Field?", "correct": "1916", "options": ["1979", "1877", "1953"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1916.\n\n\tWrigley is just as famous as Yankee Stadium by name in the baseball world.  The Cubs moved out of West Side Park II after the 1915 season to begin a new history at Wrigley.  The first night game at Wrigley, strangely enough did not occur until over 72 years later in 1988.  The ballpark went through many renovations in its time, including a capacity of 18,000 in 1916, to over 41,000 in 2006.  The first World Series at Wrigley Field was in 1918, when the Cubs lost to the Boston Red Sox and Babe Ruth. \n"}, {"text": "During the first 100 seasons of Major League baseball (from 1901-2000), how many World Series did the Cubs win?", "correct": "2", "options": ["6", "11", "17"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tThe Cubs went to 10 World Series, but won only two in 1907 and 1908.  Their last appearance in this 100-season span was in 1945 when they lost to the Detroit Tigers, four games to three.  Manager Charlie Grimm helped them to four World Series, but just couldn't cash in. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first Cub to hit 50+ home runs in a season?", "correct": "Hack Wilson", "options": ["Barry Bonds", "Sammy Sosa", "Roger Maris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHack Wilson.\n\n\tNeither Bonds or Maris ever played for the Cubs.  Sosa hit 50+ four times in a Cubs uniform, but it was Hack Wilson first, whose 1930 Cub season saw him hit 56 big ones to lead the league.  He had 208 hits and a batting average of .356, but didn't lead the league in either category.  There was also no MVP awarded in 1930.  Sosa hit over 60 home runs as a Cub three times. \n"}, {"text": "The Cubs had a well-documented and famous infield in their history who was noted for turning double-plays with a blink of the eye in the early 1900s.  Who were these three infielders?", "correct": "Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, Frank Chance", "options": ["Rogers Hornsby, Tris Speaker, Dom DeLuise", "John Roseboro, Gabby Hartnett, Vince Lombardi", "Bill Terry, Rogers Hornsby, Enos Slaughter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe Tinker, Johnny Evers, Frank Chance.\n\n\tThe other combinations never played for the Cubs.  The infamous saying by announcers, \"Tinker to Evers to Chance!\", was a phrase that went down in history.  Tinker was the shortstop, Evers the second baseman, and Frank Chance was their first baseman.  The other infielder who never received credit and was involved in many Cub double-plays was Harry Steinfeldt, their third baseman who replaced Doc Casey in 1906.  Steinfeldt was the icing on the cake that helped the Cubs' defense take the team to three consecutive World Series, beginning in 1906. \n"}, {"text": "This Cubs annnouncer broadcasted games until he was 82-years old, spanning five decades in the booth.  Who was he?", "correct": "Harry Caray", "options": ["Mel Allen", "Vin Scully", "Joe Garagiola"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Caray.\n\n\tHarry spent over 50 years for baseball in the media, doing games for St. Louis, Oakland, and both the White Sox and Cubs in Chicago.  He also did commentary for the NBA St. Louis Hawk games early in his career.  Harry had a 42-year streak of not missing a game until his stroke in 1987.  Harry died in 1998.

Who was the first Chicago Cub to win the Cy Young award in the team's history?", "correct": "Ferguson Jenkins", "options": ["Don Drysdale", "Tom Glavine", "Tom Seaver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFerguson Jenkins.\n\n\tNone of the others ever pitched for the Cubs.  Jenkins was the first Cub to win the prestigious award in 1971 with his 24-13 record.  Greg Maddux's first of four Cy Young awards was as a Cub in 1992, before signing as a free agent with Atlanta for 1993.  However, Maddux wasn't even the second Cy Young winner for the Cubs, as Bruce Sutter won it in 1979 with his 37 saves in the season.  Even still, Maddux wasn't even the third Cub to win the Cy Young.  In 1984, Rick Sutcliffe won it with his amazing 16-1 record. \n"}, {"text": "The Rookie of the Year award began in 1947, and Jackie Robinson of the Dodgers won the first award.  Which Chicago Cub won the award for his team first?", "correct": "Billy Williams", "options": ["Nobody has won it yet", "Steve Garvey", "Mike Nagy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly Williams.\n\n\tThe others never played for the Cubs.

Billy won the award over Joe Torre of the Braves and Cubs teammate Jack Curtis.  The Cubs had a tremendous roster in 1961 that included Ernie Banks, Ron Santo, Don Zimmer, and Williams.
