{"id": "360963", "name": "Croft Manor in \"Legend\" Trivia Game | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games T-Z", "Tomb Raider"], "questions": [{"text": "The purpose of exploring Croft Manor is to find certain objects, which are also hidden throughout the rest of the game, that give certain bonuses.  What are these objects called?", "correct": "Crests", "options": ["Discs", "Stars", "Cubes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrests.\n\n\tIn Croft Manor, there are a total of twenty-seven rewards, found in the form of \"crests\".  You can find sixteen bronze crests, ten silver crests, and a single gold crest scattered throughout Lara's mansion. \n"}, {"text": "You won't make it very far into the Manor without playing the first level of the game, in Bolivia.  Why is this?", "correct": "The doors don't open until a level is played", "options": ["You don't learn how to jump until you've been to Bolivia", "It's found at the end of the Bolivia level", "Croft Manor hasn't been built until you've played that level"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe doors don't open until a level is played.\n\n\tYou can explore Croft Manor whenever you want, even before you play any of the actual game.  However, the doors in Croft Manor will not open until after you have played at least one level (Bolivia is the setting for the first level of the game).  Once you have traveled to Bolivia, you can explore Croft Manor more thoroughly, now that there are places to go. \n"}, {"text": "You can explore all the rooms of Croft Manor if you'd like, but you cannot collect everything until you've collected some of your gear.  The first thing you should collect is the grapple, which can be found where?", "correct": "In the safe in the computer room", "options": ["In a locker in Lara's bedroom", "On the table in the study", "You don't need a grapple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the safe in the computer room.\n\n\tIn the computer room, there doesn't seem to be anything you can collect.  However, if you find a laptop on the ground, you can use it to open a safe on the wall in the room.  Inside the safe is the grapple.\r The pistols can be recovered in Lara's bedroom, in a locker on the wall (opened after pulling two swords).  When you arrive in the study, the flashlight is simply laying on a table in the room. \n"}, {"text": "After retrieving a flashlight, you can enter a dark corridor where part of the golden riddle can be found, as well as a secret passageway to Lara's room.  Where can the entrance to this corridor be found?", "correct": "Study", "options": ["Pool", "Gym", "Fireplace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStudy.\n\n\tWhen you are in the study, you retrieve two small bookcases.  These bookcases can be placed on two switches on the floor, which triggers something that causes the door to open.  In the corridor, you may need the flashlight.  Inside there are crates, and hidden in one of the crates is a bronze crest.  There is also a clue, the first of four that lead you to where the final crest is.  At the end of the corridor, there is a lion's head that opens up a door to Lara's room. \n"}, {"text": "In the pool area, there are some rewards below the water's surface.  After opening a few grates, you can swim inside a tunnel to retrieve a reward, but if you keep going, you will find yourself in another room of the manor completely.  What room is connected to the pool through the underwater tunnel?", "correct": "Gym", "options": ["Bathroom", "Bedroom", "Study"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGym.\n\n\tThis tunnel can come in very handy if you don't want to go all the way back through the hallways to get from room to room.  It is a convenient tunnel to use; if you have completed the pool area, you can head straight to the gym, and dry off in there with a little parkour. \n"}, {"text": "If you try to leave the Manor before you have a flashlight and your pistols, you are told to stay inside.  Once you find them, though, can you then leave Croft Manor to explore some of the secrets in the garden?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThough there are some \"Tomb Raider\" games that allow Lara to explore outside of the mansion (which can be dangerous, due to wolves lurking about), \"Legend\" is not one of those games.  This is simply an exploration level, and as such, there are no enemies (though you can die).  You also are not allowed to leave the Manor, which isn't a bad thing, since there aren't any crests out there anyway. \n"}, {"text": "The first clue to find the gold reward reads as follows:\n\n\"Above the Waters, Twin Sisters turn their backs one upon the other to leave the Ambages unguarded\".\n\nThis is referring to two statues that we earlier moved to cross swords.  Where are they located?", "correct": "Pool", "options": ["Gym", "Study", "Bedroom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPool.\n\n\tThese statues are located in the pool area, on the first balcony you get to when you climb to the top.  The statues can only be moved to this position after the clue is read.  When they have their backs to each other, the next clue is revealed behind the wall. \n"}, {"text": "The second part of the riddle tells us this:\n\n\"Within the Hall of Knowledge, Tomes of Cerulean, Topaz, Viridian, and Crimson in turn reveal their Arcanum\".\n\nFour things must be pushed in to reveal the third clue.  What are they?", "correct": "Books", "options": ["Levers", "Buttons", "Statues"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBooks.\n\n\tThe clue points us to the study, the \"Hall of Knowledge\" where tomes (or books), pushed in a certain order, show us the next clue.  First the blue book is pushed in, then the green, the yellow, and finally the pink book (cerulean, topaz, viridian, and crimson, respectively). \n"}, {"text": "The third riddle to find the golden reward goes like this:\n\n\"Above the Hearth, revealed visage and countenance touched in haste raise up the Steward\".\n\nTwo lion tongue switches need to be touched within a certain time limit to reveal the final clue.  There is a specific way that this needs to be done, but which of your tools will be helpful in doing so?", "correct": "Grapple", "options": ["Pistol", "Flashlight", "You need none of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrapple.\n\n\tThe grapple is a rather important device if you are to successfully activate the two tongue switches quickly.  The grapple needs to be used to pull down three poles that can be used to get from one side of the upper hallway to the other.  Without these poles, Lara would have to run all the way to the other end, down, up the other side, and back to the other side.  But she simply does not have the time for such nonsense.  With the poles pulled down, she can swing from one to the other quickly as she makes her way to the other side. \n"}, {"text": "The final clue tells us what to do with a certain statue that rises from the floor of the living room:\n\n\"The risen *insert Greek goddess here* turns to face the Sun, whose burden then reveals the Golden Laurel\".\n\nThere I go, obscuring a piece of information from the clue.  Whose statue is it that rises from the floor, that you must turn to face the window?", "correct": "Athena", "options": ["Hera", "Aphrodite", "Persephone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAthena.\n\n\tAthena's statue rises from the floor, and you must turn it to face the large window in the living room, just above the first bit of stairs. After you do this, you step on a pressure plate, which then activates a column that rises near the computer room. You can use the poles at the top of the hallway to get to it, where your precious gold crest is waiting for you,\r Victory is yours. \n"}]}
