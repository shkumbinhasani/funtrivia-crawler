What song does he remake during the film?", "correct": "\"Love is All Around\" by The Troggs", "options": ["\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" by Queen", "\"Lovers in a Dangerous Time\" by the Barenaked Ladies", "\"Puppy Love\" by Donny Osmond"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Love is All Around\" by The Troggs.\n\n\tThe film opens with Billy Mack in the recording studio, creating his new single, a rip-off of The Troggs' hit song, with a version he calls \"Christmas is All Around\".  The movie tracks Billy's progress with the single, appearing on radio interviews, television music shows, and elsewhere as he tries to promote it all the way to the No. 1 spot (past the single in the running by boy band, Blue, whose poster he defaces on live TV).  Somehow, Billy always manages to make things difficult for his manager, but in the end the two of them come to the realization that their platonic love for one another is what gets them through it.
