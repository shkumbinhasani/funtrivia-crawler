The bakers wanted to ensure they met the regulations at all times, never knowing when the inspector would arrive (and wanting to avoid the embarrassment of the pillory and a steep fine, not to mention a ruined reputation.) It was impossible to guarantee loaves of uniform weight in those days before automation, so a 13th item was added to every twelve as a little lagniappe (gift given to a purchaser) to push the weight comfortably into the safe zone. Thus \"a baker's dozen\" meant 13.
