When they get to that floor, Ceci and Mr. Murray get out of the elevator, but the doors close before Dahlia can walk out.  She has a flashback of her abusive mother picking her up from school, and soon the doors open. Mr. Murray starts telling them that there are bound to be a few puddles in the building because of all of the rainwater and they enter the apartment.  In Ceci's room, she complains that there's no air and the window doesn't open.  Ceci starts to look at the ceiling and notices a puddle forming in the corner of the room. The apartment is extremely small and it only has one bedroom.  While Dahlia and Mr. Murray continue to look at the apartment, Ceci leaves the apartment and goes to the roof to a large water tank.  Dahlia searches for her and sees someone enter room 10F, but when she checks the roof, she finally finds Ceci with a Hello Kitty bag.

Dahlia turns all of the water off (the sinks, shower, and toilet were overflowing) and Mr. Veeck pops out.  He says that he had no idea that there was so much going on in the apartment.

She follows them to the roof and finds the overflowing water tank.  Like Natasha did, Dahlia climbs the ladder and looks in the hatch.  Natasha ended up falling in and was never found.
