It was used for prisoner exchanges following the end of the Korean War in 1953. Prisoners taken to the bridge for exchange were given a final choice: stay where they were as a prisoner or return to their country of origin. The decision was final -- once the bridge was crossed, there could be no return.\r Between 1953 and 1968, more than 100,000 prisoners crossed the bridge, the vast majority returning to the northern side of the border. Following the murder of two US Army officers in 1976, the bridge was deemed too dangerous to use, but the North Koreans promptly built another bridge nearby, dubbed \"The 72-Hour Bridge\" (echoing how long construction took). The southern half of the Bridge of No Return is still sometimes used by the US Army for ceremonial purposes, and it has also featured in numerous cinematic productions (notably James Bond's \"Die Another Day\"). \n"}, {"text": "More than 20 countries have land borders with only a single neighbour.
