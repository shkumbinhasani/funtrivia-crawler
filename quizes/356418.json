{"id": "356418", "name": "Duck, Duck, Goose Trivia Game | Mixed 10 Questions | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Mixed 10 Questions", "        Mixed 10 Q. Average [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "Tomato, Tomato, Potato!\n\nIf calling kids ducks and geese never got your attention, naming them after vegetables might do it.  Which of these is a difference between tomatoes and potatoes?", "correct": "Tomatoes grow above the ground; Potatoes grow beneath it", "options": ["Tomatoes can be freeze-dried; Potatoes can not", "You can squish a tomato in your hand; You can not squish a potato", "Potatoes can be grown in the UK; Tomatoes can not"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTomatoes grow above the ground; Potatoes grow beneath it.\n\n\tTo be fair, there are probably a great deal more differences between tomatoes and potatoes than there are similarities (other than their names, of course).  Tomatoes, part of the nightshade family, are red (and occasionally green) foods grown in gardens on plants which produce their goods above the ground.  Tomatoes are fairly adaptable and are used in the production of sauces and ketchups around the world.  Potatoes are tubers which grow underground.  Another adaptable food, this vegetable is made into everything from vodka to French fries.  In fact, it goes well with ketchup.\rBoth can be freeze-dried; both can be grown in the UK; both can be squished (unripe potatoes can easily be squished though regular ones would be much harder).\rWhen playing this game, do not hit your children (or let them hit each other) with potatoes. \n"}, {"text": "Titanic, Titanic, Avatar!\n\nBattle of the blockbusters over here.  Which of these is a key difference between both of these films?", "correct": "Only one of the films was set entirely on Earth", "options": ["Only one was nominated for 'Best Picture' at the Oscars", "Neither film was made by the same director", "Only one of these films cracked $2,000,000,000 in the box office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly one of the films was set entirely on Earth.\n\n\tSet on a distant planet called Pandora and populated by an alien race known as the Na'vi, \"Avatar\" was the top-grossing film ever made upon its release in 2009, earning upwards of two billion, eight hundred million dollars in the international box office.  \"Titanic\" also cracked two billion dollars due to rereleases-- it was, at one point, the top-grossing film ever.  Both were directed by James Cameron (who also made \"True Lies\", \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", and \"Aliens\").\rWhile \"Titanic\" won 'Best Picture', \"Avatar\" lost the award during the 2010 Oscars ceremony to Kathryn Bigelow's \"The Hurt Locker\".  Coincidentally, Bigelow and Cameron were once married. \n"}, {"text": "North, North, South!\n\nWell, those are obviously different, right?  Which of these is a difference between north and south?", "correct": "Only one of the words is in the name of a Canadian province/territory", "options": ["Only one of the words is in the name of an Australian state/territory", "Only one of the words is in the name of a continent", "Only one of the words is in the name of a U.S. state"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly one of the words is in the name of a Canadian province/territory.\n\n\tThe only one to feature in the name of a Canadian province/territory is the Northwest Territories, one of the three territories in Canada's northern half.\r Both North and South America are continents containing the words.  Thus, there is more than one.  Likewise, there is a North and South Dakota and a North and South Carolina in the U.S.  In Australia, there is a Northern Territory and South Australia (and New South Wales). \n"}, {"text": "John, John, Paul!\n\nThis really only works when you have kids with these names in succession.  Which of these is a difference between John and Paul?", "correct": "Only one of the names appeared in the Gospels of the New Testament", "options": ["Only one of the names was a member of the Beatles", "Only one of them was in the name of a twentieth-century Pope", "Only one of them was a hurricane in 2006"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly one of the names appeared in the Gospels of the New Testament.\n\n\tOnly one of them is one of the Canonical Gospels-- John.  The four Gospels were Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark.  They were all allegedly written in the first century.\r John and Paul were two of the Beatles, specifically the songwriting duo Lennon and McCartney.  Lennon was the first Beatle to die; he was killed in the 1980s; McCartney continued to make music through the next several decades.\rOne of the Popes of the twentieth century was Pope John Paul II; he reigned 1978 to 2005 before he was proceeded by Pope Benedict XVI.\rBoth were also the names of major hurricanes which hit Mexico in 2006.  Paul hit in October causing over $3,000,000 in damages while John hit a month earlier in September causing over $60,000,000 in damages.  Both tracked along the south of the country. \n"}, {"text": "Taurus, Taurus, Mustang!\n\nWhich of these is a difference between these two obviously different things?", "correct": "Only one is a sign of the Zodiac", "options": ["Only one is the model of a car made by Ford", "Only one refers to an animal of any sort", "Only one refers to a mountainous location in Asia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly one is a sign of the Zodiac.\n\n\tOnly Taurus is a Zodiac sign, one of twelve, and it reigns between April and May.  Taurus is part of the Latin name for 'bull', bos taurus.  Mustang, on the other hand, is a breed of Horse originating in the United States.\rBoth of these animals is also the name of a Ford model.  They actually stand alongside the Ford Pinto and the Ford Bronco. Car companies have a bit of a track record with animal names, even in different languages.\rThe Taurus Mountains is a range in Southern Turkey while Mustang is a region in the Nepalese Himalayas. \n"}, {"text": "Five, Five, Ten!\n\nWell, five and ten certainly aren't the same number.  What's a difference between them?", "correct": "Only one is a composite number", "options": ["Only one appears on the face of a clock", "Only one is a multiple of five", "Only one uses a single letter for its Roman numeral"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly one is a composite number.\n\n\tA composite number is a number which is not prime.  In other words, it has more factors than simply one and itself.  Ten has four factors-- 1, 2, 5, and 10; five only has two-- 1 and 5.\r Both numbers are multiples of five.  Five can multiply by one to equal five while five can multiply by two to equal ten.  Both are single-digit Roman numerals; five is V while ten is X.  All numbers up to twelve appear on a clock face. \n"}, {"text": "Gold, Gold, Diamond!\n\nWell this is certainly a precious idea.  What's a significant difference between these two precious stones?", "correct": "Only one is on the periodic table", "options": ["Only one of them was a Jubilee celebrated by Queen Elizabeth II", "Only one is a sequel in the \"Pokemon\" video game series", "Only one is a traditional anniversary gift"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly one is on the periodic table.\n\n\tGold is recognized on the periodic table under the symbol Au; it's the seventy-ninth element on the table in the transition metal category.  Diamond, however, is not on the table because it's made of carbon.  Carbon appears on the table, but Diamond will not.\r \"Pokemon\" video games, for many, many years, were categorized by different colours.  The second generation of games featured \"Gold\" while the fourth included \"Diamond\".\rA gold anniversary is the fiftieth anniversary while diamond is given on the seventy-fifth.  In regards to the Queen's Jubilee, the fiftieth year of her reign (the Golden Jubilee) was in 2002 while the sixtieth (the Diamond Jubilee) was in 2012, the same year in which London hosted the Summer Olympics. \n"}, {"text": "Kings, Kings, Queens!\n\nThere must be a difference other than gender here.  What's not true about these?", "correct": "Only one appears in a typical game of checkers", "options": ["Only one is a major street in Toronto, Canada", "Only one of the two can be a victim of regicide", "Only one appears in a deck of cards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly one appears in a typical game of checkers.\n\n\tWhile kings and queens both appear in chess, only kings appear in checkers.  When one of your single pieces reaches to opposite end of the board, it can be kinged and travel in any direction to attack.\r Regicide is the murder of a king or queen while both monarchs are face cards in a standard 52-card deck.  Both King St. and Queen St. are major roads in Toronto, Ontario's capital city.  They are some of the oldest streets in the city and are home to some of its landmarks (including the theater district and Old City Hall).  Both streets are also found in Melbourne, Australia and London, England. \n"}, {"text": "Stars, Stars, Stripes!\n\nBy all means, different patterns, but what's the difference between them?", "correct": "Only stripes appear on the flag for Mauritius; stars do not", "options": ["Only stripes appear on the flag for the United States; stars do not", "Only stars appear on the flag for Norway; stripes do not", "Bill Murray only starred in a film called \"Stars\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly stripes appear on the flag for Mauritius; stars do not.\n\n\tWell, to begin, Bill Murray\" only appeared in \"Stripes\"; he did so in 1981, shortly after gaining fame on TV's \"Saturday Night Live\".  He went on to become one of the most famous comedic actors of the late twentieth century, also embarking on several Oscar-nominated dramatic roles.\r Stars and stripes are also popular patterns for flags.  The American flag uses both-- in fact, 'Stars and Stripes' is another name for the red, white, and blue flag.  The Norwegian flag uses a red background but has a white and blue cross.  Mauritius only has stripes, not stars.  There are four horizontal stripes, one red, one blue, one yellow, one green. \n"}, {"text": "Black, Black, White!\n\nBasic colours, but they're clearly different enough to be used in our game.  What's the difference between the two?", "correct": "Only one is a colour typically purchased for an ink printer", "options": ["Only one can be seen by dogs", "Only one belt colour is standard for students learning karate", "Only one appeared in the title of a 1991 single by Michael Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly one is a colour typically purchased for an ink printer.\n\n\t\"Black or White\", Michael Jackson's first single from \"Dangerous\", ended up charting at number one all around the world (including the Billboard Hot 100).  Black also happens to be a colour seen by dogs; dogs are typically regarded as colourblind and can only see in black and white (though this is untrue-- dogs can see several colours although with less intensity than humans).  Finally, karate belts range from a starting level at white to a master level at black.\r When purchasing ink for an ink printer (and other printers), one either needs to buy toner containing all different ink colours or they need to purchase them separately.  These are typically split into a single black cartridge and either a single colour cartridge or separate cyan, yellow, and magenta cartridges. \n"}]}
