It is no wonder then that the name 'Swahili' comes from the Arabic language.  What does it mean?", "correct": "The coast", "options": ["South wind", "Sun people", "Language of trade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe coast.\n\n\tIt makes sense that the Arabs would entitle this language 'the coast' when one realizes that the Arabs rarely moved inland in their trade relations with the people of Africa.  The language was simply a coastal language to the traders, and thus acquired this apt moniker.  By the way, the Swahili language owes much of its vocabulary to Arabic, from which it has borrowed profusely. \n"}, {"text": "Swahili is a member of which language family?", "correct": "Niger-Congo", "options": ["Afro-Asiatic", "Nilo-Saharan", "Khoisan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNiger-Congo.\n\n\tSwahili is the most widely spoken language within this language family which is often also referred to as Bantu. \n"}, {"text": "Swahili is an official language in all but which of these four countries?", "correct": "Ethiopia", "options": ["Kenya", "Uganda", "Tanzania"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEthiopia.\n\n\tIn Ethiopia, the official language is Amharic, while in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda a large number of people speak Swahili.  I think it's important to note that English is also an official language in the latter three countries. \n"}, {"text": "One character from Star Trek (I won't tell you which series) has a name that means 'freedom' in Swahili...but which one?", "correct": "Uhuru & Uhura", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nUhuru & Uhura.\n\n\tNichelle Nichols, the actress who portrayed Commander Uhura, chose this name for herself (the word is actually 'uhuru' in Swahili).

What is that word?", "correct": "Simba", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSimba.\n\n\tSimba was the name of the main character in Disney's 'The Lion King'.  The word has an interesting and widespread etymology and usage.  It is likely a borrowed word from the Sanskrit 'simha' via Arabic.
