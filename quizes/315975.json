Your mission is to break into the notorious Chocolate Vault.  I must warn you that the vault has twenty devious traps to keep you from the chocolaty treasure.  First, you must travel to Paris, where the entry to the vault has been located.  In Paris, under the 65ft (20m) tall Eiffel Tower by the eastern leg, you will find the entrance.  Remember, agent, you are looking for the big red hat!  Good luck agent 70000692.\"\n\nWhere must you go to find the entrance to the Chocolate Vault?", "correct": "Texas", "options": ["Tennessee", "Idaho", "France"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTexas.\n\n\tThe biggest hint here was the big red hat.  While there are many Eiffel Tower replicas found throughout the US' 17 cities named Paris, only one is topped with a giant red cowboy hat.  That would be Paris, Texas.  The Eiffel Tower replica from Paris, Texas was constructed in 1993, and in 1998 the big red hat was placed on top.  Of course, the original replica (neat oxymoron, huh?) of the Eiffel Tower was destroyed by a tornado, as it was originally made of wood.\r Salami: \"Congratulations, agent.

It's a good thing you came prepared.  You grab your weapon and fight.  He is the same kind of animal as Sabor from the 1999 film \"Tarzan\".  He uses his front claws and slashes at you, but he is no match for your weapon.  He pins you down.  However, you manage to free yourself before he goes in for his deadly attack.  You come out victorious!  What animal have you just fought?", "correct": "Leopard", "options": ["Crocodile", "Shark", "Komodo Dragon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeopard.\n\n\tBig cats usually attack with their powerful front claws, and once the prey is pinned down, a powerful bite is given to either crush the trachea or break the neck from the back.  In Disney's \"Tarzan\" (1999), Tarzan fights Sabor, a vicious leopard, several times throughout the movie.\r Boss: \"Good work, agent.

There are four doors blocking four different paths.  Behind three of these doors lies nothing but deadly fumes that will kill you.  Behind one of the doors lies the path you must take to stay alive.

If Door 1 was the right path, it would be telling the truth.  This means Door 3 would be lying, because it is a false door.  Therefore, Door 3 is NOT telling the truth, so 1, therefore, is also lying.  Door 3, who is lying, says that Door 2 is the correct door to take.  This means, obviously, that Door 2 is not the right door to take.  We can now already assume that the remaining door, Door 4, is telling the truth.  But moving on, if Door 2 is lying, he is lying about Door 4 lying.  Therefore, Door 4 is telling the truth.  Door 4 says Door 1 is lying, which it is, so we know, as a fact, Door 4 is the correct door to take.\r Boss: \"Agent, are you dead yet?  If not, congratulations!

You shall not pass.\"  At first you thought he said his name was John Wayne.  Your mistake.  This agitates Chon, and he begins to attack!

Jackie Chan also stars in \"Rush Hour\" with Chris Tucker.\r Exhausted, you sit down and rest after the holographic Jackie Chan-like ninja's defeat.  You wonder how it could get any worse than that.  You think out loud to yourself \"At least it can't get much harder.\"\r Salami: \"Oh, but it can, and it will.

The second most famous local water monster is Morag, which is a pun of the name of the loch.  Nessie gained popularity in the 1930s, and other water monsters, like Morag, were quickly overshadowed by the beast of Loch Ness.\r Salami: \"Very good, agent.

Archeologists also believe there are many more pits yet to be discovered.\r That was easier than you expected.  It turns out, all you needed to do to pass was flip the switch that turns all of the Terracotta Army back to stone.  You also discover that Salami hadn't stolen the statues; they were all exact replicas.

Theseus, however, was given a ball of string by Ariadne, and he took out a sword he hid from the guards, and went into the labyrinth to kill the minotaur.\r You come to find there was no minotaur; it was just a false alarm.  There was, however, a kitten, who proved to be a nuisance, because he kept playing with the ball of string you brought!\r Salami: \"I used the exact pattern of the labyrinth in Greek myth, but I could not afford a minotaur; that is so embarrassing...

It is also a minor language in Croatia, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, among others.\r Isn't that peculiar--a Serbian Siberian tiger?  How odd.  She was a fierce competitor, but you finally manage to defeat Tigress.  She certainly was not lying when she said she was the greatest.  Way better than the holographic Jackie Chan.\r Salami: \"What... No way have you defeated Tigress!  She was unbeatable!  No no no no no no no!  This can't be!  How did you avoid her spiraling flame attack of death?\" \n"}, {"text": "You run into the next room, and in front of you stands Salami.\n\nSalami: \"What? You made it through all 20 challenges?  Very well.  I suppose I will just deal with you myself.  Mwahahahaha!\"\n\nSalami transforms himself into the exact beast Dr. M. transformed himself into in a video game.  It is all becoming clear to you.  Salami is trying to copy a \"Sly Cooper\" video game!  The vault, with its many challenges, followed by fighting Salami himself, is the same spider contraption as Dr. M, all for the treasure inside the vault.  In which Sly Cooper video game does this appear?", "correct": "Honor Among Thieves", "options": ["Thieving Fiends", "Thievius Raccoonus", "Band of Thieves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHonor Among Thieves.\n\n\tDr. M is the main enemy of Sly Cooper in \"Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves\".  Dr. M has found Kaine Island, and has tried desperately to enter the vault where the Cooper Clan keeps storing their stolen treasure.\r \"Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves\" was released in 2005 for the PS2.  \"Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus\" is the first in the series, released in 2002.  \"Sly 2: Band of Thieves\" was the second in the series, released in 2004.\r With Salami finally defeated, you can now head back to collect your chocolate.  Fortunately for you, the only part of \"Sly 3\" that Salami didn't copy was the entire vault collapsing, closing it off forever. \n"}, {"text": "You have finally reached the chocolate.  In front of you, to your sides, behind you is Chocolate Heaven.  Even the gently flowing waters are made of pure chocolate.  The chocolate waters are kept constantly the same temperature so they do not lose their sheen when cooled.  All the chocolate in the entire room has been tempered beautifully.  What is the ideal temperature to temper chocolate?", "correct": "88F (31C)", "options": ["200F (95C)", "120F (49C)", "167F (73C)"], "explanation": "\n\n\n88F (31C).\n\n\tIf you keep chocolate at 88F (31C) while forming, spreading, mixing, etc, then let it cool in the shape you want, the chocolate will harden perfectly, and have a nice sheen to it.  If cooled without tempering first, the chocolate will set, but not as hard as one would probably like.  It will still be soft, and it will not have the shine; it will be dull in appearance, and it will have a greasy layer on it.  This is certainly not wanted if you are to have chocolate treasures!  At 200F (95C), chocolate will burn.\r Salami comes hobbling in: \"Congratulations, agent.  I see that I cannot stop you.  Take as much chocolate as you want, but please, do not share your chocolate with anyone else.  They have to try to get it themselves.\" \n"}]}
