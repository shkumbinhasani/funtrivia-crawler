Which vessel?", "correct": "the SARATOGA", "options": ["the YORKTOWN", "the LEXINGTON", "the GETTYSBURG"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe SARATOGA.\n\n\tThe captain identifies her vessel as the SARATOGA quite clearly. \n"}, {"text": "The captain of the first Starfleet vessel we see paralyzed by the probe is a woman.

You go, girl! \n"}, {"text": "The woman who played the captain of the first Starfleet vessel we see disabled by the probe would later play the mother of one of the characters from a \"Star Trek\" television series.  Which one?", "correct": "Geordi LaForge, from \"The Next Generation\"", "options": ["Travis Mayweather, from \"Enterprise\"", "Benjamin Sisko, from \"Deep Space Nine\"", "Tuvok, from \"Voyager\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeordi LaForge, from \"The Next Generation\".\n\n\tMadge Sinclair played Silva LaForge -- another female starship captain, this time of the USS HERA -- in exactly one episode of \"ST:TNG\", called \"Interface.\"  Born in Jamaica, Sinclair sadly died of leukemia in 1995. \n"}, {"text": "Back on Earth, the Klingon ambassador (John Schuck) has some harsh words to say about Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner).  Which of the following names does the ambassador NOT call Kirk during his heated tirade?", "correct": "racist", "options": ["devil", "renegade", "terrorist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nracist.\n\n\tAs Kirk's image is freeze-framed behind him, the ambassador bellows, \"Behold the quintessential devil in these matters -- James T. Kirk, renegade and terrorist!\"  Kirk wasn't called a racist at all. \n"}, {"text": "The Federation Council President (Robert Ellenstein) attempts to pacify the Klingon ambassador by noting that Kirk has been charged with a number of violations of Starfleet regulations.  How many?", "correct": "nine & 9", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nnine & 9.\n\n\tOddly enough, when charges are being read at the end of the film, only SIX are listed!  (Oops.) \n"}, {"text": "According to the first \"captain's log\" we hear from Admiral Kirk, how much time has elapsed between the end of \"Star Trek III: The Search For Spock\" and this film?", "correct": "three months", "options": ["two months", "six months", "five months"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthree months.\n\n\tKirk refers to the \"third month of our Vulcan exile.\"  About two years passed for those of us watching the movies, but within the storyline, time is a funny thing.  =) \n"}, {"text": "The first time we see Spock (Leonard Nimoy), he is being subjected to rapid-fire quiz questions from a multi-tasking, multi-screen computer.  Which discipline is NOT covered by any of the questions Spock is being asked?", "correct": "marine biology", "options": ["chess strategy", "archaeology", "chemistry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmarine biology.\n\n\tSpock is asked to win a chess game, to identify a Klingon artifact of archaeological significance, and to provide \"the molecular formula of yominium sulfide crystals.\"  Nothing about marine biology, despite the events of the rest of the film. \n"}, {"text": "The woman who plays Spock's mother in this film is the same woman who played Spock's mother in the original series episode \"Journey To Babel.\"", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tJane Wyatt played Amanda Grayson in both the \"TOS\" episode, and this film. \n"}, {"text": "Meanwhile, back on Earth, we see a character named Admiral Cartwright advising the Federation Council President at Starfleet Command.

Saavik (Robin Curtis) has a brief appearance at the beginning of this film.  True or False: This scene is the last time Saavik was ever seen in any \"Trek\" movie or television episode.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSaavik never again made an appearance on TV or in the films.  Robin Curtis played a different character in a two-part episode of \"TNG,\" but that was it.  Interestingly, Leonard Nimoy's DVD commentary mentions that the reason Saavik stayed behind on Vulcan in this film is because, in an early draft of the script, she was pregnant with Spock's baby!  This idea was never officially noted in any film or episode, though, so the \"Spock love child\" sub-plot remains another unexplored avenue of \"Trek\" history. \n"}, {"text": "On their way back to Earth from Vulcan, Kirk and his crew receive a message from the Federation Council President.  Boiled down to its essence, what is the main point of the President's message?", "correct": "\"Stay away!\"", "options": ["\"Save us!\"", "\"Find the whales!\"", "\"Destroy the probe!\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Stay away!\".\n\n\tThe President has no idea that whales are the solution to the disaster, and he seems convinced that NOTHING can destroy the probe.  He doesn't ask for any kind of rescue; on the contrary, he warns any ship within the sound of his voice to \"avoid Earth at all costs!\" \n"}, {"text": "Spock deduces that the probe's message is meant for whales.  What kind of whales?", "correct": "humpback", "options": ["blue", "pilot", "sperm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhumpback.\n\n\tAt Kirk's request, Uhura manipulates the probe's destructive \"song\" to the effect that the crew can hear what it would sound like underwater.  Some quick follow-up research by Spock supports the conclusion that the probe's message is perfectly analagous to the songs sung by humpback whales. \n"}, {"text": "As the probe reaches Earth, we see some familiar characters at Starfleet Command.  Who is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch)", "options": ["Sarek (Mark Lenard)", "Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney)", "Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett Roddenberry)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarol Marcus (Bibi Besch).\n\n\tRand and Chapel are seen for about two seconds apiece, but Sarek has several lines of dialogue, and even advises the President to declare a state of emergency.  Carol Marcus, the mother of Kirk's late son David, made no other appearances after \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982) -- she's nowhere to be seen in this film. \n"}, {"text": "During the chaos at Starfleet Command as the probe nullifies electromagnetic systems and wreaks meteorological havoc, a female officer's face is visible on one of the huge viewscreens in the background.

I was born there.\"  Which one?", "correct": "Sulu", "options": ["Uhura", "Kirk", "McCoy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSulu.\n\n\tIn the original script, Sulu even runs into a young boy who will become his great-great-however-many-great-grandfather...but the scene never wound up in the film, because Nimoy couldn't get a usable take -- the young boy playing the role simply would not stop crying! \n"}, {"text": "Who are the two witnesses to the cloaked BOUNTY's landing on Earth?", "correct": "sanitation workers", "options": ["middle-aged joggers", "homeless men", "teenage lovers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsanitation workers.\n\n\tTwo men working a sanitation truck are nearby when the invisible BOUNTY causes a great deal of atmospheric disturbance and leaves giant \"footprints\" in the grass...but they flee the scene, pretending to have seen nothing.  (We see some joggers when the BOUNTY *leaves* the park near the end of the film, but not when it arrives.) \n"}, {"text": "In what California city do Kirk and Spock eventually find the whales they seek?", "correct": "Sausalito", "options": ["San Diego", "Anaheim", "Torrance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSausalito.\n\n\tThe fictional Cetacean Institute is located in Sausalito, CA. \n"}, {"text": "In one of the funniest scenes in the film, Kirk and Spock encounter an obnoxious punk rocker with a mohawk and thunderingly loud \"boom box\" on a city bus.  The man playing this role also worked on the film's production.  What was his \"other\" job?", "correct": "associate producer", "options": ["best boy", "director of photography", "co-screenwriter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nassociate producer.\n\n\tKirk Thatcher not only played the part of \"Punk On Bus,\" he also co-wrote and sang lead vocals on the song \"I Hate You\" that blares from his boom box.\r Stay tuned for part two of this quiz! \n"}]}
