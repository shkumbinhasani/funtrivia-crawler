{"id": "357053", "name": "Making Chili With Salami Quiz | Food & Drink | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "Food & Drink", "Mixed Food and Drink"], "questions": [{"text": "Using a large pot is best, if you make as much chili as I do!  The first thing I do is put a bit of EVOO in the pot as it heats up to medium-high heat.\n\nWhat is EVOO?", "correct": "Olive oil", "options": ["Water", "Butter", "Lard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOlive oil.\n\n\tEVOO, a term coined by Rachael Ray, is an abbreviation for extra virgin olive oil.  I prefer using olive oil over butter, margarine, or lard, when making chili because it doesn't give the chili an odd taste.  The olive oil also acts as one of the many liquid elements of the chili.  This is good because the olive oil becomes infused with flavors during the cooking process that make the liquid delicious. \n"}, {"text": "Finely minced garlic is the first thing added to the EVOO so it can start roasting to extract all the delicious flavors of the garlic.\n\nTo get the garlic minced, which of these would be the best tool to use?", "correct": "Garlic press", "options": ["Cheese grater", "Egg slicer", "Potato masher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarlic press.\n\n\tNaturally, the best tool to use would be the one made specifically for the garlic.  A garlic press is used to push garlic through several blades, which minces the garlic.  It also extracts the garlic juices, which will help infuse the olive oil with the flavor.\r Cheese graters may work, but it may not yield as accurate results (and may result in a bit of blood in the chili), egg slicers are too large a piece of garlic, and potato mashers would mush the garlic more so than mince it.\r Now that the olive oil is hot, cook the garlic for a while.  Let the garlic brown and infuse the oil with all its wonderful flavors and aromas. \n"}, {"text": "Meat is super important to making a good batch of chili.  I prefer a pound and a half of lean ground beef, but sometimes I make chili for a certain group of people, and they prefer an even healthier alternative.\n\nWhich of these meats is a good replacement for beef if you want a healthier chili?", "correct": "Ground turkey", "options": ["Ground cricket", "Ground chorizo", "Ground tuna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGround turkey.\n\n\tGround turkey is known to be a good replacement for ground beef if one is looking for a healthier alternative.  Ground turkey is much leaner, and if cooked right, one can hardly tell the difference between it and beef.\r Of course, I prefer using beef because I do like some fat in the meat; the juices cook and infuse themselves with the oil and garlic, and that is what creates some of the liquid's main flavors. \n"}, {"text": "While cooking the meat, I add almost all of the special herbs and spices (I also like to add jalapeno now) to the pot.  I like to make the meat flavorful; I much prefer flavorful food in a flavorful broth instead of bland meat in flavored broth.\n\nWhen the meat is fully cooked, it is important NOT to drain the pan of all the excess fat.  What is the main reason for this, based on the method used in the first paragraph to cook the meat?", "correct": "Draining the meat also drains much of the flavor", "options": ["Draining the meat dries it out too much", "Draining the meat is illegal in some locations", "Draining the meat is dangerous, as you may accidentally lose the meat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDraining the meat also drains much of the flavor.\n\n\tYou do not necessarily need the liquid from the cooked meat to make the chili liquidy; that will also come from the beans.  However, since the meat has been seasoned, most of the herbs and spices are in the fat and olive oil in the pan.  Draining the meat now would mean draining all that delicious, spicy goodness as well. \n"}, {"text": "Tomatoes are integral to a good pot of chili.  I don't chop my own, however; I prefer using tomatoes from a can (two cans, in fact).\n\nThere are many kinds of canned tomatoes, but which of these would not be such a good idea to use for a pot of chili?", "correct": "Canned salsa", "options": ["Stewed tomatoes", "Diced tomatoes", "Tomato paste"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanned salsa.\n\n\tThough some canned salsas are delicious, they aren't meant to go into chili.  Diced tomatoes are best (I prefer the roasted garlic flavored tomatoes), and stewed tomatoes can also be used.  Tomato paste is sometimes added for a sweeter tomato flavor.\r In any case, now is a good time to cook the meat and tomatoes together for a while.  The tomatoes are much better if cooked with the meat instead of adding them with all the beans. \n"}, {"text": "I like to add eight cans of beans to my chili, and I use several different kinds of beans among the eight cans.\n\nI like color, so I usually have one can of black beans and one can of white beans.  There are at least three kinds of white beans, each with a slightly different flavor.  Which of these four is not white or cream in color?", "correct": "Kidney beans", "options": ["Navy beans", "Great Northern beans", "Cannellini beans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKidney beans.\n\n\tThere are so many beans to choose from, and many of the varieties are white or cream in color.  Though all three listed would be fine in chili, the best to use are great northern beans.  They adds a bit of a nutty flavor to the chili.  Typically, I use one can of these white beans, one can of black beans, two cans of pinto beans, two cans of dark kidney beans, and two cans of chili beans.  Chili beans are nice because they are seasoned wonderfully, and add a great flavor to the chili.\r Since beans are packaged in liquid, this is the time to drain your ingredients.  How thick you want your chili will determine how much you drain your beans.  Personally, I drain all of the white beans, none of the black or chili beans, and about half of the remaining beans.  Remember: It's important not to drain your chili beans because these beans are in a seasoned liquid, and not just water.  They bring out a great flavor to the chili! \n"}, {"text": "I have a lot of friends who do not eat gluten, so I have to be careful with some of the ingredients I use.  Of the choices below, which is one that I need to pay attention to the most to prevent my chili from containing gluten?", "correct": "Garlic powder", "options": ["Ground meat", "Fresh jalapeno", "Herbs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarlic powder.\n\n\tMaking chili for gluten free friends is very easy.  There are a few things you need to pay attention to, but generally using fresher ingredients solves the gluten issue.\r For instance, when choosing your beans, it is wise to make sure it is only beans in the container.  Black beans and chili beans, for instance, are usually canned with special seasonings and sauces that contain traces of gluten.  Flavored tomatoes are the same way, and the ingredients may need to be checked.  Most pure herbs and spices are fine, but some, like seasoned salt and garlic powder, may contain other additives that have gluten.  Generally, garlic salt is fine, but garlic powder may contain gluten to expand the garlic powder.  If using fresh jalapenos and herbs, gluten is not an issue.  Ground meat typically does not contain gluten additives, and should be fine.\r Another thing you may want to be wary of is cross-contamination.  Typically, someone who is very sensitive to gluten can get sick with certain utensils.  For instance, do not use a wooden spoon to stir the chili if you've used the spoon before.  The wood soaks in the gluten and transfers it from dish to dish.  Plastic, metal, and unused wood utensils are all fine. \n"}, {"text": "Before serving the chili to my party of friends, I always make sure I fish out one of my ingredients and get rid of it completely.  I certainly don't want my guests biting into it and ruin their appetite for the meal!\n\nWhich of these is a good idea to remove from the chili before serving?", "correct": "Bay leaf", "options": ["Black bean stones", "Jalapeno seeds", "Uncooked ground meat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBay leaf.\n\n\tIf you use bay leaves in a dish, it is often wise to remove them before serving the meal.  The bay leaf gives a wonderful flavor to a pot of chili during the cooking process, but eating one can be dangerous.  Some believe it is poisonous, but this is actually not the case.  The reason for not eating a bay leaf is because it is somewhat barbed, and swallowing can be extremely difficult. Whether the entire leaf or little chunks, the leaf tends to stick to the throat and cause great irritation.  Some companies do sell ground bay leaf, however, which is fine.  It is ground so well that there is no worries about it getting stuck in the throat on the way down to the stomach. \n"}, {"text": "I like to have quite a few fixings with my chili for people to put on top.  Sometimes I use cornbread.  To add a little extra flavor to the cornbread, though, I like to put chunks of stuff in the batter before baking.\n\nIf I intend to put this cornbread in my chili, which is perhaps a wise ingredient to avoid putting in the cornbread?", "correct": "Raisins", "options": ["Zucchini", "Jalapenos", "Corn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaisins.\n\n\tCornbread is wonderful in chili, and when you make the cornbread with real corn pieces, it's even better.  You can experiment and add all sorts of ingredients in the cornbread as well.  Zucchini is actually really good in chili, so putting it in the cornbread is a delicious choice.  Raisins, however, are not too good in chili.  While there may be nothing wrong with raisins in cornbread (with a little honey on top to make a sweet side), it may not be the best choice in a hearty bowl of chili. \n"}, {"text": "Chips and cheese are also something commonly put in chili to make it super delicious.  Though it may be possible to use all sorts of cheese in a bowl of chili, some cheeses would be a foolish choice.\n\nWhich of these options would be the best cheese to use in your hearty meal?", "correct": "Cheddar", "options": ["Edam", "Gouda", "Feta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheddar.\n\n\tCheese is wonderful in chili, and many varieties will work. Cheddar is perhaps the most common chili cheese; the flavor pairs well with the chili and it melts well. Other cheeses are great in chili as well, such as those found in the \"Mexican blend\" cheese mix.\r Generally, hard cheeses are not good for use in chili, and some cheese with overpowering flavors are not either.\r  Do you like an added crunch to your food? Try adding corn chips or crackers along with the cheese. \n"}]}
