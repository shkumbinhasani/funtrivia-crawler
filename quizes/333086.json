{"id": "333086", "name": "Fix You Quiz | Computers | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Computers", "The Internet"], "questions": [{"text": "If the Digital You is influenced by your Twitter account, then so be it.  You seem to be having a problem posting (or 'tweeting') a message about your life that is 300 characters in length.  How do you fix this?", "correct": "Shorten your Tweet to 280 characters in length", "options": ["Change the subject matter.  Twitter does not allow Tweets about real life for privacy's sake", "Remove all the punctuation marks- Twitter can't read these", "Create a new account; you've reached your Tweet limit and have been automatically rejected"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShorten your Tweet to 280 characters in length.\n\n\tThe catch when using this rapid-fire social networking site is that all 'Tweets' must be (at the maximum) 280 characters in length, so to fix this, you'll need to be a bit more concise.  This ensures that your Tweets are both straight-to-the-point and quick to make them that way.  All posts, all replies, and all reposts must follow this guideline in order to be posted. To take a fairly long link and place it into your Tweet, there are a number of handy solutions out there including URL shorteners to make any lengthy link a short forwarding URL.  Many celebrities have also taken to the Twitterverse, and users can follow friends, famous faces, and family as well as update on the fly with mobile devices if they aren't near a computer. Twitter is perhaps one of the fastest and foremost methods of what's deemed social grooming.  Because of the vast number of Twitter users and the speed at which items can be posted, it's no surprise that a large percentage of Tweets are pointless babble (according to research done by Pear Analytics in 2009). \n"}, {"text": "You decide to log into MSN or Windows Messenger for the evening to chat online.  When you type your email, the Digital You is unable to log in.  This shouldn't be a problem that needs to be fixed unless your email ends with which of these?", "correct": "@apple.com", "options": ["@live.com", "@msn.com", "@hotmail.com"], "explanation": "\n\n\n@apple.com\n\n\tAlthough MSN (which stands for the MicroSoft Network) does play host to a number of email domains, @apple.com is not one of them as Apple has been a rival to Microsoft for many decades.  As such, if the Digital You requires a chat account through MSN or Windows Live Messenger, a new account must be made if you do not use @live.com, @msn.com, or the ever-popular @hotmail.com. All of these are Microsoft-owned and operated and will provide for a fairly basic and well-known email system.  Mac-owners don't get exiled though.  While MSN Messenger isn't typically for use on Macs, programs like Adium serve the same purpose...though you'll still probably need one of the listed domains. Since MSN Messenger began in 1999, it has been a home to hundreds of millions of different accounts over its first decade of operation.  Hotmail has actually been around since 1996! \n"}, {"text": "You find a picture of yourself on Facebook that has yet to be tagged in an album created by someone who is not your friend.  You want to tag yourself and enhance the image of the Digital You, but you find that the tag is not responding.  How can this be fixed?", "correct": "It can't- the user who owns the album must approve of the tag for privacy's sake", "options": ["You can't- image tagging is not possible on Facebook", "You are unable to tag images without a gold account", "You need to be tagged by someone else for any picture to verify that you are who you say you are"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt can't- the user who owns the album must approve of the tag for privacy's sake.\n\n\tWhile the Digital You can be shaped by your photographic image, reaching certain ones may be a hassle.  If a non-friend has albums containing your face, they can tag them and you will be able to view them/add them to your repertoire which is searchable from your profile.  If you don't happen to know the person, however, you may not even be able to enter their profile let alone their album.\rWhen you tag an image on Facebook, you must be tagging either your own images (in which case you can either tag someone you already have as a friend) or you can make a name for someone if you don't happen to have them connected to you via profiles.  You can also tag people found in friends' albums, but they can set whether or or not they must confirm each tag.  You can only take your profile picture, the image of the Digital You, from images in which you are tagged, images from your own albums, regardless of if your in them or not, or images you directly upload for this purpose. \n"}, {"text": "Your avatar in \"Second Life\", the online virtual reality game, is in need of some changes.  Most importantly, you want your avatar to have a large expanse of land upon which he can live comfortably.  How can you fix your Digital You's problem?", "correct": "Purchase some land (but only in US currency)", "options": ["Upload a picture of your ideal landscape to be recreated in-game", "Win the land in online draws created hourly on the \"Second Life\" servers", "Create a second avatar; land can only be purchased if your avatar has a twin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPurchase some land (but only in US currency).\n\n\t\"Second Life\" signifies exactly what it sounds like: a parallel digital world where you create an avatar to represent a 'Digital You'.  Your clothes, your appearance, and your life are constructed as per your liking- you don't even need to be human.  Your property is just another way of shaping your alternate identity, but the creators of this site have realized peoples' tendency to want to live their dream life and some elements must come at a cost. Surprisingly, some companies and users have profited millions from selling items on \"Second Life\" for use in their first lives.  \"Second Life' launched in 2003 and quickly became a second home for over twenty million different users. \n"}, {"text": "The Digital You keeps up appearances through a personalized HTML-based webpage.  You feel that your text doesn't stand out enough to convey who the Digital You could be.  What tag is used to bold text on your page?", "correct": "< B >", "options": ["< BOLD >", "< BOLDTEXT >", "< BT >"], "explanation": "\n\n\n< B >.\n\n\tThe great thing is, rather than simply starting one of those preset blogs standard on so many sites, people can make their own webpages from scratch without paying a dime.  This is the ideal way to spread the word, showcase yourself, and get a message to the people if you happen to have the most basic technical know-how down. The tag 'B' (within the brackets) allows all the proceeding text to be bolded, just like in a document, until the designer closes off the bolded text with a '/B' tag.  The letter 'I' would represent italicized text and the letter 'U' denotes underlining.  Text is only one way to convey the Digital You online though- even with the most basic HTML, you can shape the entire format of your page, add pictures, draw up tables, charts, and graphs, and more. The visitors come in, look around, and see what you set across.  The Digital You, that is... \n"}, {"text": "You're in a chat board this evening talking with a person whom you may or may not have met.  They say a joke and you want to respond with laughter, so you respond with 'TTYL'.  The Digital You will be left by your lonesome unless you fix the issue and correct yourself with which of these acronyms?", "correct": "All of these denote laughter in some way", "options": ["ROFL", "LOL", "LMAO"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these denote laughter in some way.\n\n\tTo fix what you have said, you should quickly respond back with any of the options listed.  LOL is 'Laugh Out Loud', ROFL is 'Rolling on the Floor Laughing', and LMAO regards laughing a certain body part off.  What you actually said in your chat was 'Talk To You Later'.\rMany people have been affected by digital influences and language, as a whole, has been somewhat jilted by the online world.  Chatspeak has cropped up thanks to the spontaneity of text and instant messaging and now short-forms and chat acronyms have become everyday jargon.  How you appear to someone over a device or over the internet will be altered through every nuance of the English language and the online language.  Someone who is tech-savvy and in the know will be quick to respond with an acronym, but some will always be hardwired to write things out in full.  It's up to you to determine which the 'Digital You' will use. \n"}, {"text": "The Digital You is hooked on \"FarmVille\", an innocent, yet addictive game played through Facebook.  You're only as good as the company you keep; you decide to invite friends to play so that you can fix your image and so that they can do which of these things?", "correct": "Become your in-game neighbour", "options": ["Work as a slave on your virtual farm", "Receive \"Farmville\" spam and earn you virtual money for doing so", "Work for the in-game shop and give you discounts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecome your in-game neighbour.\n\n\tCreated by Zynga in 2009 (and also accessible on the iPhone in 2010), \"FarmVille\" shot to fame as Facebook's most popular game.  On a site already containing millions upon millions of people, it garnered over sixty million users in its first year of operation amassing a population larger than most major MMORPGs (like \"World of Warcraft\" and \"Guild Wars\" combined).\rWhen playing this game, the Digital You can create a plot of farmland, buy seeds, take care of your property, and get in-game money to improve upon your standing in this real-time game.  Because adding friends into the game is so important in improving your standing, you can shape how you are as a player by how you operate on the rest of Facebook.  The more online interaction you have, the better the Digital You appears on \"FarmVille\".  A sequel to this game, \"CityVille\", was released in late 2010 with a quick loyal following. \n"}, {"text": "You head to eBay to purchase items from an online auction and you outbid the other buyers.  When it comes time to pay, you ask for a mailing address to send a cheque.  This is a no-no.  What should the Digital You be doing instead to fix this problem?", "correct": "Signing up for a PayPal account", "options": ["Using eBay's 'eCash' system to trade credits for items", "Mailing cash instead", "Sending your cheque via webcam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSigning up for a PayPal account.\n\n\tIn order to become a contender in the world of online auctioning, you'll need to set yourself up with an account on eBay which includes setting yourself up through PayPal, the only of the options listed which is a viable solution to fixing your problem.  To make yourself appear as one of the site's regulars, maintaining a connection to your online banking and being quick to act for good deals is a must. Because PayPal connects directly to your Chequings or Savings account through your bank, it is important that you attend to it with great care and ensure that you are well-protected.  Unlike other online sites like Amazon, you may not simply purchase an item unless the page specifies that you can- otherwise the item acts as an auction piece with bids and closing times. Some can make millions from the buying and selling of items, some can simply reconnect with something from their past, and some will just flounder. \n"}, {"text": "What a better way to put across the appearance of who you are than with a Youtube video?  When you start recording from your webcam, the camera ends up running for quite a while and you find yourself submitting a video over twenty minutes in length.  Does this need to be fixed before your video can be posted?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tYoutube does not automatically allow videos over fifteen minutes in total length or over 2GB in terms of size though larger file sizes can be remedied using Java uploaders.  While millions upon millions of videos (personal or otherwise) have appeared on Youtube since its 2005 launch, people have had to follow certain guidelines in order to post videos of their digital selves. For example, some companies do not allow their images to appear on Youtube and many production companies and TV broadcasters do not allow for their programming to be uploaded either.  Nowadays, users can upload videos nearly instantly using mobile phones and webcams and link them to their accounts on Facebook, Twitter, etc. It's all part of that network of identity. \n"}, {"text": "You decide that the best way to create this image of the Digital You is on Wikipedia.  You create a page with your name on it (as you do have somewhat of a claim to fame).  You decide to lie about certain things.  Which of these facts should you fix?", "correct": "The info about you winning a Nobel Peace Prize", "options": ["Your place of birth", "Your profession", "Your name"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe info about you winning a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\tIt's perfectly alright to add articles to the ever-expanding encyclopedia that is Wikipedia, and because the site is open for anybody to contribute to, it's entirely possible to create your own page (though personal pages are not accepted unless you do happen to have a claim to fame or a professional standing).\rWhile it is unlikely that people would research your profession, date of birth, or name, a fact that you didn't win a Nobel Peace Prize is likely to turn some heads.  Although the site is free to edit, there are trusty moderators who patrol content for incorrect structuring of pages and incorrect facts.  Without proof or citation, the fact will be fixed or removed, so it's best for you to fix this now.  Like FunTrivia, Wikipedia dedicates itself to being factual first and foremost.\rIf you've taken all the necessary steps to improving your identity, getting your name out there, and being an online personality, then there's no reason your Wikipedia page shouldn't be popular, but if it doesn't get viewers, then it risks falling to the bottom of the heap and facing deletion to make room for other articles on its servers. \n"}]}
