{"id": "406602", "name": "\"Pale\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Double Feature"], "questions": [{"text": "When Harry takes the pill for the first time, what is he able to do?", "correct": "Rewrite his entire pilot episode", "options": ["Sleep for 72 hours", "Read his wife's mind", "Learn a new language"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRewrite his entire pilot episode.\n\n\tHarry loads his family into the car but the minute he turns the keys in the ignition he starts to have vivid hallucinations.  As his pupils dilate, he realizes he needs to collect his computer immediately and head inside.  The whole story has revealed itself to him.\r As he composes his work, Alma heads to the dining room and practices her fiddle.  Frustrated that she can't get the composition correct, she worries that she'll never get it.  She tells Doris that she saw her father take medication to get his work done and Harry, hearing this (true) accusation, lashes out.\r Alma heads to her room while Doris argues with her husband.  She insists on leaving-- Harry did, after all, kill an intruder in their sunroom-- but Harry has an outline for his second episode, not to mention he's already completely revised the first.  He insists on another day or two, but the argument doesn't end with any sort of solution. \n"}, {"text": "Harry finds that he's disgusted with the taste of which of these while he writes his show?", "correct": "Turkey", "options": ["Tomatoes", "Lettuce", "Water"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurkey.\n\n\tIn the evening, Doris and Alma return to the house to find Harry still working at his computer.  Doris forces him to eat but when he takes a bite out of his sandwich he finds that he's repulsed by the taste of turkey, even if there's nothing wrong with the meat.\r His wife and daughter go to bed, but he stays up through the night and well into the morning.  Doris comes downstairs to find him still typing.  When she looks at what he's done, she has to admit that it's great work.  That said, despite Harry's apologies, she knows he's on something; his mood swings and his lack of appetite lead her to believe he's on speed.  Harry, in an attempt to help her feel better, heads to the market to buy food.  He's almost done the whole show anyways, so a small break won't hurt \n"}, {"text": "When Harry visits the market, he purchases only one thing.  What is it that he buys?", "correct": "Red meat", "options": ["Whiskey", "Corn syrup", "Saltines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed meat.\n\n\tWhen Harry heads to the market he doesn't make it far before he encounters three odd men in the street, not unlike the one he killed in his house.  Another, who he comes across in the middle of the road, eats a squirrel and turns to attack him.  Harry is quickly surrounded by the men but they recoil when they come close.  As it seems, they're no longer interested.\r When Harry arrives at the market, nothing seems to be interesting, and as he wanders the aisles he finds his cart is empty...that is until he reaches the meat department.  He fills the cart with steaks and red meat.\r TB Karen finds him at the market as well, and she knows he's taken the pill.  If he thought he was thirsty before, she says, then he never knew what thirsty was.\r Getting home, Harry opens all of the steaks he's purchased and squeezes the meat into a pitcher.  As it seems, he's able to satisfy his cravings with blended, strained meat. \n"}, {"text": "In what style does Doris initially intend to decorate the Provincetown house?", "correct": "Minimalist", "options": ["Rustic", "Bohemian", "Mid-Century Modern"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinimalist.\n\n\tDoris and Alma still want to leave, but Doris has to admit that in all her years of having known Harry, he's never been so inspired.  Normally, he'll agonize over a handful of pages for week at a time, but in the house, he's excelling beyond anyone's wildest expectations.  She reassures Alma that they will leave, but they should give Harry a few days to finish his work and break the fever.  Before Alma goes to sleep, Doris asks her if she likes the colour palette she's picked out for the living room, but Alma thinks that all the colours she's picked out are the same; dull and uncomfortable.\r Doris doesn't disturb Harry while he continues to work downstairs, and neither do Austin and Belle who, watching from their car outside, realize that Harry will need to upgrade his diet if he wants to feel as good as he does on those first few nights on the pills.  They decide to head up the Cape to find a snack as they drive off into the night. \n"}, {"text": "Doris injures herself while doing which of these tasks?", "correct": "Chopping vegetables", "options": ["Laundry", "Fixing the car", "Taking a shower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChopping vegetables.\n\n\tWhile chopping vegetables in the kitchen, Doris listens to Harry muse on his recently-found inspiration.  He likens his mind to having lived in a two-bedroom apartment only to find a secret door to the Palace of Versailles.  He suggests that they might be able to leave in a week; he's just sent his scripts off to Ursula, but there's still more he can do.  Doris refuses this deal, claiming that they still feel unsafe in the house, even if no one has attacked in a week.  Harry says that they should leave and he'll stay.\r The argument leads Doris to accidentally cut her finger with her knife and Harry, in a desperate frenzy, grabs her hand and tries to drink the blood from her cut.  She has to shove him off of her to stop him.\r It necessitates a visit to Austin's house, where Harry finds him firing a shotgun into the sky over his balcony; he's hunting ducks...or quail...or something. \n"}, {"text": "Scientifically, the pill depletes its user of which of these?", "correct": "Necessary minerals", "options": ["Conscious thought", "Inhibition", "Their sense of time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNecessary minerals.\n\n\tHarry heads to Austin's for one reason: to find out what was in the pills he was given.  No one knows, Austin claims, except the Chemist.  When Austin invites Harry in for a gin martini, he tells the whole story.  Ten or fifteen years ago, drugs passed through the area in the worst way.  One person started experimenting with different recipes for methamphetamine...and that's how they got the pill.  Unfortunately, it only works on people with talent.\r The men around the city who've been attacking locals are people without talent; they took the pills and degraded themselves to hungry beasts.  Metaphorically, Austin believes that the pill forces people to drain the talent and lifeblood from other people, but scientifically, the pill depletes the imbiber's blood of four major minerals, so users must replace them.  Sooner or later, Harry is going to need lifeblood from something with opposable thumbs.\r If Harry refuses the pill, he'll have a hard time coming down and he'll probably never be able to write again.  He leaves them anyways, even though Austin knows he'll be back. \n"}, {"text": "Harry's script is greenlit with which actor attached to the project?", "correct": "Joaquin Phoenix", "options": ["Jared Leto", "Daniel Day-Lewis", "Tom Hanks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoaquin Phoenix.\n\n\tHarry returns home to tell Doris that they will leave in the morning.  He has only a few pages left and then they can have the dinner date they planned to have the previous week.  Before they leave, Doris will have time to take photos of the house and finish her design plan virtually.  She worries that Harry doesn't take her new job aspirations seriously, but he reminds her that they are a two-income family, and she'll succeed no matter what.\r Harry takes a call from Ursula and discovers that his scripts were greenlit.  Joaquin Phoenix read them and offered to take the lead role for free.  The house clearly did its job in inspiring his success and, if it were up to her, he'd be looking for real estate on the Cape for a permanent stay.  Oh, and Netflix offered him an overall deal.\r Doris leaves him be to finish his lucrative writing project, but when he sits down, he's immediately unable to figure out what to write.\r With that he rides back to Austin's and retrieves the pills.  He's going to need them.  Austin and Belle both recognize the signs; he's never going to stop at just one more pill.  They suggest ending the pity party.  As he takes his second pill, the writers remove their false teeth to reveal sharp fangs.  They let him know that it's time to go eat. \n"}, {"text": "Karen is proven to be gifted in which regard?", "correct": "Painting", "options": ["Dancing", "Singing", "Writing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPainting.\n\n\tHarry has to cancel his dinner plans with Doris to take a ride with Austin and Belle.  They explain to him that during the winter they come to Provincetown to be 'inspired', but in the summer they return home.  Nonetheless, a good feeding every week is necessary.  There are 9-12 pints of human blood in the human body, and Austin and Belle split that.  They attack people on Craigslist-- criminals typically.  They have two rules: don't feed on anyone in Provincetown and never take your gloves off.\r Tuberculosis Karen stays at Mickey's shack for the night and the two of them get high.  It's during their chat that Mickey reveals his interest in completing some of his half-baked screenplays; movies are his life but he's never been able to follow through on a project.  When he tells Karen that he stole two of Belle Noir's pills last time he visited, she urges him to throw them away; they make you a murderer.  But when he shows her the paintings he found at the thrift shop-- paintings that Karen made when she took a fine arts course and that she never thought would sell-- the two of them realize that they could magnify their talent.\r Karen doesn't want to be like Belle and Austin.  She continues to refuse.  But Mickey takes a pill on his own.  Anything, he claims, is better than what he has now. \n"}, {"text": "What is Dr. Leslie Feldman's new name?", "correct": "Lark", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLark.\n\n\tAustin, Belle, and Harry arrive at a household on the Cape and find a junkie trying to sell a bike for quick money.  Entering the home, Belle wastes no time in slitting the man's throat and inviting Harry to feast on the blood.  On the drive home, Austin tosses Harry the packet of pills he left behind.  All three of them reel from the crystal meth in the junkie's veins and Belle recommends that they book an appointment with the local dentist since Harry is going to need to fix his teeth.\r Harry goes to the dentist's the next day to meet Dr. Feldman and finds that it's not a dentist's office at all-- it's a tattoo and body modification parlour.  The dentist, Leslie Feldman (who goes by the name 'Lark') went to school for dentistry but pursued a career as a tattooist when she took the pills and pursued her talents.  She brings him to the back room and asks him to take a seat.  Though Harry has hesitation in having dental surgery, Lark invented the modification and knows what she's doing.  If he can kill cleanly, he can kill less and get the blood he needs.  They start by taking a mold of his teeth for his caps...then they start the filing. \n"}, {"text": "Doris grounds Alma for her cruel attitude.  Where does she find her daughter?", "correct": "In the graveyard", "options": ["At a church", "On the beach", "At the market"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the graveyard.\n\n\tAlma struggles to master her performance and, with every subsequent playing of her fiddle, she stresses about her capabilities.  While her mother is on the phone and her father is getting his dental work done, she sneaks into his bag and finds his bag of pills, slipping one into her mouth and swallowing it dry.  This time, when she picks up her fiddle, she sees it all immediately and performs without flaw.\r At the same time, Mickey completes his masterpieces, successfully following through on his screenplays for the first time.\r And when Harry returns home he continues to write, unencumbered by a lack of thought.\r Doris, however, struggles to determine her design plan.  After a short nap she heads downstairs to find Alma having played for hours.  She asks her daughter to stop-- due to her headache-- but it sparks an argument between them that forces Doris to send Alma to her room.  Doris chalks Alma's sass up to stress, but she's still hurt by her daughter's cruel words, most of which dig at her feelings of artistic inadequacy.  Worse, Alma wants to stay in Provincetown.  Based on her attitude, Doris tells her they're leaving the next day.  No questions asked.\r But Alma doesn't stay in her room.  After her father comes home from making his first kill under a local dock, Harry lets her go outside.  When Doris leaves the house, alone, to search for her, she finds her in the nearby graveyard...eating a dead animal. \n"}]}
