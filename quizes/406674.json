As he cuts the umbilical cord, he winces.  Doris, overcome with exhaustion, closes her eyes for a nap while Harry takes her blood-soaked linens and drinks them in the bathroom.  All he can do is stare at himself in the mirror as he drinks what he needs.\r Doris leaves the hospital and returns to the house in Provincetown, much to her dismay.  Her vivid dreams of their already-tumultuous time on the Cape force her to wake up in dreary distress.  As Ursula hands the new baby to its mother, Doris has to wonder what she's doing in bed; Harry promised they'd leave.  Harry explains that the don't have a choice; the doctors believe she could be prone to postpartum hemorrhaging and she needs bedrest somewhere quiet and safe.  It's what's best for her and the baby, he promises. \n"}, {"text": "Mickey suggests to Karen that the studio wants which of these from him?", "correct": "An expanded universe", "options": ["A Netflix deal", "Spec scripts for all anime adaptations", "A twenty-year plan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn expanded universe.\n\n\tKaren walks through Provincetown as Mickey pulls up in his brand new sports car, an immediate indication of his newfound wealth.  The car is meant to be the closest thing he could get to the car from \"Speed Racer\"; he had the studio lease it so he could use it for research into a \"Speed Racer\" Expanded Universe.  Mickey wants Karen to be one of his artists; they could be a power couple in Hollywood.  She doesn't want this though, and the cost bothers her enough that she forces him to pull over and let her out.  She walks to Grace Point on her own.\r Doris wakes up in the middle of the night to hear the crying of her newborn.  As she checks its cradle, however, she finds that the baby has been taken to the next room.  Hazily, she walks over to find Alma sucking blood from the baby's hand and she collapses. \n"}, {"text": "What consequence does Harry specify if Alma harms Doris or the new baby?", "correct": "She'll never have another pill", "options": ["He'll kill her", "He'll smash her violin", "He'll send her away to fend for herself"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe'll never have another pill.\n\n\tHarry finds the truth out from Doris and the day after finding Alma with the baby, he has no choice but to put the fear into his daughter.  Despite the newborn's blood being the richest she could imbibe upon, Harry tells Alma they must never feed on it.  Harry, after all, is trying to keep their family together under awful circumstances.  Alma doesn't see why they need to keep Doris around; they want to live with talent and significance but Doris holds them back.  If Alma harms Doris, however, Harry threatens that she will never see another pill.\r Doris awakens later in the day to find Ursula reading a script next to her bed.  The agent suggests that Doris was having vivid dreams about Alma eating the baby but Doris believes she can tell the difference between sleep and real life.  Ursula reasons with her that she'll be fine, especially since Harry's prolific writing will support her for the rest of her life.  All she needs to do is let it happen and not get on Harry's bad side and she can coast.  She'll need to, Ursula suggests, since she's not going to get anywhere with the decorating plans. \n"}, {"text": "Who is first to admit the truth about the pills to Doris?", "correct": "Alma", "options": ["Belle", "Harry", "Ursula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlma.\n\n\tAlma continues to practice with fervour while Harry serves her fresh blood from his hunts and Doris remains in her bedroom with the baby.  It's shortly after feeding the child that she finds the bite marks on the baby's arm, confirming her worst suspicions.  It's then that Alma brings her mother her pills.  As she pours them into Doris' hand, there's one amongst the bunch-- a black one-- that Doris has never taken before.  Doris sees it immediately and believes it to be poison, and when she screams for Harry for help, she's backed into the corner by her family's lies.\r Alma is the first to break through the gaslighting by claiming that she wanted her mother to take the pill so that she could be like the rest of the family.  If she takes the pill, like the others, she'll be great at whatever she's good at.  Harry refuses to let them urge her; it's not for her.  Doris tosses the pill and the water on the ground, grabs the baby, and flees into the night but she has to return to the house when she emerges into the street to find the pale creatures waiting to feed.  There's nowhere she can go. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Belle ask to retrieve the Gardners' baby?", "correct": "Karen", "options": ["Austin", "Mickey", "Lark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKaren.\n\n\tKaren spends the day at Grace Point getting her paintings just right when Belle Noir comes upon her there.  Because Karen hasn't been answering her burner phone, she had to come out and see her in person.  Belle explains that she needs a favour; the Gardners came home with the baby and she wants it for the obvious reasons.  Although Karen says no, initially, she finds that they're surrounded by the pale creatures, only protected by Belle's presence, so there's nowhere to go.  Newborn blood is untainted and the longer they wait, the less untainted it gets.\r Doris awakens once more in her bed and, this time, gets up and searches through the bathroom for something she can use to protect herself.  What she finds is a pair of scissors amongst her design materials, and with this she creeps through the house. \n"}, {"text": "It's Harry's idea to hire someone else to decorate their Provincetown house.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWith scissors in-hand, Doris descends the stairs to find everyone in the house busy with their activities.  While Ursula is on the phone with work, Alma sits at the kitchen counter and Harry speaks to local designer Holden Vaughn about the house.  Harry claims he hired him on, anonymously, to help her finish the job.  She cries as she returns to the baby.\r Mickey, back at home, is found by Karen who reams him out for giving away her location.  She's scared of what might happen to her and everyone else in town, but Mickey says she doesn't need to be.  All she needs to do is take the pills.  She doesn't want to do that and throw her humanity away, but she doesn't have much of a plan otherwise; she wants to get the Gardners' baby, but to protect it and maybe even raise it far away from Belle's influence.  She begs him to help before it's too late. \n"}, {"text": "What name does Doris give to the new baby?", "correct": "Eli", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEli.\n\n\tWhile Doris nurses the baby, Alma finds her in the bedroom and joins her, asking what they'll name the newborn.  Both of them like the name 'Eli'.  It's a distraction from the real reason Alma's there to visit.  Doris tries to pull herself away from her daughter when her monstrous tendencies start to emerge, but Alma claims she doesn't want to lose their family.  It's another opportunity for Alma to urge her mother to take the pill.  While Harry might believe that Doris will become another pale creature, Alma tells her mother she'll become a member of the family again.  She doesn't need to settle for mediocrity.\r This time, when Alma hands Doris the pill, she puts it directly into her mouth.  Doris doesn't catch her daughters disingenuous tone. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these forces Karen to take the pill?", "correct": "Fear of dying", "options": ["Carelessness", "Fear of inadequacy", "Urge for revenge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFear of dying.\n\n\tAlma practices her violin while Doris feels the effects of the pill up in the bedroom.  She sketches with maddening intensity until she feels sick, but no one notices her changing.  Instead, that evening, Harry, Alma, and Ursula head out for dinner and leave Doris by herself.\r At the same time, Karen and Mickey arrive at the Gardners' house to break in and steal the newborn.  As they head in they find the pale creatures waiting on the beach.  They break in as Doris, feeling sick, leaves her bed to use the bathroom, and it's why she's not there when they arrive to find the baby unguarded.  When she emerges to find them standing over the cradle, however, she's changed.  Karen, seeing Doris' pale complexion and immediate hair loss, flees from the building only to find herself completely surrounded by the creatures searching for their next meal.\r The creatures only stop when Mickey comes back to her, saving her at the last minute.  He offers her a choice-- he can leave her or she can take the pill.  He believes in her, but she doesn't think he's human anymore.  He says goodbye to her-- his muse-- but leaves the pill in her hand and lets her make the decision herself before walking away.\r She doesn't want to die though, and that's why she has to swallow the pill. \n"}, {"text": "Finding Doris transformed, Harry locks her into which spot to prevent her from causing harm?", "correct": "The bathroom", "options": ["Another house", "The basement", "Their car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bathroom.\n\n\tWhen Karen and Mickey flee from the Gardners' house, Doris finally gets the chance to look in the mirror and find that her hair has completely fallen out.  She shaves the remainder in her fervour while Eli's cries are drowned out only by the sound of her heartbeat and her thirst for sustenance.  It's why she heads downstairs to grab a knife.  As she looms over the cradle and begins to raise the blade, Harry is able to stop her at the last moment, but it's too late to save her.  He's able to break her out of her rage, if only temporarily, to toss her into the bathroom and block the door.  But she'll never be the same again.  Harry has to ask why Doris would have taken the pill, but Alma openly admits to asking her mother to do it, and she had Ursula's help.  They don't need her anymore.\r At Mickey's, Karen stresses over her feeling of infection while he tries to assuage her fears.  She takes his hands as he urges her to think about her future masterpiece.  He tells her to make it-- right then.  First, she has to feed, however. \n"}, {"text": "Is Karen able to make her masterpiece?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe morning after Doris' transformation, Harry returns to the bedroom to find silence.  Doris is only waiting, however.  She punches through the glass doors in an attempt to escape and all he can do is ponder his next steps.  As Doris writhes on the floor, Harry admits that he used to say family was the most important thing, but that was before when he was unable to amount to anything in his professional life.  He wasn't happy then, he realizes, and he should have been honest.  He loves Doris, but the truth is Alma and Ursula are right.  He's outgrown his wife.  This is, perhaps, for the best.  When Harry opens the bathroom door, he picks his wife up off the ground and helps her outside.  He, Alma, and Ursula can only watch as she stalks off to find sustenance, joining the other pale creatures.\r Karen takes Mickey to the beach, the place where she believes she could paint her masterpiece, and he insists that she needs to feed.  In fact, there's someone on the beach she can feed on.  Karen takes his head in her hands, embraces him, and bites into his neck.  Once she's done, she leaves him on the ground and starts her most important work.  Sure enough, it's the best thing she's ever done.  She leaves it there, next to his body, before she walks out to the water's edge to gaze out at the ocean.  Taking a razor, she gouges into her arms, and walks out to sea to die.\r That night, Ursula brings Alma with her as she heads to the Chemist's house.  As they pass by the cemetery, they see Doris feeding on a wild animal and continue on. \n"}]}
