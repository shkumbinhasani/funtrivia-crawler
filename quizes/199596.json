{"id": "199596", "name": "Top Movies of 1999 Online Trivia | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1990s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "'The Virgin Suicides' is a strange and entrancing film relating the very odd circumstances behind the deaths of four sisters with the last name Lisbon.  Based on a novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, this film was the feature-length film debut of which up-and-coming director?", "correct": "Sofia Coppola", "options": ["Jay Roach", "Wes Anderson", "Brad Anderson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSofia Coppola.\n\n\tSofia Coppola is the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, and she appears to have inherited her father's sensibilites about human relationships.  In addition, she has developed her own unique style, creating an almost dreamlike quality and a sense of surrealism in films like 'The Virgin Suicides'.  \r Aside from the direction of Coppola, 'The Virgin Suicides' also features the acting of James Woods, Kathleen Turner (in an almost scary performance), Kirsten Dunst and Josh Hartnett, among others.  It's worth a look! \n"}, {"text": "One of the most beautiful films to appear in theaters in 1999 was 'The Road Home', a quiet picture directed by Zhang Yimou that depicts the innocent relationship between a young schoolmaster and a budding local girl.  In which country was this poignant film shot?", "correct": "China", "options": ["Japan", "Brazil", "Russia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChina.\n\n\tZhang Yimou is China's most internationally celebrated filmmaker, and 'The Road Home' is simply one more gorgeous piece of cinema added to his film oeuvre in 1999.  'The Road Home' is a breathtaking visual treat that features scenes of great detail and intimacy alongside magnificent landsape portraiture.  Zhang is like a painter with his filmmaking.  \r The beautiful Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' fame appears in this film. \n"}, {"text": "Directed by the Wachowski brothers and featuring Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne, this magnificent sci-fi thriller took the world by storm and shock in 1999 with its unbelievable and innovative visual effects, and established an entirely new reality in which the characters in the film struggled against the menace of artificial intelligence.  \n\nWhich film fits the description above?", "correct": "The Matrix & Matrix", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Matrix & Matrix.\n\n\t'The Matrix' was certainly the surprise megahit of 1999.  Not only was the story crisp and exciting, the techniques for shooting the film were innovative and created a sequence of action scenes that were absolutely stunning to behold.\r If you just cannot get enough of this film, I invite you to try my 'Before We Reload' series, to be found at the link below:\r http://www.funtrivia.com/quizlistgold.cfm?cat=8691 \n"}, {"text": "Director Sam Mendes made a big splash with his feature film debut in 1999.  What is the name of his first film, presenting the very strange relationships that develop between a broken family called the Burnhams and the unusual people who are invited, or who invite themselves, into their lives?", "correct": "American Beauty", "options": ["American Pie", "American Splendor", "American Movie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican Beauty.\n\n\t'American Beauty' features a tour de force performance by Kevin Spacey, and marvelous supporting acting by Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and several others.  \r One may notice some similarities in the plot lines of this film and 'Lolita'.  It may not be a coincidence, then, that the Kevin Spacey character's name, Lester Burnham, is an anagram of 'Humbert learns', a reference to the ill-fated Humbert Humbert from 'Lolita'. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the most bizarre and mesmerizing film of 1999 was this one, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, featuring the almost indecipherable story of the intermingled lives and coincidental interactions of nine people living in the Valley in Los Angeles.  What is the name of this unusual film that stars William H. Macy, Jason Robards and Tom Cruise as part of a brilliant cast from top to bottom?", "correct": "Magnolia", "options": ["Cigarettes & Coffee", "Punch-Drunk Love", "Sydney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagnolia.\n\n\t'Magnolia' may well be Anderson's masterpiece, as it weaves and wends its way through the lives of several people who often have never encountered each other before.  Special attention should be paid to William H. Macy's 'Quiz Kid' character, though the performances of Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman and others should not be ignored.  You may have to watch this film more than once! \n"}, {"text": "Just when it seems that life has hit rock bottom for the main character in this film, an interesting anarchist named Tyler Durden enters his life and reveals to him the secrets behind his lost manhood, the emptiness of material culture and soapmaking.  Which film fits this promising description?", "correct": "Fight Club", "options": ["Panic Room", "Se7en", "The Game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFight Club.\n\n\tAs 'Magnolia' is Anderson's masterpiece, so 'Fight Club' is the chef-d'oeuvre of director David Fincher.  Much like 'The Matrix', this film presents the viewer with fantastic visual effects wrapped around a substantive and captivating story.  Ed Norton is fabulous as the unnamed main character in the film and he receives handy support from Brad Pitt (as Tyler Durden) and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer.  Violent and sometimes gory, the film is not for the light of stomach.  Nonetheless, I strongly recommend that it be viewed by all who consider themselves to be aficionados of cinema. \n"}, {"text": "At the same time critically praised and panned, 'Eyes Wide Shut' was certainly one of the films that sparked a great deal of discussion and controversy in 1999.  This film was the last one directed by which giant of the film world?", "correct": "Stanley Kubrick", "options": ["Sam Peckinpah", "David Lean", "Ted Demme"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStanley Kubrick.\n\n\tStanley Kubrick was not only a master filmmaker, but also understood how to draw controversy through his selection of subject material.  'Eyes Wide Shut' perfectly fit the mold of his typical story selection.  Provocative to the end, the film features Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (married at the time) as a troubled couple who have their monogamy challenged.  Perhaps not his greatest film (among so many great ones!), this picture still lives up to the high standards Kubrick held for his works. \n"}, {"text": "You may think this next selection to be rather odd, but consider it a guilty pleasure.  Which film, featuring the direction of Mike Judge, analyzes the unhappy life of a functionary/drone at a company called Initech who suddenly, after a bout with a hypnotist, decides to no longer take his work so seriously?", "correct": "Office Space", "options": ["Office Killer", "Office Hours", "Office Blues"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOffice Space.\n\n\t'Office Space' was truly one of the underrated comedies to emerge from Hollywood in the late 1990s.  Developed originally as a set of animated skits on 'Saturday Night Live' in the early 90s, Mike Judge of 'Beavis and Butthead' and 'King of the Hill' fame was finally able to bring his idea to the live action big screen by the end of the decade.  Clever dialogue and sympathetic characters make this film a worthy watch, especially for those who know the feeling of being cooped up in an office cubicle. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most intense and nerve-racking films of 1999 featured Russell Crowe as Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, a former executive at a tobacco firm who is convinced to reveal the secrets of the industry by Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a producer at '60 Minutes'.  What is the title of this frustrating and sometimes harrowing film?", "correct": "The Insider", "options": ["The Cooler", "The Pusher", "The Snitch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Insider.\n\n\tNominated for seven Academy Awards, it did not win a single Oscar.  Despite that, 'The Insider' might very well have been the best and most important film of the year.  Directed by Michael Mann, the film's true story is both gripping and touching at the same time, thanks in large part to the performances of Pacino and Crowe, the former of whom was nominated for Best Actor. \n"}, {"text": "The final 'top film' of 1999 was a visual treat and acting masterwork, directed by Julie Taymor of Broadway fame.  Featuring excellent performances by Jessica Lange and Anthony Hopkins, which 1999 film was based on the tragic Shakespeare play involving a Roman general and a Gothic queen, each with a pair of sons, in a story too gory and convoluted to believe?", "correct": "Titus", "options": ["Measure for Measure", "Coriolanus", "Timon of Athens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTitus.\n\n\t'Titus' features the style and panache that Julie Taymor brought to her Broadway production of 'The Lion King', but dispenses with the juvenile story matter.  In Titus, the characters are brutal, cruel and willing to destroy each other with extreme prejudice.  With that in mind, it is difficult to imagine a likeable film, but the visuals, the acting performances (keep an eye on Alan Cumming's Saturninus, especially) and the ruthless dialogue keep the viewer interested, if not appalled.  View, but at your own risk (my tastes may be different from your own!).\r Thank you for trying this quiz.  I hope you appreciated it and I would like to read your comments.
