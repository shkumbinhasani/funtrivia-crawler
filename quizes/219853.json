{"id": "219853", "name": "\"M*A*S*H\" - \"The Chosen People\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "We join our heroes in the operating room, where Captain Sam Pak is chatting with Hawkeye while observing an operation. What is the subject of their conversation?", "correct": "language lessons", "options": ["their upcoming leave in Tokyo", "the particulars of the medical procedure", "the dreadful weather they've been having"], "explanation": "\n\n\nlanguage lessons.\n\n\tHawkeye tries out what he thinks are innocuous phrases in Korean - \"Your presence is welcome in our camp,\" for example - and Sam, a medical observer from the army of the Republic of Korea, tells him what he's actually said (in this case, \"Your uncle has gas from eating cabbage\"; later in the scene, Hawkeye inadvertently insists that the uncle in question has gotten pregnant). Frank, of course, is angry at this idea: they're traveling with the U.S. Army, so it's almost unpatriotic to try to learn Korean. \n"}, {"text": "We soon learn that a Korean family has moved into camp. What is the first sign of their arrival?", "correct": "An ox lumbers into Henry's tent.", "options": ["An eager boy approaches Henry to perform a small task.", "Frank appears in Henry's tent to complain.", "The family attempts to eat in the mess tent."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn ox lumbers into Henry's tent.\n\n\tThis makes his morning shave rather more interesting than usual! Of course it falls to Radar to remove the beast, but as he does so he alerts Henry to the fact that a farming family is building a little house on base. Negotiating with them to leave is far beyond Henry's language skills - his pidgin Korean has progressed no further than an embarrassing \"Go-ee home-ee\" - which leads to a desperate call to Civilian Affairs. \n"}, {"text": "One of the small children of the family is very persistent about performing a particular chore. What is it that he's so anxious to do?", "correct": "shine shoes", "options": ["sweep the floor", "park cars", "polish buttons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nshine shoes.\n\n\tHis first victim is Henry Blake, and while it takes a few tries before Henry is distracted enough to let the boy have his foot, he is ready and waiting for the opportunity! He isn't shy about insisting on work or on what he sees as fair payment, shunning Radar's proffered stick of candy in favor of an entire dollar. They compromise on a hot meal. \n"}, {"text": "Henry gets Sam to talk to the squatting family, and a short while later Sam strides triumphantly into his office. \"I've had a long reasonable talk with the father and everything's cool,\" he declares. What is the outcome of his discussion with the Korean paterfamilias?", "correct": "The 4077th has three days to get out of there.", "options": ["The Korean family will provide milk for the 4077th, as rent.", "The Korean family will leave in 3 days.", "The 4077th can stay if they pay weekly rent."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe 4077th has three days to get out of there.\n\n\tHenry is not thrilled by this news. \"Sam,\" he asks despondently, \"what's Korean for 'suicide'?\" Sam thinks a moment. \"That's the Japanese,\" he concludes. \"We don't do that schtick.\" \n"}, {"text": "Henry's problems only multiply as another Korean visitor arrives. This one is a young, English-speaking woman named Choon Hi, carrying a baby boy (Soo Yong) and insisting that a \"doctor, M*A*S*H 4077\" is the father. With whom does she claim to have \"committed parenthood\"?", "correct": "Corporal Radar O'Reilly", "options": ["Major Frank Burns", "Captain Trapper McIntyre", "Captain Hawkeye Pierce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorporal Radar O'Reilly.\n\n\t\"Soo Yong's father speak nice to me,\" she says, \"like wind song.\" This immediately leads Henry to suspect \"Pierce and/or McIntyre,\" but when Radar enters she astonishes everyone by fingering him. (Hawkeye also astonishes everyone by correctly saying \"Mazel tov!\" in Korean, before giving Radar a cigar.) \n"}, {"text": "The alleged father of Choon Hi's baby disputes the claim. How do they decide to test his paternity?", "correct": "by testing blood types", "options": ["by testing DNA", "by deploying a lie detector", "by questioning him under hypnotism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nby testing blood types.\n\n\tRadar insists that it wasn't him: \"It's not mine!\" Henry, near the end of his rope, reminds him that \"the mother says it is.\" Argues Radar, \"Well what does she know? I mean, she's mixing me up with someone else.\" The scene is, as usual, stolen by Pat Morita as Captain Pak: \"That's possible - you all look alike to us.\" \n"}, {"text": "Predictably, Frank is disgusted with the whole situation, practically snarling his indignation at the family \"cooking, sewing, farming ...\" What does Henry suggest he do about it?", "correct": "He should call the Civilian Affairs officer himself.", "options": ["He should try singing to them, since that'd drive anyone away.", "He should try his luck talking to the family.", "He should go soak his head."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe should call the Civilian Affairs officer himself.\n\n\tFrank is both overjoyed and uncharacteristically modest at the idea, but Henry insists: \"I've talked to him. He makes no sense, and you're very good at that!\" Frank wanders off, happier than a pair of clams, to make the call, with Sam Pak shouting encouragement at him: \"Go get him, Frank. Kill!\" Frank quickly establishes a rapport with the officer over the phone, but when he makes the suggestion that they go out for drinks sometime, he discovers to his horror that the officer is a bit more, well, enthusiastic than he'd like. \n"}, {"text": "First Lieutenant Hopper from the J.A.G. arrives to deal with the problem of Choon Hi and her baby. Henry introduces him to his companions: \"This is Captain Pak, R. o. K., and\" what chaplain?", "correct": "\"Lieutenant Mulcahy, G. O. D.\"", "options": ["\"Corporal Klinger, M.A.C.Y.'s\"", "\"Major Burns, M. D.\"", "\"Major Houlihan, L. I. P. S.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Lieutenant Mulcahy, G. O. D.\"\n\n\tI laughed pretty hard at this one, but Lt. Hopper evidently considers it beneath his notice. He tries to follow Henry so that he can interview Radar and Choon Hi, but he doesn't get very far before the little boy from Question 3 intercepts him to shine his shoes. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the real father of Choon Hi's baby?", "correct": "We don't know.", "options": ["It's Captain Hawkeye Pierce.", "It's Corporal Radar O'Reilly.", "It's Captain Trapper McIntyre."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe don't know.\n\n\tOver the course of the episode, Radar has warmed up to the idea of fatherhood. \"I like all babies,\" he tells Choon Hi after the blood test, \"it sure is a great way to start a life.\" He enjoys the way that the other soldiers look at him like a big man on base, and he eventually decides to tell the J.A.G. lieutenant that he's the father after all. But the blood type results have already come in, and there's no way that he can be the father.\r \"It's the same sad story, fellas,\" says Sam Pak. \"The real G. I. father left her, she is now ostracized by her family, Radar was kind enough to give her a lift one day and instead of a thank-you note she gives him the baby.\" \n"}, {"text": "What happens to the Korean family squatting on the base?", "correct": "They're taken in a truck to be relocated further south.", "options": ["They work out a wary coexistence with the 4077th.", "The father joins the 4077th as an orderly.", "They flee in the night, first stopping to short-sheet Frank's bed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey're taken in a truck to be relocated further south.\n\n\tChoon Hi and her baby go with them; Sam opines that she'll be all right now, since \"she's got a family again.\" Father Mulcahy hands out Bibles for them to read on the long trip, and there is a general, hopeful air - but of course, it is impossible to say what lies in store for the family in the end. Thanks for taking this quiz; I hope that you've enjoyed it! \n"}]}
