Your Karma rating goes up and down based on what you do; heal civilians, become good. Drain their life force to heal yourself... Well that's evil.\n\nIn which of these games does Cole McGrath choose between being a hero or an outlaw?", "correct": "inFAMOUS", "options": ["Mass Effect", "Little Big Planet", "Pikmin"], "explanation": "\n\n\ninFAMOUS.\n\n\tAs an evil character, Cole's auto becomes red, like fire.

If you choose the oath of honor, you go from Guardian to Champion to Hero. Choose a path of evil and you are Thug, Outlaw, and Infamous. Of course, you can switch and head in the opposite path, but you may lose your abilities you earned.\r \"inFAMOUS\" was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2009. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Tomb Raider: Legend\", Lara Croft fights James in Ghana.
