Homer promises somewhere more fun next time.\rAs the family drives off they contemplate Grampa's smell and Marge, frustrated with the family's attitude, suggests that they treasure their time with their elderly relative to set a good example-- Homer backs this up out of fear that he may too be placed into a home.  As a result they spend a bit of time considering where they can spend every third Sunday of the month with Grampa. \n"}, {"text": "How does Abe meet Bea?", "correct": "Their pills get mixed up by the retirement home orderlies", "options": ["They share a leisure hour together", "They're both dragged to the same swap meet", "They both spent time together during the war"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir pills get mixed up by the retirement home orderlies.\n\n\tBack at the retirement home, Abe stops off at his room and then heads to the leisure room to get his pills for the day.  This leads to a bout of senile frustration when the orderlies accidentally switch his pills with those belonging to Beatrice Simmons, who also returns to complain about the swap.  This leads to a happy meeting between the two elderly people and, after a coughing fit, the two of them sit down together, introduce themselves, and hit it off.  As it turns out, both of them are widowed.  Abe invites her to spend some time with him. \n"}, {"text": "Who runs the military antiques shop in Springfield?", "correct": "Herman", "options": ["Nelson", "Moe", "Jasper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHerman.\n\n\tAbe and Bea end up spending the night dancing and, over the course of the next few weeks, they end up striking up a strong relationship, going for walks, sharing ice cream floats, and singing together.  Abe ends up visiting Herman's Military Antiques shop for a gift for Bea's upcoming birthday, but only finds products he's interested in owning for himself.

Even though Abe has a present ready and claims that he has a prior engagement, Homer makes a point of mocking his father and ends up dragging him along.  The family is thrilled to go but when they arrive it ends up being a let-down.  When Homer accidentally drives off the beaten path their car ends up getting stuck in the mud and then attacked by a pride of lions.  They aren't found until the next morning. \n"}, {"text": "Bea dies primarily due to an issue with which of these?", "correct": "Heart", "options": ["Brain", "Liver", "Kidneys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeart.\n\n\tThe next morning is too late for Grampa.  When he returns to the retirement home, he's told by Jasper that Bea died the previous night.  As it turns out, her left ventricle burst-- she died of a broken heart.  The news is devastating to Grampa.  Surprisingly the rest of the family shows up.  Homer tries to apologize to his father for dragging him out to Discount Lion Safari, but Abe feigns deafness, claiming that Homer made him miss the last precious moments of Bea's life.  Now, he has no son; he'll never speak to him again. \n"}, {"text": "When she dies, Bea leaves everything to Abe.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tGrampa is met by Lionel Hutz in his room in the retirement home and is told that apparently, Bea was a wealthy woman.  As the executor of her estate, Mr. Hutz informs him that Bea left everything to him-- $106,000 to use as he sees fit.  To rub it in, Abe calls Homer and breaks his vow of silence to say that he hasn't forgiven him and that the family won't see a dime of his newfound wealth because of his actions.  Shortly thereafter, Abe is accosted by the owner of the retirement home who suggests that a little money could go a long way in getting him treated better. \n"}, {"text": "In an effort to enjoy his new wealth, Abe buys which of these for himself?", "correct": "A hat", "options": ["A car", "A new girlfriend", "A house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA hat.\n\n\tHeading out to follow the request in Bea's note, Abe ends up buying the $400 hat he wanted from Herman's antiques shop (it was allegedly worn by Napoleon for a week!).  Then, hopping into a cab, he tells the driver to take him to fun places; he ends up at a mud wrestling club, in a parasailing rig, and at an amusement park called Diz-Nee-Land.  None of these ventures seem to inspire any happiness though, leading him to a general apathy because he still misses Bea's presence and feels unfulfilled. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Abe encounter the ghost of Bea?", "correct": "On a roller coaster", "options": ["By her grave", "In line at a movie", "In a taxi cab"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn a roller coaster.\n\n\tWhile riding the coaster at Diz-Nee-Land, Abe, heading up an incline, comes into contact with the ghost of Bea (alarming him for a moment).  He's glad she's keeping busy haunting a Texan family but she's disappointed that her money isn't bringing him happiness.  Her suggestion: spread the wealth around and reunite with Homer since they both miss each other.\rMarge, frustrated that Homer is still sulking over his father's disowning, hands him the phone so that he can get into contact with Dr. Marvin Monroe for counseling.  There's no need though-- Abe stops by to apologize.  Over dinner, Abe says that he's decided to give Bea's money away to someone who genuinely needs it. \n"}, {"text": "Who is not shown asking Grampa for $100,000?", "correct": "Chief Wiggum", "options": ["Mr. Burns", "Otto", "Moe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChief Wiggum.\n\n\tThe town is abuzz when Grampa announces his plan to give the money away.  Everyone in Springfield seems to line up for an appointment with the senior to present their ideas for how to spend $100,000.  Some are extremely selfish while others are helpful considerations; even Darth Vader appears to be in the line. When Lisa comes in, she gives Grampa an awakening.  As much as she claims she could use a pony, there are people out on the streets and unfortunate enough to require essentials who need it more than anyone standing in line with hare-brained ideas.  Unfortunately he doesn't seem to have enough money. \n"}, {"text": "To whom does Abe give away his money?", "correct": "The retirement home", "options": ["Springfield Elementary", "The church", "The Simpson Family"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe retirement home.\n\n\tHomer rushes to the retirement home to tell his father that he doesn't need the money but it's too late; in an effort to make more money to help the needy, Grampa has boarded a bus full of retired folks to go to the casino and increase his donations.  Homer speeds along to Plato's Casino and, at the last moment, prevents Abe from losing everything in roulette (even though he's ahead at one point).  When the ball is thrown, it turns out he would've lost the entire stack of chips.\rOn the way home, when Homer asks who gets the money, Abe decides that it should go to the retirement home for renovations.  Six months later, he welcomingly leads his fellow seniors into the Beatrice Simmons Memorial Dining Hall. \n"}]}
