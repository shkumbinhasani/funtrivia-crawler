{"id": "285115", "name": "Fractured American Idol 2008 Quiz | Fractured TV | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "TV Wordplay", "Fractured TV"], "questions": [{"text": "Chuck easy", "correct": "Chikezie", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nChikezie.\n\n\tTwenty-two at competition time, Chikezie is from Inglewood, California. His family came to the U.S. from Africa. I LOVED his version of the Beatles' song \"She's a Woman.\" He left the show on March 26. \n"}, {"text": "Hum mender owe firm ire", "correct": "Amanda Overmyer", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmanda Overmyer.\n\n\tA Janis Joplin-style rocker, Amanda was 23 at competition time. She hails from Mulberry, Indiana. A nurse as well as a singer, Amanda rides a Harley (as do many of her family members). Amanda left the show on March 19. In my opinion, Kristy Lee Cook should've gone before her. \n"}, {"text": "Chase sun gassed row", "correct": "Jason Castro", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJason Castro.\n\n\tJason comes from Rockwall, Texas. He was 20 years old at competition time. I don't normally like dreadlocks, but he looks fabulous in them. I think he's a wonderfully natural folk-type singer. \n"}, {"text": "Day fed Archie lead awe", "correct": "David Archuleta", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Archuleta.\n\n\tLittle David is hugely talented. He comes from Murray, Utah. Only 17 at competition time, he was by far the youngest Top-12 contestant. I thought he had a good chance of rising to the Top 3. \n"}, {"text": "Ray me yell mullah bye", "correct": "Ramiele Malubay", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRamiele Malubay.\n\n\tAdorable, tenderhearted Ramiele comes from Miramar, Florida. Her family came to the U.S. from the Phillipines. She cried every time a fellow contestant left the show. Ramie was 20 during the competition. She left the show on April 2. I cried. \n"}, {"text": "My cull Shawn's", "correct": "Michael Johns", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Johns.\n\n\tOriginally from Down Under, Michael's U.S. hometown was Buckhead, Georgia. The oldest contestant, he was 29 at competition time. He's a lovely singer, in my opinion. \n"}, {"text": "Karl Leigh smidgen", "correct": "Carly Smithson", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarly Smithson.\n\n\tOriginally from Ireland, Carly's U.S. home is San Diego, California. She was 24 at competition time. Carly had some success as a recording artist before the 2008 AI competition, but I guess it wasn't enough to disqualify her. I loved her rendition of the Beatles' \"Come Together.\" \n"}, {"text": "Dei fetter nun does", "correct": "David Hernandez", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Hernandez.\n\n\tVoted off the show on March 12, David was 24 at competition time. He's from Glendale, Arizona. Unbeknownst to some (but not YOU, right?) David has worked as a stripper. I wonder if this had anything to do with his lack of popularity. I think he has a good singing voice, and I wish him well. \n"}, {"text": "Brew quite", "correct": "Brooke White", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrooke White.\n\n\tFrom Mesa, Arizona, Brooke worked as a nanny before entering the 2008 competition. She was 24 during the show. I think she has a lovely folksy voice a la Carly Simon. She seems like a genuinely sweet person, too. \n"}, {"text": "Sigh he pshaw murk caught hoe", "correct": "Syesha Mercado", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSyesha Mercado.\n\n\tSyesha was 21 at competition time. She's from Sarasota, Florida. Another talented singer, in my opinion. And she seems very sweet and positive.\r By the way, the word \"pshaw\" is what old-timey Americans used to say to indicate disgust or disbelief: \"Oh, pshaw! That's nonsense and you know it, Paw!\" \n"}]}
