{"id": "397249", "name": "Spider-Man: Homecoming Multiple Choice Quiz |   Movies", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Spider-Man"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these government divisions put Adrian Toomes out of a job?", "correct": "Department of Damage Control", "options": ["Department  of the Interior", "Department of Superheroes", "Department of Defense"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDepartment of Damage Control.\n\n\tIn the wake of the Battle of New York, which saw the invasion of the Chitauri army, contracted salvage worker Adrian Toomes is called off of a job site by representatives of the Department of Damage Control, rendering his services no longer necessary as the government steps in.  As he and his men are dismissed, they pocket some of the alien technology, opting to use it for themselves.  Eight years later, Toomes and his men continue to loot and salvage their technology, outfitting a warehouse and funding their operations by selling their goods behind the scenes.  Business, for them, booms.\rYoung Peter Parker, meanwhile, heads to Berlin to stop Captain America from absconding with the Winter Soldier.  Upon returning to New York, Tony Stark suggests that he keep the new suit he had made for him.  They'll call him if they need him. \n"}, {"text": "Peter finds Toomes' henchmen robbing which of these locations?", "correct": "Bank", "options": ["Bodega", "School", "Coffee shop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBank.\n\n\tTwo months later, Peter waits on the line for the potential of a new mission, constantly messaging Happy Hogan in hopes that something might happen.  He heads to school at the Midtown School of Science and Technology, telling his friends that he has Stark Internship work to do after school.  He doesn't, really, but it does make him restless, and he cancels engagements in his life to prepare for the potential summoning.\rWhen school finally gets out, he grabs something to eat before heading off to an alley and changing into his costume and taking to the skyscrapers to fight some of the city's petty criminals and help locals out.  He calls Happy again when he's done, going straight to voicemail.\rThat evening, he catches a group of criminals (in Avenger masks) using Chitauri weapons to break into the ATMs of a corner bank.  He fights them, but their weapons cause some damage to the nearby buildings and Parker is forced to let them get away.  When he calls Happy to report in later he gets through, but finds out that Stark has sold off the Avengers' headquarters; they're relocating to Upstate New York. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first to discover that Peter Parker is Spider-Man?", "correct": "Ned", "options": ["Aunt May", "Flash", "Liz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNed.\n\n\tPeter sneaks back into his bedroom after a night of fighting crime and though he avoids his Aunt May from discovering his identity, his friend, Ned, is in his bedroom and witnesses him coming in through the window, crawling on the ceiling in his costume.  Peter begs him not to tell anyone that he's basically an Avenger and the only way he can get him to keep quiet is by letting him ask questions. This plan devolves quite a bit at school when Ned reveals, in a big way, that Peter at least knows Spider-Man.  Liz, Peter's crush, reveals that she has her own crush on Spider-Man and she invites him over to a party, and he wears the suit under his clothes, but he tells Ned he won't use it as a party trick. He's nearly provoked into appearing as Spider-Man when others ask for his whereabouts, but when Peter goes outside, he sees the flash of a Chitauri weapon being used nearby and goes to investigate. \n"}, {"text": "Peter witnesses a weapons deal being held and is subsequently attacked by Toomes.  Tony Stark swoops in to save him, but Tony is actually where at the time?", "correct": "India", "options": ["Outer space", "Germany", "Asgard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndia.\n\n\tPeter finds a weapons deal going on under a bridge and swoops in to stop the men from the bank from giving their wares to a local thug.  Using the devices, however, they're able to make a getaway in their van, taking Peter on a ride through the suburbs and starting a long chase through the quiet neighbourhood.  Peter eventually does make it back to the van, taking a shortcut through yards and over houses, but just as he's about to land on the vehicle, he's grabbed by a mysterious figure in a robotic, winged costume and lifted into the skies.  The Spider-suit, however, deploys its parachute, freeing Peter from the claws of the mechanical bird, and sending him hurtling down into a river.  The only thing to save him from drowning in the parachute is an Iron Man suit piloted remotely by Stark who, while in India, tells Peter to stay low and act more like a 'friendly, neighbourhood Spider-Man' instead of getting himself into trouble.  Peter's disappointed, but he locates a piece of broken Chitauri tech that was accidentally left behind.\rToomes, meanwhile, returns to his warehouse angry that his men have opted not to stay under the radar.  He fires one of his men for being such a loose cannon and the guy plans to blackmail him, but Toomes instead shoots him with one of the weapons, immediately distinegrating his former crony and handing his weapons off to the next guy down the line. \n"}, {"text": "To intercept a weapons heist in Maryland, Peter travels with his classmates to Washington D.C. for which of these?", "correct": "Academic decathlon", "options": ["Spelling bee", "Science fair", "Smithsonian visit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAcademic decathlon.\n\n\tIn one of their classes, Peter and Ned break apart Toomes' lost weapon, deciding that they need to analyze its power source.  Walking between classes, however, Peter is surprised when some of Toomes' henchmen arrive to look for their missing weapon.  Peter, hiding, takes the opportunity to plant a high-tech tracker on one of them, and he and Ned determine that they're based in Maryland, possibly at an evil hideaway. It's three hundred miles away from New York, but Peter gets the clever idea to rejoin his academic decathlon team and take a trip with them to a competition in Washington D.C.  After a call from Happy noting his whereabouts, Peter also decides to take the tracker out of his suit. Ned, who looks through the suit's coding, realizes that Peter's suit is running under the 'Training Wheels Protocol', and they decide to deactivate it.  It unlocks superior tracking capabilities, and instead of heading off with his peers, he races out into the night to follow his enemies. \n"}, {"text": "What name does Peter give to the AI in his Spider-suit?", "correct": "Karen", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKaren.\n\n\tPeter heads out of Washington D.C. to find that his tracker leads him to an abandoned gas station and his new suit system alerts him to the fact that there's a heist about to occur.  While Toomes' men wait in a nearby truck, Toomes himself swoops in and uses Chitauri tech to enter through the roof of one of the vehicles in a weapons convoy. Spider-Man intercepts him, but their fight causes him to get trapped inside the truck, knocking him out when he tries to jump and hits his head on the roof.  He only wakes up when the shipping container arrives at the Department of Damage Control's deep storage vault, one of the most secure facilities on the eastern seaboard. Peter, realizing that he has quite a bit of time before the doors will be opened, spends time on a 'refresher course' for his outfit and names the voice in his suit (he goes with Karen).  Time barely goes by in the vault, and when he searches through the Chitauri weapons, Karen informs him that the weapons' power cores are actually explosive; the item in Ned's possession, when exposed to radiation, could be considered a powerful grenade. \n"}, {"text": "The explosive Chitauri core in Ned's possession ends up damaging which of these Washington D.C. landmarks?", "correct": "Washington Monument", "options": ["The White House", "Lincoln Memorial", "The U.S. Capitol"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWashington Monument.\n\n\tPeter ends up running fairly late, only opening the vault door after more than two hundred trials and leaving on the back of a truck in the morning.  He ends up missing the decathlon, but finally gets through to Ned just as their classmates are about to take a celebratory visit to the Washington Monument.  Unfortunately, this means that Ned needs to pass his backpack through the x-ray scanners at the landmark, and when this happens, it causes the small power core inside to detonate while he's in the elevator.  Peter, arriving just too late to stop this from happening, is forced to scale the Washington Monument, break through a thick, glass window near the top, and barely prevent the elevator from plummeting to the ground with Ned and Liz inside of it.\rSpider-Man is lauded as a hero and when Peter and Ned get back to New York City, Peter realizes that all he needs to do to become a full-fledged Avenger is catch Toomes and bring him in for stealing from the Department of Damage Control.  Using Karen's recorded footage and running her facial recognition software, he's able to track down Aaron Davis, the guy who tried to buy the weapons from Toomes' men, and he finds out that Toomes will be doing a deal on the Staten Island ferry that very morning. \n"}, {"text": "Facial recognition software and a tip from a local criminal leads Peter to a fight on which of these, leading to a potentially catastrophic encounter with Toomes?", "correct": "Ferry", "options": ["Elevator", "Subway train", "Double-decker bus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFerry.\n\n\tParker gets out onto the Staten Island ferry and finds the guys he needs to making the deal, and it appears that they're trying to sell weapons to a criminal named Mac Gargan out of the back of a white pickup truck on the boat.  Peter, getting himself involved, rejects a phone call from his Aunt May but can't block out Tony Stark who, uncharacteristically, calls to praise his actions in D.C..  Unfortunately, Peter hangs up on him when he needs to act quickly and it leads to a fight on the boat that brings Toomes out of hiding.  Toomes hops into his suit and takes to the air, firing at Peter and a number of undercover FBI officers on the ferry before Peter nabs the weapon and struggles to keep it under control.  He doesn't know how it works though, and the weapon, backfiring and webbed to the deck, effectively cuts the ferry in half while Toomes and his right-hand man escape.  Peter, thinking quickly, tries to hold the ferry together with his webs, but they snap under the weight and he needs to be saved by Iron Man again.  Tony welds the ship back together before departing, but he later meets with Peter to chew him out for defying his request to stay out of trouble.  Tony, regretting the investment he's made, has Peter hand over the suit.  And then when Peter gets home, May asks him to cut out the lying.  Peter admits to her that he lost the Stark internship.\rToomes worries now that Iron Man is involved and has his men remain by his side, developing a high-altitude seal for a final job. \n"}, {"text": "Peter discovers that Toomes is whose father?", "correct": "Liz's", "options": ["MJ's", "Ned's", "Flash's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiz's.\n\n\tPeter, no longer obligated to be a hero, returns to his studies at school and resumes his life.  Walking through the halls at school, he apologizes to Liz about the decathlon and asks her to go to homecoming with him; she accepts after he admits his crush to her.  When May drops Peter off at Liz's house, he rings the doorbell and her father opens the door.  To Peter's shock, however, Liz's dad is none other than Adrian Toomes.  Toomes is amicable, at least from the outset, and it's all very upsetting for Peter, especially since he's heading out of town and chauffeuring them to the homecoming on the way.  During the drive, Toomes confirms that Peter himself is Spider-Man.  They arrive at the school and before Peter gets out of the car, Toomes warns him never to interfere with his business ever again or he'll kill him.\rPeter heads into the homecoming dance and approaches Liz and his friends despite the thoughts in his head.  He goes to Liz immediately and tells her that he needs to leave, immediately racing down the halls, grabbing his old, hidden costume, and leaving out the back of the school.  Unfortunately, that's where Toomes' henchman is waiting, and Peter is only able to win the fight with Ned's help.  Teaming up Peter heads off, hijacks a fellow student's expensive car, and drives off while ned tracks his phone, cleverly left in the back seat of Toomes' vehicle. \n"}, {"text": "After battling overtop of New York City, Peter and Toomes fight one last battle at which New York City landmark?", "correct": "Coney Island", "options": ["Central Park", "Flushing Meadows", "Liberty Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConey Island.\n\n\tPeter and Ned are able to deduce, from Toomes' whereabouts and Happy's video call, that Toomes plans to take off from a warehouse in Brooklyn to intercept the final removal of high-tech goods from the Avenger's HQ in Stark Tower.  When Peter gets to Toomes' warehouse, Toomes tries to reason with the boy, claiming that he's doing no different from Tony Stark, manufacturing weapons to get by in the world.  The talk gives Toomes the opportunity to remotely fly his wing suit and destroy the building's support pillars, bringing the structure down on Spider-Man.  Peter is barely able to get out of the rubble and pursue Toomes, web-slinging at the last moment to attach himself to Toomes' suit and fly up into the air.  Both of them are able to infiltrate the aircraft, but their fight along its outer sides leads them to destroy several of its turbines, turning the massive jet and all of its contents back towards New York City.  Peter struggles with all his might and redirects the plane to Coney Island's beachfront while Toomes fights to avoid leaving empty-handed, but they crash anyways, landing in front of the boardwalk.  Toomes, enraged by Peter's actions, fights with him in the sand but it's apparent that his vulture costume is beginning to malfunction.  Peter is subdued and Toomes, distracted by a crate of weapons, flies over to get it.  Peter notices that the wings are about to explode, however, and when the suit is finally grounded, he rushes in and carries Toomes out of the wreckage.\rHappy arrives with the authorities to find Toomes webbed to one of the crates, unable to move.  He's subsequently incarcerated.  Liz, forced to move to Oregon on account of her father's arrest, says her goodbyes to Peter.  With Liz gone, Michelle, who goes by MJ, is appointed decathlon team captain.\rHappy texts Peter who meets him in the school bathroom and picks him up to drive to the Avengers compound upstate.  There, Tony apologizes for taking his suit, but the tough love must've helped.  He gives back the suit and tells him that he has a spot on the Avengers, but Peter refuses the offer to join the others on the compound.  He'd rather stay a friendly, neighbourhood Spider-Man.\rTony sends the suit to Peter's apartment anyways, and he puts it on again.  As he stands in front of the mirror wearing his new and improved outfit, he doesn't realize that May is behind him and now knows his identity. \n"}]}
