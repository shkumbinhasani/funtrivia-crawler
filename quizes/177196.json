Johns"], "questions": [{"text": "What name does Ginger use when he serves in the French Foreign Legion?", "correct": "Hepple", "options": ["Thwaite", "White", "Habble"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHepple.\n\n\tBiggles also has his name clipped back and goes under the identity of \"Biggs\". The two of them have joined the legion in order to give a helping hand to Marcel Brissac. Much later in the story Biggles and Ginger find that their paths cross those of Erich von Stalhein. For a while there is even a strange alliance between them. \n"}, {"text": "In which \"Biggles\" book does Ginger make his first appearance?", "correct": "Biggles and the Black Peril", "options": ["Biggles and the Dark Intruder", "Biggles Hits the Trail", "Biggles Makes Ends Meet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBiggles and the Black Peril.\n\n\tGinger and Biggles meet each other somewhere in the north-east of England. By following the geographical logic of the events in the book it is probably in County Durham. However, Johns contradicts this idea later in the book by using Northumberland as the locale. \n"}, {"text": "In which English city do Biggles and Algy ensure that Ginger gets his first decent set of clothes?", "correct": "Newcastle", "options": ["York", "Bristol", "London"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNewcastle.\n\n\tFor a while the comrades are based at Cramlington aerodrome which is a few miles to the north of Newcastle. After Biggles is helped to escape from the house where he is being held the three of them visit Newcastle to make Ginger look more respectable. This all happens in \"Biggles and the Black Peril\". \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Cockney soldier that Ginger befriends when he is forced to join the Republican Army in \"Biggles in Spain\"?", "correct": "Fred Summers", "options": ["Tom Spring", "Fred Winters", "Tom Fall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFred Summers.\n\n\tGinger remains puzzled as to why anyone would travel to a foreign country to fight for a cause about which he himself knows very little. W.E.Johns did not like Franco's fascists but he also had no time for the influence of the Communist party. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Biggles Follows On\" in which European city did Ginger find himself sliding down the slates of a roof made greasy by the rain?", "correct": "Prague", "options": ["Warsaw", "Paris", "East Berlin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrague.\n\n\tJoining him in his slide on the roof was Biggles. Both of them were trying to get away secretly from the \"safe house\" provided by the British agent Smith. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Biggles' Combined Operation\" what is the English translation of the name of the seedy Paris nightclub where Ginger is drugged?", "correct": "The Laughing Horse", "options": ["The Crowing Cockerel", "The Smiling Piglet", "The Running Dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Laughing Horse.\n\n\tGinger is saved by the intervention of Marcel Brissac who leads a raid on the nightclub in question. It is in this book that W.E.Johns extends the cooperation of the members of Interpol to include the police forces of the U.S.A. Eddie Ross proves to be both brave and unsubtle in the tactics he adopts when he comes across drug smugglers. \n"}, {"text": "How does Ginger first try to get a message to the outside world when he is imprisoned in the Chateau de Malboise?", "correct": "He launches paper gliders from the window of the tower.", "options": ["He wraps a piece of paper round a stone and throws it out of the window.", "He flashes a message by using his torch.", "He bribes one of the servants to smuggle a message to Marcel."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe launches paper gliders from the window of the tower.\n\n\tWritten on the wings of the glider were the words \"S.O.S. Urgent.\" As soon as Biggles and Algy find the gliders they know that Ginger and Bertie must be somewhere around. Later the method of using the light and the Morse Code is employed to make further contact. This all happens in \"Biggles and the Noble Lord\". \n"}, {"text": "Why does Biggles give Ginger a severe telling-off in \"Biggles Sweeps the Desert\"?", "correct": "He had disobeyed an order about carrying a water bottle.", "options": ["He had crash-landed his plane at the oasis and spoiled the runway.", "He had followed Biggles into the desert when told not to.", "He had shot Biggles down by accident."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe had disobeyed an order about carrying a water bottle.\n\n\tBiggles even tells Ginger that he would have him put under close arrest for breaking orders if they were anywhere near a service depot. Later in the story he does indeed shoot Biggles down. However, Biggles was flying a Messerschmidt at the time and so this was hardly surprising. Modern editions of this story call it \"Biggles Defends the Desert\". \n"}, {"text": "According to Ginger what is the real name of the scientist and explorer who constantly used to hire the \"Wanderer\" in the selection of stories known as \"Biggles - Charter Pilot\"?", "correct": "Dr. Augustus Duck", "options": ["Dr. Donald Swallow", "Dr. Rupert Curlew", "Dr. Paddy Mallard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Augustus Duck\n\n\tInevitably the three comrades always think of Dr. Augustus Duck as \"Donald\" after the famous Disney cartoon character. The stories in \"Biggles - Charter Pilot\" all contain some element that can be best described as \"fanciful\". No wonder the other members of the squadron to whom Ginger tells them consider them to be \"tall stories\". \n"}, {"text": "In what way does Ginger receive a serious injury in \"Biggles Scores a Bull\"?", "correct": "He is hit by a dart containing a very strong sedative.", "options": ["He is hit a glancing blow by a runaway car.", "He rips open the skin on his leg by falling into a tangle of barbed wire.", "He is gored by a large bull that has suddenly gone mad."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is hit by a dart containing a very strong sedative.\n\n\tFortunately Ginger manages to rip out the dart before he takes the full dose of the drug into his system.

This takes place in \"Biggles 'Fails to Return'\". Unfortunately his onions have been grown in England and they have rather a stronger taste than the ones that normally come from Spain. \n"}, {"text": "In which war-time story does Ginger end up baling out and landing in a thousand-acre paddy field?", "correct": "Biggles in the Orient", "options": ["Biggles' Chinese Puzzle", "Biggles in Borneo", "Biggles Delivers the Goods"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBiggles in the Orient.\n\n\tGinger is in fact shot down in an aerial dogfight near Dum Dum aerodrome in India. The Japanese had launched a large attack, believing perhaps that the \"secret weapon\" they had put into operation would make the members of each squadron afraid to fly. \n"}, {"text": "What item of clothing did Ginger use to deceive the pilot of the Wolf aeroplane in \"Sergeant Bigglesworth C.I.D.\"?", "correct": "His flying jacket", "options": ["His flying goggles", "His flying helmet", "His flying boots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis flying jacket.\n\n\tAs he tried to escape from both the perils of the mine-field and the guns of the Wolf fighter Ginger tears off his jacket in a moment of inspiration in order to give the pilot something to shoot at. The ruse works and, though his jacket is nearly shot to pieces, Ginger survives. \n"}, {"text": "What weapon does Ginger use to save Biggles from von Schonbeck's firing squad in \"Biggles' Second Case\"?", "correct": "A harpoon gun.", "options": ["A hand grenade.", "A bow and arrow.", "A piece of rock."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA harpoon gun.\n\n\tGinger is successful, though the projectile from the harpoon gun actually missed the target. The harpoon glanced off the conning tower of the submarine and caught Thom, one of the Nazis, on the rebound. The rope that was trailing from the harpoon sent the rest of the firing squad into total confusion and so Biggles escapes. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Another Job for Biggles\" why does Ginger become so ill in the desert?", "correct": "He has accidentally drunk water that was polluted with the drug called gurra.", "options": ["He has been forced by the villain Ambrinos to inject himself with the drug called gurra.", "He has eaten dates which have been grown next to the drug called gurra.", "He has been drugged by the smoke that rises when they burn out the drug called gurra."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has accidentally drunk water that was polluted with the drug called gurra.\n\n\tMany times Ginger finds himself getting into trouble during the long saga of the \"Biggles\" books. This time he is just unlucky that he is the one that chances to drink the infected water and have the hallucinations which follow. \n"}]}
