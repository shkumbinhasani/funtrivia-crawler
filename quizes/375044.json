The audience is introduced to the character of the rock star, Pink. The background sound effects of the dive bomber and then the baby crying subtly introduce the idea that Pink's father was killed in the war, leaving his mother alone to raise him. \rWalters has said that the writing of \"The Wall\" was inspired by an incident when he spat at a fan trying to climb the fence separating the crowd from the band during the 1977 \"In the Flesh?\" tour, hence the eventual title of the opening track.\rTrack 21 on the album reprises the song, although now it is called \"In the Flesh\" (without the \"?\". This time, the same opening two lines are followed by:\r\"I've got some bad news for you, sunshine,\rPink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel,\rAnd they sent us along as a surrogate band,\rAnd we're going to find out where you fans really stand.\" \n"}, {"text": "After the first installment of \"Another Brick in the Wall\" comes \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\". This is the concluding stanza of that track:\n\"But in the town it was well known\nWhen they got home at night\nTheir ________________ wives would thrash them\nWithin inches of their lives\"\n\nWhat are the missing words?", "correct": "Fat and Psychopathic", "options": ["Fat and Ugly", "Dull and Scrawny", "Dull Unsympathetic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFat and Psychopathic.\n\n\tThis track runs less than two minutes, with the first 25 seconds taken up by helicopter sound effects. This short track segues into \"Another Brick in the Wall Part II\", so it is often played as an extended intro to that track. \r The track fills in the backstory of the embittered rock star Pink, tell of his experience at a school where strict teachers regularly treated pupils with contempt. The lyrics of this song are another of the autobiographical references from Roger Waters, reflecting his negative memories of school. \n"}, {"text": "The final track on the first side of disc one is \"Mother\":\n\"Hush now baby, baby don't you cry\nMamma's going to check out all your girlfriends for you\nAnd mamma ____________________________ \"?\n\nWhat are the missing words?", "correct": "Won't Let Anyone Dirty Get Through", "options": ["Won't Let Anyone Nasty Hurt You", "Will Make Certain She's Loving and True", "Will Make Sure That She Will Love You"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWon't Let Anyone Dirty Get Through.\n\n\t\"Mother\" is (IMHO) one of the really outstanding tracks on the album. The song lays out how Pink's adolescent sex life was controlled by his domineering mother, as she 'helps' him build the metaphorical wall in order to protect him from the outside world. \rRoger and David share the lyrics on this track. Early on Gilmour (as the Mother) tells her son \"Of course mother's gonna help build the wall\", and the song concludes with Waters (as Pink) asking plaintively \"Mother, did it need to be so high?\"\rBrilliant stuff! \n"}, {"text": "The Blitz is remembered in \"Goodbye Blue Sky\":\n\"D-d-did you see the _________ ones\n D-d-did you hear the _________ bombs\n D-d-did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise\n Of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky\"\n\nWhat are the two missing words?", "correct": "Frightened/Falling", "options": ["Hiding/Whistling", "Screaming/Flying", "Running/Screaming"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrightened/Falling.\n\n\t\"Goodbye Blue Sky\" opens the second side of Disc 1 on the album, but in the film it precedes \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\". \rLess than three minutes in length, the track begins starts by creating an impression of peace with a bird singing. Then comes the drone of the approaching bombers. \"Look mummy, there's an airplane up in the sky\" says a child.\rDuring the 1990 \"Live in Berlin\" performances Joni Mitchell sang the lyrics for this song. \n"}, {"text": "The rock star Pink is on the road, and enjoying the lifestyle in \"Young Lust\":\n\"Will some _____ woman in this desert land\nMake me feel like a real man\nTake this rock 'n' roll refugee\nOh, baby set me free\"", "correct": "Cold", "options": ["Cool", "Wild", "Hot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCold.\n\n\tRich and famous now, Pink is on tour. Away from his mother and his wife, Pink seeks to relieve the boredom of the relentless trek from venue to venue via casual sex.\rAt the end of this blues/rock track we then Pink trying to call home from the U.S. --  \"a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd\". A man answers and keeps hanging up on the international operator, and thus Pink learns that his wife is cheating on him. \n"}, {"text": "Pink's life spirals further and further out of control in \"One of My Turns\":\n\"Run to the bedroom in the suitcase on the left\nYou'll find my _________________\nDon't look so frightened\nThis is just a passing phase, one of my bad days\"\n\nWhat are the missing words?\n", "correct": "Favorite Axe", "options": ["Sleeping Pills", "Trusty Sword", "Brand New Suit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFavorite Axe.\n\n\tThis is a song of three parts that begins with Pink inviting a star-struck groupie back to his hotel room. The groupie was played by Jenny Wright (\"The World According to Garp\") in the film, but on the album the part is voice by Toni Tennille of the 70s pop duo Captain & Tennille.\rIgnoring the groupie, Pink muses on his failing marriage: \"Day after day, love turns gray, like the skin of a dying man...\" and expresses how he feels: \"...cold as a razor blade, Tight as a tourniquet, Dry as a funeral drum\". Then Pink suddenly explodes (as does the song), scaring the girl away and trashing the room. \rThe song ends with Pink descending into self-pity: \"Why are you running away?\"\r Truly masterful song-writing from Roger Waters. \n"}, {"text": "Bizarrely edited out of the film because someone thought it was getting too long, the second disc of the album begins with a truly great track, \"Hey You\":\n\"Hey you, out there on your own\nSitting _________________\nWould you touch me\"\n\nWhat are the missing words?", "correct": "Naked by the Phone", "options": ["Waiting for Someone", "Kingly on the Throne", "Playing with a Bone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNaked by the Phone.\n\n\tSide two of the album (and the second half of the stage show) begins with the rock legend Pink behind the fully completed wall, cut off from the world and the society he has shunned. The fans still come to his concerts, but they don't really see him any more: \"Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles\".\rAs the song goes on, Pink realizes that no one can hear him and that there is no escape: \"But, it was only a fantasy. The wall was too high, as you can see. No matter how he tried, he could not break free. And the worms ate into his brain\".\rAll I can say is \"what were the filmmakers thinking\". It truly is hard to believe that they chose to cut out one of the really iconic scenes and, for some fans, the best track on the album. \n"}, {"text": "Pink's mental isolation behind the wall is summed up in \"Nobody's Home\":\n\"I've got electric light, I've got _____________\nGot amazing powers of observation\nAnd that is how I know when I try to get through\nOn the telephone to you, there'll be nobody home\"\n\nWhat are the missing words?", "correct": "Second Sight", "options": ["Great Insight", "Plenty of Fight", "Power of Flight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSecond Sight.\n\n\tSitting behind his mental wall, Pink is surrounded by all the possessions of stardom: \"I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm, And the inevitable pinhole burns\rAll down the front of my favorite satin shirt...\" What he doesn't have, though, is anyone to talk to. \r\"Nobody's Home\" was the last song written for the album. In an interview 30 years on, David Gilmour picked this track as his favorite, commenting that it describes the state of mind of many touring rock stars. \n"}, {"text": "I couldn't have a quiz about \"The Wall\" without including the iconic \"Comfortably Numb\":\n\"There is no pain, you are receding\n A ____________________ on the horizon\n You are only coming through in waves\n Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'\"\n\nWhat are the missing words?", "correct": "Distant Ship's Smoke", "options": ["Growing Coastline", "Glowing Sunrise", "Far Off Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDistant Ship's Smoke.\n\n\t\"Another Brick in the Wall\" is probably the song that most casual watchers and listeners will know from \"The Wall\", but the favorite of many real Floyd fans and, certainly, of many guitar players, is surely \"Comfortably Numb\". Not only is this a fabulous rock song but it contains the greatest (okay, one of the greatest then) guitar solos ever written. Being one member of an 80,000-strong choir that sang along with \"Comfortably Numb\" at Wembley Stadium during the \"Roger Waters - The Wall\" tour of 2013 is something I'll always remember.\rThe last song on side one of Disc 2, this is where Pink's manager finds him unconscious in his trashed hotel room. \rRoger sings the verses in the character of the doctor treating the adult Pink, whilst the chorus is sung by David, playing the part of the delirious Pink reverting to his childhood. \rJust brilliant! \n"}, {"text": "The album virtually ends with \"The Trial\", where Pink is accused of \"showing feeling, showing feelings of almost human nature\". He has a defence, though:\n\"Crazy. Toys in the attic, I am crazy\nTruly _______________\nThey must have taken my marbles away\"\n\nWhat are the missing words?", "correct": "Gone Fishing", "options": ["Barking Mad", "Elevator's Stopped", "Out to Lunch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGone Fishing.\n\n\tPink's superstar life, filled with emotional turmoil and substance abuse, is judged. The witnesses against him are all those people who have driven him to the state in which he finds himself, the abusive schoolteacher, the dominant mother and the cheating wife. \rFound guilty, Pink is sentenced to the worse possible fate: \"Since, my friend, you have revealed your, deepest fear, I sentence you to be exposed before your peers... Tear down the wall!\"\rThe packed courtroom erupts into chants of \"Tear Down the Wall. Tear Down the Wall, etc. \n"}]}
