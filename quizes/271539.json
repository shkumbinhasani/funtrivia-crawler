{"id": "271539", "name": "Dungeons of \"Twilight Princess\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "Where can you find the Ball and Chain?", "correct": "Snowpeak Ruins", "options": ["Lakebed Temple", "City in the Sky", "Forest Temple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnowpeak Ruins.\n\n\tThe Ball and Chain is a new weapon in the \"Legend of Zelda\" series as it was introduced in this game.  Although it is heavy to lug around, it is extremely powerful and can break numerous structures.  Snowpeak Ruins is in the northeast region of Hyrule, and it is the home to Yeta and Yeto.  Yeta will later become the boss of the area due to a Twilit Parasite that causes her to become the irate Blizzeta.  This area is a large mansion, but due to its poor upkeep, it is in ruin during your visit. \n"}, {"text": "Which dungeon is home to the Darknut mini-boss?", "correct": "Temple of Time", "options": ["Snowpeak Ruins", "City in the Sky", "Palace of Twilight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTemple of Time.\n\n\tThis mini-boss is found in one of the highest points of the Temple of Time and it guards the elusive Dominion Rod.  This strong sword-fighter is covered in armor, much like the Iron Knuckles of \"Ocarina of Time\".  Attacking him where there's less armor (in the back) usually results in a smooth win.  The Temple of Time can only be accessed through a door to the past.  In order to enter this, you must fuel up the Master Sword and place it back into the Pedestal of Time. \n"}, {"text": "In which dungeon do you need to fight Helmasaurs for the first time?", "correct": "Lakebed Temple", "options": ["Goron Mines", "City in the Sky", "Temple of Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLakebed Temple.\n\n\tThese creatures are known for wearing large metallic helmets over their bodies, and until you find your Clawshot, the only way to defeat it is by slicing at the exposed areas on its body.  Luckily, this Lakebed Temple is the home of the Clawshot, as well as the final Fused Shadow Piece.  To navigate the watery expanses of this unique, spinning temple, you will need to use the Zora Armor, which needs to be found before you enter the temple.  You'll need to talk to Rutela about this. \n"}, {"text": "In which province is the first dungeon/temple of the game?", "correct": "Faron Province", "options": ["Lanayru Province", "Eldin Province", "Ordon Province"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaron Province.\n\n\tThe first temple of the game is in the northeast corner of Faron Province.  To enter this temple, aptly named the Forest Temple, you will need to overcome your wolf form and return the area to normality by collecting the numerous bits of light that spawn from defeating Twilit Parasites and placing them into the Vessel of light bestowed upon you by the spirit of Faron himself.  In the Forest Temple, you will need to free various captured monkeys to cross large gaps in the area, and you will need to claim the Gale Boomerang. \n"}, {"text": "This dungeon does not need to be visited in the game.  Which dungeon are you in if you can visit the Great Fairy?", "correct": "Cave of Ordeals & The Cave of Ordeals", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCave of Ordeals & The Cave of Ordeals.\n\n\tThis cave, found in the expanses of the Gerudo Desert, is home to some of the most fearsome beasts in Hyrule.  Every tenth floor, you will meet a fairy who will unleash tons of friendly, bottle-loving fairies at certain fountains around the continent.  When you reach the fiftieth and final floor though, you will meet the Great Fairy, who will bestow upon you an unlimited supply of Fairy Tears.  However, this is only after you have journeyed to fight against some of Hyrule's most terrifying foes such as Darknuts, Redeads, and Armos. \n"}, {"text": "In which dungeon, can you first come across Stalfos and Ghoul Rats?", "correct": "Arbiter's Grounds", "options": ["Temple of Time", "City in the Sky", "Goron Mines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArbiter's Grounds.\n\n\tThis fourth dungeon is the sandy home of some powerful denizens who will keep you from reaching the Mirror Chamber at the top.  Stalfos are popular opponents from earlier games who are powerful swordfighters (though not the most powerful).  Ghoul Rats, on the other hand, are new creatures who will slow you down in certain rooms.  To spot them, turn into a wolf and turn on your senses.  Shake them off by spin attacking and defeat them.  Arbiter's Grounds is in the east end of Hyrule. \n"}, {"text": "Which dungeon contains the Sol Spheres?", "correct": "Palace of Twilight", "options": ["Arbiter's Grounds", "Temple of Time", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPalace of Twilight.\n\n\tOnce you and Midna cross the darkness and use the Mirror of Twilight at the Mirror Chamber of the Arbiter's Grounds, you can travel to the penultimate dungeon of the game, the Palace of Twilight.  It is here that Midna was destined to take her father's place on the throne, and it's also where you need to defeat the evil Zant, who has attempted to take over both the light and dark world.  It is also in this location that you discover that Zant isn't the real mastermind behind it all.  The Sol Spheres are needed to add the power of light to the Master Sword. \n"}, {"text": "Which dungeon contains Gor Amoto?", "correct": "Goron Mines & The Goron Mines", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoron Mines & The Goron Mines.\n\n\tWhen venturing through the Goron Mines, Gor Amoto, Gor Liggs, and Gor Ebizo are all encountered on the journey.  You must meet all three of these Gorons scattered through the mines in order to obtain three separate shards of the Boss Key allowing you to enter the chamber containing Darbus.  Gor Coron, on the other hand, is fought before entering the Goron Mines altogether, as he is the one that allows your entry to the dungeon. The Goron Mines contains the second ranged weapon of the game (and one of the most important overall; the Hero's Bow.  Quivers for this bow are found in Hyrule Castle Town. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Link find the second Clawshot of the game?", "correct": "City in the Sky", "options": ["Arbiter's Grounds", "Palace of Twilight", "Lakebed Temple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCity in the Sky.\n\n\tThis dungeon of the game is found in the heavens, and it is only accessible if you have repaired the giant Oocca cannon from underneath Renado's hut in Kakariko Village.  Once you've found the characters of the Ancient Sky Book with the power of the Dominion Rod, this can be done.  Pay a 300 rupee fee to Fyer to set yourself up and you'll be shot into the stars.  In this dungeon, the home of the Oocca tribe, you can create the Double Clawshot with the second Clawshot of the game.  You can also face off against the evil Argorok; the boss of the City in the Sky. \n"}, {"text": "What is the final location in the game containing a Dungeon Map?", "correct": "Hyrule Castle", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyrule Castle.\n\n\tWhen you've beaten the Palace of Twilight, Midna will have enough power to remove the powerful forcefield surrounding Hyrule Castle.  You can enter it when this is done.  Inside, you can ascend to the tallest tower, defeating the most powerful enemies of Hyrule, and find Ganondorf sitting in the throne.  He will possess Princess Zelda and you will face her and the first form of Ganon in the castle before Midna forces you and Zelda out of the structure.  When it is finally destroyed, you will face off against Ganon in Hyrule Field. \n"}]}
