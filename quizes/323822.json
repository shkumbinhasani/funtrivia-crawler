{"id": "323822", "name": "Isaac Asimov's Galactic Empire Quiz / Test | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors A-C", " Isaac Asimov"], "questions": [{"text": "\"The Stars, Like Dust\" (1951), the first book in the internal chronology of this loose series, begins with a young man named Biron Farrill, just about to graduate from the University of Earth. Humanity's home planet seems to have had a hard time, though; no one wanders about on its surface without precautions. What's wrong with Earth?", "correct": "Much of its surface is radioactive.", "options": ["It has lost its atmosphere.", "Violent crime is a constant threat.", "It has warmed catastrophically."], "explanation": "\n\n\nMuch of its surface is radioactive.\n\n\tThe second page of the book sets a grim mood for Earth: \"Nuclear warfare had done its worst to Earth. Most of it was hopelessly radioactive and useless. There was nothing left to lose...\" Entering students at the university buy a Geiger counter and a wristwatch that doubles as a personal monitor for radiation exposure. So when someone plants a radiation bomb in Biron's room, he takes it very seriously -- and is sucked into a conspiracy on a grand scale.\r The catastrophic radioactivity of future Earth is a recurring motif in Asimov's books, although as the years went by and the threat of a U.S.-U.S.S.R. nuclear war receded, he evolved a new explanation for this sad state of affairs. Check out his \"Robots and Empire\" for more. \n"}, {"text": "Biron Farrill spends \"The Stars, Like Dust\" peeling off one layer of conspiracy after another. It turns out that his father has been executed for opposing their oppressive interstellar overlords; where he failed, can Biron hope to succeed? What not-particularly-subtle name does Asimov give to the people ruling the Nebular Kingdoms?", "correct": "The Tyranni", "options": ["The Romans", "The Robots", "The Borg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Tyranni.\n\n\tHumanity has been spread out over the galaxy for thousands of years, and now some worlds are starting to flex their muscles and dominate their neighbors. The Tyranni (who hail from the planet Tyrann, of course) have spent fifty years dominating the planetary kingdoms on the far side of the Horsehead Nebula.(Amusingly, the meaning of that name has been lost over time, and Nebular folk etymologists refer to a mythical space explorer named Horace Hedd.) The Tyranni are sketched out here as classic cardboard villains: less physically attractive than the denizens of the fifty worlds they rule, they rely on \"devious methods, intrigues, assassination.\" Unfortunately, this novel does not show Asimov at the top of his game. \n"}, {"text": "As Biron drifts from danger to danger in \"The Stars, Like Dust,\" he occasionally thinks back to a mysterious document his father had asked him to find on Earth. It's \"the strongest weapon in the universe,\" and it may be the key to victory, yet he never manages to find it -- until the end of the book, when one of the conspirators reveals he's had it all along. What is this familiar manuscript?", "correct": "The U.S. Constitution", "options": ["A blueprint for a new interstellar drive", "Vogon poetry", "The Desiderata"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe U.S. Constitution\n\n\tThe U.S. Constitution won't help defeat the Tyranni directly, but, in the words of one conspirator, it will help \"hold our winnings once we had won ... Without it, we could perhaps defeat the Tyranni, but we would only have exchanged one feudal despotism for another.\" Armed with a blueprint for democracy, however, our heroes are confident that freedom will reign!\r This big reveal at the end of the book is rather heavy-handed and unsatisfying; Asimov was said to have regretted the whole subplot soon after the book was published. \n"}, {"text": "The second book in the series, \"The Currents of Space\" (1952), takes us to the two worlds of Florina and Sark. Florina has many problems, but it's the sole source of kyrt -- a substance the galaxy doesn't want to do without. What is kyrt?", "correct": "A fiber based on cellulose", "options": ["A type of truffle", "A beautiful crystal", "A ferromagnetic metal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA fiber based on cellulose.\n\n\tMidway through the book, Lady Samia Fife muses on the miraculous kyrt: \"Of course kyrt didn't really shine of itself, but properly spun, it would gleam metallically in the sun in a variety of colors or in all colors at once ... Its fibers could be spun finer than the most delicate synthetics and those same fibers had a tensile strength no steel alloy could duplicate.\" People have tried to grow kyrt on other worlds, but away from Florina, it grows \"white, flat, weak and useless. Not even honest cotton.\"\r Its immensely valuable kyrt crop could have been a blessing for Florina, but instead, the people of that planet are horribly oppressed by the Squires of Sark, and their riches flow to that other world. Until something changes... \n"}, {"text": "\"The Currents of Space\" begins with a man -- an Earthman -- warning of terrible danger to the planet of Florina. He is appalled when the leader he's meeting seems unconcerned with this peril -- and things only get worse when the leader attacks him. What happens to this poor Earthman, whom we later come to know as Rik?", "correct": "His mind is damaged when he is psycho-probed.", "options": ["He is confined to a dank and isolated cell.", "He is murdered.", "He is terribly scarred."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis mind is damaged when he is psycho-probed.\n\n\tHis assailant -- whom we'll call X, as amateur detectives do later in the book -- uses a psychic probe, which is supposed to be for use in the criminal justice system. The probe can be used to make subtle suggestions or suppress certain types of feelings, but it is used quite heavily on our Earthman. He ends up in a ditch just outside a Florinian peasant village, unable to walk or talk or take care of himself.The villagers call him \"Rik\" after their term for mental retardation. But slowly, under the patient care of a village woman named Lona, Rik begins to recover himself -- and, after almost a year, he remembers why he came to Florina.Suddenly, Rik's and Lona's quiet world is a dangerous place. \n"}, {"text": "At the beginning of \"The Currents of Space,\" Florina and its five hundred million people are in terrible danger, but almost no one seems to know. After two hundred pages of intrigue, Florina is still in terrible danger, but at least its people are being evacuated. What is the nature of Florina's peril?", "correct": "Its sun is going to go nova.", "options": ["An enormous comet is on the way.", "It is going to be invaded by fanatics.", "A fungus is devastating the kyrt supply."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIts sun is going to go nova.\n\n\tOver the course of the book, Rik slowly remembers his old job: he was a Spatio-analyst. Their joking motto is \"We analyze Nothing\"; what they actually do, alone in ships in the vast vacuum of space, is analyze tiny particles of interstellar dust -- the \"currents of space.\" And what Rik did, just before the novel's opening scene, was to realize that Florina and its sun were in the path of one of those currents, which had turned the star into a time bomb even as it made kyrt possible. Florina must be evacuated, but its people are kept in ignorance by the ruling Sarkites, who are not exactly anxious to abandon their gold mine. To see how this circle is squared, I highly recommend that you spend a few hours with the book!\r As a scientific note, although Asimov's description of stellar fusion contains some very solid nuclear physics, we now know that stars go nova due to internal factors rather than external currents of interstellar dust. Give the author credit, though: this wasn't fully worked out until decades after he wrote the book! \n"}, {"text": "\"Pebble in the Sky\" (1950) is set much later than the other books, at a time when the Galactic Empire is at its height. Joseph Schwartz, a 62-year-old tailor from 1949, is mysteriously transported to Earth of the far future. But Earth culture has changed, and he is in danger of the Sixty. What does \"the Sixty\" refer to?", "correct": "Earth people must submit to euthanasia on their sixtieth birthdays.", "options": ["Life beyond the sixtieth parallel is extremely dangerous.", "Each Earth adult must fill a daily quota of sixty pounds of metal ore.", "The Imperial Council of Sixty carefully monitors Earth people for seditious thoughts."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarth people must submit to euthanasia on their sixtieth birthdays.\n\n\tEarth's ubiquitous mid-level radioactivity makes life on the planet difficult (though we now know it would actually make life impossible). The planet is poor and its people mostly subsistence farmers; the harsh conditions have led to the Sixty, where people report to special centers to be put to death on their sixtieth birthdays. This \"custom\" is strictly enforced, with penalties for recalcitrant family members as well. Schwartz will be in big trouble once his age is learned! \n"}, {"text": "Toward the middle of \"Pebble in the Sky,\" Joseph Schwartz develops some powerful psychic abilities. What he calls a \"Mind Touch\" allows him to detect other people, control their gross movements, and even -- if necessary -- kill. How does he come by these powers?", "correct": "He is subjected to an experimental device to improve his ability to learn.", "options": ["He trains for ten years on another planet.", "They are triggered by Earth's environment.", "He receives a mind meld from another telepath."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is subjected to an experimental device to improve his ability to learn.\n\n\tThe Synapsifier, brainchild of an Earth physicist named Affret Shekt, \"is supposed to improve the learning capacity of the mammalian nervous system.\" It has killed many of its test subjects, but Schwartz -- volunteered by the terrified family that first found him -- survives and thrives. he learns the local language rapidly -- and soon his mental powers expand beyond what he had dreamed possible. \n"}, {"text": "The leaders of Earth are plotting against the Galactic Empire -- yet, considering population alone, they face \"odds of twenty-five billion to one\"! In \"Pebble in the Sky,\" what is Earth's plan to even those odds?", "correct": "A specially engineered virus", "options": ["A political assassination", "A web of secret alliances", "Time travel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA specially engineered virus.\n\n\tBecause of its radioactivity, Earth is home to some uniquely hardy lifeforms -- so Earth viruses are exceptionally difficult to kill. Using the Synapsifier to enhance their abilities, Earth virologists have developed a lethal strain to which the people of Earth will, alone, have immunity. Earth's leaders plan to spread the virus by stealth, until they can achieve independence by making billions of corpses around the galaxy. Let's hope our heroes can save the day! \n"}, {"text": "As these three novels -- \"The Stars, Like Dust,\" \"The Currents of Space,\" and \"Pebble in the Sky\" -- progress, the Galactic Empire grows more powerful. What planet is at the center of this Empire?", "correct": "Trantor", "options": ["Coruscant", "Earth", "Sark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrantor.\n\n\tIt is Trantor, loosely modeled on the Roman Empire, that rises to greatness in the background of this loosely defined trilogy. For thousands of years, Trantor's dominance keeps the galaxy at peace -- until the Empire crumbles and falls. Asimov's justly famous \"Foundation\" series explores the aftermath of this collapse, and one group's efforts to shorten the resulting galactic Dark Age. \n"}]}
