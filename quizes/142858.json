{"id": "142858", "name": "'Harold and Maude' (Part 1) Quiz | Harold and Maude . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "   Movies H-K", "Harold and Maude"], "questions": [{"text": "The film opens in a dark room, with the youthful Harold setting up one of his many mock suicide attempts.  Accompanying the opening scene (and credits) is a tune by which great songwriter of the 1960s and 70s?  ", "correct": "Cat Stevens", "options": ["Van Morrison", "Jimi Hendrix", "Paul Simon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCat Stevens.\n\n\tAs a matter of fact, Cat Stevens wrote all the songs for the 'Harold and Maude' soundtrack, and they are wonderful songs indeed.  The opening scene is accompanied by the tune 'Don't Be Shy'.  Cat Stevens was born Stephen Georgiou. Yusuf Islam became his new name in 1978 when he decided to end his career in folk music and become a Muslim. \n"}, {"text": "Speaking of our clever but shiftless friend Harold, which actor portrayed him in this wonderful 1971 film?", "correct": "Bud Cort", "options": ["Peter Fonda", "Jon Voight", "Harvey Keitel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBud Cort.\n\n\tBud Cort was but 23 years old when 'Harold and Maude' hit the theaters in 1971.  He had appeared in the Robert Altman film 'M*A*S*H' just the year before, and his career was looking quite promising.  Unfortunately, the poor chap passed up the lead role in the 1975 film 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (that went to Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson.) It seems that Cort did not want to be typecast in offbeat roles.  His career never really blossomed, perhaps as a result of this error. \n"}, {"text": "What method of 'suicide' does Harold choose for his first depicted attempt in the film?", "correct": "Hanging", "options": ["Drowning", "Electrocution", "Leaping off of a building"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHanging.\n\n\tHarold's first suicide attempt of the film seems not to shock his mother at all.  She simply asks rhetorically, 'I suppose you think that is very funny, Harold?' and then makes a phone call.  In the background can be heard choking sounds from the bored boy...but somehow, I don't think this is the end of him. \n"}, {"text": "Harold's mother is played magnificently by Vivien Pickles, an English actress who has appeared in entirely too few films indeed!  What is the last name that is shared by Harold and his exceedingly ostentatious mother?", "correct": "Chasen", "options": ["Engles", "Cusack", "Madigan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChasen.\n\n\tThere is never any explanation for the family's wealth, but one must suspect old money in this case.  Harold's mother is exceptionally well-heeled, and maintains a rather cosmopolitan air about her.  Vivien Pickles plays her in such a way that pushes her beyond simple snooty pretentiousness, she is a bona fide snob! \n"}, {"text": "Though Harold's first 'suicide' did not seem to have much affect on his mother, he is undaunted.  The second such attempt is rather gory, involving phony blood smeared all over which room of the house?", "correct": "Bathroom", "options": ["Kitchen", "Study", "Dining room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBathroom.\n\n\tHarold's mother seems unaffected by all of his suicide attempts save this one.  The mess he has created in her bathroom (we see Harold lying 'dead' in the bathtub, covered in mock blood) is clearly more upsetting to Mrs. Chasen than the fact that her son has an obvious mental problem!  Her reaction in this scene is quite amusing! \n"}, {"text": "Harold regularly visits a psychiatrist, played by G. Wood (of 'M*A*S*H' fame), during the film.  During his first visit to the psychiatrist's office, what does Harold announce as his favorite hobby?", "correct": "Attending funerals", "options": ["Terrorizing his mother", "Nauseating his dates", "Watching autopsies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttending funerals.\n\n\tThe bald-pated G. Wood played General Hammond in both the film and television versions of 'M*A*S*H'.  This seemingly distinguished gentleman plays a very straight-laced psychiatrist in 'Harold and Maude', and does so with a really cheesy rug! \n"}, {"text": "After his visit to the psychiatrist, Harold is off to get a new vehicle.  What sort of vehicle does the young man select for his driving pleasure?", "correct": "Hearse", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHearse.\n\n\tHis big, black hearse is ideal for pursuing his favorite hobbie, attending funerals.  What better way to arrive at a funeral than in a hearse? (Better to arrive in one than leave that way, I always say...)  Harold's mother is suitably shocked by the hearse that she calls a 'monstrosity' and an 'ugly black horror'. \n"}, {"text": "Harold's mother, finally responding to Harold's antics, sends him off to see his Uncle Victor, a military careerist.  Victor served as which World War II general's right-hand man, according to Harold's mom?", "correct": "MacArthur", "options": ["Patton", "Bradley", "Eisenhower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMacArthur.\n\n\tUncle Victor is every bit the regular army careerist one would expect, enthusiastic, aggressive, and having a total lack of understanding for kids from Harold's generation.  He even has a picture of Richard Nixon hanging on the wall of his office! \n"}, {"text": "During Uncle Victor's speech to Harold about the many advantages of military life, he claims that the nation needs more men like which individual?", "correct": "Nathan Hale", "options": ["Alvin York", "Stonewall Jackson", "Audie Murphy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNathan Hale.\n\n\tSome of Uncle Victor's promises: to see the war first hand, to make a man out of Harold, to travel the world and to meet plenty of 'slant-eyed' girls (not a very PC statement, then or now!)  As for Nathan Hale, his picture is also on the Uncle's wall, and he salutes the picture with his right shirt sleeve (which is rigged with a string...his arm is missing.) \n"}, {"text": "After another 'suicide' attempt, we find Harold back at the psychiatrist's office.  This time, the topic of his staged deaths is discussed.  How many of these phony suicide attempts does Harold estimate he has performed?", "correct": "15", "options": ["6", "21", "28"], "explanation": "\n\n\n15.\n\n\tHis 'suicide' just prior to this visit to the shrink is one of my favorites.  We find Harold floating face down in the backyard pool while his mother does her leisure swimming, all accompanied by a Rachmaninoff piano concerto.  The magic of director Hal Ashby!  Well, that leads us to the end of this quiz, please feel free to try my other 'Harold and Maude' quizzes if it so pleases you...thanks. \n"}]}
