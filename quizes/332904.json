Carl Hubbell led the team with a 23-12 record, Hal Schumacher went 19-12, Freddie Fitzsimmons went 16-11, and their final starter Roy Parmelee went 13-8.  They all combined for a 2.47 ERA.  Which team was this?", "correct": "1933 Giants", "options": ["1951 Cardinals", "1894 Reds", "1912 Pirates"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1933 Giants.\n\n\tThe Giants could muster only one eight-game winning streak in the season, but it was more than enough by winning the National League by five games over the Pirates.  The Giants won the World Series against the Senators, four games to one, with Hubbell winning two of the games.  Carl also won the 1933 NL MVP. \n"}, {"text": "In ninth place of the greatest ever pitching staffs, this team rostered Gaylord Perry, Juan Marichal, Mike McCormick, and Ray Sadecki as their starters.

Their starters were Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Claude Osteen, and Don Sutton.  Even their closer Phil Regan went 14-1 in the season.  The staff led the league in strikeouts, fewest walks, fewest runs, fewest hits, threw the most shutouts, etc.  They easily went to the World Series, but fell apart in the series without winning even one game. One pitcher's religious beliefs threw the entire series out of kilter.

Koufax, who is Jewish, refused to pitch the opening game in October due to Yom Kippur, so Drysdale would take his place.  It threw the pitching staff so far out of balance, that the Orioles would have their way in every game, shutting the Dodgers out three times.  The Dodgers scored just two runs in the entire series.  Koufax would retire with a 27-9 record, the Cy Young Award, and the Triple Crown all in the 1966 season. \n"}, {"text": "The seventh greatest pitching staff is from the 1940s.

Their four primary starters, Eddie Plank, Rube Waddell, Andy Coakley, and Chief Bender all won 18 or more games in the season.  Their pitching ranked first in strikeouts and fewest hits allowed.
