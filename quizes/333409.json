This means they are cold blooded and must use the sun and their surroundings to help them control their inner temperature. They may sit out on a rock in the sun to get warm and then climb under the same rock to cool off. \n"}, {"text": "Chameleons' eyes are stereoscopic, which means they can do which of the following?", "correct": "They can move in different directions at the same time.", "options": ["Their eyes are on their tail.", "They can see with their eyes closed.", "They change color as the chameleon gets older."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey can move in different directions at the same time.\n\n\tChameleons' stereoscopic eyes can move in different directions at the same time. This gives them a much broader view of the world around them and gives them some of the best eyesight in the reptile world. Because their eyes stick out from their heads it is very easy for anyone to see their eyes moving around in different ways. Our eyes work together and move in the same direction. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following statements is true concerning the tongue of a chameleon?", "correct": "It is very long and very fast-moving.", "options": ["It is purple.", "It has stripes on it.", "Chameleons have no tongue."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is very long and very fast-moving.\n\n\tChameleons have long, thin tongues that move very quickly to snag bugs and other food. Often, they have tongues that are longer than their own bodies, sometimes twice as long. Their tongues have special muscles that make it possible for them to move their tongue so fast that they can grab a fly out of mid-air. The fly sticks to the sticky saliva and the tongue curls right back into the chameleon's mouth at lighting speed. \n"}, {"text": "Some chameleons have the ability to make themselves look larger using which of their body's organs?", "correct": "Lungs", "options": ["Heart", "Kidneys", "Brain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLungs.\n\n\tSome chameleons have very large lungs that can run the length of their body. During periods of courtship or when threatened they can increase their size to almost twice as big by filling their lungs with air. \n"}, {"text": "What is the most notable general difference between the tail of other lizards and the tail of a chameleon?", "correct": "A chameleon's tail is curled, a lizard's tail is straight.", "options": ["Chameleons' tails are covered in feathers.", "Chameleons have four tails and lizards have one.", "Chameleons have no tails."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA chameleon's tail is curled, a lizard's tail is straight.\n\n\tChameleons have tails that curl up tightly like a pin-wheel, while most lizards have tails that are straight. Chameleons have what is called a prehensile tail, which means that they are able to grasp things such as branches and twigs with their tails. \n"}, {"text": "What is the favored food of most chameleons?", "correct": "Insects and spiders", "options": ["Fruits and vegetables", "Grass and leaves", "Nuts and seeds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsects and spiders.\n\n\tMost chameleons are insectivores, which means they like crickets, grasshoppers and locusts. Some are also known to eat spiders and worms. Some of the largest chameleons will include small birds in their diet. Chameleons adapt their diet to whatever is available in their environment. \n"}, {"text": "How do most chameleons get their water?", "correct": "They lick dew and rain off leaves.", "options": ["They hold their mouths open while it rains.", "Chameleons never drink.", "They drink while they swim in lakes."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey lick dew and rain off leaves.\n\n\tMost chameleons get their water early in the day when they lick the dew off grass and leaves. All chameleons, no matter the species, drink water. How they get it varies greatly with where they are geographically located. If you decide to get a chameleon for a pet, remember that they will prefer running or dripping water to water that is standing still. \n"}, {"text": "There are over 130 different species of chameleons in the world, and half of them live on which large island on the east side of Africa?", "correct": "Madagascar", "options": ["Haiti", "Greenland", "Japan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadagascar.\n\n\tOver half of all species of chameleons are found on the mysterious island of Madagascar.

Chameleons can change color, and the colors to which they change varies from species to species. There is a chameleon, somewhere in the world, that can change color to match almost every color in the rainbow. Chameleons change color to communicate, as well as for camouflage.
