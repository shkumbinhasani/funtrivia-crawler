{"id": "108421", "name": "Ultimate LOTR:  Fellowship, Part 1 Trivia Quiz | Literature | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "J. R. R. Tolkien", "The Fellowship of the Ring"], "questions": [{"text": "The 'Fellowship of the Ring' begins with a party, but not just any party.  It's Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday, and coincidentally the 33rd birthday of his beloved nephew Frodo.  The party for their combined birthday is held at Bilbo's place.  What is his humble abode called?  \n", "correct": "Bag End", "options": ["Baggins' Corner", "Bagshot Row", "Brandy Hall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBag End.\n\n\tBag End is the enviable abode of Mr. Bilbo Baggins until it is passed down to his nephew Frodo following the big birthday bash.  The party, occurring on September the 22nd (Frodo's and Bilbo's birthday), includes nearly all the local population, though only 144 are actually invited to the feast.  Never tell a hobbit about free food! \n"}, {"text": "Lots of gossip occurs in the Shire among the hobbits, and jealousy is no stranger either to the land of the hobbits.  Bilbo Baggins has the misfortune of having a set of close relatives, the Sackville-Bagginses, who are green with envy over his fortune and luck.  As much as they dislike Bilbo, however, this is nothing compared to the detestation they feel toward his heir Frodo.  The jealous couple consists of the husband, Otho, and his wife.  What is her name?  \n", "correct": "Lobelia", "options": ["Asphodel", "Saradas", "Mentha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLobelia.\n\n\tOtho and Lobelia continue to harbor their opprobrium towards Frodo long after Bilbo has left the shire.  They never can get beyond the fact that Frodo has robbed them of what they consider to be their rightful claim to Bag End.  Finally, when Frodo leaves the Shire on his quest, the Sackville-Bagginses are allowed to purchase Bag End at a bargain price...but they are still unhappy! \n"}, {"text": "Between the time when Bilbo leaves the Shire and the beginning of the quest to return the one ring to Mordor a number of years pass (17 to be exact).  During this long period Frodo spends many happy days with friends.  In the 'Fellowship of the Ring', who is (are) listed as his closest friend(s)?  \n", "correct": "Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck", "options": ["Gandalf", "Samwise Gamgee", "Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck.\n\n\tFolco and Fredegar are listed as friends, formerly young admirers of Bilbo.  Certainly Gandalf is a friend as well, but not exactly Frodo's 'best' friend.  An argument could be made for Samwise as well, though he is more of a servant than a friend according to the reading.  But Meriadoc and Peregrin, aka Merry and Pippin, are specifically listed as Frodo's 'closest' friends at the beginning of chapter II (The Shadow of the Past).  They prove themselves as excellent friends too, setting off on the quest to return the ring of power with Frodo later in the book. \n"}, {"text": "Gandalf returns in the second chapter after a long hiatus.  He has been investigating the history of the ring and those who have borne its weight on their fingers.  Through the use of fire Gandalf reveals to Frodo that the ring he carries is in fact the 'one ring' of Sauron, the evil master of Mordor.  On the ring appears the ancient Elvish writing now used in Mordor, with the inscription: 'One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them'.  This line is a portion of a verse that Gandalf also quotes, a poem from Elven-lore.  What is the final line of this poem?  \n", "correct": "In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie", "options": ["One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them", "One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne", "One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\n\n\tThe entire poem reads:  'Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne, In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.  One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.'  It is following this that Frodo realizes the shocking true nature of his possession and that he must soon be rid of it. \n"}, {"text": "Gandalf relates to Frodo the history of the ring so far as he knows it.  The ring was cut from the hand of Sauron following his overthrow at the hands of the Elven-king Gil-galad and the king of men, Elendil.  Elendil's son Isildur was the individual who managed to acquire the ring from Sauron, but he eventually lost it too, having been killed by Orcs.  Into what river did the ring vanish following Isildur's death?  \n", "correct": "Anduin", "options": ["Celduin", "Greyflood", "Isen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnduin.\n\n\tThe ring floated to the bottom of the great river Anduin and settled in the deeper stretches of the river amidst the Gladden Fields. \n"}, {"text": "We also discover in Gandalf's story that the individual who rediscovers the ring, long since fallen into myth and legend, is a friend of a certain Sm\u00e9agol (who we know also as Gollum).  What is Sm\u00e9agol's friend's name?  \n", "correct": "Deagol", "options": ["Bergil", "Gr\u00edma", "G\u00e1lm\u00f3d"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeagol.\n\n\tIn our introduction to Sm\u00e9agol and his friend D\u00e9agol, Gandalf suggests that they may have been hobbits (he calls them 'hobbit-kind').  If Sm\u00e9agol was a hobbit, he was one with an evil heart, for he killed his 'love' D\u00e9agol in order to acquire the ring, which he called his 'birthday present'.  Over the years the ring corrupted Sm\u00e9agol and he became Gollum (a name that reflected the throat noise he made).  It was this very same Gollum from whom Bilbo Baggins acquired the ring through trickery. Most of the information that Gandalf learned regarding Gollum's story was from Gollum himself, whom Gandalf had captured with the help of Aragorn.\n"}, {"text": "Following Gandalf's recounting of the story of the ring it is agreed between himself and Frodo that the ring must leave the Shire, and Frodo announces his willingness to deliver it out of Hobbiton to Rivendell, home of the Elf-lord Elrond.  Inadvertently selected as Frodo's companion is Samwise Gamgee who happens to be eavesdropping at the window.  Though Sam is intimidated by Gandalf, he seems eager to come along with Frodo on his dangerous quest.  What is it that Sam claims he would 'dearly love' to see?  \n", "correct": "Elves", "options": ["Dwarves", "Mountains", "Forests"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElves.\n\n\tSam has such innocent ideas.  He has been mesmerized by tales of elves since his childhood and wishes to see a real elf up close for the first time.  When Gandalf agrees to allow Sam to accompany Frodo Sam shouts, 'Me go and see Elves and all!  Hooray!' and then he breaks down into tears.  On the quest he receives the opportunity to see more elves than he ever dreamed of, and his admiration for the Elven folk only grows as a result. \n"}, {"text": "In order to avoid gossip over his vacating of the Shire, Frodo claims that he is moving to Buckland, and sets off finally with his companion Samwise.  Who else accompanies these two away from the Baggins' abode?  \n", "correct": "Pippin", "options": ["Fatty", "Merry", "Gandalf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPippin.\n\n\tFrodo, Sam and Pippin all make off from Bag End to Buckland where they will meet up with Merry and Fatty Bolger.  To get to Buckland they will have to reach Bucklebury Ferry, but not before passing through Tookland, the Green Hill Country and Woody-End. \n"}, {"text": "On their way to Buckland, Frodo and his companions encounter two ominous black riders.  The second shadowy figure nearly discovers the location of our friends, but is scared away at the last second by a collection of elves, led by Gildor Inglorion, who are passing through the Woody-End of the Shire.  Just prior to their conversation with the three hobbits, Gildor and the elves sing a melodic tune about a queen named...?  \n", "correct": "Elbereth", "options": ["Galadriel", "Galasgal", "Beruthiel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElbereth.\n\n\tElbereth Gilthoniel is the star queen, or 'snow-white' as she is called in the song.  Frodo chants her name several times later in the book during instances of great peril, much as a Catholic might call for the help of the Virgin Mary.  Gildor Inglorion is so impressed with Frodo's knowledge of Elven tongue and lore that he names Frodo 'elf-friend' and provides the hobbits with bed and food for the evening.  Needless to say, Sam is in ecstasy! \n"}, {"text": "Following their encounter with the elves, our friends once again make their way towards the east.  More encounters with the black riders force Frodo and friends to make a short-cut through Farmer Maggot's crops.  Which character (or characters) have reservations about cutting through Maggot's fields because of some controversy over mushroom thievery?  \n", "correct": "Frodo", "options": ["Sam", "None of them", "Pippin and Merry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrodo.\n\n\tFrodo dreads crossing old Maggot's homestead at Bamfurlong because he had stolen some mushrooms several times from Maggot as a youth.  Maggot had actually caught and beaten Frodo, and had threatened to send his dogs after him the next time he was caught.  But Frodo can hardly be blamed for stealing mushrooms, after all...these are a hobbit's favorite treat! \n"}, {"text": "Yes or no:  Farmer Maggot is very helpful to Frodo and friends after he has found them walking through his fields.  \n", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tFarmer Maggot is a shrewd man, and guesses much about Frodo's quest.  He also displays generosity, providing the travelers with food and drink (and extra mushrooms!), and later with a wagon to help them towards Bucklebury Ferry.  Merry joins the crew as they head towards the ferry in this wagon. \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  Merry, Pippin and Sam know nothing of Frodo's intentions about leaving the Shire and going on some sort of quest.  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, the three other hobbits are involved in a 'conspiracy' of sorts.  They had guessed about Frodo's intentions based on his unusual behavior which included selling Bag End and frequent (not so) secret meetings with Gandalf, and Sam was their chief spy.  As mentioned before, hobbits like to gossip, so it is not a big stretch to imagine that these fellows would decipher these unusual behaviors.  Frodo's friends are fun-loving and garrulous, but they are not dunces.  They even know about the Ring! \n"}, {"text": "The first step that Frodo and friends take out of the Shire leads them into the deep and mysterious Old Forest.  Entry into this forest is unnerving for our friends, since they all have heard stories of its dangers and feel trepidation at entering into the unknown.  Sure enough, as they penetrate deeper and deeper into the wood they run into trouble.  The trees seem to move and their path seems to shift.  Finally, they make it to the Withywindle River where they suddenly suffer from extreme sleepiness.  After waking, Frodo and Sam find that Merry and Pippin are missing...they have been swallowed into a large tree!  What sort of tree has 'consumed' their two companions?  \n", "correct": "Willow", "options": ["Maple", "Ash", "Birch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWillow.\n\n\tSam and Frodo fail to extricate their fellow travelers from the willow using fire and hatchet.  Fortunately, the charming Tom Bombadil comes along at this moment and forces the cantankerous Old Man Willow to give up his ill-gotten prize.  (Where was old Tom in the film?  I sure missed his presence!) \n"}, {"text": "After being shepherded to safety by Tom Bombadil in the Old Forest, our diminutive hobbit friends find themselves entertained by Mr. Bombadil and his beloved Goldberry.  They are served a delicious (and nutritious!) meal and promptly sent to bed.  The dreams of each hobbit are described as far as is able, with only one of the hobbits having a content and restful night's sleep.  Which of the hobbits is fortunate to sleep like a log?  \n", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Pippin", "Frodo", "Merry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tWhile Frodo has nightmares about the black riders, Pippin dreams of dangerous and threatening trees and Merry has a fitful dream about drowning.  Meanwhile, Sam manages a lovely night's rest...a quote, 'as far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep content, if logs are contented.'  One of the best lines of the book, in my humble opinion! \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  So far as we can detect from the information in the book, the ring of power has no effect or power over Tom Bombadil.  \n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAt least in the Old Forest, where Tom and Goldberry dwell, the ring of power is simply a meaningless trinket to old Tom.  In fact, he is able to see Frodo even in his invisible state, and even more shockingly, Tom places the ring on his own finger with no effect!  Unfortunately, Tom could be of no help in the Hobbits' quest to deliver the ring to Mordor, at least not outside of the Old Forest.  This concludes part one of this 'ultimate' series of LOTR quizzes, please stay tuned for the sequel(s)! \n"}]}
