Players' army tokens mark the territories they claim; you get more armies for turning in cards or conquering continents. Battles are matters of numbers and chance, pitting the dice of up to two defending armies against the dice of up to three attacking armies until one side is destroyed. What's the name of the game?", "correct": "Risk", "options": ["Stratego", "Diamant", "Empire Builder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRisk.\n\n\tReleased in 1957 by Parker Brothers, \"Risk\" divides six continents into 42 contested territories; as is so often the case, everyone ignores Antarctica. The goal is usually the complete conquest of all 42 territories by a single player, but there are variants: in \"Secret Mission Risk\", for example, each player has a confidential task that's a bit easier -- like conquering Asia and Africa, or defeating one particular opponent entirely. This variant is popular with players who are tired of spending all weekend battling over Kamchatka! \n"}, {"text": "A world map needn't be the stage for competition and conquest: it could also be the scene of intense cooperation. In one game, players form a team to cope with simultaneous outbreaks of four diseases. They race around the globe to treat patients, build research centers, and develop cures before it's too late for humanity. What game is this?", "correct": "Pandemic", "options": ["E.T.I.", "Parcheesi", "Arkham Asylum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPandemic.\n\n\t\"Pandemic\" players start at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, USA, but the gameplay typically takes them to every continent (except, of course, Antarctica). Every turn brings new infections and the chance of a random epidemic; there's one way to win (by discovering cures for all four diseases), but many ways to lose. Teamwork -- and luck -- are key here -- and, of course, a willingness to travel.\r \"Pandemic\", released by Z-Man Games in 2008, was designed by Matt Leacock. \n"}, {"text": "\"Empire Builder\" was the first in a series of train games in which players get to modify the map directly. As you, a railroad baron, make freight runs and upgrade your train -- all en route to connecting major cities and banking a carload of cash -- how do you mark where you've laid your tracks?", "correct": "By drawing on the board in crayon", "options": ["By pasting strips of paper on the board", "By tacking strings on the board", "With notations on a separate sheet of paper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy drawing on the board in crayon.\n\n\tThe \"Empire Builder\" board is a map of the contiguous United States, plus parts of Canada and Mexico; between games, the crayon rubs right off the laminated surface. Each player chooses a distinct color of crayon; if you use someone else's tracks at any point, you have to pay them rent. Each town on the map produces certain commodities, which you earn money for transporting according to randomly drawn contracts. The winner is the first to bank 250 million dollars while building a rail network that connects five of the six major cities.\r First released in 1980 by Mayfair Games, \"Empire Builder\" has spawned numerous spinoffs with new maps, taking players all over the world -- and even, in \"Lunar Rails\", to the Moon! \n"}, {"text": "Here's a war game played on a map of Europe, across borders drawn roughly as they were at the outset of World War I. Players compete for supply centers, which support their land and sea units -- but the real heart of the game is the negotiation phase, in which players talk each other into alliances and pacts. Their actual orders for the next turn, though, are written down in secret -- so they can't be held to their promises. Which of these games thus continues war by other means?", "correct": "Diplomacy", "options": ["Risk", "Stratego", "Battleship"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiplomacy.\n\n\t\"Diplomacy\", originally released on a small scale by its designer, Allan B. Calhamer, in 1959, works well in person but is also often played by mail or e-mail; it's a good fit for a remote game because players are required to write down their moves. When a territory is contested, ownership is decided by numerical superiority, so no dice-rolling is necessary. Instead, victory comes from the numbers, and from clever management of the shifting alliances (and judicious stabs in the back). \n"}, {"text": "Some knowledge of American geography will be helpful to the aspiring railway magnates of this game. Each player lays one or two lengths of track in a turn, joining up with a rival's line when it seems expedient. The winner is the first to connect all five of the cities she randomly drew at the beginning. What game is this?", "correct": "TransAmerica", "options": ["Lunar Rails", "Notre Dame", "Age of Exploration"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTransAmerica.\n\n\tIn \"TransAmerica\", designed by Franz-Benno Delonge and first released by Rio Grande Games in 2001, tracks are interchangeable -- so you can let your rival span the Rockies, and then piggyback on the line. In each turn, you can lay two lengths of track across flat terrain or one length across mountains or bodies of water, always with your goal in mind: connecting your cities, one from each of five large regions, with rail service. At the end of the game, players get points based on how many lengths of track they were missing from their final network; in this case, fewer points are better!\r The sequel, 2005's \"TransEuropa\", operates on very similar principles. \n"}, {"text": "The map doesn't have to stay the same between games. One popular resource game starts with the construction of a six-sided island from hexagonal tiles -- and the random geography thus generated determines where players should place their initial settlements and roads. Every tile (except the desert) is associated with a number, so its resources can be unlocked with a roll of two dice. What's the name of the game?", "correct": "Settlers of Catan", "options": ["Carcassonne", "Candyland", "Civilization"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSettlers of Catan.\n\n\tThere are five basic resource types in \"Settlers of Catan\", a 1995 game designed by Klaus Teuber and first released by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag: bricks, ore, wheat, wood, and wool. When a tile's number is rolled, each settlement on its borders collects one lot of the tile's resource: forest tiles produce wood, for example, and mountain tiles produce ore.These resources may be traded among players or combined in order to build new settlements, roads, and cities, or to claim development cards. Players get points for their settlements, for possessing certain valuable cards, and for some achievements -- like building Catan's longest road.The changing topography of the island keeps things interesting, game after game. \n"}, {"text": "In a typical game of \"Ticket to Ride\", the map is quickly populated by colorful plastic tokens, marking the train routes that the players have claimed. Each player earns points according to cards drawn from a stack; what sort of tasks do the cards assign?", "correct": "Connecting pairs of cities", "options": ["Building track through particular mileposts", "Delivering a particular cargo to a particular city", "Building a particular shape of rail line"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConnecting pairs of cities.\n\n\tEach card specifies a pair of cities and a number of points; in general, more widely separated city pairs are worth more. The connections don't have to be very efficient -- \"Ticket to Ride\" passengers are apparently remarkably patient -- but every completed itinerary awards points at the end of the game, while uncompleted itineraries bring penalties. Players build track by turning in color cars according to the length and color of the route they want, but their rail networks are incompatible with each other: no sharing!\r The first \"Ticket to Ride\", designed by Alan R. Moon and released in 2004 by Days of Thunder, used a U.S. map as a board. Subsequent spinoffs have taken players to various parts of Europe, sometimes adding complexities like ferries and tunnels. \n"}, {"text": "War sometimes breaks out on the world map of \"Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game\", but it isn't the only way to win: instead, a civilization may focus on science, or the arts, or the economy. What type of work inspired this board game?", "correct": "A video game", "options": ["A radio show", "A nonfiction book", "A documentary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA video game.\n\n\t\"Sid Meier's Civilization\" is a popular series of PC games in which players, starting essentially from scratch, found cities and attempt to build long-lasting civilizations. The board game, designed by Kevin Wilson and released in 2010 by Fantasy Flight Games, attempts to duplicate this gameplay with phase-based turns, in which players can found cities, trade, produce infrastructure, move units, and research new technologies. As in the video games, wars between players ebb and flow across the map as centuries go by.\r A previous attempt, 2002's \"Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame\" (note the absence of a space in the last word) was not quite as successful an implementation. 1980's \"Civilization\", despite a broadly similar concept, is an unrelated effort. \n"}, {"text": "It's somewhat unusual for the map to change DURING the game, but it can be made to work. In one example, the players are a team of archaeologists, struggling to salvage artifacts from a booby-trapped island. As time passes, parts of the island flood -- and then sink forever beneath the sea. What's the name of the game?", "correct": "Forbidden Island", "options": ["Diamant", "Mousetrap", "Pilgrimage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForbidden Island.\n\n\tDesigned by Matt Leacock and released in 2010 by GameWright, this cooperative game is similar in many ways to \"Pandemic\" -- but here the map is a more malevolent presence. Shaped like a plus sign, it's assembled anew each game from randomly ordered square tiles, each representing a place: the Copper Gate, for instance, or the Misty Marsh.Players divide their time between travel, trading clues, exchanging their clues for treasures, and shoring up flooded tiles -- because once a tile sinks, that part of the map is gone forever. Many a time my team has won by the skin of our teeth, hopping onto the rescue copter just as the helipad slipped away forever. \n"}, {"text": "One classic war game includes economics in the mix: a player's territories generate Industrial Production Certificates, which can be traded in for new units or for upgrades. \"Axis & Allies\" takes its name from the cataclysmic war that inspired it; which war was that?", "correct": "World War II", "options": ["The Forever War", "World War I", "The Crimean War"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld War II.\n\n\tDesigned by Larry Harris and first released in 1981 by Nova Game Designs, \"Axis & Allies\" opens with a situation reminiscent of early 1942. The playable Allies -- the UK, the USSR, the USA, and (in some versions) China or the ANZAC countries -- have greater industrial capacity, but the playable Axis countries -- Germany, Japan, and (in some versions) Italy -- have a stronger tactical position on the world map.As in \"Risk\", combat is settled by dice rolls, which are compared to the combatants' attack or defense ratings. Unlike \"Risk\", however, alliances are entrenched -- nobody switches sides -- and there are numerous different types of military units, each with distinct abilities and ratings. \n"}]}
