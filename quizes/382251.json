The song became a huge charting hit for McFerrin and won him Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 1989. The song became deeply ingrained in popular culture and has featured in numerous films. George H. W. Bush even used the song for his presidential campaign without McFerrin's consent, causing McFerrin (a Democrat supporter) to momentarily retire the song from his setlists in protest. After the success of \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\", Bobby McFerrin began exploring other career possibilities, including composing for film studios like Pixar and collaborating with orchestras.\r The incorrect options are, in fact, Bob Marley songs.\r Don't mix it up-- Daaanieeel wrote this question and Babsr sent it in. \n"}, {"text": "Canadian singer and songwriter Justin Bieber rose to fame in 2009 with the hit song \"Baby\".

Co-written by Bieber, Ed Sheeran, and producer Benny Blanco, the song tells the story of a relationship that has ended, and how the singer is ready to let go of the other person after being hurt. \"Love Yourself\" contains quite hard-hitting lyrics! (such as \"now I know I'm better sleeping on my own\"). The song was well-received overall, reaching the top position in multiple charts including US Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Top 40 lists. \"Love Yourself\" was also nominated for Song of the Year at the 59th edition of the Grammy Awards, but lost to Adele's \"Hello\".\r Much thanks to Lpez for covering this question based on Jmorrow's request. \n"}, {"text": "A 1982 song about Europeans coming to America and fighting the Native Americans has become one of Iron Maiden's most popular songs.

Myers composition in February of 1994 and enjoyed solid success with it. It topped Billboards' Hot Country Songs for four weeks and made the crossover to mainstream, peaking at number forty two on Billboards' Hot 100. He may well have been jealous of All-4-One's take on the track several month's later. With just a slight tweak of the lyrics the song launched the American R&B band to instant stardom. It topped the charts in a number of countries and was only kept from top spot in the UK Singles' charts by the enormously popular \"Love is All Around\" by Wet Wet Wet. The song would earn the band a Grammy Award in 1995 for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\r Kudos to Pollucci19 for tackling this song put forth by Triviaballer. \n"}, {"text": "Which song was introduced by Doris Day in the Alfred Hitchcock film \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" and would become her signature song?", "correct": "Que Sera Sera", "options": ["Day By Day", "Secret Love", "Sentimental Journey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQue Sera Sera.\n\n\tDay also starred in this 1956 alongside James Stewart and, whilst the moment to introduce the song in the movie comes off a little forced, the rendition by Day is perfect. It completed a package that so impressed the Academy that it provided the writers, Jay Livingston and Ray Evans, their third Oscar for Best Original Song. It would also peak at number two on Billboard's Hot 100 charts and be used on television as the theme to \"The Doris Day Show\" between 1968 and 1973.\r This question?  It's from Pollucci19.

The song tells the story of a life gone wrong in New Orleans, where the titular house is located; in the original version, the narrator is a woman, and the house presumably a brothel, while in The Animals' version the point of view switches to that of a man who gambles his life away and ends up in prison. Bob Dylan also included the song in his 1962 debut album. \r \"The House Jack Built\" is a song about drug abuse by American heavy metal band Metallica; \"Hyacinth House\" was recorded by The Doors, and \"Houses of the Holy\" is the title of both a song and an album by Led Zeppelin.\r LadyNym is the one bringing us into this house upon invitation from Namrewsna. \n"}, {"text": "The Pistol Annies helped out Blake Shelton with which 2013 hit that declared (who is) \"drinking that ice-cold beer\"?", "correct": "Boys 'Round Here", "options": ["Playboys of the South Western World", "Ol' Red", "Nobody But Me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoys 'Round Here.\n\n\tThis was the second single from Shelton's seventh studio album, \"Based on a True Story...\" and met with both mixed reviews and moderate success.

Danish singer M\u00d8 would also provide vocals on the track. Diplo, of Major Lazer, said that the creative process in the song took some time. They had a very strong hook and sensed a hit but struggled to get the \"attitude\" of the song right until they brought DJ Snake on board with the project. The effort was worthwhile as indicated by critic, Brennan Carley of US music magazine \"Spin\", when he wrote \"It's as if No Doubt met the C+C Music Factory\". This is the tip of the acclaim that the song would receive. It was also loved by their fans as the song garnered great commercial success, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.\r This question was given by Pollucci19 based on a request from Mask100. \n"}]}
