{"id": "406695", "name": "Spelling It Out - \"Resident Evil 4\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 4"], "questions": [{"text": "What type of fish can Leon catch and eat to regain health?", "correct": "Bass", "options": ["Catfish", "Trout", "Pike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBass.\n\n\tThough most of the healing in this game (and others in the series) is done with Herbs of different colours, Leon may also be lucky enough to live off the land-- at least the parts of it which haven't been destroyed by Las Plagas.  In addition to being able to eat different eggs found within the village and surrounding areas, Leon can kill and catch fish.  The only ones he can get are Black Bass (small ones and large ones) but they can be eaten or sold nonetheless. \n"}, {"text": "The Blue Stone of Treason can be combined with a statuette of which animal?", "correct": "Lynx", "options": ["Serpent", "Chicken", "Lion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLynx.\n\n\tThough the Golden Lynx statue, found in Chapter 5-1, is worth 15,000 ptas when you find it (which is a healthy amount of money), you can combine it with the Blue Stone of Treason, the Red Stone of Faith, and the Green Stone of Judgement should you find them to raise the item's value to 35,000 ptas.  This is one of the last of these types of combined treasure items in the game.  All components are found across Chapter 5 (from part 1 to part 3). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these enemies was created through experiments to place Las Plagas into a non-organic host?", "correct": "Armadura", "options": ["Garrador", "Verdugo", "El Gigante"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArmadura.\n\n\tThese enemies seem to be no more than idle or, occasionally, shambling suits of armor but, really, they're Las Plagas placed into a hard shell.  Some of these will be a one-and-done type of deal, preparing for a single hit and perishing, but some will take to their new homes better than others and attack Leon with a bit more gusto, emerging only in emergencies.  Once Leon takes aim at the actual Plaga inside, they'll be dealt with. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these creatures was, at one point, a dog or wolf?", "correct": "Colmillos", "options": ["Del Lago", "Novistador", "Ganado"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColmillos.\n\n\tOne of many creatures experimented on by the people of the village (and Umbrella, by extension), Colmillos are dogs controlled by Las Plagas.  Other games in the \"Resident Evil\" series have also featured Zombie Dogs.  In this case, Colmillos go the extra mile; they can be killed easily with a Shotgun or other high-powered weapon, but some will only be vulnerable when hit in the parasite lodged in their back. \n"}, {"text": "The Castle Gate, the Prison, and the Mine all need which of these to be accessed?", "correct": "Keys", "options": ["Card keys", "Insignias", "Tablets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeys.\n\n\tIt would hardly be a \"Resident Evil\" location if there weren't a series of ornate keys needed to access important rooms and paths, and visiting Castle Salazar in Chapter 3, you should prepare yourself for a relatively linear dungeon provided you have everything in order.  All of the keys here are one-time-use and go into the Keys and Treasure tab of your inventory screen, so there should be no hassle, like in previous games in the series, making sure they're on-hand when you need them. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these would be used by Leon's machine pistol?", "correct": "TMP Ammo", "options": ["Handgun Ammo", "Handcannon Ammo", "Magnum Ammo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTMP Ammo.\n\n\tThere are nearly ten different ammunition types in this game, some of which don't even go into Leon's inventory, and one of the few weapons to use TMP Ammo is, go figure, the TMP or the Tactical Machine Pistol.  Unlike the regular handguns, magnums, and handcannons (all of which have their own types of ammo, naturally), the TMP can fire in faster bursts.  Generally, Leon will upgrade away from the TMP, and it makes economical sense to do so if only avoid needing to carry a case of Jackals. \n"}, {"text": "Which character is playable in the 'Separate Ways' side-challenge?", "correct": "Ada Wong", "options": ["Ingrid Hunnigan", "Ashley Graham", "Albert Wesker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAda Wong.\n\n\tMore of a mini-game than anything, in 'Separate Ways', the player takes the role of Ada Wong through five chapters that run parallel to Leon's journey through the main game.  Considered part of the \"Resident Evil\" game canon, the mini-game is the second instance in the series where the player can take Ada into their own control as she is featured, briefly, in \"Resident Evil 2\" (when Leon is knocked out in the sewers).  Beating 'Separate Ways' unlocks a handful of items for use in a replay of the main game (including the popular Chicago Typewriter weapon). \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is a type of Grenade Leon can use in the game?", "correct": "Incendiary", "options": ["Flame", "Spiked", "Smoke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIncendiary.\n\n\tIn addition to firing Mines and Rockets from weapons, Leon is also able to use three different types of Grenade throughout the game as early as the first Chapters.  In addition to the regular Hand Grenade, Incendiary Grenades pack a fiery punch and Flash Grenades provide unique advantages, especially against foes that are more susceptible to light.  The Hand Grenade is green; the Incendiary Grenade is red; the Flash Grenade is blue. \n"}, {"text": "Which character is killed at the end of Chapter 3-3?", "correct": "Luis Sera", "options": ["Bitores Mendez", "Ramon Salazar", "Jack Krauser"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuis Sera.\n\n\tA Madrid cop originally working for Saddler but determined to be a turncoat, Luis Sera meets Leon early in the game and manages to keep either one step ahead or behind for much of the first three chapters before being killed by Saddler himself when he finally gets his hands on the Las Plagas sample.  Before succumbing to his wounds, he'll give Leon a jar of pills to keep the parasite inside himself and Ashley at bay long enough to get through the events of the game. \n"}, {"text": "If you take the first letter of the previous nine answers, you'll be able to spell a type of handgun.  What's the item's name?\n", "correct": "BLACKTAIL", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBLACKTAIL.\n\n\tOne of five firearms to use Handgun Ammo, the Blacktail is one of the more powerful pistols once fully-upgraded but suffers a bit from ammo use/firepower (compared to the Red9), though its handling is better than the other guns of its type.  Leon can purchase the Blacktail from the Merchant starting in Chapter 3 at an initial cost of 24,000 ptas. \n"}]}
