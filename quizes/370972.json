There, the Doctor finds the Face of Boe near death, but Rose is sidetracked and attacked by Lady Cassandra who, in a shocking plot twist, takes over the companion's mind to secure a new body and set free the diseased humans in the basement of the hospital building.

Rose ends up captured and placed under duress with the other women in the building while The Doctor spends time with Queen Victoria.  Ultimately they're able to save the day by killing the werewolf with a special device used to magnify moonlight through the Koh-i-Noor Diamond.

As it turns out, the world is also being put to war at the same time when a man named John Lumic sets loose his Cybermen, robotic figures with human brains and tissues with their emotions inhibited. To escape London, they all need to escape and defeat the Cybermen.

When the TARDIS sinks into the planet after an earthquake, they hang around just in time to find that a creature, known simply as 'The Beast', is rising from the hole being drilled to the core.

As it turns out, the 'ghosts' are Cybermen being pulled through a portal between two worlds-- Rose's Earth and the second Earth from \"Rise of the Cybermen\".  When the window finally breaks and lets them all in, it happens at the same time that Rose (and a hidden Mickey) discover the contents of a mysterious sphere of non-energy-- the Cult of Skaro, four Daleks seeking to open the Genesis Ark, actually a prison for countless Dalek forces.  What results is a war between Cybermen and Daleks with humankind in the middle.  The Earth is only saved when The Doctor and Rose open the portal into the void, sending all of their enemies through into the nothingness to rid them from both universes.  Unfortunately, as Rose is nearly pulled into the void, Pete saves her at the last moment, grabbing her and teleporting her into the alternate world, but trapping her there with Jackie and Mickey, unable to reach The Doctor again.
