The group is split into two roughly parallel chains of islands running essentially north-south. The Ratak Chain (meaning sunrise) lies to the east and the Ralik Chain (meaning sunset) to the west. More than 65% of the country's estimated 68,000 inhabitants live either on the island of Majuro in the Ratak Chain, or on Ebeye in the Ralik Chain. \n"}, {"text": "Which U.S. Territory lies immediately north of the Marshall Islands?", "correct": "Wake Island", "options": ["Guam", "Midway Island", "Bikini Atoll"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWake Island.\n\n\tWake Island, an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the U.S. to which the Marshall Islands lays claim, lies immediately north of the Marshall Islands.
