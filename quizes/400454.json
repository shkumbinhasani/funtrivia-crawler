Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Robin Duke, and Mary Gross were also a part of the skit which was about the horrors within the hair styling world. \n"}, {"text": "Eddie Murphy's character, Dr. Phillip Holder, uttered the phrase, \"Help, ______!\" at the end of his interview on 'Firing Line'. To whom was he calling out?", "correct": "Tito", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTito.\n\n\tDr. Phillip Holder was the guest on \"Firing Line\", hosted by William F. Buckley (Robin Williams). They were discussing the recent rash of African American singers who had burst into flames while performing due to there either being too many people on stage or the lights being too hot. At the end of the segment, Dr. Holder's hair begins to smoke and catch on fire whereby he cries out, \"Help, Tito!\", to no one in particular. The skit was a dig at Michael Jackson's recent accident whereby his hair had also caught on fire during the making a Pepsi commercial a few months earlier. \n"}, {"text": "'Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood' premiered on \"Saturday Night Live\" on February 21, 1981, but unfortunately, he wasn't comfortable with the audience visiting with him for too long.

Mr. Robinson (Eddie Murphy) was a bit uncomfortable with the audience visiting with him, however, as he was fearful of his wife coming home from work and finding everyone there. According to Mr. Robinson, his wife was...not very nice (although Robinson used much stronger language). \n"}, {"text": "Eddie Murphy could count singing as one of his many talents and he utilized that skill with many of his impersonations during his tenure on \"Saturday Night Live\". Which of his following characters NEVER attempted to sing a note?", "correct": "Bill Cosby", "options": ["Rev. Jesse Jackson", "Buckwheat", "Little Richard Simmons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBill Cosby.\n\n\tWhether he was trying to help a friend (Robert Culp) get back on his feet by giving him some of the products he hawked in commercials or telling kids that lite beer was healthy for them, Murphy's Bill Cosby never attempted to sing a note. \n"}, {"text": "In this particular skit where he portrayed Michael Jackson, Eddie made a PSA (Public Service Announcement) targeted at males. What is the missing word in following statement: \"Nice boys don't get girls ______.\" ", "correct": "pregnant", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\npregnant.\n\n\tOn January 14, 1984, Eddie Murphy (as Michael Jackson) made this PSA in which he said, \"Nice boys don't get girls pregnant\".

Apparently, the Tooth Fairy received only 12 cents for every tooth he brought to God; it cost him ten cents just to collect the teeth and make the deliveries. The extra two cents wasn't worth the hassle. \n"}, {"text": "Which sports figure did Eddie Murphy portray on the December 12, 1981, episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" during the 'Weekend Update' segment?", "correct": "Muhammed Ali", "options": ["World B. Free", "Archie Griffin", "Reggie Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMuhammed Ali.\n\n\tOn December 12, 1981, Eddie Murphy appeared as Muhammed Ali during the sports portion of the 'Weekend Update' segment of \"Saturday Night Live\". In the skit, Joe Piscopo shows us a clip of himself as a young sports reporter interviewing a young Cassius Clay (who would later change his name to Muhammed Ali) as he's preparing to fight Sonny Liston. Murphy does a credible impersonation of the young Ali and the spot is pretty funny....until they revert back to real time when the skit becomes cringe-worthy. \r Murphy portrays an Ali who had just lost to Trevor Berbick and is now showing signs of CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy) due to the repeated hits to his head during his long boxing career. While the skit was funny for that time period (we had no idea about what CTE was during the early 1980's), looking at it now leaves one feeling uncomfortable; a bittersweet sketch indeed. \n"}, {"text": "Pudge or Solomon.

Along with Joe Piscopo, who played the other half of the duo, Pudge, these sketches were much more touching and heartwarming than they were funny. It was just two old friends reminiscing about life in general as they sat in a bar.Pudge (Piscopo) played the piano while Solomon (Murphy) sat on a stool next to him asking if \"you hear what I say?\" whenever he made a joke or said something profound. The final skit on December 10, 1983, was truly touching as Pudge gives Solomon a new pair of shoes for Christmas after years of Solomon's complaining about his bad feet. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following singers did Eddie Murphy impersonate first on \"Saturday Night Live\"?", "correct": "Stevie Wonder", "options": ["Sammy Davis, Jr", "James Brown", "Michael Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStevie Wonder.\n\n\tEddie did a brief Stevie Wonder impression on the January 10, 1981 episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" during 'Weekend Update' (hosted by Gail Matthias). Murphy was doing a commentary on the proposed idea of the Draft being re-instituted in the segment and to was trying to justify his not being picked for military service as it would rob \"SNL\" of its only African-American member. \r It was in this sketch that Murphy did his first impressions. Stevie Wonder was the first imitation he did (although he didn't sing or speak in the segment), as well as an imitation of Bill Cosby. \n"}, {"text": "In the sketch where Eddie Murphy goes undercover as a Caucasian man, one of the places he visits is a bank to get a loan. Although he has no collateral, I.D., or credit, he is told that he can borrow as much as he wants without having to pay it back.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOn December 15, 1984, Eddie Murphy goes undercover as a Caucasian man in order to highlight the societal inequalities between the African-American and Caucasian races. He goes to buy a paper from a local newsstand only to be encouraged by the cashier to take it and leave since no one is around, which leaves Eddie to think that, \"Caucasians give each other things when no one is else is looking\". \r He takes a bus ride and sees it turn into a traveling cocktail lounge once the sole African-American gets off at his stop and then goes into a bank to get a loan without having any collateral, I.D., or credit to offer. Initially, he was turned down for the loan by an African-American bank manager, but when his Caucasian supervisor enters the room and overhears the conversation, he tells the manager to take a break and that he will finish assisting Mr. White (Eddie). The supervisor tells Eddie that there was no need for any of the usual formalities and to take as much money as he needed; paying back the loan was optional. It was one of the most memorable \"Saturday Night Live\" skits ever. \n"}]}
