{"id": "362133", "name": "\"Plants vs. Zombies\" Mixture Trivia Game | Plants vs Zombies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games L-P", "Plants vs Zombies"], "questions": [{"text": "The first ten levels of the game are played in which humble location?", "correct": "Your front yard", "options": ["Your kitchen", "The park across the street from your house", "The graveyard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYour front yard.\n\n\tPretty much the entire game is situated around your humble abode as zombies tear through the front yard, the backyard, and subsequently the roof in their sometimes not-so-feeble attempts to get into your house to eat your brains...and they will if you don't use an arsenal of typically-cheery flowers to protect you every step of the way.  The first twenty levels of the game, stages one and two, are held in the front yard and will not feature any zombies that don't spend their time shambling along the ground in some way.  It can't always be this easy though. \n"}, {"text": "Your neighbour, Crazy Dave, wears which of the following on his head?", "correct": "Metal pot", "options": ["Frightened cat", "Floral hat", "Shower cap"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMetal pot.\n\n\tCrazy Dave may not seem all that crazy, but rest assured, he is.  Aside from shouting random, laconic phrases he'll also escort you to his car on several different occasions, usually to sell you what can only be described as black market seed packets and lawn implements.  His shop, Twiddydinkies, can be accessed anytime after midway through Stage Three, as soon as you find the car keys that he had stolen from him (by a zombie, of course).  He also seems to enjoy tacos. Dave will also introduce the player to several minigames throughout the Adventure Mode but, alas, not all can be fun and games with Dave. Near the end of the game he'll be scooped up by a Bungee Zombie.  This is a shame, since he's the only neighbour brave enough (crazy enough?) to visit during the emergency. \n"}, {"text": "The second stage of the game is the first to involve nightfall.  As such, Sunshrooms are the first mushrooms found in your collection.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tSunshrooms are the second shroom to be added; the first is the short-range Puff-Shroom, which is necessary for warding off Zombies advancing in the night.  The Puff-Shroom has a cost of 0 Sun, making it a key player in these early stages, especially against lesser Zombies.  When the Sunshroom is added to the roster in the second level of Stage Two, the player can finally collect sun to build his armies, even when the sun has set.  Shrooms can not be used during the day unless you use a Coffee Bean to wake them up, but this can't be found until Stage Five. \n"}, {"text": "During the first night, graves will appear on the battlefield.  When will Zombies emerge from them?", "correct": "Only during their final wave", "options": ["They don't; they only act as barriers", "Constantly", "Only at the start of the level"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnly during their final wave.\n\n\tWhile one may find it odd that tombstones and grave markers have spontaneously risen from the ground in your own lawn, there's no time to consider logistics.  These new challenges only appear in throughout all of Stage Two and, when the final Zombie wave emerges, so will any buried zombies around the yard.  Since the only thing signifying a potential uprising is the grave itself, you can always use Grave Busters, which eat the tombstones, to remove the threat.  They can be bought for 75 Sun. \n"}, {"text": "The only water you'll find Zombies swimming in is which of these battleground hazards?", "correct": "Pool", "options": ["Lake", "River", "Creek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPool.\n\n\tThe Third and Fourth Stages of the game take you to your backyard which includes several lanes of well-groomed lawn separated by two lanes of stretched pool from end to end, right through the middle.  The Zombies, ever the resourceful undead bunch, have ways to make this a non-issue in the form of inner tubes, snorkel gear, and (yes) Zombie Dolphins.  To combat this hitch, you can create Lily Pads on which you can plant typical flowers or use water-based plants like Tangle Kelp or Sea-Shrooms.  Water-based enemies do not appear after Stage Four, mainly because your roof does not have a pool. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these plants can bring down a Balloon Zombie?", "correct": "Cactus", "options": ["Gatling Pea", "Potato Mine", "Spikeweed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCactus.\n\n\tThe Cactus, introduced in Stage Four, can raise or lower itself at will to bring down any flying zombies in its lane.  On the same note, you can plant Blovers to whisk them back the way they came, removing them from the battle entirely (and any fog in the yard temporarily).  Balloon Zombies are particularly tricky because leaving them to their own devices will ultimately cost you your brains.  They can easily glide over the entire map if you don't bring them down.  Easy as that.  All of the other options are strictly ground-related plants. \n"}, {"text": "To add to the drama of Stage Four, which of these hazardous weather effects will roll in?", "correct": "Fog", "options": ["Cold weather front", "Rainstorm", "Heat wave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFog.\n\n\tAs if things couldn't get worse, fog begins rolling in midway through Stage Four, making it nearly impossible to see Zombies as they step onto your lawn; fog can actually stretch as far up as halfway down the backyard.  Luckily, certain plants will ward off the fog (including the Blover, Torchwood, and the Plantern), making the battle a bit easier to contend with.  This can always be circumvented with strong defenses, however.  Crazy Dave is quoted as saying that he once used to be known as the \"Fog Man\" because he would jump out of the fog and frighten neighbours.  That kook. \n"}, {"text": "If the Zombies are able to break past your defenses on the roof in Stage Five, how will they get into your house?", "correct": "By descending into the chimney", "options": ["By hopping onto a balcony", "By breaking through the shingles", "By crashing through a bay window"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy descending into the chimney.\n\n\tAfter the sieges on the front and back yards, the Zombies will penetrate your defenses and move onto the roof, a location that requires Flowerpots for every plant you use since there is no grass or dirt in which to plant your humble weapons.  If the Zombies make it through they'll still get into the house, mainly by pulling a Santa Claus and hopping into the chimney.  Only a good defense will prevent this from happening; since the roof is sloped you'll have to make use of catapulted vegetables to tackle some of the biggest undead foes of the game. \n"}, {"text": "What casual side-activity involving a watering can, fertilizer, and a phonograph can you embark upon after unlocking it in Stage Five?", "correct": "Zen Garden", "options": ["Vasebreaker", "Last Stand", "Tree of Wisdom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZen Garden.\n\n\tThe Zen Garden (and to the same extent, the Mushroom Garden, and Aquarium Garden) is the most casual part of \"Plants Vs. Zombies\", giving you the chance to break free of the zombie onslaught by embarking on a little bit of recreational green-thumbery.  You can purchase flowers for the gardens and find them throughout the adventure and mini-games and then tend to them to make them flourish.  To do so you will also need to purchase a Watering Can, Fertilizer, a Phonograph, and Bug Spray.  Growing your plants will also earn you money...obviously to buy more plants.  The vicious cycle never ends. \n"}, {"text": "When you defeat Dr. Zomboss at the end of the game, what music video plays as a reward?", "correct": "Zombies on Your Lawn", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nZombies on Your Lawn.\n\n\t\"Zombies on Your Lawn\", performed by a single Sunflower and backed up by several supporting zombies and plants from throughout the game (yes, including a Zombie Dolphin), will play just before the credits roll at the end of the Adventure.  The song was composed by songwriter Laura Shigihara.  Unsurprisingly it appears on a \"Plants vs. Zombies Original Soundtrack\" which is available online and also contains the instrumental tracks found in each stage of the game. \n"}]}
