{"id": "367105", "name": "There's a First for Everything Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "TV Mixture", "Name The Show"], "questions": [{"text": "A plane crashes on an unknown island and the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 need to find a way to survive amongst themselves.  Oh yeah, and there's a smoke monster in the jungle!  What ABC TV show (which ran for six years) debuted with this pilot episode in 2004?", "correct": "LOST", "options": ["Gilligan's Island", "Once Upon a Time", "Hawaii Five-O"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLOST.\n\n\t\"LOST\", considered by many critics to be one of the greatest shows written at the start of the 21st century, was a tour de force with a large ensemble cast, even in the first episode.  The pilot, which set ABC back over ten million dollars, was the most expensive ever filmed, especially odd since it was originally envisioned as a miniseries...starring Michael Keaton...who was supposed to die. Writer, director, and producer J. J. Abrams became a household name and moved into other ventures soon after \"LOST's\" unprecedented success.  The first episode, in which Oceanic crashes, the survivors make camp on the beach, and the smoke monster pulls the pilot from the crashed plane, took in eighteen million viewers on its first airing. \n"}, {"text": "The first episode of this 2003 comedy involving multiple in-jokes and story arcs involved \"a wealthy family who lost everything and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.\"  What was it?", "correct": "Arrested Development", "options": ["Malcolm in the Middle", "Home Improvement", "Everybody Loves Raymond"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArrested Development.\n\n\t\"Arrested Development\" started strong on the FOX network in 2003 with an episode about real estate developer George Bluth Sr.'s arrest, the subsequent results, and son Michael Bluth's decision to take over the company (and, in effect, the family) to keep them all afloat.  While the first episode took on eight million viewers and was adored by critics and a cult fanbase, the show slid in ratings due to complicated inside gags and storylines only understood through consistent viewing (though many considered this a huge plus).  It was canceled in its third season, but found a revival of sorts in 2013 when a new season aired on Netflix, nearly a decade later. \n"}, {"text": "The family patriarch goes to, of all places, a dog race track on Christmas and ends up becoming the hero (with a little helper, of course), in the pilot episode of what long-running FOX animated sitcom which debuted in 1989?", "correct": "The Simpsons", "options": ["Family Guy", "Archer", "The Flintstones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Simpsons.\n\n\t\"The Simpsons\" started its long-running series with a Christmas episode in 1989 entitled \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\".  Envisioned as a full-length Christmas special springing from the characters' popularity in shorts on \"The Tracy Ullman Show\", it ended up being the launch pad for a weekly animated sitcom, gaining in popularity to become the cornerstone of FOX's weekly line-up.  It has since inspired countless other shows while poking fun at topics from pop culture to everyday life. It's also broken records; it became the longest-running primetime television show ever made and, since its first airing, has aired over five hundred episodes in more than twenty-five years. \n"}, {"text": "Rick awakens in a hospital in Georgia to find that he is alone.  He walks out into the corridor and finds a message waiting on the door: \"DON'T OPEN.  DEAD INSIDE.\"  What show, launching its highly-acclaimed pilot \"Days Gone Bye\" in 2010, does this describe?", "correct": "The Walking Dead", "options": ["Hell on Wheels", "Supernatural", "Grimm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Walking Dead.\n\n\t\"The Walking Dead\", premiering on AMC in 2010, brought the high-caliber combination of AMC's high-profile programming (like \"Mad Men\"), Frank Darabont's cinematic eye, and Robert Kirkman's popular graphic novel series, together in a tour de force.  What resulted was a re-imagining of the original source material, legitimizing horror as a television genre and leading a wave of zombie media. \"The Walking Dead\" has since attained some of cable TV's highest ratings and reshaped viewing expectations.  The pilot episode, \"Days Gone Bye\", is a frighteningly faithful adaptation of the graphic novel series' first volume (of the same name).  It starred Andrew Lincoln, and very few otherwise. \n"}, {"text": "Five New York pals situate themselves around a table over coffee at the local cafe as a woman in a wedding dress rushes in.  Soon, the group rounds out at six in what ten-year-long NBC comedy premiering in 1994?", "correct": "Friends", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFriends.\n\n\t\"Friends\" found international fame over the years becoming one of the most famous sitcoms on television.  Starring Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer as six friends going about their lives in the Big Apple, the show often got into zany situations in its early seasons (remember Marcel the Monkey) but straightened out a bit more over the years. By the end of its ten season run, most of the cast members were earning nearly $1,000,000 per episode.  In its final year, each episode cost $10,000,000 to make.  The pilot episode was watched by over twenty-one million viewers on first airing; the finale was watched by over fifty million. \n"}, {"text": "It's difficult to be a blood-spatter analyst when the corpses left at Miami crime scenes don't have a drop of blood in them.  Of course, that's what happened in the pilot episode of this 2006 Showtime series.  What was its title, also the name of the main character?", "correct": "Dexter", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDexter.\n\n\tBased on Jeff Lindsay's best-selling book series about Dexter Morgan, a serial killer who kills serial killers, \"Dexter\" debuted in 2006 and, over the run of its eight years on the air, found both critical acclaim and fan backlash.  The pilot episode marked the start of the Ice Truck Killer arc; every subsequent season featured a new murderer, each with their own MO.  By and large, each season had a self-contained story, at least until the later ones, at which point viewers were simply getting frustrated with every choice the writers made.  Can't please 'em all. \n"}, {"text": "Life in a sleepy, Colorado, redneck town goes on as normal...save for the alien abduction and subsequent anal probe.  In what crude, animated satire premiering in 1997 did this happen in the very first episode?", "correct": "South Park", "options": ["Rick and Morty", "The Big Bang Theory", "Community"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSouth Park.\n\n\tCreated by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, \"South Park\" originally turned heads for being extremely crude in its animation and even more so in its language and subject matter.  Featuring four young boys in the third grade, the show touched on issues involving anal probes, sex, violence, Heaven and Hell, and, since then, everything in between. The show became a quick hit, inevitably becoming one of the longest-running animated shows on TV and poking cruel fun at every possible target.  Its full-length feature, \"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\", was on the record lists for amount of swears during its run-time. But few can forget the satellite dish sticking out of Cartman's behind in the first episode. \n"}, {"text": "Foreshadowing of a nuclear explosion in New York City and a cheerleader saving a man from a burning building were major moments in what 2006 drama's \"Genesis\" episode?", "correct": "Heroes", "options": ["CSI", "24", "Fringe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeroes.\n\n\t\"Heroes\", featuring a gigantic ensemble cast of people with unique superpowers, debuted on NBC in 2006 as an extremely popular action-drama, but mostly due to the Writer's Strike of 2007, the show's quality dropped off and it was canceled after four years.  Nonetheless, the show's five volumes (in four years) were a grand launching point for the careers of Ali Larter, Milo Ventimiglia, Hayden Panettiere, and Zachary Quinto.  Due to a cult following, NBC toyed with the idea of a reboot less than a decade later.  Producer/Creator Tim Kring later created the Kiefer Sutherland show \"Touch\". \n"}, {"text": "King Baratheon arrived in Winterfell to speak with Lord Stark as winter neared in what famous fantasy adaptation first airing on HBO in 2011?", "correct": "Game of Thrones", "options": ["The Tudors", "Merlin", "Rome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGame of Thrones.\n\n\tBased on the series of best-selling medieval fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, \"Game of Thrones\" was picked up by HBO and began airing in 2011.  Following the books relatively faithfully, the show has attained a very faithful fanbase and has received critical acclaim.  The first episode saw the start of the conflict between the Baratheons/Lannisters and the Starks and, across the Narrow Sea, the commencement of the plans to wed Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo. \n"}, {"text": "The Harmon family moved into a beautiful Los Angeles mansion in the pilot episode of this show, but it wasn't long before the ghosts of the house, including a man in a latex gimp suit, appeared to wreak havoc in what Ryan Murphy drama first appearing in 2011?", "correct": "American Horror Story", "options": ["Glee", "Nip/Tuck", "The Following"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican Horror Story.\n\n\t\"American Horror Story\", unlike most shows of the time, presented itself as an anthology series shortly after the first season with each subsequent 'story' featuring the same actors in different roles.  This wasn't known until the end of the show's 'Murder House' season which started with The Harmon Family moving into a haunted Los Angeles mansion (next door to Jessica Lange).  It would take several episodes before they discovered the full extent of the haunting.  The show was created by the same team that brought \"Nip/Tuck\" and \"Glee\" to the airwaves. \n"}]}
