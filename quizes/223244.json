{"id": "223244", "name": "\"King Kong\" (2005) : Part II Quiz | King Kong | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "   Movies H-K", "King Kong"], "questions": [{"text": "Carl Denham and his crew happen upon mysterious ruins on Skull Island.  Oddly enough, they also discover that there is no human presence whatsoever on the entire island.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tHeck, you knew this one!  The island, at least behind the very large walls of the ruins, is populated by some rather frightening-looking natives.  They offer up Ann Darrow in a sacrificial ritual to Kong. \n"}, {"text": "Not long after their arrival on the island, Ann Darrow is nabbed by King Kong, a giant gorilla-like creature who appears to be a native inhabitant.  Do any of the film's or ship's crew get a look at the beast?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tCarl Denham gets an eyeful of Kong.  Feigning concern for Ann, Carl insists that a rescue attempt be made, but what he is really concerned about is getting some film footage of the giant simian.\r Interestingly, the viewer doesn't get to view Kong until over an hour into the film! \n"}, {"text": "After pushing through the jungle for quite some time, Ann in hand, Kong settles down on a rock precipice.  Here, Ann attempts to impress Kong with several tricks from her vaudeville act.  Which of these does she not perform for Kong?", "correct": "Push-ups", "options": ["Backflips", "Juggling", "Charlie Chaplin impersonation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPush-ups.\n\n\tAnn looks for a way to make some kind of connection with Kong, perhaps imagining that if she were to amuse him, he might not kill her.  It seems to work.  Kong is amused by her antics and even becomes a bit playful with Ann. \n"}, {"text": "Carl Denham, Jack Driscoll and crew appear hot on the heels of Kong and the missing Ann.

The scene with the insects is an homage to the original 1933-version of 'King Kong' where a scene with man-eating spiders was cut because the studio decided it was too scary! \n"}, {"text": "Despite their desperate attempts, the crew of the ship is unable to capture Kong, and several members of the crew are lost.  Fortunately, the remaining members are saved when the captain of the ship comes with reinforcements.  Alongside the captain is the lead actor of the film that Carl Denham is making.  Played by Kyle Chandler, what is this handsome-looking hero called?", "correct": "Bruce Baxter", "options": ["Eddie Emerson", "Cal Carver", "Dale Denver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBruce Baxter.\n\n\tBruce Baxter is an interesting character.

Kong is finally able to defeat the tyrannosaurs, tearing the final beast's mouth open a la the original version of 'King Kong'. \n"}, {"text": "Ann and Kong make their way to a place where the sunset is clearly visible.

After the trap fails, the remaining members of the ship's crew, along with Carl and his filmmaking crew, make their way frantically towards the ship.  Surprisingly, they are able to capture Kong, when which individual smashes a bottle of chloroform on the great gorilla's face?", "correct": "Carl", "options": ["Jack", "Captain Englehorn", "Jimmy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarl.\n\n\tFrom an elevated rock, Carl smashes an entire bottle of chloroform on Kong's face, and the giant ape is slowly overcome by the noxious fumes.
