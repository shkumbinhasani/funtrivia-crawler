The ribs act as armor to protect the lungs and the heart. Most ribs are connected to the sternum by the cartilage. The lower two ribs found on the right and left side of the body are known as floating ribs because they are the only four ribs not attached to the sternum. The only attachment they have to the body is on the vertebra. Most humans have two pairs of floating ribs. \n"}, {"text": "My friend, Hip, told me that a famous rock 'n roll star named Elvis made me famous when he shook me.
