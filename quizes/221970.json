In 1943, the first film version of the Dark Knight, entitled simply 'The Batman', was released by Columbia Pictures.  A follow up film entitled 'Batman and Robin' appeared in 1949.  Adam West starred in a film version of his popular camp TV series 'Batman', emerging in theaters in 1966.  After Tim Burton's 1989 version, a number of sequels have followed.  And let's not forget the wonderful 2005 film 'Batman Begins', reinvigorating the 'Batman' franchise with a fresh new look and style. \n"}, {"text": "Which popular director of action and horror films brought both the 2002 film 'Spider-Man' and the 2005 follow up 'Spider-Man 2' to the big screen?", "correct": "Sam Raimi", "options": ["Wes Craven", "Tobe Hooper", "John Carpenter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam Raimi.\n\n\tSam Raimi, who has delivered such quirky films as 'The Evil Dead' and 'Darkman' to movie audiences, was selected to adapt the Marvel Comic book icon Spider-Man to the big screen.  His two 'Spider-Man' films are among the highest grossing movies of all time (as of 2005). \n"}, {"text": "Which eminently wicked Marvel Comics villain has appeared in both the original 'X-Men' film of 2000 and the sequel 'X2' of 2003?", "correct": "Magneto", "options": ["Dr. Doom", "Apocalypse", "Juggernaut"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagneto.\n\n\tMagneto, aka Magnus, aka Eric Lensherr, is played by Ian McKellen in both 'X-Men' and 'X2'.  He is traditionally one of the most prominent villains in the 'X-Men' comic books.

In the 1978 film, Reeve is featured alongside Gene Hackman, as Lex Luthor, Marlon Brando, as Superman's father Jor-El and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane.  My favorite 'Superman' villain happens to be General Zod, who is portrayed by Terence Stamp in the 1980 sequel 'Superman II' (he also makes a brief appearance in the original). \n"}, {"text": "The Fantastic Four have been featured in several film (and television) versions, but none more successful at the box office than the 2005 version.

They band together to help save 'Captain Amazing', a genuine hero with high credentials who is kidnapped by the sinister Casanova Frankenstein.  The movie is really a comedy spoof based on a comic book that pokes fun at more serious superhero-style comics.  And it has a great cast (Greg Kinnear, Geoffrey Rush, William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, etc. etc.)! \n"}, {"text": "The movie series 'Blade' is based on a comic book series written by Marv Wolfman and adapted to the big screen by David Goyer.  Which actor stars as the vampire-hunting anti-hero in the films?  ", "correct": "Wesley Snipes", "options": ["Ed Norton", "Woody Harrelson", "Will Smith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWesley Snipes.\n\n\tIn the comic books and films, Blade is a dhampir, half-human and half-vampire, who has made it his life's work to hunt down and kill vampires.  Wesley Snipes, an actor who is trained in various martial arts and sword-fighting, seizes the role with gusto on the big screen, thrilling audiences with his fighting skills and tough guy acting style. \n"}, {"text": "'Hellboy', the 2004 film about a demon-child that has been co-opted to serve the forces of good, is based on a comic book.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, 'Hellboy' is the brainchild of comic book artist and writer Mike Mignola.  The character first appeared in 1993 in a Dark Horse comic called 'San Diego Comic-Con Comics'.  In the movie, Hellboy is played by Ron Perlman, who captures the brooding character of Hellboy almost perfectly. \n"}, {"text": "Which director applied his signature avant-garde style to the 2003 box office disappointment 'Hulk', based on the Marvel Comics character called The Incredible Hulk?", "correct": "Ang Lee", "options": ["David Fincher", "Paul Anderson", "John Woo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAng Lee.\n\n\tI think that the movie 'Hulk' has been treated unfairly by critics and movie audiences alike.  Ang Lee provides an excellent mix of action (with a great deal of CGI graphics involved) and character development in creating this visually pleasing film.  Eric Bana is quite good as Dr. Bruce Banner, while Jennifer Connelly shines, as usual, as Banner's love interest Dr. Betty Ross.  Sam Elliott plays Betty's by-the-book military father, and Nick Nolte goes completely over the top as Bruce's raging madman of a father.\r If you haven't seen it, try it with an open mind.  If you watched it once and didn't care for it, try it again with the object of enjoying the amazing visuals (and the comic book framework style).\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
