With whom did she have contact shortly before her death?", "correct": "Jack Ruby", "options": ["Lee Harvey Oswald", "Abraham Zapruder", "Jesse Curry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Ruby.\n\n\tKilgallen interviewed Ruby - and later stated that she had a great story that would break the Kennedy assassination wide open.

How did she officially die?", "correct": "Traffic incident", "options": ["Drug overdose", "Gunshot", "Fall from a height"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTraffic incident.\n\n\tCheramie apparently warned of the shooting-to-come, but was not taken seriously.

Tippitt", "options": ["Guy Bannister", "Clay Shaw", "Jim Garrison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJ.D. Tippitt\n\n\tTippitt is the cop who was killed in Dallas on the day of the assassination.
