What word, meaning 'intuition from the gut' as opposed to truth from logic or evidence, is it?", "correct": "Truthiness", "options": ["Truthicentrism", "Truthicity", "Truthical"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTruthiness.\n\n\tAppearing on \"The Colbert Report\", a satirical news program, Stephen Colbert led the nation with this word that appeared at the top of the Webster 2006 word list AND the American Dialect Society's list.  The word refers to truth attained from a gut instinct as opposed to fact or proven evidence through intellectual observation or logic. According to Colbert in interviews, the term highlights the United States' selfish opinion on truth not only being something that people 'feel' is correct, but that it is something that can only be correct because 'they' are the ones feeling its merit.  In a sense, it pokes fun at the public's disregard for empirical fact in various aspects of life. Since the show's debut, Colbert has also coined the term 'Wikiality'. \n"}, {"text": "In 2006, this important word appeared on the list.

With growing technology and public awareness, the basic plan is to avoid impact on the planet while allowing the current series of ecosystems to endure the negative factors currently in place. \n"}, {"text": "Popularized by the increase of cell phone usage, this word was an entry from 2004.  What word, ranking at #20 on the list of the decade, refers to messages written between cellular devices?", "correct": "Texting", "options": ["Wording", "Celling", "Keytapping"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTexting.\n\n\tTexting, text messaging, or SMSing, is a cell phone-related form of communication using the text input on a phone to send a wireless 'e-mail-like' message to anyone with a capable handheld device.  As this feature cost less than normal calling and as it could be done much faster, text messaging quickly became a norm in terms of communication. Due to a surge in the amount of text messaging, phones were soon released with full keyboards built in.  Handheld devices such as the iPhone have the ability to log entire message histories on their memory.  As with e-mail, text messaging has the ability to generate spam. \n"}, {"text": "This word first appeared in 2002 but ranked at #18.

For the decade's list, it ranked #17 and it refers to a message consisting of no more than 140 characters.  What is the website?", "correct": "Twitter", "options": ["Bing", "Facebook", "MySpace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwitter.\n\n\t\"Twitter.com\", a site whose principal function is to allow for social grooming and inane babble, became a companion in the Facebook generation.  Using nothing more than 140 characters per post, Twitter acts as a wall for users to post what they want in the moment from their computers, cell phones or wireless devices. As a result, the site is flooded with nonsense more than half the time.  Facebook has had a near identical part of their site which can accommodate for more than 140 characters (a basic status update) but nonetheless, visitors have enjoyed the simple functions of their Twitter pages, opting to follow friends and converse in snippets rather than in lengthy messages. \n"}, {"text": "An early Bushism, this word appeared on lists back in 2002 and reached #15 in the decade's top list.

I was one.\"\r\"You teach a child to read, and he or her will be able to pass... a literacy test.\"\r Much of these mistakes have been used against Bush in regards to satirical jabs and have become synonymous with his reign as President. \n"}, {"text": "In 2009, widespread panic about a possible 'Swine Flu' outbreak placed this term near the top of the lists.

Though most of the world received both confirmed cases and deaths as a result, vaccinations have been available. The flu can not be contracted from pork products or proximity to swine, despite its name. \n"}, {"text": "At #7 on the list, this 2007 word refers to a website notable for becoming the most visited on the Internet.

With a recession in play, many countries had to feed money into investment groups and banks in order to ensure that they didn't 'go under'.  Although many people found themselves unemployed by the turn of the decade, this preventative measure softened the inevitable blow to the economy. Particular points to note include the auto crisis in the United States and major deficit in the UAE economy after many years of prosperity through natural resources. Despite the U.S. Government's so-called 'bailout' in 2008, it was actually a loan to manufacturers meant to be paid back after regaining footing. \n"}, {"text": "Popularized by Al Gore's film \"An Inconvenient Truth\" and greater public awareness, what term made the #1 spot on the 'Words of the Decade' List for 2000-2009?", "correct": "Global Warming", "options": ["CFCs", "Climate Change", "Green Planet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlobal Warming.\n\n\tGlobal warming relates to the consistent rising of the Earth's average temperature and is inherently tied to the melting of the polar ice caps, changing climates, and obscure weather patterns created through human activity.

Global Warming was created by a various array of factors from the smog created between the Industrial Revolution and now to the mining of fossil fuels to the invention of CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) and aerosol cans.  While many have felt that global warming is a reversible process if acted upon quickly, some feel that it may be Earth's final undoing. \n"}]}
