{"id": "172265", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - '38 Across' Multiple Choice Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 5 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "This episode opens in the Swamp, where Hawkeye and BJ find themselves, what else, bored and doing anything they can to make the time go by.  While Hawkeye knits (yes, knits!), he tells BJ of a fantasy that features the latter with which Hollywood actress?", "correct": "Lana Turner", "options": ["Jean Harlow", "Mae West", "Jane Russell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLana Turner.\n\n\tHawkeye's yarn (sorry, couldn't resist the pun) includes BJ in a blue smoking jacket with blue satin lapels and a zipper down the back.  Lana Turner arrives at the door wearing an angora sweater, also with a zipper down the back.  The fantasy ends unhappily, much to BJ's ire (say, isn't he married?), and when he inquires about the 'zippers down the backs' Hawkeye responds, 'They didn't catch on.' \n"}, {"text": "Frank Burns arrives at the Swamp to break up, or perhaps enhance, the monotony.  In his hand he carries a gift from his receptionist, which he shows to Hawkeye and BJ.  What sort of rather childish gift has Frank received?", "correct": "A 'BB' game", "options": ["A 'Hardy Boys' book", "A yo-yo", "A hula hoop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA 'BB' game.\n\n\tFrank's game is a small box, covered on the top with glass, featuring BBs which are rolled around into small slots or holes...remember those?  Throughout the episode we watch Frank go to work assiduously on this game, which he finally masters near the end, only to have it ruined by Hawkeye, who loosens the BBs from the holes. \n"}, {"text": "More important than Frank's gift is the section of the 'New York Times' in which the item has been wrapped.  This section of the Times contains the world famous Times' crossword, much to Hawkeye's delight.  The scene shifts to the O.R. where the doctors and nurses work away at the crossword with Father Mulcahy's assistance.  Father Mulcahy asks for a six-letter word for a 'burrowing animal'.  What is Frank's guess?", "correct": "Ferret", "options": ["Hepler", "Badger", "Gopher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFerret.\n\n\tHawkeye's initial response is 'Frank Burns', while BJ offers 'Hepler', the name of a boy from his elementary school.  Frank then blurts out 'ferret', much to the surprise of no one!  The correct answer is 'gopher'; this answer is finally provided by Hawkeye. \n"}, {"text": "Following the O.R. session we are directed to the mess tent where Hawkeye laments his inability to finish the crossword puzzle.  They only need to answer 38 across and the puzzle will be completed.  The clue asks for a 5-letter word for bedbug in what language?", "correct": "Yiddish", "options": ["Japanese", "Arabic", "Hindi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYiddish.\n\n\tThe doctors ask Father Mulcahy, who is unable to answer.  He refers them to a certain Corporal Shapiro, who is of Jewish descent, but he is of equally little help.  Shapiro claims to be from seven generations of cotton farmers in Georgia, and has a pronounced southern accent to prove it.  He doesn't even know the term 'mazel tov'. \n"}, {"text": "Frustrated to the point of desperation, Hawkeye remembers that he has a friend named Tippy Brooks who works as a doctor for the Navy.  Brooks is not only a naval doctor, but also a crossword puzzle whiz.  On what naval ship does Brooks serve?", "correct": "Essex", "options": ["Iowa", "Saratoga", "Hamilton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEssex.\n\n\tTippy Brooks is apparently a puzzle freak, he 'does the double crostic in ink', says Hawkeye.  Luckily, the Essex is currently docked in Pusan Harbor, just a phone call away.  Hawkeye is unable to contact Lieutenant Brooks, who is in surgery, so he leaves an 'urgent' message which will soon get them both in trouble. \n"}, {"text": "In a side plot, Klinger is working on his latest shenanigan to end all shenanigans.  This time, in order to acquire his beloved Section Eight, he has decided to eat a jeep.  Which of these jeep parts do we see Klinger begin to consume during this scene?", "correct": "Windshield wiper", "options": ["Spark plug", "Alternator", "Fender"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWindshield wiper.\n\n\tNot only does Klinger swallow a rather large nut, which has been doused in 30-weight motor oil, but he also chews on one of the windshield wipers.  Colonel Potter doesn't seem much phased, complaining that the wiper never worked anyway.  Later, Klinger arrives in the post-op bent over from stomach pain.  He claims to have eaten 'a couple of bolts, a horn button, part of a windshield wiper and a condensor'.  'A well-balanced meal,' suggests Hawkeye. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye's friend, Lieutenant Brooks, arrives that evening with an admiral.  They believe that a true medical emergency is on hand.  What is the name of the Admiral?", "correct": "Cox", "options": ["Barber", "Murphy", "Gaines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCox.\n\n\tAdmiral Cox is aptly played by the actor Dick O'Neill (who appeared in movies such as 'The Jerk', 'Turk 182' and 'Prizzi's Honor', while Oliver Clark admirably portrays Hawkeye's friend Lieutenant Brooks.  Clark also appeared as Ben Pierce in the 'M*A*S*H' episode 'Mail Call Three' from the sixth season. \n"}, {"text": "Not having a legitimate reason for having summoned Lieutenant Brooks and the Admiral, the doctors walk the two of them through the post-op ward in hopes that they can cover for themselves.  When the Admiral notices that no true emergency exists he is rather irked, and suggests that he will press charges.  Just then, who rushes into the post-op, announcing that several civilians have suffered from burns?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Margaret", "Radar", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tWhile the Admiral is being taken through the post-op he encounters Klinger resting comfortably on a cot.  Klinger mumbles incoherently to the Admiral when the latter addresses him, prompting Admiral Cox to lean forward to listen more closely.  When he gets close enough, Klinger plants a lovely kiss on the Admiral's cheek!  Father Mulcahy saves the day after the Admiral fumes about wanting an investigation.  It seems an ambulance has arrived with a number of burn patients. \n"}, {"text": "With a true emergency on hand, all available personnel are needed to assist in the O.R.  Fortunately, not only is Hawkeye's friend Tippy a doctor, the Admiral is as well.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, though the Admiral is only a visitor on the Essex, he is also a trained surgeon, thus why he accompanied Brooks to the 4077th in the first place.  He proves quite skilled in the emergency surgery session and grows to admire the doctors at the 4077th for their abilities in the crunch.  He decides not to press charges despite discovering that no real emergency existed. \n"}, {"text": "Finally, by the end of the episode the Admiral and Lieutenant Brooks are ready to make their way back to their ship.  Before leaving, however, the Admiral provides the missing word that Hawkeye has been seeking to finish the crossword puzzle.  What is this 5-letter word that begins with the letter 'V'?", "correct": "Vontz & Vantz & Vonts & Vants", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVontz & Vantz & Vonts & Vants.\n\n\tHow the Admiral knows this answer is not explained.  I suppose that one must know such important trivia to reach the upper echelon positions of the U.S. military?  On their way out, Admiral Cox and Lieutenant Brooks are chaufferred by Klinger.  Potter warns Klinger by exclaiming, 'And Klinger, no kissing!'  Thank you for having a go at this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my other 'M*A*S*H'-related quizzes. \n"}]}
