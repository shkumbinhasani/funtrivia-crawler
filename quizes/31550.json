(One of its sources is the mineral called wolframite.) \n"}, {"text": "What is the melting point of tungsten?", "correct": "3410 C", "options": ["1650 C", "1000 C", "2250 C"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3410 C.\n\n\tThis makes it ideal for light bulb filaments. Above 1650 C it also has the highest tensile strength. \n"}, {"text": "When was tungsten discovered?", "correct": "1783", "options": ["1892", "1855", "1699"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1783.\n\n\tBy Fausto and Juan Jose de Elhuyar. \n"}, {"text": "Tungsten is the heaviest element with a stable isotope.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tFive of its ten isotopes are stable. However, the next eight elements heavier than tungsten also have stable isotopes. Lead is the heaviest with a stable isotope (it was theorized to be bismuth, but it was proven to be radioactive with an extremely long half-life). \n"}]}
