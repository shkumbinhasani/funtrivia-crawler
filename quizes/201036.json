{"id": "201036", "name": "15 Questions: Deathtrap Multiple Choice Quiz | Movies", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Deathtrap"], "questions": [{"text": "Michael Caine plays Sidney Bruhl, a playwright who was once famous for writing successful Broadway \"thrillers\".  Which of the following is NOT the name of one of his plays? ", "correct": "Murder By Gun", "options": ["The Murder Game", "Gunpoint", "Murder Most Fair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMurder By Gun.\n\n\t\"The Murder Game,\" according to several characters in the film, was Sidney's biggest hit.  \"Murder Most Fair\" is his latest flop.  Clifford Anderson mentions \"Gunpoint\" early in his visit to the Bruhl home.  I made up \"Murder By Gun.\" \n"}, {"text": "After the disastrous opening night of his new Broadway play, Sidney drunkenly takes the train home, to upstate New York.  Where does he live?", "correct": "Easthampton", "options": ["Syracuse", "Montauk", "Sag Harbor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEasthampton.\n\n\tBoth Montauk and Sag Harbor are mentioned in the film, but the Bruhl estate is located in Easthampton, NY. \n"}, {"text": "Sidney explains to his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) that he has received in the mail a play from a young man named Clifford Anderson, and at first, Sidney thinks that he remembers Clifford as an obese student from a college seminar that he once taught.  A bit later in the film, though, Sidney tells Myra that he's misremembered, and that the obese student he was thinking of was someone else entirely.  Sidney struggles to remember this other student's unusual name, but is onlt sure of the first letter of that name.  What's the first letter of this student's name?", "correct": "Q", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nQ.\n\n\tSidney: \"Wait a minute.  The fat one didn't stay for the whole week.  And his name was...Quincy?  Quimby?  Something with a 'Q'.\"  (All of this remembering and misremebering business is, of course, completely faked by Sidney, but we don't know that during this scene.) \n"}, {"text": "Myra Bruhl has a debilitating medical condition.  What is it?", "correct": "a weak heart", "options": ["liver cancer", "asthma", "diabetes"], "explanation": "\n\n\na weak heart.\n\n\tSidney and Clifford take advantage of Myra's cardiac condition:  they know that an appropriate fright will kill her where she stands.  She has a massive coronary while Clifford chases her around the house with apparent intent to kill. \n"}, {"text": "After Sidney apparently kills Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), he tells Myra that he plans to conceal the body right on their own property.  Where?", "correct": "in the vegetable patch", "options": ["behind the garage", "in the attic", "in the wine cellar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nin the vegetable patch.\n\n\tSidney: \"We'll bury him, behind the garage.  [pause]  No!  In the vegetable patch.  Easier digging.\"  \r I've always wondered about this burial bit.  Since Sidney and Clifford faked their whole fight, and Clifford's \"death,\" how did Sidney bury Clifford alive, presumably in front of Myra, without actually suffocating him?  Hmmm... \n"}, {"text": "Once Myra is dead, Sidney and Clifford begin their new life together.  Clifford is hard at work on a new play, which he claims is based on his experiences in a previous job.  Where was Clifford's alleged job?", "correct": "a welfare office", "options": ["a college", "a coffee shop", "a prison"], "explanation": "\n\n\na welfare office.\n\n\tClifford tells Sidney that he is writing a play based on his experiences in a welfare office, and even cites some specific examples of the characters and the pathos that he is striving to capture on the page.  This is all a series of lies: Clifford is actually writing a thriller called \"Deathtrap,\" which is based on the murder of Myra Bruhl that he and Sidney orchestrated only weeks before. \n"}, {"text": "Sidney's lawyer, Porter Milgrim (Henry Jones), immediately realizes that Clifford Anderson is a homosexual.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tPorter spends a few minutes with Clifford, and once Clifford leaves, Sidney asks Porter, \"Do you think he's gay?\"  Porter looks shocked at the question, and replies, \"No, he didn't strike me that way.\"  I suppose that question was Sidney's way of living dangerously, since his homosexual relationship with Clifford is a secret he most definitely wouldn't want the general public to know about. \n"}, {"text": "Once Sidney figures out that Clifford might not be as trustworthy as he originally thought, he asks Clifford a few questions about his shady past.  Fill in the missing word in Sidney's final question:  \n\nSIDNEY: \"Did any of the social workers, the shrinks...did any of them ever use the word...\"\n\nCLIFFORD:  \"What word, love?\"\n\nSIDNEY:  \"____________________.\"", "correct": "sociopath", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nsociopath.\n\n\tOne has to wonder how Clifford became the sociopath that he clearly is.  Right and wrong mean nothing to him -- all he wants is a shortcut to fame. \n"}, {"text": "Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth), the neighborhood psychic -- and yes, I know how weird that sounds -- tells the Bruhls that she will soon be appearing on a televised talk show.  Who's the host of the show in question?", "correct": "Merv Griffin", "options": ["Johnny Carson", "Dinah Shore", "Mike Douglas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMerv Griffin.\n\n\tWe never get to see the broadcast, but later dialogue tells us that Helga's appearance on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" didn't go very well.  By the end of the film, Helga turns out to be a much more integral character than her early appearances suggest! \n"}, {"text": "As Helga walks around the Bruhls' house just after the apparent murder of Clifford Anderson, her ESP gives her quite a few hints about what had just happened...and what is yet to come.  One of the most powerful visions she gets leads her to ask Sidney and Myra if they know a certain man.  Later in the film, Helga realizes that that particular vision wasn't referencing a man at all, but an inanimate object.  What was the object?", "correct": "a typewriter", "options": ["a dagger", "a train", "a car"], "explanation": "\n\n\na typewriter.\n\n\tHelga originally asks Sidney and Myra if they know a short black man with earmuffs named \"Smith Colona.\"  Neither of them does, which makes sense: Helga was actually picking up on Clifford Anderson's typewriter -- a stout, black Smith-Corona model.  The \"earmuffs\" were the broad, round knobs on either side of the roller.  (Yes, roller.  People did, once upon a time, use manual typewriters.) \n"}, {"text": "After Myra's death, Porter informs Sidney how much money he stands to gain from her estate and life insurance policy.  How much is it?", "correct": "$1,000,000", "options": ["$5,000,000", "$20,000,000", "$10,000,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$1,000,000.\n\n\tSidney originally tells Clifford that the amount he stands to inherit is \"minimal,\" but he later admits that he was lying: Sidney is about to come into \"about a million dollars,\" according to his own dialogue. \n"}, {"text": "Sidney's study doubles as an arsenal of sorts.  With which weapon does he mortally wound Clifford at the end of the film?", "correct": "a crossbow", "options": ["an axe", "a dagger", "a pistol"], "explanation": "\n\n\na crossbow.\n\n\tSidney shoots Clifford in the back with a single crossbow bolt.  Clifford drops like a rock, but later regains consciousness just long enough to swing an axe at Sidney's neck.  Since Helga Ten Dorp steals the \"Deathtrap\" play for herself, it's reasonable to assume that Sidney and Clifford killed each other. \n"}, {"text": "After Myra's death, Helga pays a visit on Sidney, ostensibly to borrow something.  What does she ask to borrow?", "correct": "candles", "options": ["a teapot", "a flashlight", "a Crock-Pot"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncandles.\n\n\tShe pretends to want candles, but this is pretense: she really comes over to warn Sidney that Clifford is going to attack him...and of course, she turns out to be right.  It's a good thing she borrowed those candles, though -- they come in awfully handy in the climax of the film! \n"}, {"text": "What is unusual about the hat that Helga wears throughout the film?", "correct": "It has reflectors on it.", "options": ["It is too big for her.", "It is too small for her.", "It has a propeller on it."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt has reflectors on it.\n\n\tHelga wears a \"reflector cap,\" since she is a late-night jogger, and it seems to fit her perfectly.  She even wears it to the premiere of \"her\" play, despite the fact that she is wearing an evening gown! \n"}, {"text": "What is the last line of the film?", "correct": "\"Waste not, want not!\"", "options": ["\"Never look a gift horse in the mouth!\"", "\"The butler did it!\"", "\"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush!\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Waste not, want not!\".\n\n\tSeymour Starger, formerly Sidney's agent, says to his new client Helga on the opening night of \"Deathtrap\": \"Helga, baby, that play you wrote is gonna make us a fortune!\"  Helga, seemingly (and surprisingly) possessed of no more of a conscience than Sidney or Clifford, responds with \"Waste not, want not!\" \n"}]}
