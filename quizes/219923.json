{"id": "219923", "name": "Modern Times Quiz | M | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "M", "Mi - Mo Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Charlie Chaplin is the director, writer, producer and composer of the music for 'Modern Times'.  Naturally, he also appears as the star of the film.  What is his character called in the movie's credits?", "correct": "A factory worker", "options": ["A poor man", "A tramp", "A laborer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA factory worker.\n\n\tThough he plays his usual 'Tramp' character in the film, Charlie Chaplin's character is simply called 'a factory worker' in the credits.
