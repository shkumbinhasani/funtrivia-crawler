{"id": "220872", "name": "Top Movies of 1991 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1990s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Terry Gilliam directs and Robin Williams stars in one of the most peculiar and memorable films of 1991.  The story revolves around a radio 'shock jock' who inadvertently inspires the murder of a professor's wife.  After three years, Jack, the former radio man whose life has become a complete mess, meets Parry, the professor turned vagrant, and both of their lives are completely transformed.  Which film is this?", "correct": "The Fisher King", "options": ["Brazil", "Twelve Monkeys", "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fisher King.\n\n\tTerry Gilliam's most underrated and understated masterpiece, 'The Fisher King' combines a whimsical narrative with a high level of pathos.  Robin Williams is brilliant, and Jeff Bridges, Mercedes Ruehl, Amanda Plummer and Michael Jeter all give very memorable performances.  This film is a gem. \n"}, {"text": "'Raise the Red Lantern' is a simply beautiful film about a wealthy Chinese man from the historical past, who maintains a household with four wives.  Needless to say, there is a great deal of conflict between the four wives.  Which highly acclaimed Chinese director is responsible for this cinematic masterwork?", "correct": "Zhang Yimou", "options": ["John Woo", "Ang Lee", "Wayne Wang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZhang Yimou.\n\n\tAs is usual with Zhang's early films, 'Raise the Red Lantern' features the acting of the beautiful Li Gong.  The Mandarin Chinese title for the film is 'Da Hong Deng Long Gao Gao Gua' (the English is essentially a direct translation).  If you haven't seen any of Zhang's films, this is a good one with which to start. \n"}, {"text": "'Delicatessen' is a devilishly funny comedy from the demented minds of directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  From which country comes this fiendish delight of a film?", "correct": "France", "options": ["Brazil", "Spain", "Germany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrance.\n\n\tCaro and Jeunet, who gave us 'The City of Lost Children' and 'Amelie' (just Jeunet), collaborated on 'Delicatessen', a very amusing story that features a cannabalist sub-plot (but, please, don't let that scare you off.)  This film brings surrealism to great heights on the silver screen...worth a look. \n"}, {"text": "Virtually no one expected it, but the film 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day', released in 1991, actually lived up to its predecessor ('The Terminator').  Which 'tech-noir' director brings this film, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, to the big screen?", "correct": "James Cameron", "options": ["Steven Spielberg", "John McTiernan", "David Lynch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Cameron.\n\n\tIn a surprise twist, James Cameron employs Ah-nold as the 'good guy' Terminator in this film, with Robert Patrick taking the role as the 'bad guy' T1000.  Edward Furlong is also added as John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the evil robots.  This film may be a rare example of a sequel surpassing its progenitor. \n"}, {"text": "John Singleton made quite a big splash in his directorial debut.  His first film is the story of a group of friends growing up in the rugged, seedy environment of urban Los Angeles during the 1980s.  What is this impactful, gritty film called?", "correct": "Boyz n the Hood", "options": ["New Jack City", "Jungle Fever", "Colors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoyz n the Hood.\n\n\t'Boyz n the Hood' features a superior cast, with Laurence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube (in his film debut), Angela Bassett and Morris Chestnut all gracing the screen with their presence.  John Singleton was only 24 years old when he directed this film; he received an Oscar nomination (making him the youngest director to have received such an accolade). \n"}, {"text": "One of the great box-office successes of 1991 is the combination action/chick flick 'Thelma and Louise'.  Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis star in this movie as the title characters.  Who lent his exceptional directorial skills to the film?", "correct": "Ridley Scott", "options": ["David Anspaugh", "Sydney Pollack", "Robert Altman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRidley Scott.\n\n\tRidley Scott takes a surprising turn here, directing a film that is much less about action and much more about the relationship between two very close friends.  Rounding out the all-star cast are Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Brad Pitt in the role that made him famous. \n"}, {"text": "Richard Linklater, who would later direct such films as 'School of Rock' and 'Before Sunset', presents to us, in 1991, a brilliant film that meanders in and out of the lives of dozens of people, mostly Generation-Xers, in the not-so-prime of their mundane existences.  What is the title of this unique film?", "correct": "Slacker", "options": ["Clerks", "Stranger than Paradise", "Naked"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlacker.\n\n\t'Slacker' simply has to be seen in order to get a full understanding of its magnitude.  In essence, the camera bounces from one individual to another, as they wend and weave their way into and out of each other's lives.  The film is mostly dialog, some of it completely bizarre.  The cast is filled with unknowns. \n"}, {"text": "From the mercurial mind of director Pedro Almod\u00f3var comes the 1991 comedy/drama 'High Heels' ('Tacones Lejanos'), the story of a mother and daughter who both have loved the same man.  In which language is this film featured?", "correct": "Spanish", "options": ["Portuguese", "French", "Italian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpanish.\n\n\tOne of Almod\u00f3var's most understated classics, 'High Heels' also includes the acting handiwork of Victoria Abril and Marisa Paredes as the daughter and mother rivals.  As per usual for Almod\u00f3var, the themes sometimes revolve around sex, but there is much more substance to be found on a more profound level. \n"}, {"text": "The big film of 1991, in terms of critical acclaim and major awards, is 'The Silence of the Lambs', directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Anthony Hopkins as the diabolical killer Hannibal Lecter.  Who stars alongside Hopkins as the green but gutsy FBI agent, Clarice Starling?", "correct": "Jodie Foster", "options": ["Holly Hunter", "Sissy Spacek", "Helen Hunt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJodie Foster.\n\n\tBoth Hopkins and Foster give wonderful performances, and both were rewarded with Oscars that year (as was the film, for Best Picture).  Rounding out the cast are Scott Glenn as Starling's superior at the FBI, and Ted Levine as the utterly frightening serial murderer Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb.  Enjoy this film with a nice Chianti and a plate of liver and fava beans. \n"}, {"text": "Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker star as Idgie and Ruth, two women whose lives are intertwined in 1920s Alabama.  The story of Idgie and Ruth is told by the elderly Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy), who has an eager listener in Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates).  What is this joyous film called?", "correct": "Fried Green Tomatoes", "options": ["Sweet Home Alabama", "They Won't Forget", "The Long Walk Home"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFried Green Tomatoes.\n\n\t'Fried Green Tomatoes' was adapted from Fannie Flagg's charming novel 'Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe'.  Fannie Flagg also briefly appears in the film as a motivational speaker.  \r The four lead actresses give excellent performances in the film which, surprisingly, was directed by a man, namely Jon Avnet.  \r I hope you have enjoyed this quiz.  Please feel free to give me your personal favorites from 1991...maybe our lists will compare favorably. \n"}]}
