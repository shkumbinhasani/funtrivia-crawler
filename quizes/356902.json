{"id": "356902", "name": "Please Sir!  I Want Some More - British Foods Quiz | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "International Cuisine", "British Foods"], "questions": [{"text": "The origins of this food item can be found in the northern counties of England during the Elizabethan period.  They take their name from the effect that they will have on you if you eat too many.  By what name are they known?", "correct": "Fat Rascals", "options": ["Windy Buns", "Farty Fancies", "Stargazy Pie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFat Rascals.\n\n\tOriginating in Yorkshire, 'Fat Rascals' are a cross between a scone and another type of sweet cake known as a 'Rock Cake'.  Ideally a fat rascal should be served warm, split and spread thickly with butter and a fruit preserve.  Larger than either a scone or a rock cake, fat rascals will certainly put a strain on your waistbands, should you overindulge! \n"}, {"text": "These popular cheeses hail from the English county of Somerset and take their name from the town near Yeovil in which they were first made.  Which town is this?", "correct": "Ilchester", "options": ["Salisbury", "Sherborne", "Ilford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIlchester.\n\n\tThe Ilchester Cheese Company was founded in 1962 by a local hotelier, making the company a relative new-comer to the cheese world.  Although they do not manufacture cheese themselves, the Ilchester Company was the very first in Britain that marketed cheeses blended with other ingredients such as ales and fruits of various kinds.  One of their most popular products is a slightly softer form of cheddar cheese that has been flavoured using smoke from burning apple wood and named, unsurprisingly, Applewood Smoked Cheddar! \n"}, {"text": "These small pies have been popular in Scotland for many generations and have also become popular with the 'Sassenachs'. The traditional meaty filling is mutton.  By what name are these delicious little pies commonly known?", "correct": "Scotch Pies", "options": ["Welsh Pies", "Orkney Pudding", "Manx Pasty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScotch Pies.\n\n\tThese small double-crust pies are usually four inches in diameter, only an inch and a half high and stuffed tightly with minced mutton and onions before being baked.  Any fat contained in the mutton bubbles out through the pie crust which helps keep these tasty little pies nice and moist.  There is nothing quite like biting into a hot scotch pie and letting the fat dribble down your chin!  Served with 'buster' peas, a form of mushy peas smothered with vinegar, they are also known north of the border as 'savoury pies' or 'mince pies'.  A word of warning however; an over-indulgence of 'buster' peas will lead to quite serious flatulence! \n"}, {"text": "'Podin Henlys' is a sweet pudding prepared and served to the dancers and spectators at the 'Furry Day' celebrations in which Cornish town each May?", "correct": "Helston", "options": ["St Ives", "Padstow", "Zennor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHelston.\n\n\tThis is a lightly textured fruity pudding made principally from suet and having the unusual, added ingredient of ground rice flour.  Also containing raisins, currants, sultanas, apricots and nutmeg, Helston pudding is traditionally served on 'Furry Day' ('furry', rhyming with 'hurry') when the world famous 'Floral Dance' takes place each year on the 8th of May, the feast day for Saint Michael; 'Furry Day' is one of the oldest celebrations still practiced in Britain and is believed to welcome the arrival of Spring. \n"}, {"text": "Used as a spice for over 5000 years, this ingredient is usually encountered in seed form and has a mild calming effect.  For this reason it was often used in food served at funeral wakes; 'Wiggs' and 'Yorkshire Funeral Biscuits' are two such foods.  What are these seeds that, with cumin, are also used to flavour the spirit, 'K\u00fcmmel'?", "correct": "Caraway Seed", "options": ["Pumpkin Seed", "Fennel Seed", "Onion Seed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaraway Seed.\n\n\tCaraway seems to have been very popular in the areas of Britain in which mining was the primary industry, such as Yorkshire and South Wales.  A popular cake in both these areas is known simply as 'seed cake' which consists of a simple sponge cake containing caraway seeds.  Personally, I think that the flavour of caraway is an acquired taste; one of which I've found impossible to acquire! \n"}, {"text": "If you were living in the United Kingdom whilst the 'horsemeat in food' scandal was in full swing, you may have been excused if you hadn't been to keen on eating this meat pie that hails from a town prominent within the UK horse racing industry.  From which Berkshire town does this dish take its name?", "correct": "Ascot", "options": ["Ipswich", "Guildford", "Cirencester"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAscot.\n\n\tAscot Pie, a variation of the traditional British pork pie, is made with veal and ham in a hot water crust that is baked in a long tin in a similar manner to a loaf of bread.  Ascot Pie bears a similarity to another traditional British long pie known as 'Gala Pie', an elongated pork pie that has boiled egg running through its centre. \n"}, {"text": "This dish, now regarded as typically British, was brought back to Britain by soldiers returning home from service in the Indian sub-continent.

A very popular form of the dessert was a whipped cream-like syllabub floating in a glass of sweet dessert wine.  Syllabub finally began to wane in popularity during the 18th century at the time when ice-cream became more readily available. \n"}, {"text": "If you have answered the preceding questions correctly, each initial letter will spell the answer to this question...These are small, breadcrumb covered patties usually found on the hotplate at the local fish and chip shop.
