{"id": "90592", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'For Want of a Boot' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "It's a cold and windy day in late autumn for our miserable friends at M*A*S*H.  With the weather turning frigid and wet, nothing could be worse than a boot with a worn sole, but that's exactly what Hawkeye has...a hole worn right through!  But on which foot does he have this problem?", "correct": "right & r", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nright & r.\n\n\tHawkeye claims that he put in an order for a new pair of boots 3 months previous and has heard nothing in response.  As for the hole, it's gigantic...I've never seen a hole that big in the bottom of a shoe, which makes me a bit skeptical...but, they needed it for the plot! \n"}, {"text": "What item of Frank's does Hawkeye attempt to use as a barrier between his foot and the boot, only to be immediately 'busted' by Frank?", "correct": "Birthday card from Frank's wife", "options": ["Covering to Frank's Bible", "Picture of Frank's mother", "Frank's army ID card"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBirthday card from Frank's wife.\n\n\t'To my darling husband, on the day of your birth, you made a heaven for me on Earth'...is what the postcard says from Frank's wife...how saccharin!  Of course, being the obsequious husband, notices the missing birthday card immediately and demands its return.  The adventure begins... \n"}, {"text": "The first stop on the quest for a new boot is with the supply sergeant, a recurring character played by Johnny Haymer.  What is the supply sergeant's name? ", "correct": "Zale", "options": ["Rizzo", "Hayman", "Quigley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZale.\n\n\tSupply Sergeant Zelmo Zale, a frequent guest star over the next several seasons, makes his first appearance in the episode 'For Want of a Boot'.  I always enjoyed Haymer's performances, he played a good foil for Klinger. \n"}, {"text": "This supply sergeant is of course perfectly able to acquire a new set of boots for Hawkeye, and should do it by duty, but he realizes he can get a little something out of the deal.  He promises to get Hawkeye his boots in return for some dental work.  Next stop, the camp dentist Captain Futterman, played by which Oscar-nominated actor?", "correct": "Michael Lerner", "options": ["Harvey Keitel", "Tommy Lee Jones", "Robert Loggia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Lerner.\n\n\tMichael Lerner is probably best remembered for his marvelous performance as Jack Lipnick in the 1991 film Barton Fink, for which he was nominated as Best Supporting Actor (beaten out by Jack Palance for 'City Slickers').  It's odd though, you'd think as camp dentist we'd see him again, but this was his only appearance.  I guess they normally hid the camp dentist away! \n"}, {"text": "Futterman agrees to take care of the supply sergeant's mouth, but again, for a price.  It is the dream of Dr. Futterman to get a 3-day pass to go to what exotic local where he can observe 'chubby, half-naked diving girls' who are 'irritating oysters to produce pearls'.  To what place does he wish to depart? ", "correct": "Japan", "options": ["Philippines", "Hawaii", "Thailand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\tDr. Futterman insists that he was kidnapped as a child from Japan and that he is, in fact, Japanese.  His ultimate goal, to become an underwater dentist in an all-night bath house!  I guess his journey begins simply...just a 3-day pass? \n"}, {"text": "To get the 3-day pass, Trapper and Hawkeye naturally have to go and see Henry.  They catch Henry at a bad time, he's irritated by both the mountain of paperwork that Radar is shoving in his face, and by the fact that Margaret is once again preparing a negative report on him to General Mitchell...you'd think he'd be used to both by now!  The next mission for Trapper and Hawkeye is to somehow mollify Margaret so that Henry will okay the 3-day pass.  They promise that they will hold a party for what occasion?", "correct": "Frank's birthday", "options": ["One year anniversary of the war", "Margaret's birthday", "Frank's and Margaret's one year 'friendship' anniversary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank's birthday.\n\n\tTrapper accepts the offer easily but Hawkeye doesn't want to stoop that low, after all...it is Frank Burns!  One step into a muddy puddle outside of Margaret's tent quickly changes Hawkeye's mood, however.  Next stop...Radar. \n"}, {"text": "In order to have a high quality party, the boys come to Radar in order to procure what important item?", "correct": "A cake", "options": ["A hog for roasting", "A case of wine", "Nurses from the 8063rd"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cake.\n\n\tA birthday cake for Frank.  I'm not sure why they couldn't acquire a cake themselves, it doesn't seem logical that Radar could get one but that they couldn't!  Oh yes...it's for the plot! \n"}, {"text": "Radar only agrees to work with Hawkeye and Trapper if they can help him with his problem, he's 'lonely'.  He demands a date with which nurse?", "correct": "Nurse Murphy", "options": ["Nurse Kelly", "Nurse Anderson", "Nurse Jacobs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNurse Murphy.\n\n\tNurse Murphy, played by Suzanne Zenor, is one tough cookie...she rebuffs every ploy that the doctors attempt.  Here's some dialogue:  Hawkeye: 'We need to borrow you for one evening.'  Trapper: 'And your heart doesn't have to be in it!'  Hawkeye: 'Is that unreasonable?'  Trapper: 'I wish someone would make me that offer!'.  Trapper later describes Radar...as 'Gary Cooper-ish', to which Hawkeye responds, 'Well, he's a little more 'ish' than Cooper.' \n"}, {"text": "This nurse will only date Radar if Trapper and Hawkeye can garner what item for her from Klinger?", "correct": "Hair dryer", "options": ["Nylon stockings", "Pink chiffon dress", "Satin gown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHair dryer.\n\n\tOf course Klinger has a hair dryer in Korea (the old fashioned kind that fit over the entire head), it makes perfect sense...especially with all that hair!  He agrees to give up his hair dryer for a Section 8, naturally. \n"}, {"text": "Naturally, everything breaks down in the end and no one gets what they want...leaving Hawkeye with no boot.  What do we see Hawkeye wearing at the very ending of the episode on his foot?", "correct": "Golf bag", "options": ["A new boot", "Potato sack", "Rubber from a tire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolf bag.\n\n\tSome great lines during the party, just before everything breaks down.  In regards to signing Klinger's Section 8 papers, Frank exclaims, 'Never, you're asking me to let a pervert out of the army?'  Hawkeye's witty response, 'Right Frank, by all means, let's keep the perverts in the army!'  Trapper then says, 'Anyway, Klinger's not a pervert!'  'How do you know?' replies Margaret, to which Trapper responds, 'Because I'm one and he's never at the meetings!'  In the end...poor Hawkeye is stuck with a golf bag on his leg.  But don't fret, in the very next episode he magically has a new boot! \n"}]}
