{"id": "222594", "name": "\"Super Mario RPG\" Chronology 6 Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Mario Games", "Super Mario RPG"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of the sculptor in Nimbus Land?", "correct": "Garro", "options": ["Minno", "Shava", "Rizzo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarro.\n\n\tGarro has been a famous sculptor in Nimbus Land and he used to make many sculptures of King Nimbus, but when you arrive, he's only making sculptures of the new queen, Valentina.  When Mallow stands next to a statue of the king, Garro realizes that Mallow is the long-lost Nimbus Land Prince.  Mallow decides to save his parents, so Garro thinks of a plan where he makes Mario look like a statue.  He takes him to the palace with a statue of Valentina, and before he can leave, Valentina spots it.  He makes up a phony story and soon, Valentina is calling Mario a 'work of art'. \n"}, {"text": "At one point in your life as a statue, you'll need to avoid Dodo's beak a few times.  If you manage not to get hit, what do you get as a reward?", "correct": "Feather", "options": ["Statuette", "Stinky Amulet", "Ghost Medal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFeather.\n\n\tAfter placing you into a room with some other statues, Valentina will get angry at Dodo and tell him to polish the statues.  Rather than do his work, Dodo will take out his anger by pecking the statues.  If you manage to avoid these peckings by jumping over his beak enough, he'll leave and drop a feather in the next room.  The Feather is an accessory which will raise your character's speed by 20. \n"}, {"text": "What's inside the large egg in the castle in Nimbus Land?", "correct": "Birdo", "options": ["King Nimbus", "Yoshi", "Dodo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBirdo.\n\n\tAfter going through the castle, you'll come along a room containing a few people.  One will give you a Flower Jar and another will give you Castle Key 1.  Use this key on the door blocked by a Heavy Troopa to enter the room containing the Birdo Egg.  Talk to it and accept its offer to 'play'.  First, you need to destroy its egg with a few hits. After this, Birdo will come out and attack you.  Her moves include an attack where she'll rapidly shoot eggs like missiles at one character.  Another will be a single egg that does a lot of damage.  Birdo has great defense and is extremely resistant to magic, so use your primary physical attacks. When you defeat Birdo, you'll get Castle Key 2 which allows you to enter the door opposite the one you came in before the battle. \n"}, {"text": "Do you fight Valentina in the palace in Nimbus Land?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tContinue through the halls of the palace to the Throne Room where you will trigger a scene.  Valentina and Dodo will decide to run out the back door, so chase them out.  If you continue walking, you'll fall right through the sky and land on (what I guess is a solid) cloud.  Chase Valentina into Nimbus Land, and while the townspeople try to talk to her, catch up and start the battle.\rTo begin, Dodo will take one character away for a small battle.  After dealing a bit of life to them, Dodo will run away, but while he's still battling you, he deals quite a bit of damage.  He also has frightening attacks and muting attacks that you need to watch out for, and he also misses quite often.  After he runs away, your two remaining characters need to deal with Valentina.  She has plenty of attacks to keep you occupied and they're definitely all powerful.  After a bit of attacking, Dodo and the other character will return and you can hack away at the enemy HP.  After the battle, they'll leave and drop the key to King Nimbus' chamber.  Then after everything's straightened out, it's off to Barrel Volcano! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the man living in Barrel Volcano?", "correct": "Hinopio", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHinopio.\n\n\tQueen Nimbus recommends that you visit Hinopio when you're in the volcano in order to get supplies and extra aid.  Head to the Hot Springs and fall into the volcano.  Navigate through the caves, paths, and crevices until you come to Hino Mart where Hinopio will let you buy armor, items, and lodgings.  After this, you can keep on going to the deepest depths of the volcano where you can find the Czar Dragon and the sixth star. \n"}, {"text": "What is not one of the Czar Dragon's/Zombone's attacks?", "correct": "S'Crow Bell", "options": ["Boulder", "Flame Wall", "Water Blast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nS'Crow Bell.\n\n\tWhen you leave Hinopio's cave, you'll have a chance to save and a bridge to cross before fighting this boss.  Some Pyrospheres will meld together to create this ugly floating dragon enemy with ferocious magic attacks.  You'll remember Flame Wall from many battles since the first boss.  It'll hit every member and deal excessive damage from the Czar Dragon. The boss also has everyone's favourite magic move, Water Blast, despite the fact that he's a fire dragon.  The Czar Dragon will also summon up some Helios which are basically fire bombs.  Half-way through the battle, he'll become Zombone, and he'll use different attacks. Boulder is a newer attack and it's also used to hit everyone in your party and Storm is another new attack which will be as powerful as his Blast attack.  After you've beaten this beast, you'll find the star, but it'll be taken away by more of Smithy's Gang. \n"}, {"text": "What is not a colour of an Axem Ranger?", "correct": "Blue", "options": ["Yellow", "Red", "Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue.\n\n\tAxem Red, the leader will be a powerful physical attacker while Axem Green will use magic.  Axem Pink has the least health, but she can heal people.  Axem Yellow and Axem Black are also good with physical attacks.  After the battle seems to be over, Axem Red will jump into the huge machine behind him (the Blade) and you'll need to defeat it as well. It will charge and use the Breaker Beam move which damages everyone in your party with a devastating blow.  When the battle is over, claim your star and head back to Nimbus Land.  You can now travel by royal bus to Bowser's Keep; the final location. \n"}, {"text": "Who will sell you items in Bowser's Keep?", "correct": "Croco", "options": ["A Goomba", "Bowser", "Toad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCroco.\n\n\tAfter navigating some dark hallways past the room where you had your first boss battle in the game, you'll come across a much needed save point and Croco, the boss of Bandit's Way and Moleville Mines, who will sell you Fire Armor if you didn't buy it in Barrel Volcano and some common items like Pick Me Ups.  Believe me; stock up on them for your next battle with Exor; the giant sword which crashed into Bowser's Keep.  After this, you'll need to choose between six doors.  Once you complete four of them, you can advance and head to a new save point. \n"}, {"text": "Who is not fought before Exor?", "correct": "Count Down", "options": ["Boomer", "Magikoopa", "Croco"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCount Down.\n\n\tBefore Exor, you are to fight Magikoopa.  Like any other magic-wielding maniacal enemy, Magikoopa will have that dreaded Water Blast as well as Solidify and Flame Wall.  Magikoopa will also create monsters to hide behind with his magic (not a bad idea).  After this somewhat easy battle, he'll turn back to normal and decide to help you.  You'll get an infinite money chest and Croco will be in the next room with your final armor set and some essential items.\rOnce again, just as you're starting to near Exor, you'll need to fight Boomer on the chandeliers in Bowser's Keep.  He'll have good physical attacks, and a couple times during the battle, he'll change colour.  Just keep up with those good tactics, and pray that he doesn't use the Shaker move which will kill one party member instantly.  After this, your Chandeli-Ho will take you to the top.\rAfter this, Exor is finally here!  During this battle, not only must you deal with Exor, but you must temporarily defeat at least one of the eyes since they protect the boss.  Lots of attacks are dispersed through the different enemies, and I suggest using powerful items since they work great.  After you defeat Exor, you're sent to the final dungeon; the Factory. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the final boss of \"Super Mario RPG\"?", "correct": "Smithy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmithy.\n\n\tIn the factory, you can continue along until you meet Count Down.  Depending on what time this clock-like enemy is set to, it will use a certain magic attack (which is no doubt pretty ugly).  Two bells on top are also important to watch out for since they will damage you as well.  One bell uses the Fear Roulette attack which will automatically kill one of your party members at random.  The other will use the Dark Star attack (which doesn't seem so bad when placed next to Fear Roulette).  \rDuring the next part, you'll need to avoid battles with past bosses while moving on conveyor belts and such.  Eventually, you'll be forced to fight a Yardiovich clone to advance and after this you'll fight Cloaker and Domino.  Cloaker is mainly physical while Domino focuses on magic.  Domino's Endobubble attack will weaken a party member.  If you defeat one quickly, the other will get onto a boss called Earth Link.  Earth Link (being a snake and all) will use the Poison attack frequently and not only will it poison one party member, but it'll do plenty of damage.  Again, fight both of them to finish the fight.\rAfter this battle, head into the actual factory portion of the level and you'll eventually find Toad (how'd he get here with so little trouble?).  When you've stocked up on your final stash, there's one penultimate boss fight.  Gunyolk will have some minor attacks along with one huge attack that will severely damage your whole party.  When this is done, the final battle can begin.\rIn the first part of the Smithy battle, he'll use his hammer in a physical attack, and on the side he has Meteor Swarm and Mega Drain for magic.  After 2000HP, Smithy will be pretty active.  He'll change forms constantly, and if you have the Lazy Shell items from Rose Town, they'll make a huge difference.  He'll conjure up a whole bunch of attacks and you'll probably need to use plenty of items.  When he takes another 8000HP, you've beaten him, earned your seventh and final star, and the world is saved!  Mallow finally takes his seat in the Nimbus Land throne, Bowser rebuilds his keep, Johnny looks on from the sea, Yo'ster Island is now prosperous, Toadofsky is passing on his knowledge, Valentina and Booster get married, and everyone lives happily ever after.  :) \n"}]}
