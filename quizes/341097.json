{"id": "341097", "name": "Recipe of a Billion-Dollar Movie Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "First things first; to make a lot of money, you need to spend a lot of money.  In fact, most of the top 10 grossing movies of all time had a budget of over $150 million.  One of the highest budgets, however, was $237 million.  It cost money to make a highly animated movie at a place called Pandora.  An entire language was even invented for the movie!  Which movie is this?", "correct": "Avatar", "options": ["Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides", "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", "Toy Story 3"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvatar.\n\n\tIn 2009, \"Avatar\" smashed records by gaining over $2.7 billion in sales.  It was such a success, it was even re-released in theaters months later, and gained a few more million at that time.  It had a high budget, but the payback was huge. \n"}, {"text": "If you wanted to make a billion-dollar movie, it would help to hire the man who knows how to make such a film.  This man wrote, produced, and directed the two highest grossing movies of the first 10 billion-dollar movies.  In 1997, he set the record as the first movie to reach a billion, and held the record until 2009, when that record was beaten by a movie from the same man! Who is he?", "correct": "James Cameron", "options": ["Peter Jackson", "Jerry Bruckheimer", "Tim Burton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Cameron.\n\n\tAll four of these men produced, directed, and/or wrote billion-dollar movies, but James Cameron holds many major records.  Not only did he write, direct, and produce the first movie to make over one billion dollars (\"Titanic\"), it smashed records by making $1.8 billion.  Only three more movies reached a billion after the release of \"Titanic\", but \"Titanic\" still held the record of the highest grossing film of all time.  However, in 2009, James Cameron wrote another hit blockbuster, \"Avatar\".  This movie decimated his old \"Titanic\" record and made $2.7 billion in the box office. \n"}, {"text": "Most of the first 10 billion-dollar movies are known to be quite lengthy.  In fact, only two of the 10 are under two hours long, and two of them are actually over three hours!  So, if you want to make a billion-dollar movie, you need to keep the audience entertained for longer than most movies.  Which of these is known as being the longest of the movies (especially the special extended edition)?", "correct": "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", "options": ["Toy Story 3", "Avatar", "Titanic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\n\n\t\"Titanic\" is known as being a lengthy movie, but while it is 3 hours and 14 minutes long, that's nothing in comparison to \"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\".  It sits at 3 hours and 21 minutes; but the special extended edition is 4 hours and 23 minutes long.\r \"Toy Story 3\" is only an hour and 43 minutes long, and \"Alice in Wonderland\" is an hour and 48 minutes long.  The other eight billion-dollar movies are at least 2 1/4 hours long. \n"}, {"text": "To make a billion-dollar movie, you need the right actor/actress.  Some simply have a higher appeal than others.  One actor has been in three of the first 10 billion-dollar movies.  These are \"Alice in Wonderland\" and the two \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies.  Who is this billion-dollar actor/actress?", "correct": "Johnny Depp", "options": ["Keira Knightley", "Sigourney Weaver", "Orlando Bloom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Depp.\n\n\tJohnny Depp is the ever popular Jack Sparrow in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" series.  He also stars as the Mad Hatter in \"Alice in Wonderland\".  Orlando Bloom stars in both \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" and \"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\".  Keira Knightley stars in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\", and Sigourney Weaver, though very popular in many movies, was only in one billion-dollar movie, \"Avatar\". \n"}, {"text": "Music, whether we realize it is playing or not, is an essential part of a movie.  Movies would be nothing without it, and so to make a billion dollar movie, you need to hire a great composer.  The film score of quite a few of the first 10 billion-dollar movies were made by this man.  He co-wrote the film score for \"The Dark Knight\" and wrote the film score for both of the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies.  Who is he?", "correct": "Hans Zimmer", "options": ["James Horner", "Steve Jablonsky", "Randy Newman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHans Zimmer.\n\n\tHans Zimmer is the only music composer to have three movies in the first 10 billion-dollar movies.  James Horner has two, which happen to also be the top two (of the first 10) by James Cameron: \"Avatar\" and \"Titanic\".  Hans Zimmer has composed music for over 100 movies, including the three he has from the first 10 billion-dollar movies, as well as several other super smash hits, such as \"Inception\", two \"Kung Fu Panda\" movies, and \"The Da Vinci Code\". \n"}, {"text": "Highly anticipated sequels tend to be billion-dollar movies.  So, if you want to have your hand at making one of the highest grossing films of all time, you need to have a moderately popular movie first; and the sequel will get you that billion.  Which of these movies is the second in a series?", "correct": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest", "options": ["Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2", "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", "Transformers: Dark of the Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.\n\n\t\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" is the second in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" series, and \"On Stranger Tides\" is the fourth.  The first movie made $650 million, and the third movie made roughly $960 million (so close to a billion).  \"Pirates\" also set records by being the first movie series to have two billion-dollar films.\r \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\" was the third in the \"Transformers\" series starring Shia LaBeouf and \"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" was also the third in the series.  \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2\" might sound a bit deceiving, but it was actually the eighth movie in the \"Harry Potter\" series.\r Of the first 10 billion-dollar movies, only three were not sequels: \"Avatar\", \"Titanic\", and \"Alice in Wonderland\". \n"}, {"text": "A billion-dollar movie will likely be more of a success if you base it off of a book or comic.  If the book is already one of the most read novels, people will be thrilled to see it be made into a movie.  So it was with several of the first 10 billion-dollar movies.  Which of these was NOT based on a book?", "correct": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides", "options": ["Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2", "Alice in Wonderland", "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.\n\n\t\"Alice in Wonderland\" was based on Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking Glass\".  The \"Lord of the Rings\" series was based on the book series of the same name by JRR Tolkien, and the \"Harry Potter\" series was based on the novels by JK Rowling.\r Interestingly, though, most of the 10 billion-dollar movies were based off of SOMETHING.  The \"Pirates\" movies are very loosely based on the Disney ride of the same name, \"Transformers\" is based on the older \"Transformers\" movies, TV shows, and action figures, \"The Dark Knight\" is based on a comic (\"Batman\"), and \"Titanic\" was based on a real event.  That leaves just two completely original movies: \"Avatar\" and \"Toy Story 3\". \n"}, {"text": "If you want to make a billion-dollar movie, you need at least one character that doesn't exist.  What do I mean by that?  Be creative: aliens, dinosaurs, mythological creatures, whatever.\n\nWhich of these movies does NOT have a character like the ones described above?", "correct": "The Dark Knight", "options": ["Toy Story 3", "Avatar", "Alice in Wonderland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dark Knight.\n\n\tEvery character in \"The Dark Knight\" is human; whether they have special powers are not, they are still human.  Again, there are only humans in \"Titanic\" as well.  But \"Avatar\" is about an entirely new species, \"Toy Story 3\" has spacemen and dinosaurs, and \"Alice in Wonderland\" has talking flowers and disappearing cats.  \"Lord of the Rings\" has hobbits and much much more, \"Pirates\" has characters such as Davy Jones and the Krakken, and \"Transformers\" is about an entire robotic alien race.  Harry Potter lives in a magical world, and therefore, there are non-human characters in that movie as well.\r What?  Only two movies have only human characters?  Insane. \n"}, {"text": "If you want to make a billion-dollar movie, use real people.  Don't make an animated movie.  Animation for effect is great, and some characters can be animated as well, but don't make it \"cartoony\".  Make it look realistic.  There are exceptions, however, to every rule.  In which of these movies will you never see a face of an actor who plays a part in the movie?", "correct": "Toy Story 3", "options": ["Titanic", "Avatar", "Transformers: Dark of the Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nToy Story 3.\n\n\tOf the first 10 movies to make a billion dollars, \"Toy Story 3\" is the ONLY fully animated movie.  \"Avatar\" is mostly animated, but you do see the actual actors and actresses, and the characters from Pandora are based off of the real actors' movements and personality.  All eight of the other movies rely on a lot of great animation, but there are also a lot of real-life actors on screen.  Quite a number of the characters in some of these movies are completely animated as well, such as in \"Transformers\" and \"Lord of the Rings\". \n"}, {"text": "One sure-fire way to make a billion-dollar movie is to fill it with action and fantasy.  A romantic comedy won't get you there; people want action.  In fact, eight of the first 10 billion-dollar movies were action, and of these eight, five were fantasy movies.\n\nWhich of these was a science fiction movie, not fantasy?", "correct": "Transformers: Dark of the Moon", "options": ["Alice in Wonderland", "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides", "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon.\n\n\tFantasy, sci/fi, and action movies tend to be very popular, and the first 10 billion-dollar movies proves that.  Eight are classified as action movies, and the other two, \"Titanic\" and \"Toy Story 3\" also have a considerable amount of action.  Furthermore, real-life situations don't seem to fly as much (with the exception of \"Titanic\").  Fantasy and sci/fi dominate the first 10 billion-dollar movies.  If it's not falling in a hole and meeting the Mad Hatter, it's entering a machine and becoming a Navi.  If it's not discovering your car is an alien, it's fighting Davy Jones' beast, the Krakken. \n"}]}
