BJ exhibits a new technique of closed-chest heart message that he learned 'back in the States'.  He saves the patient, provoking an indignant Frank to exclaim, 'I'm not going to forget this, Hunnicut!'  What gratitude. \n"}, {"text": "In the post-op, BJ sees to the various patients, and helps to console both Klinger and Father Mulcahy as well.

Father Mulcahy is nervous about an inspection from the Divisional Chaplain, Colonel Maurice Hollister. \n"}, {"text": "BJ next describes his Swampmate, Hawkeye Pierce.

Naturally, he insists that the record can be broken, and he recruits nearly everyone at the 4077th to help with the task.  Margaret and Frank are not amused, and Frank goes to tell Colonel Potter immediately. \n"}, {"text": "Klinger makes one of his many attempts at a Section Eight in this episode when he dresses as a Korean woman and attempts to steal a jeep.

Potter can never be fooled by Corporal Klinger, and would we want it any other way?  Klinger desperately pleads his case after being discovered.  To prove his insanity he proclaims that, 'I'll wet my bed.  I'll wet your bed!  I'll wet the whole camp!'  Later, Klinger attempts to swim his way home.  Potter thinks the idea is ridiculous, but Klinger has a plan that includes an inflatable raft (which he releases in the Colonel's office.) \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye is able to convince Margaret to join in the jeep stuffing activity.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn the fourth season, the loosening process begins for Margaret Houlihan.  Though at first she shares in Frank's disgust of the camp's hedonism, she ends up joining entering the jeep with the rest of the houligans.  Father Mulcahy is also a part of the act, though he comes to regret it when Colonel Hollister arrives just as the picture is taken. \n"}, {"text": "Father Mulcahy is extremely nervous at the impending inspection of his work by Division Chaplain, Colonel Maurice Hollister.  Which of these actors portrays the passionate Colonel?", "correct": "Ned Beatty", "options": ["Carl Reiner", "Tom Bosley", "George Wendt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNed Beatty.\n\n\tNed Beatty, who appeared in 'Deliverance', the first two 'Superman' films and in the television show 'Roseanne', made his only 'M*A*S*H' guest appearance in this episode.

Hollister also greets Margaret as 'Major Hooligan' during the jeep-stuffing activity. \n"}, {"text": "BJ describes Colonel Potter's plan to train some Korean men to help work in the wards.

Frank is relieved by Hawkeye, who observes the former's very educational lesson.  On his way out, after a wisecrack by Hawkeye, Frank calls his Swampmate a 'stink fishpot'.  Hawkeye gets revenge by teaching the Korean men the following line: 'Frank Burns eats worms'. \n"}, {"text": "In the post-op, Colonel Hollister accompanies Father Mulcahy on his rounds.

The Father later regrets the letter he sent when Private Davis, the patient, develops complications from some remaining shell fragments. \n"}, {"text": "Following surgery to remove some shell fragments from a patient previously worked on by Frank, Hawkeye and the Major have words.

What two words go in the blank?", "correct": "Ferret face", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFerret face.\n\n\tIt appears that Hawkeye has been an effective teacher; his Korean students are learning the most important 'M*A*S*H'-related terms!
