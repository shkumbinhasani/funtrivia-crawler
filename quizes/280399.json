Their success marked the beginning of the Space Race, the one facet of the Cold War distinguished for spurring giant leaps for mankind. Humanity's foray into space has lasted decades - but what was the fate of Sputnik 1?", "correct": "After three months in orbit, it burned up on re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.", "options": ["It is still orbiting the Earth to this day.", "It was destroyed in an accidental collision with Sputnik 2, killing the dog Laika.", "It was retrieved by cosmonaut Alexey Leonov on the very first spacewalk, and is now in a Moscow museum."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAfter three months in orbit, it burned up on re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\tThe name Sputnik means \"companion\" or \"fellow traveler\"; used astronomically, it is equivalent to the English word \"satellite\". Sputnik 1 wasn't the Earth's first satellite, of course - that honor belongs to the Moon - but it was the first artificial one, and its successful launch on October 4, 1957 galvanized the world. The satellite weighed about 183 pounds (84 kilograms) and looked like a metal sphere with four long antennae, which it used to transmit temperature and atmospheric density data back to Earth - to the delight of amateur radio operators everywhere.\r Sputnik was not greeted with joy and pride everywhere in the world, of course; the fact that it used a rocket launcher originally designed for transporting nuclear missiles was not lost on the western world. The \"Sputnik crisis\" inspired a generation of scientists on both sides of the Cold War - and guaranteed government funding for them! Incredibly, people were walking on the moon less than twelve years after this little metal ball was launched into the sky. \n"}, {"text": "Few golfers would consider their set of clubs complete without a PUTter, a specialized club designed to hit the ball accurately over a short distance. How is an ordinary putter different from other clubs?", "correct": "It has a long, flat head.", "options": ["Its shaft is always much longer.", "Its shaft is always much shorter.", "It is invariably made of wood."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt has a long, flat head.\n\n\tThe putter's flat head is designed to hit the ball so that it rolls along the top of the grass, rather than going airborne. (This is why grass is kept much shorter on putting greens than elsewhere on the course.) Usually, the ball needs to travel only a few feet to the cup, so precision is crucial, as nervous golfers learn to their cost.(A golfer whose putts suffer from nervous tics is said to have a case of the \"yips.\") Some versions of the putter are designed with longer shafts that can be braced against the stomach or chest to reduce the yips, but these are not standard and their use in the sport is controversial. \n"}, {"text": "ComPUTers are an integral part of modern life - and modern trivia! Yet this word has not always meant what we think it means. Suppose you traveled back in time to the year 1895 and asked some random English speaker what a computer was. What might he or she say?", "correct": "A computer? Why, that's a person who does mathematical calculations. It's a woman, usually.", "options": ["I think I saw that word in the latest Jules Verne novel. Yes, it was a kind of crystal that Captain Antifer used to find his way home.", "It's a wizard of some kind, I think - someone skilled in magic. No one uses that word these days, though.", "Computers are those new-fangled machines that use hydraulics to solve equations. They're very clever, but quite useless."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA computer? Why, that's a person who does mathematical calculations. It's a woman, usually.\n\n\tThe first documented use of the word \"computer\" to refer to a device for calculation was not until 1897, when - as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" reports - it appeared in an article in a journal called \"Engineering.\" Early mechanical computers were all analog, often relying on gears powered by hand cranks. So, for real number-crunching power, mathematicians and scientists called on the human brain - especially brains belonging to women, whose other options in math and science were limited and who were willing to work for half the pay of a man. Complex problems were broken into parts and solved in parallel by teams of women, whose calculational abilities were measured in \"girl-years.\" \r Short on respect and short on cash, these human computers were nevertheless vital to scientific progress. The first known organized team of computers calculated the return of Halley's Comet in the mid-eighteenth century. In 1840, a male computer named Radhanath Sikdar was the first to find the height of Mount Everest. Henrietta Swan Leavitt, working as a computer counting stars in photographs at Harvard College Observatory, discovered Cepheid variable stars (whose brightness varies periodically over time) and mapped out the relationship between their luminosity and the period of their variations - information that allowed us to measure the distances between galaxies for the first time. Another Harvard College Observatory computer, Annie Jump Cannon, pioneered the classification of stars based on their temperature and spectra - the famous OBFGKM system still used today. And all this on a pay scale of 25 cents per day or less ... \n"}, {"text": "Silly PUTty may be sold as a children's toy, but it can be deadly serious. It was discovered during World War II, when scientists were researching rubber substitutes for military and civilian use, and since then it's found uses in housecleaning, outer space and even physical therapy! How is Crayola Silly Putty sold?", "correct": "Inside a plastic container shaped like an egg", "options": ["In large wooden barrels", "Inside a plastic container shaped like a car tire", "In tubs the size of butter containers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInside a plastic container shaped like an egg.\n\n\tSilly Putty can be a bit bizarre to play with. It generally holds the shape it's given, but over time, it flows like a liquid. Although it bounces, it can be broken by a sharp impact. It's useful as an adhesive, too, leading to several of its high-profile uses: astronauts use it in space to hold their tools and it's quite handy for picking up lint and hair while cleaning house.Patients recovering from hand injuries or suffering from high stress levels even find it soothing and productive to squeeze balls of putty. Its inventors believed it to be a failure for several years after they first produced it in the early 1940s, since it couldn't really take the place of rubber - but then toy store owner Ruth Fallgatter, holding a sample, realized that it could be a gold mine! Seldom has a product of war brought so much joy. \n"}, {"text": "Vladimir PUTin became Russia's second president in the year 2000, but this was not his first government job. Before the fall of the Soviet Union, in what branch of the government did he work?", "correct": "The KGB", "options": ["Moscow State University", "The city government of Leningrad", "The Soviet Navy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe KGB.\n\n\tPutin, already a member of the Communist Party, joined the KGB (the Soviet Union's intelligence agency and secret police) after graduating law school in 1975. He is known to have served in Leningrad in the early 1980s and in East Germany in the late 1980s; the fall of that country and the reunification of Germany drove him back to Leningrad. His precise duties during his KGB years are unknown, but he is said to have served as a spy as well as taking action to curb political dissent.\r After the Soviet Union fell, Putin went into politics, and by 1999 Boris Yeltsin (Russia's first president) had decided he wanted Putin to succeed him. During his eight-year presidency, Russia emerged from the economic chaos of the 1990s, but Putin was criticized for his handling of the war in Chechnya, his prosecution of some successful businessmen, and his stern and autocratic reaction to domestic critics. Not one to surrender power easily, he did step down as President after his constitutionally mandated two terms ended in 2008 - but his handpicked successor, Dmitry Medvedev, immediately named him Prime Minister! Putin's story is certainly not over. \n"}, {"text": "\"I'm never gonna care about my bad rePUTation,\" this singer declares in a song that's appeared in movies (\"10 Things I Hate About You\"), television shows (\"Freaks and Geeks\"), and even video games (\"Rock Band 2\"). After all, \"it's a new generation!\" Try to identify the original performers of this 1981 release without \"living in the past\".", "correct": "Joan Jett and the Blackhearts", "options": ["Peter, Paul and Mary", "Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band", "Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoan Jett and the Blackhearts.\n\n\tJoan Jett, a Philadelphia rocker born in 1958 and backed by the trio of the Blackhearts, is better known for a single that came out the next year - \"I Love Rock N' Roll\", #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1982. But \"Bad Reputation\", released the year before, also receives frequent radio play and inspires numerous covers. In the song, Jett aggressively defends her \"bad reputation\", even accusing the listener of being out of touch for even caring about such a thing: \"You're living in the past, it's a new generation: a girl can do what she wants to do, and that's what I'm gonna do.\" \n"}, {"text": "Watching the track and field portion of the Olympics or other championships, you may observe athletes attempting the shotPUT. Which of these is the best description of this event?", "correct": "The athlete attempts to throw a heavy metal ball as far as possible.", "options": ["The athlete attempts to throw a spear-like object as far as possible.", "The athlete uses a pole to clear a high horizontal bar.", "The athlete runs a sprint with hurdles, moving \"like a shot.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe athlete attempts to throw a heavy metal ball as far as possible.\n\n\tThe \"shot\" - the heavy metal ball in question - weighs 6 kilograms (or 13.2 pounds) in men's international competition, and it must be \"put\" behind the line with a kind of pushing throw that begins at the athlete's neck. Modern shotputters choose between two main putting styles: the glide and the spin, which both involve the athlete rotating through part of a circle and applying that momentum to the motion of the shot. Good shotputters can fling that 6-kilogram shot over 20 meters; in 1990, Randy Barnes set a world record by putting the shot 23.12 meters, over 75 feet! \n"}, {"text": "On November 8, 1923, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party launched their first bid for power in the Beer Hall PUTsch. The coup attempt failed, but shaped his future acts: he wrote \"Mein Kampf\" during his jail sentence for the putsch, and the failure of force inspired him to obey the letter of the law in his rise to power during the 1930s. Where did the Beer Hall Putsch take place?", "correct": "Munich, Germany", "options": ["Berlin, Germany", "Vienna, Austria", "Dresden, Germany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMunich, Germany.\n\n\tOn the night of the Putsch, Gustav von Kahr -- the commissioner of Bavaria -- was giving a speech in the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller beer hall, addressing some 3000 businessmen and government figures. At 8:30 p.m., Hitler entered the hall at the head of 600 stormtroopers, accompanied by Rudolf Hess and Hermann G\u00f6ring, among others.Von Kahr and the other two Bavarian triumvirs (police chief Hans von Seisser and army general Otto von Lossow) were taken at gunpoint into a back room and urged to proclaim their support for the Nazi revolution. They eventually agreed, but escaped at the first opportunity and recanted their pledges.The putsch collapsed as the Nazis failed to take military barracks and failed to occupy Munich. The next morning, three thousand Nazis marched on the center of the city in a last-ditch attempt to gain control -- and were stopped by a hundred policemen. Unfortunately, despite the ignominious end of his first attempt at a power grab, Hitler was not dissuaded from his ultimate goal of dictatorial rule. \n"}, {"text": "PUT is a syllable that can't be stopped: it's even shown up on Broadway! This one-act musical, centered on a school competition, opened on Broadway in 2005 and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Musical. It's unusual in many ways, one of which is that the competitors in the contest are not just actors - a few of them are drawn from the audience every show! What is this musical, based on the play \"C-R-E-P-U-S-C-U-L-E\"?", "correct": "The 25th Annual PUTnam County Spelling Bee", "options": ["Rodney and the ComPUTer Contest", "PUT Me In, Coach", "PUTting It Together"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe 25th Annual PUTnam County Spelling Bee.\n\n\t\"C-R-E-P-U-S-C-U-L-E\" is an improvised performance (where, within certain parameters, the actors write the script spontaneously while on stage) designed by Rebecca Feldman. A performance of the work by a comedy group called The Farm inspired the musical \"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,\" which follows the trials and travails of six young teenagers participating in a spelling bee run by several adults with problems of their own.A handful of audience members, often chosen for traits like memorable names or unusual hairstyles, joins the spellers every show to shake things up a bit. With such unusual songs as \"My Friend, the Dictionary\" and \"Magic Foot,\" the musical has a lot of fun tapping into America's spelling bee subculture.\n"}, {"text": "\"This is the type of arrant pedantry up with which I will not PUT!\" This indignant line is usually attributed to Winston Churchill in an anecdote about the absurdities of inflexible grammatical rules. To what rule was he (probably apocryphally) objecting?", "correct": "Never end a sentence with a preposition.", "options": ["Never begin a sentence with \"and\" or \"but.\"", "Every sentence must include an explicit subject.", "Never split an infinitive."], "explanation": "\n\n\nNever end a sentence with a preposition.\n\n\tThe phrase \"to put up with\" is (despite that final preposition) a popular English expression meaning \"to tolerate\" -- and its idiomatic meaning is lost when the prepositions are taken out of order. The story goes that a stern (and imprudent) grammarian instructed Churchill not to end his sentences with prepositions -- and was promptly skewered by this reply, highlighting the absurd results of rigidly applying this rule to English.\r \"Never end a sentence with a preposition\" belongs to a family of somewhat controversial rules, generally enforced by secondary school teachers but routinely flouted in English both spoken and written, formal and informal.\r Thank you for joining me in this tribute to the letters PUT. I fervently hope that it has not PUT too much strain on your comPUTer, damaged anyone's rePUTation, or caused any disPUTes between you and your loved ones. \n"}]}
