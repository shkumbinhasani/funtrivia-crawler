I placed my first chip in the pot, and got my cards.  I had nothing.  I folded.\n\nWhich of these is not a word or phrase meaning \"nothing\"?", "correct": "Piddly", "options": ["Goose Egg", "Jack Squat", "Nil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPiddly.\n\n\tA piddly is actually a very small amount, but that's still more than nothing.  Nil is a term that is most often used in games such as Spades.  In Spades, if you bid nil, you estimated that you won't take any points.  A goose egg means zero, especially when you write it as 0, which looks eggish.  A goose egg can also be a bump on the head.\r Other terms for zero are zilch, bupkis, nada, zip and diddly squat. \n"}, {"text": "I placed another chip in the pot and got my cards.  To my amazement, I saw two aces in my hand, so before the other cards were placed on the table I leaped out of my seat and shoved all my chips into the pot.  \"ALL IN!\"  I yelled.

Not much I could do but either fold or bluff.  Well, me and my horrible poker face decided to bluff, so I placed 17 chips into the pot and began sweating and twitching.  Another played called, the other raised, and I folded.  I don't bluff well.\n\nWhat is another definition of \"bluff\"?", "correct": "Steep hill", "options": ["Tone of voice", "Neck fat", "Things"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteep hill.\n\n\tA bluff is a steep hill or a small cliff.  They are normally found at the edge of a river or an ocean.\r Tone of voice was the definition for gruff, like the \"Three Billy Goats' Gruff\", things is the definition of stuff, and neck fat is the scruff. \n"}, {"text": "I placed a chip into the pot to start the next hand, and I was given my two cards.  After a few more cards were dealt, I realize I had two kings.  I placed 34 more chips in the pot, bringing me down to a nice even 50.  But my pair of kings was beaten by three jacks.

I'd gotten a lot of good hands this game.  I stared at my straight in disbelief.  I had a straight!  I shoved half of my 60 chips forward, hoping someone would take the bait.

After betting my required one chip, I folded.\n\nWhat is so unique about a seven-high hand in poker?", "correct": "Lowest scoring hand possible", "options": ["7s become higher than aces, and thus a pair of sevens would win against a pair of aces", "Beats all other hands (too bad I folded without knowing it was worth something)", "Timothy fell in the well again, and Lassie has sent you a message through your cards to fish him out"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLowest scoring hand possible.\n\n\tA seven-high hand in poker is the lowest score you can get with poker.  This is when your five cards are a 7, 5, 4, 3, and 2 in different suits.  Any other hand can beat this hand.  Note that this is lower than a 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2, because that would then be a straight. \n"}, {"text": "I looked at my cards, and I had a pair of 4s.  That isn't very high, but judging by the look on the other player's face, I could tell I could win with that hand.  I put 12 chips in, which brought me back down to 50.  The other player pushed 100 chips into the pot, and I didn't want to lose all my chips, so I folded.\n\nTurns out he was bluffing.  He tricked me!  Speaking of tricks, which of these is not a trick-taking type card game?", "correct": "Blackjack", "options": ["Bridge", "Spades", "Euchre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlackjack.\n\n\tA trick-taking card game is one where you want to win hands.  For instance, in Spades, you bet how many tricks (or hands) you can win, and then you must try to win that many hands in the round.\r Blackjack is not a game that involves winning tricks, but instead involves trying to reach 21. \n"}, {"text": "I took a glance at my cards, and noticed that I had two high pairs.  I started to smile, and when it came my turn, I placed 49 chips in the pot.  The other players started to fold, but the last player matched my bet.  I grinned, knowing that I had the high hand.  I slammed my cards down and started to take the pot.  But then the other player put down his cards to reveal what looked to be nothing special.  But at a second glance, I noticed he had a flush.  I always forget about the flushes!  He took the pot instead.\n\nFlushing, Queens, New York is where Fran Fine is from on what television show?", "correct": "The Nanny", "options": ["Leave it to Beaver", "Sesame Street", "Welcome Back, Kotter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Nanny.\n\n\t\"The Nanny\", which ran from 1993 to 1999, was a show about a woman who was the nanny for a rich and single father of three.

Fran Drescher, the creator of \"The Nanny\" and also the actress who played Fran Fine, was also born in Flushing, Queens, New York. \n"}, {"text": "With just one chip left, I figured this would be my final hand.  I was dealt my cards, and I looked at them intently.  When it came my turn to bet, I placed my single chip in the pot.  The other players kept betting higher and higher until the pot was up to 500 chips; everyone was all in.  They began showing their cards to one another, and one person began to take the pile.  I said \"Not so fast.  I'm not out of this hand yet.\"  I put my cards down.  \"Royal flush, clubs.\"\n\nWhich of these words could be used for both royalty and the toilet (slang, American)?", "correct": "Throne", "options": ["Court jester", "Porcelain pot", "Sceptre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThrone.\n\n\tA throne is the seat a king or queen sits on, and it can also be used as a slang term for toilet.  Other words that could be used for both royalty and the toilet would be head, crown, and john (if the king's name was John, that is).\r A royal flush is the highest hand in poker.  But what if two people have a royal flush, each in a different suit?  In poker, suits do not matter, and the pot would be split.\r  I should point out that if this was real poker, I would not have won all the chips.  AntonLaVey put it best when he said \"The pot was built all the way to 500. Since you had only one chip, you can't win all 500 in the pot. Once you put in your chip and other players call your bet, your chip and one chip from every other player in the hand are moved to the side. That is all you can win. You are now \"all in.\" The rest of the betting is not for you to win since you have no chips to put into that pot.\"  Thanks for that information, Anton. \n"}]}
