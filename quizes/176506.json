In addition to setting many records for stolen bases, I batted over .400 three times.  Accused of being a dirty player by many, I just kept my spikes up.  I played for the same team for 22 seasons before I was traded to the Athletics for two more seasons before I retired.  I was one of the first five inductees into the Hall of Fame in 1936.  When I died in 1961 at the age of 74, only nine people showed up at my funeral.  Who am I?", "correct": "Ty Cobb", "options": ["Hoyt Wilhelm", "Joe DiMaggio", "Rogers Hornsby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTy Cobb.\n\n\tOne of the most hated players in the game, the 'Georgia Peach' played for the Tigers from 1905-1926, before moving to Philadelphia to finish his career.

In my seventh season with the Cubs, I finally won my first Cy Young after posting a 20-11 record.  From there it was on to Atlanta.  I won the Cy again in '93, '94', and '95, to make it a four-peat.  Although over the following four seasons, I posted a total of a 75-31 record, I never saw the Cy Young Award again.  In 2003, I wore the Braves uniform in my 18th season.  Who am I?", "correct": "Greg Maddux", "options": ["Fergie Jenkins", "Rollie Fingers", "Vida Blue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreg Maddux.\n\n\tThe others were also Cy Young Award winners but retired long before 2000.

I managed for 17 years, all with the same team, taking four American League Crowns and one World Series.  Taking the World Series was easy, when I had the arms of Mike Cuellar, Jim Palmer, and Dave McNally.  Who am I?", "correct": "Earl Weaver", "options": ["Greg Pinchbeck", "Cap Anson", "Billy Martin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarl Weaver.\n\n\tNone of the others managed the Orioles.  Weaver began his hunt in 1968, and was rewarded with a 2nd place American League finish.  The following season, Baltimore won the American League but lost to the 'Amazing Mets' four games to one in the World Series.  In 1970, Weaver and the Orioles took all the marbles home by defeating the Reds four games to one. 1971 was another trip to the promised land, but saw a four games to three defeat against the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Earl retired from baseball in 1986.  Throughout his career he was noted for kicking up dirt on the umpires, with his hat turned sideways. This was something that Lou Piniella inherited. \n"}, {"text": "If you wore my shoes, then you would have known that my feet hurt.  Sometimes during a game, I would play without my shoes.

Who am I?", "correct": "Joe Jackson", "options": ["Mickey Cochrane", "Goose Goslin", "Schoolboy Rowe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe Jackson.\n\n\tAll others listed, played their ball after 1920.

This was infamously known as the 'Black Sox Scandal'.  Arguably, Jackson was the greatest all-around player who has ever played the game, with more than just outstanding stats.  He died in 1951 at the age of 62 in Greenville, South Carolina. \n"}, {"text": "You did not want to be in my shoes.  I was the first player killed on the field, after being hit by a pitch in 1920.

Who am I?", "correct": "Ray Chapman", "options": ["Bill Rigney", "Ernie Lombardi", "Johnny Mize"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRay Chapman.\n\n\tThe others had not started their careers yet.

Chapman was in his seventh season of baseball, all with Cleveland.  Another black mark for baseball in 1920, as the investigation into the rigging of the 1919 World Series was in full swing. \n"}, {"text": "I was one of the most wildest pitchers in baseball.  I walked a Major League record 208 batters in one season.  However, two seasons later I won the Triple Crown in 1940.  18 seasons as an Indian, my most memorable moment was the 1948 World Series that we won, but I lost two games in the Series.

This was after 18 seasons, all with the Pirates.  This was the second relief mission he chartered in a month.  His first supply in November was taken by warlords.  Clemente wanted to escort his relief supplies personally this time.  The aircraft was said to be overweight, and thus crashed killing all the occupants.  Roberto finished his career with exactly 3000 hits, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1973. \n"}, {"text": "You didn't want my shoes.

As a player, I saw 20 seasons with a glove, 27 as a manager, with both intertwined many seasons.  I was the most prejudice person in baseball, and I didn't mind letting everyone know it.  I hated all minorities.  As a manager, I didn't even want them playing for me, no matter how good they were.  I retired from baseball in 1897 with a .333 batting average, mostly with Chicago of the National League, and also 1296 managerial wins.  Many people tried to block my induction into the Hall of Fame in 1939 but failed.

I was the first player in the history of baseball to win a Cy Young Award in both the American and National League.
