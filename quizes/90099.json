His masterpiece, 'The Miraculous Draught of Fishes', shows his remarkable ability to depict reflection and refraction in the lake water on which Christ walks.  Who was this very influential master of landscape painting?  \n", "correct": "Konrad Witz", "options": ["Caspar David Friedrich", "Claude Lorraine", "Dieric Bouts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKonrad Witz.\n\n\tWitz appeared to show the influence of Van Eyck and Robert Campin in his work, and proved capable of creating a very realistic landscape, the 'Draught' being one of the first to appear in European art. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite early Renaissance artists, he was the great French master of the 15th century.

Etienne Chevalier also loved Sorel, and her beauty is translated magnificently in Fouquet's work.

Which sculptor are we discussing here?  \n", "correct": "Nanni di Banco", "options": ["Piero di cosimo", "Michelozzo", "Pietro de Cartona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNanni di Banco.\n\n\tNanni unfortunately died young, at around 40 years of age, but did get to witness and participate in the revival of classical forms in sculpture.  His 'Quattro Coronati' (4 saints) are splendid examples of this classicism. \n"}, {"text": "Speaking of Donatello, he is credited with producing the first free-standing nude of the Renaissance.  This bronze sculpture depicted what well-known Biblical figure?  \n", "correct": "David", "options": ["Goliath", "Solomon", "Saul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid.\n\n\tDonatello's bronze David is not as imposing as Michelangelo's later masterpiece, but it can be appreciated for the very fact of its daring.  Before Donatello, no sculptor since ancient times had chanced creating such a large, free-standing sculpture for fear of drawing the ire of church authorities.  Sculptures of this sort would be considered as idols during the Middle Ages, a big no-no.  Besides this fact, the sculpture is wonderful to behold for its flawless handiwork and contrapposto presentation...now, get on over to Florence and see it for yourself! \n"}, {"text": "Filippo Brunelleschi is known to us today for his wonderful architectural work and for his treatise on scientific perspective.

He was in fact so obsessed with his painting that he seems to have forgotten the proper form of dress, giving him a slovenly appearance according to Vasari's notes.  What was the nickname for this fellow which we can translate as 'Sloppy Tom'?  \n", "correct": "Masaccio", "options": ["Giotto", "Masolino", "Cimabue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMasaccio.\n\n\tPoor Masaccio, he couldn't dress well and never had a chance to discover a personal stylist to improve his rumpled appearance...he died at 27. \n"}, {"text": "Active in the late 13th-early 14th centuries in Siena, this shadowy figure is considered by many to be the founder of the Sienese school of painting.
