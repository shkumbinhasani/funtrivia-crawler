Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "LOST"], "questions": [{"text": "Walking through the forests of the island, many of the characters were apt to hear whispering voices.  Who discovered the truth behind these whispers?", "correct": "Hurley", "options": ["Kate", "Jack", "Sayid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHurley.\n\n\tAlthough whispers had been heard on the show since early in season 1 (particularly in the Sayid-centric episode, \"Solitary\"), it took six years of the show before an answer was received.  In the sixth season episode \"Everybody Loves Hugo\", while the survivors in Jack's camp make their way across the island to meet the Man in Black, Hurley has a talk with the then-deceased Michael who explains that the whispers plaguing our castaways since early on have been the voices of the dead. These spirits were unable to let go once they died on the island and have since wandered until the moment they were able to do so.  It may be assumed that until Jack and the others reached their moments of realization in the series finale, they too would have become whispers. \n"}, {"text": "In the second season finale, Sayid, Jin, and Sun discovered the four-toed statue of a foot on the island's shores.  Who did they discover lived in this statue?", "correct": "Jacob", "options": ["Richard Alpert", "The Man in Black", "The Others"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJacob.\n\n\tFirst seen when Jin, Sayid, and Sun use Desmond's boat in \"Live Together, Die Alone\", the foot statue was a mystery until much later in the show.  After the island began to shift back and forth through time in season 5, it made very few appearances, but in the season 5 finale, \"The Incident\", it was fully-shown to be an Egyptian statue of Taweret, the Goddess of Fertility. While the builders of the statue are left unknown, it was discovered in the episode \"Ab Aeterno\" (season 6) that Richard Alpert's slave ship, the Black Rock, crashed into it during a violent storm causing it to break into many pieces. The Man in Black and Benjamin Linus entered the foot statue in \"The Incident\" and Ben killed Jacob unaware that the creature inhabiting Locke's body was doing so. \n"}, {"text": "The hatch was one mystery, but what happened inside was another.  Although the Lost castaways were warned that something bad would happen if the button weren't pressed every 108 minutes, the season 2 finale saw this event.  What inevitably happened when the button wasn't pressed?", "correct": "The hatch imploded", "options": ["The time reset anyways", "The island went back in time", "A chain reaction of explosions sunk the island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe hatch imploded.\n\n\tIn \"Orientation\", Locke and Jack watched a video given by Desmond in order to learn how to operate the hatch computer.  Essentially, every 108 minutes, the same six numbers (yes, Hurley's lottery numbers) needed to be entered into the computer or else something very bad would happen.  This mystery would be prevalent over the course of the second season and on more than one occasion, it would get down to the wire. After the seconds dwindled away, a set of red hieroglyphics would appear in their place.  In the finale, \"Live Together, Die Alone\", Locke and Desmond decide to let the time run out (despite Mr. Eko's vow to keep it running).  The hatch implodes when Desmond uses the fail-safe key (though its effects are clearly seen throughout) and it is later discovered in season 5 that the island contains a mysterious electromagnetic energy. This energy is explored in season 6 and it is the reason Jacob guards the island. \n"}, {"text": "In season 1, Sayid found a cable in the sand on the beach leading into the jungle.  To which DHARMA station did it lead?", "correct": "The Looking Glass", "options": ["The Swan", "The Flame", "The Orchid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Looking Glass.\n\n\t\"The Looking Glass\" is the only one of the DHARMA stations to be situated underwater.  Although Sayid discovered the cable in the season 1 episode, \"Solitary\", he followed it into the jungle and not the ocean.  In season 3, Charlie and Desmond followed it into the ocean to stop the signal jamming apparatus in the finale (\"Through the Looking Glass\").  After Charlie's drowning in the Looking Glass, none of the characters returned to it.\rAll-in-all, there were ten DHARMA stations on the island and one in California used to locate the island at any given time (the Lamp Post). \n"}, {"text": "\"The List\" was a matter of concern since The Others used them way back in season 1.  When the list of candidates was found in season 6, where was it?", "correct": "On the walls and roof of a cave", "options": ["Carved into a tree", "In Dogen's Temple", "In Jacob's cabin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn the walls and roof of a cave.\n\n\tBen and his people created lists and took lists from 'Jacob' starting in season 1.  Ethan and Goodwin, when sent to their respective sections of the plane, were to make lists to give to Ben.  It was later found that the lists went further back than they did.  Jacob had a list constructed for many years. When the Man in Black takes Sawyer to a cave in the season 6 episode, \"The Substitute\", the list is seen scrawled on cave walls- peoples names with numbers attached to them (those darn lucky numbers, too!).  All of these people were deemed candidates and one would need to take over as protector of the island. While Jack volunteers to do this, he is mortally wounded in battle in the series finale and Hurley becomes the ultimate protector of the island. \n"}, {"text": "In the season 4 finale, a man named Jeremy Bentham was in a coffin in Ben Linus' possession.  Who did Jeremy Bentham turn out to be?", "correct": "Locke", "options": ["Desmond", "Sayid", "Sawyer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLocke.\n\n\tThroughout season 4, flashbacks became flashforwards and viewers learned that the 'Oceanic Six' had left the island.  Locke, who was not a member of this group, ended up being killed in the time between these two events.  It turns out, when Ben pushed the frozen donkey wheel in the season 4 finale, \"There's No Place like Home\", he ended up in a completely different place in the world and he accidentally caused the island to shift through time. Locke, pushing the wheel back to normal and fixing the matter, ended up finding himself in the same place as Ben, Tunisia, in \"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\".  With the help of Widmore, who gave him a passport under the name Jeremy Bentham, Locke tried to reunite the Oceanic Six to bring them back to the island but was unsuccessful. Before Locke could commit suicide, Ben murdered him. \n"}, {"text": "Since the series premiere, the Smoke Monster has been a prevalent mystery on the island.  Which of these was not a form taken by the Smoke Monster?", "correct": "Shannon", "options": ["Alex", "Locke", "Christian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShannon.\n\n\tIt turned out that the Smoke Monster was a manifestation of evil brought from 'The Source'.  In the sixth season episode, \"Across the Sea\", Jacob accidentally killed his brother, letting him float into 'The Source' before the Smoke Monster emerged.  Jacob has since spent his time protecting the island and preventing said monster from escaping. When a person dies on the island or their body is brought to it, the Smoke Monster can shift into the likeness of that person also taking on their memories.  In \"White Rabbit\" in season 1, it was shown that the Smoke Monster had taken on the form of Christian Shepherd, Jack's father. Alex's form was taken when Ben was to be judged by the Smoke Monster in \"Dead is Dead\" and the Smoke Monster took on Locke's form (its final incarnation) after Locke's body returned to the island in season 5's episode, \"316\". \n"}, {"text": "In season 5, Hurley was in possession of a guitar case which he brought back to the island with him.  What was inside it?", "correct": "An ankh", "options": ["A guitar", "A key", "A laptop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn ankh.\n\n\tIn \"316\", Hurley brought the guitar case with him onto the Ajira flight although it wasn't until the season 5 finale, \"The Incident\" that it really made any sense.  It turns out, the case was given to him by Jacob before he boarded the flight.  The case goes back and forth through time until Hurley reaches the Temple in \"LA X\" in season 6.  When Dogen opens it, a large ankh is in the place of a guitar. Breaking this open, he finds another of Jacob's lists, this one featuring the names of Kate, Sawyer, Jack, Hurley, and Sayid.  Because to this, they decide to heal Sayid in their healing waters...but it's too late. \n"}, {"text": "Although some were seen in season 1, the polar bears on the island didn't get an explanation until season 3.  Who brought them to the island?", "correct": "The DHARMA Initiative", "options": ["Charles Widmore", "Oceanic Flight 815", "Jacob"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe DHARMA Initiative.\n\n\tThe Polar Bears were brought to the island by the DHARMA Initiative in order to carry out experiments on other creatures in regard to the island's unique properties.  In season 3, Kate and Sawyer are placed into polar bear cages during their imprisonment on Hydra Island.  The same cages reappear in later episodes. Polar bears were really only a major mystery in season 1 when Sawyer shot and killed one very early in the series and when Walt was attacked by one in the forest.  Although the mystery was solved in the season 3 premiere, \"A Tale of Two Cities\", a polar bear skeleton can be seen in Tunisia, evidently the result of an experiment with the frozen donkey wheel. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout season 6, Flash-sideways storylines were an important mystery to the show.  What explanation was given for this parallel world?", "correct": "The Flash-sideways world facilitated a reunion between the characters in order to prepare to 'move on'", "options": ["The Flash-sideways world was an alternate reality that allowed them to cross back into the real storyline to save the island", "The Flash-sideways world was used to reset the timeline as a result of Jacob's death", "The Flash-sideways world was the result of the Incident- it reset the order of things as intended by Faraday's plans and stopped Oceanic from crashing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Flash-sideways world facilitated a reunion between the characters in order to prepare to 'move on'.\n\n\tBeginning in the sixth season's premiere, \"LA X\", the Flash-sideways began with Oceanic Flight 815 taking minor turbulence as it passed over the island (now nestled at the bottom of the sea).  While the characters were unable to set off Jughead in season 5's finale, \"The Incident\", they had to assume that something had happened. This red herring was proven false by the finale.  The Flash-sideways was used to reunite the characters in a world off the island.  Upon 'awakening', the characters recalled the events of their lives in the real timeline in order to come to terms with themselves and 'move on' with those who were important to them. The last person to do this is Jack who discovers (when he sees his father alive) that the Flash-sideways events never actually occurred (including his son).  Now that he and the others understand, they can all come to terms and carry on to what occurs next.  Inevitably, what happened did happen and eventually, everyone would pass away.  But since all of them lived together, it ensured that none of them would die alone. \n"}]}
