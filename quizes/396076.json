Directed by The Vicious Brothers (one in many duo horror director teams emerging in the 2010s), the movie was filmed in British Columbia at an actual mental health facility in Coquitlam.  Presented as a found footage video, the movie was meant to mimic footage from a paranormal investigation show, placing the hosts and filmmakers into an actual haunted environment instead.  The footage, found later, was all that remained of their final episode. \n"}, {"text": "David Caruso starred in what 2001 indie horror film about an asbestos clean-up crew in an abandoned mental asylum?", "correct": "Session 9", "options": ["Gothika", "A Cure For Wellness", "The Ward"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSession 9.\n\n\t\"Session 9\" was a bit of a sleeper classic in the early 2000s because with the remake push of the late 1990s and the move into J-horror inspiration, mainstream, original films in the genre were a bit hard to come by.  \"Session 9\" never saw great mainstream success but it was lauded in the industry for its psychological bent.  The film starred David Caruso as an asbestos worker taking his team into Danvers State Hospital, an actual asylum in Colorado, to remove it.  As their work pushed them deeper into what really went on in the hospital, some spooky things started happening. \n"}, {"text": "Dark Castle released which of these horror remakes in 1999 (starring Taye Diggs and Ali Larter), setting it in the Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane?", "correct": "The House on Haunted Hill", "options": ["Thirteen Ghosts", "The Haunting", "House of Wax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe House on Haunted Hill.\n\n\t\"The House on Haunted Hill\", based on William Castle's 1959 film of the same name, took the general idea from the original-- to have a haunted house and an eccentric millionaire and hope people survived the night to collect a cash prize-- and modernized it a bit, giving the story a bit of extra flair that seemed to be a bit more stylized at the turn of the century.  It was ultimately the first in many horror remakes done by Dark Castle Entertainment and director William Malone would go on to make the 2003 mega-flop \"FearDotCom\". \n"}, {"text": "Pushed to the limit by the ghosts of the Overlook Hotel, Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance goes mad enough to try to kill his isolated family in what Stephen King adaptation?", "correct": "The Shining", "options": ["Misery", "The Mist", "The Green Mile"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Shining.\n\n\tWhile Stephen King himself panned Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film for being too far removed from his 1977 novel, \"The Shining\", it has since gone down as one of the most well-received horror films of its era, depicting Jack Torrance as a man consumed by his isolation and circumstances (and, perhaps, prodded by the ghosts of the Overlook Hotel) as he, his wife, and his son looked after a lodge in the Colorado Rockies for the winter.  Interestingly, Nicholson also played crazy in 1975 (in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"), winning an Oscar for his role. \n"}, {"text": "In what 1990 film does a Vietnam war veteran deal with hallucinations brought on by a drug that lead him to question his reality?", "correct": "Jacob's Ladder", "options": ["Candyman", "Stay", "The Cell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJacob's Ladder.\n\n\tAnother cult classic, the 1990 movie \"Jacob's Ladder\" became the inspiration for many psychological films and, interestingly, video games as the years went on because of its narrative choices.  In this movie, Vietnam war veteran Jacob Singer, played by Tim Robbins, suffers from horrifying hallucinations that he can't explain away.  Whether or not it's PTSD or something else entirely isn't really explained until closer to the end of the film when the truth comes out.  Director Adrian Lyne was also known for filming both \"Flashdance\" and \"Fatal Attraction\" in the 1980s. \n"}, {"text": "In what 2010 film remake does a virus known as 'Trixie' infect the town of Ogden Marsh, turning its citizens into zombie-like murderers?", "correct": "The Crazies", "options": ["Dawn of the Dead", "28 Weeks Later", "Daybreakers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Crazies.\n\n\t\"The Crazies\" was based on George A. Romero's 1973 movie of the same name and featured a bit of an anti-zombie plague to counter the walkers of \"Night of the Living Dead\", Romero's earliest film.  In this movie, Ogden Marsh is accidentally hit with a biological nightmare which spikes the water supply and sends many of its citizens into a rage, causing them to psychopathically kill those around them.  The remake starred Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell and was generally well-received. \n"}, {"text": "Insane killer Harry Warden kills many celebrating a holiday in a small mining town in what 1981 slasher film?", "correct": "My Bloody Valentine", "options": ["Silent Night, Deadly Night", "Trick or Treat", "Happy Birthday to Me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Bloody Valentine.\n\n\tThe kills in this Valentine's Day themed movie from Canada in the 1980s don't limit themselves to just teenage bodies either-- \"My Bloody Valentine\" is the relentless story of a town terrorized by a miner known as Harry Warden who has returned to put an end to the Valentine's Day dance that has been banned in the town for two decades.  What follows is a bloodbath (or a massacre, really) that stretches from the town of Valentine Bluff deep into the nearby mines.  The movie became a bit of a horror classic in the slasher subgenre and was remade (pretty faithfully) in 2009 in 3D. \n"}, {"text": "What famous 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film ends with a killer in a psychiatric ward?", "correct": "Psycho", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPsycho.\n\n\t\"Psycho\" was, of course, the classic featuring Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates and was based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel (which, in turn, was based on the serial killer career of Ed Gein).  The movie has since become horror legend, notable for Hitchcock's filmmaking and the classic story of a man gone crazy in the most mundane of locations.  The movie went on to inspire the TV show \"Bates Motel\" which, similarly, has received great acclaim for the portrayal of Bates' gradual mental degradation (he was played by Freddie Highmore). \n"}, {"text": "Set in a mental hospital, what series' second film revisits Kirsty and the Lament Configuration?", "correct": "Hellraiser", "options": ["Friday the 13th", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "The Evil Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHellraiser.\n\n\tAfter the graphic events of the first \"Hellraiser\" movie, \"Hellbound: Hellraiser II\" (1988) brings Kirsty back into the world of the Cenobites by seeing her admit herself to a psych ward to help her overcome the maddening events that occurred (I mean, her family was basically ripped asunder by Cenobites from Hell).  Everything comes back full force in the sequel as the Lament Configuration puzzlebox is reopened and Kirsty is forced to trudge through Hell to save herself. There would inevitably be many, many more films in the \"Hellraiser\" series, many of which were worse than Hell itself and, likely, designed to make the viewer go insane. \n"}, {"text": "Set in Glenville Sanatorium, \"Bloody Beginnings\" (2011) was the subtitle for the fourth film (and prequel) in what film series about deranged cannibals?", "correct": "Wrong Turn", "options": ["The Hills Have Eyes", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Wolf Creek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWrong Turn.\n\n\tWhile the characters of 'Wrong Turn\" may not have been insane (cannibalism is alright, right?), there was certainly a bit of bedlam throughout the series as, most usually, lost or trapped teens/college kids entered the West Virginia woods and never came out, mainly because they were torn apart by backwoods mutants. \"Bloody Beginnings\", set shortly before Eliza Dushku and Desmond Harrington entered the woods in the first \"Wrong Turn\", trapped a group of nine (NINE!) university students in an asylum where they had to spend the night, ride out a horrible snowstorm, and survive the cannibals therein. \n"}]}
