{"id": "160348", "name": "Gulliver's Travels (Part 1) Quiz | Authors | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors Q-S", " Jonathan Swift"], "questions": [{"text": "In order to begin, we must know the given name of Mr. Gulliver, with whom we shall be traveling.  By what Christian name does Gulliver go?  ", "correct": "Lemuel", "options": ["Kirby", "Bertram", "Aloysius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLemuel.\n\n\tLemuel was raised at Nottinghamshire, the third of five sons.  The book 'Gulliver's Travels', by Jonathan Swift, is broken down into four sections of Lemuel Gulliver's travel memoirs.  The memoirs are given the title 'Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World'. \n"}, {"text": "What is Gulliver's initial occupation as he begins his travels onboard a ship captained by a certain Mr. Powell?  ", "correct": "Surgeon", "options": ["Navigator", "Cartographer", "Cook"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSurgeon.\n\n\tLemuel Gulliver was trained in the arts of medicine under the keen eye of Dr. James Bates in London.  After four years of study under Bates, Gulliver went on to study the art of navigation and some mathematics, at least those parts of the discipline that pertain to sea travel.  Gulliver serves as ship's surgeon aboard several ships, including those on which he travels to some of the odd lands he discovers.  Later, he becomes a ship's captain. \n"}, {"text": "Upon which ship did Gulliver sail aboard from Bristol on May 4th, 1699, to begin the first of his genuine adventures?  ", "correct": "Antelope", "options": ["Pegasus", "Discovery", "Speedwell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAntelope.\n\n\tThe Antelope was not the first ship upon which Gulliver sailed, this would be the Swallow.  The Antelope is important, however, as this is the ship upon which he sails towards his first adventure in Lilliput. \n"}, {"text": "Gulliver's ship meets misfortune when it strikes some rocks protruding from the sea.  The ship is lost, and Gulliver finds himself aboard a lifeboat with several fellow sailors.  After the lifeboat capsizes, Gulliver somehow makes it ashore an island.  Later he would find that he has landed on Lilliput, which, according to the map included, appears to be located in which ocean?  ", "correct": "Indian", "options": ["Pacific", "Arctic", "Atlantic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndian.\n\n\tLilliput is located southwest of Sumatra and well west of Van Diemen's Land (later to be called Tasmania).  Hence we can conclude that he is somewhere within the south part of the Indian Ocean. \n"}, {"text": "Awakened from his sleep, after having passed out from exhaustion, Gulliver finds himself tied down by many very thin ropes.  Surrounding him are numerous tiny 'human creatures not six inches high', as Gulliver observes.  The chief among these miniscule folk goes by what title?  ", "correct": "Hurgo", "options": ["Degul", "Tolgo", "Hekinah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHurgo.\n\n\tAt this point Gulliver obviously cannot understand the Lilliputian tongue, but he is able to make out several oft repeated words.  Gulliver also ascertains that the man called the 'Hurgo' must be chief, and motions to him that he is hungry and thirsty.  The king orders a great amount of food (for that's what it takes to feed such a large creature!) and liquor for Gulliver's consumption. \n"}, {"text": "Not having a motive device large enough to transport Gulliver to the capital city, the king orders Gulliver's confining ropes to be untied, allowing him to walk.   ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe king, being the ingenious man that he is, orders the creation of a massive cart (at least massive on a Lilliputian scale) upon which Gulliver could be transported.  It requires the strength of fifteen hundred Lilliputian horses to move Gulliver's body the half mile that is required to reach the capital city! \n"}, {"text": "Gulliver finds himself in the confines of his new abode, an ancient Lilliputian temple, in which he can live quite comfortably.  Standing in front of the temple, he observes with great amusement the surrounding countryside.  Approximately how tall are the tallest trees, according to Gulliver?  ", "correct": "Seven feet high", "options": ["Six inches high", "A thousand feet high", "Two and a half feet high"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven feet high.\n\n\tNaturally, proportions are confusing here, as it must be made clear that everything upon Lilliput is smaller than usual, even the plant life and inanimate objects.  Hence, the tallest trees, redwoods perhaps, are only just slightly taller than Gulliver himself! \n"}, {"text": "What gesture does Gulliver make to the Lilliputians, ingratiating him to the tiny people?  ", "correct": "He spares the lives of several prisoners delivered into his hands", "options": ["He helps remove a large rock that the Lilliputians have been unable to budge", "He saves the life of a princess who slips and falls from a tree", "He provides the Lilliputians with a device for making fire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe spares the lives of several prisoners delivered into his hands.\n\n\tWhile Gulliver is being guarded, several impudent Lilliputians fire arrows at him, one narrowly missing his eye.  The miscreants are delivered into Gulliver's hands, and he initially makes a gesture as if he means to consume them, but then he cuts their bonds and lets them go.  His mercy suggests to the Lilliputians that Gulliver is a civilized giant. \n"}, {"text": "The Lilliputians call Gulliver by the term 'Quinbus Flestrin'.  What is Gulliver's translation for this Lilliputian term?  ", "correct": "Great Man Mountain", "options": ["Oversized Human Being", "Personage of Extraordinary Bulk", "1,000 Mile-high Person"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreat Man Mountain.\n\n\tGulliver becomes adept at speaking the language of Lilliput, as he is a natural with languages, already having the ability to speak several European varieties (including Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and German). \n"}, {"text": "The King orders that Gulliver's person be searched, and that all items he carries upon his person be catalogued.  This provides for much amusement, as the descriptions of each item are given in Lilliputian terms.  The two men searching Gulliver conclude, for example, that which of Gulliver's items must be 'the god that he worships'?  ", "correct": "A watch", "options": ["A scroll of paper", "A comb", "A pocket pistol"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA watch.\n\n\tThey conclude that Gulliver's watch must be a god because 'he seldom did any thing without consulting it', 'he called it his oracle', and he 'said it pointed out the time for every action in his life.'  The watch is described thusly: 'a globe, half silver, and half of some transparent metal: for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them, till we found our fingers stopped by that lucid substance.  He put this engine to our ears, which made an incessant noise like that of a water-mill'.  All of his other personal items are described with similar, amusing detail. \n"}, {"text": "After a period of time, Gulliver desires to be released from his confines.  The King agrees but only under a certain number of conditions.  Which of these is not, in essence, one of the conditions?  ", "correct": "He must help produce the food and liquid that he will use for personal consumption", "options": ["He must make warning before entering into the metropolis, so the population can confine themselves to their quarters", "He must aide Lilliput against its enemy by helping to destroy the enemy's fleet", "He must not trample upon any citizens, their horses or their carriages"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe must help produce the food and liquid that he will use for personal consumption.\n\n\tNot surprisingly, the Lilliputians hope to use Gulliver in their war against their hated enemy.  This and a few other physical tasks are all that is required of Gulliver, aside from his being circumspect while stomping around the land. \n"}, {"text": "The great metropolis of Lilliput, within which the emperor's majestic palace may be found, is called...?  ", "correct": "Mildendo", "options": ["Flappurta", "Surijul", "Hamaran"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMildendo.\n\n\tGulliver finds the city to be exactly square, bounded by a wall of which each side is about 500 foot long.  The emperor's palace exists in the center of the city.  The palace is bounded by 40 foot walls that are two feet high.  Gulliver is able to see inside the royal palace, but doesn't make a description of his observances, saving that for a great work he plans in the future, fully explaining the history, people and other such topics regarding Lilliput. \n"}, {"text": "Gulliver learns from one of the king's secretaries that all is not well in Lilliput.  It seems that Lilliput has an enemy that resides upon a nearby island.  What is this island called?  ", "correct": "Blefuscu", "options": ["Lustrog", "Brundecral", "Tramecksan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlefuscu.\n\n\tBlefuscu is just to the northeast of Lilliput.  The unresolved war between the two empires has lasted for years and years.  The absurd reason behind the war will be covered in the next question... \n"}, {"text": "What is the ridiculous reason behind the war in which Lilliput is currently engaged, and behind the factionalism within the imperial court?  ", "correct": "Disagreement on how to break open an egg", "options": ["Dispute about the nature of yawning", "Misunderstanding about how a letter of the alphabet is written", "Controversy over whether to part a man's hair on the left or right"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDisagreement on how to break open an egg.\n\n\tThe disputants on Lilliput over this controversy, which involves whether to break an egg at the big or little end, are characterized by the length of heels they wear on their shoes.  Blefuscu interceded in the dispute a number of years in the past, mostly by egging on the heretical 'big-enders'. \n"}, {"text": "Gulliver is able to end the war between Lilliput and its rival through a brilliant strategem.  He steals the enemy's entire navy through subterfuge, thereby disabling them from attacking Lilliput.  What body part(s) is Gulliver's one physical concern while pulling off this marvelous feat?  ", "correct": "His eyes & eyes & eye & his eye", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis eyes & eyes & eye & his eye.\n\n\tGulliver protects his eyes by way of his spectacles, which he has hidden in a secret pocket in his trousers.  The enemy's spears and arrows merely bounce off these glasses, making him essentially invulnerable.  Thank you for trying this quiz.  If you enjoyed it, why not try the others that follow? \n"}]}
