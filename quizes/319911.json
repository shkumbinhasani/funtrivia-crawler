The song is from the album of the same name.  \"Poison\" by Bell Biv DeVoe is the first song the Acafellas played in a gig.  Neither was released as a single on \"Glee: Volume 1\".\r\"This is How We Do It\" appears in the episode when the guys realize that they may have something going with the hip-hop acapella thing.  Will, Ken, Henri, and Howard all meet up at Will's place (without Sandy as he's too creepy to be part of the group) to sing together.  Terri makes them stop saying that if she doesn't sleep she could miscarry. \n"}, {"text": "Duffy's \"Mercy\" was the song choice for which of these performances in \"Acafellas\"?", "correct": "Vocal Adrenaline's musical number", "options": ["Quinn and Finn's duet", "Tina's debut song", "Terri and Will's duet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVocal Adrenaline's musical number.\n\n\t\"Mercy\" is the first of two large musical numbers in the episode with excessive choreography.  When the New Direction Glee kids go to Vocal Adrenaline's coach, Dakota Stanley, for help, they watch Vocal Adrenaline perform this song on stage.  Although the number is essentially flawless, Stanley forces the kids off stage and departs.\r\"Mercy\", originally released by Duffy on her \"Rockferry\" album as the second single in 2008, was nominated for a Grammy Award.  Although it never cracked the top 10 on any of the four American Billboard charts it appeared on, it hit #1 on the UK Singles chart.  \"Mercy\" was released on \"Glee: Volume 1\" but failed to chart. \n"}, {"text": "\"Bust the Windows\" is the first solo performance by which character on the show in \"Acafellas\"?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Kurt", "Artie", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tThe only single (other than \"Mercy\") to be released on \"Glee: Volume 1\", \"Bust the Windows\" was originally released by Jazmine Sullivan in 2008.  The album it appeared on, \"Fearless\", was nominated for a Grammy and the single appeared on three Billboard charts hitting #4 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.  The \"Glee\" version didn't make the Billboard chart.\rThe performance of the song was spurred by Kurt lying to Mercedes saying that he actually loves Rachel (though he later admits he's gay).  Mercedes, now with a broken heart, breaks his windshield by throwing a rock through it at a fundraising car wash created by New Directions to hire Dakota Stanley.  The Cheerios (who Sue allowed to help to plot the downfall of New Directions) dance in the background. \n"}, {"text": "The final song heard in \"Acafellas\" is \"I Wanna Sex You Up\".  Where was it performed?", "correct": "On stage", "options": ["Over the radio", "In the Glee Club classroom", "At Will's house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn stage.\n\n\tDuring the Acafellas' final performance, Will, Finn, Puck, Ken, and Sandy hit the stage at a PTA assembly in order to sing and dance to Color Me Badd's \"I Wanna Sex You Up\" which, surprisingly, goes over well.  After the show, the Acafellas disband and everything goes back to 'somewhat normal' for Glee Club.  Sandy also gets a restraining order from Josh Grobin.\r\"I Wanna Sex You Up\" appeared on three Billboard charts reaching #1 on two of them and #2 on the other.  Color Me Badd struck gold with this song in 1991 and followed it with another popular single, \"I Adore Mi Amor\", shortly after.  \"I Wanna Sex You Up\" was not released on \"Glee: Volume 1\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters does not dance to \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\" during the show's fourth episode, \"Preggers\"?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Kurt", "Tina", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tBeyonce's hit single, \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\" appears numerous times in the episode starting with a reenactment of the music video with Kurt, Tina, and Brittany in Kurt's bedroom and culminating to a large-scale dance with the school football team in which Puck, Finn, Mike Chang, and Matt Rutherford (all members of New Directions) and others join in.  As a result, the football team wins their game.\rBeyonce's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\" has gone three times Platinum in the United States and became one of 2009's most popular singles appearing as #1 on three different Billboard charts (and #2 on another).  From her album \"I Am...Sasha Fierce\", the well-known music video for the single has become a sensation on the internet since its debut.  Since none of the characters in the show sing their own version of the song, it never appears as a single from the \"Glee\" soundtracks. \n"}, {"text": "Which character got their first solo of the show in the \"Preggers\" episode with the song \"Tonight\"?", "correct": "Tina", "options": ["Artie", "Quinn", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTina.\n\n\tOriginally from the 1956 musical \"West Side story\", \"Preggers\" sees Tina perform the Broadway classic \"Tonight\" as a solo.  As a result, Rachel decides to leave Glee Club since she feels she deserved it more as she's the best one in New Directions.  Nonetheless, Will makes Tina take the role, something she is able to do just fine, but she backs out from the solo in order to try to keep the team together.\r\"Tonight\" was never released as a single or on \"Glee: Vol. 1\".  The only song to do so from this episode was \"Taking Chances\", the cover of a Celine Dion song by Rachel. \n"}, {"text": "\"Maybe This Time\" was performed by both April and Rachel in \"The Rhodes Not Taken\".  What musical is it from?", "correct": "Cabaret", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCabaret.\n\n\t\"Maybe This Time\" was written into the film version of the Broadway musical \"Cabaret\".  Upon hearing that Rachel, their star, has left Glee Club to join a production of the musical headed by Sandy and Sue, April sings the song (at the same time Rachel practices it on stage) to persuade them to let her join.  The song convinces the group that April may be the one to head their vocals in the wake of Rachel's departure.\rThe original version of \"Maybe This Time\" was performed by Liza Minnelli.  The \"Glee\" version appeared on \"Glee: Vol. 1\" as a single though it barely cracked the Billboard Top 100 (reaching 88). \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Rhodes Not Taken\", April performs a duet of Heart's \"Alone\" with which character?", "correct": "Will", "options": ["Finn", "Puck", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill.\n\n\tWhile \"Alone\" was a charting single from the \"Glee: Vol. 1\" pack, it's often overlooked.  One of many songs in this episode performed with Kristen Chenoweth, \"Alone\" was originally performed by rock band Heart in 1987, a power ballad and the band's most popular #1 hit (though they had others).\rIn \"The Rhodes Not Taken\", April and Will perform this song together at a bowling alley with a karaoke machine.  This occurs after Will tells April that he joined Glee Club because of her though they never performed together.  She decides to amend this with their duet. \n"}, {"text": "Which Carrie Underwood single was performed by New Directions in \"The Rhodes Not Taken\"?", "correct": "\"Last Name\"", "options": ["\"Cowboy Casanova\"", "\"Before He Cheats\"", "\"Some Hearts\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Last Name\".\n\n\tResponsible for Carrie Underwood's third Grammy in the 'Best Female Country Performance' category, \"Last Name\" was one of the songwriter's most well-received singles (from her second album, \"Carnival Ride\").  Underwood's version appeared on four American charts and two in Canada before obtaining a Billboard #1 spot in 2008.\rIn \"The Rhodes Not Taken\", New Directions (with April Rhodes) perform the song at their Invitational night without Rachel, who has yet to return to Glee after her decision to remain in \"Cabaret\".  After the performance, Will asks April to leave the group and she agrees that she needs to find a new dream.\rWhile released as a single, \"Last Name\" never appeared on the \"Glee: Vol. 1\" CD and failed to chart in the States. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these New direction members plays the guitar in \"The Rhodes Not Taken\" during their rendition of \"Somebody to Love\"?", "correct": "Artie", "options": ["Kurt", "Finn", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArtie.\n\n\tFor their final Invitational performance, New Directions uses Queen's \"Somebody to Love\", a song from their \"A Day at the Races\" album that was released in 1976 (and appeared on charts worldwide).  Though not their most popular single, the song is one of their most famous.  The single appeared on \"Glee: Vol. 1\" (and became one of its highest-charting singles, reaching #28 on the Billboard charts) and was possibly the Glee Club's most powerful performance since \"Don't Stop Believin'\" in the first episode.\rThis number is performed after Rachel's return to the Glee Club and it's the first to contain all of the original members of New Directions. \n"}]}
