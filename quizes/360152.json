The longest of these, at 980 miles is with Malawi to the northwest. Also to the northwest is the 260-mile border with Zambia. To the west is Zimbabwe, with whom Mozambique has a shared border of 770 miles. To the southwest are South Africa (a 306-mile border) and Swaziland (65 miles). To the north is Tanzania and a shared border stretching 470 miles. \n"}, {"text": "With a land area of almost 310,000 square miles, Mozambique is marginally smaller than Pakistan and half the size of Iran. If Mozambique were a U.S. state, where would it rank in terms of size? ", "correct": "Second, smaller only than Alaska", "options": ["Third, between California and Texas", "Larger than any U.S. state", "Fifth, behind Alaska, California, Texas and Montana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSecond, smaller only than Alaska.\n\n\tWith an area of just over 660,000 sq miles, Alaska is more than twice the size of Mozambique. The second-largest U.S. state, Texas, covers just under 270,000 miles, so Mozambique would therefore rank as the second largest state, behind only Alaska. California, the third-largest state, has a land area of just below 156,000 square miles, so it would fit almost twice into Mozambique. The smallest U.S. state, Rhode Island, area 1,550 sq miles, would remarkably fit into Mozambique almost 200 times. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not a regular natural hazard for the people of Mozambique?", "correct": "Earthquakes", "options": ["Extensive Flooding", "Severe Drought", "Devastating Cyclones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarthquakes.\n\n\tMozambique has a sub-tropical climate of two extreme seasons. During the dry season (April to September), droughts are the norm rather than the exception. The wet season often brings cyclones in from the Indian Ocean, and an annual rainfall as high as 35 inches in the coastal regions frequently leads to flooding, particularly in the central and southern provinces. Earthquakes, though, are not something that Mozambique regularly experiences. \n"}, {"text": "The Mozambique Channel separates Mozambique from which other country?", "correct": "Madagascar", "options": ["Comoros Islands", "Tanzania", "The Seychelles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadagascar.\n\n\tThe 1,000-mile long Mozambique Channel separates Mozambique from Madagascar.
