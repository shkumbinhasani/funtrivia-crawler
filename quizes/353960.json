What was the theme of their residence?", "correct": "A Tyra Banks magazine", "options": ["Mod style", "Models of the past", "Japanese influences"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Tyra Banks magazine.\n\n\tThis season, thirteen girls were selected from a pool of just over thirty in a casting session in Hollywood, California.  After initial cuts, the girls performed a nude shot on a city rooftop.  After Tyra announced the final thirteen they were taken to a runway and asked to walk with a rock 'n' roll style for the designers of Elmer Ave. (though they had to feminize mens' clothing).  Melrose won this task.\rWhen the girls took their stretch Escalade to their new digs in Hollywood, they moved in and argued over the eleven beds.  For their first shoot, the girls had to reenact and dramatize model stereotypes while Melrose experienced her reward (being a diva for a day, getting a massage and an assistant).  Although her poor attitude in the shoot made her a struggle to work with, she was saved over an uninspiring Christian who was sent packing. \n"}, {"text": "When the girls had a Cover Girl-themed challenge in week two, they met with which former spokesperson?", "correct": "Queen Latifah", "options": ["Brandy", "Drew Barrymore", "Ellen Degeneres"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen Latifah.\n\n\tWeek two was makeover week for the final twelve.  After breakfast with the two Jays, the girls returned home to find Tyra and a salon set up in their living room; all of them received new hair (some crazier than others).  After this, the dozen tested their knowledge of Cover Girl makeup with Jay and ended up meeting Queen Latifah, creator of the Queen line of cosmetics.  Ultimately, Eugenia won the challenge and had a photo shoot for the Cover Girl website.\rThe photo shoot this week involved hair, specifically elaborate styles.  Once the girls wigged out they met with the judges and Megan went home-- they thought she couldn't upstage her hair. \n"}, {"text": "Who was eliminated in week three after refusing to participate in the shoot (due to illness)?", "correct": "Monique", "options": ["Megg", "Eugenia", "AJ"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonique.\n\n\tDuring week 3, the girls took baby steps in learning how to walk runway with J. Alexander before a walk-off challenge won by AJ.  She, CariDee, and Megg went to Texas to star in a fashion show with other former \"Next Top Model\" contestants.  The girls had tough times back at their mansion when Monique tormented the others and made herself an enemy, but karma paid back when she was unable to attend the next shoot, a runway shoot atop wobbling planks. When the girls stood in front of the panel, Monique was sent home because she didn't participate and because her past photos were not strong enough to keep her in the competition. \n"}, {"text": "During the circus-themed shoot from week four, Amanda and Michelle were asked to portray Siamese twins.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSince they lent themselves so well to the concept (being twins), Amanda and Michelle ended up following through in this circus-themed shoot in which each girl had to portray a different freak show figure.  Week four was also punctuated by a challenge involving posing on pedestals for prolonged periods of time.  Megg was eliminated after a poor photo.\rIn week five, the girls had to practice interview skills and battled on the red carpet to have the best interview with former \"Top Model\" judge Janice Dickinson.  Melrose won the task and got to work for \"Entertainment Tonight\" for a night on a red carpet.  The shoot this week involved dressing up and posing as celebrity couples; AJ's mediocre Jennifer Lopez/Marc Anthony combination sent her packing. \n"}, {"text": "During the romance photo shoots in week six, the girls were asked to pose with what famous male model?", "correct": "Fabio", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFabio.\n\n\tWeek six was a time to learn how to be sexy and not sleazy.  The girls met Dita Von Teese for an impromptu burlesque lesson and Melrose won a spread with \"Seventeen\" magazine after performing during an editorial dinner party.  After an anger-themed photo shoot headed by Tyra, the girls were asked to pose with none other than Fabio, male model extraordinaire, for their very own harlequin romance book covers.  Brooke, the youngest competitor, was eliminated because the judges didn't think she was cut out for 'top modelling'. \n"}, {"text": "In week seven, the competitors needed to learn how to take action shots.  Michelle won the photo challenge, but who won the actual reward (a ten thousand dollar shopping spree)?", "correct": "Melrose", "options": ["CariDee", "Amanda", "Michelle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMelrose.\n\n\tFor week seven, the girls got action shot tips from pro volleyball player Gabrielle Reece before going to a raceway and taking the reins on some shots with famous race car driver Stanton Barrett.  Michelle won the challenge and brought three girls along for the chance to have a $10,000 shopping spree.  The catch was that only one of the four girls would win all of the clothes collected in thirty seconds. Melrose ended up winning this.  For the photo shoot this week, the girls had to promote Cover Girl True Blend Whipped while posing in a skydiver-training wind tunnel.  Anchal was accused of lacking grace and for having a lack of motivation so she was eliminated. \n"}, {"text": "In week eight, the girls flew to their international destination in which country?", "correct": "Spain", "options": ["France", "Italy", "England"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpain.\n\n\tMeeting with an acting coach in week eight, the girls were taught how to evoke their emotions and look good on film.

Soon after, the girls were told that they would be flying to their international destination, Barcelona. Here, after meeting with male models, the girls were told to memorize a script in Catalan and head to their shoot, a commercial for Secret Deodorant filmed with the girls speaking another language.  Although CariDee's Secret commercial was considered one of the worst, Jaeda was sent home during her fourth instance in the bottom two. \n"}, {"text": "Neither of the Babin twins made it to the end of the cycle.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDuring week nine, both Michelle and Amanda were at risk of elimination in front of the judges and Michelle was sent home for her uncertainty; she wasn't sure if she wanted to be a model.  This week, the girls went on a series of go-sees in Barcelona and Melrose won the competition bringing CariDee on a dinner date with a personal chef. The photo shoot this week involved the girls playing matadors in a stadium with a live bull.  There was some drama before the shot when CariDee playfully insulted photographer and judge Nigel Barker; this caused the judges to wonder if CariDee was too much of a loose cannon. \n"}, {"text": "The photo shoot for the final four involved posing in water with which of these?", "correct": "Partners", "options": ["Fish", "Inner tubes", "No clothes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPartners.\n\n\tIn week ten, the girls ended up learning how to flamenco dance and work with partners; the goal of the week was to see if the girls were compatible with other people on the runway and in photos.  Eugena won her first challenge (and an outfit from Custo Barcelona).  The shoot this week was coached by Tyra; the girls worked with each other in photos taken while they were floating on their backs in a freezing cold pool.  The girls were asked to look like water nymphs.  Although all of the girls were successful during the shoot, the judges sent Amanda home leaving only three. \n"}, {"text": "Who won cycle seven of \"America's Next Top Model\"?", "correct": "CariDee & CariDee English", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCariDee & CariDee English.\n\n\tThe final three girls gathered for a shoot for Cover Girl Lip Shine and were told that their photos and commercial would be used for an international campaign should they win the show.  At the judging panel, Eugena was sent home leaving only CariDee and Melrose to compete in a final fashion show in Barcelona.  The final two had their photo shoot for \"Seventeen\" magazine before joining an avant-garde show where they had to dress up as crazed brides on the runway.  Although Melrose's runway presence was praised, the judges enjoyed CariDee's track record more and awarded her the title and prizes.\rBecoming the seventh winner of \"America's Next Top Model\", CariDee won a contract with Elite Model Management, $100,000 and a contract with Cover Girl, and the spread she shot in \"Seventeen\" magazine.  After the show, CariDee continued modeling, eventually becoming the host of the reality TV show \"Pretty Wicked\". \n"}]}
