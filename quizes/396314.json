{"id": "396314", "name": "Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, or Pokemon? Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture", "Nintendo Games Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Which series of games uses TMs and HMs?", "correct": "Pokemon", "options": ["Zelda", "Mario", "Donkey Kong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPokemon.\n\n\tTMs and HMs, abbreviations of Technical Machines and Hidden Machines, are used in the \"Pokemon\" universe to give your Pokemon special abilities to be used in battle.  HMs, given to you under rare circumstances, also had applications outside of battle that made more sense for utility depending on the situation (like Cut, Fly, and Surf).  In the original \"Pokemon\" game there were fifty TMs and only five HMs, but each successive game added more to the list to increase Pokemon viability. \n"}, {"text": "Which series of games features Dodongos as foes?", "correct": "Zelda", "options": ["Pokemon", "Mario", "Donkey Kong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZelda.\n\n\tSeen as far back as the games on the CD-I, Dodongos made major appearances in the Nintendo 64 titles in the \"Legend of Zelda\" series.  Notably, Dodongos appeared in the Dodongo Cavern on Goron Mountain in \"Ocarina of Time\", and the final boss of that dungeon was none other than the King Dodongo himself.  There are many sizes of Dodongos in the game though the typical ones can breathe fire.  Bombs are useful items when facing the larger versions of these enemies. \n"}, {"text": "Which series started the earliest?", "correct": "Donkey Kong", "options": ["Pokemon", "Zelda", "Mario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDonkey Kong.\n\n\tWhile Mario appeared in \"Donkey Kong\" as Jumpman, he wouldn't have his own game until 1983, two years after DK first appeared in arcades around the world.  Mario and DK have been linked together to some extent ever since, reoccurring in each other's games for decades and battling against one another head-to-head in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series of fighting games.  The original \"Donkey Kong\" arcade game reappears in \"Donkey Kong 64\", which is the first time Mario appears in DK's series since those old arcade machines. \n"}, {"text": "Which series of games had a 'crossbow training' instalment?", "correct": "Zelda", "options": ["Pokemon", "Mario", "Donkey Kong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZelda.\n\n\t\"Link's Crossbow Training\" appeared solely on the Wii console as a short game bundled with the Wii Zapper peripheral.  With the console already taking on multiple third-party add-ons, the Zapper was a Nintendo-created item designed to fit the Wii Remote and Nunchuk inside for shooter games.  \"Crossbow Training\" featured a number of themed modules that reflected events and mini-games that would be held in a Gerudo training camp.  Link never used a crossbow in the main series games before this title. \n"}, {"text": "Which series was first to receive a pinball title?", "correct": "Pokemon", "options": ["Mario", "Zelda", "Donkey Kong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPokemon.\n\n\tShowing up on the Game Boy Color in 1999, \"Pokemon Pinball\" was a handheld title that gave players the chance to collect Pokemon on one of two tables-- red and blue-- by using a Pokeball as a pinball to collect high scores.  With this game releasing at the early height of popularity for the series, it's unsurprising it was well-received.  A sequel, \"Pok\u00e9mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire\", released in 2003.  \"Super Mario Ball\" (or \"Mario Pinball Land\") released in 2004 on the Game Boy Advance.  It was his first pinball outing. \n"}, {"text": "In which series could you not catch ghosts?", "correct": "Donkey Kong", "options": ["Pokemon", "Zelda", "Mario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDonkey Kong.\n\n\tDonkey Kong has rarely faced off against the paranormal in his series, doing so for the first time in \"Donkey Kong 64\" when he visited a haunted mansion stage and encountered a deceased Wrinkly Kong on a few occasions.  In all other series, however, catching ghosts has been a possibility.  Aside from catching Boos in \"Paper Mario\", Mario's brother, Luigi, caught ghosts throughout \"Luigi's Mansion\".  In \"Ocarina of Time\", Link could catch Poes in bottles.  In \"Pokemon\", ghost-type Pokemon can be caught as early as Lavender Town in the original games. \n"}, {"text": "Which series was the first to feature a female playable character?", "correct": "Mario", "options": ["Zelda", "Donkey Kong", "Pokemon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMario.\n\n\tIn \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", players could take the role of Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool, making the hapless damsel in distress one of the earliest playable characters in the series; she would be playable in many future games in the series, though rarely platforming titles.  All four series have had playable female characters over time.  Dixie Kong appeared in \"Donkey Kong Country 3\" in the 1990s, Princess Zelda was playable in \"The Wand of Gamelon\" on the Phillips CD-i in 1993, and players could choose their gender in the \"Pokemon\" games as early as 2000 with \"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal\". \n"}, {"text": "Which series features a game subtitled \"Gale of Darkness\"?", "correct": "Pokemon", "options": ["Zelda", "Donkey Kong", "Mario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPokemon.\n\n\t\"Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness\" was a title released on the Gamecube in 2005.  While, technically, all of the main series titles were RPGs at the time, \"Gale of Darkness\" followed a much more linear storyline focused on a main character traveling the lands to purify shadow Pokemon, not an actual Pokemon type, but a Pokemon corrupted by darkness.  The game was somewhat of a sequel to \"Pokemon Colosseum\", also on the Gamecube, and was only moderately received as a result.  Shadow Pokemon, as a concept, wouldn't return until \"Pokk\u00e9n Tournament\", a fighter for the Wii U. \n"}, {"text": "Which was the last franchise to feature two different playable characters in the same \"Super Smash Bros.\" game?", "correct": "Donkey Kong", "options": ["Zelda", "Mario", "Pokemon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDonkey Kong.\n\n\tIt took three \"Super Smash Bros.\" games before Donkey Kong wasn't the only person from his own series to be featured as a fighter-- until Diddy Kong showed up in \"Brawl\".  Mario and Pikachu both shared the stage in the N64 game with Luigi, Yoshi, and Jigglypuff being unlockable characters while \"Melee\" brought extra characters in droves (Mario also saw Luigi, Dr. Mario, Bowser, and Peach, Pikachu shared the stage with Pichu, Mewtwo, Jigglypuff, and Link was met by Ganondorf, Zelda/Sheik, and Toon Link).  Since the early days, other \"Donkey Kong\" characters to show up as playable fighters have included Diddy Kong and King K. Rool. \n"}, {"text": "Which game series features the Tanooki Suit?", "correct": "Mario", "options": ["Zelda", "Pokemon", "Donkey Kong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMario.\n\n\tFound primarily in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" (NES), the Tanooki Suit is a rare item that transforms Mario into a dog-like creature from Japan known to cause mischief.  The suit gives Mario the same flutter ability that the Super Leaf does, but with the added bonus of being able to harden into a stone statue.  The latter ability is removed when the Tanooki Suit returns in \"Super Mario 3D World\" (Wii U) alongside the Cat Bell. \n"}]}
