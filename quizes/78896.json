The mean is sensitive to extreme values in the series- these can 'distort' the average. This is why 'mean income' would be a misleading statistic- you could have hundreds of poor people and just a few very rich people, and the mean income would seem to be rather high, as the large salaries of the rich would unbalance it. \n"}, {"text": "What is the median of the following series- 2 2 2 4 4 5 5 6 8 11 12 16 18 ?", "correct": "5", "options": ["2", "7.31", "16"], "explanation": "\n\n\n5.\n\n\tThe median is the middle score (or the average of the two scores closest to the middle if there is an even number of data points.) Medians are less influenced by extreme scores and thus most common statistics (income, house prices, etc.) use a median score. \n"}, {"text": "What is the mode of the following series- 2 2 2 4 4 5 5 6 8 11 12 16 18 ?", "correct": "2", "options": ["5", "7.31", "16"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tThe mode is the most common score. \n"}, {"text": "What is the range of the following series: 2 2 2 4 4 5 5 6 8 11 12 16 18 ?", "correct": "16", "options": ["2", "7.31", "5"], "explanation": "\n\n\n16.\n\n\tThe range is the highest value minus the lowest value, and shows you the 'spread' of the data. \n"}, {"text": "If you graph a normally distributed set of data (one without obvious irregularities or biases, such as the height of all people in your school), what will the shape of that graph be?", "correct": "Bell-shaped", "options": ["Flat", "Sloping upwards", "J-curve"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBell-shaped.\n\n\tThe graph will be bell-shaped, with a large bulge of 'average' heights and smaller 'tails' of people farther away from the mean- midgets and basketball players. \n"}, {"text": "What is the most commonly used statistical measure of spread in a normally-distributed population?", "correct": "Standard deviation", "options": ["Z score", "X score", "Covariance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStandard deviation.\n\n\tThe standard deviation lets us know how a data sample is distributed around the sample mean. A data set with a small standard deviation has all data points relatively close to the mean, a sample with a large standard deviation is more spread out. In a normal distribution, about 68 percent of scores are within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95 percent are within two standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7 percent are within 3 standard deviations of the mean. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following would be appropriate for a t-test?", "correct": "Determining if a small set of pieces of oak firewood burn longer than pine firewood", "options": ["Determining whether an anti-cancer drug increases the number of patients who survive more than one y", "Determining which of several medicines has the greatest effect on cell growth", "Determining whether the weight of all male golden eagles in a population is statistically different"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDetermining if a small set of pieces of oak firewood burn longer than pine firewood.\n\n\tThe t-test determines whether two sets of scores are significantly different. It can be used with small samples and even if the standard deviation is not known. As sample sizes increase, the measurement becomes more accurate. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following would be appropriate for a z test?", "correct": "Determining whether the weight of all male golden eagles in a population is statistically different from that of female eagles", "options": ["Determining whether an anti-cancer drug increases the number of patients who survive more than one y", "Determining which of several medicines has the greatest effect on cell growth", "Determining if a small set of pieces of oak firewood burn longer than pine firewood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDetermining whether the weight of all male golden eagles in a population is statistically different from that of female eagles.\n\n\tThe z-test also determines whether two sets of scores are significantly different. However, the z test can only be used when a population is known to have a normal distribution and the standard deviation is known. In this case, all weights are known, so the distribution and standard deviations can be checked. Weights of all members of a population is a normally-distributed statistic. The z test is also used when population samples are large. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is used for statistic analysis?", "correct": "Chi-square test", "options": ["Slide rule", "Truth table", "Logarithms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChi-square test.\n\n\tThe best known chi-square test was developed by Karl Pearson in the early twentieth century and is used for testing statistical hypotheses. Truth tables are used in logic and logarithms are associated with mathematics. Slide rules, superseded by calculators, were developed from logarithms as a calculation method, particularly used by engineers. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following would be appropriate for ANOVA?", "correct": "Determining which of several medicines has the greatest effect on cell growth", "options": ["Determining whether an anti-cancer drug increases the number of patients who survive more than one y", "Determining whether the weight of all male golden eagles in a population is statistically different", "Determining if a small set of pieces of oak firewood burn longer than pine firewood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDetermining which of several medicines has the greatest effect on cell growth.\n\n\tANOVA -analysis of variance- is used to determine whether significant differences exist between multiple sets of data. \n"}]}
