{"id": "113189", "name": "Socializing your Puppy Quiz | Dogs | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Dogs", "Dog Behavior"], "questions": [{"text": "What does \"socializing your puppy\" mean?", "correct": "Exposing your puppy to as many new people, animals and experiences as possible", "options": ["Making sure your puppy can tolerate large groups of people", "Teaching your puppy to greet people nicely", "Letting your puppy play with other dogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExposing your puppy to as many new people, animals and experiences as possible.\n\n\tWhen you socialize your pup, you expose him to everything that he may encounter and need to handle as an adult. This includes people and animals of all types, situations (such as high traffic areas and quiet country areas), experiences (going to the vet, riding on an elevator) and objects (statues, umbrellas, and other potentially scary things). If you plan on having a working dog, it also means introducing him to the \"tools of his trade\"- noisy dog shows, being handled by strangers, agility equipment, gunfire, etc. \n"}, {"text": "When do responsible breeders start socializing their puppies?", "correct": "At birth", "options": ["As soon as the puppies' eyes open", "As soon as the puppies start to walk", "As soon as the puppies are weaned"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt birth.\n\n\tResponsible breeders usually ensure that their puppies are habituated to many things from birth. They will handle the pups and get them used to human contact. They will expose the pups safely to normal household situations- children, other animals, vacuum cleaners and the like. As the pups grow older and begin to move about, the responsible breeder will make sure that they are introduced to many new situations. For example, by the age of 8 weeks, my pup will already have been exposed to dogs, cats, game birds, show stacking, new people, dog crates, and many other things. \n"}, {"text": "What is the primary reason that socialization is vitally important?", "correct": "Preventing fears in adult dogs", "options": ["Preventing a puppy from nipping and mouthing", "Teaching a puppy how to greet people nicely", "Making the adult dog more intelligent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPreventing fears in adult dogs.\n\n\tDuring the socialization period, puppies form views on which things are safe and which are not. These opinions last for life! Thus, if the pup has pleasant experiences with something, it will be happy to accept that thing for life. If the puppy is scared by something, it may develop a lifelong fear. After the socialization period ends, the dog is apt to be afraid of anything new and unfamiliar that it meets. In many cases, this leads to problems. Dogs who are not socialized to children, for example, may be afraid of them and tend to bite them as adults. \n"}, {"text": "What age do most dog experts believe is the optimal age for a socialization program?", "correct": "7-16 weeks", "options": ["16-24 weeks", "2-8 weeks", "24-32 weeks"], "explanation": "\n\n\n7-16 weeks.\n\n\tMost experts believe that optimal socialization occurs during the time that, in nature, the puppy would be weaned and would just be starting to interact with others in the pack. During this time, the pup is \"programmed\" to be curious, approach new things, take in as many experiences as possible and process them as \"good\" or \"bad.\" After the socialization period, acclimation to new objects and situations is much more difficult, as the dog will become cautious. \n"}, {"text": "Puppies that are to grow up to be guard dogs should not be socialized to strangers, so that they will be more wary of them as adults.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, it's vital that potential guard dogs be intensively socialized, as they must, as adults, be able to distinguish between normal, harmless human behavior and dangerous human behavior. A good guard dog will not bite a strange running, screaming child, a poorly-socialized one often will. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following should you NOT do if your puppy seems afraid of something?", "correct": "Reassure the puppy, using a high tone of voice to tell him \"It's OK, that won't hurt you.\"", "options": ["Praise and reward any investigative behavior towards the object", "Move away from the object to a distance where the pup is calm", "Investigate and handle the object yourself"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReassure the puppy, using a high tone of voice to tell him \"It's OK, that won't hurt you.\"\n\n\tIf you reassure the puppy, he will interpret your words, which he cannot understand, as praise for his fear! Do not reward fearful behavior. Many pups will regain their boldness when they see you approach the object without fear. The pup should be rewarded for any approaches towards the object. If he is really afraid, back off to a \"safe\" distance where the pup is calm, then gradually approach the feared object (this may take several sessions), rewarding the pup for calm behavior. \n"}, {"text": "With which of the following groups of people is it most vital to socialize your puppy extensively?", "correct": "Men and children", "options": ["Teenagers and older people", "Women and children", "Older people and people of different races"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMen and children.\n\n\tStudies have shown that the commonest \"people phobias\" in dogs are of men and of children. Pups need to be socialized to ALL people, but take extra time with these groups! \n"}, {"text": "When socializing your pup with people, which of the following is important?", "correct": "Make sure the experience is pleasant for the puppy", "options": ["Make sure that the puppy tolerates rough handling", "Make sure as many people as possible handle the puppy", "Discipline the puppy for any signs of aggression"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMake sure the experience is pleasant for the puppy.\n\n\tRemember that these experiences are designed to instill a good attitude about people in your puppy! Allowing anyone to frighten or intimidate the pup at this time can cause lifelong fears. \n"}, {"text": "According to dog behaviorist Dr. Ian Dunbar, how many different people should your puppy meet between the ages of 8 and 12 weeks? ", "correct": "At least 100", "options": ["At least 50", "At least 1000", "At least 25"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt least 100.\n\n\tThat's about three people per day! It really isn't a difficult goal, and it's worth it for your pup. \n"}, {"text": "\"Puppy kindergarten\" classes are a good way to socialize your pup. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAs long as they are well-run, these classes are invaluable! Look for experienced teachers that use only positive methods. Good teachers will practice socialization with people and dogs every class. \n"}]}
