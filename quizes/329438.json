Okay, that might sound cool, but it usually works out to be a lot of trouble. I'm no chicken, but when I went back to my parents' high school years, my *mother* wanted to date me. That's just heavy. And if you mess up the timeline, even in a tiny way, the time you go back to may not be home at all.\"\n\nWhat's the make of this car?", "correct": "DeLorean", "options": ["General Motors", "BMW", "Lamborghini"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeLorean.\n\n\tThe time machine in the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy is a DeLorean, a classic early-1980s vehicle with doors that open upward instead of swinging parallel to the ground. The DeLorean Motor Company, an Irish firm, made only one model (the DMC-12), but achieved cinematic greatness in 1985 when teenager Marty McFly, fleeing the terrorists who had shot inventor Doc Brown, took the car to 88 miles per hour and landed in 1955. Achieving the 1.21 gigaWatts of power necessary to return to the future was a major focus of the first movie, although the later two films solved this problem quickly (with a garbage-powered fusion reactor from the 21st century) so that Marty and Doc could spend most of their effort on saving the timeline from problems introduced by their own time travel. \n"}, {"text": "\"You'll enjoy driving my car: it's the most loyal partner you could ask for, and it's smarter than a lot of people! Just don't forget the wristwatch - you can use it to communicate with KITT if you get separated. Don't be afraid to let the car drive, either, if you need your hands for something else. All right, go get 'em!\"\n\nOn which television show was KITT a star?", "correct": "Knight Rider", "options": ["Thundercats", "Babylon 5", "Burn Notice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKnight Rider.\n\n\t\"Knight Rider,\" which aired on American television from 1982 to 1986, told the story of a man whose police career ended when he was shot in the face. A billionaire named Wilton Knight gave him a new face, a new name (Michael Knight), and a new mission: to fight organized crime with the aid of an intelligent car, the Knight Industries Two Thousand. KITT, as it was known, had all sorts of nifty abilities, from flamethrowers to an automatic pilot, and rescued Michael from all sorts of tight spots. That wristwatch communicator was literally a lifesaver! \n"}, {"text": "\"You can drive my car, but you might not want to give it back - on several occasions, we've been moved to sing about how much we love it! And it isn't just because it's such a shiny convertible; no, this car is something special, something magic. Have you ever had a ride so smooth you thought you were riding on air? Well, our car really does!\"\n\nWhat is the name of this flying machine?", "correct": "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", "options": ["Gadgetmobile", "Defiant", "Spruce Goose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang.\n\n\tChitty Chitty Bang Bang, a magical flying racecar from the 1910s, ferried the Potts family and their friend Truly Scrumptious through an Ian Fleming novel and a 1968 Disney musical. There could be no better friend on an adventure than the car with a gentle glide and the ability to grow propellers and flotation devices, even if its engine did make that characteristic \"chitty bang\" sound. No wonder its riders would sing, \"Pretty Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you!\" \n"}, {"text": "\"You can drive my car, but you'll have to choose which one. The first was a showy red convertible, which didn't really fit with my persona. Gradually it became darker, sleeker, with more useful crimefighting gadgets, and I styled it with my own motif. By the 2000s, my workhorse vehicle was more tank than car, all thanks to Lucius Fox's hard work.\"\n\nSay you do borrow a later version of this car. What animal motif are you most likely to find on it?", "correct": "Bat", "options": ["Wolverine", "Shark", "Cat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBat.\n\n\tYes, this is the famous Batmobile, driven by comic-book crimefighter Bruce Wayne as his alter ego Batman. The Batmobile was indeed cherry-red in its first appearance (in the 1939 comic book that also introduced Batman himself), but soon adopted a dark shade more appropriate for its moody driver. Over the years, this technological marvel acquired ever more incredible abilities, from rocket launching to a mid-drive conversion to a motorcycle. By the 2005 movie \"Batman Begins,\" the car - initially designed for military use by inventor Lucius Fox - was being described by bemused cops as \"a tank.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"You can drive my car, but I'll need it back by race day. If I'm going to foil the corporate spies, beat Racer X, and save my father's motor company, I need my car! There's nothing I can't do with Mach 5. Oh, while you're going for a spin, be careful with the buttons on the steering wheel hub. Those aren't just for honking!\"\n\nWhat teenager, star of a long running anime, is giving these instructions?", "correct": "Speed Racer (Go Mifune)", "options": ["Racer Y (Tenchi Muyo)", "Dragonracer Z (Goku)", "Sailor NASCAR (Usagi Tsukino)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpeed Racer (Go Mifune).\n\n\tThe show is \"Speed Racer\", which launched in Japan as the manga \"Mach GoGoGo\" before hitting television screens in Japan and the US in 1967. The star of the show is Go Mifune (Speed Racer in the English version), a teenage boy who uses his driving skills both to save Mifune Motors from unscrupulous corporate rivals and to win races. Along the way, he gets both help and hindrance from family members, friends, and pets, but it's usually the Mach 5 (with its special abilities like deploying rotary saws or releasing robotic homing birds) that comes through to save the day. Go, Speed Racer, go! \n"}, {"text": "\"You can drive my Camaro if you want, but it's a little -- odd. I bought it used, and on the test drive, it almost seemed to be driving itself. And there's something wrong with the radio. You can never get it to stay on one station, but the songs it plays are always strangely appropriate. Like, you're looking at a girl, and it suddenly starts playing a love song!\"\n\nIn which movie series, based on an animated show, would you find this car?", "correct": "Transformers", "options": ["Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Avatar: The Last Airbender", "G. I. Joe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTransformers.\n\n\t\"Transformers,\" which ran on American television from 1984 to 1987 and came to the big screen as a live-action film in 2007, tells the story of enormous robots from outer space who masquerade themselves as ordinary cars and trucks. (Stay with me, here.) These Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, defend humanity against \"the evil forces of the Decepticons,\" another group of alien robots that wants to exploit the Earth for its own purposes.The car in the question is an Autobot named Bumblebee, assigned to protect the robots' human friend Sam Witwicky. In the movie, he achieves this goal by arranging to be purchased by Sam, and offers romantic advice by means of the radio, since his voice synthesizer has been damaged in battle.When Sam finds out that Bumblebee is intelligent, about halfway through the movie, the fun really begins! \n"}, {"text": "\"Listen, I'm not at all sure that you should drive my car. I hate to admit that my friends were right, but there's something uncanny about her. She's far too easy to fix, and I think she has a mind of her own. People have died -- choking in the back seat, or being mysteriously run over when I'm not there! Just stay away from _______.\"\n\nAll right, that's pretty convincing. Which of these cars should you avoid?", "correct": "Christine", "options": ["Carrie", "Miss Daisy", "Mach 5"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristine.\n\n\tThe evil Christine turns up in a 1983 Stephen King novel by the same name (the movie came out that same year). When Arnie Cunningham buys the red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury secondhand after a few mysterious deaths, his friends soon notice that he's becoming more and more obsessive and misanthropic, just like the previous owner. Soon, those who had objected to the purchase (or the personality change) are dying, one by one, almost as if they're being hunted ... \n"}, {"text": "\"Naturally you may drive my car, but which one? I use so many, but it's rare that a car is truly mine: some are provided courtesy of Her Majesty, and others I borrow as the mission requires. Still, my favorite must be the Aston Martin DB5, my first signature car, which has taken me through decades of beautiful women and shaken martinis.\"\n\nYou'd better make sure to return it on time. Whose car is this?", "correct": "Bond. James Bond.", "options": ["Frank Martin", "John Rambo", "Mad Max"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBond. James Bond.\n\n\tOver decades of movies and several changes of actor, British spy James Bond has become known for a few things: impossible missions, impossible gadgets, impossibly good-looking tuxedoes, and impossibly suave automobiles. He drives a wide variety of product-placed makes and models, but the Aston Martin DB5 -- first trotted out in 1964's \"Goldfinger\" -- has a special place in the hearts of his fans. In fact, when he finally purchased the car in the 2006 reboot \"Casino Royale,\" some movie audiences applauded! No other car can get you through an extended chase scene looking so good. \n"}, {"text": "\"Sure, you can drive our car, but you'll find it a mite tough. For starters, it's a racing car, so we've welded the doors shut -- you'll have to climb in and out through the windows. But if you need to make a quick escape from the commissioner, deliver some moonshine or even jump a ravine, you'll never find a better ride. It's orange and flashy and wears our heritage right on the roof. Just take good care of our __________.\"\n\nWhat do its owners call this car?", "correct": "The General Lee", "options": ["The Rebel Coupe", "The Dukemobile", "The Shiner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe General Lee.\n\n\tThe General Lee, a 1969 Dodge Charger, was driven by cousins Bo and Luke Duke in the American television show \"The Dukes of Hazzard.\" From 1979 to 1985, the bright orange car with a Confederate battle flag on the roof got them into and out of trouble in Hazzard County, Georgia, as they foiled the machinations of the corrupt county commissioner, Boss Hogg.The car's jumps were legendary, but tough on both the vehicle and the stunt drivers. Since each car generally had to be retired due to structural damage after a single jump, the studio eventually had to set up its own body shop to make secondhand vehicles look right in the part.By most estimates, producers went through more than 250 General Lees in the show's 145-episode run! \n"}, {"text": "\"Who you gonna call if you need a car? Ours may not be much to look at -- it's a converted ambulance -- but flip on those lights and sirens and you'll float through town. Just watch out for ectoplasmic residue in the backseat, and when it comes to the headlights -- well, don't cross the beams. Have fun and good hunting!\"\n\nWhat do the owners of this vehicle catch?", "correct": "Ghosts", "options": ["Dreams", "Robbers", "Colds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGhosts.\n\n\tThe Ecto 1, a white 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor hearse/ambulance combination car with a graphical \"no ghosts\" logo on the door, is used by the Ghostbusters, one of New York's more unusual emergency response services. Egon, Peter, Ray and Winston first picked up their proton packs in the 1984 movie \"Ghostbusters,\" ridding the city of such frightening specters as Slimer and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. This success was soon followed by a 1989 movie sequel and a string of cartoon shows, and through it all the Ecto 1 took our heroes in and out of harm's way. \n"}]}
