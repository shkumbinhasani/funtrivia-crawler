{"id": "396813", "name": "Iron Man Trivia Game | Iron Man | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "   Movies H-K", "Iron Man"], "questions": [{"text": "Where is Tony Stark when he's captured and taken hostage?", "correct": "Afghanistan", "options": ["United States", "Libya", "Somalia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAfghanistan.\n\n\tTony Stark, in Afghanistan to host a demonstration as a defence contractor for his company, Stark Industries, ends up getting attacked in a convoy ambush when he's being taken from his demonstration site in the Afghani desert.  While the soldiers transporting him are killed, Tony tries to make an escape.  Unfortunately, he ends up taking the brunt of a blast from one of his own company's explosives and he blacks out in the sand.\rHe ends up awakening when his captors take the burlap sack off his head, and he's on the receiving end of their automatic weapons. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these weapons is the newest in Stark Industries' 'Freedom Line'?", "correct": "The Jericho", "options": ["The Beelzebub", "The Hammer", "The Bolt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Jericho.\n\n\tAn engineering genius, Stark inherited the defence contractor work that his father, Howard, left behind in his passing, taking the business at the age of 21 and leading it with his father's former advisor, Obadiah Stane, by his side.  Stark was immensely successful, elevating Stark Industries as a leader in the field for its advanced robotics. He was a cynic and, by many, seen as a rockstar war profiteer.  With his liaison, James Rhodes, and his personal assistant, Pepper Potts, keeping tabs on him, he was known to play by his own rules.  That's why he was late getting to Afghanistan.  The reason he was there: to demonstrate the newest in their 'Freedom Line' of weapons-- The Jericho. It was after this that he was attacked. \n"}, {"text": "What's the only thing that saves Tony Stark from dying of his shrapnel wounds?", "correct": "Electromagnetism", "options": ["Cold weather", "Heavy medication", "Body armor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElectromagnetism.\n\n\tDuring Tony's time as hostage, he was taken care of to an extent as, had he been left alone, he would've died.  When he wakes up he finds that there's someone in the room with him and, oddly, he's hooked up to a car battery; it's linked directly to his chest and the item implanted into it.  The man, a doctor by the name of Yinsen, says that he removed most of the shrapnel embedded into Tony by the explosive, but he couldn't get it all since some of it pierced his heart. In less than a week, he could die because the barbed metal would pierce his vital organs.  The object in his chest is, thus, an electromagnet hooked to a car battery. The reason Tony is kept alive is to help the terrorists by constructing the Jericho again.  And they claim they'll set him free if he does it. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these allows Stark to escape captivity?", "correct": "A mechanized suit", "options": ["A computer virus", "A nuclear weapon", "A drone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA mechanized suit.\n\n\tTony immediately gets to work using the tools and items provided by the terrorists and, with Yinsen's help, he creates a miniature version of the ARC reactor he uses to power his factory, proposing to use the strong electromagnet to protect his heart so that he can construct a powerful mechanized suit and use it to orchestrate their escape under their captors' noses. The terrorists get wise to his plans and the timeline crunches leading Stark to push his plans into overdrive and Yinsen to sacrifice himself in the last moments.  But it all works.  Stark brings his mech suit online and escapes the caves, bringing down the terrorists and destroying their encampment in a rain of fire before launching into the sky, shooting into the desert. He crash lands, destroying the suit, but he survives.  Stark wanders the desert until American military helicopters led by James Rhodes locate him and bring him home.  He was in captivity for three months. \n"}, {"text": "Upon returning home, Tony closes down which division of his company?", "correct": "Weapons", "options": ["Energy", "Telecommunications", "Transportation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWeapons.\n\n\tAs soon as Tony returns to American soil, he has Pepper call for a press conference and uses the opportunity to announce that he is shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries until he can decide the new direction that it will take to ensure the good of the nation and the world. Obadiah tries his best to soften the blow, reminding reporters that Tony has come back from the brink and needs time to work out his issues.  Talking about the ARC reactor, Tony reveals the advances he made during his time away and suggests that it may be the company's future.  Soon after, Tony has Pepper replace his old ARC device, upgrading to a new one after he cleans up the technology. \n"}, {"text": "What is the original purposes of the lit devices installed on the hands of the Mark II?", "correct": "Flight stabilization", "options": ["Communication", "Energy shield", "Flamethower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlight stabilization.\n\n\tTony speaks to Rhodes specifically, wanting him in for what he has planned, but Rhodes suggests that his friend needs time.  Instead, Stark takes to his private server, J.A.R.V.I.S., and plans something out on his own, building while the terrorists attempt to recover the buried pieces of his destroyed suit in the desert. Obadiah, returning from a board meeting, tells Tony that the directors of the company are planning an injunction, claiming Tony's post-traumatic stress as the reason for the destruction of the company.  It doesn't matter too much though.  With more time, Tony constructs a sleeker suit, making it capable of controlled flight and taking it for a spin in the skies above his Malibu mansion. He performs an altitude test, nearly dying due to an ice build-up, but it ends up being a success.  That night, he opens a package left behind by Pepper.  She took his first ARC device and boxed it up as a gift, labeling it as 'proof Tony Stark has a heart'.  After this, he drafts up his Mark III and heads out to crash a party. \n"}, {"text": "Who admits to sabotaging Tony's stake in Stark Industries?", "correct": "Obadiah", "options": ["Rhodes", "Pepper", "J.A.R.V.I.S."], "explanation": "\n\n\nObadiah.\n\n\tThroughout the film, Tony is approached by a member of the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division, Agent Coulson, and at the charity ball at the Disney Concert Hall, it becomes apparent that Stark needs to be debriefed of what happened.  He forces a date before joining Pepper on the dance floor. After a tense dance, Tony is approached by reporter and asked about the recent weapons shipment that made its way to Gulmira, Yinsen's home city, and into the hands of his former captors.  He later asks Obadiah about it and Obadiah admits to locking Stark out of the business and filing the injunction. Tony decides to alter his suit a little bit, allowing his flight stabilizers to fire concussive blasts.  And suiting up, he flies out to Afghanistan to protect the citizens of Gulmira on his own, destroying the newly-made Jericho missiles in the process. \n"}, {"text": "Pepper finds that there is a secret operation taking place in which of these locations?", "correct": "Sector 16", "options": ["The Los Angeles Hills", "Stark Industries' basement", "Gulmira"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSector 16.\n\n\tThe military discovers what's happening in Gulmira via satellite and Rhodes is called in to assess the situation.  He sees what's going on and calls Stark to ask about any potential tech in the Gulmira area, but Tony plays coy, instead going face-to-face against the air force until he's forced to call Rhodes back and reveal what he's doing. The situation is played off in the media as an unfortunate training exercise.  In Afghanistan, Obadiah meets with the terrorists to discuss Tony Stark's interference in their plans and they reveal the pieces of the Mark I, finally assembled as a weapon of death. Obadiah has the terrorists killed and absconds with the prototype, bringing it back to work on himself.  During this time, Tony sends Pepper to find out what the company is doing behind his back, but Pepper, worried for his safety, suggests that she'll quit instead.  He convinces her, though, that saving the world is what he's meant to do.  What Pepper finds, on Obadiah's ghost drive, is incriminating evidence that he's not only planning to recreate the suit, but he paid the terrorists to attempt to kill Tony.  Pepper narrowly escapes with the evidence on a jump drive, heading out with Agent Coulson while Obadiah checks in with his engineers. \n"}, {"text": "Tony's original ARC core is not capable of powering his Mark III suit.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tObadiah attacks Tony in his home and admits to putting out the hit on him.  Using a device to cause short-term paralysis, Obadiah removes Tony's ARC core from his chest, needing it for his own suit, and departs.  Pepper, not getting through to Tony while she works with S.H.I.E.L.D., calls Rhodes to check in on Tony, giving him all the details he needs.  Tony, meanwhile, is barely able to save himself, descending into his workshop to retrieve his old core, still in the box Pepper had made for him.  Rhodes finds him on the floor, still alive, and tells him that Pepper is heading to the lab with agents, but it won't be enough and Tony knows it.  Rhodes watches as Tony suits up and departs and he vows to keep the skies clear.  He looks over at another suit prototype and tells himself that he'll try it next time.\rDown in the labs of Sector 16, Pepper and Agent Coulson come face to face with Obadiah, now in his functioning suit, and he's too powerful to fight solo. \n"}, {"text": "Who causes the power surge in the lab ARC reactor?", "correct": "Pepper", "options": ["Tony", "Rhodes", "Obadiah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPepper.\n\n\tTony arrives just in time to save Pepper from Obadiah and their fight pushes them out into the Los Angeles city streets.  In an attempt to one-up Obadiah, Tony attempts to reach maximum altitude again, pushing the constraints of his old power core to the brink while he and Obadiah freeze.  Obadiah fails to account for this and plummets to the ground while Tony moves to his emergency reserves.  It seems like Obadiah is defeated, but on the ground, Obadiah gets the upper hand, crushing Tony's suit to cause a power breach.  Tony communicates with Pepper and asks her to overload the ARC reactor in the lab so that they can flood the roof while the battle comes to a head.  Obadiah's vision in the suit is destroyed; Tony's helmet is crushed.  When Tony tells Pepper to push the button, he's thrown back and Obadiah takes the full brunt of the ARC's power surge, destroying the lab and killing him in the process.\rRhodes is able to minimize the damages in the media while Coulson accounts for Stark's alibi and Obadiah's mysterious death before departing.  Tony discusses his relationship with Pepper before heading to the podium.  The newspapers are calling the mysterious saviour of the city the 'Iron Man', so when he stands in front of the media, he doesn't mince words too much.  He throws away his cue cards and tells the truth, announcing \"I am Iron Man.\" \n"}]}
