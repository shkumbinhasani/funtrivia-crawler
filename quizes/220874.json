Kareem won the MVP award three times with the Bucks (1970-71, 1971-72 and 1973-74) and three times with the Lakers (1975-76, 1976-77 and 1979-80).  Wow! \n"}, {"text": "The MVP award officially goes back to the 1955-56 NBA season.  Who was the winner of that first award?", "correct": "Bob Pettit", "options": ["Bob Lanier", "Bob Cousy", "Bob Mcadoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob Pettit.\n\n\tWell, you knew it had to be a Bob at least.  \r Bob Pettit, who played for the Milwaukee and St. Louis Hawks (later to become the Atlanta Hawks), won the award twice, first in 1955-56 and finally in 1958-59. \n"}, {"text": "Dave Cowens was one of the great stars of the Boston Celtics during the 1970s.  Did he ever win an MVP award?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tCowens averaged 17.6 ppg and a monstrous 13.6 rpg during his career.  Arguably his best season was 1972-73, when he averaged 20.5 ppg and cowered the competition with 16.2 rpg.  Heck, the guy even had a career high in blocks (101) that year.  No wonder, then, that he won the MVP award that year, his only one. \n"}, {"text": "Most of the MVP awards during the 1960s were won by two men.  One was Bill Russell, who took part in 11 championship seasons with the Boston Celtics.  He won the award four times during the 60s.  Which other player also won four MVP awards during that decade?", "correct": "Wilt Chamberlain", "options": ["Willis Reed", "Wes Unseld", "Oscar Robertson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilt Chamberlain.\n\n\tOf the 10 MVP awards given out during the 1960s, the two rival centers Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain won eight.  The difference between the two players, Russell had his 11 championships, while Chamberlain only managed two. \n"}, {"text": "From the 1986-87 season until the 1991-92 season, only two men won the MVP award, each one three times.  One was Michael Jordan, who was the other?", "correct": "Magic Johnson", "options": ["Larry Bird", "Charles Barkley", "Moses Malone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagic Johnson.\n\n\tMagic Johnson won his three career MVPs during this period (1986-87, 1988-89 and 1989-90), while Michael Jordan would be destined to win two more MVP awards after his three during this period (1987-88, 1990-91, 1991-92, 1995-96 and 1997-98). \n"}, {"text": "John Stockton had an illustrious 19-year career with the Utah Jazz, during which time he set career records for most steals and assists.  Did Stockton ever win an MVP award?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn one of the all-time injustices of NBA history, John Stockton was frozen out by MVP voters for 19 straight years.  Oddly enough, Steve Nash, a point guard of similar size and capabilities, won the MVP award in 2004-05 with 15.5 ppg, 11.5 apg and a .502 shooting percentage.  Stockton had several far superior seasons, for example 1989-90 when he averaged 17.2 ppg, 14.5 apg and shot .514 from the floor.  He also had well over twice as many steals as Nash did in his MVP season.

Who was the third?", "correct": "Larry Bird", "options": ["Julius Erving", "Michael Jordan", "Kareem Abdul-jabbar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarry Bird.\n\n\tSurprised?  Me neither. \r Larry Bird only won three career MVP awards, all occurring back-to-back-to-back.  He won in 1983-84, 1984-85 and 1985-86.  But in the hearts of Boston Celtics fans, he will always be the MVP (oh lord, that was cheesy!) \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first New York Knick to win the MVP award, doing so after a magnificent 1969-70 season?", "correct": "Willis Reed", "options": ["Bill Bradley", "Walt Frazier", "Dave Debusschere"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWillis Reed.\n\n\tWillis Reed, aka 'The Captain', won his MVP award after leading the Knicks with 21.7 ppg, 13.9 rpg and a .507 shooting percentage.

Was he the first Houston Rocket to win an MVP award?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNo way, Jose.  Moses Malone was the first Rocket to garner the MVP prize, doing so after the 1981-82 season during which he averaged a monstrous 31.1 ppg and 14.7 rpg.  As a comparison, during Hakeem Olajuwon's MVP season (1993-94) he averaged 27.3 ppg and 11.9 rpg.
