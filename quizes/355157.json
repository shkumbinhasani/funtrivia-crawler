This is when Grandpa takes the opportunity to tell his son that he actually has a half-brother.  When he and Mrs. Simpson were courting he slept with a woman who worked with a traveling carnival.

Although the director of the orphanage is unable to release the whereabouts of Homer's sibling, he does say that the boy's name was Herbert and that he was adopted decades earlier by a Mr. and Mrs. Powell.  The director of the orphanage goes out of his way to slip in the city in which Herb lives, but it takes a while for Homer to realize this. \n"}, {"text": "Herb is found living in what major U.S. city?", "correct": "Detroit", "options": ["Chicago", "New York City", "Boston"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDetroit.\n\n\tTaking out a Detroit phone book, Homer calls all the Powells he can find.  Although all of the Herberts in the book seem to be incorrect, he finally gets a hold of his half-brother using the number assigned to H. Powell.  Herb suggests that they get together and while Homer suggests that Herb fly out to meet him in Springfield, Herb invites the entire family to his mansion in Detroit.\rThe Simpsons pack their car and head off on a road trip.

When Homer says he wants a big car with lots of pep, Herb's executives say that they don't sell those types of things since Americans want smaller cars with more mileage.  Herb thinks that perhaps he's found the solution to his problems with the company; Homer is the American everyman and his ideas will put the Powell Motors company back in touch with the consumer.

One designer calls Herb for clearance and he allows all of the changes to be made.\rAt one point, Homer mentions he can never find a horn when he's angry; the car needs several horns and they should all play \"La Cucaracha\".\rFor some reason, Homer is put through several tests (on his own) while the rest of the family enjoys outlandish daily activities.
