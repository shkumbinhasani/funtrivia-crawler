As reported at www.wordorigins.com, 'This term, for one who is punished for the misdeeds of others, is the result of a mistranslation. The term was coined in 1530 by William Tyndale, who misread the Hebrew word 'azazel, the proper name of Canaanite demon, as 'ez ozel, literally 'the goat that departs.' In Leviticus 16:8, the scriptures describe how two goats should be prepared for an offering, lots should be drawn, and one should be sacrificed to the Lord as a sin-offering, and the other given to Azazel and set free in the wilderness bearing the sins of the people.' Another interpretation was sent to me by Quizzyland player yaarbiriah-\"William Tyndale's translation coincides with older rabbinic interpretations related to the goat departing (aramaic), though other interpretations mention the Canaanite demon idea we should not think that the second goat was actually sacrificed to this demon per se as that would be idolatry. According to some interpretations the goat is sent into the desert with a man who will not last the year (probably very sick)- he has the job of driving the goat over a cliff. The goat does not go free but dies in the wilderness. Ancient Judaism does believe in the existence of demonic entities but that these cannot have any power over us as long as we are doing what we should be doing. All agree that the goats, each in their own ways, atone for the sins of the people in that they represent our animal natures.. and should inspire recognition of the urgings of our animal natures, how they must be 'sacrificed' to the better judgement of our brains. Goats have always represented sacrifices for sins, 'cheta'im' literally meaning 'missing the mark' or 'missing the point' in modern English. The Hebrew word for goat is 'ez' which is etymologically similar to 'az' meaning 'bold', a trait which is often bad unless used purely for holy purposes. \" \n"}, {"text": "'Tragelaphus', meaning 'goat deer', is the name for a genus of what kind of animals?", "correct": "Antelopes", "options": ["Deer", "Sheep", "Mountain goats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAntelopes.\n\n\tThis genus consists of most of the larger African antelopes like kudus and elands. \n"}, {"text": "What word is both a colloquialism for a female goat and a term for a child's caretaker?", "correct": "nanny", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nnanny.\n\n\t'Nanny' is disliked by most goat breeders, because it engenders negative goat stereotypes.
