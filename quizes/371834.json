Quiz | TV & Movies Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", " TV & Movies Mixture", "Something in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "Young Kevin McCallister was left at home, alone, last year, but this year he's lost in New York City.  Is \"Home Alone 2\" set during Christmas?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tBoth of the Macaulay Culkin \"Home Alone\" films, directed by Chris Columbus in the 1990s, took place just before and during Christmas Day, making an interesting (as they put it) family comedy without the family.  In both, Kevin McCallister was left on his own but proved resourceful by preventing small-time crooks Harry and Marv from thieving from his house in the first movie and then stealing from a major toy store in the second.  Both were extremely popular movies in theatres and have since become Christmas classics. \n"}, {"text": "An old woman tells her granddaughter the story of Edward Scissorhands in Tim Burton's 1990 film, explaining that it never snowed in their Florida suburb until he arrived.  Does this movie take place during the Christmas season?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhile Christmas Day is never explicitly reached in this movie, there are scenes involving presents and decorating Christmas trees.  When Edward Scissorhands is found by an Avon Lady who walks into the creepy mansion at the end of the street, he becomes a local celebrity despite his deformity.  One of the more interesting side-effects of having Edward in the neighbourhood was the introduction of snow to the otherwise uncanny suburban setting.  The snow, as it would seem, is from shavings of ice created when Edward makes sculptures from up on the hill. \n"}, {"text": "Ice-producing princess Elsa rebuilds bonds with her sister in Disney's 2013 animated adaptation of \"The Snow Queen\", \"Frozen\".  Was this movie set during Christmastime?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhile \"Frozen\" shared a lot of the typical motifs of a Christmas movie (snow, snowmen, familial love, etc.), it was not actually a Christmas film by any means.  In fact, \"Frozen\" was an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Snow Queen\", about a girl whose power to control snow and ice could only be controlled with heartwarming love.  \"Frozen\" was immensely popular, earning more than $1.2 billion in the box office. \n"}, {"text": "John McClane is called in to deal with an act of terrorism in the 1988 film \"Die Hard\" and, unfortunately, his wife is one of the hostages.  Is it true that the film took place on Christmas Eve?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tNot only did the events of \"Die Hard\" occur during Christmas Eve/Christmas, but the events of \"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\" also took place on Christmas (albeit at an airport).  For some reasons, terrorists dig the holidays.\rIn the original \"Die Hard\", Bruce Willis played L.A. detective John McClane who, upon realizing terrorists had his wife and her Christmas party hostage in Nakatomi Tower, decided to take matters into his own hands to bring them to justice.  Alan Rickman starred as the main antagonist, Hans Gruber. \n"}, {"text": "On \"Friends\", the gang sits around a table giving gifts.  Rachel's latest boyfriend, clearly too young for her, buys her a scooter and runs off to enjoy it.  Is this a Christmas episode?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThis is actually \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\", and it doesn't take place during Christmas; it occurs during Rachel's birthday.  The gifts end up being only for Rachel (as is the case on birthdays) but the episode ends up exploring the thirtieth birthdays for all six of the core characters.\r If you wanted to watch a Christmas episode, you could pick eight of the two hundred thirty-six episodes made over the show's ten year run.  Every season from two to nine had one. \n"}, {"text": "When Billy is given his very own Mogwai he, against better judgment, spills water on it, creating the creatures of \"Gremlins\".  Was this 1984 film set during Christmas?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tCertainly one of the darker Christmas movies out there, \"Gremlins\" was directed by Joe Dante and released in 1984.  In the movie, Billy received the Mogwai, Gizmo, for Christmas, with the warning never to let water touch it, never to let it see sunlight, and never to feed it after midnight as the latter two would spawn eviler gremlins.  Although the movie was set during the holiday, it did contain a few graphic scenes to contrast the comedy aspects throughout.  It was also popular enough to warrant a sequel, also by Dante, in 1990. \n"}, {"text": "You've decided to watch the first full-length episode of \"The Simpsons\".  Is it set during Christmas?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe very first full-length \"Simpsons\" episode (entitled \"Simpsons Roasting Over an Open Fire\") aired back in late 1989, giving life to the famous, yellow family and kickstarting their decades-long life on television.  Although the show has had near-annual Christmas episodes, the most famous may be this one in which Homer went to the races after the family lost all of their money and ended up walking away with a new pet-- Santa's Little Helper. \n"}, {"text": "Peter, Susan, and Lucy come face-to-face with Santa Claus during their visit to Narnia in \"The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe\" to receive their special gifts to defeat the White Witch.  Does this happen on Christmas?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn fact, while Santa gives them their gifts only a short time into their stay in the mystical world in the first \"Chronicles of Narnia\" movie (released in 2005), it is only because he's met when they coincidentally cross paths in the forest.  The White Witch, Jadis, has placed Narnia into an eternal winter and, in doing so, prevented Christmas from ever coming, so the movie never really takes place on Christmas proper. \n"}, {"text": "Sister Mary Eunice decides to let a serial killer dressed as Santa roam free in \"American Horror Story's\" 'Asylum' season.  Did this happen during the Christmas season, however?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhile \"American Horror Story\" has always been hellbent on offering up horrific tales of all sorts, a traditional Christmas episode is usually in order.  The first season, 'Murder House', ended on Christmas while 'Freak Show' had its own spin on the holiday.  In 'Asylum', the inmates of Briarcliff celebrated the holiday with a demon in their midst, though in the body of Sister Mary Eunice.  One of her fiendish acts was letting one patient, known for murdering people dressed as Santa, loose on head nun Sister Jude.  The episode in question was called \"Unholy Night\". \n"}, {"text": "Ack ack ack!  Martians have come to invade the earth in Tim Burton's 1996 sci-fi/comedy \"Mars Attacks!\"  Is the movie set at Christmas?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tOddly, while this Burton film wasn't set at Christmas, it does feature a great deal of red and green throughout.  This was intentional, however, and with Christmas in mind, mainly because the film was slated for release during the 1996 holiday season.  \"Mars Attacks!\", based on the trading card game of the same name, starred a gigantic ensemble cast and, while it was never Burton's most popular or most profitable (it barely broke even) it ended up becoming a bit of a cult classic. \n"}]}
