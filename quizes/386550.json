{"id": "386550", "name": "Interstate Highs and Lows Quiz | Roads & Highways | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Roads & Highways", "U.S. Roads & Highways"], "questions": [{"text": "The longest interstate highway is I-90, which travels 3,020 miles from Boston, Massachusetts, to which West Coast city?", "correct": "Seattle, WA", "options": ["San Francisco, CA", "Portland, OR", "Los Angeles, CA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeattle, WA.\n\n\tI-90 takes the northern route across the U.S., starting at Boston in the east and finishing in Seattle on the West Coast. It passes through a total of 13 states, starting in Massachusetts and then going through New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho on the way to its destination in Washington. \n"}, {"text": "As I-90 leaves Boston to join the Massachusetts Turnpike near Logan Airport, it passes under Boston Harbour. Opened in 1995 to commercial traffic and to general traffic in 2003, after which U.S. Marine Air Corps veteran and Boston sporting legend is the tunnel named? ", "correct": "Ted Williams", "options": ["Larry Bird", "Bobby Orr", "Tom Brady"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTed Williams.\n\n\tThe Ted Williams Tunnel was the third tunnel opened under Boston Harbour, after the Sumner and Callahan Tunnels. The tunnel is 8,448 feet long, 3,960 feet of which is underwater. Vehicles travelling in both directions pay a toll to use the tunnel.\r Born in San Diego, California, in 1918, Theodore Samuel Williams made his major-league debut for the Red Sox in 1939 at the age of 20. A 6-time batting champion (including two Triple Crowns), he was named AL MVP twice. His .344 career batting average is higher than any other major league player who hit more than 302 home runs (Williams hit 521). No player has batted higher than .400 for a season since Williams posted a .406 average in just his third season, in 1941. \n"}, {"text": "Another of the toll roads traversed by I-90 on its way across the country is the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway. In the same state, I-90 also travels along the Kennedy Expressway and the Dan Ryan Expressway. In which state can you drive these highways?", "correct": "Illinois", "options": ["Ohio", "Pennsylvania", "South Dakota"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIllinois.\n\n\tAs you cross the Indiana state line into Illinois, you join the Chicago Skyway Toll Bridge System, a 7.8-mile road that carries across the Calumet River and Calumet Harbor that carries you onto the Dan Ryan Expressway. \r Opened in 1961, this 7.5-mile freeway that is also part of I-94 as it takes you through the south side of Chicago. The Dan Ryan Expressway ends at the Circle Interchange with I-290 (the Eisenhower Expressway) near downtown Chicago.\r Meanwhile, I-90 continues westwards, joining the 17.8-mile long Kennedy Expressway, opened in 1960 and named in honour of the country's new president. \r At the junction with I-190 for O'Hare Airport, I-90 joins the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway. This stretch of I-90 which opened in 1958 was originally named the Northwest Tollway, but was redesignated in 2007 in honour of the activist and suffragette who, in 1931, became the first American winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. This tollway runs 76 miles to South Beloit, Illinois, where I-90 crosses the state line into Wisconsin. \n"}, {"text": "The lowest point on any interstate highway is 103 feet below sea level on I-95 as it wends its way from the Canadian border in Maine to Miami, Florida. This low point occurs as the highway passes through Fort McHenry Tunnel, under the harbour of which city?", "correct": "Baltimore, MD", "options": ["Savannah, GA", "Richmond, VA", "Florence, SC"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaltimore, MD.\n\n\tNamed for the nearby Fort McHenry, an 18th-century coastal star-shaped fort closely associated with the War of 1812, I-95 carries under the Inner Baltimore Harbour. The nearby Baltimore Harbour Tunnel had opened in 1957 but did not carry I-95: prior to the opening of the new 1.5-mile long, 8-lane, 4-tube tunnel in 1985, there had been a break in the longest north-south interstate. \n"}, {"text": "The longest north-south interstate and the sixth-longest overall, I-95 crosses more states (15 plus Washington, D.C.) than any other interstate. In which of these states can you NOT travel along part of I-95?", "correct": "Vermont", "options": ["Rhode Island", "Pennsylvania", "North Carolina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVermont.\n\n\tStarting on the Canadian border near Houlton, Maine, I-95 passes through New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia before ending in Miami, Florida. The only New England state that I-95 does not cross is Vermont. \n"}, {"text": "At 2,555 miles, I-40 is the third-longest interstate, running from Barstow, California in the west and North Carolina in the east. Part of the route is along the specially-signposted \"Music Highway\" in which state?", "correct": "Tennessee", "options": ["Texas", "Arizona", "California"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTennessee.\n\n\tI-40 is designated as the \"Music Highway\", signposted with musical notes in both directions, between Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee. Memphis is known as the \"Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll\" whilst Nashville is nicknamed \"Music City USA\". Between the two cities, I-40 passes through numerous places such as Jackson, Brownsville, Nutbush, Waverly and other towns noted as the birthplaces or homes of famous singers and songwriters, particularly from the world of country music. \n"}, {"text": "A major north-south highway, I-25 intersects with most of the coast-to-coast interstates. On its 1,063 route, I-25 also passes through three state capitals. Which of those listed is NOT on I-25?", "correct": "Oklahoma City, OK", "options": ["Cheyenne, WY", "Santa Fe, NM", "Denver, CO"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOklahoma City, OK.\n\n\tDespite a course in excess of 1,000 miles, I-25 passes through only three states. The southern end of I-25 lies at the junction with I-10 near Las Cruces, New Mexico, the state's second-largest city, then heads northwards through the largest, Albuquerque, where it intersects with I-40, and the state capital, Santa Fe. \r Heading up through Colorado, I-25 passes through Colorado Springs, home of the United States Olympic Training Center and the Air Force Academy, before meeting I-70 in the state capital, Denver. It then intersects with I-76 in North Washington, Colorado, before crossing the border into Wyoming.\r In the state capital, Cheyenne, I-25 intersects with I-80 before travelling north to its terminus at the junction with I-90 in Buffalo, Wyoming. \r Oklahoma City lies further east on I-40, at the junction with I-35 which runs from Laredo, Texas, in the south to Duluth, Minnesota, in the north. \n"}, {"text": "To visit the USA's oldest and most famous national park, Yellowstone, you may well travel via I-15, which has its northern terminus at the Canadian border crossing into Alberta near Sweet Grass, Montana. In which city is the southern end of I-15?", "correct": "San Diego, CA", "options": ["Laredo, TX", "Nogales, AZ", "El Paso, TX"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Diego, CA.\n\n\tI-15 is unusual in that it does not follow a fairly strict north-south route, although it does still follow the rule of not crossing other major north-south interstates. Since the southern terminus of I-25 is known to be at Las Cruces, New Mexico, this allows you to eliminate the Texas options. Heading south from the Canadian border between Alberta and Montana, I-15 passes by Butte and Helena before crossing the border into Idaho. At this point, it is the closest north-south interstate to the western entrance into Yellowstone N.P. \r I-35 then travels more-or-less due south, paralleling the Idaho-Wyoming border, before crossing into Utah, where it intersects with I-80 in Salt Lake City. This is where I-35 deviates from its expected route, instead turning and heading southwest rather than south. It intersects with I-70 at Cove Fort, Utah before clipping the northwestern corner of Arizona and crossing into Nevada near the northern end of the Nevada-Arizona state line and heading through Las Vegas. \r Crossing into California, I-15 continues southwest, following the path of the historic Route 66 through Barstow, where it forms the western terminus of I-40. At San Bernadino, California, I-15 again turns southwards, passing through Ontario CA, where it crosses I-10, before heading into San Diego. \r  Nogales, Arizona, lies on the Mexican border and is also the southern terminus of I-19, a 63-mile long interstate that connects the state's southern border with Tucson, where it joins I-10. El Paso, Texas, is served by I-10 and to reach a major north-south highway you must take this route west to I-25 at Las Cruces, New Mexico. Laredo, Texas, lies even further east, and is the southern terminus of I-35. \n"}, {"text": "At 2,153 miles, I-70 is the fifth-longest interstate, running from Baltimore, Maryland, in the east to the junction with I-15 at Cove Fort, Utah, at its western end. After 800 miles of its journey from the East Coast, having traversed six states, I-70 crosses the Mississippi River into Missouri, across a bridge named for which sporting hero?", "correct": "Stan Musial", "options": ["Brett Hull", "Derrick Thomas ", "Dan Dierdorf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStan Musial.\n\n\tI-70 crosses the Mississippi river from St Clair County, Illinois, into St Louis, Missouri, across the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, nicknamed locally as the \"Stan Span\" (Musial was affectionately known as \"Stan the Man\"). Opened in 2014, the cable-stayed bridge carries four lanes of I-70 for 2,803 feet, with 1,500 feet of that crossed by its longest single span.\r Stanisaw Franciszek Musia was born in 1920 in the borough of Donora, Pennsylvania, 20 miles south of Pittsburgh. He made his major-league debut for the St Louis Cardinals in 1941, and played his entire 22-year career with the team, winning three World Series titles. He won the NL batting title seven times and was named league MVP three times. His Cardinals retired his #6, and he was elected the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first ballot in 1969. \n"}, {"text": "The longest continuous stretch of a single interstate within one state runs for 879 miles along I-10. This state also has more miles of interstate highway (3,233 miles) than any other state. Which state is this?", "correct": "Texas", "options": ["New Mexico", "California", "Florida"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTexas.\n\n\tOn its 2,460-mile route from Santa Monica, California, in the west to Jacksonville, Florida, in the east, I-10 includes an uninterrupted section of 879 miles across Texas. The longest stretch of any interstate across a single state, this portion of I-10 runs from the New Mexico border near to El Paso, Texas, to Orange, Texas, on the border with Louisiana.\r Although only 17 interstate routes criss-cross Texas, they cover a massive 3.233 miles, which is the most mileage of interstate highway within any single state. Compare that with New York, which has the most interstate routes (29), but barely half the mileage of interstate highway (1,674 miles) as Texas. \n"}]}
