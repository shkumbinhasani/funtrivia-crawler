{"id": "190952", "name": "The Film History of Henry Fonda Quiz / Test | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed E-K", " Henry Fonda"], "questions": [{"text": "Henry Fonda was well-known for having collaborated with legendary director John Ford.  In his first appearance in a John Ford film, which U.S. President did Fonda portray?", "correct": "Abraham Lincoln", "options": ["Theodore Roosevelt", "Andrew Jackson", "Thomas Jefferson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbraham Lincoln.\n\n\tHenry Fonda acted in two John Ford-directed films that were released in 1939.  The first was 'Young Mr. Lincoln', in which Fonda portrayed Abraham Lincoln.  The second was 'Drums Along the Mohawk'.  The two worked together a total of nine times. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Henry Fonda's shockingly evil character in the 1968, Sergio Leone-directed classic 'Once Upon a Time in the West'?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Jack", "Bob", "Thomas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tHenry Fonda's role as the ruthless Frank shocked the film world, as Fonda had always been known previously to play the hero role.  It was Fonda's pal Eli Wallach (of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly') who convinced Fonda to take the role of Frank. \n"}, {"text": "Which film featured Henry Fonda as Gil Carter, a western drifter who becomes involved in the lynching of three innocent men?", "correct": "The Ox-Bow Incident", "options": ["Wild Geese Calling", "Fort Apache", "Let Us Live!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ox-Bow Incident.\n\n\tEasily one of the most jarring westerns of all time, 'The Ox-Bow Incident' also features the acting of Dana Andrews, Anthony Quinn and Harry Morgan, among others.  This film is a must see! \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the character played by Henry Fonda in the classic 1940 film 'The Grapes of Wrath'?", "correct": "Tom Joad", "options": ["Reverend Casy", "Connie Rivers", "Grant Mitchell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Joad.\n\n\tOnce again, Henry Fonda was directed by John Ford in this big screen adaptation of John Steinbeck's monumental Great Depression novel.

Both films involved the accidental triggering of a nuclear incident that turned out to be irreversible.  Nonetheless, the two films were very different in style and quality, and 'Fail-Save' is often overlooked despite its intriguing nature. \n"}, {"text": "Henry Fonda took his turn as Wyatt Earp in which memorable adaptation of the shootout at the OK Corral story of American legend?", "correct": "My Darling Clementine", "options": ["Wichita", "Frontier Marshal", "Cheyenne Autumn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Darling Clementine.\n\n\tHenry Fonda was not the first actor to portray Wyatt Earp in a film adaptation of the OK Corral story, that honor goes to Randolph Scott for the 1939 film 'Frontier Marshal'.  However, Fonda's depiction of Wyatt Earp in 'My Darling Clementine' (1946) may be the most memorable and beloved in film history.  Again, Fonda was directed by John Ford in this film. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1955 film 'Mister Roberts', Henry Fonda portrayed the title character Lt. (jg) Douglas A. Roberts.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAlongside Henry Fonda's 'Mister Roberts' was James Cagney, William Powell, Jack Lemmon and Ward Bond.  The director of the film was, you guessed it, John Ford.  This was the last collaboration between Fonda and Ford.  Rumor has it that Ford punched Fonda during the filming, and the former left the film before its completion. \n"}, {"text": "'12 Angry Men' was another Henry Fonda classic.  In this film, Fonda plays juror #1, the foreman of a jury selected to decide a murder case.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, Fonda is juror #8, and is not the foreman, but the lone dissenting juror in a seemingly open-and-shut case.  Sidney Lumet directs this wonderful film with an all-star cast that also includes Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Ed Begley, Jack Klugman and several other notables.  Like 'The Ox-Bow Incident', this is a must see! \n"}, {"text": "The immortal American actor Henry Fonda only worked with immortal British film director Alfred Hitchcock once.  With which movie did the two collaborate?", "correct": "The Wrong Man", "options": ["The Man Who Knew Too Much", "I Confess", "The Trouble with Harry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wrong Man.\n\n\tHenry Fonda had a penchant for playing men who have the weight of the world pressing down, and his role as the falsely accused Manny Balestrero in 'The Wrong Man' was no different.  Anthony Quayle portrays Balestrero's able attorney, and Vera Miles his distraught wife who must suffer through the entire process of proving Balestrero's innocence. \n"}, {"text": "For which film, his last, did Henry Fonda finally receive his first acting Academy Award?", "correct": "On Golden Pond", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn Golden Pond.\n\n\tStunningly, Henry Fonda was only nominated twice for acting Oscars, once for 1940's 'The Grapes of Wrath' and once for the 1981 film 'On Golden Pond'.
