{"id": "376995", "name": "The Wrong Box: A Life of Robert Louis Stevenson Quiz | People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "People Q-S"], "questions": [{"text": "Robert Louis Stevenson was born on 13 November 1850, the only child of Thomas Stevenson and Margaret Isabella Balfour. He was born on Howard Place, close to Princes Street, one of the main thoroughfares in which great Scottish city?", "correct": "Edinburgh", "options": ["Glasgow", "Dundee", "Aberdeen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdinburgh.\n\n\tThe family business on his father's side was lighthouse engineering, with all of the men in the three generations of the Stevenson family preceding Robert Louis having gone into that trade. His father was the great Robert Stevenson, engineer of the Bell Rock Lighthouse in the North Sea (the world's oldest sea-washed lighthouse and one of the Seven Wonders of the Industrial World). \r It was perhaps due to his ill health as a child, or the fact that he spent a lot of time with his maternal grandfather (his mother's side of the family were members of the Scottish gentry - far from being engineers) that Stevenson did not follow in his father's footsteps. \n"}, {"text": "Despite enrolling in engineering at the University of Edinburgh in 1867, Stevenson had little enthusiasm for his studies. He preferred to spend his time learning public speaking and literary composition with his friends in one of the university's societies. What was that group called?", "correct": "Speculative Society", "options": ["Bullingdon Club", "Sigma Alpha Epsilon", "Wyverns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpeculative Society.\n\n\tThe Speculative Society at Edinburgh University was founded in 1764 and regularly hosts secretive dinners as well as debates and public speakers. Previous members include the author Sir Walter Scott and the mathematician John Playfair. It has recently come under criticism for not having admitted a single woman to the society in its 250-year history, with the rules being changed in 2014. \r The other three answers are notorious clubs from other universities. The Bullingdon Club is an all-male dining club at the University of Oxford; previous members include David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson. If you want an insight into the supposed debauchery of the Bullingdon Club check out the 2014 film 'The Riot Club'. The Wyverns are a drinking club at the University of Cambridge and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at Arizona State was branded the 'most out-of-control fraternity in America' by 'Rolling Stone' magazine in 2013. \n"}, {"text": "One member of the Speculative Society with whom Stevenson was particularly close was the engineering professor Fleeming Jenkin, in fact he would go on to write his biography in later life. To the wider world, Jenkin is best known as the inventor of which unusual mode of transport?", "correct": "Telpherage", "options": ["G-Wiz", "Hot Air Balloon", "Steam Train"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelpherage.\n\n\tHaving met Jenkin through the Speculative Society, Stevenson went on to take part in amateur dramatics at the Jenkin household, and developed a great respect for the man both as a professor and as a friend.  An immensely personal biography, 'Memoir of Fleeming Jenkin' was published shortly after his death in 1885. Jenkin's influence on Stevenson can be seen as he ends the memoir 'two years have passed since Fleeming was bid to rest beside his father, his mother, and his uncle John, and the thought and the look of our friend still haunts us'.\r The telpherage was a type of electrically run cable car, invented by Jenkin in 1882. He expected it to be a great success but unfortunately died before the first public line could be opened. Despite his work on the telpherage, Jenkin is not usually credited as the inventor of the cable car thanks to the work of Andrew Smith Hallidie in San Francisco some 10 years earlier. The first steam locomotive was made Richard Trevithick, the hot air ballon by the Montgolfier brothers and the electric G-Wiz by the Indian car company REVA. \n"}, {"text": "When traveling to remote lighthouses with his father in the late 1860s, Stevenson took little interest in the engineering work at hand, preferring to use the landscapes as inspiration for his fledgling writing career. In 1871 he informed his parents that he wanted to become a man of letters. Were his parents happy with their son's choice?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhile his parents were unhappy with his choice, it must have seemed somewhat inevitable given his behaviour at university. They made a compromise that he would study law as a backup should his work as an author prove fruitless. He qualified for the Scottish bar in 1875. \r Stevenson fell out with his parents in 1873 after his father discovered the constitution of a club of which he was a member. The opening statement of the constitution was \"Disregard everything our parents have taught us\", prompting his father to later declare \"You have rendered my whole life a failure\". This argument caused an extended rift between Stevenson and his father. \n"}, {"text": "Stevenson moved to London and mixed with many literary figures of the day, notably Andrew Lang and Edmund Gosse. He was also introduced to the influential poet and critic William Ernest Henley, author of the poem 'Invictus'. Henley had a wooden leg, and is thus often thought to be the inspiration for which of Stevenson's characters?", "correct": "Long John Silver", "options": ["David Balfour", "Jim Hawkins", "Edward Hyde"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLong John Silver.\n\n\tStevenson first met Henley at the Edinburgh Infirmary in 1875, where he was being treated for tuberculosis of the bone. He had already lost one leg in 1868 and was being treated by the antiseptic pioneer Joseph Lister in order to keep the other. Henley described his first impressions of Stevenson in his poem 'Apparition' - \"The brown eyes radiant with vivacity, there shines a brilliant and romantic grace\". They soon became good friends, collaborating on many plays throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Henley even secured the publication of 'Treasure Island' in 1883, his fatherlike figure mirrored in that of Long John Silver.They remained friends until the late 1880s, falling out in 1888 partly as a result of Henley's disdain for Stevenson's wife and partly because Stevenson did not wish to continue their collaboration. Henley outlived Stevenson, but was eventually defeated by his long struggle with tuberculosis in 1903. \n"}, {"text": "Stevenson first met his future wife, Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne, whist on a canoe trip in 1876. That trip was the inspiration for his first travelogue 'An Inland Voyage'. Through which two neighbouring countries did he travel?", "correct": "France and Belgium", "options": ["Italy and Germany", "Spain and Netherlands", "Poland and Sweden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrance and Belgium.\n\n\tStevenson loved to travel, and writing about your travels was a fantastic way to fund them. He frequently travelled across Europe with fellow Speculative Society alumnus Sir Walter Simpson, both to experience the culture and to try to improve his failing health. \r Whilst on the canoe voyage that inspired 'An Inland Voyage' Stevenson met the married American 'Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne' and subsequently wrote the essay 'On Falling in Love', inspired by the experience of their meeting. They soon became lovers and after Stevenson pursued Van de Grift back to the United States in 1879/80 (a treacherous journey, documented in 'The Amateur Emigrant') they were married. Stevenson wrote several other travelogues in his career, including 'Travels with a Donkey in the C\u00e9vennes' and 'The Silverado Squatters'. \n"}, {"text": "After his marriage in 1880, Stevenson spent seven uncomfortable years looking for a comfortable place to accommodate his health. Constantly moving between Scotland and England, he never failed to take inspiration from the places he lived. After which Dorset town did he name Jekyll's butler in the 1886 short story 'The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde'?", "correct": "Poole", "options": ["Christchurch", "Gillingham", "Bournemouth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoole.\n\n\tMr Poole is the faithful butler in 'The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde', showing his loyalty by not discussing his master's work. However, he eventually cracks, informing Dr Jekyll's good friend Utterson that he believes Jekyll to have been killed by Hyde and thus prompting a join investigation.\r Despite his illness during this period of his life, it was arguably Stevenson's most productive. Whilst moving around he managed to produce 'Treasure Island', 'Kidnapped' and 'The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde', as well as his most famous collection of poetry 'A Child's Garden of Verses'. Poole is the second largest town in Dorset after Bournemouth. \n"}, {"text": "Stevenson moved to the United States with his family in 1887, spending the winter at the peaceful village of Saranac Lake, New York in which mountain range?", "correct": "Adirondack Mountains", "options": ["Ozark Mountains", "Cascade Range", "Swan Range"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdirondack Mountains.\n\n\tDespite only staying at Saranac Lake for six months, it was another productive time for Stevenson. He wrote many articles, began serialising 'The Black Arrow' and wrote a large portion of 'The Master of Ballantrae'. Fanny went to California to pursue her own literary career (the aforementioned subject of Henley's contempt) while Stevenson spent time in New York before they reconvened for their greatest journey yet in June 1888.\r The Adirondacks are sometimes classed as a subrange of the Appalachians, though they are in fact geologically distinct. The Cascades are found in the Northwestern United States and British Columbia and contain both Mt St. Helens and Mt Rainer. The Swan Range is found further east in Montana, while the Ozarks are primarily in Missouri and Arkansas. \n"}, {"text": "Leaving San Francisco in June 1888, the family began a tour of the Pacific Islands. Stevenson travelled far and wide, but was particularly fond of spending time with David Kal\u0101kaua, the last king of which kingdom?", "correct": "Hawai'i", "options": ["Samoa", "Fiji", "Tuvalu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawai'i.\n\n\tDavid Kalakaua was the penultimate monarch of the Hawaiian kingdom, succeeded by his sister Lili\u02bbuokalani after his death in 1891. Stevenson was to spend the rest of his life in the South Pacific, rarely resting in one place for too long. He visited Australia and New Zealand in addition to many of the smaller island nations, eventually buying a plot of land in Samoa in 1890. He was present for large periods of the Samoan Civil War, lending his support to the vanquished Mata'afa against the German-backed King Laupepa. Stevenson took the native Samoan name 'Tusitala', aptly meaning \"teller of tales\".\r Stevenson took much inspiration from his travels, writing ballads and short stories based on the myths and legends of the cultures he visited. He also began collaborating with his stepson Lloyd Osbourne during this time, writing the three novels 'The Wrecker', 'The Ebb-Tide' and the title work of this quiz, 'The Wrong Box'. \n"}, {"text": "Robert Louis Stevenson collapsed and died aged just 44 in 1894, most likely suffering a cerebral haemorrhage. \"Gladly did I live, and gladly die\" is a line from which appropriately titled Stevenson poem, inscribed on his gravestone on Mt Vaea in Samoa?", "correct": "Requiem", "options": ["Do not go Gentle into that Good Night", "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard", "Because I Could not Stop for Death"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRequiem.\n\n\tThis is the full poem:\r Under the wide and starry sky\rDig the grave and let me lie:\rGladly did I live, and gladly die,\rAnd I laid me down with a will.\r This be the verse you 'grave for me:\rHere he lies where he long'd to be;\rHome is the sailor, home from the sea,\rAnd the hunter home from the hill. \n"}]}
