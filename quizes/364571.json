{"id": "364571", "name": "One Too Many Quiz | Health and Human Biology | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " Health and Human Biology", "Diseases"], "questions": [{"text": "What of the following would be a proper name for the disorder often known as \"punch-drunk\" syndrome?", "correct": "Pugilistica dementia", "options": ["Lewy body dementia", "Vascular dementia", "Alzheimers dementia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPugilistica dementia.\n\n\tPugilistica dementia or Dementia pugilistica is the result of the repeated concussions often suffered by boxers. It is seen in other sports also, but is most closely associated with pugilism (boxing). This neurodegenerative disorder is estimated to affect 15-20% of all professional boxers. Common symptoms include memory loss, lack of coordination, speech problems, and Parkinsonism.The sufferer may also experience outbursts of anger, jealousy, and paranoia. The exact pathology of this disorder is still under study, and it is thought that genetics may play a small role in predisposing an athlete to this disorder.Some of the boxers who are thought to have suffered from this disorder include Meldrick Taylor, Sugar Ray Robinson and Joe Frazier, just to name a few. All it takes is being punched one too many times. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following options is a common sign of alcohol poisoning? ", "correct": "Hypothermia", "options": ["Deafness", "Edema", "Loss of Hair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHypothermia.\n\n\tAlcohol poisoning can happen to anyone and is different from alcoholism which is a chronic disorder. The symptoms of alcohol poisoning are hypothermia, slow or irregular breathing, bluish skin or lips, vomiting, and seizures. Acute alcohol poisoning can lead to coma, permanent brain damage and death. Rapid binge drinking is especially dangerous because the person can drink a lethal amount of alcohol before they become unconscious. All it takes is consuming one too many drinks. \n"}, {"text": "The phenomena known as 'roid rage' can be exhibited by which of the following groups of people if they use too many anabolic steroids?", "correct": "Anyone taking anabolic steroids can exhibit these symptoms", "options": ["Menopausal women", "Middle-aged men", "Teenage boys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnyone taking anabolic steroids can exhibit these symptoms.\n\n\tTaking too many anabolic steroids affects anyone who takes them, male or female, young or old. There are legitimate medical issues that are treated with these compounds, such as delayed puberty and growth disorders. But that majority of people who take anabolic steroids are young to middle-aged males who may not realize the negative affects caused by their usage.These include reduced sperm count, shrinkage of the testicles, hair loss, rage, mania, and psychosis. Both men or women who use anabolic steroids raise their chance of heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, liver disease and cancer. While taking steroids may help young men grow more muscle at a faster rate, the effects later in life can be catastrophic to their health.Unless prescribed by your physician, taking even one dose of anabolic steroids is one dose too many. \n"}, {"text": "If you are exposed to freezing temperatures for too long and develop frostbite, you run the risk of having to have frozen parts amputated due to which necrotic condition? ", "correct": "Gangrene", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGangrene.\n\n\tBeing caught outside in freezing weather for too long can lead to frostbite, especially of the fingers and toes. Extreme frostbite can also lead to gangrene in the affected areas, which can cause amputation to become necessary. Most frostbite is not this severe and can be successfully treated by a physician with no long lasting affects. As cold causes numbness it can sometimes be hard to tell when you have been outside for too long. \n"}, {"text": "Spending too much time working in a coal mine can cause which of the following disorders?", "correct": "Coal workers' Pneumoconiosis", "options": ["Coal workers'  Hansen's Disease", "Coal workers'  Cystic Fibrosis", "Coal workers'  Synesthesia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoal workers' Pneumoconiosis.\n\n\tPneumoconiosis, also known as black lung disease, is caused by the inhalation of coal dust and is commonly seen in coal miners. The inhaled coal progressively builds up in the lungs coating them in a distinctive blue-black graphite dust. Pneumoconiosis usually does not appear until after 10 years of exposure and is treatable, but incurable at this time.The build up of coal dust causes bronchitis, coughing spasms, emphysema, and loss of the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen once fibrosis sets in. Pneumoconiosis is also related to rheumatoid arthritis and possibly cancer formation. Too much coal dust is definitely not good for anyone's health. \n"}, {"text": "Eating just one too many pieces of moldy rye bread can cause which of the following?", "correct": "Ergotism", "options": ["Altruism", "Hirsutism", "Robotism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErgotism.\n\n\tAlso known as Saint Anthony's Fire, ergot poisoning is caused by the consumption of the 'Claviceps purpurea' fungus, which is usually found on rye or other cereals. Ergot poisoning causes painful muscle contractions, spasms, diarrhea, psychosis, seizures and even gangrene. There have been epidemics of this disorder throughout history and it has been put forth as a possible cause of behaviors that were thought to be caused by demons or witches.Ergot poisoning is not as common today as it once was, but does still occur. This disorder has been put forth as a possible cause that led up to the Salem witch trials.Just one piece of moldy rye bread, is one piece too many. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these people would be most likely to have an attack of decompression sickness?", "correct": "A deep sea diver", "options": ["A high-wire walker", "A gold miner", "A basketball player"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA deep sea diver.\n\n\tRising to the surface too quickly can cause a deep sea diver to develop decompression sickness, also known as the bends. The bends is caused by the formation of nitrogen gas bubbles which block blood flow and disrupt both blood vessels and nerves by stretching and sometimes tearing them. Feelings of something crawling on and inside the skin occur when gas bubbles form under the skin.Bubble formation in the brain or spine carries a much worse prognosis including paralysis or death. It should be noted that this situation occurs in astronauts also, as they are exposed to great changes in pressure. Treatment for this affliction is hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber.Any rapid change of pressure can be too much; slow and steady wins this race. \n"}, {"text": "The neurological syndrome known as Minamata disease is caused by overexposure to which of the following substances?", "correct": "Mercury", "options": ["Sodium", "Chlorophyll", "Oxygen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercury.\n\n\tFirst described in 1956, in Minamata, Japan, this disorder is a form of mercury poisoning. It was caused by the systematic release of methylmercury into the water system of the city by a local chemical plant for over 35 years. The first symptoms are usually numbness, ataxia, muscle weakness, and loss of hearing, speech and vision abilities. Continued exposure will cause progressive paralysis, loss of consciousness and then death. Mercury is an extremely toxic substance that can cause a multitude of symptoms if someone is exposed to it. Any contact with mercury is too much contact. \n"}, {"text": "Korsakoff's syndrome is caused by eating too much liver and onions.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis is totally false, Korsakoff's syndrome is caused by a lack of thiamine which is usually associated with severe malnutrition or chronic alcoholism. Symptoms include amnesia, memory loss, confabulation and apathy. Korsakoff's can also involve hemorrhage and loss of neurons. Korsakoff's syndrome usually leads to the need of full-time care, but breakthroughs in the field of medicine may lead to a better prognosis for some sufferers. The effects of one too many drinks, one too many times, can ruin your life. \n"}, {"text": "Although unusual, hypervitaminosis is usually caused by the ingestion of too many vitamin supplements.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tHypervitaminosis is basically and overdose of vitamins. It is very rarely caused by over-consumption of food but is instead caused by taking too many vitamin and mineral supplements. The symptoms vary according to which vitamin or mineral has reach too high a level. Death can occur, but is not common. Hypervitaminosis is usually an overabundance of fat-soluble rather water-soluble vitamins.High levels of vitamin A can lead to hair loss, osteoporosis and intracranial hypertension. Excess vitamin D can lead to calcification of bones, and soft tissue organs such as the heart and kidneys. Excessive levels of vitamin E can lead to excessive bleeding, hypothyroidism, and blotchy skin.Take only the recommended dose on the bottle, as too many vitamin and mineral tablets is not good for your health. \n"}]}
