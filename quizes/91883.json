{"id": "91883", "name": "This Quiz Stinks! | General | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun"], "questions": [{"text": "The 'Titan Arum' could very well emit the most repugnant smell of any plant known to humankind.  What is the nickname of this putrid flower?  \n", "correct": "Corpse flower", "options": ["Fecal flower", "Skunk flower", "Armpit flower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorpse flower.\n\n\tThe corpse flower, also known by its scientific name 'Amorphophallus titanium' (a very suggestive Latin name, I must say!), is found on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia.  Aside from being the world's stinkiest flower, it is also in competition as the world's largest flower species, sometimes growing up to 7 feet high.  The suffocating smell it produces is meant to attract flies and beetles, which will then carry its pollen to distant areas, spreading the species. \n"}, {"text": "'Acrosternum hilare' and 'Euschistus servus' are two types of stink bugs which are found in North America, but what are the common names of these two species? \n", "correct": "Green stink bug and brown stink bug", "options": ["Red stink bug and yellow stink bug", "Hippo stink bug and rhino stink bug", "Wolf stink bug and fox stink bug"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen stink bug and brown stink bug.\n\n\tStink bugs are little shield shaped characters that come in several colors, but most frequently brown and green as their names suggest.  They are fond of the same sorts of fruits and vegetables that humans are and thus are considered major agricultural pests.  They do emit a rank odor which earns them their olid nickname...whatever you do, don't touch these little fellows...they'll make your fingers stink! \n"}, {"text": "Our cars, trucks and other vehicles most often run on something we call 'gasoline'.  With a perfectly working vehicle (that is, one that is properly tuned) which of these compound pairs make up two of the end products of the expended gasoline?", "correct": "Carbon dioxide and water", "options": ["Oxygen and methane", "Carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide", "Ammonia and ozone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarbon dioxide and water.\n\n\tNitrous oxide is a third.  Gasoline is actually a mixture of various hydrocarbons and other oxygenated organic compounds which is produced from petroleum.  Although most people have an aversion to gasoline smell, oddly some people find the smell pleasant...which is not a good thing considering that the fusty fumes are quite noxious.  By the way...to remove that smell from your clothes, add some vinegar to your clothes washer! \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  Field Pennycress, aka stinkweed, is edible to human beings.  \n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOther plants have also been given the nickname 'stinkweed' but Field Pennycress, aka Thlaspi arvense, is probably the most well-known of the frowsy bunch.  Native to North America, it has been cultivated in other regions of the world, sometimes for human consumption.  This stuff is said to be bitter, but, like baby greens is more palatable at a young age.  When cows consume stinkweed you can tell...by tasting their milk, it will be bitter! \n"}, {"text": "One of the key sources for malodorous emanations is the human body, and especially the eccrine sweat glands to be found in the armpits and other key spots.  When these glands aren't working properly, that is when we suffer from a sweat deficiency, we are suffering from which of these conditions?  \n", "correct": "Hypohidrosis", "options": ["Hyperhidrosis", "Diaphoresis", "Antiperspirosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHypohidrosis.\n\n\tHypohidrosis is a very dangerous condition, caused by things such as heat stroke and excessive diarrhea.  Frankly, I'd rather bear the empyreumatic scents of my exuding perspiration than to brook an episode of heatstroke! \n"}, {"text": "Speaking of fulsome emissions from human bodies, some people suffer from a disease called trimethylaminuria which causes their bodies to create an insufferable odor.  By what other name is this syndrome known? ", "correct": "Fish odor syndrome", "options": ["Stinky armpit syndrome", "Sewer smell syndrome", "Toxic fume syndrome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFish odor syndrome.\n\n\tBelieve it or not, trimethylaminuria aka fish odor syndrome is a real disease that fortunately only affects a very small number of people.  People who suffer from this disorder may not exactly smell like fish (the smells can be variable) but they most certainly will emit a fustiness which can be akin to the suffocating scent of festering sea life.  This is because the key chemical which people with this disease produce excessively, called trimethylamine, is also found in aging fish. \n"}, {"text": "Since humans are so stinky I couldn't resist one more question on us.  Which of these is another term for 'bad breath'?  \n", "correct": "Halitosis", "options": ["Poliosis", "Brachiosis", "Scoliosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalitosis.\n\n\tHalitosis can be caused by several factors such as tooth and gum disorders, tobacco and alcohol use, excessive consumption of garlic and onions and poor dental hygiene.  Some people suffer from specific disorders that cause bad breath, in which case no amount of brushing can help alleviate the symptoms.  In such cases chewing Dentyne or Trident might help! \n"}, {"text": "Possibly the stinkiest fruit on Earth, it is very commonly consumed in the various countries of southeast Asia.  What is this large, spiky and nidorous fruit called?  \n", "correct": "Durian", "options": ["Rambutan", "Breadfruit", "Longan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDurian.\n\n\tThough the outside of a durian appears dangerous and smells awful, the innards are quite edible and rather sweet when ripe.  One can always tell when one passes by a durian stand in Asia, the smell is quite recognizable!  In some places such as Singapore it has been made illegal to carry a durian on the subway...a 500 dollar fine could result from breaking this law. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following chemical compounds is most likely responsible for what we like to call the 'rotten egg smell' sometimes coming from the water faucet?  \n", "correct": "Hydrogen sulphide", "options": ["Ammonium nitrate", "Calcium carbonate", "Magnesium hydroxide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHydrogen sulphide.\n\n\tHydrogen Sulphide (H2S) is extremely poisonous, so please notify the proper authorities if you smell an excessive amount of this rotten egg smell.  Luckily our noses can detect H2S at a level much lower than is dangerous so we can usually smell it coming, but be mindful of it when you do detect a whiff of it...your nose can quickly become accustomed to the fetor. \n"}, {"text": "True or false:  Methane has a particularly putrid stench. \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually methane is quite odorless.  Methane is the simplest of the hydrocarbons, and is the first member of the alkane series (CH4).  While methane is odorless it is highly flammable...so keep it away from open flames!  If you're wondering then why fecal matter smells so bad, it's as a result of all that bacteria in there and the various chemicals they produce. \n"}, {"text": "This creature, with the scientific name 'Gulo gulo', has scent glands which can produce a particularly fulsome smell.  Name it!", "correct": "Wolverine", "options": ["Yak", "Panda", "Macaque"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWolverine.\n\n\tWolverines are one of the largest members of the Mustelidae (weasel) family.  They are tough creatures which can bring down prey much larger than themselves and are willing to fight with larger predators over territory and fresh kills.  Wolverines are also known as 'skunk bears'...for the stripes across their backs that resemble skunks, and for the nasty scent that they emit from their scent glands.  Watch out! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these words would best be used to describe a skunk, as it shares the root of the skunk's genus and species?  \n", "correct": "Mephitic", "options": ["Empyreuma", "Malodorous", "Repugnant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMephitic.\n\n\tMephitis mephitis is the genus and species of the skunk, 'mephitic' means poisonous or foul smelling...the terms are from the Latin.  Like wolverines, skunks have little scent glands that do their dirty work for them. \n"}, {"text": "We mostly associate this creature with a cartoon character, but it has been noted that it issues an extremely fulsome odor when threatened.  Which of these fun cartoon characters wouldn't be so fun to smell?  \n", "correct": "Tasmanian devil", "options": ["Wile E. Coyote", "Roadrunner", "Pink panther"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTasmanian devil.\n\n\tThe Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) or 'Tassie' (aka 'Taz') is a wily little creature from the Australian state of Tasmania who probably smells worse than Pepe LePew, when stressed.  If you are ever to have one in your home, be sure to purchase an air freshener or 6! \n"}, {"text": "In Taiwan and China there is a special dish that the locals love and the tourists notice...immediately.  This dish is frequently sold at street corners and emits a scent that can only be described as urine-like.  What is this rancid-smelling stuff?  \n", "correct": "Stinky tofu", "options": ["Foul guinea fowl", "Rancid radishes", "Stench stuffing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStinky tofu.\n\n\tStinky tofu (chou doufu) is definitely an acquired taste.  Every person who has ever visited Taiwan or Hong Kong most certainly became familiar with the repugnant odor, and some have even been daring enough to take a bite of the graveolent concoction.  The tofu is cooked in a sort of brine solution, but I have yet to discover the secret of the stink! \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the stinkiest of all the stinky cheeses is this German cheese that is cured with a salt brine in a two month process and contains a healthy dose of the bacteria 'Brevibacterium linens'.  What is this lovely cheese called?  \n", "correct": "Limburger", "options": ["Emmental", "Tilsit", "Edam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLimburger.\n\n\tLimburger is a soft cheese that might best be enjoyed from a distance!  Its suffocating smell is only challenged by its robust flavor, which should be experienced by all cheese lovers everywhere! \n"}]}
