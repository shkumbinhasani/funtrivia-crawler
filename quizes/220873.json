{"id": "220873", "name": "Top Movies of 1990 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1990s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "Which actor-turned-director stunned the film world with his incredibly beautiful film 'Dances with Wolves' in 1990?", "correct": "Kevin Costner", "options": ["Tom Selleck", "Burt Reynolds", "Clint Eastwood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin Costner.\n\n\tI think it's fair to say that nobody expected Kevin Costner (a popular actor to be sure but not imagined to be an auteur) to give birth to such a wonderfully filmed masterpiece, as 'Dances with Wolves' happened to be.  With Kevin being joined by actors such as Graham Greene, Mary McDonnell and Rodney Grant, the film cleaned up at both the box office and the Oscar ceremony the following spring, taking home awards for both Best Picture and Best Director. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite French films of the 1990s was 'Cyrano de Bergerac', a colorful rendition by director Jean-Paul Rappeneau of the classic play by Edmond Rostand.  Which flamboyant French actor played the lead role of Cyrano in this excellent film?", "correct": "G\u00e9rard Depardieu", "options": ["Marcel Dalio", "Jacques Copeau", "Jean Reno"], "explanation": "\n\n\nG\u00e9rard Depardieu.\n\n\tLike or dislike Mr. Depardieu, one cannot deny that he makes a fitting Cyrano in this film.  Alongside the inimitable G\u00e9rard appear Vincent Perez as Christian and Anne Brochet as Roxane.  Incidentally, Cyrano de Bergerac is a real person who lived and wrote beautiful poetry during the 17th century. \n"}, {"text": "Which hard hitting gangster film did Martin Scorsese direct and Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta star in during the fruitful film year of 1990?", "correct": "Goodfellas", "options": ["Casino", "The Godfather, Part III", "Donnie Brasco"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoodfellas.\n\n\tFor many, 'Goodfellas' is simply the greatest crime drama of all-time (I have it in my top five).  The film, essentially a biographical story of mob informant Henry Hill, features some of the best lines in film history.  Particularly amusing are Joe Pesci's rants, including the famous 'You think I'm funny?' scene. \n"}, {"text": "'Misery' is one of the entertaining, and wildly disturbing, films of 1990.  Kathy Bates provides the performance of her lifetime, and James Caan supplies the perfect foil for her character.  After whose book was this film adapted?", "correct": "Stephen King", "options": ["Susan Sontag", "H. P. Lovecraft", "Clive Barker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStephen King.\n\n\tRob Reiner masterfully directed this film that features an excellent screenplay by William Goldman.  The movie contains some of the most utterly disturbing moments in cinematic history, particularly the scene where Kathy Bates wields a sledgehammer and...I can't even go on!  See the film at your own peril! \n"}, {"text": "If I am allowed some indulgence, one of the most entertaining and underrated films of all-time slid quietly through theaters in 1990.  It featured Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward as factotums living meaningless lives in a tiny town in the middle of a desert.  Their lives permanently change when large, wormlike creatures are suddenly discovered living right underfoot.  What is the name of this quirky classic?", "correct": "Tremors", "options": ["Night Breed", "Sand Worms", "Desert Peril"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTremors.\n\n\t'Tremors' may not come to mind when one thinks of the greatest film classics of all-time, but certainly it deserves some recognition as one of the most inventive horror films ever produced.  If Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward don't amuse you with their slapstick performances, try Michael Gross (of 'Family Ties') and Reba McEntire (yes, the country singer) as a couple holed up in a survivalist compound in the middle of nowhere.  Please don't be intimidated by the 'horror' label, this film is funny, good natured and even contains a light-hearted love story. \n"}, {"text": "Among their many masterpieces, perhaps 'Miller's Crossing' is the most visually appealing.  Which director/producer pair came up with this lovely and well-acted gangster film of 1990?", "correct": "The Coen Brothers", "options": ["James Ivory and Ismail Merchant", "The Farrelly Brothers", "Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Coen Brothers.\n\n\tSurperb acting by Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden and John Turturro really makes this film work.  Oh yes, let's not forget the fabulous direction of the Coen Brothers, and the lovely cinematography of Barry Sonnenfeld.  The film was loosely based on a pair of novels by Dashiell Hammett called 'Red Harvest' and 'Glass Key'. \n"}, {"text": "Another great film from the non-English speaking world in 1990 was the dark comedy 'Europa Europa'.  Though most of the dialog from this lovely movie was in German, its filming locations were primarily in which former Eastern Bloc country?", "correct": "Poland", "options": ["Romania", "Russia", "Bulgaria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoland.\n\n\tDirected by Agnieszka Holland, 'Europa Europa' is about a young Jewish man who, thanks to his perfect German, is able to pass as German during the darkest days of the Nazi occupation of Poland.  The film features some rather funny moments, if you like gallows humor, along with some darkly disturbing scenes.  Fans of Julie Delpy will especially want to have a look. \n"}, {"text": "Another non-English language film, this time 'Ju Dou' by legendary film auteur Zhang Yimou.  In which country does this wonderfully colorful film take place?", "correct": "China", "options": ["Japan", "Korea", "Vietnam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChina.\n\n\t'Ju Dou' is one of Zhang Yimou's earliest films.  It displays the director's wonderful penchant for color and lighting, and shows off the acting skills of Li Gong, among others.  It's the story of an illicit love affair between an unhappy wife of a dye-factory owner and the factory-owner's nephew.  The rest of the plot I will leave for you to discover. \n"}, {"text": "Tim Burton was busy in 1990, directing and producing one of his signature films, this one about a strange young man who, because of his physical deformities (and social incapablity), is unable to fit in happily with the rest of society.  We are of course talking about which film?", "correct": "Edward Scissorhands", "options": ["Beetlejuice", "Ed Wood", "Pee Wee's Big Adventure"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdward Scissorhands.\n\n\tOkay, so this question was relatively easy, so be it!  \r Johnny Depp supplies one of his typically quirky performances, only uttering 169 words in the entire film.  Wynona Rider is compelling, Dianne Wiest is motherly and Anthony Michael Hall is surprisingly menacing in this very strange but effective film by the mercurial Tim Burton. \n"}, {"text": "One of the big blockbuster films of 1990 also happened to be among the years best.  Directed by John McTiernan, 'The Hunt for Red October' featured some compelling performances by its lead actors.  Perhaps the most interesting performance came from which actor, who portrayed the Russian submarine captain Marko Ramius?", "correct": "Sean Connery", "options": ["Michael Caine", "Roger Moore", "Anthony Hopkins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Connery.\n\n\tIf Sean Connery isn't your cup of tea, try Alec Baldwin, or Scott Glenn, or perhaps Sam Neill, or maybe James Earl Jones.  Okay, you get the point.  Combine an all-star cast, a reliable blockbuster-producing director, a story by Tom Clancy and you will likely have the recipe for success.  Even the supporting cast, including Tim Curry, Peter Firth, Jeffrey Jones and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd provide additional flair.\r I hope you have enjoyed this quiz.  Let me know which choices you agreed or disagreed with.  Provide me with your personal choices, I'm always in the mood.  Thanks for playing! \n"}]}
