It features marvelous performances by Bogart and Rod Steiger, and also features appearances by real-life boxers Max Baer and Jersey Joe Walcott.  I strongly recommend it! \n"}, {"text": "Daniel Day-Lewis and Emily Watson star in which 1997 film about a political prisoner in Northern Ireland who, after being released from prison, attempts to form a life away from politics by opening a boxing gym?", "correct": "The Boxer", "options": ["The Grass Arena", "Body and Soul", "Golden Gloves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Boxer.\n\n\tNot exactly the film to watch if one is seeking big laughs, 'The Boxer' is a rough tale that lends a glimmer of hope.

Oddly enough, though the film is set in Belfast, it was filmed in Dublin. \n"}, {"text": "What is the title of the Martin Ritt-directed film featuring James Earl Jones in the role of a boxer very much resembling the great Jack Johnson from the early 20th century?", "correct": "Great White Hope", "options": ["Fighting Champ", "Golden Boy", "Split Decisions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreat White Hope.\n\n\tJames Earl Jones is Jack Jefferson, a Jack-Johnsonesque black boxing contender who must deal with the racism of his era, a racism that is especially onerous since he has fallen in love with a white woman.

Which notable film director was in charge of this fascinating morality tale?", "correct": "Robert Wise", "options": ["Billy Wilder", "Orson Welles", "William Wyler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Wise.\n\n\tOne of the most intriguing things about 'The Set-Up' was the fact that it was filmed in real time, with a total of 72 minutes in the life of boxer Stoker Thompson (Ryan) passing right before the viewer's eyes. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the boxing wunderkind played by the Academy Award-winning Hilary Swank in the outstanding 2004 boxing film 'Million Dollar Baby'?", "correct": "Maggie Fitzgerald", "options": ["Erica Mack", "Mickie Chait", "Julianne Barry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaggie Fitzgerald.\n\n\tHilary Swank was expertly directed by Clint Eastwood in 'Million Dollar Baby', a film that also garnered Eastwood a Best Director Oscar, and Morgan Freeman an award for Best Supporting Actor.

Jackson", "Tim Roth", "Ving Rhames"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBruce Willis.\n\n\tBruce Willis is the palooka in question.
