{"id": "103924", "name": "Love, Hate, and Death in \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" Online Quiz | Movies | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", " The Talented Mr. Ripley"], "questions": [{"text": "Whom does Tom Ripley love?", "correct": "Dickie and Peter", "options": ["Meredith", "Marge and Silvana", "Freddie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDickie and Peter.\n\n\tTom is gay, obviously. The movie is saved from being anti-gay by the Peter Smith-Kingsley character, who is perhaps the most likeable person in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Whom does Dickie love (sexually)?", "correct": "Marge for sure, and probably Silvana, too", "options": ["Freddie", "Tom", "Meredith for sure, and probably Marge, too"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarge for sure, and probably Silvana, too.\n\n\tEven though he mistreats both women, Dickie does seem to love them. He seems to love his men friends (fleetingly sometimes), too, but Dickie is not gay. \n"}, {"text": "Whom does Meredith love?", "correct": "Tom (posing as Dickie)", "options": ["Freddie (posing as a nice person)", "Dickie (posing as Tom)", "Peter (posing as a heterosexual)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom (posing as Dickie).\n\n\tMeredith falls for \"Dickie\" (Tom) partly because she thinks they are two peas in a pod--spoiled rich kids who despise their wealthy families but can't live without their wealth and position. Ironically, Tom isn't like this at all (plus, he's gay). \n"}, {"text": "Whom does Freddie love?", "correct": "himself, primarily, and some woman in Rome, possibly", "options": ["Marge and Silvana", "Tom", "Peter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhimself, primarily, and some woman in Rome, possibly.\n\n\tFreddie seems very full of himself. Of course, he doesn't quite deserve to have his head bashed in with a stone bust. At one point he mentions that he has a lover in Rome. \n"}, {"text": "Whom does Peter love?", "correct": "Tom", "options": ["Freddie", "Marge", "Meredith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom.\n\n\tIt's Peter's misfortune that he falls in love with Tom (who's psychotic, presumeably). \n"}, {"text": "What does Marge love most about Dickie?", "correct": "He's very tender to her \"when their heads are on the pillow.\"", "options": ["She loves how serious, reliable, and faithful he is.", "She loves the way he plays jazz drums and saxophone.", "She loves him for his wealth and position in society."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's very tender to her \"when their heads are on the pillow.\"\n\n\tPlus he's handsome, charming, and seems to love her, too. \n"}, {"text": "Whom does Tom hate, and why?", "correct": "Freddie, because he is jealous of F's friendship with Dickie", "options": ["Meredith, because she keeps following him around", "Peter, because he is jealous of P's friendship with Marge", "Peter, because Tom hates everyone who loves him"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreddie, because he is jealous of F's friendship with Dickie.\n\n\tViewers have to admit that Freddie is not at all likeable. He's a loud-mouthed, self-important, snobbish jerk. He teases Tom, too, which is one reason he ends up dead. (I'm not condoning murder, of course!) \n"}, {"text": "Whom does Peter hate, and why?", "correct": "No one that we know of", "options": ["Marge, because he's jealous of her relationship with Dickie", "Freddie, for the same reason everyone hates F", "Tom, because he knows T is planning to kill him"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo one that we know of.\n\n\tLike I said, Peter is the most sympathetic character in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "When does Marge START feeling suspicious of Tom (probably)?", "correct": "during their meetings in Rome and Venice", "options": ["as soon as she meets him", "when Tom gives her the perfume from Dickie", "only after Tom cuts his hand on the razor in his pocket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nduring their meetings in Rome and Venice.\n\n\tWhen Marge first sees the new, spiffed-up Tom in Rome, she probably starts to wonder, subconsciously, if he's up to something. She grows more and more sure of this as time goes by, though she can never quite figure out what Tom has done. (Who could? He's a master criminal.) \n"}, {"text": "Why does Freddie dislike Tom?", "correct": "He resents Tom and Dickie's  friendship.", "options": ["He is envious of Tom's musical talent.", "He is jealous of Tom's relationship with Marge.", "He is jealous of Tom's relationship with Meredith."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe resents Tom and Dickie's  friendship.\n\n\tHe also thinks Tom is a low-class mooch (and he isn't exactly wrong). Even though Tom is evil, viewers find themselves sympathizing with him when it comes to Freddie. \n"}, {"text": "What causes Silvana's death?", "correct": "Dickie gets her pregnant and she drowns herself.", "options": ["She accidently drowns while out in a boat with Dickie.", "Her fiance kills her when he finds out she is pregnant.", "Dickie kills her to hide her pregnancy from Marge."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDickie gets her pregnant and she drowns herself.\n\n\tBeing an unmarried mom in a staunchly Catholic country in the 1950s was no joke. Even in the U.S. it would have been a tragedy. \n"}, {"text": "Which best describes Tom's first murder?", "correct": "He bludgeons Dickie to death in a motorboat. The murder is not premeditated.", "options": ["In an act of premeditated murder, he drowns Dickie off the Italian coast.", "Dickie is blackmailing Tom. Reluctantly, Tom kills him to shut him up.", "Dickie reveals his marriage plans and Tom bludgeons him to death in a fit of jealousy."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe bludgeons Dickie to death in a motorboat. The murder is not premeditated.\n\n\tThe two get into a fight after Dickie tells Tom he does not want to be friends with T anymore. Dickie begins taunting Tom, and one thing leads to another. \n"}, {"text": "Why does Tom pretend to be Dickie?", "correct": "for all of these reasons", "options": ["to cover up the fact that he murdered Dickie", "so he can finally live a  high-class life", "so he can get hold of Dickie's money"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfor all of these reasons.\n\n\tTom starts pretending to be Dickie even before he meets him (when Tom first meets Meredith at the baggage claim area). In fact, from the very beginning he pretends he went to Princeton (or doesn't deny it when Dickie's parents assume he did). Tom is ashamed of being just plain Tom Ripley, piano tuner and men's restroom attendant. He adores the classy, cultured trappings that wealthy people enjoy. \n"}, {"text": "How does Tom charm Dickie?", "correct": "by doing all of these things", "options": ["by pretending to like jazz", "by mimicking Dickie's dad", "by showing how much he likes Dickie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nby doing all of these things.\n\n\tIn fact, Tom falls in love with Dickie. \n"}, {"text": "Why is Marge kind to Tom (before Dickie's disappearance)?", "correct": "All of these are true.", "options": ["He can be funny and charming.", "She feels sorry for him.", "He doesn't seem to  threaten her relationship with Dickie."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these are true.\n\n\tLittle does she know that two-faced Tom calls her \"the Marge problem.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which best describes Tom's second murder?", "correct": "It's premeditated, but it might not have happened if Freddie had not  been so persistent.", "options": ["It's unpremeditated. Tom kills Freddie in a fit of rage when F ruins his new piano.", "It's premeditated. Tom kills Freddie because F has found out that T killed Dickie.", "It's an accident. Tom accidently drops a heavy object on Freddie's head."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's premeditated, but it might not have happened if Freddie had not  been so persistent.\n\n\tFreddie wants to find Dickie, and he's annoyed when Tom says D isn't home. Freddie is also annoyed to find Tom still around at all. If Freddie had simply gone away, Tom probably wouldn't have killed him, but F finds out from the landlady that \"Dickie\" IS home. Who knows if Freddie actually puts two and two together and figures out that Tom is posing as Dickie. \n"}, {"text": "Which describes the last murder Tom commits (in this movie, anyway)?", "correct": "Tom kills Peter to prevent a meeting between P and Meredith", "options": ["Tom kills Peter because T, a bisexual, has decided he would rather be with Meredith.", "Tom kills Peter in anger when P makes a fuss about Meredith.", "Tom kills Peter simply because their relationship has become boring."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom kills Peter to prevent a meeting between P and Meredith.\n\n\tWhen Tom meets Meredith onboard the ship, he realizes he'll have to kill Peter because M still believes he is Dickie. If Peter finds out that Tom has been posing as Dickie, he'll figure out that Tom killed Freddie and Dickie. Whew! Tom is really sad about killing Peter, though. Peter certainly deserved better! \n"}, {"text": "What do Tom and Peter have in common besides their sexual preference?", "correct": "They both love classical music.", "options": ["They are both in love with Meredith.", "They both love jazz.", "They are both close friends with Marge."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey both love classical music.\n\n\tAfter Tom kills Dickie, he reverts back to his love of classical piano. Peter is apparently in Italy to study and perform classical works. Unlike most of the young Americans (Dickie, Freddie, and co.) Peter seems to be a serious, hardworking person. \n"}, {"text": "Which actress is NOT in this movie?", "correct": "Penelope Cruz", "options": ["Gwyneth Paltrow", "Cate Blanchett", "Stefania Rocca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPenelope Cruz.\n\n\tGwyneth plays Marge, Cate plays Meredith, and beautiful Stefania Rocca plays Silvana. Penelope Cruz was in \"Vanilla Sky\" with boyfriend Tom Cruise. \n"}, {"text": "Which actor is NOT in this movie?", "correct": "Ben Affleck", "options": ["Matt Damon", "Phillip Seymour Hoffman", "Jude Law"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen Affleck.\n\n\tMatt Damon plays Tom (a departure for the hunky star, who reportedly bulked down for the role), Jude Law plays Dickie (beautifully, in my opinion), and Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the hateful Freddie excruciatingly well. Ben Affleck is Damon's screenwriting partner and longtime friend from Massachusetts. They co-wrote and co-starred in \"Good Will Hunting\" which won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and rocketed both writer/actors to stardom. Affleck was also in \"Shakespeare in Love\" and \"Pearl Harbor.\" \n"}]}
