{"id": "338002", "name": "Animal Farm Quiz | What Animal Am I? | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "Animals for Kids", "What Animal Am I?"], "questions": [{"text": "The first animal you'll see on my animal farm is a type of ape.  It has reddish-orange fur all over its body, and it sleeps in trees.  What kind of ape is this?", "correct": "Orangutan", "options": ["Baboon", "Bonobo", "Gorilla"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrangutan.\n\n\tAn orangutan has long orange fur and it climbs and sleeps in trees.  The word \"orangutan\" comes from the Malay and means \"man of the forest\". \n"}, {"text": "The next kind of animal you'll see on my farm is a type of turtle that lives on the land.  Which of these turtles/tortoises lives mainly on the land?", "correct": "Galapagos tortoise", "options": ["Leatherback turtle", "Painted turtle", "Snapping turtle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGalapagos tortoise.\n\n\tTortoises are also called \"land turtles\".  This is because they live on the land.  Turtles, however, live mainly in the water (though they are born on the land).\r Of course, some of these water turtles can also be found on land.  Snapping turtles are turtles that can live on both water and land. \n"}, {"text": "On my farm, you can see many kinds of birds, but none of them can fly.  Which of these birds actually can fly?", "correct": "Chicken", "options": ["Cassowary", "Penguin", "Ostrich"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChicken.\n\n\tThough many think that chickens cannot fly, this is not true.  Chickens can fly, but not very far.  A chicken's flight is more like a paraglider than a plane; it can go pretty far, but it does land much sooner because its wings cannot keep it up for very long. \n"}, {"text": "You can see many camelids in my zoo as well.  A camelid can include camels, but which of these is not a camelid?", "correct": "Antelope", "options": ["Alpaca", "Llama", "Vicuna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAntelope.\n\n\tLlamas, alpacas, vicunas, and guanacos are all in the same class as the dromedary and bactrian camels, which is the camelid family.  The antelope is related to the camel because it is an even-toed ungulate, which means it has a hoof with two toes, but it is not a camelid. \n"}, {"text": "I have an entire herd of caribou on my animal farm.  What kind of deer is a caribou?", "correct": "Reindeer", "options": ["White-tailed deer", "Elk", "Moose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReindeer.\n\n\tCaribou and reindeer are one in the same.  Though reindeer are often thought of as make-believe flying animals that Santa uses for his sleigh, they actually do exist!  However, reindeer cannot actually fly, and they don't have red lighted noses, either. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite animals that you can see on my farm is an ai.  It is a very slow-moving animal that lives in the trees of South America.  What kind of animal is an ai?", "correct": "Sloth", "options": ["Koala", "Red-eyed tree frog", "Possum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSloth.\n\n\tAn ai is a type of three-toed sloth.  Sloths move very slowly; so slowly that sometimes they even grow algae in their fur.  Their fur is also unique because it goes up on their body as opposed to down like most other animals.  Sid from \"Ice Age\" is a sloth (though he moves pretty fast). \n"}, {"text": "I love my pack of canines that I have on my animal farm.  They live in forests and on mountains, and are quite common at Yellowstone National Park.  They are very large canines, and their name might describe how they eat.  What kind of canine is in my animal farm?", "correct": "Wolf", "options": ["Dingo", "Coyote", "Fox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWolf.\n\n\tA wolf is a large canine that lives in many parts of the world.  They are commonly heard at night in Yellowstone National Park.  Wolves come in many different kinds: gray wolf, red wolf, and arctic wolf, to name a few.\r Also, if someone eats quickly and messily, they are said to \"wolf\" their food down. \n"}, {"text": "I also have a type of feline on my farm.  It goes by many names.  Which of these names is not one that refers to the same animal?", "correct": "Lion", "options": ["Puma", "Cougar", "Catamount"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLion.\n\n\tThe animal I have on my farm is a mountain lion, which is much different from a regular lion.  A mountain lion is also called a cougar, a mountain cat, a puma, a catamount, and a panther.\r Even though it is called a panther, a black panther is actually either a jaguar or a leopard, depending on its location. \n"}, {"text": "On my farm I keep some of the largest lizards in the world.  What kind of lizard is the largest?", "correct": "Komodo dragon", "options": ["Giant salamander", "Monitor lizard", "Marine iguana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKomodo dragon.\n\n\tThough all of these lizards can grow to be very large, the komodo dragon is the largest.  It lives on some islands of Indonesia, and its bite can be deadly.  It is not poisonous, though.  Its mouth does contain a lot of bacteria that can infect the bloodstream, however, and that is what can prove to be deadly.\r It is thought that the komodo dragon is so large because over time, it grew to such a large size because it had no natural competitors, and thus became the top of the food chain on the islands. \n"}, {"text": "I don't have just large animals on my farm, I also have very small animals.  In fact, I have a few of the smallest known mammal.  What mammal is this?", "correct": "Pygmy shrew", "options": ["Small mouse", "Dwarf hamster", "Little gerbil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPygmy shrew.\n\n\tThe pygmy shrew is extremely tiny.  It is the smallest mammal in the world, although the bumblebee bat has a smaller skull.  The pygmy shrew is also called the Etruscan shrew, and it grows only around 3-4.5 centimeters in length.  Most shrews are smaller than an average mouse, but the Etruscan shrew takes the cake as being the world's smallest mammal. \n"}]}
