{"id": "89516", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Deal Me Out' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of the episode we see Radar announcing to Sidney Freedman that a 'conference' scheduled at the M*A*S*H will begin at 1800 hours, giving the doctor time to relax and have a drink.  A long-time recurring character on M*A*S*H, was this the first appearance of the psychiatrist, Dr. Freedman?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tActually, Sidney Freedman's (played by Alan Arbus) first appearance occurred earlier in the second season in an episode called 'Radar's Report' which originally aired on September 29, 1973.  'Deal Me Out' which aired on December 8, 1973, was his second appearance.  In 'Radar's Report', Dr. Freedman is called to the M*A*S*H 4077th to determine if Klinger is sane. He diagnoses Klinger as being mentally disturbed, and a homosexual, and recommends that he be returned to the states and institutionalized.  I guess they decided to tone the character down a bit in his second appearance, he's less serious and more like the Sidney Freedman we know and love. \n"}, {"text": "We soon see Radar in a second tent giving another officer the same notification about the impending 'conference'.  Which future sit-com and film star plays this Korean officer, Captain Pak?", "correct": "Pat Morita & Morita & Noriyuki Morita & Morita Noriyuki & Pat Noriyuki Morita & Noriyuki Pat Morita", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPat Morita & Morita & Noriyuki Morita & Morita Noriyuki & Pat Noriyuki Morita & Noriyuki Pat Morita.\n\n\tPat Morita, of Japanese descent, plays a Korean officer in a couple of the episodes of the second season.  As most M*A*S*H-o-philes know, many of the actors playing Koreans during the run of this television series were not Korean...again, not a lot of Asian actors in Hollywood in the 70s.  'Happy Days' fans lovingly remember Pat Morita as the diner owner Arnold, while 'Karate Kid' fans probably best know Pat as Mr. Miyagi...wax on, wax off! \n"}, {"text": "We soon discover that the 'conference' is nothing more than a typical Swamp poker game...what a surprise!  Henry, Trapper and Hawkeye are joined by Sidney Freedman, Captain Pak and finally Klinger, who arrives late carrying what food item?", "correct": "Sandwiches", "options": ["Popcorn", "Hot dogs", "Pretzels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSandwiches.\n\n\tThe sandwiches are no good, but this doesn't stop Radar from having a few in a later scene...that kid is always eating in the early episodes.  Klinger's outfit is characteristically outrageous, he sports a red and blue hat, a red sweater and a red and black kilt.  Sidney Freedman, who if you recall accused Klinger of being homosexual in an earlier episode, seems now to understand that Klinger is merely bucking for a Section 8.  Captain Pak is so offended by Klingers get-up, he queries, 'Earrings, with a sweater?!'  Love that line! \n"}, {"text": "While the boys play cards, Frank Burns is in the operating room about to deal with a patient.  We soon find out, however, that he cannot operate on the patient, a Captain Rogers.  Why not?", "correct": "Rogers is an intelligence agent and can't be anesthetized", "options": ["Rogers requires a brain specialist", "Rogers has a rare blood type unavailable at the camp", "Rogers has disappeared from the operating table"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRogers is an intelligence agent and can't be anesthetized.\n\n\tFrank informs us that Captain Rogers, a CID man (counter-intelligence), cannot be operated on without another CID man present in the room.  Burns suggests that when Rogers is anesthetized he might give up important secrets and hence another intelligence officer must be there to record any inadvertent utterances.  Someone has to be summoned...but who? \n"}, {"text": "Radar, who was off to a seedy dive named the Purple Dragon with a couple of buddies, interrupts the poker game in urgent need to discuss something with Henry.  We discover that Radar has hit an old Korean gentleman with a jeep.  What is the old man's name, as given by Captain Pak?", "correct": "Whiplash Hwang", "options": ["Car Crash Kim", "Wrong Way Wong", "Accidental Ahn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhiplash Hwang.\n\n\tJerry Fujikawa (again, Japanese ancestry) plays Whiplash Hwang, an accident prone Korean farmer who seems to always find a clever way to make a buck, even if it means rolling off someone's bumper!  He ends up taking Radar for 50 dollars, and becomes a victim of Radar's reckless driving once again at the end of the episode. \n"}, {"text": "The patient, Captain Rogers, is finally operated on by Trapper and Hawkeye.  Meanwhile Henry tends to the old Korean fellow and Frank observes another younger patient.  The patient Frank deals with is a recalcitrant young chap played by another future sit-com star.  Who plays this young Private Carter who doesn't want to be returned to the front lines?", "correct": "John Ritter", "options": ["Ted Danson", "Ron Howard", "Robin Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Ritter.\n\n\tPrivate Carter is resistant to Frank's treatments and refuses to eat.  Frank callously informs Carter that he's going to be returned to the war front whether he likes it or not. \n"}, {"text": "In 'Deal Me Out', a CID (intelligence) agent appears in the latter half of the episode, played by Edward Winter.  What is the CID agent's name?", "correct": "Captain Halloran", "options": ["Captain Johns", "Captain Popper", "Captain Beckman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Halloran.\n\n\tThe Captain arrives too late to observe the operation, and vows to arrest Hawkeye and Trapper for performing an illegal operation.  He soon shows up at the card table and, instead of making the arrests, is enticed into joining the poker game, or as Frank puts it he's 'instantly corrupted'.  Very much un-Flagg like of Edward Winter I must add... \n"}, {"text": "Edward Winter, mentioned in the previous question, played what character in all subsequent episodes in which he appeared?", "correct": "Colonel Flagg & Flagg & Col Flagg & Col. Flagg", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nColonel Flagg & Flagg & Col Flagg & Col. Flagg\n\n\t'Deal Me Out' marks the first appearance of Edward Winter in a M*A*S*H episode.  However, as noted above, he does not play the paranoid Colonel Flagg here.  The first appearance of the Flagg character comes in the last episode of the second season, 'A Smattering of Intelligence' which aired March 2, 1974.  In that episode we really see the Flagg persona in action for the first time. The Captain Halloran character is more like Flagg-light, especially considering the fact that he later joins the poker game!  An important exchange must be noted here.  Captain Halloran sits next to Klinger, looks over and says, 'Hey, up close you're a guy.'  Klinger responds, 'Far away too!'  \n"}, {"text": "The poker game is once again interrupted as we hear gunshots being fired somewhere in the camp.  We soon find that Frank is being held at gunpoint by Private Carter, who threatens to kill Burns for forcing him back to the front lines.  In which tent has he accosted Frank?", "correct": "Shower", "options": ["Post-op", "Mess", "Supply"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShower.\n\n\tWe find poor Frank stark naked in the shower being held at gunpoint by Private Carter in this scene filmed in the shower tent.  When Carter points out that Frank is naked, Frank replies that he usually likes to take his clothes off when showering.  Good old bumbling Burns! \n"}, {"text": "Which character in the end surreptitiously enters the tent and disarms the half-crazed Private Carter?", "correct": "Trapper", "options": ["Sidney", "Hawkeye", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrapper.\n\n\tWhile Sidney Freedman tries to talk Carter down, Trapper sneaks around to the back of the shower tent and slips under the rear tent canvas.  He grabs Carter from behind and knocks the gun loose, ending the threat.  Carter is taken away by Dr. Freedman, who promises him an evaluation.  Later we see the endless poker game continuing, even though Klinger, Pak and Trapper are all half asleep.  Thanks for playing the quiz! \n"}]}
