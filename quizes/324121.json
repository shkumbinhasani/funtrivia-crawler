From his early days with \"Mothers of Invention\" (Freak Out, released in 1966) to the release of Philly '76 (one of 23 posthumous albums!), Zappa dabbled in music of all kinds, and was one of the first to begin tearing down the barriers between rock, jazz and classical music.\r A vocal proponent of democracy and free speech, he challenged censorship in any form, testifying before a senate committee attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization, co-founded by Al Gore's wife, Tipper.\r He even considered running for President of the United States at one point and frankly (if you'll excuse the pun), I think that he would have been a far better choice than some other building blocks of the universe ... \n"}, {"text": "From whom did the following quote originate: \"Always you have to contend with the stupidity of men\"?", "correct": "Henry David Thoreau", "options": ["Zsa Zsa Gabor", "Archimedes", "Cleopatra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry David Thoreau.\n\n\tA lifelong abolitionist, Thoreau's philosophy of civil disobedience had a profound influence on future leaders, such as Gandhi, Tolstoy and Martin Luther King Jr.\r An anarchist of the highest order, he is best known for \"Walden\", a book reflecting on the importance of solitude and closeness to nature, and \"Civil Disobedience\", and argument for moral opposition in an unjust government state.\r His most famous quote (sometimes attributed to Thomas Jefferson or Thomas Paine), was \"That government is best which governs least\". \n"}, {"text": "\"Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity\" was first said by whom?", "correct": "Martin Luther King Jr", "options": ["George W Bush", "Bill Cosby", "Winston Churchill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.\n\n\tNot much to say about him that isn't common knowledge.
