What was the name of their song (their most popular single at that)?", "correct": "This is Not a Love Song", "options": ["This is Not a Corporate Order", "This is Not a Jingle", "This is Not Selling Anything"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThis is Not a Love Song.\n\n\t\"This is Not a Love Song\", released in 1983 as a single, became the band's most popular song hitting a peak of number fifteen on the UK Singles Charts.  What turned out to be a hit was later rerecorded for their fourth album release, \"This is What You Want... This is What You Get\" which only reached number fifty-six in the UK and failed to chart in the US.  This was one of the band's two original albums (of seven) to not chart in North America and definitely their lowest charting in Europe.\r Glendathecat brought this British fare onto the Funtrivia Setlist. \n"}, {"text": "Winners of a Best New Artist Grammy, Men At Work were an Australian band known for \"Down Under\" and what other song from their debut album?", "correct": "Who Can It Be Now?", "options": ["The Safety Dance", "Man With Two Hearts", "Maria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWho Can It Be Now?.\n\n\t\"Who Can It Be Now?\" became Men At Work's first major U.S. track (hitting number one on the Billboard charts) and this was followed by both a number one album (\"Business as Usual\") and another number one single (\"Down Under\").  All of these propelled the Aussie band to fame in North America and their native Australia.  Although Men At Work disbanded and went out of work in 1986, they returned to performing a decade later.\rOn another note, \"The Safety Dance\" was by Men Without Hats.  These are different 'Men' altogether though we can logically say that Men at Work must wear hats.\r Leith90 brings this song into the mix from her home country of Australia. \n"}, {"text": "Hitting number one on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, what Billy Joel single did Joel state (in an interview) was the last one in which he hit a high note?", "correct": "An Innocent Man", "options": ["Uptown Girl", "Piano Man", "Tell Her About It"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn Innocent Man.\n\n\tBilly Joel, who previously released \"Piano Man\" and \"New York State of Mind\", released \"An Innocent Man\" as the third single from his ninth album (of the same name).  Regarded as one of his best albums by many critics, the album also included big hits like \"Uptown Girl\", \"Tell Her About It\", and \"The Longest Time\" (all of which peaked at number one either on the UK Singles Chart or the Billboard charts).  \"An Innocent Man\" reached number ten on the Billboard Hot 100, number one on the Adult Contemporary Chart, and number eight in the UK.  Said interview was with \"Billboard\" in regards to the album which he had released more than a decade before (in 1983).\r \"An Innocent Man\" was recommended for the setlist by Lones78. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these songs, covered by Guy Mitchell in 1953, was his first UK Singles Chart number one?", "correct": "She Wears Red Feathers", "options": ["Singing the Blues", "Rock a Billy", "Feet Up"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe Wears Red Feathers.\n\n\tAlthough Guy Mitchell brought the song to the public eye with a more popular version, this US-born performer wasn't the first to release it.  The song was actually written by Bob Merrill and released the year earlier.  When Mitchell re-released the song, it was one of the first songs to ever appear in the top position on the UK Singles Chart.  It also reached number nineteen on the Billboard Hot 100.  Mitchell also hosted a self-titled show, \"The Guy Mitchell Show\", in the years following this popular title's release.\r \"She Wears Red Feathers\" dances into the Setlist thanks to Christinap. \n"}, {"text": "\"Lovin' you isn't the right thing to do...\"\n\nWhich 1976 Fleetwood Mac hit begins with this line written by Lindsey Buckingham?", "correct": "Go Your Own Way", "options": ["Peacekeeper", "Don't Stop", "Landslide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGo Your Own Way.\n\n\tReleasing over forty million copies, Fleetwood Mac's \"Rumours\" is a record to be praised.  Oft-regarded as the band's most profitable and recognizable album, it sported hits such as \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Dreams\", \"Gold Dust Woman\", \"Don't Stop\", and \"The Chain\".  Unsurprisingly, \"Rumours\" was well-received.  It won the Record of the Year Grammy in 1978, hit number one on the 'Billboard' chart in the US and the UK Albums Chart, and topped the previous album in their discography (which was the first to include Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, who would go on to write many of the band's songs).  \"Go Your Own Way\", while not the highest-charting song on the album (it hit number ten on Billboard's Hot 100) was certainly a popular staple in the band's library.\r Fleetwood Mac became an inclusion on the setlist due to Rossian's recommendation. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these songs is by British recording artist James Blunt?", "correct": "Same Mistake", "options": ["Free Loop", "Bad Day", "Love You Lately"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSame Mistake.\n\n\tFrom James Blunt's second album, \"All the Lost Souls\", \"Same Mistake\" was the artist's second single.  Although the song is regarded as one of Blunt's classics, it was no where near successful as the album's first song, \"1973\", or any of the singles released on Blunt's debut album, \"Back to Bedlam\" (which included \"You're Beautiful\", \"High\", \"Wisemen\", and \"Goodbye My Lover\").  \"All the Lost Souls\", released in 2007, hit number one in seven different countries selling several million copies worldwide.\r\"Bad Day\", \"Free Loop\", and \"Love You Lately\" are songs by Canadian singer Daniel Powter.\r \"Same Mistake\" is no mistake- it was added to the setlist by Zorba_Scank. \n"}, {"text": "\"Ground control to Major Tom, commencing countdown, engines on\"\n\nWhat well-known David Bowie song contains these lyrics?", "correct": "Space Oddity", "options": ["Under Pressure", "Ziggy Stardust", "Let's Dance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpace Oddity.\n\n\t\"Space Oddity\" appeared on the album of the same name in 1969 and became one of Bowie's earliest singles.  The song itself reached number one on the UK Singles Chart (in 1975 though it hit number five in the year of its release).  Following Major Tom as he blasts off into outer space, the tune would help his second album rise onto the charts in the US (as his first had failed to do so).  It peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard 200.  The first song to hit number one on the charts in the US for Bowie would be \"Fame\", six years later in 1975 from his \"Young Americans\" album.  Bowie would go on to release dozens of influential rock albums and appear in films such as \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Prestige\" in later years.\r Bowie shows up on our setlist thanks to a suggestion from Snowman. \n"}, {"text": "The second single from their third studio album (\"Happiness...is Not a Fish You Can Catch\"), what song by Canadian group Our Lady Peace was their fifth top five single (on the Canadian Alt. Rock charts) in their home country?", "correct": "Is Anybody Home?", "options": ["Clumsy", "Angels Losing Sleep", "Somewhere Out There"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIs Anybody Home?.\n\n\t\"Is Anybody Home?\" was preceded by \"Naveed\", \"Superman's Dead\", \"Clumsy\", and \"One Man Army\" on the Canadian Alt. Rock chart and it also hit number twenty on the U.S. Billboard Alt. Rock chart.  \"Happiness...Is Not a Fish That You Catch\", the album the song was found on, hit number one on the Canadian album charts just as their previous album had done in 1997.  \"Happiness\" would go on to be three times Platinum in Canada.  \"Angels Losing Sleep\" appeared on a later album, 2005's \"Healthy in Paranoid Times\", while \"Clumsy\" appeared on the 1997 album of the same name and \"Somewhere Out There\", one of the band's biggest U.S. hits, was on their fifth album, \"Gravity\", in 2002.\r This Canadian alternative rock title comes to us straight from Canadian author, Guitargoddess. \n"}, {"text": "Although covered by Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, and James Brown (amongst others), what song was covered by Bryan Ferry on his first solo album (of the same name)?", "correct": "These Foolish Things", "options": ["You Won't See Me", "Don't Ever Change", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThese Foolish Things.\n\n\tWhile Bryan Ferry, the lead singer of Roxy Music, went solo in 1973, his first album (\"These Foolish Things\") was completely filled with covers of songs by famous writers and duos such as Lennon and McCartney, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, and Bob Dylan.  \"These Foolish Things\" (the song, that is) was originally written in 1936.  Others to have performed this song include Rod Stewart, Benny Goodman, Sammy Davis Jr., and Bing Crosby.  Bryan Ferry's later works would be his own and not covers, but his debut release would sell numerous copies.\r Who added this song to the setlist?  Why that would be Bucknallbabe. \n"}, {"text": "Found on Pearl Jam's fifth album, \"Yield\", which of these songs was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 1999 Grammy Awards?", "correct": "Do the Evolution", "options": ["Alive", "Even Flow", "The Fixer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDo the Evolution.\n\n\tAlthough this album, \"Yield\", reached number two on the Billboard Top 200 and went Platinum, \"Do the Evolution\" was never officially promoted as a single (unlike \"Given to Fly\" and \"Wishlist\").  Said song did, however, hit number thirty-three on the Billboard Modern Rock Track chart despite a lack of attention while the album could not best the \"Titanic\" soundtrack on the album front...and nothing would for months.  Both \"Alive\" and \"Even Flow\" were the band's first singles on their debut album, \"Ten\", while \"The Fixer\" appeared on their ninth album, \"Backspacer\".\r The final shuffled song on our setlist, \"Do the Evolution\", was suggested by Avrandldr. \n"}]}
