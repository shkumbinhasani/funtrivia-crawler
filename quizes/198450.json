{"id": "198450", "name": "'Dances with Wolves', Part 5 Quiz | Dances with Wolves . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Dances with Wolves"], "questions": [{"text": "Most of the men in the tribe have left in a war party to confront the enemy Pawnee.  Lt. Dunbar has stayed behind to help look after the remaining tribe members.  During this time he is able to cultivate his relationship with Stands with a Fist.  In one scene, Stands with a Fist gathers water while she explains to Dunbar the meaning behind her name.  Is it true that her name relates to her first confrontation with warriors in the tribe who had just massacred her family?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNothing of the sort, actually.  As was recalled earlier in the film, it was the Pawnees who killed her birth family, and the Sioux were the ones who found and adopted her.  \r She received her name (Stands with a Fist) because she confronted a woman who was bullying her.  Stands with a Fist apparently decked the woman and then stood over her with her fist, threatening the other women in the vicinity. \n"}, {"text": "In the midst of their conversation, Dunbar offends Stands with a Fist with a question.  Which question does he ask her that causes her to run off suddenly?", "correct": "Why are you not married?", "options": ["Why are you always so unhappy?", "Why don't you like to speak English?", "Why won't you kiss me?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhy are you not married?.\n\n\tThe topic of Stands with a Fist's marital status is quite a touchy one, considering that her former husband was recently killed in battle.  Stands with a Fist is in fact still mourning her husband, and when Dunbar first encounters her in the film, she is in the midst of a suicide ritual.  Soon, however, her mourning will be over and happier times will present themselves. \n"}, {"text": "Dunbar returns to the fort in order to acquire a few of his possessions.  In this brief scene, two important and profound events occur.  First, he 'announces' through his writing that he loves Stands with a Fist.  What is the second key event to occur here?", "correct": "He is able to hand feed Two Socks", "options": ["He renames Cisco", "He leaves his soldier uniform behind", "He renounces his commission in the U.S. army"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is able to hand feed Two Socks.\n\n\tWhile flipping through his diary, Dunbar considers his relationship with Stands with a Fist.  He comes to the realization that he is in love with her, and writes 'I love Stands with a Fist', signing it 'Dances with Wolves'.  In a sense, he is officially adopting his Indian name here.  \r Just following this, Dunbar hears a noise outside his hut.  The wolf Two Socks has returned, and Dunbar is finally able to get his lupine friend to take a piece of meat directly from him.  This seems to cement Dunbar's relationship with his new home out on the prarie.  Costner claims that some of the most difficult scenes were with the wolves (there were two) because the creatures were not entirely tame. \n"}, {"text": "Not long after returning to the Sioux village, Dunbar is confronted with a panic situation.  It seems that the Pawnee are heading towards the village and looking for blood.  Dunbar desires to help his Sioux friends and announces that he has rifles.  Accompanied by Smiles-a-Lot, Dunbar returns to the fort and searches for his buried rifles.  What item marks the spot where they are buried?", "correct": "A bone", "options": ["A metal stake", "A piece of wood", "A flat rock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA bone.\n\n\tSmiles-a-Lot locates the bone almost by accident, and both he and Dunbar immediately dig up the box of rifles under the pouring rain.  They return to the Sioux village with these weapons, helping to save the tribe from certain annihilation. \n"}, {"text": "During the ensuing battle with the Pawnee, the Sioux garner a complete victory, routing the Pawnee to a man.  However, the victors were not without their own losses.  Which prominent member of the tribe does not survive the battle?", "correct": "Stone Calf", "options": ["Black Shawl", "Kicking Bird", "Ten Bears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStone Calf.\n\n\tStone Calf, played by Jimmy Herman, takes a tomahawk in the back.  Seemingly all of the Pawnees are killed in the battle, including the leader, played by Wes Studi.  After the battle, Dunbar proclaims his pride in the victory.\r 'It was hard to know how to feel.' says Dunbar.  'I'd never been in a battle like this one.  There was no dark, political objective.  This was not a fight for territory or for riches, or to make men free.  It was fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through the winter.  To protect the lives of the women and children and loved ones only a few feet away.'  He continues: 'And I gradually began to look at it in a new way.  I felt a pride I'd never felt before.  I'd never really known who John Dunbar was, perhaps the name itself had no meaning, but as I heard my Sioux name being called over and over, I knew for the first time who I really was.' \n"}, {"text": "The battle is over and the camp returns to normal.  Love becomes the main theme again, as we see Dunbar once again courting Stands with a Fist.  Finally, Kicking Bird decides that her mourning will be over, making her eligible once again for marriage.  Would it be true to say that Kicking Bird had suspicions all along that Stands with a Fist and Dunbar were in love?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIndeed, Kicking Bird, the tribe's medicine man, is the last to know.  It is his wife Black Shawl who informs him of the love brewing between Dunbar and Stands with a Fist.  Kicking Bird seems a little annoyed, not at the blooming relationship between his friend and adopted daughter, but by the fact that he was not aware of it.  The following day, he announces that Stands with a Fist will mourn no more. \n"}, {"text": "In order to get married to Stands with a Fist, Dunbar is forced to come up with a fairly large amount of dowry.  He solves this problem by ransacking the fort for goods that he has hidden in storage.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAs a matter of fact, Dunbar receives dowry gift from the various tribe members, who provide him with the goods necessary to win the hand of Stands with a Fist.  These goods are left outside of his tent, and the next morning they are gone...meaning that the marriage proposal has been accepted. \n"}, {"text": "Following the wedding, Dunbar and Kicking Bird take an excursion together across the Sioux territory.  They behold beautiful natural scenes while conversing about the future.  Kicking Bird inquires about the white man, asking how many there are.  Dunbar provides which of these as an answer?", "correct": "Like the stars", "options": ["Like grains of sand", "Like the water", "Like the buffalo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLike the stars.\n\n\tIn the extended version, Kicking Bird takes Dunbar on a long trip across many miles of territory, finally reaching the Grand Tetons in the western portion of modern day Wyoming.  They discover the abandoned dwelling of a fur trader, complete with a large number of animal carcasses randomly strewn about.  This sickens Kicking Bird and angers Dunbar, who suggests they wait for the return of the poachers.  Kicking Bird decides against this, suggesting that they move on. \n"}, {"text": "Kicking Bird and Dunbar return to the Sioux village, where they intend to inform the rest of the tribe about the impending approach of the white man.  Chief Ten Bears has a surprise for them, however, in the form of which of these items?", "correct": "A soldier's helmet", "options": ["An arquebus", "A box of gold doubloons", "A jewel-encrusted cross"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA soldier's helmet.\n\n\tTen Bears proudly holds the helmet of a Spanish soldier, claiming that his grandfather's grandfather drove them (the Spanish) away.  He then describes how, with each generation, white men have come, the Spanish, the Mexicans, the Texans, all eventually to be driven away.  Ten Bears understands that Dunbar's people will also come, and that his people will fight to keep their freedom. \n"}, {"text": "The Sioux village is being dismantled now, as they now intend to depart for their winter camp.  Dunbar intends to accompany them to the winter camp.  However, just before departing, he recalls that he has left a very important item back at the fort.  What is this item?", "correct": "diary & his diary & the diary & a diary & notebook & notepad & journal & a journal & the journal & his journal & ledger & a ledger & the ledger & his ledger & his notepad & his notebook & a notebook & the notebook & the notepad & a notepad", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ndiary & his diary & the diary & a diary & notebook & notepad & journal & a journal & the journal & his journal & ledger & a ledger & the ledger & his ledger & his notepad & his notebook & a notebook & the notebook & the notepad & a notepad.\n\n\tDunbar is happily packing his personal items and looking forward to leaving his life as a U.S. soldier behind.  Unfortunately, he has forgotten his diary at Fort Sedgwick and must return to retrieve it, lest the army follow the tribe in pursuit of him.  This sets up the final scenes of the film, which will be covered in the sixth and final quiz of this series.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
