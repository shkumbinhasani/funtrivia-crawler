At first, they did not like the idea of making it a Wii game, but they eventually did.  With the way \"Epic Mickey\" became designed to allow it to be for the Wii, it was decided that it would be released JUST on the Wii, and in 2010, when it was released, it was only released for the one console. \n"}, {"text": "At one point in time, Mickey travels through a \"Steamboat Willie\" inspired level, and Pete can even be seen steering the boat.
