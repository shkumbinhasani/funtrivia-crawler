What did he plan to do?", "correct": "Blow up Parliament", "options": ["Assassinate a Royal Minister", "Kidnap the Queen", "Provide military secrets to Spain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlow up Parliament.\n\n\tFawkes was a key figure in the so-called \"Gunpowder Plot\" to blow up Parliament. He was caught. Parliament was saved, but Fawkes was executed.

Which of the following has been suggested as the \"true\" author of Shakespeare's works - based on his mysterious (and possibly \"fraudulent\"?) death?", "correct": "Christopher Marlowe", "options": ["Derby", "Francis Bacon", "Oxford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristopher Marlowe.\n\n\tAll four have been suggested in earnest as the \"true\" author, but only Marlowe fits the bill as the man whose untimely death coincided (more or less) with the rise of Shakespeare, the writer.
