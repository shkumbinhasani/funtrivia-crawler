Why, according to Bulma, is it likely the Dragon Ball isn't appearing on the Dragon Radar?", "correct": "It's been eaten by a creature", "options": ["It was never created", "It's no longer on the planet", "The Dragon Ball and the Dragon Radar are one in the same"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's been eaten by a creature.\n\n\tAt the Red Ribbon Army Headquarters, Goku faces off against Black, the final remaining leader stationed in a giant mech.  Fortunately, Goku is able to evade taking a final large blast and stop Black before he escapes, bringing the mech down and putting an end to the Red Ribbon Army once and for all.\r Bulma, Yamcha, and the others arrive moments too late for the battle, but not too soon to reunite with their friend.  Goku, now with six Dragon Balls, says that he'll still continue to search for the final ball, but it won't show up on the Dragon Radar.  Bulma assumes that the problem lays with the hiding spot of the ball; they won't be able to find it as is.  On Master Roshi's recommendation, Goku decides to visit the mysterious Fortuneteller Baba for guidance, but not before gathering Upa for the quest, getting a new outfit, and flying along with Yamcha, Puar, and Krillin in tow. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first to fall during Fortuneteller Baba's five battles?", "correct": "Krillin", "options": ["Goku", "Yamcha", "Puar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKrillin.\n\n\tThe group arrives at Fortuneteller Baba's palace to find a line already formed seeking out Baba's service.  What they find during their wait, however, is that people proceeding into the further reaches of the palace are coming out more bruised than they were when they went in.  When they ask the ghostly attendant why this is happening, he laughs maniacally.  It's all a bit unnerving.  Soon, however, they are brought before the Fortuneteller herself and are told that the fortune comes at a price: ten million zeni.  It's a bit much, so she offers an alternative: they have to fight her five warriors.  They win, they get their fortune for free.\r The group faces off against their first foe and Krillin steps up for a one-on-one battle.  What he isn't aware of is the fact that the first warrior is a vampire named Fangs.  With a single bite, Krillin loses too much blood to continue.\r Surprisingly, it's Upa and Puar who win against the vampire, using garlic to ward him off and transformations to frighten their foe and knock him out of the battle arena. \n"}, {"text": "The second of Fortuneteller Baba's warriors has which of these advantages?", "correct": "Invisibility", "options": ["Flight", "Invulnerability", "Super-speed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInvisibility.\n\n\tThe second match begins and Yamcha steps into the arena for his fight...with an invisible warrior.  This, of course, proves to be a difficult battle for the experienced fighter, so much so that Krillin convinces Goku to return to Master Roshi's Island and retrieve Bulma and Master Roshi.  Yamcha does end up finding a way to fight, relying on his hearing to do battle, but Baba soon puts an end to this advantage by singing.  When Roshi and Bulma finally arrive, Krillin puts his plan into action, finally revealing the invisible warrior and allowing Yamcha to attack with his Wolf Fang Fist until the foe surrenders.\r When the battle ends, Master Roshi reveals that the two of them-- he and Baba-- are, in fact, siblings. \n"}, {"text": "The third battle of Fortuneteller Baba's quintet involves fighting a mummy in what arena?", "correct": "The Devil's Toilet", "options": ["The Festering Hall", "The Witch's Cauldron", "The Bubbling Pit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Devil's Toilet.\n\n\tFortuneteller Baba has the group head indoors for the third fight and Yamcha once again steps up to do battle, this time in 'The Devil's Toilet', an arena with a pit directly in the center.  The third warrior, as it seems, is a mummified fighter with great strength, and the battle is far from easy-- no one, according to Master Roshi, has ever won this third battle. In fact, Puar jumps into the arena to help, but the two are nearly killed by the mummy as it tries to edge them into the bubbling, green water below the arena.  Luckily, Goku is able to save them from death.  While they recover on the sidelines, Goku steps in in his friends' place and, after getting a bit caught up in the mummy's bandages, he knocks it out in one swift attack, defeating what was thought to be an invulnerable foe. \n"}, {"text": "Spike, Fortuneteller Baba's fourth fighter, uses which almost-powerless attack (considering) against Goku in battle?", "correct": "The Devilmite Beam", "options": ["The Kamehameha Wave", "The Lightning Flash Surprise", "The Wolf Fang Fist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Devilmite Beam.\n\n\tImmediately after Baba's mummy warrior is defeated she mixes up her order and brings out what was intended to be her fifth warrior, Spike, a demon.  Goku gets the edge on Spike physically, but, as Roshi soon remembers, Spike has a deadly attack known as the Devilmite Beam which takes the negative energy surrounding a foe, harnesses it, and shoots it back at them, almost always killing them. Roshi tells the others that the Devilmite Beam has killed more people than any wars combined.  The attack is very quickly used on Goku...more than once...but it ends up failing.  As it turns out, Goku doesn't think negative thoughts. Goku easily survives the match, moving on to the final round. \n"}, {"text": "Who is revealed to be Fortuneteller Baba's fifth and final warrior in battle?", "correct": "Gohan", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGohan.\n\n\tThe final warrior steps out of the darkness with a halo over his head and a cat mask on his face and he calmly asks Baba if they can fight outside (which she agrees to).  The fight however, regardless of setting, proves to be exceedingly interesting since Goku seems to be an even match with the fighter, a man who he seems to feel comfortable with, despite any explanation.  Both of the fighters end up using Kamehameha Waves in battle and, in a turn of events, reveals that he knows Goku's one weakness-- his tail-- by exploiting it.  It isn't until Master Roshi reveals the man for who he actually is-- Gohan, Goku's deceased grandfather-- that the battle gets really interesting.  Gohan is just about to win the battle with his grip on Goku's tail...until in an odd occurrence, it falls off in his hand.  The battle ends, however, when Gohan surrenders and takes off his mask.\r Gohan apologizes for accidentally removing his grandson's tail; he just wanted to help the boy surpass his weakness.  Baba has to explain the rest; she went to the land of the dead to retrieve Gohan for the sake of the battle.  After hearing of Goku's exploits and boosting Goku's spirits, Gohan head backs to the spirit world.\r Baba, meanwhile, makes good on her promise as well, indicating the location of the seventh Dragon Ball. \n"}, {"text": "Who, as it's discovered, possesses the seventh Dragon Ball?", "correct": "Emperor Pilaf", "options": ["Colonel Violet", "Fortuneteller Baba", "Master Roshi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmperor Pilaf.\n\n\tWhile the final battle rages on at Fortuneteller Baba's palace, Emperor Pilaf and his lackeys test out their new, stronger power suits.  Looking on satellite feeds, they just happen to catch the fact that Goku's weakness is his tail.  Because of this, the feel that they have the advantage to claim the other six Dragon Balls (as he has the seventh hidden in a radar-proof box).\r It's a bit too bad though-- Baba gives Goku his due fortune and informs him that the final Dragon Ball is with Pilaf.  When he arrives to fight, they use their new Power Suits but find that he actually has no tail since it fell off in the battle with Gohan.  Goku destroys their Power Suits and forces Pilaf to hand over the last ball...and his clothes...putting Goku into possession of all seven, finally. \n"}, {"text": "Does Goku get the opportunity to make use of the Dragon Balls?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhen all seven Dragon Balls are in Goku's possession he retrieves Upa and returns to Korin's Tower to make good use of them.  As soon as they arrive, Goku calls upon the dragon to make his wish, causing the Dragon Balls to glow intensely and the sky to darken.  Shenlong appears momentarily, descending from the heavens in a shock of lightning. Upa, emerging from a tree, tells the dragon his ultimate wish: to bring his father back from death.  Lightning strikes the mound nearby and, sure enough, Bora comes back to life.  The dragon departs shortly after and, as the Dragon Balls shoot into the sky and scatter, Goku snags the four-star ball, vowing not to lose it again. Now, he doesn't need to search for the Dragon Balls again. \n"}, {"text": "Master Roshi takes Yamcha under his wing as a student.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhen Goku departs with Upa and the Dragon Balls, the rest of the group is left at Fortuneteller Baba's palace to determine what to do next.  Yamcha asks Master Roshi if he'll let him become a student but Roshi disagrees, saying that two students is more than enough for such an old man.  Bulma, however, says that she'll be able to visit more-- in her bikini-- if Yamcha is there.  This alone gets Master Roshi to allow him to train.\r When Goku returns, he's told the opposite; there's no more Master Roshi can teach him.  Since Goku has outgrown his teachings, it's time to explore on his own, growing from life itself...traveling without the Flying Nimbus.  They'll all meet up at the next World Martial Arts Tournament...in three years. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is the site of the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament?", "correct": "Papaya Island", "options": ["Banana Island", "Mango Island", "Starfruit Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPapaya Island.\n\n\tIn his three years of training, Goku experiences a ton; he helps towns stave off monsters and criminals, learns new techniques, and meets new friends.  But the time finally comes for him to head to Papaya Island for the World Martial Arts Tournament.  Originally, Goku plans to run to the location of the event, but he is convinced by a local to fly.  Unfortunately, he has no money.  After a series of events involving some criminals on the mainland, an impromptu visit from Fortuneteller Baba, and a series of events at a carnival, Goku inevitably decides to swim all the way to the tournament. \n"}]}
