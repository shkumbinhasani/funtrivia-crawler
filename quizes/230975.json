{"id": "230975", "name": "Spelling It Out - \"Metroid Prime\" Multiple Choice Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Metroid Games", "Metroid Prime"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these is upgraded to hold another five everytime you find an expansion?", "correct": "Missiles", "options": ["Energy Tanks", "Power Bombs", "Scan Logs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMissiles.\n\n\tMissile Expansions are the most common expansions in the game totaling forty-nine.  Energy Tanks can also be upgraded fourteen times while Power Bombs can be upgraded only four times.\rThe Missile Launcher is the first item that you restore in the game (you lose the use of it on the Space Pirate Frigate), and immediately after, you can begin to collect the Morph Ball as well as Missile Expansions.  Whenever you collect one of these, your total will rise by five, so in the end, you can have up to two hundred and fifty missiles.  If you happen to use a Super Missile later in the game, it will use five of them at once.  Some Missile/Beam combos will drain your Missile stock slowly, while some will use large amounts of missiles for a single huge blast. \n"}, {"text": "Which boss do you fight in the Elite Quarters of the Phazon Mines?", "correct": "Omega Pirate", "options": ["Phazon Elite", "Elite Pirate", "Metroid Prime"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOmega Pirate.\n\n\tThe Omega Pirate is the third-to-last boss in the game, and once he's defeated, you can claim the Phazon Suit.  During the battle, you'll need to make use of your beams and visors as the boss turns invisible on you and unleashes specialized Space Pirates at most chances.  In order to defeat the boss, you'll need to attack its Phazon plates on its arms and legs, and you'll need to attack it while it regenerates them over the pits of Phazon in the room. This may take a while, but after the battle, you'll be able to advance through the deeper parts of the Phazon Mines and the Impact Crater at the end of the game. \n"}, {"text": "What type of Phazon are you not protected against at any point in the game?", "correct": "Red Phazon", "options": ["Blue Phazon", "Green Phazon", "Yellow Phazon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed Phazon.\n\n\tAfter you get the Phazon Suit, you may be able to walk into piles of Blue Phazon, but not even your trusty new suit will save you from the horrible Red Phazon of the Impact Crater.  You'll need to avoid this in three different chambers of the Impact Crater before you make your way to the Metroid Prime's lair at the end of the game.  After beating the boss, you'll lose your Phazon Suit.  Because of Red and Blue Phazon, Metroids can mutate into Fission Metroids, which can be found in one of the three Red Phazon chambers of the Impact Crater. \n"}, {"text": "Which location contains Research Lab Aether?", "correct": "Phendrana Drifts", "options": ["Tallon Overworld", "Space Pirate Frigate", "Phazon Mines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhendrana Drifts.\n\n\tWhen you investigate Phendrana Drifts long enough, you'll be able to locate the laboratories in the area, and they contain many Research Labs including Aether and Hydra.  These locations are usually swarming with Space Pirates trying to guard the area, and later in the game, it'll also contain Metroids.  In the labs, you can find the Thermal Visor and the Super Missile as well as the Artifact of Elder. \n"}, {"text": "Which location is within the Chozo Ruins?", "correct": "Hall of the Elders", "options": ["Monitor Station", "Quarantine Cave", "Gravity Chamber"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHall of the Elders.\n\n\tThe Hall of the Elders contains the first of only a few Missile Replenishing Stations in the game, and it contains Chozo Ghosts every time you visit it as well.  This room is one of the major rooms in the Chozo Ruins because it is close to a few new items and artifacts.  For example, a couple rooms away, you can find the Ice Beam in the Antechamber. You can also find an Energy Tank in the Hall of Elders as well as the Artifact of World in a nearby room.  The room also contains a piece of Chozo Lore for you to scan.  The Monitor Station is in Magmoor Caverns, while the Quarantine Cave and Gravity Chamber are both in Phendrana Drifts. \n"}, {"text": "Which item is the first to be found in Phendrana Drifts?", "correct": "Boost Ball", "options": ["Wave Beam", "Spider Ball", "Thermal Visor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoost Ball.\n\n\tAlthough all of these items are found in Phendrana Drifts, the Boost Ball in Phendrana Canyon is likely to be the first that you acquire since it can be obtained during your first visit.  It's also needed for you to access the room containing the Space Jump Boots in the Tallon Overworld.  The Boost Ball it the second upgrade for the Morph Ball with the first being the Morph Ball Bomb.  The Boost Ball will allow you to move faster in Morph Ball mode, travel on half-pipe-shaped surfaces, and activate Spinner devices. \n"}, {"text": "There are twelve of these throughout the game.  What are they?", "correct": "Artifacts", "options": ["Chozo Lore Entries", "Elite Pirates", "Save Stations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArtifacts.\n\n\tThere are fourteen Save Stations, a couple of Elite Pirates, and sixteen Chozo Lore entries in the game, but all of the twelve Artifacts are crucial to complete the game.  The Artifacts of Truth, Strength, Elder, Wild, Lifegiver, Warrior, Chozo, Nature, Sun, World, Spirit, and Newborn are all needed to gain access to the Impact Crater at the end of the game.  When you return the twelve artifacts to the Artifact Temple on the Tallon Overworld, you'll be able to fight Ridley, the penultimate boss. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these will refill only 50 energy?", "correct": "Large Energy", "options": ["Ultra Energy", "Energy Tank", "Small Energy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarge Energy.\n\n\tLarge Energies are red in colour and are the second-most-common Energy replenishers in the game.  Small Energies are purple and only refill ten energy, while Ultra Energy is gold and refills 100 energy; equal to a full Energy Tank.  Energy Tanks are found throughout Tallon IV and are used to increase your maximum Energy total by 100 each time.  There are fourteen of these found throughout the game, and each time one is found, it will replenish your energy completely.  Save Stations and Samus' Gunship will also completely refill your energy. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these enemies is only found in the Impact Crater?", "correct": "Lumigek", "options": ["Scarab", "Plazmite", "Parasite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLumigek.\n\n\tPlazmites are the glowing bugs that are found in the Chozo Ruins, and they often light up dark rooms or passageways.  If they are shot at or destroyed, their light will disappear.  Scarabs, Parasites, and Lumigeks are similar in many ways because they all appear in swarms.  They can usually be found in tunnels, but are sometimes found in rooms as well. They will usually drop from the ceiling and damage you as you walk through a narrow space.  Scarabs are in the Chozo Ruins, Parasites are on the Space Pirate Frigate, and Lumigeks are in the Impact Crater.  Another similar enemy, the Tallon Crab, is only on the Tallon Overworld (in the crashed frigate).  Other than Lumigeks, the only other enemies in the Impact Crater are Fission Metroids and Metroid Prime. \n"}, {"text": "What word(s) relating to \"Metroid Prime\" can be spelled with the first letter of the previous nine answers?", "correct": "Morph Ball", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorph Ball.\n\n\tThe Morph Ball is an essential tool that Samus MUST HAVE in order to complete the game.  In order to obtain it, you need to go to the Ruined Shrine after obtaining the Missile Launcher, and you need to fight a Plated Beetle to obtain the item.  The Morph Ball is upgraded many times through the game, and it changes colours when you acquire new suits.  The item can allow Samus to squeeze into narrow crevices and passageways, and it be used underwater.  Upgrades for this item include the Boost Ball, Spider ball, Morph Ball Bomb, and Power Bomb. \n"}]}
