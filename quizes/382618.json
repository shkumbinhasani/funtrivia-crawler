She almost changes in front of them, but they stop her and send her to the bathroom.  There, she refuses to let him close the door, speaking to Mike with nothing more than 'yes' and 'no'.  Lucas thinks she escaped from a nuthouse. He and Dustin both believe that they should tell Mike's mother, but they can't tell anyone that they went out when they were told not to.  Instead, they create a plan and get her to stay in a fort inside the basement for the night.  After the others leave, Mike discovers that her name, or what she believes it is, is 'Eleven'.  He calls her 'El' for short. \n"}, {"text": "Who decides to visit Lonnie, Joyce's ex?", "correct": "Jonathan", "options": ["Hopper", "Joyce", "Nancy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJonathan.\n\n\tThe day after Will goes missing, Joyce is frantic at breakfast and Jonathan tries to hold her together despite her anxiety.  Hopper arrives simply to say that he hasn't found anything and they talk about the phone call from the previous night.  The phone itself is charred due to the electrical current that passed through it, and it's no longer operable.  Hopper blames it on the storm.  Jonathan offers to go to his father, Lonnie's, in the city, just in case Will ran there.\rMike wakes up the next morning and finds Eleven with the supercom walkie talkie.  He tries to get her to go through with his plan to ring the doorbell and get help from his parents, but Eleven won't do it; she says she's in trouble with bad people, and makes it clear that those people will kill them. \n"}, {"text": "Tuesday night, at 8pm, the students of Hawkins are invited to which of the following?", "correct": "An assembly", "options": ["A search party", "A BBQ", "A magic show"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn assembly.\n\n\tGovernment agents listen to Joyce's call to the cops from the previous night and it's apparent they have more stake in the events.

She's a bit hesitant to go, especially since the school has an assembly to support the search for Will at 8pm.  Will's brother, Jonathan, is in the hallway putting up missing posters.  Nancy wishes him luck.\rLucas and Dustin find that Mike is late for school, but he never actually goes.  He stays in to spend the day with Eleven at home. \n"}, {"text": "What band/musician did Jonathan introduce to Will on their record player?", "correct": "The Clash", "options": ["Aerosmith", "The Rolling Stones", "Van Halen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Clash.\n\n\tJonathan, driving out of Hawkins, remembers when his parents were breaking up and he and Will were bonding over music.

Unfortunately, considering the circumstances, she has no money (she spent the last of it on posters and gave the rest to Jonathan).  She asks for a two week advance as she nearly breaks down in front of her boss. \n"}, {"text": "The trophies in Mike's room all involve which of these?", "correct": "Science fairs", "options": ["Football", "Dancing", "Martial arts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScience fairs.\n\n\tWith the Byers household empty, a group of government agents arrives in sealed suits to search the premises.

There, looking at a science fair trophy, Eleven spies a photo featuring Will and recognizes him.  Before Mike can ask, his mother comes home and he has to hide Eleven in the closet where, in his absence, she has a flashback of being locked into a sealed room in the labs beneath Hawkins.  Mike, meanwhile, is safe to stay home considering Will is missing. \n"}, {"text": "Benny's body is staged with which of these to imply he committed suicide?", "correct": "Gun", "options": ["Noose", "Razor blade", "Knife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGun.\n\n\tJoyce gets back home with her new phone and plugs it into the wall.

Hopper claims this case is personal; Benny was a friend.\rJonathan, meanwhile, gets to the city and reaches Lonnie's in the rain.  Lonnie's new girlfriend, Cynthia, answers the door and Jonathan barges inside.

Someone who was there for lunch the previous day says he was there and saw a kid at lunch, though he doesn't know it was Eleven.  Since the child was the same height as Will, he says it very well could have been him. \n"}, {"text": "Nancy decides to go to a party at Steve's house.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tNancy decides to go to the party at Steve's place, but she decides to use the assembly as a cover.

Out back, in the woods, Hopper is informed of a storm drain containing a shred of a hospital gown.

She picks out Will's piece for the boys and proceeds to flip the board over.

They ask who he's hiding from and she places their monster on the board.\rJonathan, meanwhile, takes his camera and drives to where Will's bike was found to take photos.

As the lights flicker out, she's stalked from behind by a large creature.  She disappears by the time the lights come on.\rAt home, Joyce wakes up to the sound of the phone ringing and, once again, it seems to be Will's breathing.  She tries to stay on the line, but the phone jolts her again before charring and going dead.  Searching the house, a radio turns on in Will's room to play The Clash's \"Should I Stay or Should I Go?\".  When it turns off, she turns to watch something in the bedroom walls bend and reach towards her.  She heads out to the car, but the radio turns on again and she decides to head back inside. \n"}]}
