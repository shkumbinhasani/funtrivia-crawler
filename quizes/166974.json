Depp's performance is by far the best thing about it.) \n"}, {"text": "Quiche a kestrel hues?", "correct": "Keisha Castle-Hughes & Keisha Castle Hughes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeisha Castle-Hughes & Keisha Castle Hughes.\n\n\tBest Actress -- for her poignant portrayal of a strong, vulnerable  Maori girl in \"Whale Rider.\" \n"}, {"text": "Chewed laud?", "correct": "Jude Law", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJude Law.\n\n\tBest Actor -- for playing an AWOL rebel soldier in \"Cold Mountain.\" \n"}, {"text": "Bend kinks sleet?", "correct": "Ben Kingsley", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen Kingsley.\n\n\tBest Actor--for his moving portrayal of an Iranian immigrant in \"House of Sand and Fog.\" I loved the book, but somehow, for me, H of S and F got \"Lost in Translation,\" despite great acting. This movie is about the biggest downer of the year (well, maybe it ties with \"Mystic River\" for Most Depressing). \n"}, {"text": "Shore lease theorem?", "correct": "Charlize Theron", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlize Theron.\n\n\tBest Actress award winner--for playing a murderous prostitute in \"Monster.\" Boy, the make-up artists sure did a good job of making a beautiful woman look monstrous! \n"}, {"text": "Marsh shag hay hoardin'?", "correct": "Marcia Gay Harden", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarcia Gay Harden.\n\n\tBest Supporting Actress--for playing Tim Robbins' worried wife in \"Mystic River.\" \n"}, {"text": "Shun pin?", "correct": "Sean Penn", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Penn.\n\n\tBest Actor award winner--for playing a murdered girl's grieving dad in \"Mystic River.\" I was disappointed in the ending, but I thought Penn did a wonderful job. \n"}, {"text": "A lick bowled when?", "correct": "Alec Baldwin", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlec Baldwin.\n\n\tBest Supporting Actor -- for \"The Cooler.\" \n"}, {"text": "Wren neigh sell wager?", "correct": "Renee Zellweger", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRenee Zellweger.\n\n\tBest Supporting Actress award winner--for playing a frumpy but mighty strong country gal in \"Cold Mountain.\" Yay for Renee! \n"}, {"text": "Dye yam cheatin'?", "correct": "Diane Keaton", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiane Keaton.\n\n\tBest Actress. Ordinarily I adore Diane Keaton, but in my opinion \"Something's Gotta Give\" is the most over-rated movie of the year. Its script is so wretched that I walked out halfway through. Blech! And what was the glorious Frances McDormand DOING in this terrible film? (Very little.) Jack Nicholson did the best he could, but the script was so lame that nothing could save this flick. \n"}, {"text": "Some panther more tin?", "correct": "Samantha Morton", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSamantha Morton.\n\n\tBest Actress -- for \"In America.\" This is a wonderful, six-hanky movie.

Most notably, Tim Robbins, who won the Best Supporting Actor award for \"Mystic River,\" Bill Murray, Best Actor nominee for \"Lost in Translation,\" Dijou Hounsou, Best Supporting Actor nominee for \"In America,\" and Shohreh Aghdashloo (hope I spelled it correctly), who played Ben Kingsley's wife so gracefully in \"House of Sand and Fog.\" The only reason I didn't include the last two is that I don't know how to pronounce their names--plus, nobody'd be able to spell them! \n"}]}
