{"id": "274698", "name": "\"Sly 3\" - \"Cooper Vault\" (PS2) Trivia Game  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Sly Cooper Games", "Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves"], "questions": [{"text": "There are several rugs in the third section of the vault, but just how many?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Five", "Seven", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tThere are six rugs scattered throughout the level.  Most are in the beginning, right next to the Cooper's picture, but there are a few along the path he created, too. \n"}, {"text": "When you get to the pots, how many rotating pots are there?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Five", "Six", "Seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tNote how the question asked how many rotating pots there were.  Although there were five pots, only four of them were rotating.  The last pot has a cobra made of gold on it, which you can spire jump on. \n"}, {"text": "Are there any spoons in this level?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tOddly, yes.  During one of the Cooper's sections, there are bowls and spoons everywhere.  There aren't many, and they are just scattered around the Cooper's picture, but they are there nonetheless. \n"}, {"text": "How many hammers must you avoid after the fourth Cooper?", "correct": "Eight", "options": ["Sixteen", "Four", "Twelve"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight.\n\n\tYou may think there are twelve, but this is incorrect.  There are only eight hammers.  You must avoid four of the hammers twice though.  This makes it appear like twelve hammers, but the first set you get while they are coming up, the second set are a new set of hammers coming down, and the third set are the same four hammers going up. \n"}, {"text": "How many cannonballs are on the part with the female pirate?", "correct": "Eight", "options": ["Ten", "Six", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight.\n\n\tRight by her sign, before you even start her portion, there are eight cannonballs.  There are two piles of cannonballs, each containing four cannonballs.  There is also a cannon by her picture, too. \n"}, {"text": "During the seventh Cooper's level, how many whackable bottles are there?", "correct": "Twenty-six", "options": ["Twenty-five", "Twenty-four", "Twenty-seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwenty-six.\n\n\tThe twenty-six bottles don't all appear right at the beginning of the level.  There are sixteen total bottles at the beginning, and ten are scattered throughout the rest of the level.  Note, however, I did not count the bottles for any other Cooper's section, since the question asked for bottles from the seventh Cooper ONLY. \n"}, {"text": "On the seventh Cooper's sign, how much is the reward for this Cooper?", "correct": "$5,000", "options": ["$50,000", "$10,000", "$1,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$5,000.\n\n\tThe Cooper is worth $5,000, a tiny amount for us today.  Back then it would have been a huge amount, because the Cooper family has always been stealing, and he was hard to catch.  The Cooper had also received plenty of money to add to the vault, so the cops wanted to catch him for everything he had stolen. \n"}, {"text": "How many hammers are immediately after the eighth Cooper?", "correct": "Seven", "options": ["Six", "Five", "Eight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven.\n\n\tThe seven hammers help you get higher to a new platform.  Try jumping up before another hammer smashes you, and you will land on the second hammer.  Keep working your way up until you get to the top, with a total of seven hammers. \n"}, {"text": "How many plane parts were in the plane level, not counting the parts of WHOLE planes?", "correct": "Fifteen", "options": ["Twenty", "Ten", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFifteen.\n\n\tThere were fifteen plane parts scattered about, mostly right by the picture of the Cooper.  Sly was amazed that he could make a plane as early as he did, because it was very good technology for the time period he lived in. \n"}, {"text": "During the last battle with Dr. M, what was not a vehicle to hid under while he shot his laser at you?", "correct": "Plane", "options": ["Helicopter", "Boat", "Car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlane.\n\n\tEven though Sly just finished making a statement about the plane, he did not hide under one.  When Dr. M came, the plane fell from the roof and crashed.  The other three were under the floor until the laser came out.  The first vehicle to hide under was a boat, then the car came second, and you hid under the helicopter last. \n"}]}
