Kramer is shocked and wonders how he can stay friends with him.  Jerry decides that ultimately, he'll buy his father a Cadillac in order to make him feel good.\rMeanwhile, Elaine has lunch with her friend, Katie, and George enters the cafe.  The two meet each other and Elaine explains that George just got engaged.

Before he leaves, George visits and asks if Jerry plans to sleep on the notorious fold-out couch which has caused numerous recurring back injuries since Season Three.  He states that he is.\rGeorge goes on about how he could have been set up with Marisa Tomei and Jerry comments on how she has those full lips that George enjoys.  George likes these types of lips because they're something that you can really smack lipstick onto.

Where does this cable guy work?", "correct": "Plaza Cable", "options": ["NY Cable", "Edison Cable", "Cable Plus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlaza Cable.\n\n\tJerry is the first to encounter the cable guy.  He ends up knocking on his door asking if he's seen Kramer in the last little while and Jerry sends the man off, claiming that he'll give Kramer the message.  Shortly after, Kramer emerges from his apartment to explain that he's been getting HBO and Showtime for free.  He decides that a two hour wait isn't good enough to get back at the cable guys, as they run such messed up schedules that it's fair to retaliate.  Meanwhile, George considers having coffee with Marisa Tomei and begins watching \"My Cousin Vinny\".\rLater, Jerry begins packing for his trip, Elaine realizes Jerry's financial position, Kramer hides in Jerry's apartment, and George talks to Elaine about meeting Ms. Tomei. \n"}, {"text": "Who is initially against the idea of having the Cadillac?", "correct": "Helen Seinfeld", "options": ["George", "Morty Seinfeld", "Elaine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHelen Seinfeld.\n\n\tElaine ends up calling Katie regarding Marisa Tomei, but unfortunately, she is in the hospital for an irregular heartbeat.  George decides to visit her to get the date.\rJerry surprises his parents with the visit to Florida and he shows them the new Cadillac in their driveway.  Morty is immediately shocked and happy with the purchase, but Helen wonders why he would do something so trivial as spend his money on his parents.  Jack Klompus later discovers that Morty has the new Cadillac and uses it against him.  Morty offers him a ride, but he refuses, thinking that it's a stupid idea.\rKramer ends up hiding in his apartment listening to messages from the Plaza Cable guy. \n"}, {"text": "Which home phone feature does Kramer pretend to have while on the phone with the cable guy?", "correct": "Call waiting", "options": ["Caller ID", "Voicemail", "Call transfer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCall waiting.\n\n\tKramer ends up getting a phone call from the cable guy, but in order to trick Kramer, the guy ends up pretending to be from the phone services.  Kramer says that his call waiting feature is acting up and later reveals that he has never had the feature in order to trick the guy (who is unwittingly calling from a payphone directly outside Kramer's apartment window).  Kramer catches on to this, puts the man on hold and escapes the apartment in a taxi, only leaning out the window to invite the cable guy to watch \"Chunnel\" on his free HBO.\rMeanwhile, Morty has trouble in Florida.  When he tries to perform his duties as President of the community, Jack Klompus makes note of Morty's supposed new 'windfall' and suggests that they force him to impeachment because he's been stealing from the treasury.  They simply don't believe that Jerry could pay for the car because they saw his material. \n"}, {"text": "Who ends up calling Jerry from New York during his stay in Florida?", "correct": "Elaine", "options": ["None of these", "Kramer", "George"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElaine.\n\n\tIn Florida, the Seinfelds are faced with the idea of impeachment.  A woman named Evelyn tells Morty and Helen that they have three votes for impeachment, three against, and one undecided.  They decide to invite the one undecided voter, Ms. Choate, to their place to hear their side of the story.  They soon realize that they're losing all of their friends because of the car.\rIn New York, Kramer is becoming suspicious of every phone call he gets, George watches 'Only You\", another Marisa Tomei movie, and Susan become suspicious of the random, odd things that he begins doing around the apartment.  Elaine ends up staying up at night calling Jerry to see how he's doing.  unfortunately, he's also spending a sleepless night, only it's on the horrible fold-out bed at his parents' place. \n"}, {"text": "According to Elaine and George's alibi, what does Art Vandelay want to solely focus on?", "correct": "Importing", "options": ["Neither of these", "Exporting", "Both of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nImporting.\n\n\tGeorge ends up calling Marisa Tomei from the coffee shop while Elaine sits at a table.  After the call, he comments on how excited he is and he forces Elaine to sit down with him and discuss an alibi in case Susan somehow manages to catch onto the plan.  They decide that Elaine is dating a man named Art Vandelay and that he's an importer/exporter.  She is having a problem with his job and the fact that he wants to focus solely on the importing while forgetting entirely about the exporting.\rMeanwhile, Jerry is introduced to Ms. Choate, who he clearly remembers from New York.  He stole a marble rye from her a couple episodes prior to this one in order for George to execute an obscure plan. \n"}, {"text": "What is it that Elaine claims that Art Vandelay exports?", "correct": "Diapers", "options": ["Potato Chips", "Leather", "Cloth and fabrics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiapers.\n\n\tOn the date of George's meeting with Marisa Tomei, he executes his plan.

Susan quickly asks if he's having an affair with Elaine and he denies it quite quickly.\rLater, Susan visits Elaine to ask about the ordeal and Elaine goes along with the plan.  However, Susan asks what Art Vandelay imports and exports, to which Elaine responds potato chips and diapers respectively.  She quickly realizes that her discussion with George didn't entail that detail, so she quickly tries to reach him.\rMeanwhile, Kramer is stalked by the cable guy.  One one day, while he is walking with his groceries, he is pursued by the cable guy in the New York City streets.  The two jump fences, cross parks, and climb buildings before Kramer is able to create a distance between the two of them and finally escape. \n"}, {"text": "At what time do Jerry's parents suggest they go to dinner?", "correct": "Before 6:00pm", "options": ["At exactly 7:00pm", "After 9:00pm", "Before 3:00pm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBefore 6:00pm.\n\n\tMorty and Helen tell Jerry to get ready for dinner at 4:30pm because that way they can catch the Early Bird Special at the restaurant and only pay $4.95 for their meal.  The deal only goes on until 6:00pm.  Jerry tells them that it's an unsightly hour to go to dinner so they all wait in the house until Jerry says that he'll treat them to the later dinner special.  When they arrive, everyone has finished their meals and Jack Klompus makes the false observation that the Seinfelds are rich enough to pay for their later, more expensive meal- possibly because Morty is stealing funds from the treasury.\rMeanwhile, George goes on his date with Marisa Tomei where he gives her his 'manure talk' where he basically discusses how 'manure' is a great word (being 'newer' with a 'ma-' in front).  Unfortunately, after Marisa comments on how much he likes his wit, smarts, and baldness, George lets it slip that he's engaged, and Marisa punches him in the face and leaves. \n"}, {"text": "Is Morty Seinfeld impeached in the end?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIn the end, Morty does get the fourth deciding vote from Mrs. Choate, but the term 'old bag' triggers a flashback in her mind that unfortunately causes her to remember that it was Jerry who stole her marble rye.  She and the other three against impeachment change their votes and Morty is forced to leave the condos to get a new place at Del Boca Vista.  Jack Klompus is introduced as President of The Pines.\rMeanwhile, back in New York, Elaine never gets a hold of George, and he returns home to accidentally tell Susan that Art imports long matches.  Susan punches him for lying about it.\rThe cable guy finally gives in and apologizes to Kramer for the long wait times and poor customer service.  Kramer accepts the apology and gives the cable guy a hug outside his apartment. \n"}]}
