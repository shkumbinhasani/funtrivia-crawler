Romero?", "correct": "Demise of the Dead", "options": ["Dawn of the Dead", "Diary of the Dead", "Day of the Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDemise of the Dead.\n\n\tGeorge A. Romero, known for creating the nightmarish, shambling revenants in the original \"Night of the Living Dead\", proceeded onwards with the series in \"Dawn\", \"Day\", \"Land\", \"Diary\", and \"Survival of the Dead\".  Although earlier films in the series focused on the zombies and horror aspect, later films (such as \"Diary of the Dead\") were prone to introduce much more important themes of social awareness.  It kind of retracted from the undead matters at hand.\rGeorge A. Romero is often regarded as the father of zombie flicks, though he also directed \"Creepshow\" and \"The Dark Half\", both of which were adapted from Stephen King works. \n"}, {"text": "Produced by Dario Argento, what Lamberto Bava gore-fest released in 1985 took place (mostly) in a movie theater?", "correct": "Demons", "options": ["Don't Pick Up the Phone!", "Dead Sleep", "Day of the Beast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDemons.\n\n\tA very graphic foray into Italian gore-horror, \"Demons\" (known in Italy as \"Demoni\") followed a group of movie-goers watching an exclusive feature film.  When one of the viewers accidentally cut herself on one of the film's props, she violently transformed into a hideous demon... and then more people followed the same fate in very bloody manners.  Eventually, when the demon forces found an emergency exit (the whole building is barricaded shut, of course), the whole ordeal went on the loose.  The protagonists were forced to crawl through vents, unearth an ancient temple, evade demons, ride a motorcycle through the theater, and find a way out.  Amazing, really.\r\"Demons\" was followed by the aptly-titled \"Demons 2\" (brought to us by Argento and Bava once more) in 1986, the year after \"Demoni\" was released. \n"}, {"text": "Revolving around the story of an evil tooth fairy, what 2003 horror film took place in a seaside town?", "correct": "Darkness Falls", "options": ["The Dentist", "The Devil's Backbone", "Dark Walker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarkness Falls.\n\n\t\"Darkness Falls\", starring Chaney Kley and Emma Caulfield, based its premise of the idea on the tooth fairy who, at one point or another, was severely burned.  As a result, she wore a disturbing porcelain mask and continued to take teeth until children started to go missing.  She's killed and vows revenge and the boys suddenly return, having never actually been kidnapped... oops!  Now she haunts Darkness Falls killing the children who lose their last baby tooth the moment they touch the shadows.\rFirst-time director Jonathan Liebesman began with this film.  He later did work on the Platinum Dunes film \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning\". \n"}, {"text": "Based on a book by \"Ring\" author Koji Susuki, which Jennifer Connelly film was released in 2005?", "correct": "Dark Water", "options": ["The Diary", "Deep Rising", "Dagon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDark Water.\n\n\tAdapted from the short story \"Floating Water\", \"Dark Water\" followed Jennifer Connelly as she and her daughter move into a dilapidated apartment in New York after her separation.  Soon, after odd things start happening in the apartment from leaky ceilings to dripping taps and flooded hallways, it is discovered that the spirit of a young girl may be haunting their new home.\rOther films to be adapted from Koji Susuki's works include \"Dream Cruise\", which was the final episode of Showtime's \"Masters of Horror\" anthology, and \"The Ring\". \n"}, {"text": "Which critically well-faring horror film released in 2005 took place almost entirely underground?", "correct": "The Descent", "options": ["Dementia", "The Deep", "Darkness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Descent.\n\n\tDirected by Neil Marshall, who worked on \"Dog Soldiers\" and \"Doomsday\" as well (lots of 'D' movies...), \"The Descent\" began its visceral and claustrophobic story when a group of female cave-divers decide to spelunk a deep, otherwise closed-off cave system as opposed to a safer one nearby, only to find that nocturnal creatures were dwelling inside.  Trapped in precarious circumstances, the girls must break for the surface and maintain their own sanity while these creatures pursue them in their natural habitat.\rGrossing $60,000,000 and being very well-received by critics, \"The Descent\" was greenlit for a sequel in 2009 to continue the story. \n"}, {"text": "In Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 adaptation of the classic novel, Gary Oldman played which title character?", "correct": "Dracula", "options": ["Dr. Caligari", "Death (The Grim Reaper)", "The Devil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDracula.\n\n\tAlthough the character Dracula has appeared in over two hundred films, \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (released in 1992) is often regarded as one of the most stylized imaginings of the famous horror figure.  Immortalized in Universal and Hammer Films over the decades, the macabre, aristocratic vampire is one of the most popular characters in film.  The 1992 version directed by Coppola featured Gary Oldman in the title role and won two Academy Awards.\rIn 2000, director Patrick Lussier reimagined the classic Gothic tale with \"Dracula 2000\", starring a then-unknown Gerard Butler.  This trilogy brought the story to modern times and scored low in terms of reviews.  The first in the series was the only one to go to theaters.  Lussier would later go on to direct the 3D remake of \"My Bloody Valentine\" in 2009. \n"}, {"text": "Directed by David Cronenberg, what Stephen King-written film spawned a TV show starring Anthony Michael Hall?", "correct": "The Dead Zone", "options": ["Dreamcatcher", "Duma Key", "The Dark Half"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dead Zone.\n\n\tThe fifth of Stephen King's collective works, \"The Dead Zone\" was released as a novel in 1979.  The film, released in 1983, starred Christopher Walken in the main role and followed the story of a man who awakens from a coma after five years to learn that everything has changed.  Soon, he discovers that he has the ability to see a person's future by touching them.  A chain of events he realizes by touching one politician, however, allows him to foresee a nuclear catastrophe ending with the apocalypse.\rAfter the success of \"The Dead Zone\" (which earned double its ten million dollar budget), a TV show was made in 2002.  Lasting five years and six seasons, the show followed a similar storyline to the film and progressed beyond the scope of the novel. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these films was about killer sharks in an underwater facility?", "correct": "Deep Blue Sea", "options": ["Dead Rising", "The Dive", "Deep Impact"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeep Blue Sea.\n\n\tReleased in 1999, \"Deep Blue Sea\" starred Samuel L. Sackson, Thomas Jane, and LL Cool J.  Notorious for killing off the Samuel L. Jackson less than half-way into the film (I tell you, he's better on snake-filled aircraft), it grossed more than $150,000,000.  Director Renny Harlin was infamous for setting back his then-wife Geena Davis' career a good ten years after the box office bomb \"Cutthroat Island\".  He also directed one of the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" movies.\r\"Deep Blue Sea\", although not critically popular, was possibly one of the highest-grossing shark films since \"Jaws 2\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of these films, released as part of an After Dark Horrorfest, was written by Clive Barker as part of his \"Books of Blood\" anthology?", "correct": "Dread", "options": ["Dying Breed", "The Deaths of Ian Stone", "Dark Ride"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDread.\n\n\tThe first short story in Clive Barker's second \"Books of Blood\" collection, \"Dread\" was an experiment in fear in which one college student submits others to their worst phobias to examine dread under certain circumstances.

Nevertheless, director James Wan (known for the first \"Saw\" film and \"Death Sentence\") used many different elements to produce an overall creepy film about an evil puppeteer and her cavalcade of evil ventriloquist dolls.  As if people didn't find them creepy enough, right?\rOne man must return to the hometown of his youth, Raven's Fair, to determine why his wife was viciously killed, but he discovers that there's much more at hand.  A terrible curse is upon many people in the town, and you have to make sure not to scream when you see Mary Shaw... \n"}]}
