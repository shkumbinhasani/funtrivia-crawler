{"id": "146420", "name": "'Harold and Maude' (Part 5) Multiple Choice Quiz | Harold and Maude . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "   Movies H-K", "Harold and Maude"], "questions": [{"text": "We begin this quiz at an amusement park, where Harold and Maude whirl the night away on what old-time ride?", "correct": "Trabant", "options": ["Haunted house", "Log flume", "Wild mouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrabant.\n\n\tRemember those wonderful old non-themed amusement parks that seemed to pop up in every city?  You can only find them here and there now, but who can forget cool rides like the Trabant that spun folks around so thoroughly that a few queasy accidents were almost ensured.  Fortunately, this does not happen to Harold or Maude! \n"}, {"text": "Who appears briefly between Harold and Maude when they look on at the model trains during their visit to the amusement park?", "correct": "Hal Ashby", "options": ["Robert Altman", "Cat Stevens", "Peter Sellers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHal Ashby.\n\n\tHal Ashby, the director of the film, appears standing between Harold and Maude for a brief moment while they view the toy train set at the park.  The camera shows a close-up of Ashby first, and then pans out to display Maude, Ashby and Harold, respectively, standing behind a glass screen.  Ashby disappears after the scene shifts to the trains and back to Harold and Maude.  It's always fun to play the 'locate the director' game, isn't it?  Cat Stevens also makes a brief cameo appearance at the second funeral.  He is the man sitting in front of Maude. \n"}, {"text": "While Maude entertains a crowd playing some sort of game, Harold creates a small trinket with an inscription for his new 'girlfriend'.  What does this little ornamental item say?", "correct": "Harold loves Maude", "options": ["Harold and Maude forever", "Harold plus Maude equals true love", "Will you marry me?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarold loves Maude.\n\n\tHarold is still such a young, innocent boy.  Maude very much appreciates the sentiment, however, as she is young at heart as well.  After Harold hands Maude the trinket, she tosses it into the sea 'so she will always know where it is'.  Following this scene...fireworks! \n"}, {"text": "Harold has decided to get married to Maude, and announces his intentions to his mother.  Does Harold get married to Maude in the film?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tSadly, Maude takes her own life before Harold can make his intentions known.  Maude, of course, has never had the intention of marrying Harold, she simply wanted to expand his horizons! \n"}, {"text": "Harold's mother, distressed about his plans to marry, sends Harold off to see several specialists.  With whom does he not have a meeting in this set of very funny scenes?", "correct": "His school counsellor", "options": ["His military Uncle Victor", "His priest", "His psychiatrist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis school counsellor.\n\n\tOf course, none of these specialists approve of Harold's plans.  Uncle Victor finds Harold's plans very strange, while the psychiatrist is curious about his second-generation Oedipal complex.  The priest's speech is the most hilarious as he struggles to describe the withered features of the elderly anatomy. \n"}, {"text": "Harold's plans are to culminate on Maude's birthday, which arrives on Saturday.  In order to make the presentation acceptable, Harold has decorated Maude's walls with what paper cut-out items?", "correct": "Flowers", "options": ["Dragonflies", "Spiders", "Coffins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlowers.\n\n\tHarold has apparently gotten over the morbid stage in his life; he chooses sunflowers (recall, Maude claimed she wanted to return in the next life as a sunflower).  He also provides a cake and some organic champagne. \n"}, {"text": "Contrary to Harold's plans, Maude has chosen her 80th birthday to commit suicide.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhile Harold intends to ask Maude for her hand in marriage, Maude has other intentions.  Prior to the birthday party, she claims to have 'taken the tablets' that will produce her death.  Harold's reaction is one of shock and anger, naturally...but Maude is perfectly content with her decision.  Ah, the irony of this film... \n"}, {"text": "Does Maude pass away by the end of the film?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWe see Harold receive the news about Maude's death, though it's not officially announced.  His head droops as the doctor approaches, making the news he has to offer pretty obvious. \n"}, {"text": "The film ends with Harold committing suicide by driving his car over a cliff.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOnce again, Harold pulls a fast one on us.  Though his car careens over a cliff onto the seashore below, Harold remains very much alive on the hill above.  The film ends with Harold walking away playing his banjo.  Apparently, the young man has learned his lesson from Maude and will choose to live! \n"}, {"text": "The credits run while which lovely song plays in the background?", "correct": "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out", "options": ["On the Road to Find Out", "Trouble", "Don't Be Shy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIf You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out.\n\n\tOnce again, another Cat Stevens tune, this one more or less the 'theme song' of the film, if there is to be one.  Maude plays the song on her player piano, and we hear it several other times during the film.  Harold plucks it on his banjo as he walks up the hill at the end of the film.
