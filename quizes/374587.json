It also reached number ten in the Billboard 100 chart in the U.S. Their debut album, \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" released in 1984, topped the UK album chart and spawned two more UK number one singles, \"Two Tribes\" and \"The Power of Love\".\rFGTH produced only one more album, \"Liverpool\" released in 1986, before breaking up in 1987.\rThe alternatives are three more English bands formed in 1980, Depeche Mode were from Essex, Level 42 from the Isle of Wight, and Heaven 17 from Sheffield. \n"}, {"text": "Drummer Joey Kramer and bass player Tom Hamilton have been members of which rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970?
