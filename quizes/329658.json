Almost a century later, in 1277, the St George's Cross was adopted as the official flag of England and Wales, although the 'Three Lions' remained as the coat of arms and the flag of the monarch. \n"}, {"text": "Which modern country now covers the ground shared by the ancient Berber kingdom of Numidia and the Roman province of Mauretania?", "correct": "Algeria", "options": ["Morocco", "Sudan", "Ethiopia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlgeria.\n\n\tThe land now occupied by Algeria was originally known as the Kingdom of Numidia, and its people were Numidians. For almost seven centuries, it was part of the Western Roman Empire. Then came the Byzantines and, in their turn, the Arabs, the Spanish, the Ottomans and the French.

Wilhelmina became Queen at just 10 years old on the death of her father, William III, in November 1890. She reigned for more than 57 years, through both World Wars, before abdicating in 1948. At 39 years of age, Juliana took over from her mother and reigned until her abdication on her 71st birthday in 1980. Beatrix became Queen in 1980 at the age of 42, and completed her 30th year on the throne in 2010. \n"}, {"text": "What are former US President George H.W Bush's middle names?", "correct": "Herbert Walker", "options": ["Henry Wallace", "Horace Walpole", "Humphrey Walton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHerbert Walker.\n\n\tGeorge Herbert Walker Bush was born in Milton, Massachusetts in 1924.

So, too, were all of the 16th Century monarchs, Philip II, Philip III, Philip IV and Charles II. When Charles II died in 1700, the throne passed to his sister's grandson, Philip V, the first monarch from the House of Bourbon. Three hundred years later, despite one or two interruptions along the way, the House of Bourbon still sits on the Spanish throne in the form of King Juan Carlos I. \n"}, {"text": "In 1991, \u00c9dith Cresson became the first female Prime Minister of which European country?", "correct": "France", "options": ["Norway", "Belgium", "Italy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrance.\n\n\tMaximilien de B\u00e9thune, Duc de Sully, became the first Prime Minister of France in 1589.

Unlike most British prime ministers, Major did not go to university. Indeed, he left school at the age of 16 in 1959 with just 3 O-levels (and acquired three more later via correspondence courses). The British media's portrayal of him as 'The Grey Man' perhaps gives a clue to his former profession as a banker. \n"}]}
