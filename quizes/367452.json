What is it?", "correct": "Thriller", "options": ["Black or White", "Smooth Criminal", "Billie Jean"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThriller.\n\n\t\"Thriller\" is, by sales records, one of the best-selling singles ever released, and the album (released in 1982) also broke sales records, going twenty-nine times platinum in the U.S. alone over several decades.  The \"Thriller\" music video, directed by John Landis, was fourteen minutes long and is one of the most famous music videos of all time, having been the first inducted into the National Film Registry in the States.  Other singles from the \"Thriller\" album include \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", \"The Girl is Mine\", and \"Human Nature\".\r \"Thriller\" was brought to this Setlist by George95. \n"}, {"text": "Although Big Joe Turner was the first to record this song, it was Bill Haley & His Comets who had a hit with this 1954 song, also used during the end credits of the film \"Clue\" (1985).  What's its title?", "correct": "Shake, Rattle and Roll", "options": ["Rock Around the Clock", "Yakety Sax", "Chattanooga Choo Choo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShake, Rattle and Roll.\n\n\tA clever song for a film about a board game, \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" was one of the biggest hits for Bill Haley & His Comets who, after 1954 and the release of the song, continued their shot upward into fame with the newly-emerging sound of rock and roll.  All of the other choices listed were among their hits.\r\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" was listed as one of \"Rolling Stone's\" '500 Greatest Songs of All Time' and was covered by Presley during what was, perhaps, his most successful year (1955).  Haley's version was considerably more popular, being a seminal hit for the genre.\r Dcpddc478 suggested the entry. \n"}, {"text": "What new wave song by British synthpop artist M (released in 1979) suggested \"You're livin' in a disco, forget about the rat race\"?", "correct": "Pop Muzik", "options": ["Eureka", "That's the Way the Money Goes", "Danube"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPop Muzik.\n\n\t\"Pop Muzik\" was the first and, arguably, the only major international hit for Robin Scott, a British musician who performed under the single letter M.  The song was released in 1979, topping the Billboard Hot 100 (before a hit by the Eagles took it down) and peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart.  It ended up appearing on the album \"New York - London - Paris - Munich\" released in the same year though it failed to chart in its home country (the UK).\r This single comes to us courtesy of DaBomb619. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these songs is from the 1991 album \"Levelling the Land\" by The Levellers?", "correct": "Another Man's Cause", "options": ["Definitely, Maybe", "Only Wanna Be with You", "She's So High"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnother Man's Cause.\n\n\tWhile it was never released as a single in the still young band's repertoire, the song made its appearance on their second album which, peaking at number fourteen on the UK Albums Chart, made a modest showing.  The band would find more fame a few years later with their eponymous album and number one charting disc \"Zeitgeist\".  They continued to release albums decades later, still maintaining their folk-rock stylings with otherwise unconventional instruments.\r Much thanks to Rowena8482 for the recommendation. \n"}, {"text": "Irish alt-rock band Bell X1 is known for their blending of alternative and electronic styles.  Which of these was a single they released on their \"Flock\" album in 2005?", "correct": "Bigger Than Me", "options": ["What You Know", "An Awesome Wave", "Velcro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBigger Than Me.\n\n\tThough they were not the first to combine rock and electronic, they were most certainly not the last.  They may, however, be one of the few bands with staying power in the subgenre.  Hailing from Dublin, Ireland, Bell X1 has been in the business since 2000 and has grown to great acclaim in their home country (despite not being a major draw in North America).  Their third album, released back in 2005, was led by the hit \"Bigger Than Me\", which peaked at number sixteen on the Irish Singles Chart.  They topped it in 2009 with a number three single, \"The Great Defector\" while the \"Flock\" album topped the Irish Albums Chart.\r EmmaF2008 brought this song to the Setlist from her home country. \n"}, {"text": "\"Oh it's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for something dumb to do.\"\n\nWhat did Bruno Mars suggest he would do in a 2011 single from his \"Doo-Wops and Hooligans\" album?", "correct": "Marry You", "options": ["Catch a Grenade For You", "Love You Just the Way You Are", "Lock You Out of Heaven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarry You.\n\n\tWhile \"Grenade\" and \"Just the Way You Are\" were both earlier singles from the same album (as was \"The Lazy Song\", \"Marry You\" is the only one to contain the selected lyric. A song literally about going to a chapel and getting married (you know, while drinking some tequila), the upbeat release was far from a chart-topper, reaching only number eighty-five in the United States (though doing significantly better internationally).  It didn't stop his debut album from going two times platinum in the U.S. though.\r Matthew_07 is to be noted for getting this song into the Setlist. \n"}, {"text": "Released by their Sub Pop label in 2010, which of these songs appeared on American duo Beach House's \"Teen Dream\" album?", "correct": "Walk in the Park", "options": ["Lovlier Girl", "Heart and Lungs", "Apple Orchard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalk in the Park.\n\n\tAll three incorrect answers were actually on the indie duo's debut album.  Known for their almost ethereal sound, Beach House, consisting of Victoria Legrand on keys and Alex Scally on guitar, was picked up by Sub Pop before the release of \"Teen Dream\" in 2010, allowing them to push the envelope on their already trademark sound and provide a critically lauded release enjoyed by many looking for rather yet-to-be-discovered music.  While the band comes from Maryland, they're typically known for being on tour for music festivals around North America.\r For this entry to the Setlist, you'd have to thank Snowman. \n"}, {"text": "What famous 1983 song by Stevie Ray Vaughan claims \"She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy\"?", "correct": "Pride and Joy", "options": ["Superstition", "Love Struck Baby", "Testify"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPride and Joy.\n\n\tPerhaps Stevie Ray Vaughan's signature song, \"Pride and Joy\" is an upbeat, bluesy-rock song from the early 1980s off his debut album, \"Texas Flood\".  While it never appeared on the Billboard Hot 100, the song was an early solo hit for the rocker, showing at number twenty on the Billboard Rock Chart.  Vaughan also performed on albums by David Bowie and James Brown in the 1980s though his biggest successes were with his band, Double Trouble.  He was killed in 1990 in a helicopter crash.\r You'd need to look to Squisher for this entry to the Setlist. \n"}, {"text": "Although not originally by Frank and Nancy Sinatra, this song released by them in 1967 became the first-ever father-daughter number one song in the U.S.  What was its name?", "correct": "Somethin' Stupid", "options": ["Strangers in the Night", "Nancy (With the Laughing Face)", "My Way"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomethin' Stupid.\n\n\t\"Somethin' Stupid\" was hardly stupid for the Sinatras who, famous for different styles of music in their days, ended up earning gold albums with this Billboard number one track.  The song was later redone by Nicole Kidman and Robbie Williams in 2001, but the most famous version is undoubtedly the one the father-daughter duo recorded in 1967.\r Zorba_Scank thought wisely by recommending this song for the Setlist. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps Australian ska music is your thing.

Their \"Cinema\" album, their fifth, added jazz and blues elements to their otherwise alternative stylings and peaked at number three on the ARIA Albums Chart after its release.  \"Reasonably Fine\" was one of the tracks though only \"Feeling's Gone\" was pushed as a single.  The topical song in question was written solely by one of the lead vocalists.\r You can turn to Eburge for giving us this track from Down Under. \n"}]}
