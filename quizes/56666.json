{"id": "56666", "name": "The Police: Lyrics and More Quiz | Music | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music L-P", " The Police"], "questions": [{"text": "'The factory belches filth into the sky'", "correct": "'Synchronicity II'", "options": ["'Canary In a Coalmine'", "'Dead End Job'", "'Invisible Sun'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Synchronicity II'.\n\n\tFrom 1983's 'Synchronicity,' The Police's fifth and final album of original material. \n"}, {"text": "'I shake like an incurable...God help me, please'", "correct": "'Hole In My Life'", "options": ["'King Of Pain'", "'Bring On the Night'", "'Darkness'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Hole In My Life'.\n\n\tFrom 1978's 'Outlandos D'Amour,' their first full album. This song has perhaps the most memorable discordant ending in history. \n"}, {"text": "'How can you say that you're not responsible?'", "correct": "'Driven To Tears'", "options": ["'Miss Gradenko'", "'Rehumanize Yourself'", "'Truth Hits Everybody'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Driven To Tears'.\n\n\tThe opening line of 'Driven To Tears,' from 1980's 'Zenyatta Mondatta.' 'Driven To Tears' leads directly into 'When the World Is Running Down, You Make the Best Of What's Still Around,' which must be one of the longest track titles I've ever seen. \n"}, {"text": "'You stay -- I may as well play'", "correct": "'Walking On the Moon'", "options": ["'Voices Inside My Head'", "'Tea In the Sahara'", "'Born in the 50's'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Walking On the Moon'.\n\n\tFrom 1979's 'Regatta De Blanc.' \n"}, {"text": "'Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis'", "correct": "'Wrapped Around Your Finger'", "options": ["'Does Everyone Stare'", "'Too Much Information'", "'Man In a Suitcase'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Wrapped Around Your Finger'.\n\n\tFrom 'Synchronicity.' Sting no doubt fell back on his classical education to come up with this reference. Scylla and Charybdis, in Greek mythology, were two monsters who waited on opposite sides of the Strait of Messina (between Italy and Sicily) for ships to pass between them. If savvy sailors somehow avoided being killed by one of the monsters, the other would prove inescapable. Only Jason and the Argonauts ever made it through the Strait safely, and that was only because they had help from one of the Nereids (sea goddesses). \n"}, {"text": "'I strained to understand him...I chased his thoughts like birds'", "correct": "'Secret Journey'", "options": ["'Behind My Camel'", "'Demolition Man'", "'Masoko Tanga'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Secret Journey'.\n\n\tFrom 1981's 'Ghost In the Machine.' \n"}, {"text": "'I won't share you with another boy'", "correct": "'Roxanne'", "options": ["'Hungry For You'", "'Every Breath You Take'", "'Be My Girl Sally'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Roxanne'.\n\n\tFrom 'Outlandos D'Amour.' Figured an easy one was warranted. =) \n"}, {"text": "'I resolved to call her up a thousand times a day'", "correct": "'Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic'", "options": ["'So Lonely'", "'Bring On the Night'", "'I Burn For You'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic'.\n\n\tOkay, two easy ones. This one's from 'Ghost In the Machine,' and it's easily one of my favorite Police songs. \n"}, {"text": "'Living on my own was the least of my fears'", "correct": "'The Bed's Too Big Without You'", "options": ["'When the World Is Running Down, You Make the Best Of What's Still Around'", "'Bombs Away'", "'Murder By Numbers'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Bed's Too Big Without You'.\n\n\tFrom 'Regatta De Blanc.' Yep, that queen-size can sometimes feel pretty big, all right... \n"}, {"text": "'Logic so inflexible'", "correct": "'Synchronicity I'", "options": ["'Murder By Numbers'", "'Truth Hits Everybody'", "'Too Much Information'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Synchronicity I'.\n\n\tThe opening track of 'Synchronicity.' \n"}, {"text": "'They subjugate the meek...but it's the rhetoric of failure'", "correct": "'Spirits In the Material World'", "options": ["'Driven To Tears'", "'Nothing Achieving'", "'O My God'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Spirits In the Material World'.\n\n\tAnother politically charged number from 'Ghost In the Machine.' \n"}, {"text": "Finish this line from 'Don't Stand So Close To Me': 'Wet bus stop -- she's waiting -- ___________________'", "correct": "his car is warm and dry", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nhis car is warm and dry.\n\n\tA cautionary tale for young teachers from 'Zenyatta Mondatta.' Since Sting spent part of his pre-superstar career being called 'Mr. Sumner' by classrooms full of high school students, one has to wonder if there's an autobiographical slant to this song. \n"}, {"text": "The Police's manager was a blood relative of which member of the band?", "correct": "the drummer", "options": ["He wasn't related to any member of the band", "the bass player", "the guitarist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe drummer.\n\n\tMiles Copeland III is the brother of drummer extraordinaire Stewart Copeland. \n"}, {"text": "When Sting went solo, he included on one of his albums a revamped version of a lesser-known Police song. Which one was it?", "correct": "'Shadows In the Rain'", "options": ["'Born In the 50's'", "'One World (Not Three)'", "'Mother'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Shadows In the Rain'.\n\n\t'Shadows In the Rain' originally appeared as a fairly laborious track on 'Zenyatta Mondatta.' Sting whipped it into an upbeat number on his first solo album, 'The Dream Of the Blue Turtles.' \n"}, {"text": "At the very end of 'O My God,' the third track of 'Synchronicity,' we hear some familiar lyrics 'ghosted' in from an earlier Police hit. Which one is it?", "correct": "'Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic'", "options": ["'Roxanne'", "'Don't Stand So Close To Me'", "'Message In a Bottle'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic'.\n\n\t'O My God' ends with the same words 'Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic' does: 'Do I have to tell the story of a thousand rainy days since we first met? It's a big enough umbrella, but it's always me that ends up getting wet...' Years later, as a solo artist, Sting 'ghosted' these closing lines into yet another song: 'Seven Days,' from 1993's 'Ten Summoner's Tales.' Accuse him of redundancy if you must, but hearing those lines always makes me smile. \n"}]}
