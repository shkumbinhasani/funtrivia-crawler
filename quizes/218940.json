{"id": "218940", "name": "\"Super Mario 64\" Stages 7-9 Quiz | Super Mario 64 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Mario Games", "Super Mario 64"], "questions": [{"text": "How many Little Bullies must you defeat in the 'Bully the Bullies' task in \"Lethal Lava Land\" before you can fight the Big Bully?", "correct": "Three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree & 3.\n\n\tYou must defeat the Big Bully in not only the second task, but also in the first task, 'Boil the Big Bully'.  To defeat Big Bullies or Little Bullies, the strategy is the same; jump on them until your hits push them into the lava.  When this happens, you'll usually get a coin or a star for your troubles. \n"}, {"text": "How many movable slide puzzle pieces are in \"Lethal Lava Land\"?", "correct": "Fourteen", "options": ["Fifteen", "Four", "Sixteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFourteen.\n\n\tThe sliding pieces rearrange themselves to form a picture of Bowser in the end.  When this happens, a bunch of coins will sprout out of the center of the puzzle.  The area is ventured to in the third task, '8-Coin Puzzle with 15 Pieces' although only fourteen actually move.  The fifteen holds the star when the red coins are picked up. \n"}, {"text": "Which two stars are found inside the volcano in \"Lethal Lava Land\"?", "correct": "#5 and #6", "options": ["#3 and #5", "#4 and #6", "#4 and #5"], "explanation": "\n\n\n#5 and #6.\n\n\tTask #5, 'Hot Foot-It Into the Volcano', and task #6, 'Inside the Volcano' take you into the volcano near the center of the level.  To get into the volcano, all you need to do is jump into the crater when lava isn't spewing out of it.  You can tell that lava is about to begin shooting when the rotating platform around the volcano stops spinning.  Once inside the volcano, you can't exit unless you switch to a different level, you quit the level, or you get a star. \n"}, {"text": "How many stars in \"Shifting Sand Land\" are located within the pyramid?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Two", "One", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\t'Inside the Ancient Pyramid', 'Stand Tall on the Four Pillars', and 'Pyramid Puzzle' all end in the pyramid although 'Stand Tall on the Four Pillars' is half completed outside.  In 'Stand Tall on the Four Pillars', you have to defeat a boss called Eyerok.  To defeat him, you just need to damage the eyes in the palms of his hands. \n"}, {"text": "What is not a red coin location in \"Shifting Sand Land\"?", "correct": "Within the pyramid", "options": ["In the Tox Box maze", "In the air around the pyramid", "In the oasis pool"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWithin the pyramid.\n\n\tAll of the red coins are located outside of the pyramid because once you enter the pyramid, you can't exit unless you are killed (or you get a star).  Four can be found in the air around the pyramid, one is behind the entrance of the level, one is under the small building near the entrance, one is in the maze, and the last is at the oasis. \n"}, {"text": "Is there a Pink Bob-Omb Cannon in \"Shifting Sand Land\"?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThe cannon is located near the Wing Cap in the Tox Box maze.  To activate it, you need to talk to the Pink Bob-omb near the oasis on the other side of the maze.  In this level, there are three Wing Caps which you can use, and by combining the cannons and the caps, you can cross the level very quickly. \n"}, {"text": "How many chests must be opened in the second task of \"Dire, Dire Docks\"?", "correct": "Four & 4", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour & 4.\n\n\tThe second task, 'Chests in the Current', requires you to open the chests in a specific order, much like in \"Jolly Roger Bay\".  Like before, the opened chests will close and you will be damaged if you hit the wrong one, but if you open one, you'll receive an air bubble. \n"}, {"text": "How many stars require you to swim through rings in \"Dire, Dire Docks\"?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Three", "One", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tThe stars 'Through the Jet Stream' and 'The Manta Ray's Reward' require the rings.  To complete them, you need to swim through the rings.  Although the task may be easy to do, the 'jet stream task' requires you to swim through rings as they float up a jet which constantly pushes you upwards.  To prevent this, wear the Metal Cap. \n"}, {"text": "You can find the Vanish Cap in \"Dire, Dire Docks\".", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe Vanish Cap is crucial in retrieving the final star, 'Collect the Caps' (star #6).  To obtain it, put on the cap and find the caged star underwater.  You can simply walk through the cage and get it. \n"}, {"text": "What kind of animal can give you two secret stars in the basement of Peach's Castle?", "correct": "Rabbit", "options": ["Rat", "Raccoon", "Cat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRabbit.\n\n\tMips the Rabbit can be found hopping around the bottom floor of the castle.  He will give you a star if you catch him before you have fifty stars, and once after.  Although the rabbit is small and harmless, catching him may be a bit of a hassle.  The rabbit jumps like a beast and emits a loud squeaking sound every time it jumps, so you really have to dive to catch him. \n"}]}
