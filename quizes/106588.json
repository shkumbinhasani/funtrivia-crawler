{"id": "106588", "name": "Arcadia Quiz | Authors | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors Q-S", "S"], "questions": [{"text": "Here's an easy one: what does Thomasina want Septimus to explain to her at the opening of the play?", "correct": "Carnal Embrace", "options": ["Picturesque Gardening Style", "Fermat's Last Theorem", "Chaos Theory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarnal Embrace.\n\n\tThomasina, like any curious young lady, wants to know more about the birds and the bees.  Stoppard is a master of languages, and Septimus confuses Thomasina by saying carnal embrace is a matter of hugging meat. \n"}, {"text": "What is the title of Ezra Chater's latest poem?", "correct": "The Couch of Eros", "options": ["The Maid of Turkey", "The Aeneid", "Ryme of the Ancient Mariner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Couch of Eros.\n\n\tSeptimus is reviewing Ezra Chater's newest opus, \"The Couch of Eros.\"  It stinks!  Woo-ee!  There are few things Stoppard likes more than making fun of literary academia. \n"}, {"text": "Where were Septimus and Mrs. Chater found fooling around?", "correct": "Gazebo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGazebo.\n\n\tCarnal embrace in the gazebo? Dear me! How do you fit a side of beef there? \n"}, {"text": "What subject is Hannah writing a book on?", "correct": "The Sidley Hermit", "options": ["Chater's Death at the Hand of Byron", "Chaos Theory", "Picturesque Gardening"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sidley Hermit.\n\n\tThe Sidley Hermit, who was drawn into a picture by Thomasina, is the subject of Hannah's latest work. \n"}, {"text": "What surname does Chloe give Bernard?", "correct": "Peacock", "options": ["Nightingale", "Pigeon", "Turkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeacock.\n\n\tHis real name is Bernard Nightingale, but he tells Chloe to give another name to Hannah, so as to disguise himself.  Chloe chooses Bernard Peacock, but promptly blows his cover.  What a jerk!  Once again, Stoppard playing with language, switching Nightingale for Peacock. \n"}, {"text": "Who never speaks?", "correct": "Gus", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGus.\n\n\tGus, the \"modern day Augustus\", is a blind-mute.  Just kidding! He just chooses not to speak. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills Ezra Chater?", "correct": "A monkey", "options": ["Captain Brice", "Septimus Hodge", "Lord Byron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA monkey.\n\n\tAlthough Bernard wants Chater's killer to by Lord Byron, and Septimus and Chater are supposed to have a duel, Chater's murderer is none other than a monkey. How ironic.  Or not.  In any case, this is another way that Stoppard pokes fun at literary academia (the whole premise of Bernard's work is that Byron murdered Chater). \n"}, {"text": "What does Lady Croom tell Septimus to bring to her chambers?", "correct": "A book", "options": ["A condom", "A libido", "Thomasina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA book.\n\n\tLady Croom is a sex maniac whose crazy fetish is reading. What a weirdo! \n"}, {"text": "What is Valentine studying?", "correct": "Grouse", "options": ["Picturesque Gardening", "Turtles", "Sod"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrouse.\n\n\tValentine is studying Chaos Theory via the game books' records of grouse. \n"}, {"text": "How does Thomasina die?", "correct": "A fire", "options": ["The duel", "Old age", "Mathematics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA fire.\n\n\tAlthough death by mathematics was a common killer in those days, Thomasina's young, virginal body is consumed by flames. Her mathematics catch on fire. Curse you, mathematics! You kill indiscriminately! \n"}]}
