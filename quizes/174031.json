{"id": "174031", "name": "Hardest 'M*A*S*H' - 'Margaret's Marriage' Trivia Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "In the operating room at the beginning of the episode we discover that Margaret has now been engaged to her fianc\u00e9 Donald Penobscott for how many months?  ", "correct": "Eight", "options": ["Four", "Five", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight.\n\n\tEight months seems like a rather short time for an engagement, but in reality this amount of time is rather long when you consider the amount of time she was engaged during the run of the show.  Margaret first announces her engagement in the second episode of the fifth season 'Margaret's Engagement', which first aired on 9/28/76.  In this episode, airing on 3/15/77 (the last one of the fifth season), she is already getting married.  In real time that's only six and a half months!  Did that much time elapse during the fifth season of M*A*S*H, or am I just being a little too nitpicky? \n"}, {"text": "Inspired by the conversation about herself and her fianc\u00e9, Margaret makes a call to Donald from Radar's office and convinces him to pay a visit to the M*A*S*H 4077th.  Is this the first physical appearance of Lt. Col. Penobscott on the show? ", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThough he has been mentioned repeatedly throughout the episodes of the fifth season, we don't get to actually see Donald until this episode.  His character is played by the actor Beeson Carroll (Sidenote: This is Carroll's only appearance as Donald; in the character's second appearance he is played by a different actor.) \n"}, {"text": "When Donald arrives at the 4077th, with what activity are most of the main characters engaged?  ", "correct": "A basketball game", "options": ["A poker game", "Emergency surgery", "Eating lunch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA basketball game.\n\n\tAnd, I might add, one of the single worst basketball games I have ever seen.  Klinger's dribbling is atrocious, and the rest of the actors appear never to have stepped on a basketball court in their life.  Radar serves as a very biased referee; he gives Colonel Potter all the breaks.  Mercifully, Donald arrives and breaks up the game when he introduces himself to the boys. \n"}, {"text": "Donald announces to the entire 4077th crew that he and Margaret have decided to get married, and get married quickly.  Which of the M*A*S*H dwellers does Donald choose to be his best man?  ", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["BJ", "Hawkeye", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tAfter making his announcement to the gang in the mess tent, Donald spots Frank approaching.  The latter immediately runs from the mess tent with the former on his heels.  Donald quickly accosts Frank, who is now petrified with fear.  Rather than the expected fight, however, Donald thanks Frank for inspiring Margaret's call to him, and in return for his feeling of indebtedness, he requests Frank be his best man.  Frank responds with a very amusing giggle fit. \n"}, {"text": "Klinger provides Margaret with a lovely white wedding dress and she wears it during her wedding with Donald. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDespite several years of cool relations between Margaret and Klinger, the Corporal comes through for Margaret in a big way with the gift of a lovely wedding dress.  Klinger claims that his Uncle Zack used the dress to get out of World War I.  Klinger also adds, 'In the words of my people: May your life be an oasis surrounded by waving palms, warm breezes and spit free camels.'  In the following scene a drunken Klinger toasts Donald with the following, 'May your house be filled with children, and your garage filled with camels.' \n"}, {"text": "After a wedding shower scene with Margaret and her nurses we are directed to the Swamp, where the doctors treat Donald to some of their fine still swill.  Frank, also drunk, becomes mildly hostile during the scene, and demands to know why Donald deserves a fine woman like Margaret.  How does Donald ensure that he is qualified to marry Margaret?  ", "correct": "He claims to have placed 396th out of a class of 227 at West Point", "options": ["He claims the ability to assemble and disassemble a howitzer in three minutes flat", "He claims to have run the 4-minute mile in 15 minutes", "He claims to have worked for three 3-star generals, making nine stars in all"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe claims to have placed 396th out of a class of 227 at West Point.\n\n\tDonald also claims to have been on the water polo team, to have participated in the hammer throw and to have specialized in 'Greco-wrestle Romaning'.  BJ wittily asks, 'All at the same time?' \n"}, {"text": "After the drunken revelry dies out in the Swamp we are left with BJ and Hawkeye cruelly planning a practical joke to pull on Donald, who has passed out.  Which of these is suggested before they come up with the devious plan of putting Donald in a full body cast?    ", "correct": "To slip him in bed with Nurse Carson", "options": ["To steal his tuxedo and replace it with a clown suit", "To paint his fingernails and toenails pink", "To give him an extremely large dose of laxatives"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo slip him in bed with Nurse Carson.\n\n\tBJ is a true practical joker, and he first proves his mettle as such with this brilliant idea.  Hawkeye and BJ place Donald in a body cast from the chest down, effectively rendering him immobile, and tell him that he broke his leg the night before.  BJ also suggests, prior to this ultimate plan, that they 'put wheels on him and enter him in the soapbox derby.' \n"}, {"text": "The wedding scene is cut short when Radar announces that choppers are on the way.  Father Mulcahy is forced to expedite the ceremony, but it is completed nonetheless, with Margaret and Donald exchanging vows, rings and a kiss.  ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, the speedy wedding scene ends with all the proper ceremonial gestures. Donald is then left alone in the mess tent in his full body cast, but is unable to keep his balance and falls to the ground. \n"}, {"text": "After the final operating scene, Margaret and Donald are off on their honeymoon.  Just before taking off in the helicopter Margaret tosses her bouquet into the crowd.  Who catches Margaret's toss?  ", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Kelly", "Radar", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tFrank is the lucky fellow...well, perhaps not so lucky.  He quickly tosses the bouquet towards the rest of the crowd and Kelly receives it.  Poor Frank looks distraught during the scene, and after a final hug from Margaret he watches her helicopter take off.  Alone on the landing pad, we hear Frank say 'Goodbye Margaret'. \n"}, {"text": "Sadly, this episode was Frank Burns' (and Larry Linville's) last hurrah.  In the final scene from the episode we see Frank chatting with Hawkeye, BJ and Colonel Potter.  What is the last word we hear Frank say?  ", "correct": "Shower", "options": ["Houlihan", "Goodbye", "Nerts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShower.\n\n\tAfter discussion amongst the doctors of Margaret's potential honeymoon plans poor Frank stands up and heads for the door of the Swamp.   When asked where he is going he says, 'I don't know.  I just thought I'd go and take a cold shower.'  By the first episode of the sixth season he has run off in search of Margaret, gets himself in trouble for assaulting a general and his wife in a Tokyo bath (he thought the woman was Margaret) and finally has the charges dropped with a promotion to lieutenant colonel.  He is then sent off to Indiana to work in a VA hospital.  Goodbye Ferret Face!  Thanks for taking this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other stuff. \n"}]}
