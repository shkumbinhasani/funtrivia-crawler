The assailant's name is on the hat: Fred Krueger.  After Nancy comments on her mother's drinking habits, she discovers that Fred Krueger is dead.  Her mother insists it's just a nightmare.\r On a walk, Glen tells Nancy about the Balinese way of dreaming.

Nancy quickly rushes to a freshly made pot of coffee under her bed and takes a drink.  Before she can leave her room, Nancy spies her mother taking a swig from a bottle of vodka in the linen closet.  She decides to give Glen a call but his mother picks up.  Handing the phone to Glen's dad, he hangs up and leaves it off the hook.  That's when Nancy receives a phone call -- it sounds like screeching metal.  When she pulls the phone out of the wall, it continues to ring.  She picks it up once again and it's none other than Freddy.  He claims that he's her boyfriend now.  When Nancy rushes downstairs, her mother, drunk on the couch, says that the entire house is locked up.\r Across the road, Glen falls asleep.  At midnight, he's pulled down into his bed.

Jumping off a balcony, she lands in a flower garden and rushes back to her house to grab Freddy before her alarm sounds. \n"}, {"text": "How does Nancy defeat Fred Krueger?", "correct": "She turns her back on him.", "options": ["She attacks him with his own glove.", "She sets him on fire.", "She douses him in water."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe turns her back on him.\n\n\tAwakening in her bed to the sound of the alarm, Nancy discovers that she has brought Fred with her into reality.

Nancy asks if she's alright and her mother says she's going to stop drinking -- she just doesn't want to anymore.  Glen, Tina, and Rod pull up in Glen's convertible and Nancy joins her friends.  Before the kids drive off, the top to the convertible closes on its own to reveal a red and green roof.  The doors and windows lock as they're forcibly driven away.  Nancy's mother stands at the door and watches as they leave before Freddy's arm breaks through the window and pulls her in. \n"}]}
