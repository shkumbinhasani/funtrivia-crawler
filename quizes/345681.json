There are wild populations in several parts of the world - but this critter is native to what continent?", "correct": "North America", "options": ["Asia", "Africa", "Europe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorth America.\n\n\tThe word \"raccoon\" is borrowed from the language of the Powhatan people of Virginia, where English speakers first encountered this beast. With its bandit's-mask face coloring and the remarkable dexterity of its front paws, the raccoon has earned a reputation as a trickster, both in ancient myths and in modern stories.In the twentieth century, these omnivores adapted well to urban life, and are particularly infamous for breaking into garbage cans and carrying rabies - but this didn't stop raccoon-lovers from releasing them into the wild in Japan and in several parts of Europe. The motives varied from the sentimental (the release of a pet) to the sartorial (raccoons have pretty fur). \n"}, {"text": "Let's try a Brain Teaser! What \"cc\" word solves the following rebus?\n\nMale deer + relatives + close at hand", "correct": "Buccaneer", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuccaneer.\n\n\tA male deer is a buck; family members are kin; and something close by is also near. Put the pieces together and you get \"buccaneer,\" another word for a pirate. It's best to keep them far away! \n"}, {"text": "Matthew McConaughey became a Celebrity in the 1990s on the strength of his rugged good looks and his star turns in several dramas. Even so, it took him a long while to find a leading lady in his own life. What woman, already the mother of his two children, did he marry in 2012?", "correct": "Camila Alves", "options": ["Grace Kelly", "Gisele B\u00fcndchen", "Kate Middleton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCamila Alves.\n\n\tAlves, a model from Brazil, first met McConaughey in 2007. By the time of their wedding, at their luxurious home in McConaughey's native Texas, the pair were proud parents to a three-year-old boy, Levi, and a two-year-old girl, Vida. Alves must not have followed the advice in \"How To Lose a Guy In 10 Days\" (2003), but a \"Wedding Planner\" (2001) turned out to be a good investment. \n"}, {"text": "The world of fashion and Entertainment would be very different without Gucci, a fashion house founded in 1921 and specializing in fine leather. In what Italian city did Gucci begin?", "correct": "Florence", "options": ["Milan", "Marseilles", "Monaco"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlorence.\n\n\tThe house's founder, Guccio Gucci, was a native of Florence, and he capitalized on his hometown's tradition of leatherwork. Over the generations, fashions and techniques have changed, but Gucci loafers are still a highly sought-after product -- even if they now share the name with watches, jewelry, and automobile interiors. \n"}, {"text": "In a hugely popular series of books For Children, a young wizard named Harry Potter learns and masters a wide variety of useful magic spells. When he cries \"Accio Broomstick!\", what is supposed to happen?", "correct": "His broomstick is summoned to his hand.", "options": ["His broomstick bursts into flames.", "His broomstick takes pride in a job well done.", "His broomstick springs to attention."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis broomstick is summoned to his hand.\n\n\tFor a natural flier like Harry, a broomstick-summoning spell provides the one tool necessary for solving a range of problems, from garden-variety boredom to stealing an egg from an angry dragon. Of course, in the eponymous seven-book series by J.K. Rowling, the Accio spell will summon just about anything a witch or wizard cares to name, as long as it is free to come. I could use that spell... \n"}, {"text": "Here at FunTrivia, fans of the General category are sometimes called upon to know something about the occult. For decades, a popular occult party game has consisted of a board with an indicator that can point to a letter or a number. Each player puts a hand on the indicator, which then seems to move of its own accord -- spelling out a message from the beyond. What's the name of this game?", "correct": "Ouija", "options": ["Parcheesi", "Spin the Bottle", "Mastermind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOuija.\n\n\tThe Ouija board was patented in 1891 (though not under that name) and marketed as a parlor game; it picked up its modern name in 1901 and its association with s\u00e9ances and the spirit world in the 1910s. Since then, its eerily sliding planchette indicator has fueled many a pop-culture plot point. Beloved by teens at sleepovers and condemned by some religious groups, the Ouija board is a smashing success. \n"}, {"text": "If you know your Geography, you probably know that Morocco is a nation in northwest Africa, just across the Strait of Gibraltar from Spain. Which of the following cities is NOT in Morocco?", "correct": "Tripoli", "options": ["Rabat", "Fez", "Casablanca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTripoli.\n\n\tTripoli is the capital of Libya, a different country in the Maghreb. Morocco, whose capital is Rabat, is a primarily Muslim country whose people grow up speaking Arabic and Berber. Many also speak French, the language of Morocco's primary colonizer; the nation gained its independence in 1956. Though it's a constitutional monarchy, the king's powers far exceed those granted in governments like the UK's or Japan's. Casablanca is Morocco's largest city; Fez, another major city, gave its name to a cylindrical, tasseled hat. \n"}, {"text": "Vaccination was one of the most important developments in History: over the centuries, this technology has saved countless millions from premature death. How did it pick up the name \"vaccination\"?", "correct": "The first vaccines were derived from a disease of cattle.", "options": ["Biologically, vaccines target bacterial vacuoles.", "Vaccines are manufactured under vacuum conditions.", "The first vaccine was invented by a man named Antonio Vacci."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe first vaccines were derived from a disease of cattle.\n\n\t\"Vacca,\" the Latin word for \"cow,\" gave this preventative treatment its name. Cowpox, a disease once common among cattle and among human dairyworkers, is a milder relative of the horrific smallpox -- close enough that cowpox sufferers later have immunity to smallpox. The first vaccine, developed by Dr. Edward Jenner in 1796, infected people with cowpox in order to confer this immunity. The word \"vaccine\" now describes a large variety of inoculations, acting against everything from toxins to viruses.\r Before Jenner's vaccine, doctors in parts of Asia reduced the smallpox death toll via a technique called variolation, in which scabs from sick patients were used to infect healthy ones. Usually this resulted in a weaker and more survivable form of the disease, but the death rate -- while a dramatic improvement over full-blown smallpox -- was still significant. \n"}, {"text": "Played by high rollers in casinos around the world, baccarat may be one of the more expensive Hobbies a person can pursue. Which of the following is necessary to play baccarat?", "correct": "Playing cards", "options": ["Spinning wheel", "Numbered tiles", "Dice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlaying cards.\n\n\tIn the most common form of baccarat, players bet on the outcome of a matchup between two hands of cards. An ace is worth one; cards two through nine are worth face value; and all other cards are worth zero. The value of a hand is the last digit of the sum of all the card values, so the highest possible score is a nine. Strict rules determine whether a player draws a new card or stands pat, though some variants allow players to choose. \n"}, {"text": "Fans of the Humanities might enjoy the musical \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\", which found Broadway success in its 1961 debut and in 1995 and 2011 revivals. In the show, a dry narration adds humor to the plot. Which of these best characterizes the narrator?", "correct": "A self-help book", "options": ["A Worldwide Widgets infomercial", "The beautiful secretary who can't type", "The protagonist as a child"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA self-help book.\n\n\tIn \"How to Succeed...\", written by Abe Burrows, Jack Weinstock, and Willie Gilbert with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser, a young window washer named J. Pierrepont Finch takes advice from the titular self-help book. A pre-recorded voice -- provided by beloved newsman Walter Cronkite in the 1995 revival -- shares the passages Finch reads with the audience. These earnest instructions both set up Finch's goals in the scenes that follow, and provide some charming comic relief. \r For example, at the beginning of the musical, Finch goes all out to follow the book's instructions to land a mailroom job. When he starts the next chapter, though, the book tells him, \"You MUST get out of the mailroom.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Rebecca,\" by Daphne du Maurier, is among those classic works of Literature with enduringly famous first lines. Which of these sentences opens the book?", "correct": "\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\"", "options": ["\"Marley was dead: to begin with.\"", "\"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.\"", "\"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\"\n\n\tFirst published in 1938, \"Rebecca\" made its author's reputation. The novel tells the story of a woman who marries a wealthy widower, thereby becoming Mrs. de Winter -- and unknowingly entering into a competition with Mr. de Winter's dead first wife, the eponymous Rebecca. Haunted by Rebecca's idealized memory and manipulated by Rebecca's devoted housekeeper, Mrs. de Winter comes perilously close to madness at the family estate of Manderley.\r Marley's death begins Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" Jem's sister Scout narrates Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and the bright cold April day is in George Orwell's \"1984\". \n"}, {"text": "\"Pinocchio\", one of Disney's classic animated Movies, tells the story of a marionette who dreams of becoming a real boy. It wouldn't be a Disney film, though, without some sort of animal sidekick. What kind of creature serves as Pinocchio's conscience?", "correct": "Cricket", "options": ["Termite", "Badger", "Sparrow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCricket.\n\n\tThat would be the famous Jiminy Cricket, voiced by Cliff Edwards. Unusually dapper for a cricket with his top hat, jacket and umbrella, Jiminy has his hands full narrating parts of the movie and trying to guide his charge onto the right path. In the 1883 Carlo Collodi novel that inspired this 1940 movie, Jiminy had no name and played a much smaller role, but the cricket is vital to the Disney version. \n"}, {"text": "Playing an instrument takes more than knowing the notes: there's also the timing, the expression, the art. In Music, there's a special vocabulary and notation just for this. If a pianist were to play a note staccato, what would she do?", "correct": "Strike the key quickly, without holding it", "options": ["Strike the key very softly", "Play the note one half-step down", "Hold the key down for half a measure"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrike the key quickly, without holding it.\n\n\tA staccato note is detached from the following one; there is a silence between notes instead of a smooth, legato flow from one note to the next. In modern written music, it's marked with a dot above or below the note in question. Like many musical terms, \"staccato\" comes from Italian, but it's an unusually good phonetic match for its meaning: the word itself seems staccato, interrupted and perhaps a little harsh. \n"}, {"text": "Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti: were they innocent radicals or criminal ones? The question has been hotly debated ever since the two People were executed in Massachusetts in 1927. To what political movement did Sacco and Vanzetti belong?", "correct": "Anarchism", "options": ["Communism", "Bull Moose", "Nativism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnarchism.\n\n\tWhen Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested in 1920 for a double murder during a payroll robbery, a violent anarchist movement had been active for decades. In Europe and the U.S., anarchists had planted bombs and assassinated government figures, even heads of state. These two Italian immigrants to the U.S. were committed anarchists and possibly involved in the murder, but their arrest, trial and sentencing were marred by political and ethnic prejudice.In particular, they were denied a retrial after another person confessed to the crime, an unfairness that resulted in major legal reform. It was too late for Sacco and Vanzetti, though: the controversy lasted decades, but they died in the electric chair. \n"}, {"text": "Wicca is an earth-based Religion that claims a kinship with the pagan faiths that ruled Europe long ago. The eight great Wiccan holy days mark the turning of the seasons, year in and year out; what word refers to these festivals?", "correct": "Sabbat", "options": ["Saturnalia", "Field Day", "Festivus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSabbat.\n\n\t\"Sabbat\" shares its etymological roots with \"Sabbath,\" a weekly observance in Judaism. In Wicca, the Sabbat cycle is set by ancient Celtic tradition. The Sabbat of Samhain marks the new year in late fall; it's followed by Yule at the winter solstice, Imbolc in late winter, Ostara at the spring equinox, the fertility Sabbat of Beltane in late spring, Midsummer, and the two harvest festivals of Lammas and Mabon. \n"}, {"text": "Many advances in Science and Technology hinge on the ability to see new things: things that are very small, things that are very rare, or things that are very far away. Biology is no exception. Which of the following disease agents was the first virus to be identified?", "correct": "Tobacco mosaic virus", "options": ["Streptococcus", "Hantavirus", "Staphylococcus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTobacco mosaic virus.\n\n\tAs the name implies, tobacco mosaic virus blights tobacco plants and their relatives, giving the leaves a characteristic mottled appearance. It's an appealing prospect for virological studies, partly because it has no effect on humans or other animals, reducing the necessary safety precautions. The virus was first identified as a non-bacterial agent in the 1890s by Dmitri Ivanovsky and Martinus Beijerinck; it was first crystallized, which allowed the detailed study of its structure with X-rays, by Wendell Stanley in 1935. (He later shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this feat.) The virus is still a popular subject of study among scientists. \n"}, {"text": "Every Sport has its enduring (and controversial) moments, and soccer (or football) is no exception. In a quarterfinal match of the 1986 World Cup, Diego Maradona scored a goal with help from what he called the \"hand of God.\" For what team was Maradona playing?", "correct": "Argentina", "options": ["Portugal", "USA", "Spain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArgentina.\n\n\tIn this match, Argentina faced England just four years after the Falklands War, so tensions were high. Maradona scored the first goal of the game, but broke the rules doing it: in soccer, goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands, but Maradona had used his hand to knock the ball into the goal.The referee didn't see the infraction, though, so the goal stood -- and Maradona facetiously referred to the \"hand of God\" during post-game interviews. His good mood was no doubt helped by the fact that he had scored the game-winning goal (more legally this time) a few minutes later.Argentina went on to win the World Cup. \n"}, {"text": "\"Hello, I'm actor Troy McClure.  You kids might remember me from such educational films as 'Lead Paint, Delicious But Deadly' and 'Here Comes the Metric System!'\" On which long-running Television show might you hear that introduction?", "correct": "The Simpsons", "options": ["The Honeymooners", "Seinfeld", "EastEnders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Simpsons.\n\n\tTroy McClure, voiced by the late Phil Hartman, was a recurring character in the first ten seasons of the animated comedy \"The Simpsons.\" An aging B- or C-list actor with an inflated sense of his own celebrity, he could be counted on to narrate whatever media the story required, from schoolroom-style educational videos to infomercials to automated welcome kiosks. He delivered his exposition with panache, always introducing himself with some variation on the patter in the question. \n"}, {"text": "In one enduringly popular Video Game franchise, characters in cars and on motorcycles race each other around a variety of courses, with the help of items they find along the way. A mushroom will give you a quick speed boost; a banana peel or a red turtle shell is useful for attacking a rival. And winning once isn't enough: each course is available in 50 cc, 100 cc, and 150 cc versions. What was the first game in this series?", "correct": "Super Mario Kart", "options": ["Grand Theft Auto", "Halo", "Forza"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Mario Kart.\n\n\tAs a Nintendo franchise, \"Super Mario Kart\" has access to all the characters of the Mario Brothers games, from the eponymous siblings to the Princess to their archenemy, Bowser. They tear around tracks inspired by Mario's other adventures, from haunted houses to lava-infused castles. The original game was released on the Super Nintendo platform in 1992; its sequels have kept the basic game play while adding new courses and items.\r The 50 cc, 100 cc, and 150 cc races are named according to the engine displacement (in cubic centimeters) of the available vehicles. As in real life, a larger displacement means more power, but whether that's a good thing depends on the driver's skill level! \n"}, {"text": "Many World languages use accents and diacritical marks to add phonetic flexibility to their alphabets. One such symbol is the acute accent, which appears above the letter it marks. What does the acute accent look like?", "correct": "A diagonal line drawn from lower left to upper right", "options": ["Two dots side-by-side", "A diagonal line drawn from upper left to lower right", "An upside-down V"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA diagonal line drawn from lower left to upper right.\n\n\tIn Spanish, the acute accent is placed over a vowel that's supposed to be stressed despite the normal rules. For example, without an accent, \"Jose\" would be pronounced \"HOE-say\"; with an accent, the name \"Jos\u00e9\" is pronounced \"hoe-SAY.\" In French, an acute accent changes the pronunciation of the letter E. \"Ne\" (not), without an accent, rhymes with \"le\": the E is pronounced like the I in \"bird.\" Meanwhile, \"n\u00e9\" (born), with an accent, sounds like \"nay.\"\r A diagonal line from upper left to lower right (as in the French \"l\u00e0\", meaning \"there\") is a grave accent. Two dots, side-by-side above a letter (as in the German \"f\u00fcr,\" meaning \"for\") make an umlaut. An upside down V (as in the French \"h\u00f4tel\") is a circumflex. \n"}]}
