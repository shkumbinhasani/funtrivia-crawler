Well, many people, including myself, think flamingoes are quite bright, and a little too pink.  But did you know; flamingoes actually start out gray?  The pink color comes from the krill they eat.  As they always say...  You are what you eat, right?\r Thanks for playing!  Hopefully you have broadened your understanding of animals group names! \n"}]}
