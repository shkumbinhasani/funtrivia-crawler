The name of the ship wasn't mentioned in the film.\r The Finalizer was mentioned by name early in the first chapter. The ship was described as being better than anything the Empire had ever had, and as likely better than anything the New Republic might have had. \n"}, {"text": "The book opens with which Resistance leader thinking about her missing brother, and deciding to send her best pilot on a covert mission?", "correct": "Leia Organa", "options": ["Sen. Amidala", "Mon Mothma", "Mara Jade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeia Organa.\n\n\tOf the four options, only Leia is in the novel. The scene in the book was not in the movie at all, but serves as a prelude to the opening scene of the film.\r In the scene Leia ponders where Luke has gone off to, and decides to send Poe Dameron to Jakku to talk with a trusted friend who has helpful information on her brother.\r At that point Poe was unknown to the readers, having never popped up in the \"Star Wars\" novels before. \n"}, {"text": "What item did Rey agree to sell to Unkar Plutt for 100 portions, before she changed her mind?", "correct": "BB-8.", "options": ["A stormtrooper's plasma rifle.", "A broken lightsaber.", "An Ion engine from a TIE Fighter."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBB-8.\n\n\tUnkar Plutt was the trader who ran the outpost at Niima on Jakku. Rey was a scavenger who made her living by trading in pieces of crashed ships and other things that she found.\r When she stumbled upon BB-8 she was on her way to trade with Plutt.

While running from the First Order troops Finn and Rey go toward a ship they intend to fly off in.\r It is only after that ship is disabled permanently that they instead turn to the \"pile of junk\" on the other end of the scrap yard.\r That ship turned out to be the Millennium Falcon, which was in working order. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Leia's personal envoy to the Galactic Senate?", "correct": "Korr Sella", "options": ["Ben Solo", "Link Corra", "IG-107"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKorr Sella.\n\n\tKorr Sella spoke to the Galactic Senate on behalf of Leia, who instead was working as a general with the Resistance. While Sella wasn't shown in the film, a key scene in the book was with Leia sending Sella to Hosnian Prime to speak with the Senate prior to the attack on the planet.\r This scene explained to the reader that the New Republic and the Resistance were in fact two separate entities. \n"}, {"text": "During the fight at Maz Kanatta's bar, who did Chewbacca tear an arm off of?", "correct": "Unkar Plutt", "options": ["Kylo Ren", "Korr Sella", "Ben Skywalker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnkar Plutt.\n\n\tPlutt and some of his cronies joined the fight while attempting to kidnap Rey and BB-8.

Instead during what would have been a touching moment, Kylo turned on his lightsaber and impaled his father.\r The scene played out in the book just as emotionally as it did on the screen. \n"}, {"text": "What planet was the Resistance base located on?", "correct": "D'Qar", "options": ["Hosnian Prime", "Ahch-To", "Jakku"], "explanation": "\n\n\nD'Qar.\n\n\tAll four planets had key roles to play in the story. \r Jakku was the homeworld of Rey, and where she met up with Finn and BB-8.

IG-88 was not in the story at all. \n"}, {"text": "Did the Resistance manage to find the missing Jedi Master at the end of the book?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tRey was able to follow the map that Poe Dameron had been sent to Jakku to recover and find Luke Skywalker.\r Rey, Chewbacca and R2D2 where the trio sent to track him down.\r Much like in the movie, the book ends with the discovery of Skywalker, offering little explanation of why he was there, or why he was hiding.\r He was on the planet Ahch-To, home of an ancient Jedi Temple. \n"}]}
