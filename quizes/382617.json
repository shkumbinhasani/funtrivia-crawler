{"id": "382617", "name": "\"The Vanishing of Will Byers\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stranger Things"], "questions": [{"text": "Mike, Will, Lucas, and Dustin all play what game together?", "correct": "Dungeons and Dragons", "options": ["Football", "Super Mario Bros.", "Pokemon Go"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDungeons and Dragons.\n\n\tSomething breaks out of a contained area beneath the National Laboratory outside Hawkins, Indiana and, after running through the dark, labyrinthine corridors a scientist is killed while waiting to take the elevator.  Whatever was locked away down there has gotten out.\rIn the nearby town, four boys-- Mike, Will, Lucas, and Dustin-- play their tenth hour of their \"Dungeons and Dragons\" campaign, finally being forced to go home when Mike's mom realizes it's a school night.  It's a shame, really; the boys are just in the beginning of a major battle. \n"}, {"text": "When Will is pursued through the forest, he leaves which of these behind?", "correct": "Bicycle", "options": ["Flashlight", "Shoe", "Backpack"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBicycle.\n\n\tWill and Dustin start to race each other home in a bid to win one another's comics and, with a head-start, Will quickly takes the lead, rushing down the road and through the restricted fencing to make it there first.  Heading down the road, though, his bicycle lamp goes out and he almost collides with a stalking creature in the way.  He rides off into the forest and, in fear, leaves his bike behind to run home.  No one's there though.\rAfter trying to phone 911 (and failing, since electrical feedback ruins the call), Will runs into the shed out back and tries to load a shotgun, which he does.  Unfortunately, whatever was chasing him through the dark has already found him.  The lightbulb in the shed glows too bright and, when it returns to normal, no one...and nothing...remains. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Nancy's boyfriend?", "correct": "Steve", "options": ["Jonathan", "Martin", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve.\n\n\tBoth Will's mother, Joyce, and his brother, Jonathan, can't seem to find Will in the morning and, after phoning Mike's parents believing he may have stayed over, they have to determine that he must've gone to school early.  Unfortunately, he never showed.\rThe other boys can't seem to find him either and, after getting their typical gibes from the school bullies, they head onward to class.  They don't find it too odd that Will is missing.\rMike's sister, Nancy, ends up meeting up with her boyfriend, Steve, in the school bathroom and makes plans to study with him that evening. \n"}, {"text": "Hopper assures Joyce that 99% of the time, missing kids wind up where?", "correct": "With other family members", "options": ["At an arcade", "Alive", "Back at home"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith other family members.\n\n\tJoyce, extremely worried, heads to the sheriff's office to file a missing persons report with Hopper who, while professional, is confident that Will is fine since nothing ever really happens in Hawkins, Indiana.  As he says, the worst thing to happen involved a woman getting attacked by an owl because her hair looked like a nest.  Joyce is anxious though; Will isn't the type to run away or do anything out of the ordinary because he's quite sensitive.  They toy with the idea that, perhaps, his father might be involved; Joyce plans to look into it. \n"}, {"text": "A girl escapes the halls beneath the National Laboratory building.  Where does she end up?", "correct": "A diner", "options": ["A house", "A library", "The Sheriff's office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA diner.\n\n\tA group of scientists suit up and prepare themselves to enter the quarantined labs beneath the building outside of Hawkins.  There, they find odd, living material growing on the walls and, in one room, a large web of matter is spread along the entire side of the chamber.  They say that the girl in their care couldn't have gone too far.\rThe girl they speak of makes it to a diner on the edge of town, having wandered through the woods.  Heading inside, she's only found when she starts eating the food in the kitchen, but the chef can't bring himself to punish her. \n"}, {"text": "The boys' science teacher, Mr. Clark, orders which of these for the boys?", "correct": "A ham radio", "options": ["Books", "New equipment", "Sea monkeys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA ham radio.\n\n\tAfter class, Lucas, Dustin, and Mike ask their science teacher, Mr. Clark, if what they've been waiting for has come in.  Sure enough, Mr. Clark has already set up their little A/V Club's ham radio and they're able to use it whenever they wish.  The celebration is short-lived though; Chief Hopper comes by the school to speak to the boys in the principal's office where, while they're eager to help look for their missing friend, they're stopped at the gate. It's too unsafe, considering, for the boys to head out.  Hopper makes it clear that they aren't allowed to leave home in the evenings unless something happens. \n"}, {"text": "The mysterious girl from the labs has what number on her wrist?", "correct": "011 & 11 & Eleven", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n011 & 11 & Eleven.\n\n\tIn a memory, Joyce heads out to Castle Byers-- Will's forest fort, with tickets to see \"Poltergeist\" in the theater.  It is only a memory though.  When she and Jonathan search the woods they don't find any sign of Will, even in the fort.\rElsewhere, chef Benny Hammond cooks the mysterious girl a burger and gives her some warm clothes before sitting her down to talk.  Unfortunately, she won't speak too much, and when questioned about the tattoo on her wrist saying 011, she responds cryptically.  Benny calls an emergency hotline for children and a social worker is dispatched.  While this happens, he doesn't notice the girl turn off an electric fan with her mind. \n"}, {"text": "What does Hopper find in the Byers' shed?", "correct": "Ammunition", "options": ["A person", "Clothing", "Blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmmunition.\n\n\tHopper and his men find Will's bike just off the road in the forest and it leads them back to the Byers' house.  They arrive shortly after Joyce tries calling her ex-husband to locate Will (though what she doesn't know is that the government is listening in on calls).  The cops arrive with the bike in hand and Hopper hypothesizes that Will came home before going missing.  A notch in the wall where the door slammed into it gives him a clue, but he also finds the shed out back when the family dog starts barking at it.  Inside he finds the ammo, but little else.  He recommends that they start forming search parties.\rThat night, while searching, Mr. Clark asks Hopper about his own daughter, but isn't aware that she died years ago (though Hopper claims she moved to the city with her mother). \n"}, {"text": "Nancy is not allowed to leave the house for her 'study session'.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe boys want to go out and find Will, but their families say no.  During dinner, Mike angrily lets it slip that Nancy, who wants to head out to 'study' at a friend's house, is seeing Steve.\rThat night, the boys use their walkie-talkies to communicate with each other and set out on their bikes to search for their missing friend (he fought to protect them in \"Dungeons and Dragons\", so it's only fair they protect him).  On the way out, Mike watches as Steve lets himself in through the bedroom window; both have no choice but to let one another go on with their evenings as neither can be caught. \n"}, {"text": "Who answers the phone call from Will?", "correct": "Joyce", "options": ["Jonathan", "Mike", "Hopper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoyce.\n\n\tBenny continues to feed the mysterious girl-- this time, it's ice cream-- but a social services agent arrives at the door.  Unfortunately, she's not who she says she is.  She shoots Benny in the head and, in doing so, allows the girl to slip out the back, killing two armed government agents-- somehow-- on her way.  The agents, now surrounding the diner, have no choice but to resume hunting.\rAt the Byers', Joyce and Jonathan try to console each other when they receive a mysterious phone call that Joyce senses is Will.  When she starts screaming at the receiver, it zaps her with a jolt of electricity before going dead.\rThe boys, reaching the spot where Will's bike was found, head into the woods as a storm picks up.  Heading in with flashlights, they consider leaving before the mysterious girl emerges from the bushes. \n"}]}
