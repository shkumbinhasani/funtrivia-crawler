Unfortunately, you ain't it.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"My record of achievement thus far has been exemplary.\"\n\n\tTom Highway is an old-fashioned, no-nonsense drill instructor who has returned to a Marine fighting unit. He is determined to instill discipline into his men without praising himself. Major Powers, on the other hand, is a \"new generation\" Marine who pompously believes that his own conduct has been \"exemplary\". Powers feels proud of himself because he has graduated from the Naval Academy. Throughout the movie, Highway's favorite expression is \"Adapt, improvise, overcome\". The soldiers in Recon learn to heed those words. \n"}, {"text": "Which character says, \"Heartbreak Ridge?

Webster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor Powers.\n\n\tMajor Powers (Everett McGill) believes that he has built an elite fighting unit with his First Platoon. He uses the men in Recon Platoon as mere pawns to be conquered. Highway, however, has other ideas. In order to teach Powers a lesson in tactics, Highway positions Recon in a hidden location; as a result, most of Powers' troops are \"killed\" in a mock combat drill.Powers is so furious that he threatens to kick Highway out of the Corps.

Swede expects Highway to send him to the brig, but Highway tells him to join the other members of the platoon. Highway says, \"You're going to become a Marine. Fall out.\" Highway thus begins to gain the platoon members' respect because he is not a snitch. Aponte, Jones and Fragetti are members of Recon. \n"}, {"text": "Which woman tells GySgt.
