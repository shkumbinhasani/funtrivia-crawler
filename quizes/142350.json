{"id": "142350", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Alcoholics Unanimous' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "As the episode begins, we see Hawkeye, Trapper and the rest of the gang huddled together under a rain-soaked mess tent, attempting to watch a good old fashioned Hollywood musical.  Which popular songstress of the 1930s and 40s is featured in the film they watch?", "correct": "Alice Faye", "options": ["Carole Landis", "June Allyson", "Ruth Lee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlice Faye.\n\n\tFully decked out in their rain gear, the M*A*S*H-ites enjoy a film called 'Tin Pan Alley' (1940) while avoiding various leaks in the mess tent.  Alice Faye (who is referenced by Hawkeye later in the episode) performs a wonderful song called 'America, I Love You', which can be enjoyed only for a short time because the projector loses its sound.  It later loses its life, as a big gash in the mess tent sends water pouring onto the projector (interesting note...the projector shorts out *before* the water hits it...oops!) \n"}, {"text": "Unfortunately for Trapper and Hawkeye, Henry Blake is off giving a lecture in Seoul, leaving the chinless Frank Burns in command.  On what illustrious topic is Henry eloquently propounding, according to Hawkeye?", "correct": "Hemorrhoids", "options": ["Halitosis", "Hyper-hydrosis", "Athlete's foot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHemorrhoids.\n\n\tTrapper whines that he'd rather be hearing Henry's lecture in Seoul, to which Hawkeye responds, 'Colonel Blake reviews the military position on the hemorrhoid?'  Off to the Swamp... \n"}, {"text": "The scene shifts to the Swamp, where we find Radar dismantling the still on Frank's orders.  Radar is really unhappy about having to deconstruct the still, and quotes Hawkeye, who claims the contraption is his...?", "correct": "Wellspring of life", "options": ["Fountain of youth", "Umbilical cord", "Life's blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWellspring of life.\n\n\tAccording to Radar, 'Captain Pierce says it (the still) is his 'wellspring of life'.'!  Frank responds, 'Oh that's just something he read in 'Cosmopolitan'.'  (Whatever that means!)  Trapper and Hawkeye enter the Swamp just in time to save their wellspring.  They sample the still's product, to be sure its quality has not been compromised.  Hawkeye calls the gin 'mother's milk', while Trapper refers to it as 'nectar of the gods'. \n"}, {"text": "Observing the passion with which his two Swamp-mates reassemble the still (and sample its product), Frank accuses them of being alcoholics.  He then produces an alcoholism test from the 'deputy assistant undersecretary of defense' which contains three questions.  Which of the following is not one of the questions therein?", "correct": "Do you fantasize about drinking when you are unable to drink?", "options": ["Do you sometimes forget what happens while you are drinking?", "Do you think and talk about drinking often?", "Do you sometimes gulp drinks?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDo you fantasize about drinking when you are unable to drink?.\n\n\tFirst question: 'Do you think and talk about drinking often?'\r  Prior to this question, Hawkeye and Trapper discuss the vermouth/gin content of their martinis.  Their response to the question is a definite 'no', followed by more discussion of the gin content.\r  Second question: 'Do you sometimes gulp drinks?'\r  They respond by gulping their drinks, after which Trapper says, 'Ah, never!'\r  Third question: 'Do you sometimes forget what happens while you are drinking?'\r  Hawkeye responds, 'What?'  Frank reiterates the question, and Trapper responds 'What happened to question number two?'  'He forgot it!  He forgets while we drink.', Hawkeye answers. \n"}, {"text": "After Trapper and Hawkeye flunk their test on alcoholism, Frank decides that alcohol should be prohibited in the camp.  Just prior to this, he hears excuses from his roommates regarding their drinking.  Which of the following isn't a set of reasons behind their excessive boozing?", "correct": "We're angry, aching, terrified", "options": ["We're cold, filthy, lonely", "We're scared, bored, tired", "We're frightened and very drowsy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe're angry, aching, terrified.\n\n\tLater, when Frank discovers that Margaret also drinks, she claims to be 'cold and frightened' too.  Nevertheless, Frank shuts down the officer's club, and the rest of the alcohol sources in the camp.  After doing so, he confides in Radar, asking, 'The men detest me, don't they?'  'Oh, no sir,' Radar responds.  'No, you can tell me the truth, they hate me don't they?' Frank asks.  'Just your guts, sir,' Radar finally admits. \n"}, {"text": "With the still shut down and the rest of the camp dry, Hawkeye and Trapper become desperate.  They even resort to attending one of Father Mulcahy's somniferous Sunday services in order to get a sip of the sacramental spirits.  Which hymn do the two captains sing with Mulcahy during the service?", "correct": "All Things Bright and Beautiful", "options": ["Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee", "Let All Things Now Living", "Faith of Our Fathers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll Things Bright and Beautiful.\n\n\tPrior to the entrance of Trapper and Hawkeye, we see Father Mulcahy delivering his service with only Klinger in attendance.  When the Father inquires into Klinger's religiosity, Klinger answers that he's 'really an atheist' but that attending service 'gives me a chance to wear my white gloves.'  The hymn that they sing, 'All Things Bright and Beautiful', written by C. F. Alexander, is also the title of a book by James Herriot. In fact, Harriot entitled four books after the first four lines of this hymn ('All Things Bright and Beautiful', 'All Creatures Great and Small', 'All Things Wise and Wonderful', 'The Lord God Made Them All'.) \n"}, {"text": "While Trapper and Hawkeye seek solace with Father Mulcahy, Frank finds comfort with his one true ally, Margaret.  While Frank discusses the difficulties of leadership, Margaret requests that he help her by fitting which item of clothing?", "correct": "Bra", "options": ["Stockings", "Negligee", "High-heel shoes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBra.\n\n\tThe scene becomes even more ridiculous when Radar interrupts while Frank continues to wear the bra, oblivious to the absurdity of his appearance.  'I didn't see anything unusual, sir,' is all that Radar can muster. \n"}, {"text": "While Frank lauds his efforts at putting a damper on drinking at the 4077th, Margaret announces that she too drinks on occasion, producing a small container in which she carries brandy.  What does she call this little container?", "correct": "Nippy bottle", "options": ["Dippy cask", "Tipsy flask", "Sippy vial"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNippy bottle.\n\n\tThe inscription on Margaret's brandy container, a gift from her father, reads: 'To my buttercup, from Alvin.  The best things are worth waiting for.'  When Frank expresses his displeasure at Margaret and her secret drinking, she responds, 'Don't take away my little 'nippy' bottle, it's only got a drop or two in it.'  Frank relents, euphemistically calling Margaret's brandy 'nerve medicine'. \n"}, {"text": "With all other possibilities exhausted, Hawkeye and Trapper open up the chemical storage cabinet in the supply tent hoping to find some medicinal alcohol.  They are interrupted when Margaret also enters the tent, seeking her secret supply of Brandy.  They accost Margaret and together the three of them have a drinking party, replete with singing.  What is the last line of the song they sing that begins, 'Come on in, slip off your skin and ___________'? ", "correct": "Rattle around in your bones", "options": ["Do the skeleton dance", "Let your frame do the same", "Shake your bony figure"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRattle around in your bones.\n\n\tHawkeye also sings the following line, 'I wish there were a radio way up in heaven, so I could say hello to mother every day.'  Frank discovers the drunken revel just in time to hear them chant the 'bones' song.  He proceeds to ask from whence the brandy came.  Hawkeye and Trapper provide Frank with a phony recipe involving string beans, an onion, a radish and four bananas, and an 'emena' bag.  Frank is so livid, he decides to rescind his allowance of Margaret's drinking...and afterward storms out.  Margaret then asks, 'Who was that?' (Big laughs!) \n"}, {"text": "For the final scene of the episode, we return to the mess tent, where Father Mulcahy is all set to give a lecture on temperance.  Unbeknownst to the rest of the outfit, Mulcahy is so nervous about delivering his lecture that he decided to have a drink beforehand.  In his drunken stupor, he recites, several times, a verse from which book of the 'Old Testament'?", "correct": "Leviticus", "options": ["Numbers", "Isaiah", "Psalms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeviticus.\n\n\t'Leviticus 10, Verse 9', to be more precise.  The exact quote: 'Do not drink wine, or strong drink thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die; it shall be a statute forever throughout the generations.'  Mulcahy requests that Radar open one of the stained-glass windows in the mess tent before repeating the same verse twice more. Madcap hilarity ensues when Frank is hit in the stomach and takes a few gulps from Margaret's nippy bottle, thereby 'repealing the 18th Amendment' (according to Hawkeye.) However, Frank has gotten his point across about temperance and all of the 4077th denizens feel better for it.  I hope you enjoyed this quiz, thank you for playing.
