Things do not go his way, however, when he becomes addicted and runs out of drugs.

Bradley Cooper stars as Edward Morra, a man who takes a new drug, called NZT-48, as an experiment.  When he runs out of the pills, however, the side effects he experiences could be deadly, especially if you go off the pill cold turkey.  I will not tell you how he managed to solve this problem, as that would be a spoiler, and spoilers are never any fun. \n"}, {"text": "Jake Gyllenhaal starred in a 2011 film about a man who relives a train explosion over and over again.  What is the film?", "correct": "Source Code", "options": ["In Time", "Unknown", "Unstoppable"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSource Code.\n\n\t\"Source Code\" was directed by Duncan Jones, and was released in April of 2011.

His mission; find who caused the train to explode, and locate the next target of the bomber.  Did he succeed?  Well, that would be a spoiler now, wouldn't it? \n"}, {"text": "\"Rio\" was a movie about a macaw named Blu.  In the movie, Blu met a 'suave' cardinal who gave him dating advice.  Which of these rappers voiced Pedro, the cardinal?", "correct": "Will.i.am", "options": ["Snoop Dogg", "Eminem", "Ice Cube"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill.i.am\n\n\t\"Rio\" was released in April of 2011, and was directed by Carlos Saldhana.  In the film, Blu, a Spix's macaw, is an orphaned bird who cannot fly, and lives in a bookstore with his owner.  However, he finds his way to Brazil, where he meets a female of his own kind (the humans originally brought him to Rio de Janeiro specifically to mate, as he was the only remaining macaw of the species), and he goes on quite the adventure.  But, I dislike spoilers, so will not tell you about that adventure. \n"}, {"text": "In 2011, the fourth film of the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise was released.

This fourth film in the \"Pirates\" series saw Johnny Depp again portraying his role of Jack Sparrow, and his new adventure with Angelica, played by Penelope Cruz.  I won't tell you why Orlando Bloom was not in this film; that would spoil the entire third movie, as well as the fourth.  And I hate spoilers. \n"}, {"text": "Johnny Depp did a wonderful job as a lizard who finds a small western town that is running low on money.
