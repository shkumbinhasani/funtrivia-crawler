Figgins states that kids are showing up wasted (on booze, not learning) and they're getting suspended for it.  He also blames alcohol aimed at teens and pop music, especially music by pop artist 'ke-dollar-sign-ha' (though Will corrects him- it's 'Ke$ha').  Will says that he'll do whatever he can to help and Figgins states that he's announcing Alcohol Awareness Week at McKinley High to combat teen alcohol consumption and that he's invited Kitty Dukakis to speak at an assembly later in the week where the Glee Club will perform an anti-drinking song. Will has no choice but to agree. \n"}, {"text": "How did Sue get the job coaching Aural Intensity?", "correct": "She pushed their previous director down some stairs.", "options": ["She brought them onto her Cheerios squad to gain full control.", "She blackmailed the previous director with his infidelity.", "She submitted a resume and cover letter."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe pushed their previous director down some stairs.\n\n\tIn the staff room, Will breaks the ice with Emma and suggests that they go back to being friends.  To show his enthusiasm for her marriage with Carl, he gives her a housewarming gift, a two-slice toaster.  When they begin to catch up, she asks if he's been dating anyone and Sue interrupts saying that he'll probably turn to alcoholism when he can't find a partner and his Glee Club loses to hers at Regionals.  When Emma asks how she got into Glee Club coaching, Sue states that Will inspired her and she went to Westvale to speak to the coach of Aural Intensity.  When he fell (or was pushed by Sue, rather) down two flights of stairs, she took the job.\rIn the choir room, Puck runs into Rachel practicing the piano and writing her original song and he lets it slip that he knows her dads are out of town.  He suggests a party on Saturday with just the Glee kids so that they can relax before Regionals.  She feels that this would betray her parents' trust and firmly says no. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Rachel's very first original song?", "correct": "My Headband", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Headband.\n\n\tWhen Puck leaves the choir room, Finn comes in to find Rachel continuing her songwriting.  She states it's going well and asks him to listen to her first original piece which turns out to be a song about her headband called \"My Headband\".  Finn says it's 'interesting' but lacks emotion and Rachel agrees stating that great songwriters had emotion derived from experience.  Finn suggests that maybe she needs to live a little and she agrees entirely.  She decides that it's time to have a party at her house.\rSantana, Brittany, Artie, and Mercedes discuss the 'Rachel Berry House-Party-Train-Wreck-Extravaganza' and all decide to go if there's liquor, even despite Alcohol Awareness Week (which isn't an excuse, Santana argues, because she is aware of how great alcohol is). \n"}, {"text": "When Rachel has her party, her initial plan is to give out which of these drinks?", "correct": "Wine coolers", "options": ["Bellinis", "Ouzo", "Sparkling wine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWine coolers.\n\n\tWhen everyone arrives at Rachel's house they head to her dads' Oscar room in the basement.  Kurt and Blaine show up (and Blaine states that he's not a Warbler for the evening) and notice a stage across the room.  Rachel tries to chat with Quinn who is busy avoiding Santana and Sam's make-out session across the room and Rachel begins to hand out drink tickets.  Realizing that the party is a dud, some of the New Directions members try to make their exit and Rachel worries that she'll never get her 'life experience'.  She decides to let Puck break open her dads' liquor cabinet.\rWith shots going around, everyone has a great time and Rachel finds herself getting drunk on wine coolers.  Finn doesn't drink because he's the designated driver and he watches the chaos commencing around him. \n"}, {"text": "According to Finn, which of these New Directions members is a weepy, hysterical drunk?", "correct": "Santana", "options": ["Quinn", "Tina", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantana.\n\n\tAt one point, Rachel approaches Finn and says that she would do anything for him.  Since this is her first time drunk, he decides that it's wise to break down the truth about drinking for her.  Girls fall into specific archetypes, he says, when they drink.  Santana is weepy and hysterical, Lauren and Quinn are angry girl drunks, Brittany is a stripper drunk, Mercedes and Tina are happy drunks, and Rachel is a needy girl drunk.  He says what she's doing isn't cool, so she decides it's time for Spin the Bottle.\rThe Spin the Bottle game goes well and everyone enjoys themselves.  Sam kisses Brittany much to Santana and Quinn's disappointment and Rachel spins the bottle onto Blaine.  Much to everyone's surprise (especially Kurt's), the kiss goes on just a bit too long.  They decide to duet on the Oscar room's stage.  The song?  \"Don't You Want Me\" by The Human League.\rThe next morning, Burt goes up to Kurt's room to find Blaine in his bed, hungover. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these people serves Bloody Marys at the school to cure the Glee Club's hangovers?", "correct": "Artie", "options": ["Finn", "Sam", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArtie.\n\n\tAt school, everyone is hungover despite the fact that it's Monday and the party was on Saturday night.  To cure their nausea, Artie opens up a thermos of Bloody Marys and passes it around.  They all decide to partake in this hair of the dog solution before starting to sing Jamie Foxx and T-Pain's \"Blame It\".  This performance continues to the auditorium stage where Will enjoys their number. At the end, he's proud of them not only for their singing and dancing, but their acting.  He genuinely believed that some of them were drunk.  They don't say the truth in this matter.  The problem is that the song glorifies alcohol. The kids argue that most songs don't advocate against drinking.  At this point, Rachel starts hanging off of Mike and Santana starts to cry.  Quinn calls Will a hypocrite since most adults drink.  Will tells them to brainstorm for a proper song to use over the next day. \n"}, {"text": "Blaine asks Rachel out on a date.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn the staff lounge, Will speaks to Coach Beiste about whether or not he's out of touch with the kids in regards to drinking.  She says he's taking it way too hard, especially since he's been fine drinking in the past; she suggests that he tag along on her regular trip to Rosalita's Roadhouse, a local honky-tonk bar, where he can live a little.\rRachel, while sipping a wine called Lady Sparkle, calls Blaine while he's at the coffee shop with Kurt and asks him out on a date.  Kurt laughs it off but Blaine accepts the offer.  Kurt tells him not to lead her on, but Blaine says he's not really sure what he wants and that he's going to go out with her to figure out the truth about himself.\rAt ten at night, Kurt heads to Rachel's house to 'help clean up' even though it's clear his intent is to find out whether or not their date went well.  She says that they went to the revival theater and had a good time and that even though he has feelings for Blaine, he needs to back off a bit to let him figure out the truth about himself.  He continues to argue but she says that next time she sees Blaine, she'll take the beer goggles off and kiss him, and if there's still a spark she'll serve Kurt a slice of humble pie. \n"}, {"text": "After his night out with Coach Beiste, Will accidentally leaves a message on whose cell phone?", "correct": "Sue's", "options": ["Figgins'", "Emma's", "Terri's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSue's.\n\n\tWill heads out with Coach Beiste for a night of fun at the roadhouse and finds that he's enjoying himself.  After a ride on a mechanical bull and several drinks he hops onstage with Beiste and sings a duet of George Thorogood's \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\".\rBeiste and Will get back to Will's apartment and she drops him off to make sure he's safe.  They both agree that drinking can be fun and there's nothing wrong with that.  Although it's fun, they're not teens anymore; the best they can do is hope the kids are smart enough to make a choice, and they can help by teaching them the dangers.\rWhen Beiste departs, Will continues to drink beer and stay up to grade papers (marking them all as A+).  At one point he picks up his phone to call Emma and he leaves a message talking about how sexy she is.\rWill heads to school the next morning and discovers that (surprise!) he's horribly hungover and (surprise!) Emma never received a message from him.  He's relieved that he doesn't need to explain himself. \n"}, {"text": "How many New Directions members throw up during their performance of \"Tik Tok\"?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Four", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tAt home, Burt talks to Kurt about Blaine's sleeping over and his discomfort with their sharing a bed, especially after a night of drinking.  Kurt maintains that he and Finn didn't drink, but that doesn't seem to be the problem.  Burt asks Kurt to apologize and ask before he has any potentially inappropriate sleepovers in the future (and he does apologize) and Kurt asks his dad to possibly learn a bit more so that if he ever had questions to ask he could go to his father like any regular teenage boy could.\rAt McKinley High, the students gather in the gym for the Alcohol Awareness Assembly and Principal Figgins states that Kitty Dukakis would not attend due to disinterest, but a police officer would show them grisly auto accidents in a slideshow.  Backstage, New Directions prepares for their number, Ke$ha's \"Tik Tok\", and they're nervous as they haven't practiced it nearly enough.  Rachel presents everyone with a drink to calm their nerves; it's a mix of everything left over in her dads' liquor cabinet (and some cough syrup).  When they hit the stage, the crowd gets into the song but it's clear that Brittany isn't feeling well doing the most intense dance moves of anyone else and singing lead.  She pulls her mic away to tell Rachel she doesn't feel good.  Somewhere into the second chorus, she vomits on Rachel (who runs offstage) and the music comes to a stop.  Santana also throws up everywhere, much to everyone's shock, prompting Brittany to tell everyone: \"drink responsibly.\" \n"}, {"text": "In the end of the episode, Blaine comes to the conclusion that he is gay.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe day after the assembly, Sue (with Becky in tow) takes over the school's PA system to play the message Will left on her phone.  She blames Will, who she names an 'alcoholic teen vomit fetishist', before unveiling his message to everyone.\rWill and the Glee Club are asked to come to Principal Figgins' office soon after and Will says that they'll all probably be suspended for their drinking.  They say that he's one to talk having humiliated himself under the influence of alcohol.  Figgins, to their surprise, congratulates them on their special effects and acting because everyone in the school is too scared to drink.  He gives them coupons for half-off frozen yogurt and tells Will that he's spoken to his pastor about helping him with 'sex and love addictions'.\rBack in the choir room, Brittany is conflicted.  On one hand, drinking ruined them, but without it the assembly wouldn't have been a hit.  Rachel is much more negative towards drinking having been thrown up on.  Will says he's happy things worked out, but they screwed up; drinking while performing is unprofessional, drinking at school is stupid, and drinking at all (for them) is illegal.  To show his commitment, Will is going to stop drinking.  He also asks everyone in the club to sign a waiver asking them not to drink before their big performance at Nationals.  If they fall off the wagon, he's also given his cell number so that they can be safe.  They all agree to the request.\rAt the coffee shop, Rachel and Kurt wait for Blaine to arrive so that she can test her kiss theory.  When he shows up, she rushes over and candidly plants a kiss on his lips.  After the kiss, Blaine confirms that he is, in fact, 100% gay, and the kiss confirmed it.  Kurt is happy with this and Rachel is shocked; she just ended a short-lived relationship with a guy who turned out to be gay.  She takes this to be a great experience and rushes home to do some actual songwriting. \n"}]}
