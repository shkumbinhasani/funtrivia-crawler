Since truffles are wild fungi that cannot be cultivated on a farm, which animal is traditionally used to hunt these wild delicacies down?  ", "correct": "Pigs", "options": ["Sheep", "Monkeys", "Horses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPigs.\n\n\tIndeed, pigs are used to help unearth these culinary delights which are primarily found in France, Italy and Spain.  Beware though, a pig will typically eat the truffles it finds if not carefully controlled!  Truffles are wonderful in p\u00e2t\u00e9s, added atop egg and potato dishes and thinly shaved over pasta and risotto.  Though they are terribly expensive, I recommend giving truffles a try...one can go a long way! \n"}, {"text": "Varieties of this pelagic delicacy include Olympia, European flat and Kumamoto.  Which delicious shellfish comes in these varieties?  \n", "correct": "Oysters", "options": ["Clams", "Mussels", "Scallops"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOysters.\n\n\tWonderful oysters can be eaten raw, smoked or cooked.

Which storyteller was responsible for popularizing the term 'filet mignon' in the English speaking world?", "correct": "O. Henry", "options": ["Poe", "Dickens", "Twain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nO. Henry\n\n\tThe term 'filet mignon' was mentioned in O'Henry's 1906 book 'The Four Million', and became a part of the vernacular soon after.  The term is from the French: filet = boneless slice of meat and mignon = dainty.  Filet mignon can be prepared in a multitude of ways...the key is in the sauce, there are literally dozens of popular sauces to top this tender cut of beef! \n"}, {"text": "Saffron is a powerfully-flavored spice derived from the crocus flower (the stigma).  From which language was the name 'saffron' ultimately derived?", "correct": "Arabic", "options": ["Greek", "Sanskrit", "Latin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArabic.\n\n\tThe name saffron is ultimately derived from the Arabic 'za'far\u00e2n'.  The reddish spice is very expensive due to the extraordinary labor involved in its production, which must be done by hand.  Individual pickers must carefully pluck each flower's stigma, and it takes around 80,000-100,000 flowers to produce only one pound of the stuff!  The crocus flowers used to produce saffron are grown most extensively in Spain and Persia, where you will find many a red-fingered saffron plucker. Fortunately, saffron is so aromatic that only a few threads are needed to create a good dish, and it's used in a number of great ones, including the Spanish rice dish called 'paella'. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most popular sweets in human history is the delicious, bee-produced concoction that we call honey.

Honey is also a source of several anti-oxidants, now viewed as key components of a healthy lifestyle.  Aside from these facts, honey is delicious in tea, on pancakes, in sauces and dips and within virtually any dessert.  Aside from this, honey never spoils...though it does crystallize.  It can be stored for ages! \n"}, {"text": "Caviar consists of the roe, or eggs, of the sturgeon fish.  There are several types of sturgeon-produced caviar popular amongst connoisseurs, which of these is not one of them? ", "correct": "Tobiko", "options": ["Sevruga", "Beluga", "Osetra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTobiko.\n\n\tTobiko is not sturgeon roe, but rather comes from the flying fish.  The other three choices: Beluga, Osetra and Sevruga, are all types of caviar popular amongst aficionados.  Caviar can be added to numerous dishes, but is most often appreciated on toast.  When using caviar, avoid traditional silverware in favor of mother-of-pearl or wood! \n"}, {"text": "The name 'foie gras' often elicits fond memories of fine dinners for many a gourmand.  How does this term 'foie gras' translate from the French?", "correct": "Fattened liver", "options": ["Goose fat", "Buttered Duck", "Oily poultry innards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFattened liver.\n\n\t'Foie' is French for 'liver', while 'gras' is the French word for 'fat'.

The most popular dish created by duck or goose livers is called 'p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras', a creamy paste that serves as a wonderful appetizer.  Foie gras is frequently pan-seared and served over a bed of polenta among other wonderful dishes. \n"}, {"text": "Mushrooms, especially of the wild variety, are a welcome addition to almost any meal.  Some mushrooms, because they cannot be cultivated on a farm, are very expensive in markets.  Which of these would certainly be the most expensive you would find in any market?", "correct": "Matsutake", "options": ["Morels", "Chanterelles", "Maitake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatsutake.\n\n\tDepending on the yearly crop of matsutake mushrooms, they can run upwards of 150 dollars *per mushroom* in Japan!  Though the three other mushrooms mentioned are typically quite expensive, they rarely sell for anywhere near the price of a typical matsutake (on average they sell for about half the price.)  Sometimes, matsutake mushrooms are even more expensive than truffles, normally the most costly fungi in the world.  Please see my quiz 'Romp Through the Mushrooms' for more on this delicious topic! \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the 'king of shellfish', the lobster is prized by lovers of seafood.
