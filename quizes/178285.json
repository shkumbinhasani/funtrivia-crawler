{"id": "178285", "name": "Movies, Books, Etc. - In Other Words Quiz | Entertainment | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Entertainment Word Play", "Mixed Entertainment In Other Words"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these sets of characters would you find in the science fiction film alternatively titled 'The 24-Hour Period in Which the Telluric Globe Ceased to Perambulate'?", "correct": "Klaatu and Gort", "options": ["Dr. Zaius and Cornelius", "Hari and Dr. Sartorius", "Spock and Sulu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlaatu and Gort.\n\n\tThe actual film title in this case is 'The Day the Earth Stood Still', a 1951 film directed by Robert Wise and featuring a Martian (Klaatu) and his robot friend Gort.  'Telluric' is an adjective derived from the Latin 'tellur-, tellus', meaning 'Earth'.  'Perambulate' is a fancy way of saying 'to travel from place to place' (literally, to 'walk around', from the Latin 'perambulare'). \n"}, {"text": "Which author would have been rather less happy with the following title for one of his/her greatest works: 'Excessive Self Worth and a Jaundiced Eye'?", "correct": "Jane Austen", "options": ["Sinclair Lewis", "Ernest Hemingway", "Nathaniel Hawthorne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJane Austen.\n\n\tJane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' (1813) is considered by many to be her greatest work, and by some to be the greatest work in the history of English literature.  One definition of 'pride' is 'excessive self worth', while, to look at someone with 'a jaundiced eye' suggests a certain preconceived resentment, akin to prejudice. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these films might have been less well accepted by movie-going audiences if it had been titled 'Picaroons of the Large Salt Water Expanse that Extends from Central America to the Lesser Antilles'?", "correct": "Pirates of the Caribbean", "options": ["Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPirates of the Caribbean.\n\n\t'Pirates of the Caribbean' was the apt title of the megahit film starring Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush that hit theaters in 2003.  'Picaroon' is a rather obscure term that means 'rogue, scoundrel', and can be used to describe a pirate.  The Caribbean Sea stretches from Central America at its westernmost extend to the Lesser Antilles at its far eastern end. \n"}, {"text": "If the author of a certain famous tome decided on the name 'A State of Armed Conflict Between Different Nations and the Freedom from, or Cessation of, Such Conflict', would anyone have ever picked up his work?  Which author fortunately did not select the above title, electing for a more apt name?", "correct": "Leo Tolstoy", "options": ["Cervantes", "Shakespeare", "Homer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeo Tolstoy.\n\n\tRussian novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote the epic 'War and Peace' from 1865 to 1869, and fortunately chose a less orotund title than perhaps I could have suggested. \n"}, {"text": "Which rock group could have chosen 'A Particular Female Australopithecus Afarensis in the Firmament with Clear, Colorless Crystalline forms of Pure Carbon' for one of their famous songs, but fortunately did not?", "correct": "The Beatles", "options": ["Rolling Stones", "U2", "The Police"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Beatles.\n\n\tSince 'Lucy' is the name of the most famous fossil remains of the proto-human species 'Australopithecus Afarensis', the sky is sometimes referred to as the firmament in literature/poetry, and diamonds are indeed 'clear, colorless crystaline forms of pure carbon', it's possible that the Beatles could have gone with the above title.  Thank the firmament they didn't! \n"}, {"text": "'The Prolonging of One's Mnemonic Powers' could have been a very felicitous title for which of the following artist's most well-known works?", "correct": "Salvador Dali", "options": ["Rene Magritte", "Pablo Picasso", "Henri Matisse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalvador Dali.\n\n\tSalvador Dali's haunting surrealist painting 'The Persistence of Memory' is certainly one of the most prized works of modern art.  Since when one persists s/he prolongs a certain activity, and since 'mnemonic powers' (mnemonic being derived from the Greek 'mnumonikos', meaning 'mindful') is another way to describe memory, Dali could have gone with my more exciting title.  Why he didn't is beyond my powers of comprehension! \n"}, {"text": "This one should be a challenge.  Which of the following television titles could also have been called 'Ambulant Lazaretto Where Procedures Meant to Correct or Relieve Injury are Performed for the Martial Forces of a Nation'?", "correct": "M*A*S*H", "options": ["Rescue 911", "E. R.", "General Hospital"], "explanation": "\n\n\nM*A*S*H.\n\n\tOf course most people know that 'M*A*S*H' stands for 'Mobile Army Surgical Hospital', but do they know that 'ambulant' means 'mobile', that 'lazaretto' is an historical term for 'hospital' or that an army of a nation might be described as its 'martial forces'?  'M*A*S*H' was not only a television show (that ran from 1972-1983), it was also a 1970 film and a novel by Richard Hooker about his experience as an army surgeon during the Korean War. \n"}, {"text": "Which artist could have taken the liberty to use the ultra-loquacious title 'Bulbous Plants with Large Trumpet-shaped Flowers Floating in an Aqueous Solution' for one of his most well-known works?", "correct": "Claude Monet", "options": ["Rembrandt van Rijn", "Vincent van Gogh", "Leonardo da Vinci"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClaude Monet.\n\n\tLuckily, Claude Monet chose the title 'Water Lilies' to describe his series of pictures of said flowers, rather than using my suggestion.  Monet painted the almost abstract 'Water Lilies' in his garden at Giverny during the latter period of his life. \n"}, {"text": "'The Excessively Pronounced Monocrat' is probably not a title considered by which of these classic film-makers for one of his greatest works?", "correct": "Charlie Chaplin", "options": ["Alfred Hitchcock", "John Ford", "Buster Keaton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlie Chaplin.\n\n\tCharlie Chaplin wrote and directed 'The Great Dictator' in 1940, during a time when Hitler was just beginning his plan to conquer Europe.  Chaplin's Hitler character was named Adenoid Hynkel, dictator of the mythical land of Tomania.\r Aside from 'monocrat', another fun word for dictator is 'autarch'. \n"}, {"text": "'A Modicum of Harmonic Vocal and/or Instrumental Sounds Produced in a Nocturnal Setting' is a wildly more fascinating title for a work by which of these composers?", "correct": "Mozart", "options": ["Bach", "Beethoven", "Mussorgsky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMozart.\n\n\tMozart's 1787 serenade entitled 'A Little Night Music' (German title: 'Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, K.525') is one of his most well-known pieces. \n"}]}
