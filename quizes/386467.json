{"id": "386467", "name": "My Precious (Metals) Quiz | Chemistry | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Chemistry", "Metals"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these metals, with an atomic number of 49, appears to be a silvery gray once refined?", "correct": "Indium", "options": ["Wonderflonium", "Gold", "Copper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndium.\n\n\tIndium is the only real element on the list that is anywhere near gray. Gold and copper are both known for their colors. Wonderflonium is a fictional element from the internet show \"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\".\r The metal was named indium after the color it turns, indigo, when in liquid form. \n"}, {"text": "Named after the third-largest asteroid by mass, this element is a silver-white metal and it was discovered by William Hyde Wollaston in 1803. What is this element that is used in catalytic converters, jewelry, and dentistry?", "correct": "Palladium", "options": ["Gold", "Uranium", "Cerium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPalladium.\n\n\tPalladium has an atomic number of 46 and it is one of the elements within the platinum group metals. Named after the asteroid Pallas, in 2007 the top-producing palladium nations included Russia with 44%, South Africa with 40%, Canada with 6%, and the United States with 5%. \n"}, {"text": "Discovered by Russian chemist Karl Karlovich Klaus in 1844, what was the last of the six platinum group metals to be found?", "correct": "Ruthenium", "options": ["Uranium", "Einsteinium", "Berkelium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRuthenium.\n\n\tUsually found with platinum deposits, it is chiefly a byproduct of platinum mining and refining. It can also be a byproduct of nickel mining, such as in Ontario, Canada's Sudbury region. \n"}, {"text": "Despite being fake when first used in Marvel Comics, Vibranium ended up being discovered in the African nation of Wakanda.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBoth Vibranium and the nation of Wakanda are made up. Within the Marvel Comics universe the metal is the rarest and strongest on Earth, but in the real world it doesn't exist. \n"}, {"text": "With an element symbol of Au, which metal is shiny and often used as currency and in jewelry making across the world?", "correct": "Gold", "options": ["Bronze", "Adamantium", "Copper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGold.\n\n\tGold is a soft metal that has many uses. It was used as one of the earliest forms of currency in the world, and is used to make jewelry, dental implants and many contacts for various electrical devices. \n"}, {"text": "Osmium is a very heavy, yet fragile and brittle, metal.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOsmium is one of the Platinum group metals, with a bluish, silvery shine when in a solid form.\r It has a high melting point, and is the most dense of all naturally occurring elements. \n"}, {"text": "Among those listed, which metal is used most often to make jet engine parts?", "correct": "Rhenium", "options": ["Gold", "Osmium", "Silver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRhenium.\n\n\tRhenium has a very high melting point, making it great to use for jet engines, filaments and other pieces and parts that get quite hot on a frequent basis. \r Its atomic number is 75 and it is known by the symbol Re on the periodic table. \n"}, {"text": "China, Mexico and Chile were among the major producers and exporters of which oft-used precious metal in the early 21st century?", "correct": "Silver", "options": ["Venomite", "Copper", "Rhenium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilver.\n\n\tSilver, along with Gold, is one of the most valuable precious metals because of its worldwide use as a form of currency. \r From 2000 to 2009, China, Mexico and Chile were the top three producers of silver in the world. Silver had an atomic number of 47. \n"}, {"text": "Which corrosion resistant metal from group 10 is stable at high temperatures and is also one of the more malleable precious metals?", "correct": "Platinum", "options": ["Aluminum", "Ruthenium", "Iridium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlatinum.\n\n\tPlatinum, among the metals in this quiz, is second only to gold in malleability. \r The metal is highly stable, and takes much longer than most metals to start corroding when left out to the natural elements. It is often used as a catalyst for chemical reactions as it doesn't tend to react to much on its own.\r The atomic number is 78. \n"}, {"text": "Among those listed, which is the most rare metal to find in nature?", "correct": "Rhodium", "options": ["Aluminum", "Iron", "Copper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRhodium.\n\n\tRhodium's atomic number is 45 and it's periodic symbol is Rh. \r Rhodium is among the most rare of all naturally occurring elements. It is often used to coat silver or white gold jewelry to help it have an extra shine, and is used in nuclear reactors to measure neutron flux. \n"}]}
