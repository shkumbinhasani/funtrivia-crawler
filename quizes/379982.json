Finding clothes after the morph back is the hard part.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn the book series, the teens can only morph with a skin tight leotard, but in the TV series whatever they happen to be wearing when they morph is what they are wearing when they morph back into human form.\r Seeing the clothes morph with the kids made sure that each morph was unique even if they were changing into the same animal. \n"}, {"text": "How did the teens manage to change into animals?", "correct": "They had to \"acquire\" the DNA of an animal.", "options": ["They have to be near the animal at the time of the change.", "They just had to think about an animal.", "It is never explained how, it just happens."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey had to \"acquire\" the DNA of an animal.\n\n\tThe teens have to make physical contact with the animal at least once. This is typically shown as them laying a hand on the animal and concentrating. The animal goes into a trance-like state and then whoever acquired the DNA could change into the animal whenever they wanted. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first of the group shown to have morphed?", "correct": "Jake", "options": ["Tobias", "Marco", "Cassie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJake.\n\n\tJake changed into his dog Homer just a few minutes after Elfangor gave them the ability. \r He didn't exactly know what he was doing, but he was forced into making the change when the Yeerk controllers were closing in on him. He changed into the dog and ran through a construction site to escape.\r The next day Cassie started experimenting and eventually the entire group learned how to use their morphing ability. \n"}]}
