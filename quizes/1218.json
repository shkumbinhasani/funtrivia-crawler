{"id": "1218", "name": "Un-ORG-anized Words Trivia Game | Word Play | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", " Word Play", "Words in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "RoboCop was one, and so was the T-800.", "correct": "Cyborg", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCyborg.\n\n\tThe classic sci-fi creation known as a 'Cybernetic Organism', the cyborg has reappeared in literature, TV, film, and video games on a consistent basis, often forcing the viewer to question the nature of humanity and artifice.  In RoboCop's case, cop Alex Murphy was revived with his cybernetic enhancements after he was killed by Detroit thugs and it led him to be able to wipe out crime in the futuristic version of the city.  The T-800 was Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in \"The Terminator\", combining a metal skeleton and computer mind with human flesh. \n"}, {"text": "It's the title of a Gershwin opera from which the song \"Summertime\" originated.", "correct": "Porgy and Bess", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPorgy and Bess.\n\n\tPremiering in 1935, this Gershwin opera was quickly pushed to Broadway and, over time, became one of the most-celebrated English-language operas of the 20th century despite what would, in a more modern time, be considered problematic.  \"Porgy and Bess\" was made into a film in 1959 though it was despised by the Gershwin Estate and vanished from circulation until the 2000s.  George Gershwin passed away in 1937, leaving behind a prolific back-catalogue of orchestral works and Broadway musicals, the influence of which persists to this day. \n"}, {"text": "It's a term for a handheld optical item, prescription or not.", "correct": "Lorgnette", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLorgnette.\n\n\tUsed generally as a fashion accessory instead of a practical optical piece, the lorgnette is perhaps best known for being brought to the opera or other upper-class gatherings by women in fancy dress.  It's not to say that lorgnettes didn't use corrective lenses, but it took some time before they were adopted outside of France.  Englishwomen of upper nobility often used these as a replacement for glasses, which were generally only considered to suit men with vision problems. \n"}, {"text": "It's a U.S. state and a country.", "correct": "Georgia", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorgia.\n\n\tThe southeastern United State of Georgia, home to the cities of Atlanta, Savannah, and Augusta, is known for a wide range of features including its mountains, its heat, its peaches, and its swamps.  It's a far cry from the nation of Georgia which, sitting on the Black Sea on Asia's western edge, might not be the first place that comes to most peoples' minds when they think of the name.  The Asian Georgia came first, and it has a history dating back to the 12th century BC. \n"}, {"text": "It's a crime to do this, writing something and passing it off as a fake.", "correct": "Forgery", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nForgery.\n\n\tForgery involves recreating a legally-binding text or duplicating an existing piece in order to pass it off as one's own.  Although you would be likely to see signatures forged (which would be a form of identity theft if done), you may also see art forgeries, replications of paintings or other works of art created to mimic an existing work. It's likely a criminal offence no matter what way you cut it and, if brought to trial, could result in extensive prison time.  Though the word 'forgery' sound like it could relate to blacksmithing, it actually comes from the French verb 'forger', which means 'to falsify'. \n"}, {"text": "Medusa was one of these types of creatures.", "correct": "Gorgon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGorgon.\n\n\tA creature of Greek mythology, Medusa was known for her hair of snakes and her petrifying gaze; if anyone looked into her eyes she would turn them to stone.  Medusa wasn't the only Gorgon in the old legends but she was one who was slain, having been decapitated by Perseus.  He would use her head to turn Atlas, who carried the world on his shoulders, to stone (creating the Atlas Mountains in Western Africa).  The Gorgons were considered sea creatures as their parents were a sea monster and a sea god. \n"}, {"text": "It's the last name of serial killer Dexter from the TV show and Jeff Lindsay novel series.", "correct": "Morgan", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorgan.\n\n\tFirst appearing in \"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\" in 2004, Dexter Morgan seemed to be a serial killer with a conscience, only facing his dark urges by being a serial killer of other killers.  Working right under the nose of investigators as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, he would narrowly evade capture in most of his books despite obvious setbacks.  The books became a popular Showtime television series starring Michael C. Hall in 2006. \n"}, {"text": "It's a Welsh breed of herding dog.", "correct": "Corgi & Welsh Corgi", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCorgi & Welsh Corgi.\n\n\tThe corgi comes in two breeds, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, and both refer to small herding dogs originally bred in Wales for the sake of rounding up cattle.  Today, they may still be used in this way on a small scale but they've emerged as popular pets for dog owners who seek a smaller breed.  Stubbier than many dogs, it may be interesting to note that the Welsh name 'corgi' translates to 'dwarf dog'.  Perhaps the most popular corgis are those that were owned by Queen Elizabeth II; at one point she had five at the same time. \n"}, {"text": "A harmonica is also called a mouth... what?", "correct": "Organ", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrgan.\n\n\tWhile a harmonica isn't the only instrument that could be given the nickname 'mouthorgan', it is likely the most common.  A wind instrument that creates sounds that vary in pitch depending on the way you blow into its many reeds, the harmonica is known for its use in blues and rock music, especially from America.  Another interesting instrument that could follow this concept is the melodica, a combination wind instrument and keyboard played by pressing keys to let air flow through and make notes. \n"}, {"text": "It's a millet often associated with molasses and a sweet 'mash'.", "correct": "Sorghum", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSorghum.\n\n\tWhile sorghum doesn't grow all around the world it does act as a critical crop in a number of regions, notably Africa, Asia, and Australia, where it can thrive.  As a grain, it's often used in animal feed but can also be made into a syrup or molasses or, as with most grains, into a type of alcohol, which it has been for millennia.  Interestingly, because of its wide use as an additive in other end products, it's one of the most grown crops on the planet and one that's looked at closely as a component of efficient biofuel. \n"}]}
