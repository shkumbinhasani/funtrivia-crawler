{"id": "162182", "name": "Hard The Masters and Their Works III Quiz / Test | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Matching Artist and Art"], "questions": [{"text": "One of the most marvelous and gifted portraitists of the early Renaissance was Hans Holbein the Younger.  His portraits, including those of Henry VIII and several of his wives, help to give us a detailed look at his subjects.  One of his subjects was the Renaissance intellect 'Erasmus of _______'.  From whence did the famed Renaissance scholar, and sitter for Holbein, come?  ", "correct": "Rotterdam", "options": ["Augsburg", "Cologne", "Basel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRotterdam.\n\n\tHolbein's portrait of Desiderius Erasmus seated at his desk writing a letter is one of the most intimate works of portraiture in the history of painting.  Though the painting was done in Basel, where Erasmus had settled, the humanist was originally from the Netherlands.  Holbein was German, having been born in the southern city of Augsburg. \n"}, {"text": "The mysterious Venetian artist called Giorgione never signed a painting, but about twenty known paintings have been attributed to his hand.  One of his most famous works is of a naked woman nursing her child while an onlooking soldier stands nearby.  In the background, lightning crackles above a gentle town.  The one word title of this painting is 'The ______.'  ", "correct": "Tempest", "options": ["Shepherd", "Bride", "Nursing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTempest.\n\n\tDozens of books have been written on Giorgione and his works, though little is actually known of his life.  It appears that the greatest Venetian painter, Titian, was a pupil of Giorgione's for a time.  The tiny painting called 'The Tempest' also remains mysterious, the scene having been interpreted in a multitude of fashions.  It may be seen at the Galleria dell-Accademia in Venice. \n"}, {"text": "Caravaggio, one of the true characters in the history of painting, was a specialist in the technique known as chiaroscuro.  The intense realism within his work is perhaps best characterized in the painting called '______ Thomas', created in 1599.  What completes the title of this masterpiece?  ", "correct": "Doubting", "options": ["Suspicious", "Skeptical", "Equivocal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoubting.\n\n\tThe story of Thomas and his doubts about the reincarnated Jesus are well known to those familiar with the New Testament.  Caravaggio's painting of this scene, wherein Jesus allows Thomas to physically test the wound below his chest, is an example of magnificence in composition.  The figures in Caravaggio's paintings are not idealized, as was typical of most artists of the time, but rather appeared as average folk, with furled brows, bushy and uneven hair, ragged clothing and blotchy faces. \n"}, {"text": "Piet Mondrian's characteristic style involved grids, typically outlined with black lines, and featuring primary colored rectangles and squares.  In his piece called '_______ Boogie Woogie', the grid is composed of mostly yellow lines, with blocks of blue, red and gray interspersed.   What name fits the blank in the title of this Mondrian work?  ", "correct": "Broadway", "options": ["Hollywood", "Nightclub", "Atlanta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBroadway.\n\n\tMondrian's characteristic style, which he labeled 'De Stijl' (along with Van Doesburg), involved straight lines and geometric figures (primarily squares), and used only primary colors.  Compared with his usual stuff, 'Broadway Boogie Woogie' is almost an adventure in eccentricity.  Mondrian departs a bit from his typical, basic patterns by interspersing colors rather randomly within his grids, but the work does not escape the basic geometry of his other paintings. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most stunning works of the 17th century was painted by Cristofano Allori, and can be found in the Pitti Palace in Florence.  Featuring a very common theme in Renaissance art, the painting is entitled 'Judith with the Head of _______'.  Fill in the blank with the correct name.  ", "correct": "Holofernes", "options": ["Goliath", "John the Baptist", "Zaccarias"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHolofernes.\n\n\tThe stolid-faced Judith stands with a  sword in one hand and the severed head of Holofernes in the other.  She is clad in an orange robe, with a purple and red cape on her back.  Apparently, this beautiful painting went unfinished by Allori, but one can hardly notice the trivial details he left out.  The overall composition of the piece is simply marvelous to behold! \n"}, {"text": "Of the many famous paintings by American artists, perhaps none surpass in notoriety the most well-known work by James Abbott McNeill Whistler, commonly called 'Whistler's Mother'.  The painting is alternatively known as 'Arrangement in ____ and ____, #2.'  What two colors fit the blanks?  \n", "correct": "Grey, Black & Black, Grey & Gray, Black & Black, Gray & Black and Gray & Black and Grey & Grey and Black & Gray and Black & Gray Black & Grey Black & Black Grey & Black Grey", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrey, Black & Black, Grey & Gray, Black & Black, Gray & Black and Gray & Black and Grey & Grey and Black & Gray and Black & Gray Black & Grey Black & Black Grey & Black Grey.\n\n\tWhistler's 'Arrangement in Grey and Black, #2' is alternatively known as 'Portrait of the Artist's Mother', or more popularly as 'Whistler's Mother'.  You can view this painting with two very fitting titles at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. \n"}, {"text": "Vincent van Gogh, inheritor of the artistic traditions created by the French Impressionists, is often said to have been the inspiration behind the Expressionist movement.  One of his most famous paintings was his 'Portrait of Dr. _____', a work he did of his doctor in 1890.  What was the good doctor's surname?  \n", "correct": "Gachet", "options": ["Gautreau", "Gascon", "Givenchy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGachet.\n\n\tVincent painted two portraits of Dr. Gachet.  One of them (which can be seen here: http://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/p_0753.htm) is among of his most famous paintings, not simply because of its expressionist content, but because it was sold in 1990 to a Japanese investor for 82.5 million dollars, the most ever received for a painting at auction.  Sadly, the Japanese investor lost a fortune on the painting, having to sell it back to Christie's for only a fraction of his purchase price. \n"}, {"text": "William Blake was most well-known for his poetry, and perhaps rightly so.  But Blake was not only an excellent poet, he also established himself as a masterful painter, albeit one who ignored the conventional rules of painting.  One of his watercolors, entitled 'The _____ of Days', exemplifies his unique style.  Which of these words completes the title?  ", "correct": "Ancient", "options": ["Continuance", "Terror", "Infinity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAncient.\n\n\tBlake purposefully flouted the rules of perspective and composition, preferring to paint under his own terms.  Some called him mad, but Blake's works exhibit an expressive style that seemingly predicted the Expressionist movement that began nearly a century later.  The squat figure of God in his 'The Ancient of Days' reminds one somewhat of an unpolished Michelangelo. \n"}, {"text": "Titian, often considered the greatest Venetian master, painted two large-scale works that can now be found in the church of Sta. Maria dei Frari in Venice.  One is his famous 'Assumption of the Virgin', and the other is called 'The ______ Altarpiece'.  What family name finishes the title of this second great work?  ", "correct": "Pesaro", "options": ["Sforza", "Cadore", "Portinari"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPesaro.\n\n\tTitian was born Tiziano Vicellio in Cadore, Italy.  He made his way to Venice at a young age, and became one of the great masters of that eastern Italian town during his lifetime.  Not one but two of his greatest works can be seen in the Frari Church, a must visit for any traveler to the city.  The Pesaro Altarpiece is also called 'Madonna with Saints and Members of the Pesaro Family', but that title is rather cumbersome.  It's less visible than the 'Assumption', which can be found in the apse of the church.  The 'Pesaro Altarpiece' is located along the left aisle, about three-quarters of the way along the nave from the main doors. \n"}, {"text": "Duccio, the father of Sienese art, is probably most well-known for his 'Maesta', which is located in Siena's cathedral museum.  Another of his best known works was 'The ______ Madonna', which can be discovered by art lovers in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.  Which of these finishes the title of this great Duccio work?  ", "correct": "Rucellai", "options": ["Fiorentino", "Scrovegni", "Apollonian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRucellai.\n\n\tThe 'Rucellai Madonna' was mistakenly ascribed to Cimabue by Vasari, but this error was finally rectified in the late 19th century, when scholars discovered enough evidence to reassign the painting to the hand of Duccio.  The piece is named for the Rucellai Chapel in the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, where it had hung for centuries.  It is now safely located in the Uffizi, providing purveyors of art in Florence a taste of Duccio's genius.  Thank you for having tried this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it.
