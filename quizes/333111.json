{"id": "333111", "name": "\"Bart the Daredevil\" Online Trivia | 'Simpsons' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Simpsons", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "What do Bart and his friends (and Homer, with the guys at the bar) watch in the beginning of the episode?", "correct": "Wrestling", "options": ["\"McBain\"", "Ballet", "Football"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWrestling.\n\n\tAs this episode opens, Bart and his friends (and Lisa) watch wrestling at home.  This match as Springfield's Center for the Performing Arts is a big one, and two European juggernauts battle in the ring for the glory.  At Moe's Tavern, Homer and the guys are watching the same thing (with more enthusiasm).  Unsurprisingly, both Bart and Homer act the same way when not around each other.  As the fight ends in a surely illegal upset (one wrestler bashes the others head with a wrench to win), both sets of viewers throw food at their TV screens and boo. \n"}, {"text": "What major monster truck-eating machine do Bart and Homer want to see?", "correct": "Truckasaurus", "options": ["The Monster-Eater", "The Chomper", "Consumasaurus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTruckasaurus.\n\n\tAfter wrestling, a commercial for monster trucks instantly grabs Homer and Bart's attention.  The clip shows dirtbike basketball, trucks riding over large dirt courses, and the infamous Truckasaurus, a mechanical creation that eats cars and shoots fire.  Since it's one night only at Springfield Stadium, they have to act fast.  Homer drives home to confirm this with Bart; both of them are clearly excited for this vehicle-crushing main event. \n"}, {"text": "The monster truck rally, it is discovered, conflicts with which other event?", "correct": "Lisa's recital", "options": ["A funeral", "Bart's dentist appointment", "Maggie's birthday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLisa's recital.\n\n\tAt dinner, Homer makes the announcement that as a family growth activity, they will all be attending Saturday's monster truck rally.  Unfortunately, he also happened to forget that Lisa's music recital is on the same night, conflicting with his plans to watch Truckasaurus.  It also happens to be Lisa's first solo performance, something very important to her. Marge reasons that the recital is at 5:00pm and Truckasaurus is at 8:00pm, so there's time for both.  At the recital, Homer seems very eager to leave as soon as possible.  The rest of the audience demonstrates patience as they wait through a fairly extensive performance of Schubert's \"Unfinished Symphony\". \n"}, {"text": "Which of these do Homer and Marge mistake for a parking spot at Springfield Stadium?", "correct": "The inside of the stadium", "options": ["The ticket booth", "A sidewalk", "A bus stop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe inside of the stadium.\n\n\tImmediately after the recital (which Homer carries Lisa out of) the family aggressively drives through Springfield to reach the stadium on time for Truckasaurus.  Finding that there are very few parking spots available, Marge points out one prospective space and Homer rushes over to it.  They soon discover that this is actually the entrance to the stadium and they get caught in the thick mud right in front of the main event.  Truckasaurus picks them up and sticks the car into its mouth. \n"}, {"text": "As an apology on behalf of Truckasaurus, Marge is given a bottle of perfume from the owner of the mechanical creature.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe family is pulled from the car and Marge receives a cheque to compensate for the extensive damages done to the family vehicle.  The owner and operator of the Truckasaurus states that the creature (and its team) are very sorry for what has transpired and he offers then a free half-bottle of domestic champagne to make amends.  Marge gladly accepts his generous offer.\rThe family sits back for an evening of rallies, explosions, and loud noises and everyone finds something to enjoy.  At the end of the night, the announcer states that there is a special surprise in store: the world's greatest daredevil, Lance Murdock, is performing a crazy stunt! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not in the deadly tank jumped over by Lance Murdock for his stunt?", "correct": "Jellyfish", "options": ["Lion", "Piranha", "Electric eels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJellyfish.\n\n\tMurdock introduces his most dangerous stunt ever.  He plans to jump a giant tank of water on his motorcycle, but in this tank he has man-eating great white sharks, electric eels, piranhas, alligators, and a live lion.  To top it off, he adds a drop of his own blood (which sets the creatures off).  While the people in the stadium cover their eyes, Bart is the only one to watch. Murdock jumps the tank and makes it!  The crowd cheers as Murdock makes his way to the edge of the tank in celebration and accidentally falls in.  The animals get him, but the paramedics fish him out and take him to an ambulance (though he still gives a thumbs up).  On the ride home in their beat-up car, Bart daydreams about becoming a daredevil. \n"}, {"text": "To perform his 'stunts', which of these does Bart ride?", "correct": "Skateboard", "options": ["Rollerblades", "Bike", "Dirtbike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkateboard.\n\n\tThe next day, Bart sets up a dangerous stunt outside his own home.  His friends watch on as he takes to his skateboard and attempts to jump over the family car on a ramp.  He hits the ramp, but flies into the air, landing on the pavement.  His friends, worried that he might be hurt, decide to make a run for it.\rBart ends up in the emergency room with nothing more than stitches on his forehead.\rTo dissuade Bart from a career in daredevilry, Dr. Hibbert leads him through a ward of the hospital designed for kids who tried to imitate dangerous entertainers.  Amongst its patients are a kid who tried to fly like Superman and one whose head was hit by a wrench as a result of the wrestling match earlier in the week.  Bart thanks Dr. Hibbert for the wise words. \n"}, {"text": "When does Bart get the idea to jump over Springfield Gorge?", "correct": "On a field trip", "options": ["During class", "In bed", "From TV"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn a field trip.\n\n\tHibbert's lesson doesn't matter; Bart goes home to try his stunt again.  With his friends watching from the sidelines, Bart once more tries to jump the family's (surviving) car only this time he lands the jump.  Soon, he's making more daring jumps over swimming pools, his father, and a line-up of dogs.  On a field trip to Springfield Gorge, Bart expresses his lack of ideas to Milhouse, but he soon determines that the Gorge is the next logical jump for him to make. Otto, the first person he tells, says that as the only adult there, he thinks the idea is cool.  Bart announces his jump over the bus' PA system and the news shocks Lisa who says that she'd like Bart to meet somebody. \n"}, {"text": "Lance Murdock is against Bart's idea to jump Springfield Gorge.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLisa brings Bart back to the hospital to speak to Lance Murdock, who is in a full-body cast.  Bart is somewhat starstruck and Lance writes him an autograph (with a pen in his mouth).  When Lisa describes Bart's plans to jump over Springfield Gorge, Murdock asks Dr. Hibbert and his nurse to leave.  He admits his delight in Bart's plan to jump the Gorge as it's a hit with the ladies and while he ends up in the hospital he's famous and well-off. Lisa is disappointed that her plan backfired and she tells Marge and Homer who immediately disapprove of it.  Homer forbids Bart from jumping and sends him to his room, but Bart promises to rebel. When he goes upstairs, Homer follows and finds him trying to leave out the window.  Homer makes Bart promise not to cross the gorge (and he does) but Bart breaks it almost immediately. \n"}, {"text": "Who ultimately makes the jump attempt over Springfield Gorge?", "correct": "Homer", "options": ["Bart", "No one takes the jump", "Otto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHomer.\n\n\tBart arrives at the Springfield Gorge on his skateboard and showboats for the crowd before ascending a ramp for the main event.  Before he makes the jump, Homer arrives, rushes up, and knocks him off the skateboard just in time.  To prove how horrible an idea it is, Homer decides to jump the gorge himself.  Bart pleads with him not to and decides not to jump having learned his lesson.  Homer, happy with this decision, says that he's never felt closer to Bart than he does at that moment, but he doesn't realize that the skateboard is slipping over the edge and down the hill.  Forced to make the jump, Homer flies through the air and 'nearly' makes it.  Instead he falls down the gorge on the opposite side, landing at the bottom and needing to be airlifted out.  As they load him into an ambulance, the ambulance crashes into a tree and he falls back into the gorge.\rHomer ends up in a hospital bed and full-body cast next to Lance Murdock. \n"}]}
