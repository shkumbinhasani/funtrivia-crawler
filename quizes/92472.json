{"id": "92472", "name": "Critique of Pure Reason Quiz | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Philosophy"], "questions": [{"text": "Who was the philosopher that shook Kant to such a degree, that he was compelled to publish this interesting tome?", "correct": "David Hume", "options": ["Socrates", "Aristotle", "George Berkeley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Hume.\n\n\tHume created a severe sense of disconnection in Kant. Hume's skeptical analysis of the mind's power to understand reality, shook Kant to a disturbing degree, that this book was probably written in order to justify that the mind was somewhat capable of understanding reality. \n"}, {"text": "What does Kant call the 'pure, original and unchanging consciousness'?  ", "correct": "transcendental apperception", "options": ["mindfulness", "cultural norms", "empirical apperception"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntranscendental apperception.\n\n\tThis form of consciousness (purusha) is what the Eastern mystics and Buddhist believe lies at the heart of each individual. This is the true self and the most essential aspect of consciousness. I am actually surprised Kant mentions this fact, but the correlation is not made from Western philosophy to Eastern philosophy.  At the heart of Kantian philosophy, lies the essence of certain transcendental aspects, which cannot be answered by the typical apperceptive-empirical logic that permeates science. Although rational thought and logic are very effective tools, they merely point to the proper direction for the mind to travel and once attainment is achieved, logic is merely a tool no longer needed. \n"}, {"text": "Is there such a thing as the Original Mind in Kant's system, which creates the order of all space and time? ", "correct": "yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nyes.\n\n\tBefore the a priori space and concept, Kant imagines there is an architectonic schema of the Original Mind. From this schema of a priori form, the synthesis of reality is then created and shared by other conscious beings. Synthesis and existence of reality is comparable to the notion of the Indian idea of the Brahmin, dreaming reality into existence. In some sense, reality despite it impenetrability and perdurance, is still dependent on the Nous for its existence. Morality, freedom and God, then all exist on the incoporeal principle of the Nous. As Platonic as these ideas sound, the Greek notion of reality and the Eastern philosophies of mind, nature and reality are very similar. In the future, I shall make a hybrid quiz on the Greek and Indian philosophies, tracing the similar lineages of these thoughts. \n"}, {"text": "How is \"logic\" defined as according to Kant?\n\n", "correct": "Logic is the subjective validation of the reproductive imagination and relational combinatorics, to describe and understand  the \"objective unity of apperception\".", "options": ["habitual thought", "a priori methodologies which strive at perfection", "nothing but symbols with meaningless sounds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLogic is the subjective validation of the reproductive imagination and relational combinatorics, to describe and understand  the \"objective unity of apperception\".\n\n"}, {"text": "What does Kant refer to as 'intensive magnitudes' and 'extensive magnitudes'? ", "correct": "appearances", "options": ["force", "space", "time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nappearances.\n\n\tIntensive magnitudes represent the internal images of the sensations derived from the extensive maginitudes (exterior fields of appearaces).   Schema, may be perdurable duration of the experienced field or the imagined field of images created in the viewer's eye. This abstract reality then can be manipulated in an abstract sense, deriving further a priori truths. Schema, dependent on  ' time-series' and 'time-determinations' of events and objects, constitute the bulk sum of reality. \n"}, {"text": "Experience is the function of perception. Perception is the function of time. What are the three modalities of Time?", "correct": "succession & simultaneity & persistence", "options": ["duration & feeling & incoporeality", "intransigence & persistence & succession", "invisibility & continuity & sympathy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsuccession & simultaneity & persistence.\n\n\tTime and space are invisible, we infer they exist a priori. But really, I wonder if time really exists? \n"}, {"text": "Kant divides the categories of objects into mundus sensibilis and mundus intelligibis. What are these categories better known as?", "correct": "noumena & phenomena", "options": ["sensation & matter", "time and space", "appearance & levity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnoumena & phenomena.\n\n"}, {"text": "Kant realizes that reason has a negative utility, namely to govern itself from going beyond its limitations. Reason, then has only one practical use- what is its practical usage?", "correct": "understanding", "options": ["analysis", "creating systems", "nothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nunderstanding.\n\n"}, {"text": "Questions of morality is tantamount to the function of reason.", "correct": "true", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntrue.\n\n"}, {"text": "The rational concept of the Being is built on \"I think\". What other philosopher made this concept so familiar?", "correct": "Descartes", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDescartes.\n\n\t\"I think\" is the composite principle that makes transcendental conceptions and judgments available to us. \n"}]}
