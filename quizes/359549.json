Of those listed, only the hazel is a true nut in the botanical sense of the word. Many more seeds are termed as nuts in culinary terms. An almond is the seed of a drupe fruit (a peach is another example of a drupe), where the seed is hard and surrounded by a fleshy exocarp.Cashews are the seeds of accessory fruits (which include apples and strawberries), where not all of the flesh around the seed is derived from the ovary. The macadamia is the seed of a follicle-type fruit. \n"}, {"text": "Which type of edible nut is produced by the Junglans tree?", "correct": "Walnut", "options": ["Chestnut", "Hazel Nut", "Pistachio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalnut.\n\n\tThe term \"walnut\" derives from the Old English 'wealhhnutu' meaning 'foreign nut', so called because it originally came to England in Roman times from France and Italy.

They also contain no gluten and no cholesterol. As a result, they weigh in at 180 calories/100g compared with around 600 calories/100g for the other types of nut. Chestnuts are also the only nuts that contain Vitamin C -- you can get about two-thirds of your recommended daily intake from just 100g of fresh chestnuts. You lose about half of the Vitamin C if you heat (roast) the chestnuts before eating them, though. \n"}, {"text": "Pecan Pie is a familiar holiday favorite, particularly in the southern US states, but from which genus of tree do pecan nuts come?", "correct": "Hickory", "options": ["Oak", "Birch", "Beech"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHickory.\n\n\tThe pecan nut comes from a type of hickory tree that is native to south and central North America.

Today, though, the USA and Spain are the world's major almond producers. Almonds can be found in many traditional foods -- they form the base for Pasanda-style curries in India, in Iran they form the base for baby food, in Italy they are used particularly to make macaroons. The best-known use for almonds is, perhaps, to make marzipan, which is popularly used in confectionery from Paris to San Francisco. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is NOT in the same botanical order as the Brazil nut?\n", "correct": "Hornbeam", "options": ["Azalea", "Blueberry", "Cranberry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHornbeam.\n\n\tThe tree that produces the Brazil nut is the Ericales order that includes numerous trees, bushes and herbaceous plants such as gooseberries, blueberries, cranberries, persimmons, azalea and phlox.
