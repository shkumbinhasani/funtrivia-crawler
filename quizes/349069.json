{"id": "349069", "name": "Survivor: Pearl Islands Multiple Choice Quiz | Survivor", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Survivor", "Survivor: Pearl Islands"], "questions": [{"text": "For the first time in \"Survivor\" history, the castaways competed with which of the following?", "correct": "Nothing but the clothes on their back", "options": ["Tents and sleeping bags", "Infinite luxuries", "Complimentary water-- no boiling their own"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNothing but the clothes on their back.\n\n\tOn Day 1, the sixteen new castaways were shocked to discover that their time in the Pearl Islands had already begun.  Told that they would be taking promotional photos, the tribe members boarded a boat with their luggage in Panama City and were whisked southeast to the Pearl Islands only to be told that they would be competing with only the clothes on their backs; their luggage would be left behind and all of their personal items would be handed over. The only additional help they'd get?  Their shoes would be tied together and tossed overboard on a buoy to give them a fighting chance with challenges. There would be nothing at their camps either. \n"}, {"text": "During their marooning, the tribes needed to find a way to their respective beaches.  During this confusion, Rupert stole which of the following from the other team?", "correct": "Shoes", "options": ["Alcohol", "Money", "Food"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShoes.\n\n\tOn Day 1, teams were split into two tribes named after famous explorers, Drake and Morgan, wearing blue and orange, and sent overboard.  Jeff, however, did hand over a sack of money to each team as well as the maps to their beaches on different islands.  Using this money, the tribes needed to purchase supplies that they could use at their camps. While the Morgan tribe worked to spend their money, Rupert, from the Drake tribe, stole their shoes and left them with the items they jumped overboard with.  Some of these were bartered for food and supplies.  Both teams ended up reaching their beach by nightfall. \n"}, {"text": "If a tribe won a Reward Challenge in \"Pearl Islands\" they would be entitled to do which of the following?", "correct": "Steal an item from the losing tribe", "options": ["Purchase any rewards lost", "Get a head start during Immunity Challenges", "Trade their rewards for a mystery chest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteal an item from the losing tribe.\n\n\tFor each tribe vs. tribe Reward Challenge during \"Pearl Islands\", the tribes were informed that they would receive a clue to a buried treasure on their respective island and, when they received all three, they would be able to find it.  In addition, one member of the winning tribe would be able to loot an item of value from the losing tribe.  Stolen items included a tarp, a water pot, and a lantern.  The treasure maps and the thievery stopped after five Reward Challenges at which point the teams merged. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was able to locate the buried treasure near their camp?", "correct": "Drake", "options": ["Morgan", "Both teams", "Neither of the teams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrake.\n\n\tBecause of their four Reward Challenge wins as a tribe, Drake received all three of their treasure map clues just past the two week point of the game.  With these, they were able to head out at low tide to dig up the treasure that was rightfully theirs on Day 11.  Inside the chest they found candles, blankets, goblets, and a hammock as well as a trove of food-- chocolate, coffee, sugar, honey, and canned goods.  Morgan did not locate their chest because they only received one map clue during their challenges. \n"}, {"text": "Which castaway from the Drake tribe was kidnapped by the Morgan tribe on Day 12?", "correct": "Rupert", "options": ["Shawn", "Burton", "Jon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRupert.\n\n\tOn Day 12, Morgan won their first Immunity Challenge, partially due to the fact that Drake threw the challenge to vote off one of their members.  At the end of the challenge, teams were shocked to discover that the winning tribe would be able to kidnap someone from the other team, saving them from the upcoming Tribal Council and utilizing his services until the end of the next Reward Challenge.  Morgan took Rupert along for the ride and his assistance won them the following Reward Challenge before he returned to Drake. \n"}, {"text": "Who of these castaways became the first player in \"Survivor\" history to quit the game?", "correct": "Osten", "options": ["Ryan", "Shawn", "Andrew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOsten.\n\n\tHeading into an impromptu Tribal Council on Day 19, the Morgan tribe was required to vote out one of their own.  Instead, Osten, who had mentally checked out of the game many days earlier and threatened to quit since the first week, decided to remove himself from the game rather than subject his tribe to a vote.  Osten left the game but his torch was never left with the other eliminated torches; Jeff Probst instead tossed the torch aside claiming that too many people would give anything to play the game and survive in it, and he simply decided to toss it aside. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these outcast tribe members returned to the game?", "correct": "Burton", "options": ["Michelle", "Ryan S.", "Trish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurton.\n\n\tArriving at the Reward Challenge on Day 19, Drake and Morgan were shocked to find that they would be competing against a purple-buffed tribe comprised of tribe members they voted out.  Deemed 'The Outcasts', this group had a chance to return to the game provided they could beat either of the tribes in the challenge. Since Drake and Morgan both fell short in the task, one member of the Outcasts would be voted back in to each tribe and no one would have immunity.  Drake voted out Shawn and Osten quit from Morgan.  Burton and Lillian returned to the game and received immunity in their next Tribal Council. \n"}, {"text": "What name did the castaways take on for their merged tribe?", "correct": "Balboa", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalboa.\n\n\tOn Day 20, the ten remaining castaways were told to drop their buffs to become a new, merged tribe.  Donning black buffs, they needed to begin their individual games immediately with an Immunity Challenge.  This was won by already-immuned Burton who gifted the second immunity to Rupert.\rThe new tribe took on the name Balboa, named after the injured snake Rupert took care of during his time on the Drake tribe.  When they combined, there were five castaways from Drake and five from Morgan, making the competition a fairly even one-- surprisingly the voting trend proved more difficult to pin down than in previous seasons. \n"}, {"text": "During the Immunity Challenge based around trivia held for the final four, Jon correctly answered the most questions and won his first immunity.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn a unique twist on the typical 'trivia about the game' Immunity Challenge, the final four were surprised to discover that they would also be battling against the jury.  Whoever answered the most questions correctly would receive immunity but if the jury ended up taking the most correct answers, none of the castaways would be safe from the vote immediately after.  The jury did, in fact, win the challenge; they beat Jon, their closest competitor.  Darrah, possibly the strongest castaway in a physical sense, was voted off as a result. \n"}, {"text": "Who, of these, became the Sole Survivor of \"Survivor: Pearl Islands\"?", "correct": "Sandra", "options": ["Jon", "Rupert", "Lillian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSandra.\n\n\tAfter voting out Darrah and Jon, it was Sandra and Lillian who made their way to the final Tribal Council vote where the jury would determine the winner of the million dollar prize.  With a vote of six to one, Sandra won in a landslide decision.  Ryan O., Rupert, Christa, Burton, Darrah, and Jon all voted for Sandra to win while Tijuana voted Lillian. Surprisingly, when Lill won immunity the day before the final vote, she decided to vote out Jon.  When the jury was asked who would win if she chose to vote out Sandra instead, they revealed that Lill likely would've taken home the million.  Sandra later returned for \"Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains\" where she won the million once again. \n"}]}
