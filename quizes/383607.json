What was placed over the man's head?", "correct": "A pig's head", "options": ["A burlap sack", "A crown of thorns", "A pillowcase"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pig's head.\n\n\tSeeing the scalped man in the forest, Shelby screamed, spying a woman with the torn scalp emerging from the trees behind.  She ran as someone chanted in the woods, surrounded by a mob of people.  Coming across their clearing, Shelby watched from behind a tree as they tied a man to a post and performed their ritual, placing a pig's head on his own and 'purifying him', roasting him on their carved spit over the bonfire. The group soon spotted Shelby in the forest and yelled to seize her, but before they could she fled.  She finally making it back to the road, but in the path of Lee's car, nearly getting hit. Shelby fainted; Lee took her to the hospital. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Flora's new 'friend' in the house?", "correct": "Priscilla", "options": ["Violet", "Jenny", "Madison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPriscilla.\n\n\tMatt went to Shelby in the hospital after the police were questioned; she told them about the human sacrifice but, when they investigated, nothing was found.  Matt promises that they can find somewhere else to stay, but Shelby says they can't leave.  It was probably the mountain men, and if they wanted to fight then that's what would happen.\rLee's daughter, Flora, ended up arriving at the house during her custody time, and the moment Lee left the room to get some food for the two of them, she ended up disappearing into the passages of the house.  Lee found her in an otherwise empty room, talking down into the dark cellar, to a new 'friend' named Priscilla.  She believed it had to do with the divorce.\rA crash was heard in another room as Lee gave her daughter a snack.  When she went to investigate, she found a broken vase next to an open window.  Next to it was an old hat.  No one else was in the house. \n"}, {"text": "Awakened by a noise in the forests at night, Matt came across a wolf in the woods.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tReturning from the hospital, Shelby worried to Matt about the whole situation.  They didn't want to lose their life savings to the house, but they would at least need to wait until they could sell.  That night, Shelby and Matt woke up to the sound of a pig squealing outside.  Taking flashlights and a bat, they ventured out into the forest, searching for the source, and ended up getting split up.  It was Matt who came across the wild hog in the forest. It was Shelby who, once again, came across the clearing.  This time, when Matt found her, they saw a stick effigy over the fire, much like the smaller ones put up in their house, but with a pig's head at the top and draped in intestines. Matt knocked it down and stomped out the fire before they headed out. \n"}, {"text": "Who witnessed the two nurses murdering Margaret in the house?", "correct": "Matt", "options": ["Shelby", "Lee", "The police"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt.\n\n\tThe cops ended up stuck dealing with the effigy in the woods.  The local hillbillies were questioned and police protection was assured; a cop car would be in the driveway all day and night until they got to the bottom of it all.\rLater that night, the phone rang.  Matt was the one to pick it up to a voice saying \"Help...they're hurting me.\"  When he found that the phone wasn't plugged in, he realized the voice was coming from behind him where, in another room, two spectral nurses were treating, and then killing an elderly woman named Margaret right before his very eyes.\rHis screams outside, alerting the cop, woke up Lee.  When they went to check, no one was in the house but them.  Matt had no choice but to blame his possible hallucinations on possible neurological damage from the attack in Los Angeles. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Flora's doll?", "correct": "Mandy", "options": ["Chloe", "Brittany", "Leah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMandy.\n\n\tLee's ex-husband, Mason, returned the next day to pick up Flora and they realized that she was off playing a game of hide-and-seek, not having told anyone.  The two of them heard noises in a crawlspace upstairs, finding her speaking to her invisible friend, Priscilla, once again.  When asked why she was speaking to Priscilla, Flora responded that she wanted to trade her doll, Mandy, in order to insure that they would all be spared.  Priscilla and the others planned to kill them all.  Hearing this, Mason grabbed their daughter and left immediately.\rThat was the day Lee fell off the wagon. \n"}, {"text": "What led to Shelby and Matt finding the storm cellar outside?", "correct": "An apparition", "options": ["A grazing deer", "A lightning strike", "Flora"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn apparition.\n\n\tMatt and Shelby found Lee in the kitchen later that day, drunk, having broken a bowl.  When they went to help her up, Shelby noticed knives sticking in the ceiling.  Even drunk, Lee stated she did not do it.  Matt put her into bed.  When he left, he never noticed the two nurses descending upon her.\rReturning to Shelby in the kitchen, Matt was shocked when the two of them looked out the window to find a girl standing on their property.  When they went outside though, no one was there.  In the spot where she stood, they found two wooden doors leading to a cellar.\rWhile Matt was outside, Lee awakened to find the two nurses in her room, but as soon as she blinked, they were gone.  She wandered back into the house, but faced things her mind couldn't explain; bloody pig tails, nailed to a wall, continued to wag; in a mirror, she saw a man with the head of a pig, but turning around he disappeared. \n"}, {"text": "What was the favourite word of Miranda and Bridget James?", "correct": "Murder", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMurder.\n\n\tMatt and Shelby descended into the storm cellar to find that it was actually filled with old preserves and handy items...and a video camera.  Setting up the camera, they watched the tape to find a man warning of horrible, malevolent forces.  He was the same man from the video in the basement, and he claimed to live in their house, only hiding in the cellar to protect himself. A professor at Bradley University named Dr. Elias Cunningham, he asserted that he was filming in 1997 and he began living in the house to write a true crime novel about Miranda and Bridget James, two nurses who also lived in the house previously. Formerly from Rochester, New York, they moved in after previous owners disappeared, opening an assisted living facility for elderly patients who they would later kill, only accepting them based on the first letter of their first name.  They would kill them to spell out the letters of the word 'MURDER'. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Matt uncover the spray-painted wall?", "correct": "In the dining room", "options": ["In the cellar", "In the bedroom", "In the attic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the dining room.\n\n\tProfessor Cunningham continued the story, saying that in 1989, the police investigated the house and found that the sisters had gone missing.  All that was found were dead patients, trays full of pulled teeth, and the word MURDER written in spray paint on a wall...though missing an R, left unfinished.  As much as people tried to paint over it, it never disappeared.  Matt and Shelby headed to the dining room where, peeling the wallpaper from the perimeter wall, he discovered the letters in vivid red.\rCunningham says that it's believed that the nurses escaped, but he's confident they didn't.  Something more evil than they were may have gotten to them first. \n"}, {"text": "In order to get their money back for the house, Matt and Shelby's only option, as they discovered, was to resell it.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWatching the video, Matt and Shelby saw as Professor Cunningham, having hidden in the storm cellar for days, decided to head back into the house for the last time to finally unearth the truth about the evils therein.  Bringing his camera along, he continued until he found a mirror in a hallway...and a figure appeared behind him.  Matt and Shelby, scared by the film, heard a noise behind them in the house; a bloody meat cleaver was embedded in the door in the hall.\rOf course, they opted to take this to their estate agent, planning to call him out for fraud and lack of disclosure.  There was nothing he could do for them; they legally bid on the house.  They would need to sell it to get rid of it.\rThey watched as the agent departed; he passed Lee returning in her car, having illegally brought her daughter back to the house. \n"}, {"text": "Flora went missing when she was completing her homework.  What did Lee find outside?", "correct": "A sweater", "options": ["A headband", "A pencil", "A backpack"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA sweater.\n\n\tMatt needed to talk to Lee about Flora; she legally committed a kidnapping as a result of her actions and the horrible custody agreement and, considering he wanted to see a judge, it was likely that it would be the final straw.  While they all talked about it in the kitchen, Flora started working on her homework in the other room.\rWhat they didn't know is that while Flora worked on her homework, she looked outside to see her friend waving her outside.  Lee headed to the living room to find her daughter missing.  A door creaked open nearby; Flora was gone.\rIt wasn't until later that they found any trace of her; her yellow sweater was found at the top of a tall, dead tree in the forest outside. \n"}]}
