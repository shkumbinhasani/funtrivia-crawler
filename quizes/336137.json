Shortly thereafter, Thomas Jefferson exclaimed: \"Yo, let's all play some 'Rock Band 3' at my place!\"  Everybody whooped in joy.  John Hancock wanted to play The Jimi Hendrix Experience's \"Crosstown Traffic\".\nIf Hancock played drums, how many other players (at the maximum) could play with him?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["None", "Four", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\t\"Rock Band 3\" was the first game in the series to accommodate for a maximum of seven players.  This total includes on player on drums, one on bass, one on guitar, a total of three different harmonious vocal players, and one person on the keyboard, an instrument designed for the game specifically (and the first of its kind in a rhythm game).  Featuring over eighty new songs, \"Rock Band 3\" improved upon the already-winning formula brought down by Harmonix in earlier installments of the game.\r The game was released to rave reviews in 2010, but I'm sure that the American founding fathers got an advance copy in the eighteenth century.  \"Fly Like an Eagle\" would've been a hit at parties. \n"}, {"text": "In 1815, during his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon Bonaparte was once said to have claimed \"Alas!  I have been felled in battle!  Perhaps now is the best time for me to resign and focus on my 'CoD' achievements!\"\nWhat Activision video game series would Napoleon be playing?", "correct": "Call of Duty", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCall of Duty.\n\n\t\"Call of Duty\", first released in 2003, became immensely popular at the end of the 2000s due to its easy-to-use online multiplayer system and the advent of gaming's seventh generation.  With new systems like the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 on the way, Activision became a leading developer and \"Call of Duty\" was a driving force in sales (along with, at the time, \"Guitar Hero\").  Games like \"Modern Warfare 1 and 2\", \"Black Ops\", and \"World at War\" set the standards for future war games and millions of players logged on in the first few day of each release to get a piece of the action.\r If Napoleon were working on his achievements, he'd probably be playing on his Xbox 360, a staple in every European living room (along with the HDTV and Microsoft Kinect) in the early nineteenth century, I'm told.  Perhaps he'll have better luck there than at the Battle of Waterloo. \n"}, {"text": "In 1520, Ferdinand Magellan was already making headway on his circumnavigation of the globe when he crossed into the Pacific Ocean.  Upon rounding the tip of South America in the region that would later be known as the Strait of Magellan, he exclaimed \"It's-a-me!  Magellan!\"  This was a variation of which famous video game character's catchphrase?", "correct": "Mario", "options": ["Yoshi", "Donkey Kong", "Master Chief"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMario.\n\n\tMario is perhaps one of the most iconic faces in the video gaming world.  Debuting in \"Donkey Kong\" as Jumpman, he's appeared in more games than any other Nintendo franchise character in the history of the company.  His platforming games consistently rate high and sell millions of copies.  He's been in scores of games and series since his inception.\r Since Magellan's journey was cut short by his capture and death in The Philippines in 1521, he was likely unable to play many of the games in the \"Mario\" series though I'm confident that he was able to enjoy the exploits of everyone's favourite Goomba-stomping, video game plumber on his Game Boy Advance or Nintendo DS handheld. \n"}, {"text": "In 1775, Paul Revere held his famous Midnight Ride in which he warned the prospective Americans of oncoming British forces.  On one particular day, he announced with great patriotism, \"The cake is a lie!  The cake is a lie!\"  This was obviously a blatant allusion to which puzzle game he had played mere days before?", "correct": "Portal", "options": ["Chip's Challenge", "Peggle", "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortal.\n\n\tFirst released in 2007, \"Portal\" became a cult classic amongst platformer and puzzle players alike due to its tongue-in-cheek cuteness and its unique brand of portal-puzzle challenges.  Armed with nothing more than a gun that shoots portals, you need to escape the Aperture Science Laboratories, an immaculately-clean establishment with no signs of human life.  All along the way you're guided by a robotic being known solely as GLaDOS, who seems to have a murderous, yet charming disposition.  The game won tons of awards and was critically lauded.  A sequel was released in 2011.\r Without a doubt, Paul Revere and his American buddies chatted at great length about their faithful Weighted Companion Cubes, portal guns, and the implications \"Portal\" had on the \"Half-Life\" series as a whole after his warning announcement and the subsequent win against the British soldiers.  Then, the nation was formed.  And there was cake for all.  This is also why the C in Washington DC stands for 'Cake'.  It's Washington, District of Cake. \n"}, {"text": "In the 2500s (BC), the Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops) was immortalized in what was then known as the world's largest man-made structure.  After two decades of intense labour and construction, they finished it and named it the Great Pyramid of Charmander, clearly an homage to the great ruler's fascination with what type of Pokemon?", "correct": "Fire", "options": ["Water", "Rock", "Electric"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFire.\n\n\tBeginning with \"Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow\", perhaps one of Nintendo's best franchises started with one hundred fifty collectible Pokemon and expanded shortly thereafter.  After perfect marketing with a TV show, trading cards, and other merchandise, \"Pokemon\" was a smash hit with video game players.  Charmander in particular was one of the games' first starting Pokemon and he had the power of fire at his disposal.  He evolved into Charmeleon, then Charizard.\r This magnificent structure still stands to this day, towering over all else atop the Giza Plateau.  Millions visit this world wonder every single year; it's a testament to the sheer staying power and popularity of \"Pokemon\" since its inception in the times before civilization expanded beyond the sands of Egypt. \n"}, {"text": "Landing on the moon in 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped out of the lunar module Eagle and walked on the surface of Earth's satellite.  In a moment of triumph, he is reported to have said \"One small step for man, now let's get back to Earth.  I have a raid tonight and my guild will kick me if I don't log on as a shaman.\"  Armstrong was no doubt worried about his reputation on what famous Blizzard MMORPG?", "correct": "World of Warcraft", "options": ["Starcraft II", "Guild Wars", "City of Heroes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld of Warcraft.\n\n\tAn MMORPG based on Blizzard's earlier famous franchise, \"Warcraft\", \"World of Warcraft\" was released and quickly expanded to become one of the most well-known titles in PC gaming history.  Players choose either Alliance or Horde and embark on a journey to become...well...whatever they want.  There are so many facets of gameplay that the possibilities are endless.  You can raid, quest, chat, travel, buy, sell, or collect (and more) and the game will never really end.  Several expansions have been released for the game and it's gone on to be one of the highest-grossing titles in history.\r While many contest the notion that man has walked on the moon, one thing is for certain, \"World of Warcraft\" soon became the most popular online multiplayer game.  Armstrong's iconic line is no doubt the catalyst for its immense popularity.  Soon after, the United Nations attempted to rename the moon 'Orgrimmar', but it didn't receive enough votes and the idea was shelved. \n"}, {"text": "In April 1912, the the 'unsinkable' ocean liner, Titanic, crashed into an iceberg on its maiden voyage in the Atlantic Ocean.  One survivor claimed that the responsibility of the crash laid in the hands of a hare named Peppy who suggested that the captain \"do a barrel roll\".  This approach had more positive results in which video game?", "correct": "Star Fox 64", "options": ["The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time", "Minesweeper", "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Fox 64.\n\n\tReleased as a sequel to the SNES version of \"Star Fox\", \"Star Fox 64\" was an early title on the Nintendo 64 console and perhaps one of the most popular games to be released on the system.  A combat flight sim set in space and starring animals in the lead roles, \"Star Fox 64\" was a clear indication of the new wave of gaming in the third dimension.  Starring Star Fox (Fox McCloud), Peppy the Hare, Slippy the Toad, and Falco Lombari, the game featured many levels to master and complete before facing off with the evil Andross.\r Although this claim that a barrel roll was unsuccessfully performed has never been confirmed, modern science indicates that this is, in fact, the truth behind the dreadful iceberg collision which occurred in the middle of the night.  The line \"Do a barrel roll\" was said by seven different characters in the James Cameron film \"Titanic\" to allude to the true events, but the ending was changed.  This had little impact on the overall storytelling- the film was still one of the highest-grossing feature films ever made. \n"}, {"text": "In the fifth century BC, the Chinese began the construction of a rather significant structure later known as 'The Great Wall'.  Although its origins are hazy, many cite a fear of repeated invasions of The Flood as a reason for its building across the country.  This phobia of The Flood was perpetuated by the events of which futuristic video game?", "correct": "Halo", "options": ["MadWorld", "Gears of War", "Dead Space"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalo.\n\n\t\"Halo\", created by Bungie Studios for play on the Xbox, became one of Microsoft's most valuable franchises after rave reviews and an enormous amount of sales.  After a few successful installments, the \"Halo\" series became one of the most-played online console games.  Since its inception in the collections of millions of gamers, the series has introduced several first-person shooters and real-time strategy titles.\r The wall still stands today, and while The Flood has yet to cross this immense structure cutting through the Chinese country, there is still the fear that one day they will invade.  Until then, China continues to build Battle Rifles, Needlers, and Plasma Grenades while perpetuating peace talks with Covenant forces. \n"}, {"text": "In 1996, Scottish scientists clone the first mammal, a sheep later named Dolly (after Dolly Parton).  Two years later, they one-upped themselves by announcing their involvement in an effort to clone a purple dragon and his dragonfly companion.  They were successful.  They got the idea from what series of games originally released on the PlayStation?", "correct": "Spyro", "options": ["Jak and Daxter", "Crash Bandicoot", "Ratchet and Clank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpyro.\n\n\t\"Spyro the Dragon\", the first entry in the series, was released solely under the PlayStation name but the games have spread to a number of consoles over the years.  The games star Spyro, a small purple dragon, as he and his dragonfly friend, Sparx, save the world in platforming stages.  In the past, Spyro has been voiced by Elijah Wood.  The creators of the series, Insomniac Games, later created the \"Ratchet and Clank\" and 'Resistance\" series of games for Sony systems.\r Why are there no purple dragons flying around Scotland you ask?  Well, after the first dragon was created, it lived in a cold cellar in the moors of Scotland for three years before people lost track of its whereabouts.  Many hypothesize that it's being held by the government as a 'Plan B' for use during wartime (if it ever comes to that).  It's certainly a step up from a sheep. \n"}, {"text": "In 1929, the ball was dropped and Black Tuesday marked the start of the Great Depression.  Although many blamed the instability of the stock market during a time of high spending, historians have pinpointed that the ultimate cause was a month-long \"Pac-Man\" tournament which distracted most of Wall Street.  It turned out that most of the participants were spending time getting eaten by which of these types of foes?", "correct": "Ghosts", "options": ["Tetrads", "Zombies", "Pikmin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGhosts.\n\n\t\"Pac-Man\", created by Namco, is perhaps one of the most celebrated arcade games of all time.  Remade countless times (and featuring many spin-offs such as \"Ms. Pac-Man\"), the series follows a small, yellow ball known as Pac-Man as he tries to chomp little dots on the screen and evade a quartet of ghosts known as Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde.  If Pac-Man eats a Power Pellet, he can eat the ghosts.  Each level ends when no more dots remain on-screen.  It's easy to see why it's an addictive game.\r While video games aren't always on history's bad side, \"Pac-Man\" was blamed for most financial woes in the 1930s.  Aside from all the money lost in the stock market, imagine the quarters spent on this month-long marathon!  It wasn't until World War II and the advent of home consoles that the economy (and gaming) got back on its feet.  Phew. \n"}]}
