If the Borg cube in TNG ep 'The Best of Both Worlds' did assimilate humans from the ships it fought at Wolf 359, then how did Riley get back to the Delta Quadrant? The cube was destroyed when it was in Earth orbit, so none of its crew - original or recently assimilated - could've survived and returned to the Delta Quadrant. \n"}, {"text": "TNG: After individualizing the Borg 'Hugh' (aka 3 of 5), he's returned to the planet where he'd crashed to be rescued by other Borg.
