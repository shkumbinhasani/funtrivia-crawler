{"id": "267607", "name": "\"Sly 3\" - \"A Cold Alliance\" (PS2) Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Sly Cooper Games", "Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves"], "questions": [{"text": "In the very beginning of the level, you first use Penelope.  How many logs does she have to split for Sly to get across?", "correct": "Seven", "options": ["Eight", "Six", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven.\n\n\tShe must split all seven logs from on the ice for Sly to get across.  She has a crush on Sly, so she likes seeing him pull off those acrobatic moves. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a form the guru takes on to hide in this level?", "correct": "Lantern", "options": ["Tree", "Pile of sticks", "Rockets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLantern.\n\n\tInterestingly enough, he turns into sticks, just like in the other levels, some rockets, and even a tree, but he never turns into a lantern.  You play guru only once, before you become friends with the Panda King. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Panda King's daughter?", "correct": "Jing King", "options": ["Jin King", "Jinn King", "Jynn King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJing King.\n\n\tJing King is being held captive by General Tsao for a forced wedding.  Tsao thinks that their offspring, with the power of King and name of Tsao, he will be unbeatable.  You are never able to see Jing King's face in this level, or any level for that matter. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a type of Flame-Fu technique used in the flashback?", "correct": "Fists of Flame", "options": ["Booming Chop", "Firy Wheel", "Palms of Thunder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFists of Flame.\n\n\tThe Panda King throws fireballs at you while you try to near him.  Once you are in the same circle, he uses three tactics.  They are pretty easy to avoid, especially since you have probably had this fight before, from \"Sly 2: Band of Thieves\".  Fists of Flame is an extra you can purchase for Murray.  It can come in quite handy. \n"}, {"text": "How many spikes are on each of the pads?", "correct": "Nine", "options": ["Seven", "Eleven", "Thirteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine.\n\n\tEach pad has only nine spikes.  These pads automatically activate during certain parts of the game where you have to destroy them to move forward.  But you can also activate them yourself when a guard is above one to kill him by using buttons near the pad.  It can be quite helpful. \n"}, {"text": "How many statues can you break with the grapple-cam when you must get guards to sleep on pads to deactivate lasers?", "correct": "Seventeen", "options": ["Zero, you can't break them!", "Fifteen", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeventeen.\n\n\tThe grapple-cam can easily destroy statues, and it can even collect the coins from them!  Make sure, though, that you do not hit guards with it, because if you hit them too many times they will die. \n"}, {"text": "How many pots must Sly keep from breaking while Panda King and Guru try to rescue Jing King?", "correct": "Ten", "options": ["Nine", "Eight", "Twelve"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTen.\n\n\tEach pot will trip an alarm if broken, causing General Tsao to know what is going on.  You can get money from the pots, though, but only during the first time you go in the building. \n"}, {"text": "How many items must you use to get 'across the heavens'?", "correct": "Twenty-four", "options": ["Twenty-five", "Twenty", "Twenty-one"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwenty-four.\n\n\tFor the twenty-four items, there are guards.  They don't realize what is going on, but you can guess they are frightened!  You also climb bamboo, and land on carts and lanterns. \n"}, {"text": "How many spikes are on the back of the dragon you must fight in the end?", "correct": "Sixteen", "options": ["Twelve", "Fifteen", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSixteen.\n\n\tThese spikes are yellow.  You can spire jump on each of them, and that comes in handy while avoiding some of the dragon's attacks.  After you get the dragon a certain number of times, it tries to knock you off by rolling around and around.  Although you can avoid falling off by continuously jumping back onto him, he will keep spinning until you fall off, so don't try to fight him; it's a waste of your time. \n"}, {"text": "Which limb does the dragon hold Penelope in?", "correct": "Back Right", "options": ["Front Left", "Back Left", "Front Right"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBack Right.\n\n\tThe dragon is quite talented, because he holds her with his feet!  This also helps him out, because he then has the front limbs to try to smash you on his back.  Watch out for this attack by running back down his back while he tries to crush you, then go back to continuously smash his head until he is gone. \n"}]}
