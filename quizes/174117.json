{"id": "174117", "name": "Games in the Movies Quiz | Games in Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Games in Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "In the 1956 masterpiece 'The Seventh Seal', directed by Ingmar Bergman, a returned knight from the Crusades duels Death in which game?  ", "correct": "Chess", "options": ["Dice", "Backgammon", "Blackjack"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChess.\n\n\t'The Seventh Seal' is really one of the classic films of all time, perhaps Bergman's greatest work.  It features the acting Max von Sydow, who plays the returned knight, and Gunnar Bjornstrand, who plays the knight's squire.  The chess scene from the film has been borrowed, lampooned, and otherwise been paid general homage in a number of films and television shows since the release of the film. \n"}, {"text": "In the year 2000 a film came out that was based upon a popular fantasy/role playing game that reached its peak of popularity in the 1980s.  What is the title of both the fantasy film and the game upon which it is based?  ", "correct": "Dungeons & Dragons", "options": ["Warhammer", "Tunnels & Trolls", "RuneQuest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDungeons & Dragons.\n\n\tSadly enough, the film was a very poor adaptation of the game, despite featuring the excellent actor Jeremy Irons (what was he thinking?)  'Dungeons & Dragons' was the most popular of a number of role-playing games (RPGs) that became popular in the 1980s.  The popularity of these games, and the fantasy content, prompted many rather paranoid folks to imagine that the game was somehow attached to Satanism. \n"}, {"text": "Which card game is the focus of attention in the 1998 film 'Rounders', starring Matt Damon and Ed Norton?  ", "correct": "Poker", "options": ["Blackjack", "Baccarat", "Bridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoker.\n\n\t'Rounders' is a film about the seedier side of life of a pair of young men who make their living playing poker. Aside from the two lead actors, the film includes great acting work from John Malkovich (Teddy KGB), John Turturro and Martin Landau. World Series of Poker player Johnny Chan is also briefly featured in the film. \n"}, {"text": "I wasn't a huge fan of the 1991 film 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey', a follow up of the more amusing 1989 comedy 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', but I did enjoy a few of its scenes.  One scene included a battle between Death and the title pair in all but which of these games?  ", "correct": "Tiddlywinks", "options": ["Clue", "Battleship", "Twister"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTiddlywinks.\n\n\tIn one of the more hilarious spoofs of Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal', Bill and Ted take on the Grim Reaper in several contests, winning them successively (also included: electronic football). The frustrated Grim Reaper incessantly insists on rematches, but is finally incapable of overcoming the awesome intellects of Bill and Ted. \n"}, {"text": "In which film of the 'James Bond' series do we see 007 in a duel against the chief villain in a strategic video game called 'Domination'?  ", "correct": "Never Say Never Again", "options": ["For Your Eyes Only", "Octopussy", "The Living Daylights"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNever Say Never Again.\n\n\tJames Bond, played for the last time by Sean Connery in 'Never Say Never Again', engages in a game of 'Domination' with the villain Largo (played by Klaus Maria Brandauer).  Bond loses the first game, which features electric shocks as punishment for bad moves, but eventually gains victory in the final game between himself and Largo. The film, which is essentially a remake of 'Thunderball', also features Kim Basinger, Max von Sydow and Barbara Carrera in a riotous, over-the-top performance as the wicked Fatima. \n"}, {"text": "Which film, starring Robin Williams, is entirely based on the unpredictable events leading from the playing of a board game?  \n", "correct": "Jumanji", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJumanji.\n\n\tThe movie 'Jumanji' is based on the award-winning children's book of the same title by Chris Van Allsburg.  Frankly, the book is better than the film, which also features the acting of Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Grier, among others. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1988 film 'Rain Man', starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise, the two main characters win a great deal of money playing blackjack in Vegas.  With what game is the Dustin Hoffman character Raymond less successful?  ", "correct": "Wheel of Fortune", "options": ["Craps", "Roulette", "Poker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWheel of Fortune.\n\n\tRaymond, along with his brother Charlie (played by Cruise), win big on a Vegas blackjack table thanks to Raymond's card counting abilities.  Unfortunately, Raymond is incapable of the same magic on a 'Wheel of Fortune' game.  He loses several thousand dollars by incorrectly guessing in which slot the wheel will stop. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1983 film 'War Games', starring Matthew Broderick, a computer program named Joshua that threatens global security by playing a 'game' called 'Global Thermal Nuclear War', is finally pacified by a computerized version of which simple game?  ", "correct": "Tic-tac-toe", "options": ["Rock-paper-scissors", "Go Fish", "Bingo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTic-tac-toe.\n\n\tAlly Sheedy and Dabney Coleman star alongside Broderick in this rather good sci-fi/adventure film that questions the viability of the global security system created by the nuclear umbrella.  Not quite at the level of 'Dr. Strangelove', 'War Games' certainly has its moments and is enjoyable to watch. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these 1980s sci-fi/action films features a young videogamer who suddenly finds himself in an outer space adventure, fighting for his life?  ", "correct": "The Last Starfighter", "options": ["D.A.R.Y.L.", "Enemy Mine", "Outland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Last Starfighter.\n\n\tThe apparent moral of the story behind 'The Last Starfighter' is that video games are good, and a video game obsession may very well be a healthy thing! Lance Guest stars in this 1984 film that featured a decent story which features all computerized effects (the first film with such a feature). \n"}, {"text": "In 1985 an entire mystery/comedy film was based around the various features of what very prominent and popular board game?  ", "correct": "Clue", "options": ["Mastermind", "Stratego", "Risk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClue.\n\n\tDirected by Jonathan Lynn, the film 'Clue' featured the acting work of Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Martin Mull, Michael McKean, Christopher Lloyd and Eileen Brennan.  The film could be labeled as camp, which therefore automatically establishes it as a cult film (don't camp and cult go hand in hand?)  Lee Ving, the former singer of the rock group Fear, plays Mr. Boddy, the murder victim.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try more of my quizzes. \n"}]}
