{"id": "333775", "name": "May the Kraft Be With You! Quiz | World | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", "Languages"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Luke, I am your Vader!\"\nWait a second...that doesn't seem right.  'Vader' means 'father' in which of these languages?", "correct": "Dutch", "options": ["Turkish", "Russian", "French"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDutch.\n\n\tMore than just coincidence, the name 'Darth Vader' from the \"Star Wars\" series translates to 'Darth Father' in English.  In \"The Empire Strikes Back\", viewers discovered that Darth Vader, or Anakin Skywalker, was Jedi-in-training Luke Skywalker's father all along.  The quote \"Luke, I am your father\" is one of the most famous lines in the series (and movies altogether).\r 'Pere', 'Oteh', and 'Baba' are French, Russian, and Turkish for 'father', respectively.  'Vader', the Dutch word for 'Father', is quite similar to the German word, 'Vater', and the Swedish word, 'Fader'. \n"}, {"text": "\"Aidez-moi Obi-Wan Kenobi!  You're my only hope.\"\nIt's unlikely that Leia released her SOS in French, but what does 'aidez-moi' mean?", "correct": "Help me", "options": ["Find me", "Save me", "Rescue me"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHelp me.\n\n\tIn the beginning of \"A New Hope\", Princess Leia Organa, later discovered to be Luke's sister and the daughter of the evil Darth Vader, sends a message along with droids R2-D2 and C-3PO asking one of the remaining Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to save her from the Sith.  The droids find Kenobi on the planet of Tatooine (along with Luke).  Luckily for Kenobi, the message was not in French.\r While 'aidez-moi' means help me or assist me in French, 'trouvez-moi' means find me, 'sauvez-moi' means rescue me and save me. \n"}, {"text": "\"I've got a very mau feeling about this!\"\nMany characters say something like this throughout the films and seem a bit apprehensive at times, but in what language does 'mau' mean bad?", "correct": "Portuguese", "options": ["Italian", "Japanese", "Indonesian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortuguese.\n\n\t\"I've got a very bad feeling about this\" seems to appear in almost every \"Star Wars\" movie.  Whether the gang approaches the Death Star in \"A New Hope\", they fall into the garbage disposal in the same film, or they land on an asteroid in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", the line seems to recur.  Han Solo also says the line in \"The Return of the Jedi\" before being cooked alive by the Ewoks.\r In Portugal, bad would be 'mau' while good would be 'bom'.  'Warui' is the Japanese term for bad, 'buruk' is the Indonesian term, and 'cattivo' is Italian. \n"}, {"text": "\"Your powers are slaby, old man.\"\nDarth Vader says this to Obi-Wan during battle, but 'slaby' means 'weak' in which European language?", "correct": "Czech", "options": ["Danish", "Greek", "Finnish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCzech.\n\n\tDarth Vader, in one of the climactic battles of \"A New Hope\", states this to his once-mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi during a lightsaber duel to which Kenobi replies, \"You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.\"  Although Kenobi would be killed, his wisdom would live on in his young padawan, Luke, and through his spiritual guidance.  Kenobi, of course, trained young Anakin Skywalker from a young age before his mind was corrupted by the Dark Side and he became the menacing Darth Vader.\r While 'slaby' is the Czech word for 'weak', 'silny' is their word for 'strong'.  Denmark's citizens would use the word 'svag' to describe weakness, the Greeks would say 'adynatos', and the Finnish would use the word 'heikko'.  Similarly, Croatians would use the word 'slab' to say 'weak'. \n"}, {"text": "\"Osore is the path to the Dark Side.  Osore leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.\"\nWhile Yoda deduces this simply, it's safe to say he never uses the Japanese word 'osore' which translates into what English word?", "correct": "Fear", "options": ["Love", "Tragedy", "Death"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFear.\n\n\tThis line is uttered by Yoda in the first \"Star Wars\" prequel, \"The Phantom Menace\", in regard to a young Anakin Skywalker.  Yoda's foresight is proven true as Anakin's fears and anger lead to his betrayal of the Jedi forces and his descent into evil on the Dark Side.\r 'Osore' is the Japanese word for 'fear'.  Most notably, in the northern stretch of the island of Honshu rests Mount Osore (Mount Fear) in Aomori Prefecture.  This mountain is home to a number of different Japanese legends, most notably that this physical feature of the island is a gateway to the underworld and the river of the afterlife.  'Higeki' is the Japanese word for 'tragedy', 'ai' is one of many words for 'love', and 'shi' is one word (of many) for 'death'. \n"}, {"text": "\"It's a trappola!\"\nThis line by Admiral Ackbar in \"Return of the Jedi\" states the obvious, but in what language does 'trappola' mean 'trap'?", "correct": "Italian", "options": ["Swahili", "Spanish", "Norwegian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItalian.\n\n\tThis line appears when the Rebels plan to attack the unfinished, second Death Star only to discover (much to Ackbar's dismay, of course) that they are being taken into an ambush attack.  Ackbar does not appear in any other films in the series, and the line has become a notorious internet meme.\r Quite simply, the Italian word for 'trap' is 'trappola' while in Spanish one would say 'trampa'.  The Swahili term is 'kutega' while Norway's citizens would use the word 'fange'. \n"}, {"text": "\"Hacer.  O no.  There is no try.\"\nMore words of wisdom come from Yoda, but 'Hacer. O no' translates to 'Do. Or do not' in which language?", "correct": "Spanish", "options": ["Malay", "German", "French"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpanish.\n\n\t\"Do.  Or do not.  There is no try.\"  This line is another Yodaism, this time from one of Luke's training sessions from \"The Empire Strikes Back\".  Later on in the same film, Yoda also claims that \"there is no 'why'.\"  Nice of him to make sense of things.  Luke later comes to realize the ways of the Jedi to fight Darth Vader himself.\r 'Hacer' is the Spanish verb for 'to do' or 'to make', just as 'faire' is 'to do' or 'to make' in French.  Malay is a bit more complicated; 'Do not!' is 'Jangan', but 'bukan' is also 'do not' in some contexts.  In Germany, 'tun' is the verb for 'to do'. \n"}, {"text": "\"Aren't you a little kort for a stormtrooper?\"\n\nIf the word 'kort' is Danish, what does it mean in this Princess Leia quote?", "correct": "Short", "options": ["Nice", "Tall", "Fat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShort.\n\n\tOriginally from \"A New Hope\", Princess Leia Organa asks this question to a costumed Luke Skywalker when he, Han Solo, and Chewbacca break her free from her jail cell aboard Darth Vader's Death Star.  In all actuality, Luke Skywalker isn't shorter than most Stormtroopers.\r While 'kort' would mean 'short' for anyone living in Denmark, citizens would use the words 'hoj' for 'tall', 'fed' for 'fat', and 'behagelig' for 'nice' or 'pleasant'. \n"}, {"text": "\"R2-D2, you know better than to trust a strange tolva!\"\n\nC-3P0 certainly wasn't Icelandic, but what English word would he have used in place of 'tolva'?", "correct": "Computer", "options": ["Thing", "Thought", "Human"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComputer.\n\n\tSaid by C-3P0 to robot buddy R2-D2, this quote was heard in \"The Empire Strikes Back\".  As usual, C-3P0 is hesitant about R2's typical extroverted self in this instance.  After hearing information from a city supercomputer, C-3P0 is less-than-willing to accept the machine's word.  R2 has a penchant for getting the proper info throughout the series, and both characters have appeared in all six films.\r In Icelandic, 'tolva' is a computer while 'tolvur' refers to more than one computer.  'Hlutur' is the word for 'thing', 'aoili' is 'person', and 'hugsun' is 'thought'. \n"}, {"text": "\"A long tempus ago in a galaxy far, far away...\"\n\nAlthough this isn't exactly how the first line of every \"Star Wars\" film is read, 'tempus' is 'time' in which language?", "correct": "Latin", "options": ["Swahili", "Norwegian", "Dutch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLatin.\n\n\t\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...\" is the line which comes before the title card in every one of the six \"Star Wars\" films and it's one of the most famous opening lines in cinematic history.  Although the time of the films, in relation to our galaxy's time, is not known, the series (in all forms of media) has a long-running timeline of events spread across several planets in the system.\r The Norwegian word for 'time' is 'tid' (the same as in Swedish and Danish), in Swahili you would use 'wakati', and in Dutch you would say 'tijd'.\rMuch like Latin, the French word for 'time' is 'temps', and the Italian word is 'tempo'. \n"}]}
