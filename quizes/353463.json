It is so cool and refreshing; but there is also that little warm something on the sandwich that adds a nice contrast. Which BLT ingredient is usually served warm, while the other parts are served cold?", "correct": "The B", "options": ["The T", "The L", "The A"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe B.\n\n\tI love the bacon, hot and greasy on a nice toasted piece of bread, sitting upon a large piece of cool, crisp lettuce, and with cold, fresh tomato... The sandwich cannot be beat. Unless of course, you add avocado, which turns the BLT into a BLAT. \n"}, {"text": "After enjoying some roasted weenies on an open fire, I like to have a cold dessert roasted on the fire. Which dessert, which often has a graham cracker crust, can be put on a stick and roasted on a fire?", "correct": "Cheesecake", "options": ["Pound cake", "Devil's food cake", "Fruitcake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheesecake.\n\n\tCheesecake comes in many varieties, but for this hot and cold dessert, plain New York style works the best. First, freeze cubes of cheesecake (you can cut your own cubes, but pre-cubed can be purchased and is infinitely easier). Make sure you freeze them well, so they won't fall apart. Put them on sticks, just as you would do with a marshmallow to makes s'mores.You can even place the sticks before freezing to make it easier. The final step is roasting; do not keep the cheesecake over the flame for too long, or you will lose your dessert to the fire. If done correctly, you will have a square of hot and gooey and smoky cheesecake with a cool, creamy center.Delicious! \n"}, {"text": "Cereal and milk go together like bacon and eggs.  But hot cereals and other breakfast foods are great with cold milk poured over it.  Which of these is not a hot cereal made from oats?", "correct": "Grits", "options": ["Oatmeal", "Groats", "Porridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrits.\n\n\tWhile grits are also served hot, it is mainly made from ground corn, while the others are all made from oats (some processed, some not).  These cereals are typically thick and mushy, and some like adding cold milk to make it creamier and add a cool aspect to an otherwise hot meal. \n"}, {"text": "Baked Alaska is a delicious dessert with ice cream that is baked in the oven, and yet remains cold and delightful in the middle.  What is put on the outside that insulates the ice cream through the cooking process?", "correct": "Meringue", "options": ["Corn Flakes", "Whipped Cream", "Dry Ice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeringue.\n\n\tBaked Alaska is made with ice cream covered in meringue.  The dish is baked at very high temperatures for a very brief time.  The meringue protects the ice cream from melting during the baking process, but the baking firms the meringue and gives it a golden brown coating.  Biting into that warm meringue with a cold bit of ice cream; there is no way to describe that delectable sensation.\r Corn flakes are sometimes used for fried ice cream, another hot and cold ice cream dessert.  The corn flakes coat the ice cream, and it is placed in the deep fryer for a very short time.  Also delicious. \n"}, {"text": "Mint jelly can be very delicious, and the cold gelatin can be put on a roast meat for some very interesting flavors.  Which meat is often paired with cool mint jelly?", "correct": "Lamb", "options": ["Buffalo", "Duck", "Ostrich"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLamb.\n\n\tMint jelly is often used as a condiment, commonly served with many different lamb dishes.  Cold mint jelly placed on a hot slice of roast lamb gives a wonderful sensation of tender meat with cool and refreshing mint.  Mint jelly is also often used in other ways, but paired with roast lamb is perhaps the most well known preparation. \n"}, {"text": "To make custard, you have to heat it, but then you chill it.  For a certain custard dish, once it is nice and cold, you can put a layer of sugar (sometimes flavored sugars) over the top and pull out a blow torch.  Heating the sugar on top gives it a nice crunchy contrast.  Breaking into the warm, caramel shell and scooping a bit of the cool, creamy custard is quite a delight.  But what is it called?", "correct": "Creme Brulee", "options": ["Flan", "Frozen Custard Milkshake", "Souffle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreme Brulee.\n\n\tCreme brulee, also known as Trinity cream or burnt cream, is a delicious custard dessert with crunchy caramel topping.  The dessert is first made with a custard that is chilled, and then covered in a layer of sugar (I like raspberry flavored sugar best, myself).  The sugar is toasted to a golden-brown perfection, giving the layer a warm caramel flavor.  It may be insanely sweet, but it so delicious it really doesn't matter. \n"}, {"text": "Condiments always add a nice flavor to any dish, and sometimes adds a contrasting temperature as well.  Adding guacamole on top of warm food, for instance, can give that \"cold-and-hot\" sensation that I often desire.\n\nWhich of these is NOT typically an ingredient in traditional guacamole?", "correct": "Mayonnaise", "options": ["Lemon Juice", "Tomato", "Cilantro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMayonnaise.\n\n\tJust about any Mexican dish can be served with guacamole for added flavor and for the varying temperatures that I so desperately seek.  Guacamole can be dolloped on top of so many foods; tacos, burritos, nachos, and the like.  A nice, hot burrito with a cool glob of guac (as it is sometimes referred to) can be delicious.\r While some recipes to include mayonnaise in the guacamole, this is not a traditional ingredient, and some people frown upon adding mayo to make it \"creamier\". \n"}, {"text": "Ice cream is a wonderful treat, especially in the summertime.  However, some people like to put a hot liquid over the top for extra deliciousness.\n\nWhich of these ice cream toppings is typically NOT served hot?\n\nNote: all of these can be served cold, but all but one can also be served hot.", "correct": "Magic Shell", "options": ["Caramel", "Hot fudge", "Marshmallow cream"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagic Shell.\n\n\tMany people like a nice bowl of ice cream with some hot toppings, including hot fudge, caramel sauce, and marshmallow cream.  Magic Shell, however, is not typically served hot.  The chocolate sauce becomes hard upon hitting the cold ice cream, and, if poured on hot, it certainly won't stay hot for long!\r Be careful, though; you cannot refrigerate Magic Shell; if you do, it will harden in the bottle and not even microwaving it can revert it back to liquid. \n"}, {"text": "Nothing says a cold-and-hot food has to be temperature.  For a deliciously minty hot beverage, you can always brush your teeth with strong mint toothpaste, and drink a tasty warm drink.  The result is a minty version of the drink; which is quite delicious and hot, yet cool and refreshing.  Which of these drinks would give you the best result of this if sipped hot?", "correct": "Cocoa", "options": ["Margarita", "Water", "Orange Juice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCocoa.\n\n\tDrinking hot chocolate is always delicious (well, if you like chocolate, anyway), but having a mug of mint hot cocoa is even better.  If no mint is on hand, however, there is no need to feel down.  Just brush your teeth with the strongest mint toothpaste you can find, and then drink the hot cocoa.  It's an odd sensation, as the hot liquid is cool going down your throat, and quite delicious.  Go on, try it; you know you want to. \n"}, {"text": "Alternatively, cold foods are not always sweet; sometimes they have quite a hot kick to them!  For instance, this cold Spanish soup made from tomato can be quite refreshing, but it can also have a spicy aspect to them.  Adding jalapenos, including the seeds, to the mix can give the cool soup a bite to it.  Which soup?", "correct": "Gazpacho", "options": ["Vichyssoise", "Borscht", "Minestrone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGazpacho.\n\n\tGazpacho is a cool soup from the Andalucia region of Spain.  The soup is made from pureed tomatoes, cucumber, celery, and other various ingredients (such as bread).  Most often, the vegetables are not even cooked.  Quite a number of ingredients can be used, and sometimes tomato is not even used.  While the recipe varies greatly depending on who makes it, one common aspect remains the same; it is a cold soup dish. \n"}]}
