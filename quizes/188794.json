{"id": "188794", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'War of Nerves' Online Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 6 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "Typically, Sidney Freedman arrives at the M*A*S*H 4077th of his own free will.  This time, however, he arrives as a patient.  Where has Sidney been wounded?", "correct": "Head", "options": ["Leg", "Arm", "Abdomen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHead.\n\n\tIt looks like Major Freedman has taken a 'friendly' shell fragment in the head.  He was giving therapy to a young soldier in a foxhole when the Chinese made a surprise sudden offensive.  Luckily, Sidney is perfectly able to sit up by himself and communicate comfortably with Hawkeye.  His wound is superficial. \n"}, {"text": "In the O.R., the surgeons at the 4077th are busy patching up a number of wounded while Sidney Freedman looks on.  He is able to witness a very unusual exchange between Margaret and Charles, in which the former accuses the latter of touching what part of his face?", "correct": "Nose", "options": ["Ear", "Mouth", "Eye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNose.\n\n\tMargaret insists that Charles step out of the O.R. and go scrub up, a suggestion which our favorite pompous doctor finds absurd.  Charles insists that he did not touch his nose, asking Margaret, 'Major, do you think my face is insensate?'  Eventually, Margaret wins the battle and Charles is forced to leave the operating table to decontaminate his hands.  The viewer is not made aware if Charles indeed touched his nose...it's all hearsay. \n"}, {"text": "Following another seemingly endless O.R. session, our friends at the 4077th settle down into the mess tent for a brief repast.  Unfortunately, the tensions of the operating room have accompanied them to their dining facilities.  Margaret and Charles continue to bicker, and we witness Hawkeye and BJ argue over a seemingly ridiculous topic.  What is it that Hawkeye does that drives BJ to distraction?", "correct": "He insists that BJ smell his food", "options": ["He unceasingly shakes salt on his food", "He talks continuously of his dirty clothes", "He incessantly complains about the temperature of the coffee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe insists that BJ smell his food.\n\n\tTrue fans of 'M*A*S*H' know that one of Hawkeye's greatest and most peculiar idiosyncrasies is his tendency to sniff his food.  Normally, BJ takes no notice, but when Hawkeye starts foisting his peccadillos on BJ, the latter cannot help but take notice.  \r Hawkeye insists that BJ smell some limp, yellow thing on his fork.  BJ finally gives in, and Hawkeye helps his imagination along by describing the smell: 'If you took a raw egg ('A brown egg!') and buried it in a shoe under a chicken coop.' \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter discreetly pulls Sidney Freedman aside in order to discuss with the psychiatrist the problems he is witnessing with his subordinates at the 4077th.  The Colonel requests that Sidney see some of the 'loonier' while he is at the camp.  Which of the loonies does Sidney first visit with?", "correct": "Margaret", "options": ["Charles", "BJ", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret.\n\n\tMargaret comes to Sidney's tent first, apparently of her own free will.  She discusses the incident in the O.R. with Charles' nose, and continues on about other things, among them how she is *not* infatuated with Charles.  \r Another of Margaret's pet peeves regarding Charles is his enormous wealth.  She peevishly describes his 'laundered hankies' and 'monogrammed caviar'.  Margaret insists that she does not find money attractive.  'Money is far down my list, Major.' She says, and continues, 'Money comes second, maybe even third.'  After making this comment she thinks for a few seconds, and finally suggests, 'Second.' \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the 4077th, while visiting with Sidney, suggests that he 'had his fill of psychiatrists when [he] was nine'?", "correct": "Charles", "options": ["BJ", "Hawkeye", "Klinger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles.\n\n\tCharles is the second M*A*S*H dweller to visit with Sidney, arriving just as Margaret is concluding her thoughts.  An excerpt of Charles' comments:\r 'Look, the point is, she (Margaret) is the one who is obsessed.  She watches my every movement.  My body seems to be of intense interest to her.  In other words, the woman is crazy about me, huh?'  \r Charles seemingly is attempting to diagnose Margaret without Sidney's help, all to the latter's amusement.  Sidney doesn't really have to say a thing! \n"}, {"text": "During Klinger's visit to Sidney Freedman we learn that our favorite cross-dressing corporal is worried that he may truly be going bonkers.  Klinger emphasizes his concern by describing his reaction to a picture of a beautiful woman he recently saw.  Rather than notice the lovely lady in the picture, what question did Klinger ask about her?", "correct": "How could she wear a peasant blouse with a tweed skirt?", "options": ["Where does she find those lovely pearl earrings?", "How does she get into those black pumps?", "Where could I get a pink sash like that?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHow could she wear a peasant blouse with a tweed skirt?.\n\n\tEarlier in the episode, Klinger appears dressed as a little girl, complete with Radar's teddy bear.  During his visit with Sidney he wears more reserved clothing, that of a much more mature woman.  Sidney responds to Klinger's concern by suggesting, 'Look, you're in the crazy business.  Fashion consciousness is just a tool of the trade.'  Klinger responds, 'Doc, I go to sleep wondering if my pleats will hold out another day.  My palms got sweaty last week when I read that cocktail-length hems are going longer in the back, and I just don't have the material.'\r Sidney asks Klinger why he doesn't want to be in Korea, and Klinger's response is essentially that he doesn't like death.  This proves Sidney's point that Klinger is definitely *not* crazy. \n"}, {"text": "In keeping with the camp madness theme, Zale and Igor are assigned to burn some items that are infested, but proceed instead to build a large bonfire.  Soon, it seems, the entire camp is participating in its assembling.  What items were they originally intending to burn?", "correct": "Chinese uniforms", "options": ["Old army rations", "Used medical supplies", "Carcasses of rats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChinese uniforms.\n\n\tA number of Chinese soldiers have rotated through the 4077th and their lice-infested uniforms have to be burned.  Zale and Igor begin with the small pile of uniforms, but soon decide this will not be enough for a 'nice fire'.  They add crates and a bench.  A couple of scenes later we see that the nice little fire has turned into a campwide celebration as members of the unit bring everything but the kitchen sink to burn.  Colonel Potter initially wants to put a stop to this unwarranted activity, but Sidney convinces him that it might be good for morale. \n"}, {"text": "Radar has apparently caught the camp 'madness'.  When it's his turn to chat with Sidney he admits that he, too, might be losing his marbles.  What 'problem' does Radar discuss with Sidney?", "correct": "His sleeping with a teddy bear", "options": ["His continued reading of comic books", "His compulsive desire for organization", "His obsession with Nurse Abel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis sleeping with a teddy bear.\n\n\tRadar is worried because, earlier in the episode, Sidney joked that Klinger was crazy for holding Radar's teddy bear.  Sidney insists that Radar's continued ownership of a teddy bear is perfectly normal.  Interestingly, Sidney has a premonition that, when Radar goes back home, he won't need his teddy bear anymore.  When Radar leaves the show after year eight, he indeed leaves his teddy bear behind. \n"}, {"text": "While Sidney is able to help some of the regulars of the 4077th with their mental health, he has his own challenges.  In particular, a young, injured soldier named Tom, one of Sidney's patients, has been a very difficult case.  Which 'M*A*S*H' regular plays the 'therapist' role and consoles Sidney?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Colonel Potter", "Margaret", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tTom is a young soldier (played by Michael O'Keefe) who had previously treated and sent back to the war front.  After suffering from injuries to his leg, Tom is very resentful of Dr. Freedman and let's him know his feelings twice during the episode.  \r Later, in his tent, we see Sidney sitting pensively by himself.  Father Mulcahy pays Sidney a visit and attempts to raise Sidney's spirit.  Sidney complains that when Hawkeye or BJ lose a patient, the young man is put out of his misery, but when he loses one of his own patients he loses a mind.  Father Mulcahy sympathizes, suggesting that when he loses a 'patient' he loses a soul. \n"}, {"text": "The episode ends with a camp bonfire, with all residents of the 4077th present.  What song do they sing while watching the flames engulf most of the wooden objects from the camp?", "correct": "Keep the Homefires Burning", "options": ["My Old Kentucky Home", "When Johnny Comes Marching Home", "Molly Malone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeep the Homefires Burning.\n\n\tAll are present as the fire builds momentum, thanks to the fact that practically everything wooden from the 4077th has been added for fuel.  \r The scene shifts to Major Winchester, who perversely admires the fire.  Hawkeye and BJ toss a cot into the conflagration as Charles looks on with a vague curiosity.  'A cot,' Charles utters, 'How can you do that?'  BJ responds, 'It's just an object.  It has no intrinsic value.  It's just a thing.'  Hawkeye adds, 'Besides, it's yours!'\r Other contributions to the fire: Sidney's jacket and pants, Colonel Potter's desk, Radar's bugle and the army cookbook.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and kept your sanity.  If you did, please feel free to try some of my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
