{"id": "121934", "name": "Basic Retriever Field Training Quiz | Animals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "Dog Breeds", "Retrievers"], "questions": [{"text": "At what age does retriever field training usually commence?", "correct": "As soon as you get your puppy (and maybe earlier!)", "options": ["As soon as the puppy is finished teething", "Six months", "One year"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs soon as you get your puppy (and maybe earlier!).\n\n\tA well-bred retriever puppy will fetch and carry things as soon as he can walk. Seven or eight-week old puppies can do very short retrieves with appropriately-sized bumpers. They can also start learning basic obedience. \n"}, {"text": "During training, retrievers usually fetch cylinders made of canvas or rubber. What are these called?", "correct": "Bumpers or dummies", "options": ["Retrievers or fetchers", "Decoys or dekes", "Tubes or gear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBumpers or dummies.\n\n\tRetrievers are never supposed to retrieve decoys- those are the fake ducks! Bumpers come in many sizes and colors, from tiny puppy dummies to goose-sized. \n"}, {"text": "What is the process called by which a retriever sees something land on the ground and remembers where it fell?", "correct": "Marking", "options": ["Sighting", "Spotting", "Fixing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarking.\n\n\tA well-trained retriever can mark the fall of a bird  150-200 yards away, and remember 4 or 5 such falls! \n"}, {"text": "Retrievers can be trained to be guided, through whistles and hand signals, to objects that they did not see fall. What are such retrieves called?", "correct": "Blind retrieves", "options": ["Directed retrieves", "Guided retrieves", "Assisted retrieves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlind retrieves.\n\n\tThey are \"blind\" because the retriever did not see the bird fall. Only the handler knows where it is. \n"}, {"text": "Whistles are used to give directions to distant retrievers, who are too far away to hear your voice clearly. What are retrievers trained to do on one blast of the whistle?", "correct": "Sit", "options": ["Down", "Come", "Fetch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSit.\n\n\tThey sit, looking at the handler, awaiting further instructions. \n"}, {"text": "What are retrievers trained to do on a trill of the whistle?", "correct": "Come", "options": ["Down", "Sit", "Fetch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCome.\n\n\tThis is usually after they have made the retrieve. \n"}, {"text": "Retrievers must be able to find what they are sent for, even if it fell in heavy brush. What is this brush known as to a retriever trainer?", "correct": "Cover", "options": ["Planting", "Bush", "Vegetation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCover.\n\n\tObviously, heavy cover makes marking more difficult. Retrievers are also not highly sensitive to pain- if they were, they would never crash through briars and brambles! \n"}, {"text": "Many retriever breed clubs in the U.S. offer tests to see if retrievers know the basics of fieldwork. What are these tests called?", "correct": "Working certificate tests", "options": ["Retrieving instinct tests", "Field ability tests", "Hunting retriever tests"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorking certificate tests.\n\n\tWorking certificate (WC) tests vary by breed, but in a typical test, the dog will retrieve a double (two birds) in moderate cover on land, and one in light cover in the water. \n"}, {"text": "In the U.S., the American Kennel Club offers three levels of retriever tests. What are these?", "correct": "Junior, Senior and Master Hunter", "options": ["Started, Intermediate and Finished Retriever", "Novice, Open and Utility", "Standard, Advanced and Excellent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJunior, Senior and Master Hunter.\n\n\tThe JH is a fairly simple test similar to a WC. The Senior Hunter is more difficult and includes a blind retrieve on land. The Master Hunter is only for the most well-trained dogs, and contains difficult marking and retrieving setups. \n"}, {"text": "In the United States, what breed takes home the most prizes at field trials?", "correct": "Labrador retriever", "options": ["Flat-coated retriever", "Golden retriever", "Chesapeake Bay retriever"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLabrador retriever.\n\n\tUnlike WCs and AKC Hunt Tests, where every dog that passes qualifies, field trials are competitive. They feature extremely long marks of up to 4 birds at once, difficult blind retrieves, and many other challenges. \n"}]}
