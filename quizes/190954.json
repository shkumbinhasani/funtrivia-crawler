{"id": "190954", "name": "The Film History of Terry Gilliam Online Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed E-K", " Terry Gilliam"], "questions": [{"text": "One of Terry Gilliam's first directing credits, and indeed his first effort with a full-length feature film, just happens to be as co-director for the classic 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.  With which other Monty Python member did Gilliam co-direct?", "correct": "Terry Jones", "options": ["Eric Idle", "Michael Palin", "Graham Chapman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerry Jones.\n\n\tNot only did we catch first sight of Terry Gilliam as brilliant film director for 'Holy Grail', but Mr. Gilliam showed us he can act as well.  Gilliam played the distinguished parts of Patsy, the Green Knight, the Bridgekeeper, Sir Bors and the Animator for the film. \n"}, {"text": "In 1977, Terry Gilliam embarked on another project that was just as 'medievalesque' as the 'Holy Grail'.  After which creature invented by Lewis Carroll was this solo project named?", "correct": "Jabberwocky", "options": ["Bandersnatch", "Snark", "Cheshire Cat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJabberwocky.\n\n\tJabberwocky was a raw and unusual film that barely scraped the depths of Gilliam's talents.  It featured the acting of fellow Pythons Michael Palin (as Dennis Cooper) and Terry Jones (as the Poacher).  Terry Gilliam makes an appearance as 'Man with Rock'.  Check it out! \n"}, {"text": "Terry Gilliam really came into his own as a director with the 1981 classic 'Time Bandits'.  Featuring a marvelous cast, which included fellow Pythons Michael Palin and John Cleese, the film was co-produced by which very supportive former member of the Beatles?", "correct": "George Harrison", "options": ["Paul McCartney", "John Lennon", "Ringo Starr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Harrison.\n\n\tGeorge Harrison was co-executive producer of the film through his production company Handmade Films (which also produced Monty Python's 'Life of Brian').  Harrison also provided the music for the closing credits in the film.\r If you have not seen 'Time Bandits' yet, I strongly recommend it.  Aside from Terry Gilliam's imaginative directing, it also features great acting by Cleese and Palin, along with Sean Connery, Shelley Duvall, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, Peter Vaughn, David Warner and the 'bandits' themselves, all very short fellows played by the following:\r David Rappaport as Randall \rKenny Baker as Fidgit \rMalcolm Dixon as Strutter \rMike Edmonds as Og \rJack Purvis as Wally\rand \rTiny Ross as Vermin \n"}, {"text": "Terry Gilliam returned to directing with the full Python crew with the 1983 film 'The Meaning of Life'.  Along with co-directing the feature film, Gilliam added a short featurette that ran for 16 minutes before the feature began.  What was it called?", "correct": "The Crimson Permanent Assurance", "options": ["When Humans Could Not Fly", "How to Create a Monkey", "The Great Teetotaller Rebellion of 1642"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Crimson Permanent Assurance.\n\n\tOne of the true highlights of 'The Meaning of Life' is the fact that you get to watch this short feature each time you view the film.  Initially, 'The Crimson Permanent Assurance' had been intended as a skit within the feature film itself, but as its length grew, and as it diverged more and more from the style and themes of the feature, it became apparent that the film would have to be presented 'separately'.  \r Pythons Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Graham Chapman and Terry Gilliam all show up in this featurette. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps Terry Gilliam's most acclaimed film was this cinematic gem that told the story of a dystopic future in which corporations rule and terrorism has become an almost expected part of everyday life.  After what country is the film named?", "correct": "Brazil", "options": ["Australia", "China", "Russia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrazil.\n\n\tAlmost frightening in some of its parallels to the world of today, 'Brazil' is at once mystical and ominously realistic.  The cast of 'Brazil' includes Jonathan Pryce in the lead role as Sam Lowry, Robert De Niro, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, Ian Richardson, Peter Vaughn and Kim Griest. \n"}, {"text": "'The Aventures of Baron Munchausen' (or 'Die Abenteuer des Baron von M\u00fcnchhausen', as it is known in Germany) was Gilliam's 1988 film epic.  Which of Gilliam's Python pals played a key role in the film?", "correct": "Eric Idle", "options": ["Michael Palin", "John Cleese", "Graham Chapman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEric Idle.\n\n\tEric Idle appears in this film as the speedster Desmond.  Also appearing are John Neville (as the Baron), Sarah Polley, Oliver Reed, Jonathan Pryce, Uma Thurman, Sting and Robin Williams (credited as Ray D. Tutto, a play on the Italian 'Re di Tutto', which means 'King of Everything'). \n"}, {"text": "My personal favorite Terry Gilliam film featured Robin Williams as Parry, a man whose wife was killed by a deranged gunman.  Jeff Bridges plays Jack Lucas, a radio DJ who believes himself responsible for encouraging the gunman to perform said killing.  What is the name of this film that sees the lives of these two men change as their paths coincide?", "correct": "The Fisher King", "options": ["Cry of the Banshee", "Storytime", "Spies Like Us"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fisher King.\n\n\t'The Fisher King' was released in 1991, a film that really displayed Gilliam's maturity as a director.  Alongside Williams and Bridges appeared Amanda Plummer and Mercedes Ruehl (who won an Academy Award for her performance).  Additionally, the performance of Michael Jeter as a homeless cabaret singer deserves special mention.  I strongly recommend this film. \n"}, {"text": "Who stars as the lead character James Cole in Gilliam's 1995 sci-fi masterpiece 'Twelve Monkeys'?", "correct": "Bruce Willis", "options": ["Kurt Russell", "Sylvestor Stallone", "Kevin Costner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBruce Willis.\n\n\tAnother eccentric film from Mr. Gilliam, this one had numerous inpsirations, most importantly the French sci-fi classic film 'La Jet\u00e9e' by Chris Marker.  Alongside Willis appeared Madeleine Stowe, Christopher Plummer and Brad Pitt in a surprisingly quirky performance as Jeffrey Goines. \n"}, {"text": "What do you get when you mix the direction of Terry Gilliam with the combination of Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro as the lunatical Hunter S. Thompson and his lawyer on a random set of misguided, drug-induced escapades?  You get a very strange movie.  What was the title of this whacked out romp from 1998?", "correct": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", "options": ["The Streets of San Francisco", "To Live and Die in L.A.", "Houston, We've Got a Problem"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\n\n\tIt is difficult to assess the strangeness of Terry Gilliam's films, especially when compared with one another.  However, it might be safe to say that 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' was his most off-the-wall venture to date.  One of the wonderful things about 'Fear and Loathing' was its supporting cast, which included Michael Jeter, Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Gary Busey, Ellen Barkin, Harry Dean Stanton and quite a few other notable actors.  Even Hunter Thompson himself briefly appears, though his role is uncredited. \n"}, {"text": "We arrive at the year 2005 and Terry Gilliam's charming 'The Brothers Grimm'.  Which pair of actors played the role of the eponymous brothers?", "correct": "Matt Damon and Heath Ledger", "options": ["Jeff Bridges and John Stewart", "Johnny Depp and Robin Williams", "Greg Kinnear and Tobey Maguire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt Damon and Heath Ledger.\n\n\tForget about what the heartless critics have said, 'The Brothers Grimm' is a wonderful film that fits itself nicely into the Gilliam oeuvre.  Jonathan Pryce once again appears in this film as the demonic French general Delatombe and Peter Stormare applies his eccentric genius through his performance as the Italian mercenary Cavaldi.  Monica Belluci also does nice work as the Mirror Queen and Lena Headey is excellent as Angelika.  Much of the rest of the cast are Czechs, as that is where the movie was filmed.\r I hope you enjoyed this quiz and that it will inspire you to see the films of Terry Gilliam that you have thus far missed.  Thank you for playing. \n"}]}
