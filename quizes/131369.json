{"id": "131369", "name": "'The Matrix', Part 2: Before We Reload... Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies L-P", " The Matrix"], "questions": [{"text": "Neo's shocking extraction from the Matrix is the early climax of the film, but it also marks a new beginning.  Before any explanations can be provided, however, Neo requires physical therapy to restore his atrophied muscles to health.  During his therapy, Morpheus makes reference to which body part(s) that Neo has never used before?", "correct": "Eyes", "options": ["Mouth", "Brain", "Ears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEyes.\n\n\tAlong with electrically stimulating his atrophied muscles, Neo goes through surgery to have dozens of implants removed.  During his rehabilitation, he complains that his eyes hurt, a result of never having used them before according to Morpheus.  This line has double meaning.  He literally has never used his eyes for their function, to see.  He also has figuratively had his eyes opened to the real world. \n"}, {"text": "When Neo is ambulatory, Morpheus leads him on a small tour of his ship, a hovercraft that he uses to make his way around the 'real world'.  Morpheus' ship is named for Nebuchadnezzer, a king of which ancient empire? ", "correct": "Babylon", "options": ["Assyria", "Persia", "Egypt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBabylon.\n\n\tMorpheus' vessel is called the Nebuchadnezzer, the name of three ancient kings of Babylon.  If you watch closely during the tour you will see that the Nebuchadnezzer was 'made in the USA' in the year 2069. \n"}, {"text": "After the tour of the ship, Morpheus finally feels that the time has come to explain the nature of the Matrix to Neo.  It is here that Neo learns of the conflict between the humans and the machines.  He also discovers that human beings are being used as a power source for the machines.  Morpheus mentions one other power source that the machines have learned to harness, what is this power source? ", "correct": "Fusion", "options": ["Geothermal energy", "Irradiated solar cells", "Perpetual motion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFusion.\n\n\tDuring the initial stages of their existence as sentient entities the machines were reliant on solar energy.  However, according to Morpheus, human beings 'scorched the sky' in order to cut off that source once the wars between the two rival lifeforms began.  It was this action that forced the machines to resort to enslaving human beings and making them into their 'batteries', along with 'a form of fusion'.  Hmmph...one would think the fusion would be enough! \n"}, {"text": "Following his shocking indoctrination regarding the Matrix, Neo immediately begins training in the martial arts.  At this point he meets the 'operator', Tank, who introduces himself as a 'genuine child of Zion', the last Earth city.  Who is the only other member of Morpheus' crew to have been born in Zion?  ", "correct": "Dozer", "options": ["Mouse", "Trinity", "Switch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDozer.\n\n\tTank, played by Marcus Chong (son of Tommy Chong of 'Cheech and Chong'), and Dozer are introduced as brothers, and Tank calls himself a 'genuine child of Zion' upon first chatting with Neo.  Because Tank and Dozer were born in Zion, they don't have the implants and the 'plug' on the backs of their heads...hence they are not equipped to enter the Matrix. \n"}, {"text": "Speaking of 'Zion', the last human city, from which language is this name (Zion) ultimately derived?  \n", "correct": "Hebrew", "options": ["Greek", "Hindi", "Latin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHebrew.\n\n\tThe name 'Zion' is from the Hebrew 'siyy\u00f4n'.  It refers to the historic land of Israel and to the Jewish people who reside there.  The word has also been employed to describe a sacred place devoted to God, and/or a utopia.  Zion's National Park in southern Utah is probably the most recognized place to have adopted this name. According to Tank, Zion is located underground near the Earth's core, where it's still warm.  However, it wouldn't really be possible for humans to reside 'near the Earth's core', as Tank puts it...the pressure would be great.  I have rationalized Tank's claim off to hyperbole...a required skill of any film fan. \n"}, {"text": "During Neo's combat training Tank 'programs' him to learn a number of different forms of hand-to-hand combat.  Which is the first program we see loaded?  \n", "correct": "Jujitsu", "options": ["Kempo", "Tae Kwan Do", "Drunken Boxing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJujitsu.\n\n\tJujitsu is a weaponless martial art of traditional Japan, the parent of the more modern Judo.  Neo is also programmed to learn Kempo, Tae Kwan Do, Savate and Drunken Boxing, and he announces after his training that he 'knows Kung Fu'.  The reference to 'Drunken Boxing' is an homage to Woo-ping Yuen, who served as the trainer and coordinator for the fighting sequences in this film.  Jackie Chan starred in two films entitled 'Drunken Master' ('Zui Quan' in Mandarin; 'Jui Kuen' in Cantonese), the first of which was directed by Yuen in 1978. \n"}, {"text": "After an exhilarating set of sparring matches that pit Neo against Morpheus, Tank is instructed to 'load the jump program'.  Which, if any, of the crew members of the Nebuchadnezzer succeeded in their first attempt with the jump program?  ", "correct": "None", "options": ["Mouse", "Cypher", "Trinity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone.\n\n\tAnd, of course, Neo fails too! (Though he doesn't fail to provide us with a 'whoa!' during the scene, Keanu's signature 'phrase'...)  The truth is, as Cypher makes abundantly clear, 'everybody falls the first time.'  I find it shocking that anyone could be expected to take such a leap of faith at such an early stage in their training...I would request that a giant swimming pool be added below, at the very least. \n"}, {"text": "While meeting the 'lady in the red dress' in yet another training program, Morpheus and Neo are interrupted by a call from Dozer.  Sentinels have been sent by the machines to 'search and destroy' Morpheus' ship.  What is Dozer's nickname for the sentinels?  ", "correct": "Squiddy", "options": ["Daddy strong-legs", "Octoblob", "Globster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSquiddy.\n\n\tIt seems that Dozer has encountered a few of these metallic nightmares in the past.  According to Trinity and Dozer, they are 'killing machines designed for one thing...search and destroy.'  Have you ever noticed that evil creatures in action films always resemble spiders, bugs or multi-legged sea life?  Must be something scary about all those legs... \n"}, {"text": "Neo's next encounter aboard the Nebuchadnezzer is with Cypher, who is monitoring the Matrix using several computer screens.  Cypher describes the Matrix to Neo, which appears to the layman as simply a bunch of streaming green symbols.  Which of the following is not mentioned as part of what he 'sees' when peering at the monitors?", "correct": "Auburn", "options": ["Blonde", "Redhead", "Brunette"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAuburn.\n\n\tAs Cypher puts it, 'I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.'  Makes one wonder...what exactly is Cypher watching here, hmm? \n"}, {"text": "At the halfway point in the film we finally see the traitor (or 'informant', as the agents put it) among the crew revealed.  Cypher has been offered a deal by Agent Smith in return for handing over Morpheus.  During this scene we also discover Cypher's true last name, the same surname as which U.S. President?  ", "correct": "Reagan", "options": ["Bush", "Carter", "Clinton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReagan.\n\n\tTo make things more amusing, the Wachowski brothers also add other references to Ronald Reagan amid the conversation.  When Agent Smith asks Mr. Reagan (Cypher) about their deal, the latter requests that he 'remember nothing' and that he become somebody 'important...like an actor.'  Political references are always fun, if not subtle, in films, aren't they?  Please feel free to try the prequel and sequel(s) to this quiz if you enjoyed this one...thanks for playing! \n"}]}
