{"id": "218442", "name": "A Brief History of Particle Physics, Part I Quiz | Sci / Tech | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " History of Science"], "questions": [{"text": "One of the great achievements of nineteenth-century physics was the rejection of Newton's particle model of light in favor of the wave model implied by Maxwell's equations. So you can imagine how upset physicists were when Einstein came along and proposed that light interacted with matter as a quantized, massless particle after all! What phenomenon was Einstein attempting to explain?", "correct": "photoelectric effect", "options": ["blackbody radiation", "Compton effect", "Brownian motion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nphotoelectric effect.\n\n\tEinstein won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics primarily for this explanation of the photoelectric effect, in which light strikes a metal surface and current-carrying electrons come out. Only light above a certain frequency (depending on the metal) can induce this effect; Einstein deduced that each photon carried a certain amount, or quantum, of energy depending on its frequency or color, which had to be sufficient to overcome the electron binding energy. He was inspired by Planck's explanation of blackbody radiation, which held that electromagnetic emission was quantized; Einstein expanded this idea to apply to electromagnetic fields in general.\r The Compton effect (a shift in wavelength of light scattered off a particle at rest) is what finally proved Einstein's theory to the satisfaction of the scientific community. We now understand the photon as something with properties both of a wave and of a pointlike particle: it propagates as a wave, and interacts with matter like a particle. And it only gets wilder from here! \n"}, {"text": "In the 19th century, scientists were fascinated by the mystery of cathode rays: put a high voltage across a vacuum in a tube, and a ray of light would extend from end to end. But how? J. J. Thomson set out to solve this problem, and in 1897 he concluded that the rays were electric charge, carried by tiny particles with a high charge to mass ratio. He postulated that these \"corpuscles\" were constituents of the atom. What do we now call the particle he had discovered?", "correct": "electron", "options": ["positron", "proton", "neutron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nelectron.\n\n\tThomson initially believed that these were the only constituents of the atom. He envisioned an atom in which tiny, negatively charged corpuscles floated in a positively charged, massless cloud. (This is the famous \"plum pudding\" model, so named for the excellent British dessert.) His vision had very little in common with the atom as we now understand it, but his clever cathode ray experiments set the stage for an exciting new era of physics. Thomson won the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery. \n"}, {"text": "In 1909, Ernest Rutherford assigned an undergraduate student to check whether any alpha particles could be scattered from gold at large angles (basically, whether they could be reflected backward). Everyone was amazed when it was discovered that they were! Rutherford realized what this meant: the positive charge in an atom had to be concentrated in a small volume to generate such a large electric force. What is this central concentration of charge called?", "correct": "nucleus", "options": ["orbital", "quark sea", "electron shell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnucleus.\n\n\tRutherford and his student (Ernest Marsden) had discovered the nucleus, a tiny ball of protons and neutrons (although they wouldn't find out about the neutrons until later. Rutherford, who won the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, later described how shocking this discovery was: \"It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.\" J. J. Thomson's plum pudding model was dead forever. \n"}, {"text": "Rutherford's discovery led to the idea that each atom consisted of electrons orbiting around protons, positively charged particles. But there was a problem: helium, for example, had twice the nuclear charge of hydrogen (one proton) but four times the weight! And wouldn't electromagnetic repulsion make heavy nuclei extraordinarily unstable? Luckily, in 1932 the English physicist James Chadwick discovered what electrically neutral particle, one of the constituents of the nucleus?", "correct": "neutron", "options": ["neutrino", "photon", "gluon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nneutron.\n\n\tSince neutrons don't interact electrically with matter, they are much more difficult to detect than charged particles -- they tend to pass right through detectors! Chadwick won the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his clever multi-step experiment and analysis. First he bombarded beryllium with alpha radiation (an alpha particle is a helium nucleus, two neutrons and two protons). The beryllium emitted \"penetrating neutral radiation\" (neutrons), which he used to bombard paraffin, nitrogen, and other targets.Protons, which he could easily detect, were emitted from the targets, and by examining their momenta and scattering angles he could measure the mass of the neutrons that had collided with them.Particle physicists still use these \"recoil protons\" to detect neutrons. \n"}, {"text": "At the same time, particle physics was expanding into rather bizarre territory. In 1927, English physicist Paul Dirac (1933 Nobel Prize in Physics) had with his eponymous equation taken the first step toward relativistic quantum mechanics. But his theory allowed negative-energy electrons -- and if electrons had no ground state, they would keep decaying to lower and lower energies, radiating infinite amounts of energy! What strange idea did Dirac propose to explain this problem?", "correct": "All the negative-energy states are filled with an infinite \"sea\" of electrons.", "options": ["Negative-energy states are forbidden by the Dirac exclusion principle.", "There is another type of electron that \"falls up\" from negative-energy states, and the negative energy it emits cancels the positive energy radiated by ordinary electrons.", "Electrons radiate a type of energy that could not be detected by the experimentalists of the day."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll the negative-energy states are filled with an infinite \"sea\" of electrons.\n\n\tAll matter tends to decay to lower energy states, and the energy has to go somewhere, so the lack of a ground state was a serious problem! Dirac's explanation relied on the fact that electrons - both positive- and negative-energy - are fermions, so the Pauli exclusion principle says that no two electrons can occupy the same state.So if there's an infinite sea of electrons already filling the negative-energy states, none of the other electrons can decay! And if the sea is uniform, then it would exert no net force and we'd never detect it. It was a brilliant but desperate idea, but one thing was missing.There should be a particle with the same mass as an electron, but with positive energy and positive charge, interpreted as a \"hole in the sea\" ... but none had been detected. Cue Anderson's experiment! \n"}, {"text": "Dirac's theory was saved by American physicist Carl Anderson's 1932 discovery of the first known example of antimatter. Examining photographs of a cloud chamber bombarded by cosmic rays, Anderson noticed the track of what antiparticle of an electron?", "correct": "positron", "options": ["electron neutrino", "muon", "pi meson"], "explanation": "\n\n\npositron.\n\n\tCloud chambers are venerable particle detectors: charged particles passing through a gas leave a trail of ions. Water vapor condenses on the ions, and so the trail is visible in a photograph. Knowing that charged particles curve in a magnetic field, Anderson placed magnets around his cloud chamber. By measuring the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of the curved positron track, Anderson determined that the particle was positively charged; by measuring the track's radius of curvature, he could tell that it had the same mass as the electron.Anderson won the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery, but Dirac's interpretation of the positron would be rejected in the 1940s. Feynman (1965 Nobel Prize in Physics) and Stuckelberg argued persuasively that the negative-energy solutions of the Dirac equation could be expressed as positive-energy states of the positron.Dirac's electron sea, and its holes, are no longer necessary -- but Dirac's equation now has the powerful implication that every particle has an antiparticle. \n"}, {"text": "Anderson and his group continued examining cosmic rays and in 1935 made another important discovery, with Seth Neddermeyer. This particle had the same charge as the electron and about 200 times its mass; it was initially thought to be the meson transmitting the strong nuclear force, but it interacted too weakly with protons and neutrons. What is this middleweight lepton now called?", "correct": "muon", "options": ["positron", "tau", "muonium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmuon.\n\n\tThe muon, which was discovered independently by J. C. Street and E. C. Stevenson in 1937, had not been predicted in theory and its role in particle physics was at first elusive. (Isidor Rabi, a brilliant atomic physicist who won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physics, famously asked \"Who ordered that?\" when first told of the discovery.) Decades later, however, the muon turned out to be a fundamental particle, now understood as the charged lepton in the second generation of elementary particles. As such, it's critical in our understanding of the Standard Model; in fact, it played a key role in the development of the particle physics conservation laws as we'll see in Question 14. \r The positron is an antielectron, discussed in the previous question. The tau is the heavyweight lepton, and muonium is a neat, short-lived substance of great interest to atomic physicists: it's essentially a hydrogen atom in which the electron has been replaced by a muon. \n"}, {"text": "In 1930, particle physicists noticed yet another problem. A type of radioactivity called beta decay, in which a radioactive nucleus A decays into a lighter nucleus B by emitting an electron, had been studied extensively in the lab. It was discovered that, from experiment to experiment, the energy of the emitted electron varied enormously even in cases where the energies of the parent nucleus A and daughter nucleus B were held constant. Why did this incline physicists to tear out their hair?", "correct": "It violated conservation of energy.", "options": ["It violated parity.", "It violated gauge symmetry.", "It violated conservation of mass."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt violated conservation of energy.\n\n\tWhen something decays, the energies of the decay products had better add up to the energy of the parent state! This is why it was so problematic that the final state energy of beta decay seemed to be variable. Niels Bohr (1922 Nobel Physics Prize) immediately argued that the law of conservation of energy should be abandoned (it should be noted that, while a brilliant man, he is on the record as having ridiculed no fewer than five theories of particle physics now regarded as fundamental). Wolfgang Pauli (1945 Nobel Physics Prize) argued that perhaps a \"silent\", electrically neutral particle was also emitted, carrying off the energy, and in 1933 Enrico Fermi (1938 Nobel Physics Prize) incorporated this suggestion into his new theory of beta decay, predicting a massless particle which he called the neutrino (it was actually, technically, an antineutrino). I mention the Nobel Prizes to demonstrate that even provably brilliant people don't have all the answers all the time! You should hear some of the stories told about arguments between Bohr and Einstein ... \n"}, {"text": "As quantum mechanics developed, the photon came to be interpreted as the particle mediating the electromagnetic force: when two charged particles are attracted or repulsed, what's happening is that they're exchanging a photon. The investigations into the nucleus made clear that there must be a \"strong force\" binding the protons and neutrons together. In 1934, Japanese theorist Hideki Yukawa proposed that the strong force must also be mediated by a particle, which he predicted would be massive (300 times the mass of an electron and 1/6 the mass of a proton) to account for the strong force's short range. What name, meaning \"middle-weight\", was given to this particle?", "correct": "meson", "options": ["hadron", "lepton", "baryon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmeson.\n\n\tThe muon (see Question 7) was initially thought to be Yukawa's meson, but it interacted very weakly with protons and neutrons. Yukawa's meson is actually the pi meson, which comes in three charges (neutral, positive, and negative) and is produced in large amounts by cosmic ray collisions with particles in Earth's upper atmosphere. The massive pions arise from a symmetry breaking of the strong force; there is also a massless mediator, the gluon, which we'll discuss when we get to the quark model in Part II of this quiz. Yukawa won the 1949 Nobel Prize in Physics for his prediction. \n"}, {"text": "In 1947, particle physicists believed that they had solved almost all of the outstanding problems. Ha! That December, Rochester and Lee discovered a new neutral meson. In 1950, Anderson found a new neutral baryon. These bizarre particles were created in pairs by the strong force but decayed singly by the weak force! This wasn't explained until 1953 when Gell-Mann and Nishijima introduced what new quantum number?", "correct": "strangeness S, conserved by the strong force but not by the weak force", "options": ["strangeness S, conserved by the electromagnetic force but not by the strong or weak forces", "weirdness W, conserved by the weak force but not by the strong force", "parity P, conserved for leptons but not for baryons or mesons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nstrangeness S, conserved by the strong force but not by the weak force.\n\n\tMurray Gell-Man (1969 Nobel Prize in Physics; we'll be hearing much more from him later!) and Kazuhiko Nishijima arrived at the idea independently; it was Gell-Man who coined the term strangeness. This was the moment when particle physicists realized that they had a zoo of \"elementary\" particles on their hands, and no understanding of how they all fit together.In his 1955 Nobel Physics Prize acceptance speech, atomic physicist Willis Lamb recounted a popular joke that \"the finder of a new elementary particle used to be rewarded by a Nobel prize, but such a discovery now ought to be punished by a $10,000 fine.\" \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, indirect theoretical evidence for Fermi's neutrino (see Question 8) continued to mount. But it's very difficult to detect a massless, neutral particle! So when American physicists Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan decided to try to detect it in 1955, they needed an extraordinarily intense source of neutrinos. Where did they set up their experiment?", "correct": "The Savannah River nuclear reactor in South Carolina", "options": ["The Nevada Test Site during Operation Teapot nuclear testing", "The Saddle Mountains in Washington State (the higher elevation meant more cosmic rays)", "The Nuclear Physics Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Savannah River nuclear reactor in South Carolina.\n\n\tNuclear reactors are intense sources of antineutrinos. Cowan and Reines placed a water tank at the reactor to look for recoil neutrons (much like Chadwick's experiment described in Question 4). An antineutrino collides with a proton in the water, resulting in a neutron and a positron -- inverse beta decay! Since antineutrinos are massless and electrically neutral, they don't often interact with matter and the odds of this reaction were extremely small. The Savannah River reactor produced a calculated flux of 50 million million antineutrinos per square centimeter per second at their location, but even with a 200-liter tank of water they only detected about three antineutrino events every hour! \r Reines and Cowan observed enough events to prove the existence of the neutrino and antineutrino by 1956, inaugurating a subfield of particle physics that's extremely active to this day. Reines won the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery in 1995, but unfortunately Cowan had died 21 years before. \n"}, {"text": "The 1950s were a time of some despair among particle physicists. One of the most cherished postulates of physics was the parity symmetry, the idea that the mirror image of any physical process is also a valid physical process. Parity had already been confirmed for electromagnetic and strong interactions. But when Chinese-American experimentalist Chien-Shiung Wu turned her attention to parity in weak interactions, she made a shocking discovery. What was it?", "correct": "All neutrinos are left-handed.", "options": ["Neutrinos don't have any spin at all, right-handed or left-handed.", "Most neutrinos are left-handed.", "The weak force doesn't really exist."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll neutrinos are left-handed.\n\n\tIf the parity symmetry was valid for the weak interaction (for which neutrinos and antineutrinos are the signature), we would expect that half of all neutrinos would be left-handed (spin axis against the direction of motion) and half would be right-handed (spin axis along the direction of motion). But Wu, investigating neutrino helicity by analyzing the direction of the electrons emitted in the beta decay of Cobalt 60 (neutrino physics is necessarily a bit indirect), discovered that all neutrinos are left-handed and all antineutrinos are right-handed. The weak force violates parity maximally. Her result was confirmed within days by a group at Columbia led by Leon Lederman.\r Wu did not win the Nobel Prize for her momentous experiment, a bizarre decision still talked about by particle physicists. The two Chinese-American theorists who had suggested the experiment to Wu (a friend of theirs), Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, shared the Nobel Physics Prize in 1957. At 31, Lee was the second-youngest scientist ever to win a Nobel Prize. \n"}, {"text": "Theoretical physicists were examining antimatter and neutrinos at about the same time. The antiparticles of charged particles have the opposite charge, but the situation for neutral particles is not so clear! The neutron has a distinct antiparticle, but the photon is its own antiparticle. So debate raged over antineutrinos. Are neutrinos their own antiparticles?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNeutrinos and antineutrinos are distinct. This was first theoretically predicted in 1953 by Konopinski and Mahmoud, who came up with a conservation law of lepton number to explain why some reactions didn't seem to occur. Electrons, muons and neutrinos had L=1, positrons, antimuons, and antineutrinos would have L=-1, and all other particles had L=0. L would have to be the same on both sides of the reaction equation (this is why Fermi's neutrino in Question 8 actually had to be an antineutrino). Thus the neutrino and antineutrino quantum numbers are distinct: they're different particles.\r In 1959, Raymond Davis (who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics for subsequent work on solar neutrinos) and Daniel Harmer proved this experimentally. It was already known that the reaction neutrino + neutron -> proton + electron was possible; Davis and Harmer looked for the same reaction, but with an antineutrino. When they didn't see the reaction, they knew that the particles weren't interchangeable. \n"}, {"text": "The amazing neutrino had not yielded up all of its secrets. In 1959, Bruno Pontecorvo suggested that there were two kinds, or generations, of neutrino, one for each generation of negatively-charged lepton. What prompted this assertion?", "correct": "When muons decay into electrons, a neutrino and an antineutrino are produced.", "options": ["When positrons decay into electrons, a neutrino and an antineutrino are produced.", "Given the proliferation of \"elementary\" particles, it didn't make sense that there should be only one neutrino.", "He wanted to save parity."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen muons decay into electrons, a neutrino and an antineutrino are produced.\n\n\tA muon is heavier than an electron, so muon decay is energetically favored. But muons never decayed into an electron plus a photon, as one might expect; this implied that \"mu-ness\" was a conserved quantity. How then to explain the observed decay of a muon into an electron plus a neutrino plus an antineutrino? Pontecorvo had the idea that the neutrino was a mu neutrino (mu number 1 to balance the muon) and the antineutrino an electron neutrino (electron number -1 to balance the electron). (Tsung-Dao Lee, more famous for the parity violation in Question 12, had the same idea in 1960, before Pontecorvo's work had been translated from the Russian and republished.) \r In 1962, at the Brookhaven Laboratory in New York, Leon Lederman (who also confirmed parity violation), Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger were able to confirm the existence of a distinct mu neutrino. They shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics for this experimental tour de force, which included a 44-foot-thick radiation shield made of steel from a decommissioned warship. \n"}, {"text": "The next big advance was to impose some kind of order on the particle zoo. Murray Gell-Man was equal to the task with his 1961 Eightfold Way. What shape did this \"Periodic Table of Particles\" take?", "correct": "two hexagons and a triangle", "options": ["three pentagons", "a rectangle", "an octagon"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwo hexagons and a triangle.\n\n\tThis is what Gell-Man won his 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics for, and he deserved it! He arranged the baryons and mesons according to their charge and strangeness. The eight lightest baryons formed the baryon octet: six baryons on the points of a hexagon, and two in the center. The eight lightest mesons were similarly arranged in the pseudo-scalar meson octet, and the ten heavier baryons were arranged in a triangular array, the baryon decuplet (one baryon on each corner, two on each side, and one in the middle). The Eightfold Way became widely accepted when Gell-Man accurately predicted the mass and lifetime of the omega-minus particle, which had not yet been discovered but which belonged on the downward point of the baryon decuplet. \r I hope you've enjoyed this quiz on the history of my chosen field of physics. Watch for Part II of this quiz, which will cover the last 40 years of the twentieth century. \n"}]}
