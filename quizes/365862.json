One of the men under the bridge gets up to attack her, but she uses her voodoo powers to hold him back, knocking him out as Madison and Zoe locate her and ask her to rejoin the coven.  They watch as she takes out a knife and cuts into the man's chest, tearing out his dark heart to bring to Marie for a special potion.

She dreads telling Cordelia that she has cancer.  Fiona thinks that love may be the best medicine-- the Axeman claims that they can spend a month traveling together but she's worried of decaying before his very eyes.  She tells him that she'll stay alive to spite the others.  One of the girls in the coven is coming into her own; she just needs to figure out which and stop them.\r Next door to the academy, Joan tells Luke, still wounded, that he had no business going to the witch house for any reason.  Now he's impure and he has to be cleansed.  She forces him into the bathtub and, with bleach and cleaning products, cleanses him from the inside out. \n"}, {"text": "Why did Misty Day have to leave her house in the swamp?", "correct": "An assassin tried to kill her", "options": ["It was overtaken by floodwaters", "It was burned down", "She had a rat problem"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn assassin tried to kill her.\n\n\tIn the academy, the girls, despite all distraction, discuss the plan at hand-- they need to end Fiona once and for all.  They've lost Queenie but they all have to stand true.  The doorbell rings and, with no servants in the house, Zoe answers the door to find Misty Day.  Someone found her in the swamp.\rThe previous night, she was awakened by a newly-regenerated Myrtle Snow who, having been stepped on by an assassin outside, warned her of the possibility of a murderer in their midst.  This gave them the chance to flee through the swamp when the coast was clear.\rCordelia hears the conversation in the hall and discovers that the witch is none other than Misty Day; she's welcome to stay in the academy.  Misty also asks if her friend can stay...she's in the greenhouse. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Myrtle believe is the next Supreme in this episode?", "correct": "Misty", "options": ["Nan", "Zoe", "Madison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMisty.\n\n\tWhen the witches head into the greenhouse to meet Misty's friend they discover that it's none other than Myrtle Snow who was burned at the stake before their very eyes no more than a short time ago.  She and Cordelia reunite and discuss the hard times that have befallen the coven but Myrtle is optimistic.  Since resurrection is a feat more difficult than the Seven Wonders, Misty may very well be their new Supreme.\rUpstairs, Zoe sets Kyle up with a laptop so that he can learn some basic English.  Madison tries to seduce Kyle and thinks that the reeducation is useless.  Either way, they leave him to it to deal with the coven matters; they have a ritual to perform. \n"}, {"text": "According to Cordelia, how many times has the Sacred Taking been performed?", "correct": "Three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree & 3.\n\n\tMyrtle and Cordelia lead the others to set up the Sacred Taking in the parlor.  This ritual is meant to prime a witch for the ultimate sacrifice-- a Supreme must willingly give up her own powers and her life to pass the torch to the next possible candidate who, as Myrtle presumes, should be Misty Day.  They will perform the ritual and, somehow, convince Fiona to end it all. Misty is worried about the role because she doesn't want the burden on her life, but Cordelia says that it is not her choice.  Whoever is Supreme will need to rule, but first, Fiona needs to die.  The Sacred Taking has only been performed three times in the coven's history, the first time in the Salem witch trials. \n"}, {"text": "Who appears to Fiona in the night in an attempt to convince her to take her own life?", "correct": "Madison", "options": ["Misty", "Anna-Leigh", "Cordelia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadison.\n\n\tFiona, struggling with her cancer, throws up in the toilet before hearing music in her room.  She enters to find none other than Madison, who she killed, dancing around and planning the set-up of her future room, claiming to be the Supreme.  She brought herself back, she claims, and says that there's nothing for Fiona to do except either burn at the stake or spend the night overdosing on pills in a less-noble fashion. When Madison leaves, Fiona packs a bag.  Of course, that's not enough to push Fiona-- Myrtle appears next, claiming that the new Supreme, Madison, has brought her back.  When Fiona claims to have someone willing to look out for her, Cordelia clues her in to the fact that she will still die alone and disappointed by everyone. The Axeman will leave her, disgusted, on her deathbed, and she will struggle in her last days. \n"}, {"text": "Does Fiona take the pills given to her, intending to commit suicide?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tOut in the hallway the girls wait for something to happen.  When Nan asks the others if they think she should be the Supreme, no one responds, spurring her to head next door to spend time with Luke instead.  She lets herself into the Ramsey home while Hank watches from the car outside.  When Nan heads upstairs he finds Luke locked away in a closet.\rFiona, considering the possibilities, decides to confide in Myrtle about her life and final choice.  She asks Myrtle to pass her fur from the closet while she does her makeup.  She takes a handful of pills and lays on the bed while Myrtle steals some jewelery and leaves. \n"}, {"text": "Marie Laveau decides to dismember Delphine's body parts.  What does she start with?", "correct": "Her hand", "options": ["Her thumbs", "Her foot", "Her head"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer hand.\n\n\tAs Fiona closes her eyes and begins to wait for death she's awakened by the only person in the academy on her side-- Spalding, a ghost haunting the halls.  He explains that he can speak because he was murdered, and now he can properly help her.  He gives her ipecac, urging her to get up and fight back since the others tricked her.  Madison, he says, was brought back by a swamp witch.  She takes the spoonful, throwing up the pills, and thanks him.\r Across the city, Queenie visits Delphine's cage to give her a burger.  Delphine tries to persuade Queenie to let her out, but Marie Laveau comes in to hear the conversation.  She sends Queenie on her way before the two talk about the issue at hand; Delphine can't be killed, so she might as well go back in the box.  Marie decides that it's perfectly suitable to grab a machete and lop off her hand in one fell swoop.  They've only just begun, she says. \n"}, {"text": "Who is shot and killed in this episode?", "correct": "Joan Ramsey", "options": ["Hank Foxx", "Fiona Goode", "Spalding"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoan Ramsey.\n\n\tNext door to the academy, Nan tries to smuggle Luke out the front door to save him from his mother.  Unfortunately, Joan knows that Nan is trespassing and she's on the phone with the cops.  She insists that she brought Luke into the world, so she can take him out, but this is moments before a laser sight appears on her chest and she's shot several times, killing her instantly.  Luke jumps in the way to protect Nan from the same fate, taking a gunshot and being critically wounded.\rAt the academy, Myrtle plays Schubert's last sonata on the piano while the girls wait for Fiona to die.  Unfortunately, there's not a chance-- she emerges from the other room looking for the 'swamp witch'.\rUnfortunately she's wandered next door.  Fiona follows to find the paramedics already there, and she ends up using mind control to let the police let them stay.  Fiona asks her to bring Joan back from the dead to demonstrate her power, which she promptly does.\rOutside in the street, Cordelia senses an item of importance on the ground-- a bullet-- and realizes that they may all be in danger. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of the episode, Fiona receives a box containing which of these?", "correct": "A head", "options": ["A bomb", "A jacket", "A voodoo doll"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA head.\n\n\tThe next morning, Fiona comes down for breakfast to find Cordelia at the table having some coffee.  Fiona commends her daughter for what she tried to orchestrate-- it showed grip and acted as a sign of hope for the coven's future.  She says she's proud that she's her daughter.\rCordelia reveals to Fiona that the bullet is a silver one blessed with holy water, indicating that witch hunters are after them.  They need Fiona.\rThe doorbell rings and, with no servants around, Fiona answers it to find nothing but a cardboard box on the front step.   When she brings it inside and opens it, she finds Delphine's decapitated head, animated inside, a gift in the vein of Bastien's head, only this time it's sent from Marie Laveau, and not to her. \n"}]}
