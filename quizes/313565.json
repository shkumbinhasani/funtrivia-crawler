{"id": "313565", "name": "Cell Phones Multiple Choice Quiz | Sci / Tech | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " History of Science"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the best definition of the word \"cell\" as it relates to cellular phones?", "correct": "A nearby base station", "options": ["A radio", "A telephone pole", "Any type of telephone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA nearby base station.\n\n\tA cellular, or mobile, phone is basically a small portable radio phone. It operates by communicating with a \"cell\" (nearby base station) which connects it to a large phone network. A cell phone offers us convenient conversation over long distances because it operates without wires. Is this a curse or a blessing? I'm not sure. \n"}, {"text": "One of the earliest known mobile phones was developed by Swedish scientist Lars Magnus Ericsson around 1910. Which machine did Ericsson use to make his mobile phone run?", "correct": "A car", "options": ["An airplane", "A boat", "A radio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA car.\n\n\tLars Magnus Ericsson created one of the earliest mobile phones in history when he installed a telephone inside his automobile. He utilized a pair of long electrical wires and connected them to a national phone network as he drove his automobile across Sweden. Ericsson lived from 1846 to 1926 and quietly amassed a monetary fortune during his lifetime. \n"}, {"text": "During the 1930s and 1940s, inventor Donald Hings helped to develop a two-way radio device called the Walkie-Talkie. For which government did Hings work during the Second World War?", "correct": "Canadian", "options": ["American", "Nazi", "French"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanadian.\n\n\tThe Walkie-Talkie proved to be a major development in the realm of wireless communication and became extremely useful to soldiers in battle. Donald Hings was born in Britain but grew up in Canada. In the 1930s, Hings created a portable radio signaling system which eventually became known as a \"Walkie Talkie.\" During World War II, Hings worked in Ottawa in order to improve his device for military use.Hings was inducted into the Telecommunications Hall of Fame in 2006. Another Canadian scientist, Alfred J. Gross, is also credited with the development of the Walkie-Talkie, and he developed a telephone pager system as well. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1950s, a portable mobile phone named the \"LK-1\" was developed. Who was the engineer who created this \"radiophone\"?", "correct": "Leonid Kupriyanovich", "options": ["Douglas Ring", "Philip Porter", "William Rae Young"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeonid Kupriyanovich.\n\n\tA Soviet radio engineer, Leonid Kupriyanovich, developed a portable mobile phone and named it after himself- thus \"LK-1.\" This phone weighed about 3 kgs and was operable within a 20-30 kilometer area. Leonid was able to connect his device to a local telephone network. In subsequent years, Kupriyanovich succeeded in making his \"radiophone\" smaller, thus easier to carry. Douglas Ring, W. Rae Young and Philip Porter were scientists who worked for Bell Labs during the 1940s; they did extensive research on cell phone development. \n"}, {"text": "In 1970, an engineer named Amos E. Joel, Jr. invented a system which allowed mobile phones to travel through several cell areas without interruption during a single conversation. What was this system called?", "correct": "Call handoff", "options": ["Zero generation", "Limited coverage network", "Non-automatic phone system"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCall handoff.\n\n\tThe \"call handoff\" system was an extremely important development in the advancement of cell phone technology. Prior to 1970, mobile phones had to stay within the area provided by one base station; thus, mobile phone service could not continue through several cell areas. Amos Joel, an engineer for Bell Labs, created a system whereby a single mobile phone conversation could continue without loss of signal. The term \"zero generation\" refers to \"primitive\" mobile devices or cellular networks which were developed before 1971. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Morton Cooper supposedly made the first \"modern mobile phone\" call on a New York City street in 1973. For which Illinois company was Cooper working at the time?", "correct": "Motorola", "options": ["AT&T", "Samsung", "Sony"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMotorola.\n\n\tMorton Cooper impressed newspaper reporters in April 1973 when he made a phone call to another scientist while strolling on the streets of New York City. The phone which he used was a large analog mobile device. Motorola was founded in 1928 in Chicago, Illinois. Samsung has its headquarters in Korea, Sony is a Japanese corporation, and AT&T has its headquarters in Dallas, Texas. \n"}, {"text": "In 1983, a truly portable cell phone called the DynaTAC 8000X was introduced to the world. What was the nickname of this phone?", "correct": "The Brick", "options": ["The Diamond", "The Rock", "The Mound"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Brick.\n\n\tIn 1983, Motorola introduced the DynaTAC 8000X, and it revolutionized the cell phone business. It was a lightweight device which only weighed about 30 ounces. It was called \"The Brick\" because it closely resembled a brick used for construction- it had the same shape as a brick. \n"}, {"text": "What does the expression \"2G\" mean when talking about cell phone development?", "correct": "Second generation", "options": ["Two gigabytes", "Two thousand", "Second grade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSecond generation.\n\n\tWhen historians and scientists refer to the development of cellular phones, they often use the letter \"G\", or generation, to mark technological progress. The term \"2G\" means \"second generation\" mobile phones. In high-tech terms, 2G refers to cell phones which were developed during the 1990s. 2G phones had become more portable and more powerful than previous 1G generation phones such as \"The Brick.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these statements about 2G technology is true?", "correct": "2G technology led to the popularity of text messaging.", "options": ["2G technology greatly increased the size of a cell phone.", "2G technology was analog in nature.", "2G technology was developed in only one country."], "explanation": "\n\n\n2G technology led to the popularity of text messaging.\n\n\t2G phones made tremendous technological breakthroughs, switching from analog networks to digital networks. This switch to digital made cellular communication faster and much more reliable than in earlier generations. Computer chips replaced large batteries as power sources and allowed the phones to do more functions, such as text messaging. 2G research and development took place in several countries around the globe, including Finland and the USA. \n"}, {"text": "The first \"smartphones\" were designed in the early 1990s. What is the definition of a \"smartphone\"?", "correct": "A device which allows users to install  and run applications of their choice.", "options": ["A device which does not have a ringtone", "Any 2G type of  cellular device", "A device which does not have personal digital assistance capability"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA device which allows users to install  and run applications of their choice.\n\n\tSmartphones have proved to be a tremendous technological advancement because they are small, compact and powerful. Smartphones, equipped with 3G technology, allow users to do a wide variety of tasks: downloading, taking photos, calculating, Internet access, etc. Smartphones have PDA (personal digital assistance) capability; they are the wave of the present and of the future. \n"}]}
