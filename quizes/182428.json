{"id": "182428", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Late Captain Pierce' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "Hawkeye's dad is in a panic after he has discovered via telegram that his son has passed away in Korea.  Who does Mr. Pierce try to contact at the 4077th to verify his son's death?  ", "correct": "BJ", "options": ["Colonel Potter", "Radar", "Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBJ.\n\n\tKlinger wakes BJ up from his slumber to inform him that he has a phone call.  Initially BJ believes the call is from his wife, but then learns that, oddly enough, it is from Hawkeye's father.  BJ answers the call, but is unable to chat with Mr. Pierce before the phone call is disconnected.  BJ just hears a 'how' and a 'why'. \n"}, {"text": "After the phone call, Hawkeye, who has also been awakened by Klinger, sits with the swarthy corporal and chats with him about home.  Where does Hawkeye claim his family has a 'summer cottage'?", "correct": "Crabapple Cove", "options": ["Long Island", "Nantucket", "West Palm Beach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrabapple Cove.\n\n\tHmm...a trick question, perhaps?  'Klinger, did you ever hear of Crabapple Cove?' asks Hawkeye.  Klinger responds, 'Is that in the hygiene lecture?'  Annoyed, Hawkeye answers, 'Crabapple Cove, Maine.  We have a summer cottage there.'  Hawkeye then proceeds to describe exactly why he is madly in love with the place that we all know of as his home town.  Klinger doesn't seem interested...he falls asleep during Hawkeye's monologue. \n"}, {"text": "After having sat nervously next to the phone for the rest of the night hoping for another call from his dad, Hawkeye decides to have a quick shower.  On his way to the shower tent he encounters a lieutenant from the morgue detail of the quartermaster corps.  What is this morbid chap's nickname?  ", "correct": "Digger", "options": ["Mortuary Mort", "Dracula", "Paleface"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDigger.\n\n\tDigger is ably played by Richard Masur.  Also known as Lt. Detmuller, Digger tells Hawkeye that he has arrived at the M*A*S*H to pick up a body and asks about who he should see.  Hawkeye replies, 'I believe Corporal Klinger can assist you in this undertaking.'  Not amused, Digger mumbles to himself, 'Not one straight man in the whole army!' \n"}, {"text": "It turns out that the lieutenant is after Hawkeye's body, as the army has pronounced the good captain dead.  Hawkeye, who most assuredly appears very much alive, isn't willing to give himself over to the lieutenant just yet, despite the pleading of the latter.  The lieutenant insists that he needs to bring back a body to the morgue; where does Hawkeye suggest he look?", "correct": "Mess tent", "options": ["Front line", "Latrine", "Rosie's Bar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMess tent.\n\n\tDigger is very self-absorbed.  Rather than concerning himself with Hawkeye's predicament, he is focused on not messing up his job.  It seems that Digger has had a few mishaps over recent weeks, having lost several other cadavers in the process of doing his work.  To remedy the problem, Hawkeye specifically suggests that Digger look out for the 'hash eaters' in the mess tent. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye takes his case to Colonel Potter, who, when Hawkeye arrives at his office, is being accosted and annoyed by a certain Ferret Face.  What is Frank complaining to the Colonel about in this episode?", "correct": "The lack of participation in his calisthenics program", "options": ["The overuse of heaters at the camp during the dead of winter", "The lack of 'military discipline' amongst the local peasants", "The lack of salutes he gets on a daily basis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe lack of participation in his calisthenics program.\n\n\tFrank insists that people participate in his exercise program, even in the middle of winter.  Frank asks for 'permission to make it mandatory', and adds, 'I've always felt that people volunteer better by force.'  Hawkeye thankfully interrupts Frank's whining with his somewhat more pressing predicament when he announces his death to the Colonel. \n"}, {"text": "BJ makes the best of Hawkeye's 'death' by suggesting a wake for Hawkeye.  Klinger interrupts the festivities by telling Hawkeye that he is still unable to contact his father.  Why are the phone and telegraph lines down?", "correct": "President Eisenhower is coming for a visit", "options": ["The cold weather has shut down all communications", "The lines are all tied up because it's Mother's Day", "The generator at the 4077th has lost power"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPresident Eisenhower is coming for a visit.\n\n\tAccording to Klinger, as a result of Eisenhower's impending arrival the phone and cable lines are down and secret service personnel are crawling around everywhere.  They've even locked up a number of South Koreans! \n"}, {"text": "Sitting in the Swamp the morning after the wake, Hawkeye and BJ discuss Hawkeye's 'death' with Frank.  Klinger arrives once again and has the same bad news; he can't contact Hawkeye's father.  To top off the bad news, he has no new mail for Hawkeye, as they are holding the Captain's mail in Seoul.  Hawkeye is especially bothered because he claims to be in the midst of an 'obscene correspondence' with...?", "correct": "A librarian", "options": ["An actress", "A nurse", "A waitress"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA librarian.\n\n\tSays Hawkeye: 'Klinger, I need my mail.  I'm right in the middle of an obscene correspondance with a librarian and we've just started 'C'.'  Poor Hawkeye is becoming more and more of an unperson as the days progress. \n"}, {"text": "Already on the edge, Hawkeye flips off the deep end when he discovers that he has been slashed from the army's payroll.  He takes his frustrations out on Frank, the man responsible for divvying out payments to the camp.  In the rather rousing brouhaha that follows, what item does Hawkeye stuff down Frank's shirt?", "correct": "Carrots", "options": ["Corned beef", "Creamed spinach", "Scrambled eggs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarrots.\n\n\tIn this surprisingly rough scene Hawkeye and Frank grapple over several tables before they settle at the lunch counter.  Hawkeye seizes this opportunity to give Frank '24-carrot underwear' (Frank hates carrots!) and a mashed potato facial.  When Hawkeye is restrained by two enlisted men, Frank shouts, 'Punch him in the throat!  Punch him in the throat!'  A pretty funny scene! \n"}, {"text": "Back in Colonel Potter's office, Hawkeye and the Colonel are visited by an army bureaucrat named Captain Pratt.  After listing the procedures for bringing Hawkeye back to life, which, of course, entails the filling out of way too many forms, Captain Pratt chuckles and classifies Hawkeye as an 'unperson'.  Which author (and book) does Pratt cite as the source of this term?", "correct": "George Orwell's '1984'", "options": ["Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World'", "Ray Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451'", "Kurt Vonnegut's 'Slaughterhouse Five'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Orwell's '1984'.\n\n\tCaptain Pratt, marvelously played by Elden Quick, lists the numerous forms Hawkeye will have to fill out and have signed by other officers (in triplicate).  They include 'a request to rescind the certificate of death on form ten-stroke-249, in triplicate, accompanied by an SF-88-stroke-11-0-7, signed by three officers of equal or higher rank, followed by a personal written report on form 63-stroke-E-B-Y by a ranking officer who actually saw the deceased not die, in triplicate'. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye is finally able to get a hold of his father by the end of the episode, but not before his father has apparently already sold which of Hawkeye's belongings?", "correct": "Golf clubs", "options": ["Motorcycle", "Television", "Radio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolf clubs.\n\n\tHawkeye 'gives up' after the conversation with Captain Pratt, packs his things and climbs on Digger's bus.  Instead of driving off to the morgue, however, the frustrated Hawkeye is talked off the bus by BJ.  In the end, Hawkeye is able to get a hold of his father, who tearfully tells Hawkeye that he has sold his golf clubs.  Hawkeye then asks his father if he could send him his 'allowance' again.  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other 'M*A*S*H' stuff. \n"}]}
