It returned for a third time, another ten weeks, before being ousted by our featured 1966 album, \"Aftermath\". Needless to say, after eight weeks at number one, it was replaced by, you've guessed it, \"The Sound of Music\" soundtrack. (In all the soundtrack would have eleven different runs at the top of the chart, finishing in January 1968.)\r \"Aftermath\" was the fourth UK studio album by the Rolling Stones (their sixth in the US).

It reached number two in the UK and failed to chart in the US. Meanwhile, their non-album single released about the same time, \"A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You\" made number two in the US and number three in the UK.
