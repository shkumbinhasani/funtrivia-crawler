While she stands in the shower trying to comprehend what's happening, the other girls in her class taunt and laugh at her, leading to a breakdown. Little do they know, Carrie White's telekinetic abilities are just starting to blossom as she hits puberty.  Carrie is sent home by the school principal (though he gets her name wrong repeatedly) and she returns to her Evangelical mother.  Unfortunately, there's no solace there; it's the first step down a treacherous path of sin. \n"}, {"text": "According to the stories, which of these fell on the White household when Carrie was a child?", "correct": "Large stones", "options": ["A plane", "Nuclear waste", "The wrath of God"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarge stones.\n\n\tCarrie, who was kept back from school by her mother for many years, never really dodged teasing over the years.  Made fun of by kids at Christian camp, Carrie used to be home-schooled until her mother's hand was forced.  She continued to face the insults and jeers of her peers up through high school.  What many in the neighbourhood knew was that something was seriously wrong at the White household.  When Carrie was a young girl, stones fell from the sky and onto the White house in the middle of August.\r Sue Snell, one of the girls in the locker room at the time of the teasing, tells her boyfriend, Tommy, that she regrets what she did.  Tommy convinces her that it might be worth apologizing, and a plan is set in motion. \n"}, {"text": "The girls who tease Carrie risk losing which of these by not complying to their punishment?", "correct": "Their prom tickets", "options": ["Their cars", "Their scholarships", "Their field trip"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir prom tickets.\n\n\tCarrie goes home ashamed and her mother, normally not home during school hours, comes home from work at the laundry early to beat her daughter.  Carrie blames her mother for not warning her of menstruation, but gets sent to the closet for talking back.  Fortunately for Carrie, her mother only keeps her locked in for a few hours, instead of days, as had been done in the past.\r The girls responsible for teasing Carrie are warned by their gym teacher, Miss Desjardin, that they could face three days of suspension and the refusal of their prom tickets if they don't take a week's detention with her.  Chris Hargensen decides to skip out on this, asking her father to legally contest the decision and claim that Miss Desjardin assaulted her.  The threat doesn't stick. \n"}, {"text": "Who asks Carrie to the Spring Ball?", "correct": "Tommy", "options": ["Chris", "Sue", "Billy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTommy.\n\n\tChris Hargensen, angry with the disciplinary actions set against her, confides in her boyfriend, Billy Nolan, that she wants to crash prom.  She tells the same thing to Sue, but doesn't get the response she hopes for because Sue has remorse for her actions.  Sue, understanding what she did was wrong, aims to rise above it and make it up to Carrie in some way.  Her solution ends up being to have her boyfriend, Tommy, ask Carrie to Spring Ball so she can feel included (as she says, it's an opportunity to make her a part of things).  He does ask her in class and, although she thinks it's a trick at first, she accepts his invitation.\r Carrie takes it upon herself to buy the fabric to make her own prom dress, opting to buy fancier material than normal for the occasion.  During dinner that night, however, when she tells her mother the news, she once again gets criticized and attacked.

This is when Carrie decides to take control, reaffirming that she will be attending prom with Tommy regardless of her mother's wishes.\r Sue, meanwhile, believes that her plan is going swimmingly.  With Tommy taking Carrie to the ball, she works on the decorating committee.  Chris, meanwhile, gets her hands on the Prom King and Queen ballots and hatches a scheme to get back at Carrie.  Her boyfriend, Billy, takes his friends out to the farms outside of town and puts this scheme into action, bringing a sledgehammer down on some pigs and filling buckets with their blood. \n"}, {"text": "Who suggests to Carrie that she burn her dress?", "correct": "Her mother", "options": ["Chris", "Sue", "Frieda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer mother.\n\n\tIt's the end of May when Carrie tries her dress on for the first time, right before the prom, and when she does, her mother walks in on her and suggests that she burn the dress so that they may repent.  Carrie refuses, forcing her mother out.\r When the time finally comes, Carrie prepares for the big event while her mother prays loudly elsewhere in the house.  Tommy arrives at her door to find her there, ready to go, and tells her that she looks beautiful.  Their arrival at the dance only boosts Carrie's self-esteem; she exhibits wit and beauty and her classmates are surprised to find out she's made her own gown.\r Chris and Billy, meanwhile, commit to their plan and leave their hotel room with the intent to enact revenge (pig blood for a pig, according to Billy).  The day before prom, Billy rigged the whole thing.  All it would take is a single tug of a rope. \n"}, {"text": "Carrie receives enough votes to be crowned Prom Queen.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAt home, Margaret White fears that her daughter is finally manifesting the Devil's Power and, knowing the potential of her abilities because her grandmother had the same, she grapples with the notion that a sacrifice will need to be made to save their souls.  She grabs a knife and prepares.\r At the dance, Carrie receives an apology from Miss Desjardin before the votes are cast for Prom King and Queen.  Though Carrie fears that she and Tommy may win because their names are on the ballot, the result is a tie.  What this does mean is that a run-off vote needs to be made, and while Carrie urges Tommy not to vote for them, it's his vote that tips the scales and allows them to win.  They head to the stage.\r Chris, backstage, bides her time and waits for her moment before pulling the rope.\rAt home, Sue, worried that she may have missed her own period, gets the awful feeling that she needs to look outside.

Though it's hard for them to figure out why, the students in the gymnasium start laughing at Carrie's misfortune, even going so far as to ridicule her and knock her over as she tries to flee.  It doesn't take long before she returns though, using her powers to lock the front doors and start the sprinkler system, drenching the room and shorting out the electrical music equipment onstage.  High voltage power lines rip apart, zapping people to death, while many of the students try to escape out the backstage exit.  Some get away, but many die when the oil tank blows.\r Sue heads out at 11:00pm, feeling the need to know more, and the school explodes while she's en route.  She makes it into the town of Chamberlain proper, but when she does, she skids off the road just in time to see the local Amoco gas station blow up.  After Carrie headed downtown, she unscrewed the lug nuts on the town's fire hydrants with her mind before freeing the gas pumps.  Someone's cigarette was all the spark it needed to go up. \n"}, {"text": "Whose knife blow eventually spells the end for Carrie White?", "correct": "Her mother's", "options": ["Sue's", "Chris'", "Miss Desjardin's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer mother's.\n\n\tOfficer Doyle, Chamberlain's police chief, comes across both Sue and Vic Morrow in the downtown streets and confirms that all of the chaos is the work of Carrie White just as another gas station explodes.  Somehow, everyone in town seems to know that Carrie is the cause, even if they don't know her personally, and they all seem to be attracted by her influence.  An open gas main causes another explosion before Carrie goes to pray at a church.\r Carrie's rampage through town leads her home where her mother, waiting for her in the kitchen with a knife, makes her intentions clear.  Though she stabs her daughter in the shoulder, it's not enough to kill Carrie, and because of this, Carrie stops her heart with her mind.\r Chris and Billy, who fell asleep after their plan was a success, wake up to silence outside, though they are quickly brought up to speed about the nightmare unfolding.  They head out to their car but come face to face with Carrie who takes control and crashes their Chevy into a pole, rupturing the fuel tank and setting them ablaze. \n"}, {"text": "Carrie's retaliation is responsible for how many deaths in the town of Chamberlain?", "correct": "More than four hundred", "options": ["One hundred fifty", "Three dozen", "Seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMore than four hundred.\n\n\tDespite Carrie's meandering reign of terror through Chamberlain and despite her jilting car crash, Sue followed the telekinetic teenager through the woods with her mind alone, arriving at the hotel where Carrie crashed Chris and Billy's vehicle to find her lying on the pavement with the knife in her shoulder.  Sue reaches Carrie just as she comes out of unconsciousness and the two search through each other's minds with Carrie digging through Sue's inner thoughts.  Carrie finds that Sue has never wished her any ill will, but she can't seem to come to grips with the truth before she dies, only a few hours after the nightmare started.\r More than four hundred people die in Chamberlain due to Carrie's influence.  As a result, many leave the city due to the aftermath of the event.
