It didn't matter - the timer stopped a 0:01 anyways, just like in their TV show.  What movie was it?", "correct": "Galaxy Quest", "options": ["Big Trouble", "Fanboys", "Spaceballs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGalaxy Quest.\n\n\tAlso starring Alan Rickman and Tony Shaloub, \"Galaxy Quest\" followed the story of a group of actors who once filmed a sci-fi show (many years earlier).  When their captain, played by Tim Allen, was contacted by aliens who needed help to defeat an evil force, they had no choice but to help out (they DID get sucked into a wormhole at one point).  At one point, the evil Sarris planted a bomb on their ship and both Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver had to navigate its interior in order to stop it.  This was all for nothing anyways - just as in their show, the bomb would've stopped at 0:01.  The makers of their ship followed the show to the finest details.\r\"Galaxy Quest\" was directed by Dean Parisot (who also did \"Fun With Dick and Jane\" in 2005) and earned over $90,000,000 in the box office.  Quite simply, it was well-received by audiences, critics, and \"Star Trek\" actors (who were clearly mocked) alike.\r ...10. \n"}, {"text": "Trapped in a containment dome, the citizens of one town needed to simply await their doom by timed bomb in this long-awaited 2007 movie.  The bomb exploded, but not before being tossed outside the dome by the main character and his son, while riding aboard a motorcycle.  What animated feature was it?", "correct": "The Simpsons Movie", "options": ["South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut", "Family Guy presents Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story", "Beavis and Butt-head Do America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Simpsons Movie.\n\n\t\"The Simpsons Movie\" was extremely well-received upon its release.  With the show approaching its twentieth year by the time the film was released, its expectations varied for viewers, but earning over $500,000,000 in the box office, it was a hit.  In the film, a nearby lake was polluted by toxic wastes.  When Homer's actions caused the town to be quarantined in a large dome, the family was forced to flee (and they escaped through a sinkhole).  Eventually, the plan was to bomb the inside of the dome, wiping everything out.  Homer and Bart boarded a motorcycle in one last attempt to save Springfield - and they did.\r ...9. \n"}, {"text": "Winner of a 'Best Picture' Oscar, this 2009 film was about a bomb disposal unit during the Iraq War.

It beat James Cameron's \"Avatar\" in 'Best Picture' and 'Best Director' (making Bigelow, Cameron's ex-wife, the first female director to win the award).  \"The Hurt Locker\" was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival (though it premiered in Venice) and it followed a group of EODs as they diffused live bombs in Iraq during wartime.\r ...8. \n"}, {"text": "In this film, the timer wasn't so much counting down a bomb as it was sealing off an infection.  With mere hours to spare, Umbrellas workers needed to head into 'The Hive', an underground facility, to reboot a mainframe.  Zombies were involved.  What was this 2002 movie?", "correct": "Resident Evil", "options": ["28 Day Later", "The Crazies", "Dawn of the Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResident Evil.\n\n\tStarring Milla Jovovich and directed by her husband, Paul W. S. Anderson, \"Resident Evil\" loosely followed the plot of the original game in the series of the same name.  Set in an underground facility known as The Hive, the major pharmaceutical company, Umbrella Corporation, accidentally created a toxin that could regenerate dead human tissue.  Evidently no one read the memo (Re: zombies).  A group was sent in to reboot the place but that simply let the zombies loose.  What followed was a mad dash to the surface and a number of sequels starring Jovovich as Alice, a character left unseen in the games and novel tie-ins.  \"Resident Evil\" also starred Michelle Rodriguez and earned over $100,000,000 in its first film.  The game series was first created by Capcom in 1996.  Clearly, Jovovich got out before the timer hit zero; she appeared in the next movies.\r ...7. \n"}, {"text": "Project Vulcan was well underway in the end of this 1997 Mike Myers film.  As a drill was being sent to the center of the Earth to cause all of Earth's volcanoes to erupt, it was imperative that the protagonist of the movie hit the abort button at the last moment.

Struck with the shock of awakening outside the groovy 1960s, Powers needed to acclimate himself to the modern world and prevent Evil's 'Project Vulcan' from being completed.  In the end of the film, Powers was able to successfully press the abort button.  The \"Austin Powers\" series revisited this final countdown motif in \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" and \"Goldmember\".\r\"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" was released in 1997 and earned almost $70,000,000 in the box office.

Starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, what movie was it?", "correct": "Speed", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpeed.\n\n\t\"Speed\" was an early action film role for emotionless robot Keanu Reeves (who did act in many movies before...including \"Point Break\"), Sandra Bullock, and the late Dennis Hopper.  In \"Speed\", Keanu Reeves boarded a bus with a bomb affixed to the bottom and fought to keep it going in the Los Angeles streets.  A slew of events later, Bullock also ended up with a bomb strapped to her chest.  Planes exploded, buses exploded, houses exploded, trains derailed...it was an expensive day for L.A.  \"Speed\" took home $350,000,000 (to pay for damages?) and it constituted a bad sequel set on a boat: \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\".  Reeves didn't come back, Bullock did.\r ...5. \n"}, {"text": "Jeff Bridges, playing a university professor, suspected that his neighbours (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack) were terrorists in this 1999 movie.

His neighbours, Robbins and Cusack, weren't so easy to read but the signs were there.
