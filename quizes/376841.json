In which ancient sport does one of the gentleman pilgrims on horseback participate?", "correct": "Falconry", "options": ["Drinking", "Tennis", "Cards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalconry.\n\n\tThis is an often overlooked, but nevertheless iconic scene in British cinema.  The gentleman releases his falcon, following it skywards with his eyes.  As the now distant falcon wheels around in the sky, we are suddenly transported forward by six hundred years, the bird becoming a Spitfire fighter aircraft which swoops into a dive and roars over the head of a helmeted soldier played, incidentally, by the same actor who played the gentleman pilgrim. This scene reinforces the basic tenet of this film; the thread of continuity and the relationship between the modern world and its medieval counterpart. \n"}, {"text": "Which bespectacled British actor, who went on to enjoy a long career as a member of the 'Carry On' film series team, plays the role of Chillingbourne station master?", "correct": "Charles Hawtrey", "options": ["Michael Caine", "Sidney James", "Laurence Olivier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles Hawtrey.\n\n\t\"Chillingbourne!

Hawtrey enjoyed considerable success as a member of the 'Carry On' team during the 1960s and 1970s with his last appearance in the 1972 film 'Carry On Abroad'.  Hawtrey was a heavy smoker and an even heavier drinker and it was the drinking that put an end to a successful career.  He spent a number of years performing in regional pantomime before descending into virtual obscurity.  After breaking his leg it was discovered that he was seriously ill with vascular disease and after refusing to have his legs amputated in order to save his life, Hawtrey died on the 27th of October 1988 at the age of 73. \n"}, {"text": "Land Girl Alison Smith becomes the latest victim of an unusual assault on her arrival in Chillingbourne.

Bob Johnson believing that the glue man may be dangerous asks Sergeant Bassett if he has a gun only to be told \"This is Chillingbourne, Sergeant Johnson, not Chicago\".

Johnson protests that he must travel to Canterbury the following morning to meet a comrade who is travelling from London to see him whilst they are both on furlough, but he eventually relents and agrees to help her where he can.  Whilst dressing the following morning, Johnson discovers that he is being watched through his window by a young local lad standing atop an enormous hay cart.
