{"id": "112302", "name": "Ultimate LOTR - 'The Two Towers' Part 3 Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "J. R. R. Tolkien", "The Two Towers"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of book four of the trilogy (part two of 'The Two Towers', for those keeping score) Frodo and Sam are making their way over a certain mountain range on their way to Mordor.  What is the name of this treacherous, bald mountain range?  \n", "correct": "Emyn Muil", "options": ["Ered Nimrais", "Iron Hills", "Hithaeglir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmyn Muil.\n\n\tThe Emyn Muil range lies between the River Anduin and the Dead Marshes, towards which Sam and Frodo are headed.  The mountains are dull and lifeless and provide little refuge for our diminutive friends as they trudge slowly toward the evil domain of Sauron.  Of course, the 'Stinker' Gollum slowly stalks the two hobbits and is captured on the way down the opposite side of the range. \n"}, {"text": "After Sam and Frodo capture Gollum, who has been stalking them since they descended into Moria, they agree to spare his life.  However they place a condition on Gollum, he must lead them on the road to Mordor.  Gollum strenuously objects to their plan, but agrees grudgingly since he has no other choice.  To which of these does Gollum also desperately object?  \n", "correct": "Being tied up by neck or foot", "options": ["Leading them along without the moon or sun in the sky", "Finding food and water for the hobbits", "Acknowledging Frodo as his 'master'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeing tied up by neck or foot.\n\n\tActually, Gollum is more than happy to call Frodo 'master', and a little competition between himself and Sam begins soon after.  He also does not object to gathering food, though the types of food he finds palatable don't appeal to Frodo and Sam.  Gollum also actually prefers to move in the evening with no moon present, nixing that choice.  What Gollum does not like is to be tied up, and he screams horribly when Sam approaches him with the rope.  In the end, the 'Slinker' gets what he desires...freedom of mobility. \n"}, {"text": "Sam and Frodo, led by their new-found 'tour guide' Gollum, trudge slowly through the festering and noisome Dead Marshes with Mordor all the while on the horizon.  Nearly having emerged from the fulsome swamp, the hobbits take a rest while Gollum carries on a conversation with himself.  While Sam feigns sleep, what word does he hear from Gollum that is most troubling? \n", "correct": "She", "options": ["Murder", "Precious", "Fish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe.\n\n\tIf you'll recall, following Gollum's solo, multi-personalitied soliloquy Sam recognizes Gollum's 'he' as the Dark Lord Sauron, but he is concerned about a mysterious 'she'.  Who could 'she' be, Sam wonders...but he won't have to wonder long!  Gollum doesn't mention murder, which would obviously be troubling, but he does mention the 'Precious' and 'fish', his two favorite items.  The poor little shriveled fellow seems obsessed with both! \n"}, {"text": "Gollum leads the two hobbits to the 'Black Gate' of Mordor, just at the point where the two great mountain ranges, the Ered Lithui from the west and the Ephel Duath from the south, come in conjunction.  This great gate is guarded by Orcs and is apparently not accessible to our little friends, nor are the surrounding cliffs surmountable by any means.  What is the name of the great gate that brings the hobbits to an impasse?  \n", "correct": "Morannon", "options": ["Henneth Annun", "Durthang", "Cirith Ungol"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorannon.\n\n\tOf course Gollum knows that there is no way the hobbits can pass the gate, and hence he suggests an alternate 'way'.  This new pathway will lead them not over the mountains, but rather under them to dark corridors far below the surface of the impenetrable mountains, where they will meet...wait, stay tuned! \n"}, {"text": "Bypassing the gates, the two hobbits decide to follow Gollum, who has suggested an alternate path into Mordor.  On the way along this different road, the hobbits become hungry and Sam requests that Gollum catch a couple of rabbits, or coneys as he calls them.  Gollum returns soon after with two little rabbits, much to Sam's delight.  Sam is also able to find some herbs with which he can cook the rabbit, but which other item does he wish for, to complete a wonderful stew?  \n", "correct": "Potatoes", "options": ["Mushrooms", "Tomatoes", "Bread"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPotatoes.\n\n\tSam is fond of taters, and offers to stew some up for Gollum.  A disgusted Gollum rejects Sam's offer, and further, refuses to help Sam gather up herbs and search for some spuds in the surrounding area.  Sam senses Gollum's disgust and further rubs it in by offering to fry up some fish and chips for the unhappy little creature Gollum.  Naturally, Gollum is mortified by the idea of anything but raw fish!  After this exchange, Sam completes the preparation of the meal, and he and Frodo share their last feast  before entering the evil land of Mordor. \n"}, {"text": "Soon after finishing their meal, Sam and Frodo are discovered by a small troop of men led by Faramir, brother of Boromir.  After a quick exchange, where it is revealed to the two parties their link, Faramir is off to battle.  Left with the two hobbits for protection are a couple of Faramir's soldiers, Mablung and Damrod.  Together, they witness the approach of an army of 'Southrons' (enemy men from the South), some of whom are aboard which animals, to Sam's delight?  \n", "correct": "Oliphaunts", "options": ["Mastodonters", "Cameleopards", "Pegasusi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOliphaunts.\n\n\tSam had just been discussing the topic of oliphaunts in the prior chapter with Frodo and Gollum, and recited words from a poem, of which here are some: 'Grey as a mouse, big as a house, nose like a snake, I make the earth shake...but old oliphaunt am I, and I never lie.'  Hmm...sounds like an elephant to me!  Regardless, Sam is thrilled to death that he catches sight of the beasts, nearly as exhilarated as when he first caught glimpse of an elf! \n"}, {"text": "Once again the hobbits meet up with Faramir, freshly returned from battle against the Southrons.  Faramir is curious about Frodo's quest and what he terms 'Isildur's Bane'.  Eventually through surmising, and Sam's big mouth, he at last understands the truth of Frodo's quest.  True or false: At this point, Faramir, like his brother Boromir, attempts to acquire the ring from Frodo.  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tFaramir is very much unlike his brother, level-headed and patient, and would never attempt to foolishly wrest the ring from Frodo.  A quote from Faramir, \"I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway.  Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory.\"  Not only does Faramir not seek the ring from Frodo, though it is at his grasp, he treats Frodo and Sam to provisions and helps direct them back along the path to Mordor.  Thus, Boromir is redeemed by his brother! \n"}, {"text": "After departing from the secret hideout of Faramir and his men, Gollum leads the hobbits anew along the path south towards Minas Morgul and the secret entrance to Mordor.  Just west of Minas Morgul the travellers reach a crossroads where their road meets the road west to Osgiliath.  What interesting site do they encounter as this junction?  \n", "correct": "A giant stone figure", "options": ["A white tree", "A ruined citadel", "An Elfstone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA giant stone figure.\n\n\tThe giant, seated stone figure that they encounter was one of a king, reminiscent of the Argonath that Frodo witnessed along the River Anduin.  Unlike the Argonath, however, this figure had been defiled.  Its head had been removed and replaced with another stone, roughly hewn and painted with the red eye of Sauron.  Sam notices that, though the original head had been toppled, lovely vegetation had afforded it with a beautiful new makeshift crown, a sign of good portent.  This is the last site they visit before heading into Mordor... \n"}, {"text": "Deep in the direction of Cirith Ungol takes Gollum his hobbit followers, and unbeknownst to them, into a hideous trap.  Gollum's path leads Sam and Frodo into a murky tunnel with an unbearable stench, ever leading downwards into the Earth.  Whose lair have the hobbits unwittingly entered?  \n", "correct": "Shelob", "options": ["Shagrat", "The Witch King", "Gorbag"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShelob.\n\n\tAt last we know who 'she' is...Shelob is rather like the Queen of the spiders, an ancient, awful creature not even beholden to Sauron himself.  To ward her off, Frodo draws forth the phial of Galadriel, whose light Shelob despises.  In the end, though Frodo is captured and attacked by Shelob and poor Sam is left to believe his Master has perished! \n"}, {"text": "Sam, believing Frodo to be dead after their nasty confrontation with the evil lurker in the tunnel, decides he must continue the quest to destroy the ring.  He takes the ring from Frodo, along with Galadriel's phial and Sting.  Sam has become a ringbearer...but does he ever try the ring on?  \n", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tSam places the ring on his finger soon after removing it from around Frodo's neck in order to save himself from the Orc troops who are entering Shelob's cavern.  Sam seems fascinated by the effects that the ring has on him, but will he abandon his Master and carry on with this burden?
