{"id": "181965", "name": "Atheism and Agnosticism Quiz | Atheism and Agnosticism | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", " Atheism and Agnosticism"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the difference between an atheist and an agnostic?", "correct": "The atheist does not believe there is a God; the agnostic believes that we do not or cannot know if God exists.", "options": ["There is no real difference.", "The atheist does not believe there is a God, the agnostic isn't sure if he believes in God.", "Atheists are against all religion; agnostics are accepting of religion."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe atheist does not believe there is a God; the agnostic believes that we do not or cannot know if God exists.\n\n\tThe meanings can be determined by looking at the derivations of the words. The prefix \"a\" means \"not\" or \"without\"; \"theist\" refers to belief in God; \"gnostic\" comes from a Greek root meaning \"to know\". Therefore, the atheist is without God; the agnostic is without knowledge. \n"}, {"text": "Atheism is a religion.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDespite this quiz being housed in the Religion section, atheism is not a religion! A religion, by definition, requires belief in the influence of supernatural beings upon humans. As some atheist humorists have joked, atheists will be glad to consider atheism a religion as soon as they get the tax breaks accorded in the US to churches!\rA great quote on this subject is from the Atheism Web-http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/intro.html\r\"The point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn't atheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by \"religious\". \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.\r (It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not \"religion\" according to such a definition.)\r Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense. Widening the definition of \"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behavior suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.\" \n"}, {"text": "Now, let's look at some practical consequences of the philosophies of atheism and agnosticism. Studies have shown that atheists tend to be less moral than religious people.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, studies have shown that atheists tend to be as moral as religious folk. Some studies have even shown that atheists were more moral than people with religious beliefs. In general, atheists tend to take morality and ethics seriously, as they have to think about and question standards of morality, rather than accepting a prefabricated viewpoint. \n"}, {"text": "An acceptable part of atheism, for most atheists, is belittling and ridiculing religion, especially Christianity. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlthough a vocal minority take it upon themselves to condemn all religion publicly, most atheists favor religious tolerance- for *all* religions. A good discussion of this topic is at http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/ath/blathm_god_hate.htm \n"}, {"text": "Studies have shown that people with higher IQs are less likely to be religious.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tQuite a few such studies have been done. For example, Southern and Plant interviewed 72 MENSA members (a high-IQ group) in the United States and found that they were much less likely to be religious than average Americans. A survey of scientists by the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S. showed that 93% disbelieved in the concept of a personal God. \n"}, {"text": "Do atheists usually become atheists because they hate God?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAs written on a web page at the \"Ebon Musings\" site, http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/intro.html- \"I'm not an atheist because I hate God. To hate God I would first have to believe in him, and then I wouldn't be an atheist anymore.\" In short, you cannot hate something that you don't believe in. Atheists may deplore the damage that organized religion has done to the world, but they do not hate God. \n"}, {"text": "Atheists are by necessity nihilists; they do not believe in God, thus they cannot believe that life has purpose or meaning.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, atheists tend to be less nihilistic than many believers. They feel that they are free- free to believe in the power of compassion and right action to change the world, and free of the fetters that organized religion can place on action. In atheist philosophy, when humans are good, it is because they *freely choose* to be good, fully cognizant of their actions and their results, rather than unthinkingly following dogma. \n"}, {"text": "Many studies have shown that atheists are more likely to be clinically depressed than people of strong religious faith. ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlthough some studies exist that claim that regular churchgoers are less likely to be depressed than non-churchgoers, these studies do not differentiate between atheists and people who simply do not go to church. They also do not control for other factors that could explain the lesser rate of depression in churchgoers (such as the possibility that churchgoers have a broader social network, which can lessen the chances of depression.) What limited studies that have been done on atheists suggest that they are no more likely to be clinically depressed (and are perhaps less likely) than regular churchgoers.\n"}, {"text": "Most members of the US National Academy of Sciences are atheists.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tA 1998 survey of the members of the US National Academy of Sciences, probably the most preeminent scientific body in the US, found that 72% of members were atheists and 21% agnostics. Only 7% considered themselves religious. \n"}, {"text": "Charles Darwin, although claiming to be an atheist during his life, recanted on his deathbed and accepted religion.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis persistent rumor was coined by one Lady Hope, who claimed to have been present at Darwin's deathbed. The myth was debunked by many who really were there, including Darwin's daughter Henrietta, but it still circulates today. Darwin described his own views as agnostic. \n"}, {"text": "Adolf Hitler was an openly-avowed atheist.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThere is no firm evidence that Hitler was an atheist.  He often made statements that indicated his religious views. http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/quotes_hitler.html is one of many websites that document Hitler's views. \n"}, {"text": "Which American president, in an interview with the press, stated, \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God\"?", "correct": "George H. W. Bush", "options": ["George W. Bush", "Gerald Ford", "Ronald Reagan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush\n\n\tBush Sr. made this comment in 1987, in Chicago, Illinois, while on the campaign trail, to reporter Robert Sherman of American Atheists. \n"}, {"text": "Who stated, \"I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.\"?", "correct": "Albert Einstein", "options": ["Stephen Hawking", "Marie Curie", "Charles Darwin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlbert Einstein.\n\n\tEinstein wrote this in a letter in 1954. http://jeromekahn123.tripod.com/thinkersonreligion/id8.html has a good discussion of the misconception that Einstein was a religious man. \n"}, {"text": "Who said, in response to a question on his religious beliefs, \"I find enough mystery in mathematics to satisfy my spiritual needs.\"?", "correct": "Tom Lehrer", "options": ["Richard Feynman", "Steven Jay Gould", "Niels Bohr"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Lehrer.\n\n\tMany people do not realize that Lehrer, more widely known for his satirical and comical songs such as \"Be Prepared\" and \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" was a mathematics professor. In the interview, he went on to state, \"I think, for example, that pi is mysterious enough (don't get me started!) without having to worry about God. Or if pi isn't enough, how about fractals? Or quantum mechanics?\" \n"}, {"text": "In the United States, what organization bars atheists from joining?", "correct": "Boy Scouts of America", "options": ["Future Farmers of America", "Campfire Boys and Girls", "All of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoy Scouts of America.\n\n\tThe BSA also prohibited gays before 2014. The BSA's official resolution, which can be viewed at http://www.scouting.org/media/press/020206/resolution.html, has such comments as:\r\"The national officers agree with the report that 'duty to God is not a mere ideal for those choosing to associate with the Boy Scouts of America; it is an obligation.'\"\r\"The Boy Scouts of America has made a commitment 'to provide faith-based values to its constituency in a respectful manner.'\" \n"}]}
