{"id": "366447", "name": "Fictional Cover Songs Quiz | Entertainment Grab Bag | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Entertainment Grab Bag", "Entertainment Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Hey, I just met you, but here is our tale.\nTo find a big fish, and call me Ishmael.\"\n\nIf Ishmael were to sing a song, surely this is how it would begin. What whale would interest Ishmael, and which singer sang the original song used for the basis of this rendition?", "correct": "Moby Dick, Carly Rae Jepsen", "options": ["Monstro, Taylor Swift", "Jonah's Big Fish, Lorde", "Shamu, Adele"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoby Dick, Carly Rae Jepsen.\n\n\t\"Call me Ishmael\" is perhaps one of the most widely recognized opening lines of any literary work. The three simple words are found at the beginning of \"Moby-Dick\", written by Herman Melville and published in 1851. The narrator, Ishmael, recalls a journey of Ahab's revenge on a white whale, named, of course, Moby Dick.\r Carly Rae Jepsen released her single \"Call Me Maybe\" in 2011, and the song was a smashing success (though quite the annoying earworm for many). It is found on her extended play album \"Curiosity\", as well as her album \"Kiss\", both released in 2012. The original lyrics of \"Call Me Maybe\" is found below.\r \"Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy.\rBut here's my number, so call me maybe.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Want to know how I got these scars? Well, I'll tell you. The first cut was the deepest, believe me, I know.\"\n\nThis rendition is a bit more morbid than the original, but the darker lyrics fit Batman's rival perfectly. Which of these would have created the above lyrics, and who sang the song originally?", "correct": "The Joker, Cat Stevens", "options": ["The Riddler, Carl Perkins", "The Penguin, Chubby Checker", "Catwoman, Etta James"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Joker, Cat Stevens.\n\n\tThe Joker is a major nemesis of Batman, and first appeared in the comic \"Batman #1\" in 1940. In \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), The Joker, played by Heath Ledger, had a myriad of memorable lines, including \"Wanna know how I got these scars?\", \"Why so serious?\", and \"I'm going to make this pencil... disappear.\" Ledger's brilliant performance skyrocketed the Joker's ranking on many \"best villains\" lists; in 2014, \"Total Film\" called him the greatest movie villain ever.\r \"The First Cut is the Deepest\" was originally written by Cat Stevens in 1967. P. P. Arnold released it early that year, but Cat Stevens also released his version in late 1967. It is found on his album \"New Masters\". The original lyrics for this song are found below.\r \"The first cut is the deepest, baby I know.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Just because it burns, you're gonna die, it doesn't mean.\nDo or do not, there is no try, try, try.\nDo or do not, there is no try, try, try.\"\n\nWiser words have never been spoken. A master Jedi has decided to make a fictional cover of a pop icon's song. Which powerful Jedi is it, and who is the pop star?", "correct": "Yoda, P!nk", "options": ["Obi-Wan Kenobi, Lady Gaga", "Luke Skywalker, Ke$ha", "Plo Koon, Nicki Minaj"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoda, P!nk.\n\n\tYoda is a grand master Jedi from the \"Star Wars\" universe, first appearing in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980). He is an old, short creature who talks in a strange grammatical way, unique to his species. For instance, in \"Return of the Jedi\", he tells Luke \"At 900 years of age, look as good, you will not, hmm?\" In the fictional cover song, his famous line from \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is used - \"Do or do not, there is no try.\" My personal favorite line of Yoda's is from \"Attack of the Clones\". When rescuing the remaining Jedi he says \"Around the survivors a perimeter create.\"\r \"Try\" was released as a single in 2012 by P!nk. It can be found on her sixth album, \"The Truth About Love\". It sounds much more grammatically correct than Yoda's version. The original lyrics are below.\r \"Just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die.\rYou gotta get up and try, try, try.\rGotta get up and try, try, try.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Ruh roh, I did it again. I solve mysteries, but got lost in a maze!\nOh Raggy, Raggy.\"\n\nThis fictional canine with a ferocious appetite is attempting his own version of a well known song by a pop singer. Who is the dog, and who sang the original lyrics?", "correct": "Scooby-Doo, Britney Spears", "options": ["Goofy, Hillary Duff", "Marmaduke, Jessica Simpson", "Snoopy, Lily Allen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScooby-Doo, Britney Spears.\n\n\tScooby-Doo is a fictional dog who first appeared in \"What's New, Scooby-Doo?\" in 1969. His name is derived from the \"doo-bee-doo-bee-doo\" section of \"Strangers in the Night\" by Frank Sinatra. Scooby-Doo, along with his owner and four of their friends, solve mysteries using their van, which they call the Mystery Machine. The \"Raggy, Raggy\" part is in reference to Scooby-Doo's owner, Shaggy. You see, Scooby-Doo cannot quite pronounce Shaggy's name; but he is a talking dog, after all, so did you expect his English to be perfect?\r \"Oops!... I Did it Again\" was released in 2000 by Britney Spears, and can be found on her 2000 album of the same name. The song was a big hit, and soon became one of her most widely recognized hits (and remained as such for over a decade). The original lyrics to the song parodied by Scooby-Doo are found below.\r \"Oops, I did it again. I played with your heart, got lost in the game.\rOh baby, baby.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"I'm gonna pop some tags, onwy got twenty dowwars in my pocket.\nI-I'm a hunting wabbits, wooking for a come-up.\nThis is weawwy awesome.\"\n\nMispronouncing the Rs and Ls is common for this character, who has decided to sing his own version of a hip hop song! Who is the fictional character, and whose song has he decided to take on?", "correct": "Elmer Fudd, Macklemore", "options": ["Yosemite Sam, Gym Class Heroes", "Taz, Eminem", "Marvin the Martian, Nelly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElmer Fudd, Macklemore.\n\n\tElmer Fudd is a Looney Tunes character who first appeared in 1940 in the animated short \"Elmer's Candid Camera\". It is believed, however, that Elmer was originally known as Egghead, in which case his first appearance would have been in 1937 in \"Egghead Rides Again\". Elmer Fudd is vewwy vewwy famous for his speech impediment, in which most of his Rs and Ls become Ws. In early episodes, this was used extensively, and some famous lines include \"Be vewwy vewwy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits\", and \"what wight thwough yonduh window bweaks\". The speech of Elmer Fudd is so well known that Google has one language translation set to \"Elmer Fudd\".\r \"Thrift Shop\" is a comedy hip hop song released in 2012 by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. It was a single on their debut album, \"The Heist\", in 2012. The song reached number one in several countries, including the US, UK, and Canada. In August of 2012, a music video for the song was released, and between its release and January of 2014, the video had been watched on YouTube almost 500 million times, making it (at that time) the 14th most watched YouTube video. The original lyrics are not quite as humorous as with \"Elmer-Speak\", but still funny nonetheless.\r \"I'm gonna pop some tags, only got twenty dollars in my pocket.\rI'm-I'm a huntin', looking for a come-up.\rThis is really awesome.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"I told you, Frodo (one does not simply touch this).\nYes, that is how we are living and you know (one does not simply touch this).\"\n\nThis fictional \"Lord of the Rings\" remix of a popular song would be sung by which character, and who was the artist of the original lyrics?", "correct": "Boromir, MC Hammer", "options": ["Aragorn, Vanilla Ice", "Faramir, LL Cool J", "Isildur, Snoop Dogg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoromir, MC Hammer.\n\n\tBoromir is a human character of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. He is found in the first two books (\"The Fellowship of the Ring\" [1954] and \"The Two Towers\" [1955]). In Peter Jackson's 2001 film, \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", Boromir is portrayed by Sean Bean. In the film, Boromir makes a comment that \"one does not simply walk into Mordor.\" The phrase became a popular internet meme, being called the \"one does not simply\" meme.\r \"U Can't Touch This\" is a catchy (albeit annoying and repetitive) hip-hop single released by MC Hammer in 1990. It is found on the 1990 album \"Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em\". The song became one of MC Hammer's biggest and most widely recognized hits. The original lyrics to the song can be found below.\r \"I told you, homeboy (You can't touch this).\rYeah, that's how we living and you know (You can't touch this).\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Here's the key to my heart. Effie, I volunteer.\nBut please, don't take the girl.\"\n\nA truly amazing \"Hunger Games\" character volunteered to take someone else's place in the Hunger Games, saving their little sister from the Games' horrors. Who would have done so, singing the new lyrics above, and who sang the actual version of the song?", "correct": "Katniss Everdeen, Tim McGraw", "options": ["Peeta Mellark, Kenny Chesney", "Haymitch Abernathy, Alan Jackson", "Gale Hawthorne, Toby Keith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKatniss Everdeen, Tim McGraw.\n\n\tKatniss Everdeen first appeared in Suzanne Collins' novel \"The Hunger Games\" (the first of a trilogy) in 2008. Originally, Effie Trinket called her younger sister, Primrose, as the select female to take place in a child's deathmatch called the \"Hunger Games\". Distraught by the thought of such terrible things possibly happening to her sister, Katniss rose to the occasion to say \"I volunteer,\" and it was she instead who was whisked away to 'play' the games. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed Katniss in four films based on the \"Hunger Games\" trilogy. My favorite quote (as well as many other's favorite) of the trilogy is \"May the odds be ever in your favor.\"\r Tim McGraw's number one country hit \"Don't Take the Girl\" was released in 1994. It was found on his album \"Not a Moment Too Soon\", released only six days prior to the mentioned single. It's a fairly sad song, only made sadder when adding the volunteering of Katniss to the mix. The original lyrics to the song can be found below.\r \"Here's the key to my car. Mister, give it a whirl.\rBut please, don't take the girl.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"I'm at payphone, try phone... home...\nAll change spent on you.\"\n\nThis little alien really only said a few words throughout the film he was in, but the simple phrase became iconic. The phrase is used in the above fictional cover song. Who was the alien, and whose song is he covering?", "correct": "E.T, Maroon 5", "options": ["Optimus Prime, Staind", "The Doctor, U2", "Chewbacca, Nirvana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nE.T, Maroon 5\n\n\tE.T. is an alien who is found in the film \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", released in 1982. The lovable alien was stranded on earth by his fellow aliens, and befriended a boy named Elliot. He would constantly say \"E.T. phone home,\" which Elliot at first did not understand. E.T, however, was trying to contact his alien brethren, and, naturally, by the end of the film, was successfully able to 'phone home.'\r Maroon 5 similarly tried to 'phone home' in their 2012 hit single \"Payphone\". The song can be found on their 2012 album \"Overexposed.\" The original lyrics to the song, sung by Maroon 5 and not by E.T, are below.\r \"I'm at a payphone, trying to call home.\rAll of my change I spent on you.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"It's the eye of the liger, it's pretty much my favorite animal.\nRising up to the challenge of our rival, gosh.\"\n\nThe character responsible for this fictional cover song is from a movie bearing his name; who is he, and who sang the original song?", "correct": "Napoleon Dynamite, Survivor", "options": ["Scott Pilgrim, Kansas", "Nacho Libre, Tesla", "Benjamin Button, Aerosmith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNapoleon Dynamite, Survivor.\n\n\tNapoleon Dynamite is the main character of the film \"Napoleon Dynamite\", released in 2004. The overall film is strange, but the endless number of hilarious quotes make up for it. Among my personal favorite quotes from Napoleon himself are \"Whatever I feel like I want to do, gosh!\", \"Shocks, pegs, lucky,\" and the quote that inspired the fictional cover song, \"A liger. It's pretty much my favorite animal. It's like a lion and a tiger mixed, bred for its skills in magic.\"\r \"Eye of the Tiger\" was released in 1982 by the rock band Survivor. It first appeared on the \"Rocky III Original Soundtrack\" as a single in 1982, and released shortly thereafter on Survivor's own album, \"Eye of the Tiger\" (also 1982). The original lyrics are below.\r \"It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight.\rRising up to the challenge of our rival.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Hold on loosely, I'll never let go.\nIf you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control.\"\n\nAs she let go of Jack's hand, she promised him she'd never let go. What was the name of this fictional girl, and whose song is she covering in the above lyrics?", "correct": "Rose, .38 Special", "options": ["Lily, UB40", "Daisy, Blink-182", "Holly, Matchbox 20"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRose, .38 Special\n\n\tKate Winslet portrayed Rose DeWitt Bukater in 1997. Rose was a fictional character from the film \"Titanic\", which was, of course, about a real life event. Near the end of the film, she told her newfound love, Jack Dawson, that she would never let go, as he froze in the water and she floated on debris. Jack did not survive, though Rose survived to tell her tale of the sinking of the Titanic.\r .38 Special released their single \"Hold on Loosely\" in 1981 (a personal favorite of mine, though it only reached #27 on Billboard charts). It is found on their 1981 album \"Wild-Eyed Southern Boys\". The original lyrics are below.\r \"Hold on loosely, and don't let go.\rIf you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control.\" \n"}]}
