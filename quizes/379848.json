The novel's full title is 'El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha' (\"The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha\"). The first part was published in 1605 and the second in 1615. Between the two, Cervantes even had time to write a series of twelve short stories, published as \"Novelas ejemplares\" in 1613. \r In the ensuing four centuries, \"Don Quixote\" has been adapted many times, including nine opera (the most famous by Mendelssohn), for five ballets, for orchestral works (including by Purcell and Richard Strauss), for a stage musical (in 1965 and called \"Man of La Mancha\") and a 1966 film adaptation of the musical. \r So influential is the author that Spanish is often today referred to as \"The Language of Cervantes\".
