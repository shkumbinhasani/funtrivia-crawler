There are twelve on the top and twelve on the bottom.

With it, even though she was defeated, she is still powerful.  Once she is on the ground, Murray and Bentley team up to get the chip from her mouth.  Once you do this, she explodes.  The explosion does not destroy the Clockwerk parts, as they remained almost perfect, eternal.  However, since the Hate Chip has been removed, age starts to catch up with the mechanical owl, and he rots away. \n"}, {"text": "How does Bentley get his legs injured?", "correct": "Clock-La's face falls on him", "options": ["Clock-La's wing knocks him down", "Clock-La's head falls on him", "Clock-La's beak punctures them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClock-La's face falls on him.\n\n\tWhen Bentley is trying to get the Hate Chip from Clock-La's mouth, Murray is no longer holding her face up.  So when Bentley finally gets the chip, Clock-La can no longer hold her face up, so it crashes down onto Bentley, crushing his legs! \n"}]}
