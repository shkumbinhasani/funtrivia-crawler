It reached a peak of number 22 on the UK Singles Chart as well.  Performed by Tikaram on vocals and guitar, the song also features drums, keyboard, bass, and the oboe.

He has since appeared on the Billboard charts (Top 200 Albums) and the soundtrack for \"Twilight\".\r\"Run to the Hills\" and \"Number of the Beast\" are both singles released by Iron Maiden while \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" is perhaps the most popular song by Iron Butterfly.\r Avrandldr is the one who added this song to the FT Setlist! \n"}, {"text": "Originally by Nina Simone, what 1972 Aretha Franklin song (and album title) has also been covered by Elton John?", "correct": "Young, Gifted, and Black", "options": ["Chain of Fools", "Respect", "I Say a Little Prayer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYoung, Gifted, and Black.\n\n\t\"Young, Gifted, and Black\" was the name of Aretha's 1972 album which contained the song of the same name.

After his passing, his studio released an album of unfinished songs entitled \"Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk\", two discs of songs which were still in the processes of studio work at the time of his death.  \"Yard of Blonde Girls\" was a cover of a song by Clark and Kramer (who were members of the lesser-known Pendulum Floors).

While they originally released \"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\" as their lead single (which never really gained its popularity until much later in the band's career), \"Light My Fire\" became the band's breakout hit.  The album, known as \"The Doors\", would reach a height of number two on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, but \"Light My Fire\" would be listed consistently amongst \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's Top Songs of All Time.\rIn 1969, musician Jos\u00e9 Feliciano won the Grammy for Male Pop Performance for his rendition of \"Light My Fire\" (during the 11th annual ceremony).  \"Light My Fire\" (and The Doors) wouldn't get Grammy recognition until being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.  They also received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy in 2007 (as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame).  Morrison passed away in 1971 at the (supposedly cursed) age of 27.\r \"Light My Fire\" was a song suggestion sparked by Dcpddc478 for our setlist. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these songs was released on an album by The White Stripes?", "correct": "I Think I Smell a Rat", "options": ["Steady as She Goes", "No Hassle Night", "The Difference Between Us"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI Think I Smell a Rat.\n\n\tWhile all of the listed songs are from Jack White-led bands, \"I Think I Smell a Rat\" is from the band's \"White Blood Cells\" album (perhaps one of their most critically acclaimed).
