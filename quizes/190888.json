{"id": "190888", "name": "What's In Your Dog's Food? Quiz | Dogs | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Dogs", "Dog Health"], "questions": [{"text": "Under United States law, all dog foods must be tested by feeding them to dogs before they go on the market.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), a non-governmental organization, maintains a list of nutrient standards for pet food. If a food is analyzed in a laboratory and found to contain the specified levels of ingredients like protein and vitamins, it may be placed on the market without ever actually having been fed to a dog! \n"}, {"text": "If a dog food is labeled \"Dog Food with Real Beef,\" under US Food and Drug Administration labeling laws, at least how much beef must it contain?", "correct": "3%", "options": ["95%", "None", "25%"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3%.\n\n\tThis rule is called \"the 3% rule.\" Under FDA guidelines, however, a food labeled \"Beef for Dogs\" must contain 95% beef. A food labeled \"Beef Dinner for Dogs\" must contain at least 25% beef. Better read those labels carefully! \n"}, {"text": "If a dog food is labeled \"Chicken Flavored Dog Food,\" under US Food and Drug Administration labeling laws, at least how much chicken must it contain?", "correct": "None", "options": ["95%", "3%", "25%"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone.\n\n\tThe flavoring may be entirely artificial. Again, better read those labels! \n"}, {"text": "Meat used in pet foods must undergo the same United States Department of Agriculture inspection process used for meat intended for human consumption.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, \"Meats and animal tissues intended for animals other than people are not subject to USDA inspection.\" Some pet food manufacturers do undergo voluntary inspections. \n"}, {"text": "By United States law, the remains of dead dogs or cats cannot be used in any product that may be used in pet foods.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlthough scientific evidence of dead pet remains in pet foods is lacking, rendering plants admit that it does occur. Rendering plants gather up a variety of dead animals and animal products from many sources, such as farms, pounds and slaughterhouses, and render the carcasses into oils and meat meals. These form the main ingredients in most pet foods. \n"}, {"text": "By United States law, pet food labels must list ingredients in the food in order by weight.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThis means that a food with the ingredients \"chicken meal, rice, liver meal\" must have more chicken meal than rice, and more rice than liver meal. \n"}, {"text": "Ingredients used in pet foods are generally of the same quality as those used in human foods.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tInstead, the leftovers of both the meat and grain industries are turned into pet foods. Rendering produces meat meals that are never used in human foods but are the main ingredients in most dog foods. Leftover grains from many processes such as milling oatmeal (the leftovers of which are feeding oatmeal) and brewing beer (the leftovers of which are brewer's rice) are also used in pet foods. \n"}, {"text": "One of the main sources for fats in pet food is rancid restaurant grease.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tRendering companies gather restaurant grease all over the United States. This, along with fats from slaughtered animals, is rendered into feeding fats that are used in animal foods. \n"}, {"text": "One of the main sources of meats used in pet food is \"4-D meats.\" What does \"4-D\" stand for?", "correct": "Meat from animals that were dead, diseased, down or dying at the slaughter plant", "options": ["Animals from  a poorly-rated (4-D) farm, as opposed to a 1- A or 2-B farm.", "Meat that is decomposing, thus labeled \"4-D\"", "Meat that is of good quality but has cosmetic imperfections such as discoloration"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeat from animals that were dead, diseased, down or dying at the slaughter plant.\n\n\t4-D animals are those that cannot be processed for human consumption because they arrived at the slaughterhouse dead or dying, were found to be diseased, or were down (unable to rise to be slaughtered.) \n"}, {"text": "Dog food samples have been found to contain drugs not allowed in the human food chain.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAs two examples, procaine, used in some antibiotics for cattle, is a common contaminant in diets fed to racing greyhounds, and the FDA found pentobarbital, used for animal euthanasia, in many brands of dry pet foods. \n"}]}
