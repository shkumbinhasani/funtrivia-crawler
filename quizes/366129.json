{"id": "366129", "name": "\"Go to Hell\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Coven"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these is not one of the Seven Wonders?", "correct": "Transfiguration", "options": ["Concilium", "Pyrokinesis", "Descensum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTransfiguration.\n\n\tAs the coven can only succeed if led under a strong, singular authority, any potential figureheads must undergo the ritual of the Seven Wonders, acts of advanced magic, to determine supremacy.  The Seven Wonders include the following:\r1. Telekinesis - Moving objects with the mind.\r2. Concilium - Controlling people with the mind.\r3. Transmutation - Teleporting oneself with magic.\r4. Divination - Using the gift psychic powers to see things normally unseen.\r5. Vitalum Vitalis - The balancing of scales between one life force and another.\r6. Descensum - A perilous descent into the nether worlds of the afterlife.\r7. Pyrokinesis - The manipulation of fire with the mind.\r Attempting the Seven Wonders can get one killed, as Fiona tells Queenie.  Fiona tells the girl of respect while the younger witch claims that Fiona just wants to know who the Supreme is to kill them and prolong her life.  Queenie, meanwhile, shows concern that Marie Laveau has gone missing, even in the face of her Seven Wonders ritual on Saturday. \n"}, {"text": "Cordelia finds that despite blinding herself again, her powers do not immediately return.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tCordelia stops in to speak with Madison who, packing her things, seems to refuse any contact, mainly because she doesn't want anyone to know where she put Misty Day.  Cordelia says that despite her blindness she doesn't have her gift back and insists that touching Madison may spark something, just like last time.  To evade this, Madison performs transmutation, teleporting herself throughout the room.  Cordelia says that it doesn't mean she's the Supreme.  When Madison finally lets Cordelia touch her, no visions are seen; Madison is off the hook. \n"}, {"text": "Who informs Queenie of Marie Laveau's whereabouts?", "correct": "Papa Legba", "options": ["Delphine LaLaurie", "Spalding", "The Axeman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPapa Legba.\n\n\tQueenie takes it upon herself to determine the whereabouts of Marie Laveau and, heading into the greenhouse, she finds a pool of blood.  Opening a book of incantations, she decides that she must summon the spirit of Papa Legba and descend into Hell to find out the truth.  She is successful, and when she arrives she finds herself in her personal vision of the underworld-- the chicken restaurant she worked at in Detroit.  Papa Legba is at the front of the line; he warns her not to take too long getting back to her material realm, because if she waits past sunrise, she'll be trapped there forever.\rWhen she wakes up, they have a chat about Marie.  It turns out that LaLaurie, after having incapacitated Marie Laveau, dismembered her and moved her body parts to prevent her from returning.  Queenie reasons that Laveau is already in breach of her contract with Legba, unable to deliver the innocent souls he requires...and that gives her an opening. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Queenie locate Delphine?", "correct": "At her old house", "options": ["At the graveyard", "In an airport", "At a restaurant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt her old house.\n\n\tQueenie finds Delphine at her old house giving, ironically, tours of the mansion in which she killed so many people.  She makes attempts to dispel the truth of her past while avoiding the attic torture chamber and, when the guests leave, Queenie emerges to talk.\rWhen Delphine took the tour earlier on, she was distraught at the treatment of her image and, to reclaim her house, she knocked out the previous guide.  She takes Queenie up to the attic where the witch offers her a second chance; if Delphine offers her services to redeem herself she can repent for her sins.  Delphine says that would never work because no one honestly does that.  What she's learned from television over the past weeks has taught her that anyone could say anything and get off scot-free.  When Queenie realizes that LaLaurie is not sorry, she stabs her in the neck with her own torture device.  Now mortal, since Marie Laveau can not fulfill her end of Papa Legba's bargain, she dies. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these triggers a vision in Cordelia?", "correct": "Her grandmother's necklace", "options": ["Her mother's portrait", "Her mother's dress", "Misty's shawl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer grandmother's necklace.\n\n\tBack at the academy, Fiona has her portrait painted by an artist Myrtle flew in from London.  During her sitting, her nose starts to run blood and she's forced to take a moment to recompose herself.  She thinks to herself that she has no more than a couple of weeks left.\rUpstairs, later, Cordelia walks in on Fiona looking through jewelery.  Fiona tries to tell her daughter that her power was inside her the whole time; she should never have mutilated herself again.  She tries to extend an olive branch to her daughter by handing off her most precious heirloom-- her own mother's necklace.  Cordelia realizes that her mother is saying goodbye and, as she places the necklace around her daughter's neck, a vision is had.  Cordelia sees the girls of the academy, scattered through its halls, each murdered by Fiona.  She says nothing of what she has seen. \n"}, {"text": "Does Cordelia determine the whereabouts of Misty Day?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tCordelia, now assured that her powers are within her, takes a trip through New Orleans to pay a visit to The Axeman in his apartment.  She warns him that loving Fiona will only hurt him in the long-run.  Cordelia says that her mother will kill all of the girls and leave him behind; whatever he believes she'll do is wrong because she's planning on hopping on a jet and flying elsewhere.  He struggles to believe that she's using him, but the evidence seems apparent.\rCordelia returns to the academy and finds a piece of clothing she can link to Misty Day.  Sure enough, her powers flourish once more and she's able to locate Misty at the cemetery. \n"}, {"text": "Who brings Misty Day back from the dead?", "correct": "Queenie", "options": ["Myrtle", "Cordelia", "Madison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueenie.\n\n\tBringing Queenie with her to the cemetery, Cordelia narrows down the location of Misty Day to the proper tomb and encourages her pupil to break in with magic.  Sure enough, she is able to break into the walled-up tomb, dragging the coffin out with telekinesis.  When the coffin is opened, it turns out that Misty isn't breathing.  Queenie, however, is able to use Vitalum Vitalis to bring the girl back to life.\rBack at the academy, Madison asks Myrtle where everyone is, and bats her eyelashes at the thought of Misty Day being unearthed.  That's when Zoe, who headed to Florida the previous week, makes her return with Kyle. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the Seven Wonders did Zoe perform, convincing her to return from Florida?", "correct": "Vitalum Vitalis", "options": ["Transmutation", "Telekinesis", "Divination"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVitalum Vitalis.\n\n\tMyrtle is shocked to see Zoe, having been the one to send her to Florida a week earlier for her own safety.  Zoe explains that when they made it to Florida, Kyle was unable to restrain his rage and he ended up killing a homeless man.  Zoe, however, came into her own by using Vitalum Vitalis to resurrect him.  She realized then that she could never escape her true self.  They came back because she believes herself to be the new Supreme.\rAt that moment, the others return from the cemetery and Misty Day decides to take out her anger by beating up Madison, bashing her through the academy. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does The Axeman find, indicating that Fiona plans to leave him?", "correct": "A plane ticket", "options": ["A phone number", "A suitcase", "A gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA plane ticket.\n\n\tMisty and Madison fight their way through to the front hallway of the academy before they're interrupted by The Axeman, covered in blood and enraged.  The coven forces him away with telekinesis, sending him sprawling across the room.  Cordelia notes that he's on the mortal coil and, when the girls notice that it isn't his blood tracking on the floor, she realizes that it's her mother's.\rCordelia sees it clearly-- her mother went to The Axeman's apartment and he ended up finding the plane tickets, breaking apart his dream of getting a farmhouse with her and going fishing.  She explains that she'd always planned on leaving him behind; with her supremacy secure she could go off with whoever she wanted.  As she started in on a story about a calico cat, he struck her in the back with his axe, murdering her once and for all. \n"}, {"text": "Who is also present in LaLaurie and Laveau's personal Hell?", "correct": "Borquita", "options": ["Queenie", "Bastien", "Fiona"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBorquita.\n\n\tAs Cordelia sees the vision, she realizes that The Axeman brought her body to the swamp and fed her to the gators.  The coven decides that they must kill him to put an end to him.  Kyle starts in on the man, saying that he's the guard dog.  When Madison steps in, she takes the first hit.  Soon after, the other girls join in, stabbing him to death in the kitchen much like the witches of the past did to seal him away.\r In her attic torture chamber, Delphine is locked away next to her daughter, Borquita, as the torturer, Marie Laveau, steps out to make the first cuts.  Marie realizes that she has no stake with Borquita but she has no real choice-- Papa Legba says that it is their souls' purpose to reenact these scenes against their will in their personal Hell...for eternity.\r The girls watch as Fiona's portrait is placed on the wall in the parlor.  Cordelia says that she was a horrible Supreme and that they must find a successor.  All of them will be tested; everyone will complete the Seven Wonders, and one will emerge as Supreme. \n"}]}
