Surprisingly, Luke claims to have received the letter from himself.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe game begins with Professor Layton and his trusty sidekick/student, Luke, heading to a clock shop in Baldwin.  The reason they've decided to do this is to follow a note supposedly written by Luke ten years in the future asking for help.  Upon arriving at this mysterious clock shop tucked away into a quiet part of the city (on Midland Road) they are asked to solve a few clock-related riddles before selecting a gear which operates the buildings gigantic clock. In a later chapter, Layton and Luke discover that it was, in fact, a futuristic version of himself who sent the letter backwards through time using a wormhole created in the clock shop. \n"}, {"text": "The second mystery of the game involves a missing leader, but who is this leader specifically?", "correct": "The Prime Minister", "options": ["The Professor", "Professor Layton's mentor", "The President"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Prime Minister.\n\n\tOne week before Professor Layton and Luke received their strange letter, they attended a scientific demonstration with Inspector Chelmey and Prime Minister Bill Hawks present.  When the mysterious scientist involved in the demonstration asks Hawks to volunteer to be a part of a test run on the machine, he accepts.  It turns out that this large device is a time machine.  When the doctor behind the controls starts up the console, the machine destroys itself and he and Hawks vanish without a trace.  Over the next week, many of London's chief scientists also start to go missing.  Rumour has it, they're all being held hostage.  A look through Scotland Yard's archives in the present time confirms (for Layton at least) that Hawks is alive.\rInevitably, Layton and Luke find Bill Hawks when they finally come face to face with the supposed future Professor Layton.  Later in the game, it is also revealed that Hawks was the man responsible for Claire's death many years ago.  In the end of the game, Hawks is found hooked up to a large detonation device in the generator of a mobile fortress.  Yikes! \n"}, {"text": "Warped London is the third mystery of the game.  Which of these does not lead Layton and Luke to believe that they have arrived in the future?", "correct": "All analog clocks have become digital", "options": ["The date on a newspaper", "A letter purported to be from the future", "The elimination of the bus system in favour of a railway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll analog clocks have become digital.\n\n\tAlthough 'Warped London' is the third mystery to be added to Professor Layton's log, it's the first mystery to be solved (quite early on in the game).  Emerging from the clock shop, Layton and Luke find themselves in a peculiar place unlike Midland Road.  Investigating further, they discover that the bus stop they arrived at has been long unused and their bus route has been defunct for several years; it's been replaced by an underground subway/rail system.  By the end of chapter one it seems that the pair actually have stumbled into a future London; a newspaper confirms the date is ten years in the future.\rLater in the game during the big reveal, Layton finally realizes that the entire town is a set designed to make them believe it's the future.  It's actually a subterranean complex.  By the time Layton unveils this groundbreaking shocker, 'Warped London' becomes one of the first elements of a mystery to receive a 'whole story' update in the log. \n"}, {"text": "One of the mysteries of the game involves a number of inexplicably scared people throughout London.

Later, in chapter two, Layton and Luke discover that there are many frauds who attempt to look like Professor Layton and the hat signifies the intrepid protagonist.  Coincidentally, the person who changed London into its present form is described as 'a devil in a top hat'. \n"}, {"text": "What is Future Luke's actual name?", "correct": "Clive", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nClive.\n\n\tLayton and Luke's journey through futuristic London involves multiple spots, almost as a proving ground for Future Luke.

When the three visit the lighthouse, Layton, Luke, and Flora find that these men know that something else is amiss.\rThe scientists were originally kidnapped to make them believe they were working in the future- this way, Dimitri could still move his time machine plans along.
