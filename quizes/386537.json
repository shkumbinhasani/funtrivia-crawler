Which of these less-than-sensible sounding days is observed annually in the U.S. on January 1?", "correct": "National Bloody Mary Day", "options": ["National Pi\u00f1a Colada Day", "National Margarita Day", "National Cr\u00e8me de Menthe Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNational Bloody Mary Day.\n\n\tBelieve it or not, there are more than 175 days during the year on which a particular food or drink is celebrated in the U.S. Most people do not even want to think about alcohol on New Year's Day, so quite why this date was designated as \"National Bloody Mary Day\" I cannot tell you. \r Not that any of the alternatives sound much more sensible, and yet all are real national days:  \"National Margarita Day\" is February 22, \"National Pi\u00f1a Colada Day\" in July 10 and \"National Cr\u00e8me de Menthe Day\" is September 15. Yes, really!\r On this same date, the US also celebrates Emancipation Day and Global Family Day. The countries of Brunei, Cameroon, Haiti and Sudan each celebrate independence. The dissolution of Czechoslovakia is celebrated in Slovakia as \"The Day of the Establishment of the Slovak Republic\" and in the Czech Republic as \"Restoration Day of the Independent Czech State\". It is also Founding Day in Taiwan, Constitution Day in Italy, Flag Day in Lithuania and Triumph of the Revolution Day in Cuba. For those of a particularly masochistic disposition, it is also \"Polar Bear Swim Day\" in Canada and the USA. Happy New Year, everyone. \n"}, {"text": "Moving on to January 4, only one country (Myanmar) celebrates its independence on this date, but it is also the first official United Nations health-related observance day of the year. Which of these days is observed on January 4?", "correct": "World Braille Day", "options": ["Rare Disease Day", "World Hepatitis Day", "World Osteoporosis Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld Braille Day.\n\n\tA tactile writing for people who are blind or visually impaired, Braille was created by Frenchman Louis Braille. The date for \"World Braille Day\" was chosen to commemorate Braille's birth, on January 4, 1809 in the northern French commune of Coupvray. Blinded by a childhood accident, Braille unveiled his creation in 1824, when he was just 15 years old. It has since been adapted for use in many of the world's languages. Braille died in 1852, just two days after his 43rd birthday.\r The alternatives are also United Nations sponsored observance days (see, you knew the UN did something useful): \"Rare Disease Day\" is observed annually on the last day of February, \"World Osteoporosis Day\" is October 20 and \"World Hepatitis Day\" is July 28.\r In addition to celebration of the 1948 independence from Britain gained by Myanmar, January 4 is also the \"Day of the Fallen against the Colonial Repression\" in Angola and \"Day of the Martyrs\" in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \n"}, {"text": "No one celebrates independence on January 15, but it is \"Armed Forces Day\" in Nigeria, \"Army Day\" in India, \"Arbor Day\" in Egypt, \"Korean Alphabet Day\" in North Korea and \"Teacher's Day\" in Venezuela. You'll have to guess where I got this information, but which special day is also observed internationally on this date?", "correct": "Wikipedia Day", "options": ["World Thinking Day", "International Day of the Nacho", "Tolkien Reading Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWikipedia Day.\n\n\tJanuary 15 marks the date that the world's largest online encyclopedia went public in 2001, and it has been celebrated as \"Wikipedia Day\" both online and offline since. A massive worldwide celebration took place to mark the 10th anniversary in 2011.\r \"World Thinking Day\" (wouldn't it be nice to believe that people did this on more than one day a year?) is celebrated annually on February 22 by Girl Guides and Girl Scouts worldwide. \"Tolkien Reading Day\" has been celebrated on March 25 (officially the date on which Sauron fell in \"The Lord of the Rings\") since 2003. Let me tell you, though, I've read Tolkien and it takes a lot longer than one day! Yes, there really is an \"International Day of the Nacho\" and it takes place annually on October 21 in honour of the creator of this popular snack, Ignacio Anaya, who died in 1975. \n"}, {"text": "January 22 is the \"Day of Unity\" in Ukraine and \"Grandfather's Day\" in Poland as well as the feast day for numerous Christian saints. Actor Thomas Roy and his wife created more than 80 'special' days that are listed in \"Chase's Calendar of Events\". Which of these events does Chase highlight for observance on January 22, particularly perhaps by single women of a certain age?", "correct": "Answer Your Cat's Question Day", "options": ["Wave All Your Fingers At Your Neighbors Day", "Hug an Australian Day", "Stay Away From Seattle Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnswer Your Cat's Question Day.\n\n\tIt is probably an urban myth that all middle-aged single women have a cat, but I'm sure all feline lovers out there will appreciate a day on which they are supposed to do something they may well think about far more often than once a year -- after all, I have earnest discussions with my dogs about all sorts of subjects :)\r The alternatives are more potty ideas from Roy: \"Wave All Your Fingers At Your Neighbors Day\" is February 7, \"Hug an Australian Day\" is April 26 (although I think I might skip that particular celebration), and \"Stay Away From Seattle Day\" (celebrated on September 16) seems like a very reasonable suggestion for any day of the year if you don't like rain. \n"}, {"text": "January 26 is \"Australia Day\" (only in Australia, obviously), \"Republic Day\" in India and \"Liberation Day\" in Uganda.

Now whether this is a celebration of the various local customs in various countries, or of those people who inspect your luggage for contraband when you cross an international border, I have no idea, although I suspect no one would really want to celebrate the latter... or would they? \r The alternatives are other examples of what are generally referred to as 'awareness days'. \"National Pig Day\" is held is the U.S. on March 1 (along with \"Share a Smile Day\" and \"Peanut Butter Lover's Day\"). \"Towel Day\", celebrated annually on May 25 since 2001, involves fans of \"The Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" carrying a towel around for the day (fans of the book will know why, apparently) in tribute to author Douglas Adams, who had died two weeks earlier. \"World Toilet Day\" was established in 2001 and has since been celebrated annually on November 19 by members of the \"World Toilet Organization\", and whoever even knew there was such a thing? It does suggest a suitable idea for a new political faction, though -- \"The World is Going Down the Toilet Party\". Sure to be a vote winner! \n"}, {"text": "You probably know that February 2 is \"Groundhog Day\" in the U.S. (but \"Marmot Day\" in Alaska).

The date was chosen to mark the adoption of the 1971 \"Convention on Wetlands\". Ironically, the document is known as the \"Ramsar Convention\", after the city in Iran where it was signed: curious really, since most of us probably think of Iran as somewhere that is quite the opposite of a 'wetland'.\r \"European Bat Night\" has been celebrated during the last weekend of August since 1997. When I first saw that there was such a thing as \"Global Wind Day\", I wondered if it was something else dreamt up by the \"World Toilet Organization\", but apparently not. Celebrated worldwide on June 15, it is designed to publicize onshore and offshore wind farms, like such blights on the landscape might go unnoticed! \"International Polar Bear Day\" is observed on February 27 and has nothing to do with those Scandinavians of questionable intelligence who go swimming in icy lakes but is, predictably, a product of the global warming fraternity. \n"}, {"text": "February 5 is \"Liberation Day\" in San Marino, \"Constitution Day\" in Mexico, \"Kashmir Solidarity Day\" in Pakistan and \"Unity Day\" in Burundi.

Fans of the 1993 Bill Murray film, \"Groundhog Day\", would probably expect this particular day to be celebrated on February 2.\r \"Teachers' Day\" is celebrated in numerous countries, but the date varies: in the UK it is October 5, whilst in the U.S. it is on a Tuesday in early May. Celebration of \"Ratcatcher's Day\" goes back to the myth of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. It is celebrated on two different dates as the Brothers Grimm cite June 26, 1284 as the date of the children's exodus, whilst the Robert Browning poem gives the date as July 22, 1376. \"Administrative Professionals' Day\" (also known as \"Secretary's Day\") is observed in the U.S. on the Wednesday in the last full week of April, but dates vary around the world -- in Australia it is the first Friday in May. \n"}, {"text": "February 12 is \"Union Day\" in Myanmar, \"Youth Day\" in Venezuela and \"Georgia Day\" in that U.S. state.
