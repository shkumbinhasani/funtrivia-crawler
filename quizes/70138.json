Brooks. This line is spoken by a rather inebriated Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks -- no relation) watching Tom Grunick (William Hurt) on the network news. Tom tends to overuse alliteration in his copy, a fact obviously not overlooked by Aaron. \n"}, {"text": "'That must be one hell of a planet you people come from!'", "correct": "Flash Gordon", "options": ["Explorers", "The Black Hole", "The Last Starfighter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlash Gordon.\n\n\tOne of my favorite bad movies of all time. Prince Vultan (Brian Blessed) says this to Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) after Flash announces that he plans to sacrifice his own life in order to save the day. Unfortunately, Flash survives, and exposes us to yet more of his horrendous atttempts at acting. \n"}, {"text": "'Grampa...I'm kinda glad I got your blood in me.'", "correct": "Vision Quest", "options": ["The Lost Boys", "Stephen King's Silver Bullet", "Raging Bull"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVision Quest.\n\n\tWhen high school wrestling prodigy Loudon Swain (Matthew Modine) tries to convince his grandfather to leave his desolate mountain cabin and move in with the family, the old man steadfastly refuses.

Since Ray is black, the man expresses some doubt as to whether he is actually named Costanzo. The above quote is Ray's response. \n"}, {"text": "'It starts in your stomach. You know, like a tickling? And then it pulls you. The tickling pulls you.'", "correct": "Poltergeist & Poltergiest", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoltergeist & Poltergiest.\n\n\tDiane Freeling (JoBeth Williams) is attempting to explain to her husband Steven (Craig T. Nelson) one of the more unusual paranormal phenomena occurring in their home. \n"}, {"text": "'The only reason you're still breathing is 'cause I never kissed you.'", "correct": "Tootsie", "options": ["Just One of the Guys", "Like Father, Like Son", "Victor, Victoria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTootsie.\n\n\tAfter the cross-dressing ruse enacted by Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) has been revealed on national television, he tracks down Les Nichols (Charles Durning), the man who actually proposed to Michael's female alias, not knowing that \"Dorothy Michaels\" was a man in disguise. Les is not initially pleased to see Michael, and delivers the above line to him. \n"}, {"text": "'I hate college. It's like high school with ashtrays.'", "correct": "She's Having a Baby", "options": ["Roxanne", "Gross Anatomy", "The Big Chill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe's Having a Baby.\n\n\tJake Briggs (Kevin Bacon) is lamenting the path he's taken by pursuing a graduate degree.

Fabulous Chicago location shooting, a brilliant score by Dave Grusin, and a perfect snapshot of what can happen when bullies step into the world of a teenager and try to ruin it. Highly recommended. \n"}, {"text": "'Your mother puts license plates in your underwear? How do you sit?'", "correct": "Real Genius", "options": ["The Wild Life", "Used Cars", "Airplane!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReal Genius.\n\n\tAs Chris Knight (Val Kilmer) and Mitch Taylor (Gabe Jarret) are about to start dismantling the car of their nemesis Kent (Robert Prescott), Chris notes that 'Kent puts his name on his license plate.' Mitch responds with, 'My mother does the same thing to my underwear.' The line above is Chris' retort. 'Real Genius' is a stupendously funny movie.  Go out and rent it. \n"}, {"text": "'Did you know your last name's an adverb?'", "correct": "Johnny Dangerously", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Dangerously.\n\n\tLil Sheridan (Marilu Henner) says this to Johnny Dangerously (Michael Keaton) after he introduces himself.

Earlier in the film, Theo (Clarence Gilyard, Jr.) had stated that it would take a miracle to disrupt the EM lock; Hans speaks the above quote to him once the power has been cut and the vault door swings open. \n"}, {"text": "'There's a sign over the urinal that says, 'Please don't eat the big white mint'!'", "correct": "Road House", "options": ["Grease 2", "St. Elmo's Fire", "Porky's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoad House.\n\n\tWade Garrett (Sam Elliott) is describing the level of 'class' present at the bar where he currently works as a bouncer.
