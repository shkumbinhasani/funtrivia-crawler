{"id": "406692", "name": "The \"Resident Evil 4\" Enemy Guide Quiz  | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Resident Evil", "Resident Evil 4"], "questions": [{"text": "Most Ganados wield pitchforks or sickles, but some can also be found wielding which of these?", "correct": "Chainsaws", "options": ["Grenades", "Swords", "Rocks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChainsaws.\n\n\tGanados are resourceful.  Basically treated as the zombies of this game, Ganados are your typical rural villagers and they are infected, by all means, but by Las Plagas and not the explicit T-Virus or G-Virus seen in earlier games.  Instead, the Ganados are mind-controlled or experience significant bouts of aggression (though sometimes they can also be sedate).  While most Ganados wield sharp objects, some also throw dynamite; some fire guns; some use chainsaws.  Sometimes, you can down a Ganados and it will continue to walk, controlled by Las Plagas nested within. \n"}, {"text": "Del Lago, based on its name, is a boss that comes from which location?", "correct": "The Lake", "options": ["The Woods", "The Dark", "The Sky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Lake.\n\n\tConsidered the first major boss of the game, Del Lago comes in at the end of Chapter 1-3, ending the first act of the game when Leon heads out into a lake in a wooden boat.  The fight against this massive Plagas-infected creature can be a short one, but only if Leon can properly aim an endless supply of harpoons and bring the fish down Ahab-style.  Killing Del Lago will help clear the path and allow Leon to continue on and find Ashley Graham, so there's no avoiding this one. \n"}, {"text": "The Plagas is found on what spot of an El Gigante?", "correct": "The spine", "options": ["The forehead", "The heart", "The foot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe spine.\n\n\tEl Gigante is, well, kind of what it seems to be on the surface-- a massive, hulking creature with immense strength, able to make broad swings to pummel Leon into a pulp if he gets too close.  The goal with these creatures is to keep a wide berth, kiting and shooting at the foe until it's weakened and drops to its knees.  At this point, the Las Plagas will emerge from its spine and that moment of exposure will be the time to fire.  This creature appears for the first time in Chapter 2-1 and reappears a few times during the course of the game. \n"}, {"text": "Colmillos are infected versions of which of these?", "correct": "Wolves", "options": ["Crows", "Spiders", "Snakes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWolves.\n\n\t'Colmillos', translating to 'Fangs', are Plaga-infested wolves who may start appearing to be rabid beasts, but which will still end up being controlled by the infection; the Plaga will emerge from their back, providing a weak point when that time comes.  These agile creatures pack a mean bite, but with a powerful shot they can be felled quickly.  They usually travel in packs, mainly appearing in Chapter 2, but they do show later as well. \n"}, {"text": "Bitores Mendez, fought in a burning barn, must be defeated so that Leon can claim which of these from him?", "correct": "An eye", "options": ["A tongue", "A hand", "An ear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn eye.\n\n\tThe village chief, Bitores Mendez appears throughout the first couple of chapters, ultimately becoming the boss at the end of Chapter 2-3, being found in a barn near Castle Salazar.  He stands between Leon and Ashley and the castle, a new landmark for the pair when their chopper extraction is brought down, and the only way through is by defeating him and claiming his false eye to use as a key. Fighting him in the flaming barn, Leon will cause the priest to split into two and with that, Mendez will be almost centipedal for the last half of the battle.  Once he burns away in the fire, though, he won't come back. \n"}, {"text": "Garradors are, notably, afflicted with which of these?", "correct": "Blindness", "options": ["Narcolepsy", "Poison", "Brittle bones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlindness.\n\n\tLeon first finds a Garrador in the prison cellar of Salazar's Castle (as early as Chapter 3-1) and this battle is a good indication of the way things need to go with these foes.  Like El Gigante, the Plaga parasite found on these enemies are on the back.  The catch is that the Garrador is smaller and more mobile, able to charge after anything that makes significant noise and slash at it with oversized blade claws.  The Garrador is blind, however; their eyes are sewn shut.  This means that Leon can utilize the environment to help distract or mislead the enemy in a pinch. \n"}, {"text": "There are two different types of Novistadores in the game.  One can fly; what can the other do?", "correct": "Go invisible", "options": ["Dig", "Move silently", "Withstand heat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGo invisible.\n\n\tFirst met in the sewers beneath Salazar's Castle, these bug foes are set loose on Leon when he starts getting deeper into the building.  The first few Leon faces will be invisible save for a small indicator seen at a distance, so taking the shot and downing them quickly (at range) is necessary to avoid a frantic close-quarters fight.  Later versions of the enemy, seen closer to the throne room, can fly instead of go invisible (creating a new problem entirely). \n"}, {"text": "The Plagas known as Armadura reside in which of these?", "correct": "Suits of armor", "options": ["Cupboards", "Paintings", "Clothes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuits of armor.\n\n\tArmadura come in a couple of different forms.  Ashley will encounter the first of these types when she tries to reunite with Leon in Chapter 3-4.  Occupying suits of armor, they'll make moves to attack with their weapons or, weakly, die trying.  Leon faces the heartier of the types-- Plagas formed to the armor who will emerge from their shells to protect their spaces.  Their armor is, obviously, strong against most weapons; Leon will need to shoot the parasite to put an end to them. \n"}, {"text": "Salazar's right hand aide, Verdugo, can be subdued with which of these?", "correct": "Liquid nitrogen", "options": ["Jewelery", "Blinding light", "Food"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiquid nitrogen.\n\n\tEncountered at the end of Chapter 4-1, Verdugo is met when Leon falls into the pit beneath the throne room, and under most circumstances, this foe would not be beaten without a bit of extra help.  To reduce Verdugo's surprising agility, Leon can drop canisters of liquid nitrogen on the ground, temporarily freezing the otherwise speedy boss.  In that state, Leon can shoot at will and bring down the hearty foe.  The stronger the weapon, the better (a Rocket Launcher will kill him in one hit!), otherwise, if you run out of canisters, it's a matter of running out the clock to escape. \n"}, {"text": "Theoretically, you could defeat Salazar in how many shots?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "None", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tAlthough Ramon Salazar, when he transforms at the top of his tower, seems to be a fearsome foe with massive tentacles and a hard exterior, you can be tactical with this fight (provided you're wily enough to dodge his hits and avoid the lower level of the battle area).  All you need to do is fire a high-powered round (from a magnum, for instance) at his weak point-- his eye.  When this is done (potentially in one shot) you can use a single rocket from the launcher you can buy at the Merchant outside, fire it on Salazar's body within the beast, and end the fight as quickly as that. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is necessary to locate the Plagas on a Regenerator?", "correct": "Infrared Scope", "options": ["X-Ray Glasses", "SONAR", "Lenticular Lenses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInfrared Scope.\n\n\tThe labs of the island in Chapter 5 are fraught with perhaps the worst dangers yet.  As Leon wanders through the operating rooms there, he'll come across the first Regenerators of the game.  These enemies are amongst the most fearsome in the game since, as their name implies, they can bring themselves back to full form if Leon doesn't manage to defeat them correctly.  These beings have several parasites on their bodies, and Leon will need to snipe them using the rifle and an Infrared Scope to wipe them out. \n"}, {"text": "Similar to the Regenerator, the Iron Maiden is more dangerous, attacking with which of these?", "correct": "Spikes", "options": ["Its scream", "Tentacles", "Human weapons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpikes.\n\n\tFound deeper in the labs in Chapter 5-1, Leon will find the Iron Maiden not too long after meeting the first wave of Regenerators, and just like with those enemies, his aim should be to equip the Infrared Scope, shoot out the Plagas on the creature's body, and let it disintegrate.  The catch is that the Iron Maiden is heartier and more dangerous due to the immense spikes all over its body and the hidden Plaga on its back.  Shoot for the legs to bring it down, and you'll get the opportunity to shoot for the hiding parasite. \n"}, {"text": "Saddler refers to which of these foes as 'It'?", "correct": "U-3", "options": ["The Bella Sisters", "J. J.", "Dr. Salvador"], "explanation": "\n\n\nU-3.\n\n\tReferred to by Saddler as 'It', this amalgamation of several types of creature seems to take on new forms the more you fight it.  Encountered in Chapter 5-3, Leon must battle against this creature first in a series of container units and then along a series of cliffside caves.  In the first half of this fight he'll need to dodge and destroy to make his way to the other side but in the second he'll just need to power through, fighting the monster with as much firepower as possible (and dodging some underground attacks) to survive. \n"}, {"text": "Towards the end of your battle against Jack Krauser, you'll face a time limit of how long?", "correct": "Three minutes", "options": ["Six minutes", "Five minutes", "Four minutes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree minutes.\n\n\tAt the end of Chapter 5-3 you'll finally get the chance to face off against Leon's old comrade, Jack Krauser, as he acts as one of the last lines of defence for Lord Saddler.  Running around some sandy ruins on the island, Leon will need to collect three Pieces of the Holy Beast to advance past this area, but naturally one of those is on Saddler himself. At the end of a long battle around the map, Leon will face off against his Plaga-infested former-buddy and, ideally with a knife, bring him down.  The last component of this battle, held on a rooftop, is held to a three minute timer (before the place explodes). \n"}, {"text": "Ada will provide you with what final weapon in the boss battle against Lord Saddler?", "correct": "Rocket Launcher", "options": ["Grenade Launcher", "EMP", "Detonator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRocket Launcher.\n\n\tWhen you reach the end of the game you'll finally need to take down Lord Saddler, and as it turns out, he's not all too fond of explosions.  While it's best to bring out the big guns to take potshots at his body while the massive Plagas creature that emerges from him takes control, the best strategy is actually to utilize the explosive barrels on the map and any Hand Grenades you may still be carrying around, then using the time he's incapacitated to jump in and hack away at his weak spots. When it gets to a certain point, Ada will toss down a Rocket Launcher and, provided it connects, the rest'll be history. \n"}]}
