{"id": "407651", "name": "Detours of \"The Amazing Race 30\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 30"], "questions": [{"text": "The first Detour of the race, completed in Antwerp, Belgium, involved either printing presses or which of these?", "correct": "Diamonds", "options": ["French fries", "Coffee", "Waffles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiamonds.\n\n\tIn Leg 2, teams had their first Detour, a choice between 'Old Print' and 'Diamond Glint'.  The former task allowed teams to use an old printing press, properly aligning and mirroring text to be stamped and printed on a sheet of paper.  If their work matched a provided clue, they could use it to continue racing. Cedric and Shawn, Cody and Jessica, Henry and Evan, Kristi and Jen, and Lucas and Brittany completed this task.  In the diamond task, teams instead had to learn how to properly value precious stones based on different criteria, then determine the worth of three diamonds and a necklace to get their next clue. Trevor and Chris, Joey and Tim, April and Sarah, Eric and Daniel, and Alex and Conor completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 3, teams visited Tangier, Morocco.  Regardless of the Detour option chosen, teams received three key words directing them to the Pit Stop.  Which was not one of those words?", "correct": "Morocco", "options": ["Palace", "Moulay", "Hafid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorocco.\n\n\tBoth the 'Drop It Off' and 'Shake It Off' Detour options sent teams searching for their final destination of the leg, and in both instances, their clues would spell out the Moulay Hafid Palace.  'Drop It Off' was more of a physical challenge as teams had to drag foods through the city streets, delivering them to three destinations to get stamps that would spell out the answers. 'Shake It Off', however, was more conducive to a detail-oriented team's victory since they needed to go belly dancing and search a local restaurant for the same key words, one on a dancer's belly, one on a waiter's jacket, and one on the cover of a tambourine. \n"}, {"text": "Teams who elected to make baguettes for their Detour in Leg 4 had to make how many loaves?", "correct": "Fifty & 50", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFifty & 50.\n\n\tOnly Alex and Conor and Cody and Jessica elected to bake bread on the French Riviera, arriving in Saint-Tropez and tackling the 'Bread' option provided, which entailed that they make thirty pounds of baguettes into fifty loaves for a baker to approve.  All the other teams went with 'Tread', a task that sent them to a sandalmaker to make two traditional Tropezienne sandals.  If they could pay attention to detail and construct the footwear properly, they could deliver them to get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was the only one to finish the 'Colorful' Road Block task in Southern France (in Leg 5)?", "correct": "Joey and Tim", "options": ["Lucas and Brittany", "Alex and Conor", "Henry and Evan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoey and Tim.\n\n\tTeams, as always, had two quite different options when they visited the city of Arles, France.  In 'Full of Bull', teams had to visit the local amphitheatre and search through more than a hundred differently-sized bull replicas to find three with different coloured ribbons (each a colour of the national flag).  If they found the correct three they could keep racing.  In 'Colorful', teams needed to complete a tricky slide puzzle based on a Van Gogh painting in front of Pont Van Gogh.  Only Joey and Tim completed the latter task and, already at the back of the pack, they were eliminated. \n"}, {"text": "Which team fell victim to the U-Turn in Prague in Leg 6, resulting in their elimination?", "correct": "Trevor and Chris", "options": ["Eric and Daniel", "Alex and Conor", "Joey and Tim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrevor and Chris.\n\n\tWhile the Detour found in Prague in Leg 6 was considered 'Blind', teams also faced a Double U-Turn that wasn't.  Cody and Jessica forced Trevor and Chris to complete both sides of the Detour to keep themselves in the race and it resulted in the latter's elimination.  In this leg, teams didn't know what they would be doing until they arrived at their tasks. 'This' allowed them to work in the local beer industry, stacking empty kegs, pouring mugs of beer, and delivering stock to a boat on the river.  'That' instead sent teals to Charles University to attend lectures on astronomy in preparation for an eight-question oral exam. \n"}, {"text": "Though teams were already hampered by the Partner Swap twist in Leg 7, they were also marred by two limited-space Detour options.  How many teams could complete each task?", "correct": "Three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree & 3.\n\n\tWith teams swapped at the start of a series of tasks in the Imire Rhino & Wildlife Conservancy, their quick ability to work with new people on the fly was put to the test.  Reaching the lookout tower on the conservation grounds, teams could choose either 'Rhino Track', which involved traveling on horseback to find signs of poachers, or 'Bush Whack', which involved driving through the bog to replenish ranger stations. Regardless of the task chosen, only three teams could complete it due to limited space.  Brittany and Alex, Daniel and Evan, and Jessica and Kristi completed 'Rhino Track' while Cody and Jen, Henry and Eric, and Lucas and Conor completed 'Bush Whack'. \n"}, {"text": "Teams encountered a Double U-Turn, their second of the race, before the Detour in Leg 8.  Both tasks took place in what Zimbabwean city?", "correct": "Harare", "options": ["Chitungwiza", "Victoria Falls", "Bulaweyo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarare.\n\n\tMoving directly out of Leg 7 and into Leg 8, teams were surprised by an impromptu Double U-Turn waiting in a Harare shop.  Lucas and Brittany U-Turned Cody and Jessica while Alex and Conor U-Turned Henry and Evan forcing both teams to complete both sides of the upcoming Detour.  This meant that they had to both deliver mail in Eastgate Mall for 'Handle With Care' and deliver tires in Magaba Market for 'Just Get It There'.  This was the final Double U-Turn of the race. \n"}, {"text": "Both the 'Size It' and 'Seize It' Detour options encountered in Thailand in Leg 10 involved which of the following?", "correct": "Animals", "options": ["Food", "Sports", "Dancing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnimals.\n\n\tVisiting the city of Chiang Mai, Thailand in Leg 10, teams headed out into the rural fields and forests around Thailand's northern hub to either measure elephants in 'Size It' or catch bullfrogs in 'Seize It'.  Both tasks were completed evenly; Henry and Evan and Kristi and Jen went for 'Size It', doing the math to help the animal sanctuary, while Cody and Jessica and Alex and Conor headed to the rice paddies to join in the childhood games. \n"}, {"text": "In the final Detour of this race, teams either spoke Cantonese or worked with which local food?", "correct": "Crab", "options": ["Dim sum", "Noodles", "Chicken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrab.\n\n\tThe last Detour of the race was held for teams as they travelled to Hong Kong in Leg 11, and both forced teams to handle local foods.  In 'Hairy Crab', Kristi and Jen and Cody and Jessica hopped into a Hong Kong fishing boat to tie fifty hairy crabs, preparing them for delivery to the market while in 'Grub Grab', Henry and Evan and Alex and Conor served a table of eight in a Hong Kong restaurant, relaying and accumulating orders in Cantonese to complete the service. \n"}, {"text": "How many Detours were featured in \"The Amazing Race 30\"?", "correct": "Nine & 9", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine & 9.\n\n\tThis season of the race saw nine different Detour challenges over the course of the race with teams not needing to make those hard choices in Leg 1 (in Iceland) or in Leg 12 (in San Francisco).  Additionally, Leg 9 (held in Bahrain) didn't feature a Detour or a Road Block, forcing teams to take a sprint around the island nation following Route Info tasks, a first for a non-finale episode of the show.  This season also featured two Double U-Turns, one in Leg 6 and one in Leg 8.  Only the first one forced a team to be eliminated. \n"}]}
