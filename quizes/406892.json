Kennedy of the alien treaty?", "correct": "Richard Nixon", "options": ["Herbert Hoover", "Lyndon B. Johnson", "Harry Truman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Nixon.\n\n\tIn Palm Springs, California in 1963, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower attempts to play golf, coincidentally at the same course where he received the fateful news of a crash landing in the desert during his presidency.  This time, he's spoken to by Richard Nixon, his former Vice President, who claims that John F. Kennedy should not be trusted with information about the alien treaty.  Eisenhower claims he's just angry because JFK beat him in the election.  No matter what, Kennedy will find out the truth, they just need to get ahead of it.\r It's because of this that they head to the White House, and in the Oval Office Dwight hands over the files. \n"}, {"text": "Who convinces JFK to tell the American people about the alien threat?", "correct": "Marilyn Monroe", "options": ["Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis", "Robert McNamara", "Neil Armstrong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarilyn Monroe.\n\n\tKennedy is shocked and dismayed by the truth.  Eisenhower allowed the alien treaty to occur, and this meant that he allowed the aliens to abduct and experiment on humans-- five thousand people per year-- in exchange for the safety of all others and increasingly advanced technology.  Nixon suggests there's nothing much more to it besides continuing to assert dominance in the world. It doesn't sit right with Kennedy, however, who spends a night with Marilyn Monroe and tells her the awful truth.  She isn't bothered by it though.  She explains that one night she woke up in bed to hear weird noises and find a frightening teddy bear sitting by her bed. She'd never been so scared in her life.  She suggests that the American people expect no less than the truth, and that's what he needs to think about. \n"}, {"text": "Before JFK can announce the existence of aliens, he's killed in what U.S. city?", "correct": "Dallas", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDallas.\n\n\tThe Eisenhowers are awakened by a phone call in the middle of the night and Dwight picks up the phone to find Nixon on the other end of the line.  It turns out that JFK is creating a bit of a group to study the alien threat.  They're expected to go to the media with the truth.  They need to start thinking of containment.\r The next day, the Eisenhowers enjoy a meal cooked in their microwave oven-- one of the many technologies bestowed upon the people of Earth-- only to discover via a breaking news bulletin that JFK has been assassinated in Dallas. \n"}, {"text": "Subject 1 claimed to be on Earth for what reason?", "correct": "To survive", "options": ["To invade", "To enslave", "To kill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo survive.\n\n\tNine years before the JFK assassination, Eisenhower returned to the Air Force Base to speak to the top men in his military.  Many of them opposed the treaty, believing it to be a surrendering of sovereignty, but their hesitation is exactly what led Subject 1 to leave her containment unit in the base and attend the meeting.  She brought with her two new technologies-- a metal indetectable on radar and fibre-optic cabling-- and killed one of Eisenhower's men as a testament to her strength.\r Subject 1 reiterated that her world was going to go extinct, and without the work her kind were doing on Earth, they would have no other chance.  Her people could not stay on Earth because of contaminants and viruses, but if she combined her people with the people of Earth, they could go on.  Subject 1 announced that their first test subject had failed and that they would need more test subjects if they wished to succeed.  The presence left Maria's body after this, destroying her as it departed. \n"}, {"text": "Did Amelia Earhart survive her pregnancy?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhen Subject 1 informed Eisenhower that the first test subject has failed, it could only mean one thing.  He visited the room containing Amelia Earhart to find that the baby she'd been carrying had come to term, killing Earhart and her doctors upon birth.  Eisenhower, handed a gun, entered the room himself to find a bloodbath waiting for him and no survivors...save for the newborn.  As his security entered the room, the alien hybrid leapt at him and he fired on it, killing it before it could get at him.\r When he spoke to his wife at home, Dwight suggested that he couldn't possibly go ahead with the treaty, but Mamie disagreed.  There was too much to lose, especially with the Russians outpacing them. \n"}, {"text": "Nixon revealed who gave him the alien autopsy information when he accidentally showed which of these?", "correct": "Handkerchief", "options": ["Underwear", "Watch", "Photograph"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHandkerchief.\n\n\tMamie tried to convince her husband that he needed to keep up appearances for the good of the American people, but it didn't seem to work too well.  In an attempt to force Dwight to see the error of his ways, she invited Nixon over for a chat, for the first time revealing to him the files containing the alien autopsy photos.  To him, she suggested that Nixon would never have a chance at the presidency-- not if he didn't convince her husband to do the right thing.\r Nixon confronted Eisenhower at the base shortly after, urging him to use the alien technology against them, taking advantage of their gifts up until the right moment.  Eisenhower, discovering his wife was the source of the information, went home to confront her only to find that she was the next body to become occupied by Subject 1.  For the good of his country, the alien's voice said, he would help them. \n"}, {"text": "Jamie's OB-GYN detects how many heartbeats when she uses the ultrasound?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "None", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tIn the present day, Kendall drives Jamie, Troy, and Cal through Los Angeles on the way to Jamie's discrete OB-GYN, attempting to rationalize the unexplainable phenomena that's befallen them all.  Someone always blames aliens to ghosts or something insane, but there must be a logical reason why they're all experiencing such a weird problem. It gets weirder when they arrive at the office, all well along in their pregnancy, to receive ultrasounds.  As the doctor brings Jamie's baby up on the screen, she finds that there's two heartbeats...and something wrong.  She leaves the room, and that's when Kendall uses the ultrasound on Troy. \n"}, {"text": "Who removes Kendall, Jamie, Troy, and Cal from the OB-GYN's office?", "correct": "Men in black suits", "options": ["A film crew", "Aliens", "Paranormal researchers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMen in black suits.\n\n\tAs Kendall uses the ultrasound on Troy, she stares at the screen to find an awful image depicted there.  Sure enough, there's an alien baby forming inside his belly, just as there is likely one in each of theirs.  As they ponder how they'll be able to remove it, a van pulls up outside the office.  The OB-GYN, calling for an emergency consult in her office, is met by men in black suits and glasses and is shot and killed to avoid spreading the news.  The men burst into the other room to sedate the four friends, bringing them under to transport them somewhere else.\r When Kendall awakens, she's levitating off the ground in a white room. \n"}, {"text": "When Calico is first met, Kendall finds her speaking to what famous figure?", "correct": "Steve Jobs", "options": ["Leonardo Da Vinci", "Freddy Mercury", "Marilyn Monroe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve Jobs.\n\n\tWhen Kendall awakens, floating above the ground between Troy and Cal, she and the others appear to be further along in their pregnancy.  She panics when she opens her eyes but is soothed by a figure in a white mask who claims to be unlike the aliens that did this to her, but who insists that the creatures inside her and her friends are a hope for the future.  She should embrace the gift that has been given to her, the figure says; it's her chance to save an entire planet.  Kendall is put back to sleep to reduce her whining.\r Eventually Kendall and her friends are reunited in what appears to be a cafeteria room.  While they hazily awaken from their haze, Kendall watches Steve Jobs speak to a woman with a Southern accent nearby.  They're served gelatin and micronutrients before the woman, Calico, takes a seat at their table. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first of these to give birth?", "correct": "Troy", "options": ["Kendall", "Cal", "Jamie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTroy.\n\n\tKendall tries her best to remember what happened when she woke up, and while she strains herself, Calico implies that it's not worth getting worked up.  Nonetheless, Kendall catches snippets from her conscious moments, particularly that there was someone who was with her and that the babies are hope for the future.  Jamie theorizes that they might be let go once they give birth, but Calico seems to be on the annual plan; she's been with the aliens since the 1970s and hasn't aged a day.  She can't confirm that they'll go back to Earth.\r Troy, in particular, takes this the worse, lashing out at the attendants in the room and having security called on him.  He's tased and taken away while Calico calms the others down.  If they trust her and her notion that ignorance is bliss, they'll be fine.\r Troy, however, is brought to the operating room.  It's almost time though, and his questions will be answered.  As the creature inside him moves to find its way out, his attendant removes its mask to reveal that she's a human-alien hybrid...and he'll bring their species one step closer to being evolutionarily correct. \n"}]}
