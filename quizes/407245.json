It involved which of these?", "correct": "Bungee jumping", "options": ["Hanggliding", "Skydiving", "Face-first rappelling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBungee jumping.\n\n\tBeginning the ninth leg of the race at Volterou Street in Athens, Greece, teams were instructed to head by taxi to the city of Corinth to find a clue box waiting for them on the Old Bridge of the famous Corinth Canal.  It was here that teams found a Switchback based on a task first seen in \"The Amazing Race 9\" where in one member of each team had to perform a 240-foot bungee jump into the canal.  This adrenaline-pumping jump was completed by Joey, Matt, Scott, Logan, and Becca. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 9, teams flew from Greece to what Vietnamese city?", "correct": "Hanoi", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHanoi.\n\n\tAfter the big jump, teams took a long flight, travelling thousands of miles to the Vietnamese capital city, Vietnam.  All five teams boarded the same overnight flight, landing the next morning on a hot day in Southeast Asia and taking a taxi to T\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u0110\u00e0i L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5.  When they arrived, they had to find a group of more than one hundred fan dancers.  One of the dancers would have a red fan with a yellow stick, and from them, they could receive their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which team did not complete the 'Bamboo Climb' Detour task in Leg 9?", "correct": "Brooke and Scott", "options": ["London and Logan", "Becca and Floyd", "Matt and Redmond"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrooke and Scott.\n\n\tGetting their clue from the fan dancers, teams would be directed to the Qu\u00e1n S\u1ee9 Buddhist Temple to join receive their Detour envelope.  In 'Bamboo Climb', teams had to pick up one of three marked ladders from a street in Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District then, transporting the 15-foot of bamboo, navigate to a specific apartment, maneuver the device up to the roof, and use it to retrieve a birdcage. They then had to return the ladder and drop off the birdcage.  Becca and Floyd, Brooke and Scott, Matt and Redmond, London and Logan, Tara and Joey all went to this task, but due to the limited ladders, Brooke and Scott and Tara and Joey switched tasks. \n"}, {"text": "Teams completing the 'Window Design' Detour option in Leg 9 navigated city streets carrying which of these?", "correct": "Mannequins", "options": ["Benches", "Suitcases", "Glass panes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMannequins.\n\n\t'Window Design' sent teams into the city to pick up three different mannequins from a shop, transport them by hand to Ch\u00e2n C\u1ea7m Street, and then dress and arrange them in a window display to the exacting specifications of a provided photo.  If teams could handle the task, they would be given their next clue by the store owner.  Because of the popularity of the other Detour, Brooke and Scott and Tara and Joey completed this one instead, much to the frustration of both. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was last to arrive at the Pit Stop at the end of Leg 9, finding themselves saved by the last non-elimination point?", "correct": "Tara and Joey", "options": ["Brooke and Scott", "Becca and Floyd", "London and Logan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTara and Joey.\n\n\tFinishing their Detour tasks, teams were instructed to make their way by taxi to the inner-city greenspace known as Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t Park where, on the waterfront, teams would be able to check into the ninth Pit Stop of the race.  Becca and Floyd kept their lead through Hanoi and found themselves able to check in for their second first place win of the race. Because of this, Team Fun won themselves a trip for two to the Galapagos Islands courtesy of Travelocity.  The end of the leg involved a footrace during which Tara and Joey faced severe heat exhaustion.  Though they placed last, they discovered that they arrived at the race's last non-elimination mat and would face a Speed Bump in Leg 10. \n"}, {"text": "During Leg 10, teams travelled to Ninh B\u00ecnh, Vietnam.  Most of the day was spent travelling with which of these?", "correct": "Bicycles", "options": ["Tuk-Tuks", "Scooters", "Horses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBicycles.\n\n\tLeg 10 began early in the morning with teams leaving Hanoi by bus; all five took taxis to the bus station and then travelled southward to the karst landscapes of Ninh B\u00ecnh.  Upon arriving in this rural stretch of the country, teams had to make their way to the Tam C\u1ed1c Wharf in Hoa L\u01b0 where they would get their main mode of transportation for this leg of the race, a pair of bicycles.  Once they rode off, they could travel to B\u00edch \u0110\u1ed9ng Temple to find their travel companion for this leg of the race, the Travelocity Roaming Gnome. \n"}, {"text": "The Speed Bump found in Leg 10 forced one team to collect eggs laid by which creatures?", "correct": "Ducks", "options": ["Frogs", "Snakes", "Lizards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDucks.\n\n\tArriving at B\u00edch \u0110\u1ed9ng Temple, Tara and Joey located their Speed Bump for this leg of the race, the extra task put upon them since they placed last in the previous non-elimination leg.  For this, in addition to picking up their Travelocity Roaming Gnome, the pair needed to make their way into a shallow pond nearby and collect a total of six dozen duck eggs commonly harvested in the region.  Once they traded off the eggs, they could continue racing with the other teams. \n"}, {"text": "For their Road Block in Ninh B\u00ecnh, teams had to deliver which of these?", "correct": "Shrimp traps", "options": ["Bamboo", "Animals", "Spring rolls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShrimp traps.\n\n\tOnce teams nabbed their Travelocity Roaming Gnomes, they could bike onward to Th\u00f4n H\u1ea3i Nham to find the Road Block for this leg of the race.  What they found there was a difficult Switchback.  Based on a task first seen in \"The Amazing Race 3\", teams needed to grab a bike and attach 32 shrimp traps to it in the proper fashion. Once they loaded up the proper numbers of traps, they had to transport them one mile away to trade for their next clue.  Matt, Floyd, London, Scott, and Joey completed this task before hopping on their bikes again and riding to \u0110\u1ec1n Th\u00e1i Vi - B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh for their next task. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 10, teams needed to row a boat in the Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u1ed3ng River in Vietnam using which of these?", "correct": "Their feet", "options": ["Swords", "Fans", "A remote control"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir feet.\n\n\tArriving at B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh, teams had to deliver a handful of items to a dragon boat sitting in the Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u1ed3ng River, but to do that, they had to paddle their own boat the same way as the locals-- with their feet.  Once racers dropped off napkins, candles, flowers, and fake money, they could hand them off to the dragon boat in the water and bring both boats back to the starting point where they would be given their next clue.  Only one team member needed to row the boat to complete the task. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated from the race in Ninh B\u00ecnh at the end of Leg 10?", "correct": "Becca and Floyd", "options": ["London and Logan", "Brooke and Scott", "Tara and Joey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecca and Floyd.\n\n\tWhen teams finished the paddling task they could return their bikes to Tam C\u1ed1c Wharf and then proceed to Hang M\u00faa Peak, also known as Flying Dragon Peak.  There, they could ascend the five hundred steps to the top of the mountain to find Phil and the tenth Pit Stop.  Here, Matt and Redmond, with a significant lead over the other teams, won their second leg of the race, bagging a trip for two to Costa Rica courtesy of Travelocity. Becca and Floyd were, unfortunately, eliminated shortly after the Road Block when Floyd was, physically, no longer able to continue.  Team Fun was sent home in fifth place. \n"}]}
