He won two Olympic gold medals, as well as numerous World and US championships. Canadian Elvis Stojko was an Olympic silver medalist who wowed crowds with his flamboyant and very difficult style of skating.

Sadly the last native speakers of this unusual language died in the early part of the 20th century and, as only about 50 words of the language are known, it is doubtful that this language will ever be spoken on the planet again. It disappeared along with its people, as so many North and South American cultures and languages have done. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following statements about the coffins used in Orthodox Judaism is true?", "correct": "They use no metal", "options": ["They must be made of plaster", "They use only gopher wood", "They use no lid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey use no metal.\n\n\tThe coffins used in Orthodox Judaism are simple affairs made of plain wood with a lid.

As with most things, there are variations, but simplicity is of the utmost importance and is a sign of humbleness. \n"}, {"text": "In 1968, actress Elizabeth Taylor was given what gift from her then husband Richard Burton?", "correct": "The Krupp Diamond", "options": ["The Sahara Casino in Las Vegas", "One dozen red roses", "A silver plated Rolls Royce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Krupp Diamond.\n\n\tElizabeth Taylor was the recipient of the 33.19 carat Krupp Diamond from her husband.

He did not last really long when it became apparent that his skill was not of much use and his fighting skills were limited. I am sure he would have loved FunTrivia. \n"}, {"text": "In 2005, a South Korean man died after playing the video game \"Star Craft\" for 50 hours straight.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tA Korean man named Lee Seung Seop was addicted to the video game \"Star Craft\".
