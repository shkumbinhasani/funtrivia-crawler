{"id": "406894", "name": "\"Blue Moon\" Online Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Double Feature"], "questions": [{"text": "President Eisenhower only signs the alien treaty when threatened with which of these?", "correct": "His wife's life", "options": ["Exposure of his infidelities", "The extermination of the human race", "His own abduction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis wife's life.\n\n\tIn 1954, Eisenhower reviews the text of the alien treaty while his men await his signature.  Subject One, now in the body of Mamie Eisenhower, urges him to press the pen to paper and commit to the treaty if only to take advantage of the deal they seek, but the American President worries about the condemnation of thousands of innocent American lives.  It's treasonous, he says.  It takes only a small amount of pressure-- the threat of his wife's imminent death-- for him to relinquish his name and free her from alien control. \n"}, {"text": "After the signing of the alien treaty, hundreds of people are abducted from their homes.  Does there appear to be an age limit on these abductions?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAfter Eisenhower signs off on the alien treaty, it's only a few years before he receives footage brought in from Topeka, Kansas-- three beams of light from the sky, all shining into suburban houses.  He's informed that all people residing in those homes have been declared missing persons, one of whom was a nine year-old girl. There have, to this point, been 298 incursions.  They have, thus far, received no new technologies from the aliens.  As Eisenhower and his men discuss the likely colossal mistake they've made, they're met by a suited man who beams down from the sky, appearing on the White House lawn. \n"}, {"text": "Valiant Thor's first gift to the American government is which of these?", "correct": "A personal computing device", "options": ["A wireless communication system", "Nuclear fission", "Polio vaccine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA personal computing device.\n\n\tThe alien intruder lets himself into the White House and advances through the building to the Oval Office to speak to Eisenhower.  There, he introduces himself as Valiant Thor, claiming to be there to facilitate the business at hand and acting as a liaison for the processing of humans.  He proves his unique makings, pulling back a flap of skin on his scalp to show the advanced machinery inside. In light of the advancements the aliens have made, he has arrived to show off a personal computing device capable of fitting in the palm of one's hand with the power of the IBM computers housed in the Pentagon. It is the future, he claims, and it will usher in an era of peace. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does President Eisenhower discover under the basement level of the White House?", "correct": "Tunnels", "options": ["A garage", "A secret society", "His morgue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTunnels.\n\n\tReading the paper one night, Eisenhower hears screaming in the vents in the White House bedrooms.  He follows the screams down the elevator and into the basement of the building, coming across crates blocking otherwise hidden doorways in his very own home.  On the door he finds is a futuristic control panel, and with his handprint he's able to enter the passage and advance into a deeper elevator car. What he finds at the bottom, deep beneath the White House, is a massive facility containing experiments.  Valiant Thor, emerging from the shadows, says that he wasn't supposed to make his visit to the nuclear fallout tunnels for another few weeks; they weren't prepared for him. The aliens believed it was the perfect place to begin their experiments.  In their aim to create the perfect hybrids, however, they seem to be outgrowing their lab space, and with the perfect hybrid still decades out, they need to consider what to do next. \n"}, {"text": "President Eisenhower's executive order allows the aliens' use of land in which state?", "correct": "Nevada", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNevada.\n\n\tDwight speaks to Mamie over breakfast, asking for her opinion on the experimentation being done under their own home and she flippantly brushes him off, suggesting that he simply give them a new space.  She recommends a site in Nevada-- one he brought up during bridge a month earlier-- since the whole state is pretty well godforsaken.  With that idea he drafts an executive order, passing it in front of Valiant Thor to sign and confirming the aliens' use of a massive plot of land north of Las Vegas for their use (on the condition that they remove the experiments from the White House bunker). \n"}, {"text": "Whose idea is it to silence Marilyn Monroe?", "correct": "Richard Nixon", "options": ["Lyndon B. Johnson", "Mamie Eisenhower", "Dwight Eisenhower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Nixon.\n\n\tPouring himself a drink on the night of his executive order signing, Dwight believes he hears something in an adjacent room and investigates to find Mamie in bed with Valiant Thor.  The discovery causes him to collapse in dismay and, when he awakens in bed, Mamie tells him it wasn't a nightmare.  Ultimately, she says, it's fine-- he's a foreign dignitary and she is, thus, giving her body for her country.  On top of this, he's not flesh and blood, so it's not an act of infidelity.\r Five years later at FBI Headquarters, Eisenhower and Nixon watch videos of Marilyn Monroe spilling the alleged truth about aliens.  Both realize that they'll need to plug the leaks though Nixon takes it a step further, sending assassins to kill her in her home and blame it on her addiction. \n"}, {"text": "During the first visit to see the hybrid test subjects, who is not present?", "correct": "John F. Kennedy", "options": ["Richard Nixon", "Lyndon B. Johnson", "Dwight Eisenhower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn F. Kennedy\n\n\tNixon sends his condolences to John F. Kennedy, apologizing for Marilyn's death but not admitting to the events.  He attempts to set the current President's mind at ease about the film-- she knew about a lot of stuff, and whoever told her should watch their back.\r One year later, Eisenhower and Nixon join Lyndon B. Johnson in Nevada and are met once again by Valiant Thor who, leading the trio of Presidents into Area 51, gaze into the expansive warehouses, staring into the containment units of potential hybrid candidates.  Eisenhower wonders out loud: \"what have I done?\" \n"}, {"text": "Troy's baby, according to Theta, is the most successful hybrid to date.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tTroy, seated in the operating room, is told that he will not scream, beg, or die.  Theta speaks to him via telepathy while she slices into his stomach, removing the hybrid from him and cutting into its amniotic sac.  It appears to be the closest hybrid yet though its physical abnormalities are cause for concern.  As the nurses slice the baby's neck and place it into a tank, Theta has to subdue Troy to keep him from lashing out.\r One week later, Troy rejoins the others in the cafeteria.  No longer pregnant, he expresses that he felt a connection to the child before they murdered it.  He explains the process as it was and the lack of physical pain, but he knows it was a beautiful moment. \n"}, {"text": "Calico was working at a bar when she met who of these?", "correct": "Neil Armstrong", "options": ["Steve Jobs", "John F. Kennedy", "Al Gore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeil Armstrong.\n\n\tWhile the group considers escaping the alien compound, Calico joins the foursome to encourage them to be rational.  She suggests the idea is delusional because there, at Area 51, no one has ever escaped; the military-industrial complex will see to it that they can't.  Calico admits that she's had two or three babies per year since 1969.  Progress, she says, means disassociating with the system.  She's a link in the chain of celestial evolution.\r She takes the group to her favourite place-- the set where the government staged the moon landing fifty years earlier.  In 1969 she worked as a prostitute and a waitress when she came across Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in her restaurant when they should have been in space.  She got the entire truth out of them and then the government came for her. \n"}, {"text": "Who gives birth without Theta being present?", "correct": "Cal", "options": ["Troy", "Jamie", "Kendall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCal.\n\n\tCalico was brought to Area 51 to become one of the first of the aliens' subjects and unlike the group, she was there alone, pregnant and drugged.  Though she wasn't allowed to move about on her own, she was able to sneak into the moon landing set to find Stanley Kubrick directing the proceedings.  It was, she claimed, Nixon's idea, and it was still all a ploy devised to ease humanity into a future of technological advancement.\r When Calico departs and leaves the others to ponder their new reality, they remain thankful that they have each other.  Soon after, Cal starts to feel different, knowing that it's almost time to give birth.  Worried that the aliens will take the child, he tries to hold back from giving birth but it's no use.  The two head to the moon landing set to give birth privately and Troy, knowing there's no other way, insists that he needs to cut the baby out.  It takes convincing and a lot of pain and blood, but Cal manages to cut the newborn out, allowing Troy to hold the baby for the first time.  Unfortunately, the creature manages to leap from his grasp and onto his face. \n"}]}
