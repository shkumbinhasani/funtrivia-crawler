Our third President. A great patriot, thinker, and writer, but perhaps he should have tried to free the slaves if he believed so strongly in equal rights. \n"}, {"text": "Jaw nod dims", "correct": "John Adams", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Adams.\n\n\t1797-1801. Our second Prez. His son, John Quincy Adams, was a President, too. \n"}, {"text": "Wool yam horrid tuft", "correct": "William Howard Taft & William H. Taft & William Taft & William H Taft", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Howard Taft & William H. Taft & William Taft & William H Taft\n\n\t1909-1913.

Young, handsome, rich, smart, and married to the beautiful Jackie, JFK was one of our most charismatic Presidents. He was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963. If you're in your 40s or older, you probably remember where you were when you heard the news. Lyndon B. Johnson, his VP, took over as President that evening. Tragically, his brother Robert was also assassinated while running for President, and his handsome son died in a plane crash. \n"}, {"text": "Franc land Dylan oh rows svelte", "correct": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\n\t1933-1945. FDR served longer as President than any other person. He was elected four times. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation helped to boost the U.S. out of the Depression. He led the nation through World War II, but died in office when the War was almost over. VP Harry S. Truman took over. (Now Presidents can serve only two four-year terms. A player points out that if a President dies in office and the VP takes over, the new Prez is allowed to run twice more IF he or she does not serve more than two years of the previous President's term--so a President could conceivably spend up to 10 years in office.)\r(Editor's note: Only the full name is acceptable as that is what the fracture represents.) \n"}, {"text": "Raw knelt gray gun", "correct": "Ronald Reagan", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRonald Reagan.\n\n\t1981-1989.

Harrison", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison & William Harrison & William H. Harrison\n\n\t1841, period. This is a sad story: poor guy died of longwindedness. After giving a 105-minute inaugural speech on a freezing March day (hatless), he contracted pneumonia and died! By the way, I left out poor James Garfield, 1881, who was shot by the deranged Charles Guiteau and later died of blood poisoning. \n"}]}
