Despite the fact that this mishap was purely accidental, the colonel is livid, and takes down Hawkeye's name and unit.  Naturally, the cowardly Frank is not supportive of Hawkeye at all!

Colonel Potter makes the command decision that Frank will work on the Korean wounded while Hawkeye takes care of the cantankerous colonel he encountered earlier.  Frank then proceeds to complain that Hawkeye 'always gets the cowboys and I get stuck with the Indians'.  An offended Colonel Potter claims that he is one-quarter Indian.  What Native American people does he claim in his ancestry?", "correct": "Cherokee", "options": ["Seminole", "Navajo", "Sioux"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCherokee.\n\n\tWhen Frank learns that Colonel Potter is one-fourth Cherokee is response is: 'Oh.

Zale wants to get out the poison pen, but BJ suggests a much more forgiving tone.  Zale is at his wit's end, he claims to have treated his wife like a queen, buying her everything from a beavercoat to bowling shoes, and putting her brother through college.  'I paid for every tooth in her mother's head,' Zale continues, amusingly.  The man is obviously a devoted husband. \n"}, {"text": "Now the scene shifts to Frank and Radar, who are inspecting some of the locals who regularly frequent the 4077th.  Walking down the line, Frank suspects each person, no matter how mundane their occupation, and treats each local with great contempt.  What item does Frank buy from a certain Mr. Park, a local peddler, during this careful shakedown?", "correct": "A cigarette lighter shaped as a gun", "options": ["A string of phony pearls", "An 'authentic' Korean vase", "A pair of straw sandles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cigarette lighter shaped as a gun.\n\n\tFrank effectively interrogates and searches all of the dangerous locals, including the laundress, a houseboy and Mr. Park.  He confiscates a ham sandwich from the boy, and also finds the gun lighter on Mr. Park's person.  After Radar explains that the 'gun' is really a lighter, Frank bargains for it.  Initially Radar, on behalf of Mr. Park, asks for $10, and Frank offers $5 in return. Radar goes to $7.50, and Frank counters with 'six and not a penny more'.  Radar claims, 'I can't say six in Korean.'  Frank responds, 'Well then say five and 100 pennies.'  Radar then tricks Frank by saying, 'Six and 100 pennies,' and Frank agrees. '$7', Radar then says, with a smile. \n"}, {"text": "BJ comes to Radar's office looking for Zale, and finds Radar involved in an intense game over the phone with his pal Sparky.  What game are the two of them playing long distance?", "correct": "Battleship", "options": ["Chess", "Hangman", "Clue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBattleship.\n\n\tRadar is ecstatic when he sinks Sparky's carrier, winning the game.  After he gets off the phone, BJ asks if Radar has seen Zale, but Radar is not aware of the Sergeant's whereabouts.  BJ notices that Radar is eating mushy ice cream, and asks Radar if he likes Chinese food and walks in the rain.  Apparently, BJ is feeling nostalgic about home, because his wife likes all these things (including mushy ice cream). \n"}, {"text": "In the post-op ward, Hawkeye tends to his patients, including that certain cantankerous Colonel that he encountered earlier in the episode.  Does the Colonel thank Hawkeye for saving his life on the operating table?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tColonel Striker does not thank Hawkeye, but he does 'let him off the hook' for earlier having splashed him with mud.  Striker suggests that Hawkeye is just doing his job, as he does when he commands his artillery unit.  Nobody ever thanks him for that dirty job, he comments.  Hawkeye takes the opportunity to facetiously thank the stubborn Colonel for not pressing charges against him. \n"}, {"text": "BJ continues to search for Sergeant Zale, and finally finds him in the hut of a local woman.  It seems that Zale has taken her as his 'moose' in revenge for what his wife has done to him.  What does he call his moose?", "correct": "Sooky", "options": ["Jun-hee", "Sashimi", "Leeka"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSooky.\n\n\tThough he can't speak a word of Korean, and she likewise cannot speak any English, they seem to get along very well.

What food item is in this vessel Frank unearths?", "correct": "Kimchi", "options": ["Bean sprouts", "Tofu", "Soju"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKimchi.\n\n\tKimchi, a spicy, pickled cabbage dish popular in Korean cuisine, is the deadly culprit here.  Hawkeye and BJ make fun of Frank as he digs up the jar with the kimchi.  BJ pokes at Frank, who has found 'fresh dirt', by saying, 'I saw that.  It was with Paul Muni and Luise Rainer.' (An allusion to 'The Good Earth'!)\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
