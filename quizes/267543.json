As strange as it may seem, it was predicted before it was found, in a landmark 1948 paper. What then-controversial theory was used to predict the presence of this radiation?", "correct": "Big Bang Theory", "options": ["Grand Unified Theory", "Steady-State Theory", "Black Hole Theory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig Bang Theory.\n\n\tThe Big Bang Theory refers to the idea that the universe, in its earliest moments, was small, hot, and dense, and that over the subsequent billions of years it has expanded and cooled. It does not address how the universe began, or what kicked it into existence. By definition, science deals only with the natural laws of the universe, so anything that happened \"before\" or \"outside\" is a separate question entirely. Before the universe as we know it existed, we can only guess whether time, matter and energy had any meaning at all, let alone the ones we're familiar with. Science picks up a tiny fraction of a second after the beginning, with the universe in an extremely hot, extremely dense state, and follows how the universe changed as it expanded and cooled.\r The Big Bang Theory was not widely accepted when it was first proposed by Belgian physicist Georges Lema\u00eetre. To many scientists, the idea that the universe had any beginning at all seemed like an awfully religious idea -- and their perception wasn't helped by the fact that Lema\u00eetre was a Roman Catholic priest! The successful prediction of a cosmic microwave background -- leftover thermal radiation from a much smaller and hotter universe -- by George Gamow, Ralph Alpher, and Robert Herman, was one of several pieces of evidence that forced physicists to sit up and pay attention. The Big Bang Theory is now generally accepted as the best description and explanation of the history of the universe. \n"}, {"text": "In 1964, well after theorists had first proposed its existence, the cosmic microwave background was discovered by two astronomers in Holmdel, New Jersey. Their names were Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, and only fourteen years later they would be Nobel laureates. How did they discover the universe's background radiation?", "correct": "They were trying to track down the persistent noise in their new, extraordinarily sensitive radio antenna.", "options": ["A scheduling mishap meant that there were 13 unused hours of telescope time, and they were just fooling around.", "They were looking for it after a tip-off from theorists at Princeton University.", "They were looking for residual background from a supernova, and found residual background from something much, much bigger."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey were trying to track down the persistent noise in their new, extraordinarily sensitive radio antenna.\n\n\tThe tale of Penzias and Wilson, radio astronomers at the great Bell Laboratories, is near and dear to experimentalists' hearts. Their story is one of the best examples that ever illustrated Isaac Asimov's famous observation that \"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny....'\" \r Their instrument was a horn reflector radio antenna, designed for use in satellite communications, and they spent over a year trying to figure out why it was reporting radio noise they could not explain. It was weak but persistent and the same from every direction, and at first -- unable to think of a suitable extraterrestrial source -- they assumed that the noise must be originating on Earth. They tried cleaning the instrument, taping over irregularities (such as rivets) in the telescope's surface, and removing a pair of pigeons that had nested in the antenna. (Penzias famously referred to the pigeon droppings as a \"white dielectric material.\") Finally, after having calculated that their instrument noise had a characteristic temperature of around 3 Kelvin, our heroes encountered a theory paper showing that the Big Bang would have left such background radiation behind, and the rest is history. The theorists (Robert Dicke and P.J.E. Peebles, based at Princeton University) and the experimentalists submitted a pair of papers to the \"Astrophysical Journal Letters,\" and suddenly the Big Bang was the only big-league theory in town. It had led to a prediction about the universe, and that prediction had turned out to be true; competing theories could no longer compete. \n"}, {"text": "The cosmic background is often described as having a temperature of 2.725 Kelvin - that's 2.725 degrees Celsius above absolute zero. What does it mean to say that these photons have a temperature?", "correct": "Their energy spectrum is characteristic of thermal radiation from a source at that temperature.", "options": ["If they hit an object at absolute zero, this is the maximum temperature to which they could heat that object.", "Temperature is a measure of kinetic energy: these photons move more quickly than 1-Kelvin photons.", "The \"cosmic microwave background temperature\" is really the temperature of the vacuum the photons are moving through."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir energy spectrum is characteristic of thermal radiation from a source at that temperature.\n\n\tPure thermal radiation follows what is called a \"black body spectrum\" - so named because it's the spectrum of light that would be emitted by a perfectly black object that absorbs all the light that strikes it. The cosmic microwave background is the most perfect black body spectrum that has ever been measured - in fact, for the published COBE graph of the spectrum, the line that traces the theoretical calculation is famously thicker than the error bars on the data!\r The cosmic microwave background dates from the moment when the universe first became transparent to light; in effect, it gives the thermal spectrum of the universe just before that moment, about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Everything was quite hot then, of course, but since then even the background radiation has cooled: as the universe expands, so too do the wavelengths of the photons (a phenomenon called redshift, since it shifts the wavelengths toward the red end of the spectrum). Astronomers searching the sky eons from now might not ever see this background - the photons will have redshifted too much to be seen. \n"}, {"text": "The cosmic microwave background is sometimes referred to as \"relic radiation\" -- light left over from a truly ancient time. But it isn't a relic of the universe's first moments, of the hot plasma posited by theorists; instead, it's thought to come from about 380,000 years after the very beginning, just after an epoch called \"recombination.\" What happened during this time period?", "correct": "Neutral hydrogen and helium atoms formed.", "options": ["The first stars ignited.", "Matter began coalescing into stars.", "Light atomic nuclei, like helium and lithium, formed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeutral hydrogen and helium atoms formed.\n\n\tOne interesting effect of the cooling of the universe is that it allowed the formation of stable particles, then atomic nuclei, then neutral atoms. For these things to exist for any meaningful period of time, the universe has to be cool enough (that is, low-enough energy) that they won't be knocked apart immediately -- and that condition just wasn't true for a shockingly long time. The first hadrons -- composite particles like protons and neutrons -- weren't formed until about the universe was about a millionth of a second old, which may not seem long by human standards but is an eternity by particle physics rules. It took another three or so minutes for light nuclei (like deuterium, helium and lithium) to start forming; nearly all the light elements in the universe were made before the universe was twenty minutes old. Electrically neutral atoms took much longer, however: it doesn't take much energy to knock an electron off an atom. The process of forming neutral atoms, via the capture of negatively charged electrons by positively charged atomic nuclei, is called recombination, and is thought to have taken place when the universe was about 380,000 years old.\r Before recombination, the universe was opaque. Any photons emitted by matter -- thermal radiation -- were quickly scattered and re-absorbed by charged particles. When the universe became electrically neutral, however, the photons were no longer scattered so frequently; they passed right through. The universe was transparent, and any photon emitted from that point on was likely just to keep on going. The cosmic microwave background radiation that we see comes from what's called \"the surface of last scattering,\" namely the spherical surface of the then-universe at the moment when recombination decoupled matter from radiation. \n"}, {"text": "Very nearly uniform in every direction, the cosmic microwave background shows an early universe in thermal equilibrium -- but perhaps it's a little too uniform. In fact, its sameness was initially rather awkward for astrophysicists to explain, because it gives rise to something called the Horizon Problem. What is the crux of the problem?", "correct": "Different parts of the universe should NOT be in thermal equilibrium, due to the vast distances between them.", "options": ["We should not be able to observe as much of the background as we do.", "As mapped by the cosmic microwave background, the universe appears much more curved than it should be.", "So many stars and galaxies have arisen since the early universe that the background should no longer be uniform."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDifferent parts of the universe should NOT be in thermal equilibrium, due to the vast distances between them.\n\n\tIf two areas of the universe are in thermal equilibrium, this means that they are the same temperature -- which, as students of thermodynamics know, can only happen if there's some heat exchange between them. This means an exchange of photons, and that's where things get dicey, because the speed of light is fixed. The cosmic microwave background photons that we see coming from the galactic north are 13.3 billion years old; the photons coming from the south are 13.3 billion years old; so the \"distance\" between the two is 26.6 billion light-years, meaning that it would take nearly twice the total age of the universe for a photon from one region to arrive in the other, and there simply hasn't been enough time for the two regions to reach thermal equilibrium. If you wind back the clock, the same is true of the \"surface of thermal equilibrium\" whence the CMB photons came -- the largest region of equilibrium would have been only 380,000 light-years wide, but we observe equilibrium on a vastly wider scale.\r To solve this problem, astrophysicists have formulated Inflationary Theory, which posits that, in its very earliest moments, the universe was small enough to achieve thermal equilibrium among all its parts. Then, in an infinitesimal fraction of a second, it expanded exponentially -- a brief period of incredibly rapid inflation. Although this requires a new (and not well understood) type of energy and field, it explains a variety of strange phenomena, and even predicts the small variations that we DO see in the cosmic microwave background: small, quantum fluctuations in the inflation field effectively \"seeded\" the universe with density pockets that grew into large-scale structures. \n"}, {"text": "Tiny changes in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background reflect variations in the density of the early universe. What mechanism is believed to have made some regions more dense and others more rarefied?", "correct": "Sound waves", "options": ["Matter transport through wormholes", "Electromagnetic waves", "Supernovae"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSound waves.\n\n\tWhat we call sound waves are carried via vibrations, which stretch some regions while compressing others. Most of the sounds we encounter in everyday life are carried by vibrations in the air, and new swimmers soon learn that vibrations in water also carry sound.\r At this point, science fiction fans may be starting to mutter. After all, it's a well-known fact that space is silent: in a vacuum, there's nothing to vibrate. So how can we talk about sound waves traveling through the early universe? It turns out that this is not a problem: the early universe was so much denser that sound waves, triggered by density disturbances left by cosmic inflation, could indeed travel through. Since all the sound waves began at the same moment, the result was much like the tones and overtones of a musical instrument, forever recorded in the cosmic microwave background. \n"}, {"text": "Temperature maps of the cosmic microwave background reveal a striking feature. Over the entire field of view, one side of the sky appears a bit colder and the other side appears a bit warmer; the difference is about seven thousandths of a degree Celsius. This is by far the largest temperature variation in the CMB. What causes it?", "correct": "The motion of the solar system through space distorts our view of the CMB photons.", "options": ["The region of the universe where the Big Bang occurred still retains some extra heat.", "Microwave signals from Earth contaminate the signal.", "Half of the universe is expanding faster than the other half, and therefore appears cooler."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe motion of the solar system through space distorts our view of the CMB photons.\n\n\tThere's a great image of this at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory site; the set of three pictures was once used as the cover of an issue of \"Physics Today\", and it's well worth a Google. The top picture shows the \"dipole anisotropy,\" a variation of one part in a thousand. The middle picture, which has the dipole filtered out, shows a band across the middle corresponding to the heat from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The picture at the bottom has both the dipole and galactic emissions removed, and shows the underlying structure of the CMB. Here the differences between hot and cold are only one part in 100,000!\r The dipole anisotropy is a result of the Doppler effect, which is familiar to anyone who's ever stood by the side of a road as an ambulance moves by at high speed. When the ambulance is coming towards you, the sound waves from its sirens appear compressed, and you hear them at a higher pitch than when it's standing still. As the ambulance moves away, the sound waves seem stretched, and sound lower-pitched. The same thing happens to light waves. If we're moving toward a region of the universe, its CMB photons appear to have a higher frequency and thus represent a hotter temperature; the reverse happens for regions we're moving away from. \n"}, {"text": "Since the cosmic microwave background is made up of light waves, we can use well-known techniques of wave analysis to analyze it. One useful tool involves looking at the angular sizes of variations in the CMB. It turns out that the largest fluctuations in the background radiation are on the scale of about one degree. What does this tell us about the universe?", "correct": "The universe is basically flat.", "options": ["There is about as much antimatter in the universe as there is matter.", "The universe has a small-scale \"clone.\"", "The universe is ten times older than we had thought from other evidence."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe universe is basically flat.\n\n\tOne of the most basic questions in cosmology is the shape of the universe. We know it is vast, possibly infinite; but is it curved? It can be hard to imagine what a \"curved\" universe would mean in four dimensions (space and time), so let's think about it in two. Imagine a two-dimensional universe. It could be flat, like a tabletop; it could be positively curved, like the outside surface of a balloon; or it could be negatively curved, like the sides of a saddle. You can tell what the curvature is by measuring how geometrical figures (like triangles and parallel lines) behave. In a flat geometry, the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees -- but in a positively curved geometry, like the surface of the Earth, the angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees.\r When we look at the scale of variations in the cosmic microwave background, we're essentially measuring how vast triangles drawn on the universe behave. The angular size that we measure for the largest fluctuations depends on the geometry of that part of the universe which the photons have traversed on their long journey. Our measurements of the CMB tell us that the universe is quite flat -- at least, to within our ability to measure it! \n"}, {"text": "It's a challenge to find the best placement for a satellite observatory; you need stable positioning, a clear field of view, and a nice line of sight back to Earth. For deep-sky observations like probes into the cosmic microwave background, it's also critical to block out contamination from the Sun. Luckily, the law of gravity says that there's one quasi-stable point in the Earth-Sun system where the Earth is always blocking the Sun. What is the name of this point?", "correct": "The second Lagrange point (L2)", "options": ["The Trojan point", "The first Lagrange point (L1)", "The Nemesis point"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe second Lagrange point (L2).\n\n\tIn any three-body gravitational system where the third body (a satellite, for example) is much less massive than the other two, there are five Lagrange points where the gravitational forces of the larger two bodies balance in such a way that the point is motionless relative to them. The Lagrange points rotate and revolve with the larger bodies; their position relative to those bodies is always fixed. Although they aren't completely stable (meaning that a small displacement can cause trouble), a satellite can stay on station relatively simply; gravity takes care of revolution and rotation.\r L1 is the Lagrange point on a straight line between the two main bodies. Currently used for solar observatories (since their view is never blocked) in the Earth-Sun system, in the Earth-Moon system it's the top candidate for a way station for trips between those bodies. L2, behind the smaller body on a straight line from the larger, is perfect for deep-sky observations in the Earth-Sun system. L3, behind the larger body on a straight line from the smaller, naturally can't be observed from Earth; a popular (now disproven) idea in mid-twentieth century science fiction placed a \"counter-Earth\" at that point. \r L4 and L5 -- also known as Trojan points -- are much less stable than the first three Lagrange points. L4 is ahead of the smaller body in its orbit, and L5 is behind it. These are most famous in the Sun-Jupiter system: clusters of asteroids lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit, orbiting themselves around L4 and L5. By convention, L4 asteroids are \"Greeks\" and L5 asteroids are \"Trojans\"; the asteroids themselves are named after heroes from the two opposing sides of \"The Iliad.\" \n"}, {"text": "Given how hard astrophysicists have struggled to make precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background, you might be forgiven for thinking that it's an extremely arcane phenomenon, well out of reach for mere mortals. However, you can see it for yourself in an old piece of equipment. In which of these ways does the CMB show itself?", "correct": "As part of the static when you tune an analog television between channels", "options": ["As the buzzing sound when you turn on a cheap fluorescent light bulb", "As the distortions that make stars appear to twinkle", "As UV-A radiation that makes light-colored objects glow eerily"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs part of the static when you tune an analog television between channels.\n\n\tWhen an analog TV set is tuned between channels, about 1-2% of that familiar black-and-white \"snow\" is the cosmic microwave background radiation. It isn't much to make measurements from -- and, as television sets transition to digital, this behavior will be lost -- but it's downright amazing to think that an old television set can pick up signal from the Big Bang.\r I hope you've enjoyed this tour of one of the most fascinating phenomena in modern cosmology.
