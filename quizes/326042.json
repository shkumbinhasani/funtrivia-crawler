Why don't we start with something that packs a punch: Long Island Iced Tea.  That sound good?  Before I hand this over though...\n\nWhich of these New York City boroughs isn't on Long Island?", "correct": "The Bronx", "options": ["Queens", "Brooklyn", "All three can be found on Long Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bronx.\n\n\tYes, Long Island is long and yes, they did have the first Long Island Iced Tea there (in the '70s no less), but The Bronx, while part of New York City, is on the mainland of New York.  Five boroughs make up New York City with both Queens and Brooklyn on Long Island, Staten Island to the southwest, and Manhattan Island in the center, and the Bronx on the mainland.  To say the least, Long Island is a busy place; it's the most populated island in the United States.  Heading further east, you'd drive through Nassau County, Suffolk County, the Hamptons, and Montauk on the coast.\rA Long Island Iced Tea, at least the one I made for you, is a highball drink with a generous serving of gin, rum, vodka, tequila, and triple sec, on the rocks.  You can mix it up a little, but the drink usually consists of the 'white' liquors.  And it looks an awful lot like an iced tea... \n"}, {"text": "Let's mix it up with a drink that shouldn't mix its layers up.  How would you like a B-52?  Before I let you take your shot...\n\nWhich of these songs was not performed by the New Wave band, The B-52s?", "correct": "Summer in the City", "options": ["Rock Lobster", "Love Shack", "Roam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSummer in the City.\n\n\tA U.S. band from Georgia, the B-52s are known for their unique, upbeat dance music.  Originally forming in the 1970s, their first single was \"Rock Lobster\" in 1978.  \"Love Shack\" and \"Roam\" weren't released until 1989 on the \"Cosmic Thing\" album.  While \"Roam\" is the highest-ranking of these three singles on the Billboard charts (it got to #3), the other two songs have been cited by Rolling Stones on their Top 500 lists.  \"Summer in the City\" is a song by The Lovin' Spoonful released in 1966.  It hit #1 on the Billboard charts.\rThe B-52 I'm making for you is one part Kahlua, one part Irish Cream, and one part Grand Marnier (an orange-flavoured liqueur).  All three are layered, not mixed.  Take it all in one go! \n"}, {"text": "A bit fancier, you say?  Well why don't I treat you to a Cosmo?  Cosmopolitan to be exact.  While I mix one up, how about another question?\n\nCosmopolitans were popularized as a drink often ordered by characters on which HBO TV show?", "correct": "Sex and the City", "options": ["The Sopranos", "Flight of the Conchords", "Six Feet Under"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSex and the City.\n\n\tA bit swankier than the other drinks I could've offered you, eh?  The Cosmopolitan was a favourite drink of Carrie Bradshaw, columnist writer from the HBO show \"Sex and the City\" (played by Sarah Jessica Parker).  The drink symbolizes the upscale lifestyle of the Manhattanites on the show, and one can be seen in almost every episode.  The Cosmo was around for years before the show came along, but it's a prominent feature of this one.  Cosmopolitan is also a women's magazine originally created in the late 1880s.\rThe Cosmopolitan is served straight-up in a cocktail glass.  It always contains vodka and also includes triple sec, lime juice, and cranberry juice- all of these are mixed into a shaker before serving.  Bottoms up! \n"}, {"text": "I'll let you dry off with this one.  Would you like one olive or two in your Martini?  While you decide, how about I pose another question to you?\n\nJames Bond, in Ian Fleming's \"Casino Royale\", named the Vesper Martini after which of these?", "correct": "A woman", "options": ["A car", "His mother", "A supervillain organization"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA woman.\n\n\tJames Bond first appeared in Ian Fleming's spy novel, \"Casino Royale\" (which was later remade as a James Bond film starring Daniel Craig in 2006).  Since then, his penchant for enjoying a good ol' 'shaken, not stirred' martini has been unmatched (although he does enjoy other drinks too).  Vesper Lynd appears in this first book as a double agent although in both the film and the novel, she and Bond do fall in love with each other.  In the movie, her actions and subsequent death result in Bond's demeanor in the sequel, \"Quantum of Solace\".  The Vesper Martini, outlined in the novel, is three measures of gin, one of vodka, and one half of Kina Lillet.  Once shaken, a thin slice of lemon peel is added.\rMy martinis are a bit more simplistic (and a bit less expensive).  Served in a cocktail glass, your Martini is gin and dry vermouth with an olive or two, straight-up.  I'll add it to your tab. \n"}, {"text": "Mint?  Yeah, I can do that too.  How about a Mojito?  A Cuban specialty.  Can I ask you something though?\n\nThe Mojito was a favourite drink of what American author who frequented Cuban bars (and lived in Cuba for many years)?", "correct": "Ernest Hemingway", "options": ["Ambrose Bierce", "John Steinbeck", "George Orwell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErnest Hemingway.\n\n\tFor seven years, Ernest Hemingway (who wrote \"The Old Man and the Sea\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\") resided in the Hotel Ambos Mundos in Havana, Cuba and would perform a ritualistic routine of ordering drinks from two different bars in the old region of the city before returning to work on his novels.  Both bars (including the Bodeguita del medio, now a local landmark) now contain memorials to the late author and Nobel Prize winner.  In the early 1960s, Hemingway returned to the United States before committing suicide.\rA Mojito, according to the IBA, contains white rum, lime juice, sugar, and soda water.  The key ingredient is sprigs of mint leaves that give the drink a distinctive taste.  Can I interest you in another? \n"}, {"text": "Fancy some tequila?  Why don't I treat you to a Margarita, on the house?  Let me just get you a glass and ask you that question.\n\nWho wrote the song \"Margaritaville\" in 1977?", "correct": "Jimmy Buffet", "options": ["Steely Dan", "Sting", "Steve Miller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJimmy Buffet.\n\n\tPossibly Jimmy Buffet's most popular (and profitable) songs, \"Margaritaville\" peaked at #1 on the U.S. Billboard and Canadian charts.  Originally from Buffet's eighth album, \"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\", the song has also spurred a number of Buffet-licensed products and services including an American restaurant chain.  In 2009, \"South Park\" won an Emmy Award with an episode of the same name.  There is no actual town of Margaritaville...I was disappointed too.\rMargaritas are a tequila-heavy drink, often served in a salt-rimmed glass.  According to the IBA, I get to serve this to you with seven parts tequila, four parts triple sec, and three parts lime juice.  Because the Margarita is so popular, different variations with different fruits are used, and the drink can be served in several types of glasses.  No one ever really omits the tequila though... \n"}, {"text": "Let's give things a bit of spice!  What do you say to a Bloody Mary?  I'll crack open some Tabasco if you wouldn't mind answering my question.\n\nWhich of these British monarchs was nicknamed 'Bloody Mary'?", "correct": "Queen Mary I", "options": ["Queen Elizabeth I", "Queen Mary II", "Queen Anne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen Mary I.\n\n\tAlthough Queen Mary I is notable for her sixteenth century reign in which she reinstated Roman Catholicism, her moniker of 'Bloody Mary' was gained after she had placed hundreds of people under arrest to be burned at the stake.  After Mary's reign, her successor, Elizabeth I, reversed the decision to change the country's religious standpoint.  Bloody Mary is also the common name for a character in North American folklore.  To summon the demonic Bloody Mary, one must stand in front of a mirror and chant her name three times (though there are variations of the procedure).\rThere are several different types of Bloody Mary, and I try to avoid them all by simply asking 'how spicy?'  A Bloody Mary, according to the IBA, consists of six parts tomato juice, three parts vodka, and one part lemon juice.  Tabasco and Worcestershire Sauce are commonly added for spice and the one I'm handing you comes with a stalk of celery.  Apparently, Hemingway liked this one too!  I like this guy's taste! \n"}, {"text": "More tequila?  You're gonna run me dry!  Let's do a Tequila Sunrise this time around and mix things up.\n\nIn 1988, \"Tequila Sunrise\", starring Mel Gibson, was released in theaters.  Was it nominated for any Academy Awards?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\t\"Tequila Sunrise\" (1988) was nominated for 'Best Cinematography' but lost to \"Mississippi Burning\".  Starring Mel Gibson, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kurt Russell, \"Tequila Sunrise\" was about a drug-related crime in Los Angeles which evolved into both a crime thriller and a love story.  The film earned over $100,000,000 in the box office.  \"Tequila Sunrise\" was also a song by The Eagles released fifteen years earlier.\rA Tequila Sunrise is a cocktail with all of the appropriate reds, oranges, and yellows of a sunrise.  Served in a highball glass, the drink is three parts Tequila, three parts orange juice, and one part grenadine.  As far as I know, sunshine is not actually in the ingredients.  I'll be courteous and not charge you for it. \n"}, {"text": "You're looking kinda rough right now.  How about something simple: the Screwdriver.  Can't go wrong with a Screwdriver.  Got time for a question?\n\nWhat is the proper shape for the end of a Phillips-head screwdriver?", "correct": "A cross", "options": ["A hexagon", "A square", "A triangle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cross.\n\n\tScrewdrivers are what they are- they turn screws.  While screwdrivers are normally simple, manual tools, drill bits can be used for motorized drills to emulate the functions performed by your everyday screwdriver.  There are several sizes and types of these as well.  A Phillips-head screwdriver is likely to be the most common.  During and after World War II, American auto manufacturers picked up on the design (newly patented) and put them to use on assembly lines before they gained popularity in other industries.  Square-head and hexagon (or allen key) screwdrivers are also quite common.\rA screwdriver is an easy, common drink as well.  One part vodka and two parts orange juice; that's it!  Down the gullet, eh? \n"}, {"text": "Let's go back to New York for one more drink: the Manhattan.  With a cherry on top (just like the drink), here's your question.\n\nWhich of these films was not set in Manhattan?", "correct": "The Black Dahlia", "options": ["Ghostbusters", "Cloverfield", "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Black Dahlia.\n\n\tThe world-famous Manhattan is notable for being the the 'financial center of the world' as it contains many of the United States' most prominent institutions (including the Stock Exchange and Wall Street) and telecom companies.  In addition, many famous neighbourhoods including SoHo, Harlem, and Little Italy can be found here.  Central Park is in the middle of the neighbourhood in addition to the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, Times Square, and at one point, the World Trade Center Towers.  \"The Black Dahlia\" was set in Los Angeles.\rA Manhattan is one of the more complicated drinks I've made tonight (and one of the more costly).  A regulation Manhattan contains Canadian Whiskey, Vermouth, Bitters, and a maraschino cherry all served in a cocktail glass, straight-up.  Will that be all? \n"}]}
