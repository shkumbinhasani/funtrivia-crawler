Who is this woman?", "correct": "Lydia", "options": ["Lana", "Laverne", "Lorraine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLydia.\n\n\tIf you aren't familiar with the song, it's entitled 'Lydia, the Tattooed Lady' and was written by Harold Arlen and E. Y. Harburg.  It was most famously performed by the Marx Brothers in the 1939 film 'At the Circus'.  \r Klinger performs the following from the song: 'Oh Lydia, oh Lydia, say have you met Lydia, Oh Lydia the Tatooed Lady.' \n"}, {"text": "BJ is handling an especially difficult case in the O.R.  When his patient begins to hemorrhage he asks for a clamp from the nurse assisting at his table, only to have her run out of the room.  Played by Susan Blanchard, her given name is Sandra, but what is her surname?", "correct": "Cooper", "options": ["Taylor", "Anderson", "Devers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCooper.\n\n\tRather than immediately retrieving a clamp for BJ, Cooper runs out of the O.R.  She appears squeamish from the combination of blood and the sight of the faces of such very young soldiers.  Margaret becomes very upset about this dereliction of duty and angrily confronts Nurse Cooper immediately after the operating session. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret and Charles find themselves uncomfortably alone (at least, for Margaret) at a table in the mess tent.  They have the good fortune of being joined by Father Mulcahy, Hawkeye and BJ before long.  When all have settled down to their meal, the complaining begins.  What is Charles specific complaint about the meal?", "correct": "They haven't chilled the salad forks", "options": ["The milk is obviously powdered", "The coffee is most likely domestic", "They haven't included soup spoons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey haven't chilled the salad forks.\n\n\t'You have single-handedly taken all the whimsy out of this war,' says BJ to Charles.  While the rest of the officers discuss problems with the food, Charles is reminiscing about conditions back home with his serviced meals, complete with all the amenities.  The only amenities he will find in Korea are the multi-compartmented dinner trays and the fresh local goat's milk. \n"}, {"text": "While the officers continue their gabfest in the mess tent, Radar approaches the bed of the tattooed patient, Corporal Hendrix, in the post-op tent.  Radar informs Hendrix of the bad news; which of his tattoos was defaced by his battle wound and subsequent surgery?", "correct": "Louise", "options": ["Claire", "Susan", "Teresa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLouise.\n\n\tHendrix is very disappointed to find out about his Louise tattoo.  According to Radar, 'Her face is still pretty, and her legs are the greatest...'  Hendrix interjects, 'What about the rest of her?'  Radar responds, 'Uh, there isn't any.'  Hendrix laments, 'Why couldn't it have been Betty?  Louise was fantastic.  Whenever I got the hiccups, she'd do stuff that would knock your eyes out.' \n"}, {"text": "Hendrix provides Radar with a number of reasons to get a tattoo.  Which of these is not one of these benefits, according to Corporal Hendrix?", "correct": "You appear sophisticated", "options": ["The women won't leave you alone", "You look tough", "You feel great"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou appear sophisticated.\n\n\tAfter hearing these three reasons (in particular, the one regarding women not leaving one alone) Radar is convinced.

It appears that Radar is going to bolster his manhood with a new tattoo. \n"}, {"text": "Major Houlihan has had just about enough of Sandra, the nurse who has been unable to perform her duties on several occasions.  She takes the case to Colonel Potter.  Does Potter accept Margaret's transfer request for this nurse?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe Colonel overrides Margaret's transfer request, much to the Major's chagrin.  Margaret calls Nurse Cooper a 'crier'.  The Colonel retorts that his wife was also a crier, but that 'after a few months she settled down and for 38 years come April, she's been a mighty fine wife'.  Potter gets Margaret to agree grudgingly to allow Cooper a chance to stick around. \n"}, {"text": "In the Swamp, Hawkeye and BJ make silly chit-chat about world affairs.  Charles is offended when his two tentmates disparage 'one of the greatest military minds of the century'.  To whom does Charles refer?", "correct": "Douglas MacArthur", "options": ["Dwight Eisenhower", "Harry Truman", "George Marshall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDouglas MacArthur.\n\n\tActually, their dialogue is quite tame, really, but Charles is in no mood for their vaudevillian humor.  However, his defense of MacArthur falls on deaf ears.  Hawkeye 'concedes' that MacArthur has 'got the whole country wearing sunglasses', while BJ, who calls MacArthur 'Dugout Doug', adds, 'Even my wife smokes a corncob pipe.'  To add insult to injury, BJ and Hawkeye, when requested for once to end an argument intelligently, give Charles a collective raspberry. \n"}, {"text": "Knowing that Radar means to get a tattoo, Hawkeye and BJ go into action to try and prevent the little tyke from following through with his plan.

He orders a grape nehi, but not because he enjoys it.  According to Rimmerman, he is not allowed to drink any alcoholic beverages for six months because he contracted hepatitis after getting a 'mother' tattoo.  \r Radar buys into the Sergeant's story until Klinger gives the whole ploy away.  Radar is indignant, and claims he will get a snake tattoo immediately. \n"}, {"text": "An event occurs that gives Margaret a change of heart about the nurse that she means to have transferred off the compound.
