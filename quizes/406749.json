{"id": "406749", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 28\" [6] Quiz | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 28"], "questions": [{"text": "Leg 11 of the race took place in what Chinese city?", "correct": "Shenzhen", "options": ["Beijing", "Guangzhou", "Shanghai"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShenzhen.\n\n\tLeaving Bali, Indonesia early in the morning, the final four teams ripped open their clue envelopes and rushed to the airport to book flights heading two thousand miles north to the city of Shenzhen, China.  All four teams had the same flight into China and didn't need to look much further than the departure hall of Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport for their next clue box.  Confusingly, teams were told, from here, to travel by bus and train to the Eiffel Tower to find their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Team members completing the Leg 11 Road Block in China had to fill which of these?", "correct": "Passports", "options": ["Jars", "Wardrobes", "Boxes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPassports.\n\n\tWhat teams needed to discover was that their clue directing them to the Eiffel Tower was actually sending them to a landmark-themed amusement park in Shenzhen known as Window of the World, and once teams disembarked the train at Window of the World Station they could head topside to find their clue on the first deck of the scale model of the Parisian tower. This turned out to be a Road Block task for which one member of each team (Tyler, Dana, Burnie, and Sheri) had to grab a fake passport and search the park for six different monuments at which they could stamp their books and turn them in (if correctly stamped) to get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "Only one team completed the 'Commuter Cycle' Detour task in China (in Leg 11).  Which team was it?", "correct": "Sheri and Cole", "options": ["Burnie and Ashley", "Dana and Matt", "Tyler and Korey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheri and Cole.\n\n\tOnce teams left the Window of the World they needed to take the subway to Lychee Park and find the Moon Bridge to start their Detour.  Teams attempting 'Commuter Cycle' needed to change into suits and join the local commuters by learning how to travel via self-balancing electric unicycles.  Holding a briefcase containing their next clue in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other, they needed to successfully complete a course while avoiding touching the ground in order to continue racing.  Only Sheri and Cole completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "The 'Master of Arts' Detour task, completed in Leg 11 (in China), involved which of these?", "correct": "Paintings", "options": ["Pottery", "Tilework", "Statues"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaintings.\n\n\tIf teams didn't complete 'Commuter Cycle' they instead headed to the 'Master of Arts' challenge.  Visiting the Dafen Oil Painting Village, teams had to a plaza to find one painter in a group of artists with a red and yellow marked paintbrush who would lead them to a nearby gallery.  Once at the gallery teams needed to properly assemble and hang several paintings to proper design specifications at which point the gallery owner would hand over their next clue.  Tyler and Korey, Dana and Matt, and Burnie and Ashley completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated from the race at the end of Leg 11?", "correct": "Burnie and Ashley", "options": ["Sheri and Cole", "Tyler and Korey", "Dana and Matt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurnie and Ashley.\n\n\tFinishing their Detour tasks, teams received a photo of their eleventh and final Pit Stop, directing them to the uniquely-built Shenzhen Civic Center.  If teams could locate the building, they could search on foot for Phil, waiting at the Shenzhen Library Terrace.  Tyler and Korey continued their lead streak, winning their fifth leg of the race (and third in a row).  Although Burnie and Ashley finished their Detour task quicker than Sheri and Cole, they spent too long searching for the Pit Stop and were overtaken.  The result was their elimination, leaving three teams. \n"}, {"text": "Returning to the United States in Leg 12, teams completed a Road Block task jumping from which of these?", "correct": "A building", "options": ["A cliff", "A plane", "A crane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA building.\n\n\tTeams departed from Shenzhen at the start of Leg 12, riding to Guangzhou and taking a seven thousand mile flight over the Pacific (in premium class) to Los Angeles, California, their last stop in a race around the world.  Upon landing at LAX, they were able to hop into cabs, head to Downtown L.A., and find their next clue box in front of Angelus Plaza. It was the first Road Block of the leg, and for this task the teams chose someone to, while tethered, leap for their clue hanging one hundred and thirty feet above the ground.  If they failed they'd need to leap again.  Matt, Sheri, and Tyler completed this task. \n"}, {"text": "Following the first Road Block task encountered in Leg 12, teams travelled by helicopter from Los Angeles to what nearby city?", "correct": "Santa Barbara", "options": ["Pasadena", "Anaheim", "San Diego"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSanta Barbara.\n\n\tWhen team members performed their leaps of faith for the Road Block, they were allowed to hop into a helicopter and fly ninety miles north to the city of Santa Barbara.  Once there they could head to Santa Barbara Harbor, hop into a provided dinghy, and begin searching through the marina for a boat by the name of 'Theresa Ann'.  If they could locate this craft they could receive their next clue from the fisherman onboard and continue racing. \n"}, {"text": "Visiting Rattlesnake Canyon in the final leg, both team members participated in a mountaineering task.  What type of clue was this?", "correct": "Route Info", "options": ["Detour", "Road Block", "Intersection"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoute Info.\n\n\tFollowing their boating excursion, teams needed to make their way by taxi to Gibraltar Rock, high above Santa Barbara in Rattlesnake Canyon.  Here, both team members needed to work together, performing some synchronized mountaineering to get their next clue.  While one team member performed a Tyrolean traverse to get the first half of their clue on a guideline, the other would be given enough slack to perform a rappel down the side of Gibraltar rock for the second half.  When they had both sides, they could pull each other back to the starting point and continue racing. \n"}, {"text": "The final Road Block of the race forced teams to remember which of these?", "correct": "Hashtags", "options": ["Currencies", "Flags", "Languages"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHashtags.\n\n\tOnce teams finished their mountaineering task they received nothing more than a wine label, and with this they could lead themselves to the Grassini Family Vineyards in Santa Ynez where their clue would be waiting at the end of the driveway.  This turned out to be the final Road Block task wherein Dana, Cole, and Korey had to recall the events of the race, arranging lettered wine barrel lids to spell out city names based on hashtags seen in clues on the race course.  If they could correctly order, match, and spell the necessary destinations, they could get their last clue. \n"}, {"text": "Which team won \"The Amazing Race 28\"?", "correct": "Dana and Matt", "options": ["Tyler and Korey", "Sheri and Cole", "Burnie and Ashley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDana and Matt.\n\n\tWhen team members completed the wine barrel Road Block correctly, they were informed that they could make their way to the Finish Line on the grounds of the Grassini Family Vineyards; all they needed to do was find it.  With the lead that they retained heading out from the first Road Block of the leg, Dana and Matt ended up winning the final leg of the race and, in turn, the entirety of \"The Amazing Race 28\", taking home the one million dollar prize.  They were followed by Sheri and Cole in second place and Tyler and Korey in third. \n"}]}
