{"id": "388515", "name": "Feline Groovy Quiz | Famous Animals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Famous Animals", "Cats in Entertainment"], "questions": [{"text": "Featured in \"The Aristocats\", Scat Cat was proficient with which of these instruments?", "correct": "Trumpet", "options": ["Trombone", "Tuba", "Saxophone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrumpet.\n\n\t\"Ev'rybody wants to be a cat, because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at.\"\r While Scat Cat only played a small role in the 1970 film \"The Aristocats\", this swingin' cat proved to be a memorable one in the animal cast, being the leader of a jazz band holing up in a dilapidated Parisian house.  Granting refuge to Duchess, her kittens, and Thomas O'Malley, Scat Cat would later return in the film's climax to help send off the evil Edgar.  The character was voiced by Scatman Crothers, perhaps best known for his role as Dick Halloran in \"The Shining\". \n"}, {"text": "What fat, orange cat danced to the music video of the Black Eyed Peas' \"Hey Mama\" in his first live-action(ish) movie?", "correct": "Garfield", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarfield.\n\n\t\"Garfield: The Movie\" showed up in theatres in 2004, twenty-six years after his debut in comic strips, though the world didn't necessarily take to his live-action version voiced by Bill Murray.  Critically-panned, but still raking in a ton in the box office, the film featured Garfield, living with Jon Arbuckle, as he dealt with the introduction of Odie-- a role played by a real-life dog in the movie while Garfield himself was completely CGI-ed in.  Of course, Garfield also appeared in a series of animated films over the years as well as in his animated TV show \"Garfield and Friends\" which aired in the 1990s.\rThe Black Eyed Peas don't appear in-person in \"Garfield: The Movie\", but their music video appearing on a TV sparks a major plot point involving Garfield and Odie dancing. \n"}, {"text": "There's a dance-fight scene involving cats in what 2011 movie also featuring Humpty Dumpty?", "correct": "Puss in Boots", "options": ["Cats vs. Dogs", "Rango", "The Cat in the Hat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuss in Boots.\n\n\tOccurring earlier on in the movie, the dance battle features Antonio Banderas' Puss in Boots facing off against a cat wearing a mask in a one-on-one Latin dance battle and swordfight.  The cat is later revealed to be his eventual love interest, Kitty Softpaws, played by Salma Hayek.  The film is a side-adventure in the \"Shrek\" universe from which Puss originated (in \"Shrek 2\") and featured a number of other fairy tale mainstays (including Humpty Dumpty, the goose who laid the golden eggs, and Jack and Jill. Director Chris Miller was also a story artist for the other \"Shrek\" movies and Dreamworks' \"Madagascar\". \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes a cat's gotta groove.  While the cow jumped over the moon in the classic nursery rhyme, what instrument did the cat play?", "correct": "Fiddle", "options": ["Drums", "Flute", "Tambourine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFiddle.\n\n\t\"Hey diddle diddle,\rThe cat and the fiddle,\rThe cow jumped over the moon.\rThe little dog laughed,\rTo see such fun,\rAnd the dish ran away with the spoon.\"\r Hundreds of years old, this nursery rhyme's complete origins are unknown though some attribute its lines to deep Christian allegories and Greek subtexts.  From what we understand, cats can not play fiddles in real life, though I'm sure I'll be proven wrong the moment this question is played. \n"}, {"text": "MC Skat Kat appeared in what Paula Abdul music video in the late 1980s?", "correct": "Opposites Attract", "options": ["Forever Your Girl", "Cold Hearted", "Straight Up"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOpposites Attract.\n\n\tPerhaps one of the greatest things not to break out of the 1980s, MC Skat Kat really only appeared in Abdul's \"Opposites Attract\" video where it was implied that she was sleeping with him-- he being an animated cat.  It wasn't the only time MC Skat Kat tried to break into the big time though; in 1991, a debut album was released but failed to make a dent in the charts.  Paula Abdul, meanwhile, made bank off \"Opposites Attract\", taking home a Grammy win for her music video. \n"}, {"text": "Dealing with foods that were 'dangerously cheesy', what type of cool cat became the mascot of a Frito Lays snack?", "correct": "Cheetah", "options": ["Puma", "Lion", "Tiger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheetah.\n\n\tChester Cheetah was made the mascot of the Cheetos line in the 1997s, begin depicted as a speedy, but suave, bipedal cat who count charm his way to the snack food when he craved it most.  Chester started appearing on the product line soon after, but hit snags during his earlier days when Frito Lays attempted to put him in his own FOX TV show-- \"Yo! It's the Chester Cheetah Show!\"-- in a clear attempt at flagrant product placement.  Over time, Chester was rebranded further, aging with his target demographic, to become 'Papa Chester', though he was still always a cool cheetah. \n"}, {"text": "Although he wasn't always so sporty, what cartoon mascot would proclaim that Frosted Flakes (or Frosties) were \"grrrrreat\"?", "correct": "Tony", "options": ["Sam", "Captain", "Lucky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTony.\n\n\tTony the Tiger debuted in the advertising world in the early 1950s, soon appearing in marketing materials and on boxes for Kellogg's cereal, being rendered as an animated feline by former Disney animators.  Tony persisted through decades of appearances before reinvention in the 1970s, becoming your typical Italian-American family man (actually) and eventually spawning Tony Jr., the tiger cub who would eventually take up his father's mantle, but bringing a hip, new, athletic bulk to the role. Tony Jr. (eventually just 'Tony the Tiger') would later push the cereal to as a choice for athletes.  You know... even though they're just sugar-coated bran flakes. \n"}, {"text": "Lord Tubbington appeared as a character in what singing-and-dancing-themed TV show?", "correct": "Glee", "options": ["Galavant", "Smash", "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlee.\n\n\tIn \"Glee\", fan-favourite Lord Tubbington appeared in ten episodes beginning in season two as Brittany's pet cat.  While Lord Tubbington may have been a fixture of many of Brittany's confusing, absurd anecdotes, he was, by and large (quite large, actually), a real cat, so he wasn't involved in the elaborate songs and dances featured in the show's six years.  Nonetheless, Tubbington often appeared on Brittany's web show, 'Fondue For Two', despite the rumours that he had an ecstasy addiction. \n"}, {"text": "Underground animated cat Fritz gained notoriety in the early 1970s for starring in a film that was granted which rating in the United States, becoming the first animated film to do so?", "correct": "X", "options": ["R", "G", "PG-13"], "explanation": "\n\n\nX.\n\n\tOriginally a comic strip by Robert Crumb released in the 1960s, \"Fritz the Cat\" turned out to be a bit more infamous over time, appearing in a unique movie featuring lewd sexual acts between felines of all shorts.  A satire of the time, the movie ended up becoming the first animated film to receive the X-rating in the United States, banning its viewing for minors due to its content.  Unsurprisingly, the film took off after that, grossing $90,000,000 worldwide when all was said and done.  It ended up being well-received by critics at the time despite this, inevitably winding up at Cannes. \n"}, {"text": "Though she wasn't really hip in her time, which of these \"Bojack Horseman\" characters is a cat who began working in Los Angeles the 1990s?", "correct": "Princess Carolyn", "options": ["Diane Nguyen", "Sarah Lynn", "Sextina Aquafina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincess Carolyn.\n\n\tVoiced by Amy Sedaris, Princess Carolyn is a fixture in Bojack's life because, as his agent, she fuels many of the different ventures he takes in the entertainment industry, often helping him out despite his self-destructive tendencies.  Unlucky in love and constantly working to maintain her agency, Carolyn often faces depressing circumstances all on her own, and frequently head-to-head against rival Hollywoo talent agent Vanessa Gekko (played by Kristin Chenoweth), who's actually a human and not a bipedal gecko. \n"}]}
