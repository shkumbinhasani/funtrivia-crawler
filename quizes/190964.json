{"id": "190964", "name": "The Film History of Laurence Olivier Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed L-R", " Laurence Olivier"], "questions": [{"text": "Fans of Olivier are quite familiar with his love for Shakespeare's works.  It's only fitting, then, that my first question asks, 'What was the first film, adapted from a Shakepeare play, in which Olivier took part?'", "correct": "As You Like It", "options": ["Othello", "King Lear", "Richard III"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs You Like It.\n\n\tOlivier's first film based on Shakespeare was 'As You Like It' in 1936.  He played the role of Orlando in the film, which was directed by Paul Czinner.  Olivier would go on to participate in films based on: 'Henry V', 'Hamlet', 'Richard III', 'Othello', 'Romeo and Juliet' (narrator), 'The Merchant of Venice' and 'King Lear'.  If only he had done 'Julius Caesar'! \n"}, {"text": "Olivier's first Oscar nomination came for his performance in the 1939 film 'Wuthering Heights'.  In this film, what is the name of the character Olivier portrays?", "correct": "Heathcliff", "options": ["Edgar", "Hindley", "Earnshaw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeathcliff.\n\n\tBased on the novel by Emily Bront\u00eb, 'Wuthering Heights' is a classic romantic drama, perfect for Olivier to make his big splash in American film.  Directed by William Wyler, Olivier makes his presence known alongside Merle Oberon (as Catherine) and David Niven.  Despite this first nomination, Olivier failed to bring home the Oscar that year. \n"}, {"text": "The 1940 film 'Rebecca' marked Laurence Olivier's only joint venture with the great British film director Alfred Hitchcock.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIt comes as a surprise to me that these two film giants from the UK only worked together this single time.  Olivier plays the part of George Fortescu Maximillian 'Maxim' de Winter alongside his female lead Joan Fontaine (whose character is nameless).  Perhaps it was Olivier's disappointment that Hitchcock didn't select his wife, Vivien Leigh, as the female lead that led to the two of them never working together again. Apparently, Olivier was quite cruel to the lovely young Fontaine on the set.  Incidentally, 'Rebecca' was the only Hitchcock picture ever to win an Oscar, so the chemistry between Hitchcock and Olivier could not have been all that bad. \n"}, {"text": "In 1944, Olivier took a great chance by directing, producing and acting in a film adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Henry V'.  Is it true that Sir Laurence did not play the title role in the film?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNaturally, since the entire production was his, Olivier was practically compelled to play the title role of King Henry V.  The full title of the film (and play) is 'The Chronicle History Or King Henry the Fifth with His Battell Fought at Agincourt in France', thank goodness for abbreviated titles!  \r For his work on this film, Olivier was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar.  He received an honorary Oscar for 'outstanding achievement as actor, producer and director in bringing Henry V to the screen'. \n"}, {"text": "Not satisfied merely with 'Henry V', Olivier charged headlong into 'Hamlet', completing the film adaptation in 1948.  Olivier won an Oscar for his acting work, becoming the first and only actor to have directed himself to an acting Oscar in the 20th century.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOlivier was the first, but not the only director to have managed a self-directed Best Actor Oscar.  Roberto Benigni achieved this rare feat in 1997 with the film 'La Vita \u00e8 bella' (Life is Beautiful).  \r Olivier also took home the Oscar for Best Picture in 1949, but failed to win the coveted Best Director Oscar. \n"}, {"text": "In 1960, Olivier once again paired up with one of the great all-time directors, this time Stanley Kubrick.  The film, 'Spartacus', featured Kirk Douglas in the title role, and Olivier as which Roman patrician?", "correct": "Crassus", "options": ["Pompey", "Caesar", "Octavian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrassus.\n\n\tOlivier's performance as the august Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus works well alongside the performances of Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov and Tony Curtis as Crassus' disloyal servant Antoninus.  One Roman bath scene between the controlled Crassus and the youthful Antoninus was clearly meant to exhibit a low level of homoeroticism. \n"}, {"text": "Moving into the decade of the 1970s, we find Olivier still going strong.  In particular, one early 70s performance stands out.  In which film does Olivier play Andrew Wyke, opposite Michael Caine's Milo Tindle, the two of them serving as the entire cast?", "correct": "Sleuth", "options": ["The Rehearsal", "The Dance of Death", "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSleuth.\n\n\tThe 1972 film Sleuth marked an interesting milestone.  The entire credited cast, consisting of Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, was nominated for Academy Awards.  The only other films (as of 2004) that can make such a boast are the 1966 film 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' (4-person cast) and the 1975 film 'Give 'em Hell, Harry!' (1-person cast).\r You will notice that when you watch the film 'Sleuth', a murder mystery involving two men in a game of one-upmanship, there are other names in the credits.  Pay no attention to them...they are fictitious names! \n"}, {"text": "Moving along now we reach 1976 and the film 'Marathon Man'.  This film features Olivier as Dr. Christian Szell, a Nazi war criminal nicknamed 'The White Angel'.  Directed by John Schlesinger and based on the novel by William Goldman, this film also features a fine performance from which of these actors?", "correct": "Dustin Hoffman", "options": ["Robert De Niro", "Steve McQueen", "Jack Nicholson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDustin Hoffman.\n\n\tBoth Olivier and Hoffman are magnificent in this film that is painful to watch, especially the dental drilling scenes!  Olivier garnered another well-deserved Oscar nomination for his performance here, the ninth and second-to-last acting Oscar nomination of his career.  He failed to take home the supporting actor award, though not for lack of talent.  He was beaten out by Jason Robards for his performance in 'All the President's men'. \n"}, {"text": "Laurence Olivier's final Oscar nomination came for his performance in the 1978 picture 'The Boys from Brazil', the story of a pair of Nazi hunters, one young, one old.  The film was based on a novel by which of these authors?", "correct": "Ira Levin", "options": ["Chaim Potok", "Elie Wiesel", "Saul Bellow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIra Levin.\n\n\tThis was Olivier's Oscar swan song.  His work in 'The Boys from Brazil' garned him a record tenth acting award nomination from the Academy, but he again did not bring home the Oscar.  He did, however, accept an honorary Oscar 'for the full body of his work, for the unique achievements of his entire career and his lifetime of contribution to the art of film.'  \r Alongside Olivier in 'The Boys from Brazil' appeared James Mason, Gregory Peck, Uta Hagen, Denholm Elliot and a very young Steve Guttenberg. \n"}, {"text": "Laurence Olivier continued to work throughout the entire decade of the 1980s despite his advancing age.  One of his roles earlier in the decade was as which Greek god in the exciting fantasy/adventure 'Clash of the Titans'? ", "correct": "Zeus", "options": ["Apollo", "Poseidon", "Hephaestus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZeus.\n\n\tHonestly, would you have expected Lord Olivier to take any other role save for that of king of the gods?  Olivier's performance in 'Clash of the Titans' was typically flawless, though the film appears rather dated thanks to its rather primitive special effects.  Nonetheless, the film can be entertaining, especially for young kids.  \r Olivier's career spanned eight more years, and fourteen more acting performances until his death in 1989.  His final film was 1989's 'War Requiem'.\r Thank you for trying this quiz.  I hope you enjoyed it, learned a thing or two, and will be back to try some of my other quizzes. \n"}]}
