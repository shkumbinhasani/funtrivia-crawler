{"id": "108994", "name": "Ultimate LOTR: Fellowship, Part 2 Online Quiz | Literature | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "J. R. R. Tolkien", "The Fellowship of the Ring"], "questions": [{"text": "When we left off from the first quiz of this series, Frodo and company were honored guests in the house of Tom Bombadil.  The morning after their sleepover in Tom's house in the woods, they make off once again on their trek.  From the woods they emerge into the Barrow-Downs, on their way to Bree.  Unfortunately, the travelers once again are sidetracked, this time by weather and a Barrow-wight!  What strange weather occurrence befalls the hobbits just prior to their being accosted by the Barrow-wight?", "correct": "Fog", "options": ["Thunderstorm", "Tornado", "Snowstorm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFog.\n\n\tThe Barrow Downs seem innocent enough, but Frodo and friends know that danger lurks in the guise of Barrow-wights (a human-like embodiment of evil or tortured spirits)  The ominous fog rolls through the downs while the hobbits are napping, and soon after they wake they are trapped by a wight!  Very fortunately, Tom Bombadil comes again to their rescue and they are freed!  Not only do they once again gain their freedom, but also acquire some useful weapons in the process. \n"}, {"text": "Off to Bree-land they go, and in particular to the inn called the Prancing Pony in the village called Bree.  When they reach the inn, Frodo employs the disguise name 'Mr. Underhill' to request a room for the evening.  The innkeeper, Mr. Butterbur, gladly helps the four hobbits to their quarters.  Are the people of Bree used to hobbit-folk?  \n", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIt seems that Bree is a cosmopolitan place, so far as Middle Earth goes.  Hobbits and men intermingle there with the occasional dwarves and elves, no surprise considering that Bree sits at two great crossroads in the land of Eriador.  Hence, when Mr. Butterbur sees our little company of hobbits, he is immediately pleased to give them assistance! \n"}, {"text": "Frodo first meets Strider in the Prancing Pony, while the hobbits enjoy drink and song.  Strider warns Frodo to keep his friends, especially the loose-lipped Pippin, to keep quiet about the quest.  When Frodo feels threatened that his friends might begin talking about the ring, he decides to hop on a table and sing a funny tune.  To which modern nursery-rhyme does this tune relate?  \n", "correct": "Hey Diddle, Diddle", "options": ["Old Mother Hubbard", "Jack and Jill", "Little Boy Blue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHey Diddle, Diddle.\n\n\tWithin Frodo's song are references to the 'cat on the fiddle' and the 'cow jumping over the moon', not to mention the words 'hey-diddle-diddle'.  I think Tolkien may have meant perhaps to suggest that this was the origin of the traditional nursery rhyme, direct from Middle Earth!  It is very fortunate that they meet Strider (aka Aragorn) at this time, for Gandalf is nowhere to be found and they still face a difficult road on their way to Rivendell. \n"}, {"text": "Now retired to a parlour room in the Prancing Pony, the hobbits (sans Merry who has stepped out) converse with Strider.  The two sides gauge the other, trying to determine their level of trust.  Mr. Butterbur helps to seal the new friendship by delivering a letter from Gandalf that he was supposed to have sent to Frodo months before.  In a poem in Gandalf's letter, contained within the second postscript, Aragorn is described.  Which of these stanzas does Strider repeat, revealing himself as Aragorn?  \n", "correct": "All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost", "options": ["From the ashes a fire shall be woken, a light from the shadows shall spring", "The old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost", "Renewed shall be blade that was broken, the crownless again shall be king"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.\n\n\tApparently, Bilbo claimed authorship of the poem in question. According to the third postscript, Gandalf threatened to 'roast' Butterbur if he forgot to promptly deliver this important note to Frodo...set the coals afire! \n"}, {"text": "With Strider now leading the trek, the hobbits leave Bree the following morning, black riders nipping at their heels.  Because their steeds had been loosed in the night, the group is forced to purchase the only available horse in town, a 'half-starved creature' according to the narrative.  From whom do they make purchase of this poor horse?  \n", "correct": "Bill Ferny", "options": ["The Southerner", "Fatty Bolger", "Mr. Butterbur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBill Ferny.\n\n\tBill Ferny is an untrustworthy fellow who has obviously abused his poor old horse, who Sam lovingly nicknames 'Bill'.  Ferny also probably has served as a spy for the black riders, helping to reveal the location of our friends the night before.  Luckily, Strider had moved the hobbits earlier in the evening, and no harm was done to them.  With old Bill they set out on the road to Rivendell early the following day, but not before Sam hits Bill Ferny square in the nose with what he terms as a 'wasted apple'! \n"}, {"text": "Through the woods our sojourners travel first, after setting forth from Bree.  The woods prove of little difficulty for them this time round, largely because of Strider's Ranger skill.  However, none of them persevere well through the midgewater swamp which takes them more than a day to traverse.  Finally, they see their temporary destination, the conical hill known as 'Weathertop'.  By what name is the watch-tower atop this hill known?  \n", "correct": "Amon Sul", "options": ["Calimenthal", "Gil-galad", "Barad-dur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmon Sul.\n\n\tThe history of this watch-tower is as ancient as the weather-worn rocks appear to bear out.  According to Aragorn, it was atop this hill that Elendil, the King of men, and Gil-galad, the Elven-king, came together to form the 'last alliance' against Sauron.  Neither would ever return. \n"}, {"text": "Yes or no: Strider recommends that a fire be built and used as part of their defense while dwelling near Weathertop.  \n", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAccording to Strider, 'fire is our friend in the wilderness'.  Since the black riders cannot 'see' per se, the relative danger of building a fire and releasing smoke is diminished by the fact that they can wield the fire as a weapon against their enemies.  Indeed, after the black riders have approached, Strider appears with two burning sticks and drives them back, but only after the damage has been done.  The evil blade of one of the riders pierces Frodo's left shoulder and he is stricken by the wound. \n"}, {"text": "How many of the black riders confront Frodo and friends while they are spending the night on Weathertop?  \n", "correct": "Five", "options": ["Only one", "All nine", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFive.\n\n\tAccording to the book, of these five, three actually approach our friends while two stand atop the hill.  With the ring on, Frodo sees the black shadows as white figures with 'merciless eyes'.  The tallest of the figures wears a crown, apparently the king of these ring wraiths! \n"}, {"text": "With Frodo now unable to walk by himself, speed becomes of the essence; they must get him to Rivendell quickly so Elrond may use Elvish medicine to counter the evil infection of the black rider's blade.  The last bridge they must cross before reaching Rivendell is suitably called the 'Last Bridge'.  What token does Strider find on the bridge suggesting that it is safe to cross?  \n", "correct": "An elf-stone", "options": ["An Elven brooch", "Gandalf's carved initial", "Gandalf's footprints"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn elf-stone.\n\n\tUpon the bridge, buried in the mud, Strider finds a beryl stone.  He takes this as a sign that the elves have been there before our little troupe and have 'cleared' the way of black riders.  They may now pass the river Greyflood, which is also called Hoarwell and Mitheithel (everything and everyone has about 10 names in these books!) \n"}, {"text": "Crossing the bridge in safety, Strider decides once again to veer off the beaten track.  What very unusual site do they come upon while traveling off the main road between the Last Bridge and Rivendell?  \n", "correct": "Three stone trolls from 'The Hobbit'", "options": ["The remains of Smaug the Dragon", "The Lonely Mountain", "The gathering place of the Ents"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree stone trolls from 'The Hobbit'.\n\n\tIn a fun reference to 'The Hobbit', Tolkien has the travelers pass right through the resting place of the three trolls, turned to stone by the sun many years before while arguing about whether to boil or roast Bilbo Baggins.  Even stalwart Strider jests about the trolls, and breaks a stick over one of them to 'prove' they are not still breathing.  As they walk along they also discover the spot where Bilbo unearthed the troll's hidden treasure, causing some speculation amongst them about how much Bilbo was able to take back to the Shire... always gossiping, those hobbits! \n"}, {"text": "Thanks to Glorfindel the elf and his white horse, Frodo outpaces the black riders and makes it to Rivendell, witnessing the flooding of the river and the passing of the ring wraiths (for the time being).  Following the deadly flood of the river that sweeps away the black riders his next sensory impression is of the House of Elrond and Gandalf's voice.  On what date does the reunion of Gandalf and Frodo take place?  \n", "correct": "October 24th", "options": ["November 5th", "September 17th", "December 14th"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOctober 24th.\n\n\tFrodo is very relieved to see his friend Gandalf once again, though Gandalf begins by mildly scolding him for the 'absurd things' he has done since their last parting.  Frodo has been unconscious for nearly four days, but he is eager about learning of Gandalf's experiences of late...he begs to know of Gandalf's story! \n"}, {"text": "In the House of Elrond, Frodo has the pleasure of encountering several important folk for the first time.  One of these individuals is Arwen Und\u00f3miel, who is said to appear much like which princess of Elven past?  \n", "correct": "Luthien", "options": ["Mauh\u00far", "Elbereth", "Loni"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuthien.\n\n\tL\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel is mentioned several times, an Elven-princess of the distant past.  Arwen looks so much like her that Aragorn is fooled into believing her to be the 'nightingale'.  Arwen is called Und\u00f3miel, which means 'Evenstar', and is an above average beauty...to say the least.  Her father is Elrond, and her mother, Celebr\u00edan of L\u00f3thlorien.  Unlike in the film, Arwen speaks no words in the first book...but her appearance does not go unnoticed by the reader, by Frodo, or by Aragorn! \n"}, {"text": "At the feast held that evening in honor of the many illustrious guests of Elrond, which of the dwarves from Thorin's company in 'The Hobbit' has a seat by Frodo?  \n", "correct": "Gloin", "options": ["Balin", "Dwalin", "Bifur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGloin.\n\n\tGl\u00f3in is polite and garrulous, and is more than happy to relate stories of past adventures and current troubles.  Gl\u00f3in is also the father of Gimli, one of the Fellowship who will accompany Frodo on his future quest! \n"}, {"text": "Strider goes by many names.  After Frodo meets Bilbo at Rivendell, Bilbo and he chat about many things.  By what does Bilbo refer to Strider, when the topic comes up?  \n", "correct": "Dunadan", "options": ["Simiral", "Hador", "Mithrandir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDunadan.\n\n\tThe term D\u00fanadan literally means 'Man of the West' and the plural for the term is D\u00fanedain, referring to the men of N\u00famenor...of which Aragorn is one. \n"}, {"text": "The day after the wonderful entertainment and happy meetings at Rivendell, the Council of Elrond begins and the fate of the ring is discussed.  We are introduced to Gimli, Legolas, and Boromir at this meeting.  Of these individuals it is Boromir who seems most fascinated by the legacies of Isildur and Elendil, the ring and the broken sword respectively.  What is this broken sword, which Aragorn inherits, called?  ", "correct": "Narsil", "options": ["Glamdring", "Orthanc", "Orcrist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNarsil.\n\n\tThe shards of Narsil were kept by Aragorn, and it is finally restored to Aragorn as And\u00faril (Flame of the West) in Rivendell.  Boromir is much in awe of this sword, and even more so about 'Isildur's Bane', the one ring of Sauron.  Please stay tuned for the next (third) quiz in this series, continuing my survey of the Lord of the Rings trilogy...and thanks for playing! \n"}]}
