Which of these four alternatives is NOT one of the moons seen by Galileo at this time?", "correct": "Amalthea", "options": ["Io", "Ganymede", "Europa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmalthea.\n\n\tJupiter is now known to have at least 67 moons. Remarkably, though, 50 of these have been discovered since 2000. Galileo's discovery of Ganymede, Io, Europa and Callisto is made all the more remarkable by the fact that for almost three centuries (until the discovery of Amalthea by American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard in 1892), the Galilean moons were believed to be the only satellites of our largest neighbour. \r Ganymede is the largest of all the moons in the solar system, and the only one known to have its own magnetic field. It is 8% larger than the planet Mercury (but only 2% larger than Titan, Saturn's largest moon). The largest object in the solar system without a significant atmosphere, Ganymede orbits Jupiter approximately every seven Earth days. Although Galileo is credited with the discovery of Ganymede, there are records showing that Chinese astronomer/astrologer Gan De detected what seemed to be a moon of Jupiter with the naked eye in 356 BC. \r Amalthea (also sometimes called 'Jupiter V') was discovered in 1892 and named after a a nymph in Greek mythology. Considering how many other moons have since been found orbiting Jupiter, Barbard's discovery was also quite remarkable since Amalthea is only the third of the 67 moons (in terms of distance from the planet), and orbits within the outer limits of the dust cloud ejected from the planet's surface. \r Later in the decade: Dec 28,1612, Galileo becomes the first to see Neptune as its orbit intersected with Jupiter, but he identified it as a star because of its slow movement and it would be a further 234 before it is officially discovered. dec 15,1612, Simon Marius, is the first person to observe the Andromeda Galaxy. \n"}, {"text": "June, 1611: Having wintered ashore, when the ice cleared the captain of the ship wanted to press on westwards on his voyage of discovery. However, most of the crew wanted to return home, so they mutinied and cast the captain, his teenage son and seven crew members adrift in a small open boat, never to be seen again. Who was this captain?", "correct": "Sir Henry Hudson", "options": ["Abel Tasman", "Dirk Hartog", "William Bligh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSir Henry Hudson.\n\n\tBorn in England between 1565 and 1570, Henry Hudson began life as a cabin boy and worked his way up to ship's captain. He made two major voyages with the objective of discovering the Northwest Passage, a route to China between Canada and the Arctic. Hudson departed England aboard \"Discovery\" for the second of these voyages in early 1610 and passed south of Greenland on June 4. After exploring what is now called Hudson Strait (at the northern tip of Labrador), they entered Hudson Bay. So vast was this huge inland sea that they thought they had found the mythical Northwest Passage and spent months mapping the coastline before becoming trapped in ice in November. When the ice cleared in the spring of 1611, Hudson wanted to continue exploring westwards. Most of the crew, though, did not. The mutineers provided Hudson, his son and those crew members loyal to Hudson with provisions and left them in a small shallop. Hudson and the crew rowed after the Discovery but, when the mutineers unfurled their sails, those in the small row boat were left behind. They were never seen again and their fate is unknown. \r William Bligh was famously abandoned by the mutinous crew of his ship, HMS Bounty, but that event occurred significantly later, in 1789. \n"}, {"text": "April 11, 1612: Edward Wightman is executed by burning at the stake in Lichfield in Staffordshire. He is the last person to be executed in England for which offence?", "correct": "Heresy", "options": ["High Treason", "Witchcraft", "Regicide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeresy.\n\n\tBorn sometime before 1580, probably in Leicestershire, Edward Wightman became a minister of the local Anabaptists Church in the 1590s. This movement, which dates back to the Radical Reformation of the mid-16th century, primarily believed in delaying baptism until adulthood and modern-day groups such as the Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites are direct descendants. \r In 1596, Wightman was involved in the investigation of demonic possession of 13-year-old boy. As a result of this experience, he began to preach the Martin Luther theory that the soul sleeps with the body until Judgement Day, rather than advancing to either Heaven or Hell when the body dies. Added to this was Wightman's stated beliefs that \"the baptizing of infants is an abomination\", and that \"Jesus Christ was a mere man\". \r After being arrested on charges of heresy, Wightman outlined all of his beliefs into a compendium with which he planned to plead his case at trial. He even delivered a copy of his proposed defence to King James I. Since ascending to the English throne in 1603, and the subsequent Gunpowder Plot of the following year, James I had initiated a series of harsh measures to control all forms of non-conformism. Needless to say, he was less than sympathetic to Wightman's point of view, and quickly ordered him burned at the stake. \r Although Wightman was the last person ever to be executed in England for heresy, witchcraft trials were still in full swing. In the same year, four women and one man were hanged on July 22, 1612 following the Northamptonshire witch trials in Northampton, and on August 20 the ten so-called \"Pendle witches\" were hanged for practising witchcraft in Lancashire. Indeed, it would be more than another century before Janet Horne, the last British person to be executed for sorcery, was burned to death in Scotland in 1727. \n"}, {"text": "February 7, 1613: The beginning of the reign of Michael I ended what has become known as the \"Time of Troubles\", a period of famine and civil uprising following the death of the last member of the Rurik Dynasty in 1598. Michael I was the first monarch from which dynasty?", "correct": "Romanov", "options": ["Qing", "Bourbon", "Habsburg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRomanov.\n\n\tBorn in Moscow in 1596, at the age of just 16 Mikhail Fyodorovich Romanov became Tsar Micahel I, the first monarch of the Romanov dynasty. A nephew of the last Rurik Tsar, Feodor I, through both his aunt (his paternal grandfather's sister, Anastasia Romanovna) and by marriage with Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible), Michael was elected by the 1613 'zemskiy sobor' (the first Russian feudal parliament).\r Exiled as a child by the de facto regent Boris Godunov, the story of Michael's election and ascension to the throne were dramatized in Mikhail Glinka's 1836 opera \"A Life for the Tsar\". The Romanov dynasty (only the second to rule a unified Russia) remained in power for slightly over three centuries, until the abdication (and subsequent assassination) of Nicholas II in 1917. \n"}, {"text": "April 7, 1614: After a short illness at the age of 72, one of the great painters, sculptors and architects of the Spanish Renaissance died in Toledo, where he had lived and worked for 37 years. Known for his tortuously elongated figures, he was disdained by generations of artists that followed him, but he was hugely influential on the likes of Picasso, Cezanne and Manet, who lived three centuries after him. Who is this artist?\n", "correct": "El Greco", "options": ["Luis de Morales", "Francisco Goya", "Diego Vel\u00e1zquez"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEl Greco.\n\n\tHe was born Dom\u00e9nikos Theotok\u00f3poulos in 1541 in the city of Heraklion, capital of the Greek island of Crete. After moving first to Venice then Rome, he arrived in Toledo in central Spain in 1577. Although he signed most of his paintings with his birth name, he was and is widely known simply as The Greek, 'El Greco'.\r Amongst El Greco's most famous works are 'El Entierro del Conde de Orgaz' (\"The Burial of the Count of Orgaz\"), which remains today in 'Iglesia de Santo Tom\u00e9', a church in Toledo, the \"Laoco\u00f6n\", which is part of the collection at the National Gallery in Washington DC, USA, and 'El caballero de la mano en el pecho' (\"The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest\", a portrait that hangs in The Prado Museum in Madrid. \r Of the alternatives, Luis de Morales was another great artist of the Spanish Renaissance, but he died much earlier, in 1586; Diego Vel\u00e1zquez lived and worked in the 17th century, but later -- he was born in 1599 and died in 1660; and Francisco Goya (1746-1828) was much later. \\ \n"}, {"text": "1615: The second and final part of a canonical novel is published ten years after the first part. Widely considered to be one of the founding works of modern Western literature, it still today features prominently in lists of the greatest works of fiction ever written. Which novel is this?", "correct": "Don Quixote (Miguel de Cervantes)", "options": ["Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship (J.W.von Goethe)", "Tristram Shandy (Laurence Sterne)", "The Canterbury Tales (Geoffrey Chaucer)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon Quixote (Miguel de Cervantes).\n\n\tPart One of Miguel de Cervantes' epic story about the adventures of a Hidalgo named Alonso Quixano, \"Don Quixote\" (fully titled \"The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha\") was published in Spanish in 1605 (and in English in 1612). The second and final part of the most influential literary work of the \"Spanish Golden Age\" was published a decade later (translated into English in 1620).\r Early in the text, Cervantes claims that the story has been \"translated from Arabic by the Moorish author Cide Hamete Benengeli\", thus giving the impression that Quixote was a real person and that the story was relating real historical events. \r Of the alternatives: Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" was written in the 1380s and became one of the first books published in English (by William Caxton) some 75 years after the author's death in 1400; Laurence sterne's humorous novel \"Tristram Shandy\" (or, to give it its full title, \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" was published in nine parts between 1759 and 1767; von Goethe's classic second novel, \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\", was published in 1795-96. \n"}, {"text": "April 23, 1616: The world lost three of the greatest writers of their generation (many would say of all generations) all on the same day. One was the writer of the most important novel ever written in his language, one was the first writer born in the Americas to enter the Western canon, and one was a pre-eminent dramatist. Who did NOT die on this day?", "correct": "Christopher Marlowe", "options": ["William Shakespeare", "Garcilaso de la Vega", "Miguel de Cervantes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristopher Marlowe.\n\n\tBorn in Canterbury in Kent, England in 1564 (two months before Shakespeare), Christopher Marlowe was widely considered the greatest Elizabethan tragedian of his day. At the age of just 29, in May 1593, Marlowe was stabbed in the eye, killing him immediately. Some have claimed he was involved in a drunken brawl, others that he was stabbed by a rival (Marlowe was a known homosexual), and others that his death occurred during a fight over the payment of a bill. What is certain is that Marlowe's influence on the still-young William Shakespeare was significant and that it was only after Marlowe's death that Shakespeare began to gain recognition as the most important dramatist of the era. (Believe it or not, conspiracy theories existed even 400 years ago -- it has been claimed in some quarters that Marlowe faked his death and continued to write under the name William Shakespeare, and that Shakespeare himself never existed. A comedy of errors indeed!)\r Born G\u00f3mez Su\u00e1rez de Figueroa in 1539 in the city of Cusco, then in the Dpanish Viceroy and now in southern Peru, he is known 'El Inca' or Inca Garcilaso de la Vega. The son of a Spanish conquistador, he travelled to Spain when he was 19 and spent the rest of his life there. His works explored Incan history, culture and society, including the effects of the Spanish arrival on that society. Well-respected, he is acknowledged as the first American-born writer to have a significant influence on Western literature.\r Of course, the lives and works of both Miguel Cervantes and William Shakespeare are well documented. Goliaths of their own time, their works still resonate today, and both are widely recognized as amongst the most important of all Western writers to have lived. it is perhaps fitting that both died on the same day, Cervantes aged 68 and Shakespeare on his 52nd birthday. \n"}, {"text": "April 4, 1617: mathematician, physicist and astronomer, John Napier of Merchiston died from the effects of gout aged 67 on this date. The bane of many a schoolchild since, Napier not only invented logarithms, but also popularized the use of the decimal point in arithmetic and mathematics. What nationality was Napier?", "correct": "Scottish", "options": ["Irish", "Welsh", "English"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScottish.\n\n\tBorn in Merchiston Tower in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1550, John Napier was to become the 8th Laird of Merchiston. The tower where he was born (built sometime around 1454 by Alexander Napier, the 2nd Laird of Merchiston) is now part of the facilities at the higher education establishment named for him, Edinburgh Napier University. A statue of Napier stands in the grounds of the university's Craighouse Campus. The Neper crater on the Moon is named for him.\r Napier's greats mathematical work, \"Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio\" published in 1614, contains 90 pages of tables of numbers and 57 pages of explanatory notes. \n"}, {"text": "May 23, 1618: The 1555 Peace of Augsburg ended the on-going conflict between German Lutherans and Catholics.

What developed, though, was a continuation of the struggle for European dominance between France and the Hapsburg dynasty, with both sides employing large mercenary armies from across the continent. Sweden, Denmark, England, Scotland, the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Tsardom sided with France and the United Provinces, whilst Croatia, Hungary, the Spanish Empire, Austria and Poland fought with the armies representing the Holy Roman Empire. \r The war finally ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia. A weakened Spain saw both Portugal and the Dutch Republic declaring independence. Many German states, where the majority of the war was actually fought, were decimated. England and Sweden both significantly increased their power and influence in Europe. Many of the national boundaries we would recognize today were established and the power of many sovereign nation states was established. \r Of the alternatives: the German Peasants' War lasted only from 1524-25; the Second War of Kappel was a 1531 conflict between the Protestant and Catholic cantons in Switzerland; and the Eighty Years' War lasted from 1568 until 1748 and is also known as the Dutch War of Independence . \n"}, {"text": "March 2, 1619: The Queen consort of England, Anne of Denmark, died at the age of 44 in Hampton Court Palace on this date.
