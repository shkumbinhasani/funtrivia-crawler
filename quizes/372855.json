Unfortunately, as Gloria puts it, hindsight is 20/20.  She presents him with prophylactics and Dandy states that he would never violate Bette and Dot.

To prove these things to her, she demands that someone strap into the bullseye, so Paul steps forward.  When the wheel is given a spin, Elsa takes three throws with her knife and, on the third, hits him in the stomach.  No one sees as she seems to grin at the shot.
