First was Rome and second was Alexandria. \n"}, {"text": "Whom does chapter 3 mention as being righteous?", "correct": "Abraham", "options": ["Moses", "Noah", "David"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbraham.\n\n\tIt says in Galatians 3:6, \"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.\"\r Righteousness comes from the Hebrew word \"tsadiq\" translated into the Greek word \"dikaiosune\". \n"}, {"text": "What shall \"the just\" live by, according to Galatians?", "correct": "faith", "options": ["the river", "bread alone", "love"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfaith.\n\n\tIt says in Galatians 3:11, \"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.\"\r Faith is a very important concept in the Bible and is mentioned in some form over 500 times. \n"}, {"text": "What does Paul say \"we ... are the children of\" in chapter 4?", "correct": "Promise", "options": ["Corn", "God", "Eden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPromise.\n\n\tIt says in Galatians 4:28 \"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.\"\r Christians believe that this promise refers to the fact that though we are not necessarily the natural seed of Abraham, we are still entitled to the promised inheritance and interested in the blessings of it. \n"}, {"text": "According to Galatians 5:16, what should people walk in?", "correct": "the Spirit", "options": ["the house", "the rain", "the Taj Mahal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe Spirit.\n\n\tIt says in Galatians 5:16, \"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.\"\r This goes along with another verse in the Bible.  It says in I Corinthians 10:13, \"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.\"\r The verse says that God will not allow people to be tempted past what we can handle, and in Galatians it says to walk in the Spirit because it is the Holy Spirit which helps resist this temptation. This is what many Christians believe. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is one of the fruits of the Spirit specifically mentioned in Galatians (as they are listed in the King James Version)?", "correct": "longsuffering", "options": ["happiness", "charm", "compassion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nlongsuffering.\n\n\tIt says in Galatians 5:22-23 \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.\"\r This is contrary to earlier verses, where the Bible mentions all the things that are sins. \n"}, {"text": "What does Galatians 6:2 say believers are to do in order to fulfill the law of Christ?", "correct": "bear one another's burdens", "options": ["eat only clean animals", "become a missionary", "watch \"Sesame Street\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nbear one another's burdens.\n\n\tIt says in Galatians 6:2, \"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.\"\r That is, if people care about others and love them as Christ loves, they are not going to kill, lie, steal, etc. On the contrary, they will be patient, kind, gentle, etc. \n"}, {"text": "What does a man reap?", "correct": "whatsoever a man soweth", "options": ["whatsoever a man findeth", "whatsoever a man buyeth", "whatsoever a man pilfereth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwhatsoever a man soweth.\n\n\tIt says in Galatians 6:7 \"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\"\r The Bible uses a lot of farm analogies.  This one shows that when a farmer plants corn, for example, he would get corn, not carrots. \n"}]}
