{"id": "245701", "name": "Hardest 'M*A*S*H' - 'L.I.P.' Trivia Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "The M*A*S*H-ites have just completed watching a rousing western, and almost everyone has someone to cuddle.  Hawkeye's latest conquest attempt is with Lt. Regina Hoffman, a lovely brunette.  After their movie date, does Hawkeye get a kiss from Lt. Hoffman?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIndeed, not.  Rather, his only reward is a firm handshake and a promise of more to come.  Regina Hoffman is played by actress Corinne Camacho.\r Incidentally, one of the more amusing bits in the opening scene happens when the camera pans to Radar who lovingly caresses a chicken leg while a fawning Nurse Kellye stares blankly at him. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye is accosted by a certain Corporal named Phil Walker.  It seems that Corporal Walker has found himself a little family in Korea, complete with soon-to-be-wife and child.  What is the name of the Korean woman with whom Walker has fallen in love?", "correct": "Kim", "options": ["Su", "Soon-Yi", "Min Jun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKim.\n\n\tWalker and Kim have had themselves a child, and the poor little tot is suffering from colic.  Hawkeye treats the baby, and then is confronted with another request from Walker...facilitating his marriage to Kim.  It's a tall order, but how can Hawkeye resist? \n"}, {"text": "The following night, Hawkeye enjoys another romantic interlude with Lt. Hoffman.  He teaches her to dance in '3 easy' steps.  Who else did Hawkeye claim to have instructed in the art of dance?", "correct": "Sarah Bernhardt", "options": ["Martha Graham", "Isadora Duncan", "Anna Pavlova"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSarah Bernhardt.\n\n\t'I taught Sarah Bernhardt how to dance.  She had a wooden leg.  I had to charge her extra.', or so claims Hawkeye.  He doesn't so much teach Lt. Hoffman how to dance, but rather teaches her how to kiss him! \n"}, {"text": "In between wooing sessions with Lt. Hoffman, Hawkeye continues to handle Corporal Walker's case.  He has summoned a man from C.I.D. to investigate the case in the hopes that it can be expedited.  What Oscar-nominated actor plays the part of Lt. Willis, the C.I.D. man sent from Tokyo?", "correct": "Burt Young", "options": ["Thomas Gomez", "Sal Mineo", "Tom Berenger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurt Young.\n\n\tBurt Young, who you may remember as Paulie from the 'Rocky' movies (he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the first 'Rocky' film), does a wonderful job playing the 'intimidating' Lt. Willis.  He'll be a tough nut for Hawkeye to crack! \n"}, {"text": "Several movie titles are mentioned during this episode, including one very amusing one phony title that may very well have featured Ronald Reagan had it been filmed.  What title is this?", "correct": "Bonzo Runs for President", "options": ["Bonzo Makes History", "Bonzo and the Governor", "Bonzo in Washington"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonzo Runs for President.\n\n\t'Bonzo Goes to College' is also mentioned in this episode.  That was an actual 1952 film.  'Bonzo Runs for President' was a phony movie title that none-the-less seems pretty prescient in retrospect, considering that future President Ronald Reagan appeared in the first Bonzo movie, namely 'Bedtime for Bonzo'! \n"}, {"text": "In one of the all-time most amusing scenes between Frank, Margaret and Henry, Henry carries on an entire dialogue with Frank via Hot Lips.  When Henry questions why Frank isn't doing his own speaking, Frank insists that he has a 'blood pressure situation'.  What 'sound effect' does he use to describe what would happen if his blood pressure goes out of control?", "correct": "Splack", "options": ["Plop", "Bloosh", "Kerplunk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSplack.\n\n\tThere are so many great moments in this scene, I wish I could just type out the entire dialogue, but that would be too cumbersome.  I'll just type my favorite line, which comes when Henry gets annoyed at Frank, speaking through his mouthpiece Margaret: 'Now you watch your language Frank or I might just have to punch her right in the mouth'. \n"}, {"text": "Just as Hawkeye is set to enjoy a wonderful evening with Lt. Hoffman, the C.I.D. man has arrived at the 4077th.  He is forced to temporarily postpone his date in order to take care of business.  Later, Klinger arrives at Nurse Hoffman's tent with a basket of food.  What delicious item is part of this lovely meal?", "correct": "Fried chicken", "options": ["Crab", "Meatloaf", "Shrimp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFried chicken.\n\n\tAt one point, Hawkeye returns to Lt. Hoffman's tent for a brief moment and he gets a chance to try the chicken.  'Mmmm, mmmm...terrible,' says Hawkeye as he walks out the door and returns to the Swamp. \n"}, {"text": "In the Swamp, Hawkeye works hard at convincing Lt. Willis that Corporal Walker's case is legitimate, and that he and his fianc\u00e9's marriage should be expedited.  In the process, Hawkeye offers Willis some gin from the still.  What word does Willis use to describe the gin?", "correct": "Turpentine", "options": ["Mothballs", "Petroleum", "Sandpaper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurpentine.\n\n\tWillis also refers to it as 'homemade hooch'.  The rather conservative Willis is not very cooperative with Hawkeye, disapproving of the fact that Walker and Kim have had a child out of wedlock. \n"}, {"text": "In the end, Hawkeye is able to get Willis to sign the approval form so that Walker and his fianc\u00e9 can get married, but he is forced to frame Willis in order to achieve this happy conclusion.  After Willis passes out from too much gin, Hawkeye makes it look like Willis has been with a nurse.  Which of these is not part of the frame-up?", "correct": "Perfume sprinkled on Willis' hair", "options": ["Lipstick on Willis' shirt", "A bra", "Alleged photographs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPerfume sprinkled on Willis' hair.\n\n\tUltimately, Willis agrees to sign the papers, but not before making a cruel crack about how difficult it will be for Walker and his wife to get an apartment.  Lt. Hoffman is even worse.  She becomes annoyed that Hawkeye has been spending so much effort bringing Walker and a Korean woman (she uses a racial epithet here) together.  Hawkeye walks out on his former nurse friend, giving her a raspberry in the process! \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the episode, Father Mulcahy marries Corporal Walker to his fianc\u00e9.  Who catches the bride's bouquet?", "correct": "Klinger", "options": ["Lt. Hoffman", "Margaret", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger.\n\n\tKlinger catches the bouquet, and ironically enough he does become the next member of the outfit to get married.
