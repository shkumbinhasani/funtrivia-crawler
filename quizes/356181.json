{"id": "356181", "name": "\"The Name Game\" Online Trivia | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Asylum"], "questions": [{"text": "Who reappears at Briarcliff with Grace?", "correct": "Pepper", "options": ["Alma", "'The Mexican'", "Shelley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPepper.\n\n\tIn his lab, Dr. Arden pounds on Kit's chest in an attempt to revive him from their potentially-fatal experiment (done in an attempt to make the alien visitors reappear at Briarcliff).  Moments before it's too late, Kit awakens with a sharp inhalation.  When he asks Dr. Arden if their results proved fruitful, Arden lies; there were no visitors, he says.  This is a lie.\rWhen Kit was knocked out, Grace and Pepper reappeared, the former with a pregnant belly and the latter with the ability to refine her speech.  He sets them up, at Pepper's request, with a room in the asylum-- his lab-- before returning to Kit.\rWhen Arden revisits Grace he attempts to learn more about this miracle baby but Pepper warns him that any attempts to use science to explain the event will be for naught; x-rays won't work and they won't let him perform a c-section.  Pepper, now condescending, says that Arden will not be allowed to interfere at the risk of his own madness. \n"}, {"text": "What does Sister Mary Eunice have delivered to the asylum?", "correct": "A jukebox", "options": ["A television", "New furniture", "A storage unit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA jukebox.\n\n\tThe Monsignor is wheeled into the office bedroom by Sister Mary Eunice having survived his ordeal with the Psycho Santa, Leigh Emerson, who, after crucifying the Monsignor, escaped Briarcliff and is at large.  Mary Eunice says that the Monsignor is not to blame for his faith and attempts to make him comfortable in his temporary lodgings.  What she doesn't know is that he spoke to the Archangel of Death, Shacnath, who told him that his time had not yet come-- he had more work to do, casting the devil from his favourite, young nun.  He would guard his thoughts with the rosary.  Sister Mary Eunice leaves to receive a delivery.\rThe delivery in question turns out to be a jukebox for the common room; Jude knows it's being done to taunt her.  Mary Eunice outwardly informs the other inmates that the responsibility lies with Patient G-2573, Judy Martin.  She immediately dedicates \"I've Put a Spell on You\" to the new resident. \n"}, {"text": "What does Sister Mary Eunice allegedly find in Judy's cell?", "correct": "A cucumber", "options": ["A whip", "A postcard", "A shard of glass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cucumber.\n\n\tKit returns to the common room to find Lana and the two of them sit down for a chat.  Lana says that Thredson escaped and Kit says he knows-- Thredson promptly walks into the room and sits across from them.  While Lana contemplates bashing Thredson's face with a thick ashtray, he reveals to Kit that the abortion Lana attempted to perform on herself failed; the baby's still in there and it's the only thing keeping her alive.  Kit's still wanted but Thredson won't turn him in because of the taped confession, so they're at a stalemate.  Thredson, however, has been offered a full-time position at Briarcliff by Mary Eunice who, after untying him from his slipknots, is allowing him to recommence Kit's treatment.\rThat evening, Sister Mary Eunice performs a cell search in the womens' ward, much like Jude used to do at random.  When she approaches Lana's cell, Lana chastises her for letting Thredson back into the building considering he's a murderer.  Lana is sent to the hydrotherapy room for a twenty-minute boiling.\rWhen Mary Eunice enters Judy's cell she comes back out with a cucumber, much like Judy found in Shelley's cell weeks before.  When Judy tells her to do her worst, Mary Euncie takes it upon herself to follow her wishes.  Judy's taken to the electroshock therapy room, strapped in, and zapped at full power (despite Arden's instruction to bring the power to a maximum of 50%). \n"}, {"text": "Who finds Sister Mary Eunice seducing the Monsignor?", "correct": "Dr. Arden", "options": ["Judy", "Kit", "Dr. Thredson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Arden\n\n\tWhile checking over the Monsignor's wounds, Sister Mary Eunice gets more than she bargains for when he places a crucifix on her head and attempts to exorcise the demon inside.  This proves fruitless as she breaks away and tosses him away with her telekinetic powers.  She hops on top of him in an attempt to seduce him.  His vow to the Lord and his chastity is less than enough to protect him from Sister Mary Eunice, who can't escape.  Mary Eunice turns to find Dr. Arden in the doorway, watching.\rJudy returns to the common room in a complete daze; Lana tells Kit that they must've turned up the juice for her, yet she doesn't feel better about it.  That's when Judy lolls her head around to see the jukebox.  Shuffling over, she begins to hit it and tug at the cords while Kit and Lana watch on. \n"}, {"text": "Who is not involved in Judy's 'Name Game' hallucination?", "correct": "Shelley", "options": ["Kit", "Pepper", "Lana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShelley.\n\n\tWhen Lana goes to help Judy after her 'therapy', Lana stands her up and asks her if she remembers her name.  Judy slowly turns to the jukebox, scrolls through the songs, and selects one: Shirley Ellison's \"The Name Game\".  What follows is all in Judy's mind-- she and the others in the common room sing and dance to the song in a vibrant common room. She's dressed in a blue dress with hair like Dusty Springfield.  Everyone, including the long-disappeared Pepper and the long-dead Mexican inmate sing along.  As the song ends, the record stops spinning and the room washes out.  Judy turns back to Lana who repeats the question again: \"Do you know your name?  Your name is Judy Martin.\" \n"}, {"text": "Who destroys the mutant results of Arden's experiments in the woods?", "correct": "Dr. Arden", "options": ["Sister Mary Eunice", "None of these", "Kit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Arden\n\n\tSister Mary Eunice accompanies Dr. Arden into the snowy woods with a wheelbarrow of raw meat and tries to discuss the previous night's affair.  As he tosses the food to the creatures as they emerge from the bushes, she asks him if it would be wise to perform a trans-orbital lobotomy on Jude, just to mess with her head, and he says no, simply because she wishes it.  Taking out a gun, he fires at each of his creations and deems the experiment over and done with.  He places the gun to his head but can't pull the trigger.  He begs her to take mercy on him and bring back the lost Mary Eunice, but she kicks him away and says that he's being pitiful.\rThe Monsignor finds Judy in the bakery and asks to speak to her.  Confused and at an end, he admits he was wrong for having her admitted; she was completely right about Sister Mary Eunice and they need to do something.  He's worried, however, since he is no longer virtuous in the eyes of the Lord.  As much as it pains her to think and speak coherently, she concisely tells him to kill Mary Eunice. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Arden assists Grace in having her baby.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDr. Thredson, making rounds in the asylum, asks an orderly to have Kit Walker brought to his office in a straight-jacket.  Before this happens, he needs to check in at Arden's lab.  He lets himself in while the doctor is out and searches for sodium pentothal, but he hears someone screaming from the other room.  Heading into the lab proper he finds Grace laying out on a slab.  Pepper informs him that the baby is crowning.\rMary Eunice finds the Monsignor praying for strength and she accuses him of having regrets for their night together.  He tries to stumble away and she realizes that he wants to kill her.  She taunts him and accuses him of murdering Shelley (which he did) before saying that she can give him what he wants-- she can help him ascend to papacy if he wants. \n"}, {"text": "The Monsignor defeats the demon inside Sister Mary Eunice by which means?", "correct": "He throws her over a balcony", "options": ["He sets them on fire", "He exorcises the demon", "He forces her to confront God"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe throws her over a balcony.\n\n\tAs Sister Mary Eunice leaves the office she says that the Monsignor's eagerness to kill her doesn't put her off whatsoever.  In fact, it's encouraging her to reward him with power.  He resists this, however, and says that he'll never be hers.  He continues prodding and says that Sister Mary Eunice, the actual Mary Eunice, is still inside her, holding on.  He vows to free her as the demon pushes him against the bannister of the stairwell outside. As the demon claims he will devour every last morsel of her soul, the real Mary Eunice emerges and says she's tired of fighting-- she's ready to let go.  The Monsignor tells her to do so before tossing her from the third-floor balcony. As she lands on the asylum floor, she watches as Shacnath descends upon her, kissing her and taking two lives-- those of Sister Mary Eunice and the demon inside. \n"}, {"text": "Who re-hides Thredson's taped confession?", "correct": "Lana", "options": ["Judy", "Kit", "Dr. Arden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLana.\n\n\tWhile the Monsignor gives Mary Eunice a prayer in the infirmary, Arden steps in and says that he will assist with the disposal of the body.  Although cremation is a Pagan practice, Arden argues that the cells of her body were corrupted by the Devil.  Although the monsignor says that he will assist, Arden insists; he'll do it alone.\rDr. Thredson brings Kit to his office with a surprise in waiting.  Opening the door, Kit is reunited with Grace, Pepper, and his newborn child.  Thredson gives an ultimatum-- if Kit gives him the taped confession, he will not harm Grace or the baby.  Kit reveals the location as being under one of the tubs in the hydrotherapy room but it's not there.\rThredson opens the towel in the hydrotherapy room to find something he wasn't looking for, a children's book.  He turns to find Lana in the doorway.  Realizing what was happening, she moved the tape.  She's the only one who knows where it is and if she sees any harm come to Kit or anyone else she will find a way to get it to the police, and he knows she will. \n"}, {"text": "How many bodies does Dr. Arden place into the oven in Briarcliff's crematorium?", "correct": "Two & 2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo & 2.\n\n\tJudy tries to remember the names of the other inmates in the common room before her Mother Superior enters for a visit.  Although the conversation starts with promise, Judy starts to mumble about the Monsignor taking her to Rome where he would become Pope and they would get married.  She also mentions being \"a rare bird\"; \"he likes her cooking\"; \"ravish me red\"; \"the devil was jealous\"; \"he had to kill her\".  Judy points to Lana across the room and tells Mother Superior that she put her there; Lana doesn't belong there and she needs to help her get out.\rIn the crematorium, Dr. Arden prepares Mary Eunice's body for the oven.  As he says his goodbyes, he crawls onto the slab and presses the control switch.  The two of them slide into the oven together and, as the door shuts, he lets out a tortured scream. \n"}]}
