{"id": "377291", "name": "HTML Quiz | Computers | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Computers", "Software and Programming"], "questions": [{"text": "When using tags in HTML code, they always appear how?", "correct": "Inside of angled brackets", "options": ["Only on the top of a document", "Always singularly", "In document footers and end notes only"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInside of angled brackets.\n\n\tHTML tags always need to be in angled brackets - the \"less than\" and \"greater than\" signs. For this reason, you cannot easily use these two in their mathematical meaning in HTML; the browser might erroneously interpret them as tags. \n"}, {"text": "Many modern websites will automatically fill in basic HTML codes for the user, but back in the days of hand coding how did a user start a new paragraph in HTML?\n", "correct": "With the letter \"P\" inside angle brackets", "options": ["All sites were written in large copy blocks with no paragraph breaks", "Writing out \"NEW PARAGRAPH\"  inside angle brackets", "By pressing the enter or return key"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith the letter \"P\" inside angle brackets.\n\n\tMany of the HTML commands are simple, and often they are shortened to a single letter for brevity in typing out lines of code.\r Like in all computer languages, a single misplaced character can lead to an entire web page to not load properly, so hand coding requires extra care. \n"}, {"text": "If a programmer types \"HR\" (inside of angle brackets) into his or her site, what is it that they are adding?", "correct": "A horizontal line", "options": ["A new \"house rule\" or invisible element", "A huge rendered photo", "A link to an external website"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA horizontal line.\n\n\tUsed in older, mostly text based, sites to visually break up the site, horizontal lines are generally not used in modern web design.\r Modern web design tends to be more dynamic and uses elements such as photos/videos and other widgets instead of the drab line to break up the site. \n"}, {"text": "What is the correct HTML tag syntax for adding a background color to an entire page?", "correct": "bgcolor=\"yellow\"", "options": ["BACKGROUND=YELLOW", "Yellow Background: Tag", "b Yellow:010110001 /b"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbgcolor=\"yellow\".\n\n\tUsing modern coding the body style attribute should be used to change the background color of a website. Older code often used the bgcolor attribute.\r An alternative to specifying a color code would be to use a background image that was just one pixel of a color, but that can generate extra loading times and cause issues on bad connections. \n"}, {"text": "What organization sets the standards that are used across the internet?", "correct": "The World Wide Web Consortium", "options": ["Apple", "Google", "Microsoft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium.\n\n\tGoogle is an internet company. Microsoft creates software and Apple does both hardware and software.\r The World Wide Web Consortium was founded in 1994, and was tasked with setting basic standards for websites worldwide. \r The consortium was founded by Tim Berners-Lee, the same man credited with inventing the HTTP protocol that is the basis of the World Wide Web. \n"}, {"text": "Which keyboard symbol is used to indicate a closing tag?", "correct": "forward slash", "options": ["angle bracket", "asterisk", "hashtag or number sign"], "explanation": "\n\n\nforward slash.\n\n\tAdding a slash as the first character inside the brackets signifies that the code is being closed.\r Using pairs of tags allows the changing of colors, fonts, links and styles for only certain sections instead of the entire web page.\r Most HTML tags require a matching closing tag - notable exceptions are the BR tag denoting a line break and the above mentioned HR tag. \n"}, {"text": "HTML coding is what is used to create games such as \"Minecraft\" and \"Super Mario Brothers\".", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tHTML is a markup (presentation) language. It codes how pages are displayed in web browsers. It can be used to embed active elements on a page, but not to create the actual elements. \r You may have heard of games or other elements coded in HTML5, however, this is not quite correct: The active content of HTML5 code is written in a scripting language, usually Javascript. \n"}, {"text": "Websites, or specifically the code used to make them do not fall under copyright protection anywhere in the world.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually quite the opposite, unless the site is listed as being \"open source\" the coding falls under the copyright laws of the country where the server that is physically hosting the site is located. \n"}, {"text": "What is the correct HTML formatting for inserting a hyperlink on a website?", "correct": "A HREF=\"http://www.webaddress.com\" (closed with /A)", "options": ["INSERT www.webaddress.com (closed with /I)", "WEB site name (closed with /WEB)", "!CLICK HERE!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA HREF=\"http://www.webaddress.com\" (closed with /A)\n\n\tThe portion in quotes inside the opening tag is the actual link. Between the opening and closing tag, you need to place the text that will appear on the site in a clickable format. \n"}, {"text": "When writing HTML code, you have to adhere to a strict standard of using spaces.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWeb browsers ignore spaces in written code except when they separate words or elements. Multiple spaces, new lines or tab stops are displayed as a single space. You can use spaces as a way to make it easier for humans to read and edit your source code. \n"}]}
