{"id": "85766", "name": "Quotes From \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" Quiz | Television | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Star Trek Universe", "Star Trek: The Next Generation"], "questions": [{"text": "\"That was NOT 'manual override'.\"", "correct": "Data", "options": ["Worf", "LaForge", "All of the above"], "explanation": "\n\n\nData.\n\n\tIn the second season episode \"Contagion,\" Picard brings Data and Worf down to the planet Iconia to try to decipher the control structures left behind by a long-dead race.  Data surmises that he has successfully translated the Iconian language, but when he keys a sequence that he thought was \"manual override,\" a pan-dimensional transport system activates itself rather dramatically.  The above quote is his immediate commentary. \n"}, {"text": "\"Hey, at least I don't have to get my women on the holodeck.\"", "correct": "Acting Ensign Wesley Crusher", "options": ["Commander Will Riker", "Q", "Chief O'Brien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nActing Ensign Wesley Crusher.\n\n\tIn the third season episode \"Sarek,\" the title character's debilitating disease results in his telepathic amplification of the ENTERPRISE crew's emotions -- especially the negative ones.  Wesley therefore gets a little more mouthy than he would normally be with Lt. Commander Geordi LaForge, who's been known to enjoy the company of a holographic female or two in his day. \n"}, {"text": "\"'Seasoned'?  That's a terrible thing to say to a man.\"", "correct": "Commander Will Riker", "options": ["Captain Jean-Luc Picard", "Admiral Mark Jameson", "Ambassador Kyle Riker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommander Will Riker.\n\n\tCounselor Deanna Troi mentioned, in \"Best of Both Worlds, Part I\" (the finale of the third season), that Riker seemed more \"seasoned\" in recent years.  Will apparently didn't appreciate her verbiage. \n"}, {"text": "\"Oh, very clever, Worf.  Eat any good books lately?\"", "correct": "Q", "options": ["Guinan", "Geordi LaForge", "Dr. Beverly Crusher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQ.\n\n\tOne of the funniest things ever said on the show.  In the third season episode \"Deja Q,\" Q (John DeLancie) has been ejected by the Q Continuum and reduced to a powerless human.  When he first arrives on the bridge of the ENTERPRISE, however, no one seems to believe that his claim of expulsion is real.  \"What do I have to do to convince you people that I'm mortal?\" he asks.  \"Die,\" says Worf.  The above quote is Q's response. \n"}, {"text": "\"Part of Starfleet's mission is to seek out new life.  Well, THERE IT SITS!\"", "correct": "Picard & Captain Picard & Jean-Luc Picard & Captain Jean-Luc Picard & Capt. Picard & Capt.

Jean-Luc Picard\n\n\tPicard defends the legal rights of his friend and second officer, Data, in the milestone second season episode, \"Measure of a Man.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Pinocchio is dead; its strings have been cut.\"", "correct": "Riker", "options": ["LaForge", "Picard", "Q"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiker.\n\n\tDuring the trial comprising most of the action of \"Measure of a Man,\" Riker utilizes Data's \"off\" switch, and abuses (some would say) both his knowledge of Data's anatomy, and the use of the \rnickname \"Pinocchio\" that Riker gave Data in the pilot episode, \"Encounter At Farpoint.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Good tea.  Nice house.\"", "correct": "Lt. Worf", "options": ["Lt. Cmdr. Geordi LaForge", "Capt. Jean-Luc Picard", "Cmdr. William Riker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLt. Worf\n\n\tIn the third season episode \"The Survivors,\" Worf and Picard are served tea by the Uxbridges, a seemingly human couple who have somehow lived through a devastating alien assault.  When asked if he likes the tea, the above quote is Worf's response -- yet another example of his lack of expertise in the social niceties. \n"}, {"text": "\"Will Riker -- you are the best.  You supported me.  You encouraged me.  But most of all, you made me laugh.\"", "correct": "Lt. Tasha Yar", "options": ["Lt. Cmdr. Geordi LaForge", "Counselor Deanna Troi", "Dr. Beverly Crusher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLt. Tasha Yar\n\n\tThis is one of the lines heard during Tasha's holographically-recorded \"funeral speech\" in the first season's \"Skin of Evil.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"I guess I'd make a pretty lousy Romulan.\"", "correct": "Lt. Cmdr. Geordi LaForge", "options": ["Chief O'Brien", "Ensign Ro Laren", "Counselor Deanna Troi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLt. Cmdr. Geordi LaForge\n\n\tIn the third season episode \"The Enemy,\" LaForge is trapped on a hostile planet with a Romulan officer.  They form an unexpected bond, and exchange cultural details.  When Geordi learns that Romulans are trained to be thrilled about giving their lives for the Empire, he speaks the quoted line. \n"}, {"text": "\"I am sorry if I have ended our friendship.\"", "correct": "Data", "options": ["Troi", "Worf", "Guinan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nData.\n\n\tFrom the seventh season episode \"Gambit, Part II.\"  Picard is presumed dead, and Riker has gone off in search of him; this leaves Data in command of the ENTERPRISE.  Worf is therefore acting first officer, and after he publicly refutes one of Data's command decisions on the bridge, Data requests a private conference with Worf.  Data dresses Worf down quite severely (and appropriately)...but the moment that chore is complete, Data remembers that this is his friend he's been berating, and he adds the quoted line just before the chastised Klingon leaves the room.  It's a great scene! \n"}, {"text": "\"He *is* a Borg!\"", "correct": "Lt. Worf", "options": ["Cmdr. William Riker", "Lt. Cmdr. Elizabeth Shelby", "Lt. Cmdr. Geordi LaForge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLt. Worf\n\n\tFrom one of the most popular episodes of the entire series, the third season finale, \"Best of Both Worlds Part I.\"  After Picard has been abducted by the Borg, Lt. Cmdr. Shelby (Elizabeth Dennehy) leads an away team to save him.  They are unsuccessful, however, as Picard has already been transmuted into \"Locutus.\"  Upon the away team's return, they are asked if Picard has been rescued from the Borg; Worf's line, above, is the heated, frustrated response. \n"}, {"text": "\"Honesty is the quality he admires the most.\"", "correct": "Deanna Troi", "options": ["Katherine Pulaski", "Beverly Crusher", "Guinan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeanna Troi.\n\n\tIn the second season episode \"The Icarus Factor,\" Riker's father Kyle (Mitchell Ryan) has a mildly tense chat with Troi regarding his son.  At one point, Kyle Riker notes that Will probably admires Troi's bluntness.  The above quote is her response. \n"}, {"text": "[In response to a telepath] \"Yes!  I can understand you perfectly!\"", "correct": "Dr. Katherine Pulaski", "options": ["Dr. Beverly Crusher", "Captain Jean-Luc Picard", "Counselor Deanna Troi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Katherine Pulaski\n\n\tPulaski, much to the surprise of Data, can \"hear\" the communication attempts of a genetically-engineered telepath aboard an ENTERPRISE shuttlecraft in the second season episode \"Unnatural Selection.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"I wish that time had given me the chance to know you better.\"", "correct": "Picard", "options": ["Guinan", "Riker", "Data"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPicard.\n\n\tPicard says this to Mark Twain (a.k.a. Samuel Clemens) in the sixth season premiere, \"Time's Arrow, Part II.\"  Clemens tells Picard that anyone who wants to know him should just read his books -- which Picard, presumably, already has! \n"}, {"text": "\"If I were you...I'd turn back now.\"", "correct": "Guinan", "options": ["Q", "The Traveler", "Q2"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuinan.\n\n\tIn the second season episode \"Q Who,\" perennial nemesis Q transports the ENTERPRISE far across the known universe, and into conflict with the Borg for the first time.  Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) recognizes the genocidal cyborg race immediately, and offers the quoted advice to Picard and his crew, even though it's been made clear that it would take the crew well over a hundred years to get home. \n"}]}
