{"id": "135472", "name": "Eliminate a Choice - Art Quiz | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art"], "questions": [{"text": "Monet, Degas, Renoir, Matisse.  Which of these individuals should be eliminated from this list based on the art movement with which each is most closely associated?", "correct": "Matisse", "options": ["Renoir", "Degas", "Monet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatisse.\n\n\tClaude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir were all founding members of the French Impressionist movement, while Matisse was simply a wild beast (Fauvist, for the art lover!).  It may be argued that Matisse was associated with the Impressionist movement, but most experts agree that Matisse was merely influenced by the Impressionists and then moved on from there. \n"}, {"text": "Der Blaue Reiter, Die Br\u00fccke, Bauhaus, Dresdner Sezession.  One of these movements is not associated with German Expressionism, but which?", "correct": "Bauhaus", "options": ["Dresdner Sezession", "Der Blaue Reiter", "Die Br\u00fccke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBauhaus.\n\n\tDer Blaue Reiter (The Blue Riders), Die Br\u00fccke (The Bridge) and the Dresdner Sezession are all sub-movements in a larger movement art historians haved deemed 'German Expressionism'.  Bauhaus is essentially unrelated to German Expressionism, being instead a school for art and design created by Walter Gropius in Weimar in 1919. \n"}, {"text": "Corinthian, Ionic, Doric and Attic.  Which of these terms does not describe an ancient Greek order of column?", "correct": "Attic", "options": ["Corinthian", "Doric", "Ionic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttic.\n\n\tNot only are the terms Doric, Ionic and Corinthian related to columns, they are also the names of the classic orders of architecture.  Two other orders of columns to know: Composite and Tuscan, both of which first appeared in Italy rather than Greece. \n"}, {"text": "Ghiberti, Giotto, Donatello, Bernini.  One of these early Italian artists does not fit amongst the others based on the art medium with which he was known to work, you select which one.", "correct": "Giotto", "options": ["Donatello", "Bernini", "Ghiberti"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGiotto.\n\n\tGhiberti, Donatello and Bernini were all known primarily for their sculpture.  Giotto was perhaps the first famous fresco artist in modern art history.  To my knowledge, no extant sculptures exist that were created by the hand of Mr. di Bondone (Giotto).  Likewise, an art fan would be unable to find a painting by either Donatello or Ghiberti, and the occasional Bernini painting is probably best avoided! \n"}, {"text": "Vorticism, Constructivism, Suprematism, Rayonism.  Here's a question that might be a challenge...which of these art movements was not founded in Russia?", "correct": "Vorticism", "options": ["Suprematism", "Constructivism", "Rayonism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVorticism.\n\n\tSuprematism was founded by Malevich in Russia in 1915.  The name did not refer to his superior ability, but rather the supremity of geometric figures.  Constructivism was likewise founded in Russia, in 1913, while Rayonism was another movement with its origins in Russia, founded in 1912 by Goncharova and Larionov.  Vorticism might sound Russian, but in fact it was an English art movement, also founded in 1912 and featuring the art stylings of Wyndham Lewis, among others.  Apparently, Ezra Pound bestowed this unusual name on the short-lived movement. \n"}, {"text": "Kylix, Kore, Amphora, Rhyton.  Select the ancient Greek pottery item that was not used to hold liquid.", "correct": "Kore", "options": ["Rhyton", "Kylix", "Amphora"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKore.\n\n\tThe ancient Greeks are celebrated in art for their wonderful pottery and sculptured items.  These items include the kylix, amphora and rhyton, all of which were used to hold water, or better yet...wine!  A Kore was a statue of a maiden, draped in ancient Greek garment.  I will make no mention about a Kore's ability to hold water... \n"}, {"text": "Rembrandt, Rubens, Fabritius, Vermeer.  Which of these artists was not either a student or teacher of one of the others?", "correct": "Rubens", "options": ["Rembrandt", "Fabritius", "Vermeer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRubens.\n\n\tBoth Rembrandt and Rubens took a number of pupils during their illustrious careers.  One of Rembrandt's pupils was the great Carel Fabritius, who died quite young in an accident (32 years old).  Before Fabritius' tragic passing he managed to pass on Rembrandt's instructions to the wonderful master of Delft, Vermeer. \n"}, {"text": "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, Guernica, The Charnel House, The Third of May.  Three of these are titles of paintings by Picasso, while the fourth is not.  Select the latter work.", "correct": "The Third of May", "options": ["Les Demoiselles d'Avignon", "The Charnel House", "Guernica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Third of May.\n\n\t'The Charnel House' and 'Guernica' were both anti-war paintings by Picasso, one protesting the Korean War while the other protested the German bombing of Guernica in Spain.  'Les Demoiselles' was the painting that perhaps initiated the Cubist movement, of which Picasso was a part.  'The Third of May' was also an anti-war painting, but it was created by another Spanish master...Goya. \n"}, {"text": "Whistler, Wyeth, Sargent, Homer.  These four are all celebrated American artists; one was not actually born in America...but which?", "correct": "Sargent", "options": ["Whistler", "Homer", "Wyeth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSargent.\n\n\tWinslow Homer was born in Boston, Massachusetts, Andrew Wyeth in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania and James A. M. Whistler in Lowell, Massachusetts.  John Singer Sargent was born of American parents in Florence, Italy.  He was later schooled in Paris, and based himself sometimes in London, sometimes in the United States.  For more on Sargent, please see my quiz on his life and times! \n"}, {"text": "Menhir, Mastaba, Megaron, Makemono.  Three of these terms relate to works of ancient stone sculpture or architecture, while one does not.  Which one is unrelated to the rest?", "correct": "Makemono", "options": ["Mastaba", "Megaron", "Menhir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMakemono.\n\n\tA 'menhir' is a huge block of stone, also known as a 'megalith'.  In ancient Mycenean architecture, a 'megaron' referred to the main hall or chamber of a palace.  Examples of 'mastabas', a form of burial chamber, can still be found in Egypt.  The term 'makemono' refers to a traditional scroll painting of Japan.  Speaking of which, you have scrolled to the end of this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and did well...thanks for playing! \n"}]}
