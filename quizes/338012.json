Sam wants to go further with Quinn and Finn, having been in a relationship with her before, knows exactly what it's like.  He explains that whenever he has sexual thoughts with Rachel he counteracts them by thinking about accidentally killing a mail worker in his car (as previously seen in season 1).  Sam finds his 'mailman' when Coach Beiste comes into the locker room and yells at Artie for not wearing a jockstrap.  Both he and Finn realize that when she gets angry, she has to readjust her underwear.\rIn the halls at school, Kurt continues to be bullied by Karofsky.  When he and Tina walk in the halls, he's pushed against the lockers.  Kurt heads to Glee Club relatively angry.\rIn the choir room, Will makes a couple of announcements.  Firstly, Puck has also returned to McKinley having been sent to juvie for a couple weeks.  Secondly, their Sectionals competition has been announced; they'll be facing off against the Warblers, members of an all-boys school, and the Hipsters, a group comprised of elderly people getting their GEDs.  Thirdly, this is the second annual mash-up week and again, it's boys versus girls.  The kids split off into their gender-specific groups and Kurt is told to join the boys ,something he's not thrilled about. \n"}, {"text": "Puck was allowed to leave juvie early on what condition?", "correct": "That he perform community service", "options": ["That he apologize to all victims of his crime", "That he promise never to steal again", "That he achieve a B average in school"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat he perform community service.\n\n\tIn the halls, Puck begins to wheel Artie around.  Artie assumes that he'll be pushed down a staircase, but puck assure him that it's fine.  He got out of juvie early on the condition that he'd do community service.  He claims that he told them he had a crippled friend (Artie) who needed help, so the two of them need to start spending more time.  Artie seems okay with this, but Puck says not to jump to the conclusion that they're friends.\rKurt is pushed into the lockers again by Karofsky.  When Kurt talks back to him, they get into an argument and Kurt is left exhausted.  Will takes Kurt aside to his office and asks if he can help, but Kurt says it'll do no good.  He just feels like it's hopeless and that he's not challenged at McKinley.  Will makes an adjustment to the mash-up rules.  The boys will sing songs by girl performers and the girls will sing male group songs.  When Kurt lays out his plans for their performance, the others make fun of his focus on fashion and Puck suggests he go spy on the other teams to be useful.\rSam and Quinn once again spend time with one another and Sam puts his plan into action by picturing Coach Beiste in sexy clothing.  The plan works too well; he says 'Beiste' instead of 'Quinn'. \n"}, {"text": "During the mash-up of \"One Love\" and \"People Get Ready\", Puck and Artie are accompanied by students playing which instruments?", "correct": "Steel drums", "options": ["Violins", "Trumpets", "Guitars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteel drums.\n\n\tQuinn approaches Sue about the Beiste issue and her image problems.  Because she's been getting straight-As and it dating a cute guy, she should be on top.  Sue simply sees this odd turn of evens as an opportunity to get Beiste out of the school.  Sue suggests that they let the story loose and that Quinn give Sam a piece of her mind in public.\rOn the steps outside the school, Puck opens up his guitar case and suggests that he and Artie busk for money.  When Puck starts playing a mash-up of \"One Love\" and \"People Get Ready\", Artie joins in saying that he's never broken the rules like this before.  Soon, everyone is handing in money and joining in.  When they end up earning about $300, they decide to use it.  When Santana and Brittany come along, Puck realizes that Artie has a thing for Brittany and says that they'll be using some of their money to treat the girls out to dinner at Breadstix. \n"}, {"text": "At Dalton Academy, Kurt witnesses the Warblers perform which song by Katy Perry?", "correct": "Teenage Dream", "options": ["I Kissed a Girl", "Firework", "Hot and Cold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeenage Dream.\n\n\tKurt stakes out the Dalton Academy as per the others' suggestion and discovers that it's actually a really nice place.  While walking through the halls, Kurt realizes that the students are actually rushing around a lot and when he stops one boy named Blaine, he's told that the Warblers are getting ready to perform.  Kurt's shocked that the Glee Club is kind of cool at this school and Blaine claims that they're like rock stars.  Blaine grabs Kurt by the hand and leads him through the halls to the proper room where the Warblers are setting up.  Blaine tells Kurt to enjoy before he and the Warblers sing their way into an a cappella rendition of Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream\".\rBack at McKinley, Mike tells Tina about the Beiste cool-down and they decide to try it out in one of the classrooms.  It turns out that Tina is the one to call out Beiste's name this time.  Mike is left confused. \n"}, {"text": "Blaine confirms to Kurt that he is gay.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tQuinn confronts Sam in the school's hallways just as Beiste passes by.  Soon, the football coach is dragged into the mess (which is made worse when Mike walks by and tells her to stay away from Tina).  Will takes Sam and Mike aside in the choir room and tells them to stop; Beiste's feelings would be hurt if she found out the truth about what they're doing.  Besides, she's just as much an outsider as they are.  Will says that Beiste can never know about this and the boys apologize.\rKurt goes to coffee with some of the guys from Dalton Academy and they call him out for being a spy (but they're okay with it).  Blaine says that he realized Kurt's ulterior motives for coming to Dalton though.  When Kurt asks if they're gay, Blaine says that he is, but the others aren't; their school just has a no-harassment policy.  Blaine and Kurt speak alone about Kurt's bully problem and Blaine says that he knows exactly what he's been going through.  When Blaine had to deal with it, he moved to Dalton, but since it's expensive he recommends that Kurt confront Karofsky. \n"}, {"text": "Who tells Coach Beiste the truth about using her to 'cool off'?", "correct": "Will", "options": ["Sam", "Puck", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill.\n\n\tThe girls put together their costumes and try to figure out how to one-up the boys' performance and they're shocked to find that Rachel isn't yelling at them.  Surprisingly, Rachel's taking the lesson plan to 'do the opposite' to an extreme and she's deciding to not boss people around.  Their conversation is cut short when Puck and Artie come in to speak to Brittany and Santana about dinner.  Due to Puck's almost-cruel demeanor toward the girls, they secure dates at Breadstix.\rBeiste talks to Will in the staff room about the Glee kids' attitudes and he initially tries to shy away from the conversation.  When she says that Will is the only person at the school she can trust, he lays it all out for her.  She says she has no reason not to take it personally and leaves. \n"}, {"text": "Who pays for dinner at Breadstix during the proposed 'Dine and Dash'?", "correct": "Artie", "options": ["Brittany", "Santana", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArtie.\n\n\tAt Breadstix, Puck recalls his time at juvie with the others by telling a story about a fight about an Eggo waffle in the cafeteria line.  Santana is thrilled saying that he should be their nation's president.  When Brittany asks Artie why he isn't responding to her touching his leg for the past hour and a half, he responds that he thinks the waitress has a thing for him.  Puck makes the decision (when the bill comes along) to dine and dash and Artie has a conflict with this.  He decides to pay without their knowing and Puck is disappointed in him.  Puck says that he's not invited back to his place because he wussed out.\rIn the choir room the next day, the girls do their performance, a mash-up of the Rolling Stones' \"Start Me Up\" and \"Livin' on a Prayer\" by Bon Jovi.  After an impressive routine, Becky comes into the choir room with a message from Sue. \n"}, {"text": "When Beiste quits, what does Sue end up purchasing?", "correct": "Confetti cannons", "options": ["A gold tracksuit", "A new bullhorn", "Her office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConfetti cannons.\n\n\tIn the auditorium, Sue showcases her two new confetti cannons for Will and reveals that Beiste quit her job, and it was all because the Glee Club did what they did.  Sue asks Will to clean up the mess before she heads off.\rIn the halls, Kurt reads a text he received from Blaine earlier saying 'Courage.'  As he does this, Karofsky knocks the phone out of his hand and pushes him into a locker.  This time, fed up, Kurt follows him and decides to fight back.  Coming across him in the locker room, they argue about Karofsky's homophobic remarks and ignorance.  Kurt tells him to hit him and get it over with but instead, Karofsky kisses him.  Before Karofsky can kiss him again, Kurt backs away.  Frustrated, Karofsky punches the locker and leaves Kurt standing there, shocked.\rWill tells the Glee kids that Coach Beiste quit because of the boys (and Tina).  The guys explain the truth and Santana explains that if more people put out, then they wouldn't have this problem.  Will leaves it to the kids to figure out what to do because he's so disappointed in them.  Principal Figgins enters the room soon after and asks that Will and Puck head to his office. \n"}, {"text": "Other than Kurt, who receives their first kiss in this episode?", "correct": "Coach Beiste", "options": ["Artie", "Sue", "Sam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoach Beiste.\n\n\tPuck's worker is in Principal Figgins' office and she's concerned with his community service work (since he wrote 'working with a 'crip' on it).  He explains that he's actually been spending time with Artie; Will has to agree since he hasn't done anything wrong since he's come back.  Frustrated with the possibility of having to go to juvie, Puck gets angry and leaves, passing by Artie in the halls.\rKurt brings Blaine to McKinley so that they can both confront Karofsky.  Blaine speaks to him bluntly and they start to fight about the issue.  Karofsky leaves and Blaine figures (pretty obviously) that he's not going to come out.  Kurt sits down in disappointment as Karofsky was actually his first kiss.  Blaine offers to buy him lunch.\rWill speaks with Beiste when she starts to pack her belongings and he tries to convince her to stay.  She reveals that she'll find her happiness elsewhere; she's too scarred by high school.  It turns out that she's never been kissed.  She just wants to be reminded that she's a girl, but she finds it too hard to go out and find somebody.  Will gives her her first kiss and tells her to come to the choir room the next day. \n"}, {"text": "Artie volunteers to tutor Puck in which course?", "correct": "Geometry", "options": ["History", "Spanish", "Home Ec."], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeometry.\n\n\tArtie finds Puck packing up his locker and after a talk, Puck reveals that he was terrified of juvie and he never wants to go back.  He doesn't want to pick up trash either.  Artie makes a compromise.  If Puck cleans up trash, he'll help him ace geometry so that he can stay at McKinley.  Puck agrees to this.\rKurt places a picture of Blaine in his locker just down the hall before he's pushed into it by Karofsky.  Some things don't change.\rIn the choir room, the boys apologize to Coach Beiste and perform their mash-up dedicated to her.  Rather than sing and dance to beat the girls, they perform for her forgiveness.  Their song, a mash-up of \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" by The Supremes and \"Free Your Mind\" by En Vogue, goes over well with the coach who cracks a smile and says she likes it.  They all hug it out. \n"}]}
