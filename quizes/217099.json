{"id": "217099", "name": "Top Movies of 1998 Online Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1990s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "I must begin with a certain film, as it is among my all-time favorites.  The plot revolves around a precocious young man who is very active in his high school, but neglects his school work.  To make matters worse, he falls in love with a member of the faculty and befriends a neurotic businessman, played by Bill Murray, who is living a miserable existence.  Which movie, with a nice, tidy, happy ending, is described above?", "correct": "Rushmore", "options": ["Happiness", "Deconstructing Harry", "Simon Birch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRushmore.\n\n\tAh, 'Rushmore', where to begin?  Directed by Wes Anderson, the film features the charming acting of Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, among others.  Anderson collaborated on the script writing with his good friend Owen Wilson, the two having worked together previously on 'Bottle Rocket'.  Don't miss the scenes featuring Max Fischer's (Jason Schwartzman) stage rendition of 'Serpico'! \n"}, {"text": "If you dislike the neurotic, the disconnected and the downright bizarre, perhaps the film 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is not for you.  However, this author is a huge fan of this madcap romp featuring Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro in an ensemble cast.  This dizzying film was radically directed by which auteur?", "correct": "Terry Gilliam", "options": ["John Waters", "Tim Burton", "Paul Anderson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerry Gilliam.\n\n\tTerry Gilliam is known for his film weirdness, but this one takes the cake.  'Fear and Loathing' features Depp in a marvelous performance as the author Hunter S. Thompson.  Benicio Del Toro performs admirably as Thompson's 'lawyer' sidekick.  Appearances are also made by Tobey Maguire, Ellen Barkin, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci and, well, half of Hollywood.  Do check this one out if you have not already. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the fastest paced movie of all time was the frenetic 1998 film entitled in English 'Run Lola Run'.  In its native land, the film was called 'Lola Rennt'.  From whence came this outstanding action adventure flick?", "correct": "Germany", "options": ["Hungary", "Denmark", "Sweden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGermany.\n\n\tTom Tykwer was the director of this non-stop, heart palpitating cinematic gem.  Tykwer presents the viewer with three different versions of a single set of events, each varying based on seemingly minor decisions made by the main character Lola (who is played by Franka Potente).  Certainly the film is worth a look. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most beautiful and heart-breaking films of 1998 was this one out of Brazil, that featured a wonderful performance by Fernanda Montenegro and the superb directing of Walter Salles.  The story revolves around a young boy whose mother is killed, and who now must journey with a less-than-symathetic woman who writes letters for the illiterate in search of the father who left him .  What is the English language title of this movie?", "correct": "Central Station", "options": ["Open Your Eyes", "Beyond Silence", "Firelight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCentral Station.\n\n\tYou may be familiar with Walter Salles' more recent film, 'The Motorcycle Diaries'.  'Central Station' was a much earlier venture for Salles, though its impact on the film world has been just as powerful.  \r The role of Josu\u00e9, the young boy searching for his father, was played by a real-life shoeshine boy named Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira. \n"}, {"text": "If for no other reason, the gut-wrenching film 'American History X', the story of a young man coming to grips with his racist upbringing, should be watched so as to catch the performance of which actor, playing the lead role of Derek Vinyard?", "correct": "Ed Norton", "options": ["Barry Pepper", "Brad Pitt", "Keanu Reeves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEd Norton.\n\n\t'American History X' is not for the faint of heart.  Aside from the dark language and dialogue, there are several scenes of shocking violence.  However, the messages delivered in the film make it a worthy watch.\r Oddly enough, a conflict that arose between Ed Norton and director Tony Kaye prompted the latter to request that his name be dropped in favor of a pseudonym.  In the ensuing battle, Kaye filed a lawsuit against both New Line Cinema and the Director's Guild of America. \n"}, {"text": "If some of the above films are a bit harsh and difficult, try this one on for size.  It features the story of two young Native American men from Idaho, named Thomas and Victor, who embark on a journey to Arizona to retrieve the ashes of Victor's recently deceased father.  Which film title fits the description here?", "correct": "Smoke Signals", "options": ["Edge of America", "Skins", "A Thousand Roads"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmoke Signals.\n\n\tBased in part on stories from Sherman Alexie's book 'The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven', 'Smoke Signals' is a charming film from beginning to end.  \r For those of you who, like me, are big fans of this movie, might I suggest trying my two quizzes relating to the film? \n"}, {"text": "'Elizabeth' was a beautifully acted, brilliantly directed film by Shekhar Kapur, featuring some of the key events in the life of one of Britain's most celebrated monarchs.  Who portrayed the so-called 'Virgin Queen', Elizabeth I, in this lovely movie?", "correct": "Cate Blanchett", "options": ["Kate Winslet", "Gwyneth Paltrow", "Juliette Binoche"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCate Blanchett.\n\n\tMy goodness can Cate Blanchett act!  And if Ms Blanchett is not enough, we also have the marvelous, almost frightening performance by Geoffrey Rush as the slithering Sir Francis Walsingham.  Let us finally not also forget the performance by Sir John Gielgud as the pope in his final feature film. \n"}, {"text": "Brendan Fraser and Ian McKellen star in one of 1998's most powerful and challenging films, a biopic featuring the last days of James Whale, the notorious director of such films as 'Frankenstein' and 'The Invisible Man'.  What is the evocative title of this remarkable film?", "correct": "Gods and Monsters", "options": ["Beautiful Thing", "Fallen Angels", "Before Night Falls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGods and Monsters.\n\n\tMcKellen's acting alone is worth the price of admission (or a video store rent).  Brendan Fraser is surprisingly unassuming as Clayton Boone, a not-so-bright factotum who befriends the elderly Whale during the classic film director's last earthly moments.  I kindly recommend you check this one out. \n"}, {"text": "Featuring the acting of Ed Norton, Matt Damon and John Malkovich, this film explores the seedy world of high stakes poker.  What film title fits this brief description? ", "correct": "Rounders", "options": ["The Borrowers", "Henry Fool", "The Edge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRounders.\n\n\tEd Norton had quite a year in 1998.  Not only did he knock our socks off with his performance in 'American History X', he also took a turn as Worm, the sleazy card-playing pal of fellow 'rounder' Mike McDermott (Matt Damon).  As if Norton isn't enough, we have the enigmatic performance by John Malkovich as Teddy KGB.  Alongside them also appear Martin Landau and John Turturro.  Heck, even poker legend Johnny Chan makes a brief appearance!  Even if you are not a fan of the game, you may very well enjoy this thought-provoking and redeeming film. \n"}, {"text": "One for the kids here.  Which Disney animated film features the story about a young Chinese woman who is forced to don the clothing of a warrior, in replacement of her disabled father?", "correct": "Mulan", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMulan.\n\n\t'Mulan' is roughly based on an ancient Chinese poem of anonymous authorship.  Voices in this charming film were provided by Miguel Ferrer, Harvey Fierstein, James Hong, Eddie Murphy, Pat Morita, George Takei, Ming-Na Wen and several other fairly notable Asian-American actors.  Donny Osmond provides his singing voice for one of the characters, while Christina Aguilera, Stevie Wonder and Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor also all provide their singing voices for some of the film's tunes.\r Thank you for trying this quiz.  I hope you enjoyed, if not agreed, with the material presented here. \n"}]}
