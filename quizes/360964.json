{"id": "360964", "name": "Birds of a Feather Online Quiz | Video Games Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture", "Animals in Video Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Banjo is a bear that has a red bird for a sidekick.  What is the name of this feathery friend?", "correct": "Kazooie", "options": ["Mumbo Jumbo", "Bottles", "Gruntilda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKazooie.\n\n\tWhile all characters mentioned are in the \"Banjo-Kazooie\" series, only Kazooie is a bird.  Kazooie is called a red-crested Breegull, and first made an appearance in 1998 when \"Banjo-Kazooie\" was released.\r Her main companion is Banjo the bear, though they also meet several other characters (good and bad) throughout the game.  Bottles is a mole, Mumbo Jumbo is a tiki man, and Gruntilda is an evil witch. \n"}, {"text": "Donkey Kong, as well as his pal, Diddy, seem to come across many birds throughout their adventures.  Of these birds, one of them is good, and you can ride him to get some extra distance in some levels.  Which of these characters is an ostrich ally in \"Donkey Kong Country\"?", "correct": "Expresso", "options": ["Squawks", "Winky", "Enguarde"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExpresso.\n\n\tIn the 1994 video game \"Donkey Kong Country\", the player controls either Donkey Kong or Diddy Kong in a side-scrolling platformer, on their way through many levels to defeat King K. Rool.  There are several allies throughout the game to help you out, including Rambi the Rhino, Winky the Frog, Enguarde the Swordfish, and Squawks the Parrot.  Unfortunately, Squawks only lights the way for you in dark levels, so you don't get to use him to fly (which also means he does not have his own bonus levels).  To fly in certain levels, you instead befriend an ostrich named Expresso. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the first three \"Sly Cooper\" games, Sly battles quite a few bosses who happen to be birds.  However, of these boss battles, only one occurs in the air.  Which of these bird villains is attacked while in flight?", "correct": "Clockwerk", "options": ["Captain LeFwee", "Arpeggio", "General Tsao"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClockwerk.\n\n\tThough birds are frequent enemies in the \"Sly Cooper\" franchise, there is, oddly enough, only one that is fought in the air.  Clockwerk, the main enemy of the first game, \"Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus\" (2002), is fought in the air in a volcano, though he is finished off on the ground.  He makes another appearance in the second game, however, when Arpeggio (a parrot in a cage), tries to rebuild the bird.  Arpeggio is never fought, however, and instead Neyla jumps inside Clockwerk to become Clockla, and another air-based battle ensues.  Captain LeFwee is fought on the sails of a ship, and General Tsao is fought in a forest and on top of sacred poles.\r Oddly enough, there is another battle that takes place in the air, but it is against a monkey who controls a giant flying whale, so no birds there. \n"}, {"text": "Spyro the Dragon, of course, can fly, and he also meets many other characters who can fly right alongside him.  One of these is Sargeant Byrd.\n\nBut what is his first name?", "correct": "James", "options": ["Cornelius", "Franklin", "Ura"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames.\n\n\tOddly enough, Sargeant James Byrd can fly, even though he is a penguin.  It is thought that this is due to the fact that he was raised, not by his own kind, but by hummingbirds.  He is a military man, complete with guns and rockets.  He first made an appearance in the \"Spyro\" franchise in the third of the series, \"Spyro: Year of the Dragon\", released in 2000. \n"}, {"text": "Back to \"Donkey Kong Country\", we meet many peculiar bosses before we reach the final boss, King K. Rool.\n\nWhich of these is a bird?", "correct": "Master Necky", "options": ["Dum Drum", "Queen B.", "Very Gnawty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaster Necky.\n\n\tIn the 1994 game \"Donkey Kong Country\", Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong meet many strange baddies, all ruled by King K. Rool, leader of the Kremlings.\r The first boss you come across is Very Gnawty, a giant green hopping beaver.  Master Necky is a pink flamingo/vulture bird thing, the second enemy you confront.  Next is Queen B, who is indeed a giant killer bee.  Then the baddies start to repeat but intensify; the next boss battle is Very Gnawty, a purple version of the same beaver from the first world.  A random barrel full of enemies is next, called Dum Drum, and then the final boss before King K. Rool is Master Necky, Sr.  He is a purple flamingo/vulture bird thing, and much more difficult than his pink counterpart.\r Oddly enough, you never see the entire body of either Master Necky or Master Necky, Sr.\r Note: coloring and other information based on the SNES version, not any of the re-releases on other consoles. \n"}, {"text": "\"Skylanders\" is a vast world, and there are dozens of playable characters besides Spyro the Dragon that you may collect to use in the games.\n\nWhich of these playable characters is a bird?", "correct": "Jet-Vac", "options": ["Flashwing", "Sunburn", "Hex"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJet-Vac.\n\n\tJet-Vac is a water-type character who first appeared in \"Skylanders: Giants\" in 2012.  He is an eagle, and though he is found in the \"Giants\" game, he is a regular-sized character.\r Flashwing is a dragon character of the earth element, and Sunburn is a fire-based dragon character.  Hex is a witch character, so she has the ability of the undead element. \n"}, {"text": "Donald Duck is a main character on the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, and, of course, he is a duck.  Though he is normally seen wearing his regular blue shirt and hat, there are a few levels where he must either wear something else or become something different.\n\nIn which of these levels is Donald Duck no longer a bird?", "correct": "Atlantica", "options": ["Hundred Acre Wood", "Halloweentown", "Pride Lands"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtlantica.\n\n\tThough Donald Duck has been around as a cartoon character for more than 65 years prior, he first made an appearance in the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series in 2002.  He is a magician in the game, a royal servant of King Mickey.  Throughout the journey, Donald Duck, along with Goofy and Sora, travel to many different Disney worlds. For the most part, he can stay the same.  However, in some places, such as Halloweentown, he changes his outfit to fit in.  He does not appear at all in Hundred Acre Wood (Sora enters this area alone), and in some places he even changes species.  In both the Pride Lands and Atlantica, Goofy becomes a turtle, but Donald becomes a seagull in Pride Lands and an Octopus in Atlantica. Of course, a bird would not have been a wise choice in an underwater world! \n"}, {"text": "In the world of the Disney, birds seem to be popular sidekicks of villains.  This is apparent in the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series.\n\nOf the villains mentioned, all but one have some sort of bird as a pet or companion, save one.  Which of them does not have such a feathered friend?", "correct": "Queen of Hearts", "options": ["Shan Yu", "Maleficent", "Jafar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen of Hearts.\n\n\tIt seems to be a theme in Disney animated films that there is a horrible villain nearby if a certain bird is seen.  These birds also make their way into the \"Kingdom Hearts\" franchise, a series that combines \"Final Fantasy\" with Disney films.  Of these birds in the series is Iago (who also appears to become good in later games), who typically is a warning of Jafar's presence, and the hawk who is a loyal pet to Shan Yu in the \"Mulan\" level.  The worst of them all, however, is Maleficent's crow, who, when spotted, is never a good sign.  Even when Maleficent was supposedly dead, the crow's sighting was a sure sign that she was not as dead as had been assumed.\r The poor Queen of Hearts, however, had no such friend.  All she had was a stack of card soldiers and a white rabbit. \n"}, {"text": "I could not possibly get away with making a quiz about video game birds without a question or two about the game birds themselves.  \"Angry Birds\" was a smash hit when it was released, and everything you could buy had an Angry Bird on it.  The game also spawned many special edition games.\n\nWhich of these listed was first?", "correct": "Angry Birds: Seasons", "options": ["Angry Birds: Rio", "Angry Birds: Star Wars", "Angry Birds: Space"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAngry Birds: Seasons.\n\n\t\"Angry Birds\" was originally released for iOS devices in 2009.  In only a few short years, the game met with such success that several sequels were created (all the options were \"Angry Birds\" games), a spin-off of the pigs was created, and just about anything you could purchase was available with \"Angry Birds\" on it; pens, mugs, pillows, underwear, microwaves, and wallets, to name a few.  The game was also brought to the console with \"Angry Birds Trilogy\" (combining \"Angry Birds\", \"Seasons\", and \"Rio\").\r The series also came to life with the release of \"Angry Birds\" board games as well as an \"Angry Birds\" film, announced in 2012 by Rovio. \n"}, {"text": "The birds of \"Angry Birds\" are sometimes known by their color: red bird, black bird, pink bird, etc.  However, they each have actual names as well (and some have had their species identified).  Which of these is the name of the white bird, who is a chicken with exploding eggs?", "correct": "Matilda", "options": ["Chuck", "Stella", "Hal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatilda.\n\n\tThe red bird is simply named red, and he is a cardinal (as well as the main bird in the series).  He simply hits things.  The blue birds, which are blue jays, split into three, whose names are Blue Jay, Blue Jim, and Blue Jake.  The yellow bird is a canary named chuck, which simply goes faster when you tap the screen.  The black bird is named Bomb, and he does just what his name suggests.  Matilda is our white bird, who happens to be a flying chicken who lays dangerous eggs.  The egg does damage, and the bird flies away; but sometimes Matilda can fly into other parts of the structure and do damage to what she hits as well.  The green bird is also called the boomerang bird, and his name is Hal (sometimes Al).  He hits things twice, because he comes back after a while (oh, and he's a toucan).  A darker red and very large bird is called Big Brother, because he is simply the larger version of Red.  His name is Terence.  The orange bird is an oriole names Bubbles, who expands after his power is activated.  Stella is the pink bird who has a relatively weak power; she creates a protective bubble around herself after she hits an object, or when you press the screen to activate it.  She's a galah.\r Of course, there are other birds found throughout the series, some that appear relatively frequently (like Blu from \"Rio\"), and others less frequently (the Philadelphia Eagle only appears in one episode). \n"}]}
