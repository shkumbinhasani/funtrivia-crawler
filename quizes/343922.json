Where did the fatal shot go?", "correct": "Through her eye", "options": ["Through her heart", "Into her spine", "Into her neck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThrough her eye.\n\n\tIn 1983, Moira makes her employer's bed while the man of the house watches from the doorway.  Walking in he attempts to sleep with her; it's clear that she doesn't want to be with him.  He holds her down on the bed and he attacks her.  The woman of the house walks down the hall and into the bedroom with a gun. As she fires at the mirror, they discover that Constance is watching them.  She expresses her frustration-- she's loved him since she was sixteen-- and she fires at Moira's face, shooting her through the eye and killing her instantly.  She shoots her husband in the chest multiple times before breaking down, crying on the bed. \n"}, {"text": "Ben suggests that Vivian's urge to leave the house is a normal symptom of which of these disorders?", "correct": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder", "options": ["Post-Partum Depression", "Acute Anxiety Disorder", "Battered Person Syndrome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\n\tIn the present time, Vivian speaks to Ben in the same bedroom; she found out about their financial issues and she says she can never trust him anymore.  It turns out that they can't move out, something she desperately needs to do after their home invasion the previous month, because all of their money is tied up in the house. She suggests renting a place-- anything to get her out-- and getting herself a job.  He says they'll find a way to get a studio apartment but she says it's not big enough.  He also says she's acting normally but she's suffering from PTSD.  Viv says that she made an appointment with the realtor in order to figure out a way they can up the value of the house to regain any money lost and if he ever lies to her again, they're through. \n"}, {"text": "Moira finds Constance in the house stealing which of these items?", "correct": "Silverware", "options": ["Crystals", "Flowers", "Earrings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilverware.\n\n\tViv speaks to Marcy, the realtor, about putting the house back up for sale and Marcy tries to change her mind, first by claiming that the housing market is too poor for them to have a chance, secondly by saying that she'd kill for a place like theirs if she could afford it.  Marcy says that Viv probably needs a newer, more experienced realtor and Viv says she tried to find one; no one will work with their house because of its history and if she doesn't, she'll sue for gross criminal negligence.\rMoira speaks to Ben in the kitchen before finding Constance in the sitting room.  Moira says she wishes Constance, who's stealing silverware, were dead, before Moira cracks under her insults.  She says she doesn't want to be there anymore and Constance says she can't find a shred of pity for her because of what she did with her husband.  Moira can't leave; there's no way for her to do it.  She says that Constance needs to pay for what she's done, but Constance says she does every day. \n"}, {"text": "After blacking out during a meeting with a patient, Ben finds that he is missing which of these?", "correct": "A recorder", "options": ["His car keys", "A notebook", "His cell phone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA recorder.\n\n\tBen's newest patient turns out to be a bore.  He sets up his recorder and she talks about her impending divorce in a certain monotony.  She says that her husband thinks she's boring.  The conversation turns out to be one-sided and he blacks out only to wake up standing outside in the yard, his hands covered in blood.  When he goes inside he finds Moira on her hands and knees scrubbing blood off the hardwood floor.  Ben goes into his office to find that Moira cleaned it already. He can't find his recorder and she keeps coming onto him.  He turns to face her, grabs her arms, and says that she's fired as Viv walks in.\rThey discuss this in the kitchen; Ben sees the younger, seductive Moira while Viv sees the older woman.  He explains that there have been too many awkward advances and Vivian is shocked at his claim.  Moira says it's okay; men see what they want to see and they objectify.  Women, however, see into the soul of a person.  Moira says that she understands their stresses and she still wants to work for them.  When Viv reasons it may be best if she left, Moira won't have this disrespect.  She says if Ben tries to fire her with unjust cause, she will press charges.  Viv suggests that perhaps Ben's indiscretion in Boston has screwed him up and that they need to leave this house without getting a lawsuit. \n"}, {"text": "Did Hayden have her abortion in Boston?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tViv heads outside to tend to the garden and gather flowers to find, to her shock, a bus from the 'Eternal Darkness Tour' passing by and calling her home \"the murder house\".\rViolet puts out a cigarette before her dad comes by and he tries to convince her to speak to someone about what happened to her the previous month.  She says she'll think about it and she thanks him.  When Ben leaves, Tate emerges from behind the wall.  He thinks she's a lucky girl.\rBen goes inside and tells Moira he needs his tape recorder; he knows she has it.  She says it might be down the front of her dress and he rebuffs her advances.  He turns away and she says his next patient is in his office.  When he notes that he didn't have anyone scheduled, he enters to find none other than Hayden.  She says she just wants to talk and he just left her alone in Boston.  She says she couldn't have the abortion-- she decided to keep their baby and she's moving to L.A. so that he can pay for and help look after their child.  She screams that she matters and the doorbell rings. \n"}, {"text": "In what decade was the Harmons' house built?", "correct": "1920s", "options": ["1900s", "1850s", "1950s"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1920s.\n\n\tBen answers the door to find a detective from the missing persons department of LAPD as Hayden departs, telling her to meet him at Norm's, a restaurant down the street, at three the next day.  Apparently Ben's newest patient, Sally Freeman, the boring woman, went missing.  Her husband hasn't seen her since the previous day.  Moira comes in while Ben discusses Sally's appointment, at least her presence there; he can't discuss too much due to doctor-patient confidentiality.  He lets himself out, but not before noting how sexy Moira is.  \"How can you get anything done with that thing around?\"\rViv takes the tour bus she saw driving by earlier, realizing that it specializes in L.A.'s most murderous spots.  The tour actually ends with 'the murder house'.  Viv stays for the story about its horrid past. \n"}, {"text": "To which of these was Charles Montgomery addicted?", "correct": "Laudanum", "options": ["Cocaine", "Opium", "Alcohol"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaudanum.\n\n\tBuilt in 1922, by Charles Montgomery for his wife, Nora, the two fell upon hard financial stresses after constructing the house leading to Charles' addiction to laudanum and what the tour guide calls 'a Frankenstein complex'.  A surgeon by trade, Charles would concoct odd experiments in the basement of the house while his relationship with Nora would disintegrate. With a newborn and their money issues, they both create a new, illegitimate business by performing secret abortions for young, aspiring movie actresses.  The tour guide emphasizes that dozens of abortions were performed in the basement. Viv is disgusted and when she looks down she realizes she's bleeding.  She runs off the bus and into the house, despite the guide's protests, for fear that there may be a problem with the baby. \n"}, {"text": "How much money does Larry ask Ben to give him?", "correct": "$1,000", "options": ["$25,000", "$20", "$500"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$1,000.\n\n\tVisiting her doctor, Viv discovers that the bleeding is a result of 'spotting'; she didn't have a miscarriage; it stopped when she went into the house.  The doctor says that she shouldn't worry, but Viv says they're planning to move.  The doctor says that moving is one of the most stressful events she could partake in and she doesn't want to have a spontaneous abortion.  Mommy should lay back so that baby can relax.  Ben, sitting next to Vivian this whole time, faints.  When he comes to, the doctor offers to run an EKG and blood panel to make sure nothing is wrong.\rAt the house, Marcy puts up the for sale sign while Constance walks by with her dogs.  Constance sees Tate in the window and pauses to wave, but he doesn't wave back.  Walking by Marcy, Constance wishes her luck selling this lemon of a house.\rBen runs through Echo Park and Larry catches up to him.  Larry wants to run lines for a show and says he needs $1,000 for headshots.  Ben tells Larry never to bother him again. \n"}, {"text": "Whose suggestion is it to build a gazebo in the Harmons' backyard?", "correct": "Constance", "options": ["Larry", "Moira", "Vivian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConstance.\n\n\tBen continues to search his office for the recorder but it doesn't turn up.  Feeling woozy, he blacks out again, waking up outside next to a shovel.  Constance's voice awakens him.  She says he won't find anything outside and she blames his stress for his blackouts-- teenage daughter, struggling business, pregnant wife-- she discourages him from digging up in the backyard since the soil is toxic and full of pesticides.  Her suggestion?  A gazebo.  Paving over the land and making a beautiful haven for himself and Vivian would be paradisaical.  Moira watches from the window.\rViv answers the door and it turns out to be a woman she doesn't know; it's Nora Montgomery.  Viv lets her in to look at the house and, to her surprise, she knows about the fixtures and decor almost as though it were her own house.  When they enter the kitchen, Nora says it's all wrong.  The modern amenities are not to her liking.  Viv never notices the gaping hole in the back of Nora's head, nor does she question when she claimed to have a child...once.  Viv turns around to grab Nora a cup of tea but when she turns back around, she's gone, almost as though she disappeared.\rThe LAPD detective returns to the house to reveal that Sally Freeman has been found, along with his recorder.  She tried to overdose on pills in a hotel.  According to the words on the recorder, Ben didn't listen to her and, in an attempt to get a rise out of him, she slit her wrists.  While she did it to herself, he didn't realize a thing, nor did he stop her. \n"}, {"text": "Whose body was found buried in the yard?", "correct": "Moira's", "options": ["Nora's", "Constance's", "Larry's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoira's.\n\n\tViv and Violet visit an apartment and talk with one another.  Violet is disappointed in her; they uprooted their lives only to shift into a tiny apartment.  Violet loves their house; it's got soul and they overcame a home invasion to survive.  Viv says she can't stay there, but Violet claims she'll run away and never be seen again if they move.\rBen receives a call from Viv's doctor-- his blood panel results came in and she claims that they contained a heavy amount of a laudanum compound.  It would explain the retrograde memory loss, but it makes no sense.  He believes Moira did it; her response: \"prove it.\"\rThe doorbell rings and Hayden, angrily, walks in having waited three hours for him to show at the restaurant.  She screams for Viv since she needs to know that Ben has other obligations.  Ben calms her down and says that they should leave and go for food.  When they leave the house, however, Larry hits Hayden in the face with a shovel, beating her to the ground and killing her.  Ben tries to kill him, but Larry says it's all a good thing; it solves the problem of explaining the baby to his wife and he's not the murderer.  Larry says to leave it to him to hide the body in the yard where he's already started digging.  As an afterthought, Larry says he could still use that $1,000.\rLarry digs Hayden's grave while Ben goes inside.  In the hole in the garden, Larry finds another body; Moira watches from the window, crying over her remains as he drops Hayden's corpse inside next to the bones.  Ben builds the gazebo, paving over the burial spot while Constance reminds Moira that she's now stuck there forever.  As Ben finishes the construction of the gazebo, he and Vivian enjoy an iced tea, just as Constance suggested.\rWhile Vivian sleeps in bed, she doesn't know she's being watched by Nora who, sitting next to her, reaches for the baby in her stomach. \n"}]}
