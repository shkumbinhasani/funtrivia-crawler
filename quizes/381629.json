Then came numerous what were termed 'high-level' programming languages to make programming accessible to people who were not specialists. Designed at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire in 1964, Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code was one of the earliest 'general-purpose' languages designed primarily for ease of use. \r With the spread of mini-computers in the early 1970s, people with relatively little training could create elementary programs using BASIC. The very first widely-available computer game, 'Pong', would seem absurdly simple to today's younger generation. At the time, though, even such a relatively simple game required thousands of lines of programming. Debugging a BASIC program was a serious undertaking, though -- just one small typo would usually cause the program to crash completely. \n"}, {"text": "Service personnel in the US, UK and Australia may be awarded the DSC for acts of extreme gallantry.
