{"id": "80258", "name": "For the \"Love\" of U2 Quiz | Music | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music T-Z", "U2"], "questions": [{"text": "Let's begin with \"Boy,\" the album that started it all. The last track, \"Shadows and Tall Trees,\" compares love to what?", "correct": "\"a tightrope hanging on my ceiling\"", "options": ["\"the street rain tragicomedy\"", "\"blindness\"", "\"the sweetest thing\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"a tightrope hanging on my ceiling\".\n\n\t\"Do you feel in me anything redeeming / Any worthwhile feeling? / Is love like a tightrope hanging from my ceiling?\" The singer laments the monotony of life (\"It's always the same\"), and the lines on love suggest he has been burned. It's a pretty song to end their debut album (released in 1980), but is nowhere near as catchy as their hit \"I Will Follow,\" which opens \"Boy.\" \n"}, {"text": "The next album - \"October\" (1981) - takes a more spiritual approach to love. The song \"Tomorrow\" describes \"the love of\" whom?", "correct": "\"He who made the blind to see\"", "options": ["\"a life made in Heaven\"", "\"The Lord. Gloria in Te domine!\"", "\"a nun to the man on the cross\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"He who made the blind to see\".\n\n\tThe last verse ends thus: \"Open up, open up, to the lamb of God / To the love of He who made the blind to see / He's coming back / He's coming back / O believe Him.\" The last three lines tie into the song's refrain (\"Won't you come back tomorrow?\"). \"October\" is a fairly spiritual album, opening with the single \"Gloria\". \r In an interview with John Waters about that song, Bono noted that after \"October,\" \"people saw that you could actually write about a woman in the spiritual sense and that you could write about God in the sexual sense. And that was a moment, because before that there had been a line.\" \n"}, {"text": "U2's third album, \"War,\" was released in 1983. One of the singles from the album, \"Two Hearts Beat as One,\" asks \"Is this love out of fashion / Or is it\" what?", "correct": "\"the time of year\"", "options": ["\"the winds and tides, this change of times\"", "\"a distraction to the songs you wanna hear\"", "\"our new elegance that makes it cold\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"the time of year\".\n\n\t\"I don't get the answers right / I'll leave that to you. / Is this love out of fashion / Or is it the time of year? / Are these words distraction / To the words you wanna hear?\" This song, written during Bono's honeymoon with his wife Alison, is a gentle addition to an album that mainly concerns strife and human suffering. I'm particularly fond of one couplet in the first verse: \"They say I'm a fool, they say I'm nothing / But if I'm a fool for you oh, that's something.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Pride (In The Name of Love),\" the first single released from \"The Unforgettable Fire,\" is widely regarded as one of U2's finest songs. To whom is it a tribute?", "correct": "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.", "options": ["Michael Hutchence", "Jesus Christ", "Aung San Suu Kyi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n\t\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" was written for the American civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose picture was displayed behind the band as they sang it in concert. It's the final verse that refers directly to him: \"Early morning, April four / Shot rings out in the Memphis sky. / Free at last, they took your life / They could not take your pride.\" Dr. King was actually murdered in the evening, not in the morning, but this anthem is a beautiful and stirring tribute.The album closes with another tribute to Dr. King, \"MLK,\" a gentle, lullaby-like dirge (\"Sleep, sleep tonight / And may your dreams be realized\") that U2 also played at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2002 in honor of the September 11 dead. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Where the Streets Have No Name,\" \"we're still building then burning down love.\" What does love become when \"the city's aflood\"?", "correct": "rust", "options": ["mud", "dust", "a joke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nrust.\n\n\tThis hit single from \"The Joshua Tree\" (March 1987 - single released that August) is very evocative, though it's difficult to pin down its meaning. The line about building and burning down love is from the chorus; the last verse includes the lyrics \"The city's aflood, our love turns to rust. / We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust./ I'll show you a place high on a desert plain / Where the streets have no name.\" In a 1987 interview with Propaganda 5, Bono said that \"I was just trying to sketch a location, maybe a spiritual location, maybe a romantic location. I was trying to sketch a feeling . . . a feeling of wanting to break out of [a] city and a feeling of wanting to go somewhere where the values of the city and the values of our society don't hold you down.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Exit,\" the underappreciated penultimate track from \"The Joshua Tree,\" is a haunting melody recounting the thoughts of an apparent suicide. In what does he want to believe?", "correct": "\"the hands of love\"", "options": ["\"a lovely day\"", "\"the power of love\"", "\"his lover's needs\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"the hands of love\".\n\n\tThe song begins very quietly - so softly that one must often turn up the volume to hear the first verse, which ends with \"He wanted to believe / In the hands of love.\" By the last verse, it has crescendoed to a normal volume: \r\"Hand in the pocket\rFinger on the steel\rThe pistol weighed heavy\rHis heart he could feel\rWas beating, beating\rBeating, beating oh my love\rOh my love, oh my love\rOh my love\" \rNot the most cheerful of songs, but a very powerful one. \n"}, {"text": "The plaintive \"Love Rescue Me\" includes one memorable verse that's based on a famous Biblical psalm. Which psalm is it?", "correct": "Psalm 23", "options": ["Psalm 100", "Psalm 18", "Psalm 43"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPsalm 23.\n\n\tThe verse, two thirds of the way through a song describing how a desperate person now relies on love to bring his life meaning, is \"Yea, though I walk / In the valley of the shadow / Yet I will fear no evil. / I have cursed thy rod and staff / They no longer comfort me. / Love, rescue me.\" The song is the eleventh track on the 1988 album \"Rattle and Hum.\" \n"}, {"text": "Think about the single \"When Love Comes To Town,\" also from \"Rattle and Hum.\" The video features a guest singer, for whom the song was written. Who is this musical legend?", "correct": "B. B. King", "options": ["Johnny Cash", "Chuck Berry", "Dizzy Gillespie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nB. B. King\n\n\tSaid the Edge to Q Magazine in 1998: \"Bono and I met B.B. King in Dublin and he said, Hey, you guys should write me a song. We said, Ah, yeah. I thought it was unlikely but a while later Bono said, 'Remember B.B. King? Well I've done this song' . . . We decided to use it on 'Rattle and Hum' and asked B.B. if he'd join us.\" \"When Love Comes To Town\" is a catchy tune describing the change in a man's life as he experiences love for the first time: \"Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down / But I did what I did before love came to town.\" This song also continues U2's tradition of religious imagery, with a verse referring to Jesus's death and resurrection: \"I was there when they crucified my Lord . . . But I've seen love conquer the great divide.\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"All I Want Is You,\" the last track on \"Rattle and Hum,\" the singer describes the wishes and promises of his beloved. What does she want her love to do?", "correct": "\"to work out right\"", "options": ["\"to drive a highway with no one on it\"", "\"to leave this heart of clay\"", "\"to turn to rust\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"to work out right\".\n\n\t\"You say you want your love to work out right / To last with me through the night.\" This beautiful song was, according to the official website (u2.com), inspired by a coda that the Edge added to \"With or Without You.\" I am always moved by the chorus, sung softly and sweetly: \"All the promises we make, from the cradle to the grave / When all I want is you\" - and I freely confess that it has special meaning to me, since it was my first slow dance with the man I later married. :-) \n"}, {"text": "Let's move on to \"Achtung Baby\" (1991). In \"Even Better Than the Real Thing,\" the singer begs for what?", "correct": "\"Give me one more chance, let me be your lover tonight.\"", "options": ["\"Diamonds on a ring of gold / Your story to remain untold.\"", "\"All that you can't leave behind\"", "\"To live like it's the last night on Earth.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Give me one more chance, let me be your lover tonight.\"\n\n\t\"Give me one more chance, and you'll be satisfied. / Give me two more chances, you won't be denied. / Well, my heart is where it's always been / My head is somewhere in between / Give me one more chance, let me be your lover tonight.\" The singer assures his prospective lover that \"You're the real thing, Yeah the real thing . . . Even better than the real thing.\" It's a fast-paced, intoxicating take on love, though it focuses on physical, not emotional, attachment. It was released as a single in June 1992. \n"}, {"text": "The very next track on \"Achtung Baby\" - \"One\" - is a haunting tune about love growing hollow and bitter. In the first verse, the singer declares, \"You say one love, one life, when it's\" really what?", "correct": "\"one need in the night\"", "options": ["\"one road to strife\"", "\"a bad taste in your mouth\"", "\"one mortgage, all right\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"one need in the night\".\n\n\tAnd the song goes on . . . \"You say love is a temple, love a higher law . . . You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl. / And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt.\" The conclusion: \"One life, but we're not the same. / We get to carry each other, carry each other. / One, one.\" It's a beautiful song, but completely inappropriate for the wedding receptions where it's often played. \n"}, {"text": "According to the last track on \"Achtung Baby,\" what is love?", "correct": "\"Love is blindness.\"", "options": ["\"Love is holding a pencil.\"", "\"Love is a ride on your carousel.\"", "\"Love is all you need.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Love is blindness.\"\n\n\t\"Love is blindness, I don't want to see / Won't you wrap the night around me? / Oh my heart, love is blindness. / Love is clockworks and cold steel / Fingers too numb to feel. / Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle / Love is blindness.\" Slow, melancholy, and haunting, \"Love Is Blindness\" is a beautiful close to the album. \n"}, {"text": "\"I have a lover, a lover like no other,\" Bono sings on the third-to-last track of \"Zooropa\" (1993). \"She ... gives me hope when I can't believe / That __________, I feel love.\" Finish the lyric.", "correct": "for the first time", "options": ["while she's by me", "in my dream's end", "when I go running"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfor the first time.\n\n\tThe song, a gentle, slow-moving ballad, is \"The First Time.\" Romantic love is only one of its subjects; it also refers to paternal love, the love of God, and brotherly love. \"I have a brother, when I'm a brother in need / I spend my whole time running / He spends his running after me ... For the first time, I feel love.\" The guitar work is understated and beautiful. \n"}, {"text": "The second track on \"Pop\" (1997), sung deep and low with a compelling rhythm, is a bit of a musical striptease after the more exuberant \"Discoth\u00e8que.\" What is its title?", "correct": "Do You Feel Loved?", "options": ["The Playboy Mansion", "If You Wear That Velvet Dress", "Dirty Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDo You Feel Loved?.\n\n\t\"You got my head filled with songs / You got my shoelaces undone. / Take my shirt, go on, take it off me / You can tear it up if you can tie me down. / Do you feel loved?\" \n"}, {"text": "\"If God Would Send His Angels,\" a plaintive track from \"Pop,\" asks what sarcastic question about love?", "correct": "\"Does love light up your Christmas tree?\"", "options": ["\"Will love save you from the world?\"", "\"Well, where's your lover now?\"", "\"Will love fix the snow on your old T.V.?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Does love light up your Christmas tree?\".\n\n\tThe song, released as a single in December 1997, laments the sorry state of the world: \"Nobody here taking orders / When love took a train heading south ... It's the blind leading the blond / It's the cops collecting for the cons. / So where is the hope and where is the faith and the love? / What's that you say to me? / Does love light up your Christmas tree? ... And if God would send his angels / And if God would send a sign ...\" It's dark, it's bitter, it's agnostic, and it's the only song on this great 1997 album that harkens back to U2's 1980s style. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Please,\" the singer caps a long litany of faults - most traceable to egotism - when he sings \"So love is hard, and love is tough. But love is not . . .\" what?", "correct": "what you're thinking of", "options": ["what I could believe", "so one-way, dove", "bigger than us"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwhat you're thinking of.\n\n\tAs he sings a few lines later, no matter what else was going on in the world, \"you could only feel your own pain.\" Though the lyrics are very personal, the video and presentation suggest that it is meant as a general plea to human beings to wake up and stop their suffering. \"Please, please, please get up off your knees ... Your holy war, your northern star / Your sermon on the mount from the boot of your car.\" \"Please,\" one of my favorite songs, was released as a single in September 1997, and is the penultimate track on the album \"Pop.\" The Edge called it \"the most intricate piece of music we've ever done.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"The Sweetest Thing,\" the only new single released from the greatest hits album \"Best of 1980-1990\" (1998), was written for whom?", "correct": "Bono's wife, Ali", "options": ["The Edge's wife, Morleigh", "Larry's girlfriend, Ann", "Adam's mother, Jo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBono's wife, Ali.\n\n\tAccording to The Edge (in \"Q Magazine\"): \"Bono wrote it as a birthday present for Ali. When we recorded 'The Joshua Tree' we liked it, but it was her song so it was different from the rest. Afterwards we realised it should have been on the album.\" A hit release only a decade late, the song describes the pain that goes with love: \"I know I got black eyes / But they burn so brightly for her / I guess it's a blind kind of love. / (Oh, the sweetest thing.)\" \n"}, {"text": "The second disk in the limited edition of \"Best of 1980-1990\" - \"B-Sides\" - includes a stirring cover of what song, written in 1967 by Mac Gayden and Buzz Cason, assuring us that \"this love will last forever\"?", "correct": "\"Everlasting Love\"", "options": ["\"Dancing Barefoot\"", "\"Love Comes Tumbling\"", "\"Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Everlasting Love\".\n\n\t\"Everlasting Love\" was a 1968 hit for the band Love Affair. U2's version was first released as one of the B-sides to the 1989 single \"All I Want Is You\". It's a plea to reclaim an abandoned love. \"Hearts gone astray / Keeping up when they go / I went away / Just when you needed me so / You won't regret it / I'll come back begging you. / Don't you forget, welcome love we once knew ... Whenever love went wrong / Ours would still be strong / We'd have our own / Everlasting love ...\" \n"}, {"text": "In October 2000, U2 staged a comeback of sorts: after mixed reviews for \"Zooropa\" and \"Pop,\" their previous two new albums, they released \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" to the praise and adulation of pretty much everybody. Track 7 on that album, \"Wild Honey,\" demands \"What is soul? / Love me, give me soul.\" The singer is describing a long-ago era - a past life - in which he and his beloved were what?", "correct": "monkeys", "options": ["dogs", "medieval Bohemian peasants", "trumpeter swans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmonkeys.\n\n\t\"In the days when we were swinging from the trees / I was a monkey stealing honey from a swarm of bees ... Did I know you? / Did I know you even then? / Before the clocks kept time / Before the world was made.\" It's a joyful song with some wonderful imagery: \"Are you still growing wild / With everything tame around you?\" \n"}, {"text": "We'll leave the final word to \"Walk On,\" a single from \"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\" In a half-speaking voice before the music begins, Bono tells us \"Love is not the easy thing.\" Why?", "correct": "\"The only baggage you can bring is all that you can't leave behind.\"", "options": ["\"Love is blindness.\"", "\"The only suitcase you can bring is all that you've been dreaming of.\"", "\"You're stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The only baggage you can bring is all that you can't leave behind.\"\n\n\t\"Walk On\" was dedicated to Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her struggles against the military junta ruling Burma (Myanmar). As Bono described her in an interview with Sonicnet.com: \"She left the comfort of her home in Oxford, as an academic, and her family and her son and her husband, and went to do the right thing for her people.And it was just one of the great acts of courage in the 20th century . . . At first, I was writing it from the point of view of her family . . . and then in the end I kept it a little abstract and just let it be a love song about somebody having to leave a relationship for the right reasons.\" The song itself is (in my opinion, anyway) a masterpiece of poetry and beauty: \"You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been / A place that has to be believed to be seen . . . And I know it aches, and your heart it breaks, and you can only take so much / Walk on, walk on.\" This quiz was a pleasure to write, and I hope you've enjoyed it too. \n"}]}
