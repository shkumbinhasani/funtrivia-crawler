Quiz | Science for Kids | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "Science for Kids", "Space and Astronomy for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "The word 'astrophysics' is based on Greek words. Do you know which of these bodies 'astro' translates to?", "correct": "Star", "options": ["Sun", "Moon", "Planet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar.\n\n\tAstrophysics is a word that comes from the Greek. Astro means star, and physics comes from the Greek word physis, which means nature. \n"}, {"text": "Some astrophysicists study about the luminosity of stars. What other word could you use to describe luminosity?", "correct": "Brightness", "options": ["Energy", "Size", "Color"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrightness.\n\n\tAstrophysicists study a lot of things about space. One of the things they learn about is the luminosity of stars. Luminosity is a word at means brightness. That means that a star that is very luminous is very bright. \n"}, {"text": "One theory in astrophysics is one about the creation of the universe. Many scientists believe that a small, dense mass blew up and expanded, thus creating the universe. Some believe it is still expanding. What is this theory popularly known as?", "correct": "Big Bang Theory", "options": ["String Theory", "Relativity Theory", "Theory of a Dead Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig Bang Theory.\n\n\tAccording to many scientists, the universe began billions of years ago as a small, very dense, ball of energy. It is widely believed that this ball blew up, and expanded into the universe. Some think the universe is still expanding. \n"}, {"text": "Scientists who study astrophysics might also learn about the chemical composition of planets. Which of these planets could you not stand on because it is mostly gas?", "correct": "Jupiter", "options": ["Mars", "Venus", "Mercury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJupiter.\n\n\tJupiter is one of four \"gas giants\" in the solar system. What that means is that there is no hard surface to stand on. The planet is made up of a giant ball of gas, as is Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. You could easily stand on Mars, Mercury, or Venus. Of course, the atmospheres on those planets might be full of gases that make you unable to breathe, but you could still stand on them. Scientists do not even know if there is a solid core to some of these gas giants. They can't reach inside the planet to find out! \n"}, {"text": "Astrophysicists sometimes study about the temperature of stars. Which of these stars would be the hottest?", "correct": "Blue star", "options": ["Yellow star", "Red star", "White star"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue star.\n\n\tStars are giant balls of energy, and the surface temperature (and therefore the color that we see) is affected by how much energy that star contains. A huge, blue star has a lot of energy inside the core, which creates a lot of heat on the outside. However, these stars use so much energy so quickly that they do not last nearly as long as the colder, redder stars. These emit very low amounts of energy, so, though they are a bit cooler than blue stars, they also last much longer. \n"}, {"text": "Scientists who study astrophysics are also sometimes interested in the density of planets.  Density relates to both mass and weight. Which of these planets, known for its rings, is the least dense, and would float in water?", "correct": "Saturn", "options": ["Neptune", "Pluto", "Uranus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaturn.\n\n\tWater has a density of one. Anything with a density greater than one will sink in water, and anything with a lower density will float. Saturn has a density of less than 0.7, so it will float in water. \n"}, {"text": "Astrophysicists sometimes study galaxies. The word \"galaxy\" comes from the Greek, a word meaning what?\n\nHINT: Thinking of our own galaxy might help.", "correct": "Milky", "options": ["Starry", "Spiral", "Universe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilky.\n\n\tThe Greek word for galaxy is \"galaxias\", which actually means 'milky'. The word is in direct reference to the galaxy we live in; the Milky Way Galaxy. \n"}, {"text": "Some astrophysicists like to study about the death of stars. When certain types of stars get too old, they do not have enough energy to sustain their own gravity, and then collapses. What might appear in the place of a collapsed star?", "correct": "Black hole", "options": ["Sink hole", "Hole in the space/time continuum", "Star hole"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack hole.\n\n\tA black hole is something in space that has such strong gravity that nothing can escape, not even light. Even though a black hole has such intense gravity, which crushes everything inside, some black holes are actually not very dense; and would float on water! \n"}, {"text": "An astrophysicist might study the sun. He could tell you that the sun is so big that over one million earths can fit inside of it. That means the sun is extremely large.\n\nIs our sun the largest star in the universe?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe Sun is not even close to being the largest star. In fact, it is actually quite a small star. The largest known star is VY Canis Majoris. This star is so large that a total of 9,200,000,000 (over nine BILLION) suns can fit inside of it. \n"}, {"text": "Astrophysics also sometimes deals with moons. Earth has one moon, which is named Luna. Which of these moons belongs to Saturn?", "correct": "Titan", "options": ["Ganymede", "Europa", "Io"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTitan.\n\n\tTitan is the largest of Saturn's known moons (and there are at least 60). It is not, however, the largest known moon of any planet in our solar system, as Ganymede is larger. Ganymede, Io, and Europa all belong to Jupiter. \n"}]}
