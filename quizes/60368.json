{"id": "60368", "name": "Famous Firsts In 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' Quiz | Television | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Star Trek Universe", "Star Trek: The Next Generation"], "questions": [{"text": "We met the Borg for the first time in the second-season episode 'Q Who.' Who was the first person in the episode to actually say the word 'Borg'?", "correct": "Guinan", "options": ["Deanna Troi", "Q", "One of the Borg drones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuinan.\n\n\tAs the enormous cubical ship is seen for the first time, Picard asks Guinan if she can identify its origin. She explains that the alien race inside the cube call themselves the Borg. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first crewmember to encounter a Borg in the flesh in 'Q Who'?", "correct": "La Forge", "options": ["Data", "Worf", "Riker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLa Forge.\n\n\tA Borg drone -- the first one ever seen on 'ST:TNG' -- materializes in Engineering right before the eyes (well, VISOR) of Lieutenant Geordi La Forge. \n"}, {"text": "The very first time we see a Trill (in the fourth season episode 'The Host'), who is the only crewmember in the scene with him or her?", "correct": "Dr. Crusher", "options": ["Picard", "Data", "Deanna Troi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Crusher\n\n\t'The Host' opens with a scene depicting Beverly Crusher and Odan, her new Trill lover, sharing an intimate moment in the turbolift. \n"}, {"text": "In which season did we learn the name of Guinan's race and home world?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["Second", "Fifth", "Third"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tGuinan's race is never named during the series -- all she ever says is, 'We've been called a race of listeners.' It wasn't until the 1994 theatrical release 'Star Trek: Generations' that we hear Beverly Crusher identify Guinan's (and Dr. Tolian Soran's) race as El-Aurian...which is probably a play on words, since 'auris' is Latin for 'ear.' A race of listeners. Get it? \n"}, {"text": "It's been made clear via backstory that Jean-Luc Picard was quite the ladies' man in his youth; nonetheless, as far as we know, he enjoyed no sexual relations of any kind during the first season of the show. In which season did Captain Picard first have a sexual encounter?", "correct": "Third", "options": ["Fifth", "Second", "Fourth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThird.\n\n\tQuite unlike Captain Kirk, huh? Picard's first (shown) lover was Vash, a smuggler of sorts he met in the third season episode 'Captain's Holiday.' I don't recall Kirk going without female companionship for more than three episodes, much less three years! \n"}, {"text": "True or False: Ensign Ro Laren was the first Bajoran ever seen on 'ST:TNG.'", "correct": "true & t & yes & y", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ntrue & t & yes & y.\n\n\tThe Bajorans were shown for the first time in the fifth season episode 'Ensign Ro,' and Ro Laren herself was the first member of that race to appear on screen. \n"}, {"text": "Not counting Chief O'Brien or Worf, who was the first regular 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' character to make an appearance on 'TNG'?", "correct": "Dr. Julian Bashir", "options": ["Quark", "Commander Benjamin Sisko", "Lieutenant Jadzia Dax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Julian Bashir\n\n\tBashir made the acquaintance of Data and La Forge in the sixth season episode 'Birthright, Part I.' Quark was the only other 'DS9' denizen to show up on 'TNG,' and that was in the seventh season's 'Firstborn.' \n"}, {"text": "Which crewmember's parent or parents did we meet first?", "correct": "Deanna Troi's mother", "options": ["Will Riker's father", "Worf's adoptive parents", "Geordi La Forge's father"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeanna Troi's mother.\n\n\tWe've seen everyone mentioned above, but Lwaxana Troi was the first to make an appearance, in the first season episode 'Haven.' \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the first season, the chief engineer position aboard the ENTERPRISE seemed to rotate from one minor character to another. Who was the first person named as chief engineer in the first season of 'ST:TNG'?", "correct": "Sarah MacDougal", "options": ["Jeff Argyle", "Jim Shimoda", "Gary Logan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSarah MacDougal.\n\n\tArgyle and Logan (whose first names I made up for this question, as they were never stated on the show) both held the chief engineer slot at certain times, but Sarah MacDougal was the first to be identified as the chief engineer, in the first season episode 'The Naked Now' -- the same episode in which Jim Shimoda was identified as the assistant chief. \n"}, {"text": "A number of characters from the original 'Star Trek' series (1966-1969) have appeared on 'ST: TNG.' Which of them was the first to do so?", "correct": "McCoy & Bones & Dr. McCoy & Doctor McCoy & Mc Coy & Dr. Bones McCoy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMcCoy & Bones & Dr. McCoy & Doctor McCoy & Mc Coy & Dr. Bones McCoy\n\n\tWe've seen Spock, Sarek, and Scotty make appearances...but McCoy has them all beat, since he appeared in the very first episode, 'Encounter at Farpoint.' \n"}, {"text": "Which crewmember was the first to be promoted in rank officially?", "correct": "Geordi La Forge", "options": ["Beverly Crusher", "Deanna Troi", "Wesley Crusher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeordi La Forge.\n\n\tIt happened off-screen, but Geordi was a Lieutenant at the end of the second season and a Lieutenant Commander at the start of the third.  (Funtrivia player soong also informs me that Geordi went from a Lieutenant Junior Grade in season 1 to a full Lieutenant in season 2.) Wesley held the very unofficial rank of 'Acting Ensign' the first couple of seasons, but received an official promotion to full Ensign near the end of season three.Deanna Troi received a promotion to the rank of Commander in the seventh season episode 'Thine Own Self.' Beverly's had three full pips (Commander's rank) on her collar since the series premiere. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first crewmember to be hugged onscreen by Captain Picard?", "correct": "Dr. Katherine Pulaski", "options": ["Dr. Beverly Crusher", "Deanna Troi", "Wesley Crusher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Katherine Pulaski\n\n\tAt the end of the second season episode 'Unnatural Selection,' Picard is so happy that Dr. Pulaski has survived her mission that he gives her a big hug the second she steps off the transporter platform. I about fell out of my chair, since Picard is not what one would call a demonstrative man. In later seasons, Picard threw an arm around Beverly once in a while, but that was well after the incident with Dr. Pulaski. \n"}, {"text": "In which first season episode was Captain James T. Kirk's name first spoken?", "correct": "'The Naked Now'", "options": ["'Haven'", "'Encounter at Farpoint'", "'Code of Honor'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Naked Now'.\n\n\tFitting, since in 'The Naked Now' the crew is exposed to the same intoxicating virus that plagued Kirk's crew in the original 'Star Trek' episode 'The Naked Time.' And for the record, Picard is the one who speaks Kirk's name, as he's reading aloud from some old logs pertaining to the virus. \n"}, {"text": "In which fifth season episode did Captain Picard's new 'leather jacket' uniform make its first appearance?", "correct": "'Darmok'", "options": ["'Silicon Avatar'", "'Ensign Ro'", "'Disaster'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Darmok'.\n\n\tOne of my favorite episodes, as it centers around both lingusitics and mythology. And MAN, but that jacket was cool. \n"}, {"text": "Jonathan Frakes directed several episodes of 'ST:TNG,' not to mention the theatrical releases 'Star Trek: First Contact' and 'Star Trek: Insurrection.' What was the first episode of 'ST:TNG' that he directed?", "correct": "'The Offspring'", "options": ["'A Matter Of Perspective'", "'The High Ground'", "'Sins Of the Father'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Offspring'.\n\n\tThis third season episode featured Data's 'daughter' Lal, an android he constructed. There's a note in Picard's opening log stating that Riker is away on a mission, to account for Frakes' being too busy directing to act in the episode! Riker makes a brief, hilarious appearance in Ten Forward, and then is never seen again in the episode. \n"}, {"text": "Commander William Riker has been offered several ships to command during his career, and he never accepted a single one of them during the run of 'ST:TNG.' What was the first starship he declined to command?", "correct": "The USS DRAKE", "options": ["The USS ARIES", "The USS MELBOURNE", "The USS YAMATO"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe USS DRAKE.\n\n\tWe learn in the first season episode 'The Arsenal of Freedom' that Riker was offered captaincy of the DRAKE, but he turned it down in order to serve on the Federation flagship. He was offered the ARIES in the second season episode 'The Icarus Factor,' and the MELBOURNE in the third season finale 'The Best Of Both Worlds, Part I' -- he accepted neither offer, of course. The YAMATO was the ENTERPRISE's sister ship that was destroyed in the second season episode 'Contagion,' but there's never been a mention of Riker having been offered that particular command. \n"}, {"text": "The first time we ever hear Riker introduce himself as 'Captain William Riker,' what ship is he commanding?", "correct": "The Klingon cruiser PAGH", "options": ["The USS HATHAWAY", "The USS ENTERPRISE", "He has never done this."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Klingon cruiser PAGH.\n\n\tIn the second season episode 'A Matter Of Honor,' Riker serves as first officer aboard the PAGH as part of an officer exchange program. Riker eventually kicks the captain out of his chair and takes over the ship in order to save the ENTERPRISE. He then hails Picard and company and introduces himself as 'Captain William Riker, of the Klingon vessel PAGH.' Riker would later identify himself as the captain of both the HATHAWAY (in 'Peak Performance') and the ENTERPRISE (in 'The Best Of Both Worlds, Part II')...but 'A Matter Of Honor' came first. \n"}, {"text": "Several performers from 'L.A. Law' have appeared on 'ST:TNG.' Diana Muldaur was the first 'L.A. Law' actor to appear as which 'ST:TNG' character?", "correct": "Dr. Katherine Pulaski", "options": ["Dr. Kerry Weaver", "Dr. Allison Cameron", "Dr. Miranda Bailey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Katherine Pulaski\n\n\tDiana Muldaur played Rosalind Shays on 'L.A. Law,' and Dr. Katherine Pulaski in the second season of 'ST:TNG.' Corbin Bernsen, who played Arnie Becker on 'L.A. Law,' played 'Q2' on 'ST:TNG,' but not until the third season's 'Deja Q.' Jennifer Hetrick, 'L.A. Law's Corrine Hammond, didn't show up as Vash until the third season episode 'Captain's Holiday.' \r Alan Rachins, Douglas Brackman on 'L.A. Law,' never appeared on 'ST:TNG.'\rDr. Cameron was played by Jennifer Morrison on the series \"House\", Dr. Weaver by Laura Innes on \"ER\", and Dr. Bailey by Chandra Wilson on \"Grey's Anatomy\". \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first person (besides Captain Picard) to refer to Will Riker as 'Number One'?", "correct": "Admiral Mark Jameson", "options": ["Captain Edward Jellico", "Counselor Deanna Troi", "Lt. Commander Data"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdmiral Mark Jameson.\n\n\tAdmiral Jameson makes himself mighty comfortable on the bridge of the ENTERPRISE during his ambassadorial mission in the first season episode 'Too Short a Season,' even going so far as to call Will 'Number One,' as Picard does.  \r Funtrivia player kazzy67 has reminded me that Sarek called Will \"Number One\" after his mind-meld with Picard in the third season episode \"Sarek\". \n"}, {"text": "In which first season episode do we see the ENTERPRISE's self-destruct system activated for the first time?", "correct": "'11001001'", "options": ["'When the Bough Breaks'", "'Home Soil'", "'Angel One'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'11001001'.\n\n\tWhen the Bynars hijack the ENTERPRISE with only Picard and Riker on board, they opt to destroy the ship rather than let it fall into alien hands. Fortunately, a peaceful solution is eventually reached, and the countdown is aborted. \r A much more dramatic employment -- and last-second deactivation -- of the self-destruct system occurred in season two's 'Where Silence Has Lease.' \n"}, {"text": "We learn in 'Datalore' that Lt. Commander Data has a manual 'off' switch. Who was the first person to whom he revealed this fact?", "correct": "Beverly Crusher", "options": ["Lore", "Geordi La Forge", "Jean-Luc Picard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeverly Crusher.\n\n\tCrusher: 'You've never mentioned this before, Data.' Data: 'Doctor...if you had an 'off' switch, would *you* tell anyone?' \n"}, {"text": "In which first season episode did we first meet the Ferengi?", "correct": "'The Last Outpost'", "options": ["'Where No One Has Gone Before'", "'Encounter at Farpoint'", "'Justice'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Last Outpost'.\n\n\tArmin Shimmerman played one of the Ferengi soldiers in this episode, and years later would play Quark, everyone's favorite Ferengi bartender, on 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.' \n"}, {"text": "Wesley Crusher left the ENTERPRISE for Starfleet Academy in the fourth season episode 'Final Mission.' Which fifth season episode marked the first time we saw *Cadet* Wesley Crusher?", "correct": "'The Game'", "options": ["'Disaster'", "'A Matter of Time'", "'New Ground'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Game'.\n\n\tWesley returns to the ENTERPRISE just in time to save its crew from a mind-altering VR game that enslaves all who play it. Wesley also finds time for romance with Ensign Robin Lefler, played by -- ready? -- Ashley Judd. Ah, the early years. \n"}, {"text": "Starfleet uniforms underwent an overhaul at one point -- the zippered-up-the-front jumpsuits (with thin piping cutting into the black material covering the shoulders) was replaced by the two-piece uniform with a tunic that zipped up in the back and had a raised collar (and no piping). In which episode did we see these new uniforms for the first time?", "correct": "'Evolution'", "options": ["'Redemption II'", "'The Ensigns of Command'", "'The Best of Both Worlds, Part II'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Evolution'.\n\n\t'Evolution,' the third series opener, was the first aired episode featuring the new uniforms. 'The Ensigns of Command' was actually the first third season episode to be shot, but for some reason 'Evolution' aired first. \n"}, {"text": "And finally, another stickler: what was the first episode of 'ST:TNG' that featured *no* scenes on the bridge of the ENTERPRISE?", "correct": "'Family'", "options": ["'The Most Toys'", "'Skin of Evil'", "'The Inner Light'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Family'.\n\n\tThe fourth season episode 'Family' was a quiet epilogue of sorts to the slam-bang 'Best of Both Worlds,' set mostly on Earth and Starbase 1 (which orbits Earth). There were a few scenes aboard the ENTERPRISE (which was undergoing massive repairs at Starbase 1), but none aboard the bridge. \n"}]}
