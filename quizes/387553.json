{"id": "387553", "name": "What's Up, Doctor? Quiz | Doctor Who | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Doctor Who", "'Dr Who' - The Doctors"], "questions": [{"text": "The very first Doctor debuted onscreen in 1963.  He was played by which of these actors?", "correct": "William Hartnell", "options": ["William Russell", "Peter Cushing", "Peter Purves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Hartnell.\n\n\tHartnell debuted the character in 1963 and held onto the role into 1966, taking on the second-longest tenure of the first dozen Doctors with one hundred thirty-four episodes over twenty-nine stories.  Unlike many of the Doctors proceeding him, a number of his episodes are not able to be watched due to the deletion of archived programmes at the BBC; you can't watch dozens of missing \"Doctor Who\" adventures, most of which happened during Hartnell's time in the role (though many in his successor's as well).  At the end of Hartnell's run as the Doctor, he beat the Cybermen and regenerated in Antarctica. \n"}, {"text": "What actor, donning a black stovepipe hat, portrayed the Second Doctor from 1966 to 1969?", "correct": "Patrick Troughton", "options": ["Michael Craze", "Frazer Hines", "Nicholas Courtney"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatrick Troughton.\n\n\tAfter the First Doctor regenerated into his second form, he took on a completely new personality and wardrobe filled in by actor Patrick Troughton who, over four years, played the role in one hundred nineteen episodes spread across twenty-one stories, most of which were lost due to the BBC archive purge.  Nonetheless, Troughton posed for a new era of the show, one in which the Doctor role took on a less strict position.  His Doctor was noticeably younger than Hartnell's in both physicality and mentality.  In later years, proceeding Doctors have gone on to cite him as one of their favourites. \n"}, {"text": "Later starring in \"Worzel Gummidge\", who played the Third Doctor for the first half of the 1970s?", "correct": "Jon Pertwee", "options": ["John Levene", "Richard Franklin", "Ian Marter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJon Pertwee.\n\n\tJon Pertwee took up the mantle from Troughton when the Second Doctor was forced by the Time Lords to regenerate and take exile on Earth.  This Third Doctor was more eccentric than the second, donning a cape.  He also had a tendency to get his hands dirtier when fighting his foes.  This was the first run of shows in the series to be broadcast in colour, showing that his tastes were a bit regal in nature. Pertwee would play the Doctor role from 1970 to mid-1974 at which point he regenerates after a battle with the Spider Queen of Metebelis Three.  He appeared in one hundred twenty-eight episodes in twenty-four stories. \n"}, {"text": "The Fourth Doctor had the longest run of any of the Doctors (in one hundred seventy-two episodes).  Who played Doctor Who for nearly seven years?", "correct": "Tom Baker", "options": ["John Leeson", "David Brierley", "Matthew Waterhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Baker.\n\n\tTom Baker took the Doctor and made it his own in one of the most memorable incarnations of the heroic Time Lord.  Donning a long jacket and a colourful, too-long scarf, Baker's Doctor was distinctive for his appearance and temperament, especially since he was the youngest Doctor to date and the most zany.  Baker would return for many specials over the years of the show, even into its more modern incarnations, though his last episode, after forty-one stories, was in the episode \"Logopolis\" in 1981. \n"}, {"text": "The Fifth Doctor, known for being the youngest of the original serials, was played by what Shakespearean actor?", "correct": "Peter Davison", "options": ["James Warwick", "Gerald Flood", "Andrew Sachs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter Davison.\n\n\tDavison was the first in the line of Doctors to have extensive theatrical experience before hitting the airwaves, having appeared in numerous Shakespeare productions throughout the 1970s and then gaining the Fifth Doctor role in 1981.  He would be the youngest Doctor until Matt Smith (the Eleventh), only being 32 when he got the role.  Davison appeared in twenty stories over only sixty-nine episodes, only being the Doctor for three years, before his Doctor, exposed to a deadly drug, chose to save his companion at the time and regenerate into his next form. \n"}, {"text": "Considered one of the brashest Doctors, the brightly-coloured Sixth Doctor was played by which actor for a total of three years?", "correct": "Colin Baker", "options": ["Michael Jayston", "Tony Selby", "Anthony Ainley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColin Baker.\n\n\tBaker's Sixth Doctor, unlike his predecessors, was a bit more prone to violence, and this concerning trait didn't go over too well with BBC and viewers.  As such, Baker had one of the shortest tenures of any of the first dozen Doctors taking to the screen in only thirty-one episodes (in eight stories) due to a year-and-a-half-long hiatus. It was likely for the best; the Sixth Doctor needed retooling due to his abrasive ego.  Baker was let go from the role in \"The Trial of a Time Lord\" in 1986 and due to his refusal to film a regeneration scene, his transformation into the Seventh Doctor's form was implied between series. \n"}, {"text": "The Seventh Doctor, considered manipulative but who protested violence, was played by which actor for two years?", "correct": "Sylvester McCoy", "options": ["Donald Pickering", "Mark Greenstreet", "Peter Tuddenham"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSylvester McCoy.\n\n\tIn an effort to fix the damages done by having a Doctor who was too dangerous and violent in his sixth form, the BBC seemed to have sway in tempering McCoy's Doctor, the seventh to appear in the succession, because he ended up opposing violent tendencies, instead being a bit more skilled in mind games and psychological battle.  McCoy, who later appeared in Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\" trilogy in the 2010s, filled this role for the final years of the 1980s, appearing in twelve stories over forty-two episodes.  The show ended with a cancellation in 1989. \n"}, {"text": "Appearing in only one episode (a TV film), the short-lived Eighth Doctor was a role played by which actor?", "correct": "Paul McGann", "options": ["Eric Roberts", "Rowan Atkinson", "John Novak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaul McGann.\n\n\tMcGann's Eighth Doctor faced off against The Master, and only once, when he appeared in a television movie in 1996, meant to be a spark to the \"Doctor Who\" franchise to pull it out of its cancellation.  It didn't really work; the show didn't return to the BBC in full until 2005.  Nonetheless, canonically, McGann was the Eighth Doctor, regardless of the short time onscreen for this Canadian-filmed, almost all-American cast TV movie which wasn't popular enough to warrant a full-fledged return. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first Doctor of the rebooted \"Doctor Who\" series (making him the Ninth overall), taking the role in 2005 for a single year?", "correct": "Christopher Eccleston", "options": ["Bruno Langley", "John Barrowman", "Noel Clarke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristopher Eccleston.\n\n\tSpurring the success of the reboot, Eccleston played a stern Doctor who, in his short-lived adventures with companion Rose Tyler, brought his Ninth Doctor to a new era on the BBC.  Appearing in only thirteen episodes, Eccleston's Doctor didn't have the eccentricities of his predecessors who, in occasionally garish outfits and with notable quirks, made the character almost whimsical on occasion.  Instead, the sharper, darker Doctor sparked a new direction for the series as a whole.  Eccleston, of course, had a long career in cinema before and after his year on \"Doctor Who\". \n"}, {"text": "The Tenth Doctor, leading the TARDIS through three seasons between 2005 and 2010, was which of the following actors who, for most of his time in the role, sported a pinstripe suit?", "correct": "David Tennant", "options": ["Bernard Cribbins", "David Morrissey", "Julian Bleach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Tennant.\n\n\tThe Tenth Doctor, regarded by many polls and fans as one of the most generally well-liked Doctors of all time, was portrayed by Shakespearean actor David Tennant who, in the years after \"Doctor Who\", appeared in the \"Harry Potter\" film series, \"Broadchurch\", and the Netflix show \"Jessica Jones\".  His Doctor, sporting a pinstripe suit, gained more eccentricities than his Ninth incarnation though seemed to be more affable, still getting emotional and stern when need-be, but appearing to have more fun. \n"}]}
