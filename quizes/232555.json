{"id": "232555", "name": "Battling in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, or Yellow\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Pokemon Games", " Pokemon Red/ Blue/Yellow"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these attacks will drain HP from an opponent and give it to your own Pok\u00e9mon?", "correct": "Leech Seed", "options": ["Recover", "Lovely Kiss", "Focus Energy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeech Seed.\n\n\tThe Leech Seed technique is much like the Absorb technique since it will take an enemy's HP and add it to your own, but it works a bit differently.  Rather than needing to be used every turn, Leech Seed can latch onto an opponent and perform its task on every turn much like a poison.  This attack is commonly seen in grass-type Pok\u00e9mon like Bulbasaur. \n"}, {"text": "Which technique, often used by Snorlax and Jigglypuff, will recover a Pok\u00e9mon's HP at the expense of a few turns?", "correct": "Rest", "options": ["Sword's Dance", "Recover", "Softboiled"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRest.\n\n\tRest allows a Pok\u00e9mon to recover HP, but it will prevent them from attacking for a few turns as a penalty.  This technique is also found in TM44, which can be found in the S. S. Anne while it's docked in Vermilion City.  Although it's not commonly learned by psychic Pok\u00e9mon, it's classified as a psychic-type move. \n"}, {"text": "Which attack, when used, will result in your collecting extra cash at the end of battle?", "correct": "Pay Day", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPay Day.\n\n\tPay Day is only learned by Meowth and Persian through experience, but if you happen to locate TM16 on Route 12, you may just be able to teach it to other Pok\u00e9mon.  To obtain this TM, you'll need to have taught HM03 (Surf) to a Pok\u00e9mon.  When used in battle, Pay Day will cause a Pok\u00e9mon to drop coins that can be picked up after battle.  The total obtained will be shown. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these techniques will decrease a Pok\u00e9mon's accuracy if successful?", "correct": "Kinesis", "options": ["Confuse Ray", "Aurora Beam", "Withdraw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKinesis.\n\n\tKinesis is commonly learned by psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon like Abra.  However, Kadabra and Alakazam will not learn this technique if evolved from Abra in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\".  There is no TM for this technique.  Confuse Ray can cause a Pok\u00e9mon to become confused, Aurora Beam can freeze a Pok\u00e9mon and possibly decrease an opponent's attack power, and Withdraw increases your own Pok\u00e9mon's defense. \n"}, {"text": "What is the only technique that Ditto can have in its true form?", "correct": "Transform", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTransform.\n\n\tDitto is quite an odd Pok\u00e9mon because using the Transform technique, it can morph into its opponent taking their skills and attributes.  Transform is not learned by any other Pok\u00e9mon in any way, shape, or form unless it's used through the random Metronome attack.  Otherwise, Ditto could possibly use any attack in the game. \n"}, {"text": "Which attack does not have a possibility of an immediate one hit KO?", "correct": "Dragon Rage", "options": ["Fissure", "Guillotine", "Explosion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDragon Rage.\n\n\tAlthough Fissure is ineffective against flying-type Pok\u00e9mon, all three of the incorrect answers can potentially hold a one-hit KO attack and knock the opponent out of the battle immediately.  Guillotine is the only one of these that isn't learned from a TM.  Explosion is also known as TM47 and can be found on Victory Road while Fissure (TM27) is given to you by Giovanni in the final gym.  Dragon Rage, commonly learned by Gyarados and Dragonite, only deal 40 damage per attack. \n"}, {"text": "What attack will a Pok\u00e9mon use once it has run out of PP on its other attacks?", "correct": "Struggle", "options": ["Flee", "Flail", "Escape"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStruggle.\n\n\tThe amount of PP an attack has is the amount of times it can be used.  When a Pok\u00e9mon runs out of PP on a certain attack it can't be used until it heals at a Pok\u00e9mon Center or uses an Ether or Elixir.  When all attacks run out of PP, the Pok\u00e9mon will use Struggle.  This last-chance technique is not very effective, and one quarter of damage dealt out with this attack will recoil and damage your Pok\u00e9mon. \n"}, {"text": "Which attack will a newly caught Magikarp always have?", "correct": "Splash", "options": ["Tackle", "Bubble", "Water Gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSplash.\n\n\tMagikarp is a pretty lame Pok\u00e9mon until it evolves into a Gyarados.  In fact, it won't learn an actual attack until level 15 (Tackle).  Since using a Magikarp in battle isn't entirely effective, it can be caught by simply using the Old Rod in any body of water.  This rod is given to you by the Fishing Guru in Vermilion City.  Luckily, Magikarp evolves into Gyarados at a low level (level 20). \n"}, {"text": "Which attack does a wild Abra always have?", "correct": "Teleport", "options": ["Confusion", "Kinesis", "Hypnosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeleport.\n\n\tWild Abras are always tricky to catch, because if they're quicker than your active Pok\u00e9mon, it will simply Teleport out of battle.  To avoid this, you could always make the Abra fall asleep, or you could use a stronger Pok\u00e9ball on a weaker Abra.  Of course, if this is too difficult, you can cash in your winnings at the Celadon City Game Corner for a cheap Abra in any of the three games.  \rIf you're running low on coins, the cheapest Abras can be found in Pok\u00e9mon Blue. ;) \n"}, {"text": "The Dream Eater technique is only successful if an opponent's Pok\u00e9mon is asleep.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIf you put your opponent into a restful sleep, your Pok\u00e9mon can use Dream Eater (TM42) to absorb HP from them.  This TM can only be learned by Gastly, Haunter, Gengar, Drowzee, and Hypno.  TM42 can be found in Viridian City if you use HM01 or HM03 (Cut or Surf).  Finding an attack that puts your opponent to sleep is up to you, though all Pok\u00e9mon that can learn Dream Eater will acquire a hypnosis-type attack through experience. \n"}]}
