{"id": "221004", "name": "'King of the Hill' - 'Peggy the Boggle Champ' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "King Of The Hill", "Episodes"], "questions": [{"text": "Peggy is seen playing with Nancy Gribble and Minh at the beginning of the episode.  Minh is getting a rather rude introduction to the game, with her repeated efforts to spell southeast Asian words being denied.  What does Minh claim the term 'bametomyam' means?", "correct": "Thai spicy noodle soup", "options": ["Emperor", "Angry woman", "Cow dung"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThai spicy noodle soup.\n\n\tIn fact, tom yam is a popular spicy Thai noodle soup which has caught on in the United States.  Peggy is not aware of this, of course, and dismisses Minh's attempts to introduce new words into her vocabulary as absurd.  Later, Minh will also try to use 'PadThai', with the same results. \n"}, {"text": "While Peggy and the ladies play Boggle, Hank and the boys sit in the front room watching the boob tube.  Suddenly, an advertisement comes on the screen that puts them at the edges of their seat.  What is the content of this advertisement?", "correct": "Lawn mower expo", "options": ["Propane barbecue competition", "Willie Nelson concert", "Monster truck jam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLawn mower expo.\n\n\tThe 9th Annual Dallas Moer Expo will be held on the following Sunday (and Saturday), much to the delight of Hank and his friends.  The advertisement entices them with the following: the 'awe inspiring spectacle of the Snapper Mowing Team', King Mulch (taking on a 'Texas-sized pile of twigs') and 10,000 oil paintings (no idea why that's in there).  Naturally, the boys have to attend at all costs. \n"}, {"text": "Which local organization holds a Boggle tournament in which Peggy is convinced to participate?", "correct": "Elks", "options": ["Daughters of the Revolution", "YMCA", "PTA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElks.\n\n\tPeggy is resistant to participate, claiming that she does it as a hobby, but her girlfriends insist that she take part.  Hank chuckles at the fact that the Elks are sponsoring the tournament, suggesting that they will 'do anything for a dollar'. \n"}, {"text": "Which cry does Peggy Hill give off each time she shakes the Boggle tray and then slams it down on the table?", "correct": "Hoo-yah!", "options": ["Shake it baby!", "Come to mommy!", "Geronimo!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoo-yah!.\n\n\tThis is rather one of the more entertaining elements of the story.  Peggy is so reserved, but yet so very competitive.  Happily, she wins the local tournament and is entitled to be Arlen's representative at the state Boggle tournament the following weekend. \n"}, {"text": "Peggy is an automatic invitee to the Texas state Boggle tournament thanks to her marvelous performance at the Arlen Boggle tournament.  In which large Texas city will the state tournament be held?", "correct": "Dallas", "options": ["Austin", "Houston", "San Antonio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDallas.\n\n\tCoincidentally, this is the same location for the lawn mower show that Hank hopes to attend.  Hank believes he can kill two birds with one stone, attending the Boggle tournament as Peggy's coach, but sneaking out when Peggy is busy playing to join his friends at the mower show. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following businesses with a ridiculous name is not one of those sponsoring Peggy at the state Boggle tournament?", "correct": "Bailey's Bail Bonds", "options": ["Mr. Lube", "Dairy King", "Rivera Sump Pumps"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBailey's Bail Bonds.\n\n\tPeggy is handed a jacket from the Arlen Boggle Boosters, a club that seemingly consists only of Minh and Nancy.  When Peggy is about to embark for Dallas, the two women present the jacket and wish her luck.  Minh adds a tentative 'goodbye', suggesting that where she comes from, losers don't return home. \n"}, {"text": "With Hank and Peggy gone for the weekend, Luanne and Bobby get the house all to themselves.  Luanne has prepared for the occasion, renting which exciting 1980s film from the local video dealer?", "correct": "Risky Business", "options": ["Blood Simple", "9 1/2 Weeks", "Angel Heart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRisky Business.\n\n\tBobby Hill does a Tom Cruise impression during this scene, sliding out of his room wearing only underwear and socks (as Cruise does in 'Risky Business').  Luanne also has managed, somehow, to acquire a fire safety video featuring Chuck Mangione. (Bizarre!) \n"}, {"text": "Bobby and Luanne bask in their newfound freedom, that is, until things begin to go awry.  The two youngsters start making a mess of the place, beginning with which major faux pas?", "correct": "Bobby makes a water ring on the coffee table", "options": ["Bobby gets a finger print on a piece of Peggy's crystal", "Luanne drips a bit of nail polish in the carpet", "Luanne burns the bathroom counter with her hair curler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBobby makes a water ring on the coffee table.\n\n\tBobby attempts to make amends for the coffee table water ring by varnishing the table, but things only get worse when a bit of the varnish spills on the carpet.  This sets off a series of events that results in half the cleaners and repairmen in town working in the Hill house to clean up the various messes. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the intimidating Boggle champ that Peggy must go up against during the state tournament in the very first round?", "correct": "Cissy Cobb", "options": ["Sally Stride", "Macy Parker", "Alina Menendez"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCissy Cobb.\n\n\tCissy Cobb, with her pseudo sophisticated attitude and horse laugh, belittles poor Peggy from the now seemingly small and remote Arlen, Texas.  Cissy is a seven-time champion (in non-consecutive years) of the Dallas tournament, and she means to make it eight.  She derisively calls Peggy 'Patches', after all the sponsor patches Peggy wears on her jacket. \n"}, {"text": "Peggy is ultimately crowned the champion of the Texas state Boggle tournament.  Which incredibly long word puts her over the top in the final round of play?", "correct": "Acquaintanceship", "options": ["Quintessentially", "Otorhinolaryngology", "Subbookkeeper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAcquaintanceship.\n\n\tWhile Cissy Cobb formulates relatively few longer words, Peggy concentrates on a number of shorter words.  Peggy's strategy works, but it is actually her use of the word 'acquaintanceship' (which Cissy initially believes is the word 'ain't' because of the way Peggy has the letters covered with her fingers) that puts her over the top!\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
