{"id": "104202", "name": "'N'otable Art Terms Quiz | Art | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Art", "Art Terms"], "questions": [{"text": "This 'N' term, related to architecture, describes a cemetery of elaborate design to be found in an ancient city.  Name it!  \n", "correct": "Necropolis & Necropoleis & Nekropolis", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNecropolis & Necropoleis & Nekropolis.\n\n\tThe term 'necropolis' comes from the ancient Greek (nekropolis) and literally translates as 'city of the dead'.  Well-preserved examples of necropoli are to be found throughout the Meditteranean, and particularly in Egypt, Greece and Turkey.  By the way, another interesting note...necropolis is one of the few words that when singular ends in -s, but when plural has the -s dropped. \n"}, {"text": "Another word from the architectural vocabulary, if you will forgive the indulgence.  What is the term for the central aisle of an ancient Roman basilica and the central hall of a Christian cruciform church?  \n", "correct": "Nave", "options": ["Nexus", "Narthex", "Napse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNave.\n\n\tIn a Roman basilica the nave was flanked on both sides by the 'side aisles' (with rows of columns as dividers).  In a later, Gothic style cathedral, the nave, also flanked by side aisles, led up to the 'crossing', which separated it from the 'choir' or 'chancel'.  The crossing laid in the center of the cross created by the 'transept' and the nave/chancel combo.  The term 'nave' comes from the Latin 'navis', which means ship...and hence the word 'navy'! \n"}, {"text": "What is another name for a 'gloriole', the halo of light surrounding the head of a sacred religious figure in art?  \n", "correct": "Nimbus", "options": ["Naos", "Nebula", "Nobless"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNimbus.\n\n\tFrom the Latin for 'cloud'.  If this halo is merely surrounding the head, it is called a nimbus, but if the halo surrounds the entire figure it could be referred to as a 'mandorla'.  Frequently nimbi (whose plural also drops the s, but not without an adjustment of the u to an i, a more common form of pluralization) will be found around the heads of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, Saints and Alex Trabek.  Okay...maybe not Alex, but perhaps one day he'll be sainted...the patron saint of trivia? \n"}, {"text": "A term frequently associated with piano music, it also can describe a night scene in the visual arts.  To which term am I alluding?  \n", "correct": "Nocturne", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNocturne.\n\n\tThough we probably most associate the word 'nocturne' with Frederic Chopin, James A. M. Whistler also painted a famous series of works with that namesake. \n"}, {"text": "The late medieval process called 'niello' required which of these items?  \n", "correct": "A metallic alloy", "options": ["Bees wax", "An Enamel glaze", "Fresh wood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA metallic alloy.\n\n\tNiello was a process in which a metal alloy was used as a decorative inlay on metal objects.  The metal alloy itself, usually made with silver, copper, lead and sulfur, was also called 'niello' for its 'black' appearance. \n"}, {"text": "The remainder of the questions in this quiz will deal with 'N' art movements.  Perhaps the most overused prefix in modern art, it can be placed before classicism, realism, Dada, Expressionism, Impressionism, Plasticism, and on and on, ad nauseum.  What is this delightful little prefix?  \n", "correct": "Neo & Neo-", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeo & Neo-.\n\n\tNeo, which means 'new', has been used to define dozens of new art movements of the 20th century.  I think the term is popular as a way of linking modern art with great works of the past, but sometimes different is exciting too.  Of course I have no room to talk, this is my 26th neo-art terms quiz... \n"}, {"text": "The French painters Bonnard, Vuillard and S\u00e9rusier were so inspired by Gauguin's works that they named themselves the 'Nabis', which means prophets.  From which language is this a 'prophetic' word?  \n", "correct": "Hebrew", "options": ["Arabic", "Russian", "Hindi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHebrew.\n\n\tThe term 'Nabis' was coined by poet Henri Cazalis from the Hebrew to describe these French followers of Gauguin.  Of course, they did not take themselves so seriously, coming off as a semi-burlesque group of characters...the name is charming I think. \n"}, {"text": "The works of Grandma Moses, Henri Rousseau and John Kane can all be described using which 'N' term?  \n", "correct": "Naive", "options": ["Native", "Narcissistic", "Nonsense"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNaive.\n\n\tThe term na\u00efve, implying unaffected simplicity, has been applied to a general art 'movement' wherein artists (sometimes purposefully) create imagery that ignores the conventional expertise of representational skills (i.e. perspective), producing more child-like imagery than is traditionally expected of master artworks.  The term 'primitive' has also been used to describe this art movement, but this term can be confused as it has numerous applications. \n"}, {"text": "The 'New York School' is another name for which of these modern art movements?  \n", "correct": "Abstract Expressionism", "options": ["Minimalism", "Dada", "Surrealism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbstract Expressionism.\n\n\tThe New York School was so named because most of its members, for example Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and many others, used New York City as a base.  Abstract Expressionism did not start with these fellows, however.  It was first used to describe the works of Kandinsky, who began creating fully abstract works in 1910, several decades before the New York Schoolers got their start. \n"}, {"text": "Overbeck and Pforr were the two most famous of this small group of German painters, based in Rome during the early 19th century, whose goal it was to return art to its true purpose, to serve religion.  What was this group, established in 1809, called?  \n", "correct": "Nazarenes", "options": ["Naphthalites", "Nebuchadnezzers", "Naturalisme"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNazarenes.\n\n\tThough this group of painters, led by Overbeck, formed in Vienna under the name 'Brotherhood of St. Luke' (Lukasbr\u00fcder), they soon gained the nickname 'Nazarenes'.  The term was a derisive one, making fun of the affected appearances of the artists, who chose to dress in biblical fashion.  Though their choice of subject material was of little influence to future artists, their style was influential in the development of the works of the Pre-Raphaelites, Ford Madox Brown, and even Ingres.
