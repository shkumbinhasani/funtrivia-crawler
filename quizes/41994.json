The areas of phonological utterances were strictly analyzed, rather than the deep intentional structure...this is where they went wrong, since we know that utterances in general can be arbitrary. \n"}, {"text": "Since language is arbitrary, but contains 'Permitted Moves', what term best describes this view of communicational systems?", "correct": "games", "options": ["random", "deviant", "structured"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngames.\n\n"}, {"text": "What three components, generally, make up a system of a typical language?", "correct": "phonology syntax semantics", "options": ["semiosis syntax frames", "frames semantics utterances", "sign sign signs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nphonology syntax semantics.\n\n"}, {"text": "What is the smallest segment of sound, that comprises the basic building blocks of a language?", "correct": "phoneme", "options": ["metameme", "morpheme", "terameme"], "explanation": "\n\n\nphoneme.\n\n\tPhonemes on the average are 35 per language, English has 44 phonemes such as  b, p, i, e, etc. The languages of the Caucasus may have the most with 89. \n"}, {"text": "What is the term for unchanging, gliding vowels which combine two distinct vowel sounds into a single one?", "correct": "diphthongs", "options": ["variations", "morpheme pairs", "complementary pairs"], "explanation": "\n\n\ndiphthongs.\n\n"}, {"text": "The morpheme is the smallest syntactical unit.
