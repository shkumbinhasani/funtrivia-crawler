{"id": "140105", "name": "The Most Important 'J' People Multiple Choice Quiz | Mixed People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", " Mixed People", " People by Surname"], "questions": [{"text": "Jayavarman I remains to this day one of the most powerful single rulers/leaders ever to hold the reigns of power in southeast Asia.  Which empire of that region coalesced around his rule?  ", "correct": "Khmer", "options": ["Pagan", "Champa", "Ayutthya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKhmer.\n\n\tJayavarman I is credited by some historians as the 'founder' of the great Khmer empire, which at its height dominated the entire region of southeast Asia.  Centered within the country now called Cambodia (Kampuchia), the Khmer empire established suzerainty over virtually the entire region for nearly six centuries.  At its height, the massive stone god-worshiping complex called Angkor Wat at its capital was central to Hindu/Buddhist worship throughout the surrounding areas.  Jayavarman I's rule began in 802 A.D., and his kingdom finally fell in 1431 at the hands of the Thais. \n"}, {"text": "British physicist James Prescott Joule was active during the 19th century in England, helping to develop the doctrine behind which of these concepts?  ", "correct": "Energy", "options": ["Atomic theory", "Wave theory", "Electromagnetism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEnergy.\n\n\tJ. P. Joule, a student of the great atomist Dalton, helped to elucidate the concept of energy for the scientific public.  Joule's experimental work helped to clarify the relationship between work and heat, and he gave the first clear exposition on what he called the 'living force' in 1847.  We now call it 'energy'.  He might have been the first to state the 'law of conservation of energy', one of the laws of thermodynamics.  Oh yes, and the SI unit for energy is called, what else, a 'joule'! \n"}, {"text": "This inventor created an automated loom in 1801 that employed punch card technology, helping to revolutionize the textile industry in Europe.  What was his surname?  ", "correct": "Jacquard", "options": ["Jung", "Joachim", "Jaspars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJacquard.\n\n\tJoseph Jacquard, born into a French weaving family in the mid-18th century, greatly improved on previous automated looms by employing a punch card system that finally accounted for the complexities of pattern weaving.  His punch card idea was eventually employed by Charles Babbage, who developed the first workable computer later in the 19th century.  Jacquard died a rather wealthy man in 1834, this after falling bankrupt after inheriting his father's failed weaving business! \n"}, {"text": "Born a Jew, he is considered the savior of Christianity and the second most important prophet of Islam.  Of course we are refering to Jesus Christ!  Speaking of the Muslims, by what name do they know Jesus?  ", "correct": "Issa", "options": ["Mussa", "Salaam", "Ishmail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIssa.\n\n\tThe name Issa is derived from the Greek version of Jesus' name, Yssus.  The original Hebrew name means 'savior'.  By the way, Muslims know Moses as 'Mussa', thus that incorrect choice for this question. \n"}, {"text": "As a result of the work of Edward Jenner we have the complex system of inoculations that every child painfully experiences during his/her early years.  In 1796, he made his first vaccination, inoculating a boy in order to protect him from which disease?  ", "correct": "Smallpox", "options": ["Malaria", "Typhoid", "Measles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmallpox.\n\n\tJenner's inoculation experiment with the young boy came via an interesting inspiration.  He noticed that locals who contracted the relatively innocuous disease cowpox became somehow immune to the much more devastating smallpox virus.  Realizing a correlation, he was allowed to experiment on the young boy, injecting him with a cowpox serum.  Sure enough, the young child became resistant to smallpox, and the revolution against the scourge of communicable diseases had begun. \n"}, {"text": "British king James I was of the Stuart royal line in Scotland.  Under which name had he previously ruled his home country?  ", "correct": "James VI", "options": ["James IV", "James I", "James VIII"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames VI.\n\n\tThe sixth Stuart king named James, he came to the British throne after the death of Elizabeth in 1603.  Living a somewhat dissolute personal life, he nonetheless presided over one of the most important periods in British history, allowing British exploration of the 'new world' to once again begin anew, he helped promote the earliest English colonies in North America.  He also commissioned the 'King James Version' of the Bible, which was completed in 1611.  His scholarly abilities as a monarch were unmatched, writing a treatise called 'Basilikon Doron' on governance, among several other works.  Certainly a mixed record for this pious fellow, whose competence in governing was quite inconsistent. \n"}, {"text": "The best known of the Byzantine emperors, Justinian I reigned over the eastern Roman empire during the mid-6th century A.D.  Which of these great feats was not accomplished during his reign?  ", "correct": "The establishment of Christianity as the official church of Rome", "options": ["The reconquest of Italy and much of the western Roman empire", "The building of the Hagia Sophia and San Vitale", "The commissioning of the Roman digest of laws known as the 'Justinian Code'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe establishment of Christianity as the official church of Rome.\n\n\tJustinian's reign, which lasted from 527 to 565 A.D., was indeed a mixed blessing for the people under his rule.  Though the empire saw much glory, re-establishing power in the west by conquering Ostrogothic Italy, establishing the Justinian Code and building the great churches of San Vitale and the Hagia Sophia, he also heavily taxed his people, and attempted to impose a strict brand of Christianity (which was already the official religion from the time of Theodosius) over the various denizens of his realm.  Following his free-spending reign, Byzantium greatly declined in power and influence. \n"}, {"text": "Joan of Arc, heroine of the French during the Hundred Years War, lived a short but full life.  In which town did she begin her existence?  ", "correct": "Domr\u00e9my", "options": ["Orl\u00e9ans", "Rouen", "Lille"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDomr\u00e9my.\n\n\tKnown as the 'Maid of Orl\u00e9ans' (or 'la Pucelle'), she was not born in that city, but rather scored a major victory for France at its outskirts.  She was born in the obscure village of Domr\u00e9my, near Burgundy, in 1412 and died in Rouen only 19 years later.  During her short life she claimed to have heard the voices of three saints, who instructed her to take up arms and fight for her home country.  She followed their instructions obediently and, almost miraculously, became a war hero for France.  Her short life ended in execution...she finally earned canonization in the early 20th century, becoming St. Joan. \n"}, {"text": "One of the greats of Arab science, he was an early adherent of the practice of alchemy.  Alongside this, he was an advisor to Haroun al-Rashid, the greatest Abbasid Caliph, and is sometimes described as the 'Father of Chemistry'.  To whom do I refer?  ", "correct": "Jabir", "options": ["Jahangir", "Jundishapur", "Jugurtha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJabir.\n\n\tJabir, probably better known as 'Geber' (Latinized name), was one of the first experimental investigators into the science of chemistry.  His works include nearly 100 treatises, not all of which are likely his (though they are attributed to him).  Like Aristotle, he was a great systematizer, and his work helped established various laboratory methods.

", "correct": "Minister to France", "options": ["Governor of Virginia", "President of the Continental Congress", "Secretary of State"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinister to France.\n\n\tJefferson served as Governor of Virginia just before making off for France, where he served as America's minister for 5 years.  Returning just as the French Revolution was getting underway, he was appointed secretary of state by Washington.  He would later become vice-president and president of the United States.  He was not the sole author of the Declaration of Independence, being a member of a 5-man committee, but most believe that he was the most dynamic force behind its creation.  Speaking of declarations, I declare this quiz finished...thanks for playing.  Please have a look at the other quizzes in this series if you have enjoyed this one! \n"}]}
