With two Dragon Balls already in Goku's possession and en route, as it would seem, to the Red Ribbon Army's next-in-command (General Blue), Goku and Bulma discover (via the Dragon Radar) that their next ball is deep within the ocean.  Bulma waits at a nearby island to discover that they only have one Dyna-Cap in their possession (filled with nudey magazines from her father's collection) while Goku dives in for a swim, coming up empty-handed because of the immense depth. On the island, however, Bulma is attacked by two helicopters from the nearby island base of the Red Ribbon Army, alerting the two to the idea that they may not be alone in the search quite yet. \n"}, {"text": "What does Bulma need to give to Master Roshi to obtain a viable vehicle for their Dragon Ball hunt?", "correct": "Her Micro-Band", "options": ["Her Dragon Balls", "Her underwear", "Her Dyna-Caps"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer Micro-Band.\n\n\tSince they have no submarine to dive into the ocean and collect the closest Dragon Ball, Goku and Bulma decide to visit Master Roshi, whose island is nearby, to find out if he has a means of them reaching the ocean floor.  Sure enough, he has a submarine and is willing to give it up if Bulma hands over her Micro-Band. They also have to wait for Krillin and Launch to return from the nearest town with it.  Unfortunately, the Red Ribbon Army becomes aware that Goku may have a base nearby and sends their scouts to the Kame House to intercept.  Goku, and Krillin take the sub out for a spin, leaving the others. \n"}, {"text": "While seeking out other Dragon Balls, Bulma accidentally leaves some behind at Master Roshi's house.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tGoku, Bulma, and Krillin head underwater in their submarine on the hunt for the Dragon Ball, but little do they know, General Blue is watching from shore nearby, waiting for them to find the ball so that he can take it.  On the same note, the Red Ribbon Army is surrounding Roshi's island to take the Dragon Balls and a single prisoner: Roshi, who's suspected to be a scientist.  Goku and the others end up finding a fissure and a cave, but they end up followed by the Red Ribbon Army.\rBack at the Kame House, after dealing with Launch's transformation, the army arrives and forces the near-unbeatable Master Roshi into battle.  Fortunately, Launch's darker side is enough to finish them off. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these traps does not appear in the Pirate Hideout?", "correct": "Chamber of snakes", "options": ["Electric eel", "Lava pit", "Hallway of spears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChamber of snakes.\n\n\tGoku, Bulma, and Krillin end up heading into the caves under the sea but, unexpectedly, turn on a light switch, revealing the entire place to be a cavern home to pirates.  What they find there (as they're followed by General Blue and his men) is a series of booby traps.  After crossing a room of spears with Goku's power pole, the three also nearly fell into a pit of lava. General Blue, meanwhile, evaded the spears by locating a secret door, bringing him face to face with an electric eel (though his comrades weren't so lucky).  On the other side of the traps is an old pirate port, but none of them are in the clear quite yet. \n"}, {"text": "What turns out to be guarding the pirate port?", "correct": "A robot", "options": ["Pirate ghosts", "Killer sharks", "Children"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA robot.\n\n\tWhen the survivors emerge in the pirate port they find they're not alone; there's a horrible pirate robot guarding the area with a machine gun and a sword.  An elaborate fight ensues in which Bulma takes to a machine gun and Goku and Krillin fight with all they've got.  Soon it seems as though Bulma's shots are bringing the place down but, luckily, they persevere...for a moment or two. The robot pulls Goku into the water and incapacitates him, leading Bulma and Krillin to find a command post.  Goku is inevitably able to defeat the robot, but not before triggering the beginning of a cave-in.  While Bulma and Krillin escape (along with General Blue) in a well, Goku is led in the opposite direction. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following does Goku discover General Blue is afraid of?", "correct": "Mouse", "options": ["Octopus", "Spider", "Germs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMouse.\n\n\tThe collapse of the pirate cave starts to worry Goku who soon thinks that giving up the search for the nearby Dragon Ball is in his best interest.  When he reaches a dead end he accidentally stumbles into the lair of a giant octopus (though it's nothing a Kamehameha Wave doesn't fix).  Bulma and Krillin, meanwhile, find the pirate treasure but, in doing so, activate a sword-firing guardian statue. When they find the treasure therein, General Blue reveals himself and stakes his claim, fighting Krillin and somehow managing to paralyze him.  When Goku finally shows up, General Blue is shocked with his proficiency in battle and manages to become superpowered, nearly defeating Goku...until a mouse runs along. \n"}, {"text": "Bulma escapes the pirate cave with which of these in her possession?", "correct": "Diamond", "options": ["Dragon Ball", "Key", "Pirate hat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiamond.\n\n\tAfter the group discovers General Blue's disdain for icky creatures, the battle shifts.  Goku is able to bring down General Blue and locate the three-star Dragon Ball while Krillin and Bulma figure out an escape plan, securing the pirates' old submarine.  When the submarine runs out of power during their escape, the group is forced to hold their breath and hope that Goku's Kamehameha Wave can push them through the narrow tunnels to the surface. Fortunately, it does, and they're able to reach the daylight and take the Flying Nimbus to safety.  At the same time, however, General Blue is able to make his way to the surface. When they reach shore, Bulma reveals she took a souvenir: a large diamond from the pirate hoard.  Little do they know, the Red Ribbon Army is aware of their presence and their success; it's because of this that Bulma opts out of future hunts for the Dragon Balls. \n"}, {"text": "Who is able to escape General Blue's magic ropes on their own, preventing the Kame House from exploding?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["Goku", "Master Roshi", "Bulma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tAfter Goku grabs some food, the trio decides to return to the Kame House and Bulma gives Master Roshi the diamond in exchange for the submarine that was destroyed in the pirate cave.  As it turns out, however, evil Launch is willing to kill over it; she escapes in the Red Ribbon Army helicopter.  While this happens, General Blue descends on Master Roshi's island and uses a length of rope to psychically advance on the group and restrain them, take their Dragon Balls, and place a bomb in the house. Fortunately, Launch returns as her good self, just in time to untie Goku and get him to toss the bomb. He immediately boards the Nimbus and chases after General Blue. \n"}, {"text": "From which of these locations does Arale hail?", "correct": "Penguin Village", "options": ["Walrus Town", "Sealberg", "Arctic Land"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPenguin Village.\n\n\tGoku pursues General Blue's helicopter, but both of them end up crashing after passing over a village.  While Blue lands on a crash-lands mountain, Goku tumbles to the ground, landing in a location known as Penguin Village.  Here, Goku is introduced to the odd Arale and her friends, Gachem 1 and 2, all of whom seem a bit too eccentric. Meanwhile, since Blue is already on the run, the chase is till on.  Arale proves more interesting when she can ride the Flying Nimbus, but they have too much trouble hunting down the Red Ribbon Army General.  While looking to secure a plane, Blue ends up crashing his stolen car into Arale (not harming her) while the Gachems, confusingly, eat the pieces. Blue simply tries to flee faster.  Soon, Goku discovers that the Dragon Radar is, once again, broken, bringing the hunt to a halt. \n"}, {"text": "Who takes the Dragon Radar from Goku at the end of the saga?", "correct": "General Blue", "options": ["Bulma", "Commander Red", "Arale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneral Blue.\n\n\tGoku tries to get the Dragon Radar fixed in Penguin Village by the same man who also happens to own a plane.  As such, Blue arrives just in time to see the Dragon Radar restored and decides to take Arale hostage, paralyzing Goku and fleeing with all three Dragon Balls and the Bleeper.  Just as Blue is about to deal the killing blow on Goku, Arale plays a game of tag, somehow knocking the General far into the sky, sending him to an unknown destination (where there seem to be pyramids).  Unfortunately, the Dragon Radar remains with Blue, having been stored in his pocket. Luckily, the youngest child in Penguin Village, Turbo, is enough of a genius to construct a new Dragon Radar using telepathy, and Goku takes to the Flying Nimbus to hunt down the final Dragon Balls. \n"}]}
