", "correct": "John Adams and Thomas Jefferson", "options": ["George Washington and James Madison", "None of the signers of the Declaration of Independence became President", "George Washington and Thomas Jefferson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Adams and Thomas Jefferson.\n\n\tAdams replaced the popular George Washington as America's second president.  Unfortunately, he inherited a political landscape intensely divided between those who wanted a powerful central government and those who sought to protect states' rights. Adams was a man who acted on principle even if it went against popular opinion. He successfully defended nine British soldiers on trial for their part in the Boston Massacre and as president he, at great political cost, averted war with France at a time when the public clamored for the conflict. Jefferson followed Adams as president. The two one-time friends, who had worked together on the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence, became bitter political enemies. As runner up to Adams in the 1796 election Jefferson became vice president. Both had differing philosophies on how the nation should be governed and their political differences led to personal dislike and to no communication between them until their latter years.  Jefferson was somewhat more successful as President with the Louisiana Purchase being one of his great achievements. He served two terms as president but chose not to mention it on the epitaph he wrote for his tombstone. Ironically Adams and Jefferson both died on the same day, July 4, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the first person to sign the Declaration of Independence?
