{"id": "43750", "name": "Play Ultimate in 5 Easy Steps! Quiz | Sports | 5 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", " Sports Other", "Frisbee"], "questions": [{"text": "The first thing to do is to mark off a playing field. What are the dimensions of a regulation field, measured from sideline to sideline and from the back of one endzone to the back of the other?", "correct": "40 yards by 120 yards", "options": ["50 yards by 50 yards", "50 yards by 100 yards", "25 yards by 120 yards"], "explanation": "\n\n\n40 yards by 120 yards.\n\n\tWhile any playing surface without dangerous holes or obstacles is fine, the best surface is grass. There's quite a bit of running in Ultimate, though, so any field that's used often will take a lot of abuse. \n"}, {"text": "You'll need to draw goal lines to separate the endzones from the playing field proper. How deep should each endzone be?", "correct": "25 yards", "options": ["10 yards", "30 yards", "5 yards"], "explanation": "\n\n\n25 yards.\n\n\tThe goal lines themselves are often not really drawn, but defined by a pair of cones or other landmarks. The lines count as part of the playing field proper: if you catch a pass on the line of the opponent's endzone, you'll have to pass again before you can score. \n"}, {"text": "You'll also want a few Frisbees, of course. What's the maximum weight of a Frisbee legal for game play?", "correct": "200 grams", "options": ["175 grams", "100 grams", "150 grams"], "explanation": "\n\n\n200 grams.\n\n\tAny weight under 200 grams is fine, as long as the disk is agreeable to both team captains. Most disks weigh about 175 grams. Get several, because disks take a lot of abuse, and a bent or otherwise damaged disk is no longer good for play. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following situations is NOT a legal opportunity to make a substitution?", "correct": "during a time-out", "options": ["before the start of a period of play", "after a player has been injured", "after a point and before the next throw-off"], "explanation": "\n\n\nduring a time-out.\n\n\tBefore the start of a period of play, between points, and at an injury, each team has an equal opportunity to make unlimited substitutions -- provided that, at any time once play begins, each team has exactly seven players on the field. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these calls is never a valid reason to stop play?", "correct": "'Substitution!'", "options": ["'Equipment!'", "'Time out!'", "'Pick!'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Substitution!'.\n\n\tEach team has a limited number of time-outs per period of play. A 'pick' is when someone (no matter which team) interferes with the defense. For example, if I were marking (defending against) a player who ran around another player in such a way that I had to stop to avoid a collision, my opponent would have committed a pick. 'Equipment!' is most often yelled when someone's shoelaces become untied. No one wants anyone to break a leg. \n"}]}
