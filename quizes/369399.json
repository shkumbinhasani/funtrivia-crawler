Despite the fact that the event inside was clearly stated to be a soiree, you hear nothing.\n\nWhen you walk up to the door you notice there's no doorbell; as such you decide to knock.  After a brisk rapping, the door swings open on its own.  It was clearly shut...\n\nYou blame the recent cold spell; the dry weather must've been the culprit.  Why would this be a reasonable assumption?", "correct": "Dry, cold weather can cause wood to contract; the door would not fit in the frame properly and, thus, unlatch easier.", "options": ["Locks and hinges snap easier in cooler weather; the door has been broken.", "It's not; the house is haunted.  Ghosts let you in.", "Oak is not a typical door material because of its tendency to be very flexible in cold conditions; the door bent open as a result of this odd phenomenon."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDry, cold weather can cause wood to contract; the door would not fit in the frame properly and, thus, unlatch easier.\n\n\tSure, your car is broken down...in a storm...on the way to a fancy party led by (as you've heard through the grapevine) a man charmingly referred to as 'The Devil in a Suit' and 'The Murder House Strangler'-- who, in all honesty, hasn't even been seen in public in six years to the day-- but you can put on a good face.  A night out is a night out.\r And come on-- the door?  That's nothing.  Wooden doors and door frames have a habit of this, especially older ones.  Humidity and high temperatures typically cause wood to expand, so there could be a problem shutting a door in such an instance (if they grow enough so that the fixture doesn't fit anymore).  On the flipside, coldness and dryness actually cause wood to contract; the door will fit into the frame, but perhaps it won't be a perfect fit altogether.\r Either way, the door's open.  The lights are on.  Oddly, it seems like no one's home.  Might as well step inside.\r ...the door shuts closed behind you.\r (Question by Kyleisalive) \n"}, {"text": "As the door slams shut behind you, the lights suddenly go out.  You're left alone in the dark foyer.   You can hear the howling wind of the storm, the rain pummeling the windows...\n\nOff in the distance you think you can faintly hear the sound of music.  You have been standing with feet frozen to the foyer floor for long enough.  No one has come to welcome you in so you quietly head out in search of the music; the sound must be coming from the soiree, right?\n\nYou head down a long, dark, corridor, and the eerie tune gets louder and louder.  Opening a door at the end of the hall, you find the music room.  In the darkness you can faintly see a piano; the music must be coming from the piano, but there's no one in sight!  A chill runs down your spine...\n\nCalm yourself; there must be a logical explanation.  How could the piano be playing itself?", "correct": "It is a reproducing player piano.", "options": ["It is a split stack player piano.", "It is not a player piano at all.  It's haunted.", "It is a theme control player piano."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is a reproducing player piano.\n\n\tThe player piano was invented by Edwin Votey in 1895 and looked like a large cabinet attached to the front of a regular piano.  Votey's piano was operated using foot pedals that created suction which turned a perforated paper roll.  The perforations on the paper roll represented the notes to be played.  Traditional player pianos are operated with foot pedals, like Votey's model, to control tempo and volume, but reproducing player pianos are fully automated and can control the tempo and dynamics of the music without the aid of human-operated pedals.\r You remember that reproducing player pianos require electricity to work so you look around the piano for an electric cord connecting the piano to an outlet.  After your second turn around the piano you don't see any way that it could be connected to the electricity, yet the keys keep moving and the song keeps playing.\r You reason that the lack of light in the room must be why you can't find the piano cord.  As you're about to commence your third pass around the piano, you hear the floor suddenly creak behind you!\r (Question by Kaddarsgirl) \n"}, {"text": "Upon hearing the floor creak, you turn around swiftly, heart pounding, not knowing who-- or WHAT-- you would find standing in the doorway.\n\nNothing is there! You head to the doorway and peer out into the hallway, again to find no trace of anything to have made the floor creak.\n\nYou finally decide the noise you heard was a natural occurrence. Is this a logical assumption?", "correct": "Yes, all houses 'settle', creaking and squeaking as they do so.", "options": ["No, creaking sounds are only caused by animals; it was probably a raccoon.", "Yes, in stormy weather, floorboards tend to contract and expand in response, creating a creaking sound.", "No, the house is haunted. Ghosts are in the room."], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes, all houses 'settle', creaking and squeaking as they do so.\n\n\tHouses settle for a variety of reasons, so you are convinced this was the culprit of the creaky floors. Perhaps the soil foundation wasn't quite perfect; An air pocket caused by decaying material may have collapsed; Or, since it's stormy outside, some water may have found its way underneath the house.\r You inspect all the floorboards to be sure of your theory and nothing creaks. You are about to commit to your 'settling' theory when you step on a small rug and hear creaking and metal clanging. Underneath the rug is a small door.\r You can barely hear it over the piano, but you can just make out sounds of ghostly howls coming from inside the hatch...\r (Question by Salami_swami) \n"}, {"text": "Ghostly howls echo beneath the floor; you wonder if the soiree is haunted or if the soprano ate something which disagreed with her. You need to find out and quickly, for whatever is making that noise must be in pain.\n\nYou rip open the trap door with a mighty heave to rescue whatever poor creature is beneath ... but sadly, oh how your heart breaks, you are too late; there in the cellar are the dismembered remains of a creature beloved of Beatrix Potter and children everywhere. It's a limbless lagomorph whose feet have been taken as lucky charms. However, according to American superstition, only one rabbit's foot is supposed to be lucky - which foot is it?", "correct": "left hind foot", "options": ["right fore foot", "right hind foot", "left fore foot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nleft hind foot.\n\n\tNo one is exactly sure where the superstition that a rabbit's foot is lucky came from, suffice it to say that the idea has been around for more than two thousand years. In Europe, the Celts believed that because rabbits lived underground they must have a direct link to the gods of the underworld and this concept dates back to around 600 BC. In China, rabbits are associated with prosperity and their ability to breed quickly and often made them a symbol of fertility and abundance. In North America, some people claim that the custom originated in African-American folk magic or hoodoo. \r Whatever the derivation, in the late nineteenth century in North America the rabbit's foot came to be associated with good luck. However, it can't be just any old foot, it has to be the left hind foot of a rabbit shot or caught in a cemetery at the right phase of the moon, by a cross-eyed man on Friday 13th.\r Suddenly you feel the rabbit stirring as you stroke it, it lives! \"Come closer,\" it says, \"I need to tell you a secret about the soiree. There will be music everywhere. There'll be laughing, singing, and music swinging...\" With that the poor rabbit closes its eyes for the last time, but wait! You can hear noises on the floor above, the muffled strains of... you rush upstairs to investigate.\r (Question by Flopsymopsy) \n"}, {"text": "Startled by the muffled sounds coming from the floor above, you ascend the staircase and emerge from the trap door. The noise has stopped, and an eerie silence has filled the room. \n\nLooking around, you find no sign of anyone, save for a set of shoeprints on the dusty floorboards heading towards a closed door. Hang on a minute. They can't be yours; they're bigger. Upon closer inspection, you see the shoeprints are two different sizes; one is slightly larger than the other. They're fresh too. Someone was here just moments ago.\n\nAs you gather your wits, you wonder who might have shoes in two different sizes. If they had got the shoes in the UK, what outdated unit of measurement would have been used to differentiate between shoe sizes?", "correct": "Barleycorn", "options": ["Cubit", "Ligne", "Perch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarleycorn.\n\n\tThe barleycorn unit of measurement was common in Anglo-Saxon England and was aptly defined as being the length of a grain of barley. With the introduction of more precise measurement systems (like the Imperial system), a barleycorn was redefined as being one-third of an inch (though, strictly speaking, it was first measured as being 1/108th of a yardstick). British shoemakers continued to use the barleycorn well after the Imperial system became the standard form of measurement. Each successive shoe size would be one barleycorn longer than the last, making, for example, a size 8 one barleycorn longer than a size 7.\r You notice the footprints lead towards a door. Carefully, you follow them and place a hand on the doorknob. It's cold to the touch. You slowly turn the knob and open the door just a crack, peering through into the darkness. It looks like this is the kitchen. You take a deep breath and step inside!\r (Question by Eburge) \n"}, {"text": "You've decided that you want to get out of this nightmare when you realize that you are lost in the maze of corridors and rooms. There are doors that lead nowhere and pointless flights of stairs. There are even windows in walls that do not face outside. The dank smell of mold and death fills the air. Shaking with fear and confusion, you contemplate how to escape. \n\nSuddenly, you realized that this dank, mystifying edifice could be designed after which of these of famous places? ", "correct": "The Winchester Home in San Jose, California", "options": ["The Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Canada", "The Campbell Street Gaol in Hobart, Tasmania", "The Castle Fraser in Aberdeenshire, Scotland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Winchester Home in San Jose, California.\n\n\tAll of these marvelous buildings are believed to be haunted or to have paranormal aspects about them, but the only one that has doors going nowhere, flights of stairs that lead to the ceiling and windows on inside walls is the mysterious Winchester Home in San Jose, California. Found inside this eccentric residence are miles of twisting corridors with secret passages in the walls. At one time the home contained over 500 rooms, but only contained one functioning bathroom. When taking a tour of this unique edifice it is vitally important to stay with the tour group as wanderers have been known to become lost for hours. \r This knowledge fills you with terror as you contemplate how to make your escape. The sounds of whispering and moaning start to follow you. Where are you going to go? What is going to happen next? What horror is awaiting you around the next corner?\r (Question by Dcpddc478) \n"}, {"text": "The whispering and moaning that seems to be following you begins to take on a more recognizable sound as you approach the east wing of the mansion.  You suddenly realize that an ominous thumping noise has overtaken the moaning, which has itself transformed into a reverberating vocal melody.  Around the edges of the door to your front you can make out flashing lights and wisps of smoke.\n\nAs you cautiously approach, the door is flung open and you witness a horror you thought long-dead.  Despite trying to avert your eyes, you cannot unsee the sequins, wide lapels (complete with chest hair) and polyester.\n\nWhat have you discovered?", "correct": "A disco", "options": ["A hoedown", "A jazz club", "A flash mob"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA disco.\n\n\tDisco grew from the amalgamation of a number of styles of music, but the term itself had its origins from a French nightclub that opened in 1942 called 'La Discotheque' that actually had a turntable for the music instead of a live band!  The word 'discotheque' soon came to mean any club where there was no live music played.  Dancing evolved from partners to solo dancing, and people began to get a little crazy and flamboyant in their self-expression on the dance floor.\r Disco came into its own in the early 1970s, with clubs like Studio 54 being the place to be seen in all your gaudy disco fashion.  Disco fever ramped up in the mid-1970s, reaching a peak with the release of \"Saturday Night Fever\" in 1977, featuring music by the Bee Gees.\r You try to run from the horror before you, but someone (or something) grabs your arm and drags you into the room.  Sound and light blasts you from all sides and you are quickly overwhelmed.  You slide down to the floor, and unconsciousness claims you...\r As you come to, you find yourself lying comfortably on a luxurious bed, the room dimly lit with candles.  You try to make sense of it all.  But can you?\r (Question by Reedy) \n"}, {"text": "Candlelight is usually considered romantic, but this lighting is just spookily dim.  And the heating doesn't seem to be functioning, as it is quite chilly.  \n\nMaybe you can feel safer if you pull the curtains hanging around the edges of the bed closed.  What is the name for this type of bed with enclosing drapery?", "correct": "Canopy bed", "options": ["Marquis bed", "Trundle bed", "Tent bed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanopy bed.\n\n\tA canopy bed has a frame from which curtains can be hung, allowing the bed to be enclosed for privacy or to keep heat in and/or light out.  It's so much easier to sleep in until late morning when the drapes keep you in the dark!  It's even more effective if you have servants to fling the curtains wide and serve you breakfast in bed.  A canopy bed may or may not also have a cover over its top. \r Drawing the curtains has only made things worse-- not only is it dark inside the enclosed space, the sense of a chilling presence has actually increased!  Could it be a ghost?  It's hard to tell what's going on without any light, but you know it's not safe to bring candles inside the curtain for fear of setting the bedding alight.  What to do?\r (Question by Looney_Tunes) \n"}, {"text": "As the candles slowly burn outside, you are amazed at their different types.  From one of the candles, the smell of rotting flesh emanates. You realize that it must be a scented candle.\n\nLooking around you can see that wax is dripping from all of the candles, especially the pillar one.  A shiny silver candelabra has four narrow candles in it, all flickering. You scratch your head trying to remember the name of those candles. Finally, it comes to you. Do you remember what the name of that candle is?", "correct": "Taper Candle", "options": ["Votive Candle", "Floating Candle ", "Luminaria Candle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTaper Candle.\n\n\tA votive candle is usually burned in a heat resistant container. This type of candle is usually on 2 1/2\" tall. The luminaria candle is designed for outside use and is surrounded by sand in a container. The floating candle is placed in a container of water or liquid (non-flammable) and simply floats on top. The taper candle is the candle designed specifically for a candelabrum. Candles probably originated with the ancient Egyptians who used reeds in which the pith was soaked in animal fat for lights.\r Rotting flesh isn't your ideal choice of fragrance, but who are you to complain of your mysteriously absent host's tastes, especially considering the night thus far?  As he hasn't appeared, and you've been wandering the house for what seems like hours (even fading in and out of consciousness for how long?), you figure it's time to leave.  So you exit the room, find the hall, and make your way back to the foyer when, to your shock...!\r (Question by Emma058) \n"}, {"text": "You return to the foyer and think to yourself that while this could be such a lovely place, there's no way you could live it up here; the soiree is obviously a bust.  Flagrant disregard for general aesthetic seeps through with every passing glance-- Mirrors on the ceiling?  How tacky!-- and while there's plenty of room to actually host an event, it's clearly being mismanaged in every way.\n\nOver the murmuring of voices in the corridors behind you (though you can't make out what they say), you hear the chimings of...what is that?  ...A mission bell?  Ugh.  This place could most certainly be Hell.\n\nIs a mission bell an actual bell?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tA mission bell is most certainly a real bell.  Used in Roman Catholic missions up and down the California coast by Spanish missionaries during early days of colonization, the bell would be rung in their churches.  Most of these were built in the late eighteenth century in an early attempt to convert Pacific Coast Natives to the leading religion of Spain.  In the centuries following, many of the sites have since been preserved.  You likely wouldn't find them in a hotel...or a mansion.\r \"Are you going somewhere?\" A voice booms from the front door as you make your way down the foyer steps; the bell stops ringing and the voices cease behind you.\r\"I was just about to check out of here.  I couldn't find your party here.\"  You're a bit nervous now.\rYour host smiles.\r\"It's out in the courtyard.  There's dancing, pink champagne...the works.\"\rIt sounds convincing.  You could go for a drink.  Might as well live it up, right?\r (Question by Kyleisalive) \n"}]}
