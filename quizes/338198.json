He had prayed to God asking for wisdom and understanding, and God blessed him with those two things, as well as with riches.  Solomon was also known as having 700 wives and concubines. Read all about him in 1 Kings. \n"}, {"text": "Who would have had this online dating profile?\n\nGender: female\nLooking for: carpenter\nQualities: virgin, pregnant\nInfo: Looking for someone who can help me raise God's son.", "correct": "Mary", "options": ["Miriam", "Martha", "Mary Magdalene"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMary.\n\n\tChristians believe that Mary was the woman that God chose to give birth to his son.  He placed Jesus into Mary's womb, so she was still a virgin when she was pregnant with Jesus.  At the time, her husband Joseph was furious, because he had a tough time believing that she was still a virgin and pregnant.  Eventually, however, he came to see that this was God's doing, and he and his family lived a happy life together. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke tell of Mary's pregnancy and Jesus' birth. \n"}, {"text": "Which Bible character would have written this profile on an online dating site?\n\nGender: male\nLooking for: woman, perhaps two\nInfo: willing to work for seven years for a wife", "correct": "Jacob", "options": ["Isaiah", "Isaac", "Jonah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJacob.\n\n\tJacob, a major figure in the Book of Genesis, told Laban that he would work for him for seven years in order to wed Rachel.  However, Laban tricked Jacob and gave him his older daughter Leah for the work instead.  Therefore, Jacob had to work another seven years in order to get Rachel.  It is interesting to know that Jacob was probably given Leah from the beginning, but still had to work seven years.  At the end of the seven years, Laban gave him Rachel, and THEN he worked another seven years.  He was probably already married to Rachel while he worked for Laban another seven years.\r This means that, though he worked for 14 years for Laban, he actually only worked seven before he married Rachel. \n"}, {"text": "Who would have written this online dating profile?\n\nGender: male\nLooking for: someone to help me name all the animals\nInfo: perhaps God can use my body to create my wife for me", "correct": "Adam", "options": ["Seth", "Abel", "Cain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdam.\n\n\tAdam was the first man in the Bible.  God gave him life by breathing into his nose.  Then Adam was lonely, noticing that all the animals had a mate.  So God created for him a woman using Adam's rib.  It is interesting to know that it was in Genesis 2:18-23 that woman was created.  However, it wasn't until Genesis 3:20 that the woman was actually named.\r \"After this Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she had to become the mother of everyone living.\"  This was after Eve had eaten from the fruit of the tree.  Though it never mentions specifically if Eve had a name before this, this was actually the first mention of her name: after she sinned and became imperfect.\r Before naming her \"Eve\", Adam did indeed call her \"woman\". \n"}, {"text": "Who would have written this in their dating profile?\n\nGender: male\nLooking for: second wife\nInfo: looking for someone who will not turn back.  Someone who will eat bland food, as I don't like salt anymore...", "correct": "Lot", "options": ["Philip", "Paul", "Lazarus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLot.\n\n\tLot was told by God to take his family and flee from Sodom and Gomorrah, because it was going to be destroyed.  He also told his family not to look back.  However, Lot's wife, who is unnamed in the Bible, turned back, and was thus turned into a pillar of salt (Genesis 19).\r The Bible does not say whether or not Lot remarried after his wife turned into salt. \n"}, {"text": "Who would have written this in their profile?\n\nGender: male\nLooking for: some of my sisters; there isn't anyone else I can marry!\nQualities: jealous, murderous, crop-grower", "correct": "Cain", "options": ["Abel", "Adam", "Seth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCain.\n\n\tCain was one of Adam's sons in the Book of Genesis.  When he and Abel both gave offerings to God, Abel gave his finest and fattiest rams to God, and was looked upon with favor.  Cain became jealous that God liked Abel's gift better, possibly because Cain only gave some of his crops that weren't of highest quality.  He was doing it because he was supposed to, not because he loved God.  Cain became so jealous that he killed his brother Abel.\r When Cain married, he, of course, married his sisters (there were no other families to marry into). \n"}, {"text": "Who would the writer of this online dating profile be looking for?\n\nGender: male\nLooking for: someone who will leave the city and live in tents in the wilderness with me\nQualities: will be known as God's friend, will make a covenant with God\n\nNOTE: The gender is male, but I want to know who he will be looking for.", "correct": "Sarah", "options": ["Rachel", "Elizabeth", "Hannah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSarah.\n\n\tIn Genesis, Abram and Sarai left their city to live in the wilderness in tents, and though it was Abram's decision, Sarai supported it.  Later on in life, God had their names changed to Abraham and Sarah.  Sarah was barren until she was 90 years old and Abraham was 100.  It was then that Sarah gave birth to Isaac. \n"}, {"text": "Who would have written this online dating profile, had there been such places in Bible times?\n\nGender: male\nLooking for: someone faithful who loves long hair\nQualities: very strong, once killed a lion with my bare hands", "correct": "Samson", "options": ["Daniel", "Samuel", "Nebuchadnezzar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSamson.\n\n\tSamson, whose story is in the Book of Judges, was known for being extremely strong, which was given to him through his hair.

Job stayed faithful, though, sick and alone, and was rewarded in the end with even more than he had before. \n"}, {"text": "Who would have written this online dating profile?\n\nGender: male\nLooking for: someone to keep me warm at night\nInfo: I may be old, but I am a great king, and I can play the harp beautifully.

He had repented and God forgave him.  Later in life, in his old age, he wanted a young woman to keep him warm at night (1 Kings 1).  In fact, he had even said \"bring her to me\".  Before he was king, David played the harp for Saul, because it calmed him (until, of course, Saul got so jealous of David that he tried to kill him instead). \n"}]}
