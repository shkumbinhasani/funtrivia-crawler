In fact, that's literally true: you could swear that they've all faced off against Rocky Balboa at one time or another. But which one was his opponent in the very first \"Rocky\" movie?", "correct": "Apollo Creed", "options": ["Ivan Drago", "Clubber Lang", "Mason Dixon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApollo Creed.\n\n\tRocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, is an uneducated but golden-hearted Philadelphia man who finds success as a boxer, \"going the distance\" with world champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in \"Rocky\" (1976). The two have a rematch in 1979's \"Rocky II\", but become friends in 1982's \"Rocky III\". Rocky's main rival in that movie is Clubber Lang (Mr. T), followed by Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) in \"Rocky IV\" (1985), Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) in \"Rocky V\" (1990), and Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) in \"Rocky Balboa\" (2006). \n"}, {"text": "There are no elaborate booby traps at tonight's event: famed adventurer Indiana Jones is off duty. You have no such luck -- four of Indy's costars are trying to sneak in, but only one is from the first movie in the series. Which of these characters appeared in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981)?", "correct": "Marion Ravenwood", "options": ["Elsa Schneider", "Mola Ram", "Henry Jones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarion Ravenwood.\n\n\tMarion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is the love interest for daring archaeologist Indy (Harrison Ford) in both the series' first movie and its fourth, 2008's \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\". After her tavern in Nepal is set on fire (during a fight with Nazis, naturally) in the first film, she joins forces with Indy in the search for the Ark of the Covenant. In the fourth movie, they are again partners in adventure, this time with their 20-year-old son -- whose existence is a big surprise to Indy. The couple weds at the conclusion of the film.\r Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) is the villain in the second movie, 1984's \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\". Henry Jones (Sean Connery), Indy's father, doesn't appear until the third film, \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (1989); in that film, Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) begins as a romantic interest but is soon revealed to be working for the Nazis. \n"}, {"text": "Here come four ... toys? You rub your eyes and realize you're looking at four stars of the \"Toy Story\" series. Three of them have been with the franchise from the first film, but one was only introduced later on. Which is the odd one out?", "correct": "Jessie, the Yodeling Cowgirl", "options": ["Woody", "Buzz Lightyear", "Slinky Dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJessie, the Yodeling Cowgirl.\n\n\t\"Toy Story\" (1995), a children's movie animated entirely with computers, was Pixar's first full-length movie. It tells the tale of a group of toys owned by a boy named Andy. When the child isn't looking, the toys get into all kinds of trouble! A talking cowboy toy named Woody (Tom Hanks) and the aptly named Slinky Dog (Jim Varney and, later, Blake Clark) are present from the beginning of the film, but the arrival of a new astronaut toy -- Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) throws their world into upheaval.\r Jessie (Joan Cusak) joins the cast in \"Toy Story 2\" (1999), meeting Woody when he is kidnapped by a toy collector; she and Woody are toys based on the same fictional T.V. show. \n"}, {"text": "There's a scuffle in the line, and you head over to break it up. \"I won't be in the same room as HIM,\" a character from the \"Matrix\" trilogy bites out. Maybe that won't be necessary. Which of these characters is NOT from the first movie, \"The Matrix\" (1999)?", "correct": "Link", "options": ["Cypher", "Agent Smith", "Morpheus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLink.\n\n\tLink (Harold Perrineau) turns up in the second two movies in the trilogy, \"The Matrix: Reloaded\" (2003) and \"The Matrix: Revolutions\" (also 2003); he's the operator on Morpheus's ship, replacing his brother-in-law Tank (who died in the aftermath of the first movie). Neither he nor Morpheus (a resistance leader played by Laurence Fishburne) would be thrilled to socialize with Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), a computer program that polices the machine-run virtual prison of the Matrix -- or with Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), the human resistance fighter who betrays his comrades in the first part of the trilogy.Let's hope these three can avoid each other inside the party. \n"}, {"text": "Here's another group all together: co-stars from the \"Bill and Ted\" movies. One of them is going to be disappointed, though. Which one of these characters does NOT appear in the first film of the series, \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\"?", "correct": "Station", "options": ["Rufus", "Princess Elizabeth", "The beautiful Missy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStation.\n\n\tThe \"Bill and Ted\" movies tell the story of two dimwitted but lovable teenagers, played by Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves, destined to form a band that will change the world. (Future world motto: \"Be excellent to each other.\") In \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" (1989), the very beautiful (and very young) Missy (Amy Stock-Poynton) is married to Bill's dad. Rufus (George Carlin) comes from the future to give the boys a time-traveling telephone booth so that they can pass their history class. Along the way, they rescue Princess Elizabeth (Kimberley LaBelle and later Annette Azcuy) and her sister, their future brides, from distasteful arranged marriages.\r Station, however, doesn't show up until the second movie, 1991's \"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey\" (in which the very beautiful (and very young) Missy is now married to Ted's dad). He's a brilliant Martian scientist whom Bill and Ted pick up in the afterlife (it's a long story). Sometimes he has one body and sometimes he has two, but he always knows just what to say, and it's what he tells you kindly as you turn him away: \"Station.\" \n"}, {"text": "Hundreds of thousands met in battle at Gondor in \"The Return of the King\", the final installment of \"The Lord of the Rings\". Four of them are making their way toward you now, but only one of them was introduced in the beginning of the series, \"The Fellowship of the Ring\". Which one is it?", "correct": "Aragorn", "options": ["Faramir", "Eowyn", "Theoden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAragorn.\n\n\tThe movie versions of J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" novels were released to great acclaim in 2001, 2002, and 2003, garnering some 17 Academy Awards. The story centers on Frodo the Hobbit (Elijah Wood) and his efforts to destroy the Ring of Power. As a sideline, the Battle of Gondor distracts the enemy and brings Frodo's ally Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) to his ancestral throne.\r The other three are all introduced in the second film, \"The Two Towers\". Theoden (Bernard Hill) is King of Rohan; his niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) poses as a man to join her people's warriors in the final battle. Faramir (David Wenham), son of Gondor's Steward, is injured in an early mission and nearly killed by his insane father. Plenty of drama in this film series! \n"}, {"text": "Uh-oh, here's a tough one: four characters hailing from the \"Star Wars\" movies. Which film counts as the first part: the one called \"Episode I\", or the one that was the first to be made? No matter: one of these characters was in BOTH movies. Which one?", "correct": "Obi-Wan Kenobi", "options": ["Jar-Jar Binks", "Luke Skywalker", "Chewbacca"], "explanation": "\n\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi.\n\n\tThe first \"Star Wars\" movie -- which was simply called \"Star Wars\" at the time, although \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" was later appended to its title -- burst into theaters in 1977, awing audiences with its myth-like tale of good and evil, its plucky heroes, and its cutting-edge special effects. In that film Obi-Wan Kenobi is a wise old Jedi played by Sir Alec Guinness, who helps Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) come into his own. Obi-Wan's death in a duel with the evil Darth Vader is the emotional climax of the movie.\r In the 1999 prequel movie \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\", we see Obi-Wan -- now played by Ewan MacGregor -- as a brash young man who sees his own mentor slain in a lightsaber duel. This time, however, the audiences' grief was mostly for the lackluster plot and embarrassing characterizations.\r Of the other choices, Luke Skywalker is the hero of Episodes IV through VI, backed up by (among others) Chewbacca. The luckless Jar-Jar Binks, meanwhile, became a symbol of all that was wrong with Episodes I through III. \n"}, {"text": "Over seven books and eight films, Harry Potter has battled evil with the aid of classmates, teachers, friends, and numerous magical creatures. In fact, many of them are here now, but only one belongs. Which Hogwarts student was with Harry from the very beginning: his 2001 film debut \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"?", "correct": "Neville Longbottom", "options": ["Cedric Diggory", "Luna Lovegood", "Cho Chang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeville Longbottom.\n\n\tNeville (Matthew Lewis) is introduced as an awkward kid without much magical ability. As the series progresses, he finds in himself great courage and loyalty, as well as his magical strengths.\r Both Cho Chang (Katie Leung) and Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) are introduced in the fourth film, 2005's \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\"; the slightly daffy Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) first appears one movie later, in 2007's \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\". Each has a role to play in the eight-movie fight against Voldemort -- but Neville's the only one with a seat at this party. It's lucky for you the others have left their wands at home! \n"}, {"text": "Our hosts are a little worried about the next film franchise: it involves a lot of unsavory characters who might get rough at the party. Let's limit their numbers. Which of these characters appeared ONLY in the first \"Godfather\" film in 1972, and not in either of its sequels?", "correct": "Moe Greene", "options": ["Vito Corleone", "Tom Hagen", "Kay Adams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoe Greene.\n\n\tThe \"Godfather\" trilogy traces the evolution of the Corleone family in the United States. Don Vito Corleone, played as an old man by Marlon Brando in \"The Godfather\" and as a young man by Robert De Niro in \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974), is the founder and head of this Mafia outfit; the mantle eventually passes to his son Michael (Al Pacino). Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is consigliere to both dons in the first two films; Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) marries Michael in the first movie, divorces him in the second, and appears again in the third.\r Moe Greene (Alex Rocco) is a gangster and Corleone associate based on the historical Bugsy Siegel. He's a Las Vegas impresario whose falling-out with Michael proves fatal: no \"Part II\" for him. \n"}, {"text": "Okay, we're in trouble: no fewer than four James Bonds have just appeared, and they all want to get in to the party. The first Bond movie, \"Dr. No\", came out in 1962; which famous actor played the British super-spy in that film?", "correct": "Sean Connery", "options": ["Daniel Craig", "Roger Moore", "Pierce Brosnan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Connery.\n\n\tThat's right: the only Bond with an invitation is the one with a close resemblance to the raspy-voiced Scot. Connery played James Bond in seven films, the last in 1983 for a different studio; George Lazenby took over the role for one film in 1969.\r The other actors listed stepped into Bond's tuxedo much later: Roger Moore from 1973 to 1985, Pierce Brosnan from 1995 to 2002, and Daniel Craig beginning in 2006. Be very polite when you deny them entry -- and don't offer up stirred martinis as consolation prizes! \n"}]}
