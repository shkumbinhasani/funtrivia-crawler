The wall on \"Wipeout\" randomly throws punches to the contestants over and over, attempting to knock them in the mud.  This works most of the time, but there have been a few times where players make it through without making it to the mud. \n"}, {"text": "What is the obstacle, in the qualifier round of \"Wipeout,\" where players try to bounce across to the final obstacle called?", "correct": "Big Balls", "options": ["None of these", "Bouncy Balls", "Blue Balls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig Balls.\n\n\tThe \"Big Balls\" are red, not blue!

This is John and John's favorite obstacle. \n"}, {"text": "What is the total amount a player could win from the first season \"Wipeout?\"", "correct": "$51,000", "options": ["$49,000", "$50,000", "$52,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$51,000.\n\n\tDuring the \"Sweeper\" round, players jump over a bar until there are six remaining to move on.

All players do is slide down a giant slide into the water.  It may be easy and quick, but it can knock the wind out of you.  The next obstacle is the \"Barrel Run.\"  Here players must jump over barrels until they make it to the wall, cross it, and make it to the \"Spinner.\"  This is the most difficult obstacle and has caused the most wipeouts. Once players make it past the \"Spinner,\" the final obstacle lies ahead: the \"Launch Pads.\"  There are four trampolines situated at different heights, and once players make it across, they must land on the platform seven feet away from the last trampoline, and stand on the lighted circle on the platform. They are then declared the winner, if they have beat the other three players' scores. \n"}, {"text": "What is the winner of the final round of \"Wipeout\" known as?", "correct": "Wipeout Champion", "options": ["Wipeout Great", "Wipeout Winner", "Wipeout Player"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWipeout Champion.\n\n\tThe \"Wipeout Champion\" is crowned at the end of every episode.  The winner is the one who has the fastest time of the four final players in the \"Wipeout Zone.\"  They are rewarded with $50,000.  Besides the money, the \"Wipeout Champion\" also wins bragging rights. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of every episode of \"Wipeout,\" what does one host always say?", "correct": "Good night... and big balls.", "options": ["Good night... and blue balls.", "Good night... and good night again!", "Good night... and bouncy balls."], "explanation": "\n\n\nGood night... and big balls.\n\n\tJohn Henson always closes with the mention of the \"Big Balls.\"  This is his favorite obstacle.  The phrase is a spoof of \"Good night and good luck,\" a phrase spoken by Edward R. Murrow. \n"}, {"text": "Who had a \"Wipeout\" named after them?", "correct": "Jacob Mann", "options": ["Richard Gale", "Ben Kronberg", "David Matz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJacob Mann.\n\n\tJacob Mann was on the fifth episode of season one of \"Wipeout.\"  While he was on the \"Big Balls,\" he did the splits on the second one!  John and John replayed this over and over.  Now every time someone does the splits, mainly male, they call it the \"Jacob Mann.\"  Mann placed twelfth in the qualifier, sixth on the sweeper, and quit during the semi-finals.  He even threw up his lunch because of that \"Dizzy Dummy!\"  All four named mentioned were from the fifth episode of season one. \n"}]}
