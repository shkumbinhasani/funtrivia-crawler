{"id": "398430", "name": "The British Open : 2010s Quiz | Tournaments | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "Tournaments", "   British Open"], "questions": [{"text": "The Open returned to the home of golf, St Andrews, in 2010. Which unheralded South African golfer won his first major with a resounding seven stroke victory over Lee Westwood?", "correct": "Louis Oosthuizen", "options": ["Charl Schwartzel", "Richard Sterne", "Branden Grace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLouis Oosthuizen.\n\n\tOosthuizen had only ever made one cut in his previous major career so certainly wasn't one of the favourties at the start of play. An opening 65 saw him  trail Rory McIlroy by two shots, but, with the Northern Irishman having a disastrous Friday, Oosthuizen shot 67 to lead by five strokes over Mark Calcavecchia at the halfway mark. He never looked like collapsing over the weekend, and closing  scores of 69 and 71 saw him lift the Claret Jug. \n"}, {"text": "The 2011 championship at Sandwich saw which 42-year-old win his first Claret Jug, at the 20th attempt? ", "correct": "Darren Clarke", "options": ["Davis Love III", "Colin Montgomerie", "Miguel Angel Jimenez"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarren Clarke.\n\n\tClarke, from Northern Ireland, had finished in the top 10 on three previous Open visits, but it looked like the main prize had passed him by until he arrived at Royal St George's in 2011. Three sub-70 rounds saw him tee off on Sunday with a single stroke lead over Dustin Johnson.  A final round of 70 was enough for a three stroke victory over Johnson and Phil Mickelson. \n"}, {"text": "Which golfer won his first Open title for a decade at Royal Lytham in 2012?", "correct": "Ernie Els", "options": ["David Duval", "Tiger Woods", "Justin Leonard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErnie Els.\n\n\tEls had previously won the title at Muirfield in 2002 but came to Royal Lytham in 2012 having failed to make the cut in his previous two Opens.

At Muirfield, he started  the final round five shots behind Lee Westwood. Whilst the Englishman fell away with a 75 on the Sunday, Mickelson shot a 66 to win the title by three shots from Henrik Stenson. \n"}, {"text": "The 2014 Open was held at Royal Liverpool and resulted in a wire-to-wire victory for which European golfer?", "correct": "Rory McIlroy", "options": ["Martin Kaymer", "Sergio Garcia", "Ian Poulter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRory McIlroy.\n\n\tMcIlroy already had a US Open and  PGA title on his CV when he arrived at Royal Liverpool in 2014. He opened with a 66 and added further rounds of 66, 68 and 71 to win by two strokes from Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler.

Dunne fell away on the Sunday, but Leishman and Johnson both shot 66 to tie Oosthuizen who shot 69, whilst Day's 70 was one too many. The four-hole  play-off saw Johnson triumph to lift his first Claret Jug. \n"}, {"text": "The 2016 Open at Royal Troon saw a first-ever champion from which country?", "correct": "Sweden", "options": ["Canada", "Japan", "Germany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSweden.\n\n\tHenrik Stenson of Sweden was involved in a head-to-head shoot-out with Phil Mickelson over the weekend.
