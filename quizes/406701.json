{"id": "406701", "name": "\"Canada's Drag Race\" - Season 2 Online Trivia | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "RuPaul's Drag Race"], "questions": [{"text": "How many queens participated in this season of \"Canada's Drag Race\"?", "correct": "Twelve & 12", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelve & 12.\n\n\tAs with the first season, \"Canada's Drag Race\" brought a dozen queens from across Canada into the werq-room for the chance at the grand prize.  Compared to season one, this season saw more queens featured from British Columbia and Quebec and significantly less from Ontario (the home of season one winner, Priyanka).  The season was completed across ten episodes, much like the first, with an elimination held every episode. \n"}, {"text": "This season saw a shake-up on the judging panel.  Who was not introduced as a rotating judge for this season?", "correct": "Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman", "options": ["Traci Melchor", "Amanda Brugel", "Brad Goreski"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeffrey Bowyer-Chapman.\n\n\tAlthough Brooke Lynn Hytes returned as the host of \"Canada's Drag Race\", neither of the first season's judges, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman or Stacey Mackenzie, came back to the panel for this sophomore season.  Instead, Brooke was joined by fashion stylist Brad Goreski, Canadian actress Amanda Brugel (of \"The Handmaid's Tale\"), and Canada's Squirrel Friend, Traci Melchor, who appeared periodically in the previous season.  Though Brad was present for every week, Amanda and Traci alternated (depending on the week) until the finale. \n"}, {"text": "This season's Rusical, held early in the competition, was themed around which of the following?", "correct": "The circus", "options": ["Politics", "COVID-19", "The RCMP"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe circus.\n\n\tPerhaps in a nod to Cirque du Soleil, the second episode of the season forced the eleven remaining queens to learn complex roles and sing live to a series of choreographed songs themed around circus clowns (including some meant to mimic Pennywise the Clown and...well...Bianca Del Rio).  Following this, the queens hit the runway in Circus Berserkus garments (most of which were couture in nature).  Pythia won the episode while Icesis Couture and Oc\u00e9ane Aqua-Black fell to the bottom (with the latter getting sent packing). \n"}, {"text": "The top ten queens completed an acting challenge in episode three.  Titled 'Screech', it was which of the following?", "correct": "A horror sketch", "options": ["A 'Heritage Moment'", "A rowdy sex comedy", "A high school drama"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA horror sketch.\n\n\tMeant to parody \"Scream\", 'Screech' put the queens into cliche roles typically found in a slasher flick and pushed them to exaggerate their acting chops to get noticed on the mainstage.  All of this led to a runway presentation of their best take on 'Good Girl Gone Bad' in front of guest judge Fefe Dobson.  Adriana won this episode playing a spookier version of Brad Goreski on the faux judging panel while Stephanie Prince and Synthia Kiss were put in the bottom to sing to guest judge Dobson's track \"Ghost\".  It sent Stephanie Prince home. \n"}, {"text": "The song \"Bye Flop\" was performed in which genre in the season's fifth episode?", "correct": "Country pop", "options": ["Rap", "Showtune", "Dance pop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCountry pop.\n\n\tAfter a safe sex-themed mini-challenge, the queens were put into two teams of four for the pop group challenge of the season.  This time, they were given the original song \"Bye Flop\" for which they needed to dress the part, choreograph a number, and write unique lyrics in a country pop styling to be performed for the judges. It was the Giddy Girls against the Dosey Hoes with the former winning the episode (and Gia Metric taking the top honours).  Synthia Kiss lip synched against Eve 6000 to Bif Naked's \"I Love Myself Today\" (in front of the singer as a guest judge) and the latter went home after her second consecutive week in the bottom. \n"}, {"text": "This season's ball episode was themed around which of the following?", "correct": "The seven deadly sins", "options": ["Celine Dion", "The zodiac", "The colours of the rainbow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe seven deadly sins.\n\n\tIt was the top seven who were tasked with being participants in the Sinner's Ball in episode six, and it was then that they had to turn out three separate looks for the runway, the first being Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll, the second being a look that was Ugly as Sin, and the last one being a new garment themed around one of the Seven Deadly Sins as provided by the mini-challenge winner (which ended up being Icesis Couture).  After bringing their looks to the mainstage, Icesis Couture won the main challenge as well while Kendall Gender and Synthia Kiss fell to the bottom. After her third time lip syncing for her life, Synthia was sent packing. \n"}, {"text": "For this season's makeover challenge, the top five queens made over which of the following?", "correct": "LGBTQ+ teens", "options": ["Members of the medical community", "Family members", "Former contestants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLGBTQ+ teens.\n\n\tThe final five, all having won challenges, finally got the opportunity to face off in the season's makeover challenge in what they expected to be the penultimate take to the runway.  This time, after receiving messages from home, the queens were met by LGBTQ+ teens and told that they would be setting them up for prom.  In addition to needing to create outfits (from scratch) for their new drag daughters, they had to act as drag moms, chaperoning the guests on the main stage.  Icesis and Adriana were brought to the bottom and forced to lip sync; Adriana was sent home in fifth place. \n"}, {"text": "In a surprise twist, all of the queens returned for a reunion episode before the finale wherein what happened?", "correct": "The top four had to lip sync for their lives", "options": ["The eliminated queens had to vote for the winner", "One queen returned to the competition", "The eliminated queens had to vote to eliminate a remaining queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe top four had to lip sync for their lives.\n\n\tImmediately after wrapping the eighth week of the competition, the top four queens were informed of a last hurdle (or a few, rather) before the finale.  Brad Goreski hosted the unexpectedly early reunion episode, allowing the queens to spill the tea before the final four were pitted against each other in a lip synch bracket. Facing off at random and performing classic RuPaul songs, the judges pushed Kendall Gender and Icesis Couture straight to the finale on the first song and made Pythia and Gia Metric take one more chance to \"Call Me Mother\".  Ultimately, Pythia rounded out the top three and Gia was eliminated before the last finale. \n"}, {"text": "For their final challenge, the top three queens were required to write their own lyrics to a RuPaul song.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThough most \"Drag Race\" finales of the era had the queens take over a RuPaul track, creating lyrics and choreography for the single du jour, this was the first instance in which another queen's track was the basis for the finale challenge.  Instead, the top three were asked to write lyrics to accompany Brooke Lynn Hytes' first single, \"Queen of the North\", to be performed on the main stage for the judging panel.  It wouldn't be the end though; they would still have to hit the main stage for a final runway after this climactic moment. \n"}, {"text": "Which queen won \"Canada's Drag Race\" season two?", "correct": "Icesis Couture", "options": ["Kendall Gender", "Gia Metric", "Pythia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIcesis Couture.\n\n\tAfter their final challenge on the main stage, the top three hit the runway in their Coronation Eleganza and received their final critiques.  It wasn't the end though; the queens had one last lip synch, this time for the crown.  With one last song, Celine Dion's \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\", the queens allowed the judges to finalize their votes and decide upon the winner of \"Canada's Drag Race\" season two: Icesis Couture.  Icesis won the crown, the sceptre, a sickening supply of beauty products from Shopper's Drug Mart, and the $100,000 CAD grand prize. \n"}]}
