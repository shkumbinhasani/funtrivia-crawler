{"id": "375927", "name": "FunTrivia Scouts Visit Public Safety Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Occupations for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "Sitting down with the Police Chief, the scouts are told that he'll tell them about all the jobs in the department. First up, who is the person whose job it is to investigate major crimes such as bank robberies, deaths and muggings?", "correct": "Detective", "options": ["Forensic Investigator", "Beat Cop", "Warden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDetective.\n\n\tDetectives are called out to investigate crimes after the initial officers arrive and determine if it's important enough to warrant further resources. While most officers wear uniforms, detectives are more often in a suit and tie. \n"}, {"text": "The next police job is a bit simpler, though just as important. This person patrols neighborhoods and responds to calls and crimes as they happen.", "correct": "Patrol Officer", "options": ["Captain", "Dispatcher", "Ordinance Officer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatrol Officer.\n\n\tThe patrol officer is the entry level job in law enforcement at most departments. Patrol officers can walk, ride bicycles, motorcycles or horses, drive vehicles or get around in a number of other forms of transport. They are the most common type of officer seen by the public. \n"}, {"text": "Now the chief is talking about the people that field calls from the public and tell the other officers where to go. Which job title is he describing?", "correct": "Dispatcher", "options": ["Assignment Desk Technician", "Rookie Officer", "Chief (himself)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDispatcher.\n\n\tDispatchers aren't always sworn-in officers, and some departments use civilians (people who aren't police officers) in this area. Without a dispatcher, officers wouldn't be able to respond to areas of need as quickly as they do. \n"}, {"text": "The next stop on our tour takes us to a room full of filing cabinets and computers. Within the filing cabinets are stacks and stacks of files with records of everything the police officers have done in the past in them.\nWhat is this room more commonly known as?", "correct": "Records Room", "options": ["Dispatch Center", "Lavatory", "Jail Cell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRecords Room.\n\n\tThe records room is in some ways the hub of the department. It is typically run by civilians (or not sworn-in officers), although some departments use full-time officers. Within this department is the history of the department's actions through records of old police reports.\r The records department is also where copies of civilian complaints, registers of residents who own a gun and other department paperwork are kept.\rIt is through this department that Freedom of Information requests are processed for anyone requesting data from the police. \n"}, {"text": "It is impossible for the same person to serve as the Police and Fire Chief at the same time in a US city.", "correct": "false", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfalse.\n\n\tNot only is it possible, but entirely probable depending on the size of the American city or township. As the need to save money in administrative costs crept up in the early parts of the 21st century, many government agencies started consolidating job titles.\r Public Safety Directors were created to head both the Police and Fire Departments in smaller communities. These job titles typically serve as the chief of both departments while leaving day-to-day operations to a deputy chief or other command staff member. \n"}, {"text": "The police chief had to run, but just at that moment the fire chief walked in.  He's going to show us his department for the rest of the day.\n\nThe first thing we get to see is the fire truck. The person who keeps this truck in working order isn't known as a mechanic, but as what?\n", "correct": "Engineer", "options": ["First Responder", "Deputy Fire Chief", "Fire Inspector"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEngineer.\n\n\tThe engineers are a mid-level job within most fire departments. They haven't risen to management levels yet, but are recognized with more responsibilities than typical entry level firefighters. \n"}, {"text": "Oh no, while we're talking to him the chief is called out to a house fire. He tells us to hop in the car as he gets in.\n\nWe pull up to the fire to see hordes of people in full fire suppression gear racing toward the house. What is that gear called?", "correct": "Turnout Gear", "options": ["Tutus", "The gear has no official name", "Rain Coats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurnout Gear.\n\n\tTurnout gear includes fire resistant clothes, an oxygen tank, heavy-duty boots and other special safety gear. A typical set weighs in at around 80 pounds. \n"}, {"text": "Heading back to the station after the fire, the deputy chief calls and tells the chief that the EMT unit was just sent to an accident scene.\nWhat does EMT stand for?", "correct": "Emergency Medical Technician", "options": ["Extra Marital Team", "Endless Midnight Time", "Early Morning Training"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmergency Medical Technician.\n\n\tMost full time fire departments in the United States cross-train all of the firefighters as EMTs and staff an ambulance at the fire department.  An EMT can begin early medical treatment of a patient while transporting them to the local hospital, often times saving lives due to faster care. \n"}, {"text": "The chief continues his tour of the department by showing us the \"bunk house.\" What is the primary use of this room?", "correct": "It's a bedroom", "options": ["It's where firefighters workout and train", "It's where meals are prepared", "It's a storage room for equipment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's a bedroom.\n\n\tFirefighters typically work 24-hour shifts, and sometimes for multiple days in a row. Due to this, they have sleeping quarters provided at the station where they can catch a few hours of sleep between assignments when possible. \n"}, {"text": "The last thing the chief shows us is the department mascot. While it's only a costume, not a living breathing animal, it is a recreation of what traditional firehouse pet?", "correct": "Dalmatian Dog", "options": ["Lion", "Tiger", "Siamese Cat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDalmatian Dog.\n\n\tDalmatians were the first \"fire alarms\" for departments in the early 1700s. The dogs would run along beside horse-drawn fire engines and bark as they ran. The dogs also served to help scare off anything that might spook the horses as they ran, ensuring a safe arrival for early firefighters.\r As technology advanced, horses were no longer needed and mechanical sirens were invented, but the dalmatian remained a symbol of the fire department. \n"}]}
