{"id": "199060", "name": "Interesting 'B' Words Quiz | Alphabetical Words | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Alphabetical Words", "Words A - M"], "questions": [{"text": "Based on its alternative definition, which of these names for a person of the male persuasion could alternate for 'Spike'?", "correct": "Brad", "options": ["Brett", "Broderick", "Brian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrad.\n\n\tI have always felt that the name Brad has a snobby edge to it (no offense to the Brads out there who may have taken this quiz).  However, when one considers that the word 'brad' alternatively refers to a type of nail, or spike, the aristocratic edge is somewhat dulled.  So, the next time you meet a man named Brad, feel free to nail him by calling him Spike...he will enjoy it immensely and you will get the satisfaction of knowing that, etymologically speaking, you are pounding out a precision perfect pun. \n"}, {"text": "Is it true that if you are a practicing bricoleur (in the current sense of the word in English), your main occupation involves the laying down of bricks (as in masonry)?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tPerhaps in the original French you might be a bricklayer, after all, the word is a French term for 'handyman'.  However, in modern English usage, the term has come to refer only to those who dabble in the art of bricolage, the creation of artistic and/or literary works using a broad range of materials and/or sources. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most magnificent 'B' words has got to be 'brimstone'.  Is there anything better than listening to a fire and brimstone speech delivered by one's favorite demagogue?  \n\nMore importantly, for the purposes of this quiz at least, to which chemical element does the word brimstone have a connection?", "correct": "Sulphur", "options": ["Platinum", "Arsenic", "Manganese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSulphur.\n\n\tIn the far, far distant past sulphur was referred to as brimstone.  To make sense of this, we must understand the etymology of the word brimstone, which is a shortened combination of the English words 'burning' (OE: bryne) and 'stone'.  The fact that sulphur is easily combustible, and does not smell all that pleasant, made brimstone an apt name for it, and this also explains its connection with hellfire (after all, hell could not possible smell anything other than noxious). \n"}, {"text": "Surely no 'B'-word quiz would be complete without the inclusion of the wonderful 'behemoth', a word we have received straight from the Bible itself.  Which of these adjectives would best describe the nature of a behemoth, given its current English usage?", "correct": "Large", "options": ["Hairy", "Finicky", "Impolite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarge.\n\n\tYou may very well find a behemoth (or 'large beast' from the Hebrew) to be hairy, finicky and/or impolite, but none of these are descriptors that strictly define the creature.  In fact, I have met some bald behemoths who never were fussy and who regularly practiced great etiquette.  One thing that is in common with all of my behemoth friends, they are each rather large.\r By the way, in order to be described as a behemoth, the descriptee does not have to be alive.  A car, a bookshelf, yes, even a pillow, could be described as a behemoth if it were considered large enough. \n"}, {"text": "One of the absolutely essential words one must have in his or her insult arsenal is 'buffoon', another word for clown, or, if you prefer a more crude and blunt synonym, idiot.  Which language ultimately provided us with this wonderful term?", "correct": "Italian", "options": ["Arabic", "Russian", "Japanese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItalian.\n\n\tThe Italians have provided a lot in history, great art, magnificent pasta dishes, lovely opera, but nothing can top their contribution to the English vocabulary.  Take the word buffoon ('buffone' in the Italian, 'buffo' from the Latin, meaning 'clown') for example, it rolls off the tongue so gently but has such a stinging effect.  Grazie, grazie, my Italian friends! \n"}, {"text": "I can imagine that it would be absolute bedlam if I did not include that word (bedlam) somewhere in this quiz.  After the name of what sort of institution was the word bedlam originally derived?", "correct": "Asylum", "options": ["School", "Dance hall", "Funeral home"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsylum.\n\n\tThe word bedlam (originally 'bedlem') is short for Bethlehem, which, in turn, is short for Hospital of Saint Mary of Bethlehem, an asylum for people with mental illnesses that came into existence in the early 15th century in London.  The word, as it is used in its modern sense to mean 'a state of uproar, or chaos', became a common term in reference to the patients of the hospital, who apparently were taken on occasion for walks in public.  The civilian reaction to such a spectacle could explain the current meaning of the term. \n"}, {"text": "This single 'B' word has two entirely different meanings, depending on the context of its usage.  The first meaning is of a round, felt hat with a domed crown, worn by men, while the second meaning refers to a certain participant in cricket, skittles and a couple other sports.  Which 'B' word may aptly be applied in both senses described above?", "correct": "Bowler", "options": ["Beanie", "Bonnet", "Boater"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowler.\n\n\tParticipants in lawn bowling, tenpin bowling or skittles are also called bowlers.  In cricket, the word bowler specifically refers to the individual on the fielding side who propels the ball towards the batsman.  \r If you are not familiar with a bowler hat, might I suggest scanning some of the works of Belgian surrealist painter Rene Magritte?  The term comes from a 19th century English hatmaker named William Bowler who happened to create the very hats eponymous to his name. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most interesting and beautiful 'B' words in the English language comes to us from the Italian 'burla', meaning 'mockery'. I am, of course, referring to the word burlesque.  Which of these non-'B' terms best resembles its meaning?", "correct": "Caricature", "options": ["Denigrate", "Irritate", "Flatter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaricature.\n\n\tBoth burlesque and caricature refer to a kind of comic exaggeration, the former of a literary work, the latter of a person.  Both may be used as a noun or verb.  Some famous examples of burlesques in modern film would include 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Austen Powers'.  Many American stars of the early 20th century stage and screen, including Abbot and Costello, the Marx Brothers and Fanny Brice, put on burlesque acts.  \r In addition, this quiz, in fact, is a burlesque of one of my earlier quizzes. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these oddball 'B' words is used to describe a non-existent object of fear?", "correct": "Bugaboo", "options": ["Beelzebub", "Billabong", "Boustrophedon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBugaboo.\n\n\tWhile Beelzebub literally refers to the Devil (who, perhaps, would be described as an 'imaginary object of fear' by some, but this is not the accepted meaning of the term), billabong to a stagnant pool in the Australian outback and boustrophedon to a very curious style of writing (alternating from right to left), the word bugaboo is employed in reference to imaginary creatures such as bogeymen, goblins and the monsters under your bed.  Honestly, they do not exist...honest. \n"}, {"text": "Some of the great eponyms of the English language happily happen to be 'B' words.  Which of the following 'B' words is not derived from the name of a person, and hence not an eponym?", "correct": "Bonsai", "options": ["Boycott", "Bloomers", "Bowdlerize"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonsai.\n\n\tThe word bonsai comes from the Japanese and literally means 'tray for planting' (from the Chinese 'penjing').  \r The word boycott, which means to refuse to purchase certain items or have commercial relations with certain parties as an act of protest, is named after Charles Boycott, a 19th century Irish land agent.  \r Bowdlerize, which means to censor written material, comes from the name of Dr. Thomas Bowdler, a 19th century American who butchered the works of Shakespeare just to remove a few tasty and titillating words.  \r Bloomers, the loose-fitting knickers that reach knee-length and are typically worn by ladies, are named for another dweller of the 19th century, this time Amelia Bloomer, social activist extraordinaire.  \r I hope this quiz has helped bestow upon you a finer appreciation of some of the better 'B' words in our beautiful English language.
