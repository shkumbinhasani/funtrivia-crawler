Kirk, Mr. Spock, and Dr. McCoy.  He was the first to die as a victim of the M-113 \"monster\", the last native inhabitant of that world.  It needed salt to survive, and if it couldn't ingest it orally, it would attack other beings with suckers that were on its fingers and absorb all of the salt out of its victim's blood.  It could mentally project different images to nearby people, so that it appeared different to different people.  (Aired pilot, \"The Man Trap\")\r Darnell wore a blue tunic, suggesting that he worked for a science division department.  However, since this was the first aired episode, the meanings of the colored uniforms was not set.  Early season one episodes only had blue and tan uniforms.  Red uniforms wouldn't make their debut until the ninth aired episode, \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\"\r As an exception, the fourth crewman killed in \"The Man Trap\", Crewman Barnhart, was wearing a gray utility vest.

He was returned back to the Alpha Quadrant with no memory of the incident.  (episode \"Death Wish\", season 2, episode 18)\r Lieutenant Barclay (Dwight Schultz) appeared in six episodes (\"Projections\", \"Pathfinder\", \"Life Line\", \"Inside Man\", \"Author, Author\", and \"Endgame\").

The Challenger was in pursuit of Chakotay and Kim, who had survived an attempt at using slipstream drive 15 years prior.  However, they had been in a lead shuttle, sending navigation corrections to Voyager.  Through a miscalculation, Voyager crashed and killed all aboard, while Chakotay and Kim's shuttle made it back to the Alpha Quadrant.  Harry and Chakotay planned to use a stolen Borg temporal device to send the correct data back to Voyager so that it made it back to the Alpha Quadrant, thus changing time (and why the Challenger is pursuing them).  While under attack from the Challenger, Harry realized no data correction would allow Voyager to return to Federation space, but that he could send data that would cause them to safely exit the slipstream.  Just as he sent it, the Challenger destroyed their shuttle.  But the data was received, and Voyager exited the slipstream safely.  Although not home, Voyager shaved 10 years off of their journey (estimated 10,000 light-years).  (\"Timeless\" was also the show's 100th episode.) \n"}, {"text": "TV Show: \"The Incredible Hulk\" (1978-1982)\nWhat caused Dr. Banner to experience his first transformation into The Hulk?", "correct": "Changing a flat tire in the rain", "options": ["The men's room was out of toilet paper", "His lab exploding", "Trying to lift his car off of his wife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChanging a flat tire in the rain.\n\n\tDr. Banner had exposed himself to gamma radiation, in the hopes of triggering the super strength he'd been researching.  Simple exposure didn't activate it.  But later, as he was driving his car, he got a flat tire.  It was also raining, so the lug wrench kept slipping off of the lug nuts.  He eventually hurt his hand, and the pain of that plus the frustration of changing the tire triggered his first transformation.\r In the pilot, his lab did explode, caused by reporter Jack McGee accidentally spilling some chemicals in a storage closet.  Dr. Banner transformed and tried to save his assistant, Dr. Marks, who sadly died.\r Years before, he had been in a car accident with his wife.  She was trapped in the wreckage, and he had tried to lift the car off of her, to no avail.  Then later, he heard about people who *did* have the strength to rescue loved ones, which started his research into super strength.\r In the \"Mad Magazine\" parody of the show, he transformed because the restroom he was in didn't have any toilet paper. \n"}]}
