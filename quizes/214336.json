{"id": "214336", "name": "The Three Musketeers Trivia Quiz | TV & Movies Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", " TV & Movies Mixture", "Something in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "Who is the third Musketeer, besides Athos and Porthos?", "correct": "Aramis", "options": ["D'Artagnan", "De Winter", "Rochefort"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAramis.\n\n\tThough this character was rather randy with the ladies, and a self-professed expert on wines, he was aspiring to the priesthood! He was played in the movie by Richard Chamberlain. \n"}, {"text": "What was D'Artagnan's valet's name?", "correct": "Planchet", "options": ["Gaston", "Reproachement", "Mesenger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlanchet.\n\n\tDespite the fact that, in the most famous movies based on the original book, only D'Artagnan's valet was used, all four Musketeers had valets in the book. Keenan Wynn played Planchet in the Gene Kelly/Lana Turner film, and Roy Kinnear, Richard Lester's court jester, played him in the '74 version, considered the best by far. \n"}, {"text": "Was Lady De Winter a friend of the Musketeers?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tShe was, in fact, a real barracuda to our boys! She seemed particularly obsessed with D'Artagnan. She knew to keep out of Athos' way, however. Played beautifully twice in the two best-remembered films of the story, by both Lana Turner and Faye Dunaway, with the nod going to Dunaway. \n"}, {"text": "What was unique about Rochefort, Cardinal Richlieu's right hand man?", "correct": "He wore an eyepatch.", "options": ["He had one leg.", "He talked like Donald Duck.", "He walked across France on his hands once."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe wore an eyepatch.\n\n\tRochefort and D'Artagnan, oddly enough, became very good friends, in later sequels to the original story. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of D'Artagnan's lady love in the story?", "correct": "Constance Bonacieux", "options": ["Virna Lisi", "Therese Montagne", "Mange Tout"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConstance Bonacieux.\n\n\tConstance was kidnapped no less than twice in the original story! The Musketeers ran all over who-shot-John looking for her, having to hock their dearest belongings more than once to fund the hunt. Horror of horrors, she and D'Artagnan were cuckolding Constance's husband, who was much older, making the aspiring Musketeer an adulterer. Played as a klutz by Raquel Welch in the Lester version, and by June Allyson in the George Sydney/Gene Kelly version. \n"}, {"text": "What does Rochefort call D'Artagnan's horse?", "correct": "\"A 'Cheese with legs'\".", "options": ["\"Something to pull a milk wagon\"", "\"Dobbin\"", "\"Fideaux\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"A 'Cheese with legs'\".\n\n\tIt would have been called a Clydesdale over here. I don't think they had Budweiser in France at the time. \n"}, {"text": "What was Athos name in a former life?", "correct": "The Comte De La Fere", "options": ["Le Duque De Earl", "The Comte De Monte Cristo", "The Comte et La Amount"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Comte De La Fere.\n\n\tThis is the persona he knew De Winter as. He and De Winter were apparently married. \n"}, {"text": "What \"sickness\" did Athos suffer from?", "correct": "Alcoholism", "options": ["Schizophrenia", "Palsy", "Gout"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlcoholism.\n\n\tDe Winter did it to him! It's obvious Athos is a little too fond of the bottle by his own lines in the story....\"What I am, is drunk...!\"; \"You will find, my boy, that things look better from the bottom of a glass...\" Even D'Artagnan, his best buddy, calls him a \"shriveled old wine sack...\" \n"}, {"text": "Who was cuckolding King Louis?", "correct": "The Duke of Buckingham", "options": ["Richard X, scion of Henry II of England", "Nichola Machiavelli", "Rochefort"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Duke of Buckingham.\n\n\tFor some reason, Richilieu tried to assure King Louis that Queen Anne was faithful, but the old fop knew better! The whole thrust of the first story was, in fact, to protect her honor by covering up Anne's gift of diamond studs that Louis gave her to Buckingham. \n"}, {"text": "Who were the French soldiers fighting in the story?", "correct": "The Huguenots", "options": ["Sicilians", "Saxons", "Corsicans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Huguenots.\n\n\tCardinal Richilieu himself supervised certain battles. The Musketeers showed exceptional nonchalance during this battle, having breakfast on a bastion while fighting a massive number of Hugenot rebels. \n"}]}
