The ship in that case went on to another life. What was the new name of the tanker?", "correct": "Dong Fang Ocean", "options": ["Exxon Mobil", "Exxon Seattle", "China Bay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDong Fang Ocean.\n\n\tThe Exxon Valdez was refitted for a new career as an ore carrier. She was sold to a Hong Kong company that renamed her the \"Dong Fang Ocean\". After this oil spill, laws were enacted that required all oil tankers to have double hulls in an attempt to protect the environment. \n"}, {"text": "On Tuesday, November 19, 2002, an oil tanker named the \"Prestige\" sank off the coast of which country?", "correct": "Spain", "options": ["Italy", "United States", "United Kingdom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpain.\n\n\tIn the blame game, Spain claimed Britain was at fault for allowing the aging ship, which was headed for Gibraltar, to cause damage to the Spanish coastline.  Their reasoning was that had the \"Prestige\" had complied with the required security regulations this disaster would not have occurred.  One of the ship's internal tanks ruptured and while several countries were denying the ship access to port, the ship's hull ruptured and the ship sank. \n"}, {"text": "What oil spill, in the Persian gulf, is regarded as the largest oil spill in history? ", "correct": "Gulf  War oil spill", "options": ["Fergana Valley oil spill", "Sea Star oil spill", "Spindletop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGulf  War oil spill.\n\n\tThe Gulf War oil spill was estimated at 11 million barrels, and the oil was 5 inches thick in some areas. There were no accidents or explosions to cause this oil spill.  During the war, oil valves at the Sea Island oil terminal in Kuwait were opened and the oil was allowed to dump into the sea.  This happened in 1991. \n"}, {"text": "On December 15, 1976 the Liberian oil-tanker \"Argo Merchant\" spilled over seven million U.S. gallons of crude oil into the ocean after it ran aground on what North American island?", "correct": "Nantucket Island, Massachusetts", "options": ["Key West, Florida", "Alcatraz Island, California", "Prince Edward Island, Canada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNantucket Island, Massachusetts.\n\n\tThe \"Argo Merchant\" spilled enough oil after running aground on Nantucket Island to heat over 18,000 North American homes for a year. Because the winds off Nantucket Island were blowing out to sea, the island's flora and fauna were saved. The crew was saved, but weather prevented any salvage of the ship or its content. This incident is listed in the 1979 publication of \"The Book of Heroic Failures\". \n"}, {"text": "To help contain the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the non-profit organization \"A Matter of Trust\" sent thousands of pounds of what unusual objects to help soak up the spill?", "correct": "Human hair wrapped in nylon stockings", "options": ["Used Styrofoam cups", "Natural sea sponges", "Disposable baby diapers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHuman hair wrapped in nylon stockings.\n\n\tStrange as it may sound, human and/or animal hair stuffed into nylon stockings soaks up a lot of oil. This organization sent almost a million pounds of hair wrapped in recycled nylon stockings and pantyhose to the Gulf. They were just one of many groups that attempted to help contain and minimize this horrific spill of crude oil. \n"}, {"text": "This famous Texan, born June 18, 1915 and died on August 7, 2004, was renowned for his expertise in extinguishing oil well fires. Who was he?", "correct": "Red Adair", "options": ["Joey Smallwood", "Neal Addison", "Nelson Paul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed Adair.\n\n\tIn 1969, John Wayne's character, in the movie, \"Hellfighters\", was based on Adair. Red Adair served as the technical adviser for the movie. He has been described as a man who probably did more than any other person to preserve the environment. He fought oil fires on land and on off-shore oil rigs preventing untold thousands of gallons of oil from further polluting the environment. \n"}, {"text": "What is Occidental Petroleum's \"Piper Alpha\" rig known for?", "correct": "greatest loss of life in an offshore oil disaster", "options": ["biggest off shore oil rig to dig a dry well", "greatest amount of oil spilled in an accident", "largest oil slick ever recorded in the sea"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngreatest loss of life in an offshore oil disaster.\n\n\tIn 1988, 164 workers were killed in an explosion in the North Sea.  A play, \"Lest we forget\" was written by Mike Gibb to commemorate the disaster. Famed oil-rig fire-fighter Red Adair was finally able to extinguish the fire three weeks later in weather that included 70 foot waves and 80 mph winds. Occidental was found guilty of violations of safety procedures and providing inadequate maintenance. In spite of this, no criminal charges were ever brought. \n"}, {"text": "The United States Environmental Protection Agency has established a program aimed at helping to prevent oil spills. What is this program called? ", "correct": "Spill Prevention Containment and Countermeasures (SPCC)", "options": ["Drop Everything and Prevent Oil Spills (DEPOS)", "Oil Spill Prevention Agency (OSPA)", "Program for the Prevention of Oil Spills (PPOS)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpill Prevention Containment and Countermeasures (SPCC).\n\n\tThe SPCC program contains information and requirements for preparedness for and prevention of oil spills. The program first began on December 11, 1973. \n"}, {"text": "Most animals that die because of an oil spill tend to die for which of the following reasons?", "correct": "Inability to control body temperature", "options": ["Heavy metal poisoning", "Loss of food species", "Suffocation by the oil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInability to control body temperature.\n\n\tAll of these can and do cause animals to die. However, far more animals, both aquatic and terrestrial, die from an inability to control their body temperature. The oil soaks the feathers of birds, and the fur of terrestrial animals, and the scales and shells of aquatic animals, making them unable to control internal body temperatures. They die from both over-heating and from freezing to death. Death for these creatures is usually slow and painful. \n"}, {"text": "There is no such a thing as a natural oil leak.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThis statement is false. Off the coast of southern California there are over 600 natural seepages a year that leak the equivalent of over one million barrels of oil a year into the Pacific Ocean. Underground oil has been leaking onto the ground and into the ocean for thousands if not millions of years. The difference is that it occurs in amounts that allow local wildlife, both plant and animal, to adapt.Spills, when a ship sinks, disseminate massive amounts of oil all at once and the end result can be devastating. Often it can be confusing to decide who to blame. Was it the oil company, the ship's captain, the weather, or just bad luck? \n"}]}
