Just as the system fails, a brief message appears on one of the monitors on the bridge.  What is the message?", "correct": "Good Morning Captain", "options": ["Better Luck Next Time", "The Great Experiment Has Failed", "So Much For Progress"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGood Morning Captain.\n\n\tScotty (James Doohan) used his assignment as the EXCELSIOR's Captain of Engineering to sabotage the whole trans-warp system, making it impossible for Captain Styles to pursue Kirk and his crew. \n"}, {"text": "Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) orders his gunner to target a specific area of the Federation starship orbiting the Genesis Planet.  Which area?", "correct": "the engine", "options": ["the weapons array", "the shield generator", "the bridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe engine.\n\n\tThe gunner destroys the USS GRISSOM with a single shot, instead!

Kirk (William Shatner) that he is an enemy to be taken seriously, orders one of his men to kill one of the prisoners the Klingons are holding on the surface of the Genesis Planet.  \"Kill one of them,\" Kruge says.  \"It doesn't matter which.\"  The Klingon warrior is then shown walking behind the prisoners, deciding which person to kill with his knife.  Whom does the Klingon select to be his victim?", "correct": "Saavik", "options": ["David Marcus", "Captain Esteban (Phillip R. Allen)", "Spock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaavik.\n\n\tDavid sees, out of the corner of his eye, that the Klingon is about to stab Saavik.

He was, in fact, already dead, along with the rest of the GRISSOM crew.) \n"}, {"text": "For the first time ever on the big screen, we hear the self-destruct sequence activated on a Federation starship.

What is the last word that Kruge hears, as Kirk kicks him in the face, off of a precipice, and into a lava stream to his death far below?", "correct": "you", "options": ["enough", "hell", "die"], "explanation": "\n\n\nyou.\n\n\tIn a classic \"watch Shatner overact\" moment, Kirk times his repeated kicks to Kruge's face with overly stressed words:  \"*I* [kick] have *had* [kick] enough of *you* [kick]!\" \n"}, {"text": "After Kirk kills Kruge, he and Spock beam up to the Klingon bird-of-prey.  How many Klingons are left aboard the ship at this point?", "correct": "one", "options": ["two", "none", "three"], "explanation": "\n\n\none.\n\n\tOnly Maltz (played by \"Night Court\" star John Laroquette, by the way!) is still alive.
