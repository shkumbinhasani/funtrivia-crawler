I realize that after I pass under a large Walt Disney World sign, I may never escape.  Parking my car, I get out to ask for directions and a man dressed up as Donald Duck tells me I'm trapped.\n\nLooking around, I find myself in front of the Magic Kingdom.  Which of these attractions does not await a visitor to this park?", "correct": "The Great Movie Ride", "options": ["Big Thunder Mountain Railroad", "Pirates of the Caribbean", "Space Mountain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Great Movie Ride.\n\n\tThe Great Movie Ride is one of the more popular attractions of Disney's Hollywood Studios, another one of the themed parks on the Disney plot.  Riders hop into cars that take them through scenes from famous movies of yesteryear from \"Aliens\" to \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and other classics.  The ride is also notable for having featured classic movie props including one of the pairs of ruby slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\".\rMagic Kingdom, on the other hand, was the first park to open in Walt Disney World (in 1971).  Since then, the Cinderella Castle has stood tall and visitors have looked to the kingdom as one of the most popular attractions of the entire resort.  The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is found in Adventureland and it first opened in 1973, Space Mountain is the main attraction of Tomorrowland and it's one of the fastest roller coasters in the park (and the oldest in Florida), and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is a mine train coaster in Frontierland near Splash Mountain. \n"}, {"text": "A crowd shuffles me off towards the monorail and no matter how much I lash out and scream for help, I'm whisked across Disney to what I assume can only be more fun and merriment.  I get off at one of the stops.\nWhich of these hotels can I be confident I did not disembark at?", "correct": "The Dolphin Resort", "options": ["The Grand Floridian Resort", "The Polynesian Resort", "The Contemporary Resort"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dolphin Resort.\n\n\tOf those listed, the Dolphin is the only resort not on the Monorail loop around the Seven Seas Lagoon.  This loop takes visitors from the Magic Kingdom around to the Grand Floridian Resort, the Polynesian Resort, the Ticket Center, and the Contemporary Resort, before returning to its original location.  Another monorail line starts from the Ticket Center and proceeds south to Epcot, but only if you switch lines. Aside from this, visitors can also take one of many buses or ferries over the Seven Seas Lagoon if they so choose.  The Monorail, on the other hand, is an experience in itself.  It actually takes its route through the Contemporary Hotel, stopping within the building and pushing through its northern wall. The Monorail system opened on the first day of the park. \n"}, {"text": "\"Why did I even leave my car?\" I ask out loud.  I hop aboard a bus in hope that I may yet return back to a world free of oversized mouse ears, over-exuberance and funnel cake.  No dice.  They drop me off in front of Epcot Center and a crowd ushers me in through the front gates.  Before I know it, I'm in Japan.\n\nIf I head clockwise around the World Showcase and I'm at Japan, how many more different countries should I pass before I leave this portion of Epcot?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Eleven", "Seven", "Sixteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tIt looks to me like I really don't have a choice but to stop and have a beer at the Germany pavilion- this is all too much.  Japan is next to 'The American Adventure' in the center of the world showcase seen around the lagoon in the middle of the park.  If I continue clockwise around it, I'll pass through Morocco, France, the United Kingdom (and get lost in a hedge maze), and Canada's pavilion before breaking free of the world entirely.  There are eleven countries represented in the World Showcase at Epcot, each with their own characteristic styles, cultures, and settings.\rThe rest of Epcot, known as 'Future World', includes the world's largest golf ball, Spaceship Earth (though it's not really a golf ball), and many other innovative rides from Test Track to Mission: Space.  Epcot opened for business in 1982. \n"}, {"text": "I run screaming from Epcot Center.  They'll never take me alive!  I wander for about three hours before I come across Disney's Hollywood Studios.  I pay the ticket price, but only to pick up something to eat at a retro diner I spy on 'Hollywood Boulevard'.  I get lost in a maze of paths looking for the exit again...\n\nWhich of these attractions can not be found in this park?", "correct": "It's a Small World", "options": ["The Tower of Terror", "Rock 'n' Roller Coaster", "Star Tours"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's a Small World.\n\n\tIt's a Small World opened in Disney's Magic Kingdom in 1966 and has since become one of the brand's most famous attractions, appearing in a number of Disney parks worldwide.  It's notable for its titular song which plays constantly throughout the entire ride.\rDisney's Hollywood Studios is something else entirely.  Once known as the Disney-MGM Studios, this park contains more mature (albeit some very good) attractions including the Great Movie Ride.  The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster debuted in 1999 and features Aerosmith in its theme, the Tower of Terror (right next door) opened in 1994 with a \"Twilight Zone\" theme and has since become one of the park's most popular attractions, and Star Tours is a \"Star Wars\" themed simulation ride.  Disney's Hollywood Studios opened in 1989 as the third park in the resort. \n"}, {"text": "Departing from Disney's Hollywood Studios, I see snow on the horizon.  In Florida?  No!  Surely this must be home!  Turns out it's nothing more than a mirage.  What seemed to me to be the wintry solace of Canada turned out to be a water park.  If these people really knew what swimming in cold water felt like...\n\nWhat is the name of this water park?", "correct": "Blizzard Beach", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlizzard Beach.\n\n\tBlizzard Beach opened its slopes in 1995 and was home to what was once the world's tallest water slide, Summit Plummet.  The park itself is situated around the man-made mountain, Mount Gushmore, which reaches a height of ninety feet.  This makes it one of the tallest mountains in all of Florida.  Aside from its massive slide, there are also white-water rafting rides, a lazy river (known as Cross Country Creek), and many other smaller flumes. Complete with a chairlift and a number of chalets, it's almost as if Blizzard Beach is actually a ski resort instead of a water park.  The slides are actually divided by slopes! \n"}, {"text": "The next few hours are a daze.  Day turns to night and I pass out due to exhaustion.  When I wake up, I'm in the middle of another park.  A small child is throwing rocks at me and I'm under the shade of an extremely large tree.  A man handing out mouse ears and safari hats tells me I'm in Animal Kingdom and that I need a shave.\n\nWhat is the name of the tree I spent the night under, the official symbol of Disney's Animal Kingdom?", "correct": "The Tree of Life", "options": ["The Tree of Mickey", "The Tree of Africa", "The Tree of Rafiki"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Tree of Life.\n\n\tThe largest of the four Disney theme parks in Walt Disney World, the Animal Kingdom features tons of exotic, foreign animals and wildlife-themed attractions.  Expedition Everest, for example, is a large rollercoaster with a Himalayan theme.  Featuring African and Asian areas and a DinoLand U.S.A., visitors can experience safaris, informative attractions, and the same ol' good rides and such visitors come to expect with the Disney name.\rThe large tree is the Tree of Life, the Animal Kingdom's representative symbol.  This Tree is huge and branches over the enter of the park.  The faces of hundreds of animals can be seen carved into the trunk. \n"}, {"text": "I make a vow from that point on to never step foot in a single one of Disney's theme parks.  If I end up in Anaheim at some point while trying to find my car, I will not enter California Adventure.  I walk down Osceola Parkway and come across Champion Stadium.\n\nWhere have I just found myself?", "correct": "Disney's Wide World of Sports", "options": ["Disney's Osprey Ridge Golf Course", "Disney's All-Star Sports Resort", "Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDisney's Wide World of Sports.\n\n\tDisney's Wide World of Sports is a massive sports complex in the southern end of the resort home to arenas, stadiums, diamonds, courts, bowling lanes, rinks, and fields.  Many professional athletes train within this area and Champion Stadium was once home to the Tampa Bay Rays.  After a joint-partnership with ESPN, the complex was renamed the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex.  Nonetheless, since its opening in 1997 is has been utilized by pros, amateurs, major leagues, and minor leagues for various events.\rAlong with this, golfers will find a number of courses across the entire resort from Osprey Ridge to the Magnolia. \n"}, {"text": "I walk by a another water park.  This time, the sun is blocked from my view by a ship, known as the Miss Tilly, perched upon a mountaintop.  A plume of water shoots out the top as the clock strikes noon, but I keep walking.  After all, I need to get out of here.\n\nWhat is the name of this water park?", "correct": "Typhoon Lagoon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTyphoon Lagoon.\n\n\tOpening in 1989, Typhoon Lagoon was the Walt Disney World Resort's second water park (and not the last) containing an enormous wave pool, a number of waterslides around Mount Mayday, and actual shark tanks.  Since its opening, Typhoon Lagoon has become the world's most-visited waterpark on numerous occasions. Atop Mount Mayday, visitors can find the Miss Tilly, a shrimpboat stranded on the top of the peak.  This centerpiece is surrounded by flumes and waterfalls which will be visited by riders along the way.  Humunga Kowabunga, a five-story water slide, can take visitors nearly sixty miles an hour straight down the side of the mountain. \n"}, {"text": "I didn't think Disney had a commercial side to it, but I'm proven wrong as I step into Downtown Disney to buy a map of the park with the change I've collected from the ground on my tour through Disney.  No time to stop though; I pass right through Downtown Disney entirely.\n\nWhat was the name of the portion of Downtown Disney containing clubs and entertaining nightlife until the 2008 recession?", "correct": "Pleasure Island", "options": ["The West Side", "The Marketplace", "Disney After Dark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPleasure Island.\n\n\tDowntown Disney is pretty much an outdoor mall filled with souvenir shops, big-name restaurants (such as a surviving Planet Hollywood, the Rainforest and Hard Rock Cafes, and others), and a multiplex movie theater.  In addition, visitors can find a giant LEGO store, performances by Cirque du Soleil, and a House of Blues on the premises.  Yes, there is also a 'World of Disney' Store...maybe more than one.\rPleasure Island was linked to the area about thirteen years after Downtown Disney's opening in the 1970s.  This club-laden island full of nighttime entertainment for the more mature Disney visitor was a haven for music and dance seekers visiting the resort.  In 2008, the clubs closed down after falling victim to the economic recession with no plans to reopen. \n"}, {"text": "\"This seems metaphorical\" is all I can say to myself as I walk down the Disney Boardwalk.  What seems to be the last piece on the Monopoly board may be my last step of the journey.  I break into a run- no time to savor the moment.\nDoes the Disney Boardwalk stretch longer than a mile?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIn reality, the Disney Boardwalk only stretches for a quarter mile.  Nonetheless, the stretch features a number of restaurants, bars, and boutique characteristic of those seaside boardwalks the area tries to emulate.  Reaching around Crescent Lake, the Boardwalk is regarded as part of the Epcot canon of resorts.  Featuring both an Inn and Villas, this area is for upper-middle class visitors in terms of price-point.  A ferry can take visitors across Crescent Lake to reach other Disney parks if need be.  The area opened for business in 1996. \n"}]}
