{"id": "228326", "name": "Which \"Halo\" Mission is it? Quiz | Halo Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Halo Games", "Halo: Combat Evolved"], "questions": [{"text": "In which level must we travel around an island (either by foot or in Warthogs)?", "correct": "The Silent Cartographer", "options": ["Halo", "Assault on the Control Room", "Keyes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Silent Cartographer.\n\n\tThis level is quite interesting.  You'll need to make your way around to two different parts of the island.  First, you'll enter an area and the door to the map room will be unlocked.  This means that you'll need to head around the island and unlock it.  You can take the Warthog with you, but you're unlikely to get it into the deeper parts of the island.  All the while, you'll need to fight various types of Covenant forces from Grunts to Hunters.  There are also numerous Overshields and Camouflages to pick up along the way if you get stuck. \n"}, {"text": "Which level is the first to contain The Flood?", "correct": "343 Guilty Spark", "options": ["Two Betrayals", "The Library", "The Maw"], "explanation": "\n\n\n343 Guilty Spark.\n\n\tIn this level, you need to help Captain Keyes out again, so you'll head to a small warehouse-like bunker alone.  At the very end of this bunker, you'll fight The Flood.  After this encounter, you'll need to make your way back to the surface again.  You'll also encounter the Shotgun for the first time, and it's great for destroying The Flood.  So anyways, you'll need to make your way to the 'safety' of the surface and you'll run into Captain Keyes' marines.  Find your way to 343 Guilty Spark (the blue light flying around) and the level's over. \n"}, {"text": "In this level, you need to travel to different crash landing sites filled with marines who are fighting off the Covenant.  This will also give you a chance to pilot your first vehicle.  What level is this?", "correct": "Halo", "options": ["Truth and Reconciliation", "The Pillar of Autumn", "The Silent Cartographer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalo.\n\n\tHalo is the second level of the game, and it's your first level on the Halo.  When the Pillar of Autumn crashes into the Halo, you and your escape pod also crash.  You're the only survivor in this group, but luckily, there's more survivors elsewhere.  You'll need to head to about four crash sites to help the marines, and at the final one, you'll be taken away in a Pelican.  After saving the first group, you'll get a Warthog to drive to the other areas. \n"}, {"text": "Which level is the second to occur on a Covenant ship?", "correct": "Keyes", "options": ["The Maw", "Truth and Reconciliation", "Assault on the Control Room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeyes.\n\n\tIn this level, you once again need to board the Truth and Reconciliation to save Captain Keyes.  This level is nearly identical to the ship-half of the Truth and Reconciliation level, but you'll be facing waves of The Flood as you travel through the corridors.  When you reach Keyes, he'll already be in his Flood form, and you'll need to escape the ship. \n"}, {"text": "What level involves finding the Index?", "correct": "The Library", "options": ["The Maw", "Assault on the Control Room", "The Silent Cartographer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Library.\n\n\tIn The Library, you need to follow 343 Guilty Spark through a vast library on the Halo, and you'll learn the real meaning behind the name 'The Flood'.  Honestly, there'll be times where you'll be surrounded by The Flood with no possible escape.  To win the level, you'll need to plow your way through the large halls, elevators, and rooms containing 'The Flood' and retrieve The Index.  The Index is basically the key that starts the Halo.  When used, it will destroy all life in the galaxy and starve The Flood. \n"}, {"text": "This is the first level to contain Covenant Hunters.  What is the name of this level?", "correct": "Truth and Reconciliation", "options": ["Assault on the Control Room", "The Pillar of Autumn", "Halo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTruth and Reconciliation.\n\n\tIn the third level, you'll go with a group of marines to the Covenant ship, the Truth and Reconciliation, in order to save the captured Captain Keyes.  Once you navigate the narrow passageways and hangars, you'll be able to find Captain Keyes in his prison cell.  After this, you'll need to fight your way back to a hangar (while preventing Keyes from getting killed) and fly out of the ship.  You later return to the Truth and Reconciliation in the penultimate level, Keyes. \n"}, {"text": "In this mission, you need to navigate your way through a ship being boarded by the Covenant.  In this level, you also meet Captain Keyes for the first time, and on the PC version of the game, you test out your shields, guns, and health.  Which level of the game is this?", "correct": "The Pillar of Autumn", "options": ["Keyes", "Halo", "The Maw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Pillar of Autumn.\n\n\t\"The Pillar of Autumn\" is the first level of the game, and although it's quite easy, it's also quite fun.  The whole level is based on the ship, The Pillar of Autumn, and you need to find your way to an escape pod.  Meanwhile, the Covenant are boarding the ship and killing your marines.  Simply make your way to the nav points, learn the basics, and escape from the ship. \n"}, {"text": "Which level takes place in the same location as the level Assault on the Control Room?", "correct": "Two Betrayals", "options": ["Truth and Reconciliation", "The Library", "Keyes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo Betrayals.\n\n\tIn Two Betrayals, 343 Guilty Spark steals the Index and betrays you.  This level actually begins in the Control Room and you need to work your way back through the level while destroying energy cores.  This level is quite interesting because not only must you fight The Flood for half of the level, but you can now fly Banshees and drive plenty of vehicles to your destination. \n"}, {"text": "In which level of the game must you ride a Warthog to your ship before the Halo is destroyed?", "correct": "The Maw", "options": ["Keyes", "343 Guilty Spark", "Halo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Maw.\n\n\tThe Maw is the tenth and final level of the game.  In this level, you must navigate the halls and areas within the crashed Pillar of Autumn and make your way to the engine room.  Once there, you'll need to destroy four vents and escape the ship using a Warthog.  When your ride is destroyed, you'll need to drive further to a second ship at the end of the level and fly away.  All the while, you'll need to fight The Flood, Covenant, and 343 Guilty Spark's machines.  In the end, you'll be the only one to escape the destruction. \n"}, {"text": "Which level contains the subtitles \"I Would Have Been Your Daddy...\", \"Rolling Thunder\", and \"If I Had a Super Weapon...\"?", "correct": "Assault on the Control Room", "options": ["343 Guilty Spark", "The Maw", "Halo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAssault on the Control Room.\n\n\tThis has to be one of my favourite levels.  Not only is it long, but it contains many chances to drive Ghosts, Banshees, Scorpions and Warthogs.  Also, you're not quite at the point where The Flood begins to attack, so you're only fighting the Covenant.  When you play this level, all you really need to do is get to the end; there aren't many objectives. \n"}]}
