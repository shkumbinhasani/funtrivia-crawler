Early in her adult life she declared that she would not partake of alcoholic beverages and admitted that serving wine at parties was \"sorrowful\" but she chose not to publicly preach against drinking but persuade by example. This strategy often put her at odds with the more militant members of the WCTU. \n"}, {"text": "What issue led Lucy Hayes to become an early supporter of the newly formed Republican Party?", "correct": "Abolition of slavery", "options": ["The establishment of a national banking system", "Women's suffrage movement", "The temperance movement"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbolition of slavery.\n\n\tLucy Hayes' views on the abolition of slavery remained strong throughout her life.

Supposedly, when her now widowed mother was told to sell the slaves so she would have money to help support her family, Lucy's mother stated that they were not hers to sell and granted them their freedom. As an adult, Lucy continued the family tradition of supporting abolitionism.She helped abandoned African-American children find safe havens, helped educate African-American women and spoke favorably of a racially-integrated Methodist Church service she attended in Montreal, Canada. Her views led her to be a strong supporter of the newly formed Republican Party and many feel she influenced her husband to leave the Whig Party and join the Republican cause as well. She was an active supporter of John C. Fremont in the 1856 election and worked in the two presidential campaigns for Abraham Lincoln. \n"}, {"text": "How many children did Lucy and Rutherford B.
