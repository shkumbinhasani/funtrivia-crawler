{"id": "76531", "name": "Hardest Lost Arts 2- Milking Trivia Quiz | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "  Homes & Gardens"], "questions": [{"text": "Traditionally, which of the following animals has NOT been used for milking?", "correct": "Pig", "options": ["Sheep", "Reindeer", "Horse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPig.\n\n\tReindeer milk is the richest of any domestic species- it has a fat content of up to 22 percent! (Cow's milk averages 3-4 percent.) Many Lapps use reindeer milk. Mongolian warriors made yogurt and condensed milk from horse milk, and even today, an alcoholic drink called kumiss is made from horse's milk in Mongolia. There are actually horse dairies (using mainly draft horses) in Belgium! Sheep's milk is used primarily in cheesemaking, with the East Friesian being the most milkable sheep breed. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is true about all milking animals?", "correct": "They must have babies before milk is produced", "options": ["They have four teats", "They are allowed to raise their young before the milk is used", "They must be milked many times every day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey must have babies before milk is produced.\n\n\tMany people don't realize that you don't get milk until you get babies! Although cows have 4 teats, other animals may have different numbers- goats have 2, for example. In most dairy situations, babies are taken from the mother at birth or as soon as they have had colostrum. Most milking animals are milked twice a day. \n"}, {"text": "OK, you are ready to milk. What material should your milking pail be made of?", "correct": "Stainless steel", "options": ["Aluminum", "Glass", "Plastic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStainless steel.\n\n\tStainless steel is tough, easy to clean, and can withstand the cleaning and disinfecting solutions that are used to clean dairy equipment. \n"}, {"text": "You have your critter up on the milking stand, with a feeder full of grain to keep her busy, and you've brushed off any stray pieces of hay and straw in her coat. What do you do next?", "correct": "Wash her udder", "options": ["Start milking", "Dip her teats", "Test her milk for blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWash her udder.\n\n\tYou want to make sure that the milk is coming from a clean udder. Sometimes special udder wash is used for the purpose, but some people use some soapy water with a bit of bleach. Udder washing also stimulates the animal to let down her milk. \n"}, {"text": "Now you're milking! You hold one teat in either hand- now which fingers do you squeeze together first?", "correct": "Thumb and index finger", "options": ["Middle finger against palm", "Pinkie against palm", "Ring finger against palm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThumb and index finger.\n\n\tYour thumb and index finger trap the milk in the teat, and the other fingers squeeze it out. \n"}, {"text": "When you hand-milk, it's advised not to use the first few squirts of milk. Why?", "correct": "It's highest in bacteria", "options": ["It's too thick", "It's too warm", "It's too weak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's highest in bacteria.\n\n\tOften, these squirts will be directed into a 'strip cup', where you can examine them for flakes, clots or other signs of mastitis- an inflammation of the udder. \n"}, {"text": "Mammals that have just given birth produce colostrum. Which of the following is NOT true about colostrum?", "correct": "It's unfit for human use", "options": ["It contains high levels of antibodies", "It is yellow in color", "It is thicker than normal milk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's unfit for human use.\n\n\tOften, the babies are kept with their mother for the first few days to receive the colostrum. Then the babies are bottle-fed and the mother is milked. However, some cultures enjoy special puddings and other dishes made from colostrum. \n"}, {"text": "The average dairy cow today produces much more milk than the average dairy cow of 50 years ago. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tCows have been intensively bred for milk production, and, unfortunately, many are given hormones to keep the milk production even higher. While a 'family cow' may easily reach the age of 12, the average commercial dairy cow 'burns out' in just a few years. \n"}, {"text": "Most goats in commercial dairies are milked by hand.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMost are milked by machine, just as cows are. In fact, cow machines can be adapted for goats. \n"}, {"text": "All right, you have that big pail of milk! What do you do with it next?", "correct": "Strain it", "options": ["Cool it", "Pasteurize it", "Drink it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrain it.\n\n\tMilk is strained through woven fiber filters. This removes all the hairs and hay that got into the milking pail despite brushing! Then, if you choose to pasteurize the milk to kill germs, you do so. Then the milk must be cooled as quickly as possible to retain flavor. Hope you learned something and happy milking! \n"}]}
