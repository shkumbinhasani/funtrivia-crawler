Gary Cooper's classic line, 'Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth', was derived directly from Lou Gehrig's goodbye speech at Yankees Stadium on July 4th, 1939.  It was selected at #38 in AFI's 100 all-time greatest quotes list. \n"}, {"text": "While growing up, and indeed even during college, Lou Gehrig had plans to enter which type of occupation?", "correct": "Engineering", "options": ["Medicine", "Law", "Architecture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEngineering.\n\n\tIt was Gehrig's mother's greatest wish that Lou study to become an engineer, much like his uncle Otto.  His parents, German immigrants, did not seem to be entirely enthralled with Lou's baseball abilities.  They eventually came around, however. \n"}, {"text": "Which American university did Lou Gehrig attend?", "correct": "Columbia", "options": ["Duke", "Harvard", "Georgia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColumbia.\n\n\tBelieve it or not, Lou Gehrig was an Ivy Leaguer.  However, he did not play baseball for the university, as he had already played some professional ball for a summer league.  He studied at Columbia with the intention of becoming an engineer, but he was signed by the Yankees in 1923 and never got a chance to pursue that career. \n"}, {"text": "For a number of games, Lou Gehrig did not play much, as the Yankees already had a capable first baseman.  What was his name?", "correct": "Wally Pipp", "options": ["Joe Kline", "Sparky Jones", "Ducky Medwick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWally Pipp.\n\n\tLou Gehrig famously stepped in for Pipp on June 2, 1925.  In the film, Pipp said he was suffering from double vision, but in reality it may have been that manager Miller Huggins wanted to shuffle the line-up in the hopes that the ball club would escape a slump. \n"}, {"text": "During his first appearance as a hitter in a Yankee uniform during the film, Lou Gehrig tripped over some baseball bats lined up on the ground in front of the dugout.  This earned him which ridiculous nickname from fans?", "correct": "Tanglefoot", "options": ["Stumblebum", "Trippy McGee", "Slippy Slappy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTanglefoot.\n\n\tSpecifically, it was Eleanor Twitchell, Gehrig's future wife, who provided the hapless Lou with this absurd nickname.  Gehrig would soon prove to be anything but a tanglefoot, becoming one of baseball's greatest players ever. \n"}, {"text": "Lou Gehrig batted left and played which fielding position in the film and in real life?", "correct": "First baseman", "options": ["Shortstop", "Right field", "Catcher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFirst baseman.\n\n\tMost experts consider Lou Gehrig to be the greatest first baseman of all-time.  During his 16-year career, he hit 493 home runs, 163 triples, 534 doubles and had 2,721 hits total.

Which lovely actress portrayed Twitchell in this film?", "correct": "Teresa Wright", "options": ["Barbara Stanwick", "Vera Miles", "Angie Dickinson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeresa Wright.\n\n\tYou may recognize Teresa Wright from some of her other high-profile roles, such as 'The Little Foxes', 'Mrs. Miniver' and 'Shadow of a Doubt'.  In fact, these three classic movies, along with 'The Pride of the Yankees', were the first four movies of her career.  She was nominated for Academy Awards for 'The Little Foxes', 'The Pride of the Yankees' and 'Mrs. Miniver', the first three films she made.  She won an Oscar for 'Mrs. Miniver'. \n"}, {"text": "Babe Ruth portrayed himself in the film 'The Pride of the Yankees'.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, despite his advancing age, Babe Ruth was a good sport, playing himself in the film.  This was not the only time Babe Ruth appeared in film as himself, but it was his most well-known film role.  Ruth was not the only ball player to appear as himself in this film.  Bill Dickey, Bob Meusel, Mark Koenig and Bill Stern also appeared as themselves here. \n"}, {"text": "Sam Blake was a newspaper man who was Lou Gehrig's greatest advocate in the film.  Which popular character actor portrayed Blake in 'The Pride of the Yankees'?", "correct": "Walter Brennan", "options": ["Ward Bond", "Edmund O'Brien", "Dan Duryea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalter Brennan.\n\n\tWalter Brennan, one of Hollywood's most highly regarded character actors of all time, played Sam Blake, who was roughly based on the real life writer Fred Lieb.  Brennan won three Best Supporting Actor Oscars for the films 'Come and Get It' (1936), 'Kentucky' (1938) and 'The Westerner' (1941). \n"}, {"text": "In the film, Lou Gehrig's 2,000th straight game was celebrated at Yankee Stadium.

Ironically, the poor fellow suffered from a rare disease now known as Lou Gehrig's Disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) which ended his career, and his life.
