Online Quiz | TV Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "TV Mixture", "Things in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "In this show which aired from 2006-2010, ordinary people with superpowers faced off against unexpected evils and forces commissioned to quell 'their kind' in the forms of Sylar and a mysterious man known as HRG.  What is the name of this program?", "correct": "Heroes", "options": ["No Ordinary Family", "Firefly", "Dollhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeroes.\n\n\t\"Heroes\", in its four season run, started as a fairly popular program.  With a large ensemble cast of 'everyday people' with hidden superpowers, the show created a vast mythology not unlike the type you'd see in a comic book series.  The show's evils started with HRG, later discovered to be Jack Coleman, Claire's father, and progressed to Sylar, a villain with the ability to take anyone's powers, and Mr. Linderman who could heal others. Of course, there were other villains throughout but these men showed their bad sides early on when the show was still popular.  By the end, the role of the 'bad guy' was taken on by Robert Knepper who also played 'T-Bag', the bad guy on \"Prison Break\". \n"}, {"text": "On the TV show \"Lost\" which ran from 2004 to 2010, the characters wavered over the lines of good and evil, but the smoke monster was always a bad figure.  Which of these people did the smoke monster not take the form of?", "correct": "Jack Shephard", "options": ["Yemi, Eko's brother", "John Locke", "Christian Shephard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Shephard.\n\n\tWhile some characters like Benjamin Linus, Charles Widmore, and Locke's con-man father were all framed as bad guys over the show's six season run, perhaps none of these people held a candle to the smoke monster which manifested from underneath the island.  Many years ago, its powers were unleashed and it took the form of Jacob's brother, the Man in Black. The Smoke Monster had the ability to take the form of any deceased individual however he was doomed to remain on the island for eternity; if he left it would be cataclysmic.  The final season saw John Locke, previously one of the main characters of the show, becoming the final host for the Smoke Monster and Jack Shephard facing off against him to save the world. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Supernatural\", Sam and Dean Winchester faced off against their share of bad guys, but in the fifth season, their big enemy was which of these evil figures?", "correct": "Lucifer", "options": ["Crowley", "Their father", "Azazel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLucifer.\n\n\tMuch of the fourth and fifth seasons of \"Supernatural\" followed Sam and Dean as they attempted to prevent the fallen archangel, Lucifer, from rising and destroying the world.  In the beginning of season 5, Lucifer took a human form and later revealed to Sam that he would need to use him as his final, permanent vessel. Meanwhile, Dean would need to act as the archangel Michael's vessel so that the two brothers would fight each other (ah...the Biblical allusions).  After claiming the rings of the four horsemen, Sam and Dean faced off in a final battle in the fifth season finale.  Oddly, Lucifer wasn't the end- the show continued after season five implying that the Winchesters had more evils to face. \n"}, {"text": "In this TV show, Olivia Dunham and Walter and Peter Bishop faced off against the weird, the supernatural, and the supposedly-impossible.  By season 2, evidence of alternate universes persisted and they faced off against a second Walter (known as Walternate) from another parallel world.  What show is this?", "correct": "Fringe", "options": ["Locke and Key", "The X-Files", "The Event"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFringe.\n\n\tWhen \"Fringe\" debuted in 2008, it emerged as something more than your typical procedural.  With J.J. Abrams, the creator of \"Lost\" and \"Alias\", at its helm, this show about a pseudoscience-focused 'Fringe Division' of the FBI evolved from a case of the week into an elaborate story about the weird, the unusual, and the dangerous beyond what we could comprehend. In the latter half of season 1, the idea of parallel universes showed itself and by season 2, evidence of other worlds was proven.  The first half of season 3 flipped back and forth between our world and the other side where another Walter Bishop, dubbed Walternate, kept the heroine, Olivia Dunham, trapped to experiment on her. Although it may be debatable that Walternate was always a bad man, his anger toward our universe may be justified as our Walter Bishop crossed over to kidnap the other side's Peter Bishop (for his own reasons) setting off an unrepairable series of horrible catastrophes. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Pokemon\", Team Rocket frequently plotted to kidnap Pikachu or hinder the main gang in some way.  Who is the male member of Rocket?", "correct": "James", "options": ["Giovanni", "Brock", "Ash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames.\n\n\tJessie and James were the key components of the notorious Team Rocket from the \"Pokemon\" animated TV series.  Along with a talking Meowth and a similarly ubiquitous Meowth hot air balloon, the two fought to hinder Ash Ketchum and Co. and steal his trusty Pikachu.  Unfortunately, their plans usually faltered and a crippling flaw allowed Ash and his friends to send Team Rocket blasting off again (and again and again...).  Team Rocket was headed by Giovanni, also the leader of the Viridian City gym, the final gym from the original series. \n"}, {"text": "In this Miami-based Showtime drama, the bad guy was somewhat of an ambiguous figure.  Sure, you could have figured that the protagonist, a serial killer who killed killers, was a bad guy, or you could've considered his adversaries (including john Lithgow and Jimmy Smits) to be the evil ones.  What show is it?", "correct": "Dexter", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDexter.\n\n\tFirst airing in 2006 and based on Jeff Lindsay's novel series, \"Dexter\" starred Michael C. Hall as Dexter Morgan, a man who seemed normal on the outside, but actually harboured a murderous streak and a lack of emotion.  Much of the show involved Dexter facing off against Miami's killer population while working for the Miami Metro Police Department as a blood spatter analyst, but by night he would be killing and disposing of his own prey. While trying to maintain an everyday life as a 'normal guy', he also tried to analyze human condition; in later seasons the viewer would also notice distinct changes showing that Dexter may have been human all along. Jimmy Smits played apprentice/enemy Miguel Prado in season 3 while John Lithgow portrayed the sadistic Trinity Killer in season 4 (winning an Emmy for his role). \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Mentalist\", which premiered in 2008, Patrick Jane and the officials at CBI were on the hunt for this man who killed Jane's family and countless others.  What was the nickname of this merciless, cunning serial killer?", "correct": "Red John", "options": ["Johnny B. Goode", "Long John", "Johnny-Go-Lightly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed John.\n\n\tIn the first episode of \"The Mentalist\", Patrick Jane's antagonism towards the serial killer Red John was outlined.  Red John killed his wife and daughter and Jane had since worked for the California Bureau of Investigation, partly to find Red John and get revenge on the man for what he did.  Red John has done several things to effectively infiltrate the CBI, continue his spree, and escape Jane's clutches on many occasions although he has come into contact with Jane in the past.  Because of his influence on the events of the show, every episode alluded to the colour red. \n"}, {"text": "Voiced by Harry Shearer, Mr. Burns is the trillionaire power plant owner and sinister old man from which FOX animated TV series?", "correct": "The Simpsons", "options": ["King of the Hill", "Family Guy", "American Dad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Simpsons.\n\n\tCharles Montgomery Burns, voiced by Spinal Tap band-member Harry Shearer, has been on the show since the very first season as Homer Simpson's boss and the owner of the Springfield Nuclear Plant (amongst other things).  Whether forgetting Homer's name, facing off against his horrible public image, dealing with his age, or calling upon Mr. Smithers for help, Mr. Burns not only blotted out the sun, but created the Mr. Burns Casino, tried to claim Bart as his heir (and son), and was shot by the infantile Maggie Simpson.  Suffice to say, Mr. Burns is \"excellent\". \n"}, {"text": "Although we never saw his face, the evil Dr. Claw was the archenemy of which of these animated heroes?", "correct": "Inspector Gadget", "options": ["The Tick", "Darkwing Duck", "Duckman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInspector Gadget.\n\n\tAlways hiding in some far-off location observing from a computer screen (a colour computer screen, no less, which was rare when the show aired in the mid-1980s), Dr. Claw was pure evil.  With his deep, grinding voice and the sinister M.A.D. Cat by his side, Dr. Claw would always proclaim \"I'll get you Gadget!\" even though the trusty go-go-Gadget hero would always be semi-incompetent. It also seemed that every crime in the world was orchestrated by Dr. Claw's organization, M.A.D.  It's a shame that Gadget's niece, Penny, and her dog, Brain, never got the credit for ruining Claw's plans in every episode. Unsung heroes, I tell you. \n"}, {"text": "With a simple \"Hello, Jerry\", this character played by Wayne Knight on \"Seinfeld\" was a nemesis for the ages.  What is the name by which this character was known?", "correct": "Newman", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNewman.\n\n\tLiving in the same New York City apartment building as Jerry and Kramer, Newman had a tendency to get in the way and cause the featured foursome a great deal of stress.  Although he and Kramer got along quite nicely, the rest of the gang seemed to hate Newman, and with a reason.  Newman could usually be bribed with food and he clearly had a love-hate relationship for his job as a postal worker. Even in the final episode of the show (airing in 1998), Newman saw to it that Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer were sent to prison for a year for all of the harm they caused to others through their lives. Wayne Knight was one of the most frequent guest stars of this popular show which began in 1989. \n"}]}
