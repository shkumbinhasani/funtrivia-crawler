{"id": "229150", "name": "The Quiz Is Not Enough | James Bond | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "James Bond", "Bond Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Who played Willard Whyte in \"Diamonds Are Forever\"?", "correct": "Jimmy Dean", "options": ["Pat Boone", "Strother Martin", "Don Stroud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJimmy Dean.\n\n\tJimmy Dean, in a weird bit of casting, was cast as the supposedly Howard Hughes-like Willard Whyte. As far as I know, this was the very last major feature film role for the Country and Western singer and sausage salesman. He did, however, do extensive TV work, and even had his own show for a few years, from 1963-1966, before his appearance in \"Diamonds Are Forever\". \n"}, {"text": "In the 007 novels, Bond drove the Aston Martin in just one story, \"Goldfinger\". What did Bond usually drive in the books?", "correct": "A Bentley 4.5 Litre Roadster", "options": ["A Rolls Royce Mulliner-Park-Ward Convertible", "A Morgan Plus 8", "An MG-TF"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Bentley 4.5 Litre Roadster\n\n\tThis elegant, and incredibly rare roadster, was Bond's usual ride, and only appeared in one movie, \"From Russian With Love\", and then only for five minutes! It was mentioned in \"Goldfinger\", just before the fabled DB-5 was introduced to a drooling world. Due to its indelible association with 007, the DB-5 was again featured in \"Thunderball\" and the updated model, the DB-S/Vantage, that followed the disastrous DB-6, was driven by Lazenby and Moore during their episodes. \r I slipped the Rolls MPW in because it appeared in two other very cool British movies of the time, \"Modesty Blaise\" and, most notably, \"Blow-Up\". \n"}, {"text": "Who sings the opening theme for, \"The World Is Not Enough\"?", "correct": "Garbage", "options": ["Blondie", "Alannis Morrisette", "Sixpence None The Richer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarbage.\n\n\tThe very well done, same-name theme for the next to last Brosnan Bond film was performed by Ms. Manson and Co., first in a little teaser video of her being hunted down and killed by a robot doppelganger, and then over the opening titles. It's probably the best Bond theme song since \"Goldfinger\". \n"}, {"text": "Which two actresses have played \"Domino\" in two separate interpretations of \"Thunderball\"?", "correct": "Claudine Auger and Kim Basinger", "options": ["Lotte Lenya and Samantha Bond", "Luciana Paluzzi and Daniella Bianchi", "Shirley Eaton and Diana Rigg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClaudine Auger and Kim Basinger.\n\n\tIn the original \"Thunderball\", she was played by Claudine Auger, as a demur, dark beauty who eventually rebelled against her \"keeper\", Emilio Largo. The same role, in \"Never Say Never Again\", a remake not done by Eon Productions, was parlayed by Kim Basinger. Both of these versions of the \"Goldfinger\" follow-up starred Sean Connery. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the bartender who Quarrel says \"rassles alligators\" in \"Dr. No\"?", "correct": "Pussfeller", "options": ["Chesterfield", "Cheesemaker", "Scaramanga"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPussfeller.\n\n\tPussfeller, as it turns out, after initially having a little tete-a-tete with Bond in the film, is revealed, by a serendipitously-arriving Felix Leiter, to be a CIA operative in the back room of the seaside bar just before Bond takes off for Crab Key. An actor named Lester Pendergrast plays this role. John Kitzmiller played Quarrel. \n"}, {"text": "What three actors were initially considered for the role of Bond?", "correct": "David Niven, Patrick McGoohan and Richard Burton", "options": ["Anthony Newley, Alan Bates and Terence Stamp", "Peter O'Toole, Peter Sellers and Tommy Steele", "David Hemmings, Tom Courtenay and Richard Harris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Niven, Patrick McGoohan and Richard Burton.\n\n\tWould you believe McGoohan turned it down because he considered Bond too violent and promiscuous? Oddly enough, Sellers and Niven actually did play Bond, eventually, in the spoof, \"Casino Royale\", considered by some to be the all-time worst Bond film. I still say...\"Pick a Moore, any Moore\"! My personal pick would have been \"Moonraker\"!\r I also might add that there were others considered for the role, initially. \n"}, {"text": "How many times has Shirley Bassey sung the themes for Bond films?", "correct": "3", "options": ["2", "4", "1"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tYep...three! \"Goldfinger\", \"Diamonds Are Forever\" and \"Moonraker\". They must have really liked her! Apparently, they probably hoped that some of \"Goldfinger's\" magic would rub off on the other films, but regrettably, such was not the case. One of the movies was Moore's \"Moonraker\"! 'Nothing' could have helped it! \n"}, {"text": "Who was the only actor to portray Felix Leiter more than once?", "correct": "David Hedison", "options": ["Jack Lord", "Bernie Casey", "Cec Linder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Hedison.\n\n\tDavid Hedison, \"The Fly\" and Capt. Lee Crane from \"Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea\", was the only actor to play Leiter more than once, in \"Live and Let Die\" and \"License To Kill\". Why he was portrayed by different actors almost every time he appeared is a mystery, but the discrepancy was kind of strange more than once: He's been portrayed by middle-aged actors, young actors, and one African/American guy! I half expect a \"Felicia\" Leiter to show up eventually! (Hey! It happened to \"M\"!) \n"}, {"text": "Two \"Bond Girls\" were famous for being part of 'another' famous spying team! Can you name this British TV staple of the sixties and which ladies were the distaff parts?", "correct": "\"The Avengers\"; Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg", "options": ["\"The Prisoner\"; Shirley Eaton and Britt Eklund", "\"Return of the Saint\"; Joanna Lumley and Gayle Hunnicut", "\"Secret Agent\"; Maud Adams and Lois Chiles"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Avengers\"; Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg.\n\n\tBoth Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg played the partners of John Steed, the dapper, veddy British fellow secret agent of the aloof team in \"The Avengers\". After 007 took off as a franchise, the team, which pretty much, up until then, worked freelance, started working for an arm of the BSS run by a fellow called \"Mother\". This series was turned into a much-reviled movie in 1998. (It actually wasn't as bad as it's made out to be, trust me.) \r We Americans never saw Honor Blackman in her tenure on the show, but millions of nerdy types developed major crushes on the very ladylike Diana Rigg as Mrs. Peel. Honor Blackman played Cathy Gale and immediately preceded Rigg as MacNee's partner. \n"}, {"text": "Only two people who played ol' Jimmy were actually English. Can you name the two actors?", "correct": "David Niven and Roger Moore", "options": ["Peter Sellers and Timothy Dalton", "Pierce Brosnan and George Lazenby", "Barry Nelson and Daniel Craig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Niven and Roger Moore.\n\n\tThere ought to be a law! Niven, the execrable \"Casino Royale\" aside, in which he played a retired Bond, was actually a very well respected actor. He spoofed the character in the movie, generally considered to be among the worst of the Bond films. He was just one of many, as Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and others were also called James Bond in this chaotic movie.\r Roger Moore, who, as far as I'm concerned, took the Bond franchise to new lows, was the only other genuine Angle to play him. Brosnan is Irish; Connery: Scottish; Dalton: Italian, French and Welsh and Lazenby: Australian! Heh...Niven even looks like he might have been part French! \n"}, {"text": "Who portrayed \"Red\" Grant in \"From Russia With Love\"?", "correct": "Robert Shaw", "options": ["Christopher Lee", "Jonathan Pryce", "Christopher Walken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Shaw.\n\n\tRobert Shaw, an actor as Irish as Paddy's pig, portrayed the psycho-pathological Grant in what is considered one of the best Bond films. We are introduced to him in the teaser, as he hunts down a living decoy made up like Connery at SPECTRE's training camp. Later, we also see Lotte Lenya, as Rosa Kleb, punch him full in the stomach with brass knuckles to demonstrate how unfeeling and tough he is as SPECTRE higher-ups review the installation. \r Shaw is also famous for being the favorite actor of playwright Harold Pinter and for portraying the ship's captain in \"Jaws\". Another place to see him is in two classic films, \"The Luck Of Ginger Coffey\" and \"A Man For All Seasons\". \n"}, {"text": "Who portrayed Kara, Timothy Dalton's love interest, in \"The Living Daylights\"?", "correct": "Maryam D'Abo", "options": ["Teri Hatcher", "Carrie Lowell", "Lena Olin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaryam D'Abo.\n\n\tMaryam D'Abo, who actually hasn't done much since, portrayed the waifish cello player in this film, one of the great, underrated episodes in the series. Her younger cousin, Olivia D'Abo, has actually worked a lot more, portraying the sister of Kevin Arnold on \"The Wonder Years\" and a recurring character on the short-lived \"The Single Guy\", as well as a new \"Q\" recruit on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\". \n"}, {"text": "An eventually well-known actor portrayed Felix Leiter in the very first Bond film, \"Dr. No\". Who was this lucky fellow, who probably owed his career to Eon Productions?", "correct": "Jack Lord", "options": ["Bernie Casey", "Cec Linder", "Martin Landau"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Lord.\n\n\tJack Lord, \"Steve McGarrett\" of \"Hawaii Five-0\", played good old, reliable Felix in the maiden vessel in the Bond franchise. Same hair and all! He actually had very little screen time, but, as usual, saved Bond's hide at the very end of the movie. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Priscilla Barnes' character in \"License To Kill\"?", "correct": "Della Leiter", "options": ["Pam Bouvier", "Fatima Blush", "Sylvia Trench"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDella Leiter.\n\n\tBarnes portrayed the newlywed wife of Felix Leiter in the second, and last, Dalton film. Like every agent's wife in the Bond films, she is eventually killed off before the end credits roll. Recently hot actor Benicio Del Toro, in fact, played one of the scumbags that had a hand in it. Her murder, and the mauling of Felix himself, sets Bond out on a vendetta that has him temporarily quitting Her Majesty's Secret Service to get to the root of why they were attacked. \n"}, {"text": "What two songs does Chrissy Hyndes sing in \"The Living Daylights\"?", "correct": "\"Where Has Everybody Gone?\" and \"If There Was A Man\"", "options": ["\"Show Me The Meaning Of The World\" and \"Back On The Chain Gang\"", "\"The Living Daylights\" and \"My City Was Gone\"", "\"The Middle Of The Road\" and \"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Where Has Everybody Gone?\" and \"If There Was A Man\".\n\n\tActually, the full version of \"Where Has Everybody Gone\" is an excellent song, with Hyndes' sexy voice posing some interesting scenarios and questions in the lyrics: \"Where's my support now? Where's the ranks of the strong? With great pleasure, I sing your national song...!\" and \"They want the kingdom, but they don't want the king, they want his throne\"...\r \"If There Was A Man\" is uncharacteristically MOR for the punk/new wave icon, but she does it well, and listening to it, you wonder whether she didn't follow the wrong muse in pursuing a SoHo aesthetic with her music. \n"}]}
