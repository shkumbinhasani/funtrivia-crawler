I think she was a passenger on our last voyage; a person of some importance, I believe.'  \r C-3PO's response is curious.  Is he purposefully being evasive?  Does he have a bad long-term memory?  Is the image of Princess Leia just not clear?  It seems that he *should* know who she is, but one can rationalize anything in these movies...they're fantasy! \n"}, {"text": "At the dinner table, Luke chats with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru.
