{"id": "170021", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Soldier of the Month' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "We join the members of the 4077th for a brief but gastronomically hazardous respite in the mess tent.  Colonel Potter makes some announcements and discusses a problematic fever that has plagued the camp.  He believes the problem could be with flea carrying rats, and requests a rat-control officer.  Who is volunteered for this tantalizing duty?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["BJ", "Margaret", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tHawkeye generously nominates Frank as the new rat-control officer.  His speech: 'My friends, some men are born great, others achieve greatness and others are destined to work with rats.  I would like to nominate someone who is eminently qualified, a man who was born for this job, a man who can look a rat in the eye and meet him on his own terms.  I give you Major Frank Burns!' \n"}, {"text": "Potter concurrently announces a new morale-related directive, the 4077th will host a soldier of the month contest.  Who is selected as the judge for the contest?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Hawkeye", "BJ", "Himself"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tAgain, Frank is chosen.  He is to judge the contestants on their dress and deportment (Klinger's already in trouble!) and finally he is to proctor a history exam.  Let the games begin! \n"}, {"text": "The patients who have come down with this mystery fever are also suffering from severe thirst.  The doctors decide that at least one of the patients needs to be sent to Seoul to be placed on a kidney machine.  Meanwhile, Father Mulcahy has returned and provides a probably answer to the mystery disease.  What disease are the doctors dealing with?", "correct": "Hemorrhagic fever", "options": ["Bornholm disease", "Lassa fever", "Newcastle disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHemorrhagic fever.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy did some research while in Seoul and discovered that soldiers on both sides of the 1904-5 Russo-Japanese War (which he mistakenly claims was in 1931...that was when Japan invaded Manchuria) came down with the exact same symptoms that the soldiers at the 4077th are suffering from now.  Mulcahy claims that there is no cure for the disease, only 'common sense medicine'. \n"}, {"text": "The suddenly reformed and thoroughly military Klinger (he wants to win the contest) is recruited to help in the pest-control initiative.  What item does he use as lure in the rat traps that he sets?", "correct": "Frank's wife's fruitcake", "options": ["Lebanese salami", "Limburger cheese", "BJ's wife's apple pie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank's wife's fruitcake.\n\n\tKlinger is extremely helpful in Frank's anti-rat crusade until one of the mousetraps goes off on his fingers.  When BJ and Hawkeye enter the swamp, they along with Klinger are treated to Frank's miracle rat trap invention.  The camera view of the four men from inside the box is a classic 'M*A*S*H' scene, as is the following moments when it is discovered that Frank has the fever. When Frank is told that the fleas on the rats are causing the disease he responds, 'Oh that's ridiculous.  I mean, I've already carried a couple out to the trash.  And I didn't get any fleas.  I-I didn't feel well afterwards, but I-I-I-I'm not sick. I mean...just because a person has to faint...'  Kerplunk! \n"}, {"text": "Poor Frank Burns.  He appears to be the only officer from the 4077th who has come down with the 'mystery fever'.  Hawkeye and BJ very generously sit with Frank at his sickbed, listening to his feckless meandering.  According to the semi-delirious Frank, who was the last person to like him?", "correct": "His high school janitor", "options": ["His Uncle Philo", "Little Cindy Johnson in 3rd grade", "His psychiatrist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis high school janitor.\n\n\tFrank says some rather sad and revealing things during his chat with BJ and Hawkeye.  He claims that his mother used to 'smack' him when he was sick.  He also suggests that the last person to ever like him was his high school janitor, who showed him photos of heavyweight boxers.  Frank also reveals that he and Margaret are 'dating'.  Needless to say, BJ and Hawkeye are stunned! \n"}, {"text": "In one of the truly hilarious scenes in 'M*A*S*H' history, Hawkeye and BJ administer the final history test for the soldier of the month award.  The first question asks for the name of the first President of the United States.  Who answers this correctly?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Klinger", "Igor", "Zale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tRadar not only answers correctly, but adds the interesting (but incorrect) tidbit that Washington had wooden teeth.  Hawkeye adds, 'Right, and every time he told a lie, they chopped one out!'  Washington's teeth were actually made from hippo ivory.  After some bodily contortions, Klinger answers the second half of the question about where Washington was sworn into office (New York). \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye directs a question to Sergeant Zale that reads, 'Many of the settlers who came to California in 1848 were searching for what?'  What is his response?", "correct": "Palm trees", "options": ["Amelia Earhart's plane", "China", "Beach balls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPalm trees.\n\n\tHis more extended response is as follows: 'Palm trees!  How the hell do I know?  I'm from Brooklyn!'  Igor's equally inane response, 'I thought there were gonna be refreshments here.'  Klinger asks what number question they're on, to which Hawkeye responds that he doesn't know as he has mixed-up the questions.  Klinger exclaims, 'You can't do that sir, I learned history from the beginning!' \n"}, {"text": "Klinger's clearly cheating during this history exam, but Hawkeye and BJ are generous with him and allow him to continue with his desperate and underhanded maneuvers.  Which of these names from American history does Klinger say backwards, proving his deceit?", "correct": "Farragut", "options": ["Hamilton", "Roosevelt", "Douglas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFarragut.\n\n\tThe Farragut question: 'What famous Civil War hero said, 'Damn the torpedoes.  Full speed ahead'?'  Hawkeye realizes that Klinger is cheating so he creates a phony true or false question, which Klinger immediately insists is not on the test.  Radar then accuses Klinger of cheating after he sees some answers written on the latter's body. \n"}, {"text": "The scene shifts from the history exam to the post-op ward where Margaret cares for Frank.  Frank believes that he is going to die, but Margaret insists that he will be okay.  Just to be sure, however, she suggests that Frank deliver his last will and testament to Father Mulcahy.  In his will, what does Frank leave to Margaret?", "correct": "His clothes", "options": ["His picture of his mother", "His set of National Geographic magazines", "His bottle cap collection"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis clothes.\n\n\tFrank leaves virtually all of his possessions to 'the only woman who ever really cared, ever really understood, my wife Louise'.  He leaves all of the profits from his presciption kickbacks to his children.  'And finally, to Major Margaret Houlihan, my friend, my comrade, my little soldier, I leave all my clothes,' Frank adds.  Margaret overhears the entire thing, and my goodness is she angry!  She gets her revenge in the end - she slugs poor Frank. \n"}, {"text": "The soldier of the month contest ends in a fiasco, but BJ and Hawkeye are forced to name a winner from the sad group of contestants. Who ultimately wins the contest?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Igor", "Klinger", "Zale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tRadar is the only one who legitimately answers any of the history questions correctly, so it makes sense that he is the winner.  The last scene of the episode features a drunk and dishevelled Radar returning to camp complete with charges leveled for being 'drunk and disorderly', for 'trying to drink the ink in a tattoo parlor' and for 'swimming 50 laps in an eight-foot bathhouse tub'. \n"}]}
