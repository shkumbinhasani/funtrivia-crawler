An obelisk is defined as a pillar topped by a four-sided pyramid.  Usually obelisks were found at the entrance of various ancient Egyptian temples; several examples of these may be seen now in western cities such as London and New York, having been pilfered from Egypt! \n"}, {"text": "The term \"ottocento\" is used to describe art from which century?

The name Delaunay (both Robert and Sonia) is most commonly attached to this movement that may also be termed 'Orphic Cubism', since its ideas stemmed from that earlier movement.  Orphism, as a cohesive movement, died out in a short time, only having been prevalent for about 3 years, but its influence persists even up to the present. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these terms relates to the artwork of the Dadaists, and especially Marcel Duchamp?  \n", "correct": "Objet Trouv\u00e9", "options": ["Objet Gravure", "Objet Champlev\u00e9", "Objet Mosan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nObjet Trouv\u00e9.\n\n\tThe phrase 'Objet Trouv\u00e9' can be translated as 'found object' and refers to the various items selected by artists, usually related to Dada art, who create assemblages, collages or 'Ready-Made' works.
