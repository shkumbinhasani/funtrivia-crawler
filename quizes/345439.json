{"id": "345439", "name": "A Quiz About the Book of I Peter | Religion | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", " New Testament", " Peter (I and II)"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the first word of I Peter?", "correct": "Peter", "options": ["Perhaps", "Paul", "Pray"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 1:1, \"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, ASia and Bithynia.\"\r Peter was one of the original twelve apostles. \n"}, {"text": "What animal is Jesus compared to in I Peter 1:19?", "correct": "lamb", "options": ["goat", "cow", "pig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nlamb.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 1:19, \"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.\"\r This goes back to the Old Testament times when the Israelites would offer a sacrifice of their best lambs to atone for their sins. Jesus, to Christians, is the perfect sacrifice. Therefore he is also known as the Lamb of God. \n"}, {"text": "What do the \"stripes [by which] ye were healed\" refer to in I Peter 2:24?", "correct": "The scars made on Jesus' back when he was scourged", "options": ["The grain in the wood that the cross was made from", "Stripes on the flag of Israel", "Bandages covering a wound"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe scars made on Jesus' back when he was scourged.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 2:24, referring to Jesus, \"Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.\"\r The scars are a result of being flogged with a cat o' nine tails before He was crucified. \n"}, {"text": "What animals are we (humans) compared to in I Peter 2:25 in the KJV?", "correct": "sheep", "options": ["horses", "cows", "donkeys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsheep.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 2:25, \"For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.\"\r In chapter 1, Jesus is compared to a lamb. In this verse he is compared to a Shepherd and we are the sheep. This is presented as a mark of a good leader. A good leader can lead, and can be led when needed. He can serve, and be served. \n"}, {"text": "According to Peter, should his readers return evil for evil?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 3:9, \"Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.\" \r It can be very difficult not to seek revenge when someone has wronged one. Many people strongly believe in the Code of Hammurabi (that is, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth). However, Peter says in this chapter that this is not how we should live. This may not make sense -- why be good to someone who was evil to you? -- but there is a saying, \"Kill them with kindness.\" When you are good to someone instead of seeking revenge, they very well may change their ways. At the very least, whether they show it or not, when you are kind to them, it forces them to reflect on what they've done in most cases. \n"}, {"text": "According to Peter in chapter 3, what question should his readers always be ready to answer?", "correct": "Why they have hope", "options": ["Why they go to church", "Why they love their mom", "Why they were baptized"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhy they have hope.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 3:15, \"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.\" \r For a Christian that answer is often the hope of Jesus returning one day to take His people to Heaven. \n"}, {"text": "What shall \"cover the multitude of sins\" according to I Peter 4:8 (KJV)?", "correct": "charity", "options": ["hope", "praise", "faith"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncharity.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 4:8, \"and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.\"\r Another word for charity in this context is love. What this means is that true love can see past the imperfections. \n"}, {"text": "What does chapter 4 say readers should be happy to suffer as?", "correct": "Christians", "options": ["Evildoers", "Murderers", "Thieves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristians.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 4:15-16, \"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.\" \r Because Christ suffered for His people, this verse says they should be happy to suffer in His Name. \n"}, {"text": "What animal is the devil compared to in chapter 5?", "correct": "lion", "options": ["bear", "tiger", "elephant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nlion.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 5:8, \"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour \"\r A lion is a beautiful animal and may seem friendly but cannot be trusted. In the jungle, when food is sparse, a lion will even turn on another lion. Likewise, Satan cannot be trusted. \n"}, {"text": "How does Peter say to greet one another in the KJV?", "correct": "With a kiss of charity", "options": ["With a great big hug", "With a kiss from me to you", "With a secret hand shake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith a kiss of charity.\n\n\tIt says in I Peter 5:14, \"Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.\" \n"}]}
