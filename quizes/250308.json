The measure of an angle can be negative or positive, depending on the direction of its rotation.  Which direction of rotation returns negative angles: counter-clockwise (ccw) or clockwise (cw)?", "correct": "cw & CW", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ncw & CW.\n\n\tThis is often confusing to students, as angles in geometry are always positive. \n"}, {"text": "The two main trigonometric functions, sine (sin) and cosine (cos) differ by the addition of the prefix \"co\" to \"cosine.\"  From where does the \"co\" derive?", "correct": "Complementary", "options": ["Constraint", "Coefficient", "Constant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComplementary.\n\n\tSine and cosine are known as cofunctions to each other; i.e., the sin of an angle is the same as the cosine of that angle's complement [sin(A) = cos(90-A) and cos(A) = sin(90-A)].\r Other cofunction pairs are tangent/cotangent and secant/cosecant. \n"}, {"text": "The functions cotangent, secant, and cosecant have what relationship to the functions tangent, cosine, and sine (respectively)?", "correct": "reciprocal", "options": ["cofunctions", "inverse", "supplementary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nreciprocal.\n\n\tUsing reference triangle parameters, cot A = x/y, csc A = r/y, and sec A = r/x.  These are reciprocals of the definitions for tangent (tan A = y/x), sine (sin A = y/r), and cosine (cos A = x/r).\r This relationship can also be expressed as cot A = 1/tan A, csc A = 1/sin A, and sec A = 1/cos A.\r Also, the terms inverse and reciprocal are sometimes used synonymously in other diciplines.  Reciprocal is more correctly the multiplicitive inverse.  A regular inverse is a relation that interchanges the domain and range of another relation.  For example: y=2x+8 and x=2y+8 would be inverses of each other, as their domain and range variables are swapped. \n"}, {"text": "Angles are measured in degrees or in radians.  The conversion factor with which to multiply to convert from degrees to radians is:", "correct": "pi/180", "options": ["180/pi", "1/2pi", "2pi"], "explanation": "\n\n\npi/180.\n\n\tThere are 360 degrees (2pi radians) in a full circular rotation.  The ratio of radians to degrees is therefore 2pi/360, or pi/180. \n"}, {"text": "The sine function is an odd function (as opposed to even).

Three of these are called Pythagorean Identities, because they are based on the Pythagorean Theorem.

The difference identity adds its terms.\r And remember: The trigonometric functions are *not* distributive; i.e., cos(A+B) does *not* equal cos A + cos B. \n"}, {"text": "If you know the following data about a triangle and wish to solve the triangle (find all the missing side and/or angle values), which one is ambiguous; i.e., there may be zero, one, or two solutions for the missing values?", "correct": "Two sides and an angle opposite one side", "options": ["Three sides", "Two sides and the included angle", "Two angles and any side"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo sides and an angle opposite one side.\n\n\tIf you know three sides, you can use the Law of Cosines to solve for the angles.\r If you know two sides and the included angle, again you can use the Law of Cosines to solve for the missing side, then solve for the missing angles.\r If you know two angles and any side, you can first use the Interior Angle Theorem to solve for the missing angle.  Then, you can use the Law of Sines to solve for the missing two sides.\r However, knowing two sides and an angle opposite can have 6 different variations: 2 have no solution, 3 have 1 solution, and 1 has two different solutions. \n"}, {"text": "Inverses: the relations \"arcsin x\" and \"Arcsin x\" differ in spelling because the latter's name is capitalized.  What is the distinction of the capitalization?", "correct": "capitalized spelling indicates limited range", "options": ["no difference", "capitalized indicates return value is in radians", "capitalized indicates relation is graphed in polar coordinates"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncapitalized spelling indicates limited range.\n\n\tBy restricting the range of the corresponding inverse relation, it is possible to define an inverse function for all the trigonometric inverses. \n"}]}
