The ant started panicking and the queen (voiced by Phyllis Diller) had to calm him down and show him that he could walk around the leaf. The hesitation in the ant caused a small gap in the line and made the princess-in-waiting panic. The queen had to calm her daughter (voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) down as well. \n"}, {"text": "Which actor voiced the role of leader of the grasshoppers, Hopper?", "correct": "Kevin Spacey", "options": ["Brad Pitt", "Tyrone Power", "Michael J.
