{"id": "206811", "name": "How Safe are You? Online Trivia | General | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Family Life"], "questions": [{"text": "According to the National Safety Council, which of the following is responsible for causing the most burns to a person in a home?", "correct": "Improper placement of pots and pans on a stove", "options": ["Improper bathtub temperature", "Mixing of cleaning chemicals", "Working on the family car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nImproper placement of pots and pans on a stove.\n\n\tThe kitchen is the most hazardous room in the house.  By far, it is improper placement of pots and pans with the handle protruding beyond the border of the stove.  They are either bumped or caught by clothing.  This is a major issue with children's injuries also.  The number two burn factor was cleaning gas stoves with cleaning agents that ignite. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is a component that protects a person from electrocution?", "correct": "Ground fault interrupter (GFI)", "options": ["Current limiter", "Electro flow valve (EFV)", "Sump shutoff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGround fault interrupter (GFI).\n\n\tGFIs are electrical outlets which sense a sudden surge of power, then act like a circuit breaker and 'trip', thus stopping current flow.  Ground fault interrupters are mainly used in bathrooms and areas that have close water access.  It is wise to have GFIs installed in every outlet in a home, but can be expensive.  The first GFI was marketed in 1965 when used with swimming pool systems. \n"}, {"text": "When setting up a 12-foot ladder against a house, how far should the base of the ladder be placed away from the wall?", "correct": "3 feet", "options": ["2 feet", "5 feet", "It doesn't matter"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3 feet.\n\n\tThe proper ratio is 25% or 1/4.  An eight-foot ladder should be placed two feet away from a wall.  Placing a ladder too far from the structure may result in ladder failure, as most are not made to withstand an increased horizontal weight support. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following does the National Safety Council state during Christmas time?", "correct": "Outdoor light bulbs should point downward", "options": ["It is best for a tree to be displayed for 14-20 days in a home", "Lights function best on metallic-foil trees", "Do not use off-tree floodlights for firs and cedar trees"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOutdoor light bulbs should point downward.\n\n\tInstalling lighting with the bulbs pointing downward prevents rain or snow from filling up the sockets with water, resulting in short-circuiting.  Using lights on a metallic-foil tree might look good, but any shorting in the lights will energize the entire tree.  Firs and cedar trees are the driest, and off-tree floodlights are recommended for safety.  It is recommended that a live tree not be displayed for more than eight days. \n"}, {"text": "According to a study by the American Mutual Liability Insurance Co., which of the following outdoor items resulted in the most injuries or deaths in the 1990s?", "correct": "Lawn mowers", "options": ["Water skis", "Table saws", "Footballs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLawn mowers.\n\n\tEvery year in the 1990s, more than 200,000 toes or fingers were lost due to mostly careless use of power lawn mowers.  Almost one-third of lawn mower accidents involved innocent bystanders being hit with flying projectiles.  A rotary blade travels more than 200 MPH. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is a true driving statement?", "correct": "Light rain after a dry spell makes the road the slickest", "options": ["When an oncoming car has their 'brights' on, flash yours to let them know", "Tailgating in fog helps a driver follow the roadways", "Lower tire pressure in cold temperatures provides better traction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLight rain after a dry spell makes the road the slickest.\n\n\tAfter a dry spell, a light rain mixes with oils and dirt on roads which result in a very slick condition.  Heavy rains wash these away.  If you are blinded by an opposing vehicle's headlights, flashing yours will just blind them also while coming towards you.  Never under-inflate tires as the sidewalls of tires make the vehicle handle more erratically.  Also, one should never tailgate under any circumstances. \n"}, {"text": "According to the New York Poison Control Center in 2004, which hours of the day brought in the most phone calls concerning the poisoning of children?", "correct": "Noon - 6pm", "options": ["6am - noon", "Midnight - 6am", "6pm - midnight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNoon - 6pm.\n\n\tIt has been determined that between noon and 6pm, children are the most active, and the home is the busiest.  It would seem that this time frame would be an added parent-focused one. \n"}, {"text": "The National Electrical Code in the U.S. mandated that newly built homes carry at least a 100-amp service in 1956.  Prior to 1956, the standard was how many amps to a private dwelling?", "correct": "60 amps", "options": ["75 amps", "150 amps", "200 amps"], "explanation": "\n\n\n60 amps.\n\n\tA 60-amp service means that a home will easily handle 60 amps of power that is fed into it throughout the home.  Post 1956 homes were built to accept 100 amps.  A pre-1956 home will have wiring that will easily overload when pulling 100 amps throughout the home, and fires could result.  It is recommended that extension cords not be used in these older homes, and circuit breakers not be rated more than 15 amps. \n"}, {"text": "According to the National Fire Protection Association, which has been the largest contributing factor for deaths during a home fire in 2004?", "correct": "No building escape plan had been made prior", "options": ["No installed smoke detectors in the home", "Sleeping in a bedroom with the door closed", "Sleeping on non-fire proof mattresses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo building escape plan had been made prior.\n\n\tThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, the lack of smoke detectors was the number one contributor, but due to new laws and public awareness, having no fire escape plan has surpassed the detectors by far.  A one minute family discussion three times per year is a smart investment in the quality of life.  It is also recommended that people who sleep in a bedroom, do this with the door closed, as this will give the occupant additional time to escape before being overcome by heat or smoke. \n"}, {"text": "What does a label on an appliance marked \"UL\" mean?", "correct": "That the item was tested and approved by Underwriters Laboratory", "options": ["Unsafe for use with lawns and gardens", "That the item is not recommended in under-load (UL) conditions", "To read operating instructions 'under label' before operating appliance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat the item was tested and approved by Underwriters Laboratory.\n\n\tThe 'UL' tag should be on all electrical and electronic items in a home.  This certifies that the item has met all U.S. federal and standard safety guidelines.  Caution should be exercised when purchasing electronic items in online auctions, because these safety standards can differ from country to country, and some have no standards whatsoever. \n"}]}
