{"id": "173783", "name": "\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\", Quiz II of II | Movies | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Star Trek", "ST IV: The Voyage Home"], "questions": [{"text": "When Spock (Leonard Nimoy) asks Kirk (William Shatner) why the admiral has taken to using profanity since their arrival in 1986, Kirk notes that such language is prevalent in the \"classic literature\" of the time.  Which author does he NOT name while making this point?", "correct": "Danielle Steel", "options": ["Jacqueline Susann", "Harold Robbins", "He references all of these authors."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDanielle Steel.\n\n\tKirk: \"Jacqueline Susann.  Harold Robbins.\"  Spock: \"Ah.  The giants.\"  A bit of an in-joke, since Susann and Robbins are well-known for writing trashy, sensationalistic material.  Could their works somehow become \"classics\" in the 23rd century...? \n"}, {"text": "Two whales play an integral role in the plot.  They were presumably named after a famous comedy team.  Which one?", "correct": "Burns and Allen", "options": ["Nichols and May", "Abbott and Costello", "Laurel and Hardy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurns and Allen.\n\n\tThe whales are named George and Gracie.  George Burns and Gracie Allen were a highly popular comedy team in the days of vaudeville, radio, and even early television. \n"}, {"text": "Catherine Hicks plays Dr. Gillian Taylor, the scientist who assists the crew of the former ENTERPRISE in their 1986 adventure.  Originally, though, executives at Paramount Pictures wanted the role of the scientist to be played by a major star of the day.  Which one?", "correct": "Eddie Murphy", "options": ["Sigourney Weaver", "Tom Hanks", "Whoopi Goldberg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEddie Murphy.\n\n\tMurphy, a huge \"Trek\" fan, came THIS close to playing the role...but according to Leonard Nimoy's DVD commentary, Paramount balked at the last minute, deciding that it was too big a gamble to combine their two most successful franchises (\"Trek\" and \"Beverly Hills Cop\") in a single film. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Gillian Taylor has an unusual talent.  What is it?", "correct": "She has a photographic memory.", "options": ["She is ambidextrous.", "She can understand the language of whales.", "She can ride a unicycle."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe has a photographic memory.\n\n\tGillian states this fact, and proves it, when she \"replays\" aloud a sentence that Spock had earlier spoken to Kirk...word for word.  \"I have a photographic memory,\" she says.  \"I SEE words.\"  She does seem to have an affinity for \"her\" whales, but there's no evidence that she actually understands the sounds they make. \n"}, {"text": "Gillian offers to take Kirk and Spock to dinner.  What kind of restaurant does she suggest?", "correct": "Italian", "options": ["Chinese", "Japanese", "Greek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItalian.\n\n\tGillian: \"You guys like Italian?\"  Nimoy states that the hilarious response(s) that Kirk and Spock provide grew out of an improvisation session.  I found it to be one of the funniest moments in the film! \n"}, {"text": "Spock winds up declining the dinner invitation, but Kirk accepts.  Once at the restaurant, Gillian orders a beer with her dinner.  What kind of beer?", "correct": "Michelob", "options": ["Anchor Steam", "Sam Adams", "Miller Genuine Draft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichelob.\n\n\tShe orders a Michelob with her pizza, and Kirk, apparently unfamiliar with 20th-century cuisine, simply asks for the same thing Gillian is having.  The look on his face when he first tastes the beer is quite amusing. \n"}, {"text": "Meanwhile, Scotty (James Doohan) and McCoy (DeForest Kelley) flirt with \"history tampering\" when they give the formula for a certain type of aluminum to a scientist in 1986, well before it's been officially \"invented.\"  What kind of aluminum is it?", "correct": "transparent", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ntransparent.\n\n\tScotty quells McCoy's concerns about altering the timeline by asking, \"How do we know he didn't invent the thing?\"  Circular logic, perhaps...but time travel is tricky stuff.  =) \n"}, {"text": "At one point, Kirk and his crew have the opportunity to leave 1986 Earth and head back to the 23rd century, but they don't, because one of the crew is still helpless and incapacitated in 1986.  Which one?", "correct": "Chekov", "options": ["Sulu", "Scotty", "Uhura"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChekov.\n\n\tChekov is captured during his foray into the belly of an aircraft carrier (the USS ENTERPRISE, in fact!).  When he attempts to flee his captors, he falls a significant distance, suffers serious internal damage, and is held in a hospital where he is not expected to survive.  Kirk refuses to leave without his crewmember and engineers a rescue. \n"}, {"text": "While in the hospital, McCoy cures an elderly woman of a chronic disease in seconds.  Which of her organs did he repair on the spot?", "correct": "her kidney", "options": ["her lung", "her liver", "her heart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nher kidney.\n\n\tThe woman is scheduled for a dialysis treatment.  McCoy, disgusted with the \"barbaric\" medical practices of the 20th century, gives her a pill.  A few scenes later, the woman is ecstatic, cheering about the doctor who gave her a magic pill that let her grow a new kidney! \n"}, {"text": "Also during the hospital sequence, Gillian pretends to be a patient, and even lies on a gurney and moans in fake pain.  In order to get past some guards, McCoy barks out that his \"patient\" has \"immediate post-prandial upper abdominal distension.\"  Once past the guards, Kirk asks McCoy, \"What did you say she had?\"  What is McCoy's one-word response?", "correct": "cramps", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ncramps.\n\n\tAh, gastrointestinal humor.  Always an easy laugh... with certain audiences. \n"}, {"text": "A phaser is successfully fired exactly once in this movie.  Who or what is its target?", "correct": "a doorknob", "options": ["a whaling ship", "the alien probe", "an FBI agent"], "explanation": "\n\n\na doorknob.\n\n\tKirk fires a Klingon phaser at a doorknob in the hospital, melting it to slag and trapping several doctors and nurses in a small room in order to facilitate the rescue of Chekov.  Yes, Chekov earlier TRIED to fire a phaser at an FBI agent, but the phaser didn't work.  (Note the word \"successfully\" in the question.)  Not a lot of violence in this film...in fact, according to Nimoy, this is the only \"Trek\" film in history in which no one dies! \n"}, {"text": "The whales have been fitted with transmitters so that Gillian and her colleagues can track them.  On what frequency do these transmitters send their signals?", "correct": "401 MHz", "options": ["201 MHz", "301 MHz", "501 MHz"], "explanation": "\n\n\n401 MHz.\n\n\tGillian is at first reluctant to give Kirk this information, but she eventually trusts him enough to let him try to save her precious whales. \n"}, {"text": "In this film, Kirk FINALLY says the famous line, \"Beam me up, Scotty.\"", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tClose, but no cigar.  Just before the BOUNTY takes off from its hiding place in Golden Gate Park, Kirk says, \"Scotty, beam me up\" into his communicator.  Despite the fact that \"Beam me up, Scotty\" is generally known as a \"famous\" line from \"Star Trek,\" no one has ever spoken that line, on television or in the films! \n"}, {"text": "According to Scotty, how much extra weight will the BOUNTY be taking on once it beams aboard the two whales and the water they need to survive?", "correct": "400 tons", "options": ["800 tons", "600 tons", "1000 tons"], "explanation": "\n\n\n400 tons.\n\n\tScotty warns Kirk that he's never beamed up 400 tons (whales plus water) before.  I found it odd that Scotty measured the extra load in weight instead of mass...but hey, what do I know? \n"}, {"text": "Once the whales are aboard the BOUNTY, Kirk impresses Gillian by quoting a famous Earth writer.  Which one?", "correct": "D. H. Lawrence", "options": ["William Shakespeare", "T. S. Eliot", "Charles Dickens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nD. H. Lawrence\n\n\tWhen Kirk recites a line from Lawrence's poem \"Whales Weep Not!\", Gillian recognizes it immediately. \n"}, {"text": "Once the whales are brought back (well, forward) to the 23rd century, they do in fact communicate successfully with the alien probe that has been destroying Earth with its transmissions.  What is the main point of the probe's message?", "correct": "It's never revealed.", "options": ["\"We are dying.\"", "\"Where have you been?\"", "\"We have come to take you home.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's never revealed.\n\n\tWe can speculate and theorize all we want, but we have absolutely no idea what the probe and whales are actually saying to each other.  Nimoy's commentary notes that certain executives at Paramount demanded that subtitles be put into the film, translating the conversation.  Nimoy outright refused, saying that the audience didn't need to know exactly what was being communicated.  I tend to agree. \n"}, {"text": "Every single time we see whales in this film, we are looking at animatronics and other special effects -- in other words, no actual whales appear in this film.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThere are several shots near the end of the film that are taken from actual humpback whale footage.  In fact, if you look very closely as one of the whales \"dances\" after the probe has left and clear skies return to Earth, you can see a massive island in the far left background.  That's Hawaii's Big Island, even though the scene is supposed to be taking place in San Francisco Bay! \n"}, {"text": "Kirk and crew eventually stand before the Federation Council to receive their court-martial.  How many of the original charges mentioned early in the film have been dismissed by the end of the court-martial?", "correct": "all but one", "options": ["all of them", "none of them", "one of them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nall but one.\n\n\tThe Council President states early in the film that Kirk and his crew have been charged with nine violations of Federation law.  Oddly, only six are mentioned at the actual court-martial...and the President decides to dismiss all of the charges except for one.  Kirk is charged with disobeying a direct order from a superior officer.  For this, he is reduced to the rank of Captain.  This is, of course, not much of a punishment, since commanding a starship is, as Spock once said, Kirk's \"first, best destiny.\" \n"}, {"text": "What happens to Gillian Taylor at the end of this film?", "correct": "She is assigned to a science vessel in the 23rd century.", "options": ["She is appointed the whales' caretaker in San Francisco.", "She is sent back in time to the 20th century.", "She is given a commission and assigned to the new ENTERPRISE, under Kirk's command."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe is assigned to a science vessel in the 23rd century.\n\n\tOne would think that -- as Gillian herself suggested after deciding to come to the future with Kirk -- her expertise with whales would make her invaluable to 23rd-century marine biologists now saddled with two humpback whales...but, no.  She tells Kirk that she has been assigned to a \"science vessel,\" and has 300 years of scientific achievements to catch up on.  Weird. \n"}, {"text": "And finally -- what is the last word spoken in this film?", "correct": "got", "options": ["thataway", "Sulu", "home"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngot.\n\n\tThe last line of the film -- spoken by Kirk, of course, from the captain's chair of the brand-new ENTERPRISE -- is, \"Let's see what she's got.\" \n"}]}
