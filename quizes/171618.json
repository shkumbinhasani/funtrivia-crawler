{"id": "171618", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Hawkeye Get Your Gun' Trivia Game | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 5"], "questions": [{"text": "It's a particularly long and grueling session in the O.R., Colonel Potter has been busy for 24 hours straight!  Which member of the 4077th makes the mistake of suggesting that the Colonel is 'old'?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Margaret", "Hawkeye", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tAs per usual, Frank's distinct flair for social faux pas gets the best of him.  Frank offers to replace Potter at his operating table, raising the fact that Potter is old.  Potter's response is to suggest that he can match Frank 'incision for incision, suture for suture, clamp for clamp and patient for patient!'  Hawkeye adds, 'But not goof for goof.' \n"}, {"text": "After the O.R. session we see Colonel Potter painting a lovely picture of Hawkeye in his drab green army fatigues.  Suddenly, Klinger bursts into the Colonel's office, claiming to be '______, King of the Gypsies'.  What is his fictitious name (that goes in the blank) for this latest Section Eight scam?", "correct": "Zoltan", "options": ["Malkor", "Galtaro", "Kossos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZoltan.\n\n\tWhen Klinger first enters Potter's office in his new gypsy costume Potter exclaims, 'Klinger, go put on a dress!'  His costume comes complete with tambourine, an instrument with which, I might add, Jamie Farr appears quite adept. \n"}, {"text": "Now the scene shifts to the mess tent where we see Frank in line with BJ ready to chow down on some fine army cuisine.  Frank seems particularly bitter on this day, and why not, the kitchen has run out of what key menu item?", "correct": "Rhubarb", "options": ["Onions", "Eggplant", "Squash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRhubarb.\n\n\tFrank seems desperate for a little rhubarb and when he is informed that the rhubarb has been consumed he throws a mini-fit.  I think the guy is just generally unhappy.  When he is seated with the other officers he has even more reason to whine, Colonel Potter is provided with a special bowl filled with rhubarb. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter informs his doctors that the Korean Army Hospital 426 has requested the assistance of two American doctors.  Rather than call for volunteers, Potter decides on a very sophisticated selection process which involves the random drawing of which items?", "correct": "Playing cards", "options": ["Sausages", "Spaghetti noodles", "Straws"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlaying cards.\n\n\tPotter announces that the 'two low cards go for a ride'.  BJ draws a ten, the lucky devil.  Frank draws a five, while Hawkeye draws a three.  The Colonel then draws a two, prompting Frank to complain, 'Well, that's a gyp!  That means you go and I stay.'  Frank quickly understands the depth of the situation and adds, 'Oh, that's good.' \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter and Hawkeye are the unlucky chaps who are 'volunteered' for the mission.  On their way towards the Korean hospital the road is heavily shelled by enemy fire.  Do they lose their jeep on the trip to the Korean hospital?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe jeep remains intact on their trip to the Korean hospital, it's on their return that the jeep is bombed and destroyed.  Fortunately, Hawkeye and Potter have left the jeep before it becomes fodder for enemy fire! \n"}, {"text": "Potter and Hawkeye are greeted at the dismal and dirty Korean hospital by a local surgeon named Major Choi.  Which long-time guest actor portrays the role of Dr. Choi in this episode?", "correct": "Mako", "options": ["Jack Soo", "Soon Teck Oh", "Byron Chung"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMako.\n\n\tMako was one of my favorite of the 'M*A*S*H' guest-stars.  Though a Japanese-born actor, he portrayed a number of different Korean characters in the series.  You may also recognize Mako as the actor who played Admiral Isoruku Yamamoto in the movie 'Pearl Harbor' or perhaps in his roles as Kungo Tsarong in 'Seven Years in Tibet' or Yoshida in 'Rising Sun'. \n"}, {"text": "After a distinctly long stint in the O.R. at the Korean hospital we see Colonel Potter and Hawkeye resting and chatting sleepily.  Hawkeye bets Colonel Potter that he can put him to sleep by saying the word 'sleep' three times.  The plan backfires as he puts himself to sleep.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tHawkeye claims, 'If I say the word 'sleep' three times to you, I'd put you right under.'  Potter stubbornly stays awake, perhaps still irked by Frank Burn's suggestions that he is old and tired.  My favorite exchange from this scene: Hawkeye asks the Colonel when they started surgery, to which Potter replies, 'I started surgery in 1932'.  Hawkeye responds, 'I meant this session'.  Potter retorts, 'So did I.' \n"}, {"text": "On their return to the 4077th, Hawkeye and Potter discover that Klinger has secretly stocked their canteen with a nice dose of the 'hard stuff'.  Which of these do the two of them NOT toast while sipping away at their liquor stash?", "correct": "Frank Burns' chin", "options": ["Klinger's nose", "Potter's nose", "Charles de Gaulle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank Burns' chin.\n\n\tThey toast Klinger, his nose ('That's a double!'), Zoltan, Zoltan's nose ('That's a double!'), Charles de Gaulle and his nose (another 'double') and Colonel Potter's nose ('That's a half!')  Their drunken revelry doesn't last long as the shelling begins anew and they are forced to abandon the jeep (see question 5). \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Potter find themselves under fire once again and manage to find themselves a bunker.  While in this bunker the semi-drunken Colonel Potter fires his gun randomly into the nearby bushes.  He then insists that Hawkeye do the same, to which the latter refuses.  Hawkeye suggests that he will do all but which of the following?  ", "correct": "Inflict their wounds", "options": ["Bind their wounds", "Treat their wounds", "Heal their wounds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInflict their wounds.\n\n\tColonel Potter insists that Hawkeye fire his weapon, to which Hawkeye responds by looking at the gun and announcing, 'You're fired'.  Colonel Potter then adds, 'Hawkeye, that was an order'.  'Oh waiter, would you take this man's order,' Hawkeye retorts.  When Potter persists, Hawkeye suggests that he will 'treat their wounds, heal their wounds, bind their wounds but will not inflict their wounds.'  Potter finally convinces Hawkeye by requesting that he use his gun as a 'noisemaker' to scare off the enemy.  Hawkeye proceeds to fires his gun straight into the air in response. \n"}, {"text": "Potter and Hawkeye are 'rescued' from their bunker by some American soldiers who have apparently cleared the enemy troops from the area.  In order to prove that they are American, Hawkeye says 'Betty Grable' and 'apple pie'.  Colonel Potter adds the name of what other Hollywood star?", "correct": "Clara Bow", "options": ["Greer Garson", "Joan Crawford", "Lillian Gish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClara Bow.\n\n\tHawkeye is surprised by this mention, looking at the Colonel and saying, 'Clara Bow?  Frank's right, you are old.'  Earlier in the episode, Hawkeye suggested that in the poorly lit O.R. at the Korean hospital the Colonel looked just like Greer Garson in 'Mrs. Miniver'.  Who the heck are all these actresses anyhow?  Thanks for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
