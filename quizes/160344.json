R. Tolkien", "The Return of the King"], "questions": [{"text": "Aragorn's party, which includes his fellow D\u00fanedain, the sons of Elrond, and, of course, Legolas and Gimli, is now making its way through the dreaded Paths of the Dead.  According to a poem, read by Aragorn earlier, what is the name of the stone at which his party must stop to meet the Oathbreakers who dwell along the Paths of the Dead?  ", "correct": "Stone of Erech", "options": ["Stone of Elessar", "Stone of Evermind", "Stone of Elanor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStone of Erech.\n\n\tThe Paths of the Dead are a terror to behold for any mortal mind, and Gimli most of all seems susceptible to the frightening environment.  Only Legolas, who feels not the dread felt by his companions, remains unshaken along the Paths.  When the party reaches the Stone of Erech, a black globe half-buried upon a hill, the Shadow-men appear.  Aragorn announces himself as Elessar, heir of Isildur, and receives the oath of the long-dead warriors.  They will follow their king into battle. \n"}, {"text": "Back at Edoras, Th\u00e9oden is reunited with his sister-daughter \u00c9owyn.  He and his men intend to make their way towards Gondor to join the great battle against the hordes of Sauron, but in due time.  Unfortunately, however, a messenger from Gondor arrives with news of Denethor's desperate need for immediate assistance.  An arrow of what color has been sent to Edoras, to emphasize the grave nature of the situation?  ", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Blue", "Grey", "Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tWhen Th\u00e9oden sees the Red Arrow, a symbol which he has never seen before but well understands the meaning of, he reacts with some discouragement, but soon regains his resolve.  The Riders will have to speed quickly to Gondor in order that they may help their cousins in peril! \n"}, {"text": "With the hastening of the mission, Merry and \u00c9owyn both find themselves in the position of having to see the Riders of Rohan off, while they remain behind at Edoras.  This situation suits neither of them well, and both resolve to make their way furtively to the war in Gondor.   \u00c9owyn disguises herself as a Rider, and takes the as yet unaware Merry along with her.  By what name does \u00c9owyn call herself?  ", "correct": "Dernhelm", "options": ["Fenmarch", "Noldor", "Ciryandil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDernhelm.\n\n\tThe war is no place for a woman or a halfling, at least according to Th\u00e9oden.  Hence, poor \u00c9owyn and Merry, who both desire nothing less than to fight with their friends in the desperate battle against the forces of Mordor, are to be left behind at Edoras.  Naturally, neither of them is willing to just stand idly by, and both sneak their way along with the Riders upon the horse Windfola. \n"}, {"text": "At Minas Tirith, Faramir has returned to update his father of the situation on the battlefield while Gandalf and Pippin look on.  Denethor is rather displeased with Faramir for several reasons, but finds him wise at least to have avoided the same mistake that befell his brother Boromir, that is, attempting to acquire the Ring of Power.  ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, this is precisely why Denethor is most upset, and why he acknowledges the wish that it might have been Faramir, and not Boromir, who was killed in battle.  Denethor is corrupted by the notion that he could somehow wield the mighty power of the ring in order to confront the very master of said power, Sauron himself.  Faramir stands up proudly in the face of his father's wrath, knowing he has done the correct thing. \n"}, {"text": "With Faramir off defending Osgiliath once again, war approaches Gondor.  The forces of Mordor begin by breaking down the walls of the Pelennor, after which they make their way towards Minas Tirith.  They are led by the Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl, the Captain of the Ringwraiths; ancient King of which region?  ", "correct": "Angmar", "options": ["Rhudaur", "Khand", "Eriador"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAngmar.\n\n\tAngmar is a place to be found at the very north tip of the Misty Mountains.  There, long ago, the Witch-King exercised his wicked rule.  Now, he is the Captain of Despair, the hand of Sauron and Ruler of the Nazg\u00fbl.  When Gandalf brings news of his arrival to Denethor, the King simply mocks our friendly wizard, claiming that Mithrandir (Gandalf) has met his match. \n"}, {"text": "The final straw of Denethor's sanity is plucked when Faramir returns, having been struck by a Southron dart.  When Denethor sees his son's body, sickened by the evil poison of the black dart, he insists on locking himself away, concerning himself no longer with the war at his city's gates.  He tells his men that they should follow whom they will, even if it be Gandalf, to whom he refers to with what derogatory name?  ", "correct": "Grey Fool", "options": ["Grey Beard", "Old Beard", "Old Fool"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrey Fool.\n\n\tDenethor never really liked Gandalf much, claiming that bad news always followed the (formerly) grey wizard.  Certainly his advice suits Gandalf well; the wizard is more than happy to take command of the forces of Gondor against Sauron's fiendish throng. \n"}, {"text": "The wicked swarms of Mordor approach the outer gates of Minas Tirith, but find them nearly inpenetrable.  Nearly, I say, because there is one device in their possession which may effectively burst through the mighty outer portals of the city.  What did the smithies of Mordor call this device (a massive battering ram)?  ", "correct": "Grond", "options": ["Slurg", "Aiglos", "Cram"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrond.\n\n\tGrond was fashioned from a 100-foot forest tree, with chains attached in order to produce a thunderous result when it is applied to even the most powerfully erected gates.  At the head of Grond, fashioned in steel, is the horrible likeness of a voracious wolf, guaranteed to strike fear in the hearts of mortal men!  The ram is so large that it takes the power of mountain-trolls to wield it.  After three mighty blows from Grond, the gates of Minas Tirith fall. \n"}, {"text": "On their way to meet the deadly foes of Gondor, the Riders of Rohan make their way through Druadan Forest where they encounter the men of the woods.  What is the term used to describe these 'wild' men?  ", "correct": "Woses", "options": ["Nordils", "Eorlingas", "Huorns"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWoses.\n\n\tThe Riders of Rohan and the Woses have never been friends, but they are united by a common enemy, namely the orcs, which the men of the woods call 'gorg\u00fbn'.   The Woses promise safe passage through their land, which hastens greatly the travel of the Riders of Rohan, and additionally they provide good intelligence to the Riders, in return for which they only ask for peaceful co-existence. \n"}, {"text": "As Minas Tirith is being laid siege, the Riders of Rohan finally arrive to join the battle.  The Riders are of course led by King Th\u00e9oden, who rides upon a horse that proves to be his bane.  What is the horse called?   \n", "correct": "Snowmane", "options": ["Felarof", "Meneldor", "Grimbold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnowmane.\n\n\tSnowmane carried Th\u00e9oden into his final battle, at the head of the Riders of Rohan.   When confronted by the Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl, the horse, being struck by a black dart, fell to its side, crushing Th\u00e9oden King underneath.  Thus, the steed that had served the great king well for so many years had become the cause of his death. \n"}, {"text": "Who came to Th\u00e9oden's aide, killing both the Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl and the beast upon which the Witch King was mounted?  ", "correct": "\u00c9owyn", "options": ["\u00c9omer", "Elfhelm", "Merry"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\u00c9owyn.\n\n\t\u00c9owyn severs the head of the frightful beast that carries the Witch King, after which she receives a gruesome blow from the Black Captain's mace, which shatters her shield and breaks her arm.  When he comes closer in order to finish his cruel work, he is stunned by the penetrating pain of Merry's sword, which strikes him behind his knee.  This provides \u00c9owyn the opportunity to finish the job, which she does, vanquishing the evil king forever.
