How many different starting Pok\u00e9mon are there in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\"?", "correct": "One", "options": ["Two", "Three", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tIn \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", you can choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle as your starting Pok\u00e9mon, but in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", you'll only be able to have Pikachu as your starting Pok\u00e9mon.  Although Pikachu won't like you at first, he'll grow to be your friend.  Another odd thing about this Pikachu is that he'll follow you throughout the game rather than stay in a Pok\u00e9ball. This means that you can only have five other Pok\u00e9mon out at all time.  You will be able to get any of the three starting Pok\u00e9mon from \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\" in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\" by asking people about them in certain cities. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", your rival will choose a Pok\u00e9mon that has a type advantage against your own.

You can also get a chance to get an Eevee using the Cut HM technique in Celadon City.  Eevee has the ability to evolve into Vaporeon, Flareon, or Jolteon when you use a Water, Fire, or Thunder Stone which can be purchased in Celadon City's department store. \n"}, {"text": "One change in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\" is the addition of Jessie and James.  Where can you not battle this duo?", "correct": "Seafoam Island", "options": ["Game Corner", "Mt. Moon", "Pok\u00e9mon Tower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeafoam Island.\n\n\tJessie and James will appear in different locations around Kanto starting with Mt. Moon.  The duo originally appeared on the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" TV series, and the two are also joined by their Pok\u00e9mon from the show as well.  Every time you battle them, they'll use their Ekans, Koffing, and Meowth (or later, an Arbok and Weezing).  The two work for Giovanni, the leader of Team Rocket. \n"}, {"text": "There is a change in the nurses at the Pok\u00e9centers between \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\".", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", the nurses were black-dressed women behind the counters of the Pok\u00e9centers.  In \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", the creators decided to switch the look of the nurses to those of Nurse Joy from the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" TV show.  In fact, not only can Nurse Joy be found behind the counter, but she's standing next to a Chansey in every Pok\u00e9center, just like in the TV show. \n"}, {"text": "Both \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\" have Pok\u00e9mon that are exclusive to their games.

Farfetch'd and Lickitung are both examples of Pok\u00e9mon found in the wild only in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\".  This idea encourages players to buy the Game Boy Link cable or \"Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\" in order to trade Pok\u00e9mon and expand their Pok\u00e9dex data. Despite this, these two Pok\u00e9mon can also be traded for in certain towns throughout Kanto.  Weedle is found in Viridian Forest in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", but it's not found in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\".
