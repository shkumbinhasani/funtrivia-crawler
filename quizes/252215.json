{"id": "252215", "name": "Water, Water Everywhere Multiple Choice Quiz | Physical Geography | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Physical Geography", "Bodies of Water"], "questions": [{"text": "The oceans are the largest sources of saltwater on our planet.  Around the planet, temperatures can be both extremely warm and extremely cold.  Are icebergs made of saltwater?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAlthough both glaciers and icebergs are found in our salty oceans, glaciers can be regarded as one of Earth's largest storage units for fresh water.  Glaciers are mostly found near the polar ice caps towards the poles, but the bergs that are broken off of these can float around the oceans as far as the equator.  Countries such as Greenland and Iceland are particularly well-known for glaciers, but they can be found on any continent in the world. \n"}, {"text": "Great Salt Lake has always been known for having very saline waters.  In which state can this lake be found?", "correct": "Utah", "options": ["Ohio", "Wyoming", "Nevada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUtah.\n\n\tThe remains of a prehistoric lake, Great Salt Lake is the most saline lake in the United States.  Due to the fact that much of its water is evaporated in the warm summer days, the lake is saltier than others.  Salt Lake City, Utah was the host of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.  It was certainly a good contender; the body of water often creates heavy lake-effect snowfall. \n"}, {"text": "The Dead Sea borders West Bank, Jordan, and which other Middle Eastern country?", "correct": "Israel", "options": ["Syria", "Lebanon", "Egypt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsrael.\n\n\tThe Dead Sea is known as the driest, lowest place on Earth, and it's one of the saltiest seas on the planet.  Tourists often come to the area's spas which make use of the sea's saline water.  The sea is also known as the Sea of Lot, named after the Biblical character whose wife was changed into a pillar of salt.  The water of this sea is so salty that anyone swimming in it will be unusually buoyant due to density. \n"}, {"text": "When a saltwater lake becomes evaporated it will become what is known as a 'salt pan'.  One such area can be found near San Francisco.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe San Francisco salt ponds make up the majority of salt beds in California, and they contain numerous endangered species.  There are numerous salt flats (or alkali flats) around the world, often in desert-like, arid regions such as the southwestern United States, Africa, and Australia.  Many salt pans are typically white and flat.  The Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah are just west of Great Salt Lake. \n"}, {"text": "Which substance, beginning with the letter B, is formed when water is fully saturated by salt?", "correct": "Brine", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrine.\n\n\tBrine was once used to preserve foods, but it has also been used while cooking meat to prevent it from dehydration while cooking.  Brine is more saline than simple saltwater with fifty parts per thousand.  Brine lakes can develop in landlocked areas.  Examples of these hypersaline bodies of water would be the Dead Sea and Great Salt Lake.  Brine pools on the other hand, are found in deep areas of the sea, where the saline areas of water settle on the ocean floor. \n"}, {"text": "What is the largest salt lake in the world?", "correct": "Caspian Sea", "options": ["Red Sea", "Lake Superior", "Black Sea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaspian Sea.\n\n\tThe Caspian Sea, located in between Iran and Russia, is technically not a sea as it is landlocked (like the Dead Sea).  The Caspian Sea is the largest 'lake' in the world, though, and it's less salty than the oceans.  The levels of water in this sea are controlled by the Volga River flowing into it from the north (Russia).  The northern end of this sea is typically freshwater due to the river, while the south is more saline. \n"}, {"text": "The Aral Sea is quite perplexing having shrunk so much over half a century.  In which continent is the Aral Sea found?", "correct": "Asia", "options": ["Europe", "Africa", "North America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsia.\n\n\tIn the early twentieth century, the rivers flowing into the Aral Sea were diverted for irrigation purposes for crops.  This had a lasting effect on what was once the world's fourth-largest sea.  Over fifty years, the sea had shrunk more than eighty percent, partially due to the loss of its sources, and also because of Eastern Asia's arid climate and the lack of precipitation in the area. \n"}, {"text": "What is the significance of Namtso, in terms of saltwater lakes?", "correct": "It's one of the world's highest saltwater lakes.", "options": ["It's one of the world's saltiest lakes.", "It's one of the world's deepest saltwater lakes.", "It's one of the world's smallest saltwater lakes."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's one of the world's highest saltwater lakes.\n\n\tNamtso, located in Tibet, is the highest elevated saltwater lake on the planet at an elevation of 4.7 kilometers above sea level.  Much like the Himalayan Mountain range, the lake is subject to weather problems (usually snow).  In Tibet, it is the second-largest lake, only second to the freshwater Qinghai Lake.  The lake is also home to monasteries and various caves. \n"}, {"text": "The oceans are the most well-known (not to mention the largest) bodies of salt water.  Approximately how much of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans?", "correct": "70%", "options": ["50%", "80%", "60%"], "explanation": "\n\n\n70%.\n\n\tThe ocean is the largest body of saltwater, with 3.5% salt.  Much like with the drying seas, people are concerned with global warming and the lowering sea levels both due to evaporation and human use.  Many areas of the world will evaporate seawater in order for us to have sea salt, which is used in cooking.  Manufacturers of sea salt are commonly found on the northeastern seaboard of the United States and the northern Mediterranean. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not a saltwater lake?", "correct": "Lake Baikal", "options": ["Salton Sea", "Lake Peigneur", "Lake Eyre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLake Baikal.\n\n\tLake Baikal is the world's deepest lake, and it's also the oldest and largest freshwater lake (by volume) in the world.  Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake by surface area.  Lake Eyre is an often near-empty lake on a salt bed in Australia.  Lake Peigneur is a saltwater lake in Louisiana.  The Salton Sea is another one of those 'seas that are actually lakes', and it's in Colorado Desert, California. \n"}]}
