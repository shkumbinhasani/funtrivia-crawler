You can use these alien beings for the first time in what game?", "correct": "Pikmin", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPikmin.\n\n\t\"Pikmin\", released in 2001 as a Gamecube exclusive, became a surprise hit for its unique playstyle.  In the game you took on the role of Captain Olimar, a pilot for the Hocotate Express who crashed on another world.  Using the local denizens, whom he dubbed Pikmin, he would be able to rebuild his ship to fly home. Each of the Pikmin performed a different task; blue ones, for instance, could go into water while others would drown.  \"Pikmin 2\" appeared on the Gamecube in 2004 and it took another nine years for a new game in the series (on the Wii U).  Olimar also became a character in \"Super Smash Bros.\" in later years. \n"}, {"text": "Created by Platinum Games for the Wii U, what game involved a mass of superheroes working together to stop GEATHJERK?", "correct": "The Wonderful 101", "options": ["Game & Wario", "Marvel: Ultimate Alliance", "Injustice: Gods Among Us"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wonderful 101.\n\n\tFrom the creators of \"MadWorld\", \"Okami\", and \"Bayonetta\", \"The Wonderful 101\" was a highly-anticipated third-party game for the Wii U, combining the interesting action of superhero games with the complexity of a strategy game.  In this title, the player could control a mob of people containing superheroes who, when transformed, could be used to combine powers and fend off the evil aliens of GEATHJERK and the CENTINELS.  The game ended up being well-received as one of the earliest major exclusives on the then-struggling console. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes working together with other players is key to your success.  In \"World of Warcraft\" (PC), Sunwell Plateau, Icecrown Citadel, and The Bastion of Twilight are all raids which can accommodate for up to how many players?", "correct": "Twenty-five", "options": ["Forty", "Five", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwenty-five.\n\n\tThe dungeons and raids of \"World of Warcraft\", though created with certain level ranges in mind, were never really meant to be played alone-- you may remember that the term MMORPG begins with 'Massively Multi-Player'...\rWhile most dungeons are five-man ventures, raids can take between ten and forty players, the average running at twenty-five, especially in end-game raids for each expansion.  These are subsequently split into five groups of five under most circumstances and raid groups commonly form in hub towns depending on the expansion.  Sunwell Plateau and Icecrown Citadel are the final dungeons of \"Burning Crusade\" and \"Wrath of the Lich King\" respectively while The Bastion of Twilight is in \"Cataclysm\".  All three can hold up to twenty-five players. \n"}, {"text": "Think about a snowball-- the more you roll, the more you roll up.  This is the general basis of what PS2 game involving a sticky ball created by the King of All Cosmos?", "correct": "We Love Katamari", "options": ["Rock of Ages", "Radiant Historia", "The Getaway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe Love Katamari.\n\n\t\"We Love Katamari\" was one in the \"Katamari\" series for Sony consoles and handhelds (which began with \"Katamari Damacy\" in 2004.  The concept was simple: roll things up; toss them into the sky.  If it sounds weird, it was weird (for the sake of weird).  You played a young prince sent to refill the night sky.  To do so you needed to roll a sticky ball known as a katamari through the stages, picking things up until the creation grew to massive sizes.  The larger the katamari, the better your score; some katamaris would begin 1cm in diameter; others would begin much larger.\rThe game was made by Namco and remains a cult classic. \n"}, {"text": "You are a God to cyclops-warriors with pointy sticks in what series originally on the PSP?", "correct": "Patapon", "options": ["God of War", "Ape Escape", "Lemmings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatapon.\n\n\t\"Patapon\", solely on the Sony handhelds for a time, started in 2008 as a cute game involving rhythm mechanics and battle simulation.  You played as an omniscient being with a drum beat and, when you beat the drum with different button combinations (Pata Pata Pata PON!) you could sway your armies of little creatures to fight the evil Zigotons.  The game was successful enough to warrant a sequel in 2009 and another in 2011.  All three were met with critical praise. \n"}, {"text": "Having more Peashooters on your lawn is probably the best strategy in what RTS/casual PC game by Popcap which relies on Sun to expand your fortifications?", "correct": "Plants Vs. Zombies", "options": ["Viva Pinata", "Zuma", "Peggle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlants Vs. Zombies\n\n\t\"Plants Vs. Zombies\" ended up finding a great deal of popularity after its release in 2009 on the PC and, like \"Peggle\" before it, brought Popcap to a much broader audience (than when it just had \"Bewjeweled\" under its belt).  In the game you had to protect your precious brains from zombie forces crossing your front and back yards and, inevitably, your roof (and down through the chimney).  To do so you had to use special plants, placing them on a grid to maximize your defenses.  Having a good stock of plants, the more the better, could lead you to a victory! \n"}, {"text": "Originally released as a WiiWare title, in what award-winning independent game did more of your resources allow you an easier time reaching the ending pipe?", "correct": "World of Goo", "options": ["LostWinds", "Helix", "Mercury Meltdown Revolution"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld of Goo.\n\n\tReleased in 2008, \"World of Goo\" was the debut game from 2D Boy and after appearing on WiiWare it found instant success, spreading to other platforms.  In the game you needed to use a limited amount of goo balls to create structures which could, in turn, reach a pipe signifying the end of the level.  The only way to win was by getting a certain amount into the pipe, so while strength really was in numbers, so were tactics. The game was strategy as much as good craftsmanship, and the further you got (and the closer to the World of Go Corporation you got) the more environmental hazards you would face. \n"}, {"text": "What \"Pokemon\" games were the first to allow double battles, battles in which you used two Pokemon at the same time?", "correct": "Ruby and Sapphire", "options": ["Gold and Silver", "Black and White", "X and Y"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRuby and Sapphire.\n\n\tThe series' third generation commenced with the Game Boy Advance titles \"Pokemon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" and it was those games that saw the first double battles, battles in which your first-two slotted Pokemon would emerge at the same time to fight against trainers in the same manner.  This added a slightly new twist to the formula, forcing players to approach combat, especially type strengths and weaknesses, with more strategy than normal.  The mechanic was retained in later games in the series as well.  Both of these games were released in 2003; \"Pokemon Emerald\" came out two years later. \n"}, {"text": "In the music game \"Rock Band\", band members had a higher chance of saving you from failing out of a song by using what power-up?", "correct": "Overdrive", "options": ["Bass Groove", "Star Power", "Drumrolls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOverdrive.\n\n\tFeatured in the \"Guitar Hero\" series as Star Power, Overdrive is attained by hitting important, signified streaks throughout the songs; a bar fills up under your play meter and when it reaches at least 50% it can be deployed in different ways depending on your instrument of choice.  While this can be done at any time to earn points (or stack point multipliers depending on how many players are involved), it can also be used to revive a fallen band member who, after hitting too many wrong notes, can drop out of a song due to fan heckling. Deploying Overdrive is an immediate reprieve, but after three strikes a player can drop out and the setlist can be failed. That or you could always turn on 'No Fail Mode'. \n"}, {"text": "Whose \"Mass Attack\" on the Nintendo DS split the titular main character into ten versions of himself?", "correct": "Kirby", "options": ["Mario", "Link", "Star Fox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKirby.\n\n\t\"Kirby Mass Attack\" was released in 2011.  In this game you needed to use the stylus to control Kirby through several different worlds.  The catch?  Kirby has been split into ten Kirbies.  You defeat enemies by playing tactically-- do you toss one Kirby to hit an enemy or swarm with all ten?  The game was quite well-received.\rCoincidentally, when fighting Donkey Kong in \"Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis\", the player had to control countless mechanical, miniature Marios.  Link has also fought a shadowy doppelganger of himself in certain \"Legend of Zelda\" games. \n"}]}
