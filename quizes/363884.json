{"id": "363884", "name": "Alphabetical Horror Films - H Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Michael Myers was the boogeyman in what seminal 1978 horror classic directed by John Carpenter?", "correct": "Halloween", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalloween.\n\n\tStarring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence, \"Halloween\" is commonly regarded in horror circles as one of the most popular early slasher flicks of all time.  In this movie, a young psychopath by the name of Michael Myers returned to Haddonfield, Illinois after 15 years to murder several hapless teenagers in the suburbs.  The movie put Michael Myers on the horror villain map and several sequels (including a reboot by Rob Zombie) were filmed over the years.  Carpenter found subsequent fame in the horror genre with \"The Fog\" (1980), \"The Thing\" (1982), and \"Christine\" (1983). \n"}, {"text": "Paris Hilton's onscreen demise was the primary draw for what 2005 Dark Castle remake?", "correct": "House of Wax", "options": ["The Horsemen", "The Haunting", "The Hills Run Red"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHouse of Wax.\n\n\t\"House of Wax\" was originally made in 1953 and featured Vincent Price.  Although released to theaters at the first height of 3D films, the movie stood up well in home releases and became quite popular in its own right.  In 2005, Jaume Collet-Serra (also known for \"Orphan\") directed this remake starring a slew of popular early twenty-somethings and took the violence up a few levels to provide a more graphic turn. With a number of remakes from Dark Castle in earlier years, this one was considered one of the better quality productions by many critics and, unsurprisingly, it was a box office success with many heading to the movies just to see Paris Hilton get impaled on a metal pipe. In this version of the film, a group of kids heading to a football game got sidetracked in a town of wax people... and a couple of psychopaths.  It was a hot mess. \n"}, {"text": "Set in Germany, what infamous 2010 movie directed by Tom Six involved unwilling participants in a Nazi doctor's cruel, sadistic experiments?", "correct": "The Human Centipede (First Sequence)", "options": ["Hanger", "Hollow Man", "The Host"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Human Centipede (First Sequence).\n\n\tAlthough most critics dismissed \"The Human Centipede\" as nothing more than shock value, horror fans ate the negative press up; the movie turned out to be an instant cult hit amongst genre fans simply due to its premise.  Showing very little actual gore, the setpiece for the movie was none other than a human centipede -- three people surgically attached from end to end to form a chain with kidnapped Asian traveler Katsuro on the front and partying friends Lindsay and Jenny in the middle and back respectively. Suffice to say it was a bonding experience for them all.  Director Tom Six envisioned the movie as a franchise and, sure enough, sequels were made, each of them expanding on the idea in different ways... and expanding the chain. \n"}, {"text": "A shish-kebab, a bench press, and pair of pruning shears all became implements of murder in what lesser-known 1981 slasher movie involving the ten richest teens in a high school?", "correct": "Happy Birthday To Me", "options": ["Hell Night", "Hands of Fate", "Home Sweet Home"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHappy Birthday To Me.\n\n\tIn \"Happy Birthday To Me\", the viewer mainly followed Virginia, a young girl recently inducted into the elite, snobby group known as the 'Top Ten', and they soon started getting picked off one by one in outlandish ways.  About halfway through the movie, Virginia was revealed to be the one killing the others but, as many viewers discovered, the ending of the movie was utterly confusing. In an attempt to one-up a savvy audience the script was flipped by the studio to feature a different killer with little explanation; they also opted to push the envelope on gore, killing the students in unique ways -- later posters and covers for the film featured the infamous shish-kebab-into-the-throat death. Seriously. \n"}, {"text": "Heading to the bayou outside New Orleans in this 2006 horror film, you could find Victor Crowley (or he would pop up and find you).  What is the movie's name, also the killer's primary weapon?", "correct": "Hatchet", "options": ["Hysteria", "Hacksaw", "Hole Punch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHatchet.\n\n\t\"Hatchet\" was a hit with horror fans upon its 2006 festival release, winning several different awards on the circuit before a limited release.  However, horror fans, being as ravenous and dedicated as they are, propelled the film to modern fame and a number of sequels followed, all featuring the evil Victor Crowley, a supernatural, deformed figure from the bayou who just couldn't seem to die.  The movies, originally conceived and directed by Adam Green (who also made \"Frozen\"), were bloody and featured several horror figures including Kane Hodder, Robert Englund, and Tony Todd. \n"}, {"text": "Eli Roth started a trend of 'splatter' movies in 2005 with the release of what torture-porn title set in Eastern Europe?", "correct": "Hostel", "options": ["Hidden", "House of 1,000 Corpses", "A Horrible Way to Die"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHostel.\n\n\t\"Hostel\" shocked audiences upon its release, finally bringing back horror with a hard R rating in the United States and sparking a wave of what was later referred to as 'torture-porn'.  In this movie, three guys backpacking through Europe made their way to a hostel in Slovakia where they were subsequently drugged and made into purchases to be bid on by wealthy men looking for a kick... in the form of murder by their own rules. The film grossed $80,000,000 and put Roth's name back on the map (after a strong debut with \"Cabin Fever\").  A sequel, \"Hostel: Part Two\", was filmed by Roth two years later but was significantly less popular. \n"}, {"text": "A number of guests were sent to a sprawling, creepy residence only to find out it's plagued by ghosts and ghouls in what 1959 movie directed by William Castle?", "correct": "House on Haunted Hill", "options": ["Hallows Eve", "Hell House", "The House That Dripped Blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHouse on Haunted Hill.\n\n\tIn Castle's original movie, a very rich Vincent Price invited five people to a birthday party at a haunted house, promising $10,000 to anyone who would survive the night.  What followed was, of course, a haunted bout.  The movie was remade in 1999 as the first film under the Dark Castle Entertainment name and that was followed by a straight-to-DVD sequel.  While the original has been regarded as one of Castle's best, the remake was regarded as one of the worst in 1999. \n"}, {"text": "A teenage girl, Kirsty, opened Lemarchand's Box (also known as the Lament Configuration) and released the Cenobites upon her resurrected uncle in what 1987 movie written and directed by horror author Clive Barker?", "correct": "Hellraiser", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHellraiser.\n\n\t\"Hellraiser\" is the film franchise featuring Pinhead, the notorious sadist from Hell who arrives when the confusing puzzle known as Lemarchand's Box is opened by an unwary player.  In the first film of the series, the box was originally opened by Frank, a rebellious thrill-seeker, and when his brother and mistress (also his sister-in-law) moved into his old house they unknowingly brought him back to semi-life. It was ultimately up to Kirsty, Frank's son, to summon the Hell-raised Cenobites and leave Frank in pieces.  The movie was popular enough to warrant several sequels though horror fans have been aware of the franchise's troubled productions, particularly due to what many have considered a mishandling by the studios resulting in a number of shoddy releases to protect the \"Hellraiser\" name from being sold off. \n"}, {"text": "Wes Craven and Alexandre Aja both directed films involving mutants in Nevada.  What was the name of the movie franchise they were both known for?", "correct": "The Hills Have Eyes", "options": ["Hannibal", "House", "The Howling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hills Have Eyes.\n\n\tWes Craven's original \"The Hills Have Eyes\", out in 1977, was one of the director's first major horror releases (though \"The Last House on the Left\" was out earlier).  He would go on to film \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Scream\".  The movie, about a family coming across a group of nuclear-made mutants in the deserts of Nevada, received two sequels in later years before getting remade by \"Haute Tension\" director Alexandre Aja in 2006. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Ti West's slow-burn 2009 film starring Jocelin Donahue and featuring a satanic cult?", "correct": "The House of the Devil", "options": ["Haunting in Connecticut", "The Haunted Castle", "Hausu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe House of the Devil.\n\n\t\"The House of the Devil\" was one of the more popular early films of Ti West, a director who would gain more fame into the 2010s with his unique, restrained approach to horror capitalizing on the agonizing wait and terror of the unknown.  \"The House of the Devil\", set in the 1980s and filmed in the same style as the decade, put a strapped-for-cash girl in an odd, devilish predicament. When Samantha needed to earn rent money she responded to a babysitting ad to discover that they'd tricked her into looking after an unseen elderly woman during the night of a lunar eclipse.  As it turned out, they would eventually use her as part of their ritual. West later directed \"The Innkeepers\" (2011) and a sequence in the original \"V/H/S\" (2012) \n"}]}
