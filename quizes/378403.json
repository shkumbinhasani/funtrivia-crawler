{"id": "378403", "name": "Mixed \"South Park\" - Season 1 Quiz | 'South Park'  - Season    1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "South Park", "Episodes", "Season    "], "questions": [{"text": "\"South Park\" piloted with the episode \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\" in 1997.  Cartman was the first to be abducted, but who else was taken by the aliens?", "correct": "Ike", "options": ["Kenny", "Chef", "Randy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIke.\n\n\tThis episode, created and animated entirely by creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, featured many early appearances of South Park's most popular characters including Chef, Mr. Garrison, Wendy Testaburger, and Officer Barbrady.  Cartman, of course, had to deal with having received an anal probe while the other boys dealt with their own problems (Stan had girl problems, Kyle's brother was abducted, and Kenny was killed).  In the end, all problems were solved by activating the satellite dish hidden within Cartman; Ike was returned and the aliens departed...after taking Cartman with them via tractor beam and using Scott Baio to infect him with pinkeye. That's just how things go in South Park. \n"}, {"text": "Who attempted to murder Kathie Lee Gifford?", "correct": "Mr. Garrison", "options": ["Wendy", "Cartman", "Principal Victoria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Garrison\n\n\tAs seen in the show's second episode, \"Weight Gain 4000\", Mr. Garrison was convinced (by Mr. Hat) to murder Kathie Lee based on her upstaging of his ventriloquy act during a talent show; evidently he never got over it.  Kathie Lee, of course, was brought in to South Park when Cartman plagiarized an essay for a contest. While Wendy Testaburger revealed the plagiarism at the end of the episode, long after Cartman beefed up on weight gain supplements for the cameras, no one really cared.  Mr. Garrison didn't get to kill Kathie Lee; her people got her out of town after an errant shot from his sniper hit Kenny instead. \n"}, {"text": "According to South Park's instructional videos, how should one avoid getting killed by a volcano?", "correct": "Duck and cover", "options": ["Stop, drop, and roll", "Grow wings and fly", "Find help"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuck and cover.\n\n\tIn \"Volcano\", the boys head on a hunting trip with Stan's uncle Jimbo (and Ned) but, as it seems, the nearby volcano is ready to blow its top.  While the boys get trapped on the mountain, Stan worries that Jimbo doesn't like him and Cartman tries to convince the others of a local creature named Scuzzlebutt with a stick of celery for an arm and Patrick Duffy for a leg. When all seems lost for the expedition Scuzzlebutt weaves a wicker basket and saves them all...right before Stan shoots him in the head.  Throughout the episode, the town prepares for the eruption based on Randy Marsh's seismology reports and, after watching an instructional film about volcanoes from decades earlier, follows the instruction to 'duck and cover' to escape. It works as well as you'd expect for the rescue teams.  In the end, the citizens divert the lava floes away from the town with a large trench...leading it straight to Denver. \n"}, {"text": "What family member in the boys' lives tries to commit suicide in the episode \"Death\"?", "correct": "Stan's grandfather", "options": ["Kenny's brother", "Kyle's uncle", "Cartman's mother"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStan's grandfather.\n\n\tAs Stan's grandfather turns 102, Stan begins to discover how far his elder is willing to go to commit suicide...or have someone help him out.  Soon, Stan and his friends all need to figure out what they need to do to make things right...all while avoiding missing episodes of their favourite TV show, \"Terrance and Phillip\".  Unfortunately, while their parents (led by Kyle's mom) are all off fighting to get the show off the air for its vulgar jokes, the boys have to face the concept of euthanasia alone. In the end, Death arrives and chases they boys around town to take Kenny's soul, leaving Grandpa Marsh behind, but not before Great-Great-Grandpa Marsh imparts some words of wisdom. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Pinkeye\", the townspeople contracted the titular disease on Halloween.  What food was responsible for the outbreak?", "correct": "Worcestershire sauce", "options": ["Uncooked chicken", "Tootsie Rolls", "Gluten-free bread"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorcestershire sauce.\n\n\tAfter part of the MIR Space Station crashes on Kenny, he's sent to the morgue and left to embalm on Halloween.  Unfortunately, he's accidentally embalmed with Worcestershire sauce and reanimated as a zombie, solely bringing about an apocalypse in the town of South Park through infection...though many believe it to be pinkeye. The other boys (along with Chef) track the cause back to Kenny and head to the cemetery to stop it at the source; Kyle's eventually the one to slice his friend in half with a chainsaw.  Everyone who wasn't butchered by the boys over the course of the episode returns to their normal selves immediately after; all the corpses remain corpses. \n"}, {"text": "When Starvin' Marvin ended up getting sent to the United States, who was accidentally sent back to Africa in his place?", "correct": "Cartman", "options": ["Kyle", "Kenny", "Stan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCartman.\n\n\tThanksgiving is upon South Park in this episode, and in the spirit of...erm...getting a cool watch from an 'adopt-a-child' advertisement featuring Sally Struthers, the boys accidentally order a young Ethiopian boy who shows up at their front door.  After a short amount of time with the boy they name 'Marvin', the Christian Children's Fund comes looking and takes Cartman instead, sending him to Ethiopia where he uncovers Sally Struthers' hidden cache of food. Meanwhile, back in South Park, the city raises funds for a canned food drive for the poor while a flock of angry, genetically-engineered turkeys wreak havoc. A battle ensues with the evil turkeys, but the townspeople end up winning, subsequently sending their carcasses off to Ethiopia.  They also cook Sally Struthers too, it seems. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Hankey is a mascot for what well-known holiday?", "correct": "Christmas", "options": ["Independence Day", "Thanksgiving", "Easter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristmas.\n\n\tAppearing for the first time during the \"South Park Christmas Special\" in season one, Mr. Hankey emerges as 'The Christmas Poo', and it all begins with Kyle's mother getting up in arms over a Christian play (when Kyle and his family are Jewish).  Kyle also happens to believe in Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo, but it isn't until he's carted off to an asylum (mostly for summoning Mr. Hankey in odd circumstances) that everyone realizes the figure is real.  Mr. Hankey returns in later seasons of the show, in some cases with his family in the sewers. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Garrison decides to get a nose job, making him look like who of these?", "correct": "David Hasselhoff", "options": ["David Duchovny", "David Boreanaz", "David Cassidy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Hasselhoff.\n\n\tIn the episode \"Tom's Rhinoplasty\", Mr. Garrison decides that he has to have cosmetic surgery, so a substitute named Ms. Ellen moves into the classroom and all the boys instantly fall for her.  This, of course, makes Wendy Testaburger insanely jealous (jealous enough to send her on a rocket straight to the sun).  But on the other side of things, Mr. Garrison decides to get a nose job that makes him look like David Hasselhoff.  It ends up being a success and he initially quits his job as a teacher, but realizes it's too much for him to handle and reverts back to normal. \n"}, {"text": "Where do the boys find the 'Triangle of Zinthar'?", "correct": "An archaeological dig", "options": ["A ski slope", "In a pond", "In the trash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn archaeological dig.\n\n\tThe events described here occur in the penultimate episode of the season-- \"Mecha-Streisand\".  After a class trip to an archaeological dig, Cartman gets his hands on an ancient artifact...and throws it away.  As it turns out, the artifact is a magical creation designed to combine with another piece to form the Diamond of Panthios. What happens if Barbra Streisand gets her hands on it?  She becomes 'Mecha-Streisand', a mechanical beast that can trample cities.  Ultimately, Leonard Maltin, Robert Smith of The Cure, and Sidney Poitier need to step in and transform to stop her.  Ultimately, they solve the problem, breaking apart the diamond to stop true evil. \n"}, {"text": "Cartman tries to determine who his father is.  How do the boys get money to pay for the paternity test?", "correct": "By sending videos in to 'America's Stupidest Home Videos'", "options": ["By asking their parents", "By performing chores ovrer the summer", "By stealing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy sending videos in to 'America's Stupidest Home Videos'.\n\n\tAfter Cartman spends several days off school, the boys are convinced to film their friend while he has tea with his stuffed animals in the backyard.  The boys later discover that Cartman is just struggling with not having a father.  Since the tea parties are so funny, they send the videos off to 'America's Stupidest Home Videos' and vow to give their prize winnings over to Cartman for a paternity test. Unfortunately, pinning down a suitor is a bit difficult since Mrs. Cartman slept with numerous people (including the 1991 Denver Broncos) at a drunken barn dance, so the season ends with a cliffhanger as everyone tries to figure out the truth. \n"}]}
