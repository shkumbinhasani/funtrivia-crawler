In 1911, Cleveland's Joe Jackson's .408 fell short of Ty Cobb's .420 batting average.  In 1922, George Sisler batted .420, and won the batting title over the runner-up, who hit .401 in the season.  Who was this player that missed it by that much?", "correct": "Ty Cobb", "options": ["Stan Musial", "Rogers Hornsby", "Honus Wagner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTy Cobb.\n\n\tWhat goes around comes around.

It would be the third and final time that Ty would hit over .400 in his career.  He retired in 1928 with a .366 career average after 24 seasons. \n"}, {"text": "Babe Ruth never won a Triple Crown in his career, but came close twice.

It was Sutter's 37 saves in the season that put him over the top.  Joe's brother Phil, won 318 games in his career.  Although he never had a brother in baseball, Nolan Ryan's only chance for the Cy Young award was as a runner-up in 1973 as an Angel.  He lost to Baltimore's Jim Palmer. \n"}, {"text": "New York Giant pitcher Carl Hubbell had an amazing win streak of 24 consecutive games in the 1930s.
