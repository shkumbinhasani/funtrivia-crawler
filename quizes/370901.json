In what show does he lead a band of survivors?", "correct": "The Walking Dead", "options": ["Under the Dome", "Zombieland", "The Leftovers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Walking Dead.\n\n\tBased on the famous graphic novel series by Robert Kirkman, \"The Walking Dead\" was created on AMC by frequent Stephen King adaptor Frank Darabont (who was forced to leave the show before season two).  The show, following a group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic zombie dystopia, has since become one of the top-rated cable TV shows ever made and somewhat led a renewed interest in zombie media.  The show follows many key parts from the graphic novels, but with notable differences to ensure a fresh experience for all followers. \n"}, {"text": "One season took place in a 'Murder House'; another was in an 'Asylum'.  What anthology show taking place in a new setting each season was created by Ryan Murphy?", "correct": "American Horror Story", "options": ["Penny Dreadful", "The New Normal", "The X-Files"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican Horror Story.\n\n\tRyan Murphy created this FX show with the anthology in mind.  Each season would bring in a new theme, plot, and setting, but maintain a rotating cast of repertory actors, each taking on different roles to suit.  With casts including Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, Frances Conroy Emma Roberts, Zachary Quinto, Lily Rabe, and others, the show has since been to a Los Angeles haunted house, an east coast asylum in the 1960s, a New Orleans witch academy, and a Freak Show in 1950s Florida.  The show has won numerous Emmy and Golden Globe Awards. \n"}, {"text": "Will Graham can delve into the minds of psychopaths with perfect empathy, but when it turns out his psychiatrist is both deceiving and a cannibal, he has to make tough choices about himself and his ethics in what NBC show?", "correct": "Hannibal", "options": ["Haven", "Grimm", "666 Park Avenue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHannibal.\n\n\tA show with almost-too-ironic food styling, \"Hannibal\" is a dark, brooding adaptation of Thomas Harris' \"Red Dragon\" series starring Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen.  Following FBI consultant Will Graham and his battles with cannibal Hannibal Lecter, the show can be very graphic and disturbing at times, mainly because the crimes examined on the show are almost as mesmerizing as the food (which in all fairness, are usually made of people).  The show was critically lauded upon its debut despite consistent low ratings. \n"}, {"text": "Sunnydale is rife with vampires (amongst other things) and one girl, chosen as part of a lineage of vampire killers, has to set out with her friends to stop evil from taking over in what Joss Whedon show from the 1990s?", "correct": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "options": ["Angel", "Hemlock Grove", "True Blood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\n\tNot actually based on the earlier film version, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" starred Sarah Michelle Gellar as 'The Slayer'. Buffy's powers awakened prior to the show so that she could face off against big bad enemies, most of which were vampires but which also extended to other cursed creatures over time, mainly because the town of Sunnydale was a hotbed for this kind of stuff.  Made with the cheeky humour that Joss Whedon fans eat for breakfast, the show was a critical darling and a consistent ratings winner.  Its spin-off, \"Angel\", was also quite successful. \n"}, {"text": "Set in an arctic disease lab for its first season, what SyFy show pitted CDC doctors against super-fast zombies with a tendency to throw up into each others' mouths?", "correct": "Helix", "options": ["The Strain", "The Hunger", "Kingdom Hospital"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHelix.\n\n\tOften outlandish at the best of times, \"Helix\" ended up doing quite well for SyFy early on, mainly by blending campy elements with balls-to-the-wall zombie craziness.  Set in an infected, state-of-the-art, independent arctic laboratory, the show followed a group of CDC officials bringing an outbreak situation back to normalcy. Didn't quite happen that way.  Over the course of the show we saw odd familial relationships spring out of nowhere, zombies throwing up everywhere, almost-sinister alien(?) plots, and more than a couple hallucinatory sequences.  I'm still not sure what exactly happened. \n"}, {"text": "Every episode of this Showtime anthology series was directed by a different major director ranging from Tobe Hooper to John Carpenter to Takashi Miike.  What was the show's name?", "correct": "Masters of Horror", "options": ["The Outer Limits", "Fear Itself", "The Twilight Zone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMasters of Horror.\n\n\t\"Masters of Horror\", while only lasting two seasons, was quite notable for television at a time when horror television wasn't prominent in the slightest.  Taking a new horror director for every episode, the hour of the show would follow a new plot each time; one episode would be about a monster while another would be about a plague or a vampire or a curse or whichever. Created by Mick Garris, the show was canceled after twenty-six episodes but found new life on NBC as \"Fear Itself\", an anthology show with the same premise.  The latter was canceled before finishing its first season, mainly due to a lack of interest in horror on network TV about five years before its emergence. \n"}, {"text": "Set in Victorian London, what 2014 Showtime original featured appearances by Frankenstein, Dorian Gray, and Abraham Van Helsing (amongst others)?", "correct": "Penny Dreadful", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPenny Dreadful.\n\n\tNamed after a particularly popular pulp-horror novel from the era it sets out to emulate, \"Penny Dreadful\" starred Josh Hartnett, Eva Green, Timothy Dalton, Billie Piper, and others navigating their way through an evil-plagued Victorian London.  Over the course of the show, as famous fictional horrors wove their way through the plot, the protagonists had to set out to solve some unique, exotic mysteries, sometimes involving transforming beings or Egyptian runes or the like. The show was created by John Logan who, several times, has been nominated for Oscars for his screenplays.  It was also produced by \"Skyfall\" director Sam Mendes. \n"}, {"text": "Starring Freddie Highmore and Vera Farmiga, what Carlton Cuse-written cable drama is a prequel to Robert Bloch's \"Psycho\"?", "correct": "Bates Motel", "options": ["The Dead Zone", "Salem", "The Night Gallery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBates Motel.\n\n\tPreceeding the events of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" film, \"Bates Motel\" follows a young Norman Bates and his mother as the deranged boy becomes a deranged man.

Carlton Cuse, the main writer for the show, is also known for co-writing \"Lost\". \n"}, {"text": "Based on characters from Washington Irving's popular American 'legend', what TV show features a headless horseman and a man from the American Revolution battling in present times?", "correct": "Sleepy Hollow", "options": ["The River", "The Vampire Diaries", "Being Human"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSleepy Hollow.\n\n\tPremiering on FOX in 2013, \"Sleepy Hollow\" starred Tom Mison and Nicole Beharie-- the former as Ichabod Crane, preserved in time and brought back by a curse in the present day to fight the Headless Horseman and the latter a modern day detective.  The show, dense in its own mythology, was written by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, both responsible for J.J. Abrams' \"Fringe\" amongst other things.  \"Sleepy Hollow\" was one of the most popular debut shows of its first season, perhaps indicating a shifting tide and eagerness to see horror on network TV. \n"}, {"text": "Sam and Dean Winchester head across the United States fighting all things evil in what WB/CW show featuring angels and demons?", "correct": "Supernatural", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSupernatural.\n\n\tRunning for more than ten years with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki in the roles of Dean and Sam Winchester, \"Supernatural\" has been a fan favourite for the network following the brothers as they set out to stop evil from reigning across the country.  While early seasons followed classic horrors from urban myth, seasons progressed towards other issues, notably demons, evil angels, and gods.  Along the way, the show has also introduced popular secondary characters, igniting careers for others like Misha Collins and Jim Beaver. \n"}]}
