{"id": "54978", "name": "'Inside the Actors Studio' Guests (through 2001) Trivia Game | Television | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television H-K", "Inside The Actor's Studio"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the following guests smoked during his or her interview?", "correct": "Sean Penn", "options": ["Sharon Stone", "Martin Landau", "Ned Beatty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSean Penn.\n\n\tPenn actually received applause from the audience for lighting up.  (Since Penn's appearance, Melanie Griffith and Johnny Depp have also smoked, incidentally.) \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following married couples appeared as 'co-guests,' being interviewed on stage simultaneously?", "correct": "Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson", "options": ["Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger", "Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy", "Neil Simon and Marsha Mason"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEli Wallach and Anne Jackson.\n\n\tBaldwin and Basinger have each been guests, but not in the same episode. Neil Simon has been a guest, but not alongside his wife. Neither Tandy nor Cronyn were guests of the show before their deaths.\r I'm fairly certain that the Wallach-Jackson interview was the only time that exactly two guests appeared on stage at the same time. \n"}, {"text": "James Lipton uses the questionnaire invented by French talk show host Bernard Pivot to end every interview...with one exception. Which of the following guests of 'Inside the Actors Studio' was NOT shown answering the questionnaire?", "correct": "Spike Lee", "options": ["Julia Roberts", "Laurence Fishburne", "Meg Ryan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpike Lee.\n\n\tTo this day, I have no idea if Lee was never asked the questions at all, or if the questionnaire segment wound up on the editing room floor for some reason. Either way, I found the absence of the segment quite annoying. \n"}, {"text": "Bit of a tricky one here: only one person has been the featured guest of 'Inside the Actors Studio' twice. Who was it?", "correct": "Alec Baldwin", "options": ["Steven Spielberg", "Robert DeNiro", "Holly Hunter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlec Baldwin.\n\n\tBaldwin was the guest for the 'prototype' episode of 'ITAS' -- it took place in an actual classroom as opposed to the now-familiar auditorium, and has only been shown a handful of times on Bravo. Baldwin later became a guest for the second time in the 'official' format.  \r Holly Hunter popped up as an audience member at the end of Steven Spielberg's episode, but she has only been the featured guest once. \n"}, {"text": "Which guest asked to borrow James Lipton's glasses, and actually put them on?", "correct": "Val Kilmer", "options": ["Mike Myers", "Will Ferrell", "Mike Nichols"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVal Kilmer.\n\n\tKilmer was asked by Lipton to read aloud the poem that Kilmer had used as his audition piece for Julliard. Kilmer responded with, 'Can I read it as you?' Lipton agreed to hand over his glasses so that Kilmer could look the part a bit more. (He wound up balking at reading the poem as Lipton, which is kind of a shame. Could have been quite funny.) \r Ferrell does a dead-on Lipton impression, but has never been (as of October 2001) an official guest, despite making a brief appearance on the 100th episode retrospective. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes guests bring friends or family members to the taping, and Lipton rarely fails to point them out in the audience. Which of the following people has NOT been seen in the audience of 'ITAS'?", "correct": "Sarah Jessica Parker", "options": ["Matt Damon", "Leonard Nimoy", "Burt Young"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSarah Jessica Parker.\n\n\tNimoy was there as a guest of close friend Gene Wilder. Young tagged along for James Caan's interview. Damon sneaked into Ben Affleck's interview incognito, but Lipton identified him near the end of the show, much to Affleck's surprise. \r Sarah Jessica Parker is Matthew Broderick's wife, but she was not present during his interview. \n"}, {"text": "One of the questions asked in the aforementioned questionnaire is, 'What profession other than yours would you like to attempt?' Which guest answered, with no hesitation whatsoever, 'Shortstop, New York Yankees, number 5'?", "correct": "Billy Crystal", "options": ["Francis Ford Coppola", "Sylvester Stallone", "James Caan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly Crystal.\n\n\tCrystal is a well-known baseball fanatic, particularly when it comes to the Yankees. \n"}, {"text": "'Inside the Actors Studio' once featured a guest who was not only NOT a member of the Actors Studio, but someone who had virtually zero experience acting, screenwriting, playwriting, or directing. Who was it?", "correct": "Billy Joel & Joel", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly Joel & Joel.\n\n\tA true anomaly among 'ITAS' guests, Joel spent his two-hour interview discussing nothing but his music, occasionally stepping over to the piano to illustrate a point or simply to take a request. For fans of Joel (like myself), it was an enjoyable episode...but one has to wonder how a man who does not act, direct, or write (music aside) wound up on this show! \n"}, {"text": "'Inside the Actors Studio' is usually a one-hour show. A handful of guests, however, have merited two-hour episodes. Which of the following was NOT one of those guests?", "correct": "Francis Ford Coppola", "options": ["Robin Williams", "Mike Myers", "Steven Spielberg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola.\n\n\tDespite Coppola's expansive and remarkable body of work, the episode featuring him was only an hour long, which wasn't nearly enough for me. Spielberg, of course, had plenty to talk about, and Williams' improvising filled up the two hours easily...but I felt that giving someone as comparatively unaccomplished as Mike Myers the two-hour treatment was a bit odd. \n"}, {"text": "As of October 2001, which of the following people has appeared on 'Inside the Actors Studio' as both a guest AND a member of the audience?", "correct": "Holly Hunter", "options": ["Tim Robbins", "Matt Damon", "Gwyneth Paltrow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHolly Hunter.\n\n\tAt the end of the Steven Spielberg interview, it was revealed that Holly Hunter had been lurking in the back of the theater. Lipton called her up front, where she had a rather touching moment with her friend Steven. Damon was in the audience for Ben Affleck, but was not ever a guest as of October 2001. Robbins and Paltrow have been guests, but have never been in the audience. \n"}, {"text": "James Lipton occasionally arranges interesting surprises for his guests. In one episode, the guest was awarded with an honorary high school diploma by his or her former principal. Who was it?", "correct": "Whoopi Goldberg", "options": ["Spike Lee", "Roseanne", "Michael Caine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhoopi Goldberg.\n\n\tGoldberg was clearly floored, and held the framed diploma proudly above her head. \n"}, {"text": "Who has been the youngest guest featured on 'Inside the Actors Studio'?", "correct": "Gwyneth Paltrow", "options": ["Matt Damon", "Ben Affleck", "Giovanni Ribisi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGwyneth Paltrow.\n\n\tWhile Ribisi is the youngest person named above, as of October 2001, he has not been a guest on the show, nor has Damon. Both Affleck and Paltrow have made appearances, and Gwyneth is about six weeks younger than Ben. \n"}, {"text": "The final question in the Pivot questionnaire is, 'If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?' Which of the following guests responded by mimicking a baseball umpire shouting, 'Safe!', complete with the sweeping arms gesture?", "correct": "Kathy Bates", "options": ["Sharon Stone", "Billy Crystal", "Tommy Lee Jones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKathy Bates.\n\n\tAn extremely funny moment capping off what was a fairly serious interview. \n"}, {"text": "On occasion, guests have been moved to tears during their interviews. Which of the following guests did NOT cry?", "correct": "Ellen Barkin", "options": ["Spike Lee", "Tom Hanks", "Sharon Stone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEllen Barkin.\n\n\tHanks cried while explaining how difficult it is for him to watch 'Philadelphia,' since most of the 60 or so gay men who appeared as extras died within a year of that film's release. Lee cried as he detailed how generous a number of black celebrities were when the budget for 'Malcolm X' was coming up short, and he needed additional funds to finish the film.  Stone cried while describing the loss of one of her best friends to AIDS.  \r Barkin, on the other hand, was quite aloof and often amused throughout her interview -- no tears at all. \n"}, {"text": "In a surprising moment of candor, Tom Hanks admitted during his interview that he 'steals' from a certain actor every day, in every performance he gives. Who is it?", "correct": "Denzel Washington", "options": ["Robert DeNiro", "Jimmy Stewart", "Gary Sinise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDenzel Washington.\n\n\tA mild exaggeration, perhaps, but Hanks apparently learned a great deal about acting while working with Washington in 'Philadelphia.' Hanks added, with a smile: 'And this is the only time I'm ever gonna give him credit for it.' \n"}, {"text": "Some of the actors featured on the show have 'signature' lines or sequences, and Lipton frequently asks them to treat the audience to readings of those lines. Which of the following guests absolutely refused to comply with Lipton's request?", "correct": "Robert DeNiro", "options": ["Tom Hanks", "Carol Burnett", "Al Pacino"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert DeNiro.\n\n\tPacino has not yet been a guest (as of October 2001). Burnett was only too happy to perform her 'Tarzan yell.' Hanks slipped into 'Forrest Gump' mode to say, 'Momma always said that life is like a box of chocolates,' but was quick to add -- ironically enough, given the answer to this question -- \"You just got DeNiro to say, 'You talkin' to me?', because I NEVER do that for anyone.\"\r DeNiro did in fact refuse to speak that famous line from 'Taxi Driver' when he was a guest, stating, 'I never do it.'  Awww...poor Lipton. \n"}, {"text": "Lipton is famous for doing remarkably extensive research into the lives of his guests before they appear on his show. Which guest admitted to actually having read a biography about himself or herself in order to 'brush up' on his or her own life story before being interviewed?", "correct": "Harrison Ford", "options": ["Jerry Lewis", "Lauren Bacall", "Steven Spielberg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarrison Ford.\n\n\tFord came off as an extremely humble, down-to-earth, self-deprecating guy throughout his interview. \n"}, {"text": "Which actor(s) from the 'Lethal Weapon' movie series has or have appeared on 'Inside the Actors Studio' as of October 2001?", "correct": "Danny Glover", "options": ["all of them", "Joe Pesci", "Mel Gibson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDanny Glover.\n\n\tI believe that Gibson eventually appeared on the show...but again, this quiz only covers shows up to October 2001. \n"}, {"text": "On a few occasions, the students in the audience have sung to the guest. Which guest was NOT 'serenaded'?", "correct": "Mary Tyler Moore", "options": ["They all were 'serenaded'", "Jack Lemmon", "Carol Burnett"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMary Tyler Moore.\n\n\tSince Lemmon's appearance on the show took place on his birthday, Lipton arranged for a cake to be brought in at the end of the show, and the students sang a chorus of 'Happy Birthday.' Burnett was treated to a rendition of the theme song to her television show. The theme song to 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' is perhaps equally well-known, but the students didn't sing it to Moore when she was a guest. \n"}, {"text": "The last segment of the show is a question-and-answer session between the guest and the students in the audience. Which guest was rather presumptuously asked by a student to read a scene with him, right there and then?", "correct": "Kevin Spacey", "options": ["Val Kilmer", "Donald Sutherland", "Gabriel Byrne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin Spacey.\n\n\tSpacey was asked by a very nervous (but brash!) student to join him in performing a page and a half from 'Glengarry Glen Ross.' And Spacey did it! \n"}, {"text": "During one guest's Q-and-A session, a student revealed that she was a distant relative of the guest. Who was the guest?", "correct": "Steven Spielberg", "options": ["Sigourney Weaver", "Robin Williams", "Meg Ryan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteven Spielberg.\n\n\tThe student in question shared a great-great grandparent with Spielberg's second wife, Kate Capshaw. (That's pretty distant, all right!) \n"}, {"text": "Which guest openly and unashamedly flirted with a student during a Q-and-A session?", "correct": "Lauren Bacall", "options": ["Ben Stiller", "Andy Garcia", "Helen Hunt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLauren Bacall.\n\n\tWhen a young male student identified himself and started to ask his question, Bacall smiled broadly and said, 'Oh, my GOD, but you're cute.' The student smiled and blushed, then asked his question. Bacall responded only with, 'And your accent is just GORGEOUS!' The flattered, flustered student eventually sat down with his question unanswered, if I recall correctly...but he wound up with an anecdote he'll be telling his grandkids about! \n"}, {"text": "One guest mused that he has twice received 'Italian-American of the Year' awards despite his being completely devoid of Italian heritage. Who was it?", "correct": "James Caan", "options": ["Harvey Keitel", "Ray Liotta", "Christopher Walken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Caan.\n\n\tCaan's role in 'The Godfather' obviously made quite an impact on certain people -- to such an extent that they often forget that he is Jewish, not Italian.  Keitel and Walken are Jewish, as well.  (Liotta, as of December 2002, has never been a guest on the show.) \n"}, {"text": "Exactly one guest has brought a pianist on stage with him or her. Who was it?", "correct": "Bernadette Peters", "options": ["Martin Short", "Nathan Lane", "Carol Burnett"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBernadette Peters.\n\n\tWhile all of the guests listed are known for their Broadway musical work, Peters is the only one who had an accompanist on stage with her for the express purpose of helping her perform a few songs. \n"}, {"text": "Given that the purpose of 'Inside the Actors Studio' is to get a glimpse inside the minds of some of the most influential figures in American film and stage, there are quite a few notable people 'missing' from the list of 150 guests who have appeared as of June 2004. Which of the following industry giants HAS appeared on 'ITAS'?", "correct": "None of them have", "options": ["Jack Nicholson", "Al Pacino", "Marlon Brando"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of them have.\n\n\tAmazingly, not one of these icons has yet taken his place in the hot seat -- and Marlon Brando never will, since he died on July 1, 2004.  Get on those other two, Lipton! \n"}]}
