{"id": "319442", "name": "\"Dollhouse\": \"Instinct\" Quiz / Test | Dollhouse | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Dollhouse"], "questions": [{"text": "\"I'm not going to lie to you,\" Topher tells Ballard at the beginning of the episode. \"I kind of blew my own mind this time.\" He's talking about an ability he's just managed to include in Echo's new personality imprint. What is it?", "correct": "The ability to breastfeed an infant", "options": ["The ability to do kung-fu fighting", "The ability to solve an unsolvable equation", "A \"spider-sense\" for detecting enemies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe ability to breastfeed an infant.\n\n\tTopher is delighted by his achievement in altering Echo's body \"on a glandular level,\" and paints a dramatic picture of what else he might be able to accomplish with this kind of tool. \"I don't want to use the word 'genius,'\" he insists, \"but I'd be okay if you wanted to.\" Ballard shows no signs of wanting to. \n"}, {"text": "In the personality of a woman called Emily, Echo heads to the park, to feed the ducks and chat, heart-to-heart, with a close friend. We recognize this friend as another Doll; which one?", "correct": "Sierra", "options": ["November", "Victor", "Whiskey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSierra.\n\n\tOn long-term jobs, the Dollhouse seems to have a habit of bringing in other Dolls to serve as a support network. It's a clever trick: if the Doll-on-assignment never makes any \"real\" friends, then who'll notice anything amiss when the engagement ends and the Doll disappears? Here, Echo/Emily and Sierra/Kelly are suburban housewives, trading complaints about their husbands on a sunny day -- but Echo/Emily has more than the usual problems on her mind. \n"}, {"text": "Echo/Emily is having a rough time: she's persuaded that her \"husband,\" Nate, is having an affair. Snooping in his office, she finds proof: photographs of him with another woman, in the place where she remembers having their honeymoon. What turns out to be the real explanation for these pictures?", "correct": "They're pictures of his late wife.", "options": ["They're pictures of the last Doll he engaged.", "They're publicity stills for a play.", "They're from photo shoots for a fashion spread."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey're pictures of his late wife.\n\n\t\"I knew her before I knew you,\" Nate (Kristoffer Polaha) tells her when she confronts him, \"and I was in love with her. But she died.\" This is true, but not complete. The whole story, which is revealed later in the episode, is that the woman was his wife, who died giving birth to their child. The pain was too great; he couldn't trust himself to care for the baby properly. So he engaged a Doll to be its mother, really believing she was its mother, while he coped with his loss. He never suspected that the Doll would realize that something was wrong with their \"marriage.\" \n"}, {"text": "Soon enough, Echo/Emily has even worse problems: she believes her husband is planning to have her and the baby murdered. What is her basis for this belief?", "correct": "A late-night phone call and a black van", "options": ["An ad in the paper", "A large withdrawal from her bank account", "An anonymous warning on her door"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA late-night phone call and a black van.\n\n\tShe's noticed the windowless black van before, always parked near the house. (Unbeknownst to her, her handler Ballard is inside, keeping tabs on her well-being.) But the van takes on a more sinister significance when she overhears Nate on the phone in the middle of the night. He's furious about her accusations, and has called the Dollhouse to complain: \"You people promised me something that you cannot deliver. This is not working. I'm calling it off. Get rid of her!\" A pause, and then -- \"I'll get rid of the baby.\"\r We know he isn't planning bodily harm. The baby will be placed for adoption, and she'll return to the Dollhouse to have her personality wiped -- which, of course, will be the end of Emily. She doesn't know any of this, though, and fears for her life. \n"}, {"text": "Meanwhile, in Northern Virginia, Senator Perrin is at home with his wife, worrying that he'll never pin anything on the Rossum Corporation. The doorbell rings; someone's left a stack of papers. What's inside?", "correct": "Wiretap transcripts -- and a name", "options": ["A severed finger", "A threatening note", "A bribe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWiretap transcripts -- and a name.\n\n\tSomeone is feeding Senator Perrin information. After his press conference in the previous episode (\"Vows\"), his NSA source has gone to ground and he's been left with some rather unreliable witnesses -- but now, everything he needs is laid out before him. He now has some evidence of all the Dollhouse's sleazy activities, from human trafficking on up -- and he has a name. But whose? We'll have to stay tuned to find out ... \n"}, {"text": "Back in L.A., in a glorious high-rise apartment, Adelle de Witt pays a visit to Madeline Costley, who was once the Doll called November and who is now one of \"the idle rich.\" Why does Adelle say she's there?", "correct": "To remind her to come in for a diagnostic test", "options": ["To deliver some outstanding funds", "To persuade her to become a Doll again", "To re-introduce her to \"an eligible gentleman\": Ballard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo remind her to come in for a diagnostic test.\n\n\tMadeline is nervous about Adelle's visit, especially since she knows she's been released from her Dollhouse contract years ahead of schedule. \"I have this irrational fear,\" she confides, \"that if I say one wrong thing, men in suits are going to throw me in a black van and take me away.\" Adelle assures her that no such thing will happen; all they want is to make sure she's still neurologically healthy. \n"}, {"text": "Echo/Emily is desperate to get away from her \"husband,\" and the Dollhouse is ready to take her back. When Ballard and his support team show up to end the engagement, what does she do?", "correct": "She runs away with the baby.", "options": ["She voluntarily goes with them.", "She tries to bribe Ballard.", "She faints."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe runs away with the baby.\n\n\tEcho/Emily is programmed to trust her handler, Ballard, on sight -- but she never gets a close look at him. Upstairs with the baby after Nate has prevented her from leaving the house, she calls her friend, Sierra/Kelly, to come get her -- and is horrified when she sees the Dollhouse types usher her into their black van. By the time Ballard comes up the stairs, knocks on the door and offers her a treatment (a code word that's supposed to make her complacent), she and the baby are gone -- out the window and down a fire ladder. \n"}, {"text": "Madeline, the former Doll known as November, has just finished up an errand at the Dollhouse when she sees Echo/Emily coming in for her personality wipe. What disturbs her about the scene?", "correct": "Echo/Emily is fighting hard, screaming that they've taken away her baby.", "options": ["Echo/Emily seems to know her.", "Echo/Emily appears completely blank.", "Echo/Emily is singing a nonsense song, and Ballard hits her to make her be quiet."], "explanation": "\n\n\nEcho/Emily is fighting hard, screaming that they've taken away her baby.\n\n\tAs she'd promised Adelle, Madeline has come in for a neurological work-up; Topher gives her \"a clean bill of health\" and tells her she should be in the recruitment DVD. Just then, Ballard drags in a distraught Echo/Emily, kicking and clawing and screaming that she wants her baby back. Neither the Doll-handler trust relationship nor the \"treatment\" code word can calm her.\r The scene is particularly disturbing to Madeline because of her own history. As she tells Ballard, she signed up with the Dollhouse to cope with her grief over the death of her toddler daughter from cancer. \"I go to sleep for five years, I wake up without pain.\" But the image of a distraught and grieving mother gives her pause. \n"}, {"text": "Topher wipes Emily's personality, but -- like so many things involving Echo -- it doesn't go according to plan. When he comes to check on her, she hits him and runs away from the Dollhouse. Where does she go?", "correct": "To find the baby", "options": ["To find Madeline", "To beg Senator Perrin for safety", "To kill Ballard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo find the baby.\n\n\tEcho has lost most of Emily's personality -- she's forgotten the baby's name, for example, and the details of starting a car -- but her body remembers the fact of the child, and she aches to have him back. \"Perhaps triggering lactation was a bridge too far,\" Topher admits when he comes to. \"Live and learn.\"\r A few minutes of classic horror fare follow -- she stalks Nate, cuts his phone lines, threatens him with a butcher knife. It's even a dark and stormy night. But, in the end, she gives the baby back to his father -- who has, finally, discovered his love for the child. \n"}, {"text": "Ballard catches up with Echo on a playground, afterward. She's in real emotional pain, and Ballard offers to release her from her vow and make sure all her personalities are wiped fully from her mind. Does she accept his offer?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe experience of being made to love a baby -- and then being made to give him up -- has been unusually hard on Echo. \"They make it so real,\" she tells Ballard, her voice breaking. \"Every time, they make it so real. Why do they do that?\"\r Ballard worries that Echo's suffering is too much for her, and wants to rescue her and bring down the Dollhouse on his own -- but Echo insists that she's still his partner. \"I'm awake now,\" she says. \"I don't want to go back to sleep.\" \n"}]}
