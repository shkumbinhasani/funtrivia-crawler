The mission whisks him away to the Indian Ocean where the target is a mobile satellite launch platform taken by pirates. After a briefing, Captain America is let loose, infiltrating the ship with extreme stealth and securing the perimeter near-solo.  Romanoff secures the engine room while Steve takes on the leader of the mercenaries, but he ends up finding her in the control room instead, backing up the hard drives in a parallel mission for S.H.I.E.L.D.  When this nearly jeopardizes the whole thing, Cap has a few choice words for Fury. \n"}, {"text": "What is the Triskelion?", "correct": "S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters", "options": ["A S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier", "An Infinity Stone", "A weapons facility"], "explanation": "\n\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters\n\n\tRogers confronts Nick Fury in his office in Fury, conceding to Cap's interest in full disclosure, brings him down to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s basement facility to show off Project Insight - three missile-outfitted helicarriers synced to satellites around the globe.  They continue around in the atmosphere neutralizing threats before they even happen.  Rogers says that they're only keeping people safe by pointing a gun at their heads.  Unfortunately, he's not thrilled with the program.\rRogers heads to the Smithsonian, visiting the Captain America exhibit there in his spare time and recalling the events of the war, watching Peggy Carter speak in video footage and mourning Bucky Barnes.  He ends up visiting Peggy at home and, in her nineties, she tries to apologize for the life he couldn't live.  He admits that her founding of S.H.I.E.L.D. is one of the only reasons he stayed.\rIn his office, Fury is surprised to find that all of the files he has on Project Insight are sealed away and unable to be accessed... on his authority.  So he goes upstairs to speak to Alexander Pierce, the Secretary of Internal Security for S.H.I.E.L.D., specifically asking that Project Insight be temporarily delayed while he can get a grasp on the weird things going on.  Pierce agrees as long as Iron Man stops off at his niece's birthday. \n"}, {"text": "Nick Fury, appearing in Steve Rogers' apartment, manages to hand off which of these?", "correct": "Flash drive", "options": ["Key", "Cell phone", "Dossier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlash drive.\n\n\tFury calls Maria Hill, asking her to head to Washington for a secret mission, but shortly after, he's hit in his car not once, but four times by men posing as D.C. police.  It's clear that not only are none of them cops, but they're prepared.  He narrowly manages to escape, gunning down the fake cops with his outfitted vehicle before taking them on a chase through busy rush hour streets.  His vehicle is disabled by a mysterious man in black but he manages to escape through a hole in the ground.\rSteve ends up heading back to his apartment to find Fury camped out inside, clearly injured.  Typing out messages to Cap with his phone, Fury reveals that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been compromised before he's shot by someone outside Cap's window and grievously injured.  He manages to hand off a flash drive and insist that no one be trusted before a neighbour, both a nurse and a S.H.I.E.L.D. field agent assigned to Rogers' protective duty (by the moniker Agent 13) comes in.\rRogers instead takes off in pursuit of the killer, rushing through buildings until emerging on a rooftop.  He tosses his shield, but the perpetrator catches it and tosses it back before disappearing into the night.\rSteve and Natasha both end up at the hospital alongside Maria Hill to witness Fury's surgery and all of them are present to see as he loses all vital signs on the table. \n"}, {"text": "Senator Pierce decides to mark Captain America as which of these?", "correct": "A fugitive", "options": ["A prisoner of war", "A compromised asset", "A flight risk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA fugitive.\n\n\tRogers is requested back at S.H.I.E.L.D. to speak to Secretary Pierce.  Pierce asks why Fury was in his apartment the previous night, but Rogers doesn't know.  That said, Pierce does know that the mercenaries from the Indian Ocean mission were hired by someone who transferred money through accounts leading to a location near Fury's mother's old address.  It leads to the assumption that, perhaps, Fury orchestrated the whole thing to locate and then sell off classified information.  Pierce asks him to give up Fury's information one last time, but Rogers doesn't budge.\rImmediately after Rogers leaves Pierce's office, he's marked as a fugitive and attacked in the building's elevator.  He narrowly escapes the Triskelion on his motorbike while Washington D.C. is put on lockdown and high surveillance.\rPierce informs his finest people that Captain America has sensitive information and he must be stopped.  When he speaks to the Council once more, they reactivate Project Insight against his and Fury's wishes. \n"}, {"text": "Where do Rogers and Romanoff review the information given over by Nick Fury?", "correct": "Apple Store", "options": ["Library", "Steve's apartment", "S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApple Store.\n\n\tRogers heads back to Fury's hospital and meets with Romanoff who informs him that she understands why Fury would call in the mercenaries.  She also knows, interestingly, that Fury was killed by a man that the mercenary community calls 'The Winter Soldier', who's been responsible for nearly two dozen high-profile assassinations.  Interestingly, she was once attacked by said 'Winter Soldier' when protecting an engineer in Iran; the soldier shot the engineer through her.\rThe two of them head to an Apple Store and plug the USB stick into one of the MacBooks, quickly shuffling through the protected information inside and fully anticipating that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s task force intercepting in nine minutes.  They get a destination - Wheaton, New Jersey, and head out, just barely escaping by blending into the crowd. \n"}, {"text": "It turns out that there is a secret Hydra base in which of these locations?", "correct": "Steve's old training base", "options": ["Coney Island Boardwalk", "The Mall of America", "The White House"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve's old training base.\n\n\tRogers and Romanoff steal a vehicle and make their way to New Jersey to find the origin of their files - Camp Lehigh, where Steve was trained for the army.  There, they find a bunker where there shouldn't be one, and when they go inside they find a S.H.I.E.L.D. office, perhaps indicating where the organization got its start.  Inside, they find a hidden room behind the bookcases indicating a secret elevator in the secret office.  Descending into this, they find another office containing what appears to be an elaborate supercomputer from decades past.  When they put the USB stick inside the only modern feature of the machine, it comes to life and identifies itself as Arnim Zola, the Swiss scientist that worked under Red Skull in World War II.  When he died of a horrible disease shortly after being recruited to help S.H.I.E.L.D., his mind was stored as an AI and he was able to sow seeds from within, helping infiltrate and kill high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives (like Howard Stark).  He developed the algorithm on the flash drive, and with it, Hydra will be able to take away the world's freedom once and for all.\rThe explanation to the two also serves as a stall tactic.  While he explains the plan, a missile, fired from S.H.I.E.L.D., makes its way to New Jersey and collides with the bunker.  A team comes in to search for Rogers and Romanoff's bodies, but they narrowly escape.\rElsewhere, in his home, Pierce is met by the Winter Soldier.  He asks that Rogers and Romanoff be his next targets, on account of his being forced to lose Zola as an asset. \n"}, {"text": "What was the codename of Sam Wilson's flight suit?", "correct": "Falcon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalcon.\n\n\tSteve and Natasha end up at Sam Wilson's house looking for a place to hide away and he offers them a place of refuge.  Discussing their next plan of action, they deduce that there's likely a mole in S.H.I.E.L.D. (aside from Pierce) working for Hydra and they believe it to be Jasper Sitwell, who they saved from the Indian Ocean mission.  The only other matter is infiltration, but Sam has that figured out; he worked on a project known as Falcon, and if they can get into Fort Meade, they can reacquire it.\rSteve and Natasha grab Sitwell from a meeting and interrogate him on top of a building before the latter kicks him off of it.  It's just a tactic though; Sam swoops in with his Falcon outfit to pick the mole back up to explain everything.  The truth is that Hydra is running off of Zola's algorithm now, predicting the future through all manner of information to eliminate any future threats-- including The Avengers.  Project Insight's helicarriers will do the rest of the work, killing everyone else around the globe that may cause issue.\rThe three take Sitwell captive, but it doesn't much matter; the Winter Soldier attacks them on the highway, tossing Sitwell into traffic and opening fire on their vehicle. \n"}, {"text": "How many helicarriers must have their chips replaced to stop Project Insight?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Two", "None", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThe Winter Soldier not only disables the group's car, but crashes into it, flipping it on the freeway and forcing Cap to protect the others.  It all results in a gunfight on the overpass as the Winter Soldier and his men take control, but after Romanoff shoots the Winter Soldier's glasses, and Cap is able to remove his mask, it becomes clear that they're fighting against none other than Steve's old friend, Bucky Barnes, who was presumed to have died during the war.  The fight eventually breaks up and Steve, Natasha, and Sam are all put into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody... or so they think.  While in transit to their destination, Maria Hill reveals herself, taking control of their vehicle and helping them escape.\rMaria ends up taking them to an abandoned dam where she reveals that Nick Fury survived his surgery using a S.H.I.E.L.D.-manufactured relaxant.  S.H.I.E.L.D. won't look for him, he reasons, if it appears that he's already dead.  They have to move ahead with their plan though; Fury has three computer chips, and each one of the Insight helicarriers must be infiltrated and have their chips swapped out for the mission to work.  If they do that, they bring down both Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D.  The latter is too compromised to continue.\rBucky, meanwhile, begins to recover memories of his past.  After he was brought in by Hydra he was rehabilitated and experimented on.  Pierce comes in to see him and receive a mission report before wiping his mind and starting over. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills Secretary Pierce?", "correct": "Nick Fury", "options": ["Black Widow", "The Winter Soldier", "Captain America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNick Fury.\n\n\tWith Project Insight set to launch, the World Security Council is brought in by Pierce to watch the launch.  Cap, Maria, and Sam head into the control room and Cap reveals Hydra's plans to the facility, revealing the infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. and its forces.  This, of course, leads to a bit of a stand-off.  Shots are fired, and in the control room, Pierce's men override the launch controls for the helicarriers to commence Project Insight early.  Cap and Sam trek out immediately, but Romanoff, posing as one of the World Security Council members, holds Pierce at gunpoint inside his office.  She quickly gets behind the computer controls, intending to dump all of Hydra's and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secrets onto the internet.  The efforts are worthwhile; Cap and Falcon manage to get the chip into the first and second helicarriers.\rBucky ends up arriving on the ground, destroying any chance of air support for Cap and Falcon.  At the same time, Nick Fury arrives by chopper, landing and entering Pierce's office to give the final override.  To save himself and Romanoff, Fury fires at Pierce twice, killing him.  Pierce's last words: \"Hail Hydra.\" \n"}, {"text": "Steve survives the fight on the helicarrier, but only because of which of these?", "correct": "He's saved from drowning.", "options": ["His parachute deploys.", "He's picked up in a helicopter.", "The Avengers arrive to help."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's saved from drowning.\n\n\tCap and Falcon end up on the final carrier but Bucky is already waiting for them.  He kicks Steve over the edge, still unable to recognize him, and he tears one of Falcon's wings off and sends him spiralling to the ground.\rOn the final helicarrier, Bucky and Steve stand in each other's way and there's no choice but to fight.  Cap gets shot repeatedly and, in the last couple of seconds, as the helicarrier reaches the threshold and lines up shots for millions upon millions of targets, he swaps out the chips, allowing Maria to line up the shots on the other helicarriers and have them fire on each other.  Steve has her fire the shots before he can escape.\rAs the helicarrier crashes to the ground, Steve watches as Bucky is pinned under a steel beam.  He goes back to free him and though the two fight, Steve tries to get through to his friend, first by removing his mask and then by dropping his shield.  Steve lets Bucky hit him, but there's a moment of realization and Steve is dropped from the plane and into the Triskelion's pools.  Bucky is the one to pull him out of the water, but he doesn't see him walk off.  Steve instead wakes up to find Sam by his bedside in the hospital.  They later meet with Nick Fury at his grave to discuss Hydra's further infiltration.  Fury heads to Europe to continue this.\rNatasha Romanoff is brought before an intelligence committee to explain her and Steve's actions and she explains to them that she and Steve won't be placed in prison because they're the ones most qualified to protect the world.  She hands a folder off to Steve - Bucky's - and it's clear that he and Sam are planning to go after him. \n"}]}
