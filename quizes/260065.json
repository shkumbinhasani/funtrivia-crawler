{"id": "260065", "name": "The Art of Battle in \"Guild Wars\" Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Guild Wars", "Guild Wars 1"], "questions": [{"text": "In PvE (Player vs. the Environment), what is the highest Death Penalty that you can achieve?", "correct": "60%", "options": ["100%", "30%", "50%"], "explanation": "\n\n\n60%.\n\n\tIf any character is killed while completing the campaign, they will take a 15% Death Penalty, lowering both their overall health and energy temporarily.  To remove the Death Penalty, you either need to defeat enemies, capture skills, or enter a town or outpost.  Defeating bosses will also cut the penalty back down. Henchmen and Heroes can both gain Death Penalty as well, and there is a cap at 60%.  In later stages of a campaign, the Death Penalty can be a player's ultimate enemy as it will decrease chances of advancing.  If all players die in battle, they will be transported to the nearest resurrection shrine. However, if they all die within a mission, they will be transported to the outpost marking the start of the mission. \n"}, {"text": "How can a player gain a Morale Boost?", "correct": "By defeating a boss", "options": ["By defeating all enemies in an area", "By using certain spells", "By picking up rare items"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy defeating a boss.\n\n\tAlso in PvE, a player can gain a Morale Boost, which is the polar opposite of the dreaded Death Penalty.  The Morale Boost will raise health and energy by a certain amount.  Defeating a boss will give a player a 2% Morale Boost, and defeating more bosses will stack the boosts.  In certain areas and missions, defeating certain other enemies (such as Sand Giants in Thirty River) will give a Morale Boost. If a player is killed in battle, they will still receive a 15% Death Penalty, but the blow won't be as hard, as what may have been a 2% Morale Boost will only translate to a 13% Death Penalty (rather than 15%) after death. Like Dealth Penalties, Morale Boosts are lost when a player enters a town or outpost. \n"}, {"text": "How many skills can a player hold in their Skill Bar?", "correct": "Eight", "options": ["Six", "Five", "One at a time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight.\n\n\tThe skill bar is on the bottom of the screen along with the Health and Energy bars.  Skills can be both captured and bought in the game if you have enough skill points (and/or a Signet of Capture) and they will be key in defeating many enemies.  For the melee characters, skills may also be comprised of certain attacks rather than spells that are more of a skill for a magic-type user. Paragons and Warriors also make use of adrenaline in order to use these skills.  After defeating a certain amount of enemies, taking and receiving damage, adrenaline will rise.  Skills make use of energy, found in the blue bar next to the health bar. Skills known as 'Elite Skills' can also be captured by bosses found later in the campaigns. \n"}, {"text": "Players with which primary/secondary profession will be able to use a pet in battle?", "correct": "Ranger", "options": ["Warrior", "Mesmer", "Ritualist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRanger.\n\n\tThe Ranger profession has the Beast Mastery attribute which allows it to charm a beast found in the explorable areas of a campaign.  Depending on where a player is, they can find different animals to gain as pets (eg. Lynxes, Bears, Tigers, Flamingos, Moa Birds, etc.).  Once a pet is charmed it will appear on the party toolbar and can be somewhat controlled by the player.  Certain skills will allow a Ranger to control a pet's skills as well.  Like players and Heroes, pets have a level cap of 20. \n"}, {"text": "Battling other players in PvP can also be quite the challenge.  If you're participating in a guild battle, you can earn Faction for the side that you are on.  Besides Kurzick and Luxon Faction, what type of Faction can also be obtained?", "correct": "Balthazar & Balthazar Faction", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalthazar & Balthazar Faction.\n\n\tIn the lands of \"Guild Wars\", Balthazar is the God of War and Fire.  In Guild Battles as well as arenas and tournaments, you can earn Balthazar Faction by defeating your opponents.  When you have earned enough, you can redeem the points for heroes, skills, and special items at a Priest of Balthazar, and you can use them on your PvP characters.  Statues of Balthazar can be found throughout the campaigns. \n"}, {"text": "How many henchmen can be assigned to your team in Shing Jea Monastery and Ascalon City (Post-Searing)?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "Eight", "Seven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tIf you'd rather not build a party with other members in the game, you can always create a group from henchmen that are usually located near the entrance/exit to an area.  These are often comprised of healers, fighters, casters, and more.  As you progress through a campaign, the henchmen will increase in level and stregth and the amount of henchmen you can hold will increase to a party size of eight.  You can not customize henchmen. \n"}, {"text": "You can have a maximum of two heroes in your party at any time.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThere is a maximum of three that can go into your party along with henchmen and other party members.  Heroes were introduced in \"Guild Wars: Nightfall\", the third campaign, although you can obtain them in other campaigns once you have \"Nightfall\" installed.  They're similar to henchmen, but you can customize them and control them entirely.  Many of the henchmen can be obtained through the main quest, and you can often buy them new skills and armor.  Like players and pets, you can level them up in battle. \n"}, {"text": "What happens to a party when all members are killed in an explorable, non-mission area?", "correct": "They are resurrected at a shrine", "options": ["They are sent back to the last outpost/town", "They are sent to the entrance of the area", "They become zombies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are resurrected at a shrine.\n\n\tIf all players are killed, they are sent to the resurrction shrine in an area and are given the immediate 15% Death Penalty.  This isn't necessary though.  Players with Monk or Non-Attribute skills also have the ability to resurrect or restore life in other players once they have fallen in battle, but this may come at great risk.  Players will still suffer the penalty following this.  there may be multiple shrines in an area, but in a mission, once the entire party dies, they must return to the mission entrance/outpost.  Alliance Battles make use of the shrine as it is a timed battle. \n"}, {"text": "Which profession is not considered a caster profession?", "correct": "Dervish", "options": ["Elementalist", "Mesmer", "Monk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDervish.\n\n\tDervish is primarily a melee class as it uses a scythe and prayers (earth and wind) in order to enhance strength.  The other three professions are casters as they usually use ranged spells in order to participate in battle.  Elementalists use the powers of the elements to attack enemies or support the party.  Mesmers often use hexes and degeneration spells to lower enemy health.  Monks are primarily a support class and are rarely used for their smiting skills.  This is due to the fact that they posess many strong healing skills that can keep the party alive in battle. \n"}, {"text": "There are many missions throughout the campaigns in each game.  Which of these is not an area dedicated to Challenge Missions?", "correct": "Arkjok Ward", "options": ["Dajkah Inlet", "Altrumm Ruins", "The Aurios Mines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArkjok Ward.\n\n\tArkjok Ward is a Kournan explorable area north of Yohlon Haven.  The other areas are Challenge Missions, which are quite fun in terms of battle areas.  In these missions, you form a party and fight hoards of enemies for faction, money, armor, or experience.  The only area for these missions in the \"Prophecies\" campaign is on Battle Isles, but you can also find such areas in Kaineng City, Echovald Forest, and the Jade Sea in Cantha and in Kourna, the Desolation, and the Realm of Torment in Elona. \n"}]}
