Her father comes upstairs to speak to her about the situation; they're expecting to move out of their penthouse, but Kate doesn't want to.  After lunch with her mother, Eleanor, the worst happens; New York City is attacked by the Chitauri invasion brought on by Loki, and with the Bishops' penthouse down the street from Avengers HQ, they're directly in the line of fire.  The only thing that stops the Chitauri from doing more damage is, as Kate spies, the arrows shot by Clint Barton.  He leaps off a nearby building as Eleanor grabs her daughter and rushes her from the apartment.\r Kate's father, Derek, doesn't survive the attack.  At his funeral, Kate worries that the Chitauri might, one day, come back, and she needs to protect herself and her mother when that day comes.  It's why she asks for a bow and arrow.\r In the present day, Kate has trained herself to be an adaptable aspiring hero.  Though she practices on her university archery team, she gets herself into trouble when she fires an arrow at her university's clocktower bell, destroying the building altogether. \n"}, {"text": "At a hidden auction, Kate finds items up for bid that used to belong to what mysterious Avengers-related figure?", "correct": "Ronin", "options": ["Peter Quill", "Black Widow", "Tony Stark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRonin.\n\n\tIn New York City, meanwhile, it's nearly Christmas as Clint Barton attends the Broadway show \"Rogers: The Musical\", based on the life and exploits of Captain America.  He and his family watch on with a fair amount of stress; Barton himself finds himself in a significant amount of distress having to watch a generally traumatic experience brought back to life before him.  It's why he and his kids leave before the show ends and head out into the city to enjoy themselves.\r Kate, meanwhile, returns to the city and heads directly to her mother's apartment.  Though Eleanor is angry that her daughter destroyed a clock tower, an apology is the first step to dealing wth the issue.  The second step, as Eleanor insists, is having Kate join her and her boyfriend, Jack Duquesne, at a charity auction.\r It's at the auction that Kate discovers, from Duquesne's uncle Armand, that Jack isn't just a boyfriend-- he's a fiance.  Going outside to get some air and cope with the news, Kate runs into a dog with one eye who, momentarily, watches her at the gate.  When she goes inside she's surprised, once again, by her mother arguing with Armand.  Instead of rejoining the party, she follows Armand into the utility tunnels of the building, down through the kitchen, and into what appears to be a black market auction in the wine cellar.  The items up for bidding?  Artifacts from the Chitauri Invasion, pulled out from the wreckage of Avengers HQ.  The item that both Armand and his nephew, Jack, want the most is the sword used by Ronin, whose identity (of Clint Barton) remains a mystery.\r When the Ronin suit is put up for auction as well, things go south.  An explosion rings out in the room and Jack uses the ensuing confusion to steal the sword.  As a group of thugs in tracksuits search the room for a watch, Kate steals the Ronin suit for herself and puts it on. \n"}, {"text": "What name does Kate give to the one-eyed dog?", "correct": "Lucky", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLucky.\n\n\tKate fights with the thugs in the wine cellar as the auction-goers escape and though she takes a beating, she holds her own with her martial arts training, protecting herself long enough to escape out the thugs' makeshift entrance.  Outside the building, one of the thugs finds the missing watch amongst the bags of items taken from the auction, but he's attacked by the one-eyed dog.  Kate shows up in time to stop the man from doing more damage, in doing so chasing the dog out to the street to protect him from oncoming traffic.  It's why she takes him to her apartment before heading back out, following the Bishop Security app on her phone to track Armand.\r Clint brings the kids back to their hotel room and when they turn on the news they find that videos of the Ronin have already come in.  Barton, naturally, worries about the situation.\r Kate heads to Armand's apartment to find the man murdered in his sitting room.  She flees the scene before anyone can find her, but the tracksuited thugs are already outside.  A fight ensues and they trap her in a vehicle, but they're stopped by Hawkeye himself, out to find her and unmask the fake Ronin.  It's particularly interesting that he unmasks her to find a kid.\r The pair flee to Kate's apartment where Bishop, starstruck by her favourite Avenger, doesn't realize that the men in the Tracksuit Mafia, as Barton refers to them, are an old enemy of Ronin.  Not to mention, they followed her home earlier.  As the men burn down her apartment, the two archers grab the dog and leave without the suit.  They grab supplies and head to Kate's 'safe house', her aunt's apartment, which they break into with relative ease.  Later, when Clint returns to Kate's apartment, the suit is already gone. \n"}, {"text": "The man who steals Clint's outfit is active in which community?", "correct": "LARPing", "options": ["Horse racing", "Busking", "Scientology"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLARPing.\n\n\tClint sends his kids to the airport so that they can head back home to their mother while he wraps up the Ronin issue.  When he reunites with Kate and brings her to her Eleanor's security company, he tells her goodbye.  He hopes it's the last time they'll have to speak.\r He heads out to his only lead, the NYC LARP community in Central Park, since it's there that the fireman who stole the Ronin suit is known to frequent the events there.  Sure enough, Clint locates the suit but he has to join the fantasy event to get close to the thief.  Even then, it results in a spectacle; Clint purposely throws a battle in front of a crowd just to get it back.  After hiding the suit away as insurance, he heads off and allows himself to get caught by the Tracksuit Mafia; he has to find out how high up it goes.\r Kate, after spending time with her mother at work, is asked to join Jack for dinner.  When they finally eat, the dinner conversation turns, naturally, to Jack's relationship with Eleanor.  The two find that they have a shared interest in swords and indulge in a fencing match but it only gets Kate angrier.  With everything that happened over the previous days, she's certain Jack has something to do with Armand's death.\r Leaving Eleanor's, Kate calls Clint and, when he doesn't pick up, tracks his location with her mother's app.  It's not the right move; the Tracksuit Mafia is more interested in Kate anyways.  When she falls through the ceiling and into Clint's interrogation, the gang members alert their boss, Maya Lopez. \n"}, {"text": "Maya Lopez has which of these afflictions?", "correct": "Deafness", "options": ["Tourettes", "Blindness", "Brittle bone disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeafness.\n\n\tIn 2007, a young Maya Lopez, managed her way through youth not only with complete deafness, but with one leg.  Aided by her attentive father, she learned about the world, was studious, and became a strong fighter, learning martial arts by watching.  As she grew up, her abilities only strengthened.  One day, however, returning to her father's auto shop, she arrived just in time to encounter the bloodbath left behind by Ronin, the man who would kill her father.  He died in her arms.\r Lopez interrogates Clint and Kate specifically about Ronin though Clint suggests that the figure was killed by Black Widow and the rumours of his return are untrue.  The discussion leads to an escape attempt and, then, a fight between Clint and Maya where the latter gets the upper hand.  She manages to knock his hearing aid out of his ear and smash it, but the duo get away with most of their belongings.  Using Clint's trick arrows and a stolen car, Kate manages to help fend off their pursuers.  When they finally get away, he concedes-- she is a great archer.\r After walking the dog and heading to Chinatown to get Clint's hearing aid fixed, Clint and Kate continue to search for answers up the chain in the Tracksuit Mafia and Kate, leveraging her resources, suggests they sneak into her mother's penthouse to use her security credentials.  The succeed, finding a connection to a company called Sloan, Ltd., but only until Kate's locked out of the system and they're found by Jack. \n"}, {"text": "The stolen watch, it is inevitably revealed, belongs to who of these?", "correct": "Laura Barton", "options": ["Natasha Romanoff", "Tony Stark", "Maya Lopez"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaura Barton.\n\n\tKate and Clint have no choice but to explain themselves to both Jack and Eleanor, especially since Eleanor knows they accessed her computer.  Coming clean helps a bit, but after Clint departs, Eleanor makes a call.  On the way out, Clint also snags the Ronin sword, removing it from Jack's possession unnoticed.  He calls Laura to dig up any information he can about Sloan, Ltd. and discovers that not only is it a front, but the CEO is Jack Duquesne, tying him to the Tracksuit Mafia as well.  She reminds him to keep his eyes peeled for the missing watch, the original target of the auction raid.\r When Clint later informs Kate of his findings over low-key Christmas celebrations, and while the two sit back with drinks and share stories, Clint reveals a bit more about his past than he's willing to do, reminiscing about Natasha and killing he mood.  They talk about the Blip and Kate quickly deduces the truth: he was the Ronin, pushed to do what he did because his family was lost for those years.\r All the clues lead Clint and Kate back to Maya Lopez's apartment where the stolen watch seems to be emitting a signal.  Unfortunately, neither is aware Maya is the owner, and it's why they're not prepared for the ensuing fight.  Kate encounters Maya in her own apartment but at the same time, Clint is unexpectedly incapacitated by another unknown factor.  The fight spills out onto an adjacent building with the four exchanging blows.  Maya escapes minutes before Clint can unmask the unknown assailant, a woman Clint knows as Yelena Belova.  After she, too, escapes, Clint asks Kate to leave-- she needs to be kept safe, and someone has called a Black Widow assassin in to stop them. \n"}, {"text": "Was Yelena Belova a victim of the Snap?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIn the year 2018, Yelena Belova continued with her mission to deprogram the Black Widows still out in the world.  On one fateful occasion, Yelena broke into a Widow's house at the wrong moment; she stepped into the bathroom only to reemerge five years in the future.  She would come to discover that she was a victim of the Snap, only to return during the Blip.  She wasn't aware yet, but her sister had sacrificed herself to bring everyone back.\r Maya is tended to by her second-in-command, Kazi, and he advises her to stop.  Maya refuses, however, knowing she needs to exact her revenge on Ronin, at least for her father's sake.\r Kate returns to her mother's apartment after the fight at Maya's and she tells her mother the truth about Jack and Sloan, Ltd.  She tells Kate to grab her things from her apartment-- what's left of it-- and to come back home.  The next day, the police come to take Jack in for questioning; Eleanor sent for them.\r When Kate ends up at her burnt-out apartment though, she's met by Yelena who, after making a box of macaroni and cheese, asks her to sit and chat.  She's forthcoming about the truth: she's here to kill Clint.  Her sister saved the world; he did not.  And he killed too many people to be redeemed.  Additionally, Yelena was hired to kill Clint; she's on assignment.  Before leaving out the window, she asks Kate not to get in her way again, no matter how enamoured she is with Clint. \n"}, {"text": "Yelena reveals that she was hired by who of the following to kill Clint?", "correct": "Eleanor", "options": ["Maya", "Jack", "No one-- she's out for herself this time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEleanor.\n\n\tClint stops in with the LARPers and ensures Kate's dog is taken care of and he spends the night on the couch.  The next day he sends out a message urging Maya to head to the place where she first met the Ronin, alone.  And it's why he dons the Ronin outfit and heads to her father's old garage.  The two fight in close combat (after Clint dispatches all the guards) and they find themselves evenly-matched, but it ends when he removes his mask and reveals the truth.  He threatens that if she comes for his family, then he will kill her, but he leaves her be.\r The real clincher is that Clint reveals why he killed her father-- he was sent there as a mercenary.  Someone from within tipped off her boss, and Clint was hired to do it.  In retaliation, Maya grabs Clint's sword and takes a swing, but Kate, hiding on a nearby rooftop, saves him at the last moment with a quick shot.  The archers escape in an Uber while Maya reunites with Kazi...who she realizes wasn't with her father on the night of the murder.\r The next morning, Kate receives a handful of messages from Yelena.  As it turns out, Yelena has determined who hired her; it was none other than Kate's mother.  In an image she sends over, Eleanor is seen speaking to the very man Clint's been worried about the entire time: Wilson Fisk, better known as Kingpin. \n"}, {"text": "Who admits to killing Armand?", "correct": "Eleanor", "options": ["Jack", "Kingpin", "Clint"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEleanor.\n\n\tNot knowing that she's being tailed by Yelena, Eleanor heads through New York to meet with a professional partner of hers-- Wilson Fisk-- and rescind from their long-expired deal on account of Kate's uncovering of the truth.  She admits to him that she dealt with Armand and she framed Jack as the alleged CEO of Sloan, Ltd., but she's ready to leave to protect her daughter.  Seeing the video evidence of this, Clint vows to get Kate and her mother out of the mess.  After all, Kate's his partner.  They head out to make some trick arrows.\r Maya stops in to visit Fisk and speak to him.  Though Fisk is surprised by the sudden turn-around in attitude that Maya has taken, he waits until she leaves to confide in Kazi that she's turned on them.  The people need to be reminded, Fisk tells him, that the city belongs to him.  It's why, that evening, Kazi sets himself up in a building across the street from the Bishop Security company party and sets up his rifle.\r At the party, Kate and Clint arrive with their assets, the NYC LARPing community, in tow posing as servers.  They don't notice that Yelena has also arrived.  When Eleanor makes it to the festivities, Kate shows her the video and asks for the truth, but Kazi, spying from the adjacent building, takes his shots at Barton instead while he has a chance, throwing the event into disarray and tossing the original plan out the window.  Of course, Yelena pursues Clint, so Kate follows alongside her to throw a wrench in the plan. \n"}, {"text": "Does Clint make it home in time to celebrate Christmas with his family?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhile the LARPers and Jack start to take care of the Tracksuit Mafia members who come in for the party, Clint reaches Kazi and battles with him, taking him down long enough to leap into the tree in front of Rockefeller Plaza.  Once the situation is stable, Kate uses trick arrows to bring down the tree, spilling it out onto the skating rink and freeing Clint from it and, there, the two archers are able to hold back the Tracksuit Mafia enough to get free using everything at their disposal.\r While Kate runs off to find her mother, Kazi nearly manages to fire a shot at Clint.  He only ends up missing when Yelena swoops in to make her move and Maya interrupts Kazi's work.  Maya begs him to leave New York with her and start somewhere new, but he insists that Kingpin won't let them.  He lashes out with one of Clint's arrows, but she turns it back on him, stabbing him and leaving him to die.\r Kate manages to find her mother just as Fisk does, and though the two start to fight one another, Eleanor manages to bring down the Kingpin by hitting him with her car.  It doesn't work for long.  Fisk gets up and keeps beating her down, snapping all of her trick arrows.  She's only able to win the fight when she activates one of the most dangerous arrowheads in the back.  When the police arrive, Eleanor is taken into custody for Armand's murder.\r Yelena begs Clint for the truth about her sister and he says she wouldn't believe him, but she needs to know that Natasha sacrificed herself to save the world.  He fought her to stop, but Natasha was better than him.  Yelena is one hit away from putting an end to Clint, but when he uses the secret whistle that she shared with Natasha, she realizes that he really did care for her.  When they both come to terms with their grief, she departs and leaves him alive.\r When the cops search the scene, they find that Fisk has managed to escape into the night.  He makes it as far as a nearby alleyway where he's confronted by Maya.  She aims a gun at him and fires.\r When the night comes to an end, Clint expresses his pride in Kate before the two pack up.  When Christmas Day finally arrives, Clint makes it home to his family with Kate and Lucky in tow, and just in time.  He hands Laura her old watch before taking Kate outside for one last matter of business.  Together, the two of them burn the Ronin suit and put an end to the mercenary once and for all. \n"}]}
