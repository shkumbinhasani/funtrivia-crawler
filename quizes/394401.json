{"id": "394401", "name": "Getting Somewhere With \"Harry Potter\" Online Trivia  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "Harry Potter"], "questions": [{"text": "Which character uses a magically-enchanted flying motorbike to bring an infant Harry Potter to the Dursleys' House at Number 4, Privet Drive in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"?", "correct": "Rubeus Hagrid", "options": ["Albus Dumbledore", "Minerva McGonagall", "Sirius Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRubeus Hagrid.\n\n\tThe first book in the \"Harry Potter\" series commences with Harry's delivery at Number 4, Privet Drive as he's left with the Dursleys after his parents' death at the hand of Voldemort's underlings, the Death Eaters.  Hagrid's motorbike, seen in the first novel, is later discovered to have been given to him by Sirius Black, Harry's godfather, on that fateful night when Harry became 'The Boy Who Lived' for the purpose of bringing him to his Muggle family. The motorbike made a reappearance in \"The Deathly Hallows\", again piloted by Hagrid, during the Battle of the Seven Potters.  It would later be repaired by Arthur Weasley after taking damages in said battle. \n"}, {"text": "Before using the Firebolt gifted to him in \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\", Harry Potter flew on which of these broomstick models?", "correct": "Nimbus 2000", "options": ["Cleansweep Eleven", "Moontrimmer", "Thunderbolt VII"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNimbus 2000.\n\n\tThe Nimbus 2000 lasted Harry most of three novels in the series after it was gifted to him in \"The Philosopher's Stone\" by Minerva McGonagall early on in his Quidditch career (to take advantage of his natural abilities as a Seeker).  It did, however, become a bit of a detriment when, in \"The Chamber of Secrets\", Draco Malfoy bought his way onto the Slytherin team as a Seeker with Nimbus 2001 models. The Nimbus 2000 was destroyed by the Whomping Willow in \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" after an encounter with the Dementors flying around Hogwarts, but Sirius Black anonymously sent him a Firebolt for Christmas during the same year. The Firebolt became the professional competition standard, as seen during the Quidditch World Cup Finals in \"The Goblet of Fire\". \n"}, {"text": "The Goblins of Gringotts Wizarding Bank navigate the vaults of their establishment using which of these modes of transportation?", "correct": "Mine cart", "options": ["Elevator", "Magic carpet", "Monorail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMine cart.\n\n\tHarry encounters these mine carts during his first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid, discovering his modest wealth in the vaults below.  To get to the vault, however, Harry is required to hop into a mine cart and descend into the caverns below Gringotts.  The mine carts reappear in \"The Deathly Hallows\" when Harry, Ron, and Hermione need to infiltrate Bellatrix Lestrange's vault to locate Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes.  Some of the tracks beneath Gringotts seem to have been destroyed by the dragon living there, described as a Ukrainian Ironbelly in the films. \n"}, {"text": "The Hogwarts Express departs from Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters at King's Cross Station and arrives at which of these locations to drop off its students?", "correct": "Hogsmeade Station", "options": ["Diagon Alley Station", "Aviemore Station", "Surbiton Station"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHogsmeade Station.\n\n\tInterestingly, although the train is taken by some of the characters in nearly every book (there are notable exceptions!), only two stations are seen, both terminal stations-- King's Cross and Hogsmeade.  Despite the train ending its run in Hogsmeade, which is a fair distance from Hogwarts proper, the students of the school are brought to the castle via other means, whether that be boat or carriage or otherwise. The Hogwarts Express plays a pretty important role in student life since it's a Ministry of Magic mandate that all students ride it on September 1st to attend.  It's a monumental location in \"The Philosopher's Stone\" either way-- Harry met Ron and the Weasleys at King's Cross and they showed him how to get onto the magical platform. Harry and Ron would later meet Hermione for the first time on the train.  All three would go on to be sorted into Gryffindor. \n"}, {"text": "Floo Powder, as a substance, allows users to travel by which means (as seen in \"The Chamber of Secrets\")?", "correct": "Through fireplaces", "options": ["On the wind", "Inside animals", "Through the sewers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThrough fireplaces.\n\n\tHarry is introduced to Floo Powder early in \"The Chamber of Secrets\" when, while visiting the Weasleys, he is shown how to use the Floo Network to travel from The Burrow to Diagon Alley.  Unfortunately, he ends up doing so incorrectly, being unable to properly say 'Diagon Alley' when he steps into the fireplace, and he gets sent to the adjacent Knockturn Alley. Floo Powder reappears in several of the books, usually as a method the characters use to travel long distances in relative speediness.  To combat Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters, the Ministry of Magic restricted Floo Network use severely, cutting off many paths to avoid exploitation. \n"}, {"text": "Early in \"The Chamber of Secrets\", Harry and Ron have no choice but to fly to Hogwarts in an enchanted vehicle when Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters is sealed off to them.  What model car do they drive?", "correct": "Ford Anglia", "options": ["Toyota Celica", "Chevrolet Master Deluxe", "Vauxhall Cavalier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFord Anglia.\n\n\tArthur Weasley's Ford Anglia 105E Deluxe is enchanted with the ability to fly, and it appears repeatedly throughout \"The Chamber of Secrets\", first showing up when the Weasleys pick Harry up at Number 4, Privet Drive to bring him to The Burrow.  The boys later fly the car to Hogwarts when the platform is sealed off (by Dobby, as they later discover) and they crash into the Whomping Willow upon their arrival.  The car later reappears to save Harry, Ron, and Fang (Hagrid's dog) from the spiders in the Forbidden Forest.  It was never seen again after that. \n"}, {"text": "The Knight Bus, used by Harry in \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\", contains how many levels?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["One", "Two", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThis purple triple-decker bus appears near the beginning of \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\", appearing for Harry after he's forced to leave Number 4, Privet Drive in a rush (having inflated his Aunt Marge).  Despite having three layers, the bus has many interesting magical properties-- it's significantly larger on the inside (able to fit large furniture, for instance) and it's also able to manipulate its size in various ways, squeezing through other cars on busy streets.  Harry ends up taking it to The Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley in the book, but others claim to have ridden it in later novels. \n"}, {"text": "Half eagle and half horse, what creature is ridden by Harry and Hermione in \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" after saving its life?", "correct": "Hippogriff", "options": ["Griffin", "Centaur", "Dragon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHippogriff.\n\n\tWhen Hagrid becomes the Professor of the Care of Magical Creatures class in Harry's third year, his first lesson features Hippogriffs and while it proves to be a valuable lesson, Draco Malfoy is injured when he provokes the creature, leading the Ministry of Magic to request its execution.  The hippogriff, named Buckbeak, is later saved by Harry and Hermione after they use the Time-Turner to fix the culminating events at the climax of the book. In addition to saving Buckbeak and leaving him in Sirius Black's care, they solve the mystery of Black's whereabouts (in the Whomping Willow), discover Professor Lupin's secret (he's a werewolf) and fight off Dementors. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these items proved to be an unauthorized Portkey in \"The Goblet of Fire\", transporting Harry to a graveyard?", "correct": "The Triwizard Cup", "options": ["The Golden Dragon Egg", "The Goblet of Fire", "The Quidditch World Cup"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Triwizard Cup.\n\n\tIn the climactic final stage of the Triwizard Tournament, pitting Harry against Cedric Diggory, Fleur Delacour, and Viktor Krum, it's discovered by both Harry and Cedric that the Triwizard Cup at the center of a large labyrinth is actually a Portkey crafted by the false Mad-Eye Moody, Harry's fourth year Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher (who'd been captured and portrayed by Barty Crouch Jr., a Death Eater).  The Portkey, which can teleport the holder to a specific destination, takes the two to a graveyard where Diggory is killed by Peter Pettigrew and Harry is used to bring Lord Voldemort back to life. Typically, Portkeys are tracked, to some degree, by the Ministry of Magic. \n"}, {"text": "Draco Malfoy was able to use a Vanishing Cabinet to transport Death Eaters into Hogwarts in \"The Half-Blood Prince\".  Where was the cabinet placed?", "correct": "The Room of Requirement", "options": ["The Owlery", "The Chamber of Secrets", "The Forbidden Forest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Room of Requirement.\n\n\tHarry and his friends used the Room of Requirement in \"The Order of the Phoenix\" to reestablish the order and combat both Voldemort's growing army and Dolores Umbridge's reign of terror as the new Headmaster of Hogwarts (in Dumbledore's absence).  The room was later used by a number of students and professors in \"The Half-Blood Prince\", but none moreso than Draco Malfoy who used the room to store his Vanishing Cabinet, connected to a similar unit in the Borgin and Burkes shop in Knockturn Alley. It's through this that he was able to grant Death Eaters passage into the school, and in \"The Deathly Hallows\" it was presumed destroyed when the Room of Requirement was set ablaze. \n"}]}
