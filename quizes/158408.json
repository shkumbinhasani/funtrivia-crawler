{"id": "158408", "name": "\"Trading Spaces\"-The Ultimate Reality Show Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Trading Spaces"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the designers bought a dishwasher for the homeowners' new kitchen?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Genevieve", "Doug", "Hildi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tThis family had three kids, but no dishwasher! They had to wash everything by hand. Since Frank was working on their kitchen, he didn't buy a couple extra things, returned an extra box of floor tiles, and finally scraped together enough money to buy a dishwasher. By the way, I know people have been saying that it's HILDA Santo-Tomas, but I have a book about \"Trading Spaces\", and it spells her name HILDI. I've also seen it spelled that way in the program credits and on a couple websites, so that's what I'm sticking with. Hildi is her nickname, and I don't think it matters which one you use. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the carpenters has written a book about major and minor home repair projects?", "correct": "Ty", "options": ["Leslie", "Amy Wynn", "Carter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTy.\n\n\tAlthough Amy Wynn and Carter are carpenters on the show, Ty is the one who wrote the book, called \"Ty's Tricks\". Leslie Sergrette is one of the carpenters on \"While You Were Out.\" \n"}, {"text": "As a very mean prank, one of the designers, on the second day, decided that he didn't like the colour of the newly painted room, and had the homeowners start painting it a different colour! Who was it?", "correct": "Doug", "options": ["Vern", "Frank", "Edward"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoug.\n\n\tIn cahoots with Paige, Doug bought a new can of paint, and made the homeowners begin painting the wall a pastel green colour. However, he revealed the joke before they'd gotten very far on it. \n"}, {"text": "Who glued straw all over the walls of a family room?", "correct": "Hildi & Hilda", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHildi & Hilda.\n\n\tThe theme of the room was supposed to be a rustic one, and Hildi decided that instead of using wallpaper with pictures of straw on it, they'd use REAL straw. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the carpenters is left-handed?", "correct": "Amy Wynn", "options": ["Carter", "Ty", "Andrew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmy Wynn.\n\n\tI caught this once when Amy Wynn was sketching a picture of the armoir she was going to build for Doug's room, and noticed that she was using her left hand. Andrew is Andrew Dan-Jumbo from \"While You Were Out\". \n"}, {"text": "One of the female designers worked on a master bedroom. She painted the cathedral ceiling gold, one of the walls brown, and left the three remaining walls white.
