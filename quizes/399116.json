However there was no possibility of mistaking the clone for the original. Why?", "correct": "The clone was 1/8 natural size", "options": ["The clone aged in reverse", "The clone was female", "The clone had negative colors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe clone was 1/8 natural size.\n\n\tDr. Evil's diminutive clone was aptly named Mini-Me. He first appeared in \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" and then again in \"Goldmember\". He is merely one eighth of Dr. Evil's size, although the sometimes very crude humor of the films contains several allusions that this size difference does not apply to a certain part of his anatomy. Interestingly, Mini-Me is not played by Mike Myers, who plays both Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, but rather by Verne Troyer and Danny DeVito.\r (Thanks to WesleyCrusher for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "The 1993 movie \"Doppelganger\" was set up to be about a woman whose evil twin followed her from New York to L.A. in order to cause her misfortune. What was the twist ending?", "correct": "She had a split-personality", "options": ["The story was all just a character reading a book", "She imagined it all while in a coma", "The \"twin\" was a robot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe had a split-personality.\n\n\tThe movie starred Drew Barrymore as Holly Gooding. In the movie, Gooding was plagued by a series of misfortunes, apparently caused by her evil twin.\r By the end of the movie, viewers learned that Gooding had a split-personality and it was her secondary identity that did most of the things to her; other events were set up and caused by her therapist, who used prosthetics to look like her client at times.\r The therapist, played by Dennis Christopher, had convinced the second identity to kill Gooding's mother and then continued his gaslighting of her life.\r (Thanks to Shadowmyst2004 for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "What meteorological term completes the name of Red ___ Cloud, an African-American man who passed himself off as a Native Indian for most of his life?", "correct": "Thunder", "options": ["Misty", "Fog", "Nimbus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThunder.\n\n\tBorn in Rhode Island in 1919 Red had a number of jobs before beginning a correspondence with an anthropology professor at the University of Pennsylvania named Frank Speck. He convinced Speck that he was of the Catawba Indian tribe, which led to the start of projects that involved the collection of folklore and other cultural data of his purported group of people. That work extended into the study of other tribes, such as the Montauk, Shinnecock, and Mashpee. Beyond this there didn't appear to be any gain for Red Thunder Cloud and, as to why he ventured down this path, is not known.\r Upon his death his name was revealed to be Carlos Westez. This too was questionable, as by his sister, who administered his will, announced his name as Cromwell Ashbie Hawkins West.\r (Thanks to pollucci19 for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "All of these books except one tell the story of an imposter who steps in to someone else's life. Which book is NOT the story of an impersonation?", "correct": "Where'd You Go, Bernadette?", "options": ["The Ivy Tree", "The Prince and the Pauper", "The Scapegoat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhere'd You Go, Bernadette?.\n\n\t\"Where'd You Go, Bernadette\", from Maria Semple, is about a woman who steps away from her own life.\r Mary Stewart's \"The Ivy Tree\" has a young woman agreeing to pretend to an identity in order to effect machinations to a will. There's a plot twist, though!\r \"The Scapegoat\", from Daphne du Maurier, has our English hero impersonating a French nobleman who wants to escape from the mess he has made of his life.\r \"The Prince and the Pauper\", by Mark Twain, tells of a poor boy in Tudor times who switches places with the Prince of Wales - they each learn something about the life lived by the other, before switching back in the nick of time.\r (Thanks to agony for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "On the TV sitcom \"Friends\", Rachel dated a man remarkably similar to Ross (and also played by David Schwimmer).  What was the man's name?", "correct": "Russ", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRuss.\n\n\tIn the season two episode \"The One With Russ\", Rachel seemed to be oblivious enough not to realize that she was coping with her true feelings for Ross by inadvertently dating...pretty much the same person.  She wasn't the only person not to notice the similarities though-- Ross himself couldn't see, even when he was standing right in front of Russ, how identical they really were.  Interestingly, Ross believed Russ was just a real jerk.\r David Schwimmer was the second cast member from the show to play twin characters; Lisa Kudrow did the same earlier on as she also played her twin sister, Ursula. \n"}, {"text": "In an 1894 adventure novel by Anthony Hope, an Englishman must stand in for the King of Ruritania in order to save the kingdom from the wicked Black Michael.

This ripsnorting ball of fun, full of swordfights, dashing villains, and an impossible love with a beautiful princess, has been re-made many times for stage, movies, television, and radio. The incorrect options are all books that have, in one way or another, rung the changes on the story.\r (Thanks to agony for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "In the episode \"Doppelgangland\" of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", Willow accidentally summons her alter ego from an alternate reality.

Vampire Willow predictably goes on to create trouble, while notably demonstrating a number of traits seen in Willow in the following years, such as a disregard for rules and her attraction to women.\r Interestingly enough, Alyson Hannigan also ended up getting a doppelganger for Lily Aldrin, her character in \"How I Met Your Mother\".\r (Thanks to Gil_Galad for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "Agent Maria Hill and what other character from the Marvel Cinematic Universe were revealed in a twist to be Skrull imposters, not the actual people, in 2019's \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\"?", "correct": "Nick Fury", "options": ["Peter Parker", "Happy Hogan", "Mysterio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNick Fury.\n\n\tTalos (played by Ben Mendelsohn), the Skrull that debuted in \"Captain Marvel\" which was released earlier in the year, used his shape-shifting abilities to impersonate Nick Fury in all but one scene that the character appeared in.

Jackson's Fury was the actual character was in a post-credit moment.\r Talos' wife Soren (played by Sharon Blynn) impersonated Maria Hill in a similar fashion throughout the movie.\r (Thanks to Shadowmyst2004 for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "On the TV show \"Community\", Abed Nadir posits an alternate 'Darkest Timeline' in which he and others wear black felt goatees.  This is actually a throwback to the evil goatee worn by a character in the \"Mirror, Mirror\" episode of what famous program?", "correct": "Star Trek", "options": ["LOST", "Black Mirror", "Twin Peaks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Trek.\n\n\tFans of \"Star Trek\" may remember \"Mirror, Mirror\" as the episode in which Captain Kirk and the others aboard the USS Enterprise traveled into a parallel 'evil' dimension, coming face-to-face with their evil twin selves.  Spock is likely the most memorable of the evil twins as the role featured Leonard Nimoy sporting a goatee.\r On \"Community\", Abed indicate the existence of the Darkest Timeline in the third season episode \"Remedial Chaos Theory\" in which there was the possibility that the study group could have befallen horrible fates on account of, potentially, a cursed Norwegian Troll doll.  The timeline would've led Pierce to die, Jeff to lose an arm, and Troy to damage his vocal cords.  Realizing that they needed to reclaim their spot as a good timeline by overthrowing the over parallel universes, Abed crafted fake goatees for everyone. \n"}, {"text": "The downfall of which confidence trickster and coin counterfeiter can be attributed to efforts of Sir Isaac Newton?", "correct": "William Chaloner", "options": ["Thomas Lightowller", "John Dodd", "Joseph Wood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Chaloner.\n\n\tWilliam Chaloner, born in Warwickshire in the late 1650s, was originally to become a nail maker's apprentice in Birmingham. He became more interested in the \"art\" of making fake groats, for which Birmingham had become notorious. Since the groat was an odd coin, with values varying at different times and crudely designed with heavy silver, it was easily produced in non-silver versions by \"craftsmen\" of Birmingham. When Chaloner later unsuccessfully attempted to find metal working employment in the legitimate Guilds of London he resorted to producing inferior products that respectable tradesmen wouldn't accept.\r His talent for \"tongue pudding\", the verbal agility of con artists, enabled him to become a quack doctor and psychic, selling fake miracle cures, telling fortunes and locating stolen goods. (Of course, he was able to recover stolen goods because he knew who stole them.) Eventually he became a counterfeiter, which was considered treason and punishable by hanging. He joined a gang and became successful and wealthy.\r In 1694 he attempted to legitimize his business by denouncing the state of the Royal Mint. Chaloner circulated pamphlets and offered means of preventing forgeries (based on his own experience). His ideas did lead to a reform of the Mint but not the way he had hoped. The Earl of Halifax was named Lord Treasurer--the very post Chaloner had hope for-- and additionally placed him in the \"crosshairs\" of the new Warden of the Mint, Sir Isaac Newton.\r Chaloner turned his attentions toward counterfeiting paper bank notes. Since there weren't any laws in place yet regarding the forgery of paper money he was able to avoid punishment. Chaloner's willingness to provide information about other counterfeiters made him a valuable informant.\r Sir Isaac Newton decided in order to restore \"respectability\" to the Royal Mint Chaloner had to be brought to justice. From the time he was appointed in 1696 Newton began building a case against Chaloner by recruiting informants and researching Chaloner's dubious background. In 1699 Chaloner was arrested for a rather minor charge of lottery fraud. Newton arranged for him to also be charged for counterfeiting with a notoriously severe trial judge.\r William Chaloner denounced witnesses as liars, feigned mental health issues and wrote numerous letters to magistrates and Newton himself. Even as he was taken to the scaffold his proclaimed his innocence saying he was to be \"murdered under pretense of Law\". He was hanged at Tyburn on March 22, 1699.\r (Thanks to Sally0Malley for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "In the 1991 film \"The Addams Family\", a man named Gordon Craven attempts to impersonate which member of the Addams clan?", "correct": "Uncle Fester", "options": ["Lurch", "Gomez", "Cousin Itt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUncle Fester.\n\n\tGordon (Christopher Lloyd) is the son of Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) to whom the Addams Family lawyer Tully (Dan Hedaya) is indebted to. Tully comes up the idea to pass Gordon on as Fester, Gomez' (Raul Julia) long lost brother, and have Gordon steal the Addams fortune from their vault. However, some of the family members see right through the plot especially Morticia and Wednesday (Anjelica Huston and Christina Ricci). Meanwhile, Gordon is not very interested in stealing the money and gradually starts assimilating into the family, preferring them to his own mother. In the end, it is revealed that Gordon is actually the real Fester but was suffering from amnesia and did not realize who he was.\r (Thanks to joepetz for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "A man is accused of a grisly crime he didn't commit, but witnesses, footage, and evidence all point to him being the perpetrator.  It's actually someone more sinister in what Stephen King novel?", "correct": "The Outsider", "options": ["The Shining", "The Dark Half", "The Talisman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Outsider.\n\n\t\"The Outsider\", released in 2018, was a later King novel that brought his works back to unsettling roots following a string of dark mystery offerings (The Bill Hodges Trilogy).  The novel featured a Little League coach accused of a child murder in his small Oklahoma town.  Although evidence confirmed his involvement, he couldn't possibly have been in two places at once.  The truth was much darker, and it turned out that there may, in fact, have been two Terry Maitlands somehow appearing in Flint City.\r The book was quickly optioned for a miniseries and the rights were sold to HBO with actor Jason Bateman to fill the role of the accused Terry Maitland. \n"}, {"text": "A man named Tom is sent by a wealthy magnate to persuade his son, Dickie, to return home from Italy.

Tom befriends Dickie but falls in love with Dickie's money and lifestyle. He senses that Dickie is beginning to tire of him, so he kills him and adopts his identity. When one of Dickie's friends smells a rat he too is bumped off. The police start to take a closer look and Ripley rescues himself by reverting to his own identity and convincing Dickie's family that Dickie had committed suicide. Prior to this Ripley had faked a transfer of Dickie's will to himself and, when the heat has cooled, retires to a Greek island, a wealthy man.\r (Thanks to pollucci19 for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "Which \"purveyor\" of a certain landmark was responsible for the \"Rumanian Box\" scam?", "correct": "Victor Lustig", "options": ["Robert P McCulloch", "George C Parker", "Edouard de Stoeckl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictor Lustig.\n\n\tKnown as the man who sold the Eiffel Tower, \"Count\" Victor Lustig was known for the Rumanian Box con.

Each one measured approximately 12 inches square with a narrow slot cut in each end complete with elaborate dials and knobs.\r While in Palm Beach Lustig found the perfect \"mark\" for his scam. Herman Loller was looking for a way to preserve his fortune. Lustig demonstrated his \"money making machine\", assuring the eager Loller that it wasn't counterfeiting and banks would accept this money. Lustig inserted a $1,000 bill in one end of the box and a piece of white paper in the other end. He then made an elaborate show of turning the knobs/ dials and both the money and the paper were sucked into the box. Lustig told Loller the paper had to soak in the chemicals for six hours. Six hours later Lustig turned the knobs and out came two identical bills. Lustig had Loller take the money to the bank to confirm that they were real. Unbeknownst to Loller, Lustig had previously concealed a second bill in the box with carefully altered serial numbers so they matched. Loller paid Lustig $25,000 for the box. When repeatedly unsuccessful at his attempts, it took Loller two weeks to realized he had been conned and Lustig was long gone!\r (Thanks to Salley0Malley for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "In the television show 'Bewitched', what was the name of Samantha's mischievous cousin, who enjoyed pretending to be Samantha in order to create a bit of \"fun\"?", "correct": "Serena", "options": ["Sabrina", "Jeannie", "Pandora"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSerena.\n\n\tElizabeth Montgomery played both characters, although the credits listed Serena as being played by Pandora Spocks for most of the episodes in which she appeared. This pseudonym was intended to connote Pandora's Box, which, in Greek mythology, contained a number of evils which were unintentionally released by the curious Pandora. In modern usage, opening Pandora's box suggests that one has set in chain a series of events that will lead to unspecified problems - quite like what Serena does in each appearance!\r (Thanks to looney_tunes for the question!) \n"}, {"text": "In the novella \"The Double,\" Golyadkin, a government clerk, is mocked and tormented by a doppelganger and slowly descends into paranoia and madness.

During a snowstorm he meets a man who looks exactly like him physically but possesses all the charm and social skills that Golyadkin lacks.

The truth was that these copies, known as 'The Tethered', were mirror images who needed to kill their other selves to be freed from the darkness.  While many around the world would fall, the surviving copies would take their places.\r The film was, like \"Get Out\", an allegory in a number of ways.  Like its predecessor, it dealt heavily with the theme of otherness and marginalized experience, though \"Us\" took the literal 'double-goer' and ran with it.  The film was heavily praised by critics. \n"}, {"text": "In an interview with the \"Minneapolis Business Journal\" which profession did Frank Abagnale, the real-life subject of the film \"Catch Me If You Can\", say was the easiest to fake?", "correct": "Lawyer", "options": ["Pilot", "Doctor", "Teacher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLawyer.\n\n\t\"Of all the things I did, the easiest profession (to fake) was the lawyer,\" stated Abagnale. He went on to explain: \"As the lawyer, I found most of it was a matter of research, which I was great at - that's what I did to death - and then basically persuading people that you're right and they're wrong.\"\r On an interesting note, Abagnale did manage to pass the Louisiana Bar exam on his third try, claiming he did it with few weeks of intense studying. With a forged Harvard Law graduate transcript he worked as a legal assistant for a Louisiana firm until suspicions arose concerning his alleged Harvard background. He resigned before his employers could investigate.\r In his legitimate career he opened Abagnale & Associates in Oklahoma, a consulting business which advises companies on fraud, with a clientele of about 14,000 businesses using his anti-fraud measures. He has also worked for the FBI as a consultant and lecturer.\r (Thanks to Sally0Malley for this question!) \n"}, {"text": "In the 1993 film \"Dave\" the titular character, played by Kevin Kline, runs an employment agency but makes extra money on the side impersonating whom?", "correct": "The President of the United States", "options": ["Dave Clark", "Liberace", "The Prime Minister of Freedonia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe President of the United States.\n\n\tDave Kovac makes a little extra cash impersonating Bill Mitchell, the President.
