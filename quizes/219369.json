Well, what was the very Italian sounding name of his faithful doggie? ", "correct": "Gala Poochy Pup", "options": ["Poochy Pagliocci", "Ottorino Retrievi", "Verdi's Cur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGala Poochy Pup.\n\n\t\"Rootie Kazootie\" was a puppet show about a baseball loving little fella in the very early 50s who had the oddest smile you ever saw! All bottom lip and a few teeth! His girlfriend's name was odd too, but that's another quiz question! There were a bunch of other characters, all with clever, silly names similar to Rootie's, all through the show: Deetle Dottle, El Squeeko and Poison Zoomack being some of the others. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Dobie Gillis' rival on the TV show \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\"?", "correct": "Chatsworth Osborne Jr.", "options": ["Philip Havelock Dresden", "Reginald Van De Camp", "Linus Van Pelt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChatsworth Osborne Jr.\n\n\tChatsworth Osborne Jr. was Dobie's snotty, rich, high born rival for the affections of one Thalia Meninger, played by Tuesday Weld. \r \"Dobie\" was one of the cleverest shows about teens ever on TV, and had a ton of taglines and innovations associated with it. \"Lenny & Squiggy\" from \"Laverne & Shirley\" owe a lot to this show, as did \"Parker Lewis Can't Lose\". \n"}, {"text": "Which puppeteer operated Kukla and Ollie on the 50/60s kiddie show \"Kukla, Fran & Ollie\"?", "correct": "Burr Tilstrom", "options": ["Paul Winchell", "Shari Lewis", "Bil & Cora Baird"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurr Tilstrom.\n\n\tThe characters were used a number of times on NBC and CBS, in the 50s, 60s and 70s. Though initially an NBC property, in the 70s they were used as hosts of the \"CBS Childrens' Film Festival\". Burr Tilstrom also was part of a satirical show of the sixties that was a clone of a British show. \n"}, {"text": "There was  one TV show that comedy writer Buck Henry was a regular performer on and contributor to. Englishman David Frost and regular \"What's My Line?\" panelist Henry Morgan also appeared on this show. What was its name?", "correct": "That Was The Week That Was", "options": ["The Smothers Brothers' Comedy Hour", "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In", "What's It All About World?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat Was The Week That Was.\n\n\t\"That Was The Week That Was\", or \"TW3\" as it was called by its shrill fans, was the pretentious, weak clone of a British hit show that featured parodies of topical news stories and supposedly scathing satire in general. David Frost also managed to appear on this one as he had in the British version. \r It was on opposite \"Peyton Place\" on NBC on Tuesdays and was routinely clobbered in the ratings. It only lasted one year. \n"}, {"text": "Okay...you might know his dog's name, but what was the name of Rootie Kazootie's girlfriend?", "correct": "Polka Dottie", "options": ["Betty Balloons", "Susan Spotless", "Lotta Leggy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPolka Dottie.\n\n\tYep...Polka Dottie...now you know why \"Howdy Doody\" kicked his butt in Kiddie Nielsen Land. \r \"Rootie\" was also one of the few 50s kiddie icons that either wasn't revived on TV or kept alive in print or toys more than two years beyond its TV demise. \"Winky Dink\" came back, so did \"Howdy\", Lord knows how many times, Shari Lewis, \"Yogi Bear\", \"Kukla, Fran and Ollie\".... \"Captain Kangaroo\" lasted well into the 80s....what happened to li'l Rootie and his pals? \n"}, {"text": "What famous musical about baseball was Ray Walston, of TV's \"My Favorite Martian\", a major player in, both stage and screen?", "correct": "Damn Yankees", "options": ["The Angry Red Sox", "Getting To Third Base", "Phillie Phollies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDamn Yankees.\n\n\tRay Walston, as a matter of fact, was a major denizen of Broadway, period. He was also in \"South Pacific\", and frequently repeated his Broadway roles in the film versions of the plays. He had very good comic timing and made anal retentives respectable. \n"}, {"text": "\"There's a holdup in the Bronx! Brooklyn's broken out in fights! There's a traffic jam in Harlem that's backed up to Jackson Heights! There's a scout troop short a child! Krushchev's due at_____!\"", "correct": "Idlewild", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nIdlewild.\n\n\tNat Hiken, who created the show \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" that the above song was taken from, was the James Burrows of his day. All he had to do was look at a script, come up with a concept, and it would turn into a classic. This was the same man who originated the old \"Sgt. Bilko\" show, \"You'll Never Get Rich\", which made a lot of TV comedy actors famous. \r \"Car 54\" was about the misadventures of two NYPD cops, Gunther Toody and Francis Muldoon, who worked out of a precinct that looked suspiciously like the barracks of one Ernie Bilko. One of their colleagues was a cop named Schnauzer, an allusion to the Bilko character Doberman, who was played by Maurice Gosfield. Schnauzer was played by the extremely long lived comedian, Al Lewis, who could have been a \"gurning\" champion with very little effort. Beatrice Pons, the woman who played Gunther's wife, was hilarious! \n"}, {"text": "Remember \"Bewitched\", a show that was sort of a typical, plastic 60s TV sitcom, that wasted some terrific talent? Hold on to your hat! What famous director/producer/writer/wunderkind did Agnes Moorehead work with in TV a few years before she became \"Endora\"?", "correct": "Rod Serling", "options": ["Rod Amateau", "Hy Averback", "Mike Nichols"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRod Serling.\n\n\tLike many of the members of the show's cast, Moorehead had worked in much better quality fare than the saccharine \"Bewitched\". She was, in fact, in Orson Welles' most famous film, \"Citizen Kane\". The _other_ \"wunderkind\" she worked with, in TV, was Rod Serling, on the classic \"Twilight Zone\" episode, \"The Invaders\", about an old lady and a UFO. She also won a Golden Globe for best supporting actress for her role in \"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\". We lost Ms. Moorehead in 1974 to lung cancer. \n"}, {"text": "Alice Ghostley, who played Esmeralda, went on to play a character on a popular CBS sitcom of the 90s, often singing the praises of the one black character on the show. What was the name of this sitcom?", "correct": "\"Designing Women\"", "options": ["\"Everybody Loves Feng Shue\"", "\"Northern Exposure\"", "\"Cybil\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Designing Women\".\n\n\tAlice Ghostley, believe it or not, was one of the oldest members of the cast of \"Bewitched\", and she survived just about everybody! Ms. Ghostley played the funny character Bernice Clifton, a character written much funnier than poor, bedraggled Esmeralda on \"Bewitched\", on this CBS show about two sisters and two friends who ran an interior design business in the laid back, liberalized  Georgia of the 1990s. She usually played domestics or harried, working-class housewives all through her career. She had been working in TV since the early 50s! \n"}, {"text": "Maurice Evans played \"Maurice\", (oddly enough,) Samantha's father on the show. But what venerated British theatrical play was he in that was televised two years before \"Bewitched\"?", "correct": "Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\"", "options": ["\"I, Claudius\"", "\"Lassie, Come Home!\"", "Shaespeare's \"Falstaff\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nShakespeare's \"The Tempest\".\n\n\tCan you believe such a stellar acting personage would waste his time and reputation on this show? Thankfully, he compensated for it to some degree by portraying the curmudgeonly Dr. Zaius in the far more clever \"The Planet of the Apes\" while he was also acting on \"Bewitched\".\r Evans had an extremely varied career, starring in everything from \"Bewitched\" to \"Planet of the Apes\" to the early 60s teleplay of Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" to \"Androcles & The Lion\" and (shudder!) Rosemary's Baby\" (look...yet another link!). He worked more than once with Charlton Heston as well, co-starring with him in the forgettable \"The War Lord\". Also, while he was doing \"Bewitched\", he was head of the venerable \"Old Vic\" theatre company in Great Britain. He, like most of the cast of the show, is no longer with us, having exited this mortal coil 15 years after his \"wife\", Agnes Moorehead.  What a waste! \n"}, {"text": "Even Sam herself, Elizabeth Montgomery, had been in some things that would put the silly show about witchcraft to shame. What classic anthology TV show, about the weird way fate exacts justice sometimes, did she play a one-time role in?", "correct": "The Twilight Zone", "options": ["The Outer Limits", "Way, Way Out", "Tales Of The Unexpected"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Twilight Zone.\n\n\tShe was in the episode \"Two\" along with Charles Bronson, of all people, playing what looked like the last woman on Earth after a devastating war. The union of these two was inevitable, considering that Bronson was playing what was more than likely the last man alive.\r We lost the elfin, very pretty Ms. Montgomery to colorectal cancer in 1995, at the too-young age of 62. \n"}, {"text": "Steve Franken, who played wise guy Cousin Henry, as well as other roles on the show, was in a sitcom that walked all over \"Bewitched\" with combat boots, or in Franken's case, opera pumps. What early 60s sitcom about teens did Franken co-star in, and what was his character?", "correct": "\"The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis\", as Chatsworth Osborne Jr.", "options": ["\"Hennesy\", as Lt. Cosgrove", "\"Hey, Jeanny!\", as Ike, the bellhop", "\"The Real McCoys\", as City Slicker Myron Glick"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis\", as Chatsworth Osborne Jr.\n\n\tSteve Franken was an actor who showed up in an awful lot of vehicles, both TV and movie. He was in a show about three medical students living together called \"Tom, Dick and Mary\" right after \"Dobie\" was woefully cancelled; played the mischievious relative of Sam's in \"Bewitched\" and played a technician in the classic sci-fi thriller \"WestWorld\". He's turned up in numerous shows and films since, as well. \n"}, {"text": "Tim Moore gave form to what had to be one of the funniest black sitcom characters ever, though the show he was on was taken to task as being disgraceful to African Americans. What show was this, and what was the character?", "correct": "\"Amos & Andy\", as George \"Kingfish\" Stevens", "options": ["\"Good Times\", as Desiduatin' Jones", "\"Beulah\", as Al \"Fatha\" Betts", "\"Sanford & Son\", as Lamont's Uncle Joe"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Amos & Andy\", as George \"Kingfish\" Stevens.\n\n\t\"Kingfish\" had to be one of the best realized black comedy characters ever! He was an inept, funny schemer who murdered the king's English but had you in stiches as he tried to pull a fast one on just about every other character on the show. His wife, Sapphire, has become synonymous with contrary black womanhood. \n"}, {"text": "What late 50s, ill-advised game show had Jackie Gleason, the host, actually apologizing for it the very first week after it premiered?", "correct": "You're In The Picture", "options": ["I've Got A Boil", "How Much Weight Have I Gained Since Tuesday?", "Which Elevator Tune Is That?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou're In The Picture.\n\n\tThis show, which lasted exactly two months, was a summer replacement show for Jackie Gleason's own regular show. In it, celebrity panel members would stick their heads through a carnival-type poster that portrayed a scene or person, and they would have to guess what type of picture they were part of. Gleason felt honor-bound to apologize to the studio and TV audiences for what he felt was an incredible bomb. \n"}, {"text": "There was an animated version of \"Amos & Andy\"!", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tYep! Called \"Calvin and The Colonel\" it was, believe it or not, actually created by the same two men responisible for \"Amos & Andy\", and the parallels were obvious: There was Colonel Montgomery J. Klaxon, a fox, who was obviously supposed to be Kingfish, and Calvin Burnside, a bear, who was the double of Andy Hogg Brown from the live action show. The Colonel even had a Sapphire-type wife! This show lasted exactly one year, but if memory serves me correctly, it wasn't a full year. \n"}]}
