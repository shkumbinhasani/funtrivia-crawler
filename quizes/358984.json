The designs vary in color and pattern, but the orange clownfish is the most widely recognized species (also the species of Marlin, Nemo, and Coral in the film). \n"}, {"text": "Not long after finding a new home, Marlin and Coral were attacked by a fearsome predator. The long, eel-like fish with an underbite and extremely sharp teeth ate Coral and all but one little egg... Nemo.\n\nWhat kind of fish is described?", "correct": "Barracuda", "options": ["Piranha", "Swordfish", "Lionfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarracuda.\n\n\tOf the 27 species of barracuda, the great barracuda is perhaps the most easily recognized.

That's when they bite (thinking they're going to get a morsel of food falling from the mouth). \n"}, {"text": "The scariest day for a parent arrives, and Nemo goes to his first day of school.

Sherman's tank is Gil?", "correct": "Moorish idol", "options": ["Royal gramma", "Porcupine fish", "Four-striped damselfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoorish idol.\n\n\tThe Moorish idol gets its name from the place where it is known as a bringer of happiness, the Moors of Africa. It is one of the most widely recognized fish kept in aquariums, and as such is used in many ocean designs. I once had a fish-themed bathroom, and this particular fish was the most frequent species found in the bathroom related items such as soap dispenser and toothbrush holder. However, it does not live as long as most other aquarium fish, and is fairly sensitive. \n"}, {"text": "After finally rescuing Nemo, the fish come across a school of fish being captured by fishermen. They save the giant mass of fish by swimming down. The fish they save have incredibly strong gills, and can lock themselves tightly in a cave with said gills. They also have strong vacuum-like mouths, sucking in prey and digging in sand with their suction.\n\nWhat fish was found in this large group?", "correct": "Grouper", "options": ["Tuna", "Sturgeon", "Coelacanth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrouper.\n\n\tGroupers typically eat whole fish, rather than biting. They can pull in prey with their powerful sucking power, and they also use this feature to dig in the sand. They suck the sand in and expel it through their gills. Speaking of gills, their gill muscles are so powerful that it becomes almost impossible to remove them from their self-dug cave home if they feel threatened. Interestingly, they have also been known to hunt mutually with moray eels. \n"}]}
