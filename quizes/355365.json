Pulling back the covers, she finds that Grace has been bleeding out.  The nuns contemplate calling Dr. Arden but they feel that he may be responsible.  As Grace starts to lose consciousness she witnesses a woman dressed in black approach her from across the room and lean in for a kiss.  Before she can receive the kiss, the nuns bring her back saying \"we almost lost you.\"  Grace wishes they'd let her go.\rMary Eunice heads down to Dr. Arden's lab to tell him about Grace's condition; she nearly died because of him.  Arden denies this since he never performed the sterilization procedure.  Arden also dislikes her tone; he says that he is the head of the institution now-- not her.  She proves her place in the hierarchy when she flings him across the room with her mind. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Briarcliff patient who cuts his wrists?", "correct": "Miles", "options": ["Davis", "Louis", "Eddie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiles.\n\n\tIn the asylum's kitchen, an inmate, Miles, has trouble with the schizophrenic voices in his head.  Watching a nun use an automatic slicer he gets an idea.  He offers to look at the machine before placing his wrists on the spinning blade.  When Mary Eunice comes downstairs to find the doctors bandaging Miles' wrists to stop the bleeding she sees three ancient symbols on the wall spelling out a name in Aramaic.  Noticeably worried, she asks Miles how he knows the name on the wall; he says he can't even read it so he could never know it.  Mary Eunice asks that the wall be scrubbed immediately as Miles is brought upstairs to his cell.\rMiles wakes up to find the dark figure standing over his bed having been summoned; she's there to help him.  He pulls out the stitches in his wrist as she comes in and gives him a kiss, ending his pain. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the archangel that visits Briarcliff?", "correct": "Shachath", "options": ["Balthazar", "Zauriel", "Uriel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShachath.\n\n\tThe figure, an archangel by the name of Shachath, is interrupted by someone entering the room-- Sister Mary Eunice-- who is able to see her.  Mary Eunice asks her to leave since she came for the soul she was asked to take.  Shachath realizes that the being inside of this once-gentle nun is a fallen angel, a dark cousin, and she knows that the once-pure girl inside is begging to get out.  Mary Eunice urges her to leave but Shachath claims that they'll meet again.\rGrace awakens in her bed to find Dr. Arden standing over her.  He says that she has a bad infection because of the botched hysterectomy he never performed.  To make things right, he has to clean her up.\rIn the basement lair of Dr. Thredson's house, Lana loses hope.

Since Kit allegedly claimed to have killed Alma, the courts have all they need to convict.  When Kit says that Grace can testify since she saw Alma, the lawyer says it doesn't matter-- in fact she's so sick she may not make it to the hearing.  Kit decides to break free.  Using a three-hole punch he knocks out the lawyer and escapes out the window.\rThe archangel Shachath emerges to speak to Lana who cries that death would be better than the abuse she now faces.  Lana says she used to be scared of death but she is no longer; the angel leans in for a kiss, but Lana stops her at the last moment.  She can't do it yet.  That's when Thredson comes in. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Thredson speaks to Lana about a grave issue-- they've reached an impasse.

There's something troubling him; he's not angry at her, but he shouldn't have brought her to his house in the first place.  Instead, he should've killed her before they reached their impasse.  He decides to kill her now and as he leans over top of her with a syringe he tells her that she'll be with her departed lover, Wendy, in no time. Taking the photo of Wendy off her nightstand, Lana smashes it across Thredson's head before they brawl onto the floor.  Lana gets the upper hand by using the chain tethered to her ankle to strangle her captor until he's unconscious; she then takes the keys from his pocket and flees. She doesn't get far though-- Thredson tries to pull her down the stairs but with a quick action she knocks him back out.

Luckily, he allows her to hop into the passenger seat and keeps going.  Lana thanks him for saving her life and he says it didn't seem like there was much of a choice.  The man believes she had a fight with her boyfriend and immediately starts believing that she's trying to play the role of the victim.  Lana asks him to stop the car and he makes it apparent that he's had relationship issues in the past.  Lana sees Shachath sitting in the back seat as the man pulls out a revolver and shoots himself in the head.  Despite Lana's attempt to take the wheel, the car crashes.\rWhen Lana awakens she's laying in a bed in Briarcliff Manor.  Sister Mary Eunice says she's back where she belongs. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these was left behind in Mr. Goodman's room (for Jude)?", "correct": "An alcoholic drink", "options": ["A set of keys", "A business card", "A blue coat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn alcoholic drink.\n\n\tJude finds the body of Sal Goodman in his motel bathroom, bleeding out from a mirror shard in his neck.  He reveals to Jude with his dying words that the perpetrator was one of her own nuns.  When Jude picks up the phone to call the police she finds a bottle of whiskey on the nightstand and a newspaper clipping taped to the television regarding the girl who she hit with her car many years ago.\rThis causes Jude to recall a series of events in 1949.  After drinking too much and sleeping through a gig, one of her band members arrived at her place to tell her she'd been replaced.  Before leaving, he let her know that the police wanted to ask her if she knew anything about the girl in the blue coat who'd been hit by a car earlier in the week.  To cope, Jude packed her belongings, hopped into her car, and started to drink.  When she woke up it was daytime and she found herself parked in front of a convent.

Mary Eunice says that Goodman's murder will be pinned on Jude and she already changed the evidence in the room to show that he was uncovering the truth behind the hit-and-run case.  Mary Eunice admits to being the demon who possessed the boy in Briarcliff; that's how she knows her darkest secrets.  She also left behind a bottle of whiskey and a straight-razor.\rJude heads to a local diner and steps into the restroom with the razor blade.  Standing in front of the mirror she contemplates slitting her wrists and ending it all, but she stops herself.  Stepping back into the restaurant she finds Shachath sitting at her booth having expected a different result.  Jude says that the angel has jumped the gun again-- she should never trust a drunk-- although she only comes when she's called and it was for a different reason this time.  Jude asks if it's any different from the night she left her husband or the night she hit the girl in the blue coat.  Shachath says that it was the night when God revealed he had a plan for her.  The angel says that Jude deserves peace and encourages her to give in but Jude says she has one more order of business to attend to before she's ready. \n"}, {"text": "In this episode, Jude discovers which of the following shocking truths?", "correct": "She never killed the girl in blue", "options": ["Sister Mary Eunice was the girl she struck with her car", "God never wanted her to be a nun", "She was supposed to have died many years earlier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe never killed the girl in blue.\n\n\tJude's final business is to make amends and right her wrongs.  She visits a couple and claims to be their daughter's old teacher; the man and woman are the parents of Missy, the young girl in the blue coat.  She starts to come clean, however, and says that she's a nun, but not before Missy walks into the house. Jude is utterly shocked by the girl's appearance, alive and well, and explains that she became a nun shortly after Missy's accident believing her to be run over by a car when she was a girl.  Jude says that she'd been lighting candles for her soul and she never reveals that she was the one who hit her. Missy came home with a few broken bones, says her mother, but the monster who hit her has to live with themselves. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of the episode, which character is shot and killed?", "correct": "Grace", "options": ["Lana", "Kit", "Dr. Arden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrace.\n\n\tLana demands to speak to Sister Jude but Sister Mary Eunice says that she's now the person in charge.  Lana explains the truth about Dr. Thredson and reveals everything-- it was Thredson from the start.  Mary Eunice says that Lana is confused but she retorts that Kit Walker is innocent.  Mary Eunice knows, of course, as she saw into Thredson during the exorcism, an she admits that she believes Lana.  Mary Eunice says that no one knows she's back at Briarcliff and that she's safe.\rDownstairs, Kit races through the death chute to make his way back into the asylum.  Little does he know that a creature from the forest is following behind.  Kit finds Grace in the kitchen, healthy (thanks to Dr. Arden's miracle medicine), and goes to embrace her before they depart.  When they reach the door, however, a nun screams for help and is attacked and killed by the creature from outside.  Kit is able to defeat the mutant by disemboweling it, but not before it attracts the guard's attention.  Frank takes a shot at Kit but hits Grace, who sacrifices herself by jumping in front of the bullet, instead.  As they leave the room, Grace submits to Shachath and dies on the kitchen floor. \n"}]}
