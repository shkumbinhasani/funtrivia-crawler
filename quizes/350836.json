{"id": "350836", "name": "Four Score... Trivia Quiz | Mixed | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Mixed", " Odd One Out"], "questions": [{"text": "Four films are listed below.  Three were directed by Gore Verbinski.  Which one was not?", "correct": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides", "options": ["Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest", "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl", "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.\n\n\tThe first \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movie, \"Curse of the Black Pearl\", was released in 2003.  It was directed by Gore Verbinski, and was based on the Disneyland ride called \"Pirates of the Caribbean\".  Verbinski also directed the second and third \"POTC\" films (\"Dead Man's Chest\" and \"At World's End\"), but it was Rob Marshall who directed the fourth installation in the series, \"On Stranger Tides\" (2011). \n"}, {"text": "Four foods are mentioned below.  Three are fruits, but one is a vegetable.  Can you spot the odd one out?", "correct": "Ahipa", "options": ["Abiu", "Arhat", "Atemoya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAhipa.\n\n\tThe abiu is a fruit that grows in the tropical regions of South America.  It tastes like a sopadilla, which has the flavor of caramel custard.  The arhat is a fruit used for medicines that is native to China.  It is often referred to as one of several \"longevity fruits\".  It has been used for thousands of years as a natural sweetener, and to help with diabetes and obesity.  An atemoya is a crossbreed of a sugar apple and a cherimoya.  It is native to the American tropics, but is very popular in Taiwan.  There, it is sometimes referred to as the pineapple sugar apple (though this is not a correct title for the fruit, as it is crossbred with the cherimoya, instead of the popularly believed pineapple).\r That leaves the ahipa, which is the vegetable.  It grows high in the Bolivian mountains, and is related to the jicima, and has a very similar taste. \n"}, {"text": "Four video game series are listed.

They are known for many video game series, especially the \"Final Fantasy\", \"Kingdom Hearts\", and \"Dragon Quest\" series.  They also created several of the \"Call of Duty\" games.  \"Halo\", however, was not created by Square Co, Enix, or Square Enix, but instead by Bungie. \n"}, {"text": "Four items are listed, and each are living creatures.  Three of them walk on four legs.  One of them is bipedal, as it is a primate species.

Who?", "correct": "Jay Leno", "options": ["Jimmy Durante", "Barbara Streisand", "Michael Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJay Leno.\n\n\tBarbara Streisand was quite well known (besides for singing and acting) for her \"crooked\" nose.  It was quite long and slender, but had a bend in the middle.  Jimmy Durante was known for his large and very long nose (of course, he was also a famous singer/actor as well).  Michael Jackson, quite a famed singer, was well known for his deformed nose, caused by perhaps a few too many surgeries...\r Though some know Jay Leno as having a large nose as well, he is more noted for his extremely large chin.  Jay Leno is also known, of course, as a stand-up comedian. \n"}, {"text": "Four songs are mentioned.  Three feature rapper Nicki Minaj.  One does not.  Which one?", "correct": "Titanium", "options": ["Where Dem Girls At", "Bottoms Up", "Turn Me On"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTitanium.\n\n\t\"Bottoms Up\" is a song by Trey Songz featuring Nicki Minaj.

Robb", "Sarah Hardesty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJanet Dailey.\n\n\tNora Roberts is a famous author who goes by several different pseudonyms.  Her writing style (as well as the genre she writes in) is different for each of her pen names.  Nora Roberts uses the pen name \"J. D. Robb\" for her \"In Death\" series, and the other names a bit less often (Jill March was used for a few short stories only).\r Janet Dailey is a different author completely, though she has admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Nora Roberts' works. \n"}, {"text": "Four bizarre \"religions\" are mentioned below, but only three are true \"parody religions\".  The fourth I completely made up.  Which one is it?", "correct": "Bieberology", "options": ["Pastafarianism", "Invisible Pink Unicorn", "Jedi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBieberology.\n\n\tFortunately, \"Bieberology\" is not a religion.  Pastafarianism, Jediism, and the Invisible Pink Unicorn, however, are true religions.  Pastafarianists believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster as their 'god', and pirates are highly regarded.  They blame much of the world's problems on the decreasing number of pirates of the world. Jediism was started in 2001 with a petition to make the \"Star Wars\" Jedi a religion, and by the end of the petition, 1.5% of United Kingdom residents claimed to be Jedi, thus making it a bonifide religion.  The Invisible Pink Unicorn is a parodoxical religion, since a unicorn cannot be both invisible and pink at the same time. \n"}, {"text": "Four things mentioned below are kitchen implements. Three of them strain foods.  One is a pair of tongs.  Which is the tongs?", "correct": "Chimta", "options": ["Chinoise", "Colander", "Cheesecloth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChimta.\n\n\tThe colander, chinoise, and cheesecloth all strain foods, each at a different mesh level.  Colanders typically have large holes, while cheesecloth is very tight and often used for coffee straining or tea bags.\r Chimta is a word that literally means \"tongs\", and therefore will strain nothing. \n"}]}
