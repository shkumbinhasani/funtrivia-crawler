{"id": "135018", "name": "Put the words in the blender. Find strange results Trivia Game | Humanities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "Vocabulary", "Portmanteau Words"], "questions": [{"text": "Which two words were blended together to make the word \"Chunnel\"?", "correct": "channel and tunnel", "options": ["church and funnel", "choice and bundle", "churn and runnel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nchannel and tunnel.\n\n\tBefore it was built the Channel Tunnel was often referred to as \"the Chunnel\". Nowadays most people seem to use the full expression \"Channel Tunnel\". Strange is the behaviour of language. \n"}, {"text": "Which modern blend word was formed out of the combined names of the two oldest universities in England?", "correct": "Oxbridge", "options": ["Yorkbury", "Camford", "Readham"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOxbridge.\n\n\tAs the oldest English university Oxford was probably made the prefix in the word \"Oxbridge\" when referring to Oxford and Cambridge collectively. Reversing the order would give \"Camford\" but, if it ever really existed, this has now slipped totally out of use. An \"Oxbridge\" graduate has all the advantages of both a good education and a high \"snob\" value in the market-place. \n"}, {"text": "Which two words were blended together to make \"fantabulous\"?", "correct": "\"fantastic\" and \"fabulous\"", "options": ["\"fantastic\" and \"marvellous\"", "\"fantasy\" and \"fabulous\"", "\"fanatic\" and \"tantalus\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"fantastic\" and \"fabulous\".\n\n\tThis new blend word seems almost unnecessary. It only serves its purpose when someone is being rather exaggeratedly enthusiastic. It really adds nothing new in meaning but just redoubles the strength of the two words it is formed from. \n"}, {"text": "\"Anecdotage\" is a blend word. Which definition best fits its meaning?", "correct": "The time in life when people get old and constantly retell stories.", "options": ["A machine needed for measuring the speed of the wind.", "The state of being excessively fond of a young woman.", "Moving slowly because of extreme old age."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe time in life when people get old and constantly retell stories.\n\n\tThe two words that form this blend are \"anecdote\" which is a short story and \"dotage\" which is the onset of senility. Older people are popularly supposed to be in the habit of constantly retelling the same stories to anyone who will listen. \n"}, {"text": "What is \"Spanglish\"?", "correct": "A mixture of Spanish and English.", "options": ["A soft cloth decorated with small shiny ornaments.", "A cross-breed dog - part Spaniel and part sheep-dog", "A special grease used for loosening rusty nuts and bolts."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA mixture of Spanish and English.\n\n\tThis term (usually of contempt) was used to indicate the way in which some forms of Spanish adopted English words without doing anything to make them truly Hispanic. Thus we got \"el gasfitter\" and others of the same ilk. \n"}, {"text": "Another advance in technology brought us the \"transistor\". Which two words were used to make this blend?", "correct": "\"transfer\" and \"resistor\"", "options": ["\"transit\" and \"resistor\"", "\"transport\" and \"resistor\"", "\"transform\" and \"varistor\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"transfer\" and \"resistor\".\n\n\tA \"transistor\" is a small semi-conducting device used to magnify electric currents as previously found in portable radios. Nowadays silicon chips take the same idea and makes the device even smaller. \n"}, {"text": "The word \"prissy\" gets the first part of its blend from \"prim\". Which word makes up the second part of the blend?", "correct": "sissy", "options": ["missy", "dizzy", "fussy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsissy.\n\n\tNaturally this word took a long time to get established in the dictionary as it appears to derive partly from slang. \n"}, {"text": "Because of their technical expertise with cartoon films a word has been especially coined to identify these products that come from Japan. What is it?", "correct": "Japanimation", "options": ["Nipponimation", "Godzillanimation", "Typhoonimation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapanimation.\n\n\tBlending together \"Japan\" and \"animation\" is, of course, the most obvious of these. However, Godzilla is a popular Japanese concept that might eventually require its own name. Remember that I now own the copyright on this word! \n"}, {"text": "A \"travelogue\" or \"travelog\" is a film about travels with an added commentary. You may be sure that \"travel\" is one part of the blend but where does the other part come from?", "correct": "monologue", "options": ["dialogue", "prologue", "duologue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmonologue.\n\n\tNearly all \"travelogues\" have just one person speaking and thus it is clear that \"monologue\" is the one that is needed from this family of \"logues\", as a dictionary will confirm. \n"}, {"text": "A new blend word is \"meanderthal\". What is its meaning?", "correct": "A slow and unintelligent person who wanders along and blocks your way.", "options": ["A man who traces the course of underground rivers.", "A man who is obsessed by digging for ancient bones.", "A primitive race of people found on remote Pacific islands."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA slow and unintelligent person who wanders along and blocks your way.\n\n\tIt is a blend of \"meander\" which means to wander aimlessly and \"neanderthal\" which is a type of primitive man from whom we may be partly descended. The person who coined this word was obviously thinking of those people who seem to proceed aimlessly through shopping centres with no thought to other people's progress. \n"}]}
