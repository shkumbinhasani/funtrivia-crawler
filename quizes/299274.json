He won a landslide victory over Democrat Alfred E Smith, gaining 58% of the popular vote. His First Lady, Lou Henry Hoover had graduated with a degree in biology from Stanford. Hoover took office on March 4, 1929 and the Great Depression that would blight his entire Presidency began less than a year later. When Hoover campaigned against Roosevelt in the 1932 election, it was in front of crowds more hostile than those faced by any previous sitting President.\rAfter his Presidency, Hoover spent much of his time writing and fishing. A year before his death in 1964, he published \"Fishing for Fun -- And to Wash Your Soul\", his 16th published book. \n"}, {"text": "Who took over as Luxemburg's head of state in October 2000?", "correct": "Henri", "options": ["William IV", "Jean", "Charlotte"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenri.\n\n\tThe 45 year old Henri Albert Gabriel F\u00e9lix Marie Guillaume became Grand Duke Henri on October 7, 2000 following the abdication of his father, Grand Duke Jean.

Despite the relatively short period of his reign, Edward VI's legacy was significant in two areas. The first was the Reformation and the establishment of the Church of England, which progressed to the extend that his Catholic sister, Mary I, who effectively followed him on the throne, could not undo what had been done in his name. The second was in the field of education, with numerous King Edward VI Schools still leading their field in England in the 21st century.\rOf the alternatives, Edward VIII abdicated the throne in 1936 before his coronation. Lady Jane Grey, who ascended to the throne for nine days following Edward VI's death, was executed. Edward V survived slightly longer -- about ten weeks before his presumed murder. Edward V was one of the two 'Princes in the Tower' who were never seen again after being sent to the Tower of London 'for their protection' by the future King Richard III in June 1483.\rIt rather makes you wonder if any future British monarch will be brave enough to take the name 'Edward' again, doesn't it? \n"}, {"text": "Although his reign began in December 2006, the coronation of the 28 year old King Jigme on November 6, 2008 officially established him as the world's youngest reigning monarch and head of state.
