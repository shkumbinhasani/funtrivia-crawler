Which show is it?", "correct": "'Charlie's Angels'", "options": ["'The Rockford Files'", "'The Odd Couple'", "'The Andy Griffith Show'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Charlie's Angels'.\n\n\tAlmost immediately after Mills says this, it's revealed that Somerset's plan has not been quite so silly after all -- it has led them directly to John Doe. \n"}, {"text": "The 'sloth' victim is called Victor, but the police captain (R.

The 'sloth' victim was brutally malnourished, but was quite alive when found by the police...although it's suggested that he might not live much longer. Doe killed the 'gluttony' victim by force-feeding him, then kicking the overstuffed large intestine until it burst, causing massive internal bleeding that led to his death. \n"}, {"text": "One more for the road. If the point of John Doe's 'masterpiece' was indeed for seven people to die for committing each of the deadly sins, then by the film's end it was technically incomplete -- one 'sinner' was left alive. Which of the seven deadly sins did he or she commit?", "correct": "wrath & vengeance", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nwrath & vengeance.\n\n\tBy the time Doe surrenders, there are still two more sins that have yet to be featured among his crimes: envy and wrath. Doe's murder of Tracy Mills, he claims, made him guilty of envy, and he pays for that sin with his life when Mills kills him. But David, who has committed the final sin, wrath, is not killed for his transgression...although he may very well wish that he had been, considering his great loss. \n"}]}
