Then, in 1977, she died - and the public began to realize all had not been quite right. Her daughter Christina, disinherited in her will, published a shocking memoir of child abuse the following year. What was it called?", "correct": "Mommie Dearest", "options": ["My Mother's Way of Life", "Wire Hangers and a Wired Mother", "Mistreated and Disinherited"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMommie Dearest.\n\n\tCrawford had adopted Christina in 1940, after her divorce from her second husband. Three more adoptions followed: Christopher in 1941 (he was returned to his biological mother the next year), a second child named Christopher in 1943, and the twins Cindy and Cathy in 1947. By the time of her death, her relationship with her older children was strained; her will notoriously closed with the line \"It is my intention to make no provision herein for my son Christopher or my daughter Christina for reasons which are well known to them.\" Perhaps it was this insult that drove Christina to write about her childhood, inaugurating the celebrity tell-all genre.In her account - disputed by some of Crawford's friends, but supported by others - Christina wrote of her mother's struggles with alcoholism, perfectionism and possible bipolar disorder. Famously, Crawford was said to fly into violent rages at the smallest things - such as her young daughter's use of a wire hanger to store a dress. The book, and the much less successful movie adaptation that followed three years later, are an indelible stain on Crawford's reputation. \n"}, {"text": "It's harder for celebrities to hide their parenting mistakes these days, with camera crews swarming the streets of Los Angeles. In the first year of her first son's life, this pop singer was photographed driving with him on her lap; encountered child protective services when he fell out of his high chair; and almost dropped him on a cobblestone sidewalk. Oops! Whose errors in judgment cost her in her custody battle with ex-husband Kevin Federline?", "correct": "Britney Spears", "options": ["Madonna", "Melissa Etheridge", "Avril Lavigne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBritney Spears.\n\n\tBritney Spears's son Sean Preston Federline was born in September 2005; his brother Jayden James followed almost exactly a year later. They were her first children, and her then-husband Kevin Federline's third and fourth; he had started dating Spears when his fianc\u00e9e Shar Jackson was pregnant with his second child.Neither Spears nor Federline was likely to win any parenting prizes, but the constant media spotlight -- and the temptations of show business -- did not help them. Spears filed for divorce when Jayden was not quite two months old, and the custody circus began. After some very bizarre and extremely well-publicized incidents -- including Spears's refusal to give Federline the children after a visit, and her subsequent hospitalization for a mental breakdown -- Federline was awarded full custody in July 2008. It was hoped that Spears, given greater visitation rights, would then have the space she needed to work on some of her parenting skills. \n"}, {"text": "Most parents, worrying about what might happen to their children after a parent's death, plan carefully so that things will be taken care of. Then there are the parents who don't. When James Brown, Godfather of Soul, died of complications of pneumonia in 2006, what surprise did his will reveal?", "correct": "His youngest child,  a five-year-old, was not provided for at all.", "options": ["His youngest child - a twelve-year-old - was to become a ward of the state, since no guardian was specified.", "All of his children were specifically disinherited.", "He left money to each of his children - on the condition that none of it be shared with their spouses or their mothers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis youngest child,  a five-year-old, was not provided for at all.\n\n\tBrown had a complex family life. When he died, he was survived by six grown children from three marriages, and one five-year-old son (James Brown Jr) from his controversial fourth marriage to Tomi Rae Hynie. (Hynie, formerly one of Brown's back-up singers, was technically still married to her first husband when she married Brown in 2001 - legally invalidating her marriage to Brown.) His will, written before the birth of his youngest child, mentioned only his \"six living children\" from his previous marriages, as did the trust he set up to handle assets like his home and the rights to his music. Under South Carolina state law, a child born after the date of the last will still has some rights to inherit - but young James Jr.'s claim was rapidly tied up in lawsuits and paternity tests. His mother, claiming the half-share of the estate she felt she was due as Brown's wife, faced an even steeper legal battle.\r The moral of the story: make sure your will is up-to-date, especially if you're a famous music star with a passel of competitive descendants. \n"}, {"text": "As a group, celebrities have long been famed for giving their children outlandish names. Some of these names are so outlandish that gossips and celebrity watchers label them cruel: they imagine the star parents must be knowingly condemning their children to a lifetime of teasing, awkward explanations, and difficulty filling out forms. Which of these oddly named children is NOT correctly matched with his or her celebrity parent?", "correct": "Moxie CrimeFighter, daughter of Coco Chanel", "options": ["Moon Unit, daughter of Frank Zappa", "Kal-El, son of Nicolas Cage", "Apple, daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoxie CrimeFighter, daughter of Coco Chanel.\n\n\tMoxie CrimeFighter Jillette, daughter of comedian and magician Penn Jillette and television producer Emily Zolten, was born in June 2005. Saying that a person has \"moxie\" implies that they have guts or backbone; saying that a person IS Moxie is, well, likely to raise a few eyebrows. Fashion mogul Coco Chanel never had children, although the legacy of her work survives to this day.\r Moxie Jillette shares a birth year with Kal-El Coppola, son of actor Nicolas Cage and wife Alice Kim, a child who will grow up with an unusually close connection to comic-book superhero Superman (whose birth name -- on the planet Krypton! -- was Kal-El). Apple Martin, daughter of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, is almost a year older, with a birthday in 2004. Moon Unit Zappa, daughter of rock singer Frank Zappa and businesswoman Adelaide Sloat, is the oldest of the bunch; born in 1967, she has made a career for herself as an actress and novelist. \n"}, {"text": "A stable, loving home is generally agreed to be best for any child, but that was something this movie star just couldn't provide. In 1958, one of the \"Imitation of Life\" actress's violent arguments with her boyfriend so frightened her daughter Cheryl that the child intervened to defend her mother - fatally. Which classic film star thus found herself mother to a fourteen-year-old on trial for murder?", "correct": "Lana Turner", "options": ["Elizabeth Taylor", "Zsa Zsa Gabor", "Doris Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLana Turner.\n\n\tHollywood bombshell Lana Turner had just divorced her fourth husband (out of seven total) when she met Johnny Stompanato, a handsome ex-Marine who was violent and jealous. After a year or two of abuse, Turner was torn between her desire to leave him and her desire to believe his promises of better times ahead. By April 4, 1958, she was ready to tell him that their relationship was over - and the resulting argument was so loud and violent that 14-year-old Cheryl Crane grabbed a kitchen knife and ran into the room to protect her mother. Stompanato, standing just inside the door, was fatally injured. \r At the coroner's inquest, the jury determined that the homicide was \"justifiable\": they believed that the child had acted in defense of herself and her mother. The prosecutor elected not to pursue charges against Cheryl, although - concerned about Turner's parenting abilities - he did succeed in making her a ward of the state. The troubled girl grew up to have a successful career in real estate, and as an adult she formed a good relationship with her mother. \n"}, {"text": "Great actors, even if they become enduring icons of masculinity, are not always emblems of fatherhood. When his adult son pled guilty to manslaughter in 1990, this famous actor tried to make amends, testifying at the sentencing hearing that he and his former wife had been bad parents. Who was this Hollywood leading man, who said \"Sayonara\" in 2004?", "correct": "Marlon Brando", "options": ["Paul Newman", "Karl Malden", "Rock Hudson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarlon Brando.\n\n\tChristian Brando (1958-2008) was the son of two actors, the successful Marlon Brando (two-time Oscar winner) and the much less successful Anna Kashfi. They had married only because of Christian's impending birth, and separated acrimoniously when he was an infant; the next thirteen years of his life were marked by an ugly custody battle.(Christian's father, an emotionally distant man, gained custody after friends of Kashfi's kidnapped the boy for ransom.) In 1990, a drunken Christian Brando murdered Dag Drollet, boyfriend of his sister Cheyenne. At the sentencing hearing, his father testified to his failures as a parent: \"I led a wasted life ... Perhaps I failed as a father.The tendency is always to blame the other person. There were things I could have done differently, I did the best I could.\" Despite his efforts, Christian was sentenced to ten years in prison; after his release, although he made an attempt at living quietly, he continued to appear in tabloids for his involvement in other Hollywood scandals and his 2005 guilty plea in a spousal abuse case. He died of pneumonia at 49. Cheyenne committed suicide in 1995, at the age of 25. Marlon Brando, it seems, was far more successful as \"Godfather\" than as father. \n"}, {"text": "Michael Jackson - once renowned as the King of Pop - came under fire later on for his interactions with the children of strangers, and his raising of his own children has also caused controversy. In 2002, he landed in the tabloids for holding his infant son out over a balcony railing, above a crowd of fans. But he wasn't completely blind to the baby's best interests. How was the child protected?", "correct": "A blanket shielded his face from photographers.", "options": ["He was attached to his father with a safety harness.", "Firefighters were at the ready to catch the baby if he fell.", "He was wearing a crash helmet."], "explanation": "\n\n\nA blanket shielded his face from photographers.\n\n\tYoung Prince Michael Jackson II (Prince Michael Jackson I is his older brother) is Jackson's third child. In November 2002, at the age of about nine months, the child accompanied his father and older siblings to Berlin, where Jackson was to attend a benefit gala and accept a lifetime achievement award. When a crowd of fans collected underneath Jackson's fourth-floor balcony and asked if they could see his baby, Jackson held the infant out over the railing, with no protection other than an arm around his waist. There was, however, a cloth draped over the baby's face, earning him the tabloid nickname \"Blanket.\" The scene was played on news programs around the world, and the stunt was widely criticized; Jackson released a statement admitting that he \"made a terrible mistake.\"\r A year later, he was charged with the molestation of a young boy, who had attended several sleepovers at Jackson's ranch; arguing that the sleepovers had been completely platonic, Jackson was acquitted in 2005. \n"}, {"text": "Parents normally try to protect their young children from the harshest facts of life -- so it is, to say the least, horrifying when a parent inflicts a double tragedy on his or her offspring. Which of the following celebrities was NEVER accused of murdering his wife or ex-wife, the mother of his child or children?", "correct": "Phil Hartman, comedian", "options": ["Robert Blake, actor", "O.J. Simpson, athlete", "All of these men were accused of murdering the women they had married."], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhil Hartman, comedian.\n\n\tO.J. Simpson, an American football star and actor, was tried for the 1994 murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson; their daughter and son were eight and five at the time of her death. Robert Blake, an actor specializing in hard-bitten roles, was instantly a suspect when his wife -- Bonnie Lee Bakley, the mother of his baby daughter Rose -- was found murdered outside a restaurant. Both had hugely publicized trials, with Simpson's in particular becoming a media circus; both were convicted in the media and acquitted by the courts; and both retained custody of their traumatized children. (Both were also later successfully sued for the wrongful deaths of the victims in those cases, in the civil courts where the standard of proof is lower. The civil judgment against Simpson was used by the victims' families to prevent him from publishing a book with the singularly tasteless title \"If I Did It.\")\r Phil Hartman, famed for his roles on \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons\", was murdered in his sleep by his wife Brynn in 1998; she killed herself later that day. They left behind two children, aged 9 and 6. \n"}, {"text": "All too often non-celebrities aren't great parents either. Kit was a former Broadway actor who saw his child's chance to make it big - but his management did his son's career more harm than good. \"Getting Even With Dad\" as a teen, his son pursued legal independence from his parents in order to keep his earnings safe, leaving him \"Home Alone.\" Who is Kit's son, one of the most successful child stars ever?", "correct": "Macaulay Culkin", "options": ["Jonathan Taylor Thomas", "Mickey Rooney", "Daniel Radcliffe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMacaulay Culkin.\n\n\tMacaulay Culkin, born in 1980, was the third of his parents' seven children; two of his younger brothers also had acting careers. He played various minor roles on stage, in TV episodes and in the movies from the age of 4, but his breakaway success came with the 1990 release of \"Home Alone,\" in which a clever ten-year-old - accidentally left behind when his family flies to Paris for Christmas - fends off the burglars targeting his home. He spent the next four years anchoring various films, from the tearjerker \"My Girl\" to the comic-book adventure \"Richie Rich,\" but left acting in 1994 as his parents broke up and he became disillusioned with his father's management of his career. He was reportedly tired of being signed up for movie roles without ever getting to see a script; his father's pushy behavior was alienating others in the movie business; and his parents' split made everything more complicated. He sought emancipation from his parents, in part to prevent his earnings from being used up in their bitter custody fight, and then discovered that they had never technically married in the first place.\r In 2000, Culkin began tentatively restarting his acting career, returning to the stage in the West End production of \"Madame Melville\" and finding cult success in the 2003 movie \"Party Monster.\" When his comeback began, he had not spoken to his father in four years. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a writer, actor and director whose films explore the heart of New York City, and whose own heart has gotten him into trouble. In 1992, his twelve-year relationship with an actress ended bitterly when his girlfriend discovered his revealing pictures of her 21-year-old daughter; he married the daughter five years later. Who is this badly-behaving almost-stepfather?", "correct": "Woody Allen", "options": ["Robert Blake", "Fatty Arbuckle", "Roman Polanski"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWoody Allen.\n\n\tSoon-Yi Previn, adopted as a child by Mia Farrow and musician Andr\u00e9 Previn, was only nine when Woody Allen came into her life. There is no evidence that they had a romantic relationship before she was old enough to legally consent to one, but by the time she had grown up he clearly was not thinking of her as a father figure should. (Since Allen and Farrow never married, he was not legally Soon-Yi's stepfather; the morals of the matter are a separate question. He was the legal father of three of Farrow's other children, and his visitation rights with seven-year-old Dylan were revoked in the aftermath of Farrow's discovery.) Allen may have won three Oscars and numerous other prizes, but it's safe to say he won't be winning many awards for his parenting.\r Thank you for joining me in studying some rather dubious lifestyles of the rich and famous! \n"}]}
